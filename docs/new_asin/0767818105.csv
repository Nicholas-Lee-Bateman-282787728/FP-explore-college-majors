14975,5,0767818105,"A great movie with Steve Martin in top form. Not only does he do verbal comedy superbly, his physical comedy in the film is wonderful. The story is a re-telling of Cyrano de Bergerac, and even if you don't know the original, this story works fine without the knowledge of the original. The supporting cast is strong and bring depth to the film. If you lived through the 80s this movie is liable to hit some extra funny spots, but if nothing else, the bar scene where Martin pokes fun at himself and his nose is worth the price of the DVD. Well shot in a beautiful location, this film has tons of laughs, romance, and even some well-placed pathos.",1502064000,,646,4.391666666666667

14990,5,0767818105,"Replacing an old VHS with the much-needed DVD. I've always thought this was Steve Martin's best movie, perhaps because of the classic upon which it's based. The scene of 20 ways in which to describe his nose is a film classic. The problem of drinking a glass of wine was also cleverly written and brilliantly acted.",1498089600,,315,4.642857142857143

14994,4,0767818105,"This movie was filled with fun Irony right from the start. I loved the charming poking fun at oneself by Steve Martin, (who portrayed C.D. Bales a fireman) to him being a master story teller to himself and Roxanne. I enjoyed their exchanges of friendship and when she asks him early on if he remembers her, he chides, I was trying to put it behind me.
 It only becomes apparent after a series of events - C.D. Bales realizes that by embracing his own uniqueness does he realize once and for all - love is about how someone made them feel.",1494201600,,538,4.326732673267327
14995,4,0767818105,"Although it's a bit goofy in places, this is a terrific adaptation of the Cyrano de Bergerac story by Steve Martin.

14997,5,0767818105,"This is my go-to movie for when no one knows what to watch, or when I'm finally alone and the rest of the house is asleep. I never was a fan of Daryl Hannah at all and wonder how well this movie would have translated had her part been cast differently, but having seen it so often, she's fine in the role. (Just once I'd like to see a movie with a gorgeous guy losing his mind over an ordinary or even goofy girl. Nope, they always go for the usual. A blonde, skinny chick will find it in her heart to go for the guy with the enormous flaw, overlook it, and profess eternal love.) Sounds like I'm criticizing my 5 star movie. Nah. I love Steve Martin, although some of his vehicles have been seriously iffy. I believe he is highly intelligent and very talented. This movie is sweet. Give it a try.",1492646400,,797,4.148387096774194

15031,5,0767818105,"I won't write a review about this movie since there's been plenty of those over the years. What I will say about the Blu-ray version is that with the old DVD, you couldn't make out the book titles on the shelves in the scene where Charlie helps Chris write a letter. With this version you can. Darryl Hannah is even more stunning and looks as fantastic in this as the first time I saw this movie in the theater. Steve Martin's nose seems to come out of the screen. I've seen this movie many times and with this format it was like watching it again for the first time.",1489190400,,567,4.2110091743119265

15092,5,0767818105,"Steve Martin, like Robin Williams is a comedic genius.  That means that he can play drama and tragedy better than actors who can only do drama and tragedy.  Yes, there are plenty of yuks, but there is also a warmth that few other actors can reach in a comedic performance.  Sniff at it, if you will, but in the end, it is Martin's character who takes the also wonderful tragedy that is Cyrano de Bergerac (1950), and turns it into a posy of hope, promise, and winning by a nose.",1470268800,2,478,4.288888888888889

15095,1,0767818105,"Rape by deception is not really funny at all. I felt gross watching this with my tween.
She was mortified that someone tricked Daryl Hannah into a sexual relationship and I was just as mortified that it wasn't rated accordingly.  This should have a warning on it.  It should read: This movie is almost all about Rape, but it isn't called rape in this movie. BEWARE, RAPE, FEMALE OBJECTIFICATION, LACK OF CONSENT... on and on really.  The movie could have been a great family comedy if they left out all the rape and storyline accepting rape culture.

Maybe I'm sensitive to rape because I've worked at the Rape Crisis Center so I acknowledge this. However, 1 in 4 women and 1 in 6 men have been or will be sexually assaulted (tricking someone into sex is legally a sexual assault FYI). Sexual assault is one of the most under reported crimes: at least 54% of rapes are never reported; 3% of cases see any type of conviction (DOJ, 2006) -> so films like these that make it seem okay to sexually assault somone aids in the rape culture that preaches acceptance and makes women (especially women) less likely to report sexual assault.

I mean why would you report to the police something you just saw Steve Martin and Daryl Hannah acting out on the big screen (or your flat screen since its miles old now).  My point is, please someone at least label older films like these that rape is part of the story line.

My rant is now over.",1467590400,,1429,4.473076923076923

The fire chief is really smart and has this big nose ... so he can't find the love of his life. The premise was this new guy that every girl in town thinks is a Greek god can't relate to women and needs someone to tell him what to say. He gets panic attacks if he tries to talk to them. Yet he's able to talk to with no problem with the bar-girl as if all of his problems are totally forgotten. Some of the dialog is extremely silly and not believable. The best scene was when Steve figures out 20 ways of saying someone has a big nose. The fire department was filled with a bunch of seriously screwed up guys that were more of a threat to start a fire than put one out. Still ...

Rick Rossovich  plays Chris the new fireman in town who sees Roxanne at the bar and has to leave before he gets sick. C.D. Bales helps Roxanne to get back in her house as she locked her self out. Roxanne tells C.D. that she likes Chris and wonders why Chris hasn't asked her out on a date. Chris is to shy to call her up or talk to her because he knows he will get nervous and get sick. C.D. tells him he should find a way tell her how he feels about her. Chris comes up with a plan write to her how he feels but when he tries to write to her his mind goes blank. C.D tries to help him write a letter to Roxanne. Chris tells him to write to Roxanne and he will sign at the bottom of each letter. This plan works for awhile until Roxanne figures it out that C.D. wrote the letters and not Chris. Then both Roxanne and C.D. make up.

The romantic ode to Cyrano de Bergerac is handled well although the poetic lines to Roxanne can be a bit nauseating lol and I love poetry.... but in the end, while I love this movie it is embarrassing to realize that when they find love it's odd to see Hannah with Martin who's old enough to be her father lol.

Martin and costar Darryl Hannah, who plays the astronomer and love-interest Roxanne Kowalski, sparkle together. The rest of the cast is letter-perfect. Watch it for the romance, the scenery, the sight-gags, and maybe even the implicit commentary on how physical beauty and attractiveness colors everything that humans do and think.

15428,4,0767818105,"I've always had a certain fondness for this movie and yet I've only just watched it beginning to end for the first time. Perhaps it is because this movie is comfort food for the eye. This is a pleasant pleasing romantic comedy. This is also something of a watershed moment for leading star and cowriter Steve Martin. For me Roxanne has always represented the cinematic moment when Steve Martin stopped being the over-the-top ""wild and crazy guy of SNL, and  The Jerk"" and admitted that not only was he intelligent but that he could respect his audience.

I never really thought of the 1897 play Cyrano de Bergerac as a comedy. I'd always thought of it as a swashbuckling romantic drama along the lines of the Three Musketeers. As a romantic comedy it makes more sense. Having tied Roxanne to the famous Cyrano play I will very quickly cover the bare bones of the plot.

Steve Martin plays small-town Fire Chief C. D. Bales an intelligent, resourceful and brave man with a confidence problem tied to his very large nose. Into his life comes Daryl Hannah playing Roxanne an intelligent astronomy student who promptly falls for the good-looking and vacuous Rick Rossovich playing Chris. CD assumes that Roxanne can never love a man with an outsize nose and therefore he lends his verbal skills to the inordinately shy Chris. This being a  romantic comedy there will be some confusion and some twists but romance will win all.

If there is one subtle complexity this pleasant evening's entertainment it is gal pal Shelley Duval as the not conventionally beautiful Dixie. Dixie is  was friendly and supportive and beloved by none. Love wins over looks just not always. And just in case you think this movie is about subtle complexities there is just enough physical comedy, slapstick and associated silliness to keep you in cheap laughs. Perhaps Steve Martin insisted on these last few easy giggles just in case there was not enough of his clever writing.

This is a movie for quiet relaxing evening. It is the cinematographic equivalent of a very well-made macaroni and cheese side dish - warm a little bit gooey but satisfying.",1376092800,,2124,4.802739726027397

15507,4,0767818105,"In 1987, the romantic comedy film ""ROXANNE"" starring Steve Martin and Daryl Hannah, a modern retelling of ""Cyrano de Bergerac"", was a film that received critical acclaim and has been regarded as one of the Steve Martin's best work as an actor and screenwriter.

The film was directed by Fred Schepisi (""Six Degrees of Separation"", ""Mr. Baseball"", ""Iceman"", ""The Devil's Playground"", etc.)

""ROXANNE"" is an entertaining romantic comedy with Steve Martin in the top of his game.

Featuring clever writing, wonderful acting and Steve Martin carrying this film to incredible heights through a perfect blend of romance and comedy.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

To see ""ROXANNE"" in high-definition was actually quite nice.  The location in the Pacific Northwest shows us the mountain regions surrounding the area, sunshine, blue waters.  Now in 1080p High Definition with an aspect ratio of 2:40:1, the film really does bring out the outdoor scenes and for an late 1980's film, the picture quality is actually pretty good.

The film does show its age because of the fashion (Daryl Hanna's leather boots and Fred Willard's Miami Vice fashion is so easily identifiable with the 80's) and musical styles presented and there are times that the film looks soft but for the most part, picture quality is clean.,

For a film that is over 20-years-old, you really can't go wrong with this Blu-ray release because currently,  it is the best looking transfer that you will ever find of the film.

As for audio, ""ROXANNE"" is presented in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 (English, French and Portuguese) and a Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital track.  The film is dialogue heavy and thus a lot of the film is front channel-based and there are no use for special effects or rear channels for this film, so expect to see mostly your front and center channels being utilized.  Audio is clear and well-understood and the scenes that showcase classical music was delightful to hear as well.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

Unfortunately, there are no special features included. The Blu-ray disc for ""ROXANNE"" is BD LIVE enabled.

JUDGMENT CALL:

It has been well over 20 years since I first saw ""ROXANNE"" on cable and for the most part, watching the film again, I can say that it does hold up quite well nearly 23 years later.

Steve Martin was absolutely fabulous in this film and his role as an executive producer, main actor and screenplay writer must have been quite interesting because he manages to seamlessly make this film seem smooth.  How he took the storyline of ""Cyrano De Bergerac"" and wrote his interpretations for his character was a bit humorous and entertaining.

But when it comes to Steve Martin, it's all about delivery.  Martin owned this role.

There is one scene where he is encountered by a man at the bar who wants to fight him but after losing a bet in darts, Martin's character C.D. has to come up with 20 unique nose jokes.  Martin flawlessly pulls off over two dozen and you can tell by the talent watching him at the bar as they all watch him showcase his acting style, his quick wit but smooth delivery of his lines, they were impressed.

Of course, watching Daryl Hannah in her 80's clothing and hairstyle definitely made this film feel ""80's"" but thankfully for the High Definition transfer, watching ""ROXANNE"" in 1080p High Definition was quite nice.  Seeing her blue eyes and beautiful smile definitely made her one of the popular actresses of the 1980's and both she and Martin, both look incredible now as they were 23 years ago.

And of course, the film also features a good number of talent such as the popular Shelley Duvall,  ""Top Gun"" actor Rick Rossovich, Fred Willard, John Kapelos and emerging stars Damon Wayans and Kevin Nealon.

With a lot of positive to say about the film, the negative would be the lack of any bonus features.  Granted, this film is an older film but it would have been nice to see Steve Martin, Daryl Hannah or even director Fred Schepisi make some sort of comment.

And for a comedy film, there has to be a gag reel or something that could have been thrown in.  Not even the theatrical trailer was included and that is my only problem with this release.. the lack of any special features but the trailers for other films.

Overall, you can't fault the film because it's an entertaining romantic comedy that continues to stand the test of time and now it's available on Blu-ray ala High Def.  If you are a Steve Martin fan, ""ROXANNE"" is a film that deserves to be in your collection.  It's one of his best films (next to my favorite feat. Steve Martin, 1991's `L.A. Story') and definitely a film worth checking out!",1241568000,25,4612,4.7452948557089085

15527,3,0767818105,"Moderately paced jazz is the music of love for the romantic comedy Roxanne, based loosely on the famous Edmond Rostand play Cyrano de Bergerac. The story itself is a timeless tale of love hindered by a colossally appalling facial feature, but screenwriter Steve Martin shakes things up a bit with generous amounts of whimsical comedy. At times it's too much, going almost as over-the-top as his Pink Panther films, themselves merely a vehicle for a one-laugh Frenchman impression. In Roxanne, he seems to channel the overacting of Jim Carrey, taking the already unbelievably Pinnochio-faced lead character in a direction of total poppycock. Unfortunately most of the humor falls flat.

Charles D. Bales (Steve Martin) is a fire chief in the small town of Nelson and a hopeless romantic, poetic and kind, but plagued by an inescapably large nose. When he meets Roxanne Kowalski (Daryl Hannah), a stunningly beautiful astronomer (or so the other actors must pretend), he immediately falls in love. She's everything he could want in a woman, but she sees him only as a friend, instead infatuated with the muscular new fireman Chris McConnell (Rick Rossovich) who recently joined Charlie's team.

Although he too wishes to see more of Roxanne, Chris lacks confidence with women, and is reduced to a clumsy mess in their presence. Given the opportunity to convey his true feelings for Roxanne, Charlie agrees to write a letter to her for Chris. When his lyrical wordsmanship instantaneously seduces Roxanne, Charlie finds himself continuing to woo her for the benefit of his competition. But how can she love him for who he is when he has such a hideously humongous nose?

Where Cyrano fought with a sword, Charlie fights with a tennis racket against golf clubs. Although he commands an incredibly inept anti-Backdraft fire department, he excels at physical and verbal jousting, the former contributing to much of the cheesiness of the plot, while the latter accounts for the few genuine laughs. Oddly enough, the explanation for why Charlie won't simply get a nose job is more believable than his noble intentions for continuing to sweep his dream girl off her feet and into the arms of a scatterbrained hunk. Roxanne tragically and carelessly teeters on the border of harmless romantic comedy and eye-gouging filmic nonsense, making it less than appealing for viewers not infatuated with Martin's brand of comedy. Longtime fans, however, may see this film as a highlight.

The best romantic comedy for some, one of the best comedies of the 80's for others. Great story, incredible performance of steve martin , great production and artistic direction by Fred Schepisi. We can argue with that of course, but one thing beyond discussion, is that this Sony Pictures 2002 DVD edition for this masterpiece is so awful, that it manages to destroy the experience.

I had to put up with a VHS edition for 15 years, for what! This? I can say without any doubt, that this is one of the worst DVD editions i own, behind my Asian bootleg martial arts copies. Absolutely awful, this edition manages to restrain the impact of the movie with all the worst features of the fullscreen edition: Extreme close-ups, alternate or moving angles from the same take, chopped off characters from the scenes, people talking to shoulders and corners, people talking from outside the picture, missing scenarios and landscapes, blurry video quality... my god! Not even the 5.1 english soundtrack could emerge, not even the movie could! Extras? The movie trailer...In widescreen! It was torture.

By far, the worst 7 dollars i have ever spent, and a disapointment i'm never gonna forget.

My recomendation for fans looking for this wonderful movie in DVD: Go outside the store and get the widescreen edition, online or on local stores. I'm desperatly seeking for other better editions, i'm even willing to download it, or even buy a bootleg.

Whatever you do: Please, please, don't buy this awful Sony 2002 fullscreen edition.

Martin modernizes the Cyrano deBergerac story with wonderful comic touches: A ""sword"" duel with tennis rackets & ski equipment; Martin contending with a hopelessly inept fire crew; a show-stopping bar scene in which Martin cuts a bullying lout down to size with a ""nose joke marathon""; and Martin coaching a bumbling Rossovich on how to romance Hannah. Yet, Martin wisely retains the heart of deBergerac's original themes: Believing in oneself and the delirious intoxication of being in love.

15546,5,0767818105,"""Roxanne,"" a 1987 film written by, and starring, the comic genius Steve Martin is yet another film from the fertile 1980's that more people should be happy to know.  It's based on the 100-year old French play ""Cyrano de Bergerac,"" by Edmond Rostand. And it costars the long-legged blonde Daryl Hannah, makes good use of Shelley Duvall, Fred Willard, and Michael J. Pollard in supporting roles, was directed by the talented Australian Fred Schepisi. It's set, supposedly, in a pretty Oregon skiing town; actually filmed in a pretty Canadian town; the cinematography presents us with many green and charming vistas.

Its plot follows the original.  C.D.(Charlie) Bales (Martin), (note he's got the same initials as the original), is the intelligent, engaging fire chief of the small town; he's got quite a lot going for him, but also, unfortunately, an extremely prominent nose.  But he's getting alone fine until astronomy student Roxanne (Hannah) comes to town on a cheap summer sublet.  She falls for one of Bales's employees, dumb but handsome Chris (Rick Rossovich) in a big way; but, fortunately, she doesn't really go for dumb.  Her friend Dixie (Duvall), tells her she wants Chris's looks with Charlie's brains.  And, for a while, that's what she gets, as Charlie writes Chris's love letters and dictates his dialogue.

Many critics have lauded Martin's extraordinary gift for physical comedy, but you've got to see it to believe it.  He opens the movie with an energetic strut across town, then has a wonderfully choreographed fight with two rude young male tourists: his tennis racket against their ski poles.  He also spends a lot of time climbing up and around houses and trees; and falls down from a tree, claiming he was abducted by aliens, as per a puzzling scene in the original play.  The movie also gets a gratifying amount of mileage out of  Charlie's fire department: there aren't too many movies that give the viewer any feel for what a character supposedly does to make a living.  One criticism: Dixie is not as young or beautiful as Roxanne, but does that mean she had to be turned into an asexual auntie type? Oh well.  Romantic comedies don't come much better than this.",1181088000,5,2193,4.907859078590786
15547,4,0767818105,"Steve Martin earned & deserved an Academy Award for ""Roxanne"", but Hollywood doesn't give Oscar to Comedians.  At least he got nominated for a Glob(e).  One of the great things about this movie is that there is no ""bad guy"" - you don't have to root for someone to go down in order for the hero to prevail.

The score is a tad dated.  It would be great if it could someday be redone.. the same music, different instruments.  Ditch the cheesy 1980's synthesizer and sax.  Steve Martin is a tremendous bluegrass fan:  How about the same music, played on bluegrass instruments?",1180483200,2,573,4.5588235294117645
15548,5,0767818105,"Steve Martin's LA Story and the remarkable Roxanne have to be the two best films from his huge body of work.

Having penned the screenplay, Martin cleverly adapts the Cyrano De Bergerac tale to a modern setting, however, manages to maintain the original story line and large personality of Cyrano in the character of C.D. Bales, a fire chief of a beautiful small town in the mountains of British Colombia.

C.D. Bales is an educated, romantic and modern swashbuckling man who can street fight and win with style, possess a sharp wit, can swing and climb rooftops with the agility of a cat and write poetry and love letters that will make any woman swoon with delight. Unfortunately, Bales like De Bergerac, has a nose the size of a small tree, resulting in his shyness in the matters of love.

C.D. falls head over heels for Roxanne, a visiting astronomer with alluring beauty and a keen mind but feels his appearance, a nose the size of Kansas, will prevent any relationship.

A handsome man, Chris, (Rick Rossovich) joins the fire station to help train the volunteer crew of town misfits but cannot talk to women. Bales' woos Roxanne through Chris with love letters and poetry, thus Chris wins her heart. This unusual situation turns complicated, (similar to De Bergerac) when the masquerade starts to come undone to hilarious results.

Australian director, Fred Schepisi, brings Martin's adaptation of De Bergerac together in an entertaining modern romantic comedy that even today, despite the dated soundtrack, continues to be funny.

Some movies deserve only to be seen once though Roxanne can be pulled from the cabinet and viewed time and again as it remains a classic tale of the 80's & the 18th century.",1175385600,10,1712,4.865979381443299

15555,5,0767818105,"C.D. Bales (Steve Martin) is an erudite small-town fire chief, who is cursed with an abnormally huge nose. He doesn't gladly suffer fools who make the mistake of commenting on his proboscis. One evening, he meets the beautiful, naked astronomer Roxanne (Daryl Hannah), who has been locked out of her house and bathrobe. C.D. falls in love and Roxanne falls into feelings of friendship.  The sexy, sarcastic stargazer, instead, has a crush on new hunky firefighter Chris (Rick Rossovich). It turns out that Chris is also interested but becomes very nervous in her presence. He turns to C.D., who reluctantly helps him woo the girl of both their dreams. C.D. composes an intoxicating, soulful love letter, which  enables Chris to win the girl. But how long can C.D. keep a rein on his true feelings for Roxanne? The original Cyrano de Bergerac, which this movie is based on, doesn't end on a happy note. Will this version?

Yes, this is my favorite Steve Martin film of all time (a close second being L.A. Story). It's romantic, thoughtful, clever and hilarious, with probably one of the better portrayals of unrequited love I've seen in pictures. The bar scene, where C.D. faces down an insulting drunk, is an instant classic. Another gem is C.D, in his guise as Chris, courting Roxanne beneath her window. Martin, who wrote the screenplay, is charming and earnest and puts his heart and soul in C.D. Bales; he makes you root wholeheartedly for him. Lovely Daryl Hannah has never been better or looked more ravishing, in her embodiment of the sexy, intelligent Roxanne Kowalski. Rick Rossovich is so good as the clueless, dimwitted Chris that I don't know if he'll ever be able to live the role down.

Roxanne is a sweet little movie, replete with exquisite physical comedy and heady wit, with a great cast of supporting characters (Shelley Duvall, John Kapelos, Michael J. Pollard, etc). Part of the movie's charm is the way it mines the hapless volunteer firefighters' ineptness for goodnatured, slapstick  humor. Roxanne incorporates its storyline seamlessly into the charming small town backdrop, lending a quaint, more intimate feel to the picture. If you haven't seen this one yet, do yourself a favor, and I promise: your heart will ache and maybe even break, but in a good way.",1152403200,2,2284,4.9067357512953365

After the fantastic extras on the When Harry Met Sally DVD, I was hoping somebody would get Steve and Co. together and create a behind the scenes documentary for Roxanne. Maybe one day. It deserves it.

This classic was filmed almost entirely in Nelson, BC, and was supposed to be Nelson, WA, an hour or so south of its Canadian equivalent. It's hard to pick out some of the locations as the camera angles virtually all compensate for the fact that Nelson (an Aspen-like town in the BC interior) is very hilly. Where the mighty John Kapelos (Chuck) tries his Playmate of the Month routine on the foxy Caroline Barclay, it looks like a level street, but Ward St. is actually on a hill, like most of Nelson.

I actually agree with some other reviewers that it's hard to believe that an intelligent and sensitive man like C. D. would fall for a shallow, sarcastic smarty pants like Darryl Hannah's Roxanne, when he obviously had major chemistry with the beautiful, sexy, funny, highly intelligent Dixie, played by the divine Shelley Duvall. Maybe Shelly was just too hot for character.

Still, Life doesn't always make sense.

This is a truly hilarious movie and Rick (Top Gun) Rossovich excels as Chris, the hunky Pro firefighter. This guy is a very underrated actor, believe me.

Martin, the self-assured, passionate but ugly (that schnoz) chief and Rossovich, the dumb but handsome hunk both fall for Hannah; of course Hannah is interested in the hunk.

15568,5,0767818105,"""Roxanne"" is one of the old-fashioned, yet wonderfully watchable comedies that comes around only once in great while.  Despite some harsh language at times, this is the perfect movie for those over 14.

Steve Martin plays the C.D. Bales, the local fire chief who probably would've found happyness a long time ago if it weren't for his huge nose (or rather, his self consciousness about his huge nose).  Along comes Roxanne, played nicely by Daryl Hannah, who has come to town with her telescope to spot a comet she's thinks she's discovered.  Of course, C.D. falls head over heels for her, but her attentions are drawn to the new fireman Chris, played by Rick Rossovich (Hmm, I wonder whatever happened to him? He's probably in the same boat as ""Sixteen Candles"" star Michael Schoeffling).

""Roxanne"" elevates itself above routine fare with an excellent supporting cast, including Shelly Duvall in the odd role of C.D.'s best friend (according to the film, their characters aren't related, so have they dated in the past?), Michael J. Pollard as the nerdy, but very funny fireman Andy, who should never be challenged in a boxing match.  And most especially Fred Willard as the over-the-top mayor.  He has the best single line in the film when, after a major event takes place (I won't give that away), he toasts the crowd by saying, ""I'd rather be with the people here tonight, than with the finest people on the planet!"".  A drop dead funny line.

Also look for a young Damon Wayans as one of the firemen.

Highlights of the movie include the famous ""20 worse things you can say about C.D.'s nose"" (if you keep count, it's actually 25?!), Chris's constant attempts to overcome his shyness about meeting Roxanne, the confrontation of C.D. and two drunk skiers (one of them played by SNL's Kevin Nealon), and any scene with Michael J. Pollard.

This is a warm, wonderful film full of laughs and great character bits.  I heartily recommend it to all who want a break from today's gross-out comedies.

Notes: I wonder just how drunk the skiers were at the beginning of the film.  They're carrying ski gear, but it's clearly summertime (the leaves are green and not one snowflake to be found).

Also, Daryl Hannah is the best looking astronomer I've ever seen.",1096848000,,2256,4.778350515463917
15579,5,0767818105,"This 1987 film is another brilliant collaboration between Carl Reiner and Stever Martin: bringing us a more jovial interpretation of Edmond Rostand's famous play, 'Cyrano de Bergerac.'

The theme and plot is pretty much the same as the original except with a comic twist instead of a tragic one.  Steve Martin is C.D. Barnes, the captain of a voluntary fire station at a ski resort.  As with the original Cyrano, C.D. is a sensual and vocally articulate man who feels that his monstrous nose is always in the way of love.  He soon falls in love with the beautiful Roxanne (Daryl Hannah), an astronomer who just arrived to the town to chart the stars, but can't get himself to act.  Finding out that Roxanne has the hots for a clueless hunk in his fire station (Rick Rossovich), C.D. acts as the brains and mouthpiece while the hunk acts as the sexy model.  Things get hot but somethings just don't add up in Roxanne's mind.  The truth is soon unfolded and resolves itself in a happy ending for everyone.

Another great work by Reiner and Martin whose comedies always touch the audience with revealing insight and wit.  A fun movie for all ages and genders.",1091664000,,1156,4.627450980392157

I was forced into renting it because we had to do this Cyrano de Bergerac/Roxanne compare/contrast sheet for French.  I am unhappy that I had to shell out three bucks to rent a movie I never even really wanted to see.  The fact that it was a bad movie didn't help the situation.
Steve Martin may think he's being clever, but really he isn't.  I absolutely hated his charcter, who, despite his big nose, was awfully cocky.  Now, I wasn't a huge fan of the real Cyrano de Bergerac, so that MAY be part of the problem.  Nevertheless, the plot made me roll my eyes and every bit of the movie bored me to tears.

15582,5,0767818105,"Of recent updatings of CYRANO DE BERGERAC, this one is one of the best, and is certainly the funniest.  Although THE TRUTH ABOUT CATS AND DOGS has a soft spot in my heart, this version is by far funnier and more romantic.  The other film focuses more on Janeane Garofalo's feelings of inferiority compared to Uma Thurman, and although funny, doesn't strive for the laughs like Roxanne does.  Also, with apologies to Ben Chaplin, he is hardly as adorable as Daryl Hannah.  She has never been lovelier than in this film.
This is also probably my favorite Steve Martin film.  Despite his surreal schnoggin, he manages to inject his character with warmth, character, and lovability.  You like him so much that you find it believable when he and Roxanne end up together at the end.  (Interestingly, both this and the Janeane Garofalo film end happily, unlike the Rostand play.)  The long scene in which a bar patron insults his nose, and he humiliates the man by coming up with 20 better and vastly funnier insults (this ""Cyrano"" is not merely a highly capable street fighter, but equally adept at verbal sparring) is easily the highpoint of the film.  Even if I have seen the film recently, if in channel flipping I see the movie playing and that it hasn't reached this part of the film, I will wait and watch it.
One reviewer below mentioned the town being dull.  I cannot agree.  I think the physical beauty of the place stuns most viewers.  If I knew I could find a job there, I'd move there tomorrow.  The locale definitely adds measurably to the enjoyment of the film.
I have only two negative comments to make on the movie.  First, I think they overdid it on Steve Martin's nose.  It is impossible to imagine that anyone with a nose that long would not have had surgery on it, and there isn't any believable medical reason to believe the surgery couldn't be performed.  Second, the musical soundtrack really sounds dated.  The Kenny G. sound today just hasn't stood the test of time, so that the soundtrack reminds one more of elevator music or at best ""Lite FM"" than anything.
Still, if one can get past the music, this remains one of the most enjoyable romantic comedies of recent years.",1068854400,6,2191,4.62015503875969

C.D.'s soliloquoy under Rozanne's window is easily the sexiest, most romantic scene I've ever seen in a movie, and he set the standard for my own definition of the perfect lover. There are many ""morals"" about love and friendship that inform this story, but the ""medicine"" goes down with sparkling class and flawless humor. I fell head over heels in love with C.D.

15586,5,0767818105,"Near the end of Edmund Rostand's play ""Cyrano de Bergerac"" the character of Roxanne encapsulates the heart of the tragic romance when she says, ""I have loved one man in my live, and I have lost him twice.""  Ultimately, it is not Steve Martin's comic sensibilities but rather his sense of romance that makes this 1987 film a worthy counterpart to Rostand's original play.
In this new version of the tale Cyrano becomes C. D. ""Charlie"" Bales (Martin), a fire chief in a Colorado town who has a nose of epic proportions and no prospects in his love life.  But then who should come into town but,the fair Roxanne, (Daryl Hannah), who has rented a house to check out comets with her telescope.  He is totally smitten by her, but she only has eyes for Chris (Rick Rossovich), who is everything Charlie is not, to wit: handsome, stupid and lacking any social charm whatsoever.  Of course the centerpiece of the film is Martin's take on the famous balcony scene, where Charlie feeds Chris the lines with which to woo Roxanne, but that is not where this film finds its heart.
That is because Charlie is the heart and soul of this quirky little town, where the only one who thinks anything about Charlie's nose is Charlie himself.  Shelley Duvall as Dixie heads the supporting cast of well beloved but obviously quirky character actors, which includes Fred Willard and Michael J. Pollard.  At the end of Rostrand's classic play you believe that Roxanne would have chosen the soul of the poet over the face of the angel.  Several centuries later Martin gives her the chance to make the right choice (and I do not mean about wearing that red dress tonight).  More impressively, Martin proves once and for all that he can be even funnier when he is not being ""a wild and crazy guy""; such is the difference between a comedian and a comic actor.

Although the DVD itself is not that cool (no such special features as commentaries, cast & crew bios, production notes etc...), it deserves as cherished a place in my library as the place ""Roxanne"" settled in my heart. For the two last decades Hollywood had some rising stars in the category of physical comedy (Ben Stiller, Adam Sandler, Jim Carrey, the Wayans brothers...) but none of them has made a movie that got me laugh so hard while capturing my heart so tenderly at the same time as Steve Martin did with ""Roxanne"". Was it because those new actors couldn't work out something creative like ""the 20 nose jokes"", or was it because they just needed better scripts to bolster their talents? I found it amazing that Steve Martin decided to be the screenplay writer himself and somehow managed to convert the concept of a French Renaissance play -- ""Cyrano de Bergerac"" -- to this modern time comedy and turned its tragic conclusion into a happy ending. Apart from the ""nose jokes"", he gave us so many fun lines to enjoy and remember. And apart from Martin, all other actors also gave their best performances, and best lines too: Shelley Duvall's simple riddle, Daryl Hannah's ""ironic"" refusal of a coat, Rick Rossovitch's ""extemporaneous"" night and ""pillow fluffing"" request..., and, oh yeah, the ""earn more sessions by sleeving"" line...

And then two movies came to the local cinemas: ""Little Shop of Horrors"" and ""Roxanne"". Since then I am a hooked.
""Roxanne"" actually tells the story of the French Renaissance-hero Cyrano De Bergerac, but brilliantly turned into a modern romantic comedy. Steve Martin stars as C.D. Bales, the head of a small village fire department. He has quite a big handicap, or should I say: nosicap? His nose is bigger than most men's... uhm, finger. But don't feel sorry for C.D.! In the first five minutes you learn that he is charming, witty, that he can take good care of himself and that he is by no means a victim of circumstances. However, C.D. is not always sure of himself. Especially when he meets beautiful Roxanne, played by Daryl Hannah. What will win Roxanne's heart: Good looks (which C.D. isn't really blessed with) or sweet and sensual poetry?
Look for the thousands of little details and funny bits. It's a pure feel-good-movie if you ever saw one. Every cast member has his or her big moment and everyone is just simply brilliant. In my opinion ""Roxanne"" is one of the most perfect romantic comedies ever and one of Martins best performances. I don't know if Steve Martin feels that way.

Martin compounds his genius in the movie by assembling a stellar supporting cast (which includes Shelley Duvall and a young Damon Wayans) that more than holds its own throughout the film.  Pay extra special attention to the balcony scene--from its beginning to its end, Martin and Rossovich are allowed to shine their brightest.  Martin teams up for this 'Cyrano' retelling with director Fred Schepisi, the visionary behind 'Six Degrees of Separation', the movie that first separated Wil Smith from his legendary ""Fresh Prince"" persona.

This is such a good movie. Like other screenplays Steve Martin has written, it's based on a classic piece of literature.

Daryl Hannah -- sweet, gorgeous, tall, talented, unemployed? That's a shame. Her performance in this movie is the best of any of hers that I've seen. A few years later she had a cameo in ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" -- a truly great movie -- in which, alas, she had to play a stereotypical dumb blonde actress.

I had despaired of ever finding an English-language version that captured the beauty and wonderful humor of the original play, but Steve Martin does a fabulous adaptation here, in Roxanne.  He works the best elements of the play seamlessly into modern times, always staying true to the heart of the matter, while making the story accessible for today's audience.  It doesn't hurt that his performance is spot-on:  the perfect mixture of dreaminess and self-loathing, sweetness and acerbic wit.  Darryl Hannah also does a great job bringing Roxanne (previously a relatively flat character) to real life, making her a human being instead of an untouchable goddess.

15596,5,0767818105,"Possibly one of Steve Martin's finest films, I have always enjoyed this wonderful modern version of Cyrano de Bergerac. A fine cast turn in some wonderful performances. There are so many sequences in the film which I  could talk about such as the opening ""swordfight"", the balcony  scene and the most famous - the 20 things about CDB'S nose (actually 25 but  who cares?). At the end of it all its a wonderful film that you can sit  back and enjoy. If you need something to lighten the mood then this is one  of those constantly funny films.
The picture quality of this DVD is  excellent. The sound is good. The only downside would be the lack of  features. My advice would be to buy it anyway.",948585600,8,693,4.409448818897638
15597,5,0767818105,"This is a classic Steve Martin movie.  He is sooo funny, the best Steve Martin ever! My favorite scene is when C.D. (Steve) says 20 insults about his nose. I highly recommend this movie because the plot is sweet and  funny, and the characters are great!",945907200,,253,4.478260869565218
15598,5,0767818105,"This is a fine adaptation of Edmond Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac.  I love the modern spin on the movie, because it is so perfect for our time.  The scene where C.D. Bates (Martin) talks for Rossovich's character under  Roxanne's window is my favorite.  It's such a great movie, and it's on TBS  every six months or so.  See it!  I recommend it.",939600000,2,344,4.451612903225806
