870688,4,6304326289,"Maybe I was expecting a grandiose experience, but while the movie is enjoyable it seemed to only be touching the surface of it's time and culture. If you've watched RuPaul's Drag Race you might want to watch simply for the reference regarding ""The Library is Open"" in regards to ""Reading"" someone. 'Paris Is Burning' is always used as the source of initiation. I was surprised the segment was so short in the film since it seemed to be a major sticking point to RuPaul.

However, you should watch this documentary simply for it's subject matter regarding the ball circuits of the 1980's (they began prior) and some of the people and characters that took part in them. If you really want to make the experience more fascinating then I suggest doing some research on the cast after you watch the film.

The director, a white, straight woman was selective in who she choose to feature.  It gave the impression that everyone involved in the balls was unemployed or only employed so they could participate in that culture.  Having known a number of people through the years who would have been participants in activities like the balls, my friends and acquaintances were, in fact, people I knew through work.  They were in politics, in hospital work, in non-profit, or in the business community.  It was an interesting, but somewhat skewed vision of this culture.",1385510400,,703,4.857142857142857

870789,4,6304326289,"""Paris is Burning"" is a closeup of festive ""balls"" thrown by and for the gay and transgender community of 1980's New York City. The real lives documented here differ sharply from the wealthy, white, happy hair dresser, artist, or businessperson that has become the stereotypical image of the gay man in recent years (as seen on ""Will and Grace"" and elsewhere in pop culture). No, the men and women here are virtually all poor and nonwhite. All of them seem to come from broken homes, or were rejected by their families at a young age, when their true natures became apparent. Now they have banded together as families, taking on the names of more experienced parental figures who lead their respective ""houses."" Balls offer them an oasis of acceptance, where they are free to let loose, have fun, and simply be themselves.

The balls, which began years before as simple ""drag queen"" fashion shows, have since developed into many-categoried competitions. The film's presentation of these categories offers valuable anthropological insight into the ways this subculture has adapted. One category, ""Voguing,"" is part break dance, part runway modeling. This is a clear example of conflict avoidance; members of different houses (which are compared to gangs by an interviewee, and apparently don't always get along) utilize voguing as an alternative to physically fighting. Instead contestants strut, show off, and mock each other wordlessly, while ball judges stress that the penalty for touching is disqualification. Other categories reflect the futile desires of the contestants, with titles containing words like ""opulence,"" ""executive,"" and even ""military."" One is titled ""Going to School,"" for which a contestant walks out wearing a Yale University shirt. The most poignant and telling categories are probably those pertaining to ""realness."" In this context, the word ironically refers to the ability to convincingly appear to be a straight man or woman. An interviewee makes it clear this category isn't a game, but an important means of getting by. These men and women feel lucky just to make it across town without being beaten, and ""realness"" is an important survival strategy for them.

""Paris is Burning"" also offers some important sociological lessons about the detrimental effects of marginalizing a group of people--not only to that group, but to society as a whole. Unable to find work, many in this community have turned to prostitution. (Keep in mind the state of AIDS in America at the time, and its prevalence among black, gay men.) Many of these people, expressing feelings of being cheated out of success and sidelined by the larger society, seem to have no qualms about shoplifting clothing or walking out on a restaurant tab. Theft, in fact, seems to be a universal joke in this community.

The most moving parts of the film are the intimate interviews with a representative handful of individuals in the community. The sad, impoverished day-to-day lives of these gay and trans people contrast starkly with the glitz and glamor of the balls. Despite all their talk of wanting fame and fortune, in the end it is made clear that what they really desire is a normal life and a chance to be themselves. My only significant complaint with this documentary is that I would have liked more of these interviews in lieu of the overabundance of catwalk footage from the balls, which I found wearisome at times.

The phrase ""time capsule"" comes up in discussions of this film, which I feel is appropriate. The seedy New York presented here doesn't exist anymore. Sadly, neither do most of these people--lost to disease and violence. ""Paris is Burning"" is an important reminder of a tragic reality of what once was, even if it takes place not too long ago. It is also, unfortunately, probably what little remains of the memory of these ""legendary children.""",1378339200,,3864,5.061224489795919

For every person out there who becomes a brand name success, there must be a couple of thousand who are just as skilled & talented who never, for whatever reason(s) make the right connections @ just the right time. The thing is, you can be a living legend in your own community, and that is an important lesson this teaches, in addition to the mentoring that is offered to runaway youths who have been rejected by their biological families.

This is a social documentary where black, Latino gay culture can literally peacock around on stage.  These are a highly creative bunch of people with nerve, charisma, talent and balls to live their live as it should be. This documentary references the old-style drag compared to new style, 1989's drag.  To see how these kids/young adults dreamed of fame and fashion is truly inspirational even for the straight audience, such as myself.

One of the biggest influences and thanks to the directors given props is the VOGUE scene.  This is where Madonna and many other hot artists at the time, borrowed from this underground culture, making it mainstream.

I found it sad, not because of their life style, but that they all want to be famous (Their names ""household words"")and rich, but don't appear to have any way of achieving their goals. Many lack education and job skills and perceive winning trophies for their often outrageous demeanor and modes of dress as a sign of great achievement.

871060,5,6304326289,"I had been familiar with Paris is Burning, since the early 1990s. My introduction to Voguing (a style of modern house dancing, done by many members of the gay community, as a form of self expression) was when Madonna recorded the song ""Vogue,"" and worked with Willi Ninja to choreograph her music video. Ninja is featured in this film, along with many other prominent dancers, who give us an authentic perspective on, not only, the art of Voguing, but the gay experience, lived by African American and Latino men in 1980s New York. Willi was part of one of the Vogue Houses. He was the Mother of the House of Ninja. Status was determined by whether you can Vogue or ""walk"" the ballroom floor and win a prize for doing so (involving flamboyant, stylized moves, based on day-to-day tasks like applying make up with a compact). The Houses are like families, but, when paired against another house, it becomes a battle similar to gang turf, and, for me, reminiscent of break dancing battles, in the 1970s and 1980s. This is often the time where dancers who may be living at or below the poverty line, can live out their ultimate fantasy - be it in a three piece suit, a college sweater, or as a glamor queen. Participants beg, borrow, steal, or sew to make this possible.

I appreciate the broad humor, the eloquence of the subjects, and hearing their stories - some of which are pretty heart wrenching. There are candid interviews with drag queens and Mothers like Pepper LeBeija, and aging performers, like Dorian Carey. We also get to know members of the houses, who sometimes must resort to hustling, like Venus Xtraveganza. These interviews were recorded at a time where reassignment surgeries (male-to-female/female-to-male) were not something as openly discussed in the media, as they are today. Some subjects seek that final ""piece"" in their lives to feel like a complete woman, while others are content to remain biologically male, but enjoy wearing women's clothing and performing in the ballroom. There are frank discussions about sex, homosexuality, heterosexuality, street life and personal anecdotes about survival. This is just a beautifully done film, and a very important part of history.",1348099200,,2201,4.932614555256064

Though it follows a demographic that was incredibly marginalized, stigmatized and ostracized, there is a story in here for everyone. And if you are queer, you should know how instrumental this film was and still is in shaping the broader scope of our community.

I never saw this seminal movie until a decade after it was released but upon watching it I was struck by how apparent it was in influencing the gay culture I knew all the way in Hawai'i! This is incredible when you consider the fact that this is a documentary about a scene that was by and large a Latino and Black community of gay people who lived in the inner city of New York.

There is just so much to be experienced in Paris is Burning. It is at once a nihilistic romance and an exquisite tragedy. A story about the creativity that was born out of necessity in a culture where consumerism, racism and homophobia were at odds with the fiber of their identities. It is about the art of those whose chips were stacked tremendously against them yet find, through inner-strength and indomitable character, a world of fantastical expression and inspiring competition.

This movie is infinitely quotable and so very close to my heart. A movie so funny, heartbreaking, heroic, insightful, and yes, fierce, that I have no doubt it will transcend through the ages long after our generation has passed on.

""Paris is Burning"" is not a documentary about homo-sexual culture. ""Paris is Burning"" is not a documentary about African-American and Latino homo-sexual culture. ""Paris is Burning"" is a documentary about the ""House""/""Ball"" scene subculture of the African-American and Latino homosexual subculture.

This documentary is a great watch filled with candor, humor, and humanity of a disenfranchised culture desperately yearning the acceptance and love it's been denied. The camera's lens is an unblinking eye looking beyond the status-obsessed ballroom competitions to reveal a wounded insecure soul begging for affirmation of love, acceptance, and security.

Although ""realness"" is lauded in high regard in the ""balls"", the candid talking heads seem uncomfortable speaking in detail about the reality of prostitution, stealing, and HIV/AIDS.

""Paris is Burning"" is filmed in glorious cinematography. In direct contrast it the barely viewable ""deleted scenes."" It is very disconcerting to view all of the HIV/AIDS dialogue that director Jennie Livingston edited out of the film.
It is also quite revealing of director Livingston's angle when the deleted scenes contrast Caucasians being activists in the light against African-American and Latino acting frivolous in the night.

Paris Is Burning was far better than I expected it to be; I couldn't take my eyes off the screen! This is an excellent portrait of the minority (mostly black and Hispanic) drag queen community as it existed in New York City in the late 1980s. Watching this film you will discover how these people related to each other in all sorts of ways and how they handled their relationships not only amongst themselves but with their families and the straight, white world in general that wasn't exactly too accepting of them then and still has a ways to go toward true acceptance in our times.

The footage of the ""balls"" these gay drag queens hold is fantastic. A ball is easily explained--the minority drag queens gather in a social hall and essentially take turns walking down the middle of the social hall as if they were rich and famous models walking down the runway. They get to be and feel the way they REALLY feel inside; and their peers cheer them on as they walk the walk. They get ratings by judges and prizes are often awarded. Of course, things get more complicated; not everybody is in love with everybody else. We learn how these gay men including the drag queens take each other on with wisecracks about their appearances; and the footage of them voguing shows us great dancing as well as a competition to determine who's the better man.

There's also the concept of ""houses;"" these are the gay male/drag queen equivalent of street gangs. There is a leader of the house (or, group) called the ""mother;"" and the house has its rules as to how someone can become a member--perhaps, for example, they have to walk down that runway at a ball and snag a prize to become a house member. We also learn what it means to ""mop;"" and the footage with Dorian Corey reminiscing about the way things used to be when he was younger is fascinating.

These men don't have it easy; one of them says that being black, male and gay gives them three strikes against them before life even starts! It's sad but that's the way things went; I would like to think things have improved somewhat with the election of an African-American president but I'm sure the members of this community still experience unfair prejudice. The film has lots of commentary from many members of the gay male and drag queen community who give us a good amount of insight as to how they cope with the social stress they must face and I liked that a great deal.

The DVD comes with outtakes; and there's an optional running commentary as well.

Paris Is Burning is an outstanding motion picture for anyone who wants to know what really went on in the minority drag queen/gay male community not so long ago. This film is quite well done and it deserves more recognition that it gets.",1255651200,,2753,4.540322580645161

871182,5,6304326289,"Society is a trickster. She tells everyone that you have hope, possibility, and choice; participate in the American dream, all you need to do is work hard, believe, and it will happen. However, while society sets that up as a possibility, there are also barriers and impediments that prevent that from happening. A part of society yet apart from society, people will strive to find their identity, their place, their sense of belonging. Thus sets up the premise of the revolutionary documentary ""Paris is Burning"".

Set in New York City in the 1980's, ""Paris is Burning"" sets up a fascinating alternative society in which people gather all night long in a ""ball"", perform and strut their presence in different categories to receive trophies claiming their brilliance. Noveau filmmaker Jennie Livingston met some dancers in Washington Square park ""voguing"" (pre-Madonna days), and asked to photograph them for a film school project. Soon, she became enveloped into this entirely magical world full of gender redefining people, and was able to examine the role of race, privilege, and the AIDS crisis in society.

What impressed me about this film is how much, when people are denied their place in society, they will find their own ways to find their significance and belonging. When granted naturally to a group of people without having done a thing to earn that significance (by virtue of their accepted skin color or wealth), this film could be seen as much too odd or alternative; shocking even. However, people strive for dignity; and when marginalized by media, race rules, societal rules, will find ways to achieve that dignity; hence the balls.

It's a marvelous look inside this community, which must have completely trusted this white girl coming into it, to open up and show all of the aspects of this culture. Most of the performers in the movie have since died, a community which was wracked hard by the AIDS crisis.

The movie is a time capsule of a certain time in a certain place with a particular and peculiar group of gay men and their hangers-on who primped and pranced for their own ideas of glamour and class and who are sometimes outrageous and unreal in their comments on society and the straight AND gay world of NYC.

Some of the performers came to a very sad and grissly deaths and it is a comment on society that those with so little and tried to get and give so much of their very limited means came to sometimes very sticky demises.

There is so much young life and potential wasted in these voguing balls that one can only hope that the phenomenon has been relegated to the pages of history.

The actors/performers/drag artists-artistes are sometimes extremely funny and trenchant in what they have to say and it is a movie that is sometimes hard to watch and at other times an absolute ""hoot"".

There's a remarkable transformative moment around two thirds of the way through where a pretty young transsexual, Octavia, attends a modelling competition in a white suburban shopping mall and as we, the viewers, are confronted by a sea of white, straight, comfortably-off faces we find ourselves wondering, 'Well, what do these people do?  They don't walk in balls.  They don't compete in categories.  What do they have in their lives?'  At that moment one is - or I was - totally caught up in the world view of the participants in Paris is Burning.  It's strange to rewatch now what was then a contemporary piece,  and which gave the viewer a portrait of the world of voguing before Madonna opened it up to the great white suburbs, but it's still one of the most vividly human films I've ever seen.

The dvd features a clean wide-screen print, deleted and extended scenes, and a commentary track.  The extra scenes are mostly interesting.  There's a whole strand on the religious beliefs of the leading participants, and how they view their sexuality in light of those beliefs.  There's brief footage of Willie Ninja's (wheelchair-bound) mother attending a ball - particularly interesting in light of bell hooks' critique of the film, where she observes that it tends to downplay biological family connections.  Only a rather long sequence of a peace festival seems out of place, but even that is tied into an interview with Pepper Labeija and others where war, the military, uniforms, masculinity and machismo are discussed.

After watching the deleted scenes I went straight on to listen to the commentary track, which features director Jennie Livingstone and her editor, and two of the leading characters in the film, one of whom, Willie Ninja, went on to  have success as a dancer-choreographer with Malcolm Mclaren and, of course, Madonna.  Commentaries are often flabby and dull, but this one isn't.  Everyone is to the point and the listener learns a lot, both about the business of putting the film together and about the interplay of film-maker and participants.  All four seem fond of each other and clearly enjoy reliving the times when the film was shot.  We find out who is still with us and hear the story of the  mummified body found in Dorian Corey's flat (about which I remember reading  years ago) from those who knew him.  I found particularly interesting remarks about what the ball scene is like now. ('It used to be Legends.  Now we've gone to Icons').  Commentaries can really drag but this one whisks by.

I read in a recent issue of gay monthly Attitude that there's a follow-up documentary (not by Livingstone) that one can buy mail-order on dvd, by which  means the makers hope to finance cinema distribution.

The era it was filmed in is highly obvious by the attires and clothing of everyday people on the streets, a sort of Benetton ad from my youth. Throughout the movie, I started wondering: where are these people right now? Did they reach their goals, their dreams? Are they still alive chasing, or are most of them victims of their lifestyle? A poignant, challenging, and ultimately rewarding movie that I can't wait to see on DVD.",1120953600,,870,4.64935064935065
871356,5,6304326289,"...where is the DVD? I saw this in the THEATRE when it first came out. Scary, kids, I know. I cajole all of my friends to watch it at any opportunity that presents itself.

Being a New Yorker, I am proud that Ms. Livingston's movie preserves a piece of its culture which would probably have been blown up to mythological proportions by all parties involved if it didn't exist. I remember the clubs, the balls, the houses. Very little exists today in the form that Livingston captured. Her work is sensitive, vital, vivid, and sometimes brutal.

In watching this, pay attention to race, sex and gender, music, fashion, the time period. It is all vital to grasping the true significance of life and its interpretation for the subjects of this work.

As for whatever happened to Ms. Livingston? I don't know. Wherever you are, we are waiting for the sequel!",1104710400,,854,4.68
871357,5,6304326289,"Although ""Paris is Burning"" was released almost 15 years ago, the underlying theme (behavior modification) is as relevant today as it was then. It's not at all surprising that the participants are all from minority groups. It's no wonder Black and Hispanic men participate in this form of behavior modification. It is most likely their only chance, in this society, to enjoy some form of privilege; that of a heterosexual Black or Hispanic female. For Blacks in America behavior modification is a way of life, the men in ""Paris is Burning"" show us to what extent they are willing to go to be accepted in a country that is both racist and homophobic.  Once you understand the underlying meaning of the balls you will see that the balls are much more than an outlet for drag queens to display their wares.....GEF",1104364800,,810,4.74468085106383
871358,5,6304326289,"I have seen this film several times now as it is playing on SunDance channel. I am myself a survivor of the eighties and while I am not gay I can certainly empathise with most of the people in this movie. All want all the glittery things the eighties promised us could and would be ours. Watching this film reminds me that there is a time when life was wide open. When anything we could dream was as possible as the day at hand. Many of the films characters are dead now. Aids having claimed nearly all of them. ( Another wonderful product of the eighties.) I feel much sadness for the people spotlighted in this movie. They seem so sure that the outlandish dreams they dream are actually within their grip. Fame, fortune, and everything that ever goes with it became completely illusive for them. It is a snap shot of a time when the flambouyant fashion scene in New York City still belived its own lies. A belief that spread to New York's underpriviledged. That in the end killed them all. One of the saddest movies I have ever seen.",1098057600,,1035,4.395833333333333

They shovel [bad stuff] down our throats like Spy Kids 2 and Gigli, but try to find brilliant, daring movies like Paris is Burning or Hoop Dreams on DVD - forget it. You might as well try to find Barbara Bush in a tube top on Bourbon Street. Which, now that I think about it, has an demonic sort of appeal all its own. And with that Wilma Flintstone pearl necklace of hers...what a sizzling hot look! I can hear Beelzebub cackling with delight right now.

871360,5,6304326289,"Reading many of the reviews I'm saddened to see that most people today don't know that the House scene, still is, alive and very well. The Los Angeles House scene, yes modeled from that of the NY scene, is 11 houses and strong, with many fierce, and fabulous balls to brag about baby. Although most of the categories have been modified and simplified with a lil' L.A. flava our balls hold true to where we first began.
Many of the House family members display their voguing in the L.A. hip hop club scene. However our style of voguing has changed slightly, we 'chop', 'sha-blam', and 'shut 'em down' with ol' school/new school flava. Enjoying our unity as a community, a family, and as a people. See you at the next ball.

871361,5,6304326289,"Indeed this film is about marginalization, impossible dreams, etc., but while the tragic aspect is there, the reviewer from Tokyo is right -- this film may also be one of the most uplifting ever made.  I must add, this film is actually an important visual document of classic music from the NYC ""Paradise Garage"" club era  and of that dance style known as ""Voguing"" -- like rare footage from the era of Birdland and lindy-hopping, or of breakdancing in the early 1980's, the film captures something which can only be seen to be understood.  Madonna co-opted it  but here one sees its essence, and rarely elsewhere.  It is an indispensable VISUAL and AURAL historical document.",1046649600,,676,4.843478260869565
