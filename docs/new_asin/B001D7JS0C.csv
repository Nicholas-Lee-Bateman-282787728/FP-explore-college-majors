According to the blurb about this DVD, you will be taught to apply makeup like a professional makeup artist. However, Amanda Craft didn't show how she did any contouring, concealers, or foundation. Each of the six models already has foundation applied and she only shows how she does brows, eyes, cheeks and lips.

She does give good explanations of what she's trying to achieve and there's some good close ups of her making up the eyes. The finished looks are striking and I did think the modern glamour look was beautiful and the clean fashion look could also work for every day.

You might find this DVD helpful if you want to know more about applying makeup for fashion shows or photography. I was disappointed because I wanted to learn more about contouring and applying foundation to achieve a polished look. I would have given this 5 stars if she had shown how to apply makeup from a bare face to a finished look.

Wedding Edition

Amanda Craft gives a brief overview of skin care for 4 different skin types. I like that she tells you how to make a toner for sensitive skin and a sugar exfoliant. (I've used sugar as an exfoliant before and my skin always looks much better after using it.)

She shows three wedding looks: elegant, trendy and natural. The elegant look is the only one she shows on how to do foundation and concealer but I guess once you see this, you don't need to see it again on the other 2 models. She didn't mention which brushes she was using for each application. However, if you're not familiar with the different brushes there are good close ups so you can see what she's using.

I was surprised that on the trendy look that she didn't show how to balance this model's mouth to make it appear more even. Also on the natural look, she didn't show how she did the eye shadow. It only showed her doing the eye liner, bronzer and lips. There was only a brief mention about contouring during the trendy look.

There are good tips in this DVD but if you know a lot about makeup application, then there probably won't be anything new. There were several tips she mentioned that I hadn't known so I give it 5 stars since it taught me some new techiques.

Teen Edition

I wish there had been something like this when I was a teen although this DVD isn't just for teens. This is an excellent introduction to the basics for anyone who is interested in learning to apply makeup. I was impressed at how well Amanda Craft explained what she was doing and why she was doing it. Well, most of the time, she did make a comment about Vitamin C crme which she didn't explain and she didn't discuss contouring. She also didn't mention how to determine if you have a cool or warm skin tone. I think some teenagers might not know how to do this. A quick way is to look at your wrist; if the veins show blue then you have a cool tone. If the veins look greenish, then you have a warm tone. If you're tan, ask for help from someone at a makeup counter. :) This isn't 100 percent accurate, but it will help the majority of people. If you can't be sure if your veins look blue or green, then you might have a neutral skin tone.

The skin care section is very brief and she only discusses care for normal and combination skin. I was surprised that she didn't discuss oily skin. I think going over the care of oily skin would be expected for any teenage skin care regime. She does give an interesting tip on how to get rid of a blemish. I had never heard of it before and I'm going to try it to see if it works. She also had the model with the combination skin use a clay mask all over her face. This is just my opinion, but for someone with combination skin, I would recommend a clay mask to be applied only to the T-zone area and a crme mask or a hydrating gel mask for the drier areas of the face. Now if someone had oily skin, then I'd definitely say use the clay mask all over the face and neck.

Again, if you already know a lot about makeup application, then you probably won't find this DVD helpful. I really liked this DVD and it's the best I've seen for a basic introduction to applying makeup. I'd give it more than 5 stars if I could and I think it would make a good gift for anyone who wants to start learning about makeup application.

I know I sound kind of picky but I wanted to give people an idea of what is and isn't on these DVDs. Compared to other makeup DVDs I've watched, this set is really good and it's not as expensive as the others. Like everyone else, I want value for my money and even though I was disappointed with the Fashion DVD, I don't regret buying this set. I feel it is money well spent for the new techniques I learned from the other two DVDs. I also liked Amanda Craft and thought some of her comments were amusing. And you never know, at some point, I might find I need the information from the Fashion DVD.",1252800000,5,4869,4.2678958785249455
