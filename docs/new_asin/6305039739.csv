7881565,5,6305039739,"""The Prince"" shows you how Machiavelli's dictum ""It's better to be feared than to be loved"" has survived 500 years. Billy Dee Williams' role as an advisor to an executive climbing the ladder within corporate America is dramatically instructional for the ""Have Nots"" of the world. A movie that entertains as well as educates.
