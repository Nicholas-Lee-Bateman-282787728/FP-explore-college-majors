8687927,5,B00PHD6CN4,"Comprehensive, vivid, and thorough look at an overlooked story. Watched the original airing and loved it, a history culture buff would fall in love with this and honestly any series by Henry Louis Gates",1492992000,2,202,4.970588235294118
8687928,5,B00PHD6CN4,"Black in Latin America is a good series, I've seen the documentary on PBS and it's Definitely a must have for all people of all races wordlwide trying to understand the history, culture and etc of Black Hispanics/Black Brazilians and etc in South America. For me I always knew there were Black people in Latin America(Ex. Zoe Saldana, Pele) and had a idea of their history as a Nigerian American especially with Brazil but I felt there was never a documentary series devoted to speaking about the Black people of South America. A subject to me that was long over due, and the only series I feel devoted much attention to it was Professor Gates Black in Latin America. This series gives us the differences and similarities they have with african americans when it comes to their history starting from slavery, their identity racially and culturally. As much as I like the series though, hopefully this will open the door for more documentaries of Black south Americans in more depth but with a black south american host this time to give their own perspective on the subject of race, culture, slavery, their identity and etc. When it comes to African americans series, I have heard some good things about the series but haven't watched it and felt it was a good deal to get a series talking about african americans when it comes to race, culture and their history of slavery vs. Blacks South Americans history of slavery and their culture and racial identity. Worth the money, something that should be kept for future generations to know, Loved the deal so much I bought extra copies for my family members.",1483747200,3,1605,4.735714285714286
8687929,5,B00PHD6CN4,"I had no idea there were so many black people all over South America!  This was fascinating and held my interest to the end.  As for The African Americans, I saw it on PBS and had to own it.  Both are top-notch in terms of writing and cinematography.  I highly recommend both.",1473465600,2,276,4.25
