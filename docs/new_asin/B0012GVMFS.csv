If you ever had your heart broken, you have got to own this movie. After you see it, give it to a friend who had their heart broken.

oh and it's funny too.",1237507200,,310,4.0
3089207,4,B0012GVMFS,"Mysteriously labelled a romantic comedy, this disappointed the critics who tried to see it as one. It's a fiendishly accurate depiction of the extreme positions we take over love-and-sex. Because it explodes stereotypical attitudes the film takes the form of conversation, the director/writer/actor adroitly blending the Woody Allen subject matter with His Girl Friday pacing. Each actor gets a manic stand up comic turn, each one does a good job with what they've got to deliver. It's smart, wise and funny. Best enjoyed by those who've made a relationship mistake or two and can afford to laugh at themselves. Not recommended for those looking for romantic comedies (which are often just a sentimental look at stereotypes). Here those stereotypes get their heads blown off.",1230768000,6,775,5.258064516129032
3089208,4,B0012GVMFS,"Wow - just watched it, my head is spinning!

The most FAST quick-fire dialogue ever seen in my 60 years of movie watching.

Could have been a play, no real action at all. it's 100% dialogue. and man, is it fast! fast talking, quick wit, amazing script. the characters take turns telling their story, their gripes on love and the opposite sex. first the men, then, the women. the rapid wit firing back and forth is reckless speed of headache proportions.

The ending is sweet. meaningful even. I love the Frank Sinatra song that comes on for the ending credits. watch the credits all the way thru and there are some out-takes.

Funny, entertaining, mostly true stuff on love and sex and the games people play.

Not for kids. major big swearing and discussions of sexual nature. BJs, anal, cheating, nothing held back. not for prudes.

I really liked each character. all were cast perfectly.

be good - safe sex, kids!! Gramma Sally",1211932800,8,930,4.668711656441718

3089211,4,B0012GVMFS,"I've known about this movie for some time, but had not seen it.  Some may complain about the language which is a little strong early.  However, I would argue that it is true to what may happen in real life when 5 guys and 5 girls of their lifestyles get together in an emotionally charged situation?

I agree that the cover doesn't do the movie justice...get into the movie & you'll see a well played and designed story written, directed, produced, and starred in by Mars Callahan.  The personalities were matched beautifully to the stars who played them.  It was fun to match up the male & female counterparts as they were developing!!

3089212,4,B0012GVMFS,You have to watch this one more than once just to catch all the quick punch lines. To me it is like watching an episode of something like West Wing. The dialog is fast and you have to pay attention to keep up. I enjoyed the movie and the What Love Is topic really hits home.,1208822400,2,274,3.9107142857142856

3089221,5,B0012GVMFS,"I saw a part of this move awhile back on cable and enjoyed it,eventually i was able to see the entire film and thought it was a really good one. I will say this: it is dialogue driven,if that isn't your thing then skip it however i feel that anyone who chooses to do so will be missing out. I think that although another reviewer found this film to be full of cliches about romance that it isn't many of the things discussed are spot on,just my opinion yours obviously varies,there are things spoken between a group of friends in this film about relationships that i can personally relate to from past experiences and i think that other people who see it will be able to relate as well,i will end in saying that this film is Funny,Touching,Truthful and Witty and i recommend it to those who haven't seen it.",1393718400,2,807,4.386666666666667

3089225,5,B0012GVMFS,"It's Valentines Day evening.  Cuba intends to propose to his girl this evening so he invites some friends over to share the experience, only to get a ""Dear John"" letter when he arrives home.  When the guys arrive, woman bashing begins and then the women arrive, invited by the guys.  Their discussion in the bathroom is enlightening.  But after all of the angry words of pain, all of the advice, in the end, he gets it;  Cuba finally realizes what love is.  I enjoy the dialogue in this film; it has much truth in it -- much wisdom.  The character Sal is freshly wounded and finds a kindred soul.  He could use a larger vocabulary.  He drives much of the dialogue.

This lacks guns, chase scenes, and drugs, but it has lots of use of the f-bomb and lots of insight.",1375574400,2,765,4.361702127659575
3089226,4,B0012GVMFS,"This movie is excellent in the dynamic of how it plays out.  Cuba Gooding goes home to propose to his longtime girlfriend only to get 'dear john'ed by her.  The story then goes from the male perspective when his friends come over.. and its up-to-date on the modern dating scene.  Afterwards, you get the perspective from the females view, when the girls drop in and then complain about the guys.  Then you see how the two sexes mix and mingle.  My favorite character in here is the married guy that just comes down for a martini, and calls B.S when he sees it from whats being said.  Great movie, and makes you think about modern day dating scene.",1373846400,2,647,4.440677966101695

3089228,2,B0012GVMFS,"Tom (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) arrives home all eager to celebrate Valentine's Day with his girlfriend Sara.  He even plans on asking Sara to marry him and has gathered four of his closest buddies to witness the occasion.  Much to his dismay, however, he discovers upon entering the house that Sara has packed her bags and left him a Dear John letter, effectively putting an end to Tom's vision of eternal marital bliss.  Further complicating the issue is the fact that one of Tom's friends, mistakenly believing he's going to a party, has invited a bunch of hot young ladies from his bar to join in the festivities.

You could be forgiven for assuming that ""What Love Is"" began life as a theatrical work, since writer/director Mars Callahan has filmed it in the form usually reserved for stage-to-screen adaptations.  It all takes place on a single set, with the characters declaiming at one another in that histrionic way that stage actors alone are won't to do.  The result is an inert, talky, claustrophobic work riddled with heightened dialogue, pseudo-profundities, long-winded speechifying and manic performances.  Each character is given his moment in the spotlight - whereupon he proceeds to air his grievances concerning women, gays, straights and each other - then hands the microphone off to the next person, who pretty much does the same.

Then we get the distaff view of things, as the ladies who arrive for the party barricade themselves in the restroom to discuss at exhausting length the outrageousness and inadequacies of men.

Finally, it all comes down to the mixing of the sexes as the party moves into high gear and the characters engage in verbal jousting about the problems and pitfalls of romantic relationships.

The movie indulges in any number of requisite stereotypes, ranging from the loudmouthed, homophobic misogynist to the lisping, swishing homosexual (played by Callahan himself) and just about everything in between.

In the final analysis, a game cast - which includes Matthew Lillard, Sean Astin and Anne Heche, among others - is let down by inferior filmmaking and material.",1323648000,,2106,5.057803468208093

3089231,5,B0012GVMFS,"If I had to live on a deserted island with only ten movies to watch the rest of my life, ""What Love Is"" would be one of them.  I LOVE this movie. The dialogue and delivery is Red Bull fed intellect!  It views like a stage play, and in no way is it a romantic comedy: it is a relationship reality show with a script.

My wife HATES the movie!  The dialogue lays completely bare exactly what we all know about relationships but are afraid to admit.  It strikes so close to the pain and uncertainty of many relationships, the shredding of one's heart, because it absolutely exposes the motivations and responses we've all experienced, but does so with humor, a cheeked tongue, and intellectual passion.  Inspite of all the laughs you might feel the pins pricking your heart strings.

If you crave understanding relationships in general, especially new relationships, watch this uninhibited movie and absorb the raw truth and wisdom, complete with the F-bombs and sexual descriptions.  But, if relationships live in your scary or insecurity closet, avoid ""What Love Is"" like an STD because it will infect you with the pain of truth.",1295568000,3,1128,4.748717948717949
