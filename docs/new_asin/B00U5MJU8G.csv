7029226,1,B00U5MJU8G,"We saw the great reviews and couldn't wait to pop this into to player. We were disappointed. The acting was poor; there was little to no background music throughout, which leaves it feeling flat; and the story line was rather slow. Overall very dissatisfied.",1439596800,2,258,4.886363636363637
7029227,4,B00U5MJU8G,"I knew this movie was done on an extremely low budget with actors that I had never heard of and I am sure some with very little to no acting experience. So when I went to watch the movie I prepared to have to get ""through"" the movie. Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised with the movie. I thought there were a few parts that were slow or could have been better. (I don't think I have seen a movie where that isn't true). Overall I felt the movie was great. I felt emotionally tied to Alex and telling him not to do those things. I felt that the actors did a good job and the narrative was very well done. I do really like how the move shows Gods redemptive love and still shows that we live in a world that isn't easy. I would recommend this movie. Well done!",1438560000,2,759,4.066666666666666
8704462,4,B00U5MJU8G,"God Almighty, forgiveness and love is portrayed well, the acting is not so hot.",1534032000,,79,4.714285714285714
8704463,4,B00U5MJU8G,"This movie is not about being polished or cinematic, it's about telling a story of Christian forgiveness and how people can change. Some of the scenes were contrived, especially in the middle part of the movie when the character Daniel is strangely inconsistent and some of the scenes were very far-fetched. Character development seemed rushed (even for the main character), and there seemed to be some plot holes. The changes these characters went through are realistic in my opinion, though the pacing of the change seemed unlikely. But, again, this is a Christian message movie and the point is that people can change (even what some may consider to be very abrupt change) if an individual becomes Christian. I liked how parts of the Bible were actually read by some of the characters--this was the case with the character Elaine in the last part of the movie when she was reading Ecclesiastes 3 and a montage of flashbacks is placed on screen during her reading, so the reading was contextualized to her situation. This was one of the better cinematic moments of the movie. However, several sections of this movie seemed notably stilted.

Rating this movie is challenging, because the audience for this are probably individuals already convinced of the message (""talking to the choir,"" as the saying goes), so for the message it is 4 out of 5 stars, or for many, it's 5 out of 5. But for the acting and storyboard, it is a 2 out of 5. Overall, it's somewhere between 3 and 4 (rounding up).  The central message is consistent throughout the whole movie. But the storyboard has some plot holes and seems rushed with some characters underdeveloped in the context of how they change in what seemed quite an abrupt shift especially for Daniel. That is probably a problem of how the script was written, but acting really seemed stilted there. It is unclear how much reach this movie will have. I do appreciate the consistent Christian message of forgiveness. This is a movie that is not about ""being happy,"" in my opinion, it's more about making some difficult choices and humility toward actually changing behavior so that one may be at peace.",1529712000,,2142,4.802168021680217
8704464,2,B00U5MJU8G,"I liked the message of this movie but the acting and quality of the movie was very poor.  But God can use anything for His glory, to bring the lost to Him though a personal relationship with Jesus.  This movie might just be what someone needs to see so they can be pointed to salvation thru Jesus.",1529107200,,297,4.192982456140351

8704470,3,B00U5MJU8G,"This movie reminded me of The Ultimate Gift. Alex had to learn humility to change his life around. He receives grace and turns to his Savior.

The story seemed a bit slow at first, and I didn't like the idea of scamming churches, but the filmmakers turned around the plot nicely.",1496880000,,279,4.470588235294118
