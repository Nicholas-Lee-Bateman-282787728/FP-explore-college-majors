4125876,1,B003HI3B3A,"Make no mistake about it; the glory days of Full Moon are over. Puppet Master 9 is a drab, horribly written, dreadfully acted mess. When I say it (the film)
has no redeemable qualities, I'm not kidding. This film is so
low-budget, even the puppets barely move.

Puppet Master 9 is allegedly a direct follow-up to Puppet Master 3, which set the Puppet Master and his creations in the middle of World War II. It was a novel approach that breathed new life into the dying series after the wrong turn of Puppet Master 2. This film, however, is far from a successor to PM3. The story concerns a young man who discovers Andre Toulon's puppets hidden away after Toulon kills himself to prevent Hitler and the German army from stealing the secret of the animated puppets. What follows is endless talking about how the main character would love to kill Nazis, but his bad leg prevents him from doing so. It's not till the very end that all this talk comes to any sort of fruition with the boy and the puppets taking on the Nazis who chased Toulon to his death. The sets look as if constructed by a high school drama team, and the actors as if they only just graduated from there.

As a long time fan of Full Moon Films, I had rather high hopes that
this would be a return to what once made Full Moon Films something to look
forward to. Alas, it was not meant to be.

Save your money and find copies of Puppet Master 1 and 3, the best of
the series.",1280448000,6,1439,4.283088235294118
4125877,4,B003HI3B3A,"With the recent very disappointing Demonic Toys 2, i really didn't have much hope for Full Moon Films or Puppet Master: Axis of Evil. But i couldn't resist watching a Puppet Master film, even though last few haven't been gold,(PM VS DT, RETRO, and CURSE(Curse wasn't that bad)). After viewing the new Puppet MAster i got this sudden reminder of the golden age of Full Moon Films: Sub-par Acting, Bits of Gore here and there and Low Budget but actually gave a crap about the movie. I won't say Puppet MAster: Axis of Evil is 5 star film because their are flaws to the film, but its still very solid fun movie. Good Work...oh yeah the ending...Big CLiffhanger.",1280275200,,658,4.584745762711864
4125878,4,B003HI3B3A,"The Puppet Master films are a series that had fallen on hard times. The once proud films had been the shinning star of the Full Moon empire. As Full Moon fell, so too did these films. The decline started promptly after part three, as bad acting, poor scripts, and embarrassing directing murdered a once proud franchise. They hit their low with the piss poor Legacy film, which was nothing more than a rehash of footage, with a few small vignettes to bring it together.

After feeling ripped off by the secret origin of the puppets in Retro, and the confusing absence of Rick Myers in part 6, I was worried about what I was getting when I picked this up at the San Diego Comic Con. The most recent Full Moon films, Evil Bong, and the Killjoy films weren't even good enough to use to balance an uneven table. It was purely a whim that I grabbed this, but I had a few hours to kill in the hotel. I was very pleased with what I had when I finally popped it in to view it. Nothing mind blowing, and perhaps a little slow to pick up, but when it did, hot damn! Nazi's drop dead, and, well, that is always awesome (let's not forget the greatness that was part 3.)

This movie won't win any Oscars, nor will it change how you feel films should be made, but it breaths life back into a franchise that I had written of 15 years ago. You actually care about the characters (which I haven't done for a Full Moon film in years,) and the main star manages to have his angst over being cripple without being obnoxious. The puppets are well done, and the villains are evil, without being over the top. This movie has heart, and that makes it stand out in the very crowded B-horror film genre.

If you, like me, thought this franchise would never drag itself out of the mire, rejoice, the puppets are back, and they bring back with them the mayhem and action they had once delivered so well. It is truly a heartwarming coming of age film. Our hero Don goes from likable, but unfocused boy, to puppet wielding Nazi killing man in 80 mins of smartly put together film, with few surprises, but no mistakes. Hopefully this will be the great return of these films, and a triumphant comeback for Full Moon.

Often at the end of reviews for recent Full Moon films, people say the film was so bad it was good. I would just say that this film was simply good.",1280016000,2,2333,4.295454545454546
4125879,4,B003HI3B3A,"So Full Moon return to the franchise that made them a name.  It's been quite a while, and Full Moon's output of recent years is really nothing to brag about, so we could only hope and pray that a new Puppet Master would remind us of the quirky fun Full Moon had put out in the 90s.
The Puppet Masters weren't high art to begin with, and they got pretty lousy near the end there(Retro Puppet Master!), but Axis of Evil brings the series back and seems more like one of the Full Moon films of yesteryear.  Demonic Toys 2 was another recent more ambitious Full Moon film, but fell pretty short.  Axis of Evil is much more fun.
It's a prequel, and ties more into the plotlines of parts 1 and 3.  During WWII, Danny wants nothing more than to fight for his country, but a bad leg from polio has kept him out of the military.  He's refinishing furniture in the Bodega Bay hotel at the same time puppetmaster, Andre Toulon is hiding out there from the Nazis.  In a clever editing of new footage mixed with the original opening sequence of the first film, we see that Danny arrived at Toulon's room right after his suicide and sees the two Nazi spies ransacking the room.  Danny manages to find Toulon's trunk(too easily), and our little puppet heroes inside.  Danny discovers a Nazi sabotage plot, and armed with his new puppet friends he finds that he can indeed fight for his country after all.
Like I said, it's actually quite fun.  The WWII setting is good, the tie-in with the opening scenes of the first film are clever, and the story, while not epic by any means, is interesting.
The movie is obviously low budget, though not as low as recent Full Moon features.  The puppets are still ""nice"", as they have been since Part 3, and I kind of miss the evil puppets of the first two films.  The puppet effects are nothing to brag about, quite primitive, actually.  They make the David Allen stop motion animation of the first two films look like Spielberg in comparison. And in the tradition of many Full Moon films, the film doesn't so much end as it does stop in it's tracks, as if the film had run out.  Oh, we'll be seeing another Puppet Master in the near future.  And considering Axis of Evil, that's not a bad thing.",1279843200,3,2219,4.380487804878049
4125880,4,B003HI3B3A,"Ok, so it is the first ""Full Moon"" Puppet Master film of the past 10 years. We'll disregard the awful Sci-Fi original flick.

Taken from the DVD Jacket - In a stateside hotel during the height of World War II, young Danny Coogan dreams of joining the war effort. Following the murder of hotel guest Mr. Toulon by Nazi assassins, Danny finds the old man's crate of mysterious puppets and is suddenly thrust into a battle all of his own.

Ok, I'll admit, I have waited years for this flick, I've loved the Puppet Master franchise for as long as I can remember, going to ""Video World"" and grabbing each VHS was every week was an awesome experience! How did this movie hold up? Surprisingly well! The effects are not really that horrible, and there was little to no CGI that I noticed. The story is up front, and actually interested me. I'll admit, it's nothing like Full Moon's features of the early 90s, but it's a fun movie none the less.

Video - I bought the Blu-Ray version, but from what I notice, I think I made a poor mistake. You notice everything in this version, from make up to puppet strings. I also noticed some shimmering, and the black levels weren't that great. Also, I might add that the special features are not 1080i resolution, but 480p.

Sound - I have no sound system installed, so I can't really tell you much on this one, I noticed some hissing, and sometimes I mistook the music as tires squealing.

Bonus Features -

The Making of Evil - 13 video casts from China. These were all done during the making of the film, and they're somewhat enjoyable. They total to over an hour, and something that I actually see myself watching again. Well worth it.

No Strings Attached (Making of the first Puppet Master Movie) - Very informative, but if you've seen the original, you've probably already seen this material.

All 9 trailers for the other Puppet Master flicks.

All in all, this one was worth [...] bucks. It's a fun way to waste 80 minutes, and surely you'll get something out of the experience.",1279238400,5,2019,4.50958904109589

4125883,2,B003HI3B3A,"When Charles Band and his Full Moon company delivered the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/very-worst-entry/dp/B00028G7AC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">very worst entry</a>&nbsp;into their most famous franchise in 2003 and couldn't find it in their own budget to produce a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/crossover-flick/dp/B00D9EJFRS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">crossover flick</a>&nbsp;in 2004, it seemed as though the ""Puppet Master"" series was finally laid to rest for good. Then, six years later, another sequel appeared, full of potential...and then only marginally raised the standard of the last official film. I wish I could write a more triumphant review of the Puppets' comeback, but those past mistakes which the movie alleviates are just replaced by other ones, slightly less damning. It's a step up, but not enough of one to warrant a new movie.

The story: following the suicide of Andre Toulon, his Puppets are taken by a disabled woodworker (Levi Fiehler,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fetching/dp/B00K7IO24A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fetching</a>) who will need to use them to thwart the attempt of a Nazi agent (Tom Sandoval,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vanderpump-Rules/dp/B00AYCNOHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vanderpump Rules</a>) to destroy a local munitions factory.

I know that Full Moon is a studio not known for its subtlety, but I really, really hate this screenplay. The story itself is okay, but writer Domonic  Muir (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Critters/dp/B000099T3P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Critters</a>) makes himself responsible for some of the most ham-fisted dialogue I have ever heard. I wish I had a quarter for every time that the protagonist laments his unfitness to enlist in the military ""because I'm a damn cripple!"" It's not enough that Nazis are evil (""If anyone knows torture, it is we""), but wide-eyed good guys need to keep whining about it (""You'll never defeat freedom and democracy!""). Characters that have only this kind of dialogue devolve into caricatures, and it almost entirely nullifies whatever talent the cast may have.

On the bright side, the production values are a lot better than Full Moon's last attempt at these movies, and the Puppets themselves are in pretty good form. They've undergone yet another cosmetic makeover, though not necessarily for the worse. Seeing as the great David Allen had at this point been deceased for over a decade, we're not about to see a return of the stop-motion animation that helped make the earlier films unique (save for the scene that's been lifted from the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Puppet-Master/dp/B003L2YUEG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Puppet Master</a>), but the puppetry is reasonably good. The problem? - not much action. Most of it's reserved for the final twenty minutes, and this - (SPOILER) which includes a scene of a very dumb Japanese thug eating one of Leech Woman's namesakes - isn't as satisfying as it could be.

(SPOILER) I groaned at the movie's cliffhanger ending, because while I'm always up for giving the series another chance to climb out of the hole it's dug, I hadn't been all that engaged by the last 90 minutes and didn't feel too compelled to follow these whiny characters to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/another-adventure/dp/B009B8YNGO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">another adventure</a>.

4125886,2,B003HI3B3A,"This franchise just isn't getting any better.

We return to the Bodega Bay Inn in 1939, when Andre Toulon commits suicide before being captured by the Nazis who have so desperately sought the secret of eternal life which animates his puppets.  A young fan of Toulon's puppet work, Danny recovers Toulon's puppets and learns how to animate them with the magical serum.

Director David DeCoteau (Curse of the Puppet Master, Puppet Master III: Toulon's Revenge, Retro Puppet Master) hasn't done much good for this franchise since its third installment.  Here, he directs a less zany story than parts 4 through 7, which serves as a promising return to the original franchise standard.  Danny finds himself protecting Toulon's secrets while trying to prevent the Nazis and Japanese from destroying an American weapons factory.  This is all fine, but far too much time is spent focusing on Danny, the Nazis and the Japanese and far too little screen time is afforded to the puppets, which, last time I checked, is why I'm watching this!  I'd rather have a terrible story and more puppet action...like in Curse of the Puppet Master.

Our hardly featured puppets include Blade (parts 1-2, 4-8), Leech Woman (parts 1-3, 6-8), Pinhead (9 movie veteran), Tunneler (9 movie veteran) and Jester (9 movie veteran).  When Danny opens the puppet chest we see a few others (not featured in previous movies) that receive no screen time or explanation.  Danny also creates a new puppet with the soul of a loved one--it's a little ninja with throwing stars.  The effects (or lack thereof) behind the puppets' movement is perhaps the worst in the franchise.  When the 20 year old franchise opener has better special effects than the most recent entry (part 9), something is terribly wrong.  Folks are getting lazy!  Worse yet, they stopped using stop-motion and/or real human hands for Pinhead!  Now he's just ""some doll"" and his iconic hands have been rendered indistinct.

So, were there any cool puppet-driven scenes?  Eh, not really.  Leech Woman pukes a leech into a yakuza's sushi dinner.  After he eats it (chewing it up--which clearly doesn't bother the leech--and swallowing it), it is evidently unharmed and lacerates his throat, leaving him spewing blood.  That was probably the highlight.

Unless I'm mistaken--and I'm not because other reviewers caught this, too!--there has been a major error in the story's timeline.  This is set in 1939 and Toulon commits suicide. But Puppet Master III takes place in 1941 with Toulon in Berlin...and he's ALIVE...before he ever even escaped to America's Bodega Bay Inn.

What can I say about this?  It was better than Puppet Master: Legacy, which was really just a highlights reel more than a movie.  That's about it.  Just not good.  Don't watch it.",1378080000,,2780,4.98695652173913
4125887,3,B003HI3B3A,"I have to admit that this movie may not be as good as the original films, but its better than the tenth entry in the series. That one really sucked.",1374364800,,148,3.966666666666667
4125888,5,B003HI3B3A,"The Puppet Master films had fallen on hard times.  Stop Motion artist David Allen had passed, budgets had decreased, and Full Moon's flagship franchise was reduced to glorified clip shows (The Legacy) or non-canon SyFy original movies (Vs Demonic Toys).  It seems in recent years, however, that Charles Band is trying to bring the fun back to series and holding it in the high regard that it deserves.
Arguably, the best entry in the series to date has been Part 3, which found The Puppet Master, Andre Toulon, in WWII fighting off the Nazis in a prequel set before most of the other films.  Axis of Evil is set in that time just after Toulon has killed himself at the Bodega Bay Inn (as seen in Part 1) and we follow the new Puppet Master, Danny Coogan (Levi Fiehler), a young man with a Polio-caused limp that impedes him from enlisting.  Soon though, he discovers not only Toulon's puppets, but also a group of Nazi and Japanese spies on US soil plotting to blow up the arms factory where his girlfriend works.  It's up to Danny and the puppets to take on the Axis of Evil and save his girlfriend.
Watching this film, it is very clear that all parties involved are trying to bring the franchise back to it's former glory.  Part 3's director, David DeCoteau, returns and brings the same style to the series that he brought to his earlier film and the casting is outstanding.  Fiehler shines as Danny in probably the best leading role in the series next to Guy Rolfe in part 3.  He brings a real heart to the film and you almost forget that you're watching a direct- to-video sequel about Nazi fighting puppets.
The only element that makes the film suffer are the puppets themselves.  With a lower budget, I'm sure it was impossible to employ stop motion like in the good old days.  We're left with mostly wire and rod puppet work.  Now that does do the trick most of time, but some shoddy wire removal work destroys the illusion from time to time.  If you can look past that, though, you'll be in for treat as Axis of Evil, at the end of the day, is truly one of the series best.

Forty-five minutes into this film, the puppets have only appeared three times in new scenes, twice for less than a minute (Pinhead and Jester), and once for about a minute long sequence where Blade sticks a Nazi in the calf.  A long sequence early in the movie simply regurgitates PM1 where Blade is racing against the Gestapo to warn his master of the danger.  Been there, done that.  I'm sure it is cheaper to film human actors yakking endlessly about their problems than to pose or computer generate the puppets, but the franchise has been successful, so I fail to see why they have to recycle cuts from the older(and better)installments and why they insist on writing such bad and cliched dialogue for the human actors.",1338681600,4,787,4.7226277372262775

I was curious if anyone else when hit POP UP MENU button on their remote at the end of the film had a brief pause and the credits continue to roll instead of the main menu come up?

After Toulon kills himself to keep his puppets secrets of the Nazi hands, the puppets themselves end up in the hand of carpenter Danny Coogan instead. When Danny recognizes Nazi's Max and Klaus from the hotel at the plant where Danny's girlfriend works he ends up joining the war effect in his own special way. His attempt to prove that Germans are in town results in the kidnapping of his girlfriend Beth. Its up to the puppets to help Danny rescue her.  As others said the movie does end in a cliff hanger as like movies 4 and 5  films 9 and 10 are also a two parter.

This dvd has trailers for the first nine Puppet master movies as well as behind the scene features on both Axis of Evil and original Puppet Master movies.

Unfortunately, this film is less a continuation of the series and more a `special guest star' reunion.  The Puppets are sorely underused.  Instead, there's this ridiculous story about a guy who desperately wants to join the war effort (to kill Nazis) but he can't due to a disability.  Oh yeah, he has a girlfriend and an irritating brother, and then there's mom.  The Puppets have taken on the role of product placement rather than being the stars of this feature.  Needless to say, there's a reason this is called Puppet Master.....it involves puppets.  These idiot filmmakers obviously thought they could do without THE puppets and placed all their hopes on unknown actors (rank amateurs spouting the most ridiculous drivel ever penned to paper).  Not one of these (so-called) actors is a star in the making.  What were they thinking!?

4125897,2,B003HI3B3A,"I've been a fan of the Puppet Master series since I first saw Puppet Master 2 on Sci-Fi Channel's Halloween horror movie marathon over a decade ago. I loved seeing these little puppets kill in each of the series' installments. I even enjoyed the rather corny 4th and 5th entries, when they fought against demons. But to be honest, the series lost something after the first few films. It seemed that with each new entry in the series, the films were getting worse and worse. Not only were the plots becoming more ridiculous, but the effects used to make the puppets move were actually becoming less believable. This trend has continued all the way to the most recent film in the series, Puppet Master: Axis of Evil.

The film takes place during the time of World War II, immediately after Andre Toulon kills himself in the original Puppet Master, so as to prevent the Nazis from discovering the secret to making his puppets move without strings. A partially-crippled furniture maker working at the Bodega Bay Inn stumbles upon Toulon's room just as his Nazi pursuers are leaving and takes Toulon's chest of puppets with him when he returns home to Chinatown in LA, where his mother lives. Most of the film revolves around the protagonist trying to disrupt a Nazi-Japanese plan to blow up a US weapons factory with the aid of Toulon's puppets.

The story certainly isn't bad, but far too much time is spent on the interactions between human characters, rather than between the puppets and the people they try to kill. It goes without saying to anyone who's followed the series to this point that this isn't the first Puppet Master film to be without the creepy edge of the first three films. The puppets simply aren't scary anymore, though that seems to be Charles Band's intention, as they're implemented as tools of war by the American ""good guys"" against the Axis Powers. This may have worked well in the third film, but it's simply cheesy in this one. The special effects used to make the puppets move are perhaps the worst in the series as well. There is no CGI nor any complicated effects used whatsoever. Practically every time you see the puppets moving, it's not a whole body shot, so that they can be cheaply moved using the parts not shown. It's a horribly amateur style, especially considering how much better the effects looked in past movies. When a film of the same series made over 20 years ago has better special effects than the most recent entry, you know something is wrong.

Beyond the poor special effects, the acting is downright atrocious in some cases. Most of the characters are actually pretty believable despite some ridiculous circumstances, but a few of the actors and actresses just aren't up to par. The ""Dragon Lady"" in particular was simply awful. Not only were she and her henchman clearly not Japanese, but you could tell that all her lines were being read phonetically, as she had no connection to the words she spoke. It was as if she simply guessed on a whim which words might require emphasis, and she usually got it very wrong. I may be nitpicking here too, but if she is Japanese (so much so that her English is poor), then why would she be speaking to her commander over the phone in English? In one scene, when Tunneler is drilling through someone's head, you see blood cover the victim's face, but when the camera switches angles, there is no blood to be seen there. There are just so many inconsistencies like this in the film that it's hard to take it very seriously.

There are a few plot twists that may have you sympathizing with certain characters, but for the most part you'll simply be wishing that the film would end. Unfortunately even the ending is a dire disappointment. It so blatantly leaves itself open to a sequel (which I can't imagine anyone would be looking forward to) that it fails to even close up the story of this film even partially. There are a few slightly redeeming factors, such as the attractive cast, the nicely detailed sets, and the well-replicated early-forties settings (including the well-done Chinatown), but what good are any of those if awful special effects, overrating, and a largely dull script stand in their way? The puppets, which have always been the main draw of this series, are barely featured in Axis of Evil, and when they are, the effects are so poor that the fun of watching them kill is completely gone.

As for the DVD itself: the picture quality is actually rather good, though the archival footage used near the beginning clashes somewhat with the modern filmed scenes. The extras are also pretty decent, though it's unlikely you'll care enough to watch them after viewing this film. It's just unfortunate that none of these qualities matter much when the film itself is such a letdown.

I truly wanted to like this film. My expectations were at the lowest they could be considering how poor the past few installments were, but it somehow failed to meet even those most minimal of expectations. I can say with confidence that I will never watch this film again, and I most certainly won't be anticipating the inevitable direct sequel.",1301270400,6,5134,4.711581291759465

With all of the technology available to update this movie franchise, I implore Charles Band......please stop making movies if you are not willing to put forward the proper financing and effort, congratulations on ruining a classic horror series..............",1284768000,8,462,5.065789473684211
4125899,3,B003HI3B3A,this movie just does not show to much of the puppets at all  if they make another puppetmaster movie  they need to show more of the puppets in the movie and the ending well it just did not end right to me ????  other then that the movie  is ok  but the older puppetmaster movies are a lot better then this one .,1284681600,3,311,3.873015873015873
4125900,2,B003HI3B3A,"What happened to the great acting in the Puppet Master series? This film was a real letdown. I have been an avid fan of this series since the very first film, Puppet Master.  This film is not anywhere near how the originals were acted. The actors are horribly amateur. Each puppet was only shown once in the film and they are the main reason I watch these films. I wanted to see more puppet action, not bad acting. The evil madame was the worst campy bad guy (girl) I've ever seen in a movie. No, this is not how I envisioned this movie to be. And then they don't even finish the story, they leave it open ended so they can make another one. Not cool.
  Stick to the originals. Buy Puppet Master 3 Toulon's Revenge (the Best), or Retro Puppet Master (second Best),or even Puppet Master 1 or 2,4,5. Any other one is better than this one.
  Sure, the originals had some campiness to them, But it was classy campy!",1282953600,11,911,4.304093567251462

8397120,5,B003HI3B3A,"I'd say this is the best since. Puppet master part 4 and part 5 by far although I did really retro puppet master. I know a lot of people did not like that one because it was a pg 13 film. I think people don't realize that you can be clever without the gore, although. Each film has been directed by different directors so each film is going to have it to take, I guess.

I know this may be a controversial review and I believe we're all entitled to having our own opinions. So here, I'm just gonna point out things I've noticed. And what has happened in the series after this film and prayer to this movie? And also? What does the rector has released under his name? The thing I don't know is if one of the films I'm about to mention if they are released as physical copies or if you're only able to watch them on the full moon website slash Amazon channel that I don't know. Now I did really like the take on this movie because to me, I followed up in the very beginning. Seen of puppet master right. Where Andre too long. Takes his life, and it's an alternate take on the story line. And basically how the puppets come to be how they become alive and how they go from point a to point b, especially with the next film, which I already did a review on. And the newest one? Which every leasing week by week. I did a review on that so far and you will see I really do not like the fact you can get the movies for under 10 dollars, even when they're new and you're paying 20 dollars an episode or 33 minutes or less. Anyways, I do like to take on this movie, I like the idea of. As a puppet being good. Although I don't know if they're going to explain how the puppets were good before they turned evil and then went good again. Because the first movie. Along with the second, they were evil and they killed, everybody that was not an evil person so. Home little confused with this movie, I loved it though, but I do like the idea that it's like puppet master part 3 they're killing Nazis, so on it so far, which is where I'm about to go with my

I truly think that. Charles band may be. A racist for a white supremacist or maybe even a Nazi sympathizer? Because I looked at his collection of grindhouse films, I've looked at the puppet master series, which I own all digitally and. A physically along with a lot of his films that aren't on the pole website and. Its always Nazi stuff. The biggest thing that stuck out to me was. A movie called a Nazithon which stars that woman Michelle bombshell McGee she was the woman that was covered in swastikas and a white supremacist that dated who used to be married to Sandra Bullock point that I'm getting at is when you watch the first minute or 2 of the trailer for that movie it's all people being thrown into concentration camps it's a rape movie showing Nazi the soldiers pick women to do things in order to survive the holocaust and in between cut aways you have that Michelle woman who look into the camera doing disgusting things saying disgusting things and then it cuts to another clip of people being abused physically sexually etc. And what I'm getting at is I've noticed with his movies I own a lot no I has a higher profile rule except a small bit role or a cliche and stereotype role doesn't matter if its puppet master doesn't matter if its evil bong com or any of his films and I think I only 40 I started noticing this recently because I'm stuck in a bed so I have a lot of free time on my hand. You can say what you want about this review, but if you actually seen a lot of this guys, movies and you are a full moon if you, actually. Take in what their name and reading to it a little bit it stands for something but I'm not writing that my",1505779200,,3702,4.118948824343015

8397123,3,B003HI3B3A,"Last week I started with the first Puppet Master and have continued to the Axis of Evil. While it is certainly not the worse of the sequels it still suffers from bad pacing, awful acting, bad puppet designs, and some cringe-worthy animation. On the positive side, it is an original story with new characters instead of a clipshow, the music while not spectacular does fit fell with most scenes, and the cinematography is actually well done switching angles at the right moments and there is a nice pov drill shot of Tunnler. Tunnler and Pinhead look so bad in this movie but Blade and Leech Woman are about, if not just slightly worse, the same in terms of how they look. There is a new puppet and he is nothing extravagant but his design is nearly not as bad as the 'Tank' puppet from ""Curse"". As the title suggests the movie takes the Nazi part of the series lore and expands on it and while I'd rather take that over the whole Hell/Demon spin, I would still rather the series go back to the physics of the first two films.",1467763200,,1025,4.4
