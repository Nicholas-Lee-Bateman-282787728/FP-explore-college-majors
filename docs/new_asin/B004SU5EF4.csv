4464514,3,B004SU5EF4,"A new ""pilotless"" commercial airplane veers off course and is about to be shot down by the military, along with everyone onboard. The only chance to save the passengers is if the man who built the computer can regain control. But first he has to get on the plane!",1391731200,,263,4.387755102040816
4464515,2,B004SU5EF4,"From the very beginning I was able to tell this film was not going to maintain any type of believeability.  At the beginning of the film one sees a Boeing 737, thereafter is the crash but it is using Boeing 727.  The makers of this film simply did not do their homework.",1389225600,,270,4.173076923076923
4464516,5,B004SU5EF4,"Saw this many years a go & thought it was a good movie, & thought it would be good to have in my library.",1376611200,,105,3.4166666666666665
4464517,3,B004SU5EF4,this movie makes one wonder where the goverment get's funding for a aircraft of this kind. I think we all know who's paying for it.,1366156800,,131,4.28
4464518,1,B004SU5EF4,"A plane's engine is on fire. The pilot opts to cut off the fuel in flight to stop the fire, however the engine doesn't restart and the plane crashes. The operator was blamed for ""human error"" even though the black box (never mentioned) would have exonerated the pilot. Brad Dourif plays the evil capitalist wanting to exploit the accident to promote his new CD-70 automatic pilot, based on predator drone technology. Casper Van Dien is not too sure about using the M-5 eh ah CD-70. Lets see...if I was to guess they use the CD-70, it messes up and Casper must save the day by killing giant alien bugs. And the reason why I am guessing is that it became too painful to watch the film all the way through. It was bad...real bad, as in destroy your copy, don't give it away bad.

The acting and script felt like a bad movie made for TV circa 1975. Don't waste your time or money.",1364342400,4,876,4.341463414634147
4464519,2,B004SU5EF4,This was an ok movie. Another airplane disaster movie like all the other disaster movies. Only gave it two stars.,1343779200,,113,4.7
4464520,1,B004SU5EF4,"The other reviews are right that this movie isn't campy, it's just boring and numbing.  I watched it because I'm a fan of Nicole Eggert.  Yes, she makes B movies, but I find her sexy and fun.  Not anymore.  She was neither in this, just old. -- Keith Vlasak",1341360000,,257,4.183673469387755
4464521,2,B004SU5EF4,"I typically like Casper Van Dien's low budget stuff, but i have to admit this felt a little under cooked.
Computerized plane goes out of control, passengers freak out, Casper comes to the rescue, and it's all settled in lightning speed. If i had to pinpoint a problem, it's a lack of real tension. The plot is just a little too simplistic to serve as a compelling action-adventure vehicle. Still, it's not his worst film.",1319500800,2,421,4.626666666666667
4464522,1,B004SU5EF4,"There have been some decent airplane disaster movies-- TURBULENT SKIES is not one of them.
Not only is the movie dull, its script is ludicrous, the direction by the infamous Fred Olen Ray is flaccid, and the acting community theatre level.  The few special effects are totally pedestrian.  I don't have anything to recommend this time-waster.",1315785600,,342,5.089285714285714
4464523,2,B004SU5EF4,"Unintentionally hilarious, I had great fun watching this disaster.
Yes, it's ever bit as bad as one could imagine.  Every aeronautic clich is employed on cue, starting with a crash and things you don't want to hear someone call out during a flight: ""The wing's on fire!""  Or.  ""We're going to `attempt' a landing!""  (Isn't that an either or type of situation?  Either you land or.....)  At least no one yelled out, cheap piece of crap!
The actors are a who's who of has-beens and never were, starting with former Days Of Our Lives star, Patrick Muldoon, who introduces Sam (Nicole Eggert) as ""selling herself short.""  Not the type of thing you want to say about someone who is....short.  The co-pilot is Jason Cook, another alumnus of Days Of Our Lives.  And then there's Casper Van Dien and how low can you sink, Brad Dourif.
I liked how the whole premise for this `box that flies planes' is because they managed to make crashing sound like an hourly event.  Casper is the genius behind this invention.  I know, I laughed too.  Most of his scenes involve him leaning in with his nose in everyone's business.  No one leans quite like Casper.
Once they installed the big doodad and started flying the blue light special, all hell breaks out because Charles call me Chuck (Muldoon) uploaded some gobbledygook or a recipe for his granny.  The doodad couldn't handle the unsolicited input and started thinking it was actually the captain.  Naturally, all bad things mount and before you know it, PANDEMONIUM!  ""Captain Langford, do you copy?""
""Just that one time but I was never caught!""
I loved how they worked severe flooding into the plot, as if that would be an issue!
Thank God there just happened to be a General handy to order the plane shot down!  But, with Casper's snippy wife onboard they couldn't let that happen.  The scene that followed was something directly out of Executive Decision, only without the Steven Seagal mishap.  Yes, calmer heads prevailed (actually, just Caspar with furrowed brow.  His best acting to date); they shoved him into the uncontrollable plane so he could work wonders with a pair of pliers.
I thought the cartoon smoke was especially effective.

I wonder if there's a sequel in the works?",1313107200,3,2226,4.759791122715405

4464525,3,B004SU5EF4,"Was ok but I've seen better air disaster films.  Too much hype made about plane to plane transfer for it to be so simple and disappointing.  Also, he disabled the computer too easy.",1446768000,,181,4.454545454545454
