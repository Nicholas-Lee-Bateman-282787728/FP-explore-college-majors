8698882,1,B00SM43B2K,"It amazes me how modern producers can take such liberties with a great masterwork and twist it around into an inverse of itself, destroying the original work's intent and very story, and call it art!  Princess Diana is a Greek tragic figure on the order of Alceste?  Just take the time to look up the original Greek story and how Gluck turned it into an opera.  This is a mirror image - a shadow - nay not even that.  Its post-modernism on steroids.  If you lack the talent to write a great story, compose great music and have a clear timeless message just take a classic and rework it anyway you want and celebrate.  Just take a Rembrandt and scribble all over it.  I just wanted to see this Gluck opera not some distorted self-serving drivel.  This reminds me of an art assignment given to my daughter.  Her art teacher told the class to go to the library and get a book that had not been checked out in many years.  They were then to draw figures all over the book making it into a ""work of art.""  My daughter came home with a first edition of Saul Bellow's Herzog which won the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction and the The Prix International. I saved the book but not the teacher.  The book was given to me by the school for safe keeping.  This is no different.  If you buy this production be prepared to check your brain at the door along with your hat.  These people make an excellent case for eternal copyright protection.  Euripides is calling Eumenides for help!

I had neglected to mention that Anglican Clergy precedes over a foot washing and worship at the temple of Apollo.  And beware of the third act where copulating corpses in a morgue are in the background providing the necrophilia pornography that pretends to be an opera production.  At the final curtain the crowd applauds politely but unenthusiastically.  I can't even recommend you listen to it with the video off as the performance and singing is flat.  The acting is stiff, unnatural and strange.",1428364800,10,1976,4.509859154929577
8698883,5,B00SM43B2K,"Sometimes the simplest ideas are the best. That's the principle behind Gluck's reformist operas, reducing the stories and the nature of operatic expression to their dramatic essence, without over-elaboration or ornamentation. It's also the case this time (mostly) with director Krzysztof Warlikowski in his production of Gluck's Alceste for the Teatro Real in Madrid, one of the final productions under the artistic direction of the late Grard Mortier. Warlikowski views Alceste as a royal drama about a queen who dies for love. Taking that as a starting point and thinking of it in terms of how that story has modern-day universal relevance, he applies it to the death of Princess Diana, but can a modern-day tabloid story really be considered to be comparable with ancient mythology?

Surprisingly, by getting right back to the essence of what Alceste is all about, and bringing a strong artistic and creative impulse to bear upon the work, the director is able to make the parallel meaningful, but it's evidently not an approach that is going to appeal to everyone. Typically, the director sets the tone and lays out his ideas in a prologue before the opera starts. This time it involves a five-minute film that shows Angela Denoke's Alceste being interviewed Princess Diana-style, where she covers many of the same issues and problems revealed in TV interviews with Diana. In it, she frankly discusses the difficulties of being in the public eye, of being unable to cope, of her post-natal depression and her rumoured suicide attempts.

That might seem like it has little to do with Alceste offering her own life in sacrifice to Apollo in exchange for her husband King Admeto who has just died, but it does provide us with some kind of background character detail that is credible for someone in her position which may be relevant as far as understanding the decision she has taken. Controversially, Warlikowski also creates entirely new dialogues (in English) to fill out the kind of anguish, confusion and uncertainty Alceste feels and reveal how it tears at family bonds. The director even introduces Admeto's father as a speaking character, and if the dialogue doesn't really carry the same kind of poetic force as Gluck and Calzabigi's compositon, the purpose is clear and no less effective.

It's perhaps not so clear from the set design, but the effectiveness of the treatment is evident from the powerful pay-off in the finale. The stage and set design are of course not exactly what you would expect for Alceste, Act I taking place at a hospital, while Act III is set in a morgue rather than in Hell. That, as you might also expect, is actually the least of Warlikowski's conceits, the director even introducing a gypsy dance for no discernible reason, but much of the strangeness can be related to the state of mind of an Alceste who wanders around in a daze, more suicidal in her grief than sacrificial. A fairly bonkers Hercules fits in well here. The conclusion however, a wheelchair-bound locked-in Alceste with husband and children presenting a distorted view of ""happy families"" is however utterly devastating, its bleakly realistic view contrasting with the (forced) happy end of Gluck's music.

Warlikowski isn't afraid to confront such questions and work with the score in this way, making full use of the dance music not for ballets but to play out the dramatic setting he has imposed on the opera. As is often the case with Warlikowski, however, the singing performances aren't given as much attention as the staging.  Ivor Bolton conducts the 1776 Paris version of the work well enough, but I'm not convinced that the Madrid orchestra really have the precision and rhythm to hold down and bring out the full dynamic of the score. This Alceste therefore needs to be a strong actress, and Angela Denoke brings a great dramatic intensity to the role. The Baroque dramatic soprano range isn't always within her comfort zone, she's inconsistent and can sound shrill when striving to reach and hold the high notes, but there's no question she gives it everything. The same could be said about Willard White as the Grand Priest and Thanatos, not always secure on the lower register, but he makes his presence felt. Paul Groves is a strong and lyrical Admeto, equally intense on the dramatic level alongside Denoke.",1428278400,2,4333,4.954607977991747
