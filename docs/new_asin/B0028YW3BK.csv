8357188,5,B0028YW3BK,"Take an ambitious musician, add her godly inspiration, and you have ""Inspired Ambition,"" the true-life joys and struggles of an up-and-coming Christian recording artist. Erica Lane is a talented singer, with an unaffected style and a pure approach. She's attractive, and yet she shows how her awkward adolescence helped shape her into the woman she is now.

This is reality TV, without the bells and whistles of gimmicky shows based around bachelors or millionaires. This is the story of a regular person with a deep desire to follow after God and use her talents in doing so. Along the way, she tours the country, faces ridicule and obstacles. She also meets with well-known musicians ranging from Michael Tait (of DC Talk) to Sandi Patti to the newer stars of Family Force 5. Each has something to share. Erica assimilates these lessons, showing us what it takes to go after a goal.

Whether you're an aspiring musician, writer, or carpenter, this series is a great encouragement to all who pursue a dream. There are humorous moments, candid moments, and scenes that will tug at your heart. The show doesn't come with cheap guarantees or slick slogans; it comes from the hearts of an artist and a producer who understand that ""Inspired Ambition"" goes much deeper than sales charts or pocketbooks.",1252454400,,1298,4.922374429223744
