8325926,4,B000YC3KKG,This screen play of the Maha Shiv Puran is excellent in depicting many of the original stories. For me this introduction brings together several stories/myths that I heard piecemeal at Yagnas and didn't quite connect. The emphasis is on story telling and impact on current eminence/significance of the various existing temples devoted to Shiva-Parvati. My personal preference would have been a bit more on the philosophical side and Hollywood type special effects. Great for all ages and especially a treat for the younger generation with religious inclinations.,1413504000,,562,5.471264367816092

8325928,1,B000YC3KKG,"Had waited for several years to get this DVD set, but when I finally got it there were no English Sub-titles so am having to send it back. Although, I live in India most of the time and can get it there with the sub-titles, it was cheaper through this vendor, but they didn't bother to mention that there were no English sub-titles so if you don't understand any of the Indian languages don't buy it. Returning it.",1283212800,9,414,4.32051282051282
