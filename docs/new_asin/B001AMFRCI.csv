8278006,4,B001AMFRCI,"This DVD contains two projects--a Puzzle Pillow Blanket (a blanket that folds up into an attached pocket to create a pillow) and a Cardigan.

Both the projects use the same technique of extensive short rows to turn corners.  While I love the pillow blanket the cardigan design is not to my taste.  Even though I would likely never make the cardigan, many of the techniques Meg Swansen demonstrates are extremely useful and could be applied to many different projects.",1255910400,6,467,4.886075949367089
8278007,4,B001AMFRCI,"Liked the DVD but could have used more detail on the Puzzle Pillow Blanket.
The directions on this project were a little rushed for my taste.",1229040000,7,141,4.461538461538462
