6105746,5,B00GS18CK0,"First of all, if you love Fairy Tale you will LOVE part 8.  My kids and I blew through these discs in 2 days time.  The story line is unique and interesting as usual.  I won't say what happens because I do not want to give away anything just know that, Fairy Tail never dissapoints.  We always find it hard to wait for the next set to be released.  This combo came with 2 regular DVDs and 2 Blu-ray disc which is great for those who own one or the other or both.  This set was just all around AWESOME!!",1396224000,2,502,3.97
6105747,5,B00GS18CK0,"My husband watches these not me

So that's why I gave it that rating",1395532800,,97,3.6666666666666665
6105748,5,B00GS18CK0,Fairy Tail never fails it is always awesome!!! It always has comedy action and is just a great anime overall!!!!,1395360000,,112,4.65
6105749,5,B00GS18CK0,"Fairy Tail: Part 8 includes episodes 85-96 and concludes the Edolas arc. This was not my favorite arc, I thought it dragged on too long and did not have the same energy as previous arcs, but this Blu-ray/DVD is still a must have for your Fairy Tail collection. My husband and I love Fairy Tail and had watched the previous episodes on Netflix and on FUNimation. We finally broke down and pre-ordered Part 8 after reaching the end of the available online content. This was my first pre-order purchase through Amazon and I am extremely pleased with the order process. The Blu-ray/DVD came new and unopened and well protected. We will definitely order the remaining Parts for our collection and will be pre-ordering Part 9.",1392076800,8,720,4.768
6105750,5,B00GS18CK0,So glad to have this part in my collection. Can't wait to see what new surprises and adventures awaits the Fairy Tail guild.,1391472000,,124,4.434782608695652
6105751,5,B00GS18CK0,"My gosh if you aren't watching this, start immediately. I fell in love with this show from episode one. It's got the maturity that teens and young adults will fall in love with, but still has the allure that magic and friendship bring out the childish side in us all. And if the amazing plots aren't enough, then just hang out and listen to the amazing cast they pulled together. Newton Pittman and Cherami Leigh are absolutely wonderful. And to too it off, you have the hilarious Todd Haberkorn, and the stunningly talented Colleen Clinkenbeard.
Bottom line, owning this is worth every penny spent. So hit the button, preorder it, and make sure you've got a weekend to just sit down and enjoy the pure brilliance that is Fairy Tail.",1387929600,19,733,4.6461538461538465
6105752,5,B00GS18CK0,"If you haven't seen this I suggest you get it (either pre order the english version here or get used to reading subtitles). It's like watching a mythic multicultural hodge podge, at least that's how I feel when I watch it. The character's are great and the english voice acting is fantastic, I can't get enough of Natsu(Todd Haberkorn) and have taken interest in a lot of his other work since I fell in love with this, thanks for an awesome show and keep up the good work guys and gals!",1387152000,5,486,4.351648351648351
6105753,5,B00GS18CK0,"This might not be released in official English dub, but it has been released in an unofficial dub. I've seen it, and let me tell you, you do not want to miss out. The ending of this arc earns a new friend, some strange allies, and a moving yet very ""Fairy-Tail"" style departure. Dont miss it, order it now!!",1385424000,6,307,4.220338983050848
6105754,5,B00GS18CK0,"Part 8 brings you streight into the action, picking up where part 7 left off- with Happy and Carla descedning from Extalia to Edolas. Time runs low for the two exceeds to save their human friends. Both Wendy and Natsu are being held prisoner, so magic can be extracted from them. King Faust of Edolas hopes that their magic will charge the ""Apocolyptic Dragon Chain Cannon"" enough to fire it, then use it to hurl the floating lacrima (that contains all of Magnolia), at the Exceed city of Extalia- Producing a collision that will give his kingdom a ""Source of Un-ending magical Power!""
  Both the Edolas, and Earthland Fairy Tail won't just stand-by and let this injustice happen though. When Fairy Tail's strongest team is reuinited, they all with the Edolas Fairy Tail guild in an all out magical war to throw down the Tyranical King Faust. Even though large scale clashes are common, many one-on-one duels.
  Two Female Swordmasters slash viscously for multiple episodes on end, trying desperately to overcome their twin counterpart. This struggle only loses its action when Erza Scarlet, and Erza Knightwalker throw their most powerful spells at each other, causing the city they are on to dissapear from the world. Even then, the two struggle in vain to defeat the other with the remaining power in their bare hands.
  On top of that, Fairy Tail's dragon slayers get the spotlight, with a 3 on 1 battle with the King of Edolas- Faust. Did I mention that Faust is comofrably resting in a dragon-like monster that is armored like a battleship, known as the ""Dorma Anim""? Outgunned, Fairy Tail's Dragon Slayers must do what their title suggests: slay the dragon-like machine, and end the King's rule before he destroys the lacrima, and Extalia.

  On a personal note, I loved the action in this arc: specifcally Natsu, Wendy, and Gaijeel vs. the Dorma Anim and King Faust. On paar with this fight was the Erza vs Erza fight. Both Erza's are so devoted to their cause that they don't stop fighting for that cause, even when it means resorting to their last ounce of strenght and fist fighting each other. Overall, though not the BEST arc ive seen, its still a 100/5 star Part that is worth every penny of cash. (I also suggest going to Youtube, and typing in ""Sannin no Dragon Slayer Theme"", and ""Erza vs Erza Theme"" and listening to those. These soundtracks allow you to hear just how stellar Fairy Tail music is!)",1385424000,3,2416,4.733333333333333

8626555,1,B00GS18CK0,"Did not buy. Simply concerned.

$47-$50 for only 11 episodes (or 22)? I don't know what's going on here, but for the actual 'Collection Eight (Blu-Ray/DVD Combo Pack)' of 48 episodes (24 on four DVDs and 24 on four Blu-Rays, with episodes 165-187), brand new, never been opened, its retail price is $35.99-- cheaper than only the 22 that come in this DVD or set. And that's ""22"" if Parts are the same as Collections in that they have the same number of episodes on separate DVD and Blu-Ray disks, and not just on 1-2 disks. This item should really only cost somewhere between $18.99-$22.99. I've been buying the Fairy Tail Collections since 2013, and then worked at an entertainment store that dealt in selling new and used movies, books and games in 2015-16', so I priced the new and used Collections and even the Parts that came through the store.

So, I'm just curious, is this a misprint in price or something else?",1517184000,,919,4.597560975609756
