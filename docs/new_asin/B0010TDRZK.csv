8238526,5,B0010TDRZK,"Very enjoyable series from late 80s/ early 90s.  If you like Burt, enjoy the Palm Beach scenery, and like old classic tv detective shows then you will enjoy this movie series.  They may have been pushing the ""Travis McGee"" vibe when they made this series, but what's wrong with that.  Beats most of what you find on TV these days.  Thanks Burt!",1389398400,2,344,4.5
8238527,2,B0010TDRZK,"After a series of increasingly lower performing and lower quality feature films throughout the 1980s, Burt Reynolds decided to try his luck on network television as part of ABC's revival of the Mystery Movie format. On paper, B.L. Stryker looked solid, a private eye series with a light touch, produced by Burt and Tom Selleck. Doubtless, the two envisioned the series as an offshoot of Selleck's Magnum PI, but, in reality, most of the episodes misfired to one extent or another.

Reynolds starred as B.L. Stryker, a former New Orleans cop turned Palm Beach private investigator, who lived and worked out of a run down houseboat. Ossie Davis co-starred as Burt's only confidante, an ex-boxer who usually got involved in the cases as well. Burt also had a kooky secretary (Dana Kaminsky), a wealthy computer genius neighbor who was the butt of many of Burt's jokes (Alfie Wise), and a wealthy ex-wife (Rita Moreno) who still carried somewhat of a torch for him. Despite the talented actors in these roles, the characters were largely underwritten and underused, a far cry from the well drawn ensemble that supported Tom Selleck on Magnum.

The shows themselves were definitely a mixed bag. Because each episode ran about 95 minutes (to fit, with commercials, in the two-hour mystery movie time slot), the scripts were often quite padded. The crime elements of most of the shows were laughable, with third rate drug dealers, loan sharks, and mob enforcers played by fourth rate actors proving no match for Burt. So, during the parts of the episode in which Burt wasn't playing tough guy, he alternated between playing the snarky Burt, making fun of the cops and the Palm Beach elite, and the sensitive Burt, interacting with Davis and some of the guest stars. The sensitive serious parts of the episodes often worked well, but snarky Burt often proved quite grating, as his putdowns included people like Wise and the local police chief who really deserved better treatment, as well as the Palm Beach elite who needed to be knocked down a peg.

The best episode of the show was co-written by Robert B. Parker, creator of Spenser, and his wife. In Blues for Buder, Burt befriends a boy (Neil Patrick Harris), who has fallen under the spell of a sleazy televangelist (Michael Chiklis) and become an obnoxious brat who tries to convince everyone he meets they are degenerate sinners. Burt's scenes with Harris are quite touching.

The box set contains the five episodes from the first season of the show. All in all, only one (Buder) is completely satisfying, but most of the rest have something to recommend them. Ironically, the first, pilot episode is the weakest of all with Burt trying to catch a serial rapist who targets his new girlfriend (Helen Shaver). A bad mystery mixed with an unsettled format and an uncomfortable star does not make for quality television. The remaining episodes feel like good one hour episodes stretched into two mediocre hours of material. Anyone thinking about purchasing this first season should be aware that these episodes, along with the second and final season of the show, are available in a complete series box set that may offer better value for the money. Fans of Burt will want to see B. L. Stryker, but those hoping for a newer Magnum will be disappointed.",1388793600,,3298,4.873440285204991
8238528,1,B0010TDRZK,This should never have been included on the Sunday Mystery Movie rotation. I bought this and watched a couple of episodes hoping for some improvement from one to the next. Terrible. Avoid this. Stick with the original Mystery Movie stars.,1324252800,,238,4.975
8238529,5,B0010TDRZK,"I was living in Palm Beach County at the time B.L. Stryker was filmed, working just a block away from Phillips Point and the first show of Season 2, FBI headquarters was filmed inside the office where I worked.
 What memories of seeing him around the area filming and to look at the changes around Palm Beach County as it has built up.  There was nothing downtown until the past 5-7 years and I see how its grown.
 One thing that I see int eh show, that I know most other people don't see, is when the Chief of Police or the Palm Beach Police arrive at a location, I always wonder why they are there when its West Palm Beach, but forget that for most viewers who have never been to Palm Beach, they won't know the difference.",1210291200,2,725,4.201438848920863

8238531,5,B0010TDRZK,I liked watching the show when it was on and I was very happy when I found it on the website.  It was a good show and Burt Reynolds was very good in it.,1206748800,,152,3.4705882352941178
8238532,5,B0010TDRZK,"In 1989, ABC and Universal Television division tried to do what NBC tried in the late 1970's, A Mystery Movie wheel. They had four Mystery Characters (Kojak, Gideon Oliver, Columno & Stryker) revolving in a two movie format once a month. The concept lasted two TV seasons until ABC canceled the wheel.

Reynolds filmed this show in the late 1988-1989 near his home in Jupiter Florida. Reynolds incoporated the south Florida landscape as a character in itself.

This serious was  played  in a fashion to the John D MacDonald Travis McGee novels, which Reynolds tried to get for a film or two. However, This series seemed akin to McGee as well as the Rockford Files.

Another factor is Ossie Davis play sidekick to Reynolds. Davis acts like a Meyer to Reynold's McGee.  His small part of the washed out boxer friend steals every  scenes without really trying. This is a testimate to the actor and the man.

These Stryker mysteries are  well done for a television production. This first season is only five 94 minutes episodes, but each are well crafted whodunits. With scripts by noted writers like  Robert B Parker, who created Spenser novel, this show is sharp.

Now let me say these copies are clear masters. They could be shown today if the networks needed shows to put on.

The TV GUIDE imprint is semi new  DVD division of Arts Alliance America, but they have released two Banacek volumes, the second season of Charles In Charge, and the complete Crow tv show. This show fits right in with this

Go get it, I want a lot of sales, so they can release the second (and Final( volume of this series

8238533,5,B0010TDRZK,"I'm a big fan of TV mysteries, so I was very happy to see Arts Alliance America releasing the first season (5 2-hour episodes) of this very underrated mystery series. Burt Reynolds fans (who know what he can do when given solid material) and TV mystery aficionados should grab this one!

""B.L. Stryker"" only lasted two seasons (as long as the ""ABC Mystery Movie"" lasted) but can and should have gone far longer, even after the umbrella series was axed.  ""Stryker"" was a terrific series, the best by far of any of the ABC Mystery Movie segments (including the Columbo revival, and I'm a Columbo fan!) with strong talent in front of and behind the camera. Tom Selleck co-produced, the scripts were strong by the likes of Robert B. Parker (""Spenser: For Hire"" and the ""Jesse Stone"" series) and Joe Gores, and the directors included Hal Needham. And this series is among the best that Burt Reynolds ever did, solid mysteries with a light comic touch (but never buffoonish comedy).

The cast had a terrifically smooth chemistry from the start, including Ossie Davis as Stryker's best friend and retired boxer Oz (whose character really grounded the show and humanized the potentially cliche Stryker PI character), Dana Kaminski as Stryker's wannabe-actress/secretary Lynnda, Rita Moreno as Stryker's glamorous ex-wife Kimberly, Michael O. Smith as the local police Chief McGee, and Alfie Wise as the nouveau riche neighbor whose toys (planes, cars, SUVs) always ended up getting destroyed during Stryker's cases. And the guest cast included Kristy Swanson, Helen Shaver, Maureen Stapleton, Neil Patrick Harris (before Doogie Howser) and many others.

The pilot episode is much darker in tone and violence than the rest of the series, and the true tone of the series and the full cast of characters aren't established until the second episode. If you're a mystery fan or a Burt Reynolds fan, do yourself a favor and buy the First Season (with 5 2-hour episodes) when you see it, so that sales will dictate Arts Alliance releasing Season 2 (with 7 episodes, several among the best of the series).

The video is clear and the episodes are unedited, and as a bonus there's PDF scripts of 3 of the episodes.",1204502400,9,2197,4.9110512129380055
