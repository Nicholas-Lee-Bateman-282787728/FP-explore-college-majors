8070551,5,B0009YVDBW,"Deadlier Than The Male is the best film to follow in the general style of the James Bond thrillers, especially in the style
of filmmaking, updating the classic Bulldog Drummond character into the 1960s. The sequel, Some Girls Do, is quite
exotic. Both looked superb on my new Sony All-Region Player shipped with the films. Near Blu-Ray quality. Thank
you for your prompt service",1524355200,,378,4.921875
8070552,1,B0009YVDBW,"Prompted to buy this by vague recollection of seeing Deadlier on its original release. Deadlier is bad, but Some Girls is worse. Presumably Deadlier was sufficiently successful at the box office to justify the sequel. There was a thoroughly regrettable trend in the 60s to exaggerate the James Bond formula and create ""spy spoofs"". Get Smart was the (still enjoyable) TV version of this. Plots would become even less credible and the ""humour"" content increased. Lower movie budgets meant less spectacle than the Bond films offered, but that was offset by significantly increased exposure of female flesh, although no nudity to ensure appropriate certification. Other films in this genre include Masquerade, The Liquidator, Our Man in Marrakesh, Our Man Flint (and sequels), The Silencers (and sequels). Serious resentment that I spent my hard-earned teenage cash on such trash at the cinema. 50 years on, watching them again provides some insight into my adolescence.",1517356800,,967,5.326797385620915

8070554,5,B0009YVDBW,"This is your opportunity to get both ""Bulldog Drummond"" Richard Johnson British ""spy"" films:  ""Deadlier Than the Male"" (1967) and ""Some Girls Do"" (1969).  ""Deadlier Than the Male"" alone is worth the inexpensive price for the double feature in Reg. 2 PAL system.  It is a very witty film with a screenplay by Hammer's Jimmy Sangster, David Osborn and Liz Charles-Williams from a story by Sangster.  Richard Johnson stars with Elke Sommer and Sylva Koscina,  This is Koscina's second film with director Ralph Thomas having prior made ""Hot Enough for June"" AKA:  ""Agent 8-3/4"" with Dirk Bogarde which was excellent as well.  Sangster's presence is sadly missed in the script for ""Some Girls Do"" and Thomas and producer Betty Box again have Richardson Johnson cast opposite this time Dahlia Lavi, Sydney Rome, Yutte Stensgard and many pretty girls.  Robert Morley is also in the cast.  The Network product boasts two good transfers of the color films and features interviews and trailers as extras.  Well worth it, and better if one is a completist and must have both films.",1441843200,,1070,4.96067415730337
