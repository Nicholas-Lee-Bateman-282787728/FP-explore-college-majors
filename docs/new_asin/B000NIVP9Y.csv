8178002,4,B000NIVP9Y,"A few years ago, I copped a DVD titled ""Mixtape Inc. (The Movie: The Outtakes)"" that was basically a very long ""trailer"" for this DVD.  While the ""trailer"" show cased some of the biggest names in the game and looked to be very insightful - there was one major problem: a lot of the footage they used was already outdated.  For example, KANYE WEST can be seen talking about the various ways he picks up women with the images he portrays on the covers of his mixtapes...when was the last time KANYE put out a mixtape?  ""Kon The Louie Vuitton Don"" came out before ""The College Dropout,"" so we're talkin' at least 4 years!

All in all, this DVD is worth the money...but I can't help but feel as if the idea may have (originally) been trashed (or ""shelved"") only to finally see a release date solely due to the recent industry controversy over mixtapes (and the arrests of DJs DRAMA & DON CANNON).",1173916800,6,892,4.420731707317073
