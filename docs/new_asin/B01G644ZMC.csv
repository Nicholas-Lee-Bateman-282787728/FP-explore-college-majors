8762372,4,B01G644ZMC,"Pier blames his extended diamond-dealer family for his father's tragic life - and death. To take revenge, he insinuates himself back into the family enterprise.  Caught up in the power dynamics between his uncle Joseph and his cousin Gabi, who have very different ideas about the company's future. this French film with sub-titles is one very fine movie. I loved the acting and the story too. Niels Schneider as Pier is especially good. His plan to revenge himself on his uncle and cousin because they messed up his fathers life and then cut him from the diamond business is planned by him and includes his new extended family of thieves. The ending is excellent and I didn't see it coming and to say that this was a wonderful surprise is an understatement. Bravo.",1487721600,,764,4.7443609022556394
