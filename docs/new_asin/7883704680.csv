1121917,5,7883704680,My son who is 26 months has recently gotten into the TV show on Disney. So this movie came out at just the right time. It is so cute! My son likes it and the best part is ... so do I! I hope they make more movies with these characters.,1198022400,3,235,3.627450980392157
1121918,4,7883704680,"Preschoolers should love this bright and cheery Christmas movie, the first film based on Playhouse Disney's television series ""My Friends Tigger & Pooh."" The story is cute and full of energy. On Christmas Eve, the problem-solving Super Sleuths -- Darby, Pooh and Tigger -- help a little lost reindeer get back to the North Pole, and return Santa's lost magic toy sack, in time for Christmas. The characters are as appealing as ever. My favorite part? When Santa asks, ""Eeyore with your nose so gray, how'd you like to pull my sleigh?"" the little donkey gets his secret Christmas wish: to fly!

Also on the DVD are two episodes from the television show. ""Symphony for a Rabbit"" has Rabbit needing help with his Spring Concert when his orchestra machine breaks. In ""Tigger Goes Snowflaky,"" the bouncy tiger tries to find two snowflakes that are alike. A third bonus feature, the Hundred Acre Wood Downhill Game, lets players help Darby collect scattered gifts from Santa and guess which present goes to which character.

Why not five stars? Because when it comes to Pooh, I'm hopelessly biased. I love the A.A. Milne stories and Disney's early adaptations so much that I just can't fall in love with these newer programs. (Want a 5-star DVD?

1121919,4,7883704680,"If it was up to me this movie would get 1 star but it's my 3 year old son's opinion of the movie that matters and he loved it.  That surprised me greatly as he simply adores the classic Pooh films and stories.  He has never seen the new 'My Friends Tigger and Pooh' before and didn't mind Darby and the new style one bit.  He found the tunes very catchy and took in the tale with open arms.  What more can I say...

I disliked almost everything about this movie from the animation to the new character Darby and it's new style.  I felt that some of the original characters were a bit out of character ranging from either their voice, their lines, and/or their actions.  I disliked the new character Darby for no other reason than this...she is not part of and doesn't belong to the Hundred Acre Wood...I guess I am a purist in that the Hundred Acre Wood gang are really a part of Christopher Robin and his world.  Darby should be out and Christopher Robin should be in (along with Owl, of course!).  About the new style...it just isn't Winnie the Pooh...I really hated it.

With that said I reluctantly give this movie four stars because my son loved everything about this movie and there is nothing wrong with the underlying story and message.",1195948800,10,1244,4.393013100436681
1121920,1,7883704680,"Those of you who love the origional Pooh bear with it's sweet songs and melancholy love, like in ""Pooh's Grand Adventure...,"" will be sorely disapointed, as I and my toddler where. This is strickly Disney, and not Walt. Don't purchase this as there are other Pooh DVD's worth your hard earned dollars.",1195776000,7,301,4.8076923076923075
1121921,5,7883704680,"Tigger, Pooh, Darby and the others are on the case in the first film based on Disney's new ""My Friends Tigger & Pooh"" CGI-animated series. In this film, everyone is getting ready excitedly for Christmas. They all have things prepared and everyone has various Christmas wishes. Among others, Rabbit would really like to learn how Santa delivers his gifts, and Eeyore wants to fly! Roo and Lumpy (the cute little heffalump introduced in ""Pooh's Heffalump Movie"") are sent out to play and discover a reindeer named Holly trapped in a bush. They call for the help of the Super Sleuths, who free her, but this only the beginning of the adventure. Roo and Lumpy also find a magic bag, which turns out to be Santa's. Without it, he can't deliver his gifts and will have to cancel Christmas. So now, the Super Sleuths and our other friends from the Wood are on their way to their North Pole. Holly comes along with them, as she's a reindeer-trainee for Santa. The journey is tough, and at times, it seems almost hopeless. But with Christmas on the line, giving up isn't an option!

""Pooh's Super Sleuth Christmas Movie"" is great fun for all fans of this bright, exciting new series. They are plenty of great lines and laughs, some thoughtful and heart-felt moments, and three fun and catchy new songs. All in all, it makes for another sweet new holiday film.

Technically, this DVD release is wonderful. The color is bright and vibrant and the film is presented in 1.78:1 anamorphic (""Family-Friendly"") widescreen. The audio is Dolby Digital 5.1, and there are captions and subtitles available, as well as French and Spanish language tracks. This DVD also includes Disney's ""Fast Play"" feature, which starts the movie automatically if the menu isn't chosen. Previews include the upcoming ""101 Dalmatians"" Platinum Edition DVD release and ""Little Einsteins: Race for Space,"" among others.

""Super Sleuth Christmas Movie"" comes with two great bonus features. The best of all is an entire bonus episode from the television series, ""Symphony for a Rabbit / Tigger Goes Snowflakey."" This complete episode of the show has only aired in the U.K. as of the release of this DVD. In the first story, Rabbit needs help with a concert when he breaks his orchestra machine. In the second, Tigger searches for two snowflakes that are exactly alike. The DVD also includes a game, the ""100 Acre Wood Downhill Game."" This game is reasonably decent. It allows you to select from one of four courses and then collect a series of presents. After this comes a second part, in which the gifts must be matched to who in the Hundred Acre Wood they go to. The gifts should be reasonably easy matches, and Darby's comments are helpful as well.

If you or your kids are already fans of ""My Friends Tigger & Pooh,"" this movie is a sure bet. If not, give it a try! You may just discover something new, fresh and fun.",1195776000,19,2879,4.729083665338646

1122226,1,7883704680,This DVD sucks. It was such a disappointment that the characters are not their usual enchanting selves. They are in name and general appearance but the voices and personalities are completely different. This is definitely Disney trying to squeeze every dollar they can out of the Pooh franchise.,1275523200,4,295,5.166666666666667

1122229,2,7883704680,"This video is a major disappointment. When they say a run time of approximately 44 minutes, they mean it has seemingly an hour of advertising for other Disney properties before, during (Super Sluths)  and after the main story. While the characters are technically Tigger and Pooh, it is as if the Disney computer generated the whole movie from a mix of scripts and characters fed into it. Very patronizing.",1265068800,2,406,4.884057971014493

Lumpy and Roo befriend a little reindeer named Holly and help her find her way back to the North Pole and save Christmas.  The story is fun, the animation is good and it has a wonderful musical score.  I really wish this was available as a soundtrack because my daughter wants to listen to the few Tigger and Pooh songs that we have over and over, and where some kids music is annoying ,I really enjoy listening to this with her.",1260144000,,515,4.288659793814433

1122271,5,7883704680,We bought the DVD for our 2 year old daughter and she loves it. We have watched it over and over. There is a snowman scene that she says is to scarry for her but all in all we love the DVD.,1229040000,,189,3.5238095238095237
1122272,5,7883704680,"My daughter absolutely loves ""My Friends Tigger And Pooh""!  We bought this Christmas DVD for her last year when she was 18 months old, and she loved it then.. a year later at 2.5, she still loves it!

This is definitely a Christmas DVD - unlike their ""Halloween"" dvd.  It is about 40 minutes long (so.. twice as long as a regular episode), which is a perfect length for a movie for a toddler!

And, there are 2 bonus episodes on the DVD as well (regular 20 min length episodes).

1122276,4,7883704680,My daughter watched this video almost everyday from when we got it in the mail to when we hid it after Christmas (to watch next year).  There is a cute main story and two smaller episodes as well as several interactive games.  I would recommend to anyone who likes the TV show or Winnie the Pooh (as long as they are okay that the main character is a girl Darby and not Christopher Robins).,1200268800,,390,4.256756756756757

7900083,5,7883704680,"Another Disney Christmas fave of mine is Pooh and his gang's Super Sleuth Christmas Movie, even if it's only 44 minutes long, as Seasons of Giving and A Very Merry Pooh Year were over an hour long apiece! Since My Friends Tigger and Pooh resurfaced on the Disney Junior Channel in 2016, hopefully, this movie will be on it, too; along with 2 other Pooh movies from this CGI series that followed; Tigger & Pooh & A Musical Too and Super Duper Super Sleuths. Darby and her puppy Buster aren't the only new characters exclusive to this series, there were a host of others that never appeared here in this movie; but we do see Lumpy and hear about his mother, even though she's rarely seen in the show, as with Christopher Robin himself, even if he and Darby were proven best friends, not only with Pooh, but with each other! At any rate, Pooh's house is all decked out for a Christmas party, until it becomes a ""Chris-mystery"" for the Super Sleuths, returning Santa's sack and Holly the reindeer to the North Pole! It'll take some doing, but the Super Sleuths always get their job done by having their mysteries ""historied"", even on a trek through the snow to Santa's place from the Hundred Acre Wood! There's a few bonuses in here, including a Fullscreen-only episode of My Friends Tigger and Pooh, though the whole series was originally in HD-Widescreen, just like the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse! Too bad that this, along with most of Pooh's DVDs in general, are in the Disney Vault, so it'll be high to get any copies, old or new!
