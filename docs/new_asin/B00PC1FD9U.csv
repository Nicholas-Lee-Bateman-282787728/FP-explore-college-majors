6791795,4,B00PC1FD9U,"This bio pic about Alan Turing has a message. It is: outsiders are the main source of, and society's best hope for creativity.
Turing was a homosexual at a time, when 'indecency' could still be punishable by prison time. In Turing's case, chemical 'castration' was imposed by the court as the way to avoid prison. The man committed suicide.
Turing is also seen as afflicted with Asperger symptoms. Unfortunately, the film uses some odd behavior to give itself a touch of comedy.
I assume that the biographic elements in the film script are correct, because I know no better. We see Turing as the leader, in his anti-social way, of a team that successfully cracked the German Enigma code and thus contributed strongly to the Allied victory in WW2. We also see him as inventor of a thing that we now call 'computer'.
A side effect of watching the film is this: you become aware of the strange fact, that most of the above has been an official secret for half a century, until declassification of the Enigma story.
The outsider theory is emotionally pleasing and works well for movies like this. In real life it clashes with ideologies of team work for success of an organization or company, or for the common good. Most people are perfectly able to believe in the strength of the team and in the importance of eccentric genius at the same time. The problem lies in knowing the difference between destructive egotism and creative outsiderdom.",1419465600,2,1439,4.7370517928286855
6791796,5,B00PC1FD9U,"Whats it about?

The true story of how mathematics won the second World War. A socially inept mathematical genius named Alan Turing is employed by a government agency to break the German cryptographic systems.

What I thought:

This is the story of one of the greatest of human achievements. Along with Babbage and Lovelace, Turing is one of the parents of the modern age. While the dramatizations sometimes inch into the realm of misinformation, any man, woman and child whose life benefits from the invention of the computer owes it to themselves to watch this exciting story.

If they don't owe it to themselves, they at least owe it to Alan Turing.

Oh god, I cant stop crying.",1419379200,2,681,4.737288135593221
6791797,5,B00PC1FD9U,"The Imitation Game is one of the best films I've ever seen. It takes a long and very complex story, and extracts the essentials to create a narrative. All of the actors are excellent, but Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley are absolutely superb in portraying Alan Turing and Joan Clarke, with all the quirks of a relationship between geniuses. Although the story includes a tragic element, I was surprised at how much humor the film includes, and the ultimate emotional impact is uplifting rather than depressing. The good Turing does with his life give us much to ponder and celebrate, while his tribulations remind us how different (and not totally different) his time was from the present.

A great story for all ages from teens and older, especially those of us fascinated by modern technology who love to get a glimpse of the development of the modern digital age.",1419379200,2,875,4.87248322147651
6791798,5,B00PC1FD9U,"The film: the script should win an Oscar as well as the performance by Cumberbatch, at least.  It's a movie, not a biography and exceptionally well-done. It's engaging at all times, thrilling in parts, funny and thoroughly entertaining.

I'm not sure why another reviewer believes Turing didn't have issues dealing with adults.  Family members and people who worked with him provided information about his social awkwardness.  His stammer was quite acute (obviously could not be that for a movie) and he was socially outcast during most of his formative years. In the time that children learn the codes of social interaction, he didn't have the interactions. The script does a great job of showing the arc in Turing's character as Joan Clark helps him deal with this issue.",1419292800,,773,5.015625

6791809,1,B00PC1FD9U,"The film is ruined by two separate instances, by two separate characters graphically describing their engaging in oral-sex with someone else, which assaults the innocence of the viewer.
  The film sheds insight into why mathematician and code-breaker, Alan Turing, became a homosexual in his youth. Alan Turing attended boarding-school where he was relentlessly bullied and viciously abused by the older boys. In turn; 40-year-old, Alan Turing, seduced and sodomized a 19-year-old boy, which this propaganda film portrays as okay, rather than immoral.

  The film forgets to portray that six-years before World War 2; the Polish government used espionage to purchase the blueprints for the Enigma machine from a German man for the price of a million-dollars in today's money. The Poles built their own Enigma machine; and built a computer to crack the settings for the Enigma machine; cracked the German Enigma code; and read German coded messages for 6-years prior to World War 2. However, just before the invasion of Poland; the Germans changed their Enigma machine from 3-rotors or wheels of letters; to 5-rotors; multiplying the possibilities of their code beyond the ability of the Pole's small computer to break it. Thus, the Poles were suddenly unable to read coded German messages as the Germans moved to invade Poland. The Poles gave their code-breaking knowledge, and their Enigma machine, and their computer to the British.

  We are all sinners. It might be said of Alan Turing, ""When he was good; he was very good, and when he was bad; he was very bad."" Unlike King David, who committed adultery and conspiracy to murder; Alan Turing did not find God, forgiveness, and the cleansing restoration that only God can give. Alan Turing was a key player in the British breaking the German Enigma code. The Germans increased to eight rotors in some instances, and changed the settings of the Enigma machine every day..

  Alan Turning had a good side and an interesting side. He rode a bicycle to work, but had hay-fever, so he wore a gas-mask while riding his bicycle. His bicycle chain was damaged; would work loose after a while, and fall off. Rather than spend money to replace it; Turing became interested in determining the number of pedal revolutions before the chain would fall-off. Turing counted his pedal revolutions and then got off his bike and adjusted the chain before it fell-off and continued on. It would have been easier to estimate the time, say 7-minutes, but maybe he did not own a wristwatch, but rather an unwieldy pocket-watch. Turing was a very good runner; running past the local running club of star athlete runners one day along the roadway.

  In technical terms of lighting, costumes, sets, and actors; the film is well-done. The story moves at a good pace and keeps your interest. The film is informative as well; explaining some of the code-breaking, which the other movie ""Enigma"" leaves clouded and mysterious. The other movie ""Enigma"" has a scene of graphic sexual-intercourse, which comes unexpectedly and quickly. Many things in life are neither all good or all bad; such as this film.",1525910400,,3129,5.015444015444015
6791810,3,B00PC1FD9U,"The Imitation Game is a very interesting story about breaking the Enigma code by English mathematician Alan Turing and his coworkers. The character of Alan Turing played marvelously by Benedict Cumberbatch is I think somehow pushed to the extreme. We know that he was an exceptional mathematician but here we see some eccentric who is rather unfriendly and uncooperative, whose ego is bigger than anyone can accept. Almost got him fired, almost. As we see these traits can easily be forgiven in the light of his accomplishments (That's how usually people react-it is easier to condemn someone who is not liked than the liked one). And he certainly is liked for what he did to end the war. However it should be mentioned here, since we don't have it in the movie that Enigma code was broken much earlier. It was the Polish mathematician Marian Rejewski who accomplished that in the year 1932 with a simpler version of that machine. With his help and the help of few other Polish cryptologist Alan Turning was able to brake Enigma code during the war when Nazi were using by that time a little more sophisticated Enigma. It is nicely portrayed in the Polish movie: Sekret Enigmy (The Secret of Enigma) from 1979. Interesting is fact that both movies have very similar ending with the scene in London where they decide to keep Enigma secret after the war.
Overall The Imitation Game is fascinating movie, well made, showing us one of the important pieces of history from the WWII.",1525132800,,1477,4.7734375

6791812,3,B00PC1FD9U,"Not a bad watch - but not great. The film is rife with overdramatizations/inaccuracies that put Turing into standard Hollywood tropes.

Many significant events in the film didn't actually occur in real-life but were done simply to add drama (scriptwriters thought Turing's life wasn't exciting enough I suppose). This would be fine if they were subtle and seamless within the story. But many of the falsified moments stick out as rather obvious and compromise the viewer's sense of being immersed in the story.",1522540800,,510,5.144578313253012

6791817,3,B00PC1FD9U,"The big part missing in this movie is to detail the political motivation behind Alan Thuring's conviction and the monstrous inhumane treatment he had to subject himself to as the alternative to jail. Would that have been included, the movie could have been a masterpiece on how governments function at a time such as World War II and the evolving idea of electronic surveillance, then in its nascent stages. The movie instead wastes time with hurrying through details of cryptanalysis that the vast majority of viewers is unprepared to understand in any event and that aren't even necessarily material to the plot. The character of Alan Thuring is very well played, and a real look behind the scenes at who was pulling the strings is sorely missed ! Regretfully, that is in keeping with the lame apologies by the British government in 2009 and afterwards. The appropriate response would have been to judge anyone still alive that was responsible and publicly shame the system of the time (as has been done with Nazi criminals up to the present time) that treated a genius like an animal, but disappointingly and very unproductively, even today some people don't want to acknowledge the political realities of World War II, and their implications for history and for today.",1520726400,,1272,4.9485981308411215
6791818,2,B00PC1FD9U,"In full disclosure I only made it about 25 minutes into this film. I was excited about the film because I am interested in cryptography and I just got done reading&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cryptonomicon/dp/0060512806/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cryptonomicon</a>&nbsp;by Neal Stephenson that covers some of the same ground. However, Hollywood has a tendency that I hate that was on full display in this movie. They take an interesting person (in this case, Alan Turing) and an interesting story (his life, and his breaking of the Enigma code) and rather than telling that interesting story about that interesting person they warp the story to fit some mold that they already have. Essentially, they use some real character to fill in for some generic trope and they wind up telling the same story that you see in dozens of other movies.

We are all familiar with the character that Benedict Cumberbatch plays in this movie. Benedict Cumberbatch is essentially playing his version of Sherlock Holmes or Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory. The genius who knows he is a genius and has no social skills and rubs everyone the wrong way and is totally misunderstood by all the people around him as a result. I did some research about 15 minutes into this movie to see if that at all matched what Alan Turing was actually like and based on my very cursory research it is either a total fabrication of Turing's character or a rather extreme exaggeration. At any rate, I could tell 5 minutes into this movie that I had already seen this story, about this character, a dozen times and there was not going to be anything new in it or interesting.

I could literally predict what Alan Turing was going to say before he said it. As soon as one of his co-workers said We are going to lunch I knew that at some point Alan Turing was going to say something along the lines of You didn't ask me if I wanted to go to lunch. You just said you were going to lunch. And, sure enough, it took them a long (boring, predictable) minute to get there but they got there. It is like they have a bunch of scenes pre-written that they just recycle in movie after movie and it would not be so offensive if they were fictional characters. But real characters are so much more interesting and three-dimensional than fictional characters and to force a real, three-dimensional character into such a two-dimensional mold is very frustrating.

I am going to school for computer science. I am fascinated by Alan Turing. I love reading about World War II, spies and codebreakers, and so on. I cannot understand why Hollywood, with so much meat for a good story, would choose to tell a story that has been told a hundred times already. I am not a wine drinker but an analogy would be taking a rare and delicious wine and diluting it with some boxed wine so that its taste is indistinguishable from the boxed wine. Alan Turing only lived once, his story is totally unique, there was no one else in human history exactly like him, but the filmmakers chose to dilue that unique and fascinating story by mixing it with some generic story that has been recycled a hundred times and made this movie indistinguishable from a hundred other movies.",1520294400,,3248,4.775800711743773

It's a tremendous loss to humanity that this genius was snuffed out due to discriminatory attitudes about his sexual orientation.  The  even deeper story hidden between the lines would be glaringly obvious to many of those who (like myself) are on the autism spectrum.  My heart ached for Turing when I saw  the bullying, mocking and ostracism he experienced all through his life and which many of us on the spectrum live through to this day.  I am glad that his lady friend came back to support him near the end of his life, which was cut short way too soon.  Bullying and exclusion of those who are ""different"" needs to end.  So many of us carry the scars well into adulthood and old age, and so many of us have failed to live up to our full potential because of it.  Sad!",1519862400,,921,4.402366863905326

As the definition of the word enigma suggests, the biography of the man who decoded it, Alan Turning is in of himself an enigma. The story of MI-6s struggle to crack the Nazi codes is thrilling and Turnings character, as portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch in a tour-de-force performance monumentally supports the story. The Imitation Game shifts in story between Turnings childhood and post-war life, unto a grand moral debate of secrets. On the one hand it maintains a very herculean approach to war, in making disheartening sacrifices for the greater good  an issue we see reflected in todays headlines from government leaders fighting over the Middle East. The oppression of homosexuals which The Imitation Game refrains from being abrasive about, is a lesson that applies to all walks of life  do not decimate based on appearances or misgivings. Alan Turing sits among the most important heroes of WWII, perhaps the 20th century considering his premature contributions to the modern computer, and the extraordinary film remains a worth testimony.",1514419200,,1155,5.204301075268817

6791856,3,B00PC1FD9U,"This film was fine entertainment, but nothing special.

It felt like a straight-to-tv production, not least because of the quality of the actual film. It's filmed in 30fps and the look is evocative of what is popular in the current spate of TV and Netflix original shows, etc. There are a number of production queues that give me this impression: the way the camera moves, the way the scenes are cut. It's hard to describe in detail, but you'll know what I mean if you pay attention. This somehow cheapens the result and makes it feel like a second-rate production. Perhaps this is simply my being behind the times in current media trends.

The quality of the acting is also second-rate, for the most part. Cumberbach provides the best performance, and carries the film largely by himself. The dialogue is forgettable, and my biggest issue with the film is the lack of chemistry between the actors. It's fine, but nothing special, nothing memorable. I also found the character development to be lacking. There are several jarring moments in the film where key characters have a change of heart, turn on a dime to express views contrary to what the plot developed for them. Notably, Turing's team ends up sticking up for him and saving the project after unanimously opposing him and panning his ideas earlier in the film; no explanation or exposition is provided for this sudden mood swing. There's no lightbulb moment in which the team start to catch on to Turing's brilliance and the possibility that their gambit could work. Likewise, his relationship with Kira Knightley's character is poorly developed. When Turing tries to call off their engagement, she responds with a weird mix of saccharine hope and surprising vitriol. It ends up feeling like a paint-by-numbers drama, which makes it not much of a drama at all.

Nevertheless, the content is so compelling, and the real-world stakes so high, that you can't help but get drawn in. Turing's story and the events at Bletchley Park are riveting in spite of, rather than because of, Morten Tyldum et al's treatment.

Codebreaker Candidate: And what is it that were really doing?
-Alan Turing: Were going to break an unbreakable [German] code and win the war.
Candidate: Oh!

The above dialogue is found in this absorbing historical drama thriller film loosely based on the biography Alan Turing: The Enigma (1983) by Andrew Hodges.

Alan Turing (1912 to 1954) was a genius mathematician and logician (as well as a talented long-distance runner).

So what is this movie about?  Turing was asked by the British government to help decipher coded messages sent by Germanys Enigma machine during World War 2 (1939 to 1945).  We get to follow the extraordinary work of Turing and his colleagues in Hut 8 built on the grounds of Bletchley Park (a manor in Buckinghamshire, England, U.K. that was Britains codebreaking or cryptanalyst centre).

But at the same time, because of his sexual orientation, Turing was forced to live a tortured secret life due to a then intolerant world.

I feel that this movie does a superb job of making me understand why Turing is considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.

This movie has an ideal ensemble cast (headed by Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing and Keira Knightley as his love interest) with every role filled to perfection.  It is Cumberbatchs nuanced performance that leaves a most powerful impression on the movie viewer.  (Knightley utters the first and third lines of the dialogue above.)

Everything else about this movie from its cinematography to its costumes to its musical score are noteworthy.  Thus, its easy to understand why this film has been nominated for, and has received, numerous awards.

Some people have criticized this film for its historical inaccuracies.  They forget that this is a movie (a work of art) and not a documentary.

Even though not necessary, I would recommend that any potential viewer learn about Turings life before seeing this movie.  I did this and so was able to understand some of the finer nuances that were presented.  I also enjoyed this movie a whole lot more.

Finally, the disc itself (the one released in 2015) has three extras.

In conclusion, this movie effectively presents the extraordinary and tragic story of a legendary codebreaker!!  I leave you with a factoid found at the end of this incredible film:

Turings work inspired generations of research into what scientists called Turing Machines.  Today, we call them computers.

6791940,5,B00PC1FD9U,"Three years after being released The Imitation Game still delivers with a stellar cast and a compelling story. The movie follows the true story of Alan Turing, a cryptanalyst for the British Army and his race to beat the Nazis encryption system, Enigma, at the height of World War II. Although this venue for film has been done time and time again, this movie takes a new approach to it which keeps the movie feeling fresh. The race against the clock creates a movie full of tension and stress which is shown by the all British cast with riveting dialogue.
 Benedict Cumberbatch is the star of the show, playing Alan Turing. The actors wit and talent shine through in this film and make it seem as if he was born to play this role. Whether its highlighting Alans awkward social life, or nailing Alans speech impediment, Cumberbatch is spot on throughout the film. With his smarts, hes able to truly captivate you through the screen and make you feel as if you're the one who must break the encryption system. But Cumberbatch is not alone in this journey. With supporting actors, such as: Keira Knightley, Matthew William Goode, Mark Strong and Allen Leech, this team of top secret British geniuses work together and feed off each other during the film.
 Keira Knightley who stars as Joan Clarke, the only female on the team to break Enigma, is flawless in her role as Alans friend and colleague. The movie stays true to the real-life friendship between Joan and Alan as they go through the process of breaking Enigma together. The scenes with Joan and Alan highlight how a socially awkward genius can and does connect with Joan throughout his life and is a true friend of his in a world that is just not accepting of the way Alan is.
 Along with the actors, the plot is something to be commended as well. While director Morten Tyldum could have given the viewer every piece of the plot from the get-go, he instead holds pieces of the plot back to intrigue the viewers mind. By using this approach, the viewer is invited to get creative with where they feel the plot is leading them. With the guidance from Tyldums directing and the creativity of the viewers mind, the viewer is lead down a path which ultimately reveals the heartwarming yet heart wrenching climax of the film.
 Where the film succeeds with Alans professional life, it fails in his private life. Although we see in a few instances into his private life, I wish director Morten Tyldum would have gone into more detail on Alans background to help draw the viewer in even more and get a better picture of Alan outside of his encryption cracking life. The movie could have also gone into more detail about the team that Alan is forced to work. Besides Alan and Joan, the rest of the team seems one dimensional and the viewer is never fully drawn in emotionally to the rest of the cast. Although the movie is not without its faults, these cons are greatly downplayed by what the movie does extremely well.
 Overall, this is a brilliant movie with a cast that blends together well and a plot that is fresh and interesting. Benedict Cumberbatch is excellent in the role of Alan Turing and delivers every step of the way. You will be glued to the screen for the entirety of this excellent film.

I had seen a play version years ago and also read articles so I knew the basics. The film is handsome to look at and certainly well acted by all. Cumberbatch is not your traditional leading man and he plays this role with physical and emotional vulnerability, appropriate  for the character.
The structure of the film is standard ""bio-pic""  with the core events bookended with early education and post war legal problems.

6791946,1,B00PC1FD9U,This caricature of Alan Turings life and very real contribution to World War II does him an immense disservice. Virtually every scene is cheesy and\or phoney. If you care about what really happened then read the biography by Andrew Hodges.  The Derek Jacobi picture from the '90s Breaking the Code is also much closer to reality and infinitely superior as regards acting and script.  This latest thing is worthless. The favourable reviews here are mind-boggling! Hollywood has got its hands on real extraordinary history again and managed to produce a cartoon version of history for the undiscerning. Bums on seats is all that seems to count. The characterisation was the worst I've seen in a film. Alan Turing was a great man and deserves better than this. Avoid.,1486857600,,764,4.9609375

It is largely Hollywood drama, but in the Amazon version, some of the inaccurate Hollywood elements are noted and explained in comments in the margin of the screen.  For more accuracy and coverage of his personal life, you need to watch a documentary.  My 5/5 rating is for how well this movie meets a much more modest and realistic goalshowing people that they need to know Turings name and the significance of his work.

After enjoying this movie last night, Im disappointed to see hateful comments about it in a number of Amazon reviews.  I wouldnt turn away moviegoers who would otherwise never watch a film about a brilliant mathematician.  I recommend this video for anyone who missed the movie in the theater.

When The Imitation Game came out, I was eager to see what Cumberbach would do with the great Alan Turing's life. My expectations were very much exceeded. I was not surprised that Cumberbach was able to depict Turing as a brilliant, if a bit odd, character, since that is how he portrays Sherlock in the PBS series. What I was not prepared for was the emotion he could wring out of the viewer during the Turing character's deepest pathos. Aside from Cumberbach's brilliant portrayal of a brilliant man, I was enthralled with the excellent story line and dialog of the film, and the technical aspects of cracking the Enigma code.

6792059,5,B00PC1FD9U,"In the Weinstein Company movie, The Imitation Game, Alan Turning is a compelling and intriguing character. Certainly the opening scene, where he is being viciously interrogated, draws the audience in. This movie has the audience wondering what makes Alan, played by actor Benedict Cumberbatch, so different?

Taking place in WWII, this movie illustrates the story of Alan Turing and his cryptanalysis teams mission to crack the German Enigma code. Portrayed in a beautifully compelling picture, and directed by Morten Tyldum, this film takes place in England. In comparison to so many other WWII movies, this particular film gives the audience a taste of the warfare away from the front lines at Bletchley Park. Alan Turing and his team must crack the German code to help prevent possible attacks on British and American ships, which in the end actually leads them to save countless lives.
Benedict Cumberbatch does a wonderful job at playing the complicated and multifaceted character of Alan Turing. Benedict displays a socially awkward, but brilliant, Turing in way that encourages the audience to wonder what he is hiding. He is cynical, secretive, mysterious and brilliant. Indeed, we find that Turing is a homosexual, and, because of the legal punishments that can be dealt by Britain at the time, he must keep his secret to himself. He holds this heavy weight while serving as a vital part of helping defeat Germany in the war. After the war, Turings sexual identity is eventually found out and is sentenced to chemical castration. Ultimately Alan Turing commits suicide. It is a tragic outcome but, because of the unaccepting social culture at the time, it is understandable. One may wonder why such passions arouse and why they must be punished and that is not an easy answer. How can anyone suggest they have not had a perverted thought in their lifetime. According to the Bible all men are considered sinful (Romans 3:23) and so all should be punished. Yet those who understand Gods love, through his atoning son Jesus Christ, they will not be punished but will be restored to His perfect likeness.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: THE IMITATION GAME [2014] is a highly conventional film about a profoundly unusual man and this is not entirely a bad thing. Alan Turings tragically shortened life and he was 41 when he died in 1954 and is a very complex and fascinating story, bristling with ideas and present-day implications, and it benefits from the streamlined structure and accessible presentation of modern prestige cinema. The science is not too difficult to understand, the emotions are clear and very emphatic, and the truth of history is respected just enough to make room for a very tidy and engrossing drama.

An Alan Turing biopic is, all in all, a very welcome thing. Chances are that you are reading this, as I have written this, on a device that came into being partly as a result of papers that Alan Turing published in the 1930s exploring the possibility of what he called a universal machine. Alan Turings decisive contribution to the breaking of the Nazi ENIGMA CODE gave the Allied forces an intelligence advantage that helped defeat Germany, though the extent of his wartime role was kept secret for many years. The secret of his homosexuality was revealed when he was arrested on indecency charges in 1952, and also caught up in a Cold War climate of homophobia and political paranoia and subjected to the pseudoscientific cruelty of the British judicial system.

All of this is a lot for a single film to take in, and THE IMITATION GAME directed by Morten Tyldum from a script by Graham Moore, prunes and compresses a narrative laid out most comprehensively in Andrew Hodgess scrupulous and enthralling 1983 biography. The film interweaves three decisive periods in Alan Turings life, using his interrogation by a Manchester Detective Robert Nock [Rory Kinnear] as a framing device. Alan Turing tells the investigator who thinks he is after a Soviet spy rather than a gay man is about what he did during the war. Later, there are flashbacks of Alan Turings school days, where he discovered the joys of cryptography and fell in love with a slightly older boy named Christopher Morcom [Jack Bannon].

The adult Alan Turing is played by Benedict Cumberbatch, who is ny his younger self Christopher Morcom [Alex Lawther], expanding his repertoire of socially awkward intellectual prodigies, real and fictional. What has made Benedict Cumberbatch so effective and what makes his Alan Turing character personality one of the years finest pieces of screen acting ever seen in many a year and is his curious ability to suggest cold detachment and acute sensitivity at the same time. If Alan Turing did not exist, 21st century popular culture would have to invent him, especially Benedict Cumberbatch showing his character Alan Turing as a sentient robot, an empathetic space alien, or a warm-blooded salamander with crazy sex appeal.

Benedict Cumberbatchs Alan Turing, whom the film seems to place somewhere on the autism spectrum, is as socially awkward as he is intellectually agile. On top of all that Benedict Cumberbatchs Alan Turing, can perceive patterns invisible to others but also finds himself stranded in the desert of the literal. Jokes fly over his head, sarcasm does not register either, and when one of his colleagues says, Were going to get some lunch, Alan Turing hears a trivial statement of fact rather than a friendly invitation. But most importantly, Benedict Cumberbatch gives and Oscar worthy performance.

THE IMITATION GAME derives some easy amusement from the friction between this odd ball and the prevailing culture of his native country of Great Britain. The films notion of Britain and of course not inaccurate, but also not hugely insightful and is as a land of understatement, indirection and steadfast obedience to norms of behaviour that seem, to a fiercely logical mind like Alan Turings, arbitrary and incomprehensible. At Bletchley Park, the country estate where teams of linguists and mathematicians are working under military supervision to break the ENIGMA CODE, Alan Turing is seen as stubborn and arrogant and the head of Bletchley Park, Commander Denniston [Charles Dance], finds him totally insufferable, as does Hugh Alexander [Matthew Goode], the suave, clever playboy who runs the ENIGMA CODE project until Alan Turing, with an off-screen assistant from Winston Churchill, displaces Hugh Alexander.

The Bletchley Park section, which is enlivened by the indispensably charming Joan Clarke [Keira Knightley] as the only woman on the ENIGMA team, who is at the heart of this film, though it is also the most familiar and in some ways the least challenging part. Director Morten Tyldum orchestrates a swift and suspenseful race against the clock with a few touches of intrigue and ethical uncertainty. Mark Strong as Stewart Menzies pops out of the shadows now as a silky, cynical MI6 spymaster, perhaps the only person in the British political establishment who fully appreciated Alan Turings oddity and his total genius mind.

THE IMITATION GAME meanwhile, settles for a partial appreciation. Alan Turings sexuality is mystified and marginalized, treated as an abstraction and a plot point. There is no sense that, between his chaste, intense and brief passion for Christopher Morcom and the anonymous encounter that led indirectly to his arrest, love, sex or romance played any significant part in Alan Turings life at all. Andrew Hodgess biography, threaded with quotations from Walt Whitman, gives eloquent and sensitive testimony to the contrary. For their part, the filmmakers, though willing to treat Alan Turing as a victim of bigotry and repression, also nudge him back toward the closet, imposing a discretion that is at once self-protective and self-congratulatory.

Ultimately, THE IMITATION GAME doesnt need any kind of banal catchphrases to show us that Alan Turing is a savant who sees and feels the world differently than most other people, because its there in every inch of Benedict Cumberbatchs performance, especially in the rigid way he carries himself, as if he were two sizes too big for his own body, and in his pained realisation that he can never fully decipher the code of ordinary human interaction. And Keira Knightley whos reliably more interesting as misfits and proves every bit his equal as the brilliant Joan Clarke, another societal square peg blithely unconcerned by the eras demeaning conception of womanly ability.

Top-flight craft contributions add to the overall classy feel, particularly the lush, contrasting 35mm lensing of Spanish cinematographer Oscar Faura [The Impossible], the cluttered desks and primitive computing machines of production designer Maria Djurkovic [Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy], and a piano-and-strings score by Alexandre Desplat that catches something of Alan Turings anxious, uneasy spirit and especially complex, impeccably executed and unique. The action ignites when, after two years of effort, Alan Turing invents his Enigma-busting machine, a proto-computer geared to break a code that the Nazis change every 24 hours. It's been a long time since intellectual sparring partners created such excitement onscreen. I've heard a few critics dismiss this mind-bender as hopelessly old-hat. Balderdash, I say long live retro.

Blu-ray Video Quality  With two excellent professional companies like StudioCanal and The Weinstein Company it is only natural to bring you a beautiful encoded 1080p encoded image and an equally impressive 2.35:1 aspect ratio and the transfer is totally outstanding. The picture is of a very high detailed image, black levels and shadow detail are really excellent, and an appropriate level of grain presents the viewer with a very pleasing, film-like appearance. Colours can be somewhat muted by design, but at least they are consistent and accurate throughout, especially depicting the era in the Second World War. Cinematographer by Oscar Faura works superbly well and shows off the film's Academy Award nominated production design to its fullest potential, which again faithfully recreates the look of World War II era in England. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  With two excellent professional companies like The Weinstein Company and StudioCanal it is only natural to bring you an equally impressive 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio that is a very enjoyable audio experience. Dialogue is mostly confined to the centre channel which is very clear and also very understandable throughout the film. There are a few brief scenes of war which provide some dramatic audio punch when the aircraft are in the air. Ambient sounds of rain are very realistic, and when Alan Turing's machine is turned on the surround channels give the viewer the feeling of being present at that moment in time. The wonderful Academy Award nominated original film score by Alexandre Desplat is given a wide and very pleasing audio soundstage experience. This is not quite a demonstration audio disc, but it does what it does extremely well, to really give you something truly special.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Making The Imitation Game [2014] [1080p] [2.35:1] [14:14] Here we get an in-depth look at the characters and plot of the film, and it also includes a nice background look at the real-life Alan Turing and his work on cracking the Enigma code during World War II and also featuring the people assembled to break the Enigma machine, the process of breaking the code, the repercussions of breaking the code, the consequences of Alan Turing's homosexuality and eventually his sad downfall. They talk about how the Enigma machine was a hidden secret long after the Second World War had finished. They all agree that Alan Turing was the hero of the hour, in being such a forward thinking genius and Benedict Cumberbatch felt Alan Turing had to stand up to himself, because of his past and of course helped to shorten the Second World War by of course inventing the Enigma machine. They talk about other films depicting Bletchley Park, but felt this one had to be totally different slant on the story, that gave it a much more human angle element to the film. They talk about what a wonderful script that was produced that really everyone was gripped when they read it, as normally it takes about 30 minutes reading other scripts, but this took much longer. That is why Benedict Cumberbatch was so very keen to play Alan Turing, as well as the other actors that were also very impressed by the script, as none of them could put it down. But most important they wanted the film to be as accurate historical as possible; as they know historians would soon inform them they have certain historical facts wrong, which would of cost a lot of money to film scenes again. Also very important was to get certain locations right, but one thing they could not film Bletchley Park, so they found this old RAF Bicester Bases in Oxfordshire, and luckily the surrounding buildings were ideal, but luckily they were able to film some scenes inside Bletchley Park and helped the actors to get into the spirit of the film. Because the actual Enigma had been dismantled, they had to create their own vision of the massive machine for the film, a sort of replica, and everyone felt it was near perfect compared to the real machine, but of course it would of not been possible without some expert help who knew about the real Enigma machine, which of course the replica had a fraction of the components, but despite this it actually had over 5,000 meters of electrical cables, well over 2,000 components and still felt epic in its appearance. But one thing that everyone agreed with is that they thought Benedict Cumberbatch gave a truly wonderful performance and I totally agree with that, especially in showing Alan Turing was a very complex character. But one very important aspect of the film was the clothes that Alan Turing would wear to give Benedict Cumberbatch a more authentic realistic look. So all in all this was a really fascinating look at the behind-the-scene on all aspect of the film THE IMITATION GAME and is well worth a view.

Special Feature: Alan Turing: Man and Enigma [2014] [1080p] [2.35:1] [13:51] Here we take an in-depth look at the man Alan Turing himself, and what made him such a total genius, and especially a lot of people did not know much about the life and times of Alan Turing before the film THE IMITATION GAME was ever thought of being filmed, especially as Alan Turing only lived on this planet for just 40 years and especially for the man who invented the computer, especially in the past Americans were always stating they invented the computer, and of course Alan Turing helped shorten the Second World War by two years, because as already stated he was a total genius and was not recognised at the time for building the Enigma machine, but Alan Turing was also a scientist, a philosopher, and of course an inventor, but most importantly he was totally ahead of his time. But sadly in his early youth, especially being an outsider, yet born at the heart of the British Empire at its zenith and went to the Sherborne School, that was classic English public school in the town of Sherborne, Dorset, in south-west England, and in his early youth was constantly bullied because they felt he was not like them, but when Alan Turing was 16 he met a boy called Christopher Morcom, who became his one true friend and who was also very interested in science. Christopher became Alans best friend, and probably his first big crush. But when Christopher died, which affected Alan greatly suddenly a couple of years later, Alan partly helped deal with his grief with science, by studying whether the mind was made of matter, and where and if anywhere, the mind went when someone died and of course that is why Alan named the Enigma machine Christopher in honour of his friend. They also talk about how Alan Turing who was always pushing himself to go that little bit further to solve a difficult puzzle, but of course in pursuing this outlook caused him to become a loner and especially did not like working as a team, but of course slowly over time Alan changed, but on top of all that he also hated social function, as he felt like a fish out of water, so making him like a chameleon. But also most important was his sexuality, which at the time it was illegal to be a homosexual, but despite this Alan had a strong bonded friendship with Joan Clarke. But of course when he was chemically castrated via drugs, that reduces your libido and sexual activity it really affected him greatly and especially emotionally and caused his downward spiral to deep depression and eventually committing suicide in 1954 by dipping an apple into cyanide and eating the apple, and of course it was a total shameful act by the Government at the time in what they did to this genius and if he had been able to live like he wanted he probably would of gone onto greater strides in technology, and in 2013 Alan Turing the computer pioneer and codebreaker was been given a posthumous royal pardon, which addresses his 1952 conviction for gross indecency and again who was chemically castrated. The pardon was granted under the Royal Prerogative of Mercy after a request by Justice Minister Chris Grayling and endorsed by Her Majesty the Queen. The pardon came into effect on the 24th December 2013, because many people had campaigned for many years to win a pardon for Alan Turing. But of course the film was a dedication towards the genius that was Alan Turing and of course today the majority of people have taken this genius for granted, especially in our lives today computers, tablets and smart phones would not be here today or even happen without the brilliant genius mind of Alan Turing. Once again, all in all this is a really nice special feature and again honouring a man who was so ahead of his time.

Special Feature: The Heroes Of Bletchley [2014] [1080p] [1.78:1] [7:33] THE IMITATION GAME cast and crew discuss Bletchley Park: what it would have been like to work in such an incredible place and its pivotal role in ending World War 2. They talk about the fact that Bletchley Park was a very secretive code breaking facility during the war, and the Government employed and brought these very eccentric people together under one roof who were basically a bunch of Super Heroes with special powers that other people in authority did not understand, who especially wore tank tops and tweeds. They recruited chess champions; they recruited mathematicians, who especially loved cracking puzzles, and they worked incredible long hours, and because of this, literally lived in Bletchley Park. With regards to Joan Clarke who eventually became Head of Hut 8 in 1944. Joan Clarke carried on code breaking even after the war, and went onto work at the secret GCHQ organisation and eventually was awarded the MBE in 1947 for her sterling work during the Second World War. But despite all the pressure they had put upon these special brainy people, they managed to kept up their spirits and there was also a great camaraderie atmosphere, which spearheaded the intelligence, in their endeavour to win the war. Bletchley Park went from a cottage industry to a huge industrial code breaking factory and at the start of the war housed 200 people to eventually 9,000 people, and of course one of the best kept secret of the Second World War and again helped shorten the war by two years and because they were extraordinary, and they should not be forgotten, as they were the true heroes of the war effort in thwarting the advance of the Nazi offensive. Despite this special feature being very short, it still packs a lot of information and is still very interesting in hearing their comments. Contributors include Mark Strong [Stewart Menzies], Tom Briggs [Bletchley Park Education Officer], Ian Standen [CEO Bletchley Park], Matthew Beard [Peter Hilton], Teddy Schwarzman [Producer], Matthew Goode [Hugh Alexander], Benedict Cumberbatch [Alan Turing], Maria Djurkovic [Production Designer], Victoria Worpole [Director Learning and Collections of Bletchley Park Trust], Allen Leech [John Cairncross], Keira Knightley [Joan Clarke] and Morten Tyldum [Director].

Trailers: Here you have a selection of four trailers and they are as follows: Before I Go To Sleep [2014] [1080p [2.35:1] [2:15]; RUSH [2013] [1080p] [2.35:1] [2:35]; Maltesers TV Advert [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [00:32] and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy [2011] [1080p] [2.35:1] [1:53]

Finally, THE IMITATION GAME [2014] works really well in creating a moving story about an incredible person of Alan Turing and his co-workers that did such sterling, astonishing work during the Second World War, and also a look at the tragic true real-life story about Alan Turing in showing us how a brilliant but socially inept man accomplished the impossible by breaking the supposedly impregnable ENIGMA CODE during World War II. This is a wonderful exciting film which will have viewers glued to their seats from start to finish. It is one of the best films of 2014 and this Blu-ray edition is essentially flawless and is an engrossing and poignant tour de force thriller, and Benedict Cumberbatchs excellent performance gives added complexity to a fine account of the life and times of the brilliant codebreaker Alan Turing, it also is surprisingly humorous and it also manages to nail the emotional moments in the film and deserved all the Awards and Nominations it received. Very Highly Recommended!

Alan Turing and his work get so little credit nowadays for what they did. We always see people like Churchill, Roosevelt, Eisenhower, MacArthur, etc all getting credit for what they did in the war... and no one realizes that most of what all these men did was only possible because of Turing.

6792134,4,B00PC1FD9U,"When a group of genius mathematicians are recruited by British Intelligence to break Nazi codes during WWII, we meet some intriguing personalities and the process they go through to break the unbreakable code, Enigma.  Mainly Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley).  Fabulous cast, overall, but Cumberbatch really does an awesome job as the socially inept nerd who doesn't work well with others and turns out to be gay. His journey as a gay man in some seriously homophobic times added a whole new dimension to the already interesting storyline of code-breaking. His arrogance was also his fatal flaw and I really loved that whole side of the story which explores his humanity... for better and worse.  Knightley's character, Joan, was also quite fascinating as a woman with unusual skills for her time.  I just wish more had been shown about her life as well.

6792149,4,B00PC1FD9U,"What to think of the Imitation Game, it is a good film and I recommend the movie, although do not expect a lot of glitz and glam, it is a thinking persons movie.  The film reminded me of the HBO movie Something God Made and the Russell Crow film A beautiful Mind.  All 3 movies deal with serious subject matters that have complex problems that required unique solutions.  The Imitation Game is well acted throughout the movie.  Heros are not always great human beings in this case Alan was a very fragile man with some kind of disability.  The movie made me wonder if he had some form of autism.  About half way through the film switches focus more on Alans sexuality and the fact that he was gay.

Benedict Cumberbatch is excellent in the film as the lead genius Alan Turing trying to figure out how to decode the German Enigma machine to help the allies win the war.  Alan Turing like John Nash in A Beautiful Mind is not the best people person.  Both characters know they are smart but in social situations they come across as blunt, arrogant, and  without a sense of humor.  I think this is Keira Knightleys best performance in all the movies I have seen her in as Joan Clarke.  Charles Dance of Game of Thrones fame really steals the show as the Royal Navy Commander Denniston who despises Alan but grudgingly allows him to stay on the project.  Charles has so much presence onscreen and plays that domineering role so well.  It was a little bit funny when Keira was talking about MI6 as a division of the UK that nobody has ever heard of in the film.  Obviously James Bond had not become famous yet and let the cat out of the bag.

The heart of the film is really the interaction between Alan and Joan.  Alan considers Joan his intellectual equal admires her and truly cares for her even though he denies it in the movie.  Joan on the other hand helps complete Alan she is social outgoing and helps him through his insecurities.  She is kind of like the ying to his yang.

The movie jumps back and forth from Alans childhood to the war years and then to the mid 1950s so it does get confusing at times.  But the film does come together nicely.  The film did succeed and made a good profit as an independent movie but these films are not really made to be big blockbusters anyway they are much better at storytelling and letting the audience get to know the characters and learn a little about history at the same time.

Overall I would rate this movie 4 stars it is pretty good, but definitely not for everyone.  The film tries to make it out as a happy ending when in reality he committed suicide.  Besides that fact, the movie does explain at the end how Alan Turing was basically the godfather of the modern day computer.",1475625600,,2730,4.379721669980119

6792157,2,B00PC1FD9U,"More like the irritation game. I guess the real, fascinating  history of breaking the code was too dull for the scriptwriter Graham Moore. I'm sure that after discovering Turing was a homosexual he had to make that a major plot device. After reading about the real story of cracking the enigma machine and Turinin it seems the people who make the movie decided to change it all. So basically, apart from breaking the code, virtually everything about the movie is contrived. What  a shame.  Turing wasn't the cold, lonely, unlikeable person as depicted in the film. His superior asn't a tyrant but actually liked Turing and encouraged his work on the machine. Many other falsities. Too bad.
It's sort of a watchable movie if you don't know anything about the real story. But it's obvious the moviemakes couldn't resist adding modern plot devices, especially the part about Turing's homosexuality.
When you find out they made just about everything up, it ruined it for me. Sorry. can't recommend something with so many falsehoods.",1475280000,2,1028,4.965116279069767

6792243,5,B00PC1FD9U,"GREAT MOVIE !!!  No discount given for this, I just love Benedict Cumberbatch !!!!  Kept me glued to my seat the whole time. Not just a watch movie, it makes you think while watching .  The way that I review varies with each item.  Some have so many great things that it is easy to go on and on about all of the positive things.  Others only have enough to state that they are bad.  If a review is too long people stop reading it so what is the point.  My Stars also depend on how I I like/dislike the product on my own personal level. I may also list a product as 3 stars even though I didn't like it as it may be a good product in itself for someone else.  Just because it didn't work exactly the way I wanted it to doesn't mean that it is a bad product all around.  I hope that makes sense.  I also may list something as a 5 star only to come back after a a time to update how the product is and lower the stars.  Some products seem great at first and then the more you use it the less they work, break or just all around didn't perform to my satisfaction. If my review helped you make your decision I am glad to have helped.  You can click on the yes it was helpful button but in no way am I saying that you have to.  I don't do that often myself unless I feel they really helped. Make sure to ask questions if you have any to people who have make reviews !

6792358,5,B00PC1FD9U,I've wanted to see this film for several years. Showtime provided the opportunity. It was worth the wait,1464825600,,104,4.833333333333333
6792359,5,B00PC1FD9U,Great film,1464825600,,10,4.5
6792360,4,B00PC1FD9U,"I have a degree in Computer Science, and so I remember well professors talking about Alan Turing during lectures.  I also remember ""building"" Turing Machines as well, or basically designs of a Universal Computer that would give outputs based upon some well-defined inputs.  That was ""fun.""  Well, I guess it was, once I got the hang of it.

But professors usually discussed only Mr. Turing's theories and scientific accomplishments; they rarely discussed his life.  If I were a professor, I would review all of the documentaries I could find on him, choose maybe the best couple after screenings, and then show them in class.  I think that it would've brought the point home better at really how important his contributions were to Computer Science.

When I watched this film yesterday, I considered writing a review immediately, as I loved the film at that point.  But I decided to watch a documentary or two first, which are available on Amazon Prime for free.  After all, once again, none of those professors did that for me in the past.  But none of the documentaries I've watched are very good so far, really, but they do give some interesting side information that you won't get in the film, and you will see some interviews with people that actually know what he was like.  Maybe even knew him personally.

And after seeing one gentleman discuss Mr. Turing, I decided to downgrade my review for ""The Imitation Game"" (TIG) from a 5 to a 4.  Why?  Well, there are at least two inaccuracies in the film.  And those inaccuracies actually matter:

1.  According to the documentary, Mr. Turing was actually considered a ""friendly guy, and everyone really liked him.""  In TIG, he is portrayed as the biggest egotistical and disconnected jerk in the world.  Or at least a Narcissist with Aspergers.  Well, for at least the first two acts.  (But then he becomes nice at the end, of course.)
2.  According to the documentary, Mr. Turing had no problem telling people that he was gay, even though he knew it was against the law.  In TIG, he tries to hide this fact more than the Germans try to hide their encryption keys.  Well, for at least the first two acts.

Now, from memory, at the beginning of the film, I do believe that you will read the words ""Based upon a true story,"" which automatically means that the writer and director will take liberties with the actual story.  I get it.  But I believe that the two points that I discussed above were changed to make Mr. Turing a more sympathetic character in a way, and to make conservatives look more dastardly.  Think about it.  In the film, if Benedict Cumberbatch would've walked around and told everyone, ""I'm gay!"" then the audience wouldn't be as sympathetic, because they might think that he at least brought some of the problems on himself.  At any rate, I believe that the movie has a political agenda behind it.  And when a true story is changed for political motivations, it irritates me.

But still, Mr. Cumberbatch is really good playing Mr. Turing, so all is not lost.  And Keira Knightly, contrary to comments recently made by some director that ""she's too pretty to be a good actress,"" also is very strong here.  And you will root for the ""programmers"" -- I don't know if they were called that, or even ""software engineers,"" at the time -- to solve the problem of Enigma.

Well, I'd still like to see a drama made about Mr. Turing that was actually true to the tale.  After all, as Mr. Cumberbatch says during the film, 'Well, when you listen to people talk, they don't say what they mean.  You have to decipher meaning, even in speech,"" or something along those lines.  And sometimes you have to decipher meaning in a screenplay that changes the story for political reasons.",1464825600,,3740,4.662079510703364

6792370,5,B00PC1FD9U,"While teaching a course on Operating Systems at a local college, I had the students view this movie during a lab. Several topics from the movie were directly relevant to our course (low-level structure and operating methodology of early mechanical/electrical computers, encryption issues and techniques, etc), and the focus on the life of Alan Turing and the role of computers in the society of that period provided excellent historical background.

Naturally, the movie had to take many liberties with the technical details in the interest of storytelling. One of the most glaring examples was when Turing's team hit upon the new approach to the problem. Since computers of that day were conceived, designed, and built with a specific problem in mind, it's likely that in real life it would have required some weeks of re-tooling the machine to solve the problem the new way. In the movie this was accomplished with about 10 seconds of moving wires and dials. I don't fault the movie for this; it's not intended to be a documentary after all.

Overall I really enjoyed this movie and so did my students.",1464393600,,1104,4.93010752688172

I thought this would be more exploring of the technical challenges and maybe even some remote connection to WWII but instead I got a Hollywood activist movie.

Let me start by saying I don't have any issues portraying the truth of the situation, Alan Turing is gay. However, just when you think the movie is about all the mystery and wonder surrounding what is one of times most technically challenging discovery, we are thrown into a completely different movie. Just when we start digging into the cryptography, math and tech stuff this movie makes a Bee line turn towards making a statement on how the gay life is/was back in the day and the tragedy of being gay... blah blah. Bait and switch. I can't seem to gather any qualities of what would make me want to see this again. All the actors/actresses performed well but the story direction was poor. I general felt that there was a good portrayal of the conflict that ""Alan"" was going through however this WAS the story. Everything else was a side story.

I can imagine the reaction in a room full of 13/14-year-olds during two scenes in particular: when Mr. Turning was being interrogated at the police station and during a raunchy story told at a bar. Needless to say, I'll be looking elsewhere for an EOY movie.",1462579200,,701,4.616

6792503,4,B00PC1FD9U,"A Hollywood account of the experiences of Alan Turling, widely considered to be the father of computer science, during the War War II years.  Great acting and screenplay, along with a fascinating true story makes this one of the movies that you don't want to miss.

Turling was a child prodigy in mathematics, statistics, and cryptology.  He was recruited by the Royal Navy to their project of breaking the German Enigma code.  This turned out to be one of the decisive factors in defeating the Germans.  As part of this project, Turling invented what can be considered the first binary digital computer. Because he was thoroughly un-military, his superiors tried to get rid of him, only to be countermanded by Winston Churchill himself
.
One of Turling's secrets was that he was gay.  It was illegal.at this time and place to come out of the closet, and when, after the war, he eventually did, he was prosecuted and convicted.  He was sentenced to receive ""hormone therapy"" in lieu of jail time. Because of this he eventually committed suicide by partially eating a cyanide laced apple.  He was found dead in his home, with a partially bitten apple near him. I often wonder if the logo of Apple Computer  had anything to do with this.

This movie should appeal to anyone interested in World War II, cryptology, or the history of computer science, or even if you are merely looking for a great human drama story.",1459209600,,1412,4.726530612244898

6792518,5,B00PC1FD9U,"PLOT: brilliant mathematics professor breaks the top secret German Enigma code machine~

this starts in 1951~ with flashbacks to World War 2~ Alan Turing is bizarre and brilliant~ he calls in a burglary and then wants the police to leave it alone~ his odd behavior caused detectives to discover his ""secret"" his homosexuality~ flash back to WW2~ Turning ends up a Betchley Park~ a think tank for the CODE BREAKERS of WW2 Britain.~ where a group of brilliant ""code breakers"" are working to decrypt German codes and cyphers from a coding machine called Enigma. Enigma a simple computer type machine is thought to be unbreakable. The ""odd man out' is Turning who gets along with no one and yet sets to work on an early Computer machine he calls ""Christopher"".....he manages to alienate every one of his co workers but a puzzle he designs~ brings Joan....(KEIRA KNIGHTLY) into his world~ who becomes both his friend and his ""social"" connection to other people. With plenty of drama the machine and the decoders work hard with one month to break the code~ using a daily German Weather Forecast they have the means to  daily finally BREAK the German Codes using the Computer. Along the way Turning (BENEDICT CUBERBACH) becomes engaged to Joan but confessed his secrets to her. Lots of twist and turns including spy John Cairncross who is actually one of the Cambridge Spies ...who is a double agent for Russia~ (MARK STRONG) is excellent as the MI 5 agent who will use any means to get the break the German codes. This movie won an Oscar for Best Original Screen Play~ 8 Oscar nominations.~ interesting and well acted. the tragic ending of Turning in 1951~ Homosexuality was illegal~ his sentence was to be  ""chemically castrated"" to curb his homosexual ways by injections of estrogen which in turn.... made him depressed and not able to function. He committed suicide in 1953~",1458950400,,1871,4.840625

6792521,5,B00PC1FD9U,"Not being an IT professional or well versed in the British telling of WWII history, I'm not sure if that is the reason I didn't know about Alan Turing or if it was due to the British ruling and political class (of the time)  not wanting to give him his due because of his sexual orientation.  Somehow, I suspect it is the latter.

This movie both moved and educated me.  Benedict Cumberbatch is an excellent actor and I'm enamored by just about everything he does.  The supporting cast was equally excellent and the story was laid out well.

A beautiful telling of how one gay man pretty much single-handedly turned the tide against the Germans in WWII.  We ought to be thankful.",1458777600,,679,4.516393442622951

This is conveyed very well, and leaves the viewer to ponder..what incredible things might Mr. Turing have accomplished had he lived in a more enlightened and tolerant time?",1458777600,,495,4.904761904761905

6792565,5,B00PC1FD9U,"I loved this movie. I have watched it several times. The acting is supurb, the story line compelling.  I do realize some people have issues with a few historical inaccuracies, I was not troubled by this. All movies based on true stories take  some artistic license.  For me the issue with this movie was the outstanding acting that told a very important story. This is a crucial story in the history of mathematics, but also in the history of intelligence gathering, warfare, and World War II.

Alan Turings contributions to ending World War II are hard to over state.  He and his team provided invaluable intelligence to the British intelligence services and allowed them to turn the tide of the war. And it was all done with traditional code breaking, namely the known plain text attack.  Now if that term is new to you, I suggest you do some reading on the topic, even the Wikipedia article would be a good start.

The coverage of Alan Turings childhood, while not necessarily critical to the central plot of code breaking, gives valuable insights into the person Alan Turing.  I find it helpful when movies or novels flesh out the characters giving us real insight into who they are.",1456876800,,1187,4.700483091787439

Why tarnish the reputations of real people just because a screenwriter thought it would make a better story? I don't get it!

This movie manages to accomplish several amazing feats in less than two hours. It's a history lesson on World War II, a cautionary tale about the damage that keeping secrets can wreak on a person's life, a plea for tolerance for the LGBT community and a lesson on how a disability such as autism can actually make a person exceptional, brilliant and change the course of human history. It's such an all encompassing film which touches upon so many aspects of the human experience that I believe it would be incredibly instructive if it were shown in a variety of course settings such as a history class, a class on human sexuality or one on developmental disabilities at the college level. I would highly recommend this movie to those who want to learn about the man who invented a device we all depend upon on a daily basis as well as gaining a broader perspective on how cracking the Enigma Code helped the Allies defeat Germany in World War II.",1456012800,,1169,4.488262910798122

I was unaware of the existence of the Enigma decoding team and what they accomplished in WWII (as, apparently, were most Americans), before watching this movie.  This film is exciting and mesmerizing to watch!  The acting is superb, and the casting is perfect.  Benedict Cumberbatch plays the roll of Alan Turing so perfectly as to allow the viewer to see Turing, rather than Cumberbatch-playing-Turing, which must be difficult for a popular actor.  The supporting cast members are also believable and excellent in their roles. The filming is so well done as to put the viewer in the time frame of the story, yet not detract from it.  Not knowing the history of Turing and Enigma made it even more captivating.  It also proves that a movie without sex scenes or violence (other than some war clips), can be powerful and enthralling.",1455840000,,941,4.771604938271605

Turing, the whole story, the truth has been cast aside for the sake of some other story the screenwriter and/or producers prefer. The screenplay avoids the sexual orientation issue on a personal level, on the level of the actual code breaking initiative altogether, bottom line, doesn't really have anything to say about it. It trumps up this M-6 character overriding Churchill on giving Russians any intelligence? Pretends the slow leak of information so the Germans don't find out was all Turing's idea?

Because of this film, I have conducted research into Turing's life and written a dissertation on him. From this, I have gained insight into not only an utterly brilliant man, but an extraordinarily generous one as well. I learned that Turing was a man who took everything in stride, even when he was so barbarically treated simply for being gay. The film may have its problems, but its central goal was accomplished: people like me now know who Turing was, and will never let his story of abominable abuse overshadow the one of his genius and kindness.",1454025600,,691,4.7190082644628095

Is it fair to criticize the makers of ""The Imitation Game"" for altering the story of Alan Turing, the gay, brilliant mathematician who was instrumental in cracking a Nazi code during World War II? I think it is, especially when the movie opens with the standard based on a true story tagline, and especially when the names of real people are retained.

Also, while I love Keira Knightly's character, Turing did actually have important men in his life who weren't just sexual escapades. It would have been nice to see that. Still, it's a moving story, told beautifully. As long as you don't take this as real history, it's a good film. Also, while it's true that gay men were treated abominably in England, it's not quite fair to say this is what drove him to suicide. Turing had a long fascination with suicide and finding out what is on the ""other side."" Of course, this isn't a documentary, so the filmmaker isn't obliged to make everything true in his version of the story.",1452902400,,800,4.601398601398602

  Marion Rejewski and other prominent Poles pioneered the way for the Allies. Before Poland fellsaid George Bush while addressing his huge audience in Gdansk in August 1989, on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the outbreak of World War IIyou gave the Allies Enigma, the Nazi's secret coding machine. Breaking the unbreakable Axis code saved tens of thousand Allied lives, American lives, and for this you have the enduring gratitude of the American people. And ultimately Enigma and the freedom fighters played a major role in the winning the Second World War.
  ""Actually, Turning did not invent the computer,"" Google it. Charles Babbage and John von Neumann get the lions share of the credit for inventing the modern computer, but there are others. There is a PR campaign for Alan Turning to be given credit for inventing the modern computer.
  Lastly, in the movie, when the rotors kept turning looking for the answer to that days coded message, they made it seem like all was lost at the stroke of midnight. This is not true.

There is a lot of additional information that could have been included in the film. Having read several books on the subject, and being very interested in the life of Alan Turing, I felt somewhat let down that more of his story wasn't told.

Alan Turing's remarkable life and the key role that he played in ending WWII is simply amazing. Turing was a genius pioneer of early computing technology and his efforts saved millions of lives by cracking the 'impenetrable' German codes. Had he not become involved in the breaking of the codes, the war would have had a much different ending. The world was changed forever as a result of his efforts and success at breaking the German codes.

All in all this was a fantastic film. I would recommend reading books on the life of Alan Turing if you want a more in depth experience about his life and incredible accomplishment.",1451001600,12,1030,4.622950819672131

6792727,4,B00PC1FD9U,"I enjoyed this movie despite many of the creative liberties taken.  The main reason I liked it was because it presented the core ideas behind breaking the enigma code in a very understandable and dramatic way.  Was it just a handful of people who broke enigma?  No.  Was it Turing vs. his staff in a very antagonistic atmosphere?  No.  Was there a ""eureka!"" moment where they suddenly cracked enigma in a few minutes?  No.  I get that the movie wasn't historically accurate.  But it was entertaining and dramatic.

I think to more accurately lean the events at Bletchley Park in WWII, you need to read a book on the subject, watch a documentary, or it would need to be a longer mini-series.  In the time afforded in a feature film, I think they did a good job of piecing together the main idea of ""building a machine to beat another machine.""

But come on!  Does Kira Knightley really need to be on the feature poster for the movie?  You couldn't just have Benedict Cumberbatch but you need to have a headlining female as well (although here character was fairly minor to the overall plot)?  It's not like the movie was a Molder/Sculley or Bones/Booth duo fighting the evil Nazis.  Knightley's character was just one of many.

I guess references to Turing's childhood and the police investigation are needed but they are never welcome in my opinion.

A couple of gripes I might have is: 1/ Did the Eureka moment actually take place? 2/ When Stuart Menges MI6 got the note
about Turing being investigated by the dull policeman why didn't he go an visit him and tell him Turing is a war hero and to back
off? He should have spared him the humiliation that came to him.",1447891200,,589,4.412844036697248

6792796,5,B00PC1FD9U,"A brilliant movie that was as compelling as it was hard to watch at times.  Benedict Cumberbatch once again plays a mad genius wonderfully and Kiera Knightley was also terrific in this film.  The movie is based on the life of Alan Turing, a man called upon in WW2 to help break the German Enigma machine, the machine that they used to send all of their codes and that, if broken, could help win the war for the Allies.  He ends up working at Bletchley Park with other code breakers, where he alienates them due to his lack of social skills and his insistence that he work on his own machine to help them crack Enigma.  Joan Clarke is brought in to help out and she teaches Turing how to at least attempt to act more friendly to his co-workers and, together, they build his own machine...which turns out, as we suspect, to be the first computer off of which all our modern computers are based.

The story takes place in the 1950's, where Turing is arrested for homosexuality (a crime in England at the time) with flashbacks to the 1940's and back to Turing's school days in the 1920's.  There are no easy answers in this film as, even if they break Enigma (which we all know they did from history) how and where should this information be used without giving away the game to the Germans?  Bittersweet at times, this movie was very well done and left me thinking how sad it was what happened to this man who helped save millions of lives in WW2 and why it took so long to acknowledge his contribution.",1447804800,,1500,4.374100719424461

I liked the beginning and middle and felt his struggle but the end the movie just ruined the intellectual focus of the movie by making the main point about how his life was ruined by homosexual treatments after being caught doing homosexual acts. I think he was more miserable because he was a jerk. Although the historical aspects of the end may be true and terrible, I wish they would have made a different movie focusing on the ill-treatment of homosexuals and had this movie instead focus on his brilliant intellectual findings and how he saved so many lives by ending the war.

6792828,1,B00PC1FD9U,"This movie is not factual but embellished Alan Turning as the sole ""geniue"" that cracked the enigma code. In reality his machine ( which was really called Bombe) would have not been able to crack the code without the help of William Gordon Welchman. Welchman made a very significant contribution to reducing the number of possibilities that had to be considered by the Bombe and greatly enhanced its usefulness. This movie however gives all the credit to Turning and even removed Welchman completely from the story. All this so they can elevate the Turning's role and because of his ""difference"" tying it to his homosexuality. A more accurate rendering of the historical accomplishments of cracking the Enigma can be found at http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Welchman.html

The Imitation Game easily passes these tests and though everybody knows the outline of the story, it's still quite interesting and suspenseful.

As for being true to the facts, I can guess that some things here did not happen exactly as shown.  The thing that seemed odd to me was Turing being interviewed by the police and recounting his true story, which I presume would still have been prohibited by the Official Secrets Act.

6792902,2,B00PC1FD9U,"If movie producers want to prop up homosexual role models, at least be more open about it  instead of luring people into watching historical movies that  bring in their propaganda by stealth. I read that the gay mathematical wizard who helped crack the Enigma code in WWII had better relationships with the people around him than the movie depicted, and that he was generally well liked in real life. Even though homosexuality was illegal in England at the time, his colleagues knew. Also, as I watched the film, Alan Turing  appeared to have a form of autism we now diagnose as Asbergers, which I would attribute to his lack of connection with people and his inappropriate responses. Through the use of flashbacks, they try to attribute his awkwardness and tortured relationships to the fact he knew he knew from youth that he was gay. The reviews only focus on his groundbreaking work, but the true intent of the story is obvious once one watches it. .

However, somewhere toward the end of the movie, the focus started transitioning toward an emphasis on a purportedly disadvantaged lifestyle (Alan Turing was a homosexual).

Admittedly I have recently come out of the closet, openly expressing my distaste for Turing and his ilk's lifestyle (I've been indiscriminately and inaccurately labeled ""homophobic"" for expressing those Constitutional rights). Nonetheless that distaste has absolutely nothing to do with my low rating. We simply feel it was uncalled for to launch what we perceived, as well as many we've spoken with, was a social platform shifting the emphasis from the original historically significant storyline to focusing on that lifestyle. In other words the sequence of events seemed to have culminated in a sociopolitical agenda and underlying statement for the entire movie.

Regardless, from a historical perspective, and despite what many of us felt was a ""distracting"" and needless ending which really had nothing to do with the original storyline (consistently, efficiently and expediently deciphering the Enigma), ""The Imitation Game"" is well worth watching.",1444176000,,1331,5.751269035532995

6792935,5,B00PC1FD9U,"Cumberbatch is well on his way to becoming the finest actor of his generation - and that's saying a lot, because there are some great young actors out there (Tom Hiddleston springs to mind, for example). This telling of the story of Alan Turing, who was largely responsible for developing the computer that cracked the German Enigma code, is a tour-de-force performance that gives a rounded account of a man who was at once irritating, brilliant, nave, socially inept, and appealing. Keira Knightley is less convincing as the only female member of Turing's entourage, but Cumberbatch's performance is such that we're carried along despite the occasional casting infelicity.

While it's undoubtedly true that this film deviates in a major way from the historical record and also gets much of the technical aspect quite wrong (for example it makes the Bombe non-functional until a chance discovery of a repeated phrase reduces the calculations required, whereas in fact the phrases were already known and integral to the design of the computer) and also relies on a stock idea of the general incompetence of the British officers tasked with the project. But all these infelicities are conveyed nicely - not overplayed, not glossed over. And the nature of Turing's inner pain is wonderfully conveyed, not least by the actor who plays Turing as a young boy. So we can forgive the inaccuracies and appreciate the art. This isn't Turing's life, it's a drama in which only the names remain the same. And as drama it is excellent.

In short this is a marvelous movie and worth watching more than once to catch nuances and subtleties that might slide past on first viewing.",1444003200,4,1664,4.960573476702509

6792945,3,B00PC1FD9U,"I thought it was an ok movie. It was well acted and brought forth a mostly unknown or forgotten part of the winning of WW2 for the allies.

I did have some problems though, that keep me from giving it too high of a grade:

1. The brilliant cryptographers did not understand the utterly basic concept in the field, that already known words make a code much more easy to break, and instead had to be led there by a women in the typing pool in a pub telling a story for a cinematic ""EUREKA!"" moment.
2. The whole gratuitous and utterly fictional ""fierce feminist"" portrayal of Joan Clarke, specifically the scene with the man not even looking at the list where ""Joan Clarke"" would be and instead assuming no woman could possibly be invited....
3. The notion that Alan and Joan would have to school British Intelligence MI6 how not to rush in and use the now decoded Enigma information and tip off the Germans that their machine had been compromised, or that the Admiral would not possibly understand that concept. It is pretty common in Intelligence to try to keep the fact that you have broken a code secret for as long as possible, and not something invented by Alan and Joan.
4. Total historical inaccuracies and fabrications. Most notable was the omittance that Polish Intelligence had already mathematically mapped out the variables and had built a machine to break the enigma, and for a period were decoding and reading German Enigma messages. The Germans however, added another cog to the machine, and before the Polish could solve the new configuration the Germans invaded and conquered Poland. Turing and the others all had access to the information about the polish machine and the mathematical computations, so they were not starting from scratch. So obviously Turing did not invent the concept of making a machine to break the code, and the ""idea"" of building such a machine would not have been seen as some sort of ""lunacy"" by the other brilliant people working on the project, who had this information from Polish Intelligence as well.

I understand the need to make it theatrical, and Turing's accomplishment was great indeed, but why not go with the truth when the truth is more than enough to earn our admiration?

I found myself oddly thinking of Ted Kaczynski in the aftermath of this movie. How much in common he and Turing were in many ways. Brilliant minds, Educated at the prominent schools of their respective countries (Harvard, Cambridge), introverted, sensitive, ""odd""/different children bullied cruelly by their intellectually inferior peers during their formidable years. Latent, repressed homosexuality. Pushed out of their professions. They are in many ways mirror images, with the tragic end result being remarkable similar in most regards, but drastically different in that Turing did not lash out at others...",1443657600,2,2840,4.922755741127348
6792946,5,B00PC1FD9U,"The Imitation Game is the story of the man who broke the German code and helped to shorten the war.

6792992,5,B00PC1FD9U,"Yes, I love this film, which was the definition given to this full five-star rating.  But it really is not among the greatest films made.  Nevertheless, it is an important film on many levels.  Benedict Cumberbatch, who plays the real-life lead character, Alan Turing, is a wonderful actor who can expect an important career because of his talent, technique, intelligence and appearance.  The overall treatment of the film is first rate: direction, set design, cinematography. cast. writing, etc.  The subject is immensely important for its documentation of computer science, history, war and sexuality..  The world needs to understand how crucial Turing and his achievements were to the world, its essential contribution to the development of computers and artificial intelligence.  It is sad that the general public has no idea of Turing's and his group's critical part in winning World War II and ending it earlier than it might have been, saving many, many lives.. The world needs to fully comprehend the cruel treatment of Turing because of his homosexuality, and the history of tragic attitudes toward and treatment of homosexuals.  History and public attitudes have, to a great extent, finally and significantly accepted homosexuality as part of the human situation, although much more needs to be done.  And the public needs to know more about the cruelty society has heaped on many of our fellow human beings because of that.  I fear the film will be perceived only as really good entertainment, but not for trying to document a vital and revolutionary step in civilization.  This is partly because the general public is not very savvy or awake to the significance of Turing, his life and his work.  I know much about Turing, but not enough to be sure how accurate the film is.  I suspect there was a lot of fictionalizing that may have failed to capture the true and astounding story..  The film should be part of education curriculum for young people with appropriate clarification on accuracy along with elaboration on Turing's spectacular contribution to science.",1443139200,,2076,5.103550295857988

Democrats MAKE A LIVING from this sort of propaganda. Lovers of fleshly indulgence pay millions to assure that Dems will pave their way with rose petals. Plain and simple and it really is a crime. One of many that Dems are guilty of. Selling America out and planting seeds of rot.

6793100,5,B00PC1FD9U,"Wonderful film!  Superb acting by Cumberbatch.  What I liked most: 1) solving the Enigma Code is just a part of the issue; what to do with the solution is so much more morally and strategically complex than the actual ""solution""; 2) Cumberbatch as Turig manages to make others think he is ""monstrous"" (in multiple ways) when in fact his grasp of the totality of the war effort and his relationship with the Keira Knightly figure is so much more complex and truly more caring and moral than anyone suspects, including her character; 3) the attempt of the Knightly character to offer Turig/Cumberbatch a relationship that was extra-ordinary was wonderful, even though she does not realize that his rejection of it and her was to save her, not himself.  The agonies that Cumberbatch/Alan Turig was made to suffer and the a pawn he was made into in the game of war and espionage, not to mention a hetero-normative society, is truly ""monstrous.""  I 'suppose' it took all the way until 2013 for him to receive a posthumous ""pardon"" from Queen Elizabeth II due to the classified nature (for 50 years) of his work. But I suspect it took all that time from his suicide in the 1950s until 2013 because British society was so able to accept his extraordinary qualities.",1441670400,,1258,4.730593607305936

6793141,4,B00PC1FD9U,"'The Imitation Game', starring Benedict Cumberbatch as computer-inventor Alan Turing, is Oscar bait. It also happens to be a fine film on its' own merits.

The film opens in 1951 with Manchester police arriving at Alan Turing's flat, to compile data about a theft Turing suffered. But Turing will have none of it, which piques an Inspector's interest, so he goes to work digging up dirt about Turing's past.

When Inspector Nock enquires about Turing's WW2 duties, he discovers nothing. Not 'nothing' as in mediocre, run-of-the-mill. 'Nothing' as in 'zilch, zero, nada'. Turing has a manila envelope with nothing in it at all.

Flash back to 1939, the 1st year of Britain's involvement in WW2. Alan arrives at Bletchley Park, summoned there by its' head. He's cold, rude, & generally standoffish, which makes the Commander annoyed. But as one of the best mathematical minds in Britain, he can't be turned away.

And so begins the tragic, triumphant story of Alan Turing's life. It's told in an intersecting series of flashbacks: Alan as a socially-awkward pre-teen (played amusingly well by Alan Lawther), in love with his best friend Christopher (Jack Bannon); Turing building 'Christopher' (a 'universal digital computer') during the war years at Bletchley Park, fighting both his own superiors & his co-workers for his obsession; Turing, accused of homosexuality by the Manchester Police, relating his memories to Inspector Nock.

There are others who play a role in Turing's life: Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley), another math genius recruited thru a newspaper ad, & Hugh (Matthew Goode) is the rather handsome cad amongst Turing's cadre of geniuses. Knightley especially shines, as the improbably pretty co-worker, who becomes engaged to Alan so that she can remain at Bletchley.

But it's Cumberbatch's interpretation of the difficult genius Turing that truly impresses. Cumberbatch first attained fame as the title character in 'Sherlock'; here he plays a sort of real-life version of that character. A long-time gay-rights ally, in 'The Imitation Game' Cumberbatch gets to proclaim his polemic of gay equality to the world. Keeping the dark hair acquired during his filming of 'Sherlock' (though much shorter in 'The Imitation Game'), Cumberbatch's quirky looks & lovely rich voice do justice to the memory of unjustly accused Turing.

Truly a tour-de-force performance, in a film full of them. See 'The Imitation Game' & understand what led to the invention of the computer you're currently reading this on.",1441411200,,2514,5.27

The story is well told and the movie is quite suspenseful, as well as inspiring, given the dedication of the characters working in obscurity to try to not only break the Nazi code, but to afterwards conceal what had been done so that the Nazis would not change their code and so that  false information could be fed to the Nazis.  Alan Turing's work and leadership at cracking the Nazi codes during WWII saved probably thousands of lives.  Turing also is considered the father of modern computing.  Cumberbatch does a masterful job portraying this complex man, who was later charged with homosexuality, which was illegal in Britain.  Turing was offered imprisonment or chemical castration, and chose the latter.  Turing died at age 42 of cyanide poisoning,  which was ruled a suicide.  In his shortened life, Turing had a significant impact on WWII, and his work lay the groundwork for modern computing.",1441238400,,951,4.968354430379747

I though both lead actors delivered a professional, effective but not exceptional job - same with the supporting cookie-cutter roles.  The lead male seems to have very few facial expressions in his arsenal.  All roles were pretty trite to be honest.

6793279,4,B00PC1FD9U,"An investigation for a burglary leads British authorities to question and arrest Alan Turing on charges of gross indecency and subsequently prosecuting him of homosexuality. Unknown to them, Alan Turing along with a group of men had helped cracked the Enigma code, a system which had helped the German army communicate. Alan Turing can be called the father of modern day computing. The film alternates between the past, and the present, between Turing's life as a school kid to the last days of the war and how he helped the allies change the course of the war with his deciphering of the enigma code. The movie works on all levels because it is based on a real story and events. The filmmakers have created some incredible moments, not to mention the amazing direction by  Morten Tyldum. Benedict Cumberbatch is great as Turing but I thought the show also belonged to the the supporting cast, especially Keira Knightley.

The acting is first rate, especially by Benedict Cumberbatch (Turing), Keira Knightly (Turing's fiance Joan Clarke) and Mark Strong (Stewart Menzies).  Because of their acting and this story, this is a totally believable account of the decryption of Germany's secrets.

I just wish the story was a little less about the main character being gay and a little more on the impact of Enigma and/or the larger plight it took to resolve the issue. Without seeing it as it happened, the entire story plays out over years in a small 2 hour window.  I know a lot of movies are like that, I just don't think they gave the impact it had over the war.  I supposed it had to happen the way it did to give closure to the end of the movie.  Probably didn't want to list at the very end why he died without touching base on it.

Inaccurate, the dude (Turing) didn't commit suicide, he died accidentally from playing around w cyanide.

6793314,5,B00PC1FD9U,"Being a math major and in the tech business, I've known about Alan Turing for a long time. Most people don't, though, and this is a good introduction to perhaps his most important contribution to society. He drove the effort that cracked the Enigma code machine, and saved many lives in WWII.

I remember when I heard that Benedict Cumberbatch was cast as Turing, and I felt the same way I did when Alan Rickman was cast as Snape - delight at a perfect casting. Cumberbatch pulls it off too, striking just the right chord for the aloof but brilliant and obsessive Turing.

I was surprised that the movie also covered the effort to use the decoded Enigma transmissions carefully, so the Germans would not realize the machine was compromised. If you've ever read Neal Stephenson's Cryptonomicon, it goes over this effort in a lot of detail. This was apparently one of the areas where the movie took some liberties with the real story, but such changes to spiff up the film are mercifully modest.",1439769600,,993,4.668571428571428

Turing was another victim, another fallen star (Wilde among other ones) of the Victorian Ages, which makes me remind the famous Einstein's statement. ""It's much more easy to destroy an atom instead a prejudice.""

I cried at the end of this movie, and felt that anyone who is about turning back in time and making being gay ""illegal,"" needs to watch this. Human stories matter, and this movie captures Turing's humanity brilliantly.

The one challenge to watching this movie was that it frequently flipped between a young Turing, the WW2 Turing, and a 1950's Turing. One had to watch closely to figure out where the story was at times.

What an unfathomable outrage for anyone to have been treated as Turing was, never mind the fact that he was one of the most influential people in history, in mind and in deed. The film certainly takes a fair number of liberties with history, but it is sympathetic to the reality while providing excellent drama, with some magnificent performances. Not just the leads, who are rightly hailed in their roles, but even smaller parts such as Stewart Menzies. The cinematography, score and pacing were all in fine aid of the drama. Highly recommended, if just as heartbreaking as I anticipated.",1438819200,,731,4.7637795275590555

6793475,5,B00PC1FD9U,"Saw this film in theaters, and it widened my eyes drastically to the legendary story of Alan Turing's work during World War II, which wasn't declassified until the 1990s, meaning his great work was left in the dark and forgotten for since the Allies beat the Axis Powers.  Just because he was a homosexual, in the post-war years he was left persecuted by the English government that he so desperately protected, forced to take hormone therapy to suppress his homosexual desires.  Turing's eccentrical ingenious personality is portrayed by brilliant actor Benedict Cumberbatch, star of the hit British contemporary TV series ""Sherlock,"" and an actual relative of Alan Turing himself.  His performance is so powerful you get tears in your eyes, and apparently Cumberbatch even broke down in tears after he was done filming b/c he became so attached to the role.  Keira Knightley plays Joan Clarke, a brilliant woman whom Turing hires to join his top secret team of code-breakers at Bletchley Park, and when she is asked to come home to her parents b/c she's nearly 30 without a husband, Turing knows he can't do the job without so he proposes despite the truth that he is in fact a homosexual, and though there is little sexual attraction between the two, the romantic relationship they share based on an intellectual level is greatly inspiring.  The conflict in the story is deciphering a Nazi code called ""Enigma,"" that the Germans use to send coded messages back and forth, however the greatest obstacle is that every night at midnight the settings on the typewriter-like Enigma device reset, so each day of cryptoanalysis work is all a waste and has to be trashed just to begin again every day.  Turing figures out the problem: they're humans trying to crack a machine, therefore he designs and builds the first machine to crack a machine, which, of course, everybody believes to be truly absurd, but in the end he proves to be correct, and his machine, he dubbed ""Christopher,"" turns out to be the first prototype of the modern day computer.  Due to all his hard work, his team alone secretly become the ones to turn the tides of the war, and without their top-secret efforts World War II may have been won by the Axis Powers.  This is by far one of my most favorite and cherished movies, because the noble theme is truly a brilliant one that reminds all outsiders and outcasts to remember that ""sometimes it's the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.""",1438473600,,2496,4.774941995359629

If you are a fan of Benedict, Kiera, WW2 history, and/or math and tech stuff - you will probably enjoy this movie. It's not a thriller or adventure movie.

6793542,3,B00PC1FD9U,"Awesome movie... until you get to the part where it turns into a documentary on gays.  My suggestion: stop watching when the war ends, and you'll get a wonderfully made movie about WWII, and not gay rights in England. Not too happy with how misleading this movie was.  ""Now that we have your attention let me quickly throw in something about gay people's oppression...""
If it wasn't for that it would have received 5 stars.

**No, I am not against gay people.  Nor do I care if you're gay/straight/hippie/blue/pink/alien...  I just don't like the fact this movie was used to quickly give me a lesson on gay rights (or lack there of) in England during WWII.",1437955200,,656,4.620689655172414

6793582,5,B00PC1FD9U,"Absolutely amazing movie. Cumberpatch & Goode exemplify fine British acting and you won't be disappointed. To think that this man broke the German Enigma code is brilliant on its own but the way his life meshed into that makes this a movie everyone should see. He gave 150% and received 0% from the British government because he was gay. He and his team saved millions of British & American lives and shortened WWII by 2 years and for his government to focus on his being gay and destroy it for him reveals the blindness within all governments and the expendability of people. I'm buying several code breaking books now because my curiosity about this whole episode and how it changed the world is fascinating. Oh, another point we Americans tend to keep to ourselves because we consider ourselves the best in the world (ha) ... this man was the father of what we now call computers. Intelligent machines.

6793649,3,B00PC1FD9U,"I really loved the detail on Enigma and the challenges/struggles they went through to break it. I feel like the end buried the lead when they turned a good WWII story into a story of homosexuality. If they had gone that angle the whole film, then that would have been what it was, and the viewer would not have had different expectations. But to lull the viewer into a ""this is a piece about how Enigma was cracked"" to ""this is a film about how Enigma was --- oh wait, this is a film about persecution of the homosexual"" felt like a bait and switch. Personally, I feel like whatever the focus is on a film, just be that. Don't emphasize something different 75% into the film. Just my opinion.",1437436800,,692,4.3307692307692305

6793657,2,B00PC1FD9U,"Really?! I read all the glowing reviews, so I thought I'd give this movie a try. Cumberbatch is sensational, but beyond that the movie is worse than dull. I suppose if you think about it, how could the story about a team of scientist trying to decode secret codes be anything but dull?

The poorly written screenplay meanders painfully along desperately trying to find something....anything interesting to latch onto.  I got the distinct impression that several scenes may have been made up the night prior to shooting hoping to add some watchability to this dreadful mess.

So, what are we to make of all the glowing reviews, all the awards and accolades this movie has received. I think it has more to do with the fact that Alan Turing (the main real life character) was a homosexual. It's a popular topic right now so naturally anything involving it will be given high marks. Much higher than deserving in this case. So, why did I give this movie two stars instead of one?  Because, Cumberbatch is sensational. Overall the movie was dull, plain and simple",1437350400,,1058,4.733695652173913

It was a large typewriter, with keys, and they called it ""The Enigma"".  Only four machines had been made, and only four men had been trained to work together as two teams, and know how to operate that magnificent machine. Just to let you in on a little trivia: Julius Caesar was given credit for creating the first  ""secret  code"", and he trained only a handful of men that  he knew he could trust.  It was called  the Caesars Box. College students over the year would cheat by sending a Caesars Box, of the correct  answers to an upcoming test, to fellow students.  Cool, huh?

6793755,4,B00PC1FD9U,"GREAT MOVIE IF YOU IGNORE HISTORY

This is a great movie if you completely detach the story from history. It's interesting. It's entertaining. It's well made. The problem is that the movie is about history. So changing the details isn't really okay.

The major themes of the movie were accurate. Alan Turing was a major part of the British effort to break the Nazi Enigma codes during World War II. He was gay, which was a major problem in the 1940's, forcing Turing to hide the truth. He was eventually found out and was forced into a chemical castration program. He later killed himself, probably as a result. These elements make up the major duel story. (The first part being the cryptography effort. The second part being Turning dealing with his secret.)

But when it comes down to the details the film makers took a lot of liberties for the sake of making a more entertaining movie. I know it's more interesting if the entire Third Reich is brought down by a small group of math nerds working out of an old warehouse. Everyone loves a David vs Goliath story. The problem is that the code breaking effort was not a few rag tag brainiacs. It was the single biggest non military effort in the entire war. There were groups like Turing's in England, Russian, and the United States all working on hacking the Enigma (as well as the Japanese Purple machine, which had the same purpose in the Pacific). All of these groups were contributors to the code breaking. Turing was a huge part of it and deserves recognition, but he's not the end all be all god of cryptography that he's made out to be here.

As a history buff those sort of changes bother me. I understand that these changes make for a better movie. I also understand that you cant' show everything exactly as it occurred or a movie about WWII would be 6 years long. So I get small changes for story telling purposes. That's why I still like this movie despite all that. I just don't like historical figures represented in a completely different light.

There are a handful of documentaries about Turning's actual contributions to the war effort and dozens of websites devoted to the whole story. All of that is worth watching/reading. It's all very interesting. If you enjoyed this movie you owe it to yourself to learn the real facts behind the whole code breaking operation because it's actually even more interesting than in the movie.

If you already know the history of code breaking, this movie is still worth watching. Like I said it's a good movie. Just don't expect to get a documentary on Alan Turing. Watch it without history in mind.",1437004800,6,2605,4.615550755939525

6793873,5,B00PC1FD9U,"Benedict Cumberbatch knocks it out of the park again in his portrayal of tragic hero Alan Turing, British codebreaking (and possibly Aspergers) genius now credited with shortening World War II by years who was afterwards arrested for gross indecency (code for being gay) and given the choice of prison or chemical castration.  Kiera Knightly is also unusually good as the only woman on the team of brilliant nerds on this top secret project.  The film moves between three time periods.  First, the war years when Turing struggles to convince his team of the validity of his machine (a precursor of the modern computer) and then struggles with his team to protect their work from higher ups impatient for results.  Second, there are flashbacks to his youth at private school where he did not fit in and was tormented, but did have one important relationship.  And finally, the flash-forwards to the police investigation after the war when his code work was still held secret.  The film is totally engrossing.",1436745600,,1007,4.964285714285714

6793907,5,B00PC1FD9U,"A top-notch, brilliant mathematician, Alan Turing, had a predilection and an arch desire to solve puzzles and complicated, challenging problems. He and his colleagues at Bletchley Park in Cambridge were working to decipher encrypted German communications code (WWII). Miss Joan Clarke was selected, based on her exceptional aptitude test scores, to work with the team. She was the only female permitted into the program at the time. Alan and Joan become engaged and planned to get married. There was a glitch. With ambivalence, Alan informed her that he was gay, she dismissed his admission and wanted to believe his sexual orientation was inconsequential. They were totally in love with each other, but it was more cerebral than physical. He made an unselfish attempt to end their relationship, so that she could go on to a compatible love she deserved. She remained obdurate in her wish to marry and tried to convince him they could make it work. Keira Knightley conveyed with felicity and such empathy the emotions that Joan must have felt. It's agonizingly beautiful, if only it had a happier ending! The film was nominated for eight Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actress for Keira's performance.",1436486400,,1228,5.145

6793919,5,B00PC1FD9U,"I used to teach computer related history at a university.  I loved teaching about Alan Turing because he knew that humans alone could not break a computer generated enigma code.  He knew he would have to build his own computer specifically designed (programmed) to break the enigma code. Add to that, that he did this during WWII when computer technology was in its infancy.  He was a genius who was way ahead of his time.  While I have always thought his personal life was sad and tragic (he was a victim of society at that time), nothing could erase the beauty and pure genius of this amazing man.  The movie was fairly factual but not boring.  You do not have to be a computer geek to really enjoy the movie (or so, others have told me).  I thought the pace was pretty good and the viewer is not bogged down with too much detail regarding such a complex operation.  This is a ""thinking"" movie, however, so it is not fluff, or romantic, or funny.  It is just a very good movie about a true event and a very real man.  I had to give it 5 stars because the script and the acting were both excellent.  And, maybe because I am a computer geek.",1436400000,,1141,4.285046728971962

6793954,3,B00PC1FD9U,"The Imitation Game, 2014 film

This is a slick and polished product, like some TV advertisement for a product you don't need. History is found in books, movies provide entertainment. This story starts in 1951 Manchester England. A man is held in a police station, another man talks to him. Earlier two policemen enter Turings home; he reported a robbery but nothing is missing. [Note his arrogance.] Then its wartime in 1939, British children are being evacuated to the country. Alan goes to Bletchley Park. Their aerials are explained by their radio manufacturing. He is a mathematical prodigy but doesnt speak German. He is good at puzzles and like solving problems. They show the Enigma cyphering machine. The Germans change the key every day. Sir Stewart Menzies is in charge of MI-6. All German messages are sent by radio in code. Alan plans a machine that can decipher all messages every day. [Polish military developed a bombe years earlier, but they had limited assets.]

Turing wants this machine to replace human labor. Churchill backs his idea. At school he was harassed cruelly. There is a puzzle in the newspapers to identify talented people. The Blitz causes people to seek shelter Underground. Miss Clark is a candidate, she tested well. She has doubts but they are resolved. Britain was vulnerable by its food supply, U-boats sank freighters. Some of his co-workers complain. Alan visits Miss Clarke for advice. Can a Universal Computing Machine act as an electronic brain? There is a leak, a Soviet spys messages were intercepted! One clue in deciphering messages is that any letter cannot be encrypted to itself. Solving Enigma messages requires all the help Alan can get, he must be liked by his team. He makes a joke. One has a suggestion to improve speed. The machine starts processing to calculate the Enigma key settings for the day. Does it work now? Alans co-workers stand up for him when his efforts are questioned. One month.

Back to 1951 the police find the man who burglarized Alans home, but this reveals a crime by Alan! Miss Clarks parents want her home. Is there a logical solution to this problem? In the lunchroom his coworkers laugh at a dirty joke. [Unbelievable with ladies present.] Alan asks a coworker for advice. [Nobody jitterbugs at that dance?] Can a machine think? No, it responds the way it was programmed and cannot generate new ideas. Does working together result in romances? [Yes and no.] Helen has a clue! [In reality the Wehrmacht messages always began with Heil Hitler, a clue to decipherment.] The machine runs until it stops with a solution. Alan copies the key. The Enigma machine decodes the intercept. They rejoice! Can they warn that convoy? There would be a cost to this. [This is really a higher level decision, as with Coventry.] There is a personal interest. [The convoy system grouped freighters together so destroyers could guard them.] Will statistics be used to manage the war? ULTRA was the name for this secret. A coworker has a Bible; he offers Alan a deal. Denniston knows how to manage things. Alan breaks up with Joan. So what? Joan knows what she wants. The intelligence they supplied helps to win the war (it is a force multiplier). There is Victory in Europe! All records will be destroyed to keep the secret. [In reality the decoders had new messages to decrypt.] Back to 1951 Alan is arrested and given hormonal treatments instead of prison. He becomes emotional when Jane visits. In 1954 Alan died a suicide. He was given a posthumous royal pardon in 2013. The ULTRA operation shortened the war and saved millions of lives. The ULTRA secret was revealed 25 years after the war ended. It allowed the XX Committee to function efficiently.

This is a fictionalized and dramatized story about the ULTRA system and the use of a machine-generated encryption system. There are history books that will tell you more.",1436313600,,3889,4.8700906344410875

I never heard of this machine this was kept a secret all these years , wonder what other secrets from the war have yet to be told. It sad to think that people almost 47,000 from 1860's to 1950,s  were imprisoned or chemical castrated because of who they were what an injustice.

6793975,5,B00PC1FD9U,"This movie is about Alan Turning, an English mathematician who was greatly responsible for the Allies winning WWII.  One of the fathers of modern computing, Turning created a computer that was capable of deciphering German military messages that were coded by the Enigma machine, a machine that had the capability of producing millions upon millions of code possibilities.  Before Turning, the British unsuccessfully had been trying to break Enigma by hand, an impossible task since the code was changed every day.  Turning's computer was able to break the code within a matter of minutes, however, which turned the tide in the Allies' favor.  That's not the end of the story, however.  It is the way the information was used, its long term implications, and the tragic convoluted reasons most of us were never taught about this brilliant man in our history classes (things I will not reveal here) that make it a story worth knowing.",1436054400,,933,4.993548387096774

I should have realized because it's a movie, not a documentary, but I watched it because I was writing a paper on Alan Turing and it was a little disappointing to see some of the sadder facts of his life distorted so much.  That said, great movie!  The plot was interesting, plenty of action and it moved along and who doesn't love Benedict Cumberbatch??

I actually got to watch him in Sherlock first, and loved his humor. I was finally ready to order this online. WOW!  To say that this is a good movie, is an understatement. On a human level, all you want to do is hug his character.  Keira Knightley played a perfect female that wanted to do more than just TYPE and transcribe, in a man's world.

6794029,4,B00PC1FD9U,"This dramatization of Alan Turing's work on the Enigma code during WWII interweaves two other time periods into the story, his youth in boarding school and the post war period where he was arrested and convicted of homosexuality.  The story itself is dramatic, the acting is good, and the film is very well done.  Also, Turing is too little known outside of academic circles.  The youth sequences were presumably included to explain Turing's being a loner who was deeply distrustful of other men.  This, presumably is why he is willing to bond with the woman he picked to join the team,  Even so, I found it implausible that such a self-sufficient loner would feel the need to work with anyone.  Because the woman's intellectual contribution to the project remains unclear--she is supposed to be the glue that helps Turing work with others--I found her role a bit patronizing.  This said, Keira Knightly adds a lot to the film.  By the film's end, it has turned into a brief for homosexual rights.",1435536000,,997,4.7894736842105265

6794131,4,B00PC1FD9U,"Why are so many people getting themselves into a frenzy over 'Enigma' a previous film dealing loosely with this story?' That film was written and acted like a '40's style, tongue in cheek adventure. It was highly entertaining, and not intended to be anything more than that. The Imitation Game is an entirely different style of film altogether. You can't compare the two. It's a solid, good looking, well told drama, but I thought it wasn't bold enough to really sizzle. Benedict Cumberpatch squints and squirms, and chews up the scenery, and consequently, Keira Knightly steals the film. It's very enjoyable, gripping and ultimately very touching, but with such an incredible story to tell about a deeply complex, brilliant man,I would have liked a bit more bite to the screenplay.",1435190400,2,782,5.023076923076923
6794132,3,B00PC1FD9U,"Not a bad film.  A bit over-hyped though for anyone who's actually studied Turing and his accomplishments.  As in the case of so many films ""based on factual events,"" the writers and director used a LOT of fictional license, and in a sense, used it to promulgate a political agenda about gay rights.  Caveat:  I am for equal rights for everyone, but take issue when a film purports to be something that it is not, especially when historic facts are played with (a perfect example is U-571).

All evidence points to the conclusion that Alan Turing died from potassium cyanide poisoning due to his spoon electroplating hobby.  He would eat an apple every night before bed, would never finish it and would leave the remaining portion on an end table (he had many compulsions).  Despite what the movie would make you think, he did NOT poison himself, did NOT commit suicide and according to his mother and everyone he knew, was NOT suffering from depression and was actually in a good state of mind when his death occurred.  Passing on the dangers of electroplating spoons must not have sent a strong enough message for the director to run with.

I suppose what made me do a double-take was when the movie ended and it became a film about gay rights instead of a war drama which it was pretty much about up until the last 3 minutes.  It was like war movie... war movie... war movie... OKAY, GAY MOVIE!  The ending seemed to be a bit out of context.

Overall, I thought the film was good.  It was worth the price of a rental, but I'm glad I didn't pay to see it in a theatre.  If you're intrigued about the man, read about the kind of anti-social genius he was was in a book.  It'll be much more rewarding.",1435190400,,1701,4.441935483870968

6794146,5,B00PC1FD9U,"The film. a true 'WW.2' story is told from flashbacks to both childhood and to his involvement in the war effort by mathematician
'Alan Turin' (Benedict Cumberbatch)
At the height of the war 'Alan' is recruited by the British Government to join a team attempting to break the coding system of the
unbreakable machine that, on a daily basis changes it's settings and relays messages to the entire German-War-Machine - The
Enigma Machine.
'Alan' is a no-nonsense sole with an obsession for difficult puzzle solving, but has no apparent sense of humour,his abrasive an arrogant personality rubs many in authority up the wrong way, including the commander at Bletchley Park Cyber Centre 'Command Denniston' (Charles Dance) who doesn't like 'Alan' at all, though other than the Commander it is realized that with 'Alan' in tow, it was
the best and probably the only chance they had of cracking the impossible puzzle.
'Alan' wants 100,000 to build a machine to take on the Enigma puzzle, his theory machine versus machine, it's a lot of money, he'll
have to convince those in high places.
'Alan' who is almost impossible to work with is given control of the operation, he wants to choose his own team setting a difficult test
for prospective recruits, 'Joan Clarke' (Keira Knightley) one of those chosen, she will prove a sole-mate in many ways for the loner.

The operation is top-secret, 'Alan' will not only have to keep his task at Bletchley a secret but also his own sexuality, the latter, neither
accepted or tolerated back then.
The team portrayed in this drama, by solving the complicated coding system of the Enigma-Machine, almost certainly shortened the war,
by maybe two years or more and in the process saved millions of lives.
The work of the team and indeed that of 'Alan Turin' remained one of the least recognised achievements of the second World-War until
relatively recent times.....they were indeed 'The Unsung Heroes'
'Benedict Cumberbatch' puts in one hell of a performance............maybe not the most exciting film you'll ever watch, however it's certainly
one of the most interesting.......An Outstanding and absorbing Film.

6794151,5,B00PC1FD9U,"Enthralling, brilliant filming of Alan Turing and the breaking of the German Enigma code machine, a significant event in the eventual defeat of the Nazis in WWII.
Much like a fast paced thriller but never neglecting the human and social consequences of the true events depicted, this is a superbly realized film. Benedict Cumberbatch delivers an extraordinary performance as the complex, not your average boy next door type, mathematical genius who, despite his wartime heroics, falls victim to society's repressive and intolerant treatment of homosexuality in post-war England.  Leading a fine supporting cast, Keira Knightley is excellent as his co-worker and intimate friend.
A superb Oscar winning screenplay by Graham Moore and Morten Tyldum's taut direction have turned what could have been mundane material into an exciting entertainment with truly believable characters. An added bonus is Alexandre Desplat's riveting music score.
P.S.  I had the good fortune of purchasing the Simon & Schuster hardcover edition of the book by Andrew Hodges from a remainder table some thirty years ago, never thinking it would be made into such a fine film.  Read the book if you want a more thorough and more accurate  detailing of Turing and the events depicted in the film.

6794154,5,B00PC1FD9U,"Perhaps the best moment in the movie occurred just after Alan Turing's team cracked the code for the enigma machine. The intercepted message indicated a Nazi U-boat pack was about to attack a convoy on which the  brother of one of the team's members was serving. Turing quickly realized that if they alerted the British military, last minute evasive action by the convoy followed by a full scale attack upon the Nazi attackers would signify to the Germans that their code had been cracked. Thus the decision was made to remain silent in order that reactions to future interceptions would appear to be random.

The acting, writing, period setting and directing were all spot on and deserving of BEST PICTURE.

So if you aren't ready to think and process all the information thrown at you, save it for another day! But if you're willing to dedicate your full attention to this movie, you'll probably enjoy it.  I know I did but then I don't just want action shoot-em-up scenes, but would rather have something to think and process as I watch a movie.

6794178,5,B00PC1FD9U,"Excellent film about an amazing man, Alan Turing, who had a major impact on world war two.  This movie has all the elements of  a superb film... excitement, touching drama, great acting.  Also suspense and realism, as it is based on a true story of a brilliant mathematician (Turing) and his incredible ability to decipher an extremely difficult Nazi code.  I suppose this movie is somewhat of a late vindication for him because he was treated poorly from my point of view in the aftermath of the war.  Benedict Cumberbatch brings this man back to life.",1434758400,,553,4.71875

The women who listened to daily messages. The cryptologists whose names are not listed. The list of countries who did not stand alone. The countless number of men and women who died. TRUTH begins by updating this movie ""The Imitation Game"" is not a true story, but a semi-truthful story, that borders midpoint between fact & fiction. Personally, I would rather watch a truthful movie. Why? Because you honor the dead as much as you honor the living. Anything less is disrespectful. Did hollywood think about honoring the descendants or extended family members? Probably $elfishly NOT! An edited version to this movie is in order, let alone a sincere apology.",1434585600,,827,5.0

6794201,5,B00PC1FD9U,"This movie delivered a great deal of emotional content which, I think, is sometimes reserved for somewhat wilder rides.  It also fills in a piece of history that has been kept secret, and then obfuscated, about World War II which has multiple categorical elements, illuminating English culture and law of the period while revealing one of the most secret missions of the war effort.  The violent undercurrent, imposed by English culture and war, of a peaceful genius's life puts him in a position of constant tension as he quite literally saves the world.  Quite a story... You have read reviews and heard of the awards and nominations, but you cannot appreciate it without watching it. If you have been putting it off, please give it a try now.",1434585600,,745,4.8046875

6794208,5,B00PC1FD9U,"I saw this film recently on a BA flight from London and I had to see it again. The topic of the ""enigma"" fascinates me since I have always known that these were the Polish experts who first managed to figure out the code. Touring's contribution to the development of computers is unquestionable, though. The other ""enigma"" addressed in the film is human sexuality. The fact that Touring lived at the time when homosexuality was a criminal offense and ended up commiting a suicide adds a dramatic individual-social dimension to the macro social conflict of World War II. ""Killing for healing"" executed by the Nazi targeting Jews, Gypsies, people with mental illness, as well as homosexuals finds an interesting parallel in the actions of those who oppose the Nazi but are also ready to ""kill"" homosexuals in order to ""heal"" them, and the societies. This is one of the best movies made to address the complexity of social life and the irony of limiting the right of humans to be who they are when they present themselves as an ""enigma"" to the masses manipulated by their political leaders. The acting is superb.",1434499200,,1109,4.78125

The movie was mostly about Keira Knightley's 'Joan Clarke' and Benedict Cumberbatch's 'Alan Turing' sort of falling in love, and her not really realizing he was gay.
Why, oh why, would you make a movie about Alan Turing and ignore the most interesting parts of his life? Ugh.",1434499200,,413,4.671232876712328

Moreover, someone I know had a parent who worked at GCHQ, and he remembers going there as a child, and told me that the representations were very accurate - ""They got it right.""

The evolution of Turing's character through flashbacks to his school days was delicately done and very effective at showing why Turing was the way he was. In Cumberbath's treatment, Turing comes across as what we now call Asberger's Syndrome, which if true, is another interesting point of history. Unfortunately, history is often tragic, as is the case here, but at least there were some things made right later, which are disclosed at the end of the movie.

For me, the film sporadically shifted directions from being an Enigma decoding story, to being a troubled homosexual with societal challenges story.  I'm an equal rights supporter but I don't like people who openly struggle with their sexuality, and and that made this movie a miss for me.  The part that makes me upset is that the plot entirely changes somewhere in the middle.  It's two different films meshed poorly into one.

See it to learn about and be awestruck about one of history's most incredible untold stories and for Cumberbatch's brilliant portrayal of Turing (he totally deserved the Oscar for his performance). On a side note (not referenced in the film), I've been a life-long researcher on the Golden Ratio and Fibonacci Sequence (and have co-authored 4 books on this subject with Robert Friedman, M.D.), which has intrigued and inspired many geniuses and culture-shifters throughout history. So it was no surprise to learn that Turing also had a little-known fascination with the Fibonacci Sequence's predictive role in growth, patterns and form. In addition to being the forgotten father of the modern computer age, Artificial Intelligence (AI), a key contributor to Chaos Theory AND the lead in cracking the German Enigma Code, Alan Turing was a serious Fibonacci Sequence genius...",1434153600,,896,5.361702127659575

6794327,5,B00PC1FD9U,"Princeton's own Alan Turing should be a household name.  Just as J. Robert Oppenheimer headed up the Manhattan Project, so too did Turing lead a small eclectic group of astute minds to break the so-called unbreakable ENIGMA code during WWII.  Both Oppenheimer and Turing succeeded in their tasks.  Turing's achievement shortened the war in Europe and Oppenheimer's achievement ended the war altogether.

Benedict Cumberbatch turns in a thoughtful, sensitive portrayal of a socially awkward mathematician who never quite ""fits in.""  He is arrogant, which makes him a lot of enemies, but thankfully they allow him to complete his mission.  While I knew that Turing broke the code, I was unaware that he was involved in the statistical analyses of what German targets to go after to inflict the maximum casualties on the enemy while @ the same time not ""tipping the hand"" of the allies to where the Germans figure out that ENIGMA has been compromised.  Interesting.

Our girl Keira Knightley turns in an exquisite performance as a woman who is able to humanize the esoteric mind of her mathematician friend.  For all of his arrogance, Turing was certainly no male chauvinist;  he wanted the best minds he could find to be on his team.  Whether they happened to be male or female was completely beside the point.

The other, non-scientific side of Turing was the fact that he was a homosexual, which was considered a mental illness.  It is sad that society was so intolerant of homosexuality after the war, listing it as a mental illness.  These days, there are a great many groups on the religious Right who are unceasing in their vitriolic tirades directed towards gay people.  I find it a bit ironic that their very 1st Amendment right to voice their hatred was partially granted to them by a gay man by the name of Alan Turing.  Whether they like it or not, Turing HAS to be listed as one of the top 5 people most responsible for winning the war!

Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for people of genius to suffer either emotionally or physically.  So far as we know, Sir Isaac Newton, perhaps the greatest mathematician to ever live, died a virgin.  Beethoven went deaf, disallowing him from experiencing the thing he loved most:  music.  The British chemist Henry Cavendish was diffident around women to a pathological degree.  Friedrich Nietzsche was a sickly & extremely lonely man.  John Forbes Nash suffered from a form of schizophrenia, but the schizophrenia also contributed to his brilliance.  Geniuses who are down-to-earth like Richard Phillips Feynman are few & far between.

So too does the name Alan Turing belong to the above pantheon of great thinkers who suffered.  Even before the great John von Neumann, Alan Turing was true pioneer of the computer age.  What Turing did for the world is something none of us can ever repay ~ whether we are offended by the fact that he was gay or not.  This is his story.  Watch it.  Experience it.  Remember it.",1434153600,,2964,4.821428571428571

The sad and interesting truths of his life are put on display here in a poignant, respectful way.  He is caught between two secret lives he cannot embrace publicly.  Yet his loyalty to his country and his loyalty to himself never waver.  He is a man out of time, in a world of spies, in a society that bashes homosexuals and ruins their lives.  Yet, he never gives in.  He never loses the obsession of a true hero.  He soldiers on and changes not just a war, but the very future we are living today.

He's arrogantly self-assured, yet incapable of discerning innuendo or humor as these aspects of the human mind defy his supremely rational, logical framework. Who better to devote himself to breaking an ""unbreakable code?"" It turns out he is going to need to learn to work with others as much as they slow him down if he is going to be trusted to the expense and time it will take to conceive of and build the first computer. When you realize that we are watching this on a device that descends directly from this man's brilliant work, and that his was used to save millions of lives and stop the spread of fascism, how much more poignant the tragedy of what they did to him for being an outsider to a cultural norm that the ""free world"" was (and largely still is) fascist about.

If you should forgive 7 times, and 7 times 7, then what are the limits of Understanding and Forgiveness? Would even Solomon have had a problem with the vagaries of a person's emotional characteristics? I am straight but how can I judge Mr. Touring? It seems we are still searching for answers and maybe the hardest aspect of all this is the manner in which people express their love. Sex is quite a problem, with say people who are Catholic. Seems you can be Gay but it should stop there. You should be celibate at a certain point. Gay people have been with us for more than many of us care to admit. I accept a Gay person as much as I accept a Republican or a Democrat.

6794489,5,B00PC1FD9U,"I eventually  decided to take a chance on seeing Imitation Game after seeing it featured enough times at my job. For some strange reason, I was also curious to know more about the story behind the character (Alan Turing) that Benedict Cumberbatch was playing and the one that Keira Knight was playing (Joan Clarke). Both Turing and Clarke collaborated together during their professional/decryption work that was indirectly affiliated with helping to stop World War II.  I understand that the movie is not a direct representation of what actually happened. However, one informative aspect tied into how the film carefully tied certain events into the work that they were  doing (such as the heart-wrenching scene where Turing has to tell his coworker that they must withhold certain news even with the lucid awareness of one of their family members being on a certain sub). Additionally,I know that you are not supposed to use Wikipedia (academically speaking) as a guaranteed reference. However, if the birthdates cited are correct, it is interesting to note that their birthdays were just one day apart from each other (Clark and Turings birthdates). Anyhow, this is a good movie for those who are open to watch films indirectly related to key events in history and/or a case study in a person who did their best to endure being different from others in a time period that appeared to show contempt towards anybody outside of the mainstream.",1433462400,,1442,5.02510460251046

6794497,5,B00PC1FD9U,"A GREAT movie!!  Without any blood, guts or gore!  Very refreshing in this day and age.

Beware - this movie requires thinking!!

The movie is extremely well acted and engrossing.  In the mid 70s, I read ""The Ultra Secret"" by Frederick Winterbotham - the man who supervised the dissemination of Ultra intelligence obtained from the decoding of the German coding machine called ""Enigma"" during WWII.  Winterbotham had the tremendous responsibility of deciding how to use the top secret German intelligence gathered from the decoded information without the Germans suspecting that their Enigma machine had been compromised,  His decision to withhold some intelligence gathered from the machine to prevent the arousal of suspicion resulted in many deaths, but, in the final analysis, he was able to save an estimated 40 MILLION lives throughout the war using decoded information.

This story of the Enigma machine and the Ultra Secret is both absorbing and captivating.  I highly recommended it to anyone over 14.  I have shown it to teenagers - who all rated it 9 or 10, on a scale of 1 to 10.  Most kids under 14 do not like to watch movies that require patience and thought, so I would not recommend it for them.

Alan Turing, the man principally responsible for solving the Enigma, is considered by many to be the father of Theoretical Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence.

The breaking of the Enigma machine is truly a fascinating story!!",1433376000,,1449,4.9875

A bit too much geared in making a point that without this secret team the world would be a far worse place...BS, which I think crippled the story side of things. Someones got to fund the production I guess. So without governments and corrupt self interests the byproduct sometimes saves lives, and we come up with more machinery that supports such things.

I love history.  Especially historical romance.  When Keira Knightley entered the scene, I thought this movie might move that way.  No.

Here is a piece of WW2 history I was unaware of.  It was riveting, moving, heart-breaking, cruel, beautiful, and wrenching.

The acting was excellent  Benedict Cumberbatch won me over with his beautiful, tortured portrayal of Alan Turing, a man whose name should be known in every household with a computer.

The story was told in such a beautiful understated manner but completely compelling and riveting.  In the end I was weeping from learning how Alan Turing lived the last years of his life and how he died.  This in combination with the recent historical peoples vote in Ireland regarding same-sex marriage, turned me into a blubbering mess.  I begged my husband to play me a comedy afterward to put me back on an even keel.  He played me a few episodes of Tim Allens charmingly politically incorrect Last Man Standing and balance was restored within me.

Wow, how far thinking machines and attitudes to same-sex love have come since WW2.  Alan Turing should be honoured for his courage during the war effort (he made so many difficult  he would say logical  decisions) and for his courage in not hiding who he was as a man.  Im so glad I saw this movie.

SPOILER ALERT - do not read on if you don't want to know some major plot points.  I still get so sad to think that this amazing genius, Alan Turing, who could have spent the next 20-30 years developing who knows what other technological breakthroughs, had his life cut short at 40 because he was gay.  It just sticks in your gut and makes you wish you weren't a part of such a malicious race of human beings.  I mean, this man saved MILLIONS of lives by developing his Turing machine and sparked the advent of the modern computer.  The fact that the man responsible for stopping the Nazis (who arbitrarily decided that Jews were evil, not to mention gays, political dissidents and anyone else they wanted to lump in there) was himself the victim of a society who arbitrarily decided that his sexual orientation was a crime and treated him like an animal because of it, it's overwhelming.  And I can't get past the fact that no matter what progress we've made in terms of gay rights, or the rights of whatever group is currently being arbitrarily discriminated against at the moment (African-Americans, Hispanics, Women, Atheists, the list goes on and on), none of that will bring this man back, will undo the utter injustice of his chemical castration and the misery he must have felt in the last few years of his life.  I weep for that lost life, the lost brilliance that could have changed everything.  Who knows where we would be now if he had lived.  So, this movie is a fantastic tribute to a man who did not fit into society's neat little boxes of how people should be, and also a stark reminder of how cruel and inhumane those who try to enforce those boxes are.",1432857600,,1842,4.501501501501502

Because the importance of what he did, and the need to keep it secret even from our allies, the honor and acclaim deserved by Turring and his team must wait until 2013 to be given.  In the meantime, we see that the apparent string-pullers at the highest reaches of the British government turn a blind eye when they could have easily  stepped in and saved this genius from what amounted to government sanctioned torture.  A beautiful, insightful and very sad story - well acted and directed.  Just a tiny criticism, the extreme good looks of the brilliant female lead, and her willingness to leave all that they were about to accomplish because of some parental concerns in the middle of a war of civilization, seemed awfully contrived.

6794747,3,B00PC1FD9U,"As a Benedict Cumberbatch fan and WWII history buff, I was really looking forward to this movie. Although the acting performances in the movie are fine, the storyline is not engaging---surprising, since here we have not only the cracking of the Enigma code, but also Alan Turing's hidden homosexual life. Disappointing that the moviemakers chose to water down both elements of the plot.

Forget the historical realities of Bletchley Park, MI6, and Enigma; it's clear right away that the movie is going to be deviating far from the facts. With that understanding, I expected the movie to turn in more detail to Alan Turing and his personal life. There are flashbacks to his schooldays and a first crush on a friend, and the movie is of course bookended by his difficulties with the law in regard to his adult affairs; the script apparently didn't allow for any actual insight to Turing's struggles, and abruptly finishes up with a few lines about his death.

For those who don't anything about Enigma/Bletchley Park or Alan Turing, this movie might drive them to learn more from better sources. This movie definitely leaves one with more questions than answers about either.",1432598400,3,1173,4.949238578680203

Writer: Graham Moore (adapted from Andrew Hodges book)

Cast: Benedict Cumberbatch, Keira Knightley, Allen Leech, Charles Dance, and Matthew Goode

In 2001, a film called Enigma was released that told a somewhat true story regarding a group of British codebreakers during World War II who manage to break the Nazi Enigma code, aiding in the Allied victory in the war. This film was a good one, but not great and not that memorable. Enigma fell short mostly due to its decision to fictionalize the story slightly and avoid telling the story of the true mind behind the machine that cracks the Nazi code. The Imitation Game rectifies the 2001 films error by providing a virtual biopic on legendary cryptanalyst, Alan Turing. Between last months The Theory of Everything and now The Imitation Game, the final stamp on American cinema in 2014 seems to be examining brilliant minds in some brilliant ways.

The film explores three key periods of Turings life ranging over about 30 years. The majority of the film focuses on Turings work with the British government during WWII. Turings odd persona causes some hesitation in British military personnel, but his brilliance is evident enough to cause Commander Denniston (Charles Dance) to reluctantly hire him for a secret operation. Turing and a group of other analysts are tasked with figuring out the ever-changing pattern of Nazi communication cyphers. Turing discovers that Dennistons goals differ with his own approach and convinces Prime Minster Churchill to appoint Turing as leader of the operation allowing him to assemble his own team including a promising young codebreaker Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley). Turing redirects the team away from their tactics to help him build a 100 thousand machine that he hopes will be able to break the code.

The film also jumps back and forth between Turings childhood and his life after the war. These scenes help uncover the complexity of Turing and reveal levels of his inner conflicts that would be hard to explore in the WWII segment of the film. It is also with these scenes that the film adds a layer of subtext on some human rights issues regarding Turings need to conceal his homosexuality because of the social consequences unfortunately attached.

The Imitation Game is a very fascinating film and one that hinges very heavily on its performances, which are all excellent. Cumberbatch and Knightley are especially great, giving some nuanced touches to roles that could have felt very artificial. Furthermore, the film feels and looks very authentic, especially in its depiction of the many layers of World War II, most notably the pivotal role of intelligence in terms of how the war played out as well as the impossible decisions that must be made as a result. This film is less about the politics and elements of war and more about the capacity and power of human thought and intelligence. The films title is in fact a reference to one of Turings publications regarding the human brain and what is meant by the term think. In the opening scene of The Imitation Game, we are given access to Turings mind as he basically sets us up to play the imitation game. Through voiceover, Alan Turing tells us to pay attention, listen, and withhold judgment until he is finished talking.  Now these words are technically spoken to an investigating officer in a scene that bookends the film, but they are spoken to the audience as well. Upon the films conclusion, we are able to play this game, and furthermore, appreciate a complex, almost poetic line uttered by both Cumberbatch and Knightley that, sometimes it is the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine. A-

The Imitation Game is rated PG-13 and has a running time of one hour and 54 minutes.",1431820800,2,3802,4.911214953271028

6794947,3,B00PC1FD9U,"The Imitation Game chronicles the precursor of the modern computer, constructed during World War II to decipher the Nazi Enigma Code being transmitted between Berlin and all of Hitlers ships, ground and air forces. The person who ultimately broke this code was Alan Turing, a math wizard who also happened to be homosexual . . . not a good mix in those days in Britain, and elsewhere.

Benedict Cumberbatch is a formidable incarnation of Turing as best we can tell from this distance. But if you do some actual historical search on Turing, you will see that he was far more handsome than Cumberbatch, who is a fine actor nonetheless and fully conveys what must surely have been the genius, the frustration, and the insecurity of this conflicted individual. We are treated to a detailed look at the apparatus he constructed to grind out all the mathematical possibilities of the Enigma Code.

Keira Knightley plays the primary female in Turings life, an invaluable colleague in the deciphering success, and an understanding friend who knows Turings deeper secrets.

After the war, Turing was prosecuted for his sex life, and eventually submitted to chemical castration. He died in 1954.  In 2013, he was awarded a posthumous Royal Pardon by Queen Elizabeth II.",1431820800,,1259,4.980952380952381

6794977,5,B00PC1FD9U,"At first sight The Imitation Game may look like a historical war thriller about a team of Enigma codebreakers at Bletchley Park during WWII. The film is in fact about one genius whose life story is more complicated and compelling than the German code system. The person is Alan Turing, a British mathematician often referred to as a computer pioneer.

The story of The Imitation Game is told in three timelines: Turings young days at a boys school and friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Morcom; his works at Bletchley Park with his colleague including Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley); and what happened to him six years  conviction for indecency  after the war ended. The story goes back and forth in time frequently, but because of the skillful editing you will not get confused.

The independent film is directed by Morten Tyldum, a Norwegian film director known for a unique action thriller Headhunters. His latest film focuses the tormented genius Alan Turing and what he learns from the relationship with other people surrounding him. As a thriller The Imitation Game is more conventional than Headhunters, but with Benedict Cumberbatch giving a convincing portrayal of Alan Turing, the film keeps us intrigued from start to finish.

It is obvious that the filmmakers took artistic liberties with the process of codebreaking that must have been really much more complex, but the fantastic performance of the star almost makes us forget that. The Imitation Game is not a biographical movie in a traditional sense, but it is most riveting as a poignant story of someone who is so much ahead of his time.",1431734400,,1610,4.992537313432836

6794994,5,B00PC1FD9U,"A truly outstanding movie from several viewpoints.  A friend of mine was really after me to watch this one, so it was definitely on my list.  And I've got to say, it was WELL WORTH THE TIME.  First of all, I really liked the main character because he was a socially awkward guy, but a genius nonetheless, and it was clear that he didn't have an evil bone in his body, but he just couldn't figure out regular social convention, so as a result he inadvertently insulted people and just didn't get it!  He had a job to do, and that's what he thought was the main objective, but he found out (with the help of his friend) how important it is to be LIKABLE as well as COMPETENT (I kind of have this problem myself, so I could relate...).  Second, the fact that he was homosexual (gay), but really hadn't ""come out"" in our conventional sense, gave him an interesting dimension on top of his brilliance.  Of course, he wasn't really up to speed on what sort of impact his sexual orientation would have, so that was kind of a sad but interesting part of the story.  Third, if it hadn't been for him (and his strangeness and gayness), WWII would have gone on for much longer than it did, and countless thousands of lives would have been lost if not for this totally awesome dedicated genius.  However, this fact didn't save his butt in the end, and I guess that's the truly sad part about the whole thing.  We often put our stereotypes and prejudices ahead of the facts and realities, and this guy was certainly a victim of that.  Damn!!!  When will we ever learn to take people as they are, as individuals who truly have self-worth and societal worth, even though they don't fit neatly into some little box?????  This movie raises that question in a sad but wonderful way.  Anyway, I LOVED it, and I will definitely recommend it and watch it again.

This is a movie that had such a middling script and does it's best to suffocate the story in stock characters that it nearly suffocates.  However Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightly do such a good job executing on the job that the movie becomes interesting but never engaging.  The Turing role in this film is portrayed as a socially inept person who, like most in Hollywood films becomes more evolved.  His role in the development of one of the first computers is down played in favor of his social awkwardness.  His great role in the war is really ignored for a Friends type situation.  I counted and there are as many people in this circle as in Friends.  It's a pity because it is truly a great story.  Read Walter Isaccson's story on him in his most recent book and you'll find a very compelling person whose story wasn't even told here.

6795051,5,B00PC1FD9U,"Period story of the breaking of the Nazi code, done with all the class of top period series. Great sets, locations, costumes, etc. But the ultimate over-the-top factor for this 2+ hour movie is the characters. Some fantastic performances making several characters come alive many decades after the fact. It's based on a true store, at least true events and people. It is one not to be missed for drama fans as well as historical WWII buffs.

Truly emotional portrayals from some fine actors:
Benedict Cumberbatch [`War Horse' `Sherlock'] plays Alan Turning and not only gives you the flavor of a character with super intelligence (mega-nerd) that functions poorly with other humans. Turning's machine was the forerunner of today's computers.
Keira Knightley [`Pirates of the Caribbean' `Pride & Prejudice' `Anna Karenina'] is superb as Joan Clarke, another brilliant mind (also attractive) and emotional support for Turning. Both Knightley and Cumberbatch were nominated for Oscars for performances in this movie. 7 nominations plus a win in writing for this film.
Allen Leech [`Downton Abbey'] plays another on the team at Bletchley when the Enigma was broken.
Matthew Goode [`Brideshead Revisited'] is also on the team.
You will as well see a smaller role, Sgt Staehl, by Tom Goodman Hill of `Mr Selfridge.'

6795105,4,B00PC1FD9U,"This account of Alan Turing's complex character, his career, his troubles, and his lasting significance is less an ""imitation"" of life than an artful ""representation"" of it.  The selection and ordering of scenes from that life will necessarily seem at times forced, confusing, and overly ""broad."" But in the end this film hangs together, leaving the viewer satisfied yet challenged by the connection between an individual's ""public"" and ""private"" lives or, perhaps more accurately, between the worlds of intellect and desire. The filmmakers know they have a tight line to walk, balancing the two dimensions so artfully that the film becomes neither a tedious exercise in abstract mathematics nor a social polemic against discrimination.  Ideally, we should come away from such a story with the understanding of an ""integrated self"" for whom the aforementioned bifurcations no longer apply.

To its credit the film makes the viewer highly aware of the conflict produced by the tension between Turing's genius and his homosexuality without tilting the balance in favor of the unavoidably more sensationist aspect. We see just enough of Turing's schoolboy days to gain a sense of the deep-seeded, mysterious nature of sexuality and its inseparability from the adult human self. The scenes devoted to Turing's sexual orientation are brief and discreet--each sufficiently telling without ""overwhelming"" the greater importance of the story and a more complete picture of its heroic (and enigmatic) subject.

Only in the closing credits do the filmmakers resort to overt idacticism, offering us a series of written sentences spelling out Turing's accomplishments (in terms of millions of lives saved) and the primitive, if not barbaric, treatment (""chemical castration"") of homosexuals in early 1950s' England.  For the progressive / liberal members of the audience this addition will no doubt produce moral indignation but amount to little more than ""preaching to the choir.""  (Their attention might better be directed toward solving the riddle implicit in the film's title, which would require an essay in itself.)  To a radically conservative / reactionary audience the closing written pronouncements could provoke examination and better understanding of the place (if any) of laws affecting sexual orientation and behaviors between consenting adults..  Regrettably, one wonders if this latter audience will: 1. see the film with an open mind; 2. see the film.",1431302400,2,2456,5.478835978835979
6795106,1,B00PC1FD9U,"I am a big fan of cryptography and of Alan Turing, as well as a WW II history buff. One of my best museum visits ever was to Bletchley Park, where they have a working Bombe (the machine described in the film as ""Christopher"") as well as the more advanced digital computer built to decode encrypted radio signals used by the German High Command. This film is nothing but drivel. It manages to trivialize the work of Turing and of the Bletchley Park cryptographers to the point where it bears no resemblance to the historical record, and to ""embellish"" the story by including irrelevant and improbable ""human interest"" subplots. There was a great movie to be made, and they botched it up in so many ways that it leaves me speechless. Does anyone really believe that Turing and four others developed the Bombe by themselves? That they decoded thousands of Enigma-encrypted messages themselves? That they decided who the decrypted messages should be sent to? By the way, the Bombes were NOT digital computers, in fact they were not Turing machines at all - they were designed with a single purpose in mind, to drastically reduce the number of settings that needed to be tried on an Enigma to decode a message. Thousands of them were deployed in multiple locations in the UK and the US.",1431302400,32,1281,4.697777777777778

At the point in the film where they had the big breakthrough, I was literally shouting along with the actors. So cool and exciting.

The acting is superb; to be honest I wasn't sure Keira Knightly could do much more than the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies. She's great. And Cumberbatch... well c'mon, he's just fabulous (Check out the Sherlock series). The tragic part is the way humans treat other humans.

I rented this movie on Amazon instant video which is another great service offered by Amazon.  Back to the movie!  The movie was very eye opening on multiple fronts.  The way the messages were decrypted and the decision to which message to act on as well as the secrecy and the decisions people had to make in mid 1900s to hide their sexuality was incredible.  It really shows the hard time people caused for each other due to war or matter of opinion of what should be right or wrong and how people suffered.,1431129600,,621,4.460176991150442

I am glad that this true store has finally been told because it reminds us the ""event the most seemingly insignificant individual can change the course of destiny with a selfless act and perhaps in so doing becomes the right hand of God.""  If it was not for Alan Turing, I do not think it would have been necessary for me to be brought into this reality.  He was a person that imagined things that no one could have imagined and in so doing changed the course of evolution.",1431129600,,647,4.411764705882353
6795149,1,B00PC1FD9U,"Difficult to understand all these favorable reviews. This movie is poorly conceived, badly directed and terribly written. The actual history is great, but apparently not good enough for the producers, who determined to Hollywoodize it into something completely different and, unfortunately, stupid. Making a great movie doesn't require adding phony action scenes to a good story. The breaking of the Enigma cypher was a dramatic, thrilling story. The fake-o drama inserted with various characters threatening to destroy Turing's machine(s) fails to augment it. Ditto the fake hostility between Turing and his coworkers, with who he actually go along with well and who respected him. The climactic discovery sequence introduces some any absurd falsehood it's hard to know where to start. Turing did not, as the movie proposes, recognize the importance of a ""crib"" after hours in a bar one evening, as any decent cryptanalyst would have known that from the get-go. And these were England's best. Turing & company did not repair to the lab after hours and work out the positions and assignments of all the ships in the Atlantic one evening. That would have been impossible on several levels. And Turing and his group did not determine how, strategically and tactically, to apply the fruits of their analysis, and the movie dramatization of that is ridiculous and preposterous.

All of this is made worse by the director's repeated and pointless jump cuts forward and backward in time. The first couple of times it's bearable but several more iterations leaves the viewer pleading for surcease. Just like rewriting the plot, the direction suffers from the same Hollywood mentality: ""Let's add some spice to this story, even if the additions are nonsensical. It'll make it livelier and the audience will be too dull-witted to notice.""

Benedict Cumberbatch is a terrific actor (check out Parade's End) but the rest of the cast seems pedestrian but who can blame them given the script. Charles Dance is really getting that Tywin Lannister bit down well. Maybe he ought to insist on doing some comedy lest he become typecast. But The Imitation Game is somewhat of an unintentional comedy, isn't it. Maybe a self-parody.

At least the film treats Turing's homosexuality somewhat fairly (unlike, say, the film Enigma, which tells almost the same story but turns Turing into an entirely different character).

Unless you really like formulaic stuff, this may not be the entertainment for you.",1431129600,40,2482,5.166666666666667
6795150,4,B00PC1FD9U,"Wonderfully acted and great storytelling. The screenplay is a tad formulaic, but Cumberbatch and Knightly give the characters nuance and dimension. This film is a testament to the value of ""otherness""...and entertaining, to boot.",1431129600,,229,5.764705882352941

That said I felt the cast did a yeomen job overall with the possible exception of Benedict Cumberbatch who was indeed outstanding. However, the movie style is done in the current vogue of close face-ups with hand held cameras & plenty of CGI in the background. Once in a while I would like to see full room shot with all the furnishings or a topography shot showing the landscape etc... oh well this is not the 1940's is it.

Obviously containing an implicit LGBT agenda but the story is honest and the agenda is not a distraction; rather it is fundamental to the story. Let's face it -- Turing was brilliant and was a victim of a repressive social system. On the other hand, this was a different time in history, read people felt differently about MANY things. I mean, look, there were years of lobotomies a la Walter Freeman still to follow and there wasn't a lot of social justice in that but it was an accepted thing. What I'm trying to say is, yes, Turing was a victim and that was unfortunate, but society was operating under an entirely different set of norms and one must be careful about judging the past through today's lenses. But enough about that -- the only way many people will learn about the mistakes of the past is from Hollywood, sad as that may be, and this is a great film worth watching and learning from.",1431043200,,948,4.485549132947977

6795217,5,B00PC1FD9U,"It's a good movie that makes us love and admire Alan Turing while despising the British military, intelligence, and police who got in his way.

You know this is not the real story. Yes, Alan Turing was a ""genius."" Yes, he was a great code breaker, and he was gay (and Asbergery), but this is just not what happened. He contributed to a team that cracked the German Enigma machine, but his role was ""contributory"" rather than the leadership portrayed. That's fine. His love interest is a similarly brilliant female code breaker who is treated to chauvinism by the same groups that persecute Turing. He was kinda' gay like many gay men in those days.

But this is a movie and an entertaining one. It portrays Turing not only as a brilliant logician but also as an amazing electrical engineer able to take his idea for solving the problem with a computer and build the computer--perfectly the first time--and program it. He was Wozniak and Jobs in the era of relays. He was so brilliant that his machine could be quickly reprogrammed as new information became available.

The Germans apparently suspected that Enigma had been compromised but didn't realize the compromise was due to their ""teutonic"" rigidity in sending both encoded and plain messages at the start of every day. They were screwed by their hubris since Enigma machines were ubiquitous in the German military and hard to replace merely on suspicion.",1431043200,,1411,4.822314049586777

6795281,5,B00PC1FD9U,"I was so glad to know they had made this movie.  I had read a novel years ago that mentioned the Enigma machine and a genius mathematician who broke the code.  After that I met a British war bride who'd moved to Canada to marry a soldier and she told me she used to transcribe the Enigma messages during the war
When I learned about The Imitation Game I couldn't wait to see it.  I loved the movie.
The main character Alan Turning was superbly and very convincingly played by Benedict Cumberbatch.  He brought to the screen an interesting and unique person who struggled with his social skills and relationships with his team members while the he tried to create a master computer to break Enigma's code.  The co-star Keira Knightley playing Joan Clarke was a perfect intellectual pairing for Alan's genius (and the only woman on the team).

I didn't know anything about Turning before the movie and as the movie flashed back through Alan's life we learned of  his struggles in school and in keeping his homosexuality a secret.  (I realize this is a Hollywood version but the main facts appear to be accurate).

(Spoiler alert) I was elated at the light bulb moments that brought about the dramatic breaking of the code but at the end I was dashed to learn of how Turning was treated after the war and then of his death shortly thereafter.  I found the movie to be entertaining and educational--I had no idea that the code break had been kept secret for 50 years so the Germans wouldn't find out and change the code.  I also found the story inspiring so that I now want to learn more about Turning.",1430784000,,1598,4.513888888888889

6795301,5,B00PC1FD9U,"This gets 5 stars only because you don't have 10 as an option. It is a very well-done film with outstanding acting performances by all the cast. It tells a story not widely told before of a critical part of a clandestine operation that was part of the British effort to win WWII at a point where the fate of Britain seemed uncertain at best.
It is a fascinating story of the historical development of computers motivated by the need to break the German Enigma code. The idea that a machine could be developed to analyze possible patterns at a rate far faster than humans could do the task leads to the idea of the thinking machine and the computer.

The film is also an examination of the changes of societal mores and human relationships that were beginning to occur. The film gives a personal face to many of today's issues about relationships. This is another richly-complex performance by Benedict Cumberbatch and an ensemble of talented actors.

The film spares no opportunity to drive home Turing as a robotic oddness and the use of the word logical is repeated a lot and they try to make Turing look ""savant-like"" by not  grasping even the most modest of jokes.

6795471,3,B00PC1FD9U,"I preferred the movie ""Enigma"", also loosely based on the life and times of Alan Turing.

The difference between the two movies is that Enigma  used a few facts about breaking the enigma code to creat a John Buchan - like (The 39 Steps) mystery thriller. The Imitation Game turns out to be equally fictitious but pretends to be a biography of Alan Turing.

The film writer's grasp of their source material was shallow at best. With too many factual errors and a preference for a prurient interpreting of the ""human interest"" aspects of Turing's homosexual life. Factual errors: Though Turing was an inveterate tinkerer, the Bombe"" was developed by the British Telephone Company. There was nothing conceptually difficult about it. It was simply a fancy Difference Engine to calculate through all the permutations the enigma machine could create with each daily change of the settings. Turing's REAL contribution was two fold. First he figured out a solution to one of Godel's problems - which led him to realize that not all possible combinations had to be worked through to break the code. Given a ""crib"" (the idea of which was captured much more clearly in Enigma) it was only necessary to run the bombe along each path until it hit a contradiction with the crib. All logical possibilities beyond this point could be ignored. (Instead of millions and millions of possible combinations, Turing wrote a logical way of cutting the number of combinations down to a manageable size. Thus making the enigmas machine's combinations and permutations manageable for code breaking. His second contribution and the one he is justifiably famous for in the context of the Bombe in breaking code, was to write the software to tell the machine what to do. -- OK, not very interesting material for a sexy drama to sell to movie goers. So Instead we have Turing endlessly ignoring his fellows while tinkering with the bombe.  A misrepresentation in fact. But it gets worse. Touring was always open about preferring boys to girls - naively so, given his ""preference"" was illegal. He was entirely forthright to the police. Which is why they ""had"" to prosecute him. The skeptical police officer is entirely gratuitous. He did lose his top secret status. And he did commit suicide two years after the hormone therapy.  But the movie's depiction of these events amount to a shallow conflation of known facts and idle speculation. - So then what was the point of the movie?
It wasn't a thrilling mystery and it wasn't an insightful biography of a very significant and interesting progenitor of the computer revolution.
It just felt like a sort of prurient, shallow mish-mash. The acting was decent (Though Keira Knightly was miss-cast. Kate Winslet's equivalent character in Enigma was achingly believable.) and the narrative drive was competent. So: Three stars.",1430352000,,2841,4.985232067510548
6795472,4,B00PC1FD9U,"Overall it is a good movie.  It gives you a glimpse of what it must have been like for  Alan Turing and his team in their struggle against the clock to crack the nazi's encryption code and help win WWII. THowever, it was hijacked to be a political statement for the homosexual agenda.  Forcing the focus of the film from Alan Turing's success as a brilliant mathematician to his personal struggle with same sex attraction and depression and eventual suicide did not do this film justice.  The latter topics should have been made into another film which more than likely would have conveyed those issues more clearly.  As it is, it feels forced and contrived as though it was forced upon the screenwriters to somehow include it in the film.  Otherwise it is a good film.",1430352000,,769,4.617647058823529

6795495,5,B00PC1FD9U,"A wonderful story, an exciting piece of history, and also a tremendously sad ending.  It is interesting also that any student of computer science is familiar with the name Turing and yet his reputation is relatively unknown outside those circles.  More to the point, how many students who know his genius knew that he was homosexual.  I suspect that the true answer is ""very few"" - giving rise to the truth that sexual orientation is/was irrelevant to his genius.  That also makes this movie a sad, yet illuminating, bit of history.  I do not know that one needed to include this bit of context to make the movie as enjoyable as it was, but it certainly illustrates how movies can take a position on public policy; media and entertainment can reflect social mores but also influence them (I'm thinking of Murphy Brown).  I think it is both understandable and unfortunate that the movie needed to embellish certain elements to lend coherence and compactness to the narrative.  I am not sure that history validates that Turing was essentially ""blackmailed"" into silence (or even knew about) Russian agents within MI-6.  One worries a bit when society begins to learn it's history from Oliver Stone and his colleagues and wonders whether history of this sort is sufficient to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past (paraphrasing the quote about learning from past mistakes or being doomed to repeat them).  Anyway, we enjoyed the movie thoroughly.  The accolades it received are well-deserved.",1430352000,,1492,4.979838709677419

6795570,5,B00PC1FD9U,"Well done, overall. I did like the film but found myself wanting a lot more... Personally, I found the way the screenplay laid out this triumphant/tragic story to be unbalancedI didn't feel 'either' the enormity of the wartime achievement -or- the full story of the post-war injustice were told completely.  I do understand it's never possible to tell a story ""completely"" in two hours but there was just this sense, maybe because I know the historical record of this man's life quite well, that there was so very much missing.  What happened to him and what it says about the times was simply not covered sufficiently.  The wartime story is an immense triumph but the screenwriters failed in their inability to accommodate two high-pointsone 'story' would have to take second place, inevitably.  I have no solution to this unavoidable problem; I think the film does its best and is a fine filmbut it leaves me with the feeling that so much completely worthy of a film of its own was given only cursory attention.",1430352000,,1013,4.804597701149425

6795576,3,B00PC1FD9U,"First let me say I loved all the actors in this movie. It is well cast and everyone did a superb job. The story just evolves so tragically that I ended up feeling more melancholy than feeling that a great man was treated unjustly but was honored in the end. I understand that they couldn't fictionalize what actually happened but it seems that the U.K. and the world have not given him the war hero recognition he seems to have accomplished after all these years. If his contribution was as incredible as it does appear to have been, then why has it been soooooo long in being spoken about and recognized?! I had never heard of any of this until this movie came out and I'm a baby boomer! I do recall very vague references to code breaking in other WW II movies I've seen but it was always waaayyyy down played as though the people who were in the middle of their particular war battle did all the planning and decision making based on their own observations/intel. This movie seems to say that is not the case at all. Perhaps I need to read the book for more detail. Just my thoughts.",1430352000,,1085,4.349753694581281

Also there were changes in enigma so that there was a period of time when decrypting Germany's encoded messages stopped.

6795654,4,B00PC1FD9U,"THE IMITATION GAME tells the story of how Alan Turing helped to break the Nazi Enigma code during WWII, turning the tide in favor of the Allies. It also provides some insight into his troubled personal life. I suppose the biggest theme in the film is that of secrets, be they government/military or personal. While I thought that the parallels drawn between Turing's work and life were a bit broad and obvious, it still made for a compelling story, and certainly one that needed to be told. Far and away, Benedict Cumberbatch is the best reason (among many) to see this film. His performance was extraordinary, and certainly his best work outside of SHERLOCK. Even though Turing was probably somewhere on the autism spectrum, there was considerable emotional weight to this portrayal, particularly in the final scenes which go into the terrible thing which happens to him as a consequence of his homosexuality. As far as prestige biopics go, nothing in the film's content or construction goes out of its way to stand out. The plot structure, which hops back and forth to different periods in Turing's life was a bit passe, although nothing felt superfluous or out of place. And of course, the main part of the story which focuses on Turing's work breaking the Enigma code was fascinating to watch, not just for the dramatic tension that came from trying to win the war, but also through the personal relationships that formed as Turing and his team spend more and more time together. And for once, I didn't dislike Keira Knightley in her native accent. From a technical standpoint, the film is well put-together with good, if unspectacular, cinematography and editing. The score by Alexandre Desplat was also well-done and noninvasive. The only issue I feel detracts from the film in the slightest is the on-the-nose screenplay by Graham Moore, which almost oversells Alan Turing's importance and draws some rather obvious parallels between his secret government work and secret life. Still, the story told here is a very important one nonetheless and allows an enigmatic historical figure some due respect. While this isn't a revolutionary step forward as far as biopics go, it sheds some light on recently declassified history that will prove interesting to most.",1430265600,,2265,4.994708994708994

The story is captivating.  The acting is fantastic.  The story is sensational but there isn't much in it that escapes the realm of possibility (IE: silly things that defy the laws of physics or awkward breaks of character for the sake of segue).  I enjoyed it more than any movie I've seen in a long time.

I read a few bad reviews because I figured there would be some gripes about breaks from what really happened.  If the bad reviews I read are accurate, the things I suspected were fictional were pretty close to right.  There was nothing shocking, IMO.  If the movie was disingenuous to his actual personality it would still be  entertaining but it would have taken something away.  Taking things that happened separately and combining them and exaggerating the protagonist are just plain moving making. I didn't expect anything different.  I'm not sure why anyone else did.

It's a great movie.  Give it watch.",1430179200,,1112,4.683937823834197

6795661,5,B00PC1FD9U,"I'm not even sure why I bought this movie.  I've never been a big fan or either Benedict Cumberbatch or Keira Knightley.  The first seemed to me a rather emotionless actor and the second just never quite clicked.  It must have been that this was based on a true story and the subject matter was riveting. So it was bought and watched.  Alan Turing was not in the least a sympathetic character and he was played that way, which seemed to reinforce my initial idea that Cumberbatch couldn't play emotion.  However, having paid a great deal of money (I'm one of those people who usually wait until a DVD drops below $10 [and the lower the better!] before I buy) i watched the whole thing.  As the movie progressed the characters character became much clearer and I began to feel a sneaking liking for him and a growing respect for Cumberbatch.  At the end of the movie there is a scene, just a fleeting moment, where the character shows such incredible pain and the actor simply nailed it!  It didn't last long and it didn't need to, but if your heart didn't break at that moment, you're much tougher than I am!

My 16 year old son was outraged at what was done to Turing (trying not to do spoilers here!) and we had some good dialogue about it.  I even commented that Elton John was knighted for his musical ability much later in history, yet this was done to Turing during my lifetime.  I still have to shake my head.

As for Knightley, you did it, girl.  I loved the character and her portrayal of a young woman completely set up in a strange situation and who handled it admirably.  She was Turings friend and remained so probably until the end.

Should you watch this movie?  I'd say so.  It captures you and makes you both interested and ache at the same time.  Good movie, guys!",1430179200,,1782,4.397553516819572
6795662,4,B00PC1FD9U,"This in many ways a great film. Glad I saw it. I think I 'might' watch it a second time, probably not a third. I love  Ms Knightly and was beginning to think she could do no wrong. She does an excellent job in a thankless character that feels like it was thrown in as an after thought to provide a female identity.",1430179200,,314,3.984126984126984
6795663,2,B00PC1FD9U,"The Imitation Game is about breaking the German Enigma code during WWII and the efforts toward that end by the staff at Bletchley Park in England. Central to this effort was Dr. A.M. Turing, portrayed in the film by actor Benedict Cumberbatch (Ford-12 Years a Slave). Supporting cast includes Matthew Goode (Finn Polmar-The Goodwife) as Hugh Alexander, Keira Knightley (Cecilia Tallis-Atonement) as Joan Clarke, Allen Leech (Tom Branson-Downton Abbey) as John Cairncross, Mark Strong (Lord Blackwood-Sherlock Holmes) as Stewart Menzies, and Charles Dance (Tywin Lannister - HBOs Game of Thrones) as Commander Denniston. I admit that this is a stellar cast doing an incredible job with a script that deliberately distorted real people, real events, and assails the character of Dr. Turing. And Turing was a respectable man who achieved a Ph. D. from Princeton, working independently, down the hall from Einstein and von Neumann. He turned down the job the prestigious college offered to him.

This movie not only fails to portray Turing with an appropriate persona but also egregiously dishonors him. Britain's Official Secrets Act, which every Bletchley Park worker had to sign, effectively silenced all participants. Were it not for Frederick Winterbothams 1974 book, The Ultra Secret, Bletchley Parks role in WWII may have been erased from history, and Turings role with it. For a country who waited over fifty years to issue a pardon to Turing for the shameful way in which he was treated after his meritorious contributions to the welfare of the world, the departure from fact and liberties taken with the truth just adds salt to a mortal wound.

**Potential Spoiler Alert**
I have a list of errors/distortions:
(1) Alan Turing was circumspect about his homosexuality but forthcoming to those he trusted.
(2) The British bombe machine was never called Christopher by Turing. There was a computer dubbed Colossus that was used to decrypt messages that had been encrypted by the Lorenz SZ40/42 machine.
(3) Joan and Turing had no tempestuous break-up and remained friends for the rest of his life.
(4) The tensions at Bletchley Park were manufactured by the screenwriters - there was no rivalry between Hugh Alexander & Turing. In fact, Alexander was the only colleague to testify as a defense character witness at Turings indecency trial.
(5) Dennistons family has already gone on record protesting how he was so negatively portrayed. There was no appeal to Churchill over Dennistons staff appointments; in fact, both Turing & Alexander wrote to Churchill requesting more resources. In addition, Alexander was hired on after Turing was already in charge. Denniston did not have it in for Turing and did not suspect him of being a Russian spy.

From interviews conducted in the intervening years with high profile Princeton denizens as well as people who worked with Turing, he was known to have a keen sense of humor and while quiet and cerebral, he did not exhibit the degree of quirks & social awkwardness depicted in the movie. While enduring his chemical castration, he went about his business and conducted a normal social life and did not hide away. His chemical castration ended over a year before Turing killed himself by taking cyanide.

If Turing had not had such a tragic event happen to him, I might not take such exception to these false biographical elements. But his life was a tragedy of discrimination and apparently a national embarrassment (the belated pardon & apology) once his WWII efforts were known to the world. As a consequence of his conviction, his security clearance was revoked which barred him from continuing to consult with British intelligence on cryptographic matters. He was barred from visiting the U.S. He was able to keep his academic job, however. To deliberately misrepresent his professional demeanor, his personality, and elements of his career downplays the very crucial role he played in WWII. This distortion of his character assails the integrity, accomplishment, and dogged determination - positive character traits - that enabled Turing to accomplish what he did in his life. I think that this film candy coats his endeavors and disguises him with an insensitive narcissism unbefitting the man. To me, the film attempts to destroy any semblance of true respect the world should have for this humble, brilliant, patriotic man. I can only recommend the actors and not the script.",1430092800,11,4429,5.147222222222222

6795670,5,B00PC1FD9U,"Mr. Cumberbatch gives a memorable performance as Alan Turing, the ""father"" of the modern computer who is estimated to have shortened WWII by two years by cracking Nazi Germany's super-secret Enigma enciphering machine.  Even among scientists at the time, Mr. Turing was at warp speed in his understanding of the role of ""machines"" in the future, and Mr. Cumberbatch captures the former's isolation even from his own colleagues.  The movie teaches the viewer the basics cyphers and the importance of the work being done by Mr. Turing and his ""code breakers"" at Bletchley Park.  Unfortunately, Mr. Turing was also a sad victim of his sexual preference.  As a gay man, he had to hid his preference from all around him because it was illegal in Great Britain.  He would have immediately lost his security clearances.  And after the war ended, that is exactly what transpired, as he was convicted of indecent behavior, fired from his position as a college professor, and placed on a regimen of female hormones.  The barbarism of his punishment more than likely was the catalyst for his suicide at age 41, which the movie treats rather benignly.  Undoubtedly Mr. Turing plumbed the depths of all human emotions in his short, tragic live; and Benedict Cumberbatch plumbed them again in a most memorable dramatic performance.  He was rightly nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of Mr. Turing.",1430092800,,1397,4.987068965517241

6795754,5,B00PC1FD9U,"This was an amazing film, the kind of history that touched me deeply.  Going into it I expected another rundown of a hero's story but what I got was a completely different complex hero living during a time when even the fact that his work saved so many lives still could not overcome the small-minded criminal homophobic perspectives.  And, of course,it is better for many homosexuals in our times as civil rights movements continue,but there is still far too much judgement and often times violence against those who do not fit with what is deemed ""normal"".  Still, I feel privileged to have watched this film and I believe it is true that  many of those who can't be imagined to do anything may indeed be the only ones who have what it takes to do what no else one can imagine.

6795773,5,B00PC1FD9U,"An exceptional movie that retells the story of a group of scientists who were attempting to develop a decoder for the German's enigma machine in World War II.  The movie has depth, allowing the viewer to view the interrelationships between characters, the difficult task of developing a de-coder for a communications device with over 150 million code combinations, and the difficult sociology of a culture that has developed negative codes for persons who are homosexual.  It unveils the person of Alan Turing as he and research group applies their knowledge to solve the problem of the code.  Benedict Cumberbatch is excellent as Turing, as is Keira Knightly who is both a researcher and his wife throughout the code development processes.  The script is based on actual events and results, with some dramatic alterations to fit the form of entertainment.  An undergirding theme is that there are times when information must be withheld by government when looking to longer term consequences of winning a war, as was this event that saved an estimated 14,000,000 deaths and ended the war with Germany.",1429747200,,1102,5.1

6795797,5,B00PC1FD9U,"I never heard of Alan Turing, one of the pioneers of super computing systems. I knew about Enigma, the super Nazi code and that its cracking saved millions of lives as Allies had access to enemy plans, end the war earlier. AsTuring is home when the police visit in response to a report of burglary at his address, he is neither in duress nor eager to have his home searched. On a hunch,brought on by this reticence,they decide to investigate his past. Finding that Turing is a scientist and has a secret wartime past, one cop decides to go above and the call of duty and beyond probable cause to dig up his past. Suspicions and assumptions abound because several university teachers/scientists were traitors and/or defectors to the USSR. This made Turing a member of a suspected group by education, class and profession. The twists and turns which follow the wartime exploits of  Mr. Turing and his code crackers to the ambitious efforts of public servants using profiling to unearth a spy. Unable to turn up evidence of espionage, and unwilling to accept their findings,the cops continue to pound away at the seeming, well ""difference"" of this man which leads to the conviction for homosexuality and an offer he couldn't refuse; the lesser seeming of two cages and the one which will allow  Mr. Turing to continue working.  After his tragic death, he is pardoned  by the Queen. Two stories in one and two enigmas. Although we have decriminalized homosexuality in much of the western world, the story is a timely one. War, heroism, prejudice and profiling and the excesses of access to information and abuse of power by public servants.  My family and I were glued to the screen. We've watched this movie twice.",1429747200,,1711,4.786440677966102

6795871,3,B00PC1FD9U,"I am updating my review since last night.  I'm bumping my review up from 2 stars to 3 but still have my issues with it. I got suckered by all the 5 star reviews on Amazon.  Does anyone read actual history books anymore?  I understand that this is NOT a documentary but a movie based on Alan Turing's life. This movie was interesting in the first half, but what is the message this movie is trying to make?  I almost fell asleep in the 2nd half. POSSIBLE SPOILERS: OK, so he is gay, so what?  I'm not trying to downplay Turing's personal life, which is important as he was tormented for being gay (very sad), but I want to let the viewers know that his personal life IS THE focus of this movie, not the WW2 part.  Just be aware of this fact before watching it and then you will like it.  Personally, I was hoping for more focus on the team goals and the mission at hand during WW2.  He was a genius and had a major role in creating this awesome machine that the allies needed to stop the Nazi's. However, during WW2 no one had time for this personal lifestyle stuff while trying to break codes.  I was really hoping that this film would be better than ""Enigma"" from many years back with Kate Winslet, which also had flaws but was ok at best.  In the movie U571, the Americans capture the enigma machine which is false, but it was more entertaining as a movie but very far from the truth itself as well. Let's try looking at Poland's role as well before we move on. All I'm trying to say is that it would be nice if the moviegoer would know what the topic of the flick is first, before spending money on it.  I was hoping for a WW2 movie. Yes, it is a well made, emotional movie with some great acting. But, in the end, it's basically a soap opera about one man's turmoil .  Does anyone want to buy my copy?  I cannot see myself viewing it again. Troll me all you want, but as a WW2 history guy, I cannot recommend this film. Finally, the ending text messages on the screen during the bonfire before the ending credits roll on are insulting to those who don't buy into what Hollywood thinks.",1429574400,,2089,4.205513784461153

But there is plenty of other great acting to be had here as well.  Typically nothing happens in a World War II drama these days that I didn't already know about.  But here, a few very interesting details about the activities at Bletchley Park were unknown to me.  So it was a pleasant surprise when these were revealed.

In this case though there was way too much of it. After watching it I decided to research the actual events and while the movie shows a handful of people working on one machine there was actually thousands workng on the project and there were 200 of the machines. Also, Touring was not a social misfit but was said to be sociable and worked well with his colleagues. Maybe the biggest problem for me was at the end where the movie outright lies about the timing and way Touring died. I don't know why the director was so intent on making Touring such a tragic figure but I feel that If the movie stayed closer to the real story it would have been much better.",1429574400,2,810,4.232258064516129

6795896,3,B00PC1FD9U,"Basically this is three-films-in-one.  Unfortunately none of the films are wholly satisfying as a stand alone particularly the way the narrative is structured flashing back and forth from time and place creating an unsettling feeling.  Perhaps it would have worked if the stories were told in linear fashion but more than likely scenarist Graham Moore bit off more than he can chew trying to convey too much in a limited amount of time.  Matters aren't helped by star Benedict Cumberbatch's turn as mathematician  Alan Turing which struck me as mannered and affected just the kind of performance Academy members would consider bold and daring.  The primary gist of the film is supposed to be about Turing and his team of wonks attempting to crack the Nazi Enigma Code.  It's kind of laughable because you get the sense here that nobody other than Turing does much of anything being content to bask in their leader's glory.  Equally laughable is that once the code is cracked Turing would be taken seriously as a war strategist.  There are some good performances in the film particularly by Keira Knightley as the sole woman on Turing's team, Charles Dance as the supervisor of the project who would have sacked Turing if he had his druthers, and Mark Strong as an MI6 agent.  Some would say I'm nitpicking but considering the superlatives accompanying the film I was a tad disappointed.  To its credit the film is never boring and kept me relatively interested but frustrated at the wasted potential.",1429574400,,1500,4.893280632411067

Their story was kept secret for many years, until modern computers and software enabled a new generation of cryptography. For those who enjoy the film and wish to get more of the historical context, the Bletchley Park campus has undergone considerable restoration and is open to the public. The film gives the impression that Alan Turing was part of a small crew, but the true fact is that there were a lot of people a Bletchley, including some of Britain's finest mathematicians, logicians, and engineers.

6795949,5,B00PC1FD9U,"MATH PRODIGY Alan Turing was a tragedy in the making.

True  he created a device that was able to crack the German Enigma coding machine, allowing the Allies to intercept naval attacks during World War II. Historians estimate it was able to shorten the war by more than two years, saving more than 14 million lives. His accomplishments and belief in a digital age make him the father of computers.

He was also an Olympic quality runner, an exercise he used to calm his ever-active mind. He was socially awkward, well aware of his own intelligence, eccentric and a homosexual. That last would have him arrested and sentenced to chemical castration. He killed himself in 1954 with a cyanide covered apple.

As Norwegian director Morten Tyldum and screenwriter Graham Moore of Chicago point out in their commentary, Turing was fascinated by Disneys Snow White.

Benedict Cumberbatch, of the smart BBC/PBS hit Sherlock!, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and Star Trek: Into Darkness, brings the unconventional genius to life with all of his brilliance and gawkiness. That he received a Best Actor nomination comes as no surprise to those who have followed his career. The film was also nominated for Best Motion Picture, Best Directing, Best Actress (Keira Knightley), film editing, production design and score by Alexandre Desplat (The Kings Speech, 2010; Argo, 2012; The Grand Budapest Hotel, 2014). It won for Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay for Graham Moore in his feature film debut.

There have been books, documentaries and films about cracking the Nazi code before, notably 2001s Enigma. What Tyldum's film does is create a thorough portrait of Turing, his associates and his time. It is a passion-driven film. The challenge to end the war might be in the vanguard, but the longing for personal freedom drives it. Turing finds an ally in Knightleys Joan Clarke, a 25-year-old co-worker. A grandmaster puzzle solver, she must continually defend her qualifications because of her gender. Like Turings sexuality, its something she cant change. When her parents insist she quit the team, move back home and find a regular job  secretarial work is acceptable for a spinster  Turing proposes. Its a romance of the intellect, the excitement of being able to do something no one else can. Their relationship is believable and beautiful  and crushing when it falls apart.

Extras for The Imitation Game are all choice viewing. A multi-part Q&A highlights interviews with Tylum, Moore, Cumberbatch, Knightley, producers and others at the Telluride Film Festival, Screen Actors Guild, and Producers Guild of America forums provides technical details and character development; it is exclusive to Blu-ray. An excellent making-of presents the history behind Turings story, WWII and period societal conventions, with production design, casting and additional technical data. Two deleted scenes follow the investigation that leads to Turings arrest and discovery of his body.

Anchor Bays Blu-ray transfer is absolutely perfect. Color, depth, detail and black levels are flawless. (And how grand it is to see a film unmarred by an artificial wash of color.) Shot on 35mm film, The Imitation Game offers the clarity of digital perfection with a soft grain wash reminiscent of classic motion pictures. Sound is  as expected  dialogue heavy on this DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track. Scenes featuring a thunderstorm, bombing of England and a sea battle show off surround features to good effect.

A combination of worthy story, outstanding performances, direction and production quality makes The Imitation Game a must-see historical drama. Its a film to remember  and return to for repeat viewing.   Kay Reynolds",1429574400,,3690,5.2482993197278915

6795952,5,B00PC1FD9U,"Having read ""The Ultra Secret"" over 35 years ago, I was certainly intrigued and pleased that a mainstream production was created to illustrate this incredible endeavor which indeed probably saved 12 to 14 million people and shortened the War by two years.  While there may be other reviews that speak of the personal trials and tribulations of the incredibly brilliant Mr. Turing, the wolfpack/convoy scenario is but the tip of the iceburg as it were, in regards to the strategic decisions made with the intelligence garnered from Bletchley Park.

The movie warrants Five Stars for all the right reasons, but then I recommend reading ""The Ultra Secret"" as a concordance .. probably cost $3.95 in paperback back then.  Did Churchill knowingly sacrifice Coventry to keep the Inigma Secret?  As a TET veteran I embrace WWII as a time where the lines between good and evil were clearly drawn, and this movie belongs in every WWII library, along side ""Band of Brothers"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"".",1429574400,,991,4.987878787878788

6795991,2,B00PC1FD9U,"This movie painted a rather unflattering portrait of Turing in regards to his personal life and completely bolloxed his significant contributions to cracking the German Enigma code. Turing was not an unfeeling, automaton who couldn't understand a joke. According to interviews with acquaintances, he was friendly, had a sense of humor, and got along with his co-workers quite nicely. His achievements in building the bombe, called Christopher in the movie, were significant in the sense of speeding up the time to solutions but, he was not the inventor. Some Polish cryptographers were. And the idea that hut 8 decided how to act on the intelligence gained is ludicrous. Their role was decipherment of the intercepts with the result going to senior war planners. The details leading to Turing's death are also in dispute. There is no clear cut path between his being convicted of gross indeceny (homosexuality) and a purported suicide.

I understand the needs of movie makers to adjust certain facts to make an interesting film, but they went too far in this case. Two stars  is all I can give it.",1429488000,,1097,4.9890710382513666

6796039,2,B00PC1FD9U,"I never rent/buy movies.  I love Benedict Cumberbatch and think he's a fantastic actor.  I realize he was nominated for an Academy Award for The Imitation Game, but what actor isn't who is willing to take on controversial roles today.  I am a war movie/documentary addict up to and including WWII.  Turing was a war hero, brilliant mathematician & cryptanalyst who, while he was the man in charge, was greatly aided by the huge British Tabulating Machine Co. in efforts to build the ""bombe"".  BTM invented punch card machines in the 1880's!  In 1908 BTM opened a small company in America.  That company subsequently became IBM.  I could be wrong, but I don't recall hearing any mention in this movie of BTM, a card punching embryo to the computer. (Not to suggest Turing wasn't superman.)  Or that over TWO THIRDS of the 10,000 people working in conjunction with Turing on development & code breaking were women!  I saw ONE female represented, or even mentioned in this movie.  The Imitation Game is not about winning WWII, not about breaking the Nazi Enigma code.  It is about Alan Turing, a HUGE (never credited) tabulating (punch card) company, working with 10,000 other people to create the ""bombe""/break the Nazi code.  It is about a war hero and brilliant mathematician/cryptanalysis who is homosexual and how the movie portrays his ill treatment.  If you're looking for more war in your WWII movie, which we were, this is probably not for you.  Nor is it what its marketing suggests.  I also think it needed to have a rating stronger than PG13.  PG14 or R for more than one reason.",1429401600,,1588,4.758241758241758

6796041,4,B00PC1FD9U,"An interesting, but rather superficial, telling of the contribution of Alan Turing to the Allied effort in WWII. The man was exceptional, likely won us the wore, and was chemically castrated by his not very grateful government. There is a weird inversion effect with the actors. The better looking the real person was, the more geeky the actor in the film appeared. Alan Leach, for example, looks vastly more like Peter Hilton than does Matthew Beard who plays Hilton. The Detective that is the antagonist in the film is utterly made up and Turing was never investigate for being a Soviet spy. While Christopher really did exist, was a childhood friend of Turing's, and did die as described, the Turing Machine was named Bombe, after an earlier Polish code breaking machine, not Chris. Gordon Welchman is completely missing from the film and contributed significantly to the development of Bombe. So, while Turning gets his due, Welshman is still left to obscurity.

So, most of the plot is complete rubbish and for very little reason. Beyond the main fact of breaking the Enigma code, almost nothing else happens as the movie suggests, including the ""moral crisis"" of not saving the convoy with a  bother of the team. Thus, the film is a completely contrived and that lack of honesty seems to show. However, what is leftover is a darn good movie. It is restrained in the bombast, emotional theatrics, car chases, CGI, and other affectations of modern movies. No one suggested making this movie in 3D. it is a good literary effort.",1429401600,3,1531,4.862068965517241

The story line was strange in that the crux of the movie is about the injustice that the British government delivered to the thousands of homosexual men. However, there was not one seen of overt homosexuality in the whole movie. In fact, there was really no sexuality in the whole movie. The love interest was another boy who was kind to him in boarding school with blurred platonic implications, but nothing physical. I doubt he would have been punished (wrongfully so) for something that really never happened. It was not a great code cracking movie either.

6796154,5,B00PC1FD9U,"This movie (instant streaming) was excellent and  a story I had never heard before.  I'd guess most haven't heard the story of Alan Turnig.
This is a man who saved over 14 million people from dying during the war when he and his helpers broke the German code ...where they were going to hit, when, etc.. This was good news and bad news because some 'hits' had to happen so that the German's didn't get wise that their code was broken (took over two years to figure out).

Mr. Turnig was also responsible for the beginnings  of  the computer; the contraption he made boggles the mind but he just knew it would work; I look at that thing and wonder how his mind even came up with the contraption itself let alone whether it WOULD WORK or not;;; AMAZING!

The more difficult job was to determine who gets bombed by the Germans and who doesn't. Should they stop all the bombings per the info. they now had the Germans would know they had broken the code which took over two years to do, S
ome of the bombs went where they were designated and others were saved-a little like playing G-d but the only avenue this team (Alan's team) could take.

He seems so much an odd duck as we see him  as a school boy and then back to a man who is pure genius. It turns out he is a homosexual which had nothing to do with his odd behavoir. He was so focused on the task at hand (breaking the code) nothing else mattered.

I could go on and on but suffice it to say that of all the war movies, holocaust books and movies I've seen this one is one of the best movies I've seen on this particular subject and one I knew nothing about.

Check it out if you are at all interested; it is a fascinating and a sad story (no spoilers) that deserved to be told and I'm happy I took the chance and rented it!",1429315200,,1778,4.142441860465116

The outcome is heartbreaking, but an accurate and unflinching reflection of the times.

6796280,4,B00PC1FD9U,"Overall the movie is excellent. The cast, even supporting rolls, were well thought out and really well done. The problem is the history. It is correct only in part which is baffling because his story is quite a story. The movie is stuck on his homosexuality. His brilliance and dysfunction  seem to be just side stories in the movie. The movie also goes out of it's way to condemn British society of the era by painting it so negatively.

I still recommend it though. You get the gist of the story and hopefully it will spark people to further pursue the true history behind it.",1429056000,,578,4.495238095238095

Being intelligent can be almost as difficult as being a homosexual in today's society.  This is a dramatization.  People who get all bent out of shape over historical inaccuracies need to get a clue.  This isn't a documentary.  Very nice, believable work by the entire cast.

An absolutely critical story which must be told, and for those of us who remember, appreciated with awe, as all true Americans should of ""The Greatest Generation"". Like Oppenheimer and team, like Wernher von Braun and team, these are the individuals who literally saved our World in World War II. With the distinguishing note/observation that Alan Turing wrote his history (as the father of Turing Machines, otherwise known as Computers) at a very small relative cost of human lives, in order to save untold millions. This is a movie that should be mandatory ""homework"" for all academic History classrooms.

6796339,4,B00PC1FD9U,"Thing is I am a WW2 history buff, I already knew about the enigma machine and Alan Turing but I wanted to see Benedict Cumberbatch in the role. It didn't bother me much that Keira Knightly was in the movie but what did bother me is they defined Alan as a homosexual who was the father of the modern day computer instead of him being the father of the modern day computer who was also gay. The movie is listed as Gay genre' and it defines the movie

The acting is great, Turing himself was a great man living in not such a great time in history but Hollywood took his story and turned it into a agenda for gay rights and I felt it over shadowed the story which was supposed to be about the enigma machine. BTW implying that Turing won the war or played God was totally off base, he saved lives yes but even without him Hitler would not have won the war. Still a good movie.",1429056000,,872,4.099415204678363
6796340,5,B00PC1FD9U,"A bit more melodramatic than the real thing but still fairly good presentation of the actual events, if you are interested in true fiction.  However, this is not the strength of the motion picture.  The story, acting and general feel of the picture is right.  It does an excellent job of presenting the time period that it deals with from the start of the Second World War to the Commies in the government hysteria of the postwar period.  The official persecution of ""Poofs"" and other ""unnatural persons"" by the English is also dealt with in a compellingly truthful way.  Alan Turning was a genius.  Everyone remembers him for his work on enigma but in actual fact he is the brains behind the whole field of computer science.  The movie is great and I recommend it for any number of reasons including the reminder that the human race murders its own best thinkers because they are different.",1429056000,,891,4.673076923076923

6796411,4,B00PC1FD9U,"I'm glad I didn't spend money to watch this movie in a theater. I thought the script was weak. Character development was rather sketchy. All in all, the information the movie was built on was interesting. Perhaps, if I watched the story again, I'd understand nuances a bit better, and be more generous with my review. Read about the real Alan Turing-- the book would be a lot more informative than the movie was--because it was dealing with detailed math, the presentation lacked specificity. All in all, I found the story ""mildly interesting"" but lacking passion and zest.",1428969600,,573,4.857142857142857

Alan was a brilliant mathematician and cryptanalyst who broke the German Enigma Code and saved an estimated 14 million lives due to his efforts and helped end WW2 two years earlier than predicted. I don't want to give away too much. Alan was harassed for being a homosexual during a time in Britain when you would be imprisoned if this fact were known.

It is however two stories within one for the main character is almost as enigmatic as the German Enigma machine. Often times idiosyncrasies, prejudices, ideology, moral leanings get in the way, which was certainly the case in this story. I liken the actions that took place post WWII to the Greeks ostracizing Themistocles from Athens, the Romans burning the Library of Alexandria or killing Archimedes, Hitler causing Einstein to flee to America because he was a Jew and a lighter example when Columbia Records let The Doors get away. The idea of clear thinking is the root of this story. The problem, one with a clear vision can bump into obstacles in the fog of society filled with its prejudices. ideology and moral leanings.

6796653,4,B00PC1FD9U,Interesting and well acted but it seems to try and cover three themes and doesn't do a complete job of any if them.  On the one hand it is the ultimate conspiracy and government control environment at a time when people did not recognize such things.  Then again it highlights the treatment of homosexual men in a time when tolerance was what you had for other countries not your own people.

This movie doesnt just teach you some history, but also dealt with some subjects that we are still dealing with today. Feminism, Equality, and just simple rights that everyone should have.

I do like this movie and recommend it if you have a free night and want to watch a good movie. I do wish the delved into the characters a little more, like the Russian Spy or even the English Spy or that they focused on the adult Alan Turing more than always cutting to a young Turing, because it took me a second to realize why he was in being interrogated. Still a strong movie though and it made more interested in learning about Alan Turing and how he basically invented the first computer.

As with any genius it is sad to see the troubles he went through just so he can continue his work.

Like many geniuses, he was tortured on many levels of thought, as well as physically on occasion. Mr. Cumberbatch played Mr. Turin with such spareness as to place him in stark contrast to all other human beings with whom he came in contact. Nevertheless, his vision and his persistence won their respect and even a certain friendship for awhile. Not to spoil what was a revelation to me about the decisions the team needed to make when applying the information that the machine gave them, I won't say what those decisions were, but I never realized people's lives in World War II were so affected by what the team did with the information. The film was mentally challenging and compelling, grim and funny all at the same time.

The only disappointment here is the slightly over melodramatic screenplay, which plays up this aspect of a great man's life rather than the benefits he bestowed on the whole world. Benedict Cumberbatch can do anything, so kudos to him for making the best out of this. But the writing just wasn't good enough to have him be at the top of the show. Keira Knightly is the one who truly shines in this offering. Her character was well written and her execution of the part was spot on.

Great cast: Cumberbatch is quite brilliant and true, but to a limited script and vision. If this is meant to depict just a moment in time it's a fine piece. If it's meant to portray in full the monumental moment in time, the players, the circumstances that won the war, it's incomplete. Maybe no such accomplishment is possible. So -- it deserves the plaudits it gets.

What is poignant and dealt with as best as would be possible within the confines of such a complicated life is the criminal trial, conviction and subsequent suicide of Turing due to his own personal sense of guilt, and social and political intolerance of his homosexuality.",1428624000,,853,4.6490066225165565

Its an adequately told story, generic in many parts (as far as the storytelling aspects are concerned) and it carries with it many tropes that the genre (historical biopic) tends to become roped into.  Still, this is a prime example of a story propelling the film forward, drawing you in with so much development.  Unlike the other British biopic of the year, The Theory of Everything, The Imitation Game is so rich in character development that it feels like a much more complete film, even if the score isn't as rousing and the editing isn't as sharp and the cinematography isn't as lavish.

If this story had those technical embellishments, the film may have been perfect.

I have to admit that I wasn't expecting a whole lot here, and maybe thats why I was kind of blown away with how much I connected to this, but the bottom line is that the film, despite a strong critical response and obvious Oscar attention, has its fair share of detractors; and they are loud.  Apparently many people view the film as a missed opportunity, a film that skirts around more important issues and tries to make Turings tragic (and heroic) tale into some sort of sappy Hollywood message film.  There were countless complaints that the film didn't focus on Turings sexuality enough, that it sidelined the most politically important aspect of his story, and yet to those complaints I genuinely askdid you watch the movie?

Seriously, did you watch it?

Im not going to say that the film was two hours of debating the atrocity that was Turnings treatment (and the treatment of all homosexuals) during and after the war, but the balance that Moores screenplay strikes between what Turning did for his country (and the world) and what his country (and the world) did to him is really well developed.

Sorry, haters can attack me all they want, but Im serious.

It doesnt nail everything (I found the relationship between Joan and Alan to be underdeveloped), but the important things are addressed with unexpected depth and delicacy.  The way that the film jumps from Turings arrest to his classified work and then pack again helps establish the development of his character all the way around.  Unlike the development (or lack thereof) of Hawking in The Theory of Everything, I felt like I knew Turning when The Imitation Game closed.  I felt him in my soul.  A lot of that is due to the fact that Benedict Cumberbatch is so IN THIS, always working to uncover more and more of this man, and the way his eyes betray his self-loathing and internal depression is so heartbreaking; but really the reason we know Turning is because Moore understood this man and knew how to develop him on the page, which translated beautifully onto the screen.

Turings life was inspiring, heartbreaking but inspiring, and as a society we can learn from what he accomplished and also from what he went through.  Forsaken by the people he helped save, the lives he helped preserve, the country he aided to victory, Turings life story serves as a lesson to us all about humanity and how even our heroes can become condemned because of a lack of it.",1428537600,2,3203,4.701252236135957

6796757,1,B00PC1FD9U,"A movie with some promise, but falls far short of the acclaim offered by the media.  While historically interesting, the code breaking aspect would have been much more intriguing, had it not been for the constant reminders that the main character was disturbingly attracted to his own sex. Most of this picture was shown with the intent that the audience should pity the poor man, with his unnatural inclinations.  The fact that the DVD was released just before the president asked for a ban on gay conversion therapy, begs inquiry. Clearly this movie was a promotion of Hollywood's attitude against such treatment, even though it has now been proven to be effective.",1428537600,13,667,4.946428571428571

A screenplay that follows an out-dated guide on how to make an Academy Award winning film.

For such an amazing story filled with inspiration and sadness, the filmmakers didn't bother to make any other aspect of the film daring, inventive or even slightly original. Almost every part of this production could have passed as a movie-of-the-week on some major television network.

6796880,4,B00PC1FD9U,"I read the book ""The Secret Life of Bletchley Park"" while in England one summer and was anxious to see this film.  The details of life during WWII in Britain are excellent, as are the details regarding the cryptography itself( they never said ""code breaking"").  Cumberbatch is perfect in his portrayal as, is Knightly, who always gets it right unless forced to play an American( see, or rather, don't see Laggies).  The only downside of the film is the rather heavy-handed message that tries to equate Alan Turing's gifts as a mathematician and computer designer with his sexuality.  The two are conflated as what makes him  ""different"" as if the two were conjoined in some way.  If you somehow miss this message, it is literally printed out for you at the end.",1428451200,,761,4.7272727272727275
6796881,5,B00PC1FD9U,"An extraordinary movie about an extraordinary but persecuted genius.  Benedict Cumberbatch is magnificent as Alan Turing, and the entire movie conveys the tension of Bletchley Park in breaking the German Enigma code.  Breaking the Enigma code contributed to winning WWII as much as troops on the ground.  In fact more so in that forewarning of a German attack, the statistics of where, when, and how, is vital to troop movement and the lessening of casualties.  It also highlights, through Keira Knightley's character, of the vital efforts of women decoders at Bletchley Park and their restrictions due to their sex.  It is also a terrible reminder, and current reminder of persecuting gay people or just anyone who is different.",1428451200,,729,5.1440677966101696

In retrospective, as the film devotes time to his childhood, he emerges as an extremely sensitive, brilliant, and determined individual with a rather intense manner.

What he accomplished was a great victory for the Allies. Great that he was on our side. His untimely death was so unfortunate, and saddening. I had some difficulty with understanding why such a great loss had to occur.",1428451200,,651,4.761061946902655

6796888,1,B00PC1FD9U,"The Imitation Game is based on a biography by Andrew Hodges.

But Hodges is said to be more concerned about the main story line, which invents a fictional relationship between Turing and John Cairncross, who was later identified as the fifth man in the British spy ring that included Kim Philby and Guy Burgess.
People who worked on separate projects at Bletchley were kept apart and Hodges labeled the scenario 'ludicrous'  adding that Turing and Cairncross would never have met.
He said: 'Their relationship is invented.'",1428364800,15,523,5.069767441860465

6796896,2,B00PC1FD9U,"This movie would have been great as a made for TV film but fell short on the big screen.  The whole story was told from Alan Turning's point of view in flash backs.  However, the unfortunate part was that it was often hard to tell the difference between the present 1951 and the past of 1939.  It was even hard to tell who was who between young Alan Turing and his friend at school.  Overall, the movie was over acted, because even the talent of Benedict Cumberbatch and Kiera Knightly could not overcome the dull script.  In the 'big' scene where they crack the code, they are all breathing heavily to try to add drama, but they are just standing around so there's no reason for them to be out of breath.  That is just one example of the efforts of the actors and sound people to make this film better, but it wasn't enough.  This film was adequate at best.",1428364800,,858,4.291925465838509

It reminded me very much of ""A Beautiful Mind"" which was much better, and more original in its story and production treatment. Then the homosexual storyline began, along with it's emphasis on atheism. Then I understood hollywood hype. It was right up their alley. The homosexual part of it was integral to the story.

Sadly it has fallen victim to the populist 'anything gay is good' genre of cinematic entertainment.
I think it would have been better produced if it had more fully explored the nature of genius, and the double edge sword that such genius can be for the individual bearing that burden.

Bottom line, Turing wasn't significant because he was homosexual, that was just another character flaw of his personality.  He was significant because of his intelect.",1428364800,,473,5.116883116883117

I know this story quite well, having begun to study the events at Bletchley Park so far back as the late 1970's.  This movie, ""The Imitation Game"" is truly a masterpiece.

The fault I think lies in trying to be appeal to everybody and as much possible not annoy anybody. It's like the authors decided they did their part in choosing the subject and decided to play it safe later. As many other historical movies, the characters suffer a time zone problem - they think and speak as educated people of the XXI century beginning rather than mid XX. Because of this it seemed to touch on clishees on occasion and even boredom.

Would have been interesting to see what would have came about had Mr. Ignarritu directed it! (And no, I did not particularly like Birdman, but the director definitely had a vision in mind and made something out of nothing)",1428278400,,763,4.569343065693431

It begins in 1951, while he's being interrogated for being gay, and then he's applying for the codebreaking job, then he's a boy at school, then he's meeting his obligatory love interest, Keira Knightley. So it's choppy, but it is an interesting story, and a very particular piece of gay history.

6797098,5,B00PC1FD9U,"Imitation game is based on the true story of mathematician Alan Turing, who tries to crack the enigma code with help from fellow mathematicians and faces some obstacles greater than just cracking an encrypted German code.

I was vaguely familiar with Turings story as it related to developing what would eventually become what computers are to us in this day and age but I was less familiar with his life story.  Although like most movies do, there are some movie moments that are less true to life than others, but that doesnt detract from me enjoying the story as it was presented.
Cumberbatch was brilliant in the role and played the slightly odd and eccentric Turing.  The story and Cumberbatchs portrayal of Turings sexuality, which wasn't accepted and prosecuted in the 40s in the UK, was well done and worked well with the story.

The supporting cast of Knightly and others were also good in their roles. The script and story also are well written and portrays the story in an interesting and entertaining manner.  And although it may not all be true to life, the movie interested and entertained me enough to want to learn more about the true story of Turing.  To me, that is a sign of a good movie that is worth watching.

Cumberbatch's portrayal of a gay man was not truly emphasized.  I felt that part of Alan Turing's life was downplayed in this movie, so one doesn't get the full impact of the prejudice of the time.  It seems Turing was discriminated against more because of his irritating personality.  I guess at this time with so many changes being made in American society towards acceptance of diversity in our population, a viewer might anticipate a more open and frank portrayal of a gay person's life at an earlier time.

Lest we forget!!!
I found the story fascinating and while it could have been boring with the repeated attempts to break the German code, they bounced it around enough with flashbacks of Turing's childhood at school and more light hearted scenes in the local pub to keep the story moving along.

I loved this tale and this movie. Benedict Cumberbatch plays the brilliant, and socially challenged (was he autistic?), mathematician Alan Turing who is working at Bletchley Circle with Britain's top cryptographers. Turing designs a machine - a forerunner of the computer - to help break Enigma's codes. This film provides compelling backstory regarding the formation of Turing's character and depicts what happens to Turing after the war. Turing was gay, which was a source of persecution. Although Turing was a riveting character in this film the story of how Britain broke the German codes and what they did once the code was broken surpasses Turing's personal story. Wish the movie could have detailed more of the strategy once the code was broken, but perhaps that would have been difficult to portray in film. This is my favorite movie of the year. Turing's work at Bletchley saved 14 million lives and shortened the war by two years this film tells us. It's worth watching for that reason alone.",1428192000,,1161,4.958974358974359

6797136,3,B00PC1FD9U,"Why does Hollywood have to rewrite history every time it decides to celebrate a new ""hero"" and add to the dumbing-down of the populace? This movie creates the false impression that Turing single-handedly created the machine that broke the German encryption machine known as Enigma, when in fact he built upon a machine known as the ""bombe"" that had been invented by Poles starting in 1938 that cracked the diplomatic code used in early versions of the Enigma. Further, there were others at Bletchley who worked on the machine with Turing who deserve credit, and that Turing had to ""fight"" for his machine to protect it against a jealous commander who wanted it dismantled is pure BS. Also, Churchill's decision to throw all available resources into cracking the Enigma's inner workings was due to a letter from several cryptologists at Bletchley (not just Turing) pleading for help, but though the letter worked, Churchill's decision was kept a secret.

Perhaps the most disgusting part of the movie -- no doubt to add to the ""drama"" but also the lies -- is its putting the ""Hut 8"" mathematicians into the position of making life-and-death decisions as to which targets of the Germans would be spared and which ones would not, in order not to reveal to the Nazis that the Enigma machine had been compromised. Please. Such decisions would obviously be made by higher-ups, not a handful of nerds. Also irritating and oh-so-Hollywood is the way in which Turing discovers in a casual pub conversation that some German Enigma operators were frequently signing off their communications with ""Heil Hitler!"" so that such sloppiness led to breaking the Enigma codes. Again, please.

Yes, Hollywood does this with just about every ""based on a true story"" movie, but it is lazy film-making, since the real facts are often just as good if not better than the made-up stuff. The film does do a good job, for example, of showing us Turing's weirdness and social awkwardness, something missing in the 2001 version of Hollywood's rendition of this complex man. But as to his homosexuality we witness next to nothing. We don't see the 19-year-old man that Turing seduced and whose friend then burglarized Turing's lodgings. Turing reports this burglary to the police, and in doing so got pulled into an investigation which led to his being prosecuted for homosexuality. Why not show any of this rather than the ""good cop"" interrogating Turing as the ""frame"" for this story? The movie airbrushes this essential part of his being out of the story. While I am grateful to be spared the explicit sex scenes, deleting the actual relationship or relationships Turing has tends to make him seem two-dimensional.

Perhaps some day there will be a Turing movie closer to the facts that will also include his 18 months in the US, where he spent time at Princeton and also observing what the Americans were doing with their own ""bombe"" machines (apparently untold millions were being poured into machines which Turing thought had significant flaws in them).

At first, this movie pursues a character driven angle to tell this story and, for the most part, begins to approach this fairly directly. Approaching the first hour, the movie changes direction a few times, deciding to pursue a heavy-handed social message and the whole story gets a bit muddled and lacks impact. Many of the characters and their reactions feel contrived, Cumberbatch - though in strong form - seems to be recreating some slight detour of his Sherlock character and Knightley merely seems to serve as a progressive bookmark. The sentiment feels forced and the historical impact of breaking Enigma gets lost in a hard turn towards the issue of sexual politics.

Benedict Cumberbatch is, as I expected, simply wonderful playing the very nerdy but very brilliant British mathematician that through much sweat and tears is able to build a computer like machine that is able to break the Nazis previously unbreakable Enigma code thus saving many lives during the Second World War.

 Benedict gives a truly Oscar worthy performance about the inventor of the computer like machine, Alan Turing.  Cumberbatch gives an extremely nuanced performance that reflects the many levels of a most complicated and basically unlikeable character that knows his worth and has to make some very unpleasant and unpopular decisions to achieve his goal of inventing a machine that will break the Nazis code of Enigma.

 Alan Turing (as portrayed by Benedict), of course, does not invent and solve the breaking of the Nazi secret code alone. He works with a team of top British mathematicians.  This is where serious problems arise because Turning has many issues that he is dealing withhes gay (at a time that it was a felony in England) plus he was extremely anti-social being hated by those he worked withhe having no social skills.  The members of the inventing team are acted by all very greatly being acted  by the likes of Keria Knightly (wonderfully portraying a co-worker that actually seems to admire and appreciate Turing), Matthew Goode, Rory Kinnear, Mark Strong, Charles Dance, etc.all giving great performances.

But, it was not this way, the movie was superbly done and rolled on with the core of the film about Mr. Turnings' work and the events that surrounded WWII.
This movie had snippets from WWII and I even learned more details about WWII and I wish we had learned more about Mr. Turing and his work and gift to humanity.

6797162,2,B00PC1FD9U,"What this mediocre film or ANY film in the entire world actually shown in a cinema or released anywhere outside of the internet will never tell you:

The National Socialist Germans under Hitler actually invented the very first programmable computer.

They also invented the first operational Jet engine and Jet aircraft, the first binary calculator, the helicopter, night vision technology, nuclear fission, state-of-the-art engineered waste-water and sewage treatment systems unmatched anywhere in the world, the Type XXI U-boat - the first submarine designed to operate extensively and for long periods of time underwater, television broadcasting - the 1936 Olympics were broadcast by television to television parlors, 3-D 35 mm films developed long before Hollywood, rocketry and much more, thats how repressed they felt themselves, so repressed that creativity just literally FLOWED out of them.

The Germans under Hitler built a 725 horsepower Benz with twin rootes superchargers which set the land speed record of 432.7 km/h (268 mph) over the flying kilometre on 28 January 1938. This still remained the fastest ever officially timed speed on a public road as of 2010. The car was the Mercedes-Benz W125 Rekordwagen and it looks more modern and aerodynamic than most cars of today. Google the photo and the details if you don't believe it and then wonder, like the most naive of babes, why the ""history"" channel never told you about any of this?

Some 300,000 patents and copyrights were stolen by Stalins allies from defeated Germany after the war without any compensation whatsoever to the inventors and authors.

Hitler and the National Socialists (based strictly on the principle of private property and having nothing whatsoever to do with Marxism) laid down 5 thousand miles of Autobahn in 5 years without ruining the German countryside or lanscape & for the first time every citizen who saved 5 marks a week had a chance to get a car. This car, designed by Hitler and Ferdinand Porsche, was the Volkswagen Beetle, which to this day, is the single most popular car model in history.

Gertrude Stein, a world-famous Jewish lesbian writer, spearheaded a campaign in 1938 to award Adolf Hitler the Nobel Peace prize.

""Hitler will have no war (does not want war), but we will force it on him, not this year, but soon."" - Emil Ludwig Cohn in Les Annales, June, 1934 (also quoted in his book ""The New Holy Alliance"").

If you want real history based on authentic period source documents as opposed to fabrications and complete BS, watch ""Adolf Hitler, the Greatest Story Never Told,"" and ""Last Days of the Big Lie"" both 2 seconds and two clicks away. Be prepared to have all your previous assumptions challenged and your mind blown.

Below are words from Denis Sefton Delmer, British chief propagandist after the capitulation of Germany in 1945 to the then German expert on International law Professor Grimm:

We won this war with atrocity propaganda and now we will start more than ever! We will continue this atrocity propaganda, we will increase it until nobody will accept one good word from the Germans anymore, until everything is destroyed which might have upheld them sympathies in other countries, and until they will be so confused that they don't know what to do anymore. When this is reached, when they begin to pollute their own nest, and this not reluctantly but with hasty willingness to obey the winners, only then the victory is complete. It will never be definite. The reeducation demands thorough, steadfast nurture like an English lawn. Only one moment of inattention and the weed will break through, this ineradicable weed of historic truth.

Delmer was the head of ""black propaganda,"" meaning forged documents. He managed not only groups of people working in this type of work, but also managed the relevant radio stations. He was a personal friend of the British Information Minister. In June, 1944, the Information Ministry sent out an official directive to all the higher-echelon civil servants and managers of the public media, instructing them that with the Red Army sweeping into western Europe, they would have to expect incredible cruelty from which they could distract world attention only through a strengthened atrocity propaganda campaign against Germany.

Sefton Delmer was the head functionary who carried out this work for the British government. His main method was to lie as exactly as possible so that the lies couldn't be uncovered right away. After the end of the war in occupied Germany, Delmer co-ordinated the ""black propaganda"" campaign with the French, the Soviets and the Americans. These co- ordinated lies and inventions could not be recognized as such right away. Delmer's work in occupied Germany lasted until 1947. During that period he and his staff forged a wealth of German documents which reached official files.

He described this work to a large extent in his own book. Udo Walendy testified that most of these forged documents had the Germans committing a large number of war crimes when no such crimes were committed at all. Delmer provided the documents to the British Ministry of Information which in turn sent them to the Nuremberg trial as actual official documents. The International Military Tribunal, pursuant to the London Agreement, did not check whether the documents were true or false, but simply entered them as evidence of ""generally-known facts."" Because they were considered authenticated official documents, they had now been introduced into history books.

In this situation, Walendy testified, even officially published documents had to be analyzed to determine whether or not they were forgeries.

The propaganda master succeeded in his mission of true lies to enforce a guilt complex upon the German people post WW2, which in part still exists to this very day.

This latest Hollywood flick is just one more example among THOUSANDS of Sefton Delmer type propaganda vehicles, only this time a bit more subtly disguised as an artsy-fartsy film with grade-A actors. Now, if you are actually naive enough to think Hollywood is unbiased, take this test: See if you can find EVEN ONE pro-Palestinian film in the entire history of the cinema. You can't?  LOL  And yet you never wonder why? Or why only ONE historical event is illegal to even question in 19 countries (including Vatican Italy and Putin's Russia) under threat of up to 5 years in prison just for first offenses. What kind of ""truth"" needs the threat of prison time to call itself ""the truth""? That which has never established the proper evidence or valid reasons with which to defend that truth, that's what. What kind of ""truth"" uses legalized coercion as its only argument? .",1428192000,,6725,5.070588235294117

6797165,4,B00PC1FD9U,"The Imitation Game is about a real life computer scientist during the World War II days named Alan Turing that played a significant influential part in decoding the German war machine.  Honestly I don't remember reading about him in history class ever and had to do a google search after watching the film to make sure the Imitation Game is based on actual evidence.  I figured it was given the... well, without spoiling the ending, the closing text of the movie.  Still I wasn't 100% sure since I never heard of the man before now.  It turns out his influence was huge.  Perhaps bigger than anyone could've guessed.  We're talking about a *computer scientist* from the 1940's.  That in itself should leave you speechless.

Anyway, while the Imitation Game is a decent film that eventually goes into territory related to Alan's sexual preferences which all seemed totally unnecessary since the focus for a lengthy period of time was clearly on his extraordinary computer advancement skills, what this movie lacks is a really good story.  For a good chunk of the movie, the concept hardly ever excites.  Perhaps one could argue it's not supposed to, but I think it should at least offer a little more entertainment than this.

The characters are all decent in their roles and perhaps realistic to the way they really were during World War II, but that doesn't automatically make for an entertaining movie in my opinion.  With that said, I was interested in the Imitation Game enough that it only occasionally lost my interest so I'm going to be generous and bump my rating to 4 stars, but perhaps if it was 30 minutes shorter with a few more action scenes it would've been better.  Maybe not action scenes necessarily, but *something* more.  Spending a significant amount of time trying to convince the world that you're a genius only to be criticized by your peers can only carry a film so far until I begin to crave more meat and potatoes in order to feel satisfied.

Benedict Cumberbatch, the man who plays the role of Alan Turing, does a tremendous job.  Though I know next to nothing about the supposed genius that is Alan Turing so I can't say for certain Benedict was doing an excellent representation.  I can only assume.  I also wish Keira Knightley was more memorable instead of a smart girl who excels at crossword puzzles.  She did have one memorable scene when Alan came out and admitted he prefers men but Keira offers a nice explanation why they should get married anyway which was cleverly said.  I'm also curious if the actual machine Alan and his men (and woman) created while being secretive was accurate.  If so, awesome!

The writing seems strikingly similar to other films such as Harrison Ford's Extraordinary Measures or Billy Bob Thornton's the Astronaut Farmer in that the atmosphere is usually reserved and stuck in the middle as a family-friendly movie, but never daring or truly creative.  I suppose the actual shots of WWII that occur occasionally throughout the Imitation Game go above the safe realm in that regard.  It's just a nice story that does its job and nothing more.  With that said, it tells it well enough to recommend but don't expect a classic.",1428105600,3,3188,4.763205828779599

Benedict C. is excellent, and Keira K. as well. The new Sherlock Holmes is the man to get for your movie now, and he definitely Sherlocked the Germans in this one.

Like most great tasks, his was accomplished with a team.  He may have been the ""genius"", but he was not alone.  Further, the portrayal feeds into the stereotype that brillant people are unpopular geeks and that homosexuals are ""different"" from the rest of ""us"" in ways other than their sexual preference. IT was not necessary to do this to make the story intersting. Turing and his team broke Enigma and thus arguably won the war. Pretty awesome story right there.",1428019200,2,614,4.728971962616822

If you watch the previews it looks like an interesting movie about WWII. But.......! There's a hidden agenda. One would think that the build up would be how the German code was broken and were defeated. But Nooooo.........! Too much (half) of the movie was spent building up to explain Alan Turning was gay . Towards the end of the movie, the writers made a big point that Turning would not have been able to achieve the famed accomplishment without being gay and how mean the English were to gay people. Hogwash! No relevance to the story.
Another propaganda movie to justify a questionable lifestyle. I watched the movie with my two daughters 11-15, they were embarrassed and disgusted. Both asked me what Turning being gay had to do with the story. I told them the story was about Turning being gay. Try to find the true story of the movie in any of the descriptions or trailers..... Oh, they're conveniently missing.

There have been several treatments of this story --this one is good. Cumberbatch does an excellent job portraying a brilliant but difficult man who is the grandfather of the computer? I read that Cumberbatch identified so strongly with the character he was portraying that after one particularly difficult scene he just broke down, because really, the man was treated very badly when he should have been recognized and hailed as a hero. I'm very glad that the British finally declassified the work of the people who helped with the Enigma project--though for many of them the recognition came way too late.",1428019200,,883,4.660256410256411

6797314,4,B00PC1FD9U,"Quick story blub:  A young math prodigy enlists in the British military service to help solve an impossible code to win WW II.  We also see his life from young boy to the man he was during and after the War.

Acting was amazing.  Benedict Cumberbatch was phenomenal in his role as the main character Alan Turing.  He was able to be completely awkward and cold toward characters on screen but still able to be loved and cared for by the audience.  His inner struggle toward the end of the film was also very notable too, Very enjoyable to watch a seasoned actor do.  Kiera Knightly was also on the very noticeably great list but I will say that everyone in the film was equally great in their roles and made getting into this film very easy for the viewer.  Well Done Cast!

Overall movie, I really liked this movie.  It was like a good mix of genres in that it is based on true events, so it is a historical film on WWII,  it is a spy film as we see the intelligence as the war being used in various ways, and it is a human drama as it portrays events in Alan Turing's life.  I can see how some people docked the movie points as way it was told in first person would have gotten Alan Turning in a lot more trouble (spilling secrets of the government)  than what he was in trouble for (crime of homosexuality).  Yes that is problematic movie making and a few other instances of stretching the truth too..  But it did have some nice snappy dialogue in it, interesting plot and dazzling actor performances to make me happy.  I'm giving it a 4 because I liked it, but I know it could probably be more like a 3 as in average movie for most people.",1427932800,2,1642,4.214743589743589
6797315,5,B00PC1FD9U,"The Imitation Game is one of those movies that you don't think youll like but once you start watching it, the story begins to intrigue you, the characters draw you in and next thing you know its over leaving you wanting more.

Based on a true story, Enigma is the name of a machine used to decipher a secret Nazi code used during World War II. Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a brilliant math genius hired by the British Government as part of a secret team assembled to save the world by cracking the unbreakable Nazi code.

In his dauntless effort to crack Enigma, Turing faces ridicule from his superiors and fellow team members. Turing isn't much of a team player so he sets out alone to create his own code breaking machine named Christopher. The geek in me loved this part of the movie, Christopher turns out to be one of the worlds first computers and like all computers computing speed and processing power quickly become the achilles heel as Christopher is just too slow to crack the Nazi code. Wheres Intel when you need them!

While working on breaking the code Turing develops an awkward romance with a fellow code breaker and mathematician Joan Clarke (Kiera Knightly). Alan and Joans romance is filled with twists and turns, ultimately these two people care and love each other deeply but theres something in the way ... (I don't want to spoil it for you).

As it turns out a happenstance conversation between Joan and one of her girlfriends in the pub one night provides new inspiration Turning and his team and eventually leads to the cracking of the Nazi Code.

Once Enigma was cracked the team initially thinks that the war will be over quickly but as it turns out the war drags on for months as Turing and his colleagues must keep the breaking of Enigma a secret as they helplessly watch thousands of their country man continue to parish.

Historians say that cracking the Enigma code lessened WWII by more than two years and saved millions of lives.

There are more surprises, twists n turns in this movie but I don't want to tell you about them here and spoil the movie for you.

I watched this movie with my wife thinking that she wouldnt like it either and as it turned out she loved the movie as much as I did.

The Imitation Game is one of those rare movies that sneaks up on you and surprises you ... its highly entertaining, educational and informative.

6797319,5,B00PC1FD9U,"THE IMITATION GAME is brilliant on so many levels that to single out peaks is frustrating. Fist the actual history recreated by the film is brilliant. The book by Andrew Hodges who joined Graham Moore in a the intensely intelligent screenplay, the direction and weaving in and out of clips from WW II with the tension of creativity meeting science meeting personal issues by Morton Tyldum is exceptional, the courage by all involved to share the homophobia of England during this period of time and the eventual suicide of the genius who solved the Enigma due to his `crime' of being homosexual, and last the cast - all spot on and terrific.

The startling fact is that this is a true story. Mathematician cryptanalyst Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) is in the nail-biting race against time by Turing and his brilliant team of code-breakers (Keira Knightley, Allen Leach, Matthew Goode, Matthew Beard) at Britain's top-secret Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, during the darkest days of World War II.

All of the characters are well cast - a group that includes Rory Kinnear (particularly poignant as the detective), Charles Dance, Mark Strong, et al. Add to that the musical score by Aleandre Desplat and the cinematography of Oscar Faura and the costume design by Sammy Sheldon and there are still others that make this exceptional film so fine.

I like World War II movies, I like spy movies, I like ""code breaking"" movies, I like movies about the British, but I did not like this movie at all.

The men and women that worked at Bletchley Park are certainly worthy of high praise, this movie is just not the vehicle for that.  I found the various documentaries done on television about Bletchley Park to be much more interesting.

During WWII the Germans sent cryptic messages that were easily intercept-able but impossible to decode. England enlists their greatest code breakers to find a way to crack the codes. Alan Turing (Cumberbatch) comes up with a machine that will be able to break any code they can come up with, while at the same time hiding his secrets from the world. This is just a fantastic movie. I had pretty high expectations going in and it met or exceeded everyone of them. I have yet to see the Theory Of Everything but Cumberbatch did an amazing job in this that I am not sure how he didn't win best actor. This is a movie that will both inspire, move and infuriate you all at the same time. I could go on and on about this but I will say just watch it. Today.

6797390,5,B00PC1FD9U,"I have seen quite a few movies on WWII in my day from The Longest Day with John Wayne and A Bridge to Far with Sean Connery to newer WWII movies such as Saving Private Ryan and the just recently released Fury. Some of these movies dealt with actual accounts of the war, others dealt more in fictional creations placed during that time period. None of them however quite compare to this movie, a movie about a British code breaker named Alan Turing played by an actor named Benedict Cumberbatch who, put simply, is one of the best in the business because of how genuine he is in his acting and how much he makes you care about the individual he is playing. This movie does not just have Benedict Cumberbatch, it also has a definitely well cast group of role and supporting actors with Mark Strong I headlining the group in a role, as head of British secret intelligence, that he suits perfectly. Then Keira Knightly, someone who I have to admit I have not seen act in much except in the latest Jack Ryan venture which did not instill much confidence in me about her acting abilities, also gives a performance that is astounding and truly heart-felt as the woman who becomes part of Turing's team and who helps him come to grips with what he has to do to ultimately accomplish ""the one thing"" that matters to him.

Overall, this movie is not only well cast, but also well written (with one specific joke that sticks in the mind), and beautifully directed by an individual who's name I cannot even pronounce and have never heard of. The one line theme that reoccurs throughout the film also gives it that Disney inspirational feel without the formulaic Disney formula itself. Finally, as the movie hints at in the trailers, the movie is not only about Alan Turing and his team breaking the enigma code, it is also about Alan Turing and him, after the war is over, being charged and convicted for indecency for being a homosexual. I believe the greatest thing about this movie is that there is no Hollywood propaganda or agenda about this or about the war itself, this movie simply interweaves 3 time periods of Alan Turing's life into 1 hour and 54 minutes and lets you see ultimately how this man became who he became and how his unwillingness to give up helped the Allies win the war. An achievement that helped save many-a-good-boys life.",1427673600,,2338,4.553444180522566

The movie shines a spotlight on the crucial contibutions of Mr. Turing and other brilliant minds to the war victory and to the development of modern computers, but it also reveals the tragic treatment he received because of his homosexuality.",1427587200,,657,5.092592592592593

6797409,5,B00PC1FD9U,"Alan Turing was a mathematician who, according to Winston Churchill, made the single greatest contribution to Great Britains war effort.

What did he do?

He created a machine that broke the Germans Enigma code, which shortened the war by two years and saved millions of lives.  That machine later developed into what would become todays computer.

Not the most likable person, Turning was a closet gay at a time when homosexuality violated English law.  After the war, despite what he had done for his nation and the world, Turing was convicted of performing indecent acts and forced to undergo chemical castration.

Directed by Morten Tyldum, THE IMITATION GAME is an engrossing film that relates Turings tragic story.  Graham Moores Oscar-winning screenplay frames the revered mathematicians life with the 1951 criminal investigation that led to his conviction, then flashes back to his efforts during the war and also to his formative childhood years.

Benedict Cumberbatch delivers a brilliant performance as Turing, a genius who has trouble relating to other people, thus prefers to work alone.  Keira Knightley is quite moving as the woman who helps him emerge somewhat from his shell and, for a time, becomes his fiance.  Also in the well chosen cast is Matthew Goode, Rory Kinnear, Allwn Leech, Matthew Beard, Charles Dance and Mark Strong.

THE IMITATION GAME was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture.

The Blu-ray disc from Anchor Bay Entertainment includes audio commentary by Tyldum and Moore, a Making of featurette, two deleted scenes, which should not have been deleted, and highlights from several Q&A sessions featuring the filmmakers and principal actors.

It's kind of ironic that I like this film, but the moment I saw the trailer I knew it was going to be good. It's about Alan Turing, a British Mathematician who distinguishes himself in several fields. He builds a computer, cracks German codes, saves thousands or millions of lives, and unfortunately takes his life because of a court-ordered hormonal therapy as a means of ""curing"" his homosexuality. I love Keira Knightly's character. She's intelligent, accepts Alan the way he is, loves him dearly and wants what's best for him. I would've liked for this film to have a happy end, but that's not what happened. I don't like the end or the fact that Christopher died, but if these things happened then this is what they should show. It has made me want to do some research on Alan Turing. Not every film can make someone want to do research on someone else's life. So they tried in the making of the film. I recommend it to all.",1427414400,3,1008,4.5136612021857925

6797469,5,B00PC1FD9U,"Wow. Just wow is all I can say about this movie. I am a big movie goer and I love to watch a really good film. When I heard that that our University student run theater was playing this movie I immediately jumped on board to watch it because of all the good commentary I have been hearing about this movie. When I walked out afterwards, I felt this uplifting feeling of euphoria that I get when I see something extremely riveting. ""The Imitation Game"" is one of the best films of the year in my opinion and this is my review of the wonderful film.

I had previously seen Birdman which won the Academy Award for best picture this year and I found myself not being fully invested in it. But throughout this film, I was captivated by the story of the life of the great Alan Turing. Alan Turing is a brilliant prodigy who often comes off as hostile and anti social throughout the film but eventually grows to make bonds among the people who would help him break the Enigma code that the Germans used to communicate during WWII and labeled as a communication system that was unbreakable. Turing and his team were able to make a code breaking computer device named Christopher which later is ale to decipher the Enigma code but the movie goes beyond the mere story of trying to find the key to the Enigma.

This movie has numerous layers to it which made it that much enjoyable. It covered topics from the morality of war to the persecution of homosexuals during the time period and even had a message to say about bullying of individuals who are different from the normal population. There are so many aspects of this movie to sit down and talk about. If you are a fan of social commentary this movie is a must watch. I could talk for hours about this movie to a colleague and break it down to pieces and analyze it.

Benedict Cumberbatch was the star of the show. The fact that he could make an anti social and arrogant Alan Turing into a likable character is stunning. It is really a feat if you can make an audience care and feel for a character with a sour personality. Keira Knightley did a splendid job as well and her character just showcased the oppression of women of the time. It so sad to see that women with brilliant minds were often oppressed and never even allowed to exercise their talents to contribute to the intellectual world.

I recommend everyone out there who has an appreciation for films to go watch this movie. The main message of this film is that despite adversity, people can set goals and follow through. It is a great message for people who believe that they are not good enough for a passion that they have and this movie will certainly become an encouragement. This movie is BengirlxD approved.",1427328000,3,2722,4.438
6797470,5,B00PC1FD9U,"Great from beginning to end!

Tyldum is methodical and precise in which he decides to unravel the story, Turing is one of the fallen heroes of our history and his story stands as one of the most tragic.

What I expected was a group of really smart people working intently to decipher the enigma.  However,  I did not expect the twist and turns that the movie would bring.  Some involved the WAR.  But the most interesting, was the character of Turing himself.  I will never understand how someone so gifted and so valuable could have been treated, even bullied by the very people he helped the most.  It was in the end a cowardly act of cruelty by his own government.  Turing was a hero but never received a heros welcome.

Cumberbatch does a fantastic job as the enigmatic Alan Turing whose only goal is to solve problems, and in this case ""The Problem"", an unsolvable problem, breaking an unbreakable Nazi military code.

This film is based on actual events, events that were classified top-secret until decades after the end of WWII.

6797538,5,B00PC1FD9U,"This is a very touching and engaging film about the life of Alan Turing, the founder of the modern digital computer and the pioneer in algorithms and artificial intelligence. What was not known for nearly five decades was that he was also one of the key scientists who played a major role in cracking the Enigma codes used by the German Military by building what would be a programmable computer. This contributed greatly to the Allies' victory in the Second World War and saved many millions of lives. Turing was a  homosexual and had to keep it somewhat hidden all his life in those days of homophobia in Britain. Eventually, he was charged with indecency in 1952 and forced to undergo estrogen treatment in order to 'cure' him. Sadly, Turing committed suicide in 1954 by consuming cyanide.

The story is narrated beautifully by switching between three significant stages in his life
- Turing's high school days when he is in love with Christopher, a schoolmate,
- his time and work at Bletchley Park in the 1940s where he meets his future wife Joan Clarke
- his encounters with the police in the 1950s when he is charged with indecency on account of his homosexuality.
However, the major part of his life was spent In Bletchley Park, where, after months of struggle to decipher the Enigma machine, Turing and his team accidentally stumble upon a clue whereby they can find secure data to decode the cipher using a repetitive message string. Once this was done, it becomes important to keep playing the 'imitation game' where the Allies pretend as if they have no clue about Enigma. They only  selectively use the intelligence gathered from Enigma so that the Germans are always kept believing that Enigma is secure. The movie's title is probably inspired by this because there is more than one imitation game going on in the life of Turing. He himself plays it by being secretive of his homosexuality. A third imitation game is also alluded to in the later life of Turing when he tells the police officer, investigating him for indecency, about the 'Turing test' to distinguish between a human and a machine.

The film is studded with brilliant acting. Alex Lawther as the adolescent Turing is superb in conveying his capacity for human passion through his delicate interactions with Christopher. Benedict Cumberbatch as the temperamental Turing and Keira Knightley as his wife Joan Clarke, give powerful performances which bring to life the context and atmosphere of Bletchley Park in those tumultuous days. The film also raises questions about the standard narratives on the Allies' victory in WWII where victory is normally attributed to the great leadership of Churchill and Stalin and also to the sacrifice of millions of men from the USSR and the West with their lives. This film shows that the decoding of Enigma on July 9, 1941, possibly saved 14 million lives and helped end the World war two years sooner. It is these mathematicians and scientists who probably are the larger heroes of WWII but unfortunately, for security reasons, they had to remain unacknowledged for fifty years!

The film has taken some liberties with truth, possibly to make it more interesting. The portrayal of Turing as rather brusque, at times arrogant and somewhat insensitive to other peoples' feelings and being secretive about his homosexuality do not fully square with facts. According to many other accounts, Turing was openly soliciting male companions, was quite accessible as a colleague and many in Bletchley Park were said to like him. One major falsehood portrayed in the film is about the discovery by Turing of John Cairncross in the Bletchley Park team as a Soviet spy. It is believed that the first time Cairncross could have been  suspected as a spy would be only when the two MI6 double agents,  Guy Burgess and Donald McLean, fled for the USSR in 1951 and a search of Burgess' papers showing some references to John Cairncross. The statement by Steven Menzies, the British intelligence chief,  that British intelligence  knew well that Cairncross was a Soviet mole and  that MI5 actually planted him in Bletchley to control the information and disinformation that they want to feed Stalin, seems rather far-fetched. Books on the super spy Kim Philby show that Philby was feeding such a volume of high-value intelligence to Stalin (as a result of his access to the `Ultra' program) that Stalin was in disbelief and even suspected Kim Philby of actually misleading the USSR. So, Stalin's problem was one of plenty rather than paucity of information. This is confirmed in his book by Yuri Modin, who was the Soviet handler of all the five MI5 moles in London. Though Cairncross did work in Bletchley Park, he was never part of the Enigma team. Also, a fellow-mathematician, Gordon Welchman, who helped Turing design his machine is conspicuous in the film by his complete absence and even a mention.

In spite of these liberties with truth, it is one of the best films I have seen recently. Turing wrote in one of his papers that intellectual activity consists mainly of various kinds of search. It sounds so prophetic today when I read it here in the Silicon Valley, using a Google WiFi.",1427155200,,5192,4.888636363636364

6797545,3,B00PC1FD9U,"I rushed to see this when it was released, having been a fan of most of the cast, notably Cumberbatch, Kinnear, Strong, and Goode for some time. The film, as most of the other reviewers have outlined, examines the role of mathematician Alan Turing in helping British Intelligence break the German wartime code, thus bringing World War II to a close earlier and saving tens of thousands of lives. Turing was homosexual, and the anti-homosexual laws in Britain did not come off the books until the 1960s. Thus, the film travels two trajectories: one tracing the elite team's struggle to break the code, and the other tracing Turing's struggle to come to terms with cultural and legal attitudes towards his sexuality and try to find emotional satisfaction in a life constrained by necessity. Cumberbatch's strong performance as Turing really carries the film, with excellent supporting performances by Rory Kinnear as the police detective who has his eye on Turing (for the wrong reasons), Mark Strong (an actor I have admired since seeing him in ""Our Friends in the North"" and more recently in ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"") as the military office supervising the code-breaking team, Matthew Goode as a member of the team trying to break the code, and Keira Knightley, also part of the same team, as the woman with whom Turing struggles to form a relationship that will disguise the true nature of his sexuality and keep her on the team when her parents object. Special mention must go to the young actor, Alex Lawther, who plays Turing as a young boy at boarding school.

It is the script, not the cast, that brought ""The Imitation Game"" down a few notches from what should have been memorable to ""good enough"". It is an ""Oscar-bait"" script through and through, guilty of predictable shifts, political correctness in the messaging, a downplaying of Turing's active homosexuality, and of reducing Turing to another of Cumberbatch's quasi-Asperger type characterizations - which Turing was not, at all. I assume Cumberbatch was giving the director, Morten Tyldum, what he wanted - in my view, Cumberbatch is in serious danger of being typecast now and should at all costs avoid any more socially inept genius roles. The script was decent and serviceable, but ""Brokeback Mountain"" with its much riskier and in fact flawless script, was a far more heartbreaking film about closeted homosexuals. Except for two scenes that I can think of (Cumberbatch's last with Ms Knightley and an interview with the young Turing in his Headmaster's office) the film as a whole never rose to heartbreaking. I was perhaps one of the few who was not surprised when ""The Imitation Game"" was shut out of nearly every major award (including Best Actor for Cumberbatch's performance) for which it was nominated after the Toronto Film Festival - the Globes, SAG, Director's Guild, etc., outgunned by ""Birdman"", ""Boyhood"", and Eddie Redmayne's performance as Stephen Hawking in ""The Theory of Everything"" (speaking of Oscar bait). This looked at first to be Cumberbatch's and ""The Imitation Game's"" year, but somehow it did not pan out that way.

Had its writers, director, and producer been willing to take more risks, the kind of risks Ang Lee took with ""Brokeback Mountain"", things might have turned out differently. Still, this is worth a place in your film library, not least for the intelligence of Cumberbatch's performance.",1427155200,3,3403,5.031914893617022

6797578,5,B00PC1FD9U,"This is the story of Alan Turing, the inventor of the digital computer.  Some say ""modern digital computer.""  The first digital computer was counting with your fingers (sometimes called ""digits"").  Then a few thousand years ago the Chinese invented the Abacus which is a simple mechanical digital computer, and since then there have been mechanical calculators which are technically digital computers.  However, Alan Turing invented the Universal Computer now called the Turing Machine which even today can simulate any digital computer (although too slow to be practical).  The Turing Machine is a beautiful theoretical construct rivaled only by Einstein's theories, and Claud Shannon's Mathematical Theory of Information.  In the movie and reality, Turing constructs a special purpose electromechanical digital computer to break the Nazi code machine during World War 2.  While Turing worked in England, Physicist Richard Feynman used to tell the story of how the calculations were made to develop the Atomic bomb during the same period.  For every calculation 3 great geniuses would sit and calculate to see if they got the same answer.  John Von Neuman (also a great computer scientist) made all the calculations in his head while Enrico Fermi used an old fashioned mechanical digital calculator called an ""adding machine,"" and Feynman used a slide rule.  All 3 usually agreed to 3 decimal places.  So American computing was almost no where when Alan Turing was building his code breaking computer.  In the move and reality, the Allies could not act on all the intelligence learned by decoding their messages because it would tip off the Nazi's that their code machine had been broken.  Alan Turing, being the typical Aspberger Genius, came up with statistical calculations that would determine who lives and who dies.  He did the right thing -- which would still be the practice today.  Since the American government does such thorough Survellience of the American people, almost every law suit could be resloved using secret government information, but they can't divulge their secret evidence because it would compromise the survellience system.  This was a great stress on Alan Turing as it would be on anyone who has to decide who will live and who would be sacrificed.  Although the British credited Alan Turing for shortening the war and saving millions of lives, British anti Gay bigots murdered him.  These days the British bigotry has shifted to Marijuana users, and away from Gays.  Hope the English rise above their bigotry some day.

When my son was 7 years old, I taught him Alan Turing's theories and allowed him to cheat on his math homework by using a calculator.  He became a mathematical genius child prodigy.",1426982400,,2732,5.149659863945578

The Imitation Game is absolutely worth the time (and money). I'd recommend waiting for the rental (as of this writing, you can only buy it on Amazon Instant), but when that price drops, it's a must see, If you enjoyed A Beautiful Mind and/or The Theory of Everything, this film shares much of the same backstory: a socially-awkward genius, struggling with love (though novel here), but who contributed something of immeasurable importance to the world.

Cumberbatch, recently of Star Trek fame (as the young Khan), turns in a briliant performance, as does his co-star, Knightley, and the supporting cast.

If I had to say one thing about this film, it's this: what differentiates it from the others, it is that - for me - the ticking-clock story (the British race against the Nazi military juggernaut) and plot were more compelling than the performances themselves. If compared and contracted to those, the acting performances took, if you will pardon the pun, center stage. Here, while the acting was excellent, it was not as utterly consuming as the leads in A Beautiful Mind (Russell Crowe) and Eddie Redmayne in The Theory of Everything.

Most people who are abject geniuses have ""social"" issues and his were compounded by his homosexuality, so I'm not convinced he had OR NEEDS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH a syndrome he may not have had.

I disagree with some of the other reviews that the homosexual message takes too much of the film.  It COULD have been reduced, but I think that it needed to be stressed to show how dangerous it would have been for him to come out (or be outed by his coworkers) at that time.  In the end, we see that his medical castration stopped his genius and that would have lost the war.  SO.......where do you draw that line?  I think the film showed how imperative it was to just let him keep going as he was.

Finally, the film brings out nuances of war and the team specifically that most people may not realize until they see the film.  It also shows just how influential this was to the success of the war and how imperative it was to hold it secret for so long afterward.

Excellent acting from Cumberbatch, but I anticipated that.  Knightly was also better than I anticipated.  I recommend it, but with the realization that a lot of the true history was left out and altered.....but the main idea (or feeling) of the time is really well done.",1426809600,3,1683,4.352564102564102

While I enjoyed the movie, ""The Imitation Game"", I stumbled onto the following on Youtube: Unsolved Mysteries of WWII

In the first chapter, they discussed the fact that the Polish worked to crack Enigma in an earlier time frame.  Was it in fact,
the Poles that passed their findings/intelligence onto the British that cracked the code once and for all?

If any history buffs out there read this, any (and all) feedback would be appreciated!

Four stars for the movie...but, was anything (else) left out?",1426377600,2,526,4.931818181818182
6797588,5,B00PC1FD9U,"The Imitation Game is one of those must-see movies of 2014 that is gripping on multiple levels. The Nazis have developed an unbreakable code machine that transmits vital information, which can be used against the allies to pinpoint their locations. Around the world the greatest minds alive have tried to crack the code without success, until Alan Turing's eccentric idea of building a machine that can think.

Benedict Cumberbatch, the outrageously popular British actor, portrays Alan Turing, the genius mathematician and logician who cracks Germany's Enigma Code. Along with him are other brilliant minds of the day working around the clock to find an answer.

Alan is not the most congenial of individuals. Bullied as a child in private school, he's an odd sort of young man who has difficulty fitting in because of his brilliance. As he grows up, his people skills have not improved, and he has the unique knack of alienating those around him. While others on his team push pencils all day long attempting to break the code in 24-hour spans, before the German's change it again, he's fiddling with building a machine to do all the work. Undeterred by setbacks and critics, he continues onward until he succeeds.

The movie works on many levels for a variety of reasons. While we watch Alan attempt to do the impossible, we are reminded of the horrors of war from actual clips from World War II that reiterate the importance and urgency of breaking the code.  In addition, once the code is broken, the secrecy must be kept so the German's do not realize their accomplishments. Instead, the brilliant men and one woman spend the remainder of the war crunching statistics on the number of casualties and the effects of actually using bits and pieces of information obtained from the Germans to direct those missions that would be most successful.

Beyond Alan's intelligence, there is passion for succeeding and the struggle to be true to himself among a world that does not understand him. Benedict's performance is absolutely astounding in portraying the emotions of Alan Turing. To add to the complexity of his character is the fact that he is a homosexual, living in an age when such lifestyles were criminal offenses. Benedict's ability to take hold of each of these characteristics and display them with such heart-wrenching accuracy, is worth any award he may garnish for his performance.

Also in the movie are other familiar faces, including Allen Leech (Downton Abbey's former chauffeur), and Matthew Goode (who nearly got hanged in Death Comes to Pemberly). Keira does a fine job as the only brilliant woman in the group, who impresses Alan by solving a challenging puzzle in less than six minutes.

The movie also delves into his post-war life and the struggles he faced afterward. He was arrested and convicted as a homosexual, and rather than do time in prison chose to take chemical castration drugs to curb his homosexuality. A few years later, he committed suicide but received a royal pardon 60 years later from the Queen.

With all of the movie's intrigue and emotional highs and lows, I highly recommend The Imitation Game.",1426291200,3,3145,4.943181818181818

It can feel overly traditional in places - structurally it's a movie I've seen a thousand times before - but I really enjoyed the performances and the angular look given to its cast. Nobody's a complete saint or sinner, even Turing himself, and the film is at its best exploiting those hidden character motivations and personality quirks. Benedict Cumberbatch is the most visible performer, of course, engulfing the screen as the intensely-awkward codebreaker who possesses neither wit nor tact. A kind of autist savant, he's very good at one thing and that is not social interaction. I was more impressed with Keira Knightley, though, as his fiancee-of-convenience, Joan Clarke. Her eyes dazzle with caged intellect, as much a victim of the era of misogyny as Turing was to a jealous, homophobic witch-hunt. Together the two positively vibrate, a beautiful partnership that was ultimately bound to self-destruct.

He was likewise the ideal choice for the very difficult prodigy, Turing. Child prodigies who are busy leap frogging over every other competitor are typically difficult children who become even more difficult adults. Add in that Turing's field was math and that he was gay and you assuredly do NOT have James Bond.

Turing was of course the one who broke the Nazi enigma machine which allowed the allies to decode German messages sent using it. This was a key part of winning WWII.

Rejewski was a fine mathematician and statistician, but he profited most
from being forced to be a German cadet in high school (before WW1

children were beaten for speaking in Polish). As Rejewski freely admitted,
all his math theory was insufficient to breaking the code. The version Rejewski
cracked was used throughout the War by the SS and other military services.

Alan Turing is the central figure in the film ""The Imitation Game,"" directed by Morten Tyldum, from a script by Graham Moore. Turing is a young professor with no social graces, a nervous demeanor, and an obsessive personality. Benedict Cumberbatch portrays him as a highly-strung and single-minded scholar who is more comfortable with numbers than he is with people. Turing is determined to build a machine that, he hopes, will crack the code faster than any human being. Unfortunately, Turing is obnoxious, his superiors have little confidence in his abilities, and his colleagues treat him with disdain. However, the woman on his team, Joan Clarke, (played with wit and compassion by Keira Knightley), befriends Alan and tries to soften his rough edges.

This is a good, but not great, movie. The performances are fine, the plot moves along at a brisk pace, and we can all use a reminder that there were men and women who fought against the Nazis using the power of their impressive intellects. To its credit, the film points out that the British government was extremely harsh towards gay men in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

6797617,1,B00PC1FD9U,"Warning: some plot points are revealed in this review

If you see this picture without prior knowledge of Alan Turing's life, there is some probability that you might like this (otherwise, I can't explain its high ratings here or its raving reviews), but anyone familiar with the life of this remarkable individual will rightly see this movie as a travesty.

But first let me put forward some good things to say about this movie: there are some fine production values, there is some fine acting here (especially by Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing) and a good, if flashy direction (by Norway's Morten Tildum). But they all struggle against a worthless screenplay. This is the worst screenplay I have ever seen put into a movie. Worthy of having been written by a pretentious high school student, it is a mixture of ludicrous melodramatics and historical illiteracy.

The movie give us a rough, true outline of Turing's life (brilliant mathematician, computer pioneer, very nerdy personality, helped break Germany's Enigma machine codes during the war, which proved very important in the battle of the Atlantic facing English ships against German submarines, his career crashes dramatically in 1952 when after a burglary in his house police finds he is a homosexual, which was a criminal offense in Britain until 1967, forced by a judge to take hormone therapy in order to avoid prison).

But alongside this true outline a lot of falsities are added. Just to mention a few of these falsehoods, without being exhaustive: 1) the movie never tells that it was the Poles before the War who first constructed a machine that was able to break Enigma. Turing and his team (not just him) did build an upgraded machine that was able to crack an upgraded Enigma, 2) Turing's military superiors - personified here by commander Denniston (Charles Dance)  hate Turing so much that they threaten to fire him, charge him as a spy or destroy his code breaking machine. Turing avoid their threats by appealing directly to Churchill. In reality, Turing did appeal to Churchill successfully for a higher budget for his outfit, but the relationship between him and his immediate superiors was nowhere near as bad as the movie shows, 3) when Turing was arrested after the war for homosexuality, there was never any suspicion by the authorities that he might be a Soviet spy.

In the phoniest scene in the movie, Turing and his coworkers decide not to tell their superiors that they have finally cracked Enigma, since they are afraid that if Germany realizes that the code has been broken, they then will switch it to a harder code. This is made despite the tearful pleadings of one of the code breakers whose brother happens to be in a ship about to be taken down by German submarines. Decisions like this were actually made during the war, but they were taken at the highest military and political level, not by the cryptoanalysts.

In the most ridiculous scene in the movie: Turing realizes that one of his fellow code breakers, named John Cairncross (played by Allen Leech), is a Soviet spy. He discovers this when he see he has a bible with a passage marked that has been used in a message by a mole. Cairncross tells Turing that if he blows his cover, he will tell Turing's superiors that he is homosexual, and Turing gives in to this blackmail. There was actually a Soviet mole named John Cairncross in Bletchley Park, Britain's wartime code breaking facility, but he never worked alongside Turing, and might never have met him.

Turing was a remarkable figure, a scientific genius, a privately tormented person, who also did extremely valuable work during World War II. It is sad that his story is finally brought to screen (after so many decades) through such a terrible movie. The real story of Turing and the decipherment of the Enigma machine can be found in many places, either in books, TV documentaries or in the Internet.

Turing himself, however, would begin to see that only a machine could beat a machine, and would end up (with much opposition) building one that would break the code, ultimately saving millions of lives and (according to some) shaving what may have been years off the war itself by leading the Allies to victory.

6797624,4,B00PC1FD9U,"The Imitation Game
  If you are looking for an espionage thriller similar to The Code Breakers or The Ultra Secret don't look here.  The Imitation Game tells the tragic, heart bending story of Alan Turing, the unsung and virtually unknown mathematical genius who did as much or more as any general to bring World War II to a successful conclusion.  The Nazis developed a code making device called Enigma by the Allies which resisted all attempts to penetrate its secrets.  A small band of British mathematicians eventually made a counter machine powerful enough to break the secret of Enigma.  This struggle has been covered before both in print and on film.
 The personal story of Alan Turing has until now been known to very few.  Many people with genius level intellects have a difficult time inter acting with ordinary mortals.  We find no exception in Alan Turing.  He carries the additional burden of homosexuality in a time when society in Britain not only frowned upon such but actually legally prohibited its practice.  Turing, already cut off from nearly everyone by his towering intelligence was further and unhappily separated from general society by his sexual preferences and social bigotry.
 The film covers three discrete tales.  It tells the story of the battle to break the Nazi code.  It also tells the tragic life story of a brilliant man who deserves our acknowledgment for his service to humanity in defeating Nazism.  And finally it displays the injustice of by-gone social conventions and the toll they take on the unconventional.  That packs a lot of story into one hour and 54 minutes.
 Director Morten Tyldum has only two other and very minor films to his credit.  Blasting right into the stratosphere of an Oscar nomination seems like a hard act to follow.  Screen Writer Graham Moore has no other writing credits.  This makes an amazingly successful debut for him.
 The compelling story is matched by terrific performances by an outstanding cast, headed by Bennedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing.  He manages to portray the distracted genius as an emotionally and social isolated man who never the less has the same kinds of emotional needs as the rest of us.  He is matched by Keira Knightly an another mathematician.  The two fall into one of the oddest and most intellectual kinds of love.  The relationship between the two makes the film for me.
 Made on a slender $14 million budget the film grabbed 8 Oscar nominations and an invigorating box office gross of $126 million.  The PG-13 film rates a somber four saw blades for a tragic story told and acted at the highest levels.",1422835200,2,2609,4.870454545454545

He is a man who did so much for his country and for the war effort and yet, he didn't receive in his life the recognition he deserved. At the time of his life, British law treated gay individuals with barbarity. Embarrassed by public prosecution and robbed of his faculties by a drug program that dulled his thinking, he took his own life; the victim of a society that treated homosexuals as mental patients rather than regular people. Turing was the father of computer science and artificial intelligence and his story deserves to be remembered along side those of all the other World War II heroes.

The story of the Bletchley Park surely had many more secrets than the ""Bomb"" machine made by a charismatic and eccentric British scientist. The film focuses on the human tragedy of Alan Turing making time leaps between his childhood, the war years, and 1951 and as such it is good, but generally is more interested in Turing the codebreaker, not Turing the gay man. The Imitation Game winds up feeling like one of those films where the real story, in this case Turing's personal life, is happening off-screen.

6797632,3,B00PC1FD9U,"The day after Christmas I went to see the movie.

Thats right, I went out to the mall on THE DAY AFTER CHRISTMAS, which is only slightly less tortuous to my psyche than Black Friday.

I wanted to see it that bad.

I also wanted to like it SO BADLY, I waited nearly a month to write this review.

The Imitation Game is entertaining, well acted, and keeps ones attention from start to finish.

Benedict Cumberbatch does an excellent job playing the character.  I loved the interactions between his character and Charles Dances as well as he and Matthew Goode. I have no objections to his best actor Oscar nomination.

The Imitation Game has a good message concerning judging differences and acceptance. It does. I tried to convince myself this and the acting and cinematography were good enough reason to like the movie and review it positively.

I did like the movie. I cannot review it positively.

Why?

It isn't is the real story of Alan Turing or the work of Bletchley park.

Now I had heard ahead of time that there were changes to the story. Im cool with that. I understand that when adapting something to the screen its often necessary to change things for time or story flow.

Believe me, The Enigma doesnt flow well.

I also heard it was changed to make the issues in solving the code to be more simplistic. This I also get. Having read the book, I can attest the average movie goer isn't going to want to sit through the explanations I read through.

I walked away from the movie wondering just what book this was supposed to be based on. It is not accurate to the book, nor to the time period. It doesnt  realistically represent the work at Bletchley park, Alans relationships there, or most especially, the role Joan Clark played in Alans life.

The movie reduces Joan to a shallow plot vehicle. It is incorrect in how they met, how she was hired,  her parents lack of support, why and how they were engaged, how the engagement was broken off and the amount of time they spent together. Essentially, they erased Joan Clarks legacy in order to give a shallow representation of Turings.

The same can be said for Alans childhood friend/love Christopher.

Christophers storyline is interspersed and also shallow. I don't believe it accurately portrays their relationship nor the depth that his loss had on Alan as much as establishing he was bullied and gay.

There was also a spy story thrown in. I guess to make it more exciting? I don't know.

This movie could have been made significantly better by using the same cast and making it a miniseries so as to fully explore the story.  I think real life stories can be dramatic, and also fairly accurate without being documentaries.

I am sure the movie will lead some people to learn more about Mr. Turing. However, many will walk away thinking that the story is spot on and not bother to dig any deeper.

It seems the message was more important than the actual man.



As an aside, many watching and reviewing the  movie want to label Alan Turing with aspergers or autism spectrum disorder.  I do not think diagnosing the dead on second and third hand information is either accurate nor beneficial to living people with autism spectrum disorder.  Unlike Cumberbatch, my objections having nothing to do with ableist notions of false hope or speculation as to childhood neglect but because diagnosis is simply more than a relatives opinion or interpretations of interpretations of second hand reminiscences of behavior. Its like some crazy game of historical telephone where misconceptions and the stereotypes they re-enforce are no game.",1421884800,18,3595,4.714743589743589

.

For me, Alan Turing has been a hero for many, many years. As a Science Fiction fan (A.I.), a computer nerd, and a gay rights advocate/straight ally, I've long been aware of the story of Turing's work and life. Add to the mix, a genuine admiration for Benedict Cumberbatch's work and it was clear from the moment I heard of The Imitation Game, I would have go see it. It was worth the wait. This is a straightforward biopic, with the major focus of which being on Turing' work at Bletchley Park in creating a machine that could break the German code device we know as Enigma. Enigma enabled the Germans to transmit messages through basic radio frequencies, but because of the complexity of the code, the messages were completely undecipherable by the Allies. That is, until Turning created ""Christopher"", a proto-computer capable of making the multitude of computations necessary to break the Nazi code and learn the precise locations and movements of the German forces.

 ""The Imitation Game"" also offers glimpses into Alan Turing's childhood at boarding school to help us understand the human behind the machine. We learn that Christopher is Alan's sole friend in a rather hostile environment, and that Alan discovered he has deeper feelings for Christopher than platonic friendship. The young Turing, played by Alex Lather, was a fantastic bit of acting. We also see after the war when Turing was charged with indecency after admitting he was a practicing homosexual.

 The film, while being a rather typical biopic manages to stay fresh and interesting through a fantastic cast that clearly enjoyed working together, a steady pacing, some lovely camera work and scenery, and a fantastic score by Alexandre Desplat. Cumberbatch's performance as Alan Turing was everything I anticipated, namely, an outstanding portrayal of a brilliant, but flawed man. ""The Imitation Game"" is a solid movie, emotionally attractive to anyone with a heart, and subtle and nuanced enough to anyone with a mind. I fully expect this film will receive several award nominations in the coming weeks.",1421712000,3,2115,5.066091954022989
6797634,5,B00PC1FD9U,"""Sometimes it is the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine."" Several characters repeat this observation during ""The Imitation Game"" and that is an apt quotation regarding the life of Alan Turing.

The Imitation Game is a superior biopic/ docudrama, telling the story of Alan Turing and the breaking of the ""unbreakable"" Enigma Code during World War II.

The story was kept confidential for many years. The factual material provides the basis for an intriguing and thought provoking movie, which entertains, informs, intrigues and at times confronts. There is tension, drama- and secrets, both official and personal.

Apparently, some dramatic license has been taken in bringing the story to the screen, but that does not detract from the experience of watching this compelling movie.

What is it about? During World War II, a secret group is assembled to crack the ""unbreakable"" Enigma secret communication code. The story blends historical fact about how this was done, as well as the frustrations of doing so. Intertwined is the personal story of Alan Turing, a mathematical genius. At the end of the movie, it is claimed that Turing's work saved the lives of 14 million people.

This is a fine movie of its genre, with excellent performances from the cast. Benedict Cumberbatch delivers a nuanced performance as Turing- illustrating again his command of portraying complex characters.

Morten Tyldum, the director, has successfully captured the mood of war time and immediate post war Britain.

While this is a modern movie, with frankness about personal relationships, it reminded me of the understated treatment in British war movies (such as ""The Dambusters"") and the restrained fashion in which heroes lives are commemorated in such films.

This is rewarding and thought provoking viewing.",1421712000,,1835,5.217687074829932
6797635,3,B00PC1FD9U,"There have been many books and indeed many films concerning Enigma and Ultra.  All are unsatisfactory to varying degrees.  The present effusion suffers from a common defect.  It is hard to engage us, in cinematic terms, by presenting decryption, or its value in the war effort: one is visually dull, the other incalculable.  One is left to stage moral dilemmas or descend to caricatures of hobbits in Bletchley huts, sledgehammering us with reminders that queer little folk can do great things.

Turing and his colleagues in Hut 8 were crucial to the effort to break the Enigma code machine in WWII but hardly unique - there were hundreds of other acts and ideas that contributed to cracking the codes and keeping that achievement secret, playing out from the early 1930s.  Turing's vaunted Banburismus procedure was abandoned and the bombe machines he invented (to compute the socket plugs and wheel combinations set on the enigma) were successfully upgraded by others.  There was no eureka moment but a series of them.  And the ethical predicament posed by 'cracking' enigma, leading to Ultra, was a multi-dimensional operation by MI6 that had little to do with Turing, who, of course, had to cope with certain secrets of his own.

At least The Imitation Game is one of the better of the crop - contrast the notorious U-571, which features gallant Yanks rescuing an Enigma machine from a German sub (they didn't) and tricking an enemy destroyer into sinking the sub (they didn't).  But ultimately it seques into a misleading mishmash of A Beautiful Mind, Little Britain, Dad's Army and Rain Man.  Although Benedict Cumberbatch is fine as Turing, Keira Knightley (here assuming a meld of Kate Winslet and Helena Bonham-Carter) archly leads a supporting cast of stiff upper lip types. Better to read Enigma:The Battle for the Code by Hugh Sebag-Montefiore or Codebreakers edited by Hinsley & Stripp (with a short chapter by Joan Murray, nee Clarke).",1421625600,29,1949,5.003095975232198

6797637,5,B00PC1FD9U,"This movie was entirely fascinating and deeply moving. One of the best movies I've seen, and I've seen thousands.

The story was gripping. The stakes were high and I learned a lot that I didn't know about the war - I had heard about the Enigma machine but I didn't realize the Allies had cracked it. I am now fascinated by the question of how the intelligence should be used at that point - someone please do a book or movie about this! I haven't found a good book on this specific topic. I would also love to see a sequel/spin-off movie with the MI6 guy as the main character.

After this movie I was compelled to google up more information about the history. It doesn't bother me too much that liberties were taken with historical facts. Yeah, I'm somehow still always surprised when I find out biopics aren't accurate. But I have to remind myself this is not a documentary. The aim of a biopic like this is to tell a story, hopefully in an artful way. It's not a documentary or even a straight biography. As the director said, no one judges Monet's paintings on his accuracy.  Also, of course, ""historical fact"" is a problematic concept. As Hayden White said, ultimately all history is fiction anyway.

Cumberbatch and Knightley did superb jobs. Cumberbatch deserves an Oscar for this.

This movie is a lesson in tolerance to those of us who find homosexuality problematic and even distasteful. The official treatment of Turing was inexcusable - I'm glad we have come to understand these individuals better and have evolved as a society. I was glad to read on Wikipedia that Turing's death was perhaps not suicide - I certainly hope it wasn't. The movie was a bit propagandish for gay rights, yeah. But it's in the great tradition of Dickens, etc. in highlighting social ills. And I thought the topic was tastefully addressed. I recommend everyone see this film for the tolerance lesson alone.",1421539200,8,1896,4.664670658682635

After successfully convincing Commander Denniston about his theory behind Enigma code, Alan Turing begins work alongside Peter, John, and Hugh. But due to an unexpected shortage of members, a woman Joan Clarke comes into the picture showing skill early on in cracking a certain puzzle in a short amount of time. But there is so much more to The Imitation Game.

It is no surprise to me that The Imitation Game has received high acclaim. Starting with Benedict Cumberbatch, he IS a force to be reckoned with in The Imitation Game. He methodically portrays Alan Turing as this mysteriously intuitive person with a troubled past; and with Cumberbatch's incredible acting ability he does a marvelous job portraying Alan Turing. It has been awhile since I have seen Keira Knightley in a movie, but she was definitely just as great playing Joan Clarke. I definitely like the bond she shares with Turig which provides The Imitation Game (especially towards the 3rd act) with a lot of memorable moments. Charles Dance(also plays Tywin Lannister on Game of Thrones) stars here as Commander Alastair Denniston and does a nice job being a prominent presence. Matthew Goode plays Hugh Alexander and does well. Mark Strong also does a really good job playing General Stewart Menzies.

I also really admire the pace of the story, which is not a term I use (as often as I should) but the pacing of the story is scripted perfectly. The Imitation Game shows Alan Turing's life and his genius in a very structured/timely manner which I also would give credit to the movie's direction. The movie does not test your thinking as initially perceived, but The Imitation Game does in fact have some touching moments and a strong quote that remains prevalent throughout the course of the film.

I definitely enjoyed this film to the fullest extent and definitely consider The Imitation Game

6797640,5,B00PC1FD9U,"Alan Turing is perhaps the most underrated genius of the 20th century -- the creator of a computer that allowed the Allies to win World War II. In return, his country persecuted him for his sexuality, and eventually may have killed him.

And while a movie about a math nerd making a cryptographic computer sounds rather dry, ""The Imitation Game"" excels at making code-breaking suspenseful and intriguing -- espionage, leaked lies, a giant clacking computer, and Benedict Cumberbatch's performance as an awkward, earnest, lonely man wrapped in his secrets.

The story veers between three major time periods -- Turing's school days as a young teen, whose awkwardness and intelligence left him with only one friend; his time in Hut 8; and finally, his decline after the war when his sexuality was finally exposed. All these periods are haunted by a grey cloud of tragedy, as you can never avoid the feeling that Turing cannot escape his tragic fate.

The most important one is his war work: hired straight out of Cambridge, Alan Turing (Cumberbatch) was confident in his ability to break the unbreakable Enigma Code, which all German communiques were coded with. Since the code was scrambled every day, the cryptographers had only a matter of hours to figure it out. But Turing knew a way -- an electro-mechanical bombe computer, which he referred to as Christopher.

He amassed a team of other math geniuses -- including a clever young lady named Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley) -- and began work on his computer. Even the computer wasn't able to crack Enigma.... until Turing figured out a core phrase that they could use.

But cracking the code was the only the beginning. Turing took part in a massive web of lies and secrets, designed to hide Enigma's decoding from the Germans and English public alike. And Turing had his own lies and secrets -- as a gay man living in a time when it was illegal, he lived under a sword of Damocles that would inevitably fall.

""The Imitation Game"" is both an inspiration and a tragedy, a depiction of an important period in history and a powerful personal story. By chronicling the most relevant parts of Turing's life, it sheds light on one of the most important endeavors of the last century, and a small group of people who played a pivotal part in ending the war.

Benedict Cumberbatch is the heart of the movie. While he's playing yet another socially-awkward genius, he brings an earnest vulnerability -- almost an innocence -- to Turing's personality, and is quite plausible as an intelligent math nerd. He makes your heart bleed when he encounters an obstacle, and sing when Christopher finally breaks the code.

He also has just the right brand of chemistry with Knightley -- their Turing and Clarke have a sort of passionate friendship, based on intellectual connection. So they click, but not in a sexy way. And Mark Strong rounds it out nicely as an MI6 general who recognizes Turing's potential and importance, while also manipulating him.

Director Morten Tyldum also manages to make some parts of this movie... pretty exciting. A bunch of people sitting in a building breaking codes and watching a bombe computer clack and whirl around? It sounds dull. But he builds up powerful emotions, through a quiet sense of drama (Turing being blackmailed into silence by a Soviet spy).

What is wrong with it? Well, like many biopics, it plays fast-and-loose with many details. Most distracting is the depiction of Turing as a high-functioning autistic -- dividing his food, excessively literal-minded, socially awkward. It's like Hollywood can't conceive of mathematical genius existing in someone who ISN'T a savant, which Turing certainly was not.

""The Imitation Game"" has some flaws, but the overall experience is a powerful, tragic depiction of a great man who never received his proper due in life. Without a doubt, one of the year's best movies.",1421366400,15,3894,4.929770992366413
6797641,5,B00PC1FD9U,"I love this movie. I was still crying an hour after it was over and the next day I pre-ordered it. The performances are amazing, especially Benedict Cumberbatch and Alex Lawther who played a young Turing. The two of them were just fantastic they made Alan real. I was really impressed with Lawther. I hope to see him in more films. I don't like Keira Knightly, at all, but even I can admit that she did well in this film.

I knew the history but I was so blown away by this film. It shows World War 2 in a completely new way. What they had to do to ensure victory was just crazy. What was done to Turing is just, to put it simply, an injustice.

But back to the film, it has a lot to say and it says it well, it's unflinchingly honest. I'm a bit torn about the ending, I felt like it pulled back a little bit instead of going for the knockout punch. At the same time, I think it was subdued enough that it got the point across without alienating anyone.

Overall, this was a beautiful film. It was intense, funny, infuriating, depressing; it's an experience. I think everyone should see it because it is so good and because I just wish more people knew about Alan Turing. I can't wait to get my copy and I'm sure this goes without saying at this point but I highly recommend it.",1421280000,,1278,4.165991902834008
6797642,3,B00PC1FD9U,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Creating a screenplay based on the biography of Alan Turing was by no means an easy feat. Had it only been about cracking Nazi Germany's 'Enigma' code, screenwriter Graham Moore, would probably have been at a loss to make the whole thing work dramatically. But wisely Moore includes flashbacks to Turing's early days at an English boarding school as well as flash forwards over his tragic fall from grace regarding his then-banned homosexual lifestyle.

Nonetheless, it's instructive to ask how accurate 'The Imitation Game' is - as Slate Magazine asks in an article of the same name. Is it true, as Dana Stevens states in Slate, ""The Imitation Game doesn't do right by the complex and often unlovable man it purports to be about."" Stevens read Andrew Hodges' biography of Turing and noted how Turing's true story differed in major ways from the way in which he was depicted in the film.

Stevens ""discovered that 'The Imitation Game?' takes major liberties with its source material, injecting conflict where none existed, inventing entirely fictional characters, rearranging the chronology of events, and misrepresenting the very nature of Turing's work at Bletchley Park."" Should we conclude that Turing's story was substantially compromised due to what Stevens terms 'major liberties' taken? The question should be re-framed: if major liberties weren't taken, could the screenwriter have made it work at all?

One of Stevens' big objections is that the Bombe, the big ticking machine Turing is supposed to have invented himself, actually was created by a Polish scientist. What's more, Turing collaborated with another scientist on the machine's design (which is not even mentioned in the film). This seems like a minor point as the film is about Turing, and playing with the biographical facts in such a way hardly seems like much of a sin.

Of more concern is Stevens' charge that Cumberbatch's depiction of Turing as narcissistic and detached has ""more in common with the actor's title character in Sherlock than with the Turing of Hodges' biography."" Stevens indicates that the real Turing was ""very approachable"" and the men at Bletchley Park, were very fond of him. Turing was eccentric to a certain degree and adding in a degree of narcissism didn't detract from the drama, in my opinion, but may have added to it.

Stevens concedes there were a good number of real incidents incorporated into the film (the young Turing being nailed under the floorboards by bullies, as well as a romantic interest in a boy at the boarding school). Stevens quibbles that there is no mention in Hodges' biography about Turing's obsession with separating the peas and the carrots.

While Stevens takes issue with the depiction of Commander Deniston as a rigid naval officer who at one point attempts to fire Turing, he concedes that the made-up conflict between the two men is a ""stand in for a real-life power struggle between the military brass and the cryptologists."" Stevens notes that, ""Turing's colleagues there recalled that Turing was always impatient of pompousness or officialdom of any kind,"" which made him ill-suited for work in a military context, and Hodges writes that he 'had little time for Denniston'.

Turing's note to Churchill, which got the project additional funding and put him in charge, never happened. But Hugh Alexander, one of the principals there, along with a few colleagues, did write to Churchill successfully requesting more staff and resources in 1941.

Alexander is presented as Turing's rival in the film, but Stevens notes that Alexander didn't work with Turing until a year went by and there was none of that conflict between them as depicted in the film. Alexander was a diplomat, which contrasted with Turing's lack of ability in that department. Still, creating a rivalry between the two, seems within the purview of standard dramatic license. The same goes for Turing's relationship with Joan Clarke, the only female mathematician who is part of the team. Clarke did accept Turing's homosexuality but of course the violent argument between them never happened. Still I would argue, creating a conflict for dramatic purpose does not detract from the narrative's overall effect.

One point in the film which never took place and seems a bit forced is when one of the team's members, Peter, begs Turing to save his brother, who is on a supply ship, about to be torpedoed by the Germans. This is after Turing and the team have cracked Enigma but refuse to save the brother, as alerting the ship, may tip off the Germans. In a film like this, the narrative depends on invented dramatic moments, and again, this is another necessary, albeit forced, example.

'The Imitation Game' still has been the subject of some legitimate criticism. Amy Nicholson in the Village Voice finds the treatment of Turing's homosexuality to be sanitized: ""Despite its brusque lead, The 'Imitation Game' is too mannerly to ask Cumberbatch to act on Turing's feelings. There's no flirtation, kissing, nothing that even hints that Turing ever felt the jolt of sexual electricity that would prod him to, at 39, sleep with the 19-year-old hustler who burgled his house and got him arrested. (That, too, happens off screen.) Turing is kept tweedy and neutered, as closeted in celluloid as he was in real life... The plotting goes for surprise over struggle. Tyldum has robbed his own film of emotional depth -- this Turing is as simple as Morse code. Rather than a complex human portrait, this is an assemblage of triumphs, tragedies and tics.""

Gregory Ellwood also echoes Nicholson's criticism: ""In effect, much of Turing's gay life is completely washed over. He says he had numerous affairs/lovers, but the film pushes the central relationship between his one-time fiance Clarke as the most prominent.""

Despite the historical liberties, screenwriter Moore has done a reasonably good job in telling Turing's heroic story. One only wishes Moore dealt with Turing's homosexuality in a more straightforward manner.",1421193600,11,6060,5.090634441087613

Alan Turing was a British brilliant mathematician and I believe that the term brilliant is putting it mildly. During WWII Alan Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park and led Hut 8, where a method was devised to break and read the code of Nazi Germany's Enigma machine.

The nature of deciphering is at the heart of this film. But what is truly being deciphered and perhaps broken? The machine, the method and the man all come under scrutiny. There is an allegorical nature to it all. Benedict Cumberbatch is Alan Turing and his performance is riveting, emotional and heart breaking at times. One thing that is absolutely interesting is that through Cumberbatch's performance you get the real feel of someone who has Asperger's syndrome. Through Benedict Cumberbatch we see Alan Turing as a man with unique difficulties. I was glad to see that director Morten Tyldum focused on this.",1421193600,2,1050,4.932203389830509

6797648,5,B00PC1FD9U,"""Imitation Game"" is a dramatization of the vital British code-breaking operation at Bletchley Park during the Second World War, built around the life of Alan Turing, the genius who built a pioneering computer (in the 1940's!) to aid in the code-breaking.  It is a challenging movie to watch.  Viewers without knowledge of the Second World War (or the Cambridge spy ring) may find it hard to follow the shorthand version presented here.  The code-breaking effort takes a good part of the movie, perhaps too much for those not appreciating the difficulties or the stakes.  The story itself is told as a series of flashbacks, as an older Turing is in police custody for ""indecent acts"" with another man, alternating scenes of his boyhood and his wartime experiences.

The good news, and the reason to see the movie, is the terrific acting.  Benedict Cumberbatch (BBC's Sherlock Holmes) is heartbreaking as the well-meaning but literal and almost unlikeable Turing, a world-class mathematician upon whose shoulder some terrible moral decisions will be placed.  Keira Knightley is strongly effective as Joan Clarke, the rare female mathematician who is Turing's co-worker.  The supporting cast is excellent, especially Mark Strong as Sir Stewart Menzies, the ruthless head of MI6, who sponsors Turing.  Rory Kinnear is surprising sympathetic as the policemen who investigates Turing after the war.  Turing's co-workers at Bletchley Park manage to be individuals in spite of their smaller roles.  An ""Aha"" moment late in the movie is especially priceless, as a seemingly casual remark in a bar has the crew running back to their place of work.  ""Imitation Game"" is a short movie but highly recommended as a powerful movie experience.",1420848000,,1727,5.194945848375451
6797649,5,B00PC1FD9U,"Let's the the little stuff out of the way. I'm told that there are some historical weakness in this. I know from seeing it that there are weaknesses in discussing the math. Neither detract from an exceptional film

This takes a nonlinear approach to three eras of Turing's life: childhood, maybe age 10 or 12, in a boys' school, his wartime work on the German Enigma code, and the last year or so of his life. Transitions come often, but without leaving the viewer disoriented. This seems almost ironic given the the utterly linear approach Turing took to his life and the people around him. I've met brilliant people (though not of Turing class), and Cumberbatch nailed one feature precisely: the naive, somewhat lost sense that comes out in trying to navigate the thoroughly nonlinear, even irrational conventions of daily human life. Whether or not Turing actually had such Asperger-like traits, I found them portrayed clearly and sympathetically.

Although the historical events in the film are gripping enough, perhaps tweaked up a bit for dramatic purpose, the movie's salience to current concerns is what stays with me. There's Turing's persecution for being homosexual - an injustice we still deal with. Recent executive orders allows gays to serve in the US military without having to hide. I knew that to be a step for social fairness, but this movie drives home the criticality of letting every citizen serve. Rejecting the one man (or woman) with that strategically unique talent, just because of who they date, lies somewhere between stupidity and outright treason. There's no reason to expect a Turing in today's services, but the notion of losing one seems tragic.

Then, Turing didn't just invent a whole branch of mathematical theory, he didn't just apply a range of skills to winning the war, it could well be that the single-handedly redefined warfare. Today, deep mathematics underly ever aspect of communications and cryptography. That one mind and its work at Bletchley appear, as far as I know, to be the first decisive instance of that application. Then, once code-breaking (and later, code-making) took on a rigorous mathematical foundation with machine automation, Turing applied statistics to military strategy with unprecedented rigor.  Cost/benefit analysis has always been there, but Turing's Bayesian analysis took it to a whole new level. I'm told that, even today, there's a split between the old-school military analysts and those who embrace (or at least tolerate) the math to one degree or another - Turing did a lot do open that split, if not create it himself.  And, because of his innovation in signals intelligence and warfare, Turing sowed the seed of today's cyber-war, the silent war being fought right now, under our noses.

Not least, there was that intense little boy, the one whose intensity (according to the movie) saved 14 million lives and shortened WWII by two years. We have intense children today, often boys, allowed less and less to be the ""odd duck."" Instead, their nature is redefined as pathology, then drugged into compliance with mediocrity. I know very well that dealing with intense children can be demanding and frustrating. But losing what they could have offered is a silent tragedy, silent because we'll never know what they could have done for the world.

I found this brilliant and moving in itself, and eerie in some undeveloped foreshadowing. (The cyanide in his lab and the apples as gifts to coworkers - when you know how his life ended, they give a bone-deep chill.) But the only stories that last are stories that describe every age. Turing's life does that.

6797650,5,B00PC1FD9U,"As a viewer and a reviewer, I tend to be less enthusiastic about biopics more than any other subgenre of film mostly because of the innate problems of trying to sum up all the parts of a person in two or so hours, and also partly because of their usual tendency to be more award-bait crowdpleasers (and Academy voter-friendly) releases than an attempt to be honest and forthright about their subjects. Then there are films like THE IMITATION GAME, director Morten Tyldum's fascinating and devastating journey into the life of one of the most important people of the 20th century; mathematician and inventor Alan Turing, portrayed to perfection by the fantastic Benedict Cumberbatch.

As the film opens, it's 1951, and a tall, slender man is seated alone in a Manchester police interrogation room. Suddenly, it's 1939, and Nazi Germany and England are at war. The Nazis have an encoded method of transmitting information and a machine used to decrypt those messages known as Enigma. At the behest of the British Government, brilliant mathematicians are gathered at a ""radio"" factory in Blechley Park to work on breaking the codes, of which there are 159 million million different permutations. One of those mathematicians is Alan Turing, a brilliant, arrogant, socially inept man who is convinced that the other senior member of the team, the suave and also brilliant Hugh (Matthew Goode) and his team will not break the code, but that Turing will build a machine that will. Turing doesn't seem to understand or just doesn't care that his dealings with his fellow cryptographers only push them farther away. In comes Joan Clarke (the WONDERFUL Keira Knightley), the only person that Turing sees as an equal partially because of her innate intelligence but also because of her immediate status as an outsider; something Turing identifies with because of his ""abnormal"" tendencies. Turing is homosexual, which at the time up through 1967, was criminalized by the British government, which is where we go back to 1951 where Turing has been arrested for ""indecency"", and ignored and dehumanized by the government he, for all intents and purposes, saved.

Again, biopics walk that fine line between lionizing and humanizing their subjects, and it's the best ones that are able to walk that line leaning more towards their humanity despite their accomplishments. And Tyldum, best known for his work directing the Swedish crime thriller HEADHUNTERS, proves himself more than capable of not only capturing Turing's time working on Enigma, but also jumping around in time to his predicament and judgment in 1951 as well as time as a young outcast in school in the late 1920's. Smartly, Tyldum doesn't add too many stylistic flourishes, save for some impressive CG war sequences or using newsreel footage, and rather lets his wonderful ensemble do most of the work for the film. Along with Cumberbatch and Knightley, an impressive who's-who of British character actors, such as Charles Dance, Mark Strong, Goode and Rory Kinnear are all extremely memorable. But if the film goes to any one person, and not to diminish Knightley's continuing remarkable work of the last several years, ultimately it's Cumberbatch, whose traditionally strong and commanding screen presence shown with such remarkable results as the BBC's SHERLOCK as well as STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS is actually purposefully diminished. Instead of him commanding all eyes on him at all times, he is slight and almost unrecognizable in his presence. It's almost as though he's not even there, making you that much more in tune with who Turing was. He was the invisible man, seen only by a few, and until recently when the Enigma secrets were declassified, was just a mathematician who died in relative obscurity. Now, he's seen as the visionary he was, regarded as the progenitor of artificial intelligence as well as the father of modern computing. And he's also seen, rightly so, as the victim of an unjust society whose stifled and puritanical beliefs essentially condemned him to a much earlier grave than a man like that should ever have received.

THE IMITATION GAME goes down easily as one of my favorite films of the year, and one of the best biopics of recent memory.",1420761600,,4227,5.035714285714286

_________________________________________________

Based on a true story about a professor in Britain who is chosen along with other hopefuls to crack the code of the Nazi Regime. The film takes place during WWII and sees an Enigma machine that is considered unbeatable and to the aid of Germany. Alan Turing believes he can crack the code with a machine and end the war before more lives are lost. The film stars Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley in a gripping and smart film that studies how man and machine could fuse into one and would then spawn what we now know as computers. Director Morten Tyldum provides a first hand look at what led to the defeat of the axis powers and tilted momentum to the U.S. and Britain.

I wasn't sure what to get out of The Imitation Game at first glance because the trailer didn't reveal too much, which is a good thing compared to todays standards. And my gut feeling came to be correct afterwards to conclude that there was way more to the film then meets the eye. We follow Benedict Cumberbatch as professor Alan Turing with a smart and uncanny demeanor towards his employer and his comrades who he is to work with. But Turing also has deep emotional struggles that follows him to a young age when discovered that he was homosexual. This plays a big part for Turing as his secret can essentially get him killed if anyone were to find out. Between 1885 and 1961, the idea of homosexuality was condemned and led to many deaths. By the time Turing cracks the code and sways the pendulum to the allied forces secrets are let out and consequences would follow.

The entire performance by Benedict Cumberbatch was what made the film great and entertaining cause not only do you understand whats at stake with the war but also he realizes whats at stake for himself. And its interesting how they took the film from being a story about spies and secrets to understanding the difference between man and machine. Alan even names the machine after his closest friend while at a young age that has more of a purpose later on in the film. How one acts and how one reacts to things is focused on and becomes more of a mind study then anything. Cumberbatch was brilliant and brought life to his character that by the end you could feel sorry for.

We also have to talk about Keira Knightleys performance as Joan Clarke who aides Turing along the way. I especially enjoyed her part because of the fact when Alan was searching for some of the smartest minds in the world he didn't have a clue that Joan would be one of them as most of the individuals were expected to be men. She had a big heart who came from a family of hardworking people and even had feelings towards Turing. And by the end, even though she finds out Turing is homosexual, she still cares for him and helps him in his time of need. Knightley was great in this film and has yet to give a poor performance and is growing as an actress.

There has to be a mentioning of the soundtrack by Alexandre Desplat as its warm and adds to the story. The orchestra work was wonderful to listen to as Desplat got a good handling with theme of the film. As for the co-stars actor Mark Strong did great as he and Turing had good moments together. Their characters had a lot of respect for each other despite the danger of a spy lurking within Turings group. As a whole you couldn't have asked for a better cast or story that blends drama and sophistication so well together its brilliantly done.",1420588800,8,3537,4.494556765163297

6797654,4,B00PC1FD9U,"I went to the movies last night to see The Imitation Game with Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing. Now I am not a great movie goer - I would rather wait for the DVD - it is cheaper. The special trip was triggered partly by the subject matter, but more the opportunity to share the experience with my daughter and youngest son. Sarah flies back to London tomorrow.
 Cumberbatch does a really good job as the tightly wound but loosely coupled (puns that will be clear and possibly amusing when you see the movie) Turing. The film does a good job capturing the time period - though I think Foyle's War and the Bletchley Circle are better. It also illustrates how clever and ruthless MI6 were.  The guy who plays Menzies is exceptionally good - as the cold blooded, gifted liar and duplicitous head of MI6.  What the movie does not do is to shed light on how Turing actually thought - except for the humor emanating from his literalness - how he actually conceptualized the machine that could ""imitate"" the German Enigma machine and the real technical challenges in getting the machine or BOMBES to work.
 The movie's strongest dramatic point - though on reflection, it could have been better done - is the moral dilemma of allowing avoidable immediate casualties in order to protect the fact that the Allies had broken the German code.  Many know of the Coventry incident.  The certain deaths of women and children on the convoy was a new twist on the awful decisions that had to be made to protect this vital secret:  protected more by pall bearers rather than a bodyguard of lies
 The movie does do a good, if somewhat superficial, job at the relatively simple task of illustrating the gross unfairness and barbarity of British attitudes towards homosexuality. My adult kids jumped all over this aspect of the movie and understandably voiced moral outrage at the treatment of Turing. Alas the movie did not leave room for posing and contemplating the bigger and more prevailing issues as how to change and evolve cultural taboos in a way that is maximally beneficial and does not create dangerous backlash.
 It is certainly worth watching when it comes out on DVD!",1420588800,6,2164,4.703703703703703

And what about the Poles who created Enigma-breaking machines before Turing and his cohort, and which they relied on?  And what about his cohort, which was much more important than portrayed?  And what about the mystery surrounding his death, which is not viewed by all as a suicide, and even if so not viewed by all as being directly related to his hormone therapy?  This movie sets things up so simplistically, it is an insult to the complex life of human beings.

He may even have saved the life of my own beloved grandfather who worked in the Brooklyn (New York) Navel Yard all throughout World War 2! A military target that would have eventually been within reach of German submarines.

If it wasn't for Alan Turing's genius, integrity and perseverance all of history would have been changed for the worse. Another minor footnote: He's also the father of the modern computer and one of the greatest mathematicians who ever lived.

Despite being one of the giants of the 20th century, few people outside those with a passion for history or computing have ever heard of the man until now. No universities or streets are named after him. No statues or portrait honor him anywhere in the world all because he is gay. In fact, it took the Queen of England to the year 2013 to issue him a pardon for having consensual sex - in the privacy of his home - with another man! In 2013! That's an abomination. The Queen of England is sitting on her throne in one piece because of this man! She should have laid a wreath on his grave decades ago!

I'm not ashamed to admit it, but I sobbed at the end of this movie! This is a most profound story about love!  YES! LOVE! Intense, passionate love is not limited to just heterosexuals!

It's also a story about sex. I was born in the 1960's and consensual sex - in the privacy of one's home - between men was legal in the State I was living in when I turned 18. But the stigma of being a sexual minority remains in way too many places - and affects me greatly in my own personal life to this very day. The pain I - and others - have suffered for being ""different"" is indescribable. This story validates my experiences and the experiences of millions of other sexual minorities - from around the world - both living and deceased.

The cruelty Alan Turing experienced from his classmates is similar to what I had to endure in high school. But I was lucky; I never had to worry about having consensual sex with another man in the privacy of my own home. But in Alan Turing's case you get to see a good man who gave so incredibly much to the world be ripped apart by pure evil that was 100% legal back in the 1950's! It's so ironic too! Watch closely. The police officer breaks the law and he is the one who should be legitimately imprisoned! It's not just in the United States that police officers feel they are above the law they supposedly serve!

Memo to Hollywood: This shows you know how to make great movies. Sure, you won't make billions every time, but you're gonna make a tidy profit by doing a spectacular job. Wouldn't you rather make a film people will be watching 500 years from now on another planet in another solar system then making trash, like The Hobbit trilogy, that no will care about once it leaves the theaters?

One more point to ponder: Michelangelo is considered by most people to be the greatest sculptor who ever lived. He was a gay man and he lived five centuries ago - in peace - till he died at 88 (Yes 8-8). Now fast-forward to the 1950's - in what was supposedly the country that birthed modern democracy - and look what the British did to one of the greatest mathematicians that ever lived only because he is gay!",1420329600,3,3289,4.380327868852459
6797657,3,B00PC1FD9U,"I'm going to start by saying that The Imitation Game is a great movie; however, it takes a lot of liberties with the subject matter. The broad sweeps are okay, but the details were, shall we say, exaggerated, no, actually, twisted to make the movie ""better."" It's a little unfortunate, because I'm sure the movie could have been just as good if they had kept to the straight facts (and, yes, I realize the irony there) rather than the dramatic ""truth.""

That said, Benedict Cumberbatch was incredible. He is really setting himself up as the go-to guy for any anti-social genius type of character. It would be unfortunate if he ends up being typecast as that guy and never gets any other kind of role, though, as good as he is at it. I think I may be becoming convinced he's more than just that.

It's actually very interesting what Cumberbatch did with the part. He started out with a kind of Sherlock level of human interaction and descended into a kind of Frankenstein's monster thing like he did in the National Theatre Live presentation of Frankenstein. It's too bad Alan Turing wasn't actually like that. Eccentric, yes, but he wasn't unfriendly and without the ability to operate in a social setting as the movie showed him to be.

Keira Knightley was also quite good. Well, she was mostly what you'd expect of Keira Knightley, but it was good. She was a good foil to Cumberbatch's portrayal of Turing, which is to say that her character was not quite accurate, either. Joan Clarke was probably quite a bit more socially awkward than she was in the movie but, then, in the movie, it's Joan who mediates between Turing and his team and enables him to work with them, so she had to be socially savvy for that work.

The other actors I really liked were Mark Strong and Matthew Goode. Strong played Stewart Menzies, a person that Turing probably never actually had any contact with, but he was a great movie character and added a bit of a spy edge to everything. Goode played Hugh Alexander, a chess champion who was on Turing's team. Even while I was watching the movie I didn't buy that Alexander was really as charismatic and charming as Goode played him to be, but he was fun to watch in the role.

Of course, the most interesting thing about the movie to me is not the movie at all; it's that the British government kept all of this secret, everything that Turing did during WWII, stuff which helped to end the war, for 50 years. 50 years! And, then, what they allowed to happen to him after the war was just... horrendous. And he was only posthumously pardoned in 2013. It's kind of unbelievable.

The main thing is, though, if you like those little electronic gadgets that you carry around everywhere and use all the time, you have Turing to thank for them. It was what he did during the war that lead to computers. Thinking machines were his thing. In fact, computers were originally called Turing machines.

Basically, I'd say to see the movie; it's worth it for Cumberbatch's performance alone, accurate or not. He might even deserve the best actor Oscar for it, though I haven't decided that for sure, yet. However, once you've seen it, check up on your Turing facts. It's all really quite fascinating.",1420329600,13,3216,4.592334494773519

Most of the time, they seem to exist only as a vehicle for an actor or studio that are usually solely focused on gaining awards or recognition. The movies themselves seem to always lack in quality and almost never hold up as the years go on.

Now, there have been a few films in recent years that have broken this pattern (things like The Wolf of Wall Street and Philomena) and The Imitation Game is one to add to that very short list. Its a movie with strengths that go way beyond the performances - though they are incredible - and resonates with the viewer in a deep way.

The film centers around Alan Turing, a mathematician who was hired by the British Government in World War Two to attempt to crack the unbreakable German communication system nicknamed Enigma. We see his time at a top secret code-breaking school in Bletchley Park along with a skilled team as he creates a machine that will break the complicated cypher (and revolutionize the world).

Benedict Cumberbatch - who most of you know from Star Trek Into Darkness and the television series Sherlock - heads the cast as Turing, bringing an emotional and layered performance to the table. Hes really what makes this movie thrive, but not without help from an excellent supporting cast and the attention to detail that director Morten Tyldum shows throughout.

Its an engrossing film that isn't hard to get behind, especially when you get to the heart of the main character, and deserves all the positive buzz surrounding it. Its a superb film all-around and contains one of the most memorable and interesting performances of the year.",1420329600,,1660,4.7735191637630665
6797660,5,B00PC1FD9U,"The geek in me loved this film. This is a biography of Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch), told with flashbacks. The film opens in 1951 where he has experienced a break-in. As the police investigate this man, we flashback to his work on cracking the Nazi code as well as his time as a student in 1928.

The film brings out the genius and unusual character of Alan as he leads a team to build a machine to crack the Enigma code. Alan must keep all kinds of secrets, both personal and at a government level. It is estimated this man who received no recognition during his lifetime saved 14 million lives and shortened the war by two years.

While I have heard the name Turing as the inventor of the modern computer during WWII, I had no notion about the man behind it.

6797661,4,B00PC1FD9U,"One of the most unexpected fantastic films I have ever had the pleasure of viewing in theaters! It may even go into my favorites of all time eventually.

Being an American born and raised I honestly have never heard of Alan Turing before until I ran across previews for this film. In high school, our WWII education was solely focused on the main points of that war - the Holocaust, Hitler, Normandy & D-day, what was happening in the country during the time and our 'war' with the Japanese. I never knew, or imagined, that a single man helped to win the war by creating a magnificent calculating machine/device with his mathematician and cryptanalyst abilities to beat Germany's Enigma.

Anyways, unto the film. Cumberbatch's performance is stellar - Oscar-worthy, if you think so as well. He handles the roll with such care, precision and potency that was glorious to watch. He makes you laugh and cry because his acting allows you to truly feel and care for the character he is portraying. Some cinematography moments are amazing! For example, there is a scene where Turing [Cumberbatch] is riding his bike through a bomb-damaged street to go somewhere where it was so well crafted and executed that I actually took a moment to appreciate it. It was lovely. The script was great, the various actors and actresses were impressive, the sets were awesome and at the end of it all I was highly moved. So much so that as the film was wrapping up and during the credits I was sobbing almost uncontrollably. My boyfriend, who went with me, actually commented himself and stated that ""Honestly, during [that part] I wanted to cry. I almost did, too.""

This film gives me so much more appreciation for it's main points and Alan Turing himself. It's fantastic. But, what is also amazing that it's a good popcorn film but doesn't need action or suspense because it's that good - while also being more intelligent that so many films before it. So, it's both - smart and entertaining at the same time. That's worthy of praise right there. This film is Day 1 Blu-ray pre-order and release for me. Go see this film. You just might do a disservice to yourself if you don't.",1420243200,4,2160,4.678947368421053
6797662,5,B00PC1FD9U,"Benedict Cumberbatch is one of those rare movie stars that can bring me into the theaters, and he brought me back twice for this one! It was so much fun to see him perform alongside other contemporary British superstars like Keira Knightley (""Pirates of the Caribbean""), and Sean Astin (Samwise Gamgee, ""Lord of the Rings""). There just doesn't seem to be a major literary or historical character that Cumberbatch can't knock out of the park. He's done Vincent Van Gogh, Sherlock Holmes, Julian Assange, Stephen Hawking, Hamlet, Smaug, Khan, etc. Who's next? His performance in this film is incredible, and the film overall has all the warmth and wit of a good ""Sherlock"" episode with charming new characters.

The film being based on historical events real human beings had to face, it also gives audiences some much needed food for thought about the fundamental nature of prejudice and inequality. One could even say that this movie is a social protest piece. In short, ""The Imitation Game"" is a must-see homage to the inventor of computers that Cumberbatch handles with skill, sensitivity and respect. You will be so profoundly grateful for Alan Turing's sacrifices by the end of the film. Without them, we wouldn't even be looking at this webpage.",1420243200,,1250,4.980861244019139

British mathematician Alan Turing helped win WWII by decoding the German Enigma machine and, in the process, appears to have single handedly invented the modern computer. The excellent screenplay emphasizes Turing's never ending struggle to win acceptance for his unorthodox theories. Presented to us in a career-defining portrayal by Benedict Cumberbatch (try saying that after a few drinks), Turing is the quintessential outsider whose personal genius is in direct conflict with his legion of idiosyncracies. What a tour-de-force acting job is this. I say this with affection: Cumberbatch is an odd-looking actor, a marvel to watch as he spins his web with an amazing characterization. He gets my Oscar vote. Keira Knightley is appealing as always -- what a delightful actress. I was also impressed by Mark Strong as a British spy, Charles Dance as the military panjandrum, and especially Alex Lawther who dazzles as a young Turing. The best part of this film was the insight into how people treat each other. The issue of Turing's homosexuality, so often presented as a circus, was treated here with intelligence and compassion.

6797666,3,B00PC1FD9U,"Every movie has a beginning, a middle, and an end.  I rather liked the middle of this film.

There is a plaque that was dedicated in early April 2003 in the Bletchley Park Museum in the UK:

""On this site during the 1939-45 World War, 12,000 men and women broke the German Lorenz and Enigma ciphers, as well as Japanese and Italian codes and ciphers. They used innovative mathematical analysis and were assisted by two computing machines developed here by teams led by Alan Turing: the electro-mechanical Bombe developed with Gordon Welchman, and the electronic Colossus designed by Tommy Flowers. These achievements greatly shortened the war, thereby saving countless lives.""

THE IMITATION GAME is a 2014 biopic about British mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst and pioneering computer scientist Alan Turing (1912-1954), who was a main figure in cracking Nazi Germany's Enigma code's daily-changing administrative key in the darkest hours of World War II. It stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing and is directed by Morten Tyldum with a screenplay by Graham Moore. It is based on the biography ALAN TURING: THE ENIGMA by Andrew Hodges.

To be truthful, I went to see the movie a few days after Christmas as the better-sounding of the ten movies nominated for Best Picture of 2014 by the Foreign Press. Besides I like Ben Cumberbatch.  I like his baritone voice, his piercing blue-green eyes and sharp cheekbones.  And I like his snappy good looks in clothes when he plays highly-intelligent and gifted characters. He's a darn fine actor, too.

In the historical part of this film, Cumberbatch is joined by an excellent and very competent cast.

Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke. Clarke was recruited by the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) to work at Bletchley Park in June 1940. She worked in the section known as Hut 8, and quickly became one of the practitioners of Banburismus, a cryptanalytic process developed by Alan Turing which reduced the need for bombes. Clarke became deputy head of Hut 8 in 1944.

Matthew Goode as Hugh Alexander. Irish-born British cryptanalyst and chess player, Alexander worked on the German Enigma machine at Bletchley Park alongside Turing and was later the head of the cryptanalysis division at GCHQ for over 20 years. In chess, he was twice British chess champion and earned the title of International Master.

Allen Leech as John Cairncross. A Trinity undergraduate, Cairncross was a British civil servant who became an intelligence officer and spy during World War II, He was a Soviet double agent and considered by many the Fifth Man of the CAMBRIDGE FIVE with Philby, Burgess, Blunt and Maclean. Moscow KGB believed Cairncross was one of the ablest foreign agents in KGB history.

Two favorite character actors portray British Intelligence leaders associated with the Enigma group. Mark Strong portrays Major General Sir Stewart Graham Menzies, who was Chief of MI6 (SIS), British Secret Intelligence Service, from 1939 to 1952 both during and after the Second World War.  Charles Dance is Commander Alastair Denniston, the first head of the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) that was relocated to Bletchley Park in 1939 after the outbreak of World War II. Denniston was appointed operational head of GC&CS in 1919 and remained so until February 1942.

Both Ben Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley are nominated for various and remarkable awards for their acting in this film.  Ben is nominated not for playing a closet homosexual, but for his brilliant turn as British mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst and pioneering computer scientist Alan Turing.

Why must movie-makers feel the need to exploit the personal life of heroes? The middle of the film THE IMITATION GAME, the gist of my review, is quite capable of maintaining the success of the film.",1420070400,8,3809,5.129240710823909
6797667,5,B00PC1FD9U,"I knew the broad stokes of this story but this film filled in a lot of the blanks.

Here's the scoop. The Nazis Have a great coding machine ""Enigma"" which the allies need to crack. British mathematician Alan Turing is brought in with a small team and figures he can beat Enigma by building a very fast difference engine. He labors against great adversity and serious personal baggage to get this done.

This is one of the better movies I've ever seen. It pulls the viewer into a world that, on the surface, might seem dry and boring, but it is anything but. The task, intertwining personalities and uphill fighting make for a very exciting story. Turing was a one of a kind person. Here he's written as an even more detached Sherlock Holmes (if you can imagine such a thing). And the story structure is somewhat odd as well. You're set up for the ultimate goal of breaking the code, but once that happens, other unforeseen complications arise. Along with that is the back and forth cutting from the wartime story to what happens to Turing shortly after the war has ended. This is shown as the truly tragic turn of events it was.

The period detail is great. Locations, sets, costuming, etc. are all spot on. The performances, even by secondary characters, are top shelf. Benedict Cumberbatch has already proven himself as an actor to watch and he doesn't disappoint here. There might be this point or that which someone might argue makes this less than a five star film, but they would be so small I would not let them detract from letting anyone know how great a film this is. Ans I assume the original story had to be altered to some degree to make it script worthy but, again, it's still a great flick.

6797668,5,B00PC1FD9U,"I saw The Imitation Game at the theater today. In general I am not drawn to art-house films - my idea of a good, ripping yarn is ""Guardians of the Galaxy"". However this film plays as an intense and captivating drama with brilliant, witty dialog and superb acting. I was completely drawn in and was stunned by just how good, how accessible, this film really is.

The story focuses on the genius and frailty of the man, Alan Turing. It depicts, in parallel, three key episodes in his life. Thankfully the film does not obsess over his homosexuality; if you consider the film a character portrayal then his homosexuality is just one facet of the man. In fact there is no physical representation of his homosexuality; it simply isn't needed.

Such is the excellence of Benedict's performance, enabled by a masterful script, I felt deeply invested in the character of Alan Turing. So much so I left the theater distressed over the shabby treatment afforded a man who saved millions of lives through his brilliance and determination.

All the support actors deliver sterling performances, especially Keira Knightley, Charles Dance and Mark Strong (though in truth the entire cast was first class).

If you are looking for the history of Ultra or the Enigma Machine you should look elsewhere. If you are expecting an action thriller then go watch U571 (which has absolutely zero basis in reality). The Imitation Game is really about two things; Alan Turing the man, and an oppressive society which demeaned and denigrated both women and homosexuals.

6797669,5,B00PC1FD9U,"Theatrical review.  In a film full of great performances, Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley turn in a pair that are worthy of Oscar consideration.  Adapted by Graham Moore from Andrew Hodges book, the story of Alan Turing finally comes to light some 70 years after his historic invention of what is now called a computer.

The film opens in 1941 as England and Germany have declared war against each other.  The Brits are getting their butts beat as the rest of Europe has already fallen to Hitler and the Nazis.  If England can somehow decode the infamous German Enigma machine, perhaps the war can be turned.  Turing (Cumberbatch), a brilliant mathematician, is assigned to help with the decoding process.  Socially inept, he has a hard time working with his small cadre of code breakers and they are having no success.  Knightly, brilliant in her own right, plays Joan Clarke, who helps Turing, outside the all-boys group.  While great friends and accomplished collaborators, they don't become romantic for reasons that become obvious during the film.  Turing's focus is on the building and development of the machine that will provide a mechanical process of encryption that is faster than any group of humans can process given the time constraints.  The Nazis change the encoding every day.

Backed by a cast that includes Matthew Goode, Rory Kinnear, Mark Strong, Charles Dance and others, the film moves quickly and is authentic in set design, down to the smallest detail.  A relatively unknown Norwegian director, Morten Tyldum (""Headhunters"") has managed to guide this excellent cast through a story that would seem tedious at best, yet does it with suspense and conviction.  As many films do these days, a backstory finds its way into the film in a series of flashbacks.  This includes Turing's days at school and close friendship with a boy named Christopher (Jack Bannon) who eventually becomes the name of the Turing computer.  A brilliant film that brings to light an unimaginable injustice to one of the great heroes of World War II.",1419724800,150,2055,5.0
6797670,5,B00PC1FD9U,"This is a modern-day tragedy in which we see a brilliant mathematician turned cryptanalyst pitted against ""Enigma,"" wartime Germany's secret code. To further complicate matters, he is a closeted homosexual. In the 40s when this PG-13 drama takes place, society was not as inclusive as it is today so the pressures on him were devastating.

Most of Graham Moore's PG-13 screenplay (based on Andrew Hodges' book) focuses on the beginnings of a task force that was assembled when Britain's Military Intelligence ascertained how impossible it would be to break the code. Ultimately, the deed was done by half-a-dozen crossword enthusiasts. I know it sounds facetious but this is a quote.

Here is some of the brilliant cast:
* Benedict Cumberbatch (""Sherlock"") is astonishing as Alan Turing, the adroit but socially awkward cryptanalyst (maybe a bit of Asperger's?) who creates this Rube Goldberg device authorized by Churchill himself ...to the dismay of the military officer who debunks it.
* Keira Knightley (""Laggies"") is Joan Clarke, a mathematician whose parents feel her job with an all-male crew would be indecorous. She, on the other hand, says a woman in a man's job doesn't have the luxury of being an ass, so she's always charming and kind. She counsels Turing to try making friends with his crew; watch his artless attempt to tell a joke.
* Mark Strong (""The Guard"") Stewart Menzies warns Turing and Clarke that if they divulge anything about their highly secret work, they will be executed for high treason.
* Matthew Goode (""A Single Man"") Hugh Alexander feels Turing needs some social pointers from an expert...and that would be him.
* Allen Leech (""Downton Abbey"") John Cairncross wants to trade secrets because he knows Turing is gay and Turing knows one of his secrets.

The most wrenching time comes after they break the code but can't use their newfound information for fear the Nazis will suspect them and change the code. The war continues with the War Offices of Britain and the United States using statistical analysis to ascertain who will live and who will die. They have to limit their counterattacks until they are ready for D-Day and ultimate victory.

Clarke comforts a despondent Turing near the end of the film, itemizing the amazing contributions he has made to the free world. It is a wonderful list. In the tragic postscripts during the final scroll, we are reminded that the Turing Machines that he created are now known as computers!

BTW, any movie that uses three of the best chameleons working in film today (Strong, Cumberbatch and Goode) will be impressive!",1419724800,6,2596,4.986143187066975

THE IMITATION GAME, of course, is all about the breaking of the ""unbreakable"" German Enigma code by British oddball genius mathematician Alan Turing and his team during WWII. Excellent acting by Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing, as well as virtually all of the support cast, but most particularly by Keira Knightley as his partner and would-be wife Joan Clarke. One of those films that seems a little simplistic at the beginning but snowballs left and right in some surprising directions toward the end. Wonderful script full of that deadpan British humor and understatement.

Full of fine little ironies regarding the nature of secrecy, tyranny, and many other things, the biggest drawback is that this film takes on a little more than can be adequately covered in two hours, focusing on Turing's critical work during the war, with back-story on his years in public school, and finally, the tragic circumstances he faced after the war. This often the case with historical dramas/biopics based on more detailed book versions (in this case,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alan-Turing-The-Enigma-The-Book-That-Inspired-the-Film-The-Imitation-Game/dp/069116472X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alan Turing: The Enigma: The Book That Inspired the Film ""The Imitation Game""</a>). Certain things -e.g., the impact that the breaking of Germany's code had on the outcome of the war--are cursorily told without really being shown in a way that allows the audience to fully appreciate them. As some of the other reviews here point out, THE IMITATION GAME takes some liberties and should not be taken as a strictly factual account (but that's hardly unusual, is it?) Particularly for American audiences, the heavy British accents may be hard to understand without subtitles in certain places. Finally, Turing just doesn't seem as fully characterized as he could be.

Regardless, THE IMITATION GAME includes a number of big events and themes--Britain's breaking and imitation of the code itself, the development of machines that we now know as computers, persecution of homosexuals in Britain throughout most of the last century--encompassing them all into a really engaging story. I saw this in a rather packed theater and think it worthy of note that most of the audience oohed and ahhed at certain key lines, and the film got a standing ovation at the end.",1419552000,6,2398,5.564383561643836
6797673,5,B00PC1FD9U,"""The Imitation Game,"" like ""The King's Speech"" (a film to which it bears more than a passing resemblance) opens with the same kind of shot: a close-up of the protagonist looking absolutely ashen-faced.  Here it's Benedict Cumberbatch, playing Alan Turing, who's about to be interrogated by a police inspector (Rory Kinnear) about the break-in to his home and his relationship with the man who robbed him.  Actually, the inspector is more interested in Turing's work during World War II at Bletchley Park, in which he was part of a team who cracked the Nazi's ""Engima"" code, thus saving countless lives.  The story moves from this period (post WW-II Great Britain) backwards to that period, and occasionally, even further back, to the young Turing's (here played by Alan Lawther) schooldays.  Each of the three periods offers clues to Turing's character and insights into the inner workings of this genius.  From the flashbacks to Turing's youth, for example, we can see the roots of his introversion, dislike of violence, and budding interest in cryptography.  As an adult working on the Enigma project, Turing's inability to understand jokes and sarcasm, his tendency to tell others when they're being dense, and his insistence that building an expensive machine is the only way to win the war, all go over well with his colleagues - but surprisingly enough, he turns out to be right.

The lead and the supporting cast are all superb, elevating a script which tends to treat its audience as if they are mildly mentally challenged and resulting in a moving film.  (Sample line: ""Alan Turing is hiding something!"")  However, Benedict Cumberbatch, playing yet another socially-awkward genius, does such an outstanding job, I could easily picture him accepting the Best Actor statuette.  Keira Knightley, as Joan Clarke, the only woman on the team, is equally good.  Matthew Goode, as Turin's rival, Hugh Alexander; Charles Dance, as the acerbic Commander Denniston, and Alan Lawther as the young Alan, are also excellent.  Like ""The King's Speech,"" ""The Imitation Game,"" is a movie about the friendship that develops between two outsiders and winds up bringing out the best in each of them.  And the end scene, between Cumberbatch, now depressed from his punishment of being convicted for ""gross indecency"" and Keira Knightley, in which she tells him that the world is an infinitely better place because he isn't ""normal""  has been described as bombastic, but it made me cry.  The movie can be described as Oscar-bait, but it's still a story with the power to move a lot of people.

As an after note: I must say I was shocked to discover later on that ""The Imitation Game"" took liberties with Alan Turing's story, surely the first Hollywood biopic in history to do so, but my outrage wasn't enough for me to deduct any points to this review.

6797675,4,B00PC1FD9U,"Film-fan me loved ""The Imitation Game."" The me who knows something about World War II felt that ""The Imitation Game"" was a bit of an unfortunate farce.

Aesthetically ""The Imitation Game"" is like a hundred other movies about British people dressed in attractive but muted woolens who march about speaking about God and country and occasionally dropping their civilized masks and giving play to their violence or their lust. We've seen all this before: the vintage clothing, the vintage cars, the vintage architecture, the golden lamplight on vintage interiors. We've seen it on Masterpiece Theater and Merchant Ivory and Jane Austen films and Downtown Abbey which I've never watched but which I feel as if I have watched.

""The Imitation Game"" is also like a lot of bio pics.

I really do wish ""The Imitation Game"" had some aesthetic surprises up its sleeve.

""The Imitation Game"" treats very complicated subject matter: the breaking of an unbreakable code. I wanted the movie to tell me something about this topic that I didn't already know. The film just puts an enigma machine on a table and has a bunch of smart characters stare at it and announce that it can produce one hundred fifty followed by eighteen zeroes variations. Okay, but how? Give me something technical. The movie never trusts its audience, or its own storytelling skills, enough even to scratch the surface of the nuts and bolts of code-breaking.

Benedict Cumberbatch gives a fine performance as the film's version of Alan Turing, the British mathematician who helped to decode Germany's Enigma during WW II. In the film, Turing displays symptoms of Asperger's. He doesn't get jokes and he has few friends. Everyone is mean to him. He lives an isolated life with only one significant human companion, his school chum Christopher. Turing is awkward and superior with his fellow codebreakers, and they hate him. He is light years more advanced than they. If only they could appreciate his brilliance! Turing is regarded with suspicion by his superiors. They almost arrest him. They break into and search his home. Again, this all feels hackneyed.

Enter Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley). Joan is a gifted code-breaker. Like Turing, she too faces difficulties because of others' ignorance and prejudice. People don't realize that a woman can be a worthy code-breaker and they keep her back and put her down.

Joan encourages Turing to overcome his Asperger's symptoms and to befriend his coworkers. He does so.

A casual comment by a secretary, that each German message ends with the words ""Heil Hitler,"" leads Turing to have the Aha moment that breaks Enigma. His jubilation is short-lived. He realizes that he can't rescue an English ship because if he does so, the Germans will realize that the English have broken their code. Turing devises a mathematical method to determine when to use information gathered from breaking the code, and when not to.

Two other timelines are intertwined with the WW II timeline. We are shown Turing's schooldays. He interacts with Christopher, his schoolboy crush and only friend. Christopher departs from his life and Turing is heartbroken. The headmaster of the school is cold in breaking this news to young Turing. Poor little Turing must bear this hard news all by himself.

In the other timeline, also interwoven randomly into the WW II timeline, Turing is interrogated in the early 1950s for ""gross indecency""  homosexuality. Turing undergoes chemical castration. This affects his ability to think. He can't even do a simple crossword puzzle in the newspaper. He is a broken man. The film insists that his death was a suicide. Some, including Turing's mother, are not so sure of that.

I was moved by the film. The scenes of little schoolboy Turing are very poignant; it's always hard to watch children suffer. Cumberbatch is a very competent actor and he plays intellectual intelligence well, which is a rare accomplishment. Not many actors could look as smart as Cumberbatch does. He is convincing as someone with Asperger's.

The me who knows and cares something about accuracy in a film ""based on a true story"" about WW II was very disappointed with this movie.

""The Imitation Game"" erases the significant contribution of Polish war heroes and Polish mathematicians to the breaking of Enigma. Like Turing, the Poles were also cruelly and ignominiously betrayed by the very Brits they helped: from Churchill consciously lying about who committed the Katyn massacre to Churchill handing the Poles to Stalin at Yalta to Brits like Stephen Fry insisting that Polish Catholics caused the Holocaust.

It was ideologically convenient for Brits to shaft the Poles, and the Brits did exactly that. ""The Imitation Game"" erases the Poles because the film wants Turing to be a lone genius and a lone, martyred homosexual. As it happens, during WW II, there were plenty of opportunities for heroism and martyrdom; Turing did not monopolize the supply.

The film is inaccurate in other significant ways. Turing was treated kindly by the headmaster around the Christopher incident, and Turing remained in contact with Christopher's family. Turing proposed to Joan Clarke because he liked her  he even told her he loved her  not to keep her in the code-breaking program. He tried to re-start their relationship years later. Turing could be funny and charming in real life. Etc.

The filmmakers wanted to create an image of Turing as an isolated genius, unappreciated by anyone, and persecuted because of his homosexuality. In fact Turing was part of a team of other geniuses, and he was open about being gay. I wish the film had been able to tell us more about how a relatively privileged man had been so ill-treated. His working class lover was not chemically castrated, for example. ""The Imitation Game,"" though, is not really interested in probing complex facts, or in saying anything new.",1419552000,19,5890,5.022564102564102

The ""hero"", Tom Jericho, was an Alan Turing-like math genius who both saved the world and won the girl. Unfortunately, the movie had a weak ending and turned Tom Jericho from a neurotic-math genius into some kind of war hero of the physical kind. I've always liked the movie, knowing it wasn't great, but the makers at least gave it a ""go"". It had great music and the production details were spot-on.  (I also like the actor Jeremy Northam, who plays a sleazy government agent.)

Now, almost 15 years later, we get a movie, ""The Imitation Game"", with a bit more of the real story. It is based on the book, published in the 1990's, ""Alan Turning"" by British mathematician, Andrew Hodges. (I also read and reviewed the book.) The ""hero"" this time is the real Alan Turing and he is depicted in ""The Imitation Game"" as a nerdy Cambridge math genius who is brought in to Bletchley to break the code. But Alan Turing, in addition to being a math genius, is also gay. No getting both the code AND the lady in this movie. At the time, being a homosexual was a crime in the UK.

I saw the movie this afternoon, on its first day of release, in a theater in ""fly-over"" country. Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles all opened the film a few weeks ago but we out in the boonies had to wait til today. The movie was well worth the wait. I had wondered how the director and the authors of the screen play were going to handle Turing's homosexuality. Well, it was handled brilliantly. The film, which is only about two hours long, captured both Turing's times and life in an understated manner. The movie opens with his post-war investigation and arrest and goes back and forth to his work in WW2 and his pre-war youth in a British boarding school, where he is treated cruelly by other students. His only friend - and defender - was a boy named Christopher, who died at a young age. Alan names his code-breaking machine ""Christopher"" in his friend's honor.

The movie ends, as does Alan Turing's life, with his suicide after being forced to take hormonal treatment to be rid of homosexual urges.  But most of the movie is devoted to Alan Turing and his fellow code breakers at Bletchely. The movie recounts how important breaking the Enigma code was and how difficult it was to do. The machine that Alan Turing developed was the forerunner of the computer I'm using to write this review.

Benedict Cumberbatch - is there a movie he HASN'T been in lately - as Alan Turing is brilliant. Kiera Knightly as Joan Clarke, a fellow-code breaker, is also good. (In both real life and the movie, the two were engaged to be married but the engagement was broken.) The supporting cast also does their acting duties and the production values are excellent...HOWEVER...

Rob Slaven, writing an excellent 4 star review of the movie on this site, raises some interesting points of movies getting historical facts correct vs the ""movie truth"". He refers to a Slate Magazine examination of the movie which points out the differences between the movie version and real events. This is a problem with watching an ""historical movie"". What's true and what's ""fudged"" or made more ""filmable""? I'll add: as film goers what should we take with literary license? Some of the characters in ""The Imitation Game"" were seen through the lens of ""literary license"". Relationships between characters were not always as they were depicted on screen.

So, I'm left in a quandary, as both a movie goer and a reviewer. I really enjoyed ""The Imitation Game"". Should the film have been labeled, ""Based on history"" as some films are? And would I have been happier watching a documentary about the life of Alan Turing, where all the facts presented must be correct? I simply don't know. But I sure did enjoy this movie.",1419465600,612,4042,4.611961057023644
6797677,4,B00PC1FD9U,"""The Imitation Game"" (2014 release; 112 min.) brings the story of Alan Turing. the British godfather of modern computing. As the movie opens, we find ourselves in ""Manchester, 1951"". Turing's apartment has been burglarized and when the police come to investigate, Alan does not cooperate and simply wants them to leave. (Much later, we learn why.) The movie then skips to ""London, 1939"", as then 27 yr. old Turing interviews to become part of the Navy's top secret program to try and break Germany's Enigma encryption machine. Turing almost blows the interview because of his arrogance, but as it turns out Britain needs him more than the other way around. Turing begins work on a machine to break the Enigma code. At this point we are maybe 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the first English language movie of Norwegian director Morten Tyldum, who a couple of years ago brought us the excellent cat-and-mouse action thriller ""Headhunters"". There are two important elements to Turing's story which are treated quite differently in ""The Imitation Game"": (1) because of the top secrecy of the codebreaker program, Turing never received any credit in his post-WWII life for solving the Enigma encryption machine, something that the movie emphasizes; (2) Turing's homosexuality caused him all kinds of problems, something that the movie basically ignores until deep into the movie. The performances are mostly top-notch, with of course Benedict Cumberbatch stealing the show as Alan Turing. Keira Knightley as Joan, Turing's supposed romantic interest, tries to make the most of what she is given, which isn't much. All that aside, the movie is undoubtedly entertaining from start to finish. In spirit, it's the type of British bio-pic just like """"The King's Speech""  few years ago: a feel-good historical drama. For a more objective look at Turing's life, I'd recommend you seek out a 2013 UK documentary called ""Codebreaker"", which was released earlier this year in the US (and available here on Amazon). Last but not least, ""The Imitation Game"" sports a delightful orchestral score, courtesy of veteran movie composer Alexandre Desplat.

""The Imitation Game"" opened on several screens last night (Christmas Eve) here in Cincinnati. The screening I saw this at was absolutely jam-packed, and the audience LOVED the movie (applauding when the end titles came on). While I am bothered by some of the historical inaccuracies, I can't deny that I enjoyed the movie more than I expected, and hence if you have a chance to check this out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, I suggest you do so and draw your own conclusion.",1419465600,2,2792,5.025917926565874
