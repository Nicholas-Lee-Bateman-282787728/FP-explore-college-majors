4445268,5,B004QDXCPM,"Riveting.  It's amazing that something we in the Bay Area take for granted was endangered just 50 years ago.  Did you know that the hills of the Bay Area used to be green year 'round? Did you know that as late as the 1960s the Bay was used as the area's raw sewer and garbage dump?  Did you know that the Bay - as we know it today - can be credited to the grass roots efforts of three East Bay housewives?  I didn't think so!

Buy it and watch it.  It's truly fascinating.",1379894400,,472,3.9680851063829787
4445269,5,B004QDXCPM,I have just ordered the four DVD's having partially watched the PBS programme. Cant wait to watch the whole thing and share it with friends who live on the bay and have no idea that it was nearly filled in almost completely. Three women saved it and they should get far more accolade and be revered for what they managed to do. Only a small portion of people who live here know the whole story. Hoping to change that! Extraordinary piece of history and these DVD's have been so well produced and to top it all Robert Redford tells the story!,1376352000,2,541,4.366336633663367
4445270,5,B004QDXCPM,I liked all the research that went into explaining how the SF Bay Area became what it is today.  Incredible!  If you live here and love SF Bay Area -- then it's required viewing (IMHO),1376092800,2,184,4.228571428571429
4445271,5,B004QDXCPM,"Totally captivated by the information and footage. As a kid, I did a 4-H demonstration about saving the bay and why.  It was 1976 or 75. I know some of my classmates at school could care less but it was a big deal for me and my 4-H project friends. So glad to see this production for all to see.",1371772800,2,295,3.9166666666666665

4445273,5,B004QDXCPM,very good content and is something that should be watched by everyone living in S.F. Bay area especially kids of all ages.,1366243200,,122,4.590909090909091
4445274,5,B004QDXCPM,"I first watched Saving The Bay on PBS.  I was born in San Francisco and love the area.  This DVD shows the history of the bay as well as the surrounding lands, the land before the white man.  It tells of the discovery of the Bay, the arrival of the Spanish, the destruction of native habitats, the Gold Rush and it's far-reaching effects on the Bay to this day.  Also, the development of the lands and the near-disastrous land-fill and waste pumping that took place over 100 years.  I think my favorite theme of this DVD is the beauty of the Bay Area and what two women and idea can accomplish.",1353801600,5,594,4.315315315315315
4445275,5,B004QDXCPM,"I ordered this video sight unseen just from a blurb I saw on PBS. I had missed the airing of the show. I needed information on the Bay for a specific purpose. This far exceeded my expectations.

First of all, it is beautifully produced:  the cinematography, music, narration (by Robert Redford), and experts and locals included in the production.

Secondly, it is a wonderful historical reference on the Bay and the entire San Francisco area. So, if you are looking for history, this is it. It also discusses how the Bay was retrieved from becoming a dumping ground to the beautiful area it is today.

The program also includes geographic, geologic, ecologic, oceanographic and socioeconomic information on the area. Whew! It's a treasure trove of great info.

It is a four part (about 1 hour each) documentary. I enjoyed every bit of it. It is very appropriate as educational material for your kids, too. I have now watched this three times in its entirety, and I'm not done watching it!

Great documentary and very well done.",1320883200,19,1027,4.806818181818182
4445276,5,B004QDXCPM,Excellent history of San Francisco Bay from millions of years ago to the present. Amazing story of three women who stopped the bay from being permanently destroyed.,1319932800,3,164,5.111111111111111

8438075,5,B004QDXCPM,Great video and a great story to see.  It is a great historical perspective on how San Francisco and the surrounding area was built.  Pretty disturbing how we destroyed so much of the bay filling it in and even more why we would allow formal and informal garbage dumps to be built on the bay.,1417478400,,292,4.290909090909091
8438076,5,B004QDXCPM,At first I thought this was an outstanding documentary because I was born and raised in the Bay Area. It quickly becomes apparent that the story is universal and just how precious our physical environment needs to be protected.,1412726400,,227,4.846153846153846
8438077,5,B004QDXCPM,Great!,1412208000,,6,6.0
8438078,5,B004QDXCPM,"Just a phenomenal series. The musical score alone is worth the price of admission, and the story is nearly unbelievable, in terms of the corruption and disregard for the environment. The positive outcome is thus nearly unbelievable as well.",1406678400,,240,5.17948717948718

This incredible documentary answered them all, and then some. I highly recommend this to anyone interested to know more about where we live and work.",1403740800,,326,4.7368421052631575
