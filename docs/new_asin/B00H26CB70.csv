8629171,5,B00H26CB70,My wife is using this DVD and she has always liked Elyse as she calls her. A good solid reminder of who we are in Christ.,1411776000,,121,3.6923076923076925
8629172,5,B00H26CB70,"Found In Him is full of incredibly vivid pictures of the depths of the love of Jesus.  Elyse Fitzpatrick brings to light the significance of the incarnation, life, death, and resurrection of Jesus...not the historical significance, but the personal significance these events have in my life every day.  I LOVE the DVD format.  While I share the author/speakers passion for these Biblical truths, I am not good at articulating them to my Bible study group.  So I facilitate, and a God-gifted teacher does the speaking.  The hearts and minds of the 20 some ladies who attend the study are changing!  We are growing in knowledge and resting in the good news of God's love!",1398038400,,669,4.824561403508772
