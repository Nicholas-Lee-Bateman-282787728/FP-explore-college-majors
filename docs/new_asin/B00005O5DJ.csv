I don't care if it ain't widescreen, on most dvd's you can change the screen size anyway. Instead of it being one of those movies like Die-Hard which only the boys will watch, Titanic-only the girls, The Exorcist-only the adults, etc, everyone in the family will want to see this, time & time again. The laughs r funny 1st time, and again the 2nd, as the old sayin goes - ""I'm on to you kitty and your in big trouble!"" ""I think not baby puppy, it is you who is in trouble!"" A must watch.",1000771200,,628,3.992063492063492
1638854,3,B00005O5DJ,"I went to see the movie Cats and Dogs, when it first came to theaters. It was pretty good, but had a very predictable plot. All in all though, I'd say mabey rent it and see it once, but don't buy it.",1000512000,,199,3.761904761904762
1638855,4,B00005O5DJ,This movie was one of the best movies out this year i thought. I found it very enjoyable and it's for people of all ages. Although the DVD is not widescreen which i am not happy about i'm still gonna buy this because i think it's worth buying because this movie jumps through the right hoops from start to finish. If u didn't catch this at the theater then watch it on video or DVD.,999907200,,382,4.1066666666666665
1638856,5,B00005O5DJ,"Ok, so maybe this film doesn't have an Anamorphic transfer, which will still probably stop me buying the film. But that is no reason for a good fun movie to be given a one star review. This film is enjoyable, easy for adults and kids allike to watch and something that should be made more ofen.

1638857,1,B00005O5DJ,"Like they did with ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,"" Warner Bros. is foolishly releasing this DVD in a fullscreen/pan-and-scan format, not in widescreen.  According to a survey conducted by Warner Bros., 80% of DVD consumers don't like widescreen.  I won't argue the validity of their survey (except to say that it's wrong), but even if the survey is right (which it isn't), that still leaves 20% who prefer widescreen.  I would think that 20% is a big chunk.  Warner Bros., I hope you get your act together soon.",997920000,,520,4.808988764044944

1638937,1,B00005O5DJ,"Some people will undoubtedly claim that my review of this movie isn't valid because I'm not the intended audience for it -- namely, it's a kid's movie and as an adult I shouldn't expect too much out of it.  I respectfully disagree.  I LOVE children's movies, and often find them much more enjoyable than movies aimed at my intended demographic.  And I believe it's entirely possible to make a children's movie that adults will enjoy as well as kids, and be able to entertain kids without insulting their intelligence.  Kids are smarter than we give them credit for, and I think even they can tell when a movie is genuinely good and when a film is obviously lowering its own standards to pander to them.

""Cats and Dogs"" is just such a pandering film -- there's a genuinely enjoyable premise behind it, but it falls back on tired cliches and stereotypes, unfunny physical humor, and flat characters.

In the world of ""Cats and Dogs,"" humanity's favorite pets have long been at odds with one another -- apparently cats are determined to take over the world and enslave humanity, while dogs are the valiant ""Man's Best Friend"" who secretly fight the feline menace with high-tech technology and keep humankind safe.  Their efforts center on eccentric scientist Dr. Brody (played by Jeff Goldblum), who is developing a vaccine that could cure dog allergies, and they try to place a dog agent in his home... but a mix-up lands a naive and clueless beagle puppy named Lou (voiced by Tobey Maguire) in the home instead.  With the aid of cynical agent Butch (voiced by Alec Baldwin), Lou has to defend his newfound family from a villainous Persian named Mr. Tinkles (voiced by Sean Hayes) and his feline army of agents, assassins, and spies... but ultimately he has to decide which is more important -- protecting his family, or saving humankind at large.

Despite being live-action, this film looks almost embarrassingly cartoony.  If a film features live-action talking animals, I feel the CGI should be incorporated well enough to not be distracting... and in a GOOD film of this type, this usually means not tinkering with the animals' faces more than necessary.  In ""Cats and Dogs,"" the animals' faces are often morphed into disturbingly human-looking expressions, which is not only distracting but looks very fake.  It's rather telling when movies that predate ""Cats and Dogs"" (""Dr. Doolittle"" by three years, ""Babe"" by six) have more convincing CGI effects than this movie.

The CGI doesn't just extend to the animals' faces, either -- the animals here do completely unrealistic things, and it's blindingly obvious when the real animal disappears and is replaced with a CGI double.  Much of the charm of animal movies is seeing them perform intelligent feats with their own skills and abilities, and when the movie morphs and twists them into doing impossible stunts, it loses that charm.  And really, why force cats to perform human-like martial arts when they're natural hunters and masters of stealth anyhow?  And watching dogs attempt similar moves is just embarrassing to watch.  I can't help but wonder why they didn't just make this an animated film if they were going to turn the animals into CGI-distorted cartoon caricatures anyhow.

All this would merely be an annoyance if the film was good on its own merits... but there's absolutely no charm to this film.  The humans are pretty much lifeless caricatures, and the animal characters aren't much better.  Everyone is a cardboard cutout, from the gruff and humor-less mentor character to the stereotypical villain (who is at least somewhat redeemable by his voice actor knowing exactly what kind of movie he's in and chewing the scenery like it's candy) to even the naive but plucky hero himself.  The humor, mostly slapstick and toilet humor, falls flat at every turn, and even when something clever does pop up (such as silencing a noisy dog meeting by activating a can opener), it's quickly smothered in more stupidity.  And the film's attempts at being heartwarming and emotional feel wedged in and weak, as if the filmmakers realized that they forgot to add a ""message"" and tagged it on at the last minute.

Other reviewers have complained that this film does cat-lovers a disservice by making all cats evil.  I like both dogs and cats, and while I'm not basing my dislike of the film solely on how it treats cats, I do have to admit that I find it annoying that once again, the cats are always the bad guys while the dogs are, without exception, good.  Why not mix it up?  Why not have a double-agent dog or a turncoat cat, or some less-than-savory canines and some good-hearted felines... or heck, at least some cats who are neutral to the whole deal and don't care about ruling the world with an iron paw?  I would have found the story much more interesting had it not been so divisive, but as it is, it's just tiresome.  (The sequel appears to try to address this, but I'm not going to watch it just to find out...)

I normally like a lot of kids' films, but this one looks cheap, insults my intelligence, and feels like it's pandering to kids with its simplistic plot and goofy special effects.  If you want an animal film for your kids, try ""Babe"" or ""Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey"" instead.  This one's a waste of time, both for you and for your children.",1471305600,,5335,4.785169029443838

1638943,1,B00005O5DJ,"I purchased this movie and previously purchased a Vizio television with an AMAZON VIDEO App that includes an ""Amazon"" BUTTON on the remote control - PURCHASED not rented - in reliance on the availability of this AND MANY OTHER MOVIES for viewing by my PERMANENTLY DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED 26 YEAR OLD daughter on the AMAZON Video App on the remote because she is not, as a consequence of her disability, able to maneuver screens and log-ins on a television.  In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!!

1639097,5,B00005O5DJ,Fun movie for downtime.  Cats are self-serving and dogs are heroic; these two stereotypes play well into this film.  Cats are trying to take over the world and dogs are trying to save the world from being taken over by cats.  It's full of fun bits and laughs at ourselves through our dogs.,1424304000,,289,4.415094339622642

1639110,3,B00005O5DJ,"My wife, let's call her ""G"", said it was very brave of me to watch this because I've got a fear of kittens (and snails, but no snails in this movie thank goodness).  It's a really kind of fun movie about dogs and cats at war with one another the way I'm always at war with other teams that think they can play with us.  It is kinda confusing though because I'm not sure how much is true and what's just Hollywood lingo like ""inspired by true events"".  Anyway, I had to turn all the lights on in our LA mansion - even the lights in the guest house, and pool house, and guard house, and gate house, and that just like second main house we for some reason have oh and the tennis courts and gym and indoor and outdoor basketball courts and obviously all the lights underwater in the pools and jacuzzis and the ones that line the waterfall.  Why?  Because i was so freaked out by the cats in this movie!  I've never wanted dogs to win more.  It was like looking in a mirror when the dogs were winning - surprising and satisfying every time. Anyway, I won't say what happened in the movie NO SPOILERS but I will tell you my wife G was right it's a good movie and I am brave but if I ever see a kitten on the football field I'm running the other way they're scary and they also got lasers and stuff now",1422835200,,1295,4.074803149606299

I will admit that the interactions between Tinkles, the main antagonist of the film, voiced by Sean Hayes, and his right-hand cat, Calico, voiced by Jon Lovitz, were funny...the driving/ransom video scene were especially funny.  But the laughs were few and far between.  I'm sure younger kids will get more out of this and good for them.  But even with Alec Baldwin and Toby McGuire as the leads, it's just not my thing.

1639550,5,B00005O5DJ,I enjoyed this story because it made me laugh and entertaining.  It also makes you think of the issues that are so rediculous and the animals story line was relative to humans as well.,1365811200,,184,4.411764705882353

The movie is well done for all ages and succeeded in making you laugh at the attempt of the cats to take over all the world's owners from dogs.

There were only a couple of scenes that I didn't really find humorous.  Those were mainly the ones involving Mr. Tinkles (the white cat in charge of the ""takeover"") and his owner. I don't want to spoil it for those of you who haven't seen the movie. I just think they could have found a different, more humorous way of presenting Mr. Tinkles' owner and getting the cats to the owners company.  That's just my own thoughts on it, something a little more tasteful for all ages.

I have to say all of us thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It was nice to be able to see a movie that all ages are able to see together.",1365120000,,920,4.2701149425287355

1639730,3,B00005O5DJ,"Cats & Dogs is basically taking the cuteness factor of kittens and puppies and tries making a storyline out of them fighting at war among another... in hyper mode.

There's seriously something extremely creepy about this particular animal flick that makes it more like a horror film than any kind of adorable animal-loving family movie.

I believe I know what it is.

It's the way the animals go from acting completely normal and playful one moment to suddenly (out of nowhere) switching up in a way to try and make the speaking voices fit their moving mouths, making it appear like the dogs and cats are actually talking.  Yes that's right, it's one of THOSE type of animal films.  The kind where the animals move their mouths and actually talk.  It's done a little odder than usual this time around however.

Even their eyes look extremely weird the moment a change up occurs- the animals look drugged out of their minds.  It's honestly quite frightening but I suppose the movie producers were going for as much realism as possible concerning a talking animal...

Then take into consideration many times you will witness the animals suddenly speed up and act really goofy and uncharacteristic, and folks, we have a horror film belonging in the same category as that old 80's classic, Devil Dog.

Take the bloodhound for instance.  He suddenly speeds up and totally screws with my head upon doing so.  Strange.

The beagle puppies are of course adorable, and the kittens are as well but neither of these things are enough to win me over.  The pacing is WAY too fast and unusual for me.",1299542400,,1586,4.72

1639778,3,B00005O5DJ,"The premise of the movie is clever. Dogs and cats can talk, think, build machines, and are in general as clever or more clever than we humans, but they just keep it all hidden. And they are in perpetual conflict against each other.

The plot is that a human (Jeff Goldblum) is on the verge of discovering a cure for dog allergies, and the cats want to reverse it an make all humans allergic to dogs. It's rather silly, and just furnishes a backdrop against which to show doghouses with sophisticated electronics, ninja cats, and other aspects of the cat vs. dog conflict.

Tobey McGuire (Spiderman) voices the protagonist dog, a puppy accidentally inserted into the conflict. Alex Baldwin, Joe Pantoliano, and Susan Sarandon do some of the other dogs. One of the great voices of our age, Charleton Heston is the leader of the dogs, but his part is brief. Sean Hayes gives a nice, over-the-top, supervillianesque performance as the cat antagonist, and Jon Lovitz does a good turn as his assistant. In general the animal voices are the highlight of the movie, along with the continually funny joke of the dogs possessing technology and intelligence about which we humans have no clue.

Elizabeth Perkins and Jeff Goldblum lead the cast of humans. Perkins is passable, but this is not one of Goldblum's better efforts. It's really the animal's show. I found the parts with the humans to be pretty boring.

The movie contains some good moments with the animals, though, such as the the Russian Blue cat operative breaking into the human's house. It balances out as something worth a watch for a Saturday afternoon popcorn movie, but probably not something you're going to drag out and watch every year or three.",1238803200,26,1707,4.795918367346939

1639799,3,B00005O5DJ,"Or maybe they just didn't care.  But there's much sloppiness in this film about cats.

1. One of the cats is described as a Russian Blue.  However, Russian Blues have green eyes -- and ONLY green eyes.  The ""Russian Blue"" in the film has copper-bronze eyes, more like a Chartreux (a blue French cat).

Those ignorant about cats commonly mistake all blue (i.e., gray) cats for Russian Blues, since they're the most famous of the blue cats.  But the Chartreux and Korat also come in blue, as does the British Blue.

Still, so much effort went into this film in other areas, I'm surprised the filmmakers got the Russian Blue wrong.

2. Furthermore, the film's ""Russian Blue"" appears to have faint tabby markings, and true Russian Blues have solid coats.  (As do Chatreaux and Korats.)

3. Elizabeth Perkins variously refers to the Russian Blue as ""he"" and ""her.""  Sloppy, sloppy.

4. Elsewhere in the film, a dog spots Calico (a cat) approaching, and refers to Calico as ""he.""  He is a he, however male calicos are very rare, most are female, but okay.  However, Calico is NOT even a calico, as he clearly has tabby markings.  So why is he named Calico?

As with Perkin's variously refering to the Russian Blue ""he"" and ""her,"" it's as though the filmmakers just don't think much thought need be given to the cats.  The dogs are the stars.

Other than that, like most Hollywood ""high concept"" films, the idea is clever, the technical execution skilled, but the story peters out well before the end of the film.  It's an okay film, but it gets boring, even overlooking its ignorance -- or lazy sloppiness -- about cats.",1132704000,5,1614,4.639575971731449

I think two of the funniest lines were "" You fight like a Poodle"" and "" Don't wet the papers yet"" It is predictable and formulamatic, but who cares?

Dogs,"" but I think the average moviewatcher in the producers' target audience would not have understood the meaning of ""versus.""  Cats and Dogs is about the secret plans of cats to subjugate humans into their slaves, as they used to be in ancient Egypt.  (Hence the explanation for Egyptians worshipping cats).  The leader of this plan is the white Persian cat, Mr. Tinkles.  Mr. Tinkles lives in a mansion with his comatose, elderly owner, and a portly maid who is obsessed with dressing the poor kitty in humiliating outfits.  Sheesh, no wonder cats want to rule humans!

On the side of protecting humans are the dogs.  Inquisitive beagle puppy Lou (voiced by Tobey Maguire) stumbles into the secret headquarters of the dogs.  Lou becomes an agent.  His reluctant mentor is Butch (voiced by Alec Baldwin).  Lou falls in love with the family he is placed with, despite orders to not get attached and focus on the mission.

One of the funniest scenes is when Mr. Tinkles and his henchmen are trying to drive a limo with his comatose owner in the driver's seat.  The ninja cats beating up Lou are pretty great, too.  The drawings of his plan are also hysterical - especially the dirigible.  Otherwise, the film was a little disappointing because of the treatment of dogs as perfect creatures.",1110326400,2,1347,4.75

Of course, that purring and those puppy eyes are all just an act, to hide from us humans the fact that there is a war going on between cats and dogs. The cats want to take over the world, once again forcing humans to submit to their will, while dogs are determined to protect humanity from the evil cats.

That, in a nutshell, is the plot of ""Cats & Dogs,"" a sometimes funny, but flawed, look at a battle going on right underneath our clueless noses.

Overall, this movie is quite funny and enjoyable to watch. There are several truly hilarious moments (the entire ninja cats sequence is the best) and the voice-overs are great. But the special effects, especially in the beginning of the movie, leave a lot to be desired. There are several spots throughout the movie when you are jarred out of the fantasy of the movie because what you are seeing looks so fake.

The DVD version does come with some interesting extras, some of which are different depending on whether you select the dog or cat choice in the beginning.

Only once previoously has my cat, Star, aged eleven years, looked at anything on t.v.  One Sunday she watched all of Sagwa the Chinese Siamese animated show.  But she liked this motley crew of talking dogs as they plodded against felines of her kind.
When the hound went around in circles attempting to catch his own tail, I laughed so much she left her favorite chair to console me.  After that, I had to temper my enjoyment of this assorted group who learned of the ancient Egyptian fascination with cats from a book.
The cats had no faces, only pug noses and lots of fur -- maybe that is Persian.  They were the strangest looking cats I ever saw, must be Japanese.  Star has a very pretty face and is short-haired.  Some weird alien cats arrived (and left) in kamisake planes to attack the hound dog.  These weird fat cats resided with a comatose factory owner.  Watching them drive his black limo and propel him around wired with several IVs as they gave orders for the workers to abandon the Mason factory, it was quite something.
The stray, a greyhound, was evocative to the puzzled hound.  These dogs had decided they were Russian spies.  A conference of dogs takes place  similar to a Russian agency something like our United Nations.  On Canine News Network, we heard Wolf Blitzer heralding a Revolution against the human race.
The cats took over the Mason factory and captured the hound's human family as hostages to secure a potion to make humans allergic to dogs.  The leader uses a World Domination booklet to indoctrinate the mice on how to infiltrate the sewers to infect human existence.
The dogs save the day and the scientist's family in the midst of a fire.  As the cats maneuver heavy equipment in the factory, the hound jumps through the air like Mighty Mouse to ""here to save the day.""  He exits the inferno in falling snow to discover his valuable place in the family.

The dogs have to rescue the world from a plan by the cats for a world revolution, where they will overtake the earth, and install a cat tyranny, like they once had in Ancient Egypt.
I particularly found the scene of the kung fu cat throwing knives and, his face set in a evil leer, very amusing. Other highlights for me, where the Doggy United Nations scene - at the center of the earth. Hey its go to have more sense and concern for rights and justice, than the miserable `peoples' UN, we have adding to misery and tyranny in the world today. But I digress; in this one some of the doggy delegates got the chairman quite irate by playing frisby in the assembly. And who can address the Cat Rally where a demagogic Mr. Tinkles to the background of sinister Red Bolshevik-like posters addresses the cats, raving about the `glorious revolution' that he will bring about, with the aid of the most unlikely ally-gasp, mice! Who will be rewarded with the continent of Australia.
Then of course there was the German nurse Sophie, the bane of the life of the villainous Mr. Tinkles - she dresses him in all sorts of frilly clothes etc.  After the defeat of the cats, Mr. Tinkles is returned to the care of Sophie, who has invited her three equally fat sisters, to the mansion where he lives, who have all sorts of jerseys and frilly outfits for him ` before the photo session.
Kind of like the humiliation of another tyrant Saddam Hussein, having his teeth checked on world TV LOL.
Alexander Pollock is the boy Scott Brody, the owner of Lou, the little Beagle, Jeff Goldblum as Professor Brody, who is working on a special formula that the cats want to get their evil hands on, and is was great to see Elizabeth Perkins (she played the leading lady in Big) who is quite cute in her role as Mrs. Brody.

But , the great thing about the movie is the respect the dogs get , I love dogs , I have a Siberian Huskey , and Golden Retriever. So I think they are the best. Lou was a cute , playful little guy , played by a cool actor ``Tobey Mcguire'' (Spider-Man ,The Cider House Rules , and the 2003 summer movie ``Sea Biscuit'' which I want to see.) And the Butch was cool (Alec Baldwin , ``Pearl Harbor'')
as was Susan Surandon's part  , as the female Hound. The Cats were incredibly stupid , but then again , I am not big on cats so that would make sense. This movie had one scene in particular , that I liked , when the kid told Lou , he was his best friend , I love that , people who have a close bond with thier pets , especially dogs , is a great sight. But i'm not dissing cat people , but lets face it , cats don't exactly show 2/3 a fraction of love as dogs do.

As I was saying, the plot was weak, and the animation looked like something from the Muppets. Great for puppets, but NOT for talking animals. And I hated the scene with the dog catapulting the cat... And what's with this cheesy family stuff? And another thing... Egyptains worshipped cats because they CHOSE to, not because cats MADE them. They believed that cats had special powers and knew all of history that lay before them. And that's why. Also, the ""Russian"" kitten was adorable, but as soon as I saw what he really was I unearthed another reason to hate the film-- it made a mockery of my beloved cat Snickers. Snickers was a Russian Bleu and the gentlest, most trustworthy cat I knew. She was always by my side, warned us when something was wrong, and made a wonderful sleeping companion. THIS is not what they show us about the cats in this movie. To make it simple, they show all the PROS in dogs, and they show all the CONS in cats. This is wrong. They did that a million times!

When I first viewed the trailer and the behind the scenes footage for this movie, I was very excited to view it. This film is good, clean, and downright fun to watch. The tedious time spent on the special effects for the dogs and cats to do stunts and talking is absolutely amazing. Don't let the PG rating fool you adults! I appreciate the film maker's strive to bring this film to not only children, but to its teen and adult audience. Animal aficionados will adore this action-packed, emotional, and comedic film about the war between cats and dogs.
Plot
The dog species actually has an intelligent agency behind it with trained agents protecting man kind 24/7 against the evil plots of cats. When the Brody family dog is catnapped the Dog HQ Agency calls in an elite team of puppies to have one picked to replace the family dog. The Brody family father (Jeff Goldblum) is developing a formula to stop the allergy some humans have with dogs. By accident a beagle is the replacement and must help protect the family with the assistance of the other dogs. From there cats try to kill the beagle (Lou), but fail as Lou learns quickly the prerequisites of a dog agent. The whole family will enjoy this exciting, positive, comedic film from start to end!
Pros:
1. Meticulous special effects used to create the communication and fights between the cats and dogs.
2. Excellent plot
3. Great voices of the felines and canines by brilliant actors. (i.e. John Lovitz, Charlton Heston, Susan Sarandon, Tobey Maguire, and Sean Hayes)
4. Incorporated use of highly advanced technological equipment is very entertaining to watch.

Tobey Maguire is the voice of Lou, the cute beagle pup entrusted with guarding the potion from the feisty felines. Crazy fun and mayhem ensues and will no doubt keep kids of all ages entertained.

I enjoy most family films, but this one is just downright poor.  The screenwriters, director, actors, producer, and even the best boys and grips affiliated with this movie apparently thought that children equates to ""simple-minded.""  I cannot stand that attitude; most children today can understand and enjoy a story many orders of magnitude more complex and well-done than is presented here (you could drive a few trucks plus a cruise liner or two through the holes in this film).  The creators of this movie simply use children as a cop out to create a horrid flick, and it comes off as an insult to the average child's intelligence and imagination.
Many movies of my childhood are still as entertaining today as they were then, and there are countless modern children's films that I can watch with kids without a problem.  This film just is not one of them.",1020902400,6,1144,4.752525252525253
1639860,1,B00005O5DJ,"""Cats and Dogs"" was a promising looking movie:  it had talking cats and dogs (sounds like fun!).  Not only did the film have talking cats and dogs, but most of the cats and dogs were secret agents and had lots of cool ""Mission Impossible"" like gizmos (sounds like even more fun!).
  So let's recap, we've got talking cats and dogs and cool gizmos...seems like a good combination right?  But we forgot one important ingredient: an interesting plot!
  As anyone can tell from the trailers, this movie is about cats and dogs (who talk don't forget) waging war on each other.  Sure it's a funny concept, and the first 5 minutes of the film worked well using a sort of Tom and Jerry approach to the idea....but the remaining 90 minutes, the remaining 90 minutes was the problem.
  The meager plot (which took up the last 90 minutes of the movie) was about a young pup named, Lou who gets mistaken for a secret agent.  Lou must guard a secret formula that would make humans not allergic to dogs.  The cats want the formula destroyed for obvious reasons but somehow that gets mixed in with some weird plot for cats to take over the world.  That's it.  Nothing else happens and except for all the gags you saw in the trailer....nothing else in the movie is very funny.  That is, unless you thinka cat saying ""Cats rule!"" every 5 minutes is funny.  Ha....ha.  No.
Recommendation:  Don't buy movie.  It was boring.  Don't even rent this movie.  It was boring.  If for some reason your kids force you to watch it on HBO...skip the popcorn and opt for some Vivarin, you and your kids will surely need it.",1020124800,5,1592,4.493006993006993

1639873,3,B00005O5DJ,"Cats and Dogs is a family movie that uses live action, animation and computer generated effects. It tells the story of an ongoing war between cats and dogs that occurs behind our backs. How much you will enjoy it depends on a couple of things. The closer you are to the age of twelve, the more fun it will be. Where you stand on whether canines or felines make the best pets is the other factor. Not only does the movie portray dogs as definitely our best friends, it claims that only they stand in the way of cats' ultimate goal of world domination. This is all shown in a comic and entertaining fashion, and it works for me. I've never met a cat I could trust.
Professor Brody [Jeff Goldblum] lives with his wife [Elizabeth Perkins] and son, Scott [Alexander Pollock], in one of those picture perfect, white picket fence neighborhoods you used to see only in Steven Spielburg movies, but can now find anywhere in the country. To we humans, the professor is as unthreatening as they come. To cats, he is the greatest threat on the planet because he is working on a formula which will cure us of all allergies caused by dogs. They decide to destroy his work and substitute their own product, which will make everyone highly allergic to dogs. The kitties start off by catnapping the Brody's dog, who is really a canine secret agent put there to protect them. The dogs respond by sending in another agent, but a mistake is made. An untrained puppy named Lou [Tobey Maguire] gets the job. A big dog called Butch [Alec Baldwin] does his best to aid and train Lou. Meanwhile, the evil [and hilarious] Persian cat, Mr. Tinkles {Sean Hayes], will lead his feline army to victory, if only he can stay clear of his master's housekeeper, who delights in dressing him up in the dreadful outfits she makes. It's just so humiliating!
When live action is mixed with animation, the live characters usually lose out. Cats and Dogs is no exception. The few scenes of the Brody family's interacting with each other drag. Jeff Goldblum, once a promising actor, has in the last decade made considerable income playing in movies where he is essentially an expensive prop.
I have noted that dogs are the heroes here, but cats are a lot more fun. The dogs get all the warm, cuddly responses. The cats get all the laughs, especially the abominable Mr. Tinkles and some ninja cats who nearly steal the show.

The heroic dogs of course were lovable, particularly Lou, Butch and Ivy.  The opening sequence had my wife almost choking on laughter.  The catapult (play on words here) in the beginning is truly funny.
The effects overall are astounding in that there are times when Butch really looks like Alec Baldwin, who provides the voice.  One can almost see Toby Maguire too in Lou.  The human actors (Jeff Goldblum, Elizabeth Perkins) are cartoonish but appropriately so in such a far out film.
""Cats and Dogs"" moves well, and one can't help but find it a great way to spend ninety or so minutes.  Kids and adults both should love it.  Not a great movie, but it is a lot of fun.",1010275200,3,895,4.54375

Cats are underway to ensure that scientist Jeff Goldblum will never finish his serum to make all humans allergy-free to dogs.  They plan to reverse the effects to make everyone allergic to dogs.
Perhaps the most frustrating thing about 'Cats And Dogs' is that it's obviously biased, especially for a movie that scoffs at people for actually having a favourite animal!  That said, the special effects are fantastic and it's jam-packed with great characters and one-liners.  For instance, a dog labelling himself 'Toto Annihilation' will have you rolling in your seats.  Plus there's the fact that cat lovers can console themselves in the fact that the felines are undoubtedly the best characters, from the dictatorship of Mr Tinkles to the Samurai fighting cats and the Russian spy cat.  The dogs, for their part, are mostly pretty wet, except for a marvellous Susan Sarandon as a stray mutt.  Although it's surprising that many of the celebrity voices are highly unrecognisable.  Indeed, you hardly notice Alec Baldwin or Toby Maguire.
Unfortunately though, for all it's style and obvious wit, it still has such a lame plot that you'll be gagging from some real action.  It's the characters that engage rather than the big action sets.  The idea is good too, but it's still more flashy effects than story or character progression.

The cat's world domination plan was almost like something out of a 007 movie, the lead cat looked like the cat one of Bond's enemies used to have, even the gadgetry was mostly good. There appeared to be more animatronic cat work than for the dogs this and the computer altered facial expressions seemed less successful on the cats. This and the dog headquarters and transport system were the weakest points for me, that and a little violence.

I believe most kids have the ability to know what is done in fun or being portrayed as undesirable.

1639932,4,B00005O5DJ,"""Cats and Dogs"" is the story of scientist Professor Brody (Jeff Goldblum) who is working on a cure for all dog allergies. It's up to the dogs to protect his work from the evil cats lead by Mr. Tinkles (Sean Hayes). The cat's plan: to reverse the chemical for curing dog allergy to making it so when humans take it, they will be allergic to all dogs. Then cats will rule the world. But instead of the dog leader Agent Butch (Alec Baldwin) getting a professional replacement for retired agent Buddy, he gets a young beagle puppy, Lou (Tobey Maguire), instead.
Has a pretty simple plot with some hilarious parts. Yet very stupid, with the animation very, very obvious like the 'ninja kitties'. Reminded me a lot of ""102 Dalmations"" except this movie has James Bond 007 thrown in.
But the biggest reason for giving this movie 4 stars is the voice talents from stars Alec Baldwin (one of my most favorite actors in his role in ""The Hunt for Red October""), Tobey Maguire, Sean Hayes, Susan Sarandon (Played with another one of my favorite actors Kevin Costner in ""Bull Durham""), Joe Pantoliano (""The Matrix"", ""The Fugitive"", and ""U.S. Marshals""), and Charlton Heston (""Ben Hur"", ""Ten Commandments"" and ""Planet of the Apes""). It was pretty fun for me to watch the movie and guess whose voice was whose. Got most of it correct. The other reason for giving it 4 stars was the humor for some of the humor was funny, others not. Favorite parts are:
Sean Hayes as Mr. Tinkles when forced to where a bonnet: ""Does evil where a bonnet?""
Jeff Goldblum as Professor Brody, thinking there's a burglar in the house: ""I've got a mitt and I'm not afraid to use it.""
Alec Baldwin as Butch, when Lou (Toby Maguire) tries to eat an dynamite disguised as a cookie: ""That would have been the shortest assignment in history."" And more but can't write it all down.

message or ""characterization"" when you know you are going to watch a comedy?  Do you want Roadrunner to stop and think about the meaning of life?
I don't.
So first of all, DON'T compare this film with ""Babe."" The latter is a different type of movie while ""Cats and Dogs"" is simply a
 live-action-slapstick-with-animals comedy, and does not intend to get an Oscar.  It is just funny, and what's wrong with that?
Of course, the film has flaws, and they are many.  Human players are perhaps unnecessary, and here the clithe-ridden movie-making
certainly damages the whole effect of the film.  Do we need another bumbling scientist and his neglected family members again?
(And how many times does the talented Jeff Goldblum play the characters associated with ""science"" since ""The Fly""?)
These complaints aside, ""Cats and Dogs"" is a pretty good entertainment, and the white Persian cat Mr. Tinkles is a real
treat, especially if you are interested in Jim Henson's many lovable creatures.

1639939,4,B00005O5DJ,"In ""Cats and Dogs,"" perhaps the best family film of the year, you'll get a healthy dose of hearty laughs, humorous jokes, and purr-fect fun. Combining live action animals with special effects and puppets, the movie is not as amusing for its technical wizardry as it is for its grandiose amount of wonderful, lighthearted comedy that is as fluffy as its Persian antagonist. Quite simply, the movie gave me the feeling of being a kid all over again.
In a classic role reversal, the movie plays the dogs as our heroes, while the much-beloved feline is the vicious villain. The plot needs little explanation: scientist Brody (Jeff Goldblum) is out to discover a cure for human allergic reactions to dogs. This, of course, has our feline fiends just waiting to get their hands on the finished product in hopes of reversing the process and taking over the world.
Led by Mr. Tinkles (voiced with a delightfully cocky wit by actor Sean Hayes), the cats wage an all-out war against the dogs trying to prevent their plans from success. This includes Lou (voiced by Tobey Maguire), who has become the new pet to Brody's son; his inexperience as an agent makes him a prime target for assault, though his comrades, led by the stern Butch (voiced by Alec Baldwin), offer him help and guidance in the ways of becoming an agent.
To dismiss the film on the basis of its special effects and plot logic is utterly ridiculous. The movie is a shining example of what it is: a successful children's film that is pleasing in every way imaginable. It features some of the funniest dialogue of the year, which is appealing more to understanding adults, while the non-stop camera movements, cheesy effects, and delightful characters will no doubt carry children along on its wild ride.
I found myself laughing uncontrollably with the film, watching such pranks as ninja cats wearing night-vision goggles, a cat coughing up bombs disguised as fur balls, and the best of them all, featuring Mr. Tinkles falling prey to the plump maid of his owner, who dresses him up in lacy outfits (""Evil does not wear a bonnet! Did Genghis Khan ever wear a bonnet?""). It's all in the interest of tickling our fancy, and I must say, I laughed uncontrollably.
Though actors Goldblum, Elizabeth Perkins, and Alexander Pollock do impressive work as the human family, they cannot hold a candle to the voice actors who supply the dialogue for our friends in fur, including Tobey Maguire, Alec Baldwin, Susan Sarandon, Michael Duncan Clarke, Joe Pantoliano, and the great Charlton Heston. Each of the characters is voiced magnificently by their actor, though none so brilliant as Sean Hayes, who is a real hoot as Mr. Tinkles. His devilish wit and impressive voice talent are amusing, a Dr. Evil for the younger set, if you will.
To call ""Cats and Dogs"" anything but good, clean fun only proves the cynicism of adulthood. The movie is one of the most enthusiastic and energetic films of the genre I've seen in quite a while, a cross between the animal physicalities of ""Homeward Bound"" and the technical spy intelligence of the ""James Bond"" films.

The family comes together at the end, and although the puppy is offered a job as an undercover dog agent, he declines in favor of staying with his family.
  This movie is hilarious. The main villain, Mr. Tinkles, lives with a very elderly, bedridden man and his nursemaid. After the man falls asleep, his nurse comes in and sees Mr. Tinkles lying gleefully on top of him. She says ""Time for your bathy-wathy Mr. Tinkles.""

Obviously it wasn't meant to be War and Peace or other high-brow theatrics, but I've seen some great movies oriented towards the younger audience, most recently Spy Kids which is a classic in my book (if you haven't already seen this one I strongly recommend it).

The cats, led by the evil Mr. Tinkle (Sean Hayes), are determined to stop him and unleash all of the technology at their disposal to do so.

1639948,1,B00005O5DJ,"I saw this movie when it was in theaters, so I'm not going to talk about the features of this VHS version, I'm just going to talk about the film itself.
I had seen previews, and I thought it might be one of those kid's movies that I like, such as ""The Neverending Story"" or ""Ferngully"".
It wasn't.
It was horrible.
Beyond the terrible acting and contrived plot (I cannot BELIEVE that Jeff Goldblum agreed to do this piece of dirt), there were also scenes of touching child-parent bonding that were INCREDIBLY forced. Seriously, the scenes were totally contrived. The film was entirely focused around a few bits of snappy one-liners... which didn't work at all, because they weren't framed correctly by what was going on or the running dialogue. For example, the attention-getting ""At what point did you forget that WE ARE TRYING TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD???"" from the evil genius, Mr. Tinkles. A cool line, which really snazzes up the trailer. But then you see this line framed in the context of the scene and it comes off as totally out of place. This is the way with all the big scenes. It's as if the screenplay writer had a couple of great ideas in his head for one-liners or touching scenes, and then couldn't frame them to save his life.
The effects were usually okay, but were sometimes terrible, using speeding up techniques to make it seem like the dogs were doing something faster than they actually did while shooting, such as when the big dumb one rolled across the street really fast. The film, while being very wholesome and pure, is also GRAPHICALLY violent. Dogs bash their heads into things left and right and animals get thrown about by each other into walls and fine china as they fight hand to hand. It was enough to turn my stomache.
Atop this all... really, underneath it all, was the most heinous and subtle racism I'd ever seen.
First you have the villification of cats. Cats always have to be horrible conniving evil creatures. See most older cartoons such as 'Tom and Jerry', and films like ""Lady and the Tramp"" where a pair of siamese cats (who sound and look VERY asian) try to kill a baby just to get milk, and even the rattiest dog is noble and loyal. And even one of my favorites, 'An American Tail', villifies most cats except the simplest: played aptly by Dom DeLuise.... Occasionally cats get a decent film (""Cats Don't Dance""), but this has been rare in my experience.
But then to even expound this damage, the first set of cats sent in to infiltrate the household are NINJA cats, with accompanying cliches to denote japanese descent, like accent and sneakiness - slitheriness, even. When they fail, the antagonist, Mr. Tinkles, sends in THE RUSSIAN, a very cute kitten who speaks with a deep and thickly accented russian voice. He is very violent and throws about spikes and metal cat claws and uses a boomarang like weapon with sickles on each end.
Perhaps the worst part is that the villain is a somewhat intelligent and refined creature, while the heroes are a child puppy and a 'military' type dog. Thusly slyly casting bad light on anyone intelligent and glorifying childishness and military mindedness.
This is the sort of subtle egocentric programming I was hoping we could get past after world war 2 and the cold war. It seems almost as if Hollywood - perhaps driven by some organization, who knows - is trying to slyly program our children. I am very glad to have seen this horrible film, for it has brought this to my attention. The children grow up, and may know on an intellectual level that all races are equal, but, look here: all the villains are foreigners, strange and different peoples who are out to get us! All mad scientists are german, all giant brute fist-fighters are russian, all sneaky spies are japanese.... This is wrong.
For the first time in my ENTIRE life - even when faced with films such as 'Species', 'Mortal Kombat: Annihilation', and 'Tomb Raider' - for the first time ever in my movie going career, I WALKED OUT OF THE THEATER. I could NOT stomache this horrible film. They INSULT children's intelligence and do it only injustice with this sort of waste. Do you know what it takes to make me WALK OUT of a theater? That's how... loathable... this film was.
If you still think this film might be okay for your kids, watch it yourself, and watch for these things I'm talking about. But it is your choice. I won't say ""don't let your kids see this!"", I would only say you should rent it and watch it by yourself first.",1001635200,19,4485,4.593516209476309
1639949,4,B00005O5DJ,"""Cats and Dogs"" is one of those films that can appeal to parents as well as children.  The cute fuzzy animals that provide the main focus are sure to satisfy the attention of any child, and the technological absurity of the conflict between these to-all-outward-appearances docile housepets is sure to amuse any parents.  Like ""Shrek,"" there are many jokes which are intended for the adult perspective (mostly in the vein of mocking James Bond films) and, additionally, there are some spectacular special effects which will appeal to all ages.
""Cats and Dogs"" is one of those films that, if it had come out maybe five years ago, would have been instantly hailed as a classic.  There is a sort of ""Wizard of Oz"" or ""Mary Poppins"" wizardry to it, but the special effects that it employs have become so commonplace that ""Cats and Dogs"" seems sort of twice-viewed even though this is its first run.  This shouldn't be construed as a severe criticism, remember that ""Wizard of Oz"" on its second viewing is far more entertaining than most films are on their first.  There is probably nothing in this movie that will dazzle you, but it will keep your attention, and there are plenty of laughs, so I recommend you go see it, especially if you have children.",1001030400,,1249,4.7110091743119265
1639950,5,B00005O5DJ,"This is a movie for anyone who wants to just sit back and get in some good laughs. Sure, it's slapstick, but that doesn't mean it's not truly funny and original. By the number of guffaws I heard in the theater when I saw the film, I wasn't the only one who enjoyed it. The inept cat characters were a complete gas - poor Mr. Tinkles (the ""Blofeld"" of the evil cat underworld) needed to do a better job of recruiting goons. The doggie gags were perhaps expected but still funny (e.g., Butch with his head hanging out the window of the rocket sled). As one reviewer wisely suggest - at LEAST rent this movie, then you may decide (like me) that you simply MUST have a copy for your private collection.",1000944000,2,698,4.295454545454546
