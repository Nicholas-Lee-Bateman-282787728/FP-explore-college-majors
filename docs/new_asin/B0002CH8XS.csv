8026045,4,B0002CH8XS,"This collection only collects the first series of the show. If one is curious about the show that inspired the much better known ""Sanford & Son"" this package is worth checking out if you have the proper DVD player. But bear in mind that this is only the first series of many and it's likely the show is not at its best yet. Most of the 6 episodes only feature the 2 key players and no other actors at all! The result of this is a lot of long and drawn out rambling that can often be difficult to follow, especially considering the heavy English dialect that they speak with. However, here and there you'll still be able to find a few classic moments that you may recognize from the better known American counterpart. It's also interesting to see how British TV of the early 60's compares with American TV of that same era. British TV was definitely not as G-Rated as American TV was. On the downside, however, I have no idea why the British are lazy and don't like to use too many actors and are only able to produce 6 episodes for an entire season.

But to see the origins of Sanford and Son in a more primitive atmosphere, this collection can be quite interesting. I'm not too sure if the subsequent seasons are available on an individual basis, but when I manage to come across some extra quid, I may be tempted to get the COMPLETE SERIES package in order to find out if this show picks up steam as it moves along.",1378684800,,1417,4.307116104868914
