8082479,5,B000B6KRD8,My first Goudeau  step aerobic dvd.. I like that the instruction is detailed .. I also like the work out is divided so you can do the warm up separately.. The actual workout can be separate as well as the stretching cool down . This is important to me because I am not an intermediate stepper I am clumsy. I am a jogger or a spinner.. I am great with the firm .. Routines are basic. Patrick gets fancy .. It's s lot of fun . So many turns and combinations .. You get a good sweat and a great workout . I am still learning the steps .. I repeat the first work out a few times to get my cardio vascular in and then I try the fancy steps again .. I love it and I will purchase more DVDs .. The seller shipped in a decent amount of time,1441411200,,732,3.8157894736842106
8082480,3,B000B6KRD8,"Choreography is too confusing for me. I love step aerobics, but I couldn't keep up with the different steps. He is great getting you pumped up, but not enough time for me to keep up with each step he adds on.",1431820800,,208,4.097560975609756
8082481,5,B000B6KRD8,Love this,1406505600,,9,4.0
8082482,4,B000B6KRD8,"Quite invigorating and enjoyable, but the fine and intricate steps that are often used make it hard to follow. Emphasis seems to be oriented more in the direction of dance moves than aerobics. Patrick's style is always refreshing and accommodating.",1370217600,,248,5.225
8082483,5,B000B6KRD8,Very good step workout! He does have some fancy moves but he gives great instructions. He has a fun attitude!,1299110400,,109,4.5
8082484,4,B000B6KRD8,"This highly motivating work out will definitely get your heart rate up - once you master the choreography.  If you are not a fan of turning on the step, Patrick's workouts are NOT for you.  I myself abandoned and came back to this one several times before I could call it ""enjoyable"" - and I have been stepping with Petra Kolber and Cathe Friedrich for years.  The moves are not necessarily difficult, but the transitions are quick, and the turns can be dizzying.  You'll also need a good amount of floor space as moves like ""go for a walk"" and ""Indecision"" are both on and off the step.

That said, time certainly flies, sweat drips, and Patrick himself is so encouraging you're motivated to keep trying.  The learning curve is high, but once you get there, it's a lot of fun!",1227139200,4,777,4.475177304964539
8082485,4,B000B6KRD8,"In this workout, there are endless series of optional progressions (he adds layers and layers of moves).  You can stick to the basic pattern or add these complex add-ons.  Either way, it's challenging.  You get three complete dance routines that make you use all of the step.  He teaches each move easily, and he is very upbeat and enthusiastic (which helps you become just the same).  I love this dvd and the energy level is always high during the workout and as a result; after the workout too.",1134691200,4,496,4.590909090909091
