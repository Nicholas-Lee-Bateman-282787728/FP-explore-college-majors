WAS IT FILLED WITH PLOT TWISTS ONLY A MASTERMIND COULD HAVE IMAGINED? INDEED NOT. WHAT IT WAS.. WAS A REAL GOOD TIME.  IT WAS MIND CANDY AND EYE CANDY THAT BEAT THE HELL OUT OF CHOCOLATE.
  I SAW MAGIC MIKE THIS SUMMER IN A LITTLE OLD THEATER IN THE LITTLE OLD TOWN OF KINGMON, AZ AT MID DAY.  THE PLACE WAS FILLED TO THE BRIM WITH WHITE HAIRED LITTLE OLD LADIES, MY SISTER-IN-LAW AND MYSELF BEING THE YOUNGEST BY FAR IN THE PLACE. IT WAS PRETTY QUIET AT FIRST, THEN SOMEONE LET OUT A WHISTLE AND THE PLACE ROCKED FOR THE REST OF THE MOVIE.sEE IT WITH YOUR GIRLFRIENDS, YOUR GAY FRIENDS, JUST SEE IT WITH SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO LET LOOSE AND HAVE A LITTLE FUN.

5 Stars???????????????? Are you kidding me.....maybe for undersexed women this maybe the end all to end all coyote ugly movie, but to be sure I'm pretty sure it's not going to be Channing's ""Brokeback"" breakout movie he was looking for.

2929593,5,B000K7UBWK,"Mark October 23rd on your calendars as that is the day ""Magic Mike"" (the box office sensation during the summer of 2012) comes to DVD and Blu Ray.

 ""Magic Mike"" stars hunky Channing Tatum (in probably his best role to date) as a male stripper who decides after years of stripping for women as a sideline job that he has had enough.

 When Mike (Tatum) befriends a young 19 year old named Adam at the beginning of the film Mike gets Adam into the stripping business only to discover that Adam gets involved with drugs which leads to many problems for the two. Mike then decides he wants to lead a ""normal"" life, have a relationship with a woman and settle down.

 The movie is loosely based on Channing's own real-life as a 19 year old stripper in Florida.

 Gay men and females will LOVE the film as not only does it show off Channing's back side (and I am not talking about his back), but the dance numbers, music and story are very strong and believable.

 Other studs in the movie include Matt Bomer from television's ""White Collar"", Alex Pettyfer, Cody Horn, Joe Manganiello and Matthew McConaughey.

 The movie was an enormous box office hit becoming the runaway hit at theatres during the summer of 2012 making over $155,000,000 at the U.S. box office alone on a $7,000,000 budget!!!

 The special bonus features will include extended dance sequences, a featurette that contains Channing Tatum being interviewed on what it was like to get his fellow actors into the mold as male strippers and much more!

 In July, 2012 Channing announced that the studio and he (as one of the producers) are indeed working on a sequel as the film was an enormous successs.",1346803200,103,1663,4.605442176870748
2929594,5,B000K7UBWK,"Hell yeah baby, finally us ladies get some Mancandy to watch on the big-screen!!! Within the first five minutes of the movie you get to see Channing Tatum strut-around butt-ass naked! You get several more clear snap shots of that nice rear end several times throughout the movie. Of course when he is doing a strip routine in a thong. But hey that's ok. I never watched any of the Step-Up movies so I had no clue Channing Tatum could move. The boy can dance! But besides the hot naked Bods you get to see for most of the movie (Thank Goodness), it does tell a story of a man who wants to further himself in life and seemingly leave his wild ways behind him. The movie also shows how life in the fast line could lead to self-destruction as Alex Pettyfer's character depicts. Men should watch it too. Dont be haters!",1346630400,67,814,4.3618421052631575

2929631,4,B000K7UBWK,"Ummm...I have mixed feelings about this movie. The guys are hot and their dance routines are fabulous. The one number where they were all dressed in raincoats, whew, Channing Tatum rocked it. I love his dancing. And yes, these men were incredibly sexy.

However, I was uncomfortable with some of the stripping. These men do things to women that would embarrass the crap out of me. Grabbing women by the head and pushing their faces into crotches is not something I like watching. I understand there are women who'd enjoy that. I'm just not one of them.

That being said, I like the storyline. I learned a lot regarding the world of male stripping, which was really interesting. My favorite moment of the entire movie  was when the men let their guard down and talked about how they really felt. Sometimes even men struggle with being objectified.

So enjoy this movie. Just be prepared for some shocking moments and seriously consider the person who watches this movie with you. I could never watch this with my mother.",1494720000,,1019,4.740112994350283
2929632,5,B000K7UBWK,"Channing Tatum and friends dancing in next to nothing. Cool music. The romance storyline isn't believable-- no chemistry-- but who cares. This movie is great fun to watch with girlfriends or if you're feeling down-- trust me, you'll cheer right up! It has an R rating for a reason, so if you're offended by blatant sexuality and sex simulated at a strip club, this isn't your film. But for the rest of us-- SO much fun.",1494547200,5,419,4.526315789473684
2929633,4,B000K7UBWK,"I won't lie - that man-dancing aside, it was entertaining enough that I sat through it with her. Not a horrible movie. Maybe I'm saying that because I liked a majority of the cast? I guess the plot actually does suck....

Okay, let's just be real - no one watches this movie for the plot. Ladies (and gentlemen, if this movie falls into the realm of your proclivities), enjoy.",1494374400,2,376,4.449275362318841

Acting was super horrible. Cody Horn as Brooke was the worst choice. The girl has no acting skills and her mouth was as stiff as a poker . The dialogue between all the actors was awkward and uncomfortable. The only ones trying to make it work was Channing and Matthew. It seemed like there was no script that these actors had to follow. The camera never zoomed in on faces so you don't know who is who. No plot, means no good story. The ""kid"" Alex Pettyfer seemed like a mute during the entire movie.

I have a Kindle Fire as well, and often download movies and such onto my Kindle for travel.  Past that, most of my Amazon Video watching is streaming either on my TiVo or my Roku.

It's not only purely a drama, it's a rather dark one. We bought this recently and my wife and I decided to watch it for a ""funny"" evening after dinner. Surprised and sorely disappointed. There is nothing comical here, except perhaps some of the dancing scenes, which are not horrible but are mediocre in most cases. We figured it would be a couple of hours of laughs, and eye candy for my wife; she agreed that it was, but not enough to offset the serious drama. Even ""Fluffy"" was a bad guy in this one, and his comedy special was one of the reasons we decided to give it a try.

2930015,5,B000K7UBWK,My first experience with this movie was very interesting. My very sweet cousin rented it with the thought that it was somehow about a magician and put it in the DVD player and went to go cook some dinner and came back to find me and her two teenage children watching it. After she got over the horror of her possibly inappropriate movie choice she decided it was so cute she was willing to sit down with her kids and watch it. This is a super fun somewhat inappropriate romantic comedy that is perfect for any kind of girls night in or a pick-me-up when its raining kind of movie.,1447286400,,580,4.281818181818182

The service was simple, ordering it was simple, viewing it was simple and I love Amazon Prime for watching movies, however, the movie itself was not so great.

I can NOT believe the hype over this footage (it doesn't deserve the title of being an actual movie). Especially when the filming my 10 yr old could and has done better at. I wasted precious time waiting for it to get better but it didn't happen. If they had inverted stars for negatives it would have gotten a -5 rating from me. In fact it was the worst movie I've ever seen and that's pretty bad considering I owned a movie rental business for over 5 years. Just plain sad from the filming, story line and all the way to the acting. Anyone associated with the making of this ""whateveer"" should hang their head in shame.

Last weekend I went to see Magic Mike XXL. The plot stank but it was enjoyable because Channing Tatum. However, I hadn't seen the first Magic Mike so naturally, I wanted to. So I did... And. I. Just. Can. Not.
Channing Tatum is gorgeous. That's a given. I'd watch him paint a wall. But this movie and his acting were absolute trash. There was no plot. I felt like I was thrown storylines with no real introduction or background. As beautiful as these men were I wanted it to be over so badly. AND WHO WAS THAT TARZAN GUY?! Whose bright idea was it to hire him?! He was so stiff it looked painful. And Mike's love interest? HOR. E. BOL. If I never see her in another film again, it would be too soon. And can Matthew McConaughey not? Can he just not?
Channing Tatum is sexy and I lust him but not enough to look over this dumpster fire of a movie. So glad I wasn't all over this when it came out a few years ago. I missed NOTHING.

When I saw the previews for Magic Mike XXL, I knew that not only did I want to see it but I wanted my boyfriend to see it with me. The only way the new movie would make sense to him was if he had seen Magic Mike, so we watched it on Amazon Prime at home and he really enjoyed it. He enjoys all types of movies, but music and dance interest him - he is a good dancer himself. So this movie is good for anyone who is interested in dance as an art form.",1436400000,,584,3.875

2930602,3,B000K7UBWK,"Over the years, plenty of bad movies have made millions by simply featuring beautiful women wearing very little, so why not try turning that around? The idea for Magic Mike, actually came from it's star, Channing Tatum, who worked as a male stripper prior to becoming eye candy in some really bad films. The idea was solid, an obvious money maker, but this film really could have been something special, had they added a half way decent story line to it. Magic Mike is about the interactions of three people. You have the eccentric club owner (Matthew McConaughey), his star performer, Magic Mike (Channing Tatum), and the newbie (Alex Pettyfer). The film does take several small breaks from the techno music and dancing strippers, to touch on story lines of regret, romance, corruption, and drug use, but they are so brief and resolved so quickly, that one may ask what was the point? The point of a film like this is to attract people with strippers, but that doesn't mean it couldn't have had a good story to go along with it! The writers could have had just as many dancing scenes and lap dances, but still added something like a rival company or an organized crime connection, something to give this film a little substance, but they didn't. As for the stars, Channing Tatum was his usual robotic self, albeit one that had some pretty sweet dance moves. Alex Pettyfer was fairly entertaining as the newcomer, learning as he goes, but the only true star here was Matthew McConaughey. His jokes and outrageous persona were really pretty good, and the only thing of substance for a true film aficionado to appreciate. Magic Mike was unique and drew large audiences, leading to a sequel due later this year. With a little luck, that film will have a little more substance and a little less dancing, making it appealing to a broader audience.",1433808000,,1842,4.72360248447205
2930603,5,B000K7UBWK,Loads of fun! I've never seen a real strip show so I can't say it's realistic but Channing Tatum was very entertaining. The work he has been devoting to his acting craft is evident as well. I will see XXL when it is released!,1433808000,,225,4.136363636363637

2930608,3,B000K7UBWK,I think the main reason I continued watching this was Channing Tatum's abs other than that this movie was definitely what you would expect from a movie like this.

A male stripper teaches a younger performer how to party, pick up women, and make easy money.

What did I think?

I was ready to have the pants entertained off me, and the first half hour did just that.  There was so much eye candy for the ladies early on  special mentions go to Matthew McConaugheys on-screen bravado and bongo playing and Channing Tatums body moves.

But I fear their sugar high simply wears off.  It is a lot what I think being sober at a bachelorette party would be like; at first it was exciting and fun and a little bit naughty, but the longer it dragged on, the more you wished you were drunk off your ass.

Needed less romance, more bromance.",1431734400,,684,4.330708661417323

2930695,5,B000K7UBWK,This movie is really good! It's not just about a bunch of male strippers (dangit!) It has a good story to it too. Channing Tatum has got to be the best male dancer I have ever seen in any dance movie he has been in. For all the ladies and men out there who want to watch a good story and see some kick butt abs and moves get this! You won't be sorry. I can't wait to see the next one!,1427241600,,384,3.6951219512195124

2930705,3,B000K7UBWK,The only redeeming part of this movie is watching Channing Tatum dance.  If only they had made a two-hour movie of him dancing and scrapped the pathetic plot!,1426550400,,158,4.642857142857143
2930706,1,B000K7UBWK,"This review doesn't really contain spoilers... because there is NOTHING to spoil. -_-  No but really, don't worry, no spoilers.

This is a review for the movie, not the video service. The video service was great, no connection problems, great quality. The movie, however, was horrendous. One of the worst movies ever by far. People wanting to see half-naked guys dancing will be disappointed because there was not much of that at all when compared to the other scenes. People who enjoy good movies won't be happy because this movie has almost no apparent plot development, ZERO character development, horrible dialogue (sounds like real life dialogue, it's not interesting at all unless you're actually HAVING that conversation in real life- hearing these types of mundane convos in a movie, especially when the movie is made up of ONLY mundane conversations, is boring as hell cuz you're not connecting with the characters at all), and on top of all that... ending? WHAT ending?!?! There was NO ending, no conflict resolution (no denouement, for you art buffs), so no satisfaction at the end.

This movie lacks depth. AND it's not funny. that's all you need to know. If it were a comedy, it'd be okay, if it were a documentary it'd be okay because you're learning something about real life/history, and if it were a male strip show from beginning to end it'd be okay because that's what we all wanted to be entertained by, but since it's none of those things- it's really just a bunch of scenes thrown together to try to resemble a drama. But there was NO plot to drive any of those scenes forward and NO character development/story to weave those scenes together so that leaves you with literally nothing. It was a confusing movie due to how strangely written and edited it was.
My friend and I were so disappointed. We were in utter disbelief and confusion as to what we just saw. My friend turned to me and said ""you still want to watch the sequel now?"" and we probably will not.",1426550400,,1983,4.70893371757925
2930707,5,B000K7UBWK,"Ok.... it has Matthew McConaughey, stripping.... enough said, FIVE STARS!  haha  - Ok in all seriousness I really enjoyed this movie. The acting is not the greatest from the other actors, but for a girls night in movie, there is plenty to distract you from that and I promise after the movie, you will have a few 'Magic Mike' dreams ;-)",1426550400,,336,4.491803278688525

2930709,3,B000K7UBWK,Boring.  I'd heard a lot about this one and just now watched it.  I'd heard a lot about the male T&A in it.  NOT.  Matthew please put your clothes on. Channing came over like a young GenX although he was supposed to be 30.  Joe Manganiello had the hottest bod there and he was in the background most of the time.  Produced by Channing for Channing.  Very disappointing.  Very standard plot. Very few visuals.  If Channing had woken up in the morning with Joe...,1426377600,,461,4.392857142857143

8216502,4,B000K7UBWK,"Im afraid the low ratings claiming this movie has such a bad or lack of story are missing the entire point in the first place.  Its almost like a male watching an adult film for the great acting.

Women (and gay males) don't really get a lot of films with a desired centerpiece like this. Most movies have a focal point of females when it comes to sexuality and intimate scenes. This is a very nice change. It also gives women like myself a taste of what we cannot access (meaning - people like myself who have zero strip clubs in existence near us) and able to watch in the comfort of our own home.

If you're watching for a great, rich plotline this movie is not for you. But if you're watching for a good time and some good eye candy..by all means, I highly recommend!",1521590400,,771,4.2312925170068025
