5679514,4,B00BWQTTD0,"A lot of people remember the TV series Flipper but
have never heard of Daktari. They were both on in
the 60s. Since I grew up enjoying the Walt Disney
animal based shows I also liked Daktari. If you
don't enjoy Flipper or Lassie you won't like Daktari.
If you like the look and feel of shows in the 60s
check it out.",1405123200,,316,4.031746031746032

5679519,5,B00BWQTTD0,It's just like going back in time some 40plus years. A perfect reminder to my childhood. I really enjoyed looking the DVDs. I'm really lucky that Daktari finally is getting released on DVD.,1374624000,5,189,4.757575757575758
5679520,5,B00BWQTTD0,"I'm not particularly an animal lover although as a child watching this I just wanted to live inWamaru with Clarence and Judy.  Of course the adults on screen appeared to be fine examples too.  I can tell now that it was not filmed in Africa but if my telly were still Black and White I doubt I'd be any wiser.  Shame its only available from America.

It's a fine programme that dates in such a nice way.  Shame they don't make them like this anymore.  In today worlds Clarence would have had corrective eye surgery and have won the Olympics and Judy the monkey would be running for president.",1370908800,6,592,4.385321100917431
5679521,5,B00BWQTTD0,Thank you so much for making the second season of Daktari available! This was my favorite show growing up. Have waited a long time for a high quality copy of this series to be available. Purchased the complete first season and was very satisified. I am also very pleased with my purchase of the complete second season and am truly enjoying discovering one of my favorite series again! Looking forward to seasons three and four and hope you will make them available as soon as possible! Thank You! Pam Spencer.,1369267200,7,509,4.666666666666667
5679522,3,B00BWQTTD0,"""Daktari: The Complete Second Season""  is a seven-disc DVD set containing 30 episodes of the second season of this adventure series.  Filmed at Africa, U.S.A., a wild-animal park near Los Angeles, ""Daktari"" tells the story of an American doctor and his daughter in Africa (""Daktari"" is the Swahili word for doctor).

Marsh Tracy (Marshall Thompson) is a veterinarian who runs an animal study center with the assistance of his daughter Paula (Cheryl Miller) and a native named Mike (Hari Rhodes).  Jenny Jones (Erin Moran) appeared in the second season as a seven-year-old orphan who joins the Tracy household, which also includes a lion named Clarence and a chimpanzee named Judy.

The Tracys' primary job is protecting animals from poachers and local officials.  Producer Ivan Tors began his career writing and producing sci-fi films before turning to TV with such shows as ""Science Fiction Theater,"" ""Sea Hunt,"" and ""The Aquanauts.""

This mid-1960's show is clearly geared for families.  There is little violence, good messages about animal conservation, and simple-to-follow plots with pleasant resolutions.  Clarence was a star in his own right in the feature film, ""Clarence, the Cross-Eyed Lion"" (1965).

There are no bonus features on this release.",1365552000,7,1255,5.324873096446701
