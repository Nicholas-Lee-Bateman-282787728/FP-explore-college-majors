Believable story of believable characters in a believable world of a NYC vigilante. Gritty Neo-Noir with a jaw dropping ending, not to missed.",1320105600,8,285,4.5

4691175,4,B005GLHO48,A little dark but I liked it.  It's more a psychological study than an action movie although there was some action in it as well.,1492905600,,129,4.16

4691177,5,B005GLHO48,"Very good, quite the dark twist at the end. I see some 1 and 2 star reviews saying the acting was bad, but I would have to disagree. I thought the acting was pretty solid across the board. I would probably give this 4 and a half stars instead of 5 because it lacks some of the polish a bigger budget film would have, but at the same time it works with the subject matter, so I rounded up. I was expecting something like a less comedic ""Kickass"" given the title and cover, but this was much darker than I anticipated.",1491264000,,516,4.118811881188119

 If you had, a messed up dad, and you like revenge flicks, I give it 5 stars.
Very good acting, good pacing [for drama], very good cinematography.
One slight detractor - couple too many flashback scenes, but doable.

4691196,1,B005GLHO48,Let's see- this movie portrays white males as idiots or insane with a warped sense of morality. Minorities are treated as superior and we are treated to the propaganda that a broken justice system is the price we have to pay. Never mind raping and killing of innocents. And vigilante justice is inderior to the moral superiority of minorities and women.,1484697600,,353,4.80327868852459

I like it overall, the theme, the plot, but man, the movie has really bad lighting, half the movie is black. Aside from that I would say the camera angles and cinematography prove of great quality.

SPOILER HERE:
Overall: I would say that the reason I couldn't give this movie a 4/5 which was what I was going to give it, the ending simply doesn't make sense. Why did Sean all the sudden decide to put the poison on the envelope and go berserk conveniently enough after getting wasted at some crappy party? For a grade A high school student it doesn't make sense that he would do that after killing his father and not before, in my opinion it would have made the movie three times better than it actually is, in fact I would say that the ending kind of destroyed the movie, so much I would say, that I had to write a review on the movie for it, final score: 3/5.",1477180800,,944,4.209944751381215

Boy Wonder is entertaining, it has a really well developed story line, and there are quite a few points in the movie that left me shaking my head saying, ""what the ****"".
Overall this seems to be a story of a boy who suffers an unimaginable tragedy, and relives it every day of his life. After seeing his mom murdered (the only light in his life), he is left to live in a world of darkness. He sets his eyes on only one thing, justice, and in the end he achieves his goals... perhaps.",1475193600,,624,4.2521008403361344

I didn't even realize I had seen it until I saw our hero sitting at a desk in the police station, which was a few minutes in.  I was favorably impressed with it then, and I was again this time.

I'm not going to try to summarize or analyze this movie like the ""professionals"" did.  I rate on how well I liked the movie, which is what the stars indicate when you hover over them.  Since this was the second time I watched the whole movie, I'd say I liked it pretty well.  Not well enough to rush out and buy the DVD, but well enough to watch it again in a couple years when I've forgotten it - if it and I are still on Prime.

Damaged people doing damaging things to other damaged/damaging people - it can be a really boring formula but sometimes you get some good fight scenes out of it.

As he hunts for the man who killed his mother, he encounters several such individuals.

4691455,5,B005GLHO48,"Films like Boy Wonder are part of the reason Amazon Instant Video is such an asset.  This film probably did not find many audiences in the shuffle that big movies tend to dominate.  Here, it is a worthy find.  The story is about a boy who witnesses his mothers murder in a carjacking.  He grows up, introverted and quiet, devastated by the loss.  Slowly we see he has dedicated himself to not only academic studies but martial arts, mainly kick boxing as well.  He becomes a vigilante fighting with criminals who have escaped justice.  While this sounds a bit clich&eacute;d, it is not.

A new detective begins to look at the case, as Sean (the boy, now a teen) begins to emerge as a suspect is the crimes he is committing.  As the story unfolds we learn a number of things are not what they seem, and the climax has a surprise right at the end.  This film is well worth watching, and recommending.

The boy tried to cope by burying himself and excelling at school with a side effect of being a loner.  And he decides to learn self-defense (MMA) on the side.

In a series of coincidences, a female detective becomes enmeshed with his story.

He's a Boy Wonder based on his ability to think three steps ahead.  He turns into a vigilante and eventually turns into a victim of his own justice.

The low budget actors still did a quality job but what really made this movie 5 stars was one very sharp, unpredictable twist and one very ironic ending.  And it included some run of the mill fun stuff where a kid takes out some career scumbags (icing).",1422057600,2,943,4.473684210526316

It's SOOO unbelievable, that I just couldn't get past it.  On top of it, she's supposed to be BRAND NEW to the homicide division, but acts likes she's in charge of it.  OBNOXIOUS.

In real life, those guys would never put up with her smart mouth, especially coming from some girl who looks like she should be working at Macys in the perfume isle.  Completely missed the mark with her.  At least get a woman who can pull it off.  I'm sorry but she couldn't and she didn't, and that just made the movie annoying.

-- Friedrich Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil

""Passion. It lies in all of us. Sleeping... waiting... and though unwanted, unbidden, it will stir... open its jaws and howl. It speaks to us... guides us. Passion rules us all. And we obey. What other choice do we have? Passion is the source of our finest moments. The joy of love... the clarity of hatred... the ecstasy of grief. It hurts sometimes more than we can bear. If we could live without passion, maybe we'd know some kind of peace. But we would be hollow. Empty rooms, shuttered and dank. Without passion, we'd be truly dead.""
-- Joss Whedon

Although the ending is cool, yet somewhat disappointing, the lesson it attempts to impress upon the viewer is that vengeance is no substitute for justice!

4691601,5,B005GLHO48,"There have been a spate of super hero films my personal fave being `Super', but there are some very good ones indeed and I thought this might be the same. Happily I was completely wrong - this owes as much to revenge films as any other genre. We meet Sean (played with considered poise by Caleb Steinmeyer - `Lost'). He witnessed the brutal murder of his mother as a child and has since become something of a recluse. His alcoholic father with a history of domestic abuse and is ambiguous in his paternal role but it is quite clear from the start that Sean aint exactly crazy about pops.

He maintains the guise of a straight `A student' at school and spends his spare time going through mug shots of ne'er do wells at the local Police precinct who handled the murde - ostensibly to identify his mothers killer. Then a new female detective comes along and takes a big professional interest in our reclusive teen who seems to be always `falling over' and getting bruised etc. What he is hiding is that he has become a night stalker, vigilante who wants to take out bad guys. This is not a `Death Wish' he actually comes across as genuinely scared at what he is doing; but he goes ahead anyway. The violence is the realistic sort - not stylised rubbish that owes more to choreography and as such it all adds to lend authenticity to the film.

I kept thinking this was going to verge into clich as it has the feel of a low budget indie film, but it keeps you guessing right up till the end and the more I saw, the more I really liked it. It has also stayed with me which is no bad thing at all. God acting, great script, genuine twsits and an actual thriller of a plot. The only thing they appear to have got wrong was the lack of publicity as I only happened across this by chance - absolutely recommended.",1392508800,24,1804,4.302941176470588
4691602,3,B005GLHO48,Different! The flashback sequences help create and cement the suspense.  Found the story line also different  not the usual vigilante approach  defending others being abused or misused.  Detective gut/insight and surprised but understandable change in justice due process perspective given the threat levied against her and son.  Surprised ending.

4691613,4,B005GLHO48,"Boy Wonder (Michael Morrissey, 2010)

Imagine that, as a child, you saw your mother murdered. Imagine that the police have come up with nothing in the twelve years between then and now, no matter how much you stick around. (One character in the movie says that lead character Sean Donovan has become the precinct's unofficial mascot). Imagine you think you could do better. What would you do?

Variations on the theme have populated any number of recent movies, from various attempts at the Batman franchise to Super to Kick-Ass. The best of the bunch, though, you may not have heard of: Boy Wonder, a low-key thriller that came right out of left field. First time writer/director Michael Morrissey got his start in Hollywood as a producer of reality TV shows, mostly centered around home renovation (First Time Flippers, Ten Grand in Your Hand, etc.). As of this writing, Boy Wonder is his only fictional effort. I know reality TV probably pays the bills better, but for my money, Morrissey needs to ditch the networks and start doing this stuff full-time, because his debut movie knocks one out of the park.

This is normally where I would put the plot summary, but I kind of did that in the first paragraph. I'm sure you concluded from what I wrote up there that Sean Donovan (TV character actor Caleb Steinmeyer in his first feature appearance, and as of this writing, lasthe seems to have gone behind the camera as a production assistant) turns to vigilantism both as an outlet for his pent-up rage and as a way of tracking down his mother's killer. Thus, Sean is playing both sides of the fieldenlisting the help of the police department by day while evading them at night.

When it comes right down to it, there's not a great deal of plot to this, but that helps the movie stay on track, and it also leaves ample room for Morrissey to develop his characters. That's what takes the movie from standard revenge thriller into the stratosphere. Ironically, it's also most likely why the movie went nowhere upon its initial release. This is not a movie where stuff blows up; it is more interested in the mentality of its protagonist than it is his deeds (though don't get me wrong, there's enough of that to keep you jumping now and again). You probably missed this one the first time around, as almost everyone did. But if you like intelligent, well-paced, slow thrillers, catch this at your earliest opportunity. ****",1389916800,,2421,4.716312056737588

Then, eventually, I got so immersed in the main character and story that I found myself glued.  I thought the acting was really well done.  James Russo had a limited role but is always a good actor.  I thought Caleb Steinmeyer's acting was a little flat in the beginning until I realized why and boy did his acting shine through as the story went on.  Once you begin to feel for the character, you know the actor has done a superb job.  This movie had some predictable moments, including what drives Sean, but the additions to that inciting event were a little unexpected and provided for a decent ""wow"" factor.  The very end leaves you with something very serious to think about, which was terrific.  The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars (I'd probably give it 4.5, if I could) was because I thought the supporting character, Teresa Ames', drive wasn't projected enough in terms of her decision to do what she does toward the end.",1383091200,,1031,4.475935828877005

4691633,3,B005GLHO48,"If there were a 3.5 star rating, I would have given it.  It is a solid movie and worth the time to watch, especially if you have Amazon Prime!

Pros:
1.  Lead actor (Caleb Steinmeyer) does a very good job in portraying an angst-ridden teen.  He sells his part and is totally believable.
2.  The father (Bill Sage) stole every scene he was in.  He carried the most powerful scene in the movie where he pleaded for forgiveness and gave invaluable advice to his son.
3.  The pacing and plot turns were well thought out.  The action scenes were well done, but not over-done.

Cons:
1.  Zulay Henao, the take-no-crap Latina detective.  She is so good at her job, that she even has an impressive career for a man! Or some garbage.  I have read that some of her shortcoming in this movie was the way the dialogue was written.  I disagree.  Her delivery is horrific.  Her motivation and emotion is a result of her lines instead of the other way around.  At no point did I feel sorry for her or empathize with her character in any way.  This alone removes 2 stars off of the overall rating since she was such a major character in the story.  The should have traded up with this lead.
2.  The extra plot twist at the end.  It was too much and purely there for shock value.  I am sure it was supposed to be a lesson in the positive side of Due Process, but the whole sequence of events undid the best scene of the movie.  The very last twist was not really the offending sequence, rather that it got there in the first place.  Should have made the redemption stick.

Too often a decision is made to try to save or elevate a movie by putting in one more big surprise, but in this case, it sank it.  They can't all be The Sixth Sense.  Trust me, go watch The Village, or Unbreakable, or Signs, or The Happening...",1377388800,,1800,4.2514792899408285

It was extremely boring including the musical scoring that seemed to be loud and distracting rather than increasing the depth of the intended emotion. Watching this movie was like working with someone who is really stoned... their is a lot of build up but nothing ever really gets done! Most of the last 5 minutes was okay but certainly not worth having to endure the other, seemingly, 100 hours of this snorefest. Especially not for its anticlimactic non-ending. I would not have given this movie more than one star but sense it didn't cost me anything, on my prime account, I suppose it could have been worse... but not by much.

Pros- A few good scenes that worked toward character background though not really a lot toward true character development.
The film work had a gritty home-movie feel to that works well in low cost/low budget movies like this to give the audience the feeling that they are watching from a bystander point of view.(kind of artsy I guess.)

Cons- Well, everything else!

Conclusion- This movie and its methods would have made a great 15 minute short but feel on its face as a full length movie. Of course, that is just my amateur opinion.",1376092800,,1246,4.654545454545454

Considering the reviews here on Amazon, I clicked in desperation for how long I'd been searching for something to watch. Well, this movie really surprised me. There are obvious places where the lack of budget and elaborate production are seen, but honestly, the movie moves along at a fast enough clip that you don't have time to really concern yourself with those distractions. Knowing virtually nothing about this movie beforehand, this was a treat for me as I could hardly keep my eyes and mind off it (I often work out to Amazon Prime video, while wearing bluetooth stereo headphones). The cast of characters is good, and of particular pleasure to me, I had no idea where the relationships and direction of the movie was headed. Essentially, all involved are flawed people. And, upon reflection there's plenty of decisions made by people that don't make sense taking the movie in as a whole story - but which did keep my attention. This did not end at all as I had expected, and that was nice too. If I were to watch again I know several characters and plot holes would annoy me, but for now, I give it a solid 4 to 4.5 stars. I'm sure a critic could really pick this movie apart, but I've seen plenty of Indie and B-grade shows - and this really is a standout. While the ending doesn't leave all right in the world, I was content from and entertainment standpoint, but conflicted for obvious reasons (you'll understand once you've seen it). I'm not accustomed to liking a movie with an ending or at least and ending message I find morally and legally repulsive - but you be the judge of that. I think most people who like thrillers will come away satisfied with this show!",1367280000,3,1937,4.582132564841499

Much like the famous trolley problem from ethics, when the question is asked, given the choice of pulling a leaver to divert an on-coming train saving the lives of five workmen, but killing another on a second track -- the viewer suddenly feels torn when the question is rephrased: would you push the same lone workman into the path of the deadly train to save those same five lives?

This movie was perfect.

It'll be a long time before I forget this movie. One thing you'll not want to do is blink. If you blink you'll miss something. It's not just because the film requires attention and thought, but because it will also dig into every emotion you've ever owned and set them afire.

I replayed the ending four times. I challenge you to do it in fewer.

When the legal system fails to deliver justice, Sean takes to the streets to eliminate evil doers while searching for his mother's killer. Forget Spider-man and Batman. This is who every kid wishes he could be. BOY WONDER drops a real world hero into a real world setting. Sean has no super powers, no costume, no million-dollar mansion... He is just a kid with a punching bag and a personal vendetta on his hands. Director Michael Morrissey creates a somber mood and grimy aesthetic as he places his character in the dark and dangerous streets of downtown Brooklyn. The gritty violence is unyielding as Sean mercilessly beats drug dealers, pimps, and gangsters to the ground, but not before taking plenty of hits, himself. Caleb Steinmeyer is excellent in his first feature role, selling Sean's sad, empty existence with his cold-eyed expressions and restrained performance. He truly becomes the character. BOY WONDER plays on the deeper psychological aspects of what it means to be a hero, and where the line between right and wrong is drawn. It is a must-see for super hero fans, and a surprise hit for the first-time director.

After school classes are over, he spends time in a local police department searching for clues on who may have killed his mother during car jacking may years ago.  The visions of the crime scene seem to be still vivid, even though nearly 10 years went by.

Shawn however, seems to be living a double life.  His desire to bring good to the world tips him over the endge and he starts taking justice into his own hands.  Story stands up because it is easy to accept that someone so young can still be innocenet enough to know what is right an what is wrong.  His sense of morality is still not corrupted by the world of adults where compromises are made when they probably should not be.  To add complexity to the story, we discover that Shawn's father used to be alchoholic.  After death of Shawn's mother, he has given up the habit but the relationship between father and son is still strained.

What I liked about the film is that the story is cleverly made and it will keep audiences on their toes from start to finish.  It is a story about justice, morality and loss of innocence all at once.  I truly enjoyed it.  Young actor playing Shawn gives great performance in this film.",1357084800,,1350,4.461224489795918
4691699,5,B005GLHO48,"""Wonder Boy"" is not your run of the mill movie about a young vigilante hero, like ""Super"" or ""Kick Ass"".  The main character doesn't fight crime because he read comic books, nor is he out stopping bad guys because he is bored with life.  Rather, Sean (Caleb Steinmeyer) is driven to extremes in order to find his mother's killer.

Sean, after witnessing his mother's murder, comes to live in a truce with his father (Bill Sage), a recovering alcoholic, who used to beat Sean and his mother when she was still alive.  His father has changed over the years, as well as apologized, but the damage has been done.

Sean's violence builds up throughout the years until he can no longer contain his anger.  He begins to prowl the streets, unleashing violence on individuals who abuse people weaker than themselves.  For Sean, he sees someone being violently abusive and decides to take a stand where most people would not.  His violence is unique, because Sean seems to absorb enough pain to demonstrate the other person's savagery, and then beat his enemy into a pulp or worse.  He gets no satisfaction from his victories, yet he feels obliged to continue this duty.

Although this film has ties with comic books, premiering at Comic Con, it has no real connection with other comic book films.  Because of the marketing strategy, this film will more than likely draw in comic oriented fans, yet it must be known that this movie has nothing to do with comics, besides writer-director Michael Morrissey's noir lighting and framing.  I watched this film with low expectations; I honestly knew nothing about it, but I was surprised to find a very emotional driven film that works on many different levels.  Although Sean may not always be the most plausible of characters, yet for the length of the film, I was interested in the way things would play out.

I give this film 5 stars.",1353801600,2,1872,4.72

This Batman/Dexter hybrid of sorts gets mired down by an assault of grotesque images and a world utterly devoid of mirth or humor.  Without many moments to take a breath watching this thing, it ultimately culminates into a desensitizing effect.  Moments of levity or humor to give the audience a release is a basic tenant of drama, which BOY WONDER chooses to ignore.  Sean doesn't have an alter-ego, per se, so we're left with an utterly disaffected kid whose pain is at the forefront of his every interaction.  In other words, he's a bit two-dimensional.  As are most of the other characters in this film.  They wear their hideousness on their sleeves.  Not only does this make for boring drama, it's not terribly realistic.  After all, everyone creates masks for themselves.  It's a natural human coping mechanism.  Damaged people must work a little harder at it.  This includes killer pimps and drug dealers and junior vigilantes.  That being said, BOY WONDER is definitely worth a viewing.

Although it shares a similar origin story to many of our favorite superheroes, Boy Wonder is about a kid, Sean, that witnesses his mother get murdered. He is haunted by this memory and decides to hunt down the man that killed his mom. Throughout the story, he'll seek justice for others usually in a violent way (often fist-fighting or shooting). There are other psychological aspects that you begin to notice during the second half of the film when you realize Sean may actually be mentally ill. The ending has some decent twists. The emotional story, the thrilling action, and even the comedy between the cops make this film a great one. The acting was great, and the music really stood out to me. Definitely one of the better films released recently. Is it a pure superhero film? No. Don't expect a huge budget with amazing special effects and mutated villains. This is a realistic film of a young man seeking justice.

""Boy Wonder"" is actually a very dark psychological thriller about a disturbed young man whose life was changed forever by the murder of his mother. Unable to deal with the pain and anger, he unleashes his violent fantasies on criminals and bullies.

The premise may sound like a Batman origin story, but the relationship ends there. There is no ""WHAM POW and the good guys win"" in Boy Wonder, just a self-destructive young man spiraling out of control, immersing himself in violence to deaden the pain. If you like stories with this element of darkness, then Boy Wonder is a must-see.

4691704,3,B005GLHO48,"This is a more true to life version of the many vigilante movies that have been released as of late. I liked the story but didn't find it quite as great as some of these other reviewers.

Here's the scoop. Sean witnessed his mothers brutal death when he was just ten years old. Now he's a withdrawn senior in high school. He studies and gets good grades but doesn't mix with others. He has an arms length relationship with his dad who is an ""on the wagon"" alcoholic. Dad used to beat him and his mother. Sean now spends some evening hours killing people who take advantage of those unable to defend themselves. A feisty female detective takes an interest in him and it leads to an unraveling of things.

I liked the plot line and some of the nifty turns in this movie. The sweet and sour ending was a big surprise to me and rather clever to boot. But it was generally sub-par in execution. Caleb Steinmeyer, as Sean, does a good job as does Bill Sage as his father. But Zulay Henao as the female detective, and pretty much everyone else, was mediocre. Part of it, I think, was the writing. Though I liked much of the plot, the dialogue, I found to be lackluster. It didn't have the zing or music I'm used to seeing in feature films. By some standards there might have been a bit too much coincidence in the story. It bothered me a bit but not enough to write it off. The production values and directing were good. If they had hired a script doctor and a few better names in the acting department, this could have been a much better outing.

8471805,5,B005GLHO48,Not cheesy at all. Makes you feel good when you watch what the kid does to his enemies. He may look like skin and bones but he can put out some serious damage lol. Watch this if you enjoy seeing bullies get wrecked too. Makes you feel good.,1516752000,,240,4.020833333333333
8471806,5,B005GLHO48,Excellent! Engaging. Reminded me that existing is not living. Law isn't justice. Revenge is a better (bitter) dish served cold. Definitely above average thriller/drama. Believable. Naughty/nice twist ending...you decide.,1511308800,,220,6.620689655172414

8471808,5,B005GLHO48,"Who ever wrote this movie, knows the pain of someone taken from them.  When I was little boy, my father was murdered on my birthday.  I know the loss, anger and rage that was portrayed in this movie and it consumed me for decades.  Even know as I write this, I thought I had left the rage and anger far behind, but I can feel a burning ember in my soul after watching this movie.  I am 50, retiring and have no thoughts of revenge but I can assure anyone who see this, what you see as an actor's portrayal, is as real as it gets.",1510272000,,529,3.9622641509433962
8471809,5,B005GLHO48,"A film worth the time to watch.  The 'Boy Wonder' was played exceptionally well.  His look, attitude and quirkiness did so much for his roll.  The ending?  leaves you with a smile, but that's just me and my old black humor.",1507507200,,223,4.365853658536586
