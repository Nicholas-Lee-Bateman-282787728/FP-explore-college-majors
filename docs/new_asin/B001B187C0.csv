Shout Factory is becoming a favorite company of mine. They have also had some releases of Ozzie & Harriet(my favoriet sitcom ever!). I also hope to see them pick up the rights to Dragnet and release the rest of that series. It is also time for Emergency to have another release. Finally, I would love to see the rest of T.J. Hooker released by Shout Factory and have some interviews with the stars of the shows.",1222473600,,569,4.377358490566038
3478994,5,B001B187C0,Im very jazzed that Shout! is releasing s2 of Adam12. Ive got both season 1 and 2 of Ironside and am very happy with those releases although I have to addmit to impatentally wait for Ironside S3 release. The sample video on Shout! website looks promising and the professional reviews of the release place it in solid A range. Adam 12 has been off the air for ota tv re runs in So Cal for years Im really looking forward to seen S2 again commeral free. Hopefully more Adam 12 season releases roll out soon and shout! will get on the stick and release s3 of Ironside too.  PS Ironside fans go to shout! forums and post request for more Adam 12 and Ironside releases I Need More good class tv dvds to watch.,1222387200,,704,4.253731343283582
3478995,5,B001B187C0,"This is so exciting! I was starting to think they'd never release season 2, or any other seasons, for that matter. I'm one of the many young people who enjoyed re-runs of Adam-12 growing up. Also, as a social historian, I find this series to be of great educational value. Pete and Jim tell a tale that all generations of Americans need to hear! This is truly reality television...and I hope it inspires contemporary producers to create QUALITY programming in the future. Those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it. Let's not let Jack Webb's vision and efforts go to waste!",1219968000,5,590,4.628571428571429

3478999,5,B001B187C0,"""1 Adam 12, 1 Adam 12"" Wow!  It has been a long time coming, but it seems that Season Two is on the way.  This show stayed consistently strong throughout its entire run.  If you enjoyed Season One, you will also enjoy Season Two.  I hope they release the entire series of this high quality and highly entertaining police show.  The fact that fantastic shows like this are taken for granted today is more of a reflection on the current state of our society (and its mindless shows) rather than the quality of the programming of these older shows.  Here's hoping we will see the soon release of the remaining seasons of Dragnet and Emergency! on DVD.",1213920000,19,648,4.495726495726496

The piece to hold discs in working.. Have had some broken when I got it. I think people review disc should tell they recorded on both side of disc. Or the recorded on one side of disc. It can't cost that much to record at one side. The volume disc are bought  can't cost that much? Don't worry about log numbers being so far apart. Did not miss anything. Just the way they did it.

Maybe we can get people to telling everyone the disc was burn on both sides. .  Or audio and video stories  burned on one size. It would help others when buying .
Also send comment to seller do no like  both sides of discs used to record show. Use one side only.  Seems like hurting something that  could be great thing.",1453334400,,874,4.064327485380117

With all the unrealistic detective sagas that have dominated TV for the last several decades, I love patrol-based stories that are what the majority of police officers deal with.  The movies and mainstream media barely capture a tiny reality of what law enforcement is really like.  Adam-12, although clearly based in the 1960's and obviously dated in some regards, in many ways is still quite relevant to what street officers handle on a daily basis in 2015!",1448323200,,479,4.888888888888889

3479035,5,B001B187C0,"Adam 12 was the second police show I was introduced to as a young child (Dragnet being the first). It is produced by Jack Web, who also produced and starred in Dragnet.

Adam-12 follows the daily work-lives of two LA policemen, Officers Pete Malloy and Jim Reed, played by Martin Milner and Kent McCord, respectively. Both actors play their roles to perfection, as do the regular supporting cast. Sometimes the guest cast doesn't perform convincingly, but the main actors more than cover up for this deficiency.

In seasons 1 and 2 of the show Malloy is the senior officer and Reed is the trainee. The situations the officers face range from the truly dangerous, to the truly ridiculous, truly bizarre, and  truly mundane.

Over the course of Adam-12's seven-year run we see the gradual transformation of both officers: Pete Malloy goes from being a reluctant trainer to a man who has total trust and genuine affection for his once-trainee partner. Jim Reed  transforms from a very raw rookie on probation, to a full-fledged responsible, and trust-worthy LA Police Officer.

I will not list the episodes in this review, as I believe others will do that.

Many things differentiate this show from current ""cop"" shows: Adam-12 utilizes actual police cases, submitted by genuine police officers, and the advisers to the show are also genuine police officers. The police procedures followed throughout the show were those in place in CA during the late 1960's and mid-1970's. The guns are real, the police cars are real. Also, as in Dragnet, the public is educated about police protocol, and the instruments used in the performance of the officers' duties. The officers also do not go into dangerous situations with out back-up from other officers, and they respect those in authority above them.

On this disc-set a person has the option of viewing the extras that feature a real police training center, and commentary from real police officers on particular episodes.

Regarding the discs, the only complaint I would have is that there are no sub-titles options along with the Closed Captioning. Our television is a TV/VCR/DVD set that has closed captioning only in the VCR and TV settings.

Imagine a realistic police show without profanity, grossness, and nudity, and you have Adam-12.",1424390400,,2285,5.021164021164021

3479050,4,B001B187C0,"LAPD's finest patrolmen return in this 1969-70 Season of this stellar spinoff series of DRAGNET to patrol the streets of L.A. with its seeming never-ending crime-wave in good old Southern California.

This spinoff of DRAGNET series presented actual department-issue badges, vehicles and Los Angeles Police stations, and its compelling realism gave the program a 7-year run on NBC from 1968 to 1975.

This DVD also includes Bonus Features like:

* Commentaries by the members of the LAPD

* Photo History Of The LAPD

Additionally, watching them on DVD complete, uncut, and commercial free is so much better than watching it in reruns with all those deleted scenes for added commercials when ADAM-12 and DRAGNET were on COZI-TV, ME-TV, Antenna TV, and TV Land.
* Ride Along Fact Track

* Tour Of Reed & Malloy s Training Center

* Includes instructions on how to receive a free One Adam-12, One Adam-12 ringtone.

So now I can add ADAM-12's 2nd Season to my DVD collection of DRAGNET, HUNTER, CHiPS, ad of course the rest of my other seasons of DRAGNET too.

BTW, Warner Bros. will be releasing CHiPs-Season 3 out on DVD on March 3, 2015.",1389657600,,1137,4.819587628865979

3479052,5,B001B187C0,"This show represents something which has apparently been lost forever on TV.  It is a fast-moving half-hour program which is NOT a situation comedy.  If it were being produced today, it would surely be a full hour (and much grittier) which would cause it to lose its charm.  Adam-12 is TV's ""COPS"" from an earlier era without showing the cesspool to which our society has degraded.  My wife and I often choose to chill with an episode of Adam-12 just before bed.  It helps us to clear our head from a busy day.  Perfect TV for the entire family.",1386460800,,545,4.454545454545454

Created by Jack Webb this series was accurate and thorough in the controversial topics it tackled.  If you enjoy this, you will enjoy Dragnet and Emergency as well.

The show had a great deal of realism for the time while still being a family program.  There was no graphic violence or sex, but you could clearly understand what happened.
I recommend this show for persons of all ages.  It's a really great way to see just how far we've come, and yet, how little things have changed.",1380672000,,450,4.385542168674699

This was one of the earliest ""gritty"" police shows that illustrated the reality of the beat cop.  The earliest seasons were fairly serious, with some great shots of late '60's LA.  Sometimes it's hard to believe these shows took place over 40 years ago.  Anytime it rains or snows, these shows are a great way to kick back and think about a simpler time in America.",1306627200,,486,4.540229885057471

Here, though, I THOROUGHLY enjoyed the extras, especially the voice-overs comparing then and now. Much to my shock, I found out that some ""mistakes"" that I thought were mistakes in filming were really the way LAPD did things back then!! The historical slide shows were interesting, and the lack of scratches, ""splooshes,"" and other yuckiness in the reproduction of the set is most appreciated too.

Unlike my usual DVD reviews, I can't comment on the quality of the closed captions because I don't have a cc chip, but, if they're of even half the quality of the workmanship of the rest of the set, they must be at least acceptable.

I can't wait for the rest of the seasons to get here!",1285113600,,804,4.576388888888889

3479070,4,B001B187C0,"I used to think this was a family program, but I was surprised to find adult issues in these episodes (rape, child molesting). Perhaps these topics were over my head when I watched this series as a boy. And, the issues are handled in a much more guarded and appropriate way than current TV.

Though they are a little slower moving than current TV, the episodes have stood up well over time. That is, of course, with the exception the vintage vehicles and the police uniforms. To me, the old cars are a plus, as I enjoy watching them in action. The uniforms make the officers look a little stiff at times, but one can't help but wonder if society has lost something--the crisp appearance makes the officers look all that more credible and trustworthy.",1252713600,,750,4.555555555555555

3479072,5,B001B187C0,"Season Two of Adam-12 brings more of the great campy cop drama viewers have come to expect from Jack Webb.
This set is superior to the Season One set in that it uses single-sided discs and has a few bonus extras.
The acting, scripts and production values are fair (I rate them C, maybe C+) but, as with Season One, the camp value is high.
Have fun spotting how many different angles the same Universal backlot sets can be filmed from.
Enjoy the repeated stock footage shots of late-60's LA.
Count how many times Kent McCord picks up the two-way radio's microphone and says ""One Adam-12 roger"".
Be amazed about how creepy Bing Crosby's son Gary is as Officer Wells.
Wonder why every license plate starts with ""Lincoln, X-Ray, Ida"".
Anyway, I really liked this set and am looking forward to seeing Season Three.",1250899200,,809,4.625
3479073,5,B001B187C0,"Adam-12 was a show that revolutionized how all dramatic police shows were to be written proceeding this series. Jack Webb took the factual material from Dragnet and created the first patrolman show that featured real procedures in use to this day. In a sense, he created the first ""COPS"". Following the first season, the second of seven seasons has the same excitement, with a few surprising cameos such as Bill Mumy (Eddie Munster). Adam-12 is a show that can be enjoyed by the whole family, and doesn't contain the brutal violence and smutty sexual situations you get out of modern day shows. I would suggest this show to anyone looking to watch some good stories.",1250380800,4,666,4.8

3479086,5,B001B187C0,"Great TV show and my absolute favorite. This came us just before I went into the Army and then onto Vietnam, but I never forgot the series. I has always liked Jack Webb in anything and being and adopted member of the LAPD he had all the inside info on how the department ran and what invetigations he had access to. This inspired me to go onto a 28 year police career in upstate NY, retiring in 1999 as a Sergeant. Although I held ranks as an Investigator, SGT. LT and Chief of Police in two local departments. But I liked my supervisors job the best and that's what I went back to the last five years of my career. No regrets, it was my favorite rank just like Sgt. McDonald on the TV Series.

3479087,5,B001B187C0,"Very good release of Adam-12's second season. I can't believe that after three years season two has finally been released. Too bad Shout Factory didn't release season one. The release of season one by Universal had cheap double-sided discs that were full of problems. I had to return my season one set three times and I still have problems with the set that I ended up with. The transfers were good, but the discs themselves had many problems. Enough talk of season one. This is about season two, right? This is a handsomely packaged, four disc set. All single-sided discs housed in two thin slipcases. I had no problems with any of the discs. Thanks for the extras, but can't someone get Marty and Kent for any sort of commentary or interview? I'm not complaining, but since both guys are still around one would think they'd be asked to contribute something. The season itself is great and I thoroughly enjoyed every episode. This is the season Reed and his wife have their baby. The boys have lots of adventures and all of the episodes are good. Highly recommended! Hopefully it won't take another three years for season three.",1223164800,14,1129,4.707070707070707
3479088,4,B001B187C0,"I suppose I could start off with the bad news.. Now I know this is 1969 and TV was a bit different in this era but I must say, the casting of many of the people Jim and Pete interact with are simply not credible. Thats a nice way to say; they can't act... however they can OVER act, and do it well. The same went for the first season which seemed a bit worse in this regard and I so hoped season 2 would be different but alas it isn't.

Now since I've got that off my chest let me just say I love these guys! The two leads in character, Jim Reed and Pete Malloy just gel. They just do. I LOVE to hear the banter of married life versus bachelorhood and the various other topics they square off about. I love Malloys no nonsense demeanor and Reeds (seemingly!) cool collected innocence (see; Baby!). I really like how the show has some loose threads going that get picked up and dropped from time to time, shows a real forward thinking in the writing department.

All in all, SHOUT! Factory is to be given major props for just getting this great show out the door, nevermind that transfers are BRILLIANT and while the extras are a bit tepid, they are there for a rainy day when Season Three is still on the drawing board... throw in handsome artwork and a meager price tag and you have a winner. And praise be NO FLIPPER discs! No not the dolphin, the discs that Universal thrust upon so many ruined boxsets (Dragnet, Quincy, A Team..)

I don't know if anyone else noticed this but in the episode A Sound Like Thunder, blondie Pete Malloy is wearing a decidedly GOLD shirt, and black haired Reed is wearing a strikingly Blue shirt. Know of any other 1969 duo who matches those exact colors and descriptions? I'll let the jury decide that:)",1222905600,5,1737,4.3058103975535165

Its very family friendly, the bad language is kept to a minimal, and the show keeps moving along at a good pace. The acting is well done, and as you keep watching Adam-12 their characters develop more and you get a better sense of what everyones like.

I really enjoy how theres a little plot to every episode. For example, Jim Reed keeps telling a joke which keeps getting interrupted because of the next emergency or situation that has to be handled. Or since Pete Malloys a bachelor, he has to be convinced to get a date for some event they're going to.
