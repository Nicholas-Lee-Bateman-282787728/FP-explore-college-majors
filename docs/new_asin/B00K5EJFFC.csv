But I honestly think that they should make everyone thinking about having an abortion watch this movie first.  It is about numerous people who were conceived through rape but rather than their mother's aborting them, they chose to put them up for adoption. Once they found out how they were conceived they were eternally grateful to their birth mothers for having given them life. It also interviews some women who aborted babies that were conceived in rape.  The abortion did not help them get on with their lives nor did they help them to forget the trauma of the rape. Instead, they only made things worse. After the abortion they not only had to deal with the horror of what happened to them but they  also had to deal with feeling guilty for having ended the innocent  child's life.  It is a really great movie and everyone, including, parents whould watch it.",1428624000,,1007,4.725714285714286
8655980,5,B00K5EJFFC,"This is an AMAZING video that presents a powerful argument against the position that abortion is justified in the case of rape.

As one woman put it, ""I thought, 'Why should my baby get the death sentence of abortion when the rapist only gets jail time?'""

Another woman asks the abortion doctor if killing the baby will take away the memory of her rape. The doctor said, ""No..."" She said, ""Then I see no point in killing a child just because I was raped. It's not the child's fault...""

There are many more great arguments from woman who were actually raped and chose life! I honestly can think of no reason now why abortion should be legal. The video makes that powerful of an argument!
