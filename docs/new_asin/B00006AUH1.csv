1739304,5,B00006AUH1,FINALLY THE TRUTH HAS BEEN EXPOSED!!! As an aspiring Black (film) history teacher I will definitely use this documentary in my teachings.,1185148800,,137,5.2727272727272725
1739305,5,B00006AUH1,"i showed it to my students and it was a hit.  all but one thought that it was great.  that one said, ""it's not true because the bible doesn't say any of that.""  well, forget him and focus on the genetics and the travels of the people.  this is a great addition to ""The Journey of Man"", another wonderful genetic tracing of our species but looking at it through the male.  I highly recommend it to anyone interested in our true beginnings.",1177891200,,438,4.2926829268292686
1739306,4,B00006AUH1,"This film conveys an important bit of information, however I had to watch the film quite a few times to fully grasp it.  It traces the genetic path back 150,000 years ago to a single woman.  However, it is not the HUMAN DNA that is traced, but rather the DNA of the mitochondia that live in our cells.  The film never explains what mitochondia are, much less anything about the genetic markers.  Frustrating.  The film also suggests that humans left Africa through a SOUTHERN route rather than a northern one.  However every time they mentioned this, they showed an unmarked map with an arrow pointed NORTHWARD. Frustrating. I would have given it 5 stars because I was so grateful to learn these things, but since I had to constantly repeat sections and consult an atlas and biology text, I give it 4 stars.",1165104000,,807,4.608391608391608
1739307,2,B00006AUH1,"The basic thesis is fascinating and very convincing; and not only because, in its broadest outline, actually very simple. With more data the story will surely become more complicated and perhaps less susceptible to documentary treatment. This is why I found 'The Real Eve' something of a disappointment.

Perhaps on the assumption that the audience would not be able to follow the science, we are treated to a very extended infomercial complete with gravel voiced commentary, kaleidoscopic special effects and rather corny dramatic reconstructions of fatal confrontations between rival stone-age humans. But this is an idea which doesn't need to be 'sold', just explained; and a lay audience doesn't need to be beguiled, merely informed.

Read the book: in 'The Real Eve: Modern Man's Journey Out of Africa' (published in the UK as 'Out of Eden'), Stephen Oppenheimer tells the same basic story with much greater clarity much more convincingly.",1142121600,13,944,5.286666666666667
1739308,5,B00006AUH1,"This documentary is one of the best produced documentaries I've ever seen.  Not only is it facinating and incredibly researched, but the music in it elevates the subject matter to profound levels.",1141948800,,196,5.125
1739309,5,B00006AUH1,"About a hundred thousand years ago, in a small part of sub-Saharan Africa, a small number of a an endangered specie ""embarked"" on a great journey of all times. A journey that dwarfs Columbian's and Magellan's in its length and duration.

 Of course they had no idea where they'd go, but they had to go somewhere to survive. Being nomads, ancient tribes often moved less than a mile a year, just enough to survive and reproduce.

Within hundreds and thousands of generation Humans reached almost every major land body on the earth, and as they traveled north their skin got lighter in order to allow more of the scarce sunlight penetrate their skin and synthesize vitamin D. Of course that didn't' occurred in a Lamarckian way, rather the offspring living in the north with the gene coding for less melatonin in their skin synthesized more vitamin D, gained health and reproductive advantage and passed more of that gene to his offspring. Within 20,000 years or about one thousand generation, the skin lighted dramatically in the Northerners who were all descendents of black African.

Now would anyone after watching this movie hint that somehow Sociobiology and its adaptation theories are racist ? Far from it, we need sociobiology with its adaptation theories and  new findings in genetics to show bigots once for all that we are all descended from the same lineage and any differences in color we might have are only skin deep.",1137542400,6,1431,4.872427983539095
1739310,2,B00006AUH1,"If I had been able to listen to this CD first, I would not have purchased it. Much (too much) of the narration is obliterated by the way-too-loud background music (or, in the case of this CD, foreground music). I would have liked to have heard ALL of what the narrator and guest speakers had to say.",1122595200,2,299,4.2631578947368425
1739311,4,B00006AUH1,I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD. I had seen the program on the Discovery Channel and could not wait to own it. I believe that the makers of this film did a wonderful job of presenting the theory of mitochondrial Eve to the common man. As a future educator I plan on using this film as a teaching resource to illustrate to students one theory of the origin of modern man and their spread out of Africa to the rest of the world. Even if someone does not believe the theory presented in this film it holds its own as entertainment as well as a piece of informative media.,1098230400,14,566,4.25
1739312,5,B00006AUH1,"I highly recommend this work!!! Two-thumbs up. It's possibly the best piece of work on the genealogy and evolution of humans I have seen in my lifetime. By researching and explaining the migration of modern humans from Africa throughout the rest of the world the research completely challenges our whole notion of RACE since it proves that we are all related somehow -- every single person on the planet can trace at least part of their mitochondrial DNA back to one small group of ancestors in Africa.  At first it was hard to believe that someone who is phenotypically European or Asian could descend from someone who is African but the film does a solid job of using cinematography to recreate and explain the evolution of man over thousands of years. The use of indigenous people in the film from Eastern Africans to the Samang in Malaysia was brilliant. The director and producer make the events so real that you feel like you are there when it is actually happening. Danny Glover was a great choice to narrarate the film. One of the highlights of the film was when scientists randomly tested the DNA of 6 ethnically diverse Americans in Chicago and were able to link a Greek emigre and a Cree, Native American man by a common ancestor that existed 30,000 yrs ago using genetic markers. At no other time in the history of man have we had the scientific know-how to do this and DNA is 99.9%  reliable evidence. I would love to see a sequel to the film that explores further the notion of this global expansion and evolution. How did changes in hair texture, culture, and languages come about over time as our ancestors migrated from one continent or country to another? I would also like them to interview people who've had their DNA tested -- like what it revealed and how it impacted their lives.",1048896000,43,1802,4.628125
1739340,5,B00006AUH1,"As a female this dvd offered answers to a lot of unanswered views, points of opinion, and hope.",1409184000,,95,4.333333333333333
1739341,5,B00006AUH1,I absolutely enjoyed it.  an overview of the settlement of the world.,1408838400,,69,4.75
1739342,5,B00006AUH1,I like the way they did this documentary.  Good information and well done. But I did not care for the ending.,1396396800,,109,4.190476190476191
1739343,5,B00006AUH1,"The story of all of us coming ""out of Africa."" This ""Eve"" is the one woman whose mitochondrial DNA survived all the way down to the present. She is Eve only in that sense. There were many other women before her and many with her in her time. All of the others (of the group which left Africa, not those who never did) had their female line die out. This is transferred from mother to child so the boy children do not pass it on to their children, only the girl children do. Every time a woman has no girl children (either all boys or no children at all), her Mitochondrial line dies out. Eventually one line alone survived. That is what is traced back to this ""Real Eve."" It is the story of the travels of all of the off-spring that make up the dvd. Each time you watch it you will get something more from it.",1392163200,,809,4.1265822784810124
1739344,5,B00006AUH1,I enjoyed this story because it brought a new way of thought to how many of us became to became who we are.  Bloodlines tell a bigger story then I ever knew. Informative and educational.,1389916800,,186,4.314285714285714
1739345,5,B00006AUH1,"If you want to know where the first people are from, please take a look at the detailed documentary of the migration of African people over time from Africa and how evolution and climate changes created other groups of people.",1388361600,,226,4.675
1739346,5,B00006AUH1,"When this production first was aired I recorded it on VHS Tape and I gave it to a friend who never gave it back! the drama, cinematography and even moreso the information with pen-point tracing of the migrations and adaptations of Man and his ""Kind"" to climatic change throughout the world is epic...A lot of what's being pointed out within this production to this day is confirmed by the blowing sands of time through Archeology and Anthropology. The ""real"" inturpeting of the mythos of antiquity confirms that we are much more ancient than Western Academia claims this includes the Western Biblical Lore...I'm sharing it with those who are open minded and wish to learn and grow. The Ethiopian Riff Valley and the ""Out of Africa"" is the under current fact of our origins.",1373241600,2,773,4.819548872180451
1739347,3,B00006AUH1,"This product was purchased as an adjunct to a NOVA series entitled, ""Becoming Human."" A comparison may be unfair, considering the excellence of NOVA productions, but the difference is very noticeable. Music is distracting, even offensive in places, and many times too loud. Special effects look like time padding. Danny Glover is a fine actor, but he doesn't suit this subject. Not authoritative enough and voice is not like his usual. Most interesting is the information on coastal migration, and this is additive to the NOVA series, and makes that part valuable to students of the migratory patterns of our ancestors.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Real-Eve-5-Billion-People-From-One-Woman-Discovery-Channel-VHS/dp/B00006AUKZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Real Eve: 5 Billion People From One Woman (Discovery Channel) [VHS</a>]",1283731200,,872,6.591304347826087
1739348,5,B00006AUH1,The Real Eve is a gem because the narrator (Danny Glover) discusses anthropological and biological concepts and discoveries in an easy to understand manner without resorting to condescending platitudes or preaching. After seeing it there is no other logical conclusion but to believe the only important race among Homo Sapiens is the human race itself.,1243209600,,352,5.418181818181818
1739349,4,B00006AUH1,"I think the script could have been shortened and/or revised a bit.  The film makers seemed to concentrate a great deal on the first migrations out of Africa, and then seemed to hurry through the rest of the migration splits.  The European split seemed to warrant the least time.  It also was a bit of an irritant to me that the film was about mitochondrial DNA and yet most of the dramatizations (especially once the migrations left Africa) were about men.  Yes, I know men carry mtdna, but it is the females, not the males, who give it to their offspring.  Therefore, it is the females who have ""spread it around the world"", not the men.

This is a very good introduction to mitochondrial dna and female population genetics.  Much has been learned since this was originally been released and I hope for another film or films that can drill down further into the various halplogroups and their migrations.

By the way, if Amazon seems is out of stock on this, you may wish to check the Discovery channel site.",1206748800,,1009,4.566666666666666

7966541,5,B00006AUH1,"Another of the very best films describing early human life. At it;s heart is the concept every one on earth is related to one woman who lived in Africa over 100,000 years ago.
