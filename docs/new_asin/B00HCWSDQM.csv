6153960,2,B00HCWSDQM,"Might have been an amazing flick based on the smart storytelling and unique characters, but I couldn't hear half of what was said, even when played on a BluRay player and using flat screen stereo sound turned all the way up. The audio on this is awful. It's like only half of the characters are miked in multiple character scenes. This wouldn't have been so bad if there had been subtitles offered, but there aren't. This works best if you're going to watch it on your computer, with headphones, or if you have a sound system connected to your TV. It's how I'll give this another shot after turning it off midway through, disgusted by the audio issues.",1406678400,3,652,4.533898305084746
6153961,5,B00HCWSDQM,"Progressive, positive, enlightening, and memorable. It was great to see the unrepresented side and positive portrayal of the black community.",1395792000,,141,6.1
6153962,5,B00HCWSDQM,Check out the trailers on youtube.  This movie truly surprised me.  I purchased it to support an actor and it ended up being one of the year's favorites.  The messages go beyond love and relationship to believing in yourself and dare to follow your dreams.  VERY WELL DONE!  This movie is IMPORTANT and EDUCATIONAL and ENTERTAINING.,1395100800,2,332,4.857142857142857

8631572,4,B00HCWSDQM,"I agree that this is one of the better African American films available on Prime. Still, I felt like there were some questions unanswered in the film, such as why all of them were hanging out on a first date and talking as though they all knew each other. That felt a little forced since not all of them were directly connected.
I liked how the film centered on successful young black people who couldn't be boxed in by stereotypes -- most of the films that explore romance ignore us. Overall, I would recommend it.",1520640000,,515,4.431578947368421
