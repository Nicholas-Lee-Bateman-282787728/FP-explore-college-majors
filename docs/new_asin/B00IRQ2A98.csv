Red Ryder talks to homesteaders about good land for $2 an acre in Paradise Valley. But water is plentiful in winter but dries up in summer. Red says a dam can be built to store water. One man objects to this plan, they vote on it. There is a fire that threatens the land. Is it arson? Men work to beat out the fire. There are gunshots, who is firing at Red? Little Beaver tells about lost water from the dam. Men plot to steal the lands of Paradise Valley and the water rights. There is enough water as long as it isn't wasted. What if someone steals water at night? Red investigates and discovers the loss. The next day Blaine visits Red Ryder and asks him to write a column. But Red isn't a writer.

Water flows through a shallow channel for the people again. Blaine and Associates Indicted says the headline, the Court decided in favor of the ranchers. Isnt that swell?

Red Ryder began as a newspaper comic strip in the late 1930's and lasted until 1964. Many comic strips from that time are also gone. The Johnson County War in 1892 Wyoming inspired many stories where a big corporation tried to swindle people out of their homesteads so they could be taken by the big corporation. This story is different as they use water rights instead of gunmen to drive people away.",1511049600,,2581,4.370833333333334
