1657804,2,B00005RRJI,"""Come Undone"" presents itself as a coming-of-age Gay film about a young man, Matthieu (Jeremie Elkaim) finding love with another man, Cedric (Stephane Lifshitz) during a Summer vacation at the seashore. And even though Matthieu and Cedric's families accept their homosexuality...Matthieu, the youngest and least experienced of the two, is obviously torn and tormented.  But why? The scenes between Matthieu and Cedric are breathtaking in their innocence and sexual candor and both seem to be enjoying every minute of it.  In fact, Matthieu gives himself to Cedric freely and seemingly without regret.
The director, Sebastien Lifshitz attempts to cover his lack of narrative focus and expertise by flipping between the present, the past and the near past which obstensibly gives his film the patina of an ""important, complex film."" It doesn't work though, because what is more importantly missing are answers to some basic plot questions: Why have Cedric and Matthieu broken up and What happened to Matthieu to land him in a (I think) psychiatric hospital?
Without answers to these questions we are left puzzled and frankly a little miffed; mostly because the skimpy mise en scene cannot support the plot without these answers.
Lifshitz obviously feels that leaving great gaping holes in the narrative gives his film the jazzy, devil-may-care attitude of the ""Nouvelle Vague."" But Godard he ain't...and ""Come Undone,"" which starts out as a light-hearted, passionate and positive  gay film, turns into a incoherent and unruly cautionary tale of gay panic.",1016496000,11,1553,5.330612244897959
1657805,4,B00005RRJI,"This film is an honest portrayal of two young lovers whose burgeoning romance becomes strained and eventually fails as Mathieu, the story's focus, deals with both his mother, who suffers from depression, and his suspicious and bitter sister.  Told in flashbacks the story reveals the path of the two young men in spotty detail, leaving many things unanswered, allowing you, the viewer to fill in details of the events that occur.  I've liked Stephane Rideau since I first saw him in ""Wild Reeds"" and I think he is equally as compelling in this film.  Jeremie Elkaim is very good as well and I hope to see him in future films.  I think this is a dvd worth owning.",1013212800,8,662,4.584745762711864
1657806,5,B00005RRJI,"Having been a long-time fan of Stephane Rideau, I must say that this is his best film to date!  For those of you who have had the pleasure of seeing ""Wild Reeds"", you're in for a treat.
In comparing the two films, I would have to say that this one is much more ""viewer-friendly"" and much easier to follow.  I have heard that many people saw this film during it's theatre run solely for the nude scenes and play between the two lead characters... what a shame.  There is MUCH, MUCH more to this film than meets the eye.  Highly recommended.",1012780800,6,539,4.306930693069307
1657807,5,B00005RRJI,"Ultimately a story about grief, this beautiful movie appears to recount a simple story of summer love between two handsome young lovers, Mathieu and Cedric, who meet on the beaches of Brittany while Mathieu's mother convalesces there. Signalling the complex dynamics of Mathieu's relationship to his family, the story is not told sequentially but rather through shifting flashbacks.  While some may find the subtle style and unanswered questions raised disconcerting, the success in telling this story may be measured by how deeply we feel for the characters portrayed.",1010880000,7,569,5.465909090909091

1657814,3,B00005RRJI,"""Come undone"" or precisely translated ""ALmost nothing"" is a story about a summer love between two young lads. One of them just discovers his homosexuality (Mathieu), the other is more experienced and concious what his needs are (Cedric). The background story focuses on Mathieu's mother who tries to recover from depression after she lost her little baby.
What is quite unusual in this film is that the director decided to mix three different time frames, which, the decision, makes the film difficult to follow.
There are too many questions left not answered. Why Mathieu wanted to commit a suicide? Was it a suicide attempt or not? What went wrong with those two?
Unfortunately the end of the film is far from being clear as well. Nobody knows why and what for Mathieu decides to meet Pierre (Cedric's ex-bf) and what will be the outcome. Are these two ment to be together?
Apart from slow screenplay with some vague moments, ""Presque rien"" is a well acted film. Both J.Elkaim and S.Rideau (check his part in ""Le clan"") created characters in full dimension.
Two other facts: the film incl. a funny, but dirty version of the hit song ""Libertine"" (Kate Ryan or M.Farmer) and very hot sex-scene.",1337040000,,1194,4.829268292682927
1657815,4,B00005RRJI,"Director Sbastien Lifshitz trusts in incomplete junctures, ruptured times and constant flashbacks to create a narrative line that encircles the most significant moments in the life of Mathieu, the protagonist. Without following habitual guidelines, the story begins a couple of years after the main events of the film, and through long flashbacks the viewers understand that Mathieu is hurtfully unraveling and that his boyfriend Cdric has already been confined to the past.

At the very beginning of the film we learn that Mathieu has attempted to commit suicide, that he has no intention of continuing his relationship with Cdric and that, in spite of it all, once he leaves the hospital he will visit the beach in which the two of them met for the first time.

But how exactly was that first encounter? The first flashback scenes are somehow cold and neutral, they follow the protagonist like in a documentary, without providing the audience with cause of concern or any real emotional binding: Summer is reduced to tediousness, to a routine in which the camera is fixated on Mathieu's daily affairs, we understand that besides swimming in the sea, smoking in his bedroom and jerking off in the bathroom there is not much going on in his life. When Mathieu is lying on the sand, the presence of another boy distracts him. After perusing each other at the beach, the two teenagers finally find the courage to meet. For Mathieu, this is his first homosexual experience, for Cdric (interpreted by Stphane Rideau, a most influential figure in contemporary French gay cinema) it isn't.

There is an intense passion between these two youngsters. As they start spending more and more time together, and as things quickly progress into the realms of sex, soon Mathieu's relatives become suspicious. Mathieu's mother is deeply depressed and her son doesn't want to upset her by coming out of the closet. His sister, however, knows exactly what's going on from the beginning.

If there is something singular in Lifshitz's treatment of gay characters is how natural it's for them to be faithful to their true nature. Here accepting homosexuality is never a big deal, revelations are never a dramatic scene and they never involve crying or excruciatingly painful dialogs. The real drama comes from the lack of a paternal figure, id est, the lack of fatherly authority. With a depressed mother that lives in a world of her own as a consequence of the pills she takes, and the complete absence of the father, Mathieu is free to do as he pleases. But he's never truly free, for freedom actually means an emancipation from fatherly figures, and such emancipation can never be possible if there are no fathers at all.

For Jacques Lacan the 'nom de pere' was the law of the father; even when a single mother is raising her child, she will be able to summon the name of the father and invest herself with an authority that comes from that tautological figure that does not need to explain or justify, that needs only to say 'no because I say so'. Clearly Mathieu has an unresolved conflict with the man he never sees, the man that has also abandoned her mother when she needed him the most. Oh sure, he's working hard to provide for the family, and that seems to excuse him. But when Mathieu tells the truth about himself to everyone, he has no intentions of sharing that intimate admission with his father. If the father is absent, there is no authority, and because of that, Mathieu is confused.

Cdric has a father but his relationship with him is distant. He's independent, and since his independence came at a great price, he has been able to surmount the need to obtain his father's approval; in fact, family is something he no longer craves for. When Mathieu and Cdric decide to live together in Nantes, all family ties are severed at once. But the unresolved Oedipal conflict will gravely distress Mathieu.

The nonexistence of the father can be designated as a structural emptiness that would preserve the function of desire. For the neurotic, the 'lack' is commonly occupied by the demand, which on one hand protects against the enigma of the Other's desire, while at the same time preserves the 'emptiness' that is necessary for the function of desire -of course at the expense of dissatisfaction; after all every demand (which is always constituted by signifiers) is a false demand, a deceiving one (of course, it is the subject himself the first to be mislead). Cdric demands the unceasing presence of Mathieu but he does not ask kindly for it; Mathieu's original plans were to return to Paris, but faces now a disjunctive, if he obeys the demand he will only get dissatisfied but if he doesn't his relationship fails and the emptiness reappears. This demand cannot be satisfied as it echoes the emergence of the subject through the signifier: the function of the signifier requires the effacement of its own traces. In this case, the motivation to move to Nantes should have come from Mathieu and not from Cedric.

After many flashbacks and prolepsis, we come to a moment in time in which everything else has been left behind. Some might say that this is a glimmer of hope as Mathieu might find another companion in Pierre (yet another fatherless individual). But if there is one final fundamental revelation is how the two young men are preoccupied as they see a child playing alone in the beach until they realize the father is in a car nearby. Whether we want it or not, fathers still play an important role in our lives and in the way in which we define ourselves; accepting them or opposing them, they are still the authority that we follow or defy, and without that authority, existential doubts might render us motionless.",1318118400,2,5728,4.808121827411168
1657816,3,B00005RRJI,"It's hard reviewing this film without giving too much away, but I'll do my best.  Despite being disappointed, this wasn't a bad movie.  The story kept me interested through out and yes, the guys were very hot :) One of the  biggest complaints I've seen about this movie is that the shift between different times is confusing.  However, it really isn't bad once you realize what is going on, although I will admit going into the movie knowing time while shift around helps.  Basically, there are 3 different time periods, and while the the 2nd part is connected to the 3rd, the first is disconnected.  This doesn't sound too bad except that the whole move has been leading towards this climatic part and then it is never shown.  This is purposely done by the director but honestly this is what makes the movie such a let down.  I understood what the director was going for but it left so many questions that it made an otherwise decent movie unsatisfying.",1307491200,,954,4.603550295857988
1657817,5,B00005RRJI,"This is such a subtle and beautiful film, and subtlety is something I really appreciate in French films. The story doesn't slap you up along side the head with MEANING. There's a lot of important symbolism that helps in understanding Mathieu. Water plays a key role in this, as does the darkness. His family mirrors the emotional fragility inherent in him - it's not about being gay, it's about being human and the things all of us try to hide from ourselves and others because it's easier somehow. The nudity is not gratuitous, and frankly it's not something that would stand out to a European. The scene on the beach is important, it shows just how much C&eacute;dric is feeling Mathieu in every way, so connected and so into what he's experiencing along with him, and then in the next scene is Mathieu's revelation of his true feelings, so unintentional, so unknown even to himself. My feeling is that if you're looking to label this as porn, you can find a way to do that; if you're looking to classify this as another emotionally unsatisfying portrayal of gay relationships, you can do that, too. But it you immerse yourself in the pace, in the quietness of the story and in all of the ways that seemingly meaningless things interlock to create a very palpable, very solid story, perhaps the true nature will stand out.",1299369600,2,1324,4.662393162393163
1657818,5,B00005RRJI,"For some reason I've been watching gay movies lately, and I've been surprised at how good some of them are, but this is the best so far.

I don't have much to add to the generally excellent five-star reviews already written about this perfect gem of a movie. It is beautifully written, filmed and directed, brilliantly acted (especially by Jrmie Elkam, the most compelling, naturally gifted actor I've ever seen. But everybody in it is great), and a delight to follow on its quiet, bittersweet, non-linear way through Mathieu's story. I've watched it six or seven times so far, and it gets better every time. I'm even getting interested in France and the French people and language for the first time in my life.

I will add one thing: This movie satisfies better than any other I can remember one of my key tests of a good movie. That test is whether I forget I'm watching a movie. If the characters and what they do seem so real to me, and I care so much about them that I forget I'm watching a movie, I figure it's pretty good. This is the only movie I can think of that seems so real that even when I deliberately remind myself that it's not real, I forget almost immediately.",1229817600,,1180,4.433179723502304
1657819,4,B00005RRJI,"I'd say that if all the complicated pieces of the gay lifestyle and society's opinions of it were peeled away, this movie represents what is typically found in a few different cases of boys facing their coming of age as homosexuals.  It is simple and focused with symbolism and metaphor...and the fact that it takes place at the beach is extremely helpful in order to relax the mind into a heightened sense of the situation at hand.

Whether a man is inclined towards his family or not...whether he can nurture other living things or simply coach them at the gym or rile at a party, these are the different types of men that attract one another for various reasons.  It isn't suprising how and why we (gays and straights) ultimately find the one we are looking for...and this movie shows you a newbie in his early transitions and learning experiences that will provide him answers to begin the next chapters of his life.",1220486400,2,920,4.631901840490798
1657820,4,B00005RRJI,"I love ""Wild Reeds"" so much that I got this DVD as well because of the same actor, Stephane Rideau(Cedric). The first thing that I realized was the other guy, Jeremie Elkaim(Mathieu) was a much better looking guy than the way he looked on the cover. Then they met on the beach and Cedric stalked Mathieu. I thought it could be a better way. The darkess, low keyness and slow pace of this film did not bother me much as I like slow developing artie films. However, this movie is lacking too many things even Though I like films with a subtle taste. And the back & forth structure is definitey confusing especially because we are not informed about what exactly happened between the past and the presence. Then the character development of Cedric is almost none existing, he is just a cute dumb beefcake. He has a dark past, but we really cannot tell if he has any sort of emotional struggle about it and how it effects him. Speaking of emotional struggle, we can not tell if they have any of those things between them either, except a few of little cute fights. Some previous poster pointed out the scene of the ruin and stated that it explained how different they were. Mathieu was intellectualy interested in the ruin and Cedric did not care about it and he just wanted to have a physical fun. But I do not think that was enough and also it was quite silly to me. Why did Mathieu have to refuse Cedric's affection because he was intellectual or he was not in the mood for that? I would not if I love someone so much. If he could not accept his lover's affection, I wanted to know more about why. And other characters, Mathieu's depressed mother, her care taker and his jealous sister, I thought they would interrupt boys' relationship in some unplesant way, but nothing like that happened besides mother was concerned about her son's future. Then the biggest ""Huh"" moment was the ending, I thought there would be some sort of description or explanation about what happend between Mathieu and Cedric, but again nothing much. What was the reason of his big depression???  I guess the director tried to make an artie and very subtle movie but it still needed much more than this. Audiences want to relate themselves to the characters and in order to do so they need to be fed more informations about details of characters' emothional states and the reasons of them even if they are in very subtle ways. After all, this director is not Andre Tecine. ""Come Undone"" deserves only two or three stars as a movie, which mainly comes from beautiful cinematography, but I give four stars because I enjoyed the attractiveness of those boys. I do not think I wasted my money, but I can not recommend this to anyone if that is not their taste or that is not enough for them. Yes, this is the artie eye candy.",1206835200,3,2795,4.501968503937008
1657821,3,B00005RRJI,"When I read though two dozen or so of the reviews of ""Come Undone,"" I wondered if I had seen the same film as practically everyone else. Maybe I was just having a bad night or I missed something major while reading the subtitles. I found the film slow, at times confusing and difficult to follow. Much of it is shot in almost total darkness.

On a positive note, the two main characters (Jeremie Elkaim as Mathieu and Stephane Rideau as Cedric) are attractive and have a believable chemistry between them. The music is quite beautiful and there are some engaging beach scenes. A story about first love appeals to most of us. But the movie ultimately is disappointing and one I would not watch again.",1191369600,,699,4.5476190476190474
1657822,4,B00005RRJI,"'Come Undone' is a special film which puts together the coming together of two young men as lovers, with the inescapable trajectories of their own family histories. Sometimes sex and even love are not enough to overcome the fact that one's family is disintegrating, and you have lost your way in terms of working out a future. Stephane Rideau is as marvellous as he was in 'Wild Reeds' (surely that film needs re-release on DVD). 'Come Undone' has high production values and is intellectually challenging as the audience tries to work out what leads to the suicide attempt. At the same time there are great and engaging scenes of sex and love. This film works very well.",1181174400,4,670,4.735042735042735
1657823,5,B00005RRJI,"It was only after the 2nd viewing that I came to realize how much I really loved this film. It essentially has 3 timelines and they all interchange, with no real defining of when the timeline has shifted. It takes a couple of minutes before you realize that you're looking at Mathieu dealing with depression, looking at Mathieu on the beach with Cedric, or looking at Mathieu getting to the point of dealing with his depression. You must pay attention or else you'll be confused. After getting used to the format, I was able to enjoy it much more, especially the 2nd time through.

The majority of the story deals with Mathieu and his first gay affair with Cedric while on vacation. The realization of sexuality isn't portrayed with the typical anguish or guilt and revulsion; it's simply a realization. There are seemingly extraneous issues, Mathieu's mother and her depression and his revoltingly oppressive sister, but those issues become important when we witness Mathieu's own mental breakdown. Was it because of Cedric, Mathieu's dysfunctional family, the pain of coming out? If you're looking for answers, don't, because you won't get any. The story doesn't really have an end; the viewer is left to wonder about so many things and come to their own conclusions.

For Americans, this is a very frustrating exercise because we expect stories with beginnings, middles, and ends. A haunting soundtrack and amazing cinematography enhance. Both actors in the lead roles are gorgeous; but, beware, there is quite a bit of graphic nudity and one really full-on sex scene. If you let go of convention, you can love the movie for what it is, an unconventional study of an intense and consuming relationship.",1171065600,12,1705,4.958041958041958
1657824,5,B00005RRJI,"'Presque Rien' ('Come Undone') is an earlier work by the inordinately gifted writer/ director S&eacute;bastien Lifshitz (with the collaboration of writer St&eacute;phane Bouquet - the team that gave us the later 'Wild Side').  As we come to understand Lifshitz's manner of storytelling each of his works becomes more treasureable.  By allowing his tender and sensitive love stories to unfold in the same random fashion found in the minds of confused and insecure youths - time now, time passed, time reflective, time imagined, time alone - Lifshitz makes his tales more personal, involving the viewer with every aspect of the characters' responses.  It takes a bit of work to key into his method, but going with his technique draws us deeply into the film.

Mathieu (handsome and gifted J&eacute;r&eacute;mie Elkam) is visiting the seaside for a holiday, a time to allow his mother (Dominique Reymond) to struggle with her undefined illness, cared for by the worldly and wise Annick (Marie Matheron) and accompanied by his sister Sarah (Laetitia Legrix): their distant father has remained at home for business reasons.  Weaving in and out of the first moments of the film are images of Mathieu alone, looking depressed, riding trains, speaking to someone in a little recorder.  We are left to wonder whether the unfolding action is all memory or contemporary action.

While sunning at the beach Mathieu notices a handsome youth his age starring at him, and we can feel Mathieu's emotions quivering with confusion.  The youth C&eacute;dric (St&eacute;phane Rideau) follows Mathieu and his sister home, continuing the mystery of attraction.  Soon C&eacute;dric approaches Mathieu and a gentle introduction leads to a kiss that begins a passionate love obsession.  Mathieu is terrified of the direction he is taking, rebuffs C&eacute;dric's public approaches, but continues to seek him out for consignations.  The two young men are fully in the throes of being in love and the enactment of the physical aspect of this relationship, so very necessary to understanding this story, is shared with the audience in some very erotic and sensual scenes.  Yet as the summer wears on Mathieu, a committed student, realizes that C&eacute;dric is a drifter working in a condiment stand at a carnival.  It becomes apparent that C&eacute;dric is the Dionysian partner while Mathieu is the Apollonian one: in a telling time in architectural ruin Mathieu is excited by the beauty of the history and space while C&eacute;dric is only interested in the place as a new hideaway for lovemaking.

Mathieu is a complex person, coping with his familial ties strained by critical illness and a non-present father, a fear of his burgeoning sexuality, and his nascent passion for C&eacute;dric. Their moments of joy are disrupted by C&eacute;dric's admission of infidelity and Mathieu's inability to cope with that issue and eventually they part ways.  Time passes, family changes are made, and Mathieu drifts into depression including a suicide attempt.  The manner in which Mathieu copes with all of these challenges and finds solace, strangely enough, in one of  C&eacute;dric's past lovers Pierre (Nils Ohlund) brings the film to an ambiguous yet wholly successful climax.

After viewing the film the feeling of identification with these characters is so strong that the desire to start the film from the beginning now with the knowledge of the complete story is powerful.  Lifshitz has given us a film of meditation with passion, conflicts with passion's powers found in love, and a quiet film of silences and reveries that are incomparably beautiful. The entire cast is superb and the direction is gentle and provocative.  Lifshitz is most assuredly one of the bright lights of filmmaking.  In French with English subtitles.  Highly Recommended.

And If you're interested in nudity, well, you won't get much. Although you see a very and close shot of Jeremie's (?)juicy toy. However, the film is French. As any good French movie, it has to be strange. It seems the film and characters go nowhere, and by the end, you are sure that they went nowhere. I felt frustrated.

You never really know what they are thinking or feeling, but that's okay, sometimes, neither we do. After the disappointment I can say that overall I like it because it makes you think. Both boys have problems concerning their inner feelings and you see neither of them are mature enough to speak out. And we adults can't do that either.

1657828,5,B00005RRJI,"Expect to be surprised when you see Come Undone, and I do recommend you see it at least once.  Having seen it last year and watched it again yesterday, I'm glad I saw it the second time.  I found ""Come Undone"" exciting, mournful, sexy, stirring, sad, provacative, and fun, . . . all at once:  Even better than I expected!

It's a fine story of a boy's realization of his sexual identity, by falling in love with another boy!  ""Coming of age"" is difficult enough, but Mathieu also is coming to terms with being gay.  Well, at least the object of his affections, Cedric, is very handsome.  YET, thankfully, in the entire movie there are none of the stereotypically ""gay"" characters pulled out of some SoHo or South Beach gym.  The two guys are people anyone would like, though not at all perfect.

While there are no gratuitous sex scenes nor unnecessary nakedness, this IS a story about two healthy young guys falling in love and you will see them naked enough to convey the story.  There's a very, uh, steamy sex scene!  And when I say there's some naked scenes, I mean these men are naked.  It's really all very tasteful, though not at all mild by America's prudish neo-Victorian standards.

It wouldn't be a very realistic depiction of boyhood if these guys didn't have any ""issues"".  Well, it IS a genuine story and these guys have some problems, but none of the cliche standard-fare crap you get from every American coming of age film.  Frankly, I didn't like the problems the author chose for either of the boys -- but then neither did Mathieu or Cedric!  Fortunately, the problems were perfect for the story because they explain how these two boys chanced to meet in the first place.  NOTE that what I mean is that I like the persons the two characters seem to be, so I find myself wishing they didn't have those problems.  Just empathy, which is the best compliment I could give a movie.

What's more intriguing is the way issues are treated by the storyteller.  As much as I enjoyed this movie -- and I plan to watch it again this weekend -- I still can't entirely understand why the author chose to begin and end it in the ways he did.  Probably, though, that is because I'm only used to American movies with their all-too-cliche endings where everything is wrapped up.  But that's just it!  At age 18, nothing is resolved in life.  A guy that age has a lot of years ahead of him -- whether he's ready to deal with life or not.

So both the ending and the beginning perfectly reflect that reality.  Most of the other reviews make far too much ado about Mathieu's mother.  Her illness is not the issue.  Like any 18 year old, the problem for Mathieu is that he actually HAS a mother, two sisters, and a father.  For those are major impediments to love and sex and self-discovery for every healthy teenager in the world.

The story was told very effectively, though not entirely chronologically.  It's COMPELLING so expect to want to watch it again, so that'll be just fine.  When the film ends, I don't know whether to be hopeful or sad for Mathieu, and that reminds me how it was to be eighteen.

This is a fine film.  I can immediately think of two reasons to be glad this is a French film.  All the dialogue is in native French and it sounds wonderful.  While reading the subtitles you will absorb extra meaning from the tones and inflections of the actors.  IT IS VERY EASY TO ENJOY THE MOVIE IN THAT THE SUBTITLES WILL NOT SLOW YOU DOWN LIKE IN SOME MOVIES.  For example, that Jean Reno movie, ""Crimson Rivers: Angels of the Apcalypse"" -- I very much like that movie by the way, watched it twice -- in that movie I found myself reversing the DVD frequently to catch both what was said and what happened on screen, and certain nuances.  Much as I enjoyed it, it was frustrating.  ANYWAY, the second reason, without giving anything away, is that in ""Come Undone"" things that in American films would be distractions are nonissues in France, at least the France depicted in the movie.

(Again, I do recommend that Jean Reno's Crimson Rivers, which, with some careful inspection and reversing of a particular scene near the beginning, has an important surprise that you miss but later in the film you learn something that makes you go back and review.  I also like that other Jean Reno picture, 'the professional' I think it's called, which is why I watched his later movie, which is available at Amazon.  By the way, Crimson Rivers has another title originally, and something I read elsewhere indicated it was a sequel of a film only released in France, but I haven't found out more.

It's an entirely different genre, Action-Suspense-(& something I can't define), so I wouldn't venture so far as to say 'if you like Undone, you'll like Crimson' but with that in mind I do urge you to see it, if you like surprises and don't mind looking for them.",1124668800,3,4856,4.513172966781214

The vacation with his family, the time he tried to commit suicide and then when he came back. But the thing that shocked me was when i was watching the extras and the press was asking Jeremie if it was difficult (or something) playing in a gay role. I thought that he was gay. In the two movies-this one included-of his i have seen he is a gay character. But the movie is GREAT. strongly reccomended to anyone with an open mind.",1121731200,4,557,4.314285714285714

No matter your sexuality, it is virtually impossible not to be moved by this love story.  It displays the kind of love everyone longs for, man or woman.  I think the only controversy may be in the second half of the film.  I expected an explosive confict to put the main characters at odds (i.e. someone breaks someone's heart by doing something unforgivable in true film making style), but that's not exactly what I got and may not have been in the vision of the director (you'll have to see the film to know what I'm talking 'bout).

The movie is not a hardcore sex movie, in fact there is only one scene of sex, in the movie. The positives of this movie are, it uses silence as a tool and it looks into a differnt kind of first love, one that doesn't turn out in the same way other movies portray.

1657832,2,B00005RRJI,"Quick summary: don't waste your money on this dull flick, unless you are really keen to see the very attractive actors frolicking topless, and even then beware that there is only one (brief) sex scene - although it is quite a hot one.

It is interesting that the last few years has seen an explosion in gay films on DVD. Not sure what has caused this, but rest assured quantity is not related to quality.

This film is the story of two very handsome young man - a lean, long-limbed, very French looking guy and his boyfriend - a hunkier, very sexy number who many of us will recall from the excellent film ""Wild Reeds"". They meet in summer when both are very tanned and spending a lot of time on the beach.  They kiss and make love in very poorly lit scenes, and have one rather sexy romp in the sand dunes. Mostly off-camera, it all goes pear-shaped and the skinnier guy goes sort of crazy, develops pale skin and has a lot of very long Meaningful Close-Ups and other long pointless scenes to illustrate his unexplained and uninteresting depression.

This is not a very good film, despite the appeal of the lead actors. It is just another disappointing film that has been attractively packaged to cash in on the obviously thriving ""gay genre"" DVD. Hardly anything happens in this movie, which is fine if the characters are interesting (and they are not). What does happen occurs mostly off-camera. The support actors are dull (especially the sour-faced anorexic sister). There are a couple of good scenes but they are so infrequent and hidden amongst such a huge amount of boring, pretentious filler that they lose their impact. The script is rambling, the editing  poor. In the hands of a good editor this could have been a good short film maybe, but as a feature it is a dull, overblown failure with delusions of artistic importance.

Get ""Wild Reeds"" instead - a truly excellent film and starring the sexier half of the dup trying valiantly to save ""Come Undone.""",1094342400,5,1967,4.621776504297994

1657834,1,B00005RRJI,"I had reasonable expectations for this film - I didn't go in with high hopes, and I didn't go in thinking it would suck. What I didn't expect (because I hadn't read the reviews) were the long, drawn-out, wordless interludes featuring a depressed Mathieu staring unendingly at something, and the completely unsatisfying and sudden ending.
In a nutshell, the movie centers around Mathieu, an 18-year-old young man vacationing with his family at the beach. His family consists of his chronically depressed mother, his angry sister, and someone who may be their aunt, and no one is terribly happy with each other. Mathieu meets Cedric at the beach, and there is an instant spark between them. The two soon become intimate and then fall in love. The film shifts back and forth through about three different times in these peoples' lives, showing us what happened, and showing us (sort of) how they got there.
There are a few fairly intense erotic scenes between Cedric and Mathieu, and, sadly, tho are the only real highlights of the film, unless you really, really enjoy the aforementioned angst-ridden staring-out-the-window sequences interspersed with family hostility and bitterness.
The ending gives utterly no sense of closure, and the viewer is left wondering, ""why was I supposed to care about these people, and why did I just spend two hours of my life watching this crap?""
The special features aren't worth mentioning, either. Overall, it was hugely disappointing, and I don't recommend it at all. It's less of a love story and more of an introverted series of flashbacks.",1088035200,4,1577,5.022900763358779

1657837,3,B00005RRJI,"It is never my style to defend a movie just because people disagree with me. Yet looking through all the comments that slam the movie for having no plot, and even those who like the movie are unable to provide any solid reasons other than the encrypted deeply moving or honest, I feel the need to give my two sense. So bear with me.
 Let me first say that I don't think Presque Rien is the best gay movie ever made. Looking at the cover with two naked young guys, I expect it will offer little more than ""tasteful"" eye candy. But I came away feeling this is a lot better than I expect, and for the exact reason so many other complain about, the plot.
 The story unfolds with Mathieu, after suffering from depression; revisit his family summerhouse to pull his life together. It is the same place where two summers ago he met his first boyfriend, someone he just broke up with. Upon arriving, Mathieu pick up a wild cat that's roaming on the street. In the flashback, when Mathieu arrives his family summerhouse for vacation he ""picked up"" a wild child, Cdric, who basically lives on the street. Instantly we can draw the connection between Cdric and the cat: Mathieu said to the cat ""You are cute but you stink"". It reminds us in the flashback how he rehearses his introduction line to Cdric to the mirror: ""I must admit you are pretty cute"". After Mathieu bathed the cat he said you are my little prince charming, just as the carefree and attractive Cdric would be to any gay teenager falling in love for the first time. But there is the less fortune comparison: like the cat, Cdric, as much as he wants Mathieu, is unable to reciprocate the kind of affection Mathieu needs in a relationship.
 There is one key scene I find surprising that no one mentions is when Mathieu and Cdric visited a historic ruin. Architecture student Mathieu is interested in reading the background of the site but Cedric is only interested in a private intimate moment together - to him it is just a bunch of rock. Mathieu complained that Cdric has single track of mind and he doesn't like it when Cdric is like that. It is a telling sign of the difference between the two and how problematic the relationship could be. However, Mathieu (and many audience I bet) are so charmed by the good-looking and sexually uninhibited Cdric that he (and us) are blinded to the fact that Cdric is unable to bond with Mathieu in a non-physical way. Recall that Cdric was totally oblivious to any of the Mathieu's emotional problem when Mathieu's psychiatrist asked him, except that Mathieu is not interested in having sex in the past month, again only in a physical way.
 The ending, so many of the comments have criticized, is actually very satisfying for me. While it seems contrive that Mathieu should reach out for his boyfriend's ex, it is not hard to understand what draws him to Pierre. Cdric doesn't believe in family and would rather be a renegade than being introduced to Mathieu's father. But outside of his house, we see the domestic Pierre helping out his mother in setting up dinner. Mathieu himself longingly browsed through the family photos, including his pain-in-the-ass sister, the first thing he arrived his family home in years. When Mathieu asked Pierre why he didn't have his own place, Pierre as-a-matter-of-factly said ""Why? To be All Alone?"" The Mathieu who impulsively moved in with Cdric to a total strange city can certainly understand that sentiment. (When Pierre asked Mathieu if he think he is lame, Mathieu replied that he thinks he seems ""really together"")
 The movie concluded with Mathieu and Pierre coming across a lonely child in the beach (presumably his dad is also present but he was intentionally excluded from the frame). Pierre showed his paternal side by teaching the kid how to play football/soccer as Mathieu knowingly looking on. In the flashback, the naive and love-struck Mathieu was totally captivated by Cdric as he sang and danced in the buff at the beach, the post-depression, wiser and more mature Mathieu (something Pierre didn't fail to notice), once again sitting on a beach, now saw the side of Pierre that he knows he wouldn't find in Cdric.
  I don't dare to say my interpretation is THE interpretation. But I hate to see people dismiss scenes as pointless and boring, went on to accuse the movie has no plot and provides no answer when the very scenes they dismiss provide the clues they are looking for. For that, I feel I have to put down my view.",1075766400,171,4476,4.651074589127687

1657840,2,B00005RRJI,"Come Undone is yet another foray into the ages old ""coming of age"" and ""coming out"" storylines that have been legion of late. Stephane Rideau even appeared in two previous ones, including Wild Reeds, so the ground that has been tread here is not new.
What is different about this movie is the way the story is told. There are three different timeframes in which the story takes place. One of the time frames this movie finds itself occupying is the period at the beginning of the courtship between Rideau's Cedric and the central character Mathieu. The second period centers on a period afterwards in which Mathieu is in the hospital with a variety of ailments both physical and emotional. The third ""moment"" seemingly is when Mathieu is telling the story after the other two time frames. It appears that way because the storytelling device is used so haphazardly that the title could have referred to the unfolding of the plotlines.
Some reviewers expressed surprise that graphic sexuality is shown here, but the French have long been ahead of the curve in that regard. Wild Reeds was released in the '90s, long before Queer As Folk appeared stateside, and another coming out and of age film released at  approximately the same time, The Wounded Man, featured far more grisly content than is found here. The sex itself is a relatively minor aspect of the movie itself.
While the change in time perspective is a potentially creative motif, the use of that change did not seem to be organized in any discernable manner for someone who is not an avid film watcher. Thus, the use for this movie loses too much of its potential in the viewer finding himself or herself trying to figure out which way is up.
Sure, we find out that Mathieu's mother is in a state of post-partum depression compounded by grief because she lost an infant child to cancer. We figure out that Mathieu's relationship with his sister and father are strained at best, and we get an idea that Mathieu's family doesn't react with the hostility he expects, wanting to introduce Cedric to his father after their real relationship becomes clear, but the perspective changes so often and so suddenly that we're often not sure which time to consider the primary time for the movie to take place.
There is plenty of fodder for a great tale to be told, but this movie shows what can happen when a great story falls into the hands of a bad storyteller.",1068249600,5,2412,4.688679245283019
1657841,5,B00005RRJI,"Come undone will be a difficult movie to review as each person will interept the film differently; not in the single dimensional, linear ""connect-the-dot style"" in Hollywood of boy meets boy, boy falls in love with boy, conflect occurs, conflect resolved (or not) end of story. Come undone is rather a single story with three different timelines and the film unfoldes between the three. In my reviewes, I don't like to give away to much of the plot, and spoil the film for others, but it is a love story between Mathieu (the lead character) and Cedric (a real hottie) set in present day France. Mathieu's mother gave birth to a son with cancer and died after birth and the mother's health never fully recovers. His sister has issues too of her own and Mathieu's relationship with her is strained at best. Mathieu finds a release from his disfuctional family in his relationship with Cedric, but Mathieu seems to suffer from a bipolar-affective disorder, thus the mood swings (least thats my interpitation) and explains the hospital scenes.
The film jumps from one  timeline to another which makes the movie unique, you don't know which scene is next and nothing is predictible as opposed to the holloywood style where you can predict "" who's going to get murderd next""; or "" who's going to win in the end "";etc. At times I found myself wanting to cry as this film seemed so realistic and lifelike and I had this surreal experience that I was there observing this in 3D with the two main characters (there is no score or background music)The acting was superb; and the love making scenes didn't look like something out of a cheap porn movie;(ok lighten up so I've seen one or two in my lifetime) so real it could bring tears to your eyes.

1657842,5,B00005RRJI,"""Come Undone,"" directed by Sebastien Lifshitz, is the story of a love affair between two young Frenchmen: sensitive Mathieu (played by Jeremie Elkaim), who is dealing with problems in his family, and fast food worker Cedric (Stephane Rideau). The film is in French with English subtitles.
This film is an intriguing blend of psychological drama, coming-of-age tale, and love story. The story is told in a challenging non-linear style which requires some thought from the viewer. The lead actors are superb. Elkaim delivers a heartbreaking performance, and Rideau brings a bold charisma and sexual energy to his role. The two are ably supported by an excellent supporting cast; Violeta Ferrer is a particular standout with her warm, earthy performance as another young man's mother.
The filmmakers achieve a spellbinding visual poetry in many of the film's scenes. The use of tight close-up shots creates a real feeling of intimacy between viewer and characters.
...
Throughout the film are some intriguing symbolic touches; particularly powerful is the filmmaker's use of the beach as a setting in the story. There are scenes of both great pain and tenderness. Finally, ""Come Undone"" is a haunting film about love, loss, and healing.",1051920000,30,1233,5.232323232323233
1657843,5,B00005RRJI,"It appears to me that many of the professional reviewers were expecting or thought this movie was about hard-core ""SEX"" or a ""gay sex movie."" They have entirely missed this film's point and have insulted the screenwriter and director if that is the case. This is a beautiful, very simply put film about a 19 year old's first love and coming of age into adulthood. The story progresses very nicely. We see Mathieu's emotional journey. Again, the film is about his first love -- and this first love is with another man. What I love is how comfortable the director makes this homosexuality, not ""sex crazed gay men"" as American sterotypes can go. In fact, Mathieu never even says once that he is gay (he only lightly confirms it when Cdric when asks if he's told his family yet). My point being, that this wasn't made to be a ""gay movie,"" but a profoundly quiet film about love.
Cinematography was the poorest aspect. There were scenes where more camera angles were needed. Cinematography can greatly enhance a film's quality. The acting was really superb. Mathieu (Jrmie Elkam) is gifted with this nonchalant, casual acting that you don't see in many young actors (who want to shout emotions and be big and brazen). Cdric (Stphane Rideau) shows his vast acting experience well in a role that requires a ""veteran"" feeling. Throughout the whole film I felt nothing of a ""pushed to please"" Hollywood aspect. You either love it or it's not you're thing. A classic independent European film.
This is a wonderful film I feel for uneducated unexposed Americans to see. Besides the graphic sexual scenes (there's tastefully enough), one really gets an objective view of male homosexuality. You know, not that it's shoved in your face, but something to only respectfully observe (and the fact that the two men are very good looking is always a plus).
I find myself thinking about this film days after. I think I'm going to buy this (I rented it) because I feel I need to understand this film on more levels. It's got dual entertainment and educational value.",1049673600,22,2047,4.769014084507043

Both lead actors were excellent and the cinematography added a lot to the overall quality. To watch these characters grow and find each other was amazing. Although some of the ways they are kept apart seemed a little farfetched. I watched the extras on the DVD and Jeremie says that he sees the story as not being real, but existing in the reader's/viewer's head.

1657846,4,B00005RRJI,"OK, I'll admit it. I rented it for the nudity. Done as a gay coming-of-age story, ""Come Undone"" seemed like a pleasant enough excuse to show some well-toned guys romping around together on a beach. So I popped the DVD in the player, and I did what I usually do with gay softcore (or with something I think is trying to pass itself off as gay softcore), which is to say that I went straight for the chapter searches and to find the film's most explicit scenes. (It's not something of character, but, c'mon, you know you've done it.)
The scenes I jumped into, though as explicit as I'd hoped, left me wondering about the context of the film. As with most ambitious French films, ""Come Undone"" follows a non-linear plot where not everything that happens is explainable or explained away. When I stopped jumping from scene to scene, I started the film at the beginning, and I found ""Come Undone"" to be a somewhat complicated, resonant and smart film. I'm really glad I decided to watch the whole thing.
The majority of the film is told in flashback. From the scenes that take place in the ""present,"" we can tell that the film's main character Mathieu is depressed, just out of an institution and reluctant to talk about what's happened with his first gay relationship, which involved a boy named Cedric.
The film, sometimes without warning, flashes back and forth along the timeline of their relationship. We see how they met, with Cedric staring down Mathieu on the beach. We see their first dates, their first fights. We see Cedric telling Mathieu about his more colorful past as a gay man. We see him meeting Mathieu's family.
Occasionally, these scenes frame what happened a year later, after Cedric and Mathieu's relationship, which we learn became serious, is over.
The film leaves it for the audience to decide what happened between the two summers, hinting that Cedric and Mathieu's courtship and breakup will be more important to who Mathieu is than how the relationship went. I fought my urge, as an American moviegoer, to have more of the loose ends of the film tied up, and I found ""Come Undone"" to be ultimately rewarding.

1657847,4,B00005RRJI,"The film is intelligent and unfolds at a slow pace, but there is a purpose to the timing and the director has a clear idea of what he is doing.  The use of flashbacks is not nearly as confusing as some reviewers here seemed to find it.  To assist viewers who might otherwise become lost, the film uses different seasons and different color palettes for the two main time-frames (warm summer colors for summer, cool more wintry colors for winter).  If that's not enough, the main character wears a heavy neck-scarf during the winter scenes.  Short of including subtitles giving the dates and locations of each scene, the director did everything he could to make it clear where and when the events took place.
The acting is excellent, and even the secondary characters (the mother, her friend, the sister) are convincing. The cinematography is also outstanding.  As for the story, it is certainly as believable as any other story of passionate first love.  I especially liked the playfulness of the two main characters, because it helped to remind us that they are not that far from childhood and are just beginning to develop emotionally.
While the issue of clinical depression does play a significant role in the film, I did not find the film itself to be depressing at all, but almost redemptive (though without a traditional happy ending).
Video quality on the DVD is very good, as is the audio.  The English subtitles were good, but you cannot turn them off.",1043366400,12,1461,4.773809523809524

After reading a hundred or so reviews, and buying 30+  foreign films, including this one, I  have come to believe that ""Coming Undone"" has the highest-quality customer reviews of any film I've bought. I don't want to sound pompous or review the reviewers, but, taken as a set of three, the reviews published here are mature and insightful.
Opinions differ, howerever. I can respect reviewers giving this film only four stars. It took me a second viewing to put the scenes in chronological  order. (So what? My alternative is to watch Hollywood pap aimed at kids.) I don't mind if a film makes me think.
For me, personally, this film deserves a Full FIVE STAR rating. I cannot understand how anyone could award less than four stars or more--unless they prefer the comercial-at-the-expense-of-art, American approach to box office success. This film has it all for me: beautiful and believable actors, a tender and realistic plot, beautiful French coastline, beaches, and quiet country settings and more.

I liked the film.  It takes chances and has some successes.  But then again, French directors seem to enjoy leaving a lot of questions.  Personally, I think it would be more satisfying to answer the questions rather than leave them just hanging almost oppressively.  Maybe the director likes that.  Maybe the point is to have these huge clouds hanging over my response.  As you can tell, I'm still somewhat conflicted about what I'm supposed to make of it all.
So, in an effort to force the issue, I come away with this:  its interesting to watch the characters but I feel more manipulated by a rather tried and true art film technique.  And I don't like to feel manipulated.  So, while I enjoyed watching the movie (DVD actually), I can't say I was satisfied with it.",1038182400,4,975,4.451977401129944

On that aspect, I think it's better than ""Beautiful Things"". I always felt ""Beautiful Things"" was missing something, and didn't realize what it was until I watched this movie.

There are some very intimate scenes which are graphically portrayed, sometimes tastefully, other times gratuitously. The love evolving between the guys was really a struggle for Mathieu, but it seems Cdric had no problem with this relationship, hence the problem that we are left to deal with.

The guys in the film are definitely cute, but as with men in general, good looks only keep your attention so long if there is no substance to back it up.  I turned the movie off half-way through as I just couldn't understand what was going on and why I should care about it.  I finished it a couple days later and was still unsatisfied.
Stick to other films like ""Trick"" and ""Big Eden"" if you want good date movies. :)",1029974400,6,926,4.4674556213017755
1657855,4,B00005RRJI,"First love, loss and healing surround a boy's discovery of his unique identity outside familial quandaries and limitations.  Elkam's performance as Mathieu is astoundingly heartfelt and articulate in portraying this young man's emergence from sheltered apathy into life's passion and unpredictable temperament.
Unlike other movies of this genre, the controversy surrounding the boys' orientation and relationship serve to add a compelling depth to the plot, rather than a clich anecdote.
With the mood shifting throughout as the viewer becomes more aquainted with the boys' feelings toward one another, one also can sense the resistance among the other characters to this level of intimacy between young men.  The actors deliver such genuine connection between these characters, the innocence of such a love is self-evident.
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.",1028505600,7,857,5.6875

We were expecting a lot from this movie and we were very dissapointed. If I wasn't that dissapointed I wouldn't be writting this. I just don't want more dissapointed people in the world.

I cannot say how much I am impressed by this film. If you have ever been in love, deeply in love, and lived to talk about it you will identify with this film.",1024531200,5,415,4.135802469135802
1657858,5,B00005RRJI,"I have had the privelage to watch this awesome movie depicting male homosexuality. This is a typical French movie in the way of dialogue, content, and direction, but never the less it is amazingly real. Come Undone is not a movie for those that are seeking the regular garbage that comes out of Hollywood.
This is a unique movie in that it is simple and cleverly portrays sexuality between two young males in the real world.
The movie starts off slow and dialogue in some scenes is non existent, but picks up from there on. I could not take my eyes off the screen as the movie reflects life the way it is without all that glamour and fantasy that comes out of Hollywood. Another reason why I couldn't take my eys off the screen was because the two male leads are DREAMY and HOT! Both actors did their part well and are definitely worth watching, especialy during the intimate moments between the two. It must be admitted that most people that enjoy or will enjoy watching this movie is for no more than to see the scenes depicting the two male stars nude and Jeremie Elkaim in an intimate moment in the bathroom playing with his....
The movie is excellent! Dialogue and plot are simple but neatly delivered thanks to the clever direction and performances that are given by the two leading lads. The end of the movie leaves you wondering but it is good for it leaves you to determine a suitable ending. As in real life the ending of the movie leaves you thinking about today, the future, and being prepared for the unexpected. Life has no gaurantees!",1023235200,14,1549,4.516014234875445
1657859,4,B00005RRJI,"I think some of the reviewers of this film were too busy waiting for nudity,sex scenes, and simple exposition.  This is NOT the french version of ""Beautiful Thing"" or a soft core romance novel type movie.  It is challenging only because it moves away from the ""coming out"" or ""cute boy"" genres of gay cinema.
All the characters are realized wonderfully with a minimum of dialogue.  The use of silence is a tool that makes you focus your mind and ask questions of the movie.  Nothing is pat.
This is a movie that treats it characters (and the audience) with a respect one rarely sees in gay themed movies (one need only compare this movie with simplistic dreck like ""The Broken Hearts Club"" to understand the difference between respecting your audience versus pandering to it).
This film makes you focus on a young man who is dealing not just with his nascent homosexuality but also serious family issues and a lack of direction in his own life.  All these things add to a well-thought out character. And the time jumps gives the viewer the oppurtunity to see how that character progresses (and regresses).
It is not a simple film. But it is a very,very good one.",1019260800,118,1162,4.621359223300971

When the film is over, think about it some more. The director has some exciting and interesting things to say about love and relationships and families and lovers and adolescence and adulthood and sex. Confused about the flashbacks? Consider the three different time periods in the film ... and the seasons in which they are depicted ... and the frame of mind of the lead character. CAUTION! This motion picture is not intended for people looking for a gay version of ""When Harry Met Sally"" or ""Endless Love."" This motion picture was created with the intent to include the audience in the storytelling experience. Bravo.",1017705600,18,795,4.896296296296296

That's exactly why I liked this movie! The director doesn't take you for a [person] and let you fill in the blanks. God, do we ALWAYS need to see movies that are explained from A to Z? Also, there are some long quiet scenes with no dialogues, but I was really fascinated by that and not bored at all! The scenery is really beautiful and the actors are great. If you want some freshness, a little unshamefully exposed nudity (a la French) and a passionate love story, buy this Dvd! ...",1016928000,4,708,4.412213740458015

7952661,3,B00005RRJI,"I personally love Come Undone. It's a deep and metaphorical journey through love and it's amazingly crafted. I would definitely give it a 10/10. I then decided to order the DVD because it was no longer available on Netflix. The DVD I received was very outdated in it's presentation. The case was paper thin and the disc was in a slide slot within the case. This is not 2002, but there should have been more care put into its multimedia platform. The menu was also very simple with no other options for language, subtitles, or even scene selection. The film is played in a small box in the center of your screen. For all these reasons and more, I can't give this a five star review. The movie deserves the world's attention but let's hope it's distributors know how to do that.",1486684800,,776,4.471830985915493
