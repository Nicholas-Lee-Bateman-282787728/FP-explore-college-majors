8455848,4,B0053XZ8XI,"I have a few of the Jump force work outs with Anni.  As others indicated her voice and comments can be annoying, yet I enjoy the workouts.  The are constantly changing.she uses light weights with more aerobicsgiving you a better cardio work out.  In this workout she does a-lot of jump roping which you can use or jump without the rope with limited space.  I like to combine Anni work outs with Jeri Love strength and cardio workouts.  I gave this a 4 star as it is not one of my favorite workouts with the jump roping.  But; it would be a five if you like jump roping.",1368230400,,569,4.222222222222222
