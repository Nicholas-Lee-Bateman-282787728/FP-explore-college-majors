7837962,5,6303113451,I teach art history and art appreciation. For years I have been using this series in class. It is about as sexy a documentary series as I have ever used. The filming (on location) is beautiful and Michael Wood's enthusiasm is contagious.,1224028800,2,237,4.666666666666667
7837963,4,6303113451,"The Art of the Western World video series is excellent up to 1945. We are using it for the second time for USF (University of South Florida) Senior Programs for students in their 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s. Picture and sound fit well together, and provide a lot of ""Aha"" experiences for people who have visited the sites, or seen the sculptures or paintings in art museums. The videos, shown in about 26 minute segments provide a super basis for discussions, and for subsequent visits to art museums.",1033171200,16,496,4.6477272727272725
7837964,4,6303113451,"I have viewed three comprehensive art history video series preparing to send six weeks in Europe. This was the best.
The selected material is representive,the research well done.the filming and background music pleasing. I have seen many of the included works in museums and look forward to seeing them with my newly acquired acumen. The modern art section is a little pc and the woman who intimates that western art is built on the exploitation of the female nude is off-the-wall. The section on Florence was my favorite because of its beauty and importance as the epicenter of western culture. No, this is not a boring series except for those who favor Michelob over Michelangelo.",1023148800,26,682,4.939130434782609
7837965,3,6303113451,"I found these videos pretty good and not in the least boring. Michael Wood and the production team have done a solid effort in presenting such a vast topic in the time allowed. The areas covered are well presented, intelligently commented upon and comprehensive. Well worth seeing a few times.",998265600,9,293,4.88
7837966,4,6303113451,"We watched this video series during the last two terms in my Art History class. Yes, alot of people appeared to be asleep, but if they are anything like the students at my school, that wasn't the fault of the video. I thought they were very interesting and filled in alot of the gaps in my art history knowledge. I liked how they had mini-slide shows of works with some music playing in the background. It was especially nice in our lecture hall with the surround sound system.",985824000,10,477,4.431818181818182
7837967,1,6303113451,"We watched this video for my Humanities class. I do have to say these videos are extremely boring. From my observation over a third of the class was sleeping. If you feel like showing these videos, make sure you are  fully awake.",953596800,2,229,4.4523809523809526
