1659620,5,B00005T338,"This is one of the many ""Firm Parts"" videos, which is a compilation of several videos.  In this workout you will see segments of Firm Strength, Firm Cardio, Super Sculpting, Super Cardio, Fat Blaster, Maximum Body Shaping and even a couple of sections from Firm Basics Sculpting with Weights.  It runs about 67 minutes long, but I find that the time goes by really fast. It is mainly a strength workout with cardio portions mixed in, but does a good job of hitting all the major muscle groups.  For the lower body you will see squats, leg presses, lunges, dips and some floorwork working the inner thighs and table work for the hamstrings and behind. For the upper body you will see military presses, french presses, tricep kickbacks, bicep curls, one arm rows and pushups.  There is also a couple segments of ab work as well as a few cardio segments to break up the strength work a bit.

I think this workout was put together well, I give it 5 stars even though I actually skip a couple of the cardio portions to shorten it up just a bit.  But that is just a minor adjustment I make to it.  I am afraid that some of these Firm videos will disappear, I hope that doesn't happen.  This is one workout that I would buy a second copy if it were to ever go out of print, I like it that much.  Highly recommended.",1110067200,7,1308,4.327868852459017
1659621,5,B00005T338,"This workout is fun and effective for beginner to immediate exercisers. The moves are simple yet fun and very effective. This video uses The Firm's time proven technique for combining weights and aerobics to deliver fast effective weight loss. As an advanced exerciser I do own this tape and I use it on days when I want to have a simpler workout for variety. The workout can also be modified by using heavier weights to make it more suitable for the advanced exerciser.
As always variety is key when working out. Check out all the firm workouts and combine them for maximum weight loss.",1046822400,15,587,4.653846153846154
1659622,5,B00005T338,"Generally I am not fond of the Firm's compilation tapes (this video was derived from several different Firm workouts), however this one has come to be one of my favorites.  It works the entire body, with an emphasis on the glutes (plenty of the Firm's tall box presses, LOTS of lunges, squats, hip extensions & table work).  I use fairly heavy poundage and find I get a most thorough workout.  As an aside, this is NOT a cardio workout -- the minimal cardio work appears to have been included more for ""fast muscle twitch"" and as recovery for the next set of weight workout.  Highly recommended.  If you're new to weights, the Firm Beginners or Maximum Body Shaping used with  light weights would be  perfect.",1038528000,27,709,4.624
1659623,4,B00005T338,"The toning in this video includes pretty much every muscle group in the body--back, abs, arms (biceps and triceps), shoulders, thighs, buttocks--very effective if you want to firm up. The instructors make it very clear how the moves should be performed and show you what NOT to do. The cardio is mostly low-impact and not very challenging, which is the major criticism I have of this video. Most of the higher impact moves include alot of power jumping, which gets to be repetitive after a while. There are also quite alot of segments that have lunges, which are effective, but really, how many lunges can one person stand?
I have to wake up at 5 in the morning to have enough time to do this before work (it's 67 minutes long!) but it's well worth it. You'll see the difference!",1034467200,23,779,4.571428571428571
1659624,5,B00005T338,"Maximum Body Shaping is a wonderful all-over body workout mixing weight training with low-impact aerobics.  It has a running time of 67 minutes, which I find to be a bit long.  Sometimes I fast forward through a couple of the sets, not because I can't finish the workout, but because I don't have the time.
This video has an excellent (very tough) section of floor work that is great for the inner thigh and gluts.  Heidi Tanner is a machine and doesn't let up over some of these very long sets.
This video is for the intermediate to advanced exerciser, although beginners could do it with little or no weights.  It is very challenging and I use it to gauge my fitness level as I continue to get in shape.",1029715200,24,705,4.4
1659625,5,B00005T338,"I love this tape. I'm just getting back into shape and was doing Susan Harris's body sculpting, which is also excellent, when I decided to incorporate this one as well. The varied segments and instructors keep things interesting and make the 67 minutes seem like only 20, and I never sweat so much as I do during this tape. Afterward and the next day I don't feel sore so much as really flexible and good. The exercises seem extremely effective, I can already see results after three times, yet they are not impossible to do. And there are just enough repetitions ... not too few, and not so many that it becomes grueling. I highly recommend this tape!",1022803200,11,652,4.533898305084746
1659626,5,B00005T338,"I've only used three of The FIRM's workout videos, but out of those select few, Total Body Shaping Mix is my favorite. If I didn't have to vary my workouts I'd use this one everyday! This tape is exactly what it says it is, ""a Total Body Shaping Mix"", which is great. I always come out the next day feeling very sore. The only downside is, there's only about 5 minutes of ab work, which is one of my favorite areas to work on. Oh well though, I love this tape!",1016841600,16,460,4.065934065934066

1659702,5,B00005T338,"A first rate, serious, comprehensive & fun DVD.  Excellent music. Tracey Long and all other instructors in this DVD are calm, poised---genuine master instructors.  No obnoxious drill-instructor theatrics here.

No ""fancy footwork"" /complicated fast dancey moves/choreography. I do this easily and I have two left feet. It's 57 minutes without the warm-up.  Zero dread factor.

I use it twice a week (along w a Cathe DVD).  Amazing & dramatic body reshaping....(less cellulite, LIFTED BUNS) within weeks!",1306627200,7,503,5.552631578947368
1659703,5,B00005T338,"I'll admit, it takes a few workouts to get some of the foot work down in the cardio sections, but once you get the hang of it, you'll have sweat dripping everywhere. This is one of my favorite firm videos. The cardio sections can be very intense, because many contain plyometrics, and if you do them right, you'll feel an insane burn. Not for the beginner or for those who won't put the effort in... you have to be serious about this workout to get results.",1286755200,8,457,4.325581395348837
1659704,5,B00005T338,"THE FIRM Total Body Shaping Mix is a great workout that uses weights I have all the Firm videos. But, this one will work you. So, if you want a good muscle shaping/toning/ strengthing workout  this one is it. It's about 67 mins long It does have about 13 mins of cardio. and I love Tracie Long She is an excellent instuctor. It does use a barbell and the fanny lifter but, weights and any step up box will work. This is an good all around body shaping workout.",1252454400,3,460,4.168539325842697
1659705,5,B00005T338,This is a great overall aerobic and muscle toning workout with a lower-body emphasis even though there is also a nice balance of upper body toning.  The music is very motivating and the workout is quite challenging.  The aerobics includes plyometric jumps and there are several sections that use a high step.  It's long at 67 minutes but interesting enough that the time flies.,1229817600,,377,4.859375
1659706,3,B00005T338,"I like this video. I have both the ""firm strength"" and ""firm cardio"" that much of this video is from, so i am comfortable doing it. It's not nearly as hard as you might think of first preview. They have some harder sets, but than mix in some stuff from ""firm basics"" and some EASY cardio stuff that you feel like is a waste of time. The Jen Carmen set seems to never end either. It's right in the middle, and it's pretty bad. If that section wasn't in there, and they had better cardio sections, I'd give it a full five stars, but because of that, it'll be at three. I do this one about every two weeks.",1227657600,2,603,4.07563025210084
1659707,1,B00005T338,"If you like fancy footwork and skipping around to different instructors then you'll like this video. I don't, and I hate it. It just sits on my shelf.",1211155200,4,150,4.392857142857143
1659708,5,B00005T338,"Some people may be confused by the title of this workout. It was previously released as a ""Tri-trainer all weights"" workout with a cover including multiple firm instructors.  The only one presented in this video is the one on the posted cover, Tracey Long. I would compare her to Karen Voight or Gin Miller.  Having done virtually every workout and seen nearly every instructor, Tracey is far and away one of the best. If you are a fan of ""perky, enthusiastic, cheerleader-type instructors, she is not for you"".  Tracey is methodical, precise, gives excellent cues and tips on technique with little spoken encouragement.  That, however, doesn't matter. You will be working hard and sweating hard and won't want to hear someone yelling ""you can do this"".  This is a great, total-body workout that incorporates some small cardio sections.  The instruction is clear and solid and the workout is very effective for a 45 minute format.  There are harder workouts from the FIRM, and lighter. This one is probably middle-of-the road.
