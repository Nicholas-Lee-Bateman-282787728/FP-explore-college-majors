2693285,5,B000KKWGH0,"IN FEAR ,ALLEY SHEEDY PLAYS A PSYIC WITH THE POWER TO SEE INTO A KILLER'S MIND AND BEST PART TO THE MOVIE IS WHEN SHE HEAD TO HEAD WITH THE KILLER HIMSELF. I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS MOVIE RULES AND IF YOU CAN FIND A COPY YOU SHOULD DEFINITLY CHECK IT OUT.",998092800,2,259,3.814814814814815
8157889,2,B000KKWGH0,"Even though this movie is from 1990, I couldn't finish it because of the helpless female lead character. I like Ally Sheedy, but she was difficult to watch in such a ""Please! No! Don't!"" role.",1526169600,,192,4.514285714285714
8157890,4,B000KKWGH0,Great drama and good plot.,1515369600,,26,4.4
8157891,3,B000KKWGH0,"Interesting low-budget adaptation of ""Crime and Punishment"" highlighted by director Alfred Zeisler's noir stylistics and a decent cast. Warren William fans will enjoy the actor's penultimate screen role. Not the world's greatest print, but it's watchable enough.",1417478400,3,262,6.108108108108108
8157892,4,B000KKWGH0,Like the movie and the reliability of the seller.,1405555200,,49,4.555555555555555
8157893,5,B000KKWGH0,I really wanted this movie couldn't find it on dvd but video was good.  I had ordered it from another person who disappointed me.  This person sent it right away.  I really enjoyed it.,1295222400,,184,4.352941176470588
8157894,5,B000KKWGH0,This is a great movie with Ally Sheedy and Lauren Hutton. Unfortunately it can not be found in DVD format.,1295222400,,106,4.35
8157895,5,B000KKWGH0,"Fear is a really well-acted thriller that for some reason is not on dvd. Not a run of the mill thriller either, with cool twists. For a movie this intense, it gets funny at times (Sheedy is funny getting people to believe she has ESP.)",1225756800,2,235,4.2444444444444445
8157896,4,B000KKWGH0,"This is a great movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Ally Sheedy plays a psychic who has helped the police many times as she gets inside the murderers head and can see what he's doing.  Lauren Hutton is her agent as she has written books about the murders she has helped solve.

Ally's character starts getting flashes of murders happening as though she is there.  She goes to the police who don't want her help until she proves herself but the kicker is that the murderer is also a psychic and can tell when she tunes in and he takes her along for the murders.

I hope they get it on USA DVD's soon so we can purchase it.  I have been waiting for years for this movie.",1198713600,,684,4.105263157894737
8157897,5,B000KKWGH0,"This is the only movie I have ever seen that kept me on the edge of my seat from 5 minutes into the movie until the end.  I've seen many movies with 'sitting on the edge of your seat moments', but never one where it's the whole movie.  Make sure before you hit play that you've gone to the bathroom, refilled your drink, and fixed your popcorn, because you won't even think about hitting the pause button during it.",1109635200,,415,4.2405063291139244
8157898,5,B000KKWGH0,"Ally Sheedy is great in this role as an unwilling participant in a spree of serial killings.  Because her psychic abilities have gained her recognition, she must race to catch the killer before he can catch her.  This is a must for fans of Kay Hooper.",1026000000,5,251,4.434782608695652
