6608881,5,B00N46CU2I,"This is a very cool box set!!..Yes, obviously it does not contain season 7, but they do give you a $5 coupon for it, when it comes out,lol..Other than that, it's great!!..The outer cardboard ""ammo box"" is made from thick corrugated cardboard and looks fantastic, from a distance it looks very real..The SOA Table box inside, is also very nice and well made, of thick, heavy plastic, with magnets to keep it closed tight.  The book of seasons is also very well made and sturdy...Overall, if you are a fan of the show, you will love this set!!..Even if you're just a collector of blu rays and box sets, you will really love this set, it's worth every penny!!..Here is unboxing video my husband made...

6608882,1,B00N46CU2I,"ANOTHER UPDATE! $270!!!!!!!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
UPDATE: AS I CONSIDER THE PURCHASE AND ADD TO CART, PRICE JUMPS BY OVER $50!!! SORRY. RIDICULOUS!

First, it was Breaking Bad (SONY), and Dexter(SHO). An SOA DEDICATED FAN Since ""Pilot,"" aired in 2008. What about the real fans that have bought every blu-ray, the day it hit the shelves? Kurt, sInce the beginning of The Shield, I have been a HUGE fan. I also own that complete series. I am a fan, who is obsessed with the bonus features/extended episodes, etc. That is massively the point, to me anyhow, of purchasing these blu-ray sets. Now, I've already pre-ordered the final season (blu-ray). Already own the Digital HD copies of 5, 6 & 7. Up until season 5, the bonus features, feature commentary, and other lil' specialties, have been fantastic. Season five however, doesn't even have finale commentary! Just commentary for the penultimate episode, and only by director Peter Weller (who, along with Paris Barclay, I do absolutely love). To top it off, a censored gag reel! Season 6's ""so - called EXCLUSIVE EXTRAS,"" were also a huge disappointment, as I eagerly awaited its (not cheap) delivery, to my doorstep. The finales commentary, had absolutely nothing to do with the actual episode ""A Mother's Work."" A spectacular finale, by the way. I have absolutely no complaints about the show itself. It is the principal, of this whole conception. of course, I would love to own this box set. But, what about seasons 1 through 6, which I already spent  way more than what this box set costs for? Not even including the final season! so, let me guess. Another rushed release by fox networks? True Fans (that don't have an extra few hundred to spend TWICE) will once again be let down by FX. I know, this isn't a reflection of Kurt Sutter. 24 L.A.D., Fargo, don't do this to The Final Season of SONS, FX!  Another rushed release leaves so many things to be let down.

HOW ABOUT, NOT JUST A SPOT FOR SEASON 7? I PROPOSE A SALE OF THE SET, MINUS THE DISCS, AT A MUCH LOWER COST. ILL FILL IT MYSELF. I KNOW I AM NOT ALONE, HERE!

5 Stars for Sons of Anarchy. None, for this whole idea, period.

P.S. BY MY ACCOUNTING THERE SHOULD BE 19 BLU-RAY DISCS, BETWEEN SEASONS 1-6, NOT 17 (UPDATE:FIXED IN PRODUCT DESCRIPTION). UNLESS THEY'VE BEEN ALTERED FOR THE SET. 23 (DISCS) TOTAL AFTER SEASON 7 IS RELEASED.",1416096000,10,2387,4.781553398058253

6608884,5,B00N46CU2I,This is a box set that was well planned out and not cheaply made the cover that is like the top of the table is magnetic and holds in place very well and has a spot for season 7. This set does have a nice weight to it I highly recommend this set. The box that looks like real wood is cardboard but it is thick cardboard I promise you will not be disappointed.

6608891,5,B00N46CU2I,"One of the better dramatic series of the past several years. Rated MA and that's definitely appropriate due to graphic language, violence, and sex. Excellent cast, excellent music, lots of action. I found the ultimate story arc a bit predictable, and I have evidence on the internet that I called how the last episode would go down a week before it aired.

The actual pieces that compose this collection of Sons of Anarchy: Seasons 1-6 is very well done with a professional
flair that in my opinion, is pure genius: from the sculpted Blu-ray case that captures the SONS 'Reaper Table', to the Ammo Box and other supporting packaging. The additional room for the 7th season disks was well thought out and functional.

As for the actual SOA Series Seasons 1-6, I only have but one comment: One of the BEST Series on TV ever! The script will keep you coming back for more, while the shear power and impact of the presentation will captivate you and make you a believer.

My only thought after Season 6?....when would Season 7 be released?",1451606400,,869,5.72093023255814

Of course, SOA takes those real life issues and magnifies them by sudden death.

The replicate table top and discs being in a folder really makes this much better than most other complete series sets. Yes, there is a slot for the final season disc.

Also, the box is a little smaller than I was expecting since there aren't really any perspective pics to give you an idea of size.

The discs are packaged in sleeves that are inside a hard bound picture book. There are photos on each sleeve, and quotes from John Teller's book on some of the sleeves. There were some nice extra features as well. I especially enjoyed the outtakes. Season seven was not included when I bought it, but it came with a $5.00 coupon for when you purchase it.

It's a bit of a chore to keep up with each of the many characters and who does what to whom, but each episode is like eating popcorn...can't stop at just one.  Googled the unhandsome step dad ... you will be surprised at one of his roles back when.

6609233,5,B00N46CU2I,"If you are a fan of Sons of Anarchy, this is the set to get.  The Blu-ray discs come in a custom box that is made to resemble the table that the characters sat around throughout the series.  Currently, only the first six seasons are available, there is a space inside the box that leaves room for season 7 which will not be released until February.  Lots of stuff to look at inside the box, and the extras on the disc are worth the price of admission.  I was able to pick this up while on sale, so if you are considering getting this, you may want to wait till Feb, since I would imagine that the series will be marked down during the release of season 7",1421539200,,654,4.0859375

6609300,5,B00N46CU2I,"SoA is one of the greatest drama series ever. A modern day Shakespearean sort of tragedy, it unfolds over 7 seasons. Gripping drama, incisive exploration of morality and the cause and effects of interwoven actions, plus all the sex, shoot 'em up, brawling, and chase scenes anyone could ask for. A tour de force for Kurt Sutter and the entire remarkable cast and writing team.",1421107200,,376,4.8
6609301,5,B00N46CU2I,"Easily my favorite Collector's Edition I own and being quite the nerdy collector, I've got plenty of collectables on my shelves.

Aesthetics: As you can see from the manufacturer's picture or the countless images in the review section, the case is absolutely beautiful. A recreation of the Son's church table, the durable and picturesque case will look great on any shelf and give the collector a sense of membership to the biker club.

Content: While the set contains season 1-6 (and for those lucky enough to order at the appropriate time, season 7) there is no dramatic overhaul to the discs already released. These are very much the same dvds/blu rays already being distributed with the same content. So if you were looking for some extra scenes or interviews, and your purchase was based solely on that misconception than you might want to reconsider what your buying. Otherwise, for those who haven't already seen all the extra goodies, these definitely provide some insight into not only Sutter's thought process but many of the actors as well.

Overall: I think this Collector's Edition is a must own for any Sons of Anarchy fan. With a gorgeous display case that is as tough as it is sexy, hours of extra content, why not take the ride with club whenever you want while owning a piece of television gold.",1421107200,,1313,4.800884955752212

I didn't have a chance to catch the first 4 and a half seasons, so when my delivery came, I settled in for a bit of binge watching. My happiness turned into disappointment when the CD's started freezing and skipping on the very first viewing! Every disc has some sort of issue, with the last disc of season one not even readable! To think I spent $152.00 on junk! After painfully trying to watch 3 seasons, I'm just frustrated. The show is awesome, what I can watch is great, but skipping scenes and freezing isn't cool at all. Hopefully someone can help me get a new set, as I can't even put another CD in I'm so angry about the quality. I don't know who the manufacturer is, but I hope this is just an isolated incident. Amazon, please help!!",1420502400,2,851,4.2592592592592595

6609429,5,B00N46CU2I,"I have purchased ""box sets"" of movies and tv series before but I have to say that the SOA collectors edition is amazing and really really impressive looking. I was one of the lucky ones who got it on sale...one day only...and yes, as soon as it was shipped, I DID receive a code in my email to get season 7 for free. Mine worked no problem ( you put the code in at the end of the checkout process and it makes your total zero!) and it will be delivered in February when season 7 is released. I am not necessarily a fan of all the violence but I have bikers in my family and I appreciated the characters and storylines over the years. Tuesday nights will never be the same without this show, but at least I can re-watch when I want to now and with all the extras content (LOVE gag reels!).

The Lost set was awesome but it doesn't compare to this one.  From the case to the way the seasons are presented is great.  What's even more awesome is that it already has the space for the 7th season so you don't have to worry about having the last season seperate from the set.

6609452,5,B00N46CU2I,"Sons of Anarchy, I knew you well. I am going to miss the guys SO MUCH! There were times when the sequences were beyond stunning. The story was not for the weak of heart or for peaceniks, it could be quite brutal. The finale year, this year (7), was worth watching the entire 6 years before it. But there were moments of exquisite love, friendship and family tucked into it that made this one of the best shows I have ever seen. Dragged into by my husband, ultimately so glad I did my duty  . The ending was exactly how I envisioned it. Anything else just would NOT have for right. THIS SERIES DESERVES THE EMMY THIS YEAR!!! And finally Jax. Charlie Hunnam, now HE was a man who I came to love not just for his incredible hunkiness, but because he was the greatest actor on the show. RIP SOA. Yes, I am buying the 7 year DVD set. The reason I can watch these shows as a Christian, is because I can separate fiction from reality. This was the most wonderful fiction I have ever watched. Kurt Sutter is a genius (creator, writer, Executive Producer, Director and, stunningly, one of the worst characters this side of Hannible Lecter, Otto - so much talent in such a relatively small man). SOA Makes Hollywood still relevant. There aren't many shows I can say that about!",1419120000,,1267,4.391489361702128

I can't add to what's been said already. It's GREAT!

Equal to the Breaking Bad Barrel set.

I love that it looks like the carving on the table. The portfolio has some well placed/picked liner notes as well as stills from the show. The discs are well hidden in this durable portfolio.  Great way to showcase the entire collection of the show. Not to mention, it's pretty sweet to be getting season 7 for free when it's released in February 2015.",1418947200,4,567,4.6138613861386135

6609470,5,B00N46CU2I,"I wanted this so much it hurt, but I could not justify $300 for the blu ray collectors edition, or the $200 for the other. So when I checked my email this morning and saw there was a gold box deal, my curiosity was piqued, but I was confident the deal would not be affordable or justifiable. I was so wrong! It was my destiny to own this collection. I began watching SOA this past summer. I had dvr'd season 6 because I finally caved to peer pressure and I knew that once I made it through seasons 1-5 on Netflix, there was no way that I could wait to watch season 6, especially since season 6 wasn't released on Netflix until after season 7 had started, if I remember correctly. Kurt Sutter is a genius, although overly dramatic sometimes. I would follow him anywhere and am currently breathless with anticipation for his next FX series Bastard Executioner. Because of Sutter the resonating, nails on a chalkboard sound of Peg Bundy's ""AL!!!!"" are gone. Gone from my memory is Leela's ""HI YAA!"" Now the deep rich tone of Katey Sagal saying ""Sweetheart"" is etched into every nerve and fiber of my being. As I type this, Regular Show is on in the background and it's the episode that Katey voices Mordecai's mother; I was worried for Mordecai's girlfriend's safety. Sutter is responsible for me finally taking Charlie Hunnam seriously, making Tommy Flanagan a household name (better late than never and well deserved), introducing me to Theo Rossi and the scary and crazy, but awesome David Labrava, and last but not least, giving me another reason to love Walton Goggins. This show is worth watching even if you only watch one season . . . but you won't be able to watch just one season.
Will update once I get this in my hot little hands. I have a feeling that I will be very pleased with my purchased!",1418860800,,1803,4.5
6609471,5,B00N46CU2I,"First, the show is fantastic. I watched every episode and honestly cannot wait to watch it again. The setup for this collection is nice (i.e everything it comes with). Yes, it sucks that it does not come with season 7, but it just finished and this makes a great christmas gift. Plus, ohh yea, I GOT IT ON SALE FOR $100 ON BLURAY!!!! I couldn't pass up this chance.",1418860800,2,365,4.304347826086956
6609472,5,B00N46CU2I,"This show broke new ground and certainly went out on top.  The buzz never died.

Primarily I'm writing this on the day of the $99.00 complete set purchase w/coupon code for free 7th Season when it comes out.
Noting that this set has space set aside for the seventh and final season discs so your collection will be complete for an unbeatable price for blu-ray.

I ordered this today, overnighted it, and it's already shipped and my code arrived in my email box.  I immediately went to Amazon and pre-ordered the 7th Season and entered the promotional code and it worked like a charm.  My order is costing me $0.  I had noted a couple of comments about the code not working and mine worked fine.

6609474,5,B00N46CU2I,"The subject matter is not what I would expect to like-- motorcycles, guns, drugs, gangs.  However, I love good drama and Sons of Anarchy delivers.  Charlie Hunnam and Katey Sagal are superb, as are the other supporting members of the cast.  Be prepared for plenty of violence, but taken in context it is appropriate.  One scene early in the series should have earned Katey Sagal an Emmy.  The series deserves high praise for its memorable characters and riveting action.  A boxed set is the perfect way to deal with the many season-end cliffhangers.  Enjoy!",1418860800,2,557,4.861702127659575

I just needed to put in the code. I tried doing that, but it won't let me. I contacted Amazon, to ask them what I should do. They told me that they cant do anything about the code. I should of used the code when I ordered the box set. Well how was I suppose to know, plus I got the code after everything was processed. Now I have a $5 off coupon to use.

6609500,3,B00N46CU2I,I only received 6 DVDs the nice wood box did not come with the shipment.it was a Christmas gift for the wife she loved it but I know she would have loved it more in the wood case,1418342400,,178,3.710526315789474
6609501,5,B00N46CU2I,It looked like this product was sitting by creator Kurt Sutter on the Afterward program after the last episode aired on Dec 9.  I immediately searched Amazon.com and found/ordered it.  It arrived safely.  Discs for first six seasons are in their place and empty slots are there for the soon to be released final season. My only disappointment is the shipping container.  Open it and contents carefully!  There was a few inches room in the outer shipping container which allowed the contents to shift and scuff damage the ammo box (one of the fold creases in bottom left has two inch tear). The reaper box contains the book with discs and it is heavy. The cardboard light brown ammo box holds the reaper box tightly and all of this is shrink wrapped. Then it was placed in its own shipping container.  This box was inside the Amazon container and shifting.,1418342400,2,855,4.666666666666667

6609504,5,B00N46CU2I,"I got it on time, LOVE the packaging that the discs come in!  Very cool looking.  I can't wait to get started watching Season 1!  I've forgotten how it all started and on TV, right now, it's the final season (Season 7).  So I wanna start over and see what leads up to Season 7.  It was a good price for all six seasons.  Thank you!",1417996800,6,331,3.9393939393939394
6609505,5,B00N46CU2I,"This series is a treasure to me.  The price was much lower than I expected to pay.. The set of DVD's arrived in beautiful condition and much quicker than I expected.  I have already had many happy hours of watching my favorite TV program with more to come.  I was amazed that I was able to find one seller that had all six seasons available.  I thought I would have to buy each one individually.  This was a great deal for me.

Thanks so much.
