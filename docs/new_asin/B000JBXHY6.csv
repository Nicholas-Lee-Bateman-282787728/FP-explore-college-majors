8149426,4,B000JBXHY6,"I love Italian sports cars and have a couple of Alfa Romeos. This is a pretty nice video about both ALFAs and Ferraris. You may wonder why these two makes?  ALFA was the father of Ferrari.....Enzo Ferrari was a race driver for Alfa Romeo and won races. He  went on to create his own company but always had respect for the company that gave him his start. This is the story of two amazing companies that had to weather much hardship, surviving wars, politics, ups and downs in the economy but are survivors with cars that people admire as both amazing machines as well as gorgeous works of art. I would give it another star if they covered a few more of the cars but I know hey were limited time wise.....maybe it would have been better to have two different videos but that takes nothing away from this one.",1517011200,,807,4.373333333333333

8149428,4,B000JBXHY6,"If you'e into quality cars, you probably won't be disappointed with this DVD. The photography is very good, the narrator professional and informative. Lots of historic racing footage. The DVD is divided into three parts: Ferrari, Alfa Romeo, and Extras (8 clips, mostly Ferrari). The Ferrari and Alfa parts runs about 24 minutes each, the Extras 40 minutes. The Extras were all produced in Italy, and offer some unique glimpses of the Ferrari brand. I've watched this DVD several times without being bored.",1305417600,,506,5.108433734939759
