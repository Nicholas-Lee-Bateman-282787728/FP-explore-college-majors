8709706,3,B00VA327Y8,"This is the third volume of ""4 Kid Favorites: Cartoon Network Hall of Fame"" featuring four discs of out-of-print re-distributions that include the first discs of Season 1 of ""Ed, Edd n Eddy"" and Season 1 of ""The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy"".  However, and according to product reviews from others, the collection also has disc one (not two) of ""Dexter's Laboratory: Season 1"" and worse yet, ""Codename: Kids Next Door Sooper Huge Missions File 1"" not the harder-to-find ""File 2"" which I also find greatly disappointing.  So unless you have the full season sets of those DVD's, I suggest you don't but this.  But more importantly, I really think Cartoon Network better get their stuff together and create more season sets for these shows and more already on DVD (thankfully, ""Courage the Cowardly Dog"" is being continued for instance), plus shows that are still not on DVD (Do you know how long I'm waiting for a ""Cow and Chicken"" DVD set ?!).  Well, at least this collection is for those who missed out on getting the full sets which they'll have to make do for the time being.",1456617600,3,1083,4.684210526315789
8709707,2,B00VA327Y8,"When the DVD set arrived at my house the day before Christmas, I opened it and there were only 2 dvds in it; kids next door and Dexter laboratory. I was and still am upset that I was miss led.",1451174400,4,192,3.825
8709708,2,B00VA327Y8,"Glad to see that CN and Warner Bros. Home Video are re-releasing classic CN DVDs, sad to see that they put no effort into them. The packaging is cheap and isn't great. The discs come stacked on-top of each other on one holder in the case. Rather than including Dexter's Lab Season 1 Disc 2 and Codename: KND Sooper Hugest Missions File Two (as advertised), it instead included Dexter's Lab Season 1 Disc 1 which was already re-released on CN Hall of Fame #1, and Codename: KND  Sooper Hugest Missions File One which was already re-released on the CN Hall of Fame #2 DVD. Sad to see that they don't put much effort into releasing older shows, this is a big screw-up.",1437955200,5,665,4.450819672131147
8709709,1,B00VA327Y8,"When this product arrive my house today, I was so excited. When I opened up the dvd case, it was only the repeats from disc 1, every single disc 1 even dexters lab, and file one and ed edd n eddy from the first cartoon network hall of fame. Cartoon Network/Warner Bros should be ashamed of themselves for giving us a second copy of the first cartoon network hall of fame...",1437004800,9,373,4.267605633802817
8709710,4,B00VA327Y8,"I purchased this DVD for the sake of reliving some of what I remember watching all the time on Cartoon Network. So far, this DVD meetsactually, HALF of my expectations, but still a worthwhile DVD nonetheless.

Now, WHY did I say that half of my expectations were met with this DVD set? This will also explain my 4-star rating with this DVD. The product descriptions said that this DVD would contain the second disc of Dexter's Laboratory, Season 1, along with File Two of Codename: Kids Next Door.  In actuality, it contains the FIRST disc of DL, S1, and File ONE of C:KND. I understand if this is a deal breaker for you, especially for those who own the first one or two of the previous CN hall of fame volumes. And yes, I DO find it a touch irritating that File One is included in this set instead of the much rarer File Two DVD of C:KND. However, I have no problems with this. Think about it. Disc 2 of DL, S1 has only 5 episodes, whereas Disc 1 has 8, AND that File Two has 7 episodes, while File One has 10. In my case, the more episodes, the merrier, I guess. Of course, it IS possible to see if a replacement disc program can be arranged with this compilation set, since that was done with some of the past DVD's, such as Tiny Toon Adventures, Vol. 4.

But now, on to the other good stuff about this set. The DVD for Ed, Edd, n Eddy is the first disc of the First Season set, unlike in the first Hall of Fame set where the DVD for EEnE is the ""Fools' Par-Ed-Dise"" set. Finally, The disc for the Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy is probably the primary reason I wanted to buy this DVD set. And I'm happy to report that the disc pertaining to B&M is Disc 1 of the long out-of-print, extremely rare first season set. If any of you are fans of B&M but could not afford whatever copy of the first season set you could find online, consider this compilation as your safest alternative. :) Whether you are a fan of any one of these shows and just want to support them or just want to relive some of your nostalgia of the old Cartoon Network, this is worth the money overall. And when you get down to it, it has two discs that would each otherwise be ridiculously expensive when you can just find them here at half of this compilation's price. What more could you ask for? (Aside from the possibility of the replacement program I suggested earlier, of course).",1436918400,9,2361,4.2538975501113585
