2838861,5,B000QGDJG0,"Charlie Chan was originally created by novelist Earl Derr Biggers (1884-1933), who very loosely based the character on Hawaii's legendary police officer Chang Apana (1887-1933.) Biggers wrote six novels in all, and after several false starts 20th Century Fox (then simply known as Fox) hit on the right combination of actors, mystery, and comedy.  The result was perhaps the single most popular film series Hollywood ever created.

Contemporary audiences tend to view the films as politically incorrect, but the fact remains that Chan and his family--most often personified by Keye Luke as son Lee--were among the very few positive Asian characters on American movie screens at the time; as such they were particularly popular with Asian-American audiences of the day. Volume 3 of the 20th Century Fox collection rounds out the surviving films starring Warner Oland, who was the original series Chan.

Several Chan films have been lost; the earliest still in existence is THE BLACK CAMEL, the second in the series.  Based directly on the Biggers novel of the same name, this 1931 release finds Chan investigating the murder of a Hollywood star in Hawaii.  Loosely suggested by the William Taylor Desmond murder and filmed partly on location, THE BLACK CAMEL is atypical of most Chan films--and all the more interesting for that.  It also has the fortune of Bela Lugosi as Warner Oland's co-star, and Lugosi and Oland have unexpected chemistry.  Released in 1936, CHARLIE CHAN'S SECRET is a story of a missing heir, a woman who is under the influence of ""spirtualists,"" and features seances, a creepy mansion, and lots of foolish-but-fun plot turns.  Although not one of the best Chan films, it is among my own favorites.

Released in 1938, CHARLIE CHAN ON BROADWAY and CHARLIE CHAN AT MONTE CARLO were the last two Chan films made starring Oland, who died not long after.  Both films feature Keye Luke as son Lee Chan.  ON BROADWAY finds Chan doing battle with a murderous blackmailer in New York; it is among the better films in the series, slick and well executed.  AT MONTE CARLO finds Chan seeking stolen bonds--and plunging into a mixture of blackmail and murder as a result.  While it tends to be a bit slower than most Chans, it too is enjoyable.

Fox has done very well by the Chan films in the past, but on this occasion the studio has really knocked itself in terms of bonuses.  There are the usual, expertly made ""featurettes"" on various aspects of the series, but on this occasion two films (BLACK CAMEL and SECRET) have very erudite, entertaining commentaries.  The set also includes items of interest: a print of BEHIND THAT CURTAIN, a very early Chan film that is not properly part of the series, and a re-creation via stills and dialogue of the lost film CHARLIE CHAN'S CHANCE.  Regretfully, BEHIND THAT CURTAIN is a dire film and best left to hardcore fans, and the recreation of CHANCE is more akin to an Ed Wood film than a Chan film--but Fox gets points for effort.  The restorations are not flawless, but they are much better than other prints; recommended for Chan fans everywhere!

2838862,5,B000QGDJG0,"First, let me say that the CHARLIE CHAN DVDs (all 3 recent Volumes by FOX and the 6-disc earlier ""CHANTHOLOGY"" set by MGM ... also the 2 latest MR. MOTO Volumes) are of SUPERB quality restoration and the DVD Box artwork is OUTSTANDING! HOWEVER ... being a 'collector' it would be considerate of FOX (who was the frontrunner in producing and offering those wonderful Multi-thin-pak DVD sets ... TWILIGHT ZONE, LOST IN SPACE, VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA, etc) to respect the fact that they are 'killing' us collectors with these ""concrete brick-sized"" collector's Box Sets!!!! PLEASE (ALL CORPORATE DVD COMPANIES) - start (or continue) using Thin-Pak, or the Fold-open book-like DVD sets (as done with TV's ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN, WILD WILD WEST, THE UNTOUCHABLES, the latest JAMES BOND COLLECTION, MGM's TARZAN COLLECTION, HAWAII FIVE-0, TV's MISSION IMPOSSIBLE ... etc)! We collectors appreciate having MORE SPACE ON OUR SHELVES ... so that we can HAVE MORE SPACE to add MORE DVD SETS to our collections!!! The WORST abomination of ""HUGE packaging"" was MGM's CHARLIE CHAN ""CHANTHOLOGY"" (4-inches in width & 6-Discs)! This could have easily been collected in ONE STANDARD SIZE DVD SNAP-CASE (and onto 3 double sided DVDs instead of 6)... using less than half-an inch of materials! In all forms of our lives we need to CONSERVE whenever possible, so material-wise, space-wise ... this is certainly the way to go (and it would also be a lot cheaper to produce!!!!). Here is my list of the latest horrendously 'OVER-SIZED' DVD-Sets (which I would GLADLY REPLACE with newer COMPACT versions): CHAN'S ""CHANTHOLOGY"", CHAN BOX SETS 1-3, ALIEN ""QUADRILOGY"", INDIANA JONES ""COMPLETE MOVIE COLLECTION"", MR MOTO BOX SETS 1 & 2, ""ORIGINAL"" STAR WARS TRILOGY, PLANET OF THE APES ""LEGACY COLLECTION"", BATMAN ""MOVIE ANTHOLOGY"" .... and I could surely add others. So, PLEASE (DVD Companies) ... DOWNSIZE, DOWNSIZE!!
Whew! Again, all of these sets are well-produced, but please make our sets more collectible and shelf-friendly.

Thank you.",1186185600,2,2026,5.1580547112462005
2838863,5,B000QGDJG0,"Well, it must be taking a long time to refinish these Classics. I'm sure I am not alone in hoping that the big wigs at 20th Century Fox are working on the Sidney Toler movies next ?  Even though I have all 42 films, they are reproduction from old tv like tcm or fox movie channel, I love the transfer on the Warner Oland films that have been released and will be happy to re-purchase them and the forthcoming Toler films just because of the packaging and extras. If anyone knows whats up with the Toler films made by 20th century being released soon, let me know !!  I am also looking forward to the reproduction of Charlie Chans Chance...that oughta be good !

2838864,5,B000QGDJG0,"Just when you thought it was over, Fox has released a 4th and final installment in the Warner Oland Charlie Chan series. Thank you Fox. This set contains several very important Chan films. The Black Camel is the second Oland outing (Carries On is lost and only a Spanish version exists with Spanish actors), so this is a very important film in the Chan genre. It also contains what has been considered by many fans another ""lost"" film, SECRET and ends with the final Oland entry MONTE CARLO that has a hilarious scene with #1 son Keye Luke's rear end on fire.

There is still a missing Oland film and Like CARRIES ON may be lost forever. MGM has released the first 6 (and the least interesting) of the Sidney Toler WWII Chan films--which are overly cautious. The pre-war Fox Toler outings are still waiting for release. Let's hope they will be forthcoming, so many of them are highly entertaining and much better made than the Monogram counterparts released on CHANTHOLOGY.

Thanks again FOX. Let's see some more!",1181865600,25,1013,4.685393258426966

The Warner Oland cycle is now complete.  The special interest groups that scared the Fox Movie Channel into not showing re-mastered editions of the Charlie Chan films back in 2003 have ultimately failed.  With the release of Vol 3, ALL the Warner Oland Chan films (not counting the lost ones) are available on DVD for all who want to see them.

Earl Derr Biggers was born in Warren Ohio in 1884. In high school he founded a monthly magazine and went to Harvard. After graduating he became a newspaper reporter, then turned to writing novels. While on vacation in Honolulu he learned about the exploits of Chang Apana, a Chines detective on the Honolulu police force. Biggers wrote six Charlie Chan novels that were successful. His death from a stroke in 1933 ended his career. Five movies were produced before his death. Over forty movies featured Charlie Chan. They were popular in areas with ethnic Chinese populations. Movies that portrayed Chinese in a negative manner were banned in China, such as the Fu Manchu movies. Werner Olands Chan movies were popular in China.

In recent times the popularity of detective stories has waned, unless they are on a police force instead of a owner-operated business. How many movies show a private investigator who clears the innocent and reveals the guilty? Warner Oland was the first actor to star in this popular series. This volume contains five movies plus background information. For more information read Ken Hankes book Charlie Chan at the Movies and Yunte Huangs book Charlie Chan. The Charlie Chan movies used to be shown on local television stations decades ago. TV prefers films in color instead of the monochrome common to many films before the 1960's. You should enjoy these as examples of mystery movies. See the individual reviews for more details.

Disc 1: Charlie Chans Secret (1936) - murder over inheritance of an estate.
Disc 2: Charlie Chan on Broadway (1937) - murder and corruption in show business.

Most are just over an hour long, so they move right along, avoiding all the sidebars that plague modern films.  That means you won't have trouble keeping up with the plot, though there are a couple of episodes that lost me temporarily.  The Warner Oland films run from the late twenties until his death in 1938 and there are several films with disclosures regarding the quality of the restoration, but if you are familiar with films of this period, you will have already budgeted for that.

2838920,5,B000QGDJG0,"Before there was Oland, before there was Toler, before there was the regrettable, minor studio, Winters, there was  Korean American actor, E. L. Park, in the 1929 Behind That Curtain. I want, here, only to point that out to those who have a need to see all of Chan, as well as those who are interested in the development of Talking Films. As to the latter, we see in this film, that early style of careful, fully articulated sentences, formal presentation of each bit of action and speech, which makes dialogue seem so very artificial to modern ears. The script, based on the book by Chan's literary creator, Earl Derr Biggers, is different from that used in the later Fox picture of the same name, and is richly infused with attitudes still  pre-eminent in the audience of that day with regard to the behavior of Decent Women and of Gentlemen. Interesting, too, are the appearances of Warner Baxter as co-star and Boris Karloff as his man-servant, both to be so prominent in the developing films of the thirties. The other co-star, Lois Moran (March 1, 1909 - July 13, 1990) is another of historical interest, since her career, begun in the early twenties, did not survive the early days of the talking picture.(As Wiki points out, she is also known for her affair with Scott Fitzgerald while he was married to Zelda.)
Oh, yes, as regards to Charlie Chan, no doubt this is the most authentic Chan on film, E.L. Park looking and sounding more like what a Chan might have been in reality. Unfortunately (or, perhaps, fortunately) he appears only by reference to him earlier in the film, and is on-screen only for a minute or two in the closing segment.
As to the general audience appeal, today, it is that of a well-constructed, rather constricted, historically relevant film, which will have little appeal to those who have nothing in mind but to watch with the same mindset as they have toward CSI or other current (2014) production.",1405209600,,1934,4.702064896755163

against the finest Toler films that followed : Monte Carlo and Charlie Chan on
 Broadway, which I think may be as good as the Toler film Murder Cruise, which I rate
as the very best Chan film of them all.  It's rather amazing how well the video has
withstood the ravages of time, unlike most of the old color films. Charlie Chan is
very appropriate in B&W, fortunately. I think I've watched Murder Cruise and Broadway
a dozen times apiece and probably could quote most of the dialog by heart. Chan
is simply pleasant to watch. No histrionics, just gentle and wise behavior, which some
braindead PC meisters somehow manage to find ""racially offensive."" Apparently these folks
think immigrant Chinese elders should sound like Midwesterners. Amazing.",1392163200,,830,4.879432624113475

2838951,4,B000QGDJG0,"The third in Fox's not-quite-chronological collection of restored Charlie Chan films actually offers five - or more accurately, five-and-a-half - films from the series' glory years.

The only surviving Warner Oland film based directly on one of Earl derr Biggers' novels, The Black Camel isn't one of Charlie Chan's better cases. Oland's second Chan film offers a promising mystery loosely inspired by the murder of director William Desmond Taylor and a cast of colourful characters - movie stars, publicists, Bela Lugosi's Hollywood psychic, Murray Kinnell's beach bum painter and an unbilled Dwight Frye's butler (Renfield and Dracula together again!) - but the end result is still a bit awkward. A good joke about lie detectors notwithstanding, the aphorisms feel forced (""There is old saying, 'Death is a black camel that kneels unbidden at every gate.' Tonight black camel knelt here""), Oland's performance seems impatient and rushed and while Fox may have shot on location in Hawaii, much of the film comes down to confrontations in drawing rooms. There's no Number One or Number Two Son this time round, but there is an unfortunately idiotic comic relief Japanese sidekick that seems to indicate the studio hadn't quite made it's mind up about whether they wanted to go with the inscrutable or the asinine Oriental stereotypes and decided to have their cake and eat it. Robert Young makes his screen debut while Hamilton MacFadden not only directs but plays a film director in the film as well.

Along with an audio commentary by Ken Hanke and John Cork and a stills gallery, the extras also offer a reconstruction of one of the missing Chan films, Charlie Chan's Chance, with actors reading the script over an extensive collection of stills from the film. It's a shame this is still missing, because it's a decent one, though the presentation works surprisingly well, the dialogue-heavy script giving it the feel of an old-time radio show.

""Hasty conclusion like ancient egg - look good from outside.""

1936's Charlie Chan's Secret is one of the best of Warner Oland's Chan movies, seeing the Honolulu detective hired to track down a missing heir who turns up dead at a s&eacute;ance. Naturally everyone present has a motive, from the relatives who'll have to account for how they've been spending his money in his absence to the caretaker whose daughter committed suicide when he jilted her. Well, almost everyone since it's pretty obvious that the butler at least didn't do it since he's played by the ever dashing and courageous Herbert Mundin, who's a joy to watch here. He's not the only one who's in good form either, with Oland, for once going it alone without the family, giving one of his best turns in the series with a rather more subtle and naturalistic performance than later efforts: his underplayed shocked reaction to a brush with death is certainly not as cavalier here as in other entries. The plot developments and identity of the killer may not exactly be surprising but it's all executed so well that it never really matters, with the film's lean 72-minute running time ensuring it never has time to lose the attention. You can also spot Rosina Lawrence, Stan and Ollie's leading lady in Way Out West, in the supporting cast while the atmospheric cinematography is by future director Rudolph Mate (D.O.A., When Worlds Collide).

Although Fox's DVD is preceded by `best available materials' warning, the picture quality is for the most part excellent and there are only minor issues with the soundtrack. Decent extras include an audio commentary by Ken Hanke and John Cork, featurettes on Chan's role in the rise of modern detective fiction and on Taiwanese-American forensic expert Dr Henry Lee and a stills gallery.

""Have the band blast at somethin' Oriental. Hey, what is the Chinese national anthem anyway?""
""I don' know. Why don't you give 'em 'Chinatown, My Chinatown?'""

Charlie Chan on Broadway is a slick number that sees Charlie arriving in New York on the same ship as a woman whose diary can put half the mobsters, politicians and crooked cops in the Big Apple behind bars. When she naturally turns up dead in nightclub owner Douglas Fowley's office, the diary goes missing and Number One Son is among the suspects, it's a foregone conclusion that the honorable detective will solve the case. Luckily it was candid camera night at the club, so there's plenty of photographic evidence to play with, and a wide cast of New York stereotypes to play with, from Harold Huber's brash cop, J. Edward Bromberg's creepy editor among the suspects, Leon Ames' upmarket gangster, Marc Lawrence's shifty ex-husband and the bickering duo of Donald Woods' ace reporter and Joan Marsh's fast-talking hotshot photographer (""I want to shoot you before somebody else does!""). It's a pleasingly pacey and punchy little number, director Eugene Ford keeps it moving along nicely and the killer's identity is a genuine surprise in this one.

It's a bit easier to see the problems Fox faced restoring this one: while it's a clear, sharp transfer the evidence of serious water damage on the source print is there if you look for it in the form of some fluctuation in places, but for once DNR has been applied sensibly and sensitively to try to restore the image rather than wax it over. A decent extras package includes a half-hour featurette on Chan's worldwide travels (without ever leaving the Fox backlot), a shorter appreciation of Chan's aphorisms and a stills gallery.

""Perhaps now we catch lion in mousetrap. Or lioness.""

Charlie Chan at Monte Carlo would turn out to be Warner Oland's swansong in the role, and while it's not a particularly good entry in the series it's a decent enough time filler that benefits from high production values and the kind of polished production that hides some of the story's lack of inspiration. This time round Charlie and his Number One Son get mixed up in a murder and the theft of a million dollars in bonds while stopping off in the principality en route to Paris, uncovering the usual suspects - women living beyond their means, speculators, blackmailers and gamblers - in a case that never seems to matter quite as much as it should. The standout performance this time round comes from Harold Huber, taking time out from playing the brash New York detective and going for a change of pace as the courteous and obliging head of the Monaco police force complete with a surprisingly convincing French accent. It's not a series highlight but it's not a bad way for Oland to bow out.

Extras include a couple of stills galleries and a featurette on Oland (who knew he and his wife made their money translating Strindberg's plays?) which includes footage of Oland in Shanghai, but it's disappointingly light on details about the aborted production of Charlie Chan at the Ringside and his subsequent unexpected death that's covered in much more detail in a much better featurette on Mr Moto's Gamble. However, the most intriguing extra is the first Fox Charlie Chan film...

It's not altogether surprising that Fox have hidden away the studio's first Charlie Chan film, 1929's Behind that Curtain, as an extra on the B-side of their DVD of Charlie Chan at Monte Carlo - it's a film of more historical interest than entertainment value. A stilted early talkie, it's not even a Charlie Chan movie as such, more a movie with Charlie Chan in it very briefly at the end (played here by Korean actor E.L. Park). Instead the lead sleuthing duties go the wooden Gilbert Emery as Sir Frederick Bruce of Scotland Yard (as he helpfully reminds people). Aside from, uh, his very, uh, slow and, uh, affected, uh, manner of speech, you've, uh, never seen an actor quite so obsessed with playing with props: slippers, pipes, cigarettes, globes, nothing is safe when he's around - at one point he even stops to tie up his shoes mid-sentence to distract the audience's attention from the other actor in the scene. It's as if he's unable to speak unless he's stroking something. Even Peter Cushing at his busiest has nothing on Emery here when it comes to prop fondling. But even Emery can't compete with the truly surreal moment where Philip Strange's caddish errant husband looks at the camera for 15 seconds with an expression caught somewhere between lechery and incontinence before following after a sluttish serving girl. It's even more bizarre than the twitch he develops in his last scene.

For the most part it's a chamber piece played by forgotten and forgettable actors (though Boris Karloff, who would later get co-starring above-the-title billing in Charlie Chan at the Opera, appears as an Indian servant). Most of the cast are playing for enunciation rather than emotional truth, leaving Warner Baxter the most convincing screen presence as the explorer and jilted suitor who may be the fall guy for the murderer of a lawyer who had incriminating documents on him, among others - or may be the guilty party. He's not even particularly good, but in this company he really doesn't have to be. Not that any of them are helped out by the clumsily melodramatic direlogue of the ""I love you, I love you, I love you"" variety they have to deliver or the unconvincing script that replaces the novel's trio of detectives competing to solve a mystery with a standard drawing room romantic triangle. The whodunit angle is dispensed with a third into the picture, leaving the villain's wife's mystifying reluctance to divorce him for fear of the scandal to provide what passes for suspense as it drags its heels through a series of overlong conversations in country houses in England, tents in Persia and elevators and lecture halls in San Francisco.

It's the kind of almost relentlessly static movie that made many observers at the time believe that talkies really might just be a passing fad if they were all such a giant leap backwards in terms of visual technique and pace. Apart from the establishing shots there's no visual imagination in its staging: people either have lengthy conversations sitting down or standing up while the camera remains motionless or, if director Irving Cummings was feeling really adventurous, have conversations while some are standing up and others sitting down at the same time while the camera remains motionless. With the exception of one horseback dialogue scene the camera never moves when anyone speaks, and they speak a lot, making a brief scene when Lois Moran runs along a crowded San Francisco street seem like a jolt of real life in a waxwork museum. And it's sluggishly slow, feeling like a 65-minute script dragged out to the 90-minute mark by the slow, monotonous delivery of most of the cast. (There was a shorter silent version made at the same time to hedge the studio's bets, but that is apparently still lost.)

This was actually Chan's third screen appearance after a serial version of The House Without a Key and a Universal adaptation of The Chinese Parrot directed by Paul Leni, both of which also reduced him to a minor supporting character, but with Park having next to nothing to do in his three minutes of screen time and doing it very mechanically it's no surprise that it would take another two years and the casting of Warner Oland to kick off the series proper.",1345507200,4,11273,4.891679748822606

This is a unique Chan movie:  it is a love story;  you soon learn who the murderer is; and, Chan is played by a relatively unknown actor, and oddly enough, Chan doesn't appear until very late in the movie, and briefly at that.  However, in spite of that, this is a great movie.  This Special Feature is on the flip-side of the 'Charlie Chan at Monte Carlo' disk.

'Charlie Chan at Monte Carlo' (1938) - Missing bonds provide the motive and language misunderstandings provide the comedy.  Ironically, Oland's last words in this movie are, ""Good Bye!""  This was Oland's last movie.

'Charlie Chan on Broadway' (1937) - A notorious woman returns to New York with a diary she wants to open to a buyer, but there are many who would pay bullets to keep the book closed.  Someone was ready to pay bug bucks, but it was too late ...

'Charlie Chan's Secret' (1935) - The heirs had thought Colby had died years ago, but then they learn that he was only missing.  Now they learn, that his ship went down near Hawaii; did he survive?

Sol was in big demand in Hollywood in the 20' and 30's as musical director, performer, actor, and as a talent scout for Hawaiian and polynesian themed movies.  I marvel at the fact that the two male commentators were watching the complete movie and were not at all moved  by the shear beauty of Sol's music to even make any comment about it.

2838970,4,B000QGDJG0,"After watching these movies,you will be coming up with alot of Chan aphorisms like that one...but probably much,much better!
This box set includes:
Charlie Chan's Secret,Charlie Chan on Broadway,Charlie Chan at Monte Carlo,Behind That Curtain(1929,the first appearance of the Chan character at Fox),The Black Camel and Charlie Chan's Chance(a recreation of what this lost film might have looked like).
I haven't seen any of these films in at least 50 years but they have lost none of their charm and heart and that is in BIG part to Warner Oland himself. I have seen Oland,Toler and Winters each playing the famous detective. In my oppinion the latter two just tried hard to imitate Oland but fell far short of the mark. They didn't have the dignity,heart,warmth nor comportment the way Oland did. In fact I have seen very few actors immerse themselves in their characters as much as he did. I would even dare say that after a time the two almost became inseperable. I know relatively little of Warner Oland's career except that I know he had played Oriental parts in previous years and that there was at one stage a walk off of a film set by the actor and then his eventual return to Sweden. He was having personal problems,alot of it brought on by alcohol. By today's standards one might say he was burned out. In the end he never returned and died in his homeland. Tragic,for his family and the public,as we lost a very talented man that day in 1938.
I recall reading but never finishing a Derr Biggers Charlie Chan novel. The reason? I had watched a couple of Oland Chan's before hand. Big mistake. I found the character in the books to be different than the on screen character fleshed out with such panache by Oland. It is one of the few times I have committed the literary sin of preferring the movie over the book. That is the impact Oland had on me and that impact has only been heightened considerably with the release of this and the other Oland Chan
films by Fox.
Each film has been transferred over to DVD using the best available source material on hand at Fox. There is a definite difference in the quality from one film to the next but the age of one particular film compared to another matters little. As I said it's the quality of the material on hand which makes it or breaks it. Some are very clean and crisp while others are quite grainy. However ALL are visually quite clear.
Fox seems to have done the best they can with what they have. When one considers that four versions are seemingly lost we should be thankful to at least have these films.
Finally all these sets come with many featurettes that are sure to delight even the most casual Chan fan. As is my practice I have not seen them yet but I am looking forward to viewing them all at a later time.
In conclusion I highly recommmend these Warner Oland Charlie Chan box sets to one and all. It is a must have for all Charlie Chan fans and for those who have never seen them I will tell you that you are in for a special treat. And for those curious enough to want to see the later Chan actors to compare I would advise you to rent if you can. If not possible just buy one or two and see how you like them. But I think it will become apparent very quickly that THESE Chans with the magnificent and talented Warner Oland will become,like me,your favourites too!",1201478400,5,3339,4.448613376835237
2838971,4,B000QGDJG0,"As long as viewers understand that these movies were produced at a time when racial sensitivites were very different that now, they are entertaining films.  Watching the extra features puts the racial issues in the social context of the time.  Interviews with Asian-American actors are positive and historically informative.",1200268800,,324,5.591836734693878
2838972,5,B000QGDJG0,"Once again Warner Oland pulls off the third box set with absolute brilliance!  These movies are great family movies and for any Charlie Chan fan.  Too bad so many of them were lost because we are missing out on many, many of his movies.  He brings this detective to life for all of us and he does it with charm and grace.  Wonderful acting and just pure fun to watch over and over again.",1200096000,,387,4.1891891891891895
2838973,4,B000QGDJG0,This was a Christmas gift for my father-in-law who is an avid Charlie Chan fan. I got it for him because there were two movies he didn't have. I got to watch them with him and found them very entertaining. Considering when the movies were made the video was very good. The other movies were superior in quality to the other movies he had from the tv.  This is an excellent addition to any Charlie Chan fan's collection. I also got it on Amazon at almost half the price of a video catalog's price.,1199664000,,496,4.276595744680851
2838974,5,B000QGDJG0,"If you're looking for an evening of good old fashion entertainer with plot twists and suspense without the gore, Charlie Chan movies make you laugh and enjoy as the detective ""ponders"" and ""solves"" each crime episode.

2838976,4,B000QGDJG0,"I was delighted to finally get the 3rd box set of Charlie Chan flixs.  Other than the ""Black Came"" being fairly lame - it's 1931 production date is probably the reason - this is a great companion to the other box sets. The add-on features were not quite as good as with sets 1 and 2; but it's probably because they were running out of interesting information.",1199318400,,359,4.358208955223881

2838979,5,B000QGDJG0,"I love the Chans, but Fox could have packaged them better. 12 movies, each about 75 minutes, could have put in one box set with slim cases and only taken up about a quarter of the room that these take up. Of course, greedy Fox Video has to bleed the public for every penny they have, so it's understandable why they did it and when the Sidney Toler Chans come out on DVD, then 3 more volume box sets will take up even more space!",1192406400,,429,4.0588235294117645

2838982,5,B000QGDJG0,This is another great set of Charlie Chan Movies.  The plots and characters are interesting as are the settings.  I hope that they have access to some more of these movies to make another set.  This is a very enjoyable way to spend some time.  Warner Oland was a very talented actor.  It is a shame that he died when he did.  He could have continued this character in many more enjoyable Charlie Chan movies.,1190851200,,408,4.373333333333333
2838983,5,B000QGDJG0,Fox has done an excellant job restoring the Warner Oland Charlie Chan Moviess in this collection.  As an extra they recreated a lost Charlie Chan Movie by having people read the script while still photos appear on the screen.  The only problem that I had with this was the person ding the voice of Chan was poor.  It would have been better to have had a well known asian actor do the voice like Mako.  Definately this volume is a must get for any Charlie Chan Fan.,1190505600,5,464,4.2988505747126435

2838986,5,B000QGDJG0,"Fox has done a wonderful job of cleaning up the old films and producing very good DVDs of these old Chan films.  The commontaries they have put together add real insight into the world as it was when these films were produced.  Chan films were actually one of the first Hollywood offerings to show a non-white character (Charlie Chan) as intelligent, honorable, and insightful.  Often he shows up the all white police force proving his superior intelligence.  It is true that Hollywood did not use an actual Asian in the part....but then that was common and is often so even today. The Charlie Chan films show a Chan who honors his Asian heritage, accepting and using the wisdom passed down, while also showing great American patriatism.  Yes the films can be very dated....all films from the 30's and 40's are going to reflect a lot of the attitudes of the time just as today's films reflect the attitudes of our time. But the stories are great and the ""Chanisms"" are often words to live by.  Thank you so much!",1190332800,4,1012,4.625698324022347

2838989,5,B000QGDJG0,"The movies were beautifully, I dare say lovingly restored. It is a pleasure to watch them.

2838991,4,B000QGDJG0,"Chan films are still very entertaining, and their dvd release capitalises on this by decent restorations and nice artwork and packaging. The films in this third collection are uneven but interestingly diverse. My fave is The Black Camel, a more serious Chan film highlighted by some truly beautiful location photography of Hawaii. I must agree with a previous reviewer, however, that you do get a lot of flimsy cardboard and plastic for your money: discs housed in digipacks (rather than the usual junky plastic cases) and a sturdier box would have resulted in a far better package. Although the extra featurettes are a decent attempt to contextualise the movies, they also suffer from a very dull visual sense (lots of talking heads saying little) and a generalised, almost anti-intellectual approach - a more thorough examination of the era and the notion of ""Orientalism"", and the implications of a Swedish actor portraying a Chinese man, could have given the Chan films legitimate historical significance. As it is, you'll probably watch the featurettes once and forget them. At least we have Warner Oland's immensely charming portrayal of Chan to watch again and again.",1188777600,,1174,5.151832460732984

2838993,5,B000QGDJG0,"Just another note, adding to what others have already said.  Kudos to Fox for getting the Chan films out.  Now, they will hopefully bring us the Sidney Toler titles at some point.  MGM's CHANTHOLOGY currently offers the first 6 Sidney Toler Monogram titles, and there are rumors that Warner's is searching for suitable elements for their own release of the final Monogram entries.

2838994,5,B000QGDJG0,"As a tried and true Warner Oland/Sidney Toler fan, I must say that the films that have been released so far are extraordinary. I have enjoyed all the movies thus released except for Behind the Curtain. I think that it was a huge mistake to include this movie in the chantology.  It is not a true Charlie Chan mystery.  It is just a soapy romantic triangle that would best be left on the movie shelf.  Why it was chosen as a ""bonus"" is beyond me.  At least it was on the flip side of Charle Chan in Monte Carlo so that there was not an additional disc which I would have relegated to the circular container. I am waiting for FOX to release the films of Sidney Toler which are, in effect, my favorites.  Let's hope that this happens soon. I don't think that there are any Charlie Chan films made by Sidney Toler that I do not think worthy of becoming boxed sets.",1187568000,,860,4.219512195121951
2838995,5,B000QGDJG0,"I'd like to comment on what a nice job 20th Century Fox has done in putting together all three volumes.  After watching the final volume, it becomes apparent just how carefully they planned it all.  The first volume takes Chan to London, Paris, Egypt, and Shanghai--it's a nice trip, and each movie makes  mention of the previous spot as Chan makes his way from East to West.  The special features spent much time on the real life inspiration for Chan, Chang Apana, and included commentary from Apana's family.  The second volume finds Chan visiting the Circus, the Race Track, the Opera, and Olympics.  The movies themselves and the special features focus a lot of attention on Chan's eldest son and the actor who played him--Keye Luke.

Thematically, the first two volumes stand alone quite well, and the special features are unique to each set--there was little overlap.  It might be tempting to think of the third volume as the leftovers, but that would be a mistake.  The Black Camel is the sole survivor of the first 5 Oland Chan movies, and it gives viewers a super glimpse of the original characterization--Chan is energetic and forceful in a more physical way than in the years to come.  It's great to see that bit of history, and a Chan film with location shooting in Hawaii is a welcome sight.  Charlie Chan's Secret has a spooky house vibe that follows The Black Camel very nicely.  Commentary on the films at last!  Of the twelve films, I think that TBC and CCS were good choices.  Broadway and Monte Carlo are the last two Oland Chans, and there's an excellent featurette on Oland included here.  Thus we see both the beginning and the end of the Oland Chans in this volume.  I haven't mentioned all the special features since Amazon lists them, but I'll just say that once again, we get unique ones with little or no overlap between these and those of the previous volumes.

Fox has made it easy to watch the films in order if you like--pop in The Black Camel, the four films of volume 1, Charlie Chan's Secret, the four films of volume 2, then the last two films of volume 3.  Taken all together, the featurettes give a well rounded view of the original novels and the novelist, the real life inspiration for Chan, some of the directors, and the actors, as well as the broader picture--the Chan books and movies as detective fiction and fictional portrayals of Asian Americans in U.S. culture.  In addition you get a couple of interesting commentaries and 2 extra films that are interesting as pieces of Chan history even if they aren't great cinema (Eran Trece and Behind the Curtain).  And as if all that wasn't enough--the slick green, red, and blue boxes all match and look wonderful together on the shelf.

The breadth of the special features, the thematic approach to the volumes, and the look of the art on boxes and cases should be taken by other studios as the standard for putting together a collection like this.  Bravo 20th Century Fox!",1187481600,43,2964,4.6487523992322455

Park as Chan. This is decent enough, considering its age(1929), but Chan is not the focal point of this, and as such, not a great Chan outing! The other four: The Black Camel, Charlie Chan's Secret, Charlie Chan On Broadway & Charlie Chan In Monte Carlo all star Oland and are all really good!

8196364,5,B000QGDJG0,"I'm not saying that I'm obsessed with Charlie Chan however I do have a copy that I got from eBay when Charlie Chan was not politically correct, a copy off of the television, a copy from England when they were not available in the United States, and now I am collecting the copies that are coming out available in the United States.

This box set contains:
""Charlie Chan's Secret"" (1936) B/W 72 minutes
""Charlie Chan on Broadway"" (1937) B/W 68 minutes
""Charlie Chan at Monte Carlo"" (1937) B/W 72 minutes
""The Black Camel"" (1931) B/W 71 Minutes

Some people nowadays are complacent and expect DVD features or extras. I personally just wanted a copy of Charlie Chan they would not fade away as it does on tape. I thought I was duplicating some of the individual movies that I already own. However it turns out I should have paid more attention to the features. It a delightful surprise to find that these have been digitally restored with HD in mind, and are a lot easier to watch. You notice details that you didn't notice before.

Of course restoration is not the only advantage of this box set. There are several featuretts, still photos, and other goodies. One feature that I was not too thrilled with was the commentary by film critic Ken Hanke and the film historian John Cork; they appear more to be trying to get ""one up"" on each other and don't appear to have a very in-depth history of film as they were describing the set of the Castle in Charlie Chan's secret and completely missed a lot of the points that you would've caught if you had watched old UFA films such as ""The Cabinet of Caligari.""

-------------------------------------------
What is Charlie Chan's Secret?

This film starts out with that familiar 30s mystery sounding music. Then we immediately cut into a diving scene where they used underwater type music. Here Charlie Chan (Warner Oland) is on a boat searching for the missing body of Allen Colby. Allen is the long missing heir to the family fortune and was on his way back to clean it when he met with an accident. Or was it an accident?

Even though the Ouija board said that Allen was dead, we make one last attempt to contact him through a sance. Will Allen show? If so can he point out his killer?

Only Charlie Chan with his unique perspective can make heads or tails of what the secret is all about. Even Charlie has to learn throughout the movie and we learn with him.

This is one of Warner Oland's best. We get a lesson in radio, and quinine that evidently was used at one time for colds.

So let's sit back and enjoy a spooky spirit house, a handful of spooky people, and a shot in the dark.",1508630400,3,2630,4.485355648535565
