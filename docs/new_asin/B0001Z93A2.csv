8018904,3,B0001Z93A2,"I bought three other Project XX DVDs with the ""XX"" at the top of the cover: the Jazz Age, Will Rogers, and Life in the Thirties.  The video and audio quality on those three are excellent. This one is from a print that has scratches and splices. If you're looking for best quality transfer, the one with the XX at the top might be cleaner.",1508889600,,338,4.2

8018906,5,B0001Z93A2,"Narrated by Bob Hope this illustrates the end of the war but problems still arose.  It was a great time for most Americans.
As soon as rationing concluded and you could buy most of whatever was available.  Returning vets added a real rich source of experience and dedication to making up for lost time with education and jobs.  The movie ""The Best years of our lives"" really mirrored the temper of the time.  The shadow of communism and the cold war was just around the corner and began to concern many Americans and this had an impact.  I was fortunate to live through and experience this period of time.  One thing that will always remain with me was the wonderment at the wild celebration at the end of the war.  As I watched with fascination at the goings on, my Father who had been in WWI but was to old to be in WWII put his hand on my shoulder and tersely said: ""Remember what you are looking at because it will never happen again"".  The film ends with the beginning of the Korean War which was termed the forgotten war but now at the sixtieth anniversary of that brutal and bitter conflict it is no longer forgotten.",1375228800,3,1124,4.3701923076923075
8018907,5,B0001Z93A2,"Project Twenty: Not So Long Ago, narrated by Bob Hope, takes an excellent, informative look at the five years of peace between the end of World War Two and the beginning of the war in Korea. The film moves along very well and packs in a lot without ever feeling rushed; I like that! The quality of the footage is excellent and the musical score enhances the documentary.

Although this film runs less than one hour there's so much covered here that I scarcely know where to begin. We see war planes being told to cease fire and turn around at the end of the Second World War in mid-August, 1945; and there's great footage about how these planes were broken down or sometimes melted down to make things like new cars which gradually became more and more available just as food rationing cards faded away. There's still more coverage of the Red Scare including its effect on Hollywood stars; we see motion picture stars flying into Washington, D.C. to take sides before The House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) when a young Congressman named Richard Nixon was just becoming known.

In addition, there is footage of the economic upswing thanks partly to the G.I. Bill and so many young people wanting to start their own family with a home and kids. There was a big housing shortage at the end of World War Two; builders raced to produce new homes and this helped the economy quite a bit. Other highlights include the development of television; the country's fascination with ""flying saucers"" and how so many political analysts were absolutely confident that Dewey would beat Truman in the presidential race of 1948.

It may seem as if I've given it all away; but I assure you that I haven't. There's still more here!

Overall, Project XX: Not So Long Ago is great viewing for anyone studying American history in the mid-20th century; it's very nostalgic as well. I highly recommend this documentary.",1348099200,3,1908,4.7379518072289155
8018908,5,B0001Z93A2,"I used this video when teaching American History and have never forgotten it.  I bought one for myself and my father who went through WW2. The topics are well-chosen, the nostalgia overwhelming.  It's a great look back at a brief, transient period when (to quote the movie) ""the United States stood at the top of the world"".  We're larger, more powerful and more daunting today but we'll never be in the same state of world hegemony again. As Bob Hope observes, ""peace...it was nice while it lasted but someone half a world away had taken it...it was up to us to find it again""
If you lived through the 40's you'll love this....you deserve all the credit.",1218412800,5,655,4.581196581196581
