404664,5,6301973208,"Kim is a movie I remember so well as a kid infact probably my favourite chidhood movie. I found myself one evening searching Amazon's massive dvd vault and for some reason I typed in 'KIM' and I was delighted to see it had been released on dvd. Sometimes revisiting a childhood favourite can be dissapointing as an adult, but not Kim the story is so imaginitive it grips from start to finish. The acting of a young Dean Stockwell as a streetwise street urchin blagging his way through life and finding himself embroiled in espionage reminds me in character of Errol Flynn at his cheekiest. Ironically Flynn co stars as 'Kim's protector Red Beard. Both actors work together so well they draw you into the story set in India during the Raj.

404665,3,6301973208,"Kim based on Rudyard Kipling's adventure book about the young British boy Kim who has lost both his parents and survives in India through theft, begging, and being a messenger.  Kim avoids the British as he has heard that they send their boys to school, but when his identity is revealed he struggles against the system after he is sent to school.  In addition, a holy man who has made a strong impression on Kim encourages him to stay in school in order to help him seek enlightenment.  Simultaneously, there is a war brewing in northern India and Kim seems to play large part in the outcome of this possible bloodshed.  Kim is an interesting film shot in India that teaches some valuable lessons in regards to education and belonging.  Despite having some scenes that seem too staged and stiff, which causes some awkwardness in the story, the film leaves the audience with a good cinematic experience.",1084147200,17,903,4.726114649681529

...nevertheless as good on DVD as I remember it on the big screen when I was a youngster.  During the '50s and '60s, when it played on commercial television, the idiot box artists chopped this film without mercy or sense, squeezing out of it almost all the flavor, and it's great to see *Kim* - admittedly a bit murky on the visual side, a bit twiddled and diddled in the sound department - back in its theatrical version, and in a form that allows for easy replay and scene selection.
Despite the relatively minor role played by the ""real"" Mahbub Ali in Kipling's book, the script's structuring took advantage of Errol Flynn's mature screen presence (as an actor, he most certainly got better as he grew older) to good effect, and did the job without doing any real violence to Kipling's story.  Dean Stockwell's work is only so-so compared with what he *could* produce under proper direction, and while Paul Lukas is as good in this role as you'd expect him to be, I still have more than a bit of trouble thinking of him as a Tibetan lama.
By the bye, could someone please tell us the name of the tune being played as the Mavericks (""a red bull on a green field"") come marching into frame about midway through the movie?  It's the same tune playing at the close of film, and I'm driving myself *nuts* trying to remember what the damned thing is called.  Thanks.

404668,3,6301973208,"This will be a ""mixed"" review. This is a gorgeous film to look at--on-location shooting in India greatly enhances the visual appeal, and the sets and colourful costumes are eye-catching to say the least. The plot, based on Kipling's classic book, concerns a young British, orphaned boy, who disguises himself as an Indian to avoid school and indulge in some espionage for the British, via a shady horse-trader. It takes place during the Victorian period.
The boy--Kim--is played by a very young Dean Stockwell, and his performance is excellent. The horse trader is portrayed by Errol Flynn--older and heavier than during his peak, swashbuckling years at Warner Brothers. While Flynn is top-billed, do not be mislead--this film is about the boy--at the same time, Flynn has lost little of the charm and roguish twinkle that made him such a big star.
What this film needed, however, was more action--beautiful scenery and costumes cannot disguise the fact that this film has too many dull patches.
The DVD is decent--full-screen--nice colour--mono sound, of course.
""Kim"" has its moments--but if you see the name of Errol Flynn on the cover, and expect plenty of exciting action, you may be disappointed.",1062979200,50,1202,5.106598984771574

Flynn plays a part but not the bravado star swinging from limbs altho he is a ladies man. I also have KIM with Pete O'Toole. Frankly, I thought O'Toole overplayed his hand in that version. I much prefer Paul Lukas as the worn out priest. Great scenery. Great fun for the whole family.

He does and says all the things boys love to say and do - and gets away with it. A rollicking good adventure story for both children and adults.

I saw it in the theater when I was 6 or 7 years old, and one scene near the end of the film, with Kim and the old monk, have lived with me as fresh as the day I saw it. It, along with ""The Razor's Edge"" was my introduction to mysticism.

Now, as period action movies go, especially as period action movies involving boys go, this is probably average. The Walt Disney film ""Treasure Island"" was made in the same year, and it was more successful, and more durable, critically. Of course, as Errol Flynn movies go, this is also not one of his best, but then, his part is not that large. Dean Stockwell holds the center of the movie, and does a good job of it.

Somehow, the story lacks a certain tautness, a sense of oncoming fate, either good or bad. A movie of the same period, also based on a Rudyard Kipling story, is ""The Man Who Would Be King"" starring Sean Connery and Michael Caine. The four stars are for mystics, fans of Errol Flynn, fans of period pieces, and wonderfully Technicolored films.

404926,4,6301973208,"I chose to watch this film because I had just realized that Dean Stockwell of TV's Quantum Leap fame was a child star, and he was in this film.  I thought it would be interesting to see on that account alone, but I had also never actually seen Errol Flynn in a movie before.  I thought I'd give it a try.

Flynn and Stockwell were both very good in this movie, and the Rudyard Kipling storyline is also full of complexity and delightful to watch.  As with most pre-Civil Rights Movement films, there might be some racial sterotyping or insensitivity in spots, but I felt that was minimal and that it was useful enough to educate the viewer on what it must have been like to live in 1800's India during the British Colonial occupation.

provides the viewer historic India, before the British Government relinquished rule as India became an independent country,
which is in the past.  More important is the acting of Errol Flynn and young Dean Stockwell which was superb and second to none.
Kipling desired to draw attention to the fact boys of English military and civil service, were indeed orphaned and stranded in the
commonwealth.  It was essential for the British Authorities to have these waifs provided for in a Boarding School or Military School.
Kipling's novel portrays a 12 year old boy, who like other youth as midshipmen on duty in the Navy, or boots on the ground in the
Army, and in civil service, were very capable and reliable to their adult superiors.  Adults often underestimate the character and
abilities of the young to take on responsibility equivalent to a mature adult.  Not only is the Movie a classic of adventure for the family to enjoy, but also a fine example for any American Boy to aspire to significance and maturity.  This movie has a message

As the British Empire's unofficial propagandist, Kipling rode high until WWI's massive losses soured even the English on war.  Kipling, who told a very good story, was one of the first winners of the Nobel Literature Prize. (Much later, Churchill, another warrior-type also won it.)

Besides skilfully telling stories, mainly of the British Tommy [enlisted man], Kipling was a stirring poet too. Perhaps no other since Pindar had quite the same rhythm.

Another British Empire film [also of dated technique] is B&W Gunga Din, in which Cary Grant, had a role. At that stage Grant was not yet the smoothie we now think of. (Gunga Din was originally a Kipling poem.)

Indians and other non-Europeans may reject Kipling's portrayal of Asians as devious and treacherous. Over 100 years later, many westerners still harbor such views of Afghans, who were especially distrusted even then.  All indications are that many Pathans today would still find the image highly flattering and heroic.

Many aspects of the movie make of it a great find. First, it was filmed in India in 1949-14950, shortly after Indian Independence and not in studio like most Technicolor movies of the day. There are remarkable views of India before the great move towards modernity. You would need today a lot of special effects to do the movie, while 60 years ago, plain photography was good enough. Only a few scenes were shot in California. The actors are beautiful to watch, from a very young Dean Stockwell as Kim to Errol Flynn, flamboyant as a red-beard horse merchant with a taste for women, and Academy-award winner Paul Lukas playing a lama who becomes a companion to Kim.
Many children become spies in war times, like Audrey Hepburn in world war 2. R.V. Jones says in his memoirs that many children were pretending to play on the roads while counting the number of tanks and troops in Holland and Belgium. But this story of a young spy has exotic charm as a plus and it does not have the rigid morality rules of the early Disney movies. For instance Flynn (as  Mahbub Ali, the Red Beard) kisses a woman who turns out to be a spy for the other side and .... you got to see this film. It is as good as, say, Indiana Jones.",1348185600,10,1652,4.3462783171521036

405061,4,6301973208,"Although it's never had the reputation as a classic either as an Errol Flynn film or a Rudyard Kipling adaptation, MGM's lavish 1950 adaptation of Kim is a really rather splendid affair, with the star still on good form before his wicked ways took their toll on his health and providing charismatic star power as the mysterious red bearded horse trader Mabub Ali to back up a very impressive Dean Stockwell in the title role as the `little friend of all the world,' an orphaned white boy passing for Indian who gets caught up in `The Great Game' between the fledgling British and Russian intelligence networks. MGM had originally intended it as a Freddie Bartholomew vehicle back in 1938 before an escalating budget, the disappointing box-office for RKO's Gunga Din and the war put it on the backburner, and the wait probably did the project the world of good, allowing them to film on location in the newly independent India - the first major studio picture to do so - and in Glorious Technicolor too. Victor Saville's direction effectively catches the tone of child-like adventure in a duplicitous world and Leon Gordon, Helen Deutsch and Richard Schayer's script does a good job of mixing the alternately antiquated and earthy (well, as earthy as the 1950 censors would allow) dialogue without seeming too stilted even if they do take more than a few liberties with Kipling's plot. There's an impressive supporting cast, too: Paul Lukas cuts a benign figure as the Lama Kim befriends, Arnold Moss makes use of his wonderfully smoothly sinister voice on the side of the angels for once while Robert Douglas also makes the most of a rare good guy role, Thomas Gomez delivers some good last minute villainy and Cecil Kellaway pops up intermittently as the marvellously named spy Hurree Chunder. As colonial adventures go, it's certainly one of the best.

Warner Home Video's US NTSC DVD boasts good picture quality and also includes the original trailer and a couple of vintage travelogs as extras.",1332806400,5,1998,4.893805309734513

This version is typical of the times, meaning Indian characters that didn't speak or look like Indians, terrible special effects, and a mangling of the plot.

405137,4,6301973208,"Despite Errol Flynn's issues with the public during the Second World War, this remains one of the great classics. His acting always seemed on the cusp of silent and talkie film, and perhaps that little bit ""hammed up"". He yet again portrays effectively the true ""villainous hero"" type. I always felt Dean Stockwell should have got top billing, but then I saw it first as a kid around his age. He had the good fortune to be selected to play roles in a number of the other films of Kipling's novels (for example, Captains Courageous). Kipling's great adventures were the ultimate ""stuff"" of the Saturday Matinee, and this is a prime example of those ""ripping yarn"" style presentations. The later production with Ravi Sheth was good, in colour,with great character actors (Bryan Brown) but seemed to lack the period charm of the original. My advice. Read the book, watch the original, watch the remake and then decide. For those who may not be aware, a later sequel to Kim was written by an Indian author, and while it sides Kim with the pro-independence, anti-Raj movement, it nonetheless takes the story a little further, for those who wondered what happened to Kim afterwards.

It is hard to find. I got an interlibrary loan copy from the National Library of Australia. Yes, that hard to find.

Five stars for story telling without a great range of special effects. Three stars because it was not possible to show the scenery in colour (and that is definitely an unfair rating) and four and a half stars for Saturday Matinee style acting.

This is for curling up on a Saturday after lunch, with a comforting bowl of chips or popcorn, pulling the curtains and travelling back in time.",1286236800,3,1683,4.737201365187714
405138,5,6301973208,"This movie from Kipling's classic novel is a true classic from the 50's.  Paul Lukas as the ""holy man"" played it so well I wanted to cheer. And the great Errol Flynn playing a supporting roll as the horse trader was a surprise, but he did it well. The half Indian British child Kim was a boy of the streets that had connections and the bravado to do anything.  Kim's (Dean Stockwell) skill in the streets is used for espionage for the British to prevent the destruction of an India leader. This facet while very good was surpassed by Kim's undying devotion for serving the Holy man's quest to find his ""RIVER"". Great scenery, acting and period costumes was great.  I did want to see more action we see now days, since the fighting that only showed the results of struggle or the big explosion.  Worth owning.",1279238400,4,808,4.476190476190476
405139,5,6301973208,"""Kim"", based on a story by Rudyard Kipling and filmed on location
in India in 1950, is a fascinating movie. It is the type of movie
that you can watch over and over again and still be entertained.

Essentially an adventure movie, it also has moments of drama,
amusement, devotion, suspense, intrigue and action and you are
totally absorbed in young Kim's wonderous world. It is a
colorful display of life in India at the turn of last century
when England ruled this vast empire.

The story deals with the continuing infiltration into India of
the Soviet Union and its satellites through the Kyber Pass in
their attempt to dominate the northern provinces of India.

Mahbub Ali ""Red Beard"" (Errol Flynn) works for the British
Secret Service who are attempting to foil the plot. He enlists
the aid of his young friend Kim (Dean Stockwell) who is an
orphaned white boy and a product of the back streets and
alleyways. Kim is used as a courier and a spy. He is also
a devoted disciple of a Buddhist priest (Paul Lucas) and he
helps him in his quest to find a sacred river. The priest
returns the favour and for his friendship and devotion pays
for the boy's education at a military school.

The leader of the Secret Service is Colonel Creighton
(Robert Douglas) and other members are Hurree Chunder
(Cecil Kelloway) and Lurgan Sahib (Arnold Moss).

One of my favourite segments of the movie is when young Kim
is placed in the care of Lurgan Sahib who teaches Kim the
art of observation and remembering what he has seen down to
the last detail - to-day commonly called ""Kim's Game"".

The entire cast is outstanding and in particular Errol Flynn,
Dean Stockwell and Paul Lucas.

Great entertainment.",1272153600,6,1692,4.657718120805369
405140,4,6301973208,"Errol Flynn may have top billing in this epic adventure drama, based on a book by Rudyard Kipling, but his is only a secondary role.

Dean Stockwell is the central character in the story of a young British orphan who, in order to avoid going to school, pretends to be a street urchin in Colonial India.  His protector is Red Beard (Flynn), a horse trader who is also a key operative in British espionage activities against rebel forces that are being backed by the Russians.

Also in the cast of the Victor Saville directed film is Paul Lukas, playing a holy man who Stockwell comes to revere, and Robert Douglas as the head of the British Secret Service.

There's plenty of action and, though his role is somewhat brief, Flynn is, thankfully, Flynn.

Stockwell could not have acted better than he did; it is fun to watch him beg for food and to see his relationship to the abbot who is searching for a mystical river and the horse trader and sometimes spy for the British played by Errol Flynn and the ways that he aids the British in their confrontations with the Russians.,1511136000,,715,4.465648854961832
