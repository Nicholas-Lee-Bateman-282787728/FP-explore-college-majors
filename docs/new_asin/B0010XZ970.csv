Of course, can any of say for SURE with CERTAINTY Jesus did or did not exist?  No.  But this is something important to consider.  There is far more evidence that Jesus did not exist than the evidence that suggests he did exist.  He is not mentioned by ANY historians of the time.  Some Christians will point to Josephus, but Josephus' writings can't be trusted, this fact has been pretty much proven.  The references to Jesus in his writings were added much later - either NOT by him or by him because he was either forced or bribed by the Romans.  Even if these facts cannot be proven (it's educated conjecture that most scholars agree is likely true), his writings are VERY shaky ground on which to build the proof of Jesus... and his is really the ONLY historical text on which Christians can say Jesus is mentioned outside of the New Testament itself.  Every other historian and scholar of the day, and there were plenty, never mention Jesus once - neither him or his miracles.  It would be the same as if someone like Jesus was walking around and doing fantastic miracles & had so many Jews following him & claiming he was the Messiah were here on Earth now & there wasn't one mention of it anywhere in any of the major newspapers or on the internet.  This is the equivilent we're talking about... just for reference.",1456358400,,1422,4.5770750988142295
8239352,4,B0010XZ970,"Well researched.  Thoughtful.  Compelling.  Packed with info and facts.
Narration is bad - droning.  Presented in a rather boring, elementary fashion.",1283731200,,150,6.0
8239353,1,B0010XZ970,"There are obviously historical writings on Jesus outside the bible like, Josephus the Jewish scholar. Amazon has great books on him. I found nothing new on this DVD that I haven't heard before. I am a seeker looking for the truth and I am finding the cross is empty but maybe for a different reason. Yes I encourage you to seek but becareful where you look. THANKS",1260662400,,364,4.447761194029851
8239354,5,B0010XZ970,"I am glad to fine someone who finally questions the fabrications of time and facts pretaining to the history of Jesus. So many writings that have been found, have been revised or only precieved from one point of view. In researching it is sometimes very hard to stay objective. This DVD seams to be more factual using the time lines as they have been presented from past researchers. I enjoyed this publication and look forward to another.",1227225600,,439,4.714285714285714
8239355,5,B0010XZ970,"How refreshing to watch such an important addition to the discourse about the myths of organized religions and find myself laughing! Usually these educational documentary types are incredibly dull, but not this one.  As a clinical therapist, I find that a sense of humor takes the sting out of difficult and painful realizations.  Well done!",1202601600,3,341,5.181818181818182
8239356,5,B0010XZ970,"Having read quite a lot of the recent spate of books decrying religion (Dawkins, Harris, Hitchens, Dennett, Stenger etc.), and also a few on the improbability of Jesus ever having existed (Doherty, Price, and Fleming's 'God Who Wasn't There' DVD), this immediately caught my interest when I came across it. Despite being a little wary about it because there is so little about who actually made it, and hence where they are coming from (do you have something to hide?), I went ahead and bought a copy anyway. This 'minus point' against its credibility didn't diminish when the DVD arrived: there is next to nothing on the sleeve (apart from the copyright notice by 'It's a Real Mystery LLC'), and there are no end credits after the documentary either. However in its defence, there is a list of sources given at the end, which went some way to assuage my doubts about its credibility, though I'm sure others will disagree given that there are several references to Acharya's work, Freke & Gandy, Ehrman etc,. and as many again for online resources.

As for the content itself, one doesn't have to read a great deal of this stuff to realise that there are many common threads between them, lots of it being presented here: the anomalies in the Gospels; the borrowing from other mystery cults; Jesus as a mythical being, or a metaphor for the sun; no reliable contemporary historical records; lack of any archaelogical evidence; inconsistencies in the likely timings of the writing of the Gospels; the many other other gospels that didn't make it into the Bible; the reasons for wanting to historicise the life of Jesus, and so on. In fact, even if you throw half of this stuff out as dubious in the extreme, there is still enough to make the likelihood of Jesus as an historical figure seem very remote indeed: the ideas presented here, as elsewhere, are just so much more viable than the superstitious story in the Bible.

Thus, despite the 'credibility gap' mentioned above, I heartily recommend the DVD - more material like this is needed for no other reason than getting people to think for themselves. So, don't take my word for it, watch it yourself and make up your own mind. As for me, I'm intrigued by the much later dating ascribed to the Gospels than I've hitherto seen, and this will likely mean I will dip into some of the sources mentioned, so that I can weigh this up against what I've already read, which is justification enough for me for buying it in the first place.",1202083200,7,2484,4.6819221967963385
8239357,5,B0010XZ970,"Empty Cross is amazing. It's historical perspective of the life of Jesus Christ is thought provoking. It exposes how societies throughout our world history have been manipulated by the religious power structures. Compelling, informative and well done. Whether one is a believer or not, this powerful documentary will certainly create a dialogue.",1197590400,5,345,5.653846153846154
8239358,5,B0010XZ970,"The Empty Cross is compelling, well researched, and very convincing. With the information presented, it is hard to believe Jesus did exist. Faith becomes the only hold on Christianity when presented with the evidence that radically contradicts the Bible. Well written and presented, non-believers will rejoice in the evidence. Believers should test their faith by watching this DVD. Then ask your spiritual leaders the questions this brings up. Is the Bible a book of parables to teach us life lessons, or has it been used to controll and manipulate the masses under the ruthless guidance of church and state? And will the Age of Aquarius destroy the Sun god, Jesus, and bring us a new idol?",1197590400,10,691,4.9655172413793105
