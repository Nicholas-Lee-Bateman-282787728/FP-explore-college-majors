411391,5,6302023750,"I love this film, but then I am prejudice, as my father was the cinematographer.  He mostly did Alfred Hitchcock films but Not For Me was a really sweet film he made in between.  Ella Fitzgerald sings the song in the film and of course nobody sings it better. It is for a mature audience to be sure, but I love the story. Gable is pretty good at comedy and of course Lili Palmer is great as per usual. Romantic Comedy at it's best.",1333670400,,431,4.119047619047619
411392,5,6302023750,Shipping faultless and vhs was in perfect shape.  I am a fan of Lilli Palmer and love this movie. Light funny romance.  Early movie with Carol Baker.,1289174400,2,149,4.481481481481482
411393,5,6302023750,"The film was actually a remake of an earlier 30s film called, ""ACCENT ON YOUTH.""  Directed by a forgotten master, Wesley Ruggles, ACCENT ON YOUTH is a sparkling comedy that starred Herbert Marshall as the older (50ish) playwright, and Sylvia Sidney as his devoted secretary Linda.  Marvelous Astrid Allwyn played Genevieve, the other woman--Allwyn, a familiar screen presence in the 30s with dozens of small parts to her credit, including an important one in CHARLIE CHAN'S SECRET.  And amusingly Lon Chaney Jr. figured as one of the ""young people"" in ACCENT ON YOUTH.  He wasn't yet typecast in horror parts.

In the 1950s remake, Gable plays the producer and Carroll Baker his young, naive assistant (the names are changed in the remake so she's no longer LINDA.  They have a May-December romance that's actually pretty touching.  It might be Carroll Baker's best part, she's not straining to be super-sexy nor is she twitching with Actors Studio neurosis.  Gable gives anm easy, restrained performance as a man who's always had more sex appeal than he's been comfortable with.  Lilli Palmer is supposed to be more Gable's age, and here she plays his former wife with whom the sparks are still flying.  The theatrical milieu is appropriately amusing, quips flying like darts, and Walter Lang, the director of such celebrated screen musicals as THE KING AND I, STATE FAIR, and CALL ME MADAM, really knows how to fill up the screen with lively tableaux.  The script is by John Michael Hayes, the renowned screenwriter who worked with Hitchcock on several of his best 50s pictures, and of course the original play was written by Samson Raphaelson, one of the geniuses of the American theater in the 1930s.  They don't get much more amusing than the tender, rueful, BUT NOT FOR ME.  You'll be humming the wonderful Gershwin tune from reel one: ""With love to lead the way/ I've found more clouds of gray/ Than any Russian play could guarantee . . .""",1110153600,20,1946,4.86060606060606
411394,5,6302023750,"This is one of the funniest movies I've seen and of the thirty or so Clark Gable movies I own is one of the top five to me. Gable plays his age perfectly and the rest of the cast does such a great job at playing with him. The funniest scene to me is the glossy photo scene in Carrol Baker's dressing room, but the wit thrown around between Gable and ex-wife Lilli Palmer is as good as male-female interaction gets in the movies, and lines regarding the ""chicago fire..."" and the dangers of a women being alone in the park made me laugh hysterically. Wholesome and entertaining.",995155200,13,577,4.351851851851852
7819635,5,6302023750,"This was an entertaining film. I watched it on Amazon Instant Video. This was the only way I found to watch it. I've been watching all the Clark Gable films I can find available. My library has several. I was impressed by Carroll Baker, so got 'Baby Doll (1956)' for which she was Nominated Best Actress, and it is quite good too. This film 'But Not For Me (1959) was Academy Award Nominated for Best Film, Best Actor: Clark Gable; Best Actress: Lilli Palmer.",1437523200,,459,4.476190476190476

7819637,4,6302023750,"This is a very well written and acted film. Clark Gable and Carroll Baker and Lilli Palmer and Lee J Cobb are fabulous actors and they have fun with the subject matter. Older guy, younger girl and show business ups and downs and ups again.",1419292800,,239,4.333333333333333
7819638,5,6302023750,"Good old Clark Gable Movie with Lilli Palmer and a very young Carroll Baker (at first I thought, ""is this Sandra Dee?""). Is this a mid-life crisis? Funny. Would not have purchased it if I hadn't seen it a million years ago and thought it was worthwhile then. Not disappointing.",1416787200,,277,4.56

It' such a shame that this is only available on instant and on VHS, but not on DVD.
TCM did not air this film in years, the US library system does not have it and Netflix neither.
It's about time that this lovely film will be released on DVD on demand.",1405555200,,278,4.054545454545455
7819642,4,6302023750,"I love the Clark Gable movies in the 30's during his glory days, but he is delightful in this role. He's fabulous once again playing himself, as he always does, but now doesn't seem to mind at all making fun with his age - the fact that he looks his age and then some - a coming to terms with age and his place in life. The movie easily rings true today.",1402876800,,354,3.9305555555555554
7819643,5,6302023750,"I saw this film on television about a decade ago and was quite entertained.  I never forgot it and when I saw that it was on Amazon Video Streaming, I had to have it.  It is still just as fun and classy as it was when I first viewed it.

I don't think that I've seen Gable funnier.  He was a good sport considering that I got the impression that Russ and Clark could have been interchangeable.  By the time that this film was made, Gable was a little long in the tooth.  The King's crown was tarnishing the same as his character's.  I laughed out loud every time he changed his age.

Lilli Palmer was absolutely gorgeous and her comedic timing was impeccable. There was a playfulness that was infectious.  I found myself automatically smiling every time she was in a scene.

Carole Baker's Ellie was quite believable and Lee J. Cobb was absolutely hysterical as the playwright-a hard-drinking curmudgeon with a heart.

All in all, I know that I will watch and enjoy this film many times",1362441600,,986,4.4525139664804465
7819644,5,6302023750,"This is one of Clark Gable's lesser known films. He is delightful as Russ Ward, a 50-ish broadway producer trying to fool others and himself he is in his forties. Lilli Palmer is delicious as his ex-wife. Lee J. Cobb steals the movie as a has-been playwright that Gable is trying to nurse one more play from. I think Lee J. Cobb is one of the most underrated character actors of all time. Try this one out. You will love it! enjoy!",1355875200,,431,4.2682926829268295
