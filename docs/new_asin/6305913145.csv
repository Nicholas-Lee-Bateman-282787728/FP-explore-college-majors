7897866,2,6305913145,"It is sad that the excellent Laserdiscs mastered from 35mm film transfers of JUNO AND THE PAYCOCK & BLACKMAIL have not yet made their way to DVD.  When you watch the razer sharp, good contrast & well framed laserdiscs, you wonder what went wrong over the years to produce these awful DVDs.

If you do not own a laserdisc player you may want to be patient and wait until someone like Lionsgate/Studio Canal release these titles.  They have released other Alfred Hitchcock British National movies.",1170979200,5,495,4.8
7897867,2,6305913145,"As a Hitchcock aficionado, I bought this DVD purely for ""Juno and the  Paycock."" (The early masterpiece, ""Blackmail,"" has long been  available.) While the film is of interest to Hitchcock fans, beware this  edition: sloppy framing cuts off the actors' heads in nearly half the  shots. It won't prevent you from seeing what's good (and what's not so  good) about the film, but you'll wish Whirlwind Media had been more careful  in putting this package together.",965692800,23,460,4.9868421052631575
