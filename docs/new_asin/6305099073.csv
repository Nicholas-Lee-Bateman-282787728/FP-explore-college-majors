7883243,5,6305099073,The movie is very good. I thought it was excellent in that they used a deaf mute to play one of the leading rolls. More deaf mutes need to be included in movies as well as women. Both stars played their roles well.,1447718400,,214,4.0
7883244,5,6305099073,"I loved this movie and looked forward to watching it whenever it came on tv.  Unfortunately it doesn't really come on tv at all anymore.  I have looked for copies of it on vhs whenever I go to garage sales but no luck and there is no way I can afford what some people are asking for online.

It would be beyond awesome if they could release it on DVD!  It is a great love story with just enough action mixed in.",1393113600,3,411,3.975609756097561
7883245,5,6305099073,"A really good movie that I've watched over and over until my DVR crashed.  I'd love to buy it or even record it again but it is nowhere to be found.  Given the price the tape goes for, I don't understand why this movie hadn't been digitalized and sold on DVD.

It's a good love story but better than that it is a story about two people who need to find who they really are.",1362182400,2,373,3.9466666666666668
7883246,5,6305099073,"This is one of my favorite movies and I never get tired of watching it.  I used to look forward to seeing it on tv, but now that I have my own copy, I can view it whenever I want.  It has everything I enjoy in a movie: adventure, romance and interesting characters.  I don't know why we don't see more of Mitzi Kapture or Anthony Natale because they were great as the two lead characters.  Mitzi Kapture played Jenny Farrell, the head of security for a pharmaceutical company.  Sam Rollston (Anthony Natale), chemist and son of the company's president was the only  witness of the theft of  a valuable new drug that resulted in a murder.  Jenny  was assigned to act as bodyguard for the only witness.  You can guess that the bad guys would stop at nothing to kill Sam, so Jenny had to use all her skills to keep them both alive.  While fighting for their lives, Jenny and Sam had time to fall in love!  So suspenseful and satisfyingly romantic.",1244160000,2,944,4.362068965517241
