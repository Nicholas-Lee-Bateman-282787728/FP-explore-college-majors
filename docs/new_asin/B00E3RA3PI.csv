8600718,5,B00E3RA3PI,"There is an authority in the voice of Vanessa Redgrave that lends such credence to this type of woman-felt scientific examination of human bodies. If while hearing her narration, during the beautiful displays of our inner human beings, combined with Pink Floyd's superior expertise in the invention of unique sounds to suit imagery, viewers don't come away from this movie with senses of awe over all we are, I don't know what could possibly move those who don't. Ms. Redgrave is providing us with insights into our own bodies by way of layers of performance art. Doing as such is psychologically the way human minds learn most and best: through engaging in performance art. Thus, my view of this gorgeous movie is that it's nothing short of a masterpiece that condenses millennia of personal, medical and scientific knowledge into a brief moment of layered art~",1503792000,,862,4.951724137931034
8600719,1,B00E3RA3PI,"Having owned and loved ""Music From 'The Body'"" by Roger Waters & Ron Geesin since 1970, I've always been curious about the film that it came from.

Well, I needn't have been.  It's an almost unwatchable ""health film"" incorporating stock footage, interviews with some old people in a nursing home, a discussion between some partially-dressed Britons, and (unaccountably) some footage of lava.  It's a mess, to put it charitably.

And Waters & Geesin's music isn't even prominently featured.",1480464000,,489,5.230769230769231
