7990759,5,B00009EFYJ,Babylon 5 was absolutely the very best science fiction program ever to be on television.  We watch it clear through once a year.  Love Love Love it.,1359936000,,148,4.444444444444445
7990760,2,B00009EFYJ,"Be careful with this series.  Babylon 5 is strange.  Usually Star Trek fans like Star Trek because it is unique.  Star Trek is not like every other Sci-Fi show out there.  Babylon 5 IS very much like 'every other Sci-Fi show out there.'  If you like Sci-Fi in general then buy this for your collection ... if you very specifically like all of the Star Trek series' then be careful.  I never watched this show while it was on tv ... I pretty much knew just by looking at commercials for it that I wasn't going to like it much.  Many years later (like now) a good friend who was a huge fan of the show has decided he wants me to watch the show (we are renting the series from NetFlix.com) thinking that since I am a huge Star Trek fan I couldn't possibly not like Babylon 5.  How wrong he is.  Its not that good.  The acting is stiff and bad, the theme music throughout the show is cheap and bad (no emotion at all) and the show in general is just silly and overdone with exceptionally bad dialog -- -- like most Sci-Fi television and movies actually.  I am only halfway into the second season and I think I am going to tell my friend to stop -- its not good.  Its actually laughable.

Again, if you like silly Sci-Fi in general, you will probably enjoy this series ... but if you are a true Star Trek, TNG, DS9, Voyager and even Enterprise fan (yes, even with the show being cancelled Enterprise is better than Babylon5) then Babylon 5 is probably not for you!  Gosh this series is so bad!",1116115200,,1488,4.212014134275618
7990761,5,B00009EFYJ,"Babylon 5 is a five mile long space station.  Located deep in neutral territory, it is designed to prevent intergalactic war by providing a place where peace can be worked out between the races.  Run by Earth, it was built with help from the Minbari after our war with them when we were almost wiped out.  Since it is also a trade station, it attracts allies of all kinds on a daily basis.
Unfortunately, it also attracts trouble.  There are raiders in the area, the Narn and Centauri have at best a fragile peace, and someone is always trying to smuggle something on board.  Even worse, an ancient enemy is rebuilding forces, and the effects of this will reach all the way back to Earth.
Babylon 5 is still unique in television.  It set out to tell a single story that had been mapped out beforehand.  As a result, it sucks you in and doesn't let you go until you've reached the end.  Season 1 is the most uneven, but the beginnings of the story are there, and it lays the background on the races and cultures we will be dealing with over the course of the show.  Season 2 brings a new captain and a storyline that is gaining speed.
Of course, if you are looking at this page, odds are you are already a fan and looking for information on the sets.  The picture, presented in widescreen, is hit and miss, with some dust popping up occasionally.  It is clear and sharp most of the time.  Sound is presented in full surround and has never sounded better.  Each set contains two audio commentaries by series creator J. Michael Straczynski and a season intro by cast and crew.  They also have some behind the scenes documentaries and encyclopedia entries introducing you to the world of Babylon 5.  In addition, season 2 has one audio commentary by various cast members.
Whether you buy the seasons bundled like this or individually, don't miss your chance to own this fantastic TV series.",1069632000,,1886,4.5058823529411764
7990762,5,B00009EFYJ,"I started watching the original B5 episodes during the original 2nd season airing.. and since then have taped (on VCR) every single episode of B5 and have kept them.  B5 is one of the most sophisticated, well thought-out SciFi series I've known.  It takes a little getting used to as the characters are more raw than those from the refined ideal Star Trek world, but that adds to the grounded-ness of the storyline.  Also, although each episode by itself is complete in itself, but unlike Star Trek, each episode builds on the previous episode and is chronological, so the full impact of the series can only be appreciated if you see the whole thing.  Imagine it being a 5-year mini-series with 22 episodes/year.  Thus buying the whole season makes sense (as opposed to Star Trek episodes you just want a select few of the whole season. you can still do that with this, but you miss out a lot if you do)
Now with the DVD's I can get rid of my VHS tape clutter (DVD's are more compact!), get better screen resolution (shown in wide-screen letterbox format and DD surround) than you could ever reproduce from a taped show while it was on air.
Highly recommended for those who taped the entire series.  No commercials, you get the full ending credit (many of the TV airings either squashed or muted the end credits), DVD-quality sound and video, instant episode jumping, etc... in addition to some snippets from the actors.  The chapters are done so that it is easy to skip the beginning and end credits too.",1054512000,10,1505,4.614232209737827
