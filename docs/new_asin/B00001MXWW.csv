7914464,5,B00001MXWW,"I've tried several workout videos that claim to be for parents with young children.  This one has been the best by far.  My children like the music a lot and love to participate with me.  While this video will not get you ready for a triathalon, it offers decent exercise.  It has decent cardio, leg, and abdominal work.  It is lacking something for upper body, however.

If you desperately want to do a little exercise with your kids and you can't get outside, this video will be a welcome relief.

As far as the hairdos and production, this video is rather old and the hairstyles and clothes were in style at the time.  I assume the woman had to finance her own production so I'm not surprised it was shot in a living room.  Who cares, anyway?  The sound and video quality are just fine.  The point of the video isn't to make the kids follow everything perfectly, but to have fun as a family getting some exercise.  My kids change the moves depending on what they want to do on a given day and that's great.  Bottom line, we enjoy it and we get to exercise as a family on days when we can't get outside.",1184025600,,1105,4.280193236714976
