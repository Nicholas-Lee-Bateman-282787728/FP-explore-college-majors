8199103,3,B000R7HZYU,"If you don't know the British serial, ""Coronation Street, you will be unfamiliar with the cast and characters in this three DVD set. The three DVDs include ""Farewell of Mike;"" ""An Audience with Coronation Street"" and ""Family Album: Baldwins, Battersby and Duckworths."" ""Coronation Street"" is a British television institution and a national treasure seen in Australia and Canada besides England. Unfortunately, America has only experienced ""East Enders."" Unlike ""East Enders,"" ""Coronation Street"" is set in fictional Weathersfield section of Manchester, England. ""Coronation Street' was slated for a thirteen episode commitment transformed into a regular serial and British television was never the same again. Sadly, you wouldn't know that from watching the DVDs here from around 2006.

The first DVD is a 22 minute episode entitled ""Farewell to Mike"" with a tribute to Johnny Briggs MBE who played Mike Baldwin for 30 years on the series. There were interviews with cast members like Anne Kirkbride, William Roache MBE, Elizabeth Dawn MBE, Amanda Barrie and others. It was a too short of a tribute to a man who played a complicated character.

The second DVD is entitled ""Audience with Coronation Street."" The cast and guests celebrate 45 years on television with an event including singing, dancing and question and answers session. There is also a tribute to Johnny Briggs MBE by his co-star Amanda Barrie (Alma Baldwin). Too bad, they didn't include the show's creator, Tony Warren MBE. They also showed a tour of the set.

The third and final DVD is entitled 'Family Album: Baldwins, Battersbys and Duckworths."" This DVD is three episodes with each episode focusing on one family on the Street. Baldwins and Duckworths have been around decades and have a richer history unlike the Battersby. The three episodes have interviews with cast members of the show.

The 3 DVD box set is better than buying the individual DVD. ""Coronation Street"" has been on the air since 1960 and going strong as well. The package is a must for any fan. If you want to know ""Coronation Street,"" there are other DVDs out to there to better introduce you to the series.",1495065600,,2149,5.079320113314448

8199109,1,B000R7HZYU,"I purchased this set because I hear so much about the long-standing series...and I'd never seen any episodes.  (I'm in the U.S.A.)  This has nothing to do with the stories.  It is a selection of interviews with the stars talking about their characters and particular events in the stories -- of which I know nothing!

The specifics of the set should have been very clear as to what one would be viewing. I still know nothing about the Brit soap....",1356307200,12,448,4.5625
