8262967,3,B0016KV7WI,I would recommend this for anyone whose watch season 1 and 2 and just want more School Rumble,1483142400,,93,4.222222222222222
8262968,4,B0016KV7WI,Came on time. Good buy.,1424304000,,23,3.8
8262969,4,B0016KV7WI,"It's an OVA, so don't always expect much. It's two episodes, about 24 minutes long each, but funny! Honestly come on, if you love School Rumble your going to want this too! It's a nice fill'in story connecting seasons 1 and 2. Having this will complete your set anyway, so just buy it, or find the complete set with this included, your inner otaku will thank you later. ;)",1409097600,,372,4.405797101449275
8262970,5,B0016KV7WI,I really dig'd the show and found the OVA to be a nice way to end things. The episodes in the OVA don't really fall in line with the show and are actually some of the chapters from the manga but if your a fan of School Rumble then having the OVA is a nice little treat to finish off they collection.,1366070400,,299,3.838709677419355
8262971,5,B0016KV7WI,"This has to be one of the best OVAs to any anime out there. It's only 50 minutes long-- like 2 extra episodes of the series. What you get are extra scenes that fit in between segments of Season 1.

What I really liked was the fact that they gave some further background and development to a couple of the secondary characters. Mainly to Lara Gonzalez and Kyousuke Imadori. You get to see a slightly softer side to Lara which was cute. And even though she likes to beat the crap out of Imadori...I got the feeling she kinda likes him and vice versa.

Funnyness wise, my favorite bit had to be the hot spa. (They visit it following the camping trip in the first season btw.) That segment was hilarious!! Warning: you do get to see Harima & Hanai's backsides in this. Nothing terribly offensive though--unless you're an uber prude.

Parents: this and the 2 seasons are not really appropriate for kiddies!

Oh, and, as always...avoid the dub. The voices and tone of the English voices are all wrong for the characters. Plus, just like with the series (1 & 2) they changed MUCH of the dialogue and even the humour. Yep...they wrote their own unfunny jokes and got rid of or dumbed down the Japanese ones. Sorry but that is a big issue with me! Pant, pant, pant. I digress..............

Is it worth getting? YES! But, at only 50 minutes in runtime, you should wait for it to drop to around 4 or 5 bucks. Then you can really enjoy it.",1311033600,5,1428,4.414448669201521
8262972,4,B0016KV7WI,I enjoyed this Anime very much. You can find other reviews that will tell you all you could want to know about the story and content. So in summation it was amusing and enjoyable.,1253577600,,179,4.294117647058823
8262973,5,B0016KV7WI,School Rumble is one of my favorite animes and this OVA is a great way to trasition to season 2 for it.,1231286400,6,103,3.727272727272727
