5511380,3,B00AW9M8N6,"We went and saw this movie last night. The acting was good, there were some great action scenes, but I have to say that this movie left a lot of questions. There were spots where it were boring, and drawn out. I felt that the movie was all over the place. Sequences were out of place with no explanation whatsoever. This movie left us wanted answers without really getting any. Possibly a good renter, but I would not spend full ticket price on this one like we did. Bummer.

5511381,4,B00AW9M8N6,"In 2006's The Prestige, Michael Caine plays a magician mentor who says, ""Making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back.""  In Now You See Me, Caine plays a very different character who in one scene learns this lesson in a very painful way.  Now You See Me is like The Prestige-Lite, but that doesn't mean it's not good.

According to Now You See Me, successful illusions are the result of misdirection and timing. In a summer teeming with sequels, it is refreshing to see an occasional original idea hit the theaters, and it is this misdirection and successful timing that perhaps enhances the appeal of this film.  In one of the year's most enjoyable opening scenes, four unique illusionists (Jessie Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson, and Dave Franco) are drawn together by a mysterious individual who provides them with the blueprints to a spectacular act that only they are capable of performing as a team.  The team, now known as the Four Horsemen, begins performing a series of illusions that involve various heists including the robbery of a major Paris bank.  Ironically, the spoils of these robberies go not to the victors but to the audience of the show!  This Robin Hood-esque form of vigilantism draws the attention of FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) who is given the exceptionally difficult task of proving exactly how the Four Horsemen are guilty of these robberies.

Casting is by far one of the film's major attributes.  Eisenberg's awkward, self-deprecating persona is put aside for one with much stronger bravado; watching him play J. Daniel Atlas is sort of like watching him play Mark Zuckerberg on personality steroids, in other words - kind of great.  Woody Harrelson does a great job as mentalist Merritt McKinney, which he plays kind of like Sherlock Holmes...on personality steroids - so also kind of great.  Dave Franco and Isla Fisher are very effective, but far less central to the film's development.  Ruffalo and his partner Alma (Mlanie Laurent) are great at revealing the frustration of chasing down the clever illusionists, and Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine expertly provide further dimension to the story by exploring the darker side of ""magic's"" purpose.

Now You See Me has a lot of fun with its premise.  Director, Louis Leterrier packs the film with style and tricks of the trade that keep the story moving and rather captivating.  Leterrier, mostly known for action films like The Incredible Hulk and the first two Transporter films, takes a crack at an ensemble piece where he must balance story with numerous characters - all the while keeping the audience in the dark about the exact motivations of these characters.  He is mostly successful at this, but the film requires a rather high level of suspension of disbelief and some serious overlooking of plot-holes.  It also has a bit of an unevenness to it as Leterrier cannot quite lose his proclivity for action and crowbars a 15 minute car chase smack in the middle of the film.  The scene is brilliantly shot and very exciting, but it also involves virtually none of the film's main characters and thus, feels a bit superfluous.

Now You See Me is a lot of fun and fortunately, it does not run out of steam at the end.  Too often films like this are all set-up and no delivery, but the ending of Now You See Me is satisfying and very appropriate.  Hopefully, Now You See Me will find an audience and remind movie studios that once in a while an original idea is worth their consideration before they green-light Fast and Furious 12: Where Did I Put My Keys?

5511382,3,B00AW9M8N6,"For about half the movie, this slight-of-hand caper gets it right.  Although we don't get much of a backstory on the 4 magicians that are brought together by some secret organization called The Eye, we know from the beginning there is another involved.  Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg) is the most successful of the group.  His former assistant, Henley (Isla Fisher) is a rising young star on her own, Woody Harrelson plays Merritt, a mind reader and hypnotist and Jack (Dave Franco) is a pick-pocket who lives day to day.

Each, individually invited to join The Eye, collectively  become ""The Four Horsemen"" and are highly successful thanks in part to their benefactor, Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine).  By ""magic"" they rob a Parisian bank, all while in view of a Las Vegas audience.  Seen in the trailers, the money is scattered from the ceiling of the auditorium where they are performing.

This leads to an FBI investigation headed by Agent Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) and accompanied by an Interpol agent (Melanie Laurent).  Not forgetting that the 5th person involved in this magical heist is unknown, Morgan Freeman is introduced as Thaddeus Bradley, a former headliner who now makes a living on TV debunking magic tricks.  This is all pretty interesting until the tricks get more complicated, not to mention ridiculous and the Feds close in.  All the while, the FBI still look like fools.

Then we get to the traditional action and we are left wanting with some (admittedly nifty) hand fighting between the wispy Jack and burly FBI agents.  That is followed with a car chase through busy Manhattan.  The film concludes with a reveal that had me shaking my head.  For a film that runs just under 2 hours, a lot is crammed in, including many twists and turns, plenty of misdirection and an encouraging offer to ""look closer.""  Don't.",1370131200,2,1832,4.880258899676376
5511383,3,B00AW9M8N6,"NOW YOU SEE ME thinks that it's a really smart, twisty movie.  I suspect it secretly hopes to be this year's INCEPTION or even THE PRESTIGE (both smart, twisty movies from Christopher Nolan of THE DARK KNIGHT fame).  Heck, it even has Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman from the BATMAN movies.  But it is NOT all that smart.  It does have a lot of twists, yes, but as the movie goes on, they become less and less convincing.

Early in the film, we meet 4 magicians who are not exactly the most successful prestidigitators out there (Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson and Dave Franco).  But they are called together to a mysterious apartment in NYC and given a mysterious mission.  A year later, with the support of mogul Michael Caine, they are playing a huge crowd at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, where they transport an audience member to the inside of his vault in Paris.  They bring him back, along with the 3 million euros that were in the vault, and they shower the money upon the audience.  Thus, the police are now very interested in this group (called The Four Horsemen), but are unable to keep them because unless the FBI is willing to admit they believe in magic, they have no way of showing HOW the crime could have been committed.

The investigation is led by agent Mark Ruffalo (at his most rumpled) who is perplexed by these magicians and goaded by their taunting.  He is soon aided by an Interpol agent (Melanie Laurent from INGLORIOUS BASTERDS), and even assisted to some degree by professional magic debunker Morgan Freeman.  Freeman mostly serves the purpose of telling Ruffalo (and thus the audience) how the tricks are done.  These reveals range from amusing and moderately clever to eventually ridiculously elaborate, dangerous and expensive.  I won't give any more details, but let's just say that The Four Horsemen are apparently brilliant cat-burglars, drivers, engineers and even MMA fighters.

The film, thus, grows from being quite interesting and engaging into something that really stretches credibility.  At first, we're willing to be drawn along for the ride...but after a while, the antics grow too big (and yet too predictable at the same time).  You're meant to get really involved in wondering who the puppet-master behind all this might be (and you're given a few red herrings along the way)...but I was not terribly invested.

The performers are varyingly successful.  Freeman & Caine give us the same quality (but uninspired) work they so often do when allowed to take a paycheck role.  (Please don't get me wrong...Caine is capable even now of the most delicate and gripping performances [HARRY BROWN springs to mind], but he is coasting here).  Eisenberg is at his most annoying here, but it fits his character.  Harrelson is always fun and brings enjoyable energy, easily stealing his scenes.  Fisher is wasted, and Dave Franco (James' brother) mostly fades into the background.  But the magicians become less and less central, and Ruffalo and Laurent become more important.  I like both of these actors, but here their chemistry is forced and the script doesn't do them any favors.

I had an okay time at NOW YOU SEE ME because I naturally like trying to outguess tricky movies.  And the basic concept of the film is actually pretty solid.  But the execution is lacking.  The movie wants to feel like a big summer blockbuster...but it needs a properly scaled down feel and a bit more at stake.  The camera work consists mostly of swirly, 360 degree sweeps.  The characters go from engaging to cardboard.  And the plot (and this type of movie is first and foremost about the plot) is ultimately unsatisfying and perhaps quite full of holes.  But I didn't care enough to try to figure out those holes.  And that is not a good sign.  2.5 stars.",1370044800,4,3793,4.7919876733436055
5511384,2,B00AW9M8N6,"When you're watching a movie trailer (in a theater or online), it's not hard to be misled - sort of like a magic trick.  In any event, there's been a big discussion in online communities about the amount of information a film's movie trailer gives away.  Are they giving away too much?  Does it take away from the overall quality of the film when the audience is already prepared to not laugh at a scene from a trailer, even though that particular scene helped put people in the theater to begin with?  In the event movie trailers were reduced to about a minute, is that too little information for people these days?  This all brings us to the incredibly flashy movie trailer released for the magic/bank heist film, Now You See Me.  To say this film's trailer gives away a fair amount of plot details is an understatement, since there's very little more to gain when you can already guess what happens.  Sure, there are relatively miniscule nuances that are missing from the trailer, but the main substance of the plot is right here in front of you, without even having to pay a dime to see it.  So, is it worth paying to see a film when the trailer basically gives away everything before you even see it?  Let's discuss that notion in the review for Now You See Me.

Directed by Louis Leterrier (The Transporter, The Incredible Hulk), Now You See Me stars Mark Ruffalo as an FBI agent, Dylan Rhodes, who trails a group of magicians as they mysteriously rob banks while performing their act on stage.  These handpicked magicians include J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Merritt Osbourne (Woody Harrelson), Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher), and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco).  On their own, they are mediocre, but they are each specially selected by a secret benefactor to form a group, known as the Four Horsemen.  In attendance for the horseman's magic shows is a magician myth buster, Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman), who makes an agreement with the horseman's original promoter, Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine), to destroy their act after they steal his millions and give it to an attending audience.  The FBI, Interpol, a myth buster, and an angry business man are all out to catch the illusive horseman.  Can anyone catch them before they complete their grand finale?  Mlanie Laurent, Common, and Michael J. Kelly also star in supporting roles.

The general theme of this film is constantly repeated through the course of this film, which is ""the more you think you see, the easier it is to fool you.""  If you're standing in an auditorium watching a magic act, it's pretty impressive - not because it's supposedly magic, but because everyone wants to know how the performer did the tricks.  When you're watching a film, it's easy to trick an audience since the majority of the trickery is done through CGI.  That's not impressive, that's deceitful.  What's even more deceitful is passing off Now You See Me as an interesting movie in its advertisements, only to get people to the theater to show them the same advertisements they've already seen - only over a two hour span.  At this point, if you've seen the trailer to this film, you'd really only be paying to see how it ends.  So, is it worth the price of admission to see how this film ends?

The answer to that particular question is not as simple as a quick ""yes"" or ""no.""  This film carries a large amount of star power that easily carries the load in a variety of scenes.  Basically, every second you'd be watching this film, you'd see a major actor/actress on the screen.  Does that translate to movie success?  More often than not, an A-list name isn't enough to garner a film recommendation - not anymore at least.  Let's go down the list:  Jesse Eisenberg plays his usual self-absorbed character that quickly grows tiresome, Woody Harrelson's character is purely charismatic and absolutely full of himself, Isla Fisher role is that of a dimwitted former assistant, serving no other purpose than to add a woman to the horseman, and Dave Franco plays aloof workhorse that is somehow able to fight like Jackie Chan.  And, there's really no need to say anything about Michael Caine or Morgan Freeman, since they have enough credentials to do whatever they want on screen (all of which happens to be awesome).

If you want to talk about future star power, then keep your eye on Mark Ruffalo.  He's been around for quite a while, but he's really gone ""big"" since earning himself the role as Bruce Banner in Marvel's The Avengers.  Like his incredibly enjoyable performance in Zodiac, Ruffalo is once again a man of the law - a role that suits him quite well.  Now You See Me gives Ruffalo a ton of screen time, which was rather surprising considering the amount of talent in this film.  Surprisingly, the ""magicians"" aren't on stage very long, with the majority of the film belonging to Ruffalo and his endless pursuit of the horsemen.  He is unequivocally the shining star of this muddled dud.

Overall, Now You See Me is exactly what you see - comparable to a cheesy reality TV show with very little substance and poor execution.  This film is just one of many knockoffs that can join Ocean's 11 in the ""too dumb to be believable"" category of silly bank robbery films that would never, ever work.  No matter how many flashing lights they use, or how many people they pack on the top of a roof building to cheer for them - these characters lack depth and intrigue.  Now You See Me features another ""big twist"" ending (if you even want to call it that), but by the time the twist takes place, you'll already be asking your movie neighbor ""what the heck is going on with this movie?""  The glitz and glamor are possibly enough to draw people to see this film, but don't give in to the light.  Make a smart decision and just move on to something else...

This is and intelligent, entertaining film that's fun, funny, and exhilarating -- refreshing in the summer of sequel blockbusters a la Ocean's Eleven. I didn't think it'd be this good, but the plot is written extremely well. I don't want to spoil anything, thus I'll just say that this is one of the best executed cat-and-mouth chases I have seen where everything is truly an illusion.

If Now You See Me had to earn its stars, it would get one for mildly interesting concept and another for moderately good execution.  The buck stops there.

Let me sum it up for those of you with as yet clean palettes:

Four gutter-mouthed, unlikeable, loser magicians audition for positions in the mystical historical society for the preservation of magic by robbing the rich to feed the poor.

Two stars, a fork and a knife.  If watching Now You See Me is a burnt steak at a greasy spoon diner, re-watching Inception or The Illusionist is leftover four-star tenderloin cooked to order.

5511727,3,B00AW9M8N6,"Review of Now You See Me
Hot Toasty Rag, November 24, 2017

Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, and Dave Franco are The Four Horsemen, a group of magicians who put on mind-blowing shows in Las Vegas. Theyre a bit of an odd pairing, since Jess is inexplicably and unbelievably a ladies man, Woody keeps hitting on Isla even though she doesnt like him, and Dave seems like hes playing dress-up to fit in with the grown-ups. But, they get along for the most part and manage to amuse the movie-going audience. When they rob a bank during their magic show, it puts the FBI and Interpol on their trail. Mark Ruffalo and Melanie Laurent are the agents, and even though shes pretty grungy, he starts falling for her anyway. Add in Morgan Freeman, a man who makes a living out of exposing frauds, and Michael Caine, the owner of the robbed bank, and The Four Horsemen don't have many friends left!

If you like quick-witted scripts with lots of twists and turns, this is a great one for you to rent. Yes, Ive criticized the casting a bit, but Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin, and Edward Ricourts script is very entertaining. Its fun and flashy, with surprises youll never see coming. Plus, every little boy who learned card tricks when he was little can get a front row seat to a truly incredible magic show!

DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not your friend. There are lots of camera swirls and flashy lights during the magic shows, and it might make you sick. In other words, Dont Look, Mom!",1511481600,,1545,4.510714285714286

The twists and turns defy imagination, but more or less fit together in the end. The banter is witty, the effects are splendid, and the comeuppance is satisfying.

(how is it possible to steal $140 million without a large number of accomplices? it's not. how can four magicians rob a bank and hack a financial network? they can't.) it's visually very stylish, all the magic trick sequences are fun (especially the last, which is visually worth the blu ray format). best of all, like any magic trick, you only learn how the plot is actually put together at the end of the film, and even my wife couldn't guess the ending. the characters are caricatures at times, but the actors are able to pull off exaggeration with flair. fast paced and entertaining.",1499644800,,842,4.546052631578948

5512017,2,B00AW9M8N6,"An endlessly frustrating and overlong heist film with paper thin characters. The picture relies on the innumerable cast members signature nuances instead of crafting credible backstories to develop the narrative. You just never truly care for the characters or their motives.
The premise suggests that, in theory, this should be a redeemable, elaborate pieceof entertainment but countless nonsensical missteps for every original sequence squander any potential.
Cut about 30 mins and this just might be a mindless slice of good lookin big budget fun, but no such luck either. The biggest misdirection of all, a stellar cast to distract you from the lack of substance with tons of unnecessary CGI and pretentiously sweeping camera moves. Even the interesting plot twist serves as the final nail on repeated viewing because it's just so darned ridiculous. I hear theres a sequel. Facepalm.",1498867200,,887,5.3428571428571425

5512022,5,B00AW9M8N6,"Just finished watching ""Now You See Me"" released by Summit Entertainment.
""Now You See Me"" is actually a great escapist movie which centers around four street magicians who are wasting their talent by doing street shows to earn a living, and who are recruited and molded into a performing quartet known as ""The Four Horsemen"" who first gain infamy by staging what appears to be a robbery live on stage in Las Vegas of a Paris Bank with a volunteer from the audience.  But that's impossible - right.  The Four Horsemen are quickly arrested by the FBI, but are let go because all the evidence points to them having  been in Las Vegas.  Onward for their next trick where they rob the billionaire who decided to sponsor them blind.  Now on the run, The Four Horsemen have one more Robin Hood type of magic show up their sleeve and its going to be a whopper of a finale in New York City.
Oh yes, there is the riddle of who ""The Eye"" is that The Four Horsemen are going to have to solve if they are to receive any sanctuary for their acts.
Great Escapist Fun with a riveting back story that is full of twists and turns until the last reveal.
Highly Recommended!

5512174,4,B00AW9M8N6,This is proof you can make Magic look cool. I don't think I am a big fan of Magic past Hollywood effects. there is some ego to show you can make someone look dumb or fool. But this movie made it seem cool. I like the Robin Hood idea. The only thing this movie is missing is Jim Carrey drilling a hole in his head. This movie pushes the idea magicians job is you to look stupid and have an ego about it..No one to me is likable but thank God they can do magic and give someone else's money to the poor.,1490054400,,501,3.8737864077669903

5512381,1,B00AW9M8N6,"This is not a movie about clever stage magicians pulling off heists with the power of misdirection. It is a movie about smarmy jerks whose lack of actual ideas or effective plans is covered up with being able to, for no clear reason, actually just do real magic, including:

1. Floating mid-air three-dimensional holograms, like something out of a bad SyFy show
2. Instantly hypnotizing anyone into doing any action at any time
3. Being totally invisible to cameras in helicopters
4. Access to mirrors that do not work like mirrors work
5. The ability to construct ludicrously elaborate and expensive sets in the middle of large cities, without leaving any paper trail, and while being pursued by multiple international police organizations.

And when even all of that isn't enough to cover a plot hole, they just drop that thread and move onto the next. This was a total waste of some very talented actors, who were apparently all given exactly one instruction: act as insufferably arrogant as possible at all times. And don't even get me started on the ""twist"" at the end.

The ensemble of stars was delightful - they played so well off each other and gave the movie a real feeling of camraderie that I greatly enjoyed.  A lot of action, there was almost always something important happening on the screen and takes your full attention, you don't want to miss any of the little clues or details. I felt a little bit tired out at the end of the movie, there had been so much going on, LOL.

5514765,5,B00AW9M8N6,"This. This is what an entertaining, not too deep movie should look like. Fun, surprises, twists. Likable characters and an entertaining story.
And for those who look for something deeper it basically carries the same message as 'Houdini':
Yes, mentalist and magicians are people who love being in power and who love fascinating and stunning other people. But, n, that does NOT mean they exploit their talents. Houdini became obsessed to fight the frauds that sprung up after WW1, who took advantage of all those who had lost loved ones in the war, staging seances and spirit meetings to extract money from relatives desert to be in contact one last time
Be dazzled, be entertained, but never believe it's more than a trick. And if with these tricks power comes, always use that power for good.",1473984000,,793,4.838235294117647

Then I read some reviews from Amazon member and a surprisingly large number thought it was a great 4 or 5 star movie. I have to agree with the professional critics in this case. I almost gave it three stars because it had some quality actors doing who have some innate charm and seemed to be giving a decent effort. The actual story line was completely unbelievable. They attempt to explain some of the more ridiculous aspects of the movie with dialogue from the Morgan Freeman character and 'behind the scenes' recreations but that just makes it worse. Overall, kind of a Transformers type of movie. Makes no sense at all but it is colorful and with plenty of moving parts.",1473033600,,805,4.636363636363637

Two highly talented illusionists, a mind reader/hypnotist (played by Woody Harrelson), and skilled pick pocket each receive a card inviting them into a well known (within their circle) secret society.  Their egos are all a bit bruised when they show up with their cards in hand only to discover the other three were invited as well.  With no one there to greet them they break into the meeting place and find an elaborate bank robbery illusion designed for them to present together as a Las Vegas show.  Behind the scene is a master mind that you never get to see, in fact, they don't even know who is behind it all.  Mark Ruffalo (always the good guy) plays the investigator assigned to the bank robbery.  Okay I have to stop there, as not to tell you too much.  I can promise you that in the end when they reveal the master mind it will blow your mind.  Its a modern day Robin Hood meets Oceans 11 meets the worlds greatest illusion.

I want to watch the second movie, but I will again watch it in the comfort of my own home because, even though I have no desire to have magical acts explained to me, I do want to understand what is going on in a movie, and sometimes I feel like the story is too fast-paced for me to do that.

Then we find out that people were selected to get seats to the show.  the story only makes any sense if you are not really paying attention to what they are doing, and if you were not paying attention, then you could not follow the plot at all.",1469923200,,641,4.08

5516045,2,B00AW9M8N6,"5 seconds, edit cut. 5 seconds, edit cut, 5 seconds, edit cut. This movie relies on an edit cut every 5 seconds for the entire 1 hour and 55 minutes, and will rot your brain when you realize this is the only tool the director had to create drama in the weak story line. The second issue I had with the movie is it reminded me of the through line in  ""Last Action Hero"" with Arnold Schwazeneggaer where the kid knows he's in the movie because none of the cops are dressed like cops but are supermodel fashion actors. There was never any suspension of disbelief that any of the characters were real cops. Take a pass on this one and spend your 2 hours elsewhere.",1469750400,2,660,4.238095238095238

5517052,2,B00AW9M8N6,"Boring.  The trite ""whodunit"" plot twist was entirely anticlimactic.  A superstorm of convolution and confusion that failed to bedazzle. I'm definitely not one to scrutinize every implausibility in a movie, but this movie took obscene liberties with fantasy and lost all credibility early on.  After that, it was just another one of those ""toss and turn in your seat"" experiences.  A waste of exactly two hours.  To be fair there were a few snippets of cleverness in the technical production (cheap movie tricks) but these fall far short of rescuing the film.

I had high hopes since the film had such high viewer ratings.  I was let down terribly.  Wish I could get m $4 back, we'd go buy two ice cream cones and have a much more enjoyable summer experience.",1467504000,2,759,4.740458015267175
5517053,5,B00AW9M8N6,"I love Amazon, it is a great way to shop.  And one of the reasons I say this is because I am able to read the reviews previous to a purchase to determine whether my money would be well spent.  When reading the reviews for this movie I was surprised by the few negative reviews, compared to the overwhelming number of positive reviews.  So, we purchased the movie and for the life of me I can not understand one single negative review.  Now You See Me has got to be one of the best, cleanest ( no filthy language or sex scenes) yet lots of action and fun films I have had the pleasure to watch; and, It was interesting to see the reality behind the  ""magic"" !  So I have determined that those who wrote negative reviews about this movie would most likely be unhappy if they were given a gold rope studded with precious gems to hang themselves with. That's my truth and I am sticking to it!  Now You See Me is a wonderful, fun filled movie, fit for any family!  I can't wait until July when the next one premiers.  Buy this movie, you will be glad you did~*~",1467417600,15,1056,4.16256157635468

The acting (other than ruffalo and freeman) is seriously horrible.. ruffalo and freeman have shi**y roles to play and still pull it off so, props to them.. The only thing good about this movie is the visual effects. Seriously stupid plot. The story progresses in the most ridiculous fashion. There is no depth, no character development. Forced progression, Forced sub plots, Forced dialog.. this is as bad as the movie dragon wars. I cannot think of any reason for anyone to watch this movie.",1467417600,2,604,4.761904761904762

5517471,3,B00AW9M8N6,"A fun movie that leaves you wishing they did just a bit more magic. They talk a lot about doing magic, but the actual performances are a bit brief.

The story concerns four street magicians who get recruited into doing a major set of magical productions that revolve around Robin Hood style thievery. There are lots of twists and turns and some fun interaction between the key characters. Much like a magic show, nothing is ever quite what it seems.

We saw the movie when it first came out. Watched the sequel at the theater and then came back to watch this again. One thing that is noticeable doing it that quickly is that there are some dubious plot devices between the two movies. Each movie on its own though is pretty interesting.",1466812800,2,736,4.526315789473684

5517724,4,B00AW9M8N6,"Is magic real? Maybe. However for centuries there are those who don't have one ounce of true magical ability in the literal sense of the word but are able to convince others they do, usually audiences willing to suspend their ""disbelief"". These people are called ""magicians"", and magicians have been performing before amazed crowds since Antiquity and the Middle Ages to the present. The film in question ""Now You See Me"", the first half of the phrase ""Now you see me, now you don't"", takes us into the world of magicians. The main performers, four diverse magicians of mediocre talents, have been brought together to become the Four Horsemen, I assume their name deriving from the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse as labeled in the Book of Revelation.

Four different magicians have been summoned by Tarot cards for an unknown purpose: Merritt McKinney, whose card is the Hermit, a hypnotist and mentalist (Woody Harrelson), Daniel ""Danny"" Atlas, whose card is the Lover, an arrogant illusionist (Jesse Eisenberg), Henley Reeves, whose card is the High Priestess, an escape-artist similar to Houdini (Isla Fisher), and Jack Wilder, Tarot card Death, a sleight of hand illusionist and street magician (Dave Franco). At the beginning of the film they were magicians who performed spontaneously for small crowds. Through the Tarot cards, they are summoned by an unknown ""benefactor"" and eventually financed by Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine), an insurance magnate. In a year, they evolve from unknown street magicians to a nationally-known headline act, the Four Horsemen. They perform in large venues in Las Vegas and New York.

Their escapades catch the eye of FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) and U.S. law enforcement when they appeared to have enacted a magical heist from a bank in France. Interpol in Europe also gets involved, and they send a young inexperienced agent Alma Dray (Mlanie Laurent), a French criminal researcher who has interest in the occult. As the stunts of the Four Horsemen keep getting larger, involving ever-larger sums of money, Alma and Rhodes find themselves battling a formidable foe. The Horsemen use their magic ""act"" as a kind of misdirection, and the FBI and Interpol always seem one to two steps behind them. The FBI starts to question the motives of Alma in part because they wander if there is a ""fifth horseman"" as yet unknown but pulling many of the strings.

Also on their trail is Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman), a modern-day skeptic whose show and DVD's expose ""magic"" fraud, similar to Houdini's exposing of sance frauds in the early 20th century. Thirty years previous to the events of the film, Thaddeus exposed another magician, Lionel Shrike. His career was all but ruined at the hands of Thaddeus, until he decided to engage in a comeback by attempting to escape from a safe thrown into the Hudson River. He never escaped and was presumed dead. As a result, the ""magic"" community has had an adversarial relationship with Thaddeus. FBI agent Rhodes tries to ingratiate himself to Thaddeus, hoping the exposer of magic fraud will help them capture the Four Horsemen. The game becomes a kind of cat and mouse in which Rhodes is bent on exposing and arresting the Four Horsemen and using Thaddeus as a kind of double-agent. However, Thaddeus appears less than impressed with the FBI, and although he's not entirely on the side of the Four Horsemen, he seems to admire their tricks. He also has his own agenda, wanting footage for his upcoming show.

A fun-filled, action-packed heist-thriller with a certain amount of intelligence. The acting is superb, and the cast of the Four Horsemen are diverse enough we buy into their little eccentricities. Freeman makes an excellent Thaddeus Bradley, constantly pointing out the ineptitude of the FBI. And Caine is a good billionaire magnate who stays somewhat behind the scenes to finance the money-making endeavors of the Four Horsemen. During the film, different miss-directions are explained by Freeman which is half the fun. A good escapist film. But don't try the stunts at home!",1466553600,,4078,5.037037037037037

5517816,4,B00AW9M8N6,"Great movie.  They did a great job building intrigue from the very beginning,  keeping viewer attention,  and not giving much away.  I enjoyed being kept guessing,  but gave 4 stars because I felt that the ending was sloppy.",1466467200,,224,4.7894736842105265
5517817,3,B00AW9M8N6,"The movie was fantastic, it's one of my favorites, but let me address the Amazon Prime viewing experience first. 'Rewinding' was incredibly difficult. Always seemed to take us back to the exact same part of the movie, then it was difficult again trying to forward to our current place. Once we finally would get there, picture would be grainy & blurry for about 45-60 seconds. We also weren't impressed with CC feature  (which we tried using so we didn't have to go back if we missed pieces of dialogue): the CC often provided just bits of sentences . We bought the movie though; it's fast-paced & will keep you hooked from beginning to end. Suitable for kids 10+, there's one scene where a couple is ripping off each other's clothes, but they're ultimately interrupted before it gets too racy. Fair amount of swearing but no F-bomb. Fantastic special effects & well-acted, though a few aspects of the revelation are pretty hard to believe. This is one you want to rewatch once it's all laid out for you. Good set-up for NYSM2, and Definitely not one to miss!!",1466467200,,1060,4.668449197860962

For those of us who grew up watching magicians do their thing, (not without the help of their lovely assistants of course), this tale of illusion, slight-of-hand and misdirection is definitely worth the time.

The first 15-20 minutes may not blow you socks off with excitement but it gets pretty cool and fast moving once they are all together as a team. Interesting characters, good plot and good acting by everyone based on the fact it's not meant to be a deep thought provoking movie. It's meant to entertain and it does deliver on that for sure. Definitely worth seeing and actually even with your family. A few scenes appear to be turning into something sexual but they stop long before anyone would get embarrassed with kids watching.

5518408,3,B00AW9M8N6,"Ehh... okay, for an impromptu stay at home movie and popcorn night with the missus (she went to sleep about halfway through).  I stuck with it for the quasi-interesting sci-fi trickery and special effects, which get about 2.5 stars.  IMHO, it was at best a mediocre production with tiresomely predictable hollywoodized-easily-manipulated LE response and international/interagency tensions which are all too often the case in the real world, too.  A depiction of strong, unusual, highly effective, and smart cooperation would have been refreshing and entertaining.

I opted for the extended cut version (about 10 minutes extra), which I think may have been mostly filler including frequent, gratuitous, and depressing usage of the Lord's name in blasphemous vain... what a pitiful example of linguistic ignorance and disrespect to set for younger viewers and what a tiresome imitation of the verbally challenged in our real lives!  Ugh!  I would have given it only two stars for dishonorable language alone, except that more people read 3-star than 2-star reviews.

It's a bad flick; not horrible, but not good, and left quite a lot of room for viewer conversation until boredom brought sleep.  At least, I am now forwarned and do not plan to watch the sequel.",1465948800,,1259,5.198019801980198

5518483,4,B00AW9M8N6,"The movie is a giant plot hole. I just want to get that out of the way right away because it is the first thing any critic will say, as well as their last line of defense. The movie itself is great. Lots of fun action, witty dialogue, and delightful examples of well-executed sleights. Taken as a movie to sit back and watch for some laughs and action it is absolutely wonderful. It also has the distinction of being one of the few light movies that is worth multiple viewings, because new details will keep presenting themselves (usually showing a hidden brilliance in the writing, but occasionally it sheds light on more of the gaping plot holes). Danny says he wants you to watch closely, because the closer you think you are the less you will actually see. This is true of the movie itself. If you look at the details, you will she the horrible miscarriage that is the attempt at clever orchestration. It you sit back and suspend disbelief, much like in a real magic show, you have a couple of hours of fun that you don't have to worry about shaking the foundations of your world.",1465948800,,1084,4.452261306532663

Some of the magic is fun to watch, but the story is so mangled and poorly told that I couldn't even finish it. Some of the acting was wooden, character motivations were unclear, plot holes abounded, and overall it just had the feel of hastily put together project intended just to make a few bucks, not to truly entertain.

If you're looking to scratch a magical itch, you might enjoy ""The Prestige"" as an alternative to NYSM.",1465689600,,540,4.346534653465347

I watched with a friend  who had seen it a couple times already so we paused and back tracked a few times to make sure I saw something before moving forward... will sit down and watch it again...is one of those movies you can watch multiple times and see things you completely missed before...definitely held my attention right up to the end....

wanted to see this one before seeing #2... REALLY glad I did... I think this would probably be required viewing before seeing 2nd one... don't know how you  could get the full impact of #2 without seeing this one first...

Mark Ruffalo is excellent, I always like him, but I really enjoyed him in this role!... Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine are of course awesome in their roles as  well...  not a big Woody Harrelson fan... but I liked him in this movie...

definitely an ""Expect the Unexpected"" flick... personally I loved it!",1465516800,,1138,4.8

It's got all the big-budget ducks quaking, but in both viewings I just never resonated with any of the characters, nor were any of them written to resonate with each other, and the actors never got their roles to seem convincingly real-world.  Also, the outlandish conceit that any of the tricks could be pulled off in real life wore thin on its first appearance in the film.  Yet, I watched it again.

The problem was that the story was too big for the movie.  As a result, a lot of character development and plot details were lacking.  And there were moments when I found myself asking ""How did we get from there to here?"".

This film starts off with a ""cheap trick"" commonly seen by audiences and performed by magicians (or illusionists, as some like to be called).

The ending (with a strange, unexpected reveal about who is gathering ""The Four Horsemen"") was a bit perplexing, obfuscating, confusing, bewildering, stunning, etc. The token old ""black and white"" legendary actors, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, squaring off against each other was indeed interesting.

Why (?) There's absolutely nothing to be said for it.

Long stretches of the movie are nothing but supposed Las Vegas show-type magic tricks . . . that obviously couldn't actually be done and therefore are of no interest whatsoever.

The dialogue is atrociously cutesy . . . the big name stars (Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman) are disproportionate for the roles they play (just another financing-the-movie-with-box-office-names paycheck for the actors) . . . and there's no reason to care about any of the actors.

I am not one for giving away any of the info as to what to expect, kind of ruins it for me and geeesh; would rather not know ahead of time what's going to happen, so will just say that if you are into movies with jaw dropping magical illusionists and a plot for a huge bank robbery too; this is it.

I think this fillm is similiar to The Italian Job (which I also like!) with the suspense and action.

When  I looked the movie up onine to see when it was made I learned that Now You See Me 2 is coming out in January 2016.",1451520000,,436,3.9885057471264367
5520388,1,B00AW9M8N6,"The previews for this movie make it look like its going to be Ocean's 11 with magicians, which sounds amazing.  Sadly it is not. Instead of focusing on the magicians and how they managed to get away with all there tricks, the movie focuses most of the action around an FBI detective whose main job appears to be yelling at the French woman from Interpol trying to helping as he continues to make terrible decisions and then blames here.

Then the ending has a twist that seems to come out of nowhere and not in a good way, more in a ""Oh, we need to end this movie...let do this"" kinda way.

Usually I can let plot holes go but this movie go but this is a freakin' sink hole:

***Spoiler Alert***

How did Mark Ruffalo's character know we would get assigned that case? Who spends 20+ years planning that elaborate of a revenge plan?
Seriously though what is ""The Eye""? Is it that carousel, but that seems super lame? How did Mark Ruffalo get in? Why did I waste so much time on this movie?",1451260800,4,988,4.290322580645161

The great thing about watching it the first time is you don't know anything and I mean anything - who really are the bad guys and who is the one manipulating everyone else.  Watching the moves between the FBI and the magicians was great, and then watching it after the first time when you KNOW who is really who is fun, picking up and the bits that you now understand as something important that wasn't that important the first time through.  It is a fun movie-cheering for the magicians and wanting them to get away with it, while still not wanting the FBI agent to fail either.  I enjoyed it a lot and sort of wish they could do some sort of sequel- but then again I doubt it could match the original.",1449446400,3,802,4.222222222222222

5520455,2,B00AW9M8N6,"Only tangentially a genre film: It really is a caper film in which regardless of how fantastic the CGI enhanced visuals you see on screen, all are meant to have a realistic rational explanation.
Having even minor inside knowledge on the mechanics of magic can only hurt.

But really... how far ahead of time can you plan a caper, all the while predicting exactly how a group of known individuals and multiple other unknown ones will react, before we reach the uncanny, even taking into a account an unrealistic depiction of puppet master hypnotism? (Trilby is considered genre, why not this?)
Frankly, it reaches and stretches the limits of the villain's plan in Skyfall (who, at least, had unlimited resources and a full team of experts behind him.)

The film is hurt by the lack of focus on any one character: Who are the heroes, the magicians or the crime investigators? Even when that focus is finally achieved there is a lack of depth due to the need of future reveals in the story.
A focus on the magicians and their dilemma in being manipulated by a mastermind would seem to be a no-brainer decision - but that is not what we get. Who cares about the clueless investigator?

Since we do not know what path we are being led down there is no suspense, merely disorientation. And many after-the-fact and over-explained revelations of the modus operandi feel at best anticlimactic and at worst pure BS (""I bribed the maintenance guy with fifty bucks."")

Only when we have a main player death on screen does the film obtain a sense of urgency, but any expectations of a tense caper film have since evaporated and by then we know to expect merely a simple chase film.

Plenty of questions as to how and why remain unanswered, but to mention them here would generate spoilers.

A last scene is reminiscent of the last scene in The Ninth Gate: The final option for inclusion of genre is the existence of an Illuminati-like order of magicians whose existence remains in doubt even as the credits roll.

Does not really work as a caper film nor as genre.
Overall an unsatisfying experience. Not recommended.",1446422400,,2104,4.685636856368563

Always have some kind of project going and often they are in something quietly good. I don't really know what to say about Jesse Eisenberg. He just interesting to watch. He doesn't really play anything other than Jesse Eisenberg. Jesse on speed dial or Jesse being snarky or Jesse being rattled are all the same. He's interesting to watch though. Add all those guys together and throw in about three really interesting tricks with a lot of show and bombast in a plot that does everything but drop a safe on your head (keep that image you will get the joke later) to let you know what is going on.

This may contain SPOILERS.  I will give advance warning prior to writing any.
Allow me to give you my two-cents about movie reviews.  However, first, I need to do so by a comparison.
I painted my den using a flat red paint.  Why?  Because I liked it!  Some of my friends liked it and some didn't.  My point is obvious -- Some will like this film; others won't.  Does it really matter what good ole' Mike from Philly thinks about this movie?  Possibly, because if you are reading this, you are curious about NYSM (Now You See Me). Maybe you watched it and want to know what other people think.  Maybe you haven't watched it and want feedback before you do (or don't) spend two hours of your life viewing this film.  Who know?
I read at least 25 reviews about NYSM after I watched it yesterday.  The reviews were quite varied and ratings were between 1 and 10.
I'm rambling, so I'll get to my point!
To me (and MANY others,) Morgan Freeman is one of the better actors alive. Shawshack Redemption is proof of that to me. His characters are all believable.  One actually believes whatever role he plays -- at least I do.
NYSM is listed as a ""crime; mystery; thriller.""  It has all three.  It delivers all three.  However, there are some parts of the film that are simply totally absurd and beyond belief of anyone over the age of three. **SPOILER COMING NEXT**
For just one example at random, during the car chase scene, what are the odds that all they key cars would be on that bridge and pre-plan the events that happened including the detective getting that ""clue"" out of the burning wreckage seconds before it explodes and getting it in one piece (not burned)?  You'd have better odds of winning a major lottery every week for life!  Also, WHY did the Four Horsemen"" leave their illusion (magic trick) in an empty arena so the Feds could figure out how it works?  Freeman wasn't needed to figure out that trick!)  And how the heck did a merry-go-round appear in Center Park and get activated by a glass encased card in a tree??...Okay, enough of the silliness...there's more, but that's plenty! **END OF SPOILER**
***********************************SPOILER PART OVER -- SAFE TO READ ON!****************************
Despite the absurdities, I ENJOYED THE FILM!  It entertained me so much that I didn't expect the ""surprise ending"" and other twists that were predictable if I had given enough thought.
Look, I LIKE my red den.  I LIKE this film.  My red den will NOT be in any home magazine.  This film is NOT a masterpiece although a sequel is set for 2016 release. It earned $351,723,989 worldwide against a $75 million budget!
I also read in Wikipedia that actress 'Isla Fisher came close to drowning. Fisher had gotten stuck and tried to alert the crew by banging on the window she was facing, but the cast and crew did not think anything of it because that was what the character was supposed to be doing. She was able to untangle the chain and get out of the tank safely.'  That must have been horrifying.
So....if you're the type who nitpicks movies and wants classics, this is likely NOT for you.  But if you put all that aside and simply ENJOY a clever mystery movie that uses magic as its backdrop, I believe you'll enjoy this one. It has some defects (""eights"") but is also has some aces--especially during the first 30-45 minutes. But after all, magic is just an illusion!  ENJOY IT!",1439337600,3,3405,4.596026490066225

5520629,1,B00AW9M8N6,"If you want to waste $2.99 to see a pretty train wreck (CGI and other flashy affects) then I recommend this movie to you, otherwise, please stay away! Many reviews have already noted how the plot is not plausible, that is not my problem with this movie. I just simply do not understand the point and I truly do not believe anyone involved in this movie knows what the point is either. Lets say magic is real, therefore suspending belief/reality is not necessary. Okay, the story is based around four randomly chosen magicians (""the four horsemen"") who blindly follow orders from an unknown person/entity to be part of some secret magical society - WHY?!?! Mind you, these orders could land them in federal prison thus ending their freedom and by default any chance at a career - but they do so anyway for no disclosed reason. They espouse some random Robin Hood type garbage about taking money from the rich and giving it to the poor, instantly gaining popularity from the general public even though the general public really has no damn idea why ""the four horsemen"" are doing this crap in the first place.  Apparently this unknown person/entity is having them do this to avenge the death of some long forgotten dude who isn't even in the movie in the first place, and the ""four horsemen"" aren't even aware of anyway, so again, WHAT IS THE POINT?! How can you do something in someone's honor if no one knows you're doing it for that person to begin with?!?!  Of course, as with any Hollywood production, there has to be some random woman (Mlanie Laurent) involved to be someone's love interest even though it really serves no damn purpose to the story and could be eliminated entirely.  Not even Morgan Freeman and Woody Harrelson could save this movie, they are the only highlights. It serves absolutely no purpose and the ending is absolutely horrible, they try to sum it up but the explanation is simply pathetic.  They attempt to 'wow' you by disclosing the person/entity behind it all but it's just too pathetic to put into words by the time you get to that point. I cannot believe they are making a sequel.  If you want to know why I believe this is one of dumbest movies I have seen in a very long time, continue reading, otherwise stop as it does contain a spoiler.

This movie isn't even about Harry Potter type magic nor can it be classified as illusions, it's just GARBAGE. The movie seriously wants you to believe that a ""magician"" was able to fake his death by switching cars during the car chase scene which takes place on a busy bridge.  How does he do that?  One of the other fools is driving a CITY BUS with an identical car attached to the front of it and they're able to switch the cars without anyone noticing.  Like seriously, no one is going to notice a CITY BUS WITH A CAR ATTACHED TO THE FRONT OF IT?!?! I guess people are just used to seeing that every day and wouldn't think nothing of it.....",1435104000,4,2919,4.523719165085389

This is just a big misfire, in every way.  And it's incredible, due to a winning cast.  The acting from really good actors is so bad that it must be the writing and direction.  Ugh.

Well, the plot is not believable, so there's the writing part, to start.  Ugh.

When I hate a film, I either write a long review, or a short review.  I'm going with the latter today.  Ugh.  Oh, did I write, ""Ugh"" yet?  Just in case:  Ugh.",1428105600,,628,3.991869918699187

5520729,5,B00AW9M8N6,"One of the BEST movies I have seen in a long time! At first I was a little scared to watch this film, Some people said it wasn't that good but after reading the review for the film on amazon, I decided to give the movie a try. This was the best $7.99 I have ever spent on a movie! I have NEVER seen a movie like this before ever step of the way the film keeps you guessing until the plot of the film is revealed at the end! What a spectacular performance from each actor/actress! This movie is definitely worth 5 stars! Should've known this movie would be good. I've been a Jesse Eisenberg fan ever sense I saw him act over 10 years ago in Wes Craven film ""Cursed""! Since that film, Jesse hasn't disappointed me at all! Of course Woody  Harrison, Amy Adams, And James Franco little brother, Dave Franco are awesome as well. I don't want to give anything away about the film but I will say if you want to see a movie like no other and you're tired of watching remakes of the 40's, 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's, & 90's films, then check this out!!",1427068800,4,1039,4.143564356435643

5520747,5,B00AW9M8N6,"Really fun movie about 4 magicians who make it big, but then end up being pursued by the FBI. starts off a little slow but about 10 minutes in to the movie the pace picks up when they are performing at the mgm grand. BEWARE: this is an addictive movie for magic lovers and, in my case, morgan freeman fans. Very well made. Looks like this movie also had a very large budget. The special effects are great for this kind of movie. The character development and personas are very grey in some areas till the end. SPOILER ALERT: there is a significant plot twist at the end with one of the characters that you will not see coming. This is a cool movie. Also, a fun one. This is a movie that would be fun for both kids an adults alike. I only noticed one thing -towards the beginning of the movie that might not be appropriate (but mildly inappropriate). As a whole this movie is suitable for children (maybe 10 and up), and would keep their attention. overall, great movie, love the casting, and I love how they make magic feel real.

5520748,3,B00AW9M8N6,"This was basically an action film masquerading somewhat as a mystery.  It lacked sufficient dramatic irony in the form of clues, such as actual mysteries have, to qualify as a true mystery genre film; instead, the mystery, like many of the tricks in the film, was an illusion, obscured by a fast pace and special effects.  Ultimately, the plot seemed implausible to me, and there was insufficient resolution of certain plot themes to bring a truly satisfying conclusion.  This being said, it was entertaining, and the pace of the film and the plot worked together to maintain interest throughout.  Caine and Freeman performed their parts well, as usual, and helped to anchor the rest of the cast.",1426377600,,696,4.923076923076923

The plot to this movie (while a bit cliche in romance) is just simply amazing!

5520869,5,B00AW9M8N6,"As far as pure entertainment goes, this movie knocked it out of the park.

I scrolled through the 1-star reviews and wasn't surprised to see that the people who hated this movie REALLY hated it. There were loads of comments that attacked not only the movie (""no plot,"" ""fake,"" ""confusing"") but the 5-star reviewers as well (""go back to Transformers and other movies that don't require a brain""). After seeing this movie twice, I'd like to put my two cents in.

The first time through I was thoroughly entertained and thoroughly bewildered. Visually, it's stunning. The special effects are used to create some of the most jaw-dropping magic tricks I've ever seen. Is it real? Of course not. Do I care that it's CGI and not really possible? Nope. Not at all. I've seen real-life magic tricks that didn't seem real either - that's the whole point of magic. I was perfectly happy to sit back and enjoy the ride.

Did I understand everything the first time through? Nope. I'm not even going to pretend I saw the ending coming. I spent the entire movie doing EXACTLY what the filmmakers wanted me to do - and that's follow the misdirection. This movie has layers upon layers of misdirection, and it moves so fast that you don't have time to stop and puzzle anything out. Did I care that I was sometimes confused? Nope. Not at all. If the magic tricks were obvious then this movie would have been boring as hell.

Was I still scratching my head a little after the big reveal? Yup. Sure was. That's why I watched it a second time through. Well, that, and because it was just SO cool I wanted to see it again. But the second time through I knew all the secrets ahead of time, so I was able to really watch the actors - and THAT is where the real magic happened. The cast is an eclectic ensemble and the acting was top-notch from just about everyone. I caught so many subtle glances, subtle hints, quick one-liners that I had missed the first time through. As I watched it the second time, all the subtle clues clicked into place and I was even more blown away.

This movie is a brilliant bit of magic. The plot is air-tight. The fact that I had to see it twice to put all the pieces together tells you that it's clever and really sharply written. (And for the nay-sayers - No, I'm not a moron. I'm college-educated with an IQ of 146). Did they use CGI to ""cheat"" with the magic tricks? Sure, but who cares. I love futuristic sci-fi movies that imagine what *might* be possible, and isn't that what magic is all about?

This isn't a 'turn your brain off' kind of movie. Quite the opposite, in fact. I was completely engaged throughout, trying to solve the puzzles before they were revealed. Throw in the glitz & glamour of a magic show and it makes for a spectacularly entertaining movie. Not to mention - it's also really funny. Between the football players and the violinists, I was actually shrieking with laughter.

I try to save 5-star reviews for movies that truly have a wow-factor. This is one of those movies. My guess is that some of the 1-star folks didn't like it because in order to enjoy this movie you have to be willing to give up control of the experience. You have to be willing to suspend disbelief and just go with it. It's a magic show. The entire point is to wow you by fooling you - and this movie does exactly that. It's hands-down one of the most clever, entertaining movies I have ever seen. BIG 5-stars!!",1419638400,,3421,4.437898089171974

Instead of a rabbit out of  a hat, they rob a bank). Thrilling plot and good acting. Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson were particularly brilliant in their roles as superintelligent con artists.

My only complaints were: 1. The romance between Mark Ruffalo (playing an FBI agent) and his beautiful partner (Melanie Laurent) was utterly predictable, 2. The ending was a little disappointing. Sorry, I can't be more specific- I don't want to spoil it by giving too manyany detail.

Four street magicians are brought together to perform a series of magic tricks (called The Four Horsemen), each one more impressive and public than the last.

Some of the tricks are believable, others seem less credible, and that takes away from the movie here and there.

Morgan Freeman plays a former magician who makes a living explaining magic tricks. As always, he does a fine job.

The FBI gets involved, but the Horsemen stay ahead of them, as they rob a bank, con an insurance company owner who cheated policy holders, and then steals from a shady security company.

5520890,2,B00AW9M8N6,"This movie is slickly shot, and the characters are entertaining (that's why I gave it two instead of one star), although they have no depth and you know no more about them at the end of the flick than at the beginning.  The ""magic"" shows have a true Vegas type of appearance that's fun to watch.  That only gets you so far, though.

Yes, it's true that most of the ""magic tricks"" are generated in a computer (which you realize very fast) rather than  for real as movies did before current technology took over, but if this was better written, that would not be a problem.  Yes, it's true that there's sort of a breezy illogicalness about it, but then, this is a ""caper"" film.  The flaw in this movie goes much deeper.

Briefly put, ""there is no There, there"".  THE MOVIE MAKES NO SENSE!  There are plot holes so big you could sail the entire US Navy through them.  Yes, this is not intended to be a movie  designed for precise scrutiny, but it's still a caper movie, where things are supposed to make sense within the universe of the film.  ""Entrapment"", ""Ocean's Eleven (either version)"" and dozens of other caper movies (including the original Pink Panther series!) require a suspension of disbelief, but they hang together.  This one doesn't, and doesn't even try.

There are scenes where your first reaction is, ""Wow, that was clever!"", but then a second later you realize that, no they weren't being clever, they were simply ignoring everything that didn't work.  The filmmakers were so busy admiring themselves and how flashy they were they simply didn't bother to actually produce something that works.  For example, it's one thing in the opening of  ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" for Bond to escape because he has a parachute in his backpack.  He's James Bond!  Of Course he would have a parachute in his backpack!  And they showed you him putting on the backpack.  But let's say you're watching a James Bond movie and you see Bond go over a cliff in a car.  You see close-ups of Bond in the car.  There are shots of Bond taken in the car as it is already falling.  It's made very clear that Bond is actually in the car.  You see a continuous shot of the car as it falls all the way down, Bond is visible inside the whole time, and it explodes on impact.  No one gets out.  Very handsomely done.  But then in the next scene Bond is walking along the road, totally unscratched.  Nothing is ever said about how he's alive and he doesn't seem at all interested in what just happened.

THE WHOLE MOVIE IS LIKE THIS!

Want proof?  Without putting in too much of a spoiler for those who haven't seen it, take the bank robbery early in the film.  When Morgan Freeman tells you how the ""trick"" was done, he doesn't explain how come the armored car guards never noticed they had been drugged.  more importantly,  What happened to the audience member (who they went to great pains to show wasn't in on the trick) after he was ""teleported"" to the bank and the money disappeared.  How does he get back?  Why doesn't he just walk outside afterwards (at which the point the whole ""illusion"" collapses) and say to someone, ""You know what just happened to me""?  Come to think of it, why didn't he break his leg when he ""arrived"" at the bank (when you see the scene you'll understand)?  He could blow the whole thing, so instead of the writers actually thinking of a way to handle this, he just vanishes from existence in the movie.

THE WHOLE MOVIE IS LIKE THIS!

It's bad enough the writing and story is so poor, but the production was phoned in.  It's like they have contempt for their audience.  Want one of many examples?  Watch the big second ""magic"" show.  As they move around the stage, Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher) will be wearing a pantsuit.  The camera leaves her to focus on action elsewhere.  When she comes back into frame, she's wearing a miniskirt with  Ms. Fisher's rather impressive legs on full display.  And then a few second's later she's back in the pantsuit (except when she's back  in the skirt again).  Since this is obviously  not part of the act (no one reacts to it), clearly the act sequence was filmed over multiple days/shots and no one bothered to check  continuity when they assembled the complete sequence, or simply didn't care because they figured the audience would be too oblivious to notice.

THE WHOLE MOVIE IS LIKE THIS!

..and as many have commented, the ""twist"" at the ending Makes No Sense At All and makes a lot of what you saw before a cheat.  That's the problem: a good illusionist Fools you; here they Cheat you",1418774400,4,4542,4.505521472392638

5520936,2,B00AW9M8N6,"Really??  If you make a heist movie, it has to be believable to a certain degree.  The things that happen have to be at least within the realm of possibility, otherwise you have moved into the fantasy/superhero genre.  This one however is clearly not fantasy.  It lost me with the handcuff trick during the police interrogation.  If he is going to pull that off, it has to be with his own set of 'trick' cuffs, not the ones attached to the interrogation table in the police station.  It only went downhill from there.  The twist at the end...I'm sorry, the whole movie was so absurd, by then I was done trying to guess, because none of it made sense anyway.  Ocean's Eleven was great...this was rubbish.",1415404800,5,703,4.523809523809524

Unfortunately, the ""Used - Like New"" copy I received from a secondary seller was defective causing the movie to freeze and skip, however Amazon refunded the purchase price and shipping charges.  Anyway, this is about the movie, not the seller, so I won't go into his behavior, which wasn't appreciated.  Like I said, Amazon made it right.  I saw this movie in the theater the first time and later viewed it on one of the movie channels.  I noticed that the ending changed.  This disc has the version I saw on television, however it also has several scenes that were cut from both versions, as well as the alternate ending that I originally saw in the theater.  I've been highly entertained by this video.  If you like illusion and a little light mystery without much violence, this is a great bet.  Enjoy!",1413331200,,841,4.628378378378378

There is no interest here in speaking negatively or critiquing the movie in a way that is not thoughtful.  However, for me, it was not a movie that I particularly enjoyed as the plot progressed.  Rather than Amazon categorizing this movie as a Thriller, Mystery it would be better to be categorized something that doesn't suggest it is either thrilling or mysterious.",1412985600,,600,4.740384615384615

I would rate this movie as a C or C-, entertaining most of the time, but no substance.  Definitely a rental over a purchase in my opinion.

Woody Harrelson is a funny, funny dude. The actual story is kind of crap though and requires willful suspension of disbelief at times, especially at the end. They pulled a nonsensical, Shamalama-ding-dong plot twist, and well, I won't spoil it, but it really shouldn't have happened. Everything I liked about the movie up until that point was ruined by the ending... if you must see it, I'd watch it and then just shut if off 15 minutes before it ends.

5521001,5,B00AW9M8N6,"I would seriously consider giving this one 7 stars if I could.  As a writer, I have grown to understand that when a great story is created, it is almost impossible to make a film that isn't great as well.  The story upon which this film is based is the creation of Boaz Yakin and Edward Ricourt which led to the screenplay by Ed Solomon and the two story creators.  The tale is so convoluted that no matter how many really good guesses one makes while watching it for the first time, it will still surprise and maybe even shock some.  Sure there will be that odd person who will swear, I saw that coming but they're not telling you the truth.  The first reaction you will have at the end of this film is a nearly violent urge to watch it again, right now.  Its that good!",1410998400,,771,4.175675675675675

5521023,5,B00AW9M8N6,"this is probably one of the best ""Caper"" movies I have seen.

Harrelson does a great job as Merrill Mckinney a Daren Brown like character. What? who's Darren Brown? Oh! Come on, Google him, he's only the best mentalist out there.  Personally, I love Jesse Eisenberg's character J Daniel Atlas. Not for the magic tricks, but the attitude... he treats the FBI like we would all like to treat the FBI!  Isla Fisher (Henley Reeves) adds beauty in much the same way Catherine Zeta-Jones did in Entrapment... which much the same affect.  Down boy.  Dave Franco (Jack Wilder), plays the go-for, you know go for this, go for that and adds the male beauty to the team.

Together they are ""The Four Horsemen""  pursued by a tenacious FBI agent Mark ""Don't make me angry"" Ruffalo (Dylan Rhodes), mysterious Melanie Laurent (Alma Dray), an Interpol Desk clerk, and Morgan Freeman (Thaddeus Bradley) who plays a sort of James Randi with panache.

Finally and rounding off this great cast is Michael Cain (Arthur Tressler) who plays a filthy rich insurance baron and the money behind the Horsemen.

The plot is fast and very entertaining and I am not going to talk about it ... spoilers...  so jut watch it. If you like the Ocean's movies this is better, a sort of Oceans four meets Robin Hood, meets skulls!

5521036,2,B00AW9M8N6,"Having delved into the realm of stage magic, I was hoping ""Now You See Me"" would present a more authentic (and thus more involving) depiction of the industry than some of the recent films that used this profession as their backdrop (e.g. ""The Prestige"" and ""The Illusionist""). No such luck. ""Now You See Me"" gets as much wrong as those other films, and then some. The tricks performed in the film are either done with obvious special effects or sleight-of-hand maneuvers so stupid they wouldn't  fool the dimmest audience member. (For example, a scene in which audience members draw numbered ping pong balls from buckets and then pass the balls to the magician without  first reading the numbers on the balls.)

Great actors do their best (Mark Ruffalo, Morgan Freeman, Woody Harrelson), but are given precious little to work with. The idea of slight-of-hand artists coming together to commit a big con is pretty good, but the ultimate motive given for their team-up is contrived to say the least. And the ending shamelessly rips off both ""Usual Suspects"" AND ""The Illusionist.""

Oh, and if the filmmakers happen to be reading this, you failed on even the most basic level to get anything about the mechanics of stage magic right, or most anything else about the business. The stupidest offense? Including a character who ""debunks"" magicians. Seriously? I'm guessing you had in mind a James Randi-type figure who debunks phony spiritualists/psychics who use sleight-of-hand gimmicks, of which there are none in this film. Freeman's character would not become a successful media figure by revealing (not ""debunking"") magicians tricks. He would at best host a few poorly made specials on Fox before being quickly forgotten.",1408320000,,1721,5.070671378091872

This is like the TV shows Leverage, or Mission Impossible taken to a whole new level because not only do they accomplish the impossible but they had not worked as a team before this. In other words their unified tricks even amazes themselves. Although this movie is 5 minutes short of 2 hours, it is so fast paced that it is over before you know it.

A quick opening sequence introduces our four magicians: mentalist Merrit McKinley (Woody Harrelson), escape artist Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher), pick-pocket Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) and card magician Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), who are all brought together by an unknown benefactor to partake in a series of stage illusions, each one more elaborate than the last.

With shows set in Las Vegas, New Orleans and New York, the self-proclaimed ""Four Horseman"" declare their intention of robbing a bank of several million dollars - something they apparently pull off, much to the FBI's befuddlement. Unable to explain how it was done, and powerless to detain them without advocating the existence of real magic, the FBI is forced to let them go.

Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) is the agent who sticks with the case, paired with French Interpol representative Alma Dray (Mlanie Laurent) who both attempt to get one step ahead of the Horsemen. Helping them is Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) an ex-magician who now exposes and explains various tricks, whilst the Horsemen have wealthy benefactor Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine) in their corner.

It's an enticing premise, though a somewhat misleading one. Watching the trailers you'd be forgiven for thinking that the focus of the film is on FBI agents trying to bring high-tech criminals to justice, with the magicians themselves as the savvy anti-heroes. In truth, Dylan Rhodes is this film's protagonist, and the question of whether or not the Horsemen are really using magic, and whether this can be tried under law, isn't dwelt on.

Instead, this is a crime-caper, packed full of red herrings and misdirection, in which the audience is left guessing as to means and motivation, and even the Horsemen themselves aren't 100% sure who's pulling the strings. Despite its big-name cast and glossy veneer, the characterization is paper-thin (relying almost entirely on the charisma of the actors) and its resolution is incredibly convoluted (demanding at least one re-watch to try and untangle it all), but as an entertaining popcorn flick it fits the bill.

Hardly a classic, but fun while it lasts.",1408060800,,2971,6.508860759493671

5521058,3,B00AW9M8N6,"I went into this film knowing almost nothing about it.  I'd somehow missed seeing advertisements for it, and when I saw it for sale in stores I took it to be a generic crime thriller and left it at that.  I ended up seeing it with a relative, who had seen it before, liked it, and rented it from a Redbox for the night.  And since I trusted said relative's recommendation, I decided to give it a shot.  It couldn't be terrible, right?

In a lot of ways, ""Now You See Me"" really is a generic crime caper, and it's no masterpiece of cinema.  But if you can turn your brain off for two hours, it's an enjoyable and flashy ride, with a charismatic cast helping it shine.

""Now You See Me"" introduces us to four amateur stage magicians -- illusionist Danny, mentalist Merritt, escape artist Henley, and pickpocket and sleight-of-hand artist Jack -- as they try to make a living with their various crafts.  When each of them receives a tarot card with the same address written on it, they find themselves in an abandoned apartment containing plans for an elaborate stage show... and decide to stage it themselves.  One year later, they're performing in Las Vegas under the stage name ""The Four Horsemen,"" where they pull off a long-distance bank robbery.  Soon FBI agent Dylan Rhodes and Interpol agent Alma Dray are trailing the Four Horsemen, trying to determine how they managed the heist and how to prove it.  Along the way the two agents are hassled and slyly mocked by Thaddeus, a former stage musician who's made his living debunking other magicians' tricks.  But somehow the Horsemen manage to stay one step ahead of the agents... and the Horsemen themselves are being manipulated by someone bigger behind the scenes.  Who's behind this elaborate cat-and-mouse game, and what is the ultimate goal of their biggest trick of all?

One of the biggest complaints I've heard regarding this movie -- and I'm inclined to agree -- is that the characterization of all characters is paper-thin.  The Horsemen get little characterization, each of them easily identified by their role in the group -- Danny the leader, Merritt the snarky smart guy, Henley the token girl, and Jack the nave new guy.  The two agents aren't any better, simply being the stereotypical ""cop team"" of one angry guy and one calm and logical guy (or girl in this case) that we see so often in movies.  Thaddeus is at least interesting to watch on screen, though he's mostly just smug and condescending throughout the film.

That, and the movie is somewhat plot-hole-ish in nature.  Some of the tricks aren't explained well (how do they ignite flash paper without having a fire source nearby at all?), and the final twist in the movie feels forced and out of nowhere.  Had there been some kind of foreshadowing ahead of time, I might have enjoyed it as a clever twist, but as it stands it feels like they wanted a Shylaman moment and didn't execute it very well.

Despite this, however, the movie IS fun to watch.  The magic tricks, while obviously mostly CGI, are slick and enchanting, and despite the Four Horsemen technically being the bad guys you can't help but root for them, especially since their victims are mostly jerks and greedy people.  And there's some moments of great humor to be had in the film as well.

The cast also helps this movie shine.  The acting is well-done and enjoyable, especially Morgan Freeman as Thaddeus and Mark Ruffalo as Dylan.  Michael Caine has a small role as the Horsemen's sponsor, and as always he does a fantastic job even with his limited screen time.  Everyone seems to be having fun and enjoying themselves, and in this sort of film that's kind of the point.

Not Oscar material by any means, but this is still a fun ride, and if you like crime caper films you'll certainly enjoy this one.",1407283200,,3801,4.649700598802395

5521090,5,B00AW9M8N6,"Here is a clever combination of a heist movie with magic. As you would then expect, it is quite slick in its presentation and many of its characters. There are four magicians who meet and combine forces as ""The Four Horseman"" to enact four great magic acts. If that sounds a bit fantastic, it's because there is slight fantasy element here - the four individuals get together hoping to become part of the ""eye"", a group of master magicians who protect magic. The special effects for the magic scenes are sometimes over the top (one of the floats in a bubble) but I enjoyed them. If fantasy isn't your thing though, don't worry because it's not a large part of the movie so you may still enjoy it.

Besides the magic side of things, there are some good chase scenes and hand-to-hand fighting. The FBI and others pursue the magicians across a few different cities since they are stealing money; however, they don't keep the money so they are very much like Robin Hood. As you would expect/hope after looking over the cast list, the acting is quite good. My favorite was Jesse Eisenberg's magician character, though he seemed a LOT like the way he played Mark Zuckerberg in ""The Social Network"". All of the characters are well fleshed out. Throughout there is a bit of intrigue also because you know someone is behind the work fo the Four Horsemen, but it's difficult to guess who.

5521167,3,B00AW9M8N6,"""Let me be the first one to kick the ego to the curb"", says Woody Harrelson's character at the beginning of the film.

Ah, if only.

The irony is almost laughable.

And this is why I'm not a fan of many magic/illusionist acts - the overpowering egotism on display is too great to withstand for more than very brief spans. And putting four insufferable showboating know-it-alls on the same stage? Unbearable.

Thought the premise interesting and the story clever, but how can anyone too low on the hipster list of mocking snarks ever hope to squeeze themselves into the same space occupied by a quad of ever-expanding craniums? Even done on a fictional cinematic stage - it's extraordinarily difficult to appreciate the movie being presented.

From my perspective these are people whom I know as the Insecure Knowledge Whore. Someone who constantly *has* to have a ""greater insight"" than you or anybody within distance of their voice. Feeding off your discomfort, they're in-the-know and you, you poor low-brow slob, have no clue what's really at play.

And we're not just talking just magic - one will find these mental cases across every aspect of Life. Sadly, more so today than in years past. Interestingly, that kind of warped personality is also shared by conspiracy nutters.

People like this can't function without attempting to belittle you by way of condescension.

And, basically, these four identical polished prima donna turds were pooped from the same unpleasant mold.

Despite the film's premise that they are the Robin Hoods of Magic, adjusting the balance of society's scale; one has to remember that they weren't doing this out of some selfless sense of justice or community, but a self-interest in joining a secret club. In fact, judged outside of their ""act"", these characters have little, if any, redeeming merit.

I hunkered down and pushed thru the entire two-hours just to see ""the reveal"".

In this modern 21st Century where self-aggrandizement and unapologetic narcissism are the norm - this might be enjoyable for those who enjoy mirrors and where selfies are a common, if not daily, occurrence.

Sadly, the film's concept is lost under the massive weight of collected ego that these black holes draw to themselves.

If this wasn't such a tight, well made production, I would happily dump this into the two-star category. But it was indeed a very good movie that was unfortunately populated by unappealing clowns.

5521188,4,B00AW9M8N6,"I saw this in the theater not really knowing what to expect other than it was about magicians.

It had the potential to be really campy. But they nailed it! It was a delightful adventure for 2 hours, complete with fun plot twists!

The only downfall to it at all was that some of the schemes the characters employed worked out a little TOO perfectly. But it's a movie. So you expect a little bit of suspended disbelief.

The best part about it is how they made the whole story line, about magicians who sought the goal of REAL magic, believable. You wouldn't think that is possible but they did it.

It's not Gone With The Wind of Citizen Kane. But it's 2 hours of good entertainment that you'll enjoy.",1398211200,,702,4.376923076923077

5521203,5,B00AW9M8N6,"First, let me just state the obvious before someone 'Comments' me on not stating the obvious.

A) Yes, the plot is improbable.  But so are the plots of most other movies.  I mean, Marvel's Avengers?  Not a likely series of events, starting with gamma radiation and the Incredible Hulk and ending with practically every time Iron Man flies and then lands on the ground and not getting flattened (because there is just no shock absorber or school of physics, really, that can take the pounding he gives that suit).  But all in all, the Avengers was a great movie.  Also, any Disney or Pixar movie can pretty much be chucked into the unlikely / improbable box and many, many of those are considered timeless classics (starts singing 'a wheema way a wheema way a wheema way a wheema way').

B) Yes, the events are somewhat predictable.  Again, the plot twists - and there are a few - aren't as important in this film as the way those twists are executed.  They are executed masterfully and well worth the second watching.  Or third.

C) The storyline isn't that original, but the famous-and-probably-dead person (or people?) that stated that there are only 7 (or 5, or 11) plots in the world isn't wrong.  Or that far wrong, anyway.  It's not the originality of the storyline that makes this movie extremely enjoyable to watch.  It's the way the each separate character disappears into the forming of the singular plot (double entendre here intended) that makes the whole greater than the sum of its parts.  The play is the thing, in the case of this movie, not the players.  [Although they have their fun moments as well.]

And now for the subjective, and therefore not as obvious (although maybe obvious to those who think on the same wavelength as I do)...

(***SPOILER ALERT***)(***SPOILER ALERT***)

The coolness factor with some of the simpler tricks is pretty gosh darn high.  Even though some of these appeared in the trailers, they were still cool when I saw them again (and again) in the movie.

Here's a few.

1) The handcuff trick.  I want to be the person that pulls that off in real life.  Seriously.  Forget flying as a super power.  I want the handcuff trick.

2) Speaking of flying... The flying into nothingness towards the end of the movie was a pretty cool exit scene.  If I had to exit, stage right, I'd want it to look something like that.

3) The whole scene in the apartment when the not-so-dead magician basically runs from the bad (good?) guys by using insanely good ducking skills and a dishrag.  It was a dishrag, right?  Also, his sweater, or rather, creatively removing his sweater.  Awesome.

4) The end scene, which I am sure ticked a few people off, I actually enjoyed.  Maybe because I used to play professional poker, and it appealed to me in the same way pulling off a bluff only to find that my bluff was actually the best hand (because everyone else in the pot was on crack) does.

** SUPER SPOILER ALERT**

The fact that the end of the movie ends with actual magic was just cool for me.  Get it?  They went through this whole complicated scheme using illusion and trickery to bring fantasy into the realm of reality, when, in reality, their reward was to become part of the fantasy.  Me like!  Some may not, but then they would be wrong.",1397260800,,3272,4.583765112262522

It arrived yesterday and we watched it tonight. I was very upset to find that you can only see the Extended Edition on the Blu-Ray. I don't have a Blu-Ray player. So my friend paid twice as much for the original movie that I already own. No where on the packaging does it say the Blu-Ray will have both versions, and the DVD only the Original Theatrical version.

5521257,4,B00AW9M8N6,"Nothing like a little slight of hand to stir the excitement juices.  But when four magicians--aided by a mysterious and anonymous third party--come together to rob a French bank, the FBI comes calling, and the charms and outright fun of NOW YOU SEE ME come to the forefront.  Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher (wolf howl), and Dave Franco play the magicians; naming themselves the Four Horsemen, they rob the French bank doing a show in Las Vegas, steal all the money in their greedy benefactor's (Michael Caine) bank account in New Orleans (distributing over $140 million to the audience), and pull off the climatic show in New York by stealing a safe from a corrupt manufacturer containing half a billion dollars.  All the while a debunker of magic shows (Morgan Freeman) continues to warn the FBI Agent in charge of the investigation (Mark Ruffalo) and his Interpol counterpart (Melanie Laurent) that law enforcement is being set up for the ultimate comeuppance.  Yet there is a surprising (and very satisfying) plot twist showing ultimately who gets played the fool.  Accordingly the four magicians join the Eye, the metaphysical level for elite practitioners where magic really is magic.

This is one fun romp.  The pacing and plot and acting are all fast and furious, as the Four Horsemen are always one step ahead of their pursuers.  And it's a good thing NOW YOU SEE ME gets out of the gate and moves; if it slowed down where the viewer can actually think about the plot and how the ""magic"" is performed, the movie would unravel in a heartbeat.

5521264,3,B00AW9M8N6,"This was a good movie ... fairly entertaining,  but not worthy of 5 stars ... maybe 3.5 at best.
The ending is certainly a surprise as it reveals the who and why behind the heists, albeit the viewer has already figured out that a past magician is somehow involved. However,  this reveal also makes some actions by one of the characters to seem overacted. One could argue these actions were part of the deception, which is true ... nonetheless,  their efforts are seemingly too much at times leaving the viewer wondering who  the mastermind was trying to deceive the most. Still, this is a decent movie ... worth the rental on a rainy day.",1393459200,,638,4.5701754385964914
5521265,5,B00AW9M8N6,"The basic premise is 4 magicians are brought together to fulfill a certain task.  The producers have brought together a great cast, the interactions between the actors is totally believable, and the ""Magic acts"" are incredible, yet possible.  They give you time to wonder ""how did they do that?""  And then  SHOW how they did that before you get too frustrated.  The pace is perfectly calculated to give the max impact to the story.  I will add no spoilers, but will probably watch this again and again.  The characters, the actors (no they are not the same!) the whole balance between what is, and what Could Be, This is my new favorite movie!  And by the way, they didn't have to cuss every other word, nobody had to get naked, and we still had a great roller coaster ride!",1393372800,3,774,4.517985611510792

5521270,4,B00AW9M8N6,"It's a good movie, so I am not going advocated avoiding it.  If you watch it, you will be entertained.  It just falls short.

One of this film's good qualities is its ability to keep you wondering how the heck X did Y.  Lots of tricks and twists to keep your attention.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of awe-inspiring, magical occurrences that are never explained and border heavily on the magic in Dungeons and Dragons, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings--take your pick.  (SPOILERS IN NEXT SENTENCE)  Like floating through the air in a bubble, jumping off a building and bursting into flame, etc.

Then there are some highly unrealistic scenes that in real life would require a team of engineers and roadies bigger than Metallica tours with.  (SPOILERS IN NEXT TWO SENTENCES)  Yet the FOUR Horsemen miraculously make a series of buildings transform into their multimedia circus without ANYONE being the wiser, for example.  And move around INCREDIBLY heavy safes with ease in minutes.  I cannot move a refrigerator without a handtruck and another person!  I know Franco and Harrelson are manly men, but come on.

Thirdly, and most frustrating, is the inclusion of the secret society of mages.  Ok, cool idea.  Love it!  It makes you wonder if this society holds the secret to ""real"" magic like the stuff we see in Harry Potter or if it is just an incredible arcane intelligentsia.  Or both.
Unfortunately, we never find out.  They just ARE.  You can argue it is a smokescreen.

Then we get a twist no one sees coming, but it means very little in the whole scheme of things.  The magicians go from being magical vigilantes (sort of) to pawns in a bigger plot that really could have been handled better with a Glock.  That's all I'll say.

The movie had great potential when the magicians bond together and start committing crimes for good.  They should have stuck with that premise.  We could have had some amazing sequels too.

The action is intense.  Franco is incredible in his fight and flight scenes.  All of the acting is superb.  Woody Harrelson's mentalism is enthralling.  The way the camerawork is used, you get a sense of how the different forms of magic are done.  So no info-dumps or boring explanations.  That was a creative way to present the characters.

You WILL be entertained, but ultimately disappointed that they did not build something bigger and more meaningful.",1393200000,4,2384,4.776412776412776

There is a lot of magic and slight of hand, but there is also a good story here. It keeps you guessing until your near the end. I liked how they also tied up a lot of loose ends, by explaining to us non magic people, how they did what they did. Pretty darn good movie!",1393200000,,381,3.7160493827160495

5521278,4,B00AW9M8N6,"Okay, right out of the gate, to say the plot is far-fetched, well, let's just say it takes a bit of slight (sic) of mind, but the writing is sharp and brisk, the actors are good, the illusions are large and flashy, and there are cheering crowds to egg all of the proceedings on.  All of this is served up at a lightning pace.  Woody Harrelson is especially engaging as a mentalist.  The plot keeps you guessing, and I won't reveal the big surprise at the end, but even the good guys may not be exactly what they seem.  Enjoyable fun ride, but with a slight sense that we've seen a similar ruse in one or two earlier films.  And yes, because of a few too many twists and turns, the through-line, if you will, is difficult to follow, especially the Morgan Freeman character, who plays the ultimate dupe.",1393027200,7,801,4.348993288590604

5521298,3,B00AW9M8N6,"I recently watched Now You Can See Me Movie it's a great movie, but it can be better if the director avoid the gaps that was between the scenes, the sloppy direction and unanswered questions and. However, the movie talking about magicians who have been gathered by an anonymous to do special  shows  that depend on stealing money from banks and giving  it to the audience, but the main goal of the anonymous person who gathered them  is to get revenge. While the FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) is trying to figure out their  tricks so he can find the evidence to catch these magicians, another ex-magician Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan freeman), who is making money by disclosed other magician's tricks was also trying to figure out their tricks.
  What makes this movie great is that it's full of surprising details so you can't predict what will happen  next or how these tricks were planned, and the biggest surprise is at the  end  of the movie. However, there are many details that the movie missed and the spectators need to know more about it.
  One of these mistakes is in the beginning when these magicians gathered by the anonymous are in an empty  apartment. After they enter it, laser lights show in front of them with a sign of their group name ""Four Horsemen"" and boom!! The director (Louis Leterrier) takes us one year later while these four Horsemen are doing a big show in Las Vegas. This a huge gap that the director missed, the spectators need to know what happened in that apartment, how did they end up doing big shows in Las Vegas?
  Another scenes that was poorly directed, and you can see that in the flipping car scene. In a car chase while the FBI agent was chasing one of the magicians by his car, the magician's car flipped over and over and end up upside down. The mistake that the director made which was obvious is that they did this scene over and over to get the car on the right position, which is upside down. Before showing us the last move of the car it was clear that he connected many scenes of the flipping car. One of them shows that the last move of the car was standing up right, then he connected to another scene of flipping car that show the  last move of the car in a upside down position. It was a really bad connection for one scene. And the list of the director's mistakes goes on and on.
  The most important point that I'm sure everyone who saw this movie will want to know, what is happening  behind all of these tricks and how they did it? Yes they told us about some of them but not all of them. It will not be that enjoyable without knowing every detail of this movie, and as Morgan Freeman said "" The need to know greater than the desire to be fooled"".
  Even though I said it is a good movie with an interesting story. At the same time, it was imposable to ignore some of the director mistakes from the unanswered question, the gaps between the scenes and the sloppy direction of some scenes. All of these small details that should be easy to edit. Overall I still recommend this movie due the interesting story that it had.

Storyline: Four street magicians (experts in their own tricks), come together through an invitation from an unknown person. The union emerges as The Four Horsemen. The first stage show and the subsequent ones of this new brand, specializes in giving huge performances, that target specific people from the audience to hypnotize them and later use them as pawns to steal huge money from vaults of big banks across the world.
FBI Agent Dylan Rhodes takes up investigation of this case, along with the gorgeous Interpol agent Alma Dray. They find out that The Four Horsemen gang is targeting only those people who were responsible for the death of a famous magician, Lionel Shirke, who was humiliated and died in an accident 30 years ago, after his tricks exposed by his counterpart, Thaddeus. The Four Horsemen loot the bank Credit Republicain de Paris and Tresslers insurance company that refused to settle the insurance of Lionel Shirkes  death. They, finally trick Thaddeus, to get him arrested.
The surprise comes in climax, when The Four Horsemen stage their final show in New York to steal a safe and transfer the money to Thaddeuss car, giving an impression to the police that Thaddeus is the  actual culprit behind the robberies. This is when The Four Horsemen get to see the fifth Horseman, in hiding all the while and that happens to be the FBI Agent Dylan himself. Dylan claims to have done all this to take revenge on all those who were responsible for the death of his father Lionel Shirke, but never ever to be found by the Police.

Positives: A wonderful twist at the end which surprises the audience. Magicians and many of their tricks revealed. A grave truth that modern magic is nowadays being used for huge financial gains rather than just providing entertainment to public, like once upon a time. The audience could never guess the secret of the fifth Horseman. Plot was well designed. Good screenplay and good music. Free flowing pure entertainment. Melanie Laurent and Morgan Freeman, are my favorites, in the movie.

Negatives: Gives a negative approach towards the FBI and Interpol which could be tricked so easily by some street magicians, while looting heavy amount from banks and insurance companies. The revelation of the fifth Horseman could have been a little more exciting.

5521328,5,B00AW9M8N6,From the opening act this movie boggles the mind. Audience (you the viewer) participation are warned that there will be sensory manipulation. Magic tricks will be exposed for what they are and their secrets will be protected. The Hocus is the Pocus and the CGI just augments the smoke and not the mirrors. A true magic show with mystery and the thrill of the chase.,1392076800,,365,4.630769230769231

I only give it 3 stars as I purchased the HD version of Now you see me and half way during the movie it dropped out of HD quality, with visible loss of picture quality. It paused, buffered and turned off the HD indicator. No one else was using the internet at the time in our home.

Keeps you guessing most of the movie, and the show within the show (the magic show) is pretty cool. Better that the average action schlock available these days.",1391040000,,243,4.674418604651163

Even if you are paying attention, you will probably miss some clues to how they pulled it all off, which is explained at the end.

I want you to follow, because no matter what you think you might know, we will always be one step, three steps- seven steps ahead of you, and just when you think you're catching up, that's when we'll be right behind you.

5521402,5,B00AW9M8N6,"I recall this movie being advertised when in theatrical release but I never got around to actually seeing it.  However, I did make a mental note to obtain the video or stream it when it became available on Amazon.  I think the themes of magic and crime drama sort of caught my attention.

Even with a plot line that is not really plausible, I really enjoyed this movie.  The acting was good and the story had me thinking about what was going on throughout the film.  The pacing and special effects were also good so that the running time of approximately two hours seemed to be a lot shorter.  I like to think that I am a fairly logical thinker and can usually figure out what's going to happen at the conclusion of movies.  However, the ending here proved surprising and interesting.

When it comes to movies, my wife and I rarely arrive at a consensus opinion about what we've watched.  In this case, however, we were in strong (and rare) agreement.  Heck, I've even watched the movie a couple of more times during which I found a couple of additional ""twists and turns"" I previously missed.

5521408,5,B00AW9M8N6,"Having seen the theatrical version, I realized this was a one of a kind movie. Interesting plot, great casting and a intelligent script sets this movie apart from others.

The extended version includes around 15 minutes of additional footage from the theatrical version, a small documentary regarding the history of magic, and some interviews with the cast.

Included is also an ITunes purchase code to download the movie free but this only works within the US.",1390262400,10,461,5.052631578947368
5521409,2,B00AW9M8N6,"The magic was cool, and the explanations were fun to follow.  But the biggest weakness in this film is that you truly don't care about any of the characters. None of the relationships are meaningful, and you never really understand why the ""dream team"" agrees to put their lives and freedom on the line for the invisible mastermind.",1390262400,,332,4.724137931034483

something to watch to make me sleepy... It worked. I was nodding out just as it finished.",1390176000,,130,4.608695652173913
5521412,5,B00AW9M8N6,"This movie is totally implausible, but for some reason I just really enjoyed the mix of characters and the stunts they pulled. Somewhere along the line, you figure out that there's a back story to all of their tricks, but it's not a ""smack you in the face"" discovery. I thought the four horsemen had an interesting and engaging chemistry and Mark Ruffalo and Morgan Freeman were just plain fun to watch as they interacted. Even the French investigator was very likeable.

This is not a great work of film literature but it is just a lot of fun to watch.",1390176000,,553,4.475247524752476

It's got what many movies try to accomplish, a good story and a great cast of characters Mark Ruffalo,Jesse Eisenberg ,Woody Harrelson, Michael Caine & Margan Freeman.

5521416,5,B00AW9M8N6,Not sure why I thought that...The word magic show to me holds some disturbing connotations I guess...But this too is a sleeper.  I was highly impressed with the skill involved and though the Characters are not so edged out they really don't need to be.  If you like Magic or spectacular illusions then this film is for you.  You have to love computers by now and CG...It's in everything...I'm still waiting when CG characters become so real we won't know if they are or not....Just think of the picket lines actors will be forming when that happens...Oh well....,1390089600,,562,4.714285714285714
5521417,4,B00AW9M8N6,"This is a great movie to watch for an evening of fun with some friends or loved ones. It's lighthearted, popcorn-munching entertainment that won't challenge you too greatly, but what it does do exceptionally well is something that many modern films have ignored as they have become increasingly bloated with run time and special effects - PACING! The pacing of this movie is superb. It skips along so quickly, you don't even realize the movie has run its course until the climax is about to occur. It's fast paced and engaging, entertaining you the whole while. The story serves its purpose admirably (though you must very much be willing to suspend your disbelief), the characters are likable, the magic tricks are fun, and there is nothing risque for the parents to object to, if they want to watch this with their kids (there is some violence, but hardly anything of a graphic nature).",1390089600,,888,4.810457516339869

""Now You See Me"" is added to my list of go-to's"". It is a fun, engaging, lightweight, film that has the added bonus of having virtually no swearing and no gratuitous sex.  If you care to figure the twist you can, but it is sufficiently obscure so that if you sit back and relax you will be surprised at the end.  The performances are fine.  Some of the characters are well-written and interesting, the Interpol agent being foremost in this category. There is more to the movie than you realize when you first watch it.  It can stand many viewings even though after the first one you know the twist.  Rent and enjoy.",1389830400,,764,4.345070422535211

The production value had a very glamorous quality to it that was very visually appealing.

Word of note, if you're a fan of Jesse Eisenerg, Morgan Freeman or Woody Harrelson, even though they receive top billing they actually aren't in the movie nearly as much as Mark Ruffalo.

5521434,2,B00AW9M8N6,This movie looked like it had all the elements to be a good movie but for some reason it was just so ridiculous I couldn't take it seriously. Sometimes things come together to make a movie and sometimes they don't. I can't put my finger on it but I just didn't enjoy it. Just my opinion.,1389744000,,287,4.142857142857143

There are some plot twists at the end, I suppose to try and surprise the viewer, but they felt a little contrived to me. But that's easy enough to overlook as you enjoy an otherwise entertaining story with decent effects and some very original scenes to counter the forced plot twists.",1389744000,,438,4.353658536585366

The twist is a bit of a been there done that kind of element that one can see, but will talk themselves out of because, well, been there done that. Problems lean towards grounding the preposterous gimmicks and lack of chemistry within the cast, but these are practically negated by pacing and editing. The film tries to bring into question your leanings towards who the good and bad guys are and achieves the mind bend through trickery. The viewer has the wrong information about protagonists, antagonists and motivation when the fikm first engages your sensibilities on the matter. Later the motivations evolve to be something not even near what the film started out being about and your POV on the matter is altered.",1389571200,,793,4.795620437956204

The first is an extended version.  Watch it.  I like the extended better than the theatrical version.  The second is the commentaries.  Those were just wonderful - lots of interesting tidbits about the making of the film, the characters, the actors, the production.  Some really neat stories.

Even bad ones I tend to like a little, but once in a while, a movie is so awful, I sit there and can't believe how I'm just wasting hours of my life.  Watching this movie was one of those times.
The plot holes were gaping, the premises were ridiculous, and so many scenes ended w/ me thinking ""wtf??""
There are many examples, but I will give one (without any spoilers, even though there's no way to spoil this flick any further)....
A cop shoots at an unarmed person running in an extremely crowded area.  He misses and just stops.  Nobody in the crowd freaks out at the gunshot, not even those right next to him; they just keep on partying.  Then he kisses a girl.  Ridiculous.
There are many others, but there would be spoilers that I'm not going to give out, in case you want to watch this just for comedic value.

We were both surprised by how good the movie really was...the description given didn't make it sound so great at all, if anything made it seem boring..but found ourselves not taking our eyes off the TV screen. It was one of those movies that ur sucked into & find urself unable to stop/pause, even for a bathroom break. It went extremely fast, so to me that shows had our interest & wasn't dragged out like a lot of other movies had been out for awhile. I would definitely reccommend to watch this movie & is DEFIFNITELY one of those movies ur surprised by at every turn...great ending as well..overall only gave 4 stars because I'm a tough critic & can not say was the greatest movie I've ever seen but it definitely ranked up there w/the really good ones I'd reccommend to family & friends & afterwards, we certainly didn't feel we wasted time watching it..

I don't blame the actors, in fact I'll bet the needed scenes were shot, but had to be cut to save time.

5521542,1,B00AW9M8N6,"SPOILERS BELOW

I don't understand why this movie is not called a Science Fiction . There are certain acts in the movie that are portrayed as magic and they expect the audience to believe in them but it just don't make sense -  (Act one) how could they rob the bank money and no one knew about it? (Act 2) They stole the money form that guy (forgot his name) and gave it to the audience, and I believe they did it based on the conversation they had in the plane, but this was so obvious for us (the viewers), so where is the magic in it? (Third Act)- The three magicians just ran away even though there were cops everywhere, and then I don't understand why the guy that was supposed to be dead went on to open the safe, any one of the remaining three could have done it. I guess the magic in this film is the senseless unrealistic acts that I as a viewer should digest because its magic. They could have easily shown that the four magicians didn't exist, it was just an illusion, and why ? Because its Magic :)

I could have easily enjoyed this movie if I would have had left my brains behind.",1388620800,2,1093,4.14622641509434

5521545,4,B00AW9M8N6,"Would recommend renting rather than buying - not a movie you'd want to watch over and over as it is about 'magic tricks' and while it's one thing to see a trick performed live and leave the show wondering 'how'd they do that' it is quite another having them explained all the way thru.  You may want to watch a second time to say 'yep, they're right' but the mystery is gone and the characters don't evolve much thru the arcs to see different sides to the story.",1388620800,,462,4.25

If you haven't seen this and even halfway like some of the cast, you'll love it!  From previous movies I actually enjoy every single primary actor in this, top shelf actors doing their thing with a great script... presto chango = movie magic baby!  This is relatively family friendly too so I'd say if your kids are over like 6 or 7 it's probably okay and in fact they'll actually love the magic in it.

5521562,2,B00AW9M8N6,"I adore sleight of hand and stage magic, so I was excited to see a movie about it in a contemporary setting.  This was really lackluster.  The characters were very one dimensional and the ""magic"" was often painfully CGI'd, which was not the premise the movie was working off of.  The plot was weak and they missed a lot of opportunities to flesh out the different magician's actual skills.

The only reason I rated it as highly as I did is because I though Mark Ruffalo and Jesse Eisenberg were both solid in this and because, despite a weak premise, often grasping at continuity, the ending was actually surprising.",1388448000,2,616,4.623853211009174

I recommend it to all my favorite people and even knowing the outcome I've watched it more than twice.  Oh, I'm sorry, those who think there has to be buckets of blood and forty minutes of chase scenes probably will be bored but for those who like a good suspense movie well done, this is it.  No murder no mayhem just darn good story telling.",1388448000,,445,4.325301204819277

5521566,3,B00AW9M8N6,Very enjoyable story and did the job of entertainment which is my base expectation for any movie.  It would have been 4 stars but the end  just collapsed with a weak finish.  Still worth watching.,1388448000,,196,4.542857142857143

Just sit back, relax and let the movie work its magic on you. I knew I was going to enjoy it as soon as the opening sequence magic card trick worked on me, to my utter delight! There are twists and turns, reveals and unmaskings. Just when you think you know the secret, it all changes yet again.",1388275200,,479,4.161290322580645

5521585,1,B00AW9M8N6,"don't watch this movie! what a huuuuuge waste of time. no real plot. the twist at the end wasn't even a good twist. i watched the whole thing hoping that they would turn it around. the idea of illusion and the detail in which they 'tricked' people was pretty interesting and smart, however, what a waste of a movie. here are all the reasons you shouldn't watch this movie:
- bad acting by all except for maybe woody harrelson
- the plot was convoluted, filled with nonsense and did not follow any story format. it's as if all these scenes were stitched together by a complete stranger
- the twist at the end - huh? why? who cares! it wasn't even stitched together or explained properly at the end
- the chemistry between all characters - none. had they not done a test screen to test the chemistry?
- the french interpol agent - again, why? who cares! unnecessary!

The story line is actually very original but I felt that there were some serious stretches made... a few holes in the conclusion that kept it from scoring higher. Still was quite entertaining for most of the movie.",1388188800,,268,4.604166666666667
5521588,1,B00AW9M8N6,Very boring!!!!  Within 10 minutes I turned this off!  My husband watched it later since we had to pay for it and he said it never got any better.  Not worth the time or money.,1388188800,,176,3.9714285714285715

5521597,4,B00AW9M8N6,"This was a movie with a great premise, very good acting and strong characters but tried to be entirely too clever.  The movie should have ended 30 minutes sooner and they should have just wrapped up the plot rather than dragging it on and on.  The magic scenes were extremely entertaining and the cast playing the four young magicians were outstanding.  They really made this movie shine despite the lackluster plot.  Recommended to watch with friends/family, but not deserving of any major accolades.",1388102400,,501,5.0

The good guys and bad guys are not quite who they seem.  It was fun to watch, and I enjoyed the story and the effects.

5521627,4,B00AW9M8N6,"This is a fun thriller. Four magicians team up to create a spectacular magic show, the highlights of which are some original heists. As they do so they play a cat and mouse game with the authorities and with an  ex-magician who is dedicated to exposing magicians and their scams.

As thrillers go it's not a very deep one, but it does have a few interesting twists along the way. What does stand out are the magic shows, they are a fantastic spectacle and the four magicians all contribute something different to the show. There's sleight of hand, mesmerism, escapology and illusions and the actors all do a decent job with their roles.

I can see that some people might not be a fan of the ending,personally I liked it, it's nice to think that there's a bit of mystery to it. All in all it's a flashy and entertaining watch.",1387584000,,825,4.450331125827814

Ditto for Morgan Freeman, but his talent was wasted in this film. The rest of the cast just didn't hold my attention nor elicit any warm & fuzzy feelings because of the heavy and overwhelming use of the special effects. The plot was interesting but derivative.

They do reveal tricks along the way that makes you go ""oh how could I not have known that?"". which makes it interesting at all times.  The acting is good and again, a very action packed movie.

This storyline of this movie invites four talented magicians to participate in a scheme that if they manage to pull it off, will enable the magicians to find the answers to a legendary question that only a few elite magician will ever become privy to. It takes a year to hone and develop everything to be able to pull off the scheme they have been invited to participate in. The first part of the scheme takes place as a magic show set in Las Vegas where the magicians manage to pull off a bank robbery in Paris while they are still in Las Vegas. This trick gets the FBI investigating the group of magicians called ""the four horsemen"". Morgan Freeman's character is also investigating the ""four horsemen"" and lets the FBI know that the trick they pulled off at the Las Vegas show is just the beginning and a mere distraction for what their true intent is.
The next magic show trick is set in New Orleans. The ""four horsemen"" manage to rob their backer who is the insurer responsible for letting many in New Orleans down after Katrina. Michael Caine's character the backer then hires Morgan Freeman's character to investigate and to catch the ""four horsemen"".
The ""four horsemen"" manage a couple of other tricks with the FBI in hot pursuit. The end of the movie reveals who really set up the whole plot to begin with. This movie has lots of twists and turns that you won't necessarily see coming. It is well written and filmed. I enjoyed this film so much that I wanted to add it to my Blu-ray collection.

It is sad to see such a strong and talented cast wasted in this mediocrity. You watch this hoping that the narrative improves but alas, it just gets worse and increasingly implausible. To add insult to injury, the ending is truly ridiculous. The worse offense a writer and/or director can make is to conclude the story/movie with a very unsatisfactory ending as you have wasted the audience's time.

In an attempt to disguise the rather thin plot, the writer attempts to distract by filling the movie with current populist themes - screw the rich, spread their ""ill-gotten"" wealth, corporations are evil themes. The usual simplistic diatribe that has perpetuated ad nauseam by the media since 2008 as these themes generate viewership and ratings.

5521696,1,B00AW9M8N6,"(SPOILERS)

This movie is a religious-fest disguised as a psychological thriller.  As far as I can tell, the only reason it has gotten rave reviews is because of how much it bashes non-believers and masturbates the egos of believers.  The entire movie - amid horrible dialogue and plot holes - is spent hammering in the idea that magic is important and that it's OK to lie to people about it, as long as the lie makes them feel good.

By the end of the movie, Morgan Freeman winds up in prison, framed by the movie's heroes (the magicians) for the crimes that they committed.  I am not exaggerating when I say that Morgan Freeman does nothing illegal or even unethical for the entire movie.  He shows the public how the main characters' magic acts are done, so people know that it is not real magic; for that alone, we are apparently expected to sympathize with his being framed.  After all...how dare someone replace hope and awe with truth.  Truth has no value, and is apparently an evil in this movie.

As far as plot holes, they are ""filled up"" with such unbelievably mashed together junk, that I laughed out loud more than once.  For example, we see a main magician die in a car accident.  He clearly flips in his car, and the car explodes.  Of course, by this point in the movie, I know he couldn't possibly be dead, so it's not even surprising when you find out that he isn't...but I never would have guessed how stupidly this would be explained.  The movie takes us back in time to show how another magician (who somehow knew that the car chase would be at a specific part of a bridge during a specific time in the chase) happens to be driving a city bus, which apparently nobody noticed drove to the bridge equipped with a vehicle on the front exactly like the one the other magician is driving.  So we're supposed to believe that the vehicles were switched, and the one on the bus is the one that really crashed.  But what about the body?  The movie then takes us even further back in time, to show that a cadaver was stolen from a mortuary for this feat.

By the end of the movie, the main magicians have committed grand larceny, hijacked a city bus, and stolen and destroyed the cadaver of some random family.  Yet we are STILL expected to cheer for them and jeer at Morgan Freeman, because the magicians did all of this to give some people hope, and Freeman let everyone know what a sham they were.",1385942400,12,2411,4.416289592760181

The story itself was both tried and true (modern Robin Hoods and secret societies) as well as being fresh (magicians).

Sort of a modern-day version of Charade (much better than the ACTUAL modern-day remake, The Truth About Charlie), Now You See Me is a phenomenally entertaining piece of prestidigitation about four street magicians - Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Dave Franco, Isla Fischer - who form an act called The Four Horsemen, whose claim to fame is that they have the ability to rob banks without leaving the arena where they're performing. Like the Stanely Donen classic, Now You See Me is built on a series of plot twists and character turns in which no one or nothing is quite what it appears to be.

The always engaging Mark Ruffalo is the skeptical FBI agent trying to catch the criminals in the act, while old pros Michael Cane and Morgan Freeman have the time of their professional lives as a veteran magician and a veteran magician debunker, respectively. Their scenes together are alone worth the price of admission. And Ruffalo is perfection as the slightly disheveled and perpetually outmaneuvered law enforcer who finds himself up against a quartet of antagonists who always manage to be a good half-dozen or so steps ahead of him.

Its hard to overstate just how much fun this movie turns out to be, with well-earned kudos going to Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin and Edward Ricourt for their infinitely imaginative screenplay, Louis Leterrier for his turbocharged direction, and all the technical wizards whove engaged in a little legerdemain of their own by making the magic scenes so seamless and convincing.

And if it all doesnt seem entirely plausible in the end, and you walk away with the nagging suspicion that the writers must have cheated in some way - well, that IS the power of magic, after all.

5521718,5,B00AW9M8N6,"I almost never watched Now You See Me, because I generally don't like Woody Harrelson (not the actor, but the way he portrays almost all the characters I've seen).

That would have been a shame, though, because he's good in this movie. The sarcastic, sneering know-it-all character he often plays is a perfect match for the cynical magician he plays. Each of the other main characters is also well matched with an actor who seems made to play the part: Michael Caine as a moneyed investor, Morgan Freeman as a skeptical revealer of magician's tricks, Mark Ruffalo as two-steps-behind FBI agent trying to catch the magician/thieves.

You begin with a group of four magicians brought together in a mysterious cabal, directed by an unknown party, and watch as they perform astounding -- tricks? feats of magic? All the while, your suspicions shift wildly; who is the mysterious unknown behind the act? Is it Freeman? Another agent at the Bureau? The dead magician whose tricks are referred to several times in the movie?

The mystery is profound, and the magic act is stupendous. The final twist will have you going back to the beginning to replay the movie with that foreknowledge. And that's why I bought the DVD; so I can watch it again and again. Because unlike many a mystery or thriller, this one satisfies even when repeated. Outstanding.",1385683200,,1342,4.851528384279476

5521720,5,B00AW9M8N6,"A decent movie, entertaining and moves well. But you certainly have to suspend your belief to imagine these magicians being about to accomplish all this.

I've been getting tired of all of the ex special forces guy down on his luck and the wrong people messed with him stuff and the super heroes and the coming of age blah blah blah and so on. I haven't seen anything quite like this one, but maybe I live a sheltered life. It's best to see this knowing nothing. I've seen some negative reviews that seemed kind of conceited as it's just a movie. I can't think of any I've seen lately without plot holes or a need to suspend your disbelief to some degree or other.  Just see with the expectation of having fun.

They tried for the suspense and twist ending, but I just didn't care enough about any of the characters to be in suspense or surprised at the ending. It's one of those movies that seems like it should be good on paper, if you knew about the twist, but it just doesn't connect with the viewers in a way to make it good.",1385424000,,392,4.103896103896104

5521748,4,B00AW9M8N6,"The idea for this movie is pretty original, a quartet of magicians pulling off heists while being on stage on front of an audience. At least I found this premise interesting enough to make me sit down to watch it. Luckily, the execution is very good too, so I ended up appreciating the experience.

I think that those people that liked movies such as Ocean's Eleven will have a good time with this one. The planning and execution in Now You See Me did give me a sense of deja vu based on that movie. The whole environment dealing with magic provided an interesting setting, and I think the pacing of the action and dialogue was just right.

To make matters better, the conclusion of the film is top notch. I am not going to say that everything lines up 100% or that we get all the answers, but they came close enough. If you enjoy movies like Ocean's Eleven or The Italian Job, you cannot go wrong with this one.",1385164800,,912,4.3274853801169595

As a fan of The Illusionist and The Prestige, and movies of that nature, it's safe to say that I love movies about magicians and illusions because I want to see if I can figure out how they pulled the trick off. This movie was an epic fail for me on so many levels, for starters, it was waaay longer than it had to be. The idea and the premise was actually good, and I loved the actors in this movie, and their illusions were visually stunning. However, I agree that some of these stunts were just unrealistic and unbelievable. Even the best magicians in the world couldn't pull of what they pulled off. On top of that, the ending dropped the ball for me. I guess I couldn't see what the hell they were doing? I get that it wasn't about they money, but there had to be something more than what we saw. I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen the movie yet, but that ending. The ending was very anticlimactic for me, and I felt like I had been robbed out of the last 2 hours and 5 minutes of my precious time. It was all for nothing!

The protagonists are arrogant and unlikable.  The sound track is very noisy.  The stunts, of which there are many, are ridiculous and unbelievable.  There are a couple of plot twists that are mildly interesting.

I like magic (see Penn and Teller Fool Us on Youtube for great tricks in front of a live audience) but this movie left me cold.

5521766,2,B00AW9M8N6,"I purchased this movie because I am interested in stage magic, and the fact that the movie provided a bit of insight into how stage magic is done is the only thing that saved it from a one-star rating.  The movie's vague message is something of an ""Occupy Wall Street meets Houdini"" sort of thing, in which a fuzzy anti-corporate theme is fused with a confusing and often contradictory theme  about the joys of magic, as well as a sub-plot concerning the existence of an ancient magical group known as The Eye.  But, apart from the ecstasy of throngs of people seeing money rain down on their heads, there is little sense of joy in this movie.  It all seems a bit forced, like the wild enthusiasm of the hired fans thronging the stage at a Super Bowl halftime show.  The movie straddles the border between realism and fantasy, and works as neither.

The four youthful magicians, brought together for some vague purpose they don't entirely understand, are thoroughly unlikeable people, very different from most real magicians I have encountered.  They are smug, arrogant, and vulgar.  They use their magic in a Robin Hood sort of way, to rob banks and corporate strongholds, and then shower the booty onto their adoring fans.  In the process, they even rob from their erstwhile corporate sponsor, represented by Michael Caine, who then turns on them.  Because their crimes are international in scope, they attract the attention of both the FBI and Interpol.  The interplay between the American FBI agent and his (female) French Interpol counterpart creates few sparks, and I could not develop much of an interest in either of them.

Morgan Freeman is cast as a former magician turned debunker, and by the end of the film he meets his match in a surprising way, but by then I really didn't care what happened - I kept glancing at my watch, counting down the movie's 115 minutes.  It was never quite clear what Freeman's purpose was, who he was working for, or whether he switched sides at some point - it was just plain confusing.

I wouldn't watch this movie again.  Why watch a movie filled with people you don't like?",1384819200,,2118,4.70189701897019

The plots are complicated and unrealistic, especially when the team planned an accident on a bridge with heavy traffic and had enough time to make a switch of a speedy car. Com' on... The end gets even sillier when the detective who aggressively wants to nail the team turns out to be ""you know who""... It's corny and disapointing.

Especially Jesse Eisenberg, his character had zero likeability, possibly by design as he was playing the most egoist among slightly lesser egoists, but still... I also didn't want to root for Freeman's smug character leaving Ruffalo as the only person you wanted to see come out on top, but... won't go on for fear of spoilers.

5521814,3,B00AW9M8N6,"""Now You See Me"" had an Oceans 11 vibe throughout.  Four well known magicians come together to pull off an elaborate plot to steal money from the rich and give to, well, whomever can make it out to their shows.  Their reasoning? Just to show they can and so that they can join a super exclusive magic club called The Eye.  While the plot was a bit unbelievable and groan worthy at times the performances turned in by the cast were very good and their dynamic created a lot of funny moments throughout.  The special effects used in the film for the magic were also very cool and kept me engaged.  As twisty and turny as the plot was in the movie, you could probably guess what the twist is going to be at the end of the movie.  There aren't a lot of obvious clues pointing to the twist but if you've seen one of these movies you've seen 'em all and thus you probably won't end up too surprised.

I give this movie 3/5.  It's a fun rental but ultimately a movie that you won't remember in another year or two.",1384387200,,1007,4.181347150259067

5521852,4,B00AW9M8N6,"This movie has an original premise, a glossy attractive presentation, and a strong cast- which draws you in. In particular, the clever publicity trailer draws you in!

It's a good movie to buy on DVD, as a second viewing helps you to unravel the plot twists- mostly, they're logical, but sometimes dealt with obscurely. I see that they have released an extended version on DVD,which is 9 minutes longer- I haven't seen that version, but I suggest you buy that, as the cinema release version shows evidence of cutting which I suspect inhibited the plot exposition.

The story is about magicians, greed, retribution and moral justice. To some extent, I thought the movie's style and gloss triumphed over the substance.

The cast try hard, with a script which starts out well, and has some ingenious twists, but which had an ending denouement which I thought could have been stronger and more convincing.

Nonetheless, the end of the film implies that there will be a sequel. Indeed, I understand that planning for a sequel has commenced.

Is it a great movie? No. Did I enjoy it? Yes, and I enjoyed the good- and sometimes clever- parts enough to outweigh the weaker and less convincing elements. The characters and storyline have an appeal which draws you in.

5521869,4,B00AW9M8N6,"The movie was put together well, however it doesn't leave much for replay value. Great flick for the guy with the know it all complex.",1383696000,,134,4.4
5521870,3,B00AW9M8N6,"I enjoyed watching this, but it's probably not one that bears repeating.  Most of the character ""development"" occurs early in the movie and after that we are just along for the ride, fun though it is.",1383696000,,200,4.555555555555555
5521871,4,B00AW9M8N6,"Now you see me is just a fun movie.  The twists and turns aren't all that unexpected, but still bold enough to keep you guessing a little.  The pacing is great and I'm glad I rented it.  Characters never really get a chance to fully develop and engage the audience, but for this movie it works.  You don't need to be emotionally tied to them to enjoy what they do and what happens to them.",1383696000,,389,4.1466666666666665
5521872,5,B00AW9M8N6,A fun movie that will keep you guessing  until the end. It's just as good to watch the second time around.,1383696000,,106,4.0476190476190474

5521877,4,B00AW9M8N6,This was one of the best movie plots I had seen in a long time. It made you want to watch every minute to see what was going on.,1383696000,,128,3.4482758620689653
5521878,5,B00AW9M8N6,"Implausible? Sure. So what? I F'n loved it. Should've purchased instead of rented. Acting + storyline + visuals all on point. Most entertaining flick of the year, for me. See this.",1383696000,,180,4.838709677419355
5521879,5,B00AW9M8N6,It'll keep you guessing the whole time! Fun movie with a great cast. It's a new and different type of magic.,1383609600,,108,4.190476190476191
5521880,5,B00AW9M8N6,We enjoyed it very much.  The magic tricks (special effects) were awesome.  We don't even remember it being advertised when it was released.,1383609600,,140,5.043478260869565
5521881,1,B00AW9M8N6,This movie was difficult to watch... Because it was so bad... I'm not sure where all these good reviews come from.,1383523200,,114,4.476190476190476
5521882,5,B00AW9M8N6,"I had been wanting to see this movie since it was released in theaters but never made it. One night my friend and I were having movie night and I suggested Now You See Me. She had seen it before but said she would definitely see it again. I enjoyed watching the story develop and was completely thrown off at the end. It left me speechless and wondering what just happened. So, I bought it to watch it again! One heck of a good movie.",1383523200,,434,4.117647058823529
5521883,3,B00AW9M8N6,The movie had my attention right off the bat but then dragged out a little and it became kinda boring. It wasn't the worst movie I ever saw but just ok. YMMV,1383523200,2,157,3.9375
5521884,5,B00AW9M8N6,"I gave this 5 stars as, while it's not exactly ""Gone With the Wind"" it was not ""Mission Impossible 9"" either.  The ""hook"" or big idea of the movie is engaging and reasonably original.  Morgan Freeman actually plays a character who is not just Morgan Freeman.  These days it is great to be able to watch a movie and say ""that was fun"" instead of ""Oh, man, that was sure a waste of time"".",1383523200,,386,4.1891891891891895
5521885,4,B00AW9M8N6,I like thrillers and non conventional stories... but then we thought it was too complicated for no reason. Still a good choice.,1383523200,,127,4.818181818181818
5521886,3,B00AW9M8N6,Interesting; cool effects; a little confusing at times; camera work was sometimes obnoxious as it moved around elliptically -- kind of quickly.,1383523200,,143,5.545454545454546
5521887,5,B00AW9M8N6,Recommended by friends but I was skeptical.  Sincerely loved the movie.  The ending was a surprise that I did not see coming.  The cast was brilliant!,1383523200,,150,4.6923076923076925
5521888,4,B00AW9M8N6,"Good movie with great plot twists.  The character development is a little bit weak, but overall the movie kept my attention.",1383523200,,124,4.904761904761905
5521889,3,B00AW9M8N6,I was excited to see it.  People told me how good it was.  It was just okay and in the end was just to unbelievable to really enjoy,1383523200,,131,3.642857142857143
5521890,3,B00AW9M8N6,"The move was good, but the end was a bit of a let down. There could have been a lot more depth.",1383523200,,95,3.3636363636363638
5521891,5,B00AW9M8N6,"Creative and inventive plot.  Watched with family and all of us were pulled in trying to figure out the how, why and what next?",1383523200,,127,4.291666666666667
5521892,4,B00AW9M8N6,It was clever and kept my attention. I liked the layers of mystery. The End was a surprise.  A definite watch.,1383523200,,110,4.238095238095238
5521893,5,B00AW9M8N6,This was lots of fun to watch.  Big name actors and entertaining special effects wrapped up in a keep 'em guessing who-done-it.,1383523200,,127,4.7727272727272725
5521894,4,B00AW9M8N6,A clever movie that moves fast. I found the end came up a little short of perfection but well worth your time.,1383523200,,110,4.045454545454546
5521895,4,B00AW9M8N6,This was a good movie and entertaining.  The concept was something I had not really seen before and that made it enjoyable.  The acting was A list.,1383523200,,147,4.407407407407407
5521896,2,B00AW9M8N6,"Had high hopes for this movie but it is just flat, no real excitement. Can't hold a candle to the Oceans movies!",1383523200,,112,4.136363636363637
5521897,3,B00AW9M8N6,"Entertaining movie, better than expected. Woody did a better than normal job with his character in this movie. The story kept me guessing, always surprised what happened next. Enjoyed watching this with my parents.",1383436800,,214,5.323529411764706

5521899,2,B00AW9M8N6,"I went into this film with little expectations. The trailer looked great, but it ended up being so full of itself. All style and no substance. The premise and cast are amazing, but it just comes through contrived.

The twist at the end was the only redeeming point.",1383436800,,265,4.520833333333333
5521900,5,B00AW9M8N6,"Best movie I have seen in a long time! Now You See Me has all the makings of a ""sit on the edge of your seat"" till the next scene",1383436800,,129,3.3333333333333335
5521901,5,B00AW9M8N6,First let me tell you that I prefer chick flicks. This wasn't one. It had more than enough action for me. I thought the acting was great with terrific actors. The movie held my attention the whole time. It felt like I had just sat down to start the movie. The conclusion pulled everything together. I had to watch it again to make sure I didn't miss anything and it went just as fast and was just as good the second time around.,1383436800,,428,4.168674698795181
5521902,5,B00AW9M8N6,Lots of fast paced fun. Engaging plot and characters. Kept us guessing. Good special effects. Intellectually and visually stimulating. Good to know there is a sequel planned.,1383436800,,174,5.481481481481482
5521903,5,B00AW9M8N6,"Fun, fast-moving, engaging characters, novel twists, and a most unexpected ending. One of those movies that when it is done, you want to watch it again to see how they embedded clues along the way that you didn't quite get at the time. A great time and it doesn't hurt your head!",1383436800,,279,4.384615384615385
5521904,5,B00AW9M8N6,This Was An Excellent Movie..With Unexpected Twists. It Was Fun To Watch. It Had A Great Premise. Actually One Of The Best Movies I've Seen.,1383436800,,140,4.64
5521905,4,B00AW9M8N6,"Great movie if you are trying to spend a relaxed evening with your family. The story is really great, the magic tricks are awesome, and you will not expect the end, believe me ...",1383436800,,179,4.294117647058823
5521906,5,B00AW9M8N6,"Great item, fast shipping!  Some people panned this movie, but it is fantastic.  It is the new age of con movies (I.e. The sting) and this one did a great job ushering it in.",1383350400,,174,4.088235294117647
5521907,5,B00AW9M8N6,"This was an amazing movie!  It seems like I should be able to give it more stars! I've been reading the reviews online and it seems to be getting a bad rap, but those people seem to be missing the point of movie magic in general. It really is a great story, a combination of Oceans 11 and Robin Hood. I would recommend it to anybody!",1383350400,,333,4.045454545454546
5521908,3,B00AW9M8N6,"Overall the movie was pretty much entertaining, but wasn't very impressed by it. I felt it was a bit rushed and could have used a little more explanation at far as how the 4 magicians got involved into the plot. The development of the final plot was great and pretty much my favorite part. The end was surprising but yet, I think some of the details could have been revealed earlier to create a more suspenful effect. Big fun of the crew!",1383350400,,438,4.353658536585366
5521909,1,B00AW9M8N6,"You don't have to get very far into this movie before its suckiness is apparent. I would say that once the building is lit with the suit of the card the woman picks you start to get suspicious. After Woody Harrelson is able to magically extract 250 bucks from two tourists you're able to see that the trick would be if you were able to watch any more of the movie.
Implausible, corny, terrible direction, poor camera work, crappy acting--- pick one, any one.",1383350400,2,458,4.464285714285714

5521914,4,B00AW9M8N6,Never seen the previews or the trailer. I heard from a friend that it was good. One day I was just looking through Amazon's Prime movies and decided to rent it to see what it was all about. Great movie.,1383264000,,202,4.075
5521915,1,B00AW9M8N6,never was able to watch it. the amazon acct timed out a few times during the movie which didn't allow me to see it on time.. and for $5 i expected more,1383264000,,151,3.75

5521917,4,B00AW9M8N6,I'd watch anything with Morgan Freeman in it. Although the end became predictable and a bit schmaltzy it was good entertainment.,1383264000,,128,5.142857142857143
5521918,2,B00AW9M8N6,Great idea that was produced by elementary school film students.  I understand 'suspension of disbelief' but one would have to be an idiot to accept this story and outcome. May it disappear...please.,1383264000,,199,5.21875
5521919,5,B00AW9M8N6,"A surprise a minute. And (mostly) believable. Good combination of a thriller that makes you think, clever plot twists, fantastic casting, fun effects. Hope this group (cast & director & crew) can get together for another ""adventure"".",1383264000,,233,5.324324324324325
5521920,4,B00AW9M8N6,Good movie never expected the ending . Good movie for kids not as violent and nudity that is in most now a days.,1383264000,,112,3.9130434782608696

5521922,5,B00AW9M8N6,"I know, film purists will say there are holes in the structure, but we enjoyed watching this film. It wasn't a high tech thriller that we expected. It was better. This is magic put to great use. Original, fun, full of suspense, and a good night at the movies without leaving home.",1383177600,,280,4.403846153846154
5521923,5,B00AW9M8N6,One movie that my husband and I agreed upon.  We watched it together on our plane to Hawaii.  Very entertaining with a surprise twist at the end.,1383177600,,145,4.333333333333333
5521924,3,B00AW9M8N6,I guess I was expecting something totally different.  A movie about magic I was expecting some more realistic magic scenes.  Most of everything they do is so unbelievable that it pretty much seems make believe.  But in the movies defense it is a movie.,1383177600,,252,4.681818181818182
5521925,5,B00AW9M8N6,"Normally only allow my 9 year old daughter view G or PG movies.  But this was an exception!  Our family of five raved and discussed this movie for days afterwards.  It is clever, humorous and action packed with twists and turns. Think Oceans 11 with cell phones.

The one awkward adult part is in the beginning of the movie where a magician and a newly admiring fan do a little ro sham bo in his apartment. They were interrupted by a mysterious happening and she picks up her strewn clothing and leaves in a huff.

I don't remember any bad language - but Im unfortunately desensitized anything but the F-bomb.",1383177600,,609,4.5

5521930,4,B00AW9M8N6,"Very entertaining movie with some interesting plot twists. ""The Four Horsemen"" are gonna entertain you but don't believe your eyes or in this case ""the eye"" (explained in the movie).

5521931,4,B00AW9M8N6,"I really enjoyed the movie.  I was immediately drawn into the story - and the story was good.  The twists and turns were really good and plausiable.  It is a movie you need to watch at least twice.  What I liked about it, is none of the clues were hidden - if I was really paying attention, I would have figured it out.

And that is just the story - the acting was amazing.  The cast is top notch.  And it was visually cool!

This is a movie that I could recommend to any one - no violence, swearing, nudity, etc.  It is definitely worth watching.",1383091200,,547,4.084905660377358

I refuse to give anything away, so I won't say too much! Michael Caine, Woody Harrelson and Morgan Freeman were wonderful, but it was Eisenberg and Ruffalo who stole the show. This movie was aptly ""Magic"". I do not believe that you can watch this movie and be disappointed!  Enjoy!",1383091200,,452,4.380952380952381

Also has a surprise ending twist. This is Hollywood like it use to be, back when they had people with imagination and creativity. People are not allowed to think on their own anymore and these talents suffer greatly for that.",1383004800,,398,4.25

5521955,5,B00AW9M8N6,"This is a fascinating movie about four world-class magicians recruited to aid an unknown person on an unknown quest. They pull off some magic that would be mind-blowing if seen live (it's a lot easier with camera angles and special effects). But the interesting part of the story is the ease with which they always stay one step ahead of those pursuing them, the lingering mystery over the true purpose of their magic shows (even they don't know the TRUE purpose) and who their real benefactor is. All is revealed in the surprise ending and it's a good one. The acting is terrific with Jesse Eisenberg reprising his Social Media frown and brainy aura, and Woody Harrelson showing, once gain, why he is rapidly becoming one the the best actors working today. Throw in Mark Ruffalo, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman all skillfully directed in a satisfyingly intricate plot and you get a couple hours of terrific entertainment.",1382918400,,925,4.860759493670886

5521977,3,B00AW9M8N6,"""Now You See Me"" has a reasonably interesting premise that has a lot of promise, as well as a great cast including two Oscar-winners Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine. What could have been a great film is ruined - if not completely - by one simple mistake: overuse of special effects. Just imagine a classic ""Sting"" with CGI. That's ""Now You See Me.""

The film begins promisingly with four magicians ""The Four Horsemen"" - played by Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco - a group that pulls off a heist in Paris while being on stage in Las Vegas. Their incredible feat (that apparently involves teleportation) naturally attracts the attention of the public, and of course, the FBI agent played by Mark Ruffalo.

I know in this kind of fast-paced narrative, some part of the story often remain unanswered. Some (or most) situations are contrived, with characters making strange decisions. That's fine, as long as tricks are smart. That is not the case with ""Now You See Me,"" however, where thinly drawn characters and overused special effects during the key scenes only make us realize that the filmmakers including director Louis Leterrier (""The Transporter"" ""Clash of the Titans"") are only interested in tricking us, but not in how.

That doesn't mean the film is a total mess. ""Now You See Me"" is entertaining, but not enough for us to watch again.",1382659200,,1373,4.858974358974359

5522013,5,B00AW9M8N6,"To be right up front with it - I love magic, and I love a good caper. With a little misdirection, a little flair, and a lot of heart, 'Now You See Me' manages to be both.

What I love most about magic is the capacity to delight. By giving in just a little to the possibility of something wonderful, a good magician can create something that enchants and mystifies, something we can talk about later and tell our friends, ""wasn't that amazing?"" I had the same feeling after leaving the theatre after seeing 'Now You See Me' - I wanted to share this experience with my friends, to tell them about what made it so special, to encourage them to see it for themselves.

And the caper angle is right there too - four solo magicians, each with different talents, who come together to make an astonishing claim: in front of a packed Las Vegas audience, they're going to rob a bank. What follows is fun, exciting, mystifying, full of unexpected twists and turns, and packing a surprising emotional punch at the end. Carried by solid, believable performances from Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson, Mark Ruffalo, and the always-delightful Morgan Freeman, and shot in a dynamic style that made me feel like I was front row center for every trick, 'Now You See Me' carried me willingly along for the ride from beginning to end.

The Blu-ray edition of the movie follows a trend I like to see, including both the original theatrical cut and an Extended cut (adding about 10 minutes of footage in) on the blu-ray disc, and also including a separate DVD of just the theatrical version - giving us different viewing options depending on the equipment available. The blu-ray movie looks and sounds great, and the extra 10 minutes of movie in the extended cut aren't essential, but flesh out a couple scenes nicely.  All in all, a great package.

The only movie I can think to compare 'Now You See Me' to is one of my all-time favorites: 'Sneakers' - another caper movie with a killer ensemble cast, a great sense of humor, and an interesting story to tell. Remove the high-tech trappings of 'Sneakers' and replace it with the flourish of a little old-fashioned sleight-of-hand - keep the fun and the action and the surprises coming, and you'll come close to the experience of 'Now You See Me.'

""What is magic? Magic is deception, but deception designed to delight, to entertain, to inspire. It is about belief. Faith.""

'Now You See Me' is delightful, entertaining, inspiring, and even gives me a little glimmer of faith in the spell it casts. It's quite simply a little bit of magic.",1382400000,,2580,4.644736842105263

5522034,1,B00AW9M8N6,"I missed this movie in the theaters and was very excited to see it.  I thought I was in for a good heist movie.  What was delivered was a horrible, awful, terrible, crappy movie with so many holes that the entire movie falls through and crashes.  Not little holes but rather HUGE, GIGANTIC, CUJO sized holes...Spoilers Ahead.

I started writing a long review of the flaws of this movie and I just stopped myself.  Getting my irritation off my chest won't help.

Magic is not real.  But sometimes it is in this movie (flying capes and floating magic cards).
Hypnosis is not real.  But for this movie it is and we can make people fly across the world and tell us their bank info and go to some magic show by just walking by them and whispering.  Ahhh it pains me to even write the crap this movie pulled.

The second heist goes on to tell us that they invited 1000's of people to a magic show who all got screwed and knew they would come so they could pull their robin hood act.  Come on.
And why once the ending is revealed does the agent say ""freeze"" when he is in on it.

Car chase, how could they plan for that chase.  How did they know the agent would have a car to follow them.  And then their switch where they endangered peoples lives.  And does Woody just get to jump on a bus route and drive with a car attached to the front with a dead body in it and nobody on the bus questions this?  Really?
And again if the agent is in on it all, why would he climb into the car that was going to obviously blow up risking it all for the stupid third act that could have been done in any way.  And why did they risk the apartment fight and lead the cops there.  He knew his plan was to look incompetent.  Why lead them there and chance anything or anyone getting shot or killed and blowing the entire thing.  Why.

The third trick was CRAP.  Hey thousands of people show up and watch us jump off a roof and turn to money.  Oh wait fake money.

And then the morgan freeman scene in the cell...poof I'm now outside the cell without a sound. In a second.  Oh cuz magic is real.  Oh wait it's not cuz your entire show was all lies and illusions.

Like the stupid Mirror and Common playing air violin.  Who programmed him and why btw.

And then magic is real again as the 4 horseman cards fly in the air.  And then they get to be in the eye and go to an amusement ride.  Yippee.

It's a movie, I know just let it go.  Like I pointed out earlier, It wanted to be an Oceans movie pretending to be deep like Chris Nolan film.  But it didn't have good characters.  The banter was bad.  The premise was worse.  The story was a joke.  So I'm sorry, I cannot look past it.  This was a bad movie.

Don't look too close or you will miss it.  I think I looked to close.  Cuz I missed a good movie like the 5 star junkies.",1382140800,,2802,4.056776556776557

5522039,4,B00AW9M8N6,"Just finished watching Now You See Me. It was very entertaining. Very little character development with the majority of the characters, but that's due to the fast pace. The focus is on the overall plot, not the individual characters. With the exception of Morgan Freeman, they could have replaced any of the actors with other actors and the movie would have still been just the same. And with most movies, you can guess what's going to happen half way before you get there, but not so with this movie. I feel like the plot is a victim of its own success, though. It's as if the writers wrote and twisted themselves into a very small box with no way out. The ending suffers because of this. You're left saying ""What?"" and scratching your head. It's as if the writers closed their eyes, randomly chose a way to end the movie, and then did a horrible job of coordinating the ending with the rest of the plot. Enjoyed the beginning and middle, hated the ending. Regardless, though, you will be surprised!",1382054400,,1000,4.561111111111111

If you plan to watch, I suggest you do yourself a favor and read as little about this movie as possible. You'll enjoy the imaginative script, entertaining acting and the magic shows much better.

I will say a few things about the movie that won't ruin anyone's surprise. It is my intention not to oversell it, but enthusiastically recommend it.

The fun, imaginative, well thought out story was written by Edward Ricourt and developed for the screen by Mr. Ricourt and Boaz Yaki. It is a light-hearted, multi-layered story with a beautiful platonic relationship. There is a romance, but it does not distract from the story, but helps move it forward.

The acting ensemble is great. It is especially wonderful to see Mark Ruffalo in a leading role. Isla Fisher gives a confident, enthusiastic, powerful and sexy performance without being butch or sleezy, a refreshing change from most leading role actresses who are too skinny, flaunt their sexuality and are robotic and stunted in their performances.",1382054400,,1061,5.045714285714285

5522060,4,B00AW9M8N6,"This movie was full of suspense, twists and surprises.

The acting was top-notch. The directing and the flow were smooth. There's no moment of boredom.
It kept me on the edge of my seat from the beginning till the end. I could not figure out in advance what was going to happen next. I'm sorry I can't get into more details. Otherwise, I would ruin your enjoyment when you know things in advance.

While watching it, I had a feeling the style of the action was not typical Hollywood's. After that, I found out the director was Louis Leterrier, a French. No wonder, his action style was different.

Of course it had many logical holes. However, I was able to suppress my logic to enjoy it.

According to boxofficemojo dot com, below were the financial figures of the film:
Production Budget: $75 million
Domestic:  $117,723,989
+ Foreign:  $215,300,000
= Worldwide:  $333,023,989
So, it made money both domestically and internationally. It took in 258 million dollars more than its production cost. That's more than 3 times its cost. What a return on investment!

It's refreshing to watch a picture that is so different and more entertaining than most of the other movies of 2013. No wonder, it's the sleeper hit of 2013. Nobody could predict that.",1381881600,,1247,4.767441860465116

The cinematography is beautiful and the actors do the best they can with a mediocre script.  Woody Harrelson is always fun to watch, and Jesse Eisenberg and the rest of the cast do try  to develop authentic relationships between their one-dimensional characters.

From beginning to end the entire plot and heist scenarios are totally contrived - intended to convey merely the feeling of a good heist rather than something that is remotely believable.  Add to that the sorely lacking dialog, and extremely loose character and relational development, and you have a loser.  This is the tweener version of a heist movie, so don't come knocking if you're the type that looks forward to a great reveal.",1381622400,,572,4.419047619047619
5522108,5,B00AW9M8N6,"I admit I was skeptical about this film - so many positive reviews tend to set expectations too high. But this film really does deliver.

This is a really good piece of story telling and to stitch the film together without giving away the solution is a rare treat these days. Heck, I can usually work out the plot line of an entire film from the trailers alone, so I was pleasantly surprised. An excellent story could easily have been ruined by heavy handed or incompetent Direction or a poor screenplay. Fortunately the people in charge of this film really know their craft. This is a film that demands you pay attention, but makes doing so very easy indeed. Although some big name stars are associated with ""Now You See Me"", it is truly an ensemble production in which everyone contributes to the success of the finished product.",1381536000,,831,4.614864864864865
5522109,4,B00AW9M8N6,"""Now You See Me"" works as long as you suspend yourself in disbelief, try not to overthink it, and forget about how implausible it is.  This is popcorn cinema at its finest - the kind of movie that entertains while not being overtly deep.  It's the kind of film Roland Emmerich used to make back in the heyday of 1990s blockbuster cinema.

The movie starts with the supposed heist seen in the trailer.  As the story unfolds, Mark Ruffalo's character is trying to chase down the magicians and we are constantly trying to figure out how these feats were done, whose on whose side, and are appropriately kept on the edge of our seats while trying to do so.

The film works because of the actors, a fun (but albeit highly implausible) screenplay, and some really tight pacing.  The over the top tricks allow for a good show and the choice of actors is great.  Jess Eisenberg and Woody Harleson are easily the most fun to watch in this.  Then there's the neat little twist in the end, which, admittedly, the film didn't need, but it works.

I highly recommend this because it's so much fun to watch.  Just don't take it too seriously.  I miss a popcorn movie done well.  There are dozens of dumb, formulaic, repetitive popcorn films coming out nearly every week, but this one is different.  It's clever and doesn't try to be over intelligent.  You just have to watch it from that perspective, and you'll have fun.",1381536000,,1407,4.531746031746032

It makes Oblivion (haven't we seen this before), Iron Man 3 (what happened to Iron Man?) and After Earth (don't let your kids star in your films) look good in comparison.  Like others have said, there were no characters that you cared about in this movie - everyone was spouting clich's and attitude and playing their formulaic role to a tee.  The most disappointing thing was that if you expected to see some sort of interesting illusions or magic tricks, you will see nothing.  Just lots of lousy CGI.

For those other folks who are frustrated because they paid for the film but Amazon streaming is not working for them, well, I think you are better off.  You may have lost $5.00, but at least you did not lose two hours of your life to this pathetic film.",1381536000,5,809,4.469387755102041

5522114,2,B00AW9M8N6,"Meh!  Special effects were good, and the french character police detective is an excellent actress, even in this thin vehicle.  She stood out.  Also, the scenery was gorgeously presented. Woody Harrison's character was interesting, but they only gave a key hole into his character's background so his character development was incomplete.  You didn't really care about the other character's background so not disappointed the movie didn't even try to explain them.

This movie collapsed into chaos towards the end, like the trick cards they kept showing throughout the movie. I kept saying ""Wha? Wha??""  The guy from the Facebook movie was trying to play an arrogant bad ass, which is against type and he couldn't pull it off. Morgan Freeman looked like he was waiting for his check to arrive from this stupid film so he could build up his retirement fund. There was no light in Morgan's eyes, they were dull and he seemed bored.  The female character who played one of the 4 horsemen is so beautiful, but was unnecessarily sexualized. She was a talented magician, like the others, but for some reason she always had to wear sexy short tight outfits with stiletto high heel shoes, even when running (unlike the men who got to wear flat shoes and plain white t-shirts and loose black pants). I found that insulting and gratuitous.

Overall the film was stupid and when it started collapsing I was a little annoyed I'd spent so much time watching.  The special effects were good...oh I think I said that.",1381536000,,1502,4.8359375

How?  Well they put a huge floor to ceiling mirror in front of it silly!  The fact that they could never fit this mirror into the room is secondary to the fact that this mirror somehow doesn't reflect a whole crew of cops standing in front of it wondering where the safe went.  Instead, it somehow shows what the BACK of the room looks like, sans safe.  Riiiiight!

Firstly, lets talk of Jesse Eissenberg - I don't know why he did this film, he is a complete misfit in this outfit. He is a very intelligent actor and of course the film begins in an interesting tone but half an hour into it, you get this sinking sensation that you have seen the whole film.

Woody Harrelson is so 1994 and I'm afraid he can't get out of that mold.

The rest of the cast including Freeman and Ruffalo are there just to act like antonyms.

Overall, this film is not smart, it is very smug and assuming...

If you thought Ocean's 12 was a very good film, you will definitely like this one.

But if you like me, believe in the velocity of the punch more than the need to throw one, you will want to look elsewhere.

Looking for good similar films? Try ""The Criminal"" , ""Hard Eight"" , ""Rounders"" and ""The Prestige""

5522169,4,B00AW9M8N6,Interesting story line.  The end left some to be desired but the action was good and I was constantly wondering what they were going to do next or see if I could figure out what was going on and I definitely didn't expect the ending so overall good I just would never watch it again.

5522192,5,B00AW9M8N6,This movie reminds me of Oceans 11. The characters  and plot are fun. The only problem for me was that someone besides Mark Garrafalo should have played the lead. Everyone else was great. Its about magicians getting involved in crime through the use of illusion. Very fun.,1380931200,,272,4.787234042553192

5522201,5,B00AW9M8N6,"I heard different things about this movie. It seemed to shoot in and out of theaters quickly and was not advertised a huge amount.

Once it came out on Blu I waited a little and once the used price dropped I picked it up and I am so glad I did. The PQ and AQ are outstanding and the over-all flow, cinematography and soundtrack of this movie are very well done.

One thing about this movie is that you need to pay attention to all the little details because in the end everything adds up to making the ending equate to a semi-logical situation. There are many parts which defy realism and common sense, however you need to push that aside and simply enjoy the movie.

Now You See Me has an amazing cast and somehow they all work perfectly together in every way shape and form. Some were saying that there was not a lot of character development with the magicians, however this movie is not about the magicians, it's about the chase and trying to find them.

In 2013 there were only a few movies which stood out to me. World War Z, This is the End and Now You See Me. There are so many movies which are just fluff and don't seem to have it together. Now You See Me was a great fun movie and I highly recommend checking it out.",1380931200,6,1225,4.177966101694915

Not only the writing, but the acting by a top-notch cast pulled you in.

5522239,4,B00AW9M8N6,Good movie... Very action packed and suspenseful. Great if you are interested in magic and mystery!! One of my favorites:),1380672000,,122,5.15
5522240,5,B00AW9M8N6,I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would. Very fast paced and never boring. I definitely would recommend it.,1380672000,,116,4.571428571428571
5522241,5,B00AW9M8N6,"words can not describe how amazing this movie is. with an ending i did not see coming( and that is rare) the story was always captivating. if you want a fun and intense movie, this is the one. lots of humor, lots of action, and a little romance, this movie is perfect for everyone.",1380672000,,281,4.222222222222222
5522242,4,B00AW9M8N6,It was a good movie but it seemed like the creators tried a little too hard to give the wow ending,1380672000,,98,3.7142857142857144
5522243,5,B00AW9M8N6,"I loved it!  I didn't see it coming, which is nice for me.  Good for kids too (other than some language and sexual innuendo), but they may not be able to follow the concepts.",1380672000,,174,4.088235294117647
5522244,4,B00AW9M8N6,Not real believable. A lot of special effects but the story was entertaining. A lot of action the trick was a good story.,1380672000,,121,4.304347826086956
5522245,4,B00AW9M8N6,"Well done, fast paced and featuring a phalanx of accomplished actors. I liked the premise and the story was a bit like the 'Russian Nesting Dolls.' Stories within stories. Morgan Freeman is so good he never appears to be working no matter what he's doing. Eisenberg and Ruffalo are always solid and Isla Fisher is cute, funny and very good at her craft. I am also really enjoying the kind of renaissance of woody Harrelson. Either directors have finally developed a clear understanding of his vast repertoire of talent or he's settled down and is simply a lot more cooperative. Whichever, he's in a hell of a lot films and he's a joy to see working. He was stunning in 'The Messenger,' 2010.

All in, 'Now You See Me' was great entertainment. I had seen it in the theater and loved and it was almost as much fun the second time around.",1380672000,2,835,4.493421052631579
5522246,5,B00AW9M8N6,"Altogether, I've seen this film several times in a cinema setting and on DVD. So, it's apparent I enjoyed it. The altruism of the magicians impressed me the most. As for my DVD, the sound quality in the beginning scene is much lower than the other scenes when playing it (Now You See Me) on my home HD DVD player and when I tested the DVD elsewhere in another system. I'm not sure what caused the discrepancy in sound quality. Still, I play the DVD over and over again.",1380672000,,469,4.280898876404494
5522247,3,B00AW9M8N6,Kind of predictable plot. Total fluff movie with a few fun moments. Worth a viewing if you want a fun movie that you don't have to think about.,1380672000,,143,4.142857142857143
5522248,2,B00AW9M8N6,"I rented this for $3.99 which is much less than a movie ticket these days.  The movie didn't make much sense to me.  On a scale of 1 - 10, I would give it a 4.  I was disappointed in the ending -- no magic there!",1380672000,,212,3.5652173913043477

5522255,3,B00AW9M8N6,"Story is so contrived the viewer feels badly manipulated by the writers.  Despite the presence of able actors (Caine, Freeman), the acting is flat.  PG-13 constraints made it feel like TV.  Engaging but disappointing.",1380672000,2,217,5.323529411764706

We actually saw it in the theater first and after it was over I wanted to stay and watch it again. It is that good. So, of course I had to own it. That way I can watch it whenever I want. Awesome. I would recommend this movie to all my friends and family.",1380672000,,347,3.7027027027027026

5522264,3,B00AW9M8N6,I enjoyed the movie but the ending was somewhat dissapointing as it didn't completely close out the characters. It was still entertaining for a plane ride.,1380672000,2,155,5.0

4 more words. done.",1380585600,2,117,4.9
5522269,5,B00AW9M8N6,"Exquisitely well written.  In today's time and age, it's becoming increasingly impossible to come out with a story line and have actors/actresses whom actually fit and breathe the part together.  This is what happens and keeps you totally mesmerized the entire movie.  To follow one line of the illusionist is one thing...but to have so many directions to keep you trying to come to a logical conclusion to whom is doing what and be almost there...the point of knowledge, just to have that line close down fast.  If you want just an entertaining, fun movie that upon the end, you feel cheated because you think the movie was two darn short, either way, from the movie watcher to the FX enthusiast, this is definitely a movie for you. And with that being said; the cast was beyond superb for this adventure and fit right into the FX as well as the parts they portrayed.",1380585600,,868,4.616883116883117
5522270,1,B00AW9M8N6,"Did you like ""Broken Arrow""?  Is that a fun to watch movie for you?  If so, then you will love this insultingly bad abortion.  The absolute epitome of what is wrong with people.  High flash, low substance, looks and snarkiness in place of actually getting to know the character.  A mega suck-fest of the highest order with a surprise twist at the end that would only be a surprise to a chimp that had suffered severe brain damage.  You people make me sick.  Seriously.  Don't waste your money unless you are very easily entertained - I'm talking a ball on a string in a cup.",1380585600,2,574,4.4

But definitely an item of the popcorn genre: no-depth, no-brain, at whiles incoherent scenario, unexplained continuity gaps, shallow 0-dimensional character psychology, warbled even confused objectives on the part of the characters, (very) shallow acting (Michael Caine is particularly inept), incredible setup and deception by the revenge-driven actual culprit, inept and needless romance between the two cops ... need I say more?

5522295,1,B00AW9M8N6,I was looking for a good heist movie. This did not fit the bill. I felt this CGI-fest was a bunch of fantasy magic (i.e. make up whatever you want) doing its best to proclaim itself as reality-based magic (Copperfield-style illusions). I found many of the visuals and plot elements to be so absurd and distracting that I could not enjoy the movie.,1380412800,2,347,4.523809523809524

The means and motive provide a platform for a very good movie but the script and acting blow the opportunity. One could believe that the performers are as clever and resourceful as they are drawn.

5522322,2,B00AW9M8N6,"Before I begin, go ahead and read a few 5 star reviews on this one, notice the majority of the 5 star reviews are just so happy, jovial, nearly commercial sounding, also notice those reviewers have never reviewed anything else....ever!!!  These are plant reviewers to help the DVD sell.

Fast paced plot twisting let down. If you like movies with no explanation of plots or details or if you do believe in magic and everything you see then you'll love this.
If you prefer movies with plot building, character building, relating to the characters, substance and an ending that completes the movie, then do not watch this one. I love my 16yr old daughter but the good lord did not grace her with patience or common sense in the real world but she is trying. Having said that, she thought this was the best movie she had seen in her life. Absolutely no explanation on many plot twists, ---SPOILERS HERE...SPOILERS HERE.......The 5th Horseman we find at the end? He funded all that and was a full time police officer?  Who set up the elaborate show at the end? The lights, the props?
Are we to believe they hypnotized dozens and dozens of people? I thought they were street magicians not professional stunt drivers to do what they did on that bridge?..come on people.
And what actually happened-(the other 4 horseman)to them in the end? So there really is ""the eye"" ? This movie requires absolutely no thinking except to wonder why they would try to smooth over and explain so many unrealistic plot elements. The movie cannot figure out how to carry itself except jump from scene to scene with no logical substance. Don't waste your time or money.",1380326400,,1643,4.678200692041522
5522323,3,B00AW9M8N6,"The actors were good. The problem was with the introduction of the 4 leads: most of them were conartists and so I watched the film viewing them as villain-lites when the actual story was that they were heros, sort of; find I prefer my heros and villains more clear cut.  Basically no one to root for, no heros, no villains, didn't know what was going on until the reveal at the end. I don't mind surprise endings, just prefer characters to root for along the way.  None provided here. Two and 3/4 stars rounded up to 3.",1380326400,,519,4.34020618556701

The only good thing about this movie was Woody Harrelson, and he didn't get enough screen time. What a waste of talented actors! I couldn't help thinking, How could any of you have read this script and then still agreed to be in it? I didn't want to say how bad it sucked out loud in case my husband was enjoying it, until he started laughing during one of the parts where we were supposed to be ""moved."" What a relief!

5522331,5,B00AW9M8N6,"Great movie, with great acting.
  Overall it was a unique movie in a sea of book turned movies that have been coming out lately. It's funny and incredibly suspenseful, and strangely beautiful. The movie starts off as a bank robbery, and that is all the trailer leaves you with. It's far more than that, and far deeper. If you have nothing to watch, this is definitely a movie worth watching!!",1380240000,,392,4.585714285714285

5522333,5,B00AW9M8N6,This was a very exciting movie.  Well written and suspenseful.  Not many of movies today do I have an desire to see but this was an exception.  I generally like movies from Great Britain since they are usually so well written and acted and have interesting plots.  This one fit that category.,1380240000,,292,4.5576923076923075
5522334,4,B00AW9M8N6,A nicely paced popcorn movie that entertains from beginning to (almost) the end.  The weakness of the secondary ending can probably be attributed to its being a setup for a possible sequel.  Check your literary analysis at the door and enjoy a cleverly crafted romp with an interesting narrative.,1380240000,,296,5.020408163265306

5522340,5,B00AW9M8N6,"This doesn't happen often; a movie that I could not get ahead on the plot.  I'm big on figuring out what's going to happen next (I can't help it), so when I find a movie that keeps me guessing to the end, and has a reasonable ending, I come away satisfied.  If the movie is well written and the actors do their job, then I'm a fan.

While the movie shows you some of the tricks to a degree that allows you to say ""Ok, I can definitely see how that works"", they don't explain how the really (in my opinion) interesting tricks work and leave you wondering if perhaps if they are asking you to believe that there is at least just a little real magic in the world.",1380240000,2,660,4.061538461538461

A lot of usually very good actors that have been given pretty lame characters with lame lines in a movie with a very weak and unbelievable plot. I am very surprised that these actors actually did this movie. The studio must have paid them a lot to get them to do this weak movie. I could tell within the first 10 minutes of the movie that I was not going to like it, unfortunately I kept hoping that it would get better and watched the whole thing. Even the ""twist"" at the end was stupid.",1380153600,,586,4.1946902654867255
5522350,1,B00AW9M8N6,"This is one of those movies that tries to awe you with cheap tricks and visuals to distract you from the terrible movie that this is.

The movie starts out incredibly interesting, banding together 4 skilled illusionists/magicians, and prepares you for what you'd think will be an interesting ride.  Half way through you realize that there's literally...zero plot.  The entire movie is one giant chase scene.

The cast and acting is decent.  I love Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson, but overall it's very unimpressive.  The twist at the end is so incredibly dumb, the fact that it's done as dramtically as it is makes me think the producers of the movie know how bad this is and are playing up the joke.

I'll sum up the type of people that'll like this movie.  If you're over 21 and go to July 4th parties FOR THE FIREWORKS, you'll like it.  If you're a normal person who outgrew the awe of fireworks as a teenager, don't waste your time with this.",1380153600,3,951,4.579881656804734

5522407,5,B00AW9M8N6,"Again, 2013 gives us a well-rounded film in the form of Now You See Me. This movie is purely, yet simply awesome. Everyone who has not yet seen this movie should definitely watch it. Here are my thoughts.

What we have are a team of magicians and a agent determined to bring them down. This powerhouse cast consists of: Mark Ruffalo as Dylan the FBI agent, Michael Caine as Arthur Tressler, Dave Franco as Jack Wilder, Isla Fisher portraying Henley, Woody Harrelson as Merritt Mckinney, Morgan Freeman as Thaddeus Bradley, Melanie Laurent as Alma Dray, Jesse Eisenberg as Daniel, and rapper/rising actor Common makes minor appearances as Agent Evans. The whole cast was great; I was really impressed with Mark Ruffalo's performance and Jesse Eisenberg is quite the catch.

The story in this movie is not as simple as some would think it is. Sure, it DOES involve magic, illusion, and the art of deception, but expect some major surprises (especially towards the 3rd act) and many questions left that will hopefully be answered in the sequel.

I would honestly give Now You See Me a solid perfect score, although I do wish that a few things had been handled better. Nonetheless, Now You See Me is not only a cool, fun movie, IT IS entertaining. Out of 10 I give this movie:

9/10",1379894400,,1278,4.691964285714286
5522408,5,B00AW9M8N6,"but this movie was great, from the casting, to the script, to the execution of the story, nothing was as expected and the extended edition was just awesome.  don't bother with the theatrical other then the compare to how the extended was better.",1379894400,,245,4.6976744186046515

5522411,5,B00AW9M8N6,"If you enjoy thought-provoking, intense movies with lots of twists, you will love this movie. If you're looking for something to put on the screen while you do other stuff, wait until you have time to sit down and pay attention. Even if you don't typically enjoy ""magic shows"" this movie is riveting. It has suspense, thrills, a heist, plenty of chase scenes and action, some romantic tension, great special effects, and a surprise ending that is very satisfying. There is already buzz about a sequel, since this film had a budget of about 75 million and made 300 million in the box office. I highly recommend this movie for just about any situation.

5522417,2,B00AW9M8N6,"Now You See Me pits an elite group of world renown magicians, The Four Horsemen, against a disgruntled FBI agent in an intense game of cat and mouse. With a serious vendetta against the illusionists, Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) teams up with Interpol agent, Alma Dray (Mlanie Laurent) to catch The Horsemen off their guard. The illusionists have been given an impossible mission---to pull off a series of daring heists, stealing from a bevy of corrupt business leaders. And they do, in front of an audience during their show. And like modern-day Robin Hoods, they generously shower the stolen profits upon the unsuspecting crowd, all while staying one step ahead of the law.

I love movies that use real-life magic as a premise, movies like The Illusionist and The Prestige, so when I first saw the trailer for Now You See Me, I was really excited. Now You See Me had quickly become one of my most anticipated movies of the year. And much to my disappointment, it has also become one of the biggest letdowns of the year.

This movie has an all-star cast (Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, Jesse Eisenberg, Morgan Freeman, Michael Cain & Dave Franco), intriguing premise and SO much potential. So where did it go wrong? Poor character development, a shoddy script and too much time focusing on befuddling the viewer, for starters. It very much reminded me of The Gangster Squad with it's lack of intellectual integrity and try-too-hard attitude.

They turn Agent Rhodes (Ruffalo) into a total buffoon which makes the whole cat and mouse thing a bust. If you're going to use that angle, the opposing forces need to be equally matched, drawing out the suspense. Such was not the case here. And then you expect to see this group of talented actors shine, instead, it's like attempting to pull too many rabbits out of the hat. It's just a bunch of terrific actors who are totally restricted and undervalued. The draw of the film, The Horsemen, are given less screen time than expected and they're really the ones you want to see. Give me more Woody Harrelson!

Now You See Me promises many things to the viewer but it never delivers upon those promises. It's not cerebrally challenging the way a magic movie should be. The twists and reversals weren't surprising and were completely unbelievable. You didn't see them coming, not because of skillful misdirection as was often implied, but rather because the explanations were crooked and expedient. Especially, near the end as we backtrack through the movie's big events, the reveals are less-than-convincing than if you were to simply believe in real magic. I'll take fantasy over the contrived solutions in this movie.

Now You See Me, like most magic, is all smoke and mirrors with no real substance hiding behind the curtain. Basically, it's just one big pile of crap.

Food for Thought: Now You See Me is a mix of Robin Hood meets The Prestige---only not quite so good. Sure, it's got all the misdirection that a magic movie should have, but much like bad magic, there's no integrity. Flashy, full of bells and whistles and big personalities, this movie has so much potential. Unfortunately, it completely fails in the execution, rendering it one of my biggest disappointments this year. If you want magic then you should watch The Prestige instead.",1379894400,3,3294,4.852313167259786

The movie itself is really enjoyable.  It is well-paced and the writing is fantastic.  I enjoyed every exchange between the characters and was on the edge of my seat.  I enjoyed the magic acts as if they were happening in front of me.  The movie's theme appears in both the larger aspects as well as some of the most minute interactions.

What I didn't suspect was how these magicians would betray him.  WHAT???  Now, here's Morgan Freeman's character, debunking them and tracking them to expose them.

Ruffalo is so uncharismatic as to be distracting. He looks like a homeless guy and I felt as if I could smell him through the screen. Isla fisher is nice to look at but utterly unconvincing. Michael Caine and Morgan freeman turn in bland performances as the plot turns from a caper flick to a silly, mystical mess.  Eisenberg is fun to watch and may be the only bright spot.

5522483,2,B00AW9M8N6,"Showmen have no soul. This is a typical show-boating movie that has only one purpose: to look cool. The easiest way to do that is to turn the characters into some infallible ""winners"" who are always in control of everything. To me, all that control is seriously boring rather than cool. I like to see movies where the characters face challenges, have doubts, are faced with tough situations and sometimes fail. That feels real. This one felt like some perfume commercial where they're trying to sell you a cool image, rather than a product. It never had any soul.

I'm not even that concerned about plotholes and poor dialogue.

I think it may appeal to some teenagers or people who are into ""reality"" TV and celebrity culture.",1379635200,2,727,4.716535433070866

If Magic makes you wonder then you'll be really wondering watching this.  A bargin if you rent through Amazon Prime and worth a watch as it is different from everything else you might have seen.,1379635200,,458,4.170454545454546

The end is one part fantasy and one part twist that you see coming a mile away.  Just for kicks it also ends with 2 characters falling in love despite zero chemsitry between them during the movie.  It felt like they added the relationship int he last few minutes of the filming. It was awful.,1379635200,2,391,4.328767123287672

There were only two factors that decreased my enjoyment of this movie- I would have liked to have seen more interactions/character development between the Horsemen behind the scenes of the show (they had such a fun, snarky chemistry together) and I would've liked the ending to expound on ""The Eye.""

5522532,5,B00AW9M8N6,"Now You See Me is an old fashioned good time.  It offers a great, edge of your seat thriller along with a mystery and the added fun of totally cool magic.  There's even a little romance thrown in.  I think it's a movie that will appeal to a wide audience and even kids over about age 9 or 10 would probably get a kick out of it.  There's a lot of humor.  I just love Woody Harrelson's character for that reason.  He's the sarcastic soundtrack accompaniment to a lot of the hijinks that occur.  The basic story is that four magicians are brought together by a mysterious person to become The Four Horsemen. The group then proceed to conduct magic shows in which totally impossible feats (like robbing a bank and having all the money drop from the ceiling into the audience)are done flawlessly.  The FBI is called in to figure the whole mess out.  Mark Ruffalo plays the ever pragmatic seasoned FBI agent who is determined to find out the truth and stop the Horsemen.  The problem is that in order to arrest the magicians, the FBI would have to admit to believing that magic is real and that's not an option.  The Horsemen go on to perform more shows at different locations around the country and their actions lead to lots of action sequences, even a high speed car chase.  The ending has a surprise twist that pulls the whole thing together and leaves you with that sense of the possibility of real magic in the world.  It's a fun, smart  feel good movie.  Don't miss it.",1379462400,,1471,4.41635687732342

The pace of the the move was like a horse on a track, slower trot at the beginning and then faster trot and finally a run.  Seriously want to go fast forward to the end but resisted.  Was glad I did.  Lots of twists and turns in the journey.",1379462400,,322,4.129032258064516

5522547,2,B00AW9M8N6,"Quite honestly, I didn't know what to expect.  My wife suggested we watch it. I knew - within about 20 min's that this film had very little realism involved - with a plot more designed about reaching some final conclusion than bringing you there.  If - at least - the magic tricks in the film were more ""realistic"" than ""fantasy"" I think the film would have been better.  In the end - it just didn't feel real - very faked.

There is no plausibility here and for some movies that is ok, the acting is overdone but lot of fun parts to the movie and keep in mind this is a spoof. It is not trying to be a realistic movie but just entertainment.",1379376000,,349,4.0
5522557,4,B00AW9M8N6,"""Now You See Me"" is a caper thriller genre film based on a coalition of magicians/tricksters who are mysteriously brought together, and establish themselves as a performing group called ""The Four Horsemen"".

The narrative for the most part presents an escapade between ""The Four Horsemen"" and the FBI, but there are many subtleties and the group's name (The Four Horsemen) comes from the New Testament of the Bible, specifically, the Book of Revelation. Therefore, this name suggests the need to rid evil with a divine apocalypse. Subsequently, the key issues of the film are stealthily attached behind what seems like a game to evade both a sceptic of the group's magic and the authorities.

The movie presents a variety of characters with unique personalities and there are several gripping scenes which keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat.

5522561,4,B00AW9M8N6,"Much like a magic trick, this movie is very flashy, flamboyant and confident about itself. The cat-and-mouse game that happens between the different groups of characters was entertaining and the elaborate set pieces were impressive and flashy. The only thing that broke the suspension of disbelief are modern movie conventions: hip young kids are geniuses and adults are dumb, all of the handsome and beautiful actors and actresses are witty at just the right time, improbable ""Hollywood hacking,"" etc. It felt like I was watching the execution of a math equation written by movie execs called ""Clean, summer heist movie featuring stage magic."" It is predictably sleek and clever, but I guess that's what one should expect from this kind of a movie.

The movie starts out with a few minutes of each of the Four Horsemen's signature tricks. Then they move on to meeting and the then the viewer is watching the main event tricks. These tricks have people who have had hard times getting money. Who doesn't love that? There is a big trick in Vegas, New Orleans and New York. Then a surprise ending.

When it got to the big reveal, I felt that it kind of tricked the audience.  By that I mean, looking back you could see where a certain character tricked the other characters, and you go ah-hah, I see that now.

Interesting plot, attractive young protagonists, Michael Cain and Morgan Freeman along with a fully adult love-interest pair, a rumpled Columbo sort and the exotic, to American tastes, Interpol novice agent.  The plot seemed stitched together from the elaborate plans of massive magical enterprise where the execution includes the wiring diagrams for the effect.  You are left with less of a sense of wonder than bewilderment and a feeling of somehow having been duped by technology in an attempt to coerce you into believing in Magic.  Hmmm . . . Yet, although not quite an action packed thrill-ride, it was entertaining with Woody Harrelson's skepticism at least giving the viewer a voice.

Usually within the first 30 minutes of a suspense type movie I can figure out where the story is going and who did it, so to speak.  So when a movie stumps me, I really enjoy it.  The good thing about this movie it was a light hearted suspense movie, you could relax and enjoy it at the same time you are constantly thinking, ""ok what's next, what's really happening"".

5522610,2,B00AW9M8N6,"I'd heard from someone I know that this movie was full of twists and turns and a must see.

I was bored.  Until the action started (nearing the middle/end).  And, I figured it out anyway.  It's rare that I don't figure out a show anyway.  I always say that's the ""writer in me"".  And, I drive my family nuts b/c I'm always saying this or that will happen.  A lot of times, I am right, but not always.

What was boring?  The Vegas show stuff over and again until everything was tied together.  I didn't care for some of the acting, it seemed lack-luster. Like maybe even a few of them didn't like what they were doing?  I wasn't sure if the show was trying to be realistic or fantasy.  It straddled both, and didn't stretch my imagination to accomplish that.

But, like I said, someone I know said it kept her guessing all the way through and saying ""WHAT!?"" at the end.

I loved Ruffalo in The Avengers ... he makes a great Hulk.  I liked seeing him in something else - let's me know even more how much I liked him in The Avengers, though I didn't dislike him in this. Maybe it's the genre.  Morgan Freeman - always good (or haven't seen him in a bad role).  However, somewhat predicable was his role.  In so many ways, much was boringly predictable.  One guy talked way too fast.  And, some of it was simply unbelievable (like when the transporter functioned).  The trickery behind it and the explanation about magic not being magic just slight of hand - was good.  The finale?  Unbelievable x 2.  It's like it had 2 endings.

But, that's just my opinion.  Maybe, if it had been adjusted here and there, they would have had me more interested.  Wish I had known, I would not have rented it.  :(",1379203200,2,1695,4.312101910828026

This is a dazzling puzzler of a film with a plethora of plot twists and sleight of hand,designed to not only fool the characters on screen but we the audience also. The film reunites stars Eisenberg and Harrelson,since their first collaboration in Zombieland.
The story finds four single act magicians,one who specializes in lock picking,bending spoons,etc,the other a mentalist,the other a card trick master and lastly an escape artiste. They one day all get a special card telling them to meet at an apartment. Inside they are given instructions by remote,and a year later they are all in Vegas doing a joint act;now known as the Four Horsemen. In Vegas they ""pick"" out a visiting Frenchman from the vast audience and have him ""rob"" his personal bank in Paris,through ""teleportation"".After the show the bank in Paris has indeed been robbed and the four are arrested by the FBI.Without just cause and total lack of connection,the foursome are let go. We are introduced to a debunker who has been following the four and wants to expose them and will follow them to the end.
The next big trick is in New Orleans. This time they have their benefactor/backer on stage with them. As they have each member of the audience check their bank accounts,the audience finds theirs going up while the funds are coming out of their benefactors account,much to his chagrin. After the show their mentor,who is now seeing red,finds the debunker and puts him on the payroll to expose them.
The groups last big trick is in New York where there is a safe loaded with multi millions of dollars. Through their usual means,the group manages to spirit the safe away right from under the FBI noses. After all is said and done the FBI investigator who has been so far behind this group arrests the debunker. The debunker never saw it coming,neither did we,that the lead FBI man was somehow behind it all.
Meanwhile the four have appeared in Central Park at a tree containing a card left behind by a long dead magician called Shrike. The four put their original cards together,which activates the card in the tree,which in turn starts a nearby carousel moving. In front of the carousel is the FBI agent,who welcomes them to the ""eye"" .They all board the carousel and ""disappear"".Time passes and a French Interpol agent who was working with the FBI agent on the case from the start,is sitting on a bench on a bridge in Paris,when the agent appears. It is learned he is the son of the long dead magician. Along with revenge on the debunker who humiliated his father,he got revenge on the company that produced the sub par steel in the safe his father drowned in,and the bank and the benefactor of the Horsemen who originally refused to pay on the insurance claim. Fade out.
The film itself resembles a magic act before your eyes,as deception after deception is played out by multiple characters and we,like the audience in the film,are often fooled and amazed. Some of the tricks are explained and others are not(hey there are some secrets that are sacred after all).When it all comes down to the end of the film,like Harrelson's charcater says""I didn't see that coming"".All the actors do a tremendous job together and obviously had some fun doing this film.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include a featurette and commentary.
All in all a nicely done who done it,wrapped in the guise of a huge magic act,with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing right to the end. A solid four stars,and maybe a little more.",1379203200,,3728,4.863207547169812

There is always a certain element of hanging reality up and just getting in to a story on the screen, but try as I might, the sheer ridiculousness of this movie wouldn't let me escape. The acting was sub par (actually, it was terrible), the dialogue trite with the heir of an after school special (okay yes, I'm a tad older than the targeted demographic), and the story had so many holes it was sheer magic I even made it to the end.

When I picked out the 7 of diamonds at the beginning of the movie from the card trick, I should have known then this movie was weak. The movie starts in a way with each actor playing their usual characters in other movies, with mediocre acting at best. And then the characters never really grow on you. The story line is a stretch and the ending is make-believe. The movie peaked my interest in the beginning because the story line had great potential but sputtered to nowhere. The actors had no emotion, the magic was not explained but it was performed like it wasn't a movie about magic, and the villain turned out to be practical. They try hard to make the movie suspenseful and dramatic with the magician's music playing in the background but it just gets annoying.

Combine that with a strong cast of actors and one's hopes begin to soar.  However, lower your expectations dramatically before seeing this film because none of it succeeds.

The illusions - which are arguably the heart of the movie - are flat and lifeless thanks to an almost complete dependency on CGI.  It's as if the director is saying: HERE! LOOK! This is an amazing trick! It's so amazing it's practically unbelievable! ...Oh, but it is unbelievable because we've executed it with computers. Multiply that disappointment by virtually every single gag and trick in the film - of which there are many -- and we're left with a totally lifeless series of stunts that are presented as if they're the greatest thing on earth.

The completely incomprehensible and undeveloped ""conclusion"" of the film is astonishingly poor.  The movie not so much concludes as it ceases to stop trying to carry on.  I can't relay to you what the point of this film is meant to be; it doesn't have a point.  It merely exists, and that's not enough.

Seemingly some good pieces are present to forge an energetic and mysterious heist flick (Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine for starters), but astonishingly few of those pieces have been placed properly.  A waste of potential as depressing as anything I've seen in a long time.

I couldn't help but ask basic questions:
""Where did that mirror come from?""
""How much would a mirror like that cost?... more than the heist?""
""What kind of work force would it require to transport and install a mirror like that?""
""How long would it take?""

I know, I know... it's a movie. But even these kinds of holes do require some patching to create continuity.

Although the movie was ""action-packed"", it was too under-developed and hence is more appropriate for kids.
Still, the movie was okay for a rental if you're hard pressed to find anything to rent. Even with that in mind, it left me slightly wishing I had not seen it at all.

It's rare to start a movies and not know how it will end in the first five minuets these days. Because the writing is predictable and they tell the same story from the same voice often in movies, but  this movie breaks out of the mold. Bravo, Bravo!",1379030400,,396,4.424657534246576
5522679,5,B00AW9M8N6,"Now You See Me was a true breakout hit of the summer. A fantastic cast, bringing some of their best work, meshed with an excellent heist movie plot and good cinematography really elevates this above the rest. In particular, Jesse Eisenburg and Woody Harrelson are back from Zombieland and have even better chemistry here than there, but all four of the Horsemen are stellar. Watch this movie! You'll be surprised and amazed in equal measure, and I guarantee the climax will catch you off guard!",1379030400,,494,4.823529411764706

The character development is minimal and you never really become vested in the story line and care whether a character is imperiled, lives or dies. Like any magic show, the characters are two dimensional, you know the magician will not perish, so you are there just to be amused by the special effects. Mostly you are just waiting for the next action sequence which, are impressive and fun.",1379030400,,478,4.7023809523809526

But if you are looking for some good fun, one liners, a cast that feeds well off each other, and some cool ""illusions"" then this is it. The movie doesn't try to be more than it is. It's a movie about magicians that with the help of it being a MOVIE do some really cool over the top unrealistic stuff. If your problem of the movie was ""Well that can't be real, or they couldn't rob a bank like that"" then you missed the point. Sit back and relax! Don't take things so literal and enjoy the over the top ride that is Now You See Me. I loved it!",1378944000,,615,4.008130081300813

5522707,3,B00AW9M8N6,"Slightly annoyed that the magic in the film was obviously created with CG. Action packed. However it did lag in the middle quite a bit. It's funny they market the movie like the magicians are the main characters. When really the relationships around them are the real story. It was decent. Definately better than the other recent magician move Burt Wonderstone, lol.",1378944000,,366,4.919354838709677
5522708,3,B00AW9M8N6,"I've heard it said of sales that people tend to buy on emotion and later justify their purchase with logic. Well, the fact that it had some good actors and a interesting concept certainly got my emotions. I was excited to see it. But then my logic tried to justify it to no avail. Here are some problems I had. First of all, I immediately noticed that Jesse was playing the same character as he did in The Social Network. You know, a brilliant-minded prick. And is there any different role for Morgan Freeman to play other than an old wise owl? Woody plays the typical role he's played since White Men Can't Jump. Ruffalo was so angry all the time in the film I expected him to turn into the Hulk at any moment. As far as the other characters, I was not familiar with them. The Interpol agent was pretty and...that's pretty much that about her. Now to the concept: We see the stunts and they get explained to us. That about sums up the plot. Then there was this eye of something thing. The whole movie goes to great lengths to show us basically what magic is, but then tries to say magic is real. So basically, though I wanted to get into some cool story that hasn't been done before (at least to my knowledge) I wasn't really invited ""in"" (those who watch should know what I mean). One last thing: Where was the production crew during all of this? You can't tell me the Three Horse Men w/One Horse Lady were able to set all the events up by themselves. In the end I am just left with too many illogical holes that can't be filled and can't be ignored to justify my purchase. If I were to wait a while to write this review, I might eventually give it one star but my logic is still fighting my emotions.",1378944000,,1703,4.243076923076923

Actually I think they probably did a while back, they really should think about shutting down for a while or reducing the movies released. There was nothing in the movie that somehow you don't get the feeling you have seen before. There was no story depth, no character build up. The reason I give it 3 star is that it is relatively mild compared to the dark vulgar drabble that Hollywood produces these days.",1378944000,,472,4.436781609195402

5522713,1,B00AW9M8N6,"Warning: Spoilers

Horrible movie about revenge through completely unbelievable suspension of disbelief. ""You drove my dad to kill himself, but I'm gonna plan for 30 years to get my revenge when you're an 80 year old man"" is basically the whole plot of the movie. Additionally, according to the movie we live in a world of holograms, real time Satelite tracking, but not in a world of security cameras or competent security and FBI members.

To that effect, you're telling me that a secure place holding a safe with $500,000 has a staff so stupid  they don't notice the installation of a giant mirror, or when they run up to it they don't see their reflections, or have any security cameras?

Also, who was setting up these massive installations for the magicians? Like the ending scene in 5 points has choreographed light installations, and Hologram technology Star Wars would envy lol. ""Oh it's cool, we just threw it up there, took 5 minutes""

Then for the big dumb ending somehow the whole city knows where the party is, except the FBI is running around saying ""OMG where are they going to be next?"" Then when the FBI does finally show up at the right place they don't put the area on immediate lock down.

But it's cool, i'm sure a 12 year old boy had the foresight to see 30 years ahead to know that he would eventually go to school, spend years of training to become an FBI agent, become a prominent agent, be put on the case of magicians stealing money that he also orchestrated, so that he could avenge the death of his father against evil corporations and Morgan Freeman.

This guy's 6th sense is so amazing it give Emperor Palpatine a run for his money. If he could see into the future like that, he should have just picked the lottery numbers.

So I became hesitant that we might have to turn off the movie....We did not however...the movie had only 1-2 other suggestive comments regarding sex and profanity.

The movie does a decent job at leaving you in the dark for most of the movie as to the purpose of why these 4 magicians are doing what they are doing throughout the movie. This movie is a kind of ""The Prestige"" meets ""Ocean 11"" combination with some elements from both.  The elements of each for the most part works well.

The action and a strong soundtrack keeps this movie paced well and keeps you interested throughout.

I definitely prefer the extended version to the theatrical. The few things that were added made the movie more enjoyable. It flowed much better. Now I want to compare the two. It was a rip roaring ride from beginning to end. Even though I know how it ends, I still catch things I missed the first two times. The extended version is only on the blu-ray.

Watch it for the special effects and some magician show type trickery, but don't expect a movie with an intricate plot or characters with depth to them.

It was a cleverly put together mystery where you weren't sure what would happen next.

The actors were really good. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine were great as well as Woody Harrelson and of course Mark Ruffalo. Isla Fisher and Dave Franco (James Franco's brother) were good too.

It also didn't have alot of violence or sex so if you want to know if you could have kids watch it I think it would be OK. They mention sex in one scene but that's it.

a well laid out plot with a good mix of drama, illusion and action.  Mixed with enough counterplay between the different Egos as it goes along. Does leave you realising what it is that draws you into the world of magicians like David Copperfield. You know its a trick, you know its slight of hand, misdirection and illusion, yet for the life of you you cant figure out how they do these things.

Mr Morgan Freeman plays his role of Know it all Magician debunker well, as well as filling in the backstory and moving the plot along so you know that the story is about more than just the tricks. Woody does well as the manipulative mentalist who is just a little too far over the line. Jesse plays the rather neurotic and controlling magician, with just a few hints of the controlling role he played in the social network, and Ms Fisher did well as the harry houdini escapologist.

What a big budget cannot always provide is a good, intelligent script. This has got to be one of the worst films I've seen this summer for several reasons:

1. IMDB somehow has this film rated 7.1 stars, which is pretty high and usually spot on in terms of what I agree with. That's how I got roped into watching it in the first place. I'm left scratching my head on how it got 7.1 stars!
2. The premise of the plot is almost blatant propaganda. Geared toward angst-filled teenagers and Occupy-minded individuals, the plot is all about how sweet revenge is, based on themes of wealth-redistribution. Couple that with the intrigue of joining secret societies. The dialog is over the heads of most teens, and far too boring at times to keep their attention. My 2 teenage kids left to do other things after 20 minutes into the flick which, after watching the whole thing (hoping it would somehow get better) had me relieved.

5522897,3,B00AW9M8N6,"Nice rainy day flick for the 12 - 16 yr. old crowd. Despite what the trailer & opening scenes imply, this wasn't really a thinking-person's movie; fun to watch, entertaining but not engaging.  I won't give away anything but a fairly alert / intelligent teen could quickly narrow down the list of suspects to find the one pulling the strings behind the elaborate tricks; after all, the viewer is constantly warned about falling for misdirection and distractions. Once you subtract out all the distractions in the movie, the remainder leaves you with few choices as to who could be orchestrating the whole thing.

Never the less, the ""tricks"" (bank heist, draining the millionaire's bank account) were just a tad too over-the-top to be taken seriously, but some of the standard stage illusions were satisfying to watch. The film starts out well enough but gets less-believable as it moves along.  The number one rule of magic: the simpler the trick, the better. Technically complicated illusions have too many things that can go wrong -- like obtaining the password to a millionaire's bank account.  It apparently never occurred to the writers that your average millionaire actually holds relatively little in liquid assets and what cash he or she keeps on hand is most likely maintained in multiple accounts; accounts utilizing multiple-layers of security including complex passwords with non-alphanumeric characters. Sheesh, anyone who does on-line banking knows that!

And that's why I rated this 3-stars. The film was promoted as being somewhat cerebral in nature but, in the end, it really wasn't. Too many plot holes, too many over-used plot devices, zero character development, unresolved plot points. Maybe a good basis for an interesting TV series, though.",1378425600,3,1763,5.193661971830986

All the known actors probably filmed their parts in 3 or 4 days, because they are hardly in the movie.  That's some real Hollywood magic.  Nothing made sense.  The magicians were basically God, completely infallible, perfect in every way. Unrelated to the aforementioned God comparison, they weren't around as much as we'd like either.  Insult to injury, they were horrendously developed as characters.  We didn't really ever meet them.

For one thing, the viewer really never gets to know the four magicians in the film.  Their main role in the film is to perform on the stage doing magic tricks.  While it's true that a couple of the tricks are somewhat spectacular, the viewer never really connects with the magicians.  There is a better connection with Mark Ruffalo's character and Morgan Freeman's character, but there too, the viewer never really gets to know either of them well enough.  The result is that watching the film feels like watching a performance instead of becoming absorbed with the story.  The relationship between Ruffalo's character and the Interpol character never really takes off either.  At the end of the movie, I was left wondering why they were even thrown together in the film.  Overall, I think this film is worth a view--once, anyway.  I will probably never watch it again.

One problem is the level of expectation that the advertising set for the movie, it didn't really do a great job of saying what the movie is about. Throughout the movie I was surprised by the amount of screen time certain characters got over the Four Horsemen. This movie is really much more of a Mystery/Thriller as seen from the cops trying to figure out how these things were done.

I really had a lot of fun watching this movie and there were parts where I was completely taken by surprise which I really enjoyed. If you like watching detective shows, have a love for Illusions and Magic then this is a movie you would like.

5522961,4,B00AW9M8N6,"This movie is magic. It is simply fantastic entertainment that keeps the viewer glue to the screen trying to figure out the impossible things that are happening to a superlative groups of actors playing well written roles (written by  Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin and Edward Ricourt) and directed with aplomb by Louis Leterrier (Clash of the Titans, The Incredible Hulk, Transporter 2, Unleashed, and the soon to be made Now You See Me 2!) whose imagery and imagination is endless.

The story is simple but inordinately complex in the way it is shared. Four magicians each answer a mysterious summons to an obscure address with secrets inside. A year later, they are the Four Horseman (Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, and Dave Franco), big time stage illusionists who climax their sold out Las Vegas show with a bank apparently robbed for real. This puts agents Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) of the FBI and Alma Vargas (M&eacute;lanie Laurent) of Interpol on the case to find out how they did it. However, this mystery proves difficult to solve even with the insights of the professional illusion exposer, Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman). What follows is a bizarre investigation where nothing is what it seems with illusions, dark secrets and hidden agendas galore as all involved are reminded of a great truth in this puzzle: the closer you look, the less you see. Add to this rather amazing cast the talents of Michael Caine, Michael Kelly, Common, David Warshofsky, Jos&eacute; Garcia, and Elias Koteas  and the talents of Brian Tyler, musical score and the cinematography by  Mitchell Amundsen and Larry Fong and this film becomes addictive.

In the beginning of the film, an unnamed (but certainly not unseen) individual aims
revenge toward's his father untimely death by searching out 4 of the best magicians
in the business to perform acts of unheard magic tricks and antics before sold out
crowds and showering them with money supposedly stolen from a bank in France, and
other subsidiaries tied to the death of a man more than 20 years ago.  After the 4
magic artists have eluded the FBI with tricks of their own (some of it hilarious),
they gather near the end to see who is their benefactor - which turns out has been
someone they have been eluding all the time during their run.  Very well done.

The film has be seen several times in order to put together all the points leading
to the ending, so you may have to see this film twice (or at least parts of it).

Lots of misdirection and slight of hand but the lamest of endings.  Did the writers really think that Morgan Freeman's character would make a good fallguy.  He couldn't be convicted for anything . . . How could they explain that he was doing this to steal the money in the last safe?  Do they think he was going to get away in a vehicle so full of money that he couldn't even get in to drive away?  How about the four magicians?  How do they feel when they get invited to join the eye and find out it's nothing more than a free ride on a carousel and having to hide for the rest of their lives because, afterall they're wanted criminals.  How does Mark Ruffalo's character think he'll skate the rest of his life without being found out as the mastermind?  Afterall, the four magicians or at least some of them will eventually get caught and tell the FBI who the real mastermind is.  Perhaps Ruffalo's character doesn't care as, afterall he got his revenge and satisfaction and doesn't care about anything else.

I always check amazon now to see what we the people will give a film out on dvd. I will simply not watch a movie if it gets lower than 4 stars.

I enjoy it when I can rent a movie not expecting much from it and end up pleasantly surprised. My only issue with the movie, and one that didn't really detract from my fun in watching it, is that the magic tricks became so detailed that this movie started to enter the land of science fiction. I don't care how good a magician is there was no way some of the things in the movie would ever happen, and I was almost expecting to see a time traveler from the future responsible for giving them the ability to do some of the fantastical things that I saw.

5522984,4,B00AW9M8N6,"This is a review of the extended version of the film watched with the BluRay copy. It may contain some minor spoilers.

At the end I found the film a satisfying heist film and a satisfying magic film. I am quite the lover of magic films of which there have been many lately ever since watching Tony Curtis as Houdini every year on Family Classics (TV).

However early on in the film (with a running time of over 2 hours) I found some of it heavy going. I thought that Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman both phoned in performances cloned from other movies. I can understand the age needs of the Freeman and Caine characters for plot reasons but I think other character actors would have better value to the parts. The main problem with the characters is that there is no actually likeable or unlikeable but interesting person to identify with. One starts to wish the all the characters will be killed off in nasty ways to get to a satisfying ending. The female escapologist was the most interesting of the ""four horsemen"" but did not seem to get much screen time. Indeed none of the ""four horsemen"" characters was given any real background or development excepting for a hackneyed plot point of a former relationship between two of them. It would have been better if they had been brother and sister, fraternal twins even, who previously had worked together and now loath each other. The other female character, the Interpol agent, would have been interesting if given more development. Instead she was a useful red herring and an attachment point for a possible romance which was unbelievable and more sexual harassment than anything else. The many chase scenes, seemingly mostly in the dark, were typical film chases: everyone can run full out for long periods, no one gets hurt when they fall, no clothes are ripped, no collateral damage to civilians during car chases. There are also certain plot points whose improbably even impossibility needs to be ignored especially when it comes to the computer and phone hacking elements.

At the end I did enjoy the film because the puzzle of the plot when fully uncovered gave that flush feeling one gets at the end of films like ""The Sting"". And, of course, it is a film about stage magic which was done to a high level. It even looked ""practical"" in most respects and not a result of editing or CGI.",1378252800,,2345,4.659420289855072

At least that is my impression of it.  The action is not so much action (violence) but thrilling scenes.  The acting was decent and the story was good too.  They left it off where this could potentially become a series which might be nice.  I figured most things out but the ending I didn't see coming.  It was one of my ideas in the beginning but with so much misdirection by the end I was fooled like everyone in the film.  The tricks they perform would be amazing to see live if this was real.  It mixes elemnts from a lot of diffirent shows and movies.  You could think of the team in a kind of leverage (the show) type of way.  It also had some elements of national treasure which might spoil some things so I won't go into detail.  I however didn't see it being anything like oceans so don't try and compare the two.  Some things are predictable so when you get to the part with them debunking the rabbit trick think of the movie in the same way.  They show you some things so you don't see others.

I think this would have worked better as a heist movie, rather than a ""whodunit,"" as it ended up being. All along, the story wants you to figure out who brought them all together, and why. The third act doesn't quite pull everything together like it should. There's enough in here to make it worth a rental. Woody Harrelson is fantastic as a mentalist. Eiseneberg does his usual thing very well, and Isla Fisher does very well in her role.

The CONS of Now You See Me, and then PROS are conjured up by me below. AlakaZAM! Let us begin.

CONS:  Breezy fun as it might be, when the movie tries to be serious it fails miserably. When the movie races at fast-pace, giving us sleight of hand, impossible feats of magic, and witty banter, all is fine and dandy. When Now You See Me tries to explain itself logically, it comes off as trying too hard. As Michael Caine says in The Prestige, we _want to be fooled. But we don't want to be cheated, and the admittedly unforseen twist ending was shocking for one breathless second, until we realized how extraordinarily unlikely, impossible, and silly it actually was. And also, the use of CGI for magic is a dubious choice. When we know what we are seeing onscreen was generated by computers and some greenscreen, it's harder to feel amazed and awed by the spectacular tricks.

PROS: But hey, I'm taking this too seriously! NYSM is the perfect film for a night of carefree entertainment. Now You See Me combines healthy doses of action, humour, twists and turns, suspense, and a fresh sense of fun to make one of the rare original but engaging blockbusters out this year. It's no wonder Now You See Me was a surprise hit, outgrossing The Lone Ranger and Pacific Rim in the States.

It's success is due in no small part to it's talented and diverse cast.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jesse-Eisenberg/dp/B004HWT6DO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jesse Eisenberg</a>&nbsp;plays smug, difficult know-it-alls like he was born to, and his illusionist J.

Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine are woefully underused. Not once did Caine ask if we were watching closely. But Caine is a remarkably suave gent, and Freeman makes every movie he's in 33.33% better. Quote me on that.

By no accounts a truly GREAT film, Now You See Me successfully treads the thin line between silly and utterly entertaining by welcoming and embracing it's own silliness straight out of the door. You should even have such a great time that you forget that the plot is nonsensical and the twist at the end makes no sense. So come in close, because the more you actually see, the easier it will be...to have a great time at the movies.

5523014,4,B00AW9M8N6,"Now You See Me is about as close to a magic trick as a film can become - it's glitzy, slick, fast, fantastical and ultimately nonsense. Unlike the vast majority of 2013's theater offerings, it's undoubtedly exciting and entertaining and keeps a pace going that stops the audience asking really obvious questions. But unlike other recent magic-themed films such as The Illusionist and Prestige, both of which have tricks of their own and get better with each viewing, Now You See Me gets flimsier and less substantial the more you think about the plot, and feels more like a pick-pocketing scam than a grand heist.

The opening quickly establishes four supposedly world-class magicians, none of which seems to have any really great acts, and they are assembled by a mysterious hooded character who gives them all coded tarot cards to meet. Naturally, they all do and are led to an apartment where a grand scheme is unveiled in 3D holographic schematics that a NASA engineer wouldn't be able to understand. Somehow they figure it out and united as the Four Horsemen, the crew now put on Robin Hood-style shows where the wealthy are robbed and the poor are literally showered with cash. Sounds like fun, right?

Unfortunately, the logic gets so bad so quickly it becomes ridiculous. After a French bank is robbed by magic, an Interpol agent is sent to Vegas to work with the FBI (good luck getting the paperwork to approve that partnership). The FBI proves to be staggeringly incompetent as our magicians show a near-psychic capability to outwit them at every turn. At one point, our heroes even hijack a bus rigged with a flipping and exploding squad car to fake a disappearance, all set up within minutes at exactly the right point on a bridge. They even install a massive, smear-free, 5-ton mirror to hide a safe instead of simply stealing it, hoping that the police stand only at exactly the right angle to see it's gone (and praying they don't dust for prints and bang their heads on the mirror).

This is all part of the fun but by the time act three rolls around, the film doesn't even pretend to be about illusion and mind-games anymore - it quickly descends into impossible CG shots and absurd set pieces that are fun but betray the original premise completely. The big reveal for one of the major characters is completely unbelievable, worsened by a really weak romance plot that's wedged into the storyline. The actual finale is such an insult to the audience that I couldn't believe it made the final cut.

Still, the remarkable thing is that it's an enjoyable film that, just like a well-executed illusion, keeps you watching and guessing if ultimately it's a bit disappointing. None of the characters really develops, nothing of any substance really happens, and none of the heist twist stand up to any scrutiny, but in a year full of truly atrocious movies, it's relatively decent.",1377648000,2,2893,4.791583166332665

5523016,2,B00AW9M8N6,"I truly was hoping I would like this based on the number of positive reviews. However this movie failed my eye roll test in literally seconds. It smacks of lazy writing and poor characterization. For example, imagine if in trying to convey that a character the author had created was famous, people walking by the main character would stop and say ""hey! you're a famous!"" that's how lazy the writing is. And then Morgan Freeman shows up and my eyes rolled yet again. Hey guys like Morgan Freeman? Then you'll love it when he's in every movie! See! Now he's not special anymore! It's great!

I was hoping to at least get some cool magic or practical effects. Nope- this movie actually uses computer graphics and special effects! Does anyone grasp how dumb that is? When a magician in the movie is eaten by piranhas to the shock of the crowd, and the piranhas are cheesy computer graphics, is anyone at home supposed to be intrigued or impressed? Oh she didn't actually die....you don't say. Oh she was in the crowd...you don't say. Oh look the crowd is losing its mind cheering, she must be a great magician. Even the card tricks performed are ones that I remembered from seeing friends do in elementary school. Basically- instead of writing intelligent characters or actually using cool magic tricks in the movie- the writers just made everybody else in the film completely clueless. Oh and the dialogue- including the ""witty"" banter, is petty and totally devoid of chemistry.

Here's a bullet with your initials fired from a gun and caught in the teeth of someone across the stage. Watch as these nails and swords pierce my flesh with no seeming damage. Solid Lucite box? I'll float in it. Ta da.

Movie magic requires a whole lot more to both earn and reward that suspension of disbelief. It takes interesting and believable characters. It takes entertaining and engaging storytelling. It takes a movie world that plays by some understandable and consistent ground rules. Without that, all you've got is spectacle. A lot of hocus with none of the follow-up pocus. If that makes any sense.

NOW YOU SEE ME is a story about four B-list magicians who are invited via mysterious cards to be a part of some kind of be-all, end-all magic trick. It might have something to do with a magician named Shrike who died during a botched trick long ago. It might have something to do with robbing millions of dollars in cash. It might even have something to do with a group called The Eye that is the supposed guardian of real, live, actual magic!

It's really not very clear. Ever. Like a magician with too much patter, the movie keeps trying to explain itself but is still so desperate to keep some of that magic that its explanations only go halfway. Most of them come from Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman), a man who has dedicated his life to debunking magicians. He keeps detailing how tricks are done, but he never really does fill in all the blanks. He can tell you how four magicians robbed a bank in Paris while standing on a stage in America, but he conveniently leaves out the part where they burst into wads of cash while jumping off a twenty story roof. The last third of the movie is glutted with this kind of heavy and inconsistent exposition, and it makes the film feel like it's not entirely comfortable with its subject matter.

Because there's so much going on, there is really very little time to get to know or even care about any of the characters. Our four magicians end up feeling more like props or set pieces, and in spite of their glitzy bravado and showmanship, they are about as hollow and fake as a mirrored box. The movie's emotional hook lies in Dylan (Mark Ruffalo), the FBI agent who is hell-bent on hunting them down. Unfortunately, he ends up being a one-note character as well, and the story takes him into a place that is supposed to be magical, but that ends up feeling like a really cheap trick, like the ""got your nose"" of the cinematic world.

The movie, in spite of all of this, is a helluva a lot of fun to look at, and there are some satisfying moments here and there (including an amazingly choreographed fight scene/car chase). No actor really stood out, but then again, none of them were glaringly bad, either. However, unlike a magic show where they take great pains to roll up the sleeves and denounce camera or light trickery, this flick -- both the way it's filmed and told -- just feels like a lot of smoke and mirrors and not much else.

****

Four magicians, each with a very different shtick, (played by Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher (""Wedding Crashers"", ""The Lookout"") and Dave Franco (""Warm Bodies"", ""21 Jump Street"") receive Tarot cards directing them to a run-down apartment in Brooklyn. After a few moments of general confusion (""oh, you're here as well?"") they uncover the plans for an elaborate magic illusion. Fast forward and the group is now headlining in Vegas as The Four Horseman. Their sponsor, Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine) watches with disinterest from the audience. Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) and his assistant also sit quietly in the audience, filming the entire show; Thaddeus has made a career of debunking the claims and magic of popular acts. The group calls a random audience member to the stage and manages to transport him, to the interior of his bank's vault, in Paris, where he grabs millions of euros just before they begin to rain down on the audience in Vegas. Enter reluctant FBI Agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) who is called in to investigate. But the Four Horsemen are quickly released and move on to their next venue, New Orleans and their next illusion.

Thus begins ""Now You See Me"", a very fast-paced, well-made caper film directed by Louis Letterier (""The Transporter"", ""Taken"") and written by Ed Solomon and Boaz Yakim. ""See Me"" is a fun, easy to watch film perfect for the summer popcorn crowd.  The film is not without problems; there are a few too many third act plot twists which aren't established enough to connect to the rest of the story. While this does detract from the overall effort, the rest of the film is good enough to help you overlook this.

""See Me"" is also a very slick film, which is both good and bad. As the narrative barrels along, it keeps us interested, but it doesn't provide a lot of time for character development. As each of the characters is introduced, we get a brief moment showing us a little of their lives, but that is pretty much it. J. Daniel Atlas (Eisenberg) is in Vegas captivating a crowd of pretty young women; he is putting the moves on one of the girls in his swanky bachelor pad when he realizes he has the Tarot card. Merritt McKinney (Harrelson) is doing hypnosis tricks at Caf du Monde in New Orleans when he gets his card. Henley Reeves (Fisher) is performing an elaborate escape act, complete with a straitjacket and piranhas, in a Los Angeles club. Jack Wilder (Franco) is doing cheap tricks for a group of tourists on a New York ferry, trying to scam them out of a tenner. When they initially meet at the address in Brooklyn, we learn some know each other, some have heard of others, but that is it. When they uncover the secret plans, they are captivated and the narrative shifts forward a year and we rejoin them as the Four Horsemen.

Interpol agent Alma Dray (Melanie Laurent, ""Inglourious Basterds"") enters the picture after the illusion involving the French bank and tags along with Dylan. But they always seem to be one step behind the clever magicians.

Letterier, the director of ""Clash of the Titans (2010)"", ""The Incredible Hulk (2008)"" and ""The Transporter"" films is a director who seems intent on creating summer popcorn films, films filled with fast-paced action, lots of special effects and little or no character development. ""The Transporter"" films were a blast, but since then Letterier has had difficulty finding the right balance. In ""Now You See Me"", the director uses great CGI to almost convince us the magicians are performing real illusions. Unfortunately, because the CGI is so good, it isn't believable. And the late-in-the-narrative explanation of how the magic was possible just doesn't cut it either.

In ""See Me"", Letterier seems to have found the right vehicle for his limited storytelling skills. I only wish he had been able to create a little bit of character development, fleshing out the performances to make them more interesting. In a way, because the production values are so high, the lack of character development is more noticeable and makes the film seem unbalanced and the experience seem hollow. Learning something, anything about them would forge a stronger connection with the viewer and make us care about them just a little more. Note to all filmmakers; even the smallest amount of character development will improve your film immensely.

Generally, if we don't learn specifically about the characters, their actions and the plot will lead us to learn something about them. But the four magicians are following a detailed set of instructions and seem clueless as to their purpose or the final outcome. So, that doesn't work either.

Rhodes (Ruffalo) is reluctantly paired with Alma. As they chase the magicians, we see a relationship building between them, but this is the only one in the entire film. And they aren't the central characters - I'm not sure anyone could be considered the star, there are too many people running around, playing a part  - so it seems odd to be given more information about these characters than others.

My biggest problem with ""See Me"" is there are too many third-act plot twists. The key to a good plot twist is there needs to be a subtle hint or connection to something we have witnessed earlier. The best plot twists involve something you have seen, but no longer remember. When the twist happens, a light goes off in your head. ""Oh, yeah."" In ""See Me"", there just aren't connections to the many, many twists. If they are there, they are too subtle. Because these moments seem to simply materialize out of thin air, the movie's credibility wanes and wobbles and quickly devolves into a bad episode of ""Murder She Wrote"".

I know the problems don't really seem small or insignificant, but when weighed against the overall effect of the entire film, they seem to be less important. Maybe Letterier has created an illusion of his own?

""Now You See Me"" is a fun bit of fantasy, perfect to help you make a few hours disappear.

5523029,2,B00AW9M8N6,"When a magician performs a trick, it has to work perfectly. We have to trust we've been shown everything that the magician is doing in order for the trick to leave us stunned. When a talented magician fumbles a part of a trick, we usually don't notice unless he stops and informs us of that. When a team of magicians performs a trick, the need for accuracy increases exponentially. Since Now You See Me is structured like a high-level magic trick, it's hard to know exactly what goes wrong.

 David Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher), Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson), and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco), all talented amateur magicians, find mysterious tarot cards inside their performance equipment. When they meet at the address on the back of the tarot they presumably receive some sort of instruction, because after the title card they're known as ""The Four Horsemen"" and they're playing a packed stadium show in Las Vegas.
They bring a volunteer on stage and have him rob a bank on the other side of the world. This sequence is shot remarkably, easily and effectively conveying the excitement of big, live magic. And it appears they actually did rob the bank, which of course gains them a spot on the FBI's and Interpol's most wanted lists. Their interrogation at the hands of Agent Rhodes (Mark Rufallo) is a much more intimate affair, but it's just as exciting as the grand magic show. During the interrogation, these characters are fantastically interesting, and we can't wait to spend the rest of this movie with them. But it's all an illusion. After their interrogation, the magic nearly dies, and the magicians behind the camera lose focus. In this trick, though, the problem is not the perfectly shuffled deck of leading characters. They are cast perfectly and they work very well together. The fault is that of one of the magicians.

 Is it the director? Louis Leterrier has proven himself adept with action with the first two Transporter movies and The Incredible Hulk. When action takes to the screen, it shines. One scrape between Jack Wilder and Agent Rhodes showcases Jack's talents as an illusionist, and produces one of the most exciting and dynamic fight scenes ever filmed. But when we need to get closer what this movie is actually about, he doesn't quite know where to put us.

 Could it be the screenwriters? Newcomer Edward Ricourt is credited with the story, as is Boaz Yakin (Prince of Persia). Ed Solomon (Men in Black) joined them to write the screenplay. It's not difficult to imagine these men embroiled in a tug-of-war over what is most important, or necessary at all, to the story. By the time we reach New Orleans and the Horsemen have robbed their benefactor (Michael Caine) who, abra-cadabra, owns an insurance company that didn't pay victims of hurricane Katrina and has a rivalry with a magic-debunking genius (Morgan Freeman), who is working with Agent Rhodes, who has fallen in love with the Interpol agent (Melanie Laurent), there are already way too many plot holes and unnecessary distractions than the movie could ever hope to explain.

 But of course all of this buildup is leading to a grand flourish or huge twist that none of us saw coming, right? It does. A very surprising, but unfortunately completely unsatisfying one. Almost as surprising and unsatisfying as closing with this: ""Despite all that, it's actually a great movie. Everything was in service of a brilliant, satisfying, totally necessary and believable conclusion.""

  If that were the case, this review would end up just like the movie: nonsensical, intentionally misleading and entirely uncalled for.",1374019200,7,3631,4.9555921052631575

Jack (Dave Franco) uses his slight of hand to pick pocket people.

The four are summoned by Tarot cards (Lover, High Priestess, The Fool, and Death) to a common location. After the credits they become the world's greatest stage magicians while performing crime. They are followed by FBI Dylan (Mark Ruffalo) and Interpol Alma Dray (M&eacute;lanie Laurent). Meanwhile Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) is exposing their seemingly impossible tricks on the Internet.

5523031,3,B00AW9M8N6,"Now You See Me (Louis Leterrier, 2013)

The last time Louis Leterrier and Morgan Freeman got together to make a movie, the result was 2005's Danny the Dog, released in America as Unleashed. It's widely (if you define ""widely"" as ""critical reaction as measured by both Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes and public reaction as measured by IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes"") considered Leterrier's best movie by a country mile (as of this writing), and this reviewer is not inclined to disagree; I adore Danny the Dog something fierce, and much of Leterrier's other work (two films in the Transporter franchise and remakes of The Incredible Hulk and Clash of the Titans) are epitomes of the brainless action film; what sets Danny the Dog apart is its fearsome intelligence. And when I saw a trailer for Now You See Me and noticed it was directed by Leterrier, I had hopes that same intelligence would be back, and so I wandered out to see it despite it having a trio of my least favorite actors currently working in Hollywood all in starring roles: Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, and Mark Ruffalo. And even there, there was a mitigating factor: the one time I have so far been able to stand Jesse Eisenberg on a screen was in Zombieland, and his co-star there was Harrelson, turning in his best role since Natural Born Killers. Whaddya know?

Sadly, the high hopes I had were not all realized, though I in no way mean to imply that Now You See Me is not Leterrier's best flick since Danny the Dog. It is that, and it manages to be a slick, fun little heist film despite some woeful casting choices and a script (penned by Boaz Yakin, responsible for such timeless classics of motion pictures as Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money and Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights) that managed to avoid any semblance of character development. If Leterrier has re-teamed with Luc Besson, who wrote Danny the Dog, they might have come up with a movie just as good.

Plot: as we begin, four street magicians, Daniel Atlas (Eisenberg), his former assistant Henley Reeves (Wedding Crashers' Isla Fisher), mentalist Merritt McKinney (Harrelson) and grifter/prestidigitator Jack Wilder (Warm Bodies' David Franco), finish up various performances and discover tarot cards with a date, time, and address in New York City. When they get to the apartment, they find, in the words of a famous space traveller, ""something wonderful."" Fast-forward a year later, and the four of them are now known as the Four Horsemen, slick TV magicians headlining Vegas, looking like run-of-the-mill David Copperfield wannabes until the final trick of one performance, where they appear to rob a bank... and when the folks at the bank (located in Paris) open the vault, well, 3.2 million Euros has vanished into thin air. Needless to say, this draws the attention of the Las Vegas PD, in the form of Dylan Rhodes (Ruffalo), who quickly finds himself paired with a gorgeous Interpol agent from Pairs, Alma Dray (Inglorious Basterds' Mlanie Laurent). The Horsemen left some clues to their next performance, to be held in New Orleans three days hence; can Rhodes and Laurent, with the reluctant help of professional debunker Thaddeus Bradley (Freeman), head off the Horsemen and their millionaire backer Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine)?

When the movie is good, it is very, very good. It's beautifully shot, and I'm intrigued by the fact that what should have been perfectly standard thriller shots seemed like they shouldn't have been in this flick and were thus a surprise (for example, the rooftop of a building in New York City; how many thrillers have you seen that in? And yet it seemed brand new here; much credit to co-DPs Mitchell Amundsen and Larry Fong). That takes some doing, and it's more impressive than the movie's magic tricks. Woody Harrelson turns in his most affable performance since Zombieland, and I almost, almost didn't hate Mark Ruffalo. Now that takes some doing. On the other hand, Jesse Eisenberg has made himself a career, rather like Tom Cruise did, of getting up on a screen and playing Jesse Eisenberg. (I am still convinced the only reason he was so good in Zombieland is because the screenwriter wrote the character specifically for him.) There's  enough good acting here to balance out Eisenberg, but he's still annoying. So maybe the complete and utter lack of character development that I think has been addressed in every review written on this movie to date is actually a good thing; if this script had tried to delve into Eisenberg's character, we may have gotten more of him. ** ",1373068800,3,4562,4.872422680412371

This alone is worth the price of admission, but the movie centers on how these four charlatans become the super star four horsemen who use their magic to rob banks.  How do they do it?  The twist of course is they never actually rob anyone -- or do they?  The FBI pursues them as bank robbers but they use magic to keep ahead of the authorities.  Morgan Freeman does an excellent job as an iconolast determined to expose them and show their magic is really just tricks.

5523050,4,B00AW9M8N6,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

As the credits started rolling at the end of Now You See Me there was one feeling that overwhelmed all others, the feeling of being misled. The promotional trailers all lead you to believe that the film is going to be about one thing, but in reality it's about something else entirely. I don't know why, but it just left a bad taste in my mouth. The more I thought about it the more I felt like Now You See Me just didn't live up to its full potential.

That's not to say that it's a bad movie, though. On the contrary, Now You See Me manages to keep you entertained for majority of its lengthy two hour running time. What got to me, though, was that you see very little of what I thought were the four leads: J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson), Henly Reeves (Isla Fisher), and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco). Instead, a lot of focus is put on Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) and Alma Vargas (Melanie Laurent).

That's where I think they kind of lost me. I think Louis Leterrier wanted to take this movie in a different direction than what most people are expecting and it's going to have a lot of people leaving disappointed. Instead of focusing on these four magicians and the repercussions of robbing a bank, they tried to create some convoluted plot that revolves around who got these four together and why (s)he is asking them to do these things in the first place. Which is fine, but don't advertise the movie as one thing only to have a completely different set-up.

Still, I must admit that even with the somewhat lackluster plot I was impressed by how well they covered every little detail. Usually movies like this leave some major plot-holes or a group of unanswered questions, but every question in Now You See Me gets answered by the end of the movie. Which was nice because as the movie was progressing I said to myself, ""So we're just going to forget that this happened? We're not going to discuss this any further?"", but, thankfully, everything got covered eventually. This also allowed the audience to feel like every little detail in the plot was important because, in the grand scheme of things, they were.

What annoyed me the most, however, was the inclusion of an extremely out-of-place romantic side story between Rhodes and Vargas. Some movies call for these things while others, like this one, don't. The relationship is just completely unnecessary and it does nothing substantial to help progress the plot. Vargas' involvement in the story as a whole was slightly significant, but the little romantic tension just felt tacky and forced. Note to any aspiring film directors/writers: Not every film needs romance! In fact, some films will wind up better without any romance at all, Now You See Me being a prime example of this.

Perhaps this film's strongest attribute is its cast. You have an all-star lineup consisting of Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Morgan Freeman, and Woody Harrelson. Four fantastic actors who deliver once again by giving the audience an engaging and fun performance. Then you have Michael Cain with a pretty minor role and Dave Franco with what's probably his first really big role. Out of everyone involved Franco in particular stood out the most to me. I've grown to love Eisenberg over the years, Harrelson is always a blast, and you can never go wrong with Freeman, but Franco just knocked it out of the park in this movie. Still, I wish that he, along with the other three magicians, received more screen time. The four of them had fantastic chemistry that was never really utilized.

Finally, the film's score, composed by Brian Tyler, leaves a lot to be desired. In terms of the film itself it does its job, but as a standalone score it does nothing new or inventive. In fact, almost every piece I heard in this movie felt like a rip-off of some other big budget action film. There was no originality, no creativity, and, most importantly, it just lacked its own identity. Probably one of the weakest and most generic film scores I've heard in quite some time.

Overall Score: 7/10 - I think my main issue with this film is that I felt duped. The magic was nice and it was cool to see them break it down and show you just how ""real"" magic is, but beyond that the experience as a whole just felt underwhelming. I wanted to be taken to amazing places and I wanted to be wowed, but at the end of it all I was just left with the feeling of ""meh"". So it didn't live up to my expectations, and that's ok, but if you felt even the slightest bit interested after seeing the trailers then I recommend you give it a shot. It's a nice ride from start to finish, but don't expect to be blown away by the experience.",1370304000,2,4737,4.577830188679245

So, I figured that would be the case for the movie because that was a brilliant piece of editor magic at work in that particular shot.  I was wrong.

""Now You See Me"" starts off introducing us to four different magicians, two are well known, one is on her way up and one uses his skills as a common street thief. Together, they are brought to a locked room in a dingy hotel by a mysterious benefactor and coaxed to become a team in order to achieve a certain goal. That goal is a mystery to us as is most of the movie. The movie then cuts to just a year later and the four magicians have become the Four-horsemen, a daring magician team that quickly becomes the talk of the world after just their first show.

Now I'm not gonna go into any more details about the movie because that is all the fun. Just like any magic trick, you don't want to know how it was done, you want to see it for yourself and figure it out for yourself. That is what I truly liked about ""Now You See Me"". The movie itself is a magic trick. It doesn't rely on unexplained special effects. In fact, they explain nearly every single trick in the movie and how it was done. That adds to the quality of the movie because even though they are telling you how tricks are done, you are only enlightened for a few moments before the next trick occurs and you try to figure out that one as well.

""Now You See Me"" is gonna be a sneak hit in my opinion. As time goes by, this movie will have life. In fact, as word of mouth gets out, this movie will have a steady pace of success before it gets swallowed up by the Summer movie tidal wave. Don't be mistaken though, if you like movies that are intelligent and challenging, ""Now You See Me"" is your kind of movie. With a great cast of Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Morgan Freeman, Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson and Michael Caine, this movie is gifted with great actors, working from an intelligent script that will keep you guessing. Despite all that, it will most likely slip through the cracks of all the mindless Summer movies that are on the way, so go see it before it disappears.",1370304000,3,2577,4.3625

I won't give away details, but ""nothing is what it seems""; and who does not love to be fooled every now and then and still have a great feeling when the credits show up? That is what this movie is: a great plot, interesting characters, funny dialogues, and one big misdirection....",1370304000,12,436,4.329268292682927
5523053,5,B00AW9M8N6,"""Now You See Me"" tells the story of a group of magicians called The Four Horsemen who use their skills to pull off some of the greatest international robberies of their generation. Featuring Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Merritt McKenny (Woody Harrelson), Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher) and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco), the Four Horsemen make a dream team of street magicians. Since they have made their stunts public, allowing the world to ""witness"" the robberies, authorities are in hot pursuit of the four, now wanted criminals. Detective Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) is accompanied in his search for the illusive magicians by Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) and French detective Alma Dray (Melanie Laurent). Will the Four Horsemen be able to pull of their final act without being caught, or will it be curtains for the criminal performers? Our KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, Raven D, raved about this film. See her review below.

I absolutely love this film. ""Now You See Me"" is like nothing I've ever seen before. The plot is so original and full of fresh ideas and witty comedy. I love how fast paced this film is, I swear there isn't a dull moment from beginning to end. The plot itself has so many twists and turns it should be a pretzel, but it keeps the audience guessing the whole time and hits you with major shock factor. The acting in this film is incredible. It features a group of incredible actors - Morgan Freeman, Jesse Eisenberg, Dave Franco, Woody Harrelson and many others. I love how each character has a unique quirk and personality that you can really see, but they all work together so well. The cinematography and special effects in this film are phenomenal. It is bursting with rich colors and textures, drawing you into the magic and making the illusions appear so real. The soundtrack is also amazing. It is suits each scene very well, while keeping a consistent theme and feel throughout the movie. ""Now You See Me"" is definitely not one to miss.

It's hard for me to pick a favorite character because I love all of the Horsemen, but when it comes down to it I have to say I like the characters Daniel Atlas and Jack Wilder. Daniel, played by Jesse Eisenberg, often tries to assert himself as the head of the Four Horsemen. He is controlling, very specific and difficult to deal with, but he is also the funniest character which is attributed to all of his demanding qualities. I love every film Jesse Eisenberg is in and I think he is perfect for the role of Daniel Atlas. I also like Jack Wilder, played by Dave Franco, because he is the craftiest of the magicians. He isn't the ""card trick"" or ""read your mind"" type, he's just a good old fashioned pick-pocket for whom no door is ever locked.. He is sort of the ""muscle"" to the operation because he is able to help the horsemen get out of tight situations and he is also very funny.

My favorite scene is when the Four Horsemen have to escape from the FBI after their second robbery. Jack Wilder has to stay behind to burn secret files. When he has an unexpected run-in with Detective Rhodes, an action filled fight sequence and high speed chase follow. This scene is filled with suspense, action and incredible stunts and it shows that the Horsemen are always two steps ahead.

I recommend this film for ages 12+ because of violence and mild mature language. Overall I give ""Now You See Me"" 5 out of 5 stars.",1370217600,8,3379,4.626666666666667

8558245,2,B00AW9M8N6,"Style far over substance; unfortunately, it's not exceptionally stylish either, and far less entertaining than such a slight movie with a potentially intriguing premise should be. What moves it from three to two stars for me is the sense I had of being ""cheated"". If you're going to make a film about magic tricks and you're going to use them as plot devices, then you should make the execution of the tricks plausible enough that there is a satisfying answer to how the tricks are done. As audience, we are expected to believe these magicians are so exceptional at their craft that they can do impossible things, but unlike a magic show where the trick is not revealed and you are left wondering but satisfied, in this case the lack of explanation for the frankly impossible things they do simply feels like lazy writing, a perpetual deus ex machina instead of putting in the effort to contrive some really interesting puzzles and solutions.",1530403200,,942,4.785276073619632
