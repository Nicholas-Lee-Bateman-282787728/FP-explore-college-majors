490609,5,6302642019,"This is an excellent, beautiful Italian movie. In 4 different parts, which are movies on their own, the Taviani-brothers tell the gripping, sometimes hilarious stories of Italian fellowmen from their history and from present times. Stunning landscapes, rich colours, excellent acting and mere suspense make this movie to one of the tops of Italian filmhistory. For me it is already a classic and the best untill now of the highly talenhted Taviania-brothers. Go, and see.",1001721600,4,471,5.293333333333333
490630,5,6302642019,You can't help but fall in love with all the shortcomings of human nature which is what makes humans lovable after all. This is a film that almost reads like a book with moving photographs. The Taviani brothers (or Pirandello for that matter) do not need my review to do them justice. Their work speaks for itself. MUST SEE!,1304985600,,324,4.508474576271187

The information given in the web is: 188 minutes. The truth about the DVD is: only 105 minutes! Very disapointing!!! The online-shop didn't answer any questions about it!!",1302134400,9,255,4.688888888888889
490632,5,6302642019,"I guess this film is the first or second best film of Taviani brothers.
Luigi pirandello is one of very important writer of twentieth century. And the film includes his five stories.
Pirandello's stories are deep, touching and emotional. I read many of them becaus of this film.
So, This film let me known the writer. Before this film, I did not know about Luigi pirandello.
If you can get one of his books, you must read his stories. He is one of the king of short stories like Checkov.
He is a big man has written about light and darkness.

490633,5,6302642019,KAOS was the first film I ever saw that made a huge impact on me as a teenager and it was wonderful to find it and watch again twenty years later and appreciate the depth of the story and characters.

490635,5,6302642019,"Just to correct the mistake by a previous reviewer, the DVD contains the full-length uncut 188-minute film.  It is a brand new digitally-restored transfer made especially for the Koch Lorber Films DVD release and looks great.",1210636800,15,225,5.25
490636,1,6302642019,"According to the product information on Amazon, this DVD lasts 105 minutes.  It must be the butchered version of this more than three hour masterpiece.  I hope I am wrong, for this is one of my all-time favorite movies.  I have seen the shortened version in a theatre; it was sickening to realize how they had cut the heart out of some sequences.",1208736000,5,346,4.4603174603174605
490637,5,6302642019,"Few filmakers around the world have been able to transcript with such precision and profundity of spirit the legacy of Luigi Pirandello.

This film is composed by four stories of this monumental writer. And the final result could not be more fortunate. The bitter cynicism of some characters, the fragile human condition and the cosmic poetry were exposed with impeccable plasticity through a fluid camera work.

You should not miss for any reason, this emblematic and superb feat of the cinema.",1163376000,3,495,5.098765432098766
490638,4,6302642019,"I watched Kaos last night for my Italian Culture class. There are 4 parts but the first 3 struck me particularly. The first one ""L'otro Figlio"" or ""The Other Son"" was a sad story but I really liked it. The main character for this segment, Mariagracia, gave a riveting performance.

The second story ""Mal di Luna"" or ""Moon Sickness"" is a werewolf story. This is where the movie starts to get a bit bizarre. Newlyweds Sidora and Bata live in the sicilian countryside and every full moon, Bata is enchanted by the moon and it rules him. He howls and barks like a wolf and it causes him great pain. Sidora totally freaks out and doesn't stand by him at all...

The third story ""La Giara"" or ""The Jar"" is extremely bizarre but I found it entertaining. This guy named Don Lollo who looks like what Mick Jagger would look like if he were an Italian man, acquires this huge clay jar that the town will put olive oil in. One night they come out and it's broken into 2 pieces. As a result, Don Lollo hires this eccentric potter to come fix this jar with his ""magic glue"" After a long series of events, the mad potter gets stuck inside the jar. It ends up being pretty funny...

All in all, I liked it. I think the editing between stories could've used a little work, but overall I thought the settings seemed very realistic. I really like the creative shots that the movie had. Most of the people seem like real sicilian people, not just random actors.

4 out of 5",1103846400,4,1454,4.334558823529412
490639,5,6302642019,"Produced by Raitelevisione Italiana, this film set in Sicily and directed by brothers Paolo and Vittorio Taviani, consists of four stories based on Luigi Pirandello's ""Le Novelle per un Anno"", and has some spectacular cinematography by Giuseppe Lanci and a gorgeous score by Nicola Piovani.
The first two stories in particular, take place in a parched, rocky setting, that has a strange beauty despite the dust and the cruelty of the life; life is harsh, and so is the way some of the characters treat each other. A warning to those of you, who like me are sensitive about the abuse of animals, the initial scene of the film with a crow is a little unpleasant.
The stories are:  ""L'Altro Figlio"" (The Other Son), about a mother with two sons in America, and one that she has at home, but has rejected.
""Mal di Luna"" (Moon Sickness), about a man who goes wild and howls when the moon is full, and his new wife.
""La Giara"" (The Jar), which is a comedic story about an oil jar ""as wide as an abbess"".
""Requiem"", is about a community of shepherds who challenge the town leader for land rights, to bury their dead.
the film ends with a lovely epilogue, ""Colloquio con la Madre"" (Conversing with Mother). Omero Antonutti plays Pirandello, and Regina Bianchi as his mother, with a scene on an island of pumice that is exquisite.
The ensemble cast is wonderful, with some members appearing in more than one story. Among the many fine actors are: Massimo Bonetti, Claudio Bigagli, Erica Maria Modugno, Franco Franchi, and Ciccio Ingrassia.
Just over 3 hours long, some may find this film slow, but if you are willing to immerse yourself in its unique atmosphere, you will be greatly rewarded.",1045612800,21,1683,4.6858108108108105

7828814,5,6302642019,Pirandello was a literary genius and it took me  a long time to believe that someone could pick up some of his work best pieces and make such a wonderful movie.

the Taviani brothers could make you truly smell the perfume of a lemon, a Sicilian lemon, just picked? I adore this film of
just four stories from a collection of over 200 by the great writer and Nobel Prize Luigi Pirandello. If you who are reading

7828820,5,6302642019,"Watch this film once and you may or may not like it.  Watch it multiple times, over a period of years, and you may find that you understand the human condition just a tad more broadly and more deeply that you ever would have imagined.

It is a true gem.  And, although I am not educated in these matters, I think that the film's director, actors, and writers really understood the essence of what Pirandello was trying to say.

Ultimately the film depicts neither one specific time nor one specific place for it transcends both.  This is a collection of stories about those who move forward and those who stay behind, true love, what privilege can't buy, and what cunning-born-of-a-sense-of-fairness can.  And more than this, it is about how much of ourselves stems from the people we have known.  Even when we can't remember their names, we understand their struggles and triumphs and, in remembering them, we find ourselves.

One of my top 10 films of all times.  As a point of reference, a few others are ""A Man for All Seasons,"" ""Crash,"" ""The Right Stuff,"" and ""Grand Canyon.""  An odd mix, I agree:-)",1368576000,,1104,4.644329896907217

7828822,5,6302642019,"Luigi Pirandello (1867-1936) was actually born in a village named Kaos, in the region of Agrigento in Sicily. Many of his novels and novellas portrayed Kaos the village as perceptively as they portrayed Chaos, the normal state of society in post-unification Italy. Pirandello is best known to anglophones as a dramatist, the Godfather of the ""theater of the absurd"" and thus one of the progenitors of 'magic realism' in Latin America and elsewhere. But his prose is truly extraordinary, even in translation.

This cinematic Kaos converts four of Pirandello's short stories into four short films and an epilogue, connected only a symbolic crow in flight over the landsacpe of Sicily. The aerial photography of that landscape is stunningly beautiful, almost enough to qualify the film as a travelogue, but the film is in effect as much about Luigi Pirandello as it is about village life in Kaos at the end of the 19th C. Purely as cinema, it reminds me of the superb Japanese film Kwaidan, which also combined four ghost stories from the works of Lafcadio Hearne into a totality that exceeded any of the parts and that depicted the 'spirit' of the author throughout. Pirandello is portrayed in person in the 'Epilogue' to Kaos, but it's his fascination with his homeland that animates each of his stories and each of the episodes of the movie adaptation.

I admired this film quite a lot, and I might have spilled more words over it in this review, but I've discovered -- to my horror -- that this edition is abridged! Almost a third of the original has been cut! Now I'll have to find a release of the whole thing and watch it again! But that's a testimonial, isn't it, to my appreciation even for this abridgment.",1323043200,,1713,4.764309764309765
