6958699,5,B00S4YGWAQ,"I found the pilot movie to SSD to be the best of all shows.  It is too bad it is not on the dvd.  Hope they will consider putting it out on dvd.  Like many I don't have Directv HD channels. Nor, being retired on social security, can I afford them.  I feel Hallmark is losing some of its fan base.",1427846400,20,296,3.80327868852459
6958700,5,B00S4YGWAQ,"I loved this series on Hallmark Channel and was upset to find out that it was discontinued.  My understanding is that the series has moved to a movie format and is being shown on Hallmark's second channel - Hallmark Movies and Mysteries.  Unfortunately, I didn't find out in time to see the first movie released (around Christmas 2014), so will be purchasing the movie on DVD.  I don't watch the second channel and didn't see any advertisements on the regular Hallmark Channel, so will have to keep a keen eye on their website for news of new movies.

In the one and only season of the show, we are introduced to Oliver O'Toole (Eric Mabius) who is the head of a group who tries to keep items in the mail from ending up in the dead letter files.  They are a group of individuals who work, or rather, have a calling for finding out where undeliverable mail should have been delivered.  Along with Oliver, is Norman Dorfman (Geoff Gustafson) a kind of ninja sleuth on all things undeliverable, Rita Haywith  (Crystal Lowe) a sweetie and expert on postal codes and procedures and who has a photographic memory, and Shane McInerney (Kristin Booth) the girl from the big city with advanced technical skills who has a potentially great career ahead of her in the postal service and just may have been mis-assigned to the group.

Along with the group, there is a rolling series of well-known stars who manage or have direct influence on their group - they seem to be there for a few shows before they move on.  They include Valerie Bertinelli, Valerie Harper, and Carol Burnett.

I was so pleased to find Eric Mabius in a great role after watching and enjoying him in ""Ugly Betty"".  He has been a favorite of mine including a couple of Hallmark movies.  The ensemble cast works great together.  Oliver is a little straight-laced and oddly formal, Shane is a breath of fresh air and ideas while bringing a bit of modern techniques to the group.  Norman is sweet but oblivious to most of what is going on in the world including the huge crush Rita has for him.  Rita is a real fun character.  She remembers everything and absolutely adores Norman.  She thinks the best of everyone and everything and is incredibly modest about herself.  The shows revolve around these characters and who they are and how they work together.

The mis-directed mail always has a story about it - sometimes funny, sometimes heart-rending but always a pleasure to watch.  I will certainly be keeping up with the movie series and hope that the show will continue on in that format for a good while.  It is a fun show and a good one to watch with the whole family.",1426636800,45,2632,4.569296375266524
6958701,4,B00S4YGWAQ,"Unfortunately, this show has NOT been renewed as a TV series. It WILL however continue in movie form. The first movie aired on November 23, 2014, and the next will air in June on ""Hallmark Movies & Mysteries"" channel.
Walmart is now releasing the movies on dvd (except the pilot movie), so if you don't have the ""HM&M"" channel, check there.  If you can't buy the dvd, you may also want to check your local library for rentals of these discs!**
_________

This was the third original TV series from the ""Hallmark"" channel.  Being I really enjoyed their second series-- ""When Calls the Heart"" (returning April 25)-- a period drama with the same message & values as ""S,S,D"". I was willing to give it a view.

I strongly recommend watching the pilot movie before diving into the series (this complete series doesn't appear to include this, due to the total time on this set, the movie is around 89 min's long).  My suggestion would be to ask Hallmark if they're going to release the pilot separately, and also request it to be released on single disc or online stream.
 I actually didn't beforehand, and felt a little lost at first.  Although I eventually did, and found the movie to be quite enjoyable!

I like the fact that each episode has a completely new story to enjoy, and mystery to solve. It's a light hearted sort of detective show, not bogged down by crime, and death. Also, there's a new guest star every 2 episodes; such as Carol Burnett, Valerie Harper, Valerie Bertinelli, etc.-- which make things interesting!

However, I do feel there's room to grow and improve in this series, so I'll give it 4 stars for now. It's just too bad we have to wait so long for the movies.  For up to date info, check the official ""Signed, Sealed, Delivered"" Facebook page.

**UPDATE**:
-The pilot movie is now on presale on FishFlix.  And marked available ""September 29th (2015)"".  But I don't see any sign of a release for their 2nd (after series) movie ""S,S,D: From Paris with Love"" (that aired on HMM channel recently).
-The 3'd (after series) movie will premier September 13, 2015; its title is ""S,S,D: Truth Be Told"" (keep checking the HMM website for the time, and further dates).",1425772800,74,2191,4.65974025974026

Wish I'd known about this series much sooner than just this past January (2018).  But I didn't have cable TV until last August (2017), and missed most of the January 2018 marathon, except for 'Higher Ground"" and ""The Road Less Traveled"".  If you think nothing could be better than ""Touched By An Angel"", I can highly recommend ""Signed, Sealed, Delivered"" ... and that's coming from someone who isn't a Christian, but a Theist (*not* an atheist).

I guess they want people to join the new Hallmark monthly membership to be able to see them.  I was glad to be able to purchase all of the episodes for ten dollars; it was worth it.  I know some people had problems with viewing quality but I did not.

Some people don't like it's simplicity and innocence, but I find it refreshing in today's culture.  One of the best programs was about a military mom who had disappeared in Afghanistan, and fellow students mocked her daughter for tying a yellow ribbon on the tree in their front yard.  Everyone thought the mom was dead, but the rescue coordinated by the ""Postables"" in conjunction with the military was riveting--and a tear-jerker.",1522022400,,533,4.9

Although the operation of the group breaks from the reality of the post office, the personal interactions are what make the show. They're not afraid to mention God and they never make fun of solid morals. It is excellent family entertainment with a good message in each episode.

Episode 5 on the series is by far my favorite and very, very sad. I can't believe how i went from one extreme to the other on this show in 1 episode. i love it and look forward to watching it whenever it is on.

6958777,1,B00S4YGWAQ,"I only caught one show of the series during it's run but caught the movies made from the series and became a fan. I am very pleased to have the complete series. I have started to collect the ""made for tv movies"" starting w/ the Christmas dvd. My complaint is that the dvd's will hesitate for a second or two then start again. Sometimes where it left off other times a bit ahead. I know this because after watching the dvd over and over ( which I have a habit of doing ) it will pause again but not always in the same place.

This is an edited review. Amazon sent me a replacement video, but the replacement is worse than the original. The replacement does not stop then release and start again at the same point, it stops and starts but forward to a completely new scene and sometimes to the end
of the show.
Now I know some will think that it is my dvd player but I rarely watch regular tv I mostly watch dvd's, sometimes the same one over and over and I don't have this problem with any of my collection, only from the last two videos of the same series.

6958781,5,B00S4YGWAQ,"I really LOVE this television series.  It is well written and wholesome.  The cast has great chemistry and the episodes are well acted.  The storylines are engaging and I find myself rooting for the happy endings and crying for the sad endings.  It was a real shame when the tv series ended, but happily, periodic Made For TV Movie episodes are still being produced.

Im not sure why TV shows have descended to the level that we all too often see aired, and sometimes programs that are well meaning and wholesome are not always the best quality.  SIGNED, SEALED, DELIVERED has the best of both worlds - it is a first rate professionally done series, without the nasty underbelly that gives rise to some shows that dominate mainstream TV programming these days.

Highly enjoyable, entertaining and something you wouldnt be uncomfortable watching with your grandmother, your children or your pastor.

EDITED TO ADD:  Since another Amazon customer asked about closed captioning, I will add this comment about closed captioning on the DVD that I purchased:

Yes, the DVD does have a closed caption option. I don't know what SDH subtitles are, but the closed captions are large, clear and easy to read. Since I didn't watch the whole video with closed caption enabled, I am not sure if it is accurate throughout the whole DVD, but what I saw seemed perfect and easy to use.

The only thing that bothered me was that the captions are not at the bottom of the picture screen, but plastered in the middle of the screen so that it covers up some of the action of the film and sometimes it even covers the actors faces. It isn't too bad, because the caption boxes are translucent and you can see through them. It is distracting, though.",1497139200,11,1726,4.682119205298013

6958783,1,B00S4YGWAQ,"I purchased this DVD series a few months ago, but just attempted to watch it today. There is a picture but NO SOUND! I have purchased more than a hundred DVD's in the past, and this has never happened before. And it's likely too late to return it. Lesson learned: Check the product right away? Do I dare order a replacement, or will the same thing happen again? I would have preferred to leave a rating of no stars, but that is not an option.",1495843200,3,442,4.211764705882353

They round out the foursome who make up the Postables.  These 1 hour shows are touching. They will make you laugh and cry all at the same time.

6958827,5,B00S4YGWAQ,My recent purchase turned out to be timely as HM&M played a marathon of the 2015 & 2016 movies ending with the 1st of 2017 a week after receiving Season 1. Haven't had any sound problems with Disc #2 as some have reported. I think for format of the individual moves is better than followed in Season 1.  I did see the original showing of the pilot yet would like the opportunity to purchase a DVD or a digital download even better. HM&M's web site say NO direct questions on the subject will be received and the property belongs to the distributor. If they continue with 3 movies a year I still be watching.

6958887,5,B00S4YGWAQ,"How lovely to have the first series of Signed, Sealed and Delivered. I have watched four in the series so far and enjoyed them as much as when it first showed on the Hallmark Channel. I love everything about SS&D, and what makes it extra special for me is the setting is in my hometown of Denver. I hope so much that I can purchase the pilot movie of the series, which is what got me hooked on this sweet series! And I am also HOPING that the second series can be purchased at some time in the future. Every time I watch SS&D it ""takes me away"".",1469232000,,545,4.055555555555555

There are too few good-quality shows on TV these days, thank goodness for shows and movies like this, and for Hallmark, for making wonderful shows like this one.  I HIGHLY recommend it!!  During the first few minutes or half-hour, it may seem a little too sappy, BUT, hang in there, it WILL prove to be worth it!!  The stories come full-circle and leave you with such a good feeling!  Love the characters, actors, and the writing!!!",1468972800,,496,4.776470588235294
6958890,1,B00S4YGWAQ,"Great series but Hallmark messed up the discs badly. For starters, they omit the start - episode 1 is not in the set, what the heck? So if you know the series then you can forgive this, but if you want to introduce someone new to this wonderful series, you will need to explain what and who and why. A real pain. And then you get episodes 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 on disc one and episodes 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 on disc two. No mention of episodes 12-14 in season one. Why would they take such a nice family friendly and well done series and pick it apart in dvd format? So sad.",1468540800,3,566,3.8461538461538463

6958897,5,B00S4YGWAQ,I am in love with this series. I was very disappointed when Hallmark canceled it and turned it into a movie series instead. They are positive and have touching stories. The corky characters have their own story lines that they provide you little pieces of in each episode and into the movie series.

Old fashion values which I grew up with and am still young enough to see the darling way the 21st century is blended to make several truly life lesson shows.

I'm dying to see the movies from 2015, and delighted to hear that there are four more movies ""ordered"" for 2016. The characters are quirky, funny, and lovable and the stories are all ultimately uplifting; mixing heartfelt drama with a great deal of clever dialog and genuine humor. The cherry on top and a unifying theme is the growing, unexpressed, and, ultimately, impossible attraction between the two leads. We learn in the prequel movie that he is determinedly faithful to the wife who deserted him, and the growing affection between him and his colleague is sweet and heartbreaking.",1448150400,12,662,5.08256880733945

6958983,2,B00S4YGWAQ,"NOTE: THIS REVIEW WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE POSTED UNDER THE ORIGINAL ""SIGNED, SEALED, DELIVERED"" MOVIE DVD...NOT UNDER ""THE ORIGINAL SERIES"" DVD.
I'd have to say that the picture quality of this dvd is below the quality of watching something in Standard Definition on a tv these days.  Somewhat grainy and fuzzy.  Definitely not an acceptable quality for a professionally produced and sold dvd...even a dvd produced in SD.  I truly have to say that the quality of this dvd made me search out the legitimacy of the seller and/or dvd company because I honestly thought that someone may have been making bootleg copies from a recording they made off of the tv.  Honestly!  I even contacted Amazon for them to send me another disc because I thought (and hoped) that I had received a dud copy!  Sadly, that wasn't the case.  Both copies have the same lower-than-SD quality.  Now I just have to decide if I'd rather have this blurry copy than not have one at all!  The interesting thing, though, is that I also purchased ""The Series"" dvd of this show and it seems to be a better quality than this dvd of the original movie...but they're both made by the same dvd company.  Makes me wonder why.  Did they accidentally used the wrong settings or were they cutting corners when ripping copies by using lower quality settings?
Since I haven't yet come across either an HD version on dvd or one produced by a different company (I had thought Hallmark would have it), I still have to decide whether or not to keep a fuzzy, grainy copy rather than have no copy at all.
I actually still have the movie on my dvr from tv (running out of dvr space, though!)...and am astounded at how better the picture quality is...on the tv recording!!  I really can't understand how any dvd for sale should ever be a worse quality than something recorded from cable/satellite!

Martha Williamson who wrote ""Touched by an Angel"" is also writing this series.  She has guest stars come in and this adds to the enjoyment.  Ms. Williamson reveals deep things about the characters in such a way that it feels real.

6959009,5,B00S4YGWAQ,"I bought the serie's ""pilot movie"" before ordering the series (this complete series doesn't include it).
I appreciate that each series' episode has a completely new--stand-alone---mystery story to enjoy.
It's a light 'n' breezy sort of detective show; no by crimes or murder! Also, there're new guest stars
every  couple episodes; such as Carol Burnett, Valerie Harper, Valerie Bertinelli, etcetera, which make
things more interesting... in an old-school, retro, '70s kind of way! Know what I mean, Vern?

Also recommended...
There's the original movie.
There's the Christmas movie.
Then, THESE, ten episodes.
The three follow-up movies---the series was NOT cancelled---was thought to be a better option than 8- or ten- episode seasons.
The--already aired [available at Wal*Mart?!] movies are:
* ""Signed, Sealed, Delivered: From Paris With Love""---- aired 6 JUN 2015
* ""Signed, Sealed, Delivered: Truth Be Told""--------------- aired13 SEP 2015

6959032,5,B00S4YGWAQ,"I watched this series when it aired and waited impatiently for it to be released on DVD. I pre-ordered it, but was out of town on business when it arrived. Due to life's circumstances, I didn't actually get around to watching it until a few weeks ago. Long after Amazon's 30 day return window. I was very unhappy to find out that there was no sound at the end of Disc 2, Episodes 3 and 5 and none during the credits at all. I had shared these with my mom and I knew what the endings were, but she was going, ""what did she say!"" The subtitles didn't work either. I called Amazon and explained the problem. They agreed that first several batches sent out had been defective (read other reviews) at no fault to the customer, but at the fault of the whomever produced these DVDs. They immediately shipped me out a new DVD set and sent me a prepaid return label. I'm happy to announce the new DVDs have been fixed! I'm extremely happy with the quality (would love to see these in Blu-Ray) and sound. Also, the original movie that started this all - which fans had hoped would be included and was not - is now available for pre-order and releases in September. The Christmas movie is already available to buy and we can hope they soon release the most recent movie (From Paris With Love) that aired last month on Hallmark Movies & Mysteries. Sadly, Hallmark has decided not to continue this as a series, but in movie installments. Hopefully, they will eventually change their mind and bring it back as a full series, as I think this is better than any of their other series, although I'm also a fan of When Calls the Heart.",1439856000,19,1617,4.3754152823920265

6959086,4,B00S4YGWAQ,"The Hallmark Channel, feeling its oats, has been gradually expanding its demesne, dipping its toe in the realm of the television series. Signed, Sealed, Delivered followed on the heels of Cedar Cove and When the Heart Calls and easily became my favorite of the bunch. I think I just like the premise better: that of an eccentric staff of postal detectives who attempt to deliver every piece of wayward mail.

I was stunned to learn that this won't continue on as a Hallmark weekly series. But I'll take what I can get, and so should you. Our postables have been shipped off to help anchor the programming of Hallmark's recently rebranded sister channel, Hallmark Movies & Mysteries (formerly the Hallmark Movie Channel). For its ""second season,"" Signed, Sealed, Delivered will broadcast as a string of four two-hour movies, with Signed, Sealed, Delivered for Christmas serving as the first movie and Signed, Sealed, Delivered: From Paris With Love as the second. No worries, both are excellent.

Shane McInerney (Kristin Booth) has come from Washington to become the U.S. Post Office's newest technical operations consultant. Seems like a fancy gig, except that a snafu deploys McInerney to the institution's most obscure division, Denver's Dead Letter Office. She rages and rants but is told it'll be six weeks before she could transfer out. So lump it, McInerney. Welcome to the Dead Letter Office - ""the last hope of the written word.""

There, she runs into and has immediate beef with Oliver O'Toole (Eric Mabius) who heads up the Dead Letter division. Oliver seems a stick in the mud. He pushes this old-school professorial look and exudes this earnest, buttoned-down persona. Oliver regards his job as a sacred covenant. He's a stickler for policy, keeps faith with the prime directive of reading only far enough so as to gather clues to direct the lost letter to its rightful destination. It's obvious that much of the coming story conflict will revolve around Oliver's insistence on sticking to the letter of the law versus McInerney's relish in, uh, pushing the envelope. Of course, that Oliver crams his fridge with Yoohoo bottles is a hint that he may, in fact, nurse an independent streak.

I thought the 2013 Hallmark movie was tremendous and had me hugely anticipating the ongoing TV series. And while the first episode (""Time to Start Livin'"") - about an old folks' home and an endangered child - was just okay, the second episode (""To Whom It May Concern"") threatened to crack my manly, stoic demeanor (I almost reached for a dang hankie). ""To Whom It May Concern"" was fantastic and so moving. It pushed all those sappy emotional buttons. In it, the postal detectives help an Afghanistan girl track down the American soldier who saved her life all those years ago.

I'm fascinated by the sleuthing process. There's very much a cold case element to their investigations. I love it whenever these postal detectives take a crack at an old, faded, mangled envelope and try to piece clues together.

Signed, Sealed, Delivered won't be up everyone's alley. It falls in with those uplifting 1980s and '90s shows like Highway to Heaven, Touched by an Angel, and The Equalizer (okay, maybe not The Equalizer). The sense of optimism and its old school wholesomeness may render it unpalatable fodder in this fast-moving, cynical age. But I'm down with it. There's a place for this show. It's a haven for when you need a time-out from the edgier, can't-watch-with-your-parents programming and from unsavory reality shows.

It's a solid cast. I'm loving the quirk of the Dead Letters staff, from the socially-embattled Norman Dorman (Geoff Gustafson) to Rita Haywith (Crystal Lowe), waif with the perfect recall. Valerie Harper guest stars for the first two episodes - she's a legendary supervisor, there to evaluate Oliver's on-the-job performance - but she's so over-the-top I don't mind that she's exited already. Still, I'm very much looking forward to guest star turns by Valerie Bertinelli, Carol Burnett, and Dick Van Dyke. There's the expected tension between the two leads, but I'm hoping they don't leap straight away into a romantic arc. I appreciate the occasional lyricism of the show, most of which is manifested thru Oliver's dialogue. I loved his voiceover monologue from the 2013 movie:

""Yes, the thoughtfully composed, well-considered, addressed, stamped, profesionally post-marked, and personally delivered letter is still the gold standard of human intercourse. God is in his universe, and all is right with the world.""",1433721600,2,4543,5.064171122994653

Primary cast is the team: Oliver O'Toole (Eric Mabius) leader, gentleman, proper grandson of a deceased letter carrier superstar; Shane McInerney (Kristin Bath) blonde bombshell with intelligence and computer savvy; Rita Haywith (Crystal Lowe) shy with a phototrophic memory; and funny guy Norman Dorman (Geoff Gustafson) orphan, demoted to ""dead letter"" due to ""special abilities"".

[3] Soulmates -A mountain rancher's letter blows out a truck window, his last attempt to locate his childhood friend and sweetheart. Della Reese is the new stricter Denver Main Branch Supervisor in eps 3&4.

I was excited to be able to see that they put all of the first season into one DVD and was so glad that they did.

Signed, Sealed, Delivered is a family friendly series that I definitely would recommend sharing with the whole family. There are great messages of friendship, faith and love which for me, as a parent, I would like my daughters to experience and see. The writing is the series is solid and the characters are memorable, quirky and lovable , yes, even Oliver OToole too.

My family are also mystery lovers so it was nice to have a new mystery that unfolds with each episode. The series does follow something of a sequential order, so I would recommend watching them as such, the mysteries are stand alone, so you can catch up if you get out of order as well.

All-in-all this was a wonderfully made family show and this DVD really captures this and shares it with all viewers. I highly recommend Signed, Sealed, Delivered to all of you!

It can be a little goofy and predictable...but I don't care.  Against my initial hesitation to watch it, this series has captured my heart.

I'm really upset with Hallmark for not renewing this as a series, but instead as an occasional 2-hour movie.  I know so many people that just love this show, how could Hallmark not see the value in this as a series??
