Kylie is a Koala who lives with her family in Australia. She is different from the other Koalas as she loves to sing. She is not sure if she should continue to be different or to sing. She meets up with others who love top sing, and stays true to her self. Eventually she is reunited with her family and all join in Kylie's Song.

Liner Notes - Sometimes a koala has to do what a koala has to do. That's what Kylie decides in this story that shows youngsters how important it is to develop their individual capabilities, since it is the differences among people that make them special. Born with a song in her heart, Kylie is at odds with the dictum that koalas are not supposed to sing. She soon learns that being different is lonely and hard, but she also discovers that conformity doesn't necessarily lead to contentment. With the encouragement of a dancing wallaby and a platypus who likes to drum, Kylie becomes the best singer she can be and earns the respect of all who hear her.
