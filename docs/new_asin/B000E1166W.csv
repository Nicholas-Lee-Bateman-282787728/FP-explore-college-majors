8103679,5,B000E1166W,"I've only seen the last portion of this video when I was visiting South Korea over the summer. NEPAL is directed by Park Chan-Wook (You may have heard of him from the Movie JSA: Joint Security Area), and tells the true story of a women named Chandra who loses your wallet and thus her identity while working in South Korea.

She is mistaken for a mentally challenged woman, and is thought to be Korean. The movie is short (28 minutes), but it goes over Chandra's life in facilities in South Korea for six and a half years, leading to her eventual return to Nepal. It highlights the struggle for foreign workers, and how they must cope with a different language and society.

This film identifies a lot problems within a homogeneous society like South Korea, and highlights some human rights issues.

I highly recommend this movie, I believe it's a captivating story.",1189296000,7,866,4.684210526315789
