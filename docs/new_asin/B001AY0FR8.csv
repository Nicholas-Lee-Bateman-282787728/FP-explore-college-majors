3473829,4,B001AY0FR8,"Released in 1984 and starring Linda Blair and John Vernon as Principal Underwood, Savage Streets has everything you can ask for in a cult movie; we got nudity, violence, girls fighting in the shower room, sleaze, bad 80s hairdos and a bad 80s soundtrack. By this time in Linda Blair's career it was a far cry from The Exorcist, which upon its release was hailed as a horror masterpiece. Though on the 2-disc SE DVD Linda Blair looks back fondly on Savage Streets, which is great to know.

Linda Blair plays Brenda and channels her inner Clint Eastwood and Charles Bronson as a vigilante out for revenge after the brutal gang rape of her sister Heather played by Linnea Quigley; Savage Streets is one of my favorite 80s exploitation flicks and like I said before this has everything one can ask for in a cult flick. While Savage Streets is violent it's actually kinda tame compared to other movies released about the same time. But fear not there is a good amount of violence, but it is light on gore, which I suppose is fine since we make up for that in full frontal nudity.

The screenplay written by Norman Yonemoto & Danny Steinmann and an un credited John Strong who also produced is exactly what you would expect from a movie of this kind. Obviously you should know this isn't gonna be an Oscar worthy script and I don't think we fans would have it any other way. The screenplay is filled with some truly memorable lines that the viewer will be quoting for years to come.

So how about we go over some of the truly brilliant lines from Savage Streets? Now there are many great lines in this movie, but these are probably my favorites.

First we have the classic line from Principal Underwood, You're a tough little B***h, aren't you? I like that. And who can forget the brilliant, Go F**k an Iceberg also provided by Underwood, you gotta love the great John Vernon.

Now as great as those lines were I think my favorite is from Linda Blair when she says to one of the bad guys; Too bad you're not double-jointed. Because if you were you'd able to bend over and kiss your own A** goodbye!

Now with dialogue like this how can one not just love Savage Streets? For better or worse Norman Yonemoto & Danny Steinmann and John Strong really created one of the ultimate cult classics to ever come out of the 80s. Savage Streets actually reminds me of another cult classic of the 80s Class of 1984, while a good movie I think Savage Streets was the better of the two.

Savage Streets was directed by Danny Steinmann who's probably best known to horror fans from directing the underrated Friday the 13th: A New Beginning. Steinmann is by no means a good director, but he is a director who knows how to deliver what the audience for these kinds of movies wants. He got his start with the porn flick High Rise, before moving to feature films and he only made 3 movies, but Savage Streets is his legacy.

This isn't the masterful directed epic vigilante movie, but Steinmann delivers with a good amount of nudity and violence and while the pacing can slightly lag in some areas, Steinmann fills the scenes with enough sleaze that any pacing problems are quite easy to overlook. The revenge scenes don't come into play until the final act and they are handled well and play out strong with some amazing lines provided by Linda Blair.

The villains wouldn't able to scare a toddler, but all of them are quite entertaining and of course we have the one who feels bad for the evil deeds done by the gang named the Scars. Though Robert Dryer as the leader Jake does have the tough guy look, but he's given so many silly lines he never really comes across as intimidating, but he does have the look. This movie is all about Linda Blair though who gives a really fun performance. Besides The Exorcist, Savage Streets is by far my favorite Linda Blair movie and besides Regan I think this was the best character she ever played.

Though the stand-out star of the movie is no doubt Linnea Quigley who really delivers an excellent performance; Linnea is best known for her work as a B-movie actress, but in Savage Streets she truly shows her talents as an actress. While I do like many of her movies and she is a fine actress she never really got to showcase her skills, but she does in Savage Streets. In the movie she plays a deaf mute and I know you're probably thinking how hard of a role was it since she had no lines. But that's actually quite tough. She has to express herself only through facial expressions and body movements. Linnea Quigley comes across as very likeable and very sympathetic and to me was clearly the stand-out star despite having no lines and a limited amount of screen time.

Fans of Cult cinema rejoice as we finally got this movie on an SE DVD. BCI Eclipse did an amazing job at putting this DVD together. Savage Streets has a brand new Widescreen Transfer that looks amazing and has three audio commentary tracks one being with Danny Steinmann who constantly talks about certain actresses having nice breasts and how during filming he tried to get some of the actress to go topless. The commentary track was highly entertaining. The 2nd disc has several interviews, which includes Linda Blair and Linnea Quigley and the interviews are great. With sales for a lot of these companies down and some going under and others like Anchor Bay now focusing on other stuff it seemed we would never get a quality release again, but BCS Eclipse just might be the saviors of Cult Cinema.

Overall Savage Streets is a nice piece of 80s exploitation filled with nudity, classic dialogue, violence and a sexy Linda Blair out for revenge. Savage Streets comes highly recommended. Look for former Lightweight Champion Sean O'Grady is a small role as Fadden.",1231027200,3,5755,4.555125725338491
3473830,4,B001AY0FR8,"I found this to be a good movie. As far as acting goes, I think this is one of Linnea Quigley's best outtings as she did a fantastic job in this. I had originally seen this on VHS years ago. The character developement was really good and had some really sleazy gang members, that you had no problem hating. This film is not for every body as it  has some rather intense scenes, of rape, and even tossing a girl of a bridge. The revenge that Linda Blair gets is sweet to say the least. If you can handle the intensity of the film,then it is a good watch. Charlie S.",1227225600,3,564,4.081081081081081
3473831,4,B001AY0FR8,"sexy, tough, authentic, good acting, great story...

reminded me of Class of 1984, except Savage Street's ending wasn't as good.  loved all the bra-less action, the shower scene was hot, however the rape scene was all the more painful because the girl's body reminded me of a high school boy (i.e. flat chested, no hips or curves).  couldn't believe it was the same girl as naked cemetery girl running around in Return of the Living Dead!

not the best, but if you like this kind of movie, get Savage Streets.

3473832,5,B001AY0FR8,"The 1980's provided B- Movie fans with a variety of good vengeance films and the 1984 ""Savage Streets"" is no exception. The one thing that really surprised me was that Linda Blair pulled off the role of the hero really well and overall I really enjoyed seeing this movie again. The movie contains plenty of nudity like the school shower scene and also includes the tub scene with Linda Blair completely?

The first time I saw this movie was on television and one unforgettable scene now included had been previously banned because of the R rating. After seeing the movie again, I think this previously excluded scene wasn't really needed even though it did provide the catalyst for Brenda's character and further development of the film. The subject matter, level of violence and the manner in which it is carried out will not be suitable for everyone. This film is rated R for a reason due to its graphic language, frontal nudity and graphic rape scene.

Brenda played by (Linda Blair) is an excitable young woman with a knack for finding trouble at every turn. Repeated run-ins with her Principal (John Vernon) and fellow students are just the norm for this troubled teenager. One night after an encounter on the street with local punks the ""Scars"" Brenda and her friends decide to play a little joke to teach them a lesson. It's not long after their little prank backfires that the ""Scars"" set out to even the score with extreme violence and brutality. After Brenda's sister played by former scream queen (Linnea Quigley) is savagely and brutally attacked, Brenda sets out to find each of the people responsible and settle the score on her own terms.

Fitted beautifully in a black skin tight outfit revealing just enough cleavage and armed with a crossbow, Brenda goes on an all out rampage as she quickly administers her own brand of vigilante justice. As bodies begin to fall, Brenda learns that one of the scars has attacked another one of her friends. Brenda now sets her crossbow sights and focuses all her rage on one person for the final explosive showdown.

Finally, I must commend BCI, Navarre Corporation Company for releasing ""Savage Streets"" two disc Special Edition for us Linda Blair fans. This film still suffers from some debris and speckling even in the new high definition transfer, but not enough to detract from my overall viewing pleasure. Compared to previous versions this film has been cleaned up considerably. The real let down in this two disc version is the sound quality. There are times throughout the movie when the sound crackles and pops and it's definitely a nuisance at times. Given the great soundtrack, I wish BCI would have remastered the sound in Dolby Digital 5.1.

Really though, the reason why I'm writing this review is to figure out what's different with this release from the out of print (OOP) 2-Disc special edition that currently goes for quite a bit of money here and on Ebay.

Unfortunately, a lot of lesser known small-time genre films like this get horrible DVD treatments. Often times they may even just be a DVD-R marketed deceptively as an actual DVD release. Additionally, a lot of times you'll see the words ""Uncut"" and/or ""Uncensored"" which is simply not true. Other times, a film will be marketed as ""Uncut"" and/or ""Uncensored"" yet all it contains is an extra 30 seconds of dialogue or other pointless stuff that adds nothing to the film.

Simultaneously, a group of four thuggish goons is terrorizing the populace. After a run-in w/ said miscreants, Brenda and company decide to teach them a lesson in civility. Bad idea! Later, poor Heather is easy pickings for these leather-encased hooligans! She's not even safe in a public school gymnasium! Unfortunately, Brenda's too busy fighting in the shower to come to her sister's aid. Viciously assaulted, Heather is hospitalized. While Heather clings to life, Brenda steels herself to find out who did it and how to get revenge. By some miraculous turn of the karmic wheel, the four neanderthals show up at the very club -sort of like Club Scum from HOBGOBLINS- where Brenda and her friends hang out! More trouble transpires. Still, no one figures these mugs could be the perpetrators of Heather's attack! Then, Brenda's friend, Francine encounters these jerks in their jerk-mobile, and meets a grisly end. At last, Brenda gets the evidence she requires, and transforms into a wild-eyed, big-haired angel of death, complete w/ lethal implements of vengeance! Now, the tables of fate have turned, and Brenda unleashes her arsenal on these lecherous losers. Oh yes, their deaths are glorious! The finale in the paint store gives a whole new meaning to redecorating! Co-stars John Vernon (DIRTY HARRY, ANIMAL HOUSE, KILLER CLOWNS FROM OUTER SPACE) as the world's meanest school principal!

The pace is good and the whole rape revenge plot is pure 100% grade A exploitation gold from start to finish. The funny high school politics between Brenda & cheerleader Cindy is amazing, the Scars who are just downright scum & seem to cause trouble wherever they go & various subplots that go absolutely nowhere like that guy who keeps trying to chap Brenda up make this unmissable for all cult film fans out there. The rape scene is uncomfortable viewing but it's intercut with a silly fight between two girls in a shower which is just genius on director's Steinmann's part, it really is.
