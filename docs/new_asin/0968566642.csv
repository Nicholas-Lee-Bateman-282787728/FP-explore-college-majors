7794119,5,0968566642,"The authors clearly state that this is not an instructional (how to ski) video, although there is a training/technique montage in the bonus materials.  Nonetheless, the skiing is technically superb (Olympic Calibre).
This video is all about motivation and entertainment, and there is plenty of that.  The scenery and photography is breathtaking, with impossible high speed camera angles and skiing manoevers set to cool soundtracks... with ""how did they do that?""... then the viewer is placed in a scene that they can identify with.
The scenes are paced alternating between fast and slow. There is something for nearly every type of nordic skier: races, tours, kids, music video, sprints, classic and skating, mostly on groomed trails. [The sound on the VHS version was dubbed at a lower volume level than normal, perhaps to accomodate the dynamic range of scenes, so viewers may have to adjust the volume accordingly]
If you are an keen instructor looking for the latest technique tips, you are looking in the wrong place.  However, for serious motivational material ""On Snow"" is one of the best.",987984000,8,1097,5.11731843575419
7794120,5,0968566642,"On snow is a fun video suitable to skiers and non-skiers alike. The opening credits has a funky industrial techno sound and feel with skate skiers doing 360s which sets the tone as a avant garde nordic video. The first two scenes show the evolution from 1930's retro to 2000 techno in cross-country skiing. From then things just take off.  There are roughly a dozen scenes which show various aspects of cross country skiing: skating, classic, mountains, forest, touring, racing, kids, pro elite, sprints and loppets.  The soundscape and music is great and matches the type of skiing well.  Each skiing scene is linked with short black and white non-skiing clips to progress a light storyline.  And there are cool rock ski music video stuff for pure entertainment value.  The video also includes as a bonus a 10 minute training and technique scene.",970185600,11,847,4.895104895104895

7794123,5,0968566642,"I saw ""On Snow"" at a mountain adventure film festival where it received rave reviews, and just picked up the video version. What it is  not, is your typical nordic ski video. My non-skiing friends were glued to  the screen.  The mountain skate-skiing action scenes were rivoting. The  video consists of a dozen scenes which are intended to cover the tastes of  every nordic skier: wild Warren-Miller-like rock video on skis, world  loppet, national sprint champs, kids, the world's longest ski tour, and a  dryland to on snow technique bonus. It is not intended to be a technique  video but there is some great skiing by pro elite and olympic skiers,  notiably a two-time Olympic biathlete. The sound track is most cool:  industrial techno, gothic rock guitar, rave, pop, and jazz. Overall  ""On Snow"" is serious motivating material.",967766400,7,832,4.956521739130435
