6878117,2,B00QSHWZNE,"Very poor CGI in this, quite disappointing. The CGI is worse than Anaconda which was made in the 90s. It's quite distracting and takes away from the movie.",1426377600,,155,4.571428571428571
6878118,3,B00QSHWZNE,Was not really impressed with this film. Not much Spartan love at all. In fact they are kinda looked upon as an old style of soldier. Ridley Scott could have stamped his name on something better than this.,1425859200,2,205,4.421052631578948
6878119,4,B00QSHWZNE,"We just watched the series last night, which came as a bonus with the XBOX ONE Master Chief Collection game pack.  My wife and I both enjoyed the series (basically a 2+ hour movie similar to Pitch Black).  Locke was pretty cool as the ONI commander and the Sedran officer was pretty good too.  We didn't really get to know the other team members well enough to care if they lived or died.  But generally it was a good movie.  I am looking forward to buying it on Blu-Ray when it releases this Spring.",1421020800,20,500,4.276595744680851
6878120,4,B00QSHWZNE,"First, an admission: I have never played Halo. Ever. I find it fascinating as a story, but I've never actually sat down and played any of the games.

So I have no real preconceptions about ""Halo: Nightfall,"" a miniseries that apparently is meant to link two of the games by introducing one of the main characters for ""Halo 5."" And even to relative noobs to the Halo universe, it proves to be a harrowing, intense story, as well as a good introduction to Jameson Locke -- lots of man-eating space worms, terrorists, and a planet that hates anyone who sets food on it.

On the remote planet of Sedra, a Covenant Zealot sets off a bioweapon in a crowded marketplace, spreading a disease that only kills humans. While hundreds of people sicken and die, ONI agent Lieutenant Commander Locke (Mike Colter) and the Sedran commander Aiken (Steven Waddington) investigate further, despite the fact that the Sedrans don't really like ONI or the UNSC. At all.

But in short order, they discover that the bioweapon is made from a heretofore-unknown element which is found in only one place in the known universe: a chunk of the Halo Ring orbiting a red giant. And if the Covenant gets ahold of any more, it will wipe out other planets.

So Locke leads an ONI/Sedran team to the floating shard of the Ring, where he will have only hours to apprehend the smugglers and destroy the deposit of the element. If they take too long, they are literally toast. But when their ship is taken, the group finds itself stranded on a hostile place with little air and man-eating eel-creatures that swarm whenever they detect technology. Even worse: their only hope is a two-person tug... and they have more than two people.

""Halo Nightfall"" doesn't feel so much like a miniseries as a cohesive movie in the vein of ""Pitch Black"" (hostile planet, ravenous creatures, a scrappy band of survivors). While there were a few references to events in the games (mainly the Halo Ring), it was relatively easy to understand what was going on and how the Halo universe worked -- the Zealots are the bad guys, the Sedrans are primitive yet strong-willed colonists, and the ONI are the military. Nothing too esoteric for sci-fi viewers.

The main thrust of the plot is the harrowing journey across the broken Ring, which quickly devolves into a sweaty, grimy trek over a deserted landscape, punctuated with some nasty death scenes. As the story progresses, the focus shifts to the cruelty and selfishness that can come when a person is forced to choose between his own life and that of others -- some people want to leave their erstwhile teammates to die, while others practically welcome the chance to sacrifice themselves so that others may live.

Perhaps the most distractingly out-of-place part of the story is Aiken's tendency to monologue over... well, pretty much any moments of silence the series has. He waxes eloquent about God, death, being a soldier, and blah blah blah. It becomes rather annoying at times.

But admittedly, Waddington does give a good performance as a former Marine who seems tormented by his past career, and weary of living when his child dies. The alternative is Locke, who is... just a good person. Colter is pretty convincing, though slightly stiff, as a fair-minded soldier who truly wants to help everyone, regardless of their politics or planet. He's even willing to give a fair chance at survival to the people they are there to arrest, and shows consideration and friendliness towards the Sedran officers, who are basically seen as yokels by the ONI agents.

Whether to fans or noobs, ""Halo: Nightfall"" is a pretty enjoyable little sci-fi series -- a strong, compelling story with a likable hero and giant carnivorous land-eels. If only Aiken would stop talking.",1420761600,20,3763,4.830745341614906

6878151,5,B00QSHWZNE,"This film is a great examination of morality and survival at the edge of desperation. Great characters moments and acting alongside solid dialog really make this an excellent entry as a standalone tale in the Halo universe. I really don't get the hate from others, although it may have to do with expectations of the movie before it even came out as many had assumed The Flood being reintroduced into the universe, especially with Ridley Scott's involvement. Excellent production designs are well complemented by Halo's unique aesthetic as a series.

I can't recommend this story highly enough to not just fans of the Halo series, but of sci-fi, horror, survival, and human drama enthusiasts who would like to see how a group of people survive, draw lines in the sand, and decide what survival is worth, and whether they're willing to pay the price for themselves or others.",1508803200,,874,4.905405405405405

Poor writing, poor acting, and truly unoriginal.  Seemed like I was watching Syfy, I expected a lot, lot more from Ridley Scott",1508630400,,385,4.394366197183099

6878235,2,B00QSHWZNE,"I rarely have buyer's remorse, I'm mostly good about knowing what I'm getting and being at least satisfied with a product. But, this was one of the exceptions. I'm not much of a gamer, but I'm a big fan of sci-fi and the Halo Universe. I loved Halo Legends, Forward Unto Dawn and also Fall of Reach. That this was live action and that Ridley Scott was involved, I was quite excited, and because of how much I liked Forward Unto Dawn, I may have had fairly high expectations. This fell quite far of those expectations. Now, it wasn't all bad, but it wasn't very good either. I'm not going to get into all the aspects that I liked and didn't like, but there wasn't much I really liked beyond Christina Chong as Macer.

Also, I'm a big fan of military/action movies, and it seemed like they did not have a military adviser on the set of Nightfall because a good majority of the actors were not believable as soldiers. Anyway, disappointing feature presentation aside, as a DVD it's actually pretty good. The behind the scenes featurettes were a nice plus, which is something that seems to be fairly uncommon on DVD's these days (unless you buy some more expensive special edition). The DVD case wasn't even an eco case, so it actually felt like good quality, also fairly uncommon these days. But, all in all, I would not recommend this Halo Nightfall DVD.

Didn't care for the, once again, predictable black guy and white girl who, against all odds, are the two sole survivors, as this is Hollywood, in its deeply liberal and anti-white sentiment,  casting yet again a net of reverse-racism nonsense into the sea of the subconscious; hence, hoping to sell more product at the expense of a socially sanctioned target (white males). But I liked all the lead actors as they did a great job, and the story was pretty interesting. Definitely worth watching, if you can get past this new Hollywood trend of forcing the story to work around the black guy getting with the white girl (ie., the new Star Wars), in spite of their being a slew of perfectly capable white guys that would be, merely by virtue of statistics, more likely to end up surviving than the 'One Black Guy,' and the 'One White Girl.' This is bothersome as it's blatantly contrived and offensive racism against white males.",1453334400,2,985,4.69364161849711

This was a character piece, not a video game action movie.  There was hardly any action at all, actually, and no fight at the climax.  There weren't even any badguys, really - just some that were more scared and desperate than others.  The story pacing and plot had much in common with Pitch Black if you've seen that but without any wildcards or attitude or Vin Diesel.  Most of the characters were just disappointing examples of humanity and almost none did anything unexpected or otherwise noticeably developed.

I don't know if they are part of the flood, but they look nothing like in the Halo games. It shows no hunters, jackals, grunts, etc just one elite in the beginning and one fish looking dude that keeps getting punched in the face that I never saw in any Halo game. I couldn't get into it much so I played a game on my phone while glancing at the tv once in a while to see what was going on. Believe me there wasn't much going on.  It was either that or fall asleep during the movie. That's how bad it was. I personally think that Halo Forward Unto Dawn is better than Halo Nightfall. There is not much action at all.

(This is of course a spin-off from the X-Box Games 'Halo')
Bought this because it looked a decent sci-fi adventure.
We follow the exploits of 'Jameson Locke' (Mike Colter) legendary man-hunter a O.N.I agent (Office of Naval Intelligence ) a Top-Secret
Military Branch.
He and his team are investigating a terrorist threat on the distant colony of 'Sedra'
While trying to apprehend a suspect, after a struggle, a mechanism is engaged by the suspect releasing a biological substance which
quickly effects some of 'Jameson's' team.
They have to identify the source of the biological substance and destroy it before it can be used on a greater scale.
After identifying where the unique matter comes from 'Jameson' and his squad must go to the almost desolate planet to prevent further
supplies of the substance reaching those who would use it as a deadly weapon.
On the planet there are dangers they hadn't imagined, though finding where the material is mined, almost immediately they become
embroiled in a in a desperate battle for their lives, with the object of their mission still in need of completion............the odds are against them.
An okay watch, perhaps not capturing the level of tension the plot suggests should be there, but it certainly has it's moments as some
members of the squad try to make a deal with one other for the right to survive the night.

6878369,2,B00QSHWZNE,"First off,

I'm a huge halo fan, read all the books, played all the games. Watched Forward Unto Dawn multiple times. I would have to say they didn't even try with this movie.

SPOILERS. To begin with the only covenant action is in the first 5 minutes where they make the elite look like a total whimp. Not to mention in these scenes there is a completely unknown alien race that appears that is never named or heard of again. Hello? You couldn't have just made it a human? Had to be a race that doesn't exist at all in the lore. Aside from that, you have your typical Sci-fi original movie cast where you really can't connect with any of the characters whatsoever. The worst part of all this is that they terribly inserted an Unarmored Ex-Spartan II into this team. A Spartan II who is smaller, slower, and more poorly trained than all of the other operatives on the mission. Typical Spartan II without armor is at least 7 feet tall, built like a Greek god, and could out perform ANY other individual solider before the age of 15. They decided to throw all of that out the window here.

The plot goes that they have to investigate this new substance only found on the 4th Halo Ring (One Chief blew up) due to a biological attack the Elite made in the beginning of the movie. Once they get on the Halo ring the story loses any kind of drive and you are stuck for an hour of Oni guys and soldiers arguing with each other and best of all, unable to use any kind of fancy equipment (BUDGET) due to a new trick the Lekgolo worms (Hunter worms) do (which given they have never been able to do before) where they swarm and go after electronics.

Due to the boring and non-lore friendly plot I was incredibly bored about a half hour into this movie. Watch if you have to, however even for die hard Halo fans this is a movie you can safely pass on.",1433116800,,1839,4.260744985673353

6878377,1,B00QSHWZNE,"I am unsure who this movie is supposed to appeal to. For sci-fi fans it's something of a bust. The characters all speak some fluent literary or movie cliche as if it's meaningful. Problem is you cannot imagine these macho soldiers/warriors actually speaking like this. Example: One says ""Do not go gentle into the night"" - that's from a Dylan Thomas poem entitled ""Do not go gentle into that good night"". It's just hard to imagine this 'line/speech' as 80% of these people are about to die. The bad boy aliens are rather small 'hunter worms' that travel en mass towards any type of technology (like modern day weapons). Gee, hunter worms as the feared aliens? What did they do, run out of special effects? All I thought was, ""Give me a break - they look like the 'worms' from the ""Slither"" movie, but at least those were humorous as they tried to get into the victim's mouths. The Halo planet even looked unimpressive and unimaginative. There was no 'wow factor' in any of this. It just sort of plodded on and on to its inevitable end and you could tell who was gonna live and who was gonna die. Too bad the hunter worms did not get to the script writers first!",1432771200,,1161,4.455399061032864
6878378,2,B00QSHWZNE,not what I thought it would be,1432771200,,30,3.4285714285714284
6878379,3,B00QSHWZNE,"This was originally a five part digital series released on the web that has been compiled together into a single feature film video release. To put it plainly Halo: Nightfall is an opportunity completely missed. Instead of giving the fans of the Halo game series something they can really sink their teeth in they get a movie with plodding pacing, uneven exposition, thin character development and worst of all a plot that is so far removed from what it should be that there was hardly a reason to slap the Halo on the title. If you are looking for that definitive Halo movie you won't find it here.

The movie is set in the Halo universe after the war with the Covenant that brought an uneasy truce. Apparently the Covenant has remnants who still want humans out of the equation and have developed a devastating biological weapon based on an element being mined on a piece of the destroyed Halo. A team of Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) soldiers and soldiers from a local militia led by an Ex-Spartan travel to the Halo shard to nuke the mineral deposit and gain evidence of wrongdoing by the Covenant. Of course nothing goes as planned and the team is forced to survive with difficult odds and even more difficult choices to make. On paper it doesn't sound like a bad story, but that's only on paper.

The story is rife with issues. First off they way they set the stage for the story is done with the finesse of a bull in a china shop. You get cursory exposure to the bad guys who mastermind the weapon (one fully armed Covenant Elite soldier who is conveniently able to walk around in a mostly human inhabited shopping center without causing a commotion I might add). The weapon itself is very fully explained in the movie (How does it work? How many were affected? What was the mortality rate?). These little tidbits are actually pretty important in establishing the whole reason everybody goes to that little piece of Halo ring, and it's treated like you don't really need to know it. From there the movie goes from mission to save the human race to being one of those survival horror type movies where everybody gets conveniently picked off so by the end of the film that one hard question they had to answer (who gets to escape in the only ship left that only has enough room for two passengers) something much easier to deal with (since everybody else is dead). It makes the move ultimately very predictable. Also this whole premise completely misses the point of making a Halo movie in the first place.

Halo fans are fans of the video game. In the video game you have fully armored soldiers fighting out with alien bad guys. This movie is nothing like that. The bad guys from the original video game, the Covenant, end up being just one alien who ended up killing himself instead of some brave warrior stopping him. Then you have the utter lack of Spartan level armor and weapons. The ONI soldiers wear a much less impressive suit, which is nightfall armor and don't even carry the iconic assault rifle from the game. Even then they only wear the armor a short while and hardly ever fire the guns they do have. This is all because of a plot device used to take all of that out of the movie equation. Another aspect of the movie that completely misses the point of making a Halo movie, and they did deliberately!

From all that you also get some pretty canned dialog. Now and then you get a narrative that can vary from semi-wise and reflective to cheap fortune cookie level wisdom that is more at home with films like 300: Rise of an Empire. There is a rivalry between the ONI and the indigenous forces where the biological weapon was detonated that feels very forced. Character development gets worse from there. The cast of players end up having some sort of defining characteristic and never deviates from that. The characters who end up bad guys are essentially bad from the start and so on. Only the three principal players are given any kind of wiggle room in this arena. On that note acting is actually pretty good. Aside from the fact the supporting cast was forced to perform in the confined of a one dimensional character you get some solid, if not Oscar, performances.

So yes. The story is bad and the execution of the story directionwise is no better. However Halo: Nightfall isn't all bad. The cinematography is quite excellent. The whole movie has an A-movie polished look to it that belies it's C-movie script. I'm hoping this is where producer Ridley Scott had his hands in and not the bad script. Props and the special effects supporting them are very, very good. Seeing the weapons in action (when they actually were in action) and the gear and the HUD displays really do draw you more into the Halo universe than anything the story itself could have. The CG effects are a bit of mixed bag. Ships look pretty cool, but the aliens and monsters have a decidedly artificial way about them. This is mostly due to how movement is handled. It really kills the suspension of disbelief when on this day and age when that attention to how a creature would move isn't fully developed.

The Halo: Nightfall Blu-Ray does look amazing. The movie is done mostly in dark settings and you get really good color separation on the disc. Audio is also pretty awesome on the Blu-Ray. Main track is DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 in English with Dolby Digital 5.1 for Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese and German with subtitles for all of those plus Dutch, Danish, Polish, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish, Russian, Japanese, Cantonese, Mandarin and Korean. This makes the one disk a very viable option with many foreign language speakers. There are a lot of extras, but what that means is a lot of little features that only run 4-6 minutes in length so don't let the massive listing fool you. Here's the breakdown:

Beyond the Game: Expanding the Halo Universe -  Since a lot of key elements in this movie aren't known in the game series this feature explores how this movie expands on the established Halo universe without contradicting it.

Canon Fire: Developing the Story of Nightfall - This feature talks about how the character and plot for the movie evolved and why they went the direction they did. It's a spoiler feature so you may not want to see it until after you see the movie.

Old Dogs & New Tricks: The Tech of Nightfall - This is the special effects featurette and it goes into how they made the Halo movie feel like a Halo movie. I'm impressed with the amount of practical effects they did do on the film. If you're into that this is a short, but sweet making of featurette.

Try to Keep Up: The Stunts of Nightfall - How the action was done with the help of stunt coordinator Nick Chopping. This featurette shows most of the more notable stunts.

Return of the Ring: The Locations of Nightfall - On location shots were good in this movie, and this featurette is about doing those shots in Iceland and Northern Ireland. Another worthy featurette that feels like just the right length even if it's only six minutes long.

Heroes Evolved: Introducing Agent Locke - So Agent Jameson Locke will apparently have a key role in the upcoming Halo 5 video game. This featurette delves more into the character Mike Colter portrays.

Character Building: The Cast of Nightfall - Interviews with actors Mike Colter, Steven Waddington, Christina Chong, Luke Neal, Christian Contreras and Alexander Bhat.

New Horizons: Forging the Worlds of Nightfall - This one focuses on the Halo shard setting. It's a pretty fast paced featurette that feels more at home as a promotional plug.

Second Stories - This is actually a pretty large featurette with all 15 second story shorts from the original digital series. The entire set of second stories runs at 45 minutes so each story is only a few minutes long. The stories are accounts that happened before and during the Nightfall film. Some are anecdotal accounts that give a little more background to the story but aren't essential. Some feel completely unrelated aside from happening within the confines of the story. A couple aren't stories at all, but technical or background information on something in the movie. One Second Story I felt was completely contradictory to what the movie portrayed. And one other Second Story was actually a very useful exposition on the nature of the biological weapon, and that information would have helped the movie had it been presented in the actual film (in a way different than the short). All in all more content to make the experience slightly better overall.

Halo: Nightfall is not a terrible film, it just doesn't take you anywhere special. The storyline is completely contrary to what it should have been, but it does look great and the movie does feel very much like it's in the Halo universe. I'm sure Halo fans will watch it and even enjoy it in spite of not only the shortcomings as a film standing on its own but also in spite of not delivering on a long awaited promise. Still know what you are getting into when watching it. It's not a really good film by any standard. Maybe rent it.",1432771200,,9091,4.636645962732919

6878388,3,B00QSHWZNE,"Halo is a video game series almost everyone knows about. It was always huge in terms of gamers and even non gamers. Of course when series are done right and popular it's to be expected that eventually a movie would be made for either a tie in or just to do one, last halo movie for example. Halo Nightfall (HN for short for this review)  does some things right and some incredibly wrong. First this movie is meant to tie in towards the new halo game, Halo 5 guardians. We have a new main character, Locke, who is sent with his crew to examine the old Halo ring after his planet is attacked by a strange virus. It's all very seen before affairs in terms of plot and story telling, crew is a mixed bunch of good guys and jackasses, something goes wrong, and cue in moral choices. What's worse is terms of tie ins this one makes little to no sense. By the end of the film I was asking, so what? Why does this tie in with the future game? Sure you could say oh you'll find out later but I would have rather seen a moment of a cliffhanger ending to maybe set the pace for the game. Nonetheless, besides plot the rest of the movie suffers from low budget cgi, surprising that Riley king of good alien films did this, and above average to mediocre acting. Is this a bad movie, no, in many ways it's a one time watch movie for fans. If you can careless about the halo plot and story or have no idea about it, id advise staying away. Overall HN isn't a bad movie, it has a decent ebb and flow in terms of movie storytelling but it's too often ruined by meh acting and awful visual effects.",1432252800,,1580,4.14657980456026
6878389,2,B00QSHWZNE,"Wasn't the target audience of this movie Halo fans and people who are familiar with the Halo lore? If so, why was this movie not expanding on that? Instead it took viewers down a long and boring road (or hike in this case, literally) of moral dilemmas and commentary on what it means to be a soldier.

I suppose that's fine, but.... Come on, you gotta throw some Covenant action in there and push the story of the Halo Universe along! Elites (ok there was one), Grunts, Jackles, Brutes and what have you. Give the fans what they love about this Universe. Tie it to the games in a way that creates a whole story. This felt so isolated.

Make us care about the characters and build some emotional connection. Not loath them for being at each other's throats constantly.

It is mid-range quality production, fairly good acting, and a decent story.  If you come into this expecting a 'B' film, then you will be pleasantly surprised with how much effort and care went into creating this story.  If you come into it expecting to be blown away by amazing CGI then you're going to be disappointed.

Here's the thing: if you are a halo fan who thinks Halo is the greatest story ever, go back and play the games.  I can guarantee you after the nostalgia wears off you won't be of the same opinion.  You'll still think it is amazing, especially for when it was released, but it won't knock your socks of.  For that matter, go watch Lord of the Rings again, and this time judge the pacing and story without the 'new movie' blinders.  The thing is, this story IS a halo story, and its a fairly good one all things considered.

Now I must admit that I've only previously seen one ""Halo"" movie before and that was the anime of collected various stories set in the ""Halo Universe;"" and - I know - heresy here, I've never played the computer game; but I really liked the Halo anime that I watched.
I have mixed feelings about this live action Halo movie. A horrific alien biological attack on the colony world of Sedra leads to the discovery of a shattred Halo fragment in tight orbit around a Red Giant. The Halo fragment is the source of the deadly biological mutageon which can threaten all of the worlds of Humanity. So a covert team is given covert blessings to destroy the Halo fragment.
While telling a decent, suspensefull sci-fi tale, ""Halo - Nightfall"" didn't break any new ground. It felt like a mismashed, retread of several sci-fi themes thrown in a blender for good measure.

6878486,2,B00QSHWZNE,"Spoiler ahead: This movie had so many problems I don't know where to begin. The main premise of Locke and his team going to the Halo ring fragment was to capture the smugglers and to detonate the havoc nuke. Okay fine, that's understandable. But once they capture the smugglers it's like they could give two s***s. They never ask them the important questions that they needed answering. Such as, how did they discover the Halo ring fragment? Or more importantly, who have they been selling the mysterious element to???

Next, they become stranded after coming into contact with the mutated hunter worms that, for whatever reason, attack technology and everything else that they slither across. This means that there are only room for two out of nine individuals to get off of the Halo ring, after the Pelican crashes. The group makes it a top priority to trudge all the way to the wrecked Pelican in order to obtain the lost havoc nuke. Wait, what??? Why is this important? These guys work for the UNSC, couldn't they just get off the ring using the smugglers ship and then after making contact with the UNSC have them launch a torpedo spread at the ring, or something like that? It's not like it's a matter of life and death that they detonate the havoc nuke immediately. The element and the hunter worms aren't going anywhere, and the smugglers have already been taken care of.

The whole plot was filled with too many holes to make any sense. If the movie did make sense, they would have gotten what information they could from the smugglers before they died. Next, after the Pelican crashed, they wouldn't have gone looking for it. They would have taken two people and flew off the Ring using the smuggler's ship. Those two people could have radioed in to the UNSC from orbit and called for an evac shuttle for the remaining survivors. After the remaining survivors were evacuated they would have called in a nuke strike or torpedo spread from a UNSC frigate to destroy the deposits of the element.

You would have to watch the movie first to understand my comments/review, but this movie really grinds my gears. Such corny acting and such a crap plot line. I was hoping for better, considering this is based on the Halo franchise, but I guess I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up. Hopefully someone in the future will make a worth while Halo movie. Forward unto Dawn wasn't bad, but it wasn't necessarily good either. This movie on the other hand was complete crap, worthy of forgetting.

I'd watch this movie once, just to say you gave it a chance. However, don't be expecting anything even worthy of a C rating.",1428364800,4,2617,4.658008658008658

6878497,2,B00QSHWZNE,"*****HERE BE SPOILERS*****
I am going to focus on three areas: story, characters, and actors.
The STORY has some HUGE plot holes.  (I'm not even talking about the Halo continuity holes -- I'm a casual Halo fan and even I could see the continuity issues.)  To start with, the terror weapon used at the outset is exceptionally ill-defined:  Is it a poison?  A rad weapon?  We're never really quite sure.  Second, it's never explained why there's a huge need to send in a ground team to deal with this problem, and why the only option is to blow up the fragment at that time.  Why not nab the miscreants in space and then let the navy blast the fragment?  (Or, better yet, tow it into the star, rather than simply break the one big fragment into smaller fragments.)  While the time pressure to get off the fragment makes sense, the time pressure to set off the nuke does not, and it drives a series of questionable decisions.  (The right answer: Launch the tug with a crew to get help, while the rest try to make it to the downed ship, which just might be able to survive the coming dawn.) Given that this movie opens with a Covenant warrior running unnoticed through a shopping mall, perhaps I shouldn't have been surprised.

The CHARACTERS are both better and worse than the plot.  They are better in that watching some them become more and more feral while the others rise to the occasion is actually kind of interesting.  The downside, though, is that most of these military characters ring false.  All sense of honor, duty, and commitment -- to say nothing of the personal bonds forged in battle -- seem to disappear. If they had been a crew of mercenaries, then I could believe it, but this ONI.  As someone who has spent the last 15 years working with the US military, I have a hard time pressing the ""I Believe"" button on most of this crew..

While the characters may be a problem, the ACTORS were really good, across the board.  Mike Colter is a force of nature (think Wesley Snipes at his best, i.e., when he's not running the show), and Steven Waddington does an excellent job as well. Christian Contreras is good enough that you can almost overlook that his character is coming unglued over something he should have settled a long time ago.

So, overall: If you haven't seen _Halo: Forward Unto Dawn_, buy that instead -- it's a much better movie.  If you have seen it (or even if you haven't), don't feel bad about deciding you want to see this. Just be aware that you are watching it for the talents of the actors, not for the brilliance of the story.",1428192000,,2562,4.470967741935484

There were numerous conflicts with the Halo-lore, an unknown alien species right at the beginning that did not match any known Covenant race and no one bats an eye meanwhile Halo-fans are left incredibly confused, and logic gaps. The two main things that annoyed me as a lover of the Halo franchise were the unknown alien that is none of the known species to date, and that they made a Spartan-II, even if he was retired and had a number of his augmentations removed, such a bulls**t character. Spartan-IIs, going by established lore, were taller faster, stronger, and more when compared to the average human PRE-AUGMENTATION and they were farther enhanced by injectible augmentations such as increased reaction time denser muscles, and more as well as other augmentations that could, with trouble, be removed in some surgical procedure which they did state; this one, Randall-037, happened to showcase none of the superior traits of a Spartan-II and was even shorter in stature that the ONI officer, Locke. This supersoldier, aged beyond what he should have been given logic and the Halo-timeline, came out to be a disgrace that likely could have been taken by any of the colonial forces that he commanded with the exception of the remarkably frail-looking pilot girl. I mean, really? A supersoldier, genetically superior and augmented with an increase in reaction time, was unable to stop a normal ONI operative from stealing his gun which rest against a rock less than a foot away? I am appalled by what I saw here, as a fan of the series and a lover of the established lore; and the only thing that stops this from having a lower score is the fact that, if it had not had the Halo title and the expectation of quality associated with such a prestigious franchise, then this movie could have been a decent futuristic sci-fi movie.

Instead, 3/4 of the movie is devoted to a team of soldiers navigating through rocky terrain trying to avoid packs of ""hunter worms"" (yes, the enemy is a worm), while scheming against each other as to who should live. The object of their mission is to detonate a nuclear bomb and destroy an ""element"" that causes disease among humans (huh?). By the end of the movie, you're hoping the nuke takes out the entire miserable crew, plot and all.

6878569,1,B00QSHWZNE,"I am a pretty big fan of the Halo franchise. When I heard about a live action tv show with the involvement of R. Scott, I was optimistic.

Do not waste your money on this tripe. There is so much stupidity right from the opening scene. The writing is regrettably, absolutely terrible with no real redeeming moments. The only character with any real presence is the Colonel, but he has so few lines and is reduced to being a sullen warrior with too much on his soul. All of the characters end up being so typical and boring.

Even the story is boring. I mean, these guys are supposed to be investigating a piece of the Halo (which had been blown up) and has been free-floating in space. They technically ARE NOT allowed to be there due to a tenuous agreement/treaty with the Covenant. So it is a blackops mission, if it goes wrong, there will be no rescue. That all sounds really cool, but it rapidly descends into a bunch of overly stereotyped characters saying things that make no sense. The air quickly leaves the premise. The antagonist is even rather a let down as well. Overall, a big disappointment. Rent it, if you want to.

6878572,4,B00QSHWZNE,"I'm a big Halo fan, so I appreciated the film, even if it's not great. It's not terrible and there is a lot to love here. The films biggest sin is that it's far too talky. I don't mind character moments, but there's a lot of mindless dialog that should have ended up on the cutting room floor. But the effects are top notch, and when things do heat up, it undeniably exciting. The ""Riddick"" style plot is a tad predictable but serves up some good moments.

Overall, Halo deserves a better movie than this, but this series demonstrates that the potential for a great Halo film is there. With better pacing, this could have been a classic. As it stands, it's flawed but worth checking out. It's really a 3 1/2 star film. Since there are no half-stars here, it squeaks by with a 4 and calls it a day.",1426636800,4,797,4.2781456953642385

The lack of halo universe tie in and the terrible dialog makes this a terrible but at some points hilarious experience. It is so bad that it can make you laugh.
