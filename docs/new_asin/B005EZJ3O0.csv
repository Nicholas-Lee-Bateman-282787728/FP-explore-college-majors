4670139,5,B005EZJ3O0,My daughter loves Sid the Science Kid but always misses it while she's at school so I purchased this video for her to watch when she's home. She loves it! I love how this show it's always teaching you things but does so in a playful manner that keeps your child's attention. My daughter has learned all about friction and inertia and more just from watching this video and having fun with Sid the Science Kid. I would definitely recommend these videos to anyone with younger kids.,1362009600,,480,4.528735632183908
4670140,5,B005EZJ3O0,"My son loves these, we try many of the experiments at home.  He learns so much about science and learning on his own.  The best series any mother could ask for.  Way to go Jim Henson!",1360368000,,183,4.027777777777778
4670141,5,B005EZJ3O0,"My 2 year old loves Sid!  This was a great price for 4 episodes and the quality is beautiful.  These programs are fact and fun filled, each episode includes ""real life"" kids doing an investigation, and a great teaching song with Teacher Susie.  My daughter loves the music, the fun, and the humor.  Another great show from Jim Henson's company.",1358380800,,344,4.683333333333334

It is such a good show for young kids, I love watching it with him, we even do some of the investigation projects that they do in the show. I recommend it for parents and grandparents to have it really is a great show.",1356998400,,306,3.857142857142857
4670143,4,B005EZJ3O0,"My son (2.5) loves this DVD. He acts along with the skits and now has a very basic understanding of the forces of motion (force, friction, inertia, and elasticity). Because of this dvd, when he falls or hurts himself, we can discuss what happened and when he realizes there was ""too little friction between his socks and the floor"", he gets excited about knowing what happened and is no longer upset.

We bought a 5-pack of Sid DVDs on Woot.com and can't wait to give them to him. As much as I like this particular DVD, I am getting a bit tired of it. I do feel there's a great re-watch-ability to the Sid shows:)",1354579200,,613,4.3304347826086955

4670145,5,B005EZJ3O0,My 4 year old loves Sid!  My son has used some of the terms he learned from this video in every day life!  We were out shopping when he was talking about inertia and friction.  Another adult asked me how my very young son knew such big concepts.  I told him Sid the Science Kid! :),1447545600,,281,3.9642857142857144

4670148,4,B005EZJ3O0,"My grandson loves the videos...It was rather sad though that the case they came in was cracked and they can't keep the videos in it for fear they will get scratched.

8469317,5,B005EZJ3O0,Love the graphics and the lessons taught.  Saw this series at a friends house earlier this year with her two year old and we both had a blast watching them.  Jim Henson is always a win in my book.  Especially as it encourages kids to ask questions about the world around them.  I bought a bunch of these for my 2 yr old niece and she's having a blast being introduced to Sid and his crew.  Fun & Educational to boot too!!!,1482278400,,422,4.097560975609756
