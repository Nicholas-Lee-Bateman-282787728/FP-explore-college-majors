8162242,3,B000LMPLW4,"Lonely Planet is a travel series in which a travel seeks to meet six unique people in a city. I actually like this concept since it shows a different perspective of a city.

Toby Amies, the protagonist, is an English gentleman. In this DVD, he heads to Paris. He met a squatter who makes artwork in abandoned buildings. He also hung out at a flea market. He later met a perfume tester. The tester said that people who test the scent of perfume must be able to detect several different scents. What I didn't like was that she described Paris as smelling like dog s***.

Toby later rode a bike in Montmarte, the hilly, bohemian part of town. Overall, this episode was ok. Despite the fact that it was in Paris, all of the characters spoke English. There were a few too many off-the-wall activities, but the majority of the activities were interesting. If you just want to learn about the attractions in Paris then check out Rick Steves.",1400803200,,934,4.520710059171598
8162243,1,B000LMPLW4,"This has to be the worst DVD I ever saw and I have seen a few... I wanted to learn something about Singapore as a travel destination and all I saw was this lady who inspected toilets, ate and hung out with a band called vomit.... Avoid at all costs.
Too bad it's impossible to give 0 stars...",1228435200,4,292,4.051724137931035
8162244,1,B000LMPLW4,"While this was interesting in a ""look at all the colorful people the host can meet"" sort of way -- it really gives you no sense of Singapore as a travel destination.  Unless you count the tour of public restrooms!",1209254400,4,213,4.325
8162245,1,B000LMPLW4,"This ""travelogue"" tries too hard to find something different and as a result imparts useless information about artists who take over and squat in Paris buildings until the police chase them out.  It goes on to provide further features about their friends.  I hoped to get a video that would show me worthwhile or inspirational scenes of the Paris I intend to visit soon.  This was a complete waste of money.",1189900800,14,407,4.704225352112676
