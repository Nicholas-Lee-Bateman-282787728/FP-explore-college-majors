7076656,5,B00V4RGZSY,"This is long and great for Team Umizoomi lovers, I have never seen this on t.v. so this is great if you want something new and something your child hasn't seen yet",1436572800,,163,4.125
7076657,5,B00V4RGZSY,"This DVD is a little different. It isn't filled with several different episodes. It has just the one episode and has a running time of 45 minutes.

When the moon is blown into four pieces by The Trouble Makers, it's up to Team Umizoomi to embark on an intergalactic adventure and use their math and problem-solving skills to save the moon.

My now four year old has been a HUGE fan of Team Umizoomi for as long as I can remember.  Even at the age of two he would play the game on his Kindle.  He loves math and always walks away with tons of knowledge.  For example, after watching Umi Space Heroes, I got a lesson on Dodecahedron.  After he gave me a lesson, he then moved on to  his dad and told him all about it.  I'll be honest, we didn't know anything about that particular shape so he really did teach us something.  Yes, I admit it..I learned from a four year old thanks to Team Umizoomi!

What's great about the above example is there are times when I'm teaching him and I wonder just how much he is taking in. After Umizoomi brought this shape to his attention, we then focused on learning more about it. So they introduced it in a fun way and sparked his curiosity, he was learning without really knowing it and then I took over and we had fun learning even more information.

**I was sent this product in exchange for a honest review. The opinions above are my own.**",1432598400,4,1378,4.281853281853282

7076689,5,B00V4RGZSY,My kids love Team Umizoom and they get so upset when its not on. I decided to solve that problem by buying a DVD they can watch anytime. We went to a few stores but none of them had any Team Umizoom DVDS and said it would take 3-4 days if I ordered one. I searched on amazon and a few came up but all of them were just 1 show of 26 minutes. This DVD is a movie of 45 minutes long so it was the best choice. It came brand new wrapped in plastic just like it would come if I was to buy it in the store. My kids are now happy that they can watch their zooms anytime they want.,1459641600,3,573,3.629032258064516

He loves counting and answering the questions or ""helping"". I prefer my kids to watch something they can learn from (My daughter knew the Bill Nye the Science Guy intro song at 3yrs old) and I will say that I don't feel bad letting my kids watch this one.",1497830400,,427,4.35
