7814104,5,6301687701,"I agree with the previous reviewer.  This is the best video one is likely to find on Spain.  Surely it would be impossible to cover all regions and major cities, but for breadth and depth, this little film is a gem.  I am absolutely thrilled to be able to purchase it on Amazon and thought I'd never see it again after I retired as a high school Spanish teacher.  I've viewed it literally dozens of times since it first became available in classrooms and have never tired of it.  Small facts have changed and Spain has certainly modernized since the video was produced.  But after quite a number of journeys throughout Spain, I still conclude this film is the best introduction an American can find, short of an actual first trip.  After you see this film, hopefully you will want to do just that: book your first trip!

Please see my product link should you desire to read the absolute best book on the old Spain, as it was just after the Spanish Civil War.  Aline, Countess of Ramanones, a girl from Pearl River, N.Y., writes of her life as a spy during and just after World War II.  Her biographical works read better than any spy novel and ""The Spy Wore Red"" is incredibly rich in Spanish cultural detail.  She has written several other books as well, but this is my favorite and the one to read first.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Spy-Wore-Red-My-Adventures-as-as-Undercover-Agent-in-World-War-II/dp/0394556658/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Spy Wore Red: My Adventures as as Undercover Agent in World War II</a>",1188604800,2,1567,5.105882352941176
7814105,4,6301687701,"This is the fourth video of Spain I have watched, and the best so far. It avoids the cliches and stale footage; moves along and keeps interest up. As a caution, it covers mainly Madrid, Seville, Cordoba/Granada, the Sun Coast beaches, and Barcelona. If you are looking for video of other areas, it won't be much help, but the areas it does cover it covers very well.",981244800,24,366,4.477611940298507
