8236356,4,B000ZSX3EM,"This DVD features a 2008 concert in Los Angeles, CA.  The concert takes place in what appears to be a performance hall (or night club) with a dance floor and surrounding seating.  It features performances by disco legends Linda Clifford, A Taste of Honey, Thelma Houston, France Joli, and the later dance diva CeCe Peniston.  The performances are great, with each performer singing three songs.  I particularly liked Linda Clifford (sassy attitude that made me smile and laugh), Thelma Houston (high energy performer), and France Joli (classy lady, wonderful singer).  The musicians and backup singers accurately reproduced the excitement and energy of the sounds so well known to us fans.

The DVD also features brief, but interesting, backstage interviews conducted with each of the performers.

I recommend this concert DVD for any fan of these divas and/or disco music in general.

I have rated this product four stars instead of five only because of the packaging (I prefer clamshell/keep cases for DVDs insead of the cardboard covered plastic insert packaging.",1355443200,,1066,5.229411764705882
