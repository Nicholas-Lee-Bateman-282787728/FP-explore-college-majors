4331394,5,B004D45NY2,"Everyday Black Man indeed.  Excellent movie, great cast/acting.  Great portrayal of everyday real life (real talk).  Yes, Malik (Hardwick) definitely played his character (as he always does) to-a-tee.  I was a little disappointed with the ending tho, leaves you wondering if Moses lives or dies. Other than that, I enjoyed the storyline.  I would definitely recommend you watch this movie, you won't be disappointed.",1409788800,,416,5.4375

Although, as much as I like Mr. Omari Hardwick, he displayed a character and an attitude that turned my stomach.  Showing me that he is a diverse actor that can take on meatier roles.  Kudos, Omari.  Well done.",1402012800,,334,4.7894736842105265
4331398,3,B004D45NY2,DVD was okay but the story line was sort of weak. The meaning of the movie was decent but to be honest it could use some improvements. Each to their own I guess. I love Omari Hardwick because he is such a talented actor. All characters in the movie did well and this is what kept my interest in the movie.,1396051200,,305,4.016393442622951

4331400,3,B004D45NY2,"Basically, the movie was alright.  It tells the importance of being careful of those you place in your life.  The ending of the story does fall short of my expectations.",1394496000,,169,4.6

4331411,3,B004D45NY2,"This dvd was a great snapshot of the some of the major aspects of the everyday black man, however, the movie didn't have a plot, and it to me should have given more of a variety of the other aspects of the life of a responsible man, instead him always escaping the reality of the hardships of being a black man in the US.  Also, to me there should have being an overcoming or a level of progression over the negativity in the everyday black's man life instead of death as the only option out.",1375142400,,492,4.178947368421053

4331422,5,B004D45NY2,I watched the movie and absolutely loved it! I ended up giving it to a friend so I bought me another one. Usually I don't watch deleted scenes but this time I am glad I did. The one particularly when Moses is lying in bed thinking back when his wife was shot made sense about how he was trying to be a better man. I think that scene should have been left in. But overall a must see.,1355616000,,382,3.91025641025641
4331423,2,B004D45NY2,"Although I am a fan of Omari Hardwick, the role of Malik just did not work. Henry Brown, as Moses, did an excellent job! He was one of the few hopes within the community, and killing Moses at the end of the movie killed hope. Also, killing off the character (Sonny), which Corey Jackson played, was senseless. I was very disappointed with the outcome of this movie, and I will not be watching it again.",1354233600,2,402,4.373333333333333

4331427,3,B004D45NY2,"This is a very good movie. Judgiing by the cover I also thought it was going to be a love story but I was wrong. Despite that this movie was awesome, it kept me entertained and interested from the beginning to the end.",1329004800,8,218,4.093023255813954

4331430,4,B004D45NY2,It was not long enough to me!! I did enjoy it and Omari is always nice to look at. lol. He was just too nice and thought provoking. Of course he had something up his sleeve and what he did to Sonny..was WRONG,1320451200,,208,3.86046511627907

4331432,2,B004D45NY2,"The title of this movie insinuates a story of a black man struggling trying to make it through society. This movie is about a lying drug dealer talking smooth then strong arms his way into this man's neighborhood store to use it as a front to sell drugs. The movie should have been titled ""Lying,Thieving Black Man"", the actings ok but it really could've been better. I wouldn't buy this film.",1317513600,,393,4.549295774647887
4331433,4,B004D45NY2,Entertaining movie.  Story was slightly predictable but interesting none the less.  It is a very good movie for young ladies as a reinforcement on the perils of jumping into relationships and not listening to people who have loved you for years.  I would recommend it for its good entertainment value.,1316649600,,301,4.98
4331434,3,B004D45NY2,"The cover of this DVD is quite deceiving.  This is not a love story between a young black man and black woman.  It is about a middle aged black man who is living a lie.  He conceals the fact that he is the father of a young woman that frequents his store. His business is also slowing slipping out his hands due to his financial distress.  A young Muslim brother, played by the enticing Omari Hardwick decides he wants to give the older man's business some financial support.  As soon as Hardwick enters the screen you begin to sense that he is too good to be true.  His motives become clear as he strong arms the shopkeeper and deceives his daughter into thinking he is upstanding. I enjoyed the movie but I am longing for a film that expresses the pure love between a black man and a black woman. One that tackles the ups and downs involved in two people deciding to take a journey together.  It has been way too long since Love Jones was released.",1315180800,62,950,4.303370786516854

4331436,1,B004D45NY2,"This movie was awful. I understand that the writer and director of this film seem like they are sincere people, but jeez there are so many things wrong with this movie from the EPIC SLOW pacing to the characters, I really can't begin to take the time to name them all. Do NOT WATCH this film. I watched it FOR FREE on showtime & I was still ticked off.",1313107200,3,352,4.115942028985507
4331437,4,B004D45NY2,"I usually don't write reviews but I was so pissed off that I had to do it. You just always root for a hero and a villain. You're hoping that the story will end the way you want it to. But int his case, it didn't & i was just upset about that. Ok, I'm done!!",1312329600,,257,3.607142857142857
4331438,3,B004D45NY2,"This is the story of a ghetto shopowner who dotes on a young lady in the neighborhood. They are bewithched by a pseudo minister of the Nation of Islam who pretends to want a business partnership but really wants to use it as a drug front.

The acting is great and the performances are powerful (espcially Henry Brown as Moses, the shopkeeper with integrity and the actor who plays ""Sonny,"" his mentally challlenged assistant), but the tale itself is hokey and you can pretty much tell what will happen early on in the movie. The fake NOI leader comes in spouting stale and cliched Black Power rhetoric that was played out since the 60s. It is plausible that the naive young girl could be bamboozled by this handsome slickster, but how a man as worldly as Moses could fall for this baloney and ""tricknollogy"" (as the real NOI would put it) is beyond credibility. Early on, the phoney preacher lays down $60,000 without (apparent) strings attached to Moses for his share in the business. Come on! Ray Charles could see that there is something fishy in Denmark (or in this case, Oakland), here. Once again, the Moses character appears to be too smart to give this bogus black leader the time of day!

After this implausability, the rest of the film becomes hopelessly predictable and you can fill in the dots before each scene.

That aside, it's okay for leave your brains at the door entertainment on a lazy Sunday afternoon.",1311552000,8,1423,4.661354581673307
4331439,2,B004D45NY2,"In an interest to follow the career of the OLD SPICE MAN. I choose this movie. It was interesting and I did enjoy watching it. I think I will more use it to compare his acting progress as he continues to move up in his acting career. That was the reason for my purchase as well as the reason to watch it more times. All and all though, it was a pretty good film for a one time watch.",1310256000,,383,3.8607594936708862
4331440,5,B004D45NY2,"OH MY GOD!!!! This movie was inspiring and moving. It touches on so many moral values as a man, as a woman and your faith. Family should always be there for each other no matter what. That being limited by human standards does not mean your not able to do what you can for others. This movie covered all these topics and more in a way that many can relate to
This is must see for all especially in today's world where you have these false people deceiving you and these are people that are to be for you.
