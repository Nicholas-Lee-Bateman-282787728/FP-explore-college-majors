7888621,1,6305281939,"I was a tank man in the real army (US). I'm also a war movie aficionado who used to think that any movie with a tank in it was at least ""good"" just because I love tanks. This is one of two exceptions (the other is ""The Beast""). The story line is stupid, the acting is stilted, and the situations go way beyond any suspension of disbelief. If ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" were to be re-done as a World War II movie, this would be it. It's too bad to even be laughable. There is simply nothing in it that is believable. Tanks generally engage at long range, especially the German Tiger Tank of World War II, that took advantage of its powerful 88mm gun. This silly thing had US M41 ""Walker Bulldog"" tanks portraying Tigers dogfighting at point-blank range as if they were aircraft or something similar. Silly! One with a crew of only two went up against another with a full crew - and won (not likely)!The use of the M41 is not surprising and has been done in many other War Movies, like ""Battle of the Bulge"" - - not enough operational Shermans and Tiger look-alikes to do a big film - so I can forgive that. I can't forgive how absurd this movie made them look. The French underground were portrayed as complete idiots. The US troops were portrayed as dimwits, and the uniforms were strange at best. The acting was just flat out weak in every measure. It was just a bad movie all around. Don't waste your money. It's awful.",1319673600,7,1420,4.322097378277154
7888622,1,6305281939,"This is not just the worst WWII movie ever made, it is arguably the worst movie ever made, period.  Yes, much worse than the infamous Plan 9 From Outer Space.  At least that was so bad it was funny.  This movie is just mindless, boring, and stupid.  It is a confused story of a German tank crew who for some reason speak perfect English, driving a Russian tank, confronted by Americans in German helmets, traipsing through French countryside that looks suspiciously like Spain.  The acting is wooden, the character development is nil, the score is amateurish, and the cinematography is just awful.  I forced myself to watch it because I'm a masochist.  My film buff partner gave up and walked away in disgust after the first 50 minutes.  Warning: if you pop this in your DVD, you will curse the senseless waste of electrons.  Forget this schlock and go watch ""Band of Brothers"" instead.",1169424000,8,886,4.701298701298701
7888623,1,6305281939,"I would not recommend this movie to anyone. The vocal/visual movements of the mouths did not match up throughout the whole movie. The helmets the Americans were using were not correct. The weaponry that the Amercans were using were not correct, as well. The weapons that the Americans were using, weren't even used in WWII; they weren't even invented yet!",1107993600,10,355,4.933333333333334
