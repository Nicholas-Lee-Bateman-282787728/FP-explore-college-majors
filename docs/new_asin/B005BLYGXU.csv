8464046,5,B005BLYGXU,"another haunting childhood memory- for years i would wonder if it ever existet at all.  that was all i had of it till 20 years later and my look-ins to ghibli/anime sparked a spending splurge on 'world masterpiece theatre' (googole that with anime or nippon) anime.  all serial titles of this origin are well worth another re-launch like this,  they are barely known by most unless you come to realise what you have never seen before, may as well be brand new (most are period dramas based on books set a hundred years ago but you know what i mean)  most are just gaining notoriety thanks to fan subbers and such but you will srtuggle to find them non the less.  i got the german version because it was the version braodcasted on c4 and being pal, would have had the higher resolution.  i do not speak german but have watched this series twice and it is simple enough to follow.  i can't afford the price right now but i will get this- chances are you won't be here unless you had that inclination to do so too.  if you can handle the price tag i would get this and hope it encourages similar titles to follow suit.",1373414400,,1115,4.326923076923077
