2667372,5,B000J6H0IU,"I first heard about this video from a friend of mine who entered the SEALs back in 1978.  He saw this film while he was in boot camp.  A SEAL ""motivator"" showed the film to a crowded assembly hall and then asked for volunters to take the BUD/S screening PFT.  My friend had never heard of the SEALs before, but the movie ""Someone Special"" made the life of a ""Navy frogman"" seem like an exciting alternative to his selected Navy occupation.  He smoked his PFT and found himself in BUD/S, which - to his surprise - was considerably more challenging then was suggested by ""Someone Special"".

""Someone Special"" launched the Special Warfare careers of hundreds of UDT and SEAL frogmen.  While clips from this film can be found on YouTube, I'm thrilled that this rare offical film is now available in its entirety on DVD via Amazon...",1162944000,9,828,4.598639455782313

8149329,2,B000J6H0IU,"My GF was curious to see the training a SEAL was put through to forge someone into the top notch warriors we know them to be. Unfortunately this is a DOD recruiting flick, short and pretty much lacking in any substance. Not worth even $.99, let alone $1.99.",1358985600,,257,4.375
8149330,1,B000J6H0IU,"As the other reviewers have already stated, the film quality or resolution in this DVD is insanely bad. If you are into seal footage as I am, you would be better spending your time watching videos of Navy Seals on YouTube. I would also recommend that if you are looking for a really great seal DVD set try BUDS Class 234 it is fantastic.",1348185600,,337,4.28125
