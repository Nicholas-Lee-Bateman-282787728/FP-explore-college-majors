8076495,4,B000A88YIM,"Ok.. It looks like this video was filmed in my grandmother's tacky basement. The lighting and camera angles manage to make someone as fit as Tracy Long not even look that good. However with all that said.. I really enjoy this workout, I rotate it with The Firm Volumes 1 2 3 and it's nice to do a slower heavier weighted workout. There are a lot of super unique moves and Tracy always delivers perfect instructions. If you like the older Firms and are looking for something to balance the high cardio quick moves of those tapes this makes a nice addition.",1376092800,5,555,4.450980392156863
8076496,5,B000A88YIM,"Strong Bear is part of the original FitPrime series by the late Anna Benson, co-creator of The Firm workouts. The videos in this series are known for their blend of exercise components (cardio, weights, and yoga), their often-quirky moves, and their relatively poor production values (more on this below). In general, I really like the FitPrime workouts, as I find them to be fun and different, so after acquiring several I decided to give Strong Bear a try as well.  For this full-body weighted workout, you will need a tall box/high step and several sets of dumbbells; a balance dowel and ankle weights are optional.

Strong Bear is led by Tracie Long, who later went on to create several of her own video series (borrowing both some of the moves and some of the music found here). Tracie is an excellent, no-nonsense instructor, and I found her to be even more low-key in this than in her other workouts. Unlike most of the other FitPrimes, Strong Bear has very little cardio, although there are three separate segments which include brief plyometric jumps (plie jumps, squat jumps, and toe jumps). Rather, the main focus here is on weight work, particularly for the lower body and even more specifically for the inner thighs. From a standing position, Tracie does several unique twists on plie moves (eg, plies with one foot on the box) to target this area, and in addition, there is a long series of floor work focused mainly on the inner thighs. The upper body is certainly not ignored, however: you will do compound upper and lower body moves (eg, squats with overhead press), plus there is a really great upper body balance sequence where you stand on one leg to do military presses, french presses, and shoulder work. Although this definitely works the core, there is not much other abs work, but the workout finishes with a nice stretch. Below is the chapter menu breakdown from the DVD:

Step Warm Up
Step Stretch
Step Dig
Pli Squats
Step Pli
Plank Jumps (Tracie calls this Boot Camp!)
ND Leg Press + Lats
ND Dip + Pecs
1 Leg Arms

D Leg Press + Lats
ADD ankle weights + Soup Bowl
ND Leg Abduction
Chest & Triceps
D Leg Abduction
Butt Pops
Core + ND Leg Adduction
Core + D Leg Adduction
Core V Straddle
Flex Yoga

For the most part, I am able to match the weights that Tracie uses, but I sometimes have to go lighter than she does, especially for the compound moves. I found Tracie's cues for push-ups with one hand on the box to be extremely helpful; this move has always confused me a bit in other videos, but Tracie provides detailed information, including showing you what NOT to do, and so I felt the exercise much more than usual. In other places during this workout, however, I was disappointed that Tracie did not give more in-depth setup instructions. Many of the exercises in this video were new to me, and thus I would've liked greater assistance from Tracie about how I should be positioned as well as exactly where I should be feeling the work. Finally, regarding the production values: as with all of the older FitPrime videos, you can clearly see the editing cuts. This did not bother me, but what WAS a bit more noticeable to me was that in a few spots, Tracie works the two sides of the body unevenly (eg, she does a final set of slow reps for one bicep but not the other). Also, although I generally enjoy the music in the FitPrime videos, it got a little weird at times here, suddenly lapsing into a few bizarre spoken vocals.

Overall, however, I found this to be an excellent, unique strength workout. Despite the fact that there wasn't much cardio, the relatively fast pace of the moves kept me in my target heart rate zone during most of the standing work, and I felt a nice burn in my inner thighs the next day. Fans of Tracie's newer workouts are likely to enjoy this as well (so long as they are prepared for the lower production values). Definitely recommended as a solid, distinctive full-body workout, with my final rating being 4 1/2 out of 5 stars.",1283904000,5,4007,4.536652835408022
8076497,4,B000A88YIM,"I love this video. I realize the production value is poop, and it doesn't do Tracie justice, but the content of the video is great. I try and do this one once a week. It's such a good, different work out. It's great to add to your normal videos because it has moves and lifting sequences that you pretty much will only find in this video. It works your legs out, and I'm always a little tight the morning after this one. It's got pretty good cueing in it, and Tracie just shines in it. The hardest part is the standing leg lifts with the weighted ankles, SO  HARD!!! I love this video and would encourage anyone to add it in during their week to shake things up.",1227657600,6,662,4.171875
