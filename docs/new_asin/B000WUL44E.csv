8225766,4,B000WUL44E,"After watching the 2-hour jacket DVD, I was disappointed that this video at the same price is only an hour long. She does however pretty much cover about all there is to say on the topic.

I just recently purchased this DVD, so I haven't yet had the opportunity to put much of it into practice. Her suggestion to use Solvy on both sides of the buttonhole might be useful on some fabrics, but when I tried it with a waistband buttonhole on a pair of jeans, the Solvy was slipping and only added to the problems and I wound up not using it. I do like the idea of basting lines up and down the front of a jacket, blouse or dress to keep the buttonholes uniform.

I bought the DVD because even though I have an expensive Janome machine, it is heart-wrenchingly bad at doing buttonholes, despite the promises of the seller. For me, the DVD was worth the price just for her technique of adding a seam to the front of a jacket and placing the buttonholes within the seam, completely avoiding the need to use the machine buttonholer.

I do wish someone had pointed out that the information on this DVD comes straight out of Power Sewing Step by Step, so merely buying the book is a cheaper alternative. I do find it helpful, however, to watch and listen to her in addition to the book. She constantly puts out little pearls of sewing wisdom in addition to the main topic that, for me, are more than worth the additional price. The only reason I marked this 4 instead of 5 stars is that, for $30, I expected more than an hour of advice.",1255824000,5,1527,4.295138888888889
