8384240,5,B002YJWDXM,"TNA had a great year in 2009. The glory years of TNA were 2006 to 2009 when stars like Sting, Cage, Angle, Wolfe came to TNA and young stars like Joe and Styles rose to the main event picture. Aside from Joe all the wrestlers on the set have left the company. Angle is in the process of leaving TNA he is still under contract by likely to return to WWE. Sting is gone. Jarrett is starting a new promotion and left. AJ left unhappy with his contract offer and I think there is a 70 percent chance he never returns to TNA. Daniels is gone. Wolfe left. It's sad to see TNA in the shape it is now. As long as Dixie has the money to keep TNA in business I remain hopeful they can build some new up and coming young stars into players. I think losing Jarrett hurt. I think Hogan and Eric helped kill what TNA was with the six sided ring and screwed TNA up. With them gone maybe maybe someone will step in and make some smart decisions and save TNA. I think TNA will hang on as long as Dixie backs it and I don't think she will willingly pull the plug on TNA.

  With that said this is one of the greatest TNA DVD releases ever. They are all great matches. The Sarita Flash match may come as a surprise to be on the dvd but I liked it. The Jarrett Angle match was epic. Jeff was often scrutinized for making himself the champ and constantly putting himself over. He hung in step for step with Angle and proved he deserved to be champ all those years. Kurt and AJ had a great match. Those two never had a bad match. They had a good chemistry. I thought the Sting and Angle match was great. It was not as good as their Bound For Glory Match but still a good match when those two face each other. Angle and Wolfe had one of the best matches in TNA History I thought. It was too bad Wolfe's time in TNA was brief and he was not used correctly. He was correctly here as he put on a show with Angle.

  AJ vs Daniels vs Joe was a awesome match. These guys never put on a less than great match when put in a three way dance. I thought Daniels should have been world champion. Joe, AJ and Daniels should have take turns being champion instead of RVD and Ken Anderson. I liked the AJ Sting match even though it was a little disappointing. It was short and not as good as Sting's matches with Angle and Joe at Bound For Glory. It was an important match. It put AJ over and helped his career while giving Sting a fond farewell putting AJ over to be the new Franchise. This would be wasted though as AJ lost to RVD and was misued for the rest of his run in TNA. I was glad Sting returned to TNA after this match and wrestled for five more years for them. Without Sting TNA would haven't gotten bigger. He did a great job while he was there and walked away when it was time to walk away.

  In closing this is a great TNA DVD that is a must own for any TNA fan or wrestling fan. I think TNA ended up giving the Wrestling fan a alternative to WWE. Due to poor management and some unwise decisions TNA declined but there were some great years for TNA and 2009 was one of them. It's still possible TNA will rebound and return to glory while still in business. Cheers and Enjoy!!",1400889600,,3155,4.043269230769231

Sarita vs. Alissa Flash - TNA Impact 7/16/09
I didn't really get why this was put on this dvd, but these two knockouts put on a pretty good match. I watched this match when it aired on spike and This actually was the best TNA knockouts matches i had seen in a long time, considering that those matches started to suck, but these new newcomers just entertained me, and had a good match.
3.5/5

AJ Styles vs. Kurt Angle - Tables match TNA Impact 1/22/09
This is a very enjoyable match only because this was when the frontline had a huge rivalry with the main event mafia. These two put on a show, except this was a two out of three tables match. This was just very good, action packed, and was made good becuase of everything that had happened between those two. I enjoyed this match and thought it was very entertaining. This match deserves to be on here.
4/5

Sting vs. Kurt Angle - Empty Arena match TNA Impact 2/19/09
This wasn't as good as i thought this match would turn out. This match was slow paced at times and not very enjoyable. But had it's moments. Some moments like Kurt falling about 15 feet, Kevin Nash getting envolved, and Kurt spitting in Stings face.
3/5

Kurt Angle vs. Jeff Jarrett - No DisqualificationTNA Genesis 2009
This was a match that definatly deserved to be on here. These wo just put on a great show. This match had a great stipulation, turning into just a classic TNA match. This match had some moments like an olimpic slam off the stage, tons of huge chair shots from both men, and Angle getting the victory also injurng Jarrett for a couple weeks. I loved the action, intensity, and technical wrestling in this bout. Very entertaining, very Joey Styles oh my god material, and just deserved to be on this dvd.
5/5

Homicide vs. Amazing Red vs. Suicide vs. Chris Sabin vs. Alex Shelley vs. Daniels -Ultimate X TNA Bound For Glory 2009
This was a very good match, but i feel that this match doesnt really deserve to be a match on here. During the year, the X-Division had better matches, but, i think this was almost the best. This match has tons of great moments like everbody hitting their finisher, Suicide getting Kaz's(hint hint) finisher off the top rope to Sabin, Daniels and Suicide huge fall from the top of the cables and daniels almost breaking his neck, and the huge win for Amazing Red.
4/5

Sting vs. AJ Styles - TNA Heavyweight championship TNA Bound For Glory 2009
Another match from the sick ppv bound for glory. This was a good, short world title match, but was very enjoyable. These men had good action between them with Styles retaining the title. Good promo after the match with sting, his retirement, and the one more year chants. I did like this match, and thought that this didn't really deserve to be on here, i thought that the Angle/Morgan match was better and should have been on here, but still, i did think that this was a ok choice.
4/5

Desmond Wolfe vs. Kurt Angle - TNA Turning Point 2009
What a match. This match, would go down as one of the best matches in TNA history. This was a classic from the classic ppv of turning point 2009, these two had great action, tons of technical wrestling, and had a good time length. This match was a submission fest, had some highflying moments like Angle getting a huge frog splash from the top rope. Great win for angle getting a ""illegal"" submission on Wolfe and making him tap.
5/5

AJ Styles vs. Samoa Joe vs. Daniels - Triple threat match for the TNA heavyweight championship TNA Turning Point 2009
What a match. This was practically a Unbreakable 2005 rematch, except was for the world title. These men just put on a show. This match deserved to be after the Angle/Wolfe match. This had tons of highflying action from daniels, styles, and even at times Joe. This was the turning point of the Daniels/Styles relationship because this was the time when Daniels felt like a loser, but felt like it more when he looses the match for AJ to retain. I loved the action, the reversals, and was just a enjoyable match. What a classic.
5/5

This is a very good dvd. Practically for the last two matches. I recomend this dvd to your TNA collection.",1279152000,5,4271,4.479434447300771
8384242,4,B002YJWDXM,"Without a doubt, 2009 was a standout year for TNA.  There were periods where the company clearly had it's ups & downs from the Main Event Mafia vs. TNA Frontline/Originals story, the influx of so many old & new faces coming into the company, Sting's career taking a different direction than it ever did before, new championships introduced into the company, storylines/angles that still standout to this day (remember the riot on Impact?) and changes throughout the entire company.  This DVD is set to showcase the highlights of that year along with various matches.

Matches Include:
Sarita vs. Alissa Flash - This was the technically the TNA debut for both women here (eventhough Flash was already in TNA under the alias of Kong's manager, Raisha Saaed).  This match was heavily put over for weeks leading up to it as a showcasing for the debuting Sarita but Flash made a statement in her own right straight from the beginning when she told the ring announcer to call her the ""Future Legend"" & took the fight right to Sarita from the start.  Sarita was able to showcase her lucha style with out of the ring dives & a armdrag off the top rope while also displaying some MMA with an arm bar.  This was a very competitive match for the time they had & both ladies left an impression when it was over.
""Impact"" July

Tables Match: A.J. Styles vs. Kurt Angle - As anyone can tell you, whenever you get an A.J. Styles vs. Kurt Angle match...it's quality viewing.  However out of all the matches I've seen from them, this is probably the weakest one because the gimmick handicapped them from doing what they did best & wrestle.  They were able to tell a better story than you usually get from tables matches with both men trying creative ways to put them through the table while also avoiding & countering the attempts for themselves to go through it.  It was a good match but the gimmick handicapped them from giving us the classic performances we're used to...but look out for the one moment where A.J. Styles used the table on Kurt Angle in a way that had every single match watching go ""OUCH!""
""Impact"" Jan.

Empty Arena Match: Sting vs. Kurt Angle - It seems like we only get this type of match once every decade (Funk/Lawler in the 80s & Rock/Mankind in the 90s) but that's what makes this match special...so special that this match got Impact it's highest rating in the history of the company to that point.  Both Sting & Angle were in the Main Event Mafia however Kurt's ego got out of control to the point where he wasn't only the ""Godfather"" of the group but he wanted Sting's TNA Championship as well.  As you would expect, they fought all throughout the Impact Zone from the ring through the empty seats in the stands & ramming Kurt against the wall various times.  Their emotions kept boiling over leading to both men just screaming at each other ""I'M GONNA KILL YOU KURT!"" & ""I HATE YOU STING!""  Another match that was good for what it was but it's more about pushing the story between the two men than anything else.
""Impact"" Feb.

No Disqualification Match: Jeff Jarrett vs. Kurt Angle - After months of Kurt's personal attacks towards Jarrett's family, Jarrett came for revenge here & you saw that right from the start with Jeff giving Angle strong irishwhips into the turnbuckles hurting his back & even giving Angle a low blow early just escape his sleeper hold.  This got violent later on as Angle nailed Jarrett with the ringbell in the face before Jeff came back with a DDT on the ramp that resulted in both men being busted open before continuing the brawl on the entranceway & Angle even delievering an Olympic Slam off the stage through a table that took so much out of both men that they had to crawl back to the ring to continue to match.  Both men used the chair against each other before it took a wrestling move to end this physical encounter.  I've openily been one of those people who feel like ""you've seen one Jeff Jarrett match, you've seen them all"" as a high majority of them always start off with a little wrestling before going into a brawl through the crowd & back into the ring before tons of interference & the use of his gutair happens.  However Angle was able to get a damn good match that was one hell of a brawl & told a great story at the same time.
Genesis

Ultimate X Match: X Division Champion Amazing Red vs. Daniels vs. Chris Sabin vs. Alex Shelley vs. Suicide vs. Homicide - The setup for this Ultimate X was new as they had the usual ringropes stretched out above the ring with the championship hanging in the middle but above that was the Elevation X structure as well that was also used in the Ultimate X match back at Victory Road '07. Just as you would expect from the Ultimate X match, this was a wild & crazy stunt fest that led to us chanting for the wrestlers to ""Please Don't Die"" at one point. One highlight without a doubt was the team of the Gunz themselves as their speed & doubleteam moves were just amazing to watch. And speaking of amazing, other moments to look out for were the wrestlers fighting on top of the Elevation X structure & the failed attempts at winning the belts resulting in some heavy falls like Sabin & Red landing facefirst at one point while Daniels landed so nasty on his head that most of us were shocked that he was able to walk out the ring.
Bound For Glory

TNA Champion A.J. Styles vs. Sting - This was a true ""gentleman's match"" here as they shook hands before the match & put on a performance that didn't need ""heel"" tactics as both men kept a level of respect with each other throughout the match. As usual when it comes to Bound For Glory & even pointed out various times throughout the night, Sting is TNA's ""Mr. October"" & did bring his ""A"" game here for this match as he kept up with A.J. Styles here & took the fight to him straight up with even hitting his Scorpion Deathdrop & locking in the Scorpion Deathlock at various times for Styles to keep fighting while A.J. did tone down his high flyin' offense for more of a grounded style. If you can get past the ending which came sudden & had a poor setup to it...this match surpassed their previous match a year earlier from Turning Point however I enjoyed Sting's performances against Samoa Joe & Kurt Angle at the previous BFG's more than this one.
Bound For Glory

Kurt Angle vs. Desmond Wolfe - This was the PPV debut of Desmond Wolfe (the former Nigel McGuiness) and after weeks of attacking Kurt Angle & leaving him laying, Kurt got his chance for revenge here.  Kurt played a smarter game than expected here as he remained one step ahead of Wolfe & counter the moves that were used in previous weeks by Wolfe in his attacks against Angle.  Wolfe was able to work over Kurt's arm with moves like a keylock while being able to reverse Angle's trademark moves like the Angle Slam into a DDT.  Kurt used various submission moves of his own that we aren't used to seeing from him such as a side triangle choke while also being able to deliver six german suplexes at one point.  All I can really say to summerise this match is that this was a wrestling (not sports entertainment but pure straight WRESTLING) fans dream here as both men came into this match studying each other so hard that they had the answer to everything expected from their opposition.  To modify a pun from Kurt himself...this was awesome, it was damn awesome!
Turning Point

TNA Champion A.J. Styles vs. Daniels vs. Samoa Joe - For the first time since Unbreakable 2005 (if you don't count the 2006 PPV's of Against All Odds & Destination X), these three meet once again in a rematch of one of the most famous matches in TNA history.  With the conflict between the friends in Daniels & A.J. Styles, Daniels punched A.J. right at the start of this match & later showed that he wouldn't be overlooked in the match with various moves like applying a double submission on both A.J. & Joe at the same time with a Camel Clutch/Boston Crab combination.  A.J. Styles pulled out various moves that he don't see from him on a regular basis like the Fosbury Flop twisting dive to the outside while later being monkeyflipped into a powerbomb by Samoa Joe.  It should be noted that Daniels was without a doubt the M.V.P. of this match & was a performance that elevated a talent...even in a losing effort which has been needed from him since he came back to TNA earlier in the year.  I can try to pick out some of the highlights like I just did but this is one of those matches that I seriously can't describe as it lived up to the hype based off the quality they had 4 years earlier but it was given but these three men delievered a match completely different than their previous three that was quality in it's own right that resulted in ""Screw Hulk Hogan"" chants from the fans.
Turning Point

In addition to the matches, video packages are shown recapping 2009 & some of the acomplishments TNA made in the year.  DVD extras include a music video featuring various highlights from the year, the Dixie Carter sitdown interview, and highlights of the Hulk Hogan press conference at Madison Square Garden.  The only real negative I have to say is that some of these encounters certainly wouldn't qualify as the best ones to pick out when highlighting the year while others were good in their own right but certainly not better than the picks they decided to leave out such as why put an irrelevant tables match between A.J. & Kurt on here yet leave out their much talked about 20 min. classic right before Bound For Glory off?  In the end, I have to say that all the PPV matches were quality in their own right while the Impact matches are good but nothing that you really HAVE to go out of your way to see (with the exception of the Knockouts match) but this is still a gem that I would recommend to see.",1271808000,,9811,4.457844779452819
