I really have to ask you, where are you getting the DVD and watching it to review it with your praise or hate?",1101340800,3,263,3.8
2181712,4,B0006B41GM,"Everyone who complains about this DVD being a ripoff need to keep in mind that they are releasing the UNCUT version of Road to Rhode Island, something that disappointed me terribly when the Full Season was released with a censored version.  When the original episode aired on TV there was a section making fun of Osama bin Laden and airport security (well prior to 9/11)  The DVD set was a travesty in cutting this whole section out.  Those who are complaining are just these Johnny Come Lately fans that only bothered to watch it on TBS and DVD and have no idea how great some of the originals were before they were censored for DVD.  13 bucks to regain that episode?  Worth it for me.",1101340800,70,686,4.456

2181714,4,B0006B41GM,"The dvd is very cool, but some people find it to be a waste of money to buy it.  Some people think that this dvd was only put out to ""bilk"" you all of more money...This is insane.

People that complain about others trying to make more money, is as ridiculous as people blaming Steve Bartman for the Chicago Cubs fall in 2003 (sports reference, if ya don't know look it up).  How can anyone complain about someone doing something that ANYONE would do.  Everyone who wrote a review would try to make more money doing anything they can.  I give them props for coming up with this idea...and I don't know, maybe I am crazy, but I plan to buy a $13 dvd on my favorite show...

anyone thinking about buying this dvd should...its a great dvd chock full of uncut episodes and the long awaited preview of ""American Dad"" very very cool buy",1099872000,7,829,4.316129032258065

2181717,1,B0006B41GM,"I have to agree with reviewer Smokey on this one. This release is a joke. Do everyone a favor and pass on this one. Don't encourge studios to censor the first release of a series on DVD only to release it ""uncut"" later. The special commentary tracks included here were left off the volume 1 and 2 sets. I'm sure FOX was saving them for an opportunity to make more money.",1098748800,11,370,4.225352112676056
2181718,1,B0006B41GM,"This single disc includes 5 previously released episodes. The big addition: the few seconds of Osama bin Ladin (sic) that was opted not for inclusion on the episode ""Road To Rhode Island"". Apparently all the reasons not to release it in tact the first time around no longer apply. Does anyone hear a CA-CHING? This disc will include some commentary, blah blah blah. Die hard fans will purchase it, but just buy the multidisc sets. It's hard to justify a $12 price for a few seconds of newly included cartoon footage. It seems like it has become standard now. Look at the so called ""uncut"" Ren & Stimpy. How long will it be before a ""completely uncut"" set occurs--only to ask fans for more money. MacFarlane & Fox should take a lesson from the Tom & Jerry Premiere DVD set. It was noticed that Disc 1 was censored, and an exchange is being set up so that fans who buy the set can exchange the censored disc for an uncut one.

2181719,5,B0006B41GM,"This DVD is Seth MacFarlane's five favorite episodes of the show, the first three seasons.  Seth is the creator of the show, and the voice of three of the characters:  Peter - the dad, Stewie - the baby, and Brian - the dog.

One of the episodes on these five is the un-edited version of ""The Road to Rhode Island"".  The version that appears on the volume one DVD set, and on the reruns has one scene edited out.  A scene edited out after 9/11 because it includes Osama Bin Laden.  The episode originally aired about a year and a half before that day, but it was edited out.  Enough people have complained on the internet to force the makers of this particular DVD to release the original version.

The scene I speak of takes place at an airport.  Stewie distracts the baggage checkers with the x-ray machines from seeing what's inside his bag by singing a show-tune.  Osama Bin Laden, impressed that it worked for Stewie, sings himself to distract others from seeing what he's carrying in his bags.

Anyways, I'm not sure what the other four episodes in the set are, but you can be sure that they're good ones.  For those that haven't heard yet, this show will air some new episodes starting next summer!  I tell ya, I can't wait.",1098662400,34,1231,4.441964285714286

2181735,1,B0006B41GM,"first i'd like to say family guy is way overrated. just as the writers of south park so aptly put it, the writers of family guy are freakin lazy and unimaginative. i mean, come on... it's obvious mcfarlane has never put the effort into creating a coherent plot for his episodes. any fool with half a lick of talent can create a cartoon that consists of ""flash backs"" and music numbers strung together with no real purpose or message behind them... not to mention the fact that half of the episodes just copy the plot and characters from other well known shows/movies (e.g., willy wonka and the chocolate factory, the twilight zone, etc.).

that said, don't buy this family guy dvd. it's not freakin' sweet because family guy freakin sucks. however, if you must by it, go to wal mart. they sell this piece of garbage for about $5.",1277856000,,829,4.563758389261745
2181736,5,B0006B41GM,"I've been a fan of this show for several years now, and one of the things I wanted to do was purchase a Family Guy DVD that had a few episodes that I could watch when the show wasn't aired.  This is a perfect DVD for just that type of occasion.  Many different episodes to watch, including my personal favorite, ""Lethal Weapons"".  Some people are offended by the show, but I say if you are offended, it probably means you have some sort of inner issue that you've yet to work out.  Even I think that some of the material is off-putting at times, but overall I understand MacFarlane's idea, which is to expose those flaws that we in humanity have against others of our kind.  In other words, if you can't take the joke, you've probably got some issues that you've not admitted freely.

""Family Guy"" covers many topics that we otherwise don't really talk about, including racism, feminism, abuse, sexual situations, and other fine topics that would otherwise be inappropriate dinner table talk.  Folks, this is NOTHING like ""The Simpsons"" (although MacFarlane has referenced that show a few times), and that is saying a lot considering that ""The Simpsons"" were considered to be a socially unacceptable animated show of its time.  Still is to a point, but ""Family Guy"" takes the same socially unacceptable behavior and takes it to levels that we not dare encroach upon.

If you're looking for ""sophisticated"" shows, then definitely don't buy this DVD.  If you are EASILY offended, and I mean easily offended as in someone saying ""Hello"" and you shrivel and tighten up because someone acknowledged you, then please do the rest of us a favor, and don't watch this show then complain how it offends you.  Some of us in this world actually enjoy watching the material, and laughing with it, because if we don't loosen up, then we're no better than say China when it comes to media.

Overall, this is the kind of show that you don't want kids under 13 watching, and even then, I'd caution people to watch it first, then decide if it's okay for kids 13 and older to watch.  But personally, if I were a parent, I'd let my kids watch at 13 or older, then be the responsible parent and talk to them about what they just watched versus being a strict parental authority and blocking out the world to them.

Anyway, the product DVD is a great collection for the casual ""Family Guy"" fan.  If you don't want to commit to buying a whole season DVD set of the show, this may be for you, but fair warning, you'll end up wanting to buy the season DVD sets like do already!",1270684800,,2552,4.529411764705882

2181739,4,B0006B41GM,"THE FAMILY GUY adds to Fox TV's list of tv shows about dysfunctional families (i.e. THE SIMPSONS and MARRIED WITH CHILDREN). Creator, writer, voice actor, Seth McFarlane's only crime is that he loves pop culture, MGM Musicals, Comic Books, Saturday Morning Cartoons, etc and there's nothing wrong with that. Those added non-sequitur clips that pop up in the middle of episodes is a clear indication of that love of pop culture. This reviewer thinks that some critics lambast the show because they wish they had thought up some of the stuff he lovingly lampoons and throws in. They aren't for cheap laughs, but it is to give viewers a fond rememberence of stuff they grew up with as children giving it a warped twist. Another obvious indication is using Adam West (aka Bruce Wayne/Batman) as one of the voice actors for the show. FAMILY GUY works for this reviewer because  this reviewer is in tune with the warped, yet genius mind of Seth McFarlane.",1240185600,,949,4.786585365853658

2181751,5,B0006B41GM,"In my opinion, these first three seasons are better and much funnier than the resurrection season, simply because the gags are much more solid and give the episodes a LOT more replay value than the new season itself.

These five episodes are hand-picked favorites by none other than creator Seth MacFarlane. They are:

When You Wish Upon a Weinstein: Peter wishes upon a star for a Jew for better account protection and later becomes convinced that Chris will become better at school by becoming a Jew himself. Not one of the greatest, but still pretty funny. And it's easy to see why this episode was banned from airwaves. 7/10

Road to Rhode Island: A classic. Plain and simple. In order to forget his abandonment from his mother, Brian tries to bring Stewie home after Stewie's trip to see Lois's parents' property. Unfortunately, Brian and Stewie end up losing their plane tickets and goes on a journey back to Rhode Island on foot. A blend of heart and humor from beginning to end. Even the cut Osama Bin Laden scene was a hoot. 9/10

To Love and Die in Dixie: One of my all-time favorites! The Griffins are sent to the deep south after the criminal Chris placed the finger on for a grocery robbery escaped from jail. Rippingly hilarious! 10/10

I Am Peter, Hear Me Roar: Probably one of the edgiest, yet funniest episodes ever written! Peter is sent to women's retreat to find his ""feminine"" side after being sued by a local employee for sexual harassment. 8/10

Lethal Weapons: The highlight of this DVD! Lois joins Bonnie for Tae-Jitsu classes and everybody follows her example. The family brawl towards the end of the episode is just plain hysterical. 10/10

Now on to the extras: Three commentaries on Lethal Weapons, To Love and Die in Dixie, and I Am Peter, Hear me Roar which, although very suggestive, are still interesting to listen to. Next, a commentary on Road to Rhode Island by Brian and Stewie is a real hoot. A clip of the first American Dad episode is included, somehow isn't funny while the animation is better than Family Guy. Finally, there are two separate interviews by Seth MacFarlane: One where Seth talks about American Dad, and the other for the return of Family Guy. 7/10

Overall: This is the best ""best of"" compilation I've bought so far! Just like Futurama, I don't feel like buying the season sets since the show is still rerunning on Adult Swim and TBS. 9/10",1138492800,22,2396,4.67458432304038

MacFarlane provides colorful commentaries on each episode (and even provides one as both Brian and Stewie on Road ro Rhode Island which is worth the price of admission alone), and there are other assorted extras as well, including previews of the new Family Guy and American Dad.  In the end, whether this is worth purchasing is up to the viewer.  If you don't already own the best-selling season sets and are just a casual fan, this is worth picking up, but if you do own each season, there is no point in picking this up.",1126569600,37,979,4.680232558139535
2181754,3,B0006B41GM,"Some of it is really of no interest, some of it isn't. With ""American Dad"" out on TV with many episodes shown, the segment of the DVD that gives you insight into that show is really obsolete. I suppose some of the interviews might be interesing for looking for more insight on Seth MacFarlane, or for those who have never seen the man behind the show. The interview about Family Guy Season 4 is interesting in retrospect, I suppose.

The restored ""Road To Rhode Island"" doesn't really make it worth it. It's just the one deleted segment, and it really isn't funny. I notice the first review says ""true fans have to have this scene,"" frankly, I think that's ridiculous and pedantic. If by ""true"" fans, you mean insanely obsessed, then I guess you'd be correct. It's not really offensive, but it doesn't add anything to the episode (which is a good one).

Now, it sounds like my review is completely negative. Why is this worth it?

Well, let me be honest. I love the commentaries on Futurama. I think they're among the best commentaries I've ever heard, and they just add to the rewatch value of the episodes. But a lot of Family Guy commentaries have been... just... blah. Maybe it's because they choose mediocre episodes to do commentaries on ""Ready, Willing, and Disabled,"" ""Death Lives,"" ""Holy Crap,"" etc. But the commentaries on here really make this DVD worth it, I think. The commentary for ""Rhode To Road Island"" - I like it, it's great, it's hilarious, you should hear it. It's already one of my favorite episodes, this just made it better. The ""To Love and Die In Dixie"" commentary was okay, nothing special. But two episodes I'd always wished they had done commentaries on but didn't - ""I Am Peter, Hear Me Roar"" and ""Lethal Weapons"" - they finally did here! Excellent! In particular I thought the ""I Am Peter, Hear Me Roar"" commentary was one of the best they've done. There's nothing new with the ""When You Wish Upon A Weinstein"" from the Season 3 DVD.

In conclusion, the new commentaries make it worth your while to check this DVD out. As for plunking down the money, I could see Family Guy fanatics doing that, easily, I'm not so sure the casual fan will think this is worth the investment. It's definitely worth a video store rental though, absolutely.",1125705600,45,2268,4.620347394540943
2181755,4,B0006B41GM,"People should know what this DVD is before buying it.  Unlike the ""complete"" Family Guy box sets, this DVD only contains 5 episodes.  The Freakin Sweet Collection is marketed for casual fans, and those who don't want to shell out 30 bucks for a Family Guy DVD.  If you are a diehard Family Guy fanatic, this collection is probably not worth it for you.  But if you are a new-comer, and want to see what Family Guy is all about, I strongly recommend buying this DVD.

Family Guy is probably the funniest cartoon on TV right now, and one of the most over the top and original shows ever created.  This DVD contains five episodes handpicked by the creator as the best the series has to offer.  Of course, alot of fans will all disagree on certain choices, but I think the 5 included here are all top quality.

The episodes contain bonous commentary and uncensored scenes that are not included on the other DVDs.  A preivew of American Dad (a new show by the same creators) is also included.  The episodes on this video are as follows:

Road to Rhode Island- A classic Brian and Stewie episode.  Probably the most popular in the series.

When You Wish Upon a Weinstein- The popular banned episode.  Peter hires a Jewish accountant because he believe Jews are good with money.  Filled with lovely offensive humor that made the network too edgy to air it.

To Love and Die in Dixie- Another great episode, this time featuring the Family Guy crew living in the deep South.  Plenty of redneck and confederacy jokes.  Very funny.

I Am Peter Hear Me Roar- This episode rips on feminism.  Peter gets in touch with his inner self and begins to think he is a woman.

Lethal Weapons- Not my favorite episode of all time, but excellent none-the-less.  The fight scene at the end of this episode makes it worth watching alone.

So there you have it.  New comers to Family Guy, buy this DVD and test the waters.  If you like what you see (and you will) go out and buy the box set and prepare to laugh for hours and hours.",1119139200,14,2005,4.427397260273972

The commentary by Brian and Stewie on what is arguably the greatest Family Guy episode ever is well worth the price of the disc.

Talk about your biased review, ive seen all of the eps on this dvd well before i bought it. I have all of the season 1-3 box sets. Why would i buy this you ask. Well, first off i found it on sale for just over 10 bucks at store X. Secondly, i wanted to have the commentary tracks like no other. Thats the real reason i wanted this dvd, ive seen the unedited episode and all that fun stuff before, but to have brian and stewie do the commentary, i just had to have it!! Its hilarious, i love to hear them swear unedited. Theres also commentaries on the other eps that you cant get elsewhere. so if your into the commentarys, then you might enjoy this, if not.. then i wouldnt waste the money. Thats all it really has to offer, now with american dad being on tv all the time no need for that. And the featurettes aren't anything better then what youll find in an online interview with seth. But im still giving it a solid 5 because this is a GREAT collection of eps, some of my favs, and the commentaries are well done, though occasionally lacking. I just cant give it 4 though, which is prolly what it deservs.. but i love it so much its a five-a-roo .. oh yeah.. that was dumb..",1109116800,4,1280,4.083333333333333
2181760,3,B0006B41GM,"Well, although I'm 15, I got this DVD as a Christmas present December 25, 2004. I was thrilled, but got disappointed when I found out that there's only 5 episodes on it to watch. I liked 'em, but I wished that there was about 5-10 more. :( My dad directly told me it was a waste of money when I showed it to him at Wal-Mart. I just didn't care.

So people, if you are just getting started with your [adult swim]'s ""Family Guy"" DVD collection, I would definitely say that this would make a good first-buy into your collection, or at least a good introduction to the show if you are a n00b (newbie) to it. It contains a lot of extra features about the show. But, if you already have the box sets of seasons 1-3, DON'T spend $15.00-$20.00 on this! You aren't missing anything TOO important. :\

This is only a waste of money if you already have the box sets! Otherwise, it's a fairly cheap DVD to start your collection with.",1108771200,,921,4.257142857142857
2181761,2,B0006B41GM,"I'm a big fan of the show, and bought this despite having both DVD sets on the shelf.  Primarily, I was interested in the ""Rhode to Rhode Island"" commentary by Brian and Stewie.  It's a great concept, but falls flat in execution.

The novelty of hearing Brian and Stewie use profanity wore out in about three seconds.  What's left is just not that funny.  There obviously wasn't that much effort put into this track, and that's a shame.  Call this a missed opportunity.

The remainder of the extras are marginally interesting, but unless you're a die-hard, must-have-everything kind of fan, you can pass on this without fear of missing something great.

Instead, take that money and buy ""Greg the Bunny"" on DVD.  Fox may have come to its senses by brining back ""Family Guy"", but they lost a gem when they killed off GtB.",1106179200,7,820,4.638888888888889

2181764,4,B0006B41GM,"Upon first glance, ""The Freakin' Sweet Collection"" could be seen as a waste of money for a Family Guy fan who already owns the first three seasons on DVD. Truth be told, it was a hard sell for me. But when I finally broke down and bought it, I realized that it was more than worth it.

This isn't for a casual Family Guy fan. It's for those of us who scoured the internet for that cut scene from ""Road to Rhode Island"", those of us who listened to all of the commentary on the season sets, and watched the Special Features more than once.

The ""Road to Rhode Island"" commentary by Brian and Stewie makes this DVD a worthy addition to anyone's DVD collection, though only the real collectors out there will appreciate this DVD in the long run.

The only real problem I had with ""The Freakin' Sweet"" collection was the inclusion of ""When You Wish Upon a Weinstein"". Although this is an episode that never aired on television, it seems redundant to include it here, since it is already available on the other DVD's. There isn't even any commentary provided, since it was already done on the Family Guy Vol. 2 [Season Three] DVD set. ""The Freakin' Sweet Collection"" would be a much better buy if a different episode, with commentary, had been added, but overall, this DVD is a must-own for hardcore Family Guy fans and collectors.",1104969600,4,1326,4.4937759336099585

Forcing someone to buy DVD for a restored scene is just ripping the fans off.

If you're a fan, you've already have the boxed sets. If you're not a fan, this DVD will not change your mind.

So, who is FOX trying to convert?",1104278400,8,358,4.235294117647059
2181767,3,B0006B41GM,"Now listen. I am a very huge ""Family Guy"" fan, I bought the whole collection on DVD from amazon.com, except this one. And I think it is not worth fifteen bucks on this DVD, the only thing this DVD makes it worth SOME of the money is the uncut/uncensored version of the episode ""Road to Rhode Island"", which I love by the way, and the comentaries of the fourth season and ""American Dad"". It's not worth it.  SORRY.",1104278400,6,413,4.294871794871795
2181768,3,B0006B41GM,"The Family Guy Freakin' Sweet collection is hard to recommend.

If you're a die hard Family Guy fan (like me), I'm sure you've bought it already and have watched it several times over. However, since I already own all three seasons (which cost me a good $80 dollars or so) I was hesitant to shell out another $20 for this. Now that I do have it though, I honestly feel like it was a waste of $20 hard earned dollars.

However, If you happen to be new to Family Guy and don't want to pay $80 bucks for the box sets only to find you don't really like it, this may be a safer purchase. It contains 5 very good episodes that give a basic definition of what Family Guy is: off the wall non stop comedy, chocked full of pop-culture spoofs and filled with humor on every level.

So what do we get this time around? Five episodes, hand picked by FG creator Seth MacFarlane for this set. ""When You Wish Upon a Weinstein"", ""Road to Rhode Island"", ""Lethal Weapons"", ""I am Peter, Hear Me Roar"", and ""To Love and Die in Dixie"". All of the episodes except ""Weinstein"" include optional commentaries from Seth MacFarlane and other writers/producers/actors from the show. ""RTRI"" includes a commentary from Brain and Stewie, the beloved alcoholic dog and maniacal toddler who helped make the show famous. Special features also include the 6 minute pilot of MacFarlane's new show ""American Dad"", an interview with MacFarlane about American Dad, and an interview with MacFarlane about why he picked these episodes for the DVD.

The DVD is worth it if you want to see the American Dad preview (which I happened to enjoy) or if you want to see the infamous Osama bin Laden segment removed from ""Road to Rhode Island"". Otherwise this is just an average DVD. The commentaries aren't as funny as the ones in the box sets, mostly due to the absence of the one person who made the previous commentaries worth listening to: Seth Green. The biggest disappointment was the Brian/Stewie commentary, which really isn't that great. Yeah there's a couple good jokes, but I like hearing from the creators more than hearing from the characters as they pretend that they actually exist outside the show.

The ads on the DVD case claim there is a big preview for the upcoming season 4. I can tell you now it's a lie. There is no real ""preview"" of season 4. What we get is 20 minutes of Family Guy's creator Seth MacFarlane commenting on his top 5 favorite episodes from seasons 1-3. All we really hear about season 4 is that there is an episode where Stewie meets the man who might be his father. Other than that, we get diddly squat.

So, unless you're a diehard Family Guy fan or someone who just wants a quick taste, I can't recommend this DVD set to you. If you want a truly great FG experience and have the money to do it, get the box sets of seasons 1 - 3.",1104105600,,2824,4.4526112185686655
2181769,5,B0006B41GM,"Family Guy is one of those unique cult series that gained a giant fan base after its untimely cancellation in 2002 by FOX and later resurrected beautifully thanks to sales of the 2 DVD volumes of all three seasons of the show and its success as part of Cartoon Network's ""Adult Swim"" animation block.  This little factor led FOX to reconsider its original cancellation and recommission the show's creator, Seth MacFarlane, to prepare a new 4th season to air sometime next year.

But to tide those that may have already bought the 2 DVD sets (or is still in the dark about what Family Guy is truly all about), MacFarlane chose 5 of his favorite episodes of FG over the first 3 seasons (including the one episode that FOX flat-out refused to air) and released it as the ""Freakin' Sweet Collection"".

The disc contains a few new additions that you won't find in the original DVD sets, including a new uncensored version of the episode ""Road to Rhode Island"" that contains a scene that FOX demanded that MacFarlane edit out since it contained an reference to Osama bin Laden, even though the episode aired 16 months before the 9/11 attacks.  In an eerie strike of coincidence, a small incidental argument with FOX execs caused MacFarlane to miss a flight from Los Angeles to Boston, which would later be one of the planes that smashed into the WTC towers on 9/11.  The episode also contains a new commentary done by both Brian and Stewie that will have you in stitches...

Also included is the controversial episode ""When You Wish Upon a Weinstein"" that FOX never aired due to the fact the network felt that the episode would offend the Jewish community by typecasting Jews to be tightwads and also containing a rather offensive musical number.  The episode did air earlier this year on FOX but was edited, so the one on the DVD is the original unedited version of it.

In addition, there is new commentaries on all the episodes from MacFarlane and many of the crew of FG, a special sneak preview of what we can expect in Season 4 when it airs of FOX next year, and a sneak peek at MacFarlane's brand new series for FOX, American Dad.

If you still need to find out what makes this show so hilarious and controversial to say the least, this is a good start.  If you already own the 3 volumes, then consider this Family Guy Volume 2.5: Special Creator's Cut Edition...",1103932800,8,2363,4.578199052132701

Does this have anything to do with the fact that MacFarlane missed his flight to Los Angeles from Boston, a plane which eventually crashed into the World Trade Center on 9/11?

He apparently missed the flight by a few minutes and drove a rental car to L.A. instead.  Not to be a downer, but if this is a reason for making us pay for one ""uncut"" episode among others, I think it's worth the $13.",1101686400,12,600,4.378378378378378
