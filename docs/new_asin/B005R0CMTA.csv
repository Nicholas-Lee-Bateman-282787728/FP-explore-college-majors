8483955,5,B005R0CMTA,"La conquete is a must see for those drawn to France, including its comtemporary politics.  Done with skill, a light touch, and a great sense of humour, the film portrays the rise of Nicolas Sarkozy to power.  Here you see ""endearing"" portrayals of Dominique de Villepin, Jacque Chirac,  Rachida Datti and other political figures, not to mention Sarkozy, lui meme, and his former wife Cecilia, who is very present.  It is completely entertaining. So, kick off your shoes, sit in a comfortable chair, and enjoy.",1326931200,,509,4.952941176470588
