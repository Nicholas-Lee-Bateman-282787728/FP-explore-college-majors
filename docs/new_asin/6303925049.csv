731361,5,6303925049,"This brings back memories, from over 10 years ago, from my happy ""WIZARD OF OZ"" filled child-hood. This is a wonderful, funny and cool cartoon. *SPOILER ALET* Dorothy is singing about how she misses OZ in a meadow when the storm her aunt and uncle were getting ready for, turns into a roaring black twister, and Dorothy is knocked unconscious by a swinging padock gate. the twister carries her body away (with TOTO) and they get spat out into munchkinland. Dorothy meets a cool signpost, when she decides to go visit the scarecrow who is king of the emerald city. She trips down into a little glen, and meets a pumpkinheaded man, hiding from his witch mistress ""MOMBI"". Dorothy meets Mombi and hears of her plan to conquer the Emerald City and throw the Scarecrow off his throne, by using a herd of giant magical green elephants...all new songs, all new characters (the old ones are there too) and AMAZING BACKDROPS) it's a little cheezey <it was the 1970's! what do you expect???> but it's a fantastic wonderful little show! it's hard to get...but see it! it tops ''RETURN TO OZ'' and definetly tops ''THE WIZ""",975974400,6,1111,4.673469387755102

731434,3,6303925049,"Beating out Disney's Return To Oz by over a decade, this fully-animated ""sequal"" to the original 1939 Wizard Of Oz movie was headed up by Filmation, the same studio that did dozens of Saturday morning cartoons from the 60s-80s. Their main claims to fame were the original DC Super Heroes cartoons, the Star Trek animated series, Fat Albert, and He-Man. The film was headed up by Fredd Ladd, who pioneered alot of the original anime TV shows that were first shown in America, including Astro Boy. During the 60s when he was producing an original movie called Pinocchio In Outer Space, Ladd tried to get an animated followup to WOZ, however it wasn't until 1974 that it was finally released in theatres.

The story takes place sometime after the original movie with Dorothy and Toto being taken to Oz via tornado(again?!), and then head out to the Emerald City. Along the way, she meets Pumpkinhead(not Jack)who is a slave of the evil witch Mombi that ""claims"" to be the cousin of both the deceased Wicked Witches. Mombi plots to kick Scarecrow off the throne with an army of conjured-up green elephants. Dorothy and Pumpkinhead go to warn Scarecrow, and run into an abandonned merry-go-round horse named Woodenhead who is this movie's version of the Sawhorse. They ride their new friend to the Emerald City and alert Scarecrow of the threat. But Mombi and her elephants show up and take over, imprisioning Scarecrow and Toto. Dorothy and the others try to get help from Tin Man and then Lion, both of whom uncharacteristically chicken out. Glinda finally arrives, but says she can't assist Dorothy directly(how convenient!)but gives her a magic box filled with an infinite number of mice to scare the elephants away. Facing defeat, Mombi disguises herself as a flower, only to get trampled on by the panicked packyderms. So Scarecrow is made king of Oz again, Pumpkinhead and Woodenhead get swanky new jobs, and Dorothy and Toto get sent back home thanks to Glinda's magic(so much for magic slippers).

This movie was basically yet another take on the second book, Land Of Oz, although once again Dorothy is added to it when she was never even in the original story at all. There were alot of famous actors who provided voices for it, including Liza Minnelli(Judy Garland's daughter)as Dorothy, Mickey Rooney as Scarecrow, Paul Lynde as Pumpkinhead, Danny Thomas as Tin Man, Milton Berle as Lion, and Ethel Merman as Mombi. The animation was signifigantly better than most Filmation productions, mainly because they hired some additional outside animators from studios like Disney, including Don Bluth. It makes for a pretty enjoyable kids movie, although there's a whole load of mostly unnecessary music numbers thrown in, which if they were left out would've made the movie about thirty minutes shorter. Fans of the Land Of Oz might not like the primary characters of Trot, Jinjur, or Wogglebug being left out, but will probably appreciate the effort made to homage the original book. It was as of recently put on DVD by the now defucnt Ink & Paint, but is still available from most retailers.",1260748800,2,3094,4.902671755725191

It also features a fifteen year old Liza Minnelli picking up where her mother left off. A must for Oz fans. Wonderful.

731437,5,6303925049,"As everyone knows, Judy Garland first played the role of Dorothy in the 1939 masterpiece ""The Wizard of Oz"".  In Journey Back To Oz the torch has been passed to her daughter Liza Minnelli.  Even though Liza only does the voice work for Dorothy I think she did a great job with the character, and It's a treat that Margaret Hamilton returned to do another Oz film even though it was to portray Auntie Em.  I remember that this film was broadcast on T.V. several times years ago and I was always there to enjoy it as a child.  If you are an Oz fan I believe you'll love this movie and already have it as a part of your Oz collection.  For those who are not Oz fans, but animation fans I'd recommend renting it first to see what you think of it.  This film didn't do so well at the box office, but I feel that it has a cult following.",1207785600,7,831,4.067484662576687
731438,4,6303925049,"To hear Lou Scheimer, Hal Sutherland, and Fred Ladd tell it (and they do prattle and yack on endlessly during a dotty DVD commentary track), you would think that ""JOURNEY BACK TO OZ"" is equal in every way to MGM'S 1939
masterpiece ""THE WIZARD OF OZ."" It isn't... but it is a respectable animated sequel. Wacked out Sutherland keeps referring to ""THE WIZARD OF OZ"" as ""The Judy Garland Version.""
  In L. Frank Baum's book ""THE LAND OF OZ"", Wicked Witch Mombi attempts to take over Emerald City and destroy the Scarecrow. She is defeated by a boy named Tip, Jack Pumpkinhead, and Woodenhead the Horse. Tip turns out to be a girl who Mombi transformed into a boy. Tip is actually Ozma, the rightful ruler of Oz, before the Humbug Wizard blew in. Sutherland and Ladd keep this basic plot structure, omit Tip/Ozma entirely, and put Dorothy in his/her place.
  For the film, Dorothy (beautifully voiced by Liza Minnelli) is back in Kansas. She starts to get that old feeling for Oz; a cyclone blows her and Toto back, and she battles Mombi, etc.
  ""JOURNEY BACK"" had quite a journey itself. The excellent voice cast was recorded in 1960. But lack of finances delayed the film for well over a decade. ""JOURNEY BACK"" was finally finished and had a small  theatrical release around 1974. Apparently, nobody saw it. Scheimer, Sutherland, and Ladd sound understandably proud that the film has finally appeared on DVD. While not as magical as in the 1939 MGM live-action masterpiece, Oz is nicely depicted in animation here. The animation is much better than the Hanna-Barbera cheap and quick, Saturday morning TV show style. Apparently, a few of the animators who worked on ""JOURNEY BACK"" were former employees of Disney Studios. The animation was intially began overseas, while the voice cast  was recorded in New York City and Los Angeles.

  I am certainly no fan of that overblown Broadway hag Ethel Merman. But, having said that, Ethel is perfectly cast as animated hag /Witch Mombi. She looks and sounds frightening. Margaret Hamilton, the original Wicked Witch Of The West in 1939,  is briefly heard here as the voice of Aunt Em in Kansas. Paul Lynde is excellent as the voice of (Jack) Pumpkinhead. Mickey Rooney, Judy Garland's old partner at MGM, replaced a mis-cast Peter Lawford, as the voice of the Scarecrow. It is disappointing that (the added in to the film's plot) old friends The Tin Man and Cowardly Lion essentially whimp out on Dorothy when she asks them to help. Glinda (voiced here by opera star Rise Stevens) reappears to tell Dorothy she only has herself to rely on and sing a ho-hum slow ballad.
  At least ""JOURNEY BACK"" does not commit the unforgivable cinematic sins of the 1985 Disney live-action disaster ""RETURN TO OZ."" In that hideous film,  (AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS)  Aunt Em and Uncle Henry take Dorothy in for electric-shock therapy to have all memories of Oz removed from her mind!! Dorothy subsequently escapes to an Oz in serious dis-repair, devoid of joy and music. While the songs in ""JOURNEY BACK"" by Sammy Cahn and James Van Heusen may not be of the same quality, as the perfectly integrated, Academy- Award winning  ""THE WIZARD OF OZ"" score by Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg, it is still nice to hear Liza Minnelli sing such songs as ""Keep A Happy Thought,"" ""That Far-Away Land,"" and ""Feeling For Home"" in perfect ""Dorothy Gale From Kansas"" style. Apparently, Liza has exspressed regret in participating in ""JOURNEY BACK."" True, she sounds almost exactly like her mother Judy Garland did in 1939 here... but there's nothing wrong with that, especially not in this instance. In fact, the vocal similarity is likely the primary reason she was cast to ""voice"" Dorothy in the first place.
  I recommend ""JOURNEY BACK TO OZ"" to fans of Liza Minnelli-- and for Oz fans who would like another adventure/trip. After all, L. Frank Baum wrote 14 Oz book sequels himself.",1199232000,3,3890,4.787742899850524

731463,3,6303925049,"Journey Back to Oz is Filmation's first project, shelved in the 60s, completed in the 70s.

The first half of it is a classy production.  The animation is fluid and very traditional, if unspectacular, but is has a certain charm and some terrific looking artwork.  I like in particular the way Jack Pumpkinhead (voiced by Paul Lynde) and Toto are animated.  The story is loosely based on L.Frank Baum's The Land of Oz, and centers on Mombi the Witch trying to take capture the Emerald City using magical green elephants.  Along the way we meet some cool new characters,  Woodenhead Stallion (the Third, if I remember correctly), (the aformentioned) Jack Pumpkinhead, and a living signpost.

About halfway through the film, Mombi conquers the Emerald City with her elepahnts.  Up til this point, the movie moves at a good, brisk pace.  Sadly it really spirals downward from there.  The problem:  TOO MANY songs and that is ultimately its downfall from a wonderful voice cast.  The cast is star-studded (especially for the 60s/70s) and EVERYONE has a song.  The Lion and Tinman each make pretty much token appearances, and both have pointless songs.  The same with Glinda the good witch, and on and on...  The end result is a film that drags, rather than moves along crisply.

Hard to mention this movie without mentioning that Liza's voiced version of Dorothy is a near perfect mimic of her mothers in the original.

I like this movie, but it's just too long with too many songs.  Still the ending is nice and it is a good first effort from Filmation.

The menu with the signpost guy is really cool (who better to point you in the right direction?) and the extras are great!  Look for the live-action wraparounds with Bill Cosby for when it aired on TV in the 70s and interviews with Filmation founders Lou Scheimer and Hal Sutherland.

Overall, first half 3 stars, second half 1.5 stars.  Worth a look, especially if you like Filmation.",1168300800,5,1935,4.747747747747748
731464,4,6303925049,"JOURNEY BACK TO OZ is a thoroughly delightful animated musical-sequel to THE WIZARD OF OZ, the big highlight being that Liza Minnelli voices the role of Dorothy (the role that catapulted her mother Judy Garland into the annals of film history).

Of course, no animated film could ever replicate the magic and scope of the 1939 masterpiece, but let's not carp. For what it sets out to achieve, JOURNEY BACK TO OZ delivers handsomely.

Dorothy (Liza Minnelli) gets swept back to Oz via another cyclone, and quickly sets about finding her old friends the Scarecrow (Mickey Rooney), Tin Man (Danny Thomas) and Cowardly Lion (Milton Berle). Instead, Dorothy discovers to her horror that an evil witch called Mombi (Ethel Merman) is plotting to invade the Emerald City with a hoard of enchanted green elephants.

With new friends; Jack Pumpkinhead (Paul Lynde) and Woodenhead the carousel horse (Herschel Bernardi), and some guidance from Glinda (Rise Stevens); Dorothy sets out to thwart Mombi and save her old friends from destruction.

The score by Sammy Cahn and Jimmy van Heusen contains some gems; Liza Minnelli sings ""There's a Faraway Land"" and ""That Feeling for Home"", whilst Ethel Merman camps it up with ""Be a Witch"" and Rise Stevens delivers Glinda's ""You Have Only You"" to perfection.

Another cute twist is Margaret Hamilton (who played the Wicked Witch and Miss Gulch in the original Judy Garland classic) voicing the role of Aunt Em!

Originally made and recorded by the Filmation Company in 1962, it was curiously kept out of cinemas until 1974.  This new Special Edition from Brentwood marks the movie's DVD debut.",1159228800,16,1626,5.022304832713755

731466,3,6303925049,"Ok...this was a cute movie, but cute is about all there is to it. Journey Back to Oz was a fluffy clone of the original Judy Garland musical. However, it was missing key elements from said musical, which took away from its magic.

For example, our favorite trio have become shallow and seem to have drifted from one another in their new found success. The Scarecrow seems to be the only one left that has a spine. The Tin Man and the Lion were completely different and wouldn't even help Dorothy when she needed them. They were wildly out of character!

There are some cute songs and with voices like Mickey Rooney, Ethel Merman, and Liza Minelli, how can it go wrong? Well, it's enough to keep the kiddies glued to the screen, but it lacks a good plot. If you're a collector like me however, it's good to have in your collection because it's a rare find.

It's amazing how the project took ten years to complete because the animation leaves much to be desired.

If you're looking for a good sequel, I strongly recommend the 1985 film Return to Oz. It's not a musical, and it's a sequel to the BOOK not the movie. If you're looking for the clone, this is your best bet, but Return to Oz is the real deal. It's much more accurate to Baum's Oz and, while a bit too scary for the babies, the older children will appreciate it.

Also, the 1991 animated series (ABC Sunday morning) can now be purchased on DVD...some episodes anyway. It was very cute and it's much more enjoyable than Journey Back to Oz.

So what's the moral of the story? Oz fans are very hard to please.

731468,3,6303925049,"This long awaited sequel to ""The Wizard of Oz"" may bore some adults who aren't hardcore fans of the original or aren't animation fans in general, but kids and adult Oz fans should be pretty well captivated. In the story, Dorothy returns to Oz in another storm, then quests to visit her friend the Scarecrow, King of Oz. She of course takes the Yellow Brick Road, where she and Toto encounter a witch and make new friends of Pumpkinhead and Woodenhead the Horse. The story plays a lot like the original, except with pretty bad songs. Very dated. Good celebrity voice talents help a bit though, such as Judy Garland's daughter Liza Minnelli in her mom's role. The animation is cute, though not that impressive. It's a fun, retro romp if you're a loyal Oz fan. I ordered it because I always remembered seeing it as a kid, and, being a major Oz fan, I loved it back then. This review comes after I've seen it again as an adult. For my money, the 1985 Disney live-action film ""Return To Oz"" is the one to go with, but it's a dark film that some consider bordering on horror. This is the kiddie version of that film with a couple of the same characters. Anyway, the thing that bothered me about this video was that Dorothy's old friends weren't very eager to help her. No loyalty at all there! That's not how I imagined the Tinman and Lion to be! Overall, though, it's good.

The story goes pretty much the same - Dorothy is transported over the rainbow by a cyclone and is reunited with her old familiar friends. Animation is fine, its just the lack of any real exciting adventure that lets the whole thing down.

Well that Collector's Edition was finally discovered in this 3 disc ""Storybook Tales"" DVD set, along with two other Filmation releases.

The long awaited collector's edition was a bit of a let down, because not only do we have to fork over the extra money for this set with two other movies you may or may not be interested in, instead of getting it by itself, but the interviews with the producers were so bad it was pretty sad. The executive producer lied all over the place about the production, and couldn't even admit it bombed at the box office with such a low return it not only bankrupted Filmation but also 1st National Film Corp. which had just formed 3 years prior. The interview with the screenwriter talked more about his job as a screenwriter than working on the film. The documentary on Filmation was equally annoying, calling Filmation one of the most respected companies in the business.

The vocal auditions for actors for various roles was pretty neat, definitely the second best feature. The DVD-Rom features, the real shining star, include the full script, and the full press release.

Snow White Christmas was another favorite, I believe we used to rent it back in the day when you went to the store to do so. Now that I am a mother, I've wanted to share some of my favorites with my little girl. We found a tape copy of Snow White Christmas at a thrift shop (yes, we do own vcr's still!) and she fell in love with it. However our tape was apparantly warped. The first viewing was fine, but then there were severe lines through much of the middle of the movie. Since my daughter loved it so much, I began searching Amazon and other sites. Not knowing at first if it had ever been released on DVD, you can imagine my shock and dismay at finding it on Amazon on VHS for ... $80! I couldn't justify that kind of expenditure. Luckily an Ebay seach showed me that SWC had been released with two other movies on DVD ... and one happened to be another favorite I wanted to show my daughter (who happens to also love the original Wizard of Oz and Return To Oz starring Fairuza Balk from the 1980's) So, I ordered this with the knowledge she'd get a replacement on a movie she loved, and hopefully more.

We have had these for three days now. She has watched Journey every night since it arrived. And now I have ""If You're Gonna Be A Witch, Be A Witch"" stuck in my head!

So, why did I rate this only four stars?

I don't know who to blame, and it's not the end of the world ... but I rated it so because of the DVD's packaging. When I opened it, the plastic inside was cracked.

I still admired what work went into the animation though the stories themselves did it somewhat poor justice. ""Journey back to Oz"" was more of a masterpiece despite what detractors may say about it, perhaps because of the star talent involved. It was a major special on TV at the time and more work was involved which gave this a much better quality than the others. One can see this in the way the characters looked and even the elephants looked a bit more real in the way they were depicted, as though someone took the time to study them. Certainly, I see very little for anyone to be embarrassed about in this one. It was a bit silly, yes, but some of the songs do grow on you after awhile.
