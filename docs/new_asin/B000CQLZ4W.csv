My kids first saw it at 3 and 4 years old and still watch it at 7 and 8!  They know all the words to the songs and just have a lot of fun with it!  Some of the voices are not the best, but Jenna Fischer and James Gunn contribute voices to the cutest brother and sister rat terrier dogs!  I want to take that little girl dog home with me!  My kids convinced me to get them a dog because of this video, and our Mack is the best thing in our lives now!  Dogs teach kids so much about the good things in life and how to be kinder and better people. Thanks, Lucky!",1461283200,,729,3.7565789473684212

8362748,5,B000CQLZ4W,"There comes a time in ones life, when something so spectacularly beautiful and amazing just fall into your lap.  Lucky's first sleep over is one of those things.  Oscar winning performance by Lucky, a spectacularly crafted plot and character role in his finding new friends during his first time away from home.  The cinematography is truly a delight with its modern yet historical pixelatation really takes you back to the days of Lassie and Mr. Ed.  The directors control of the scenes really showed with all characters keeping from urinating and humping on set.  Watch out rotten tomato, this one is going to remain fresh for many years.",1441584000,2,640,4.888888888888889
8362749,5,B000CQLZ4W,"Every decade or so a movie is released that is an indisputable masterpiece, a work of art so finely crafted it makes the Film Gods weep.  Doggie Tales is one of these very films.  It is the heart wrenching (and warming) tale of one dog's journey of self discovery.  You may dismiss this as a ""kids movie"", but it can be appreciated by audiences of all ages.  Truly the ""Citizen Kane"" of our generation.",1245628800,,402,4.391891891891892
