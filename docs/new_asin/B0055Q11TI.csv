4579419,5,B0055Q11TI,"I totally loved this movie!!!It is honestly one of the best love/ romantic movies I've watched. It made me believe in true sincere love and not to give up on love thats how good it was. It about a bad boy who out of no where meets this good girl and they start falling for each other without them expecting it. Everything about this movie is good, I just didn't like the ending because I thought they would end up together, but it does teach you a few things about love and how its not always easy. I recommend it!!!",1361232000,,516,4.17
4579420,4,B0055Q11TI,"I love this movie, I could watch it over and over again! I highly recommend it, You won't be disappointed! Will def. have friends and family

4579421,5,B0055Q11TI,"This blu-ray is in spanish but has english subtitles. Also, you won't be able to play it unless you have a multi-zone blu-ray player.
Loved the story of the good girl falling for the bad guy... with a twist at the end ;)",1359504000,5,220,4.1395348837209305
4579422,5,B0055Q11TI,"Me encanto esta pelicula. Mario Casas aparte de guapo es un chico con mucho talento, la quimica que tienen l y Maria Valverde es inegable.",1359504000,,138,4.56
4579423,4,B0055Q11TI,I love this movie but this copy i bought doesnt have subtitles. Wish they would have let me know before i bought it :(,1356652800,21,118,3.9583333333333335
4579424,5,B0055Q11TI,"I liked this movie because it presented a different dynamic than most of the other love story movies I've seen.  This love story involves a 'bad boy' type of guy and a middle class prep school girl (high school age?).  So that's the main story of this movie - the way these two different people fall in love and all the rocky moments they go through.  Eventhough, the movie is fiction, but I still walked away learning some lessons as this does happen in real life.  Who knows, maybe other directors will pick up on a scene where there's the ""bad girl"" type and a good guy type, or maybe even an interracial love story, or some other dynamic.

ON a separate note, this movie had beautiful scenary at the beach, and even towards the end at the dance.  The music goes well with many of the scenes.  As a non-Spanish speaker (watched w/ close captioning), I still give this movie 5 stars for a good story line and for how the story played out in the movie!",1350172800,11,953,4.320224719101123
4579425,5,B0055Q11TI,"Absolutely loved this movie.  I happened to pick this movie on demand on cable and hit the jack pot.  This is the story of a very young good guy who rebels after getting into trouble due to family problems.  He then meets and falls in love with a girl who is from a different world from his.  This movie is full of dangerous motorcycle action, violent behavior and true romance.  It's a movie that guy and girls alike can watch. Romance for the girls and danger and action for the guys a great date movie.",1349913600,9,505,4.273684210526316

4579456,1,B0055Q11TI,"Not an original thought in this one.  Spoiled, dumb wealthy girl meets violent, trashy psycho punk (who just ""happens"" to be a clean-cut, tattoo-free, 'sensitive' hunk when he's not trying to kill people). Main female character is an idiot who seems surprised that her boyfriend acts like a lout at times, and her poor mom (trying to keep her daughter from becoming barefoot, abused, & pregnant) is made out to be the villain.  I would add spoilers, but there's not much plot to spoil.  This might appeal to 11-year-old girls who still think that violent criminals are 'romantic', but not to anyone beyond middle school age.  Trust me...you've seen this one many, many times before...and it makes ""Dirty Dancing"" & ""Roadhouse"" look like masterpieces.  This would have been prime fare for MST3000.  Only one redeeming factor...the lead male character demonstrates mad skills at beating up trash cans.",1365206400,,899,5.081632653061225
4579457,5,B0055Q11TI,Mario Casas is a such a great actor and very handsome. This movie made me cry and it made me happy at the same time. Loved it.,1364515200,,126,3.7037037037037037
4579458,5,B0055Q11TI,A hidden treasure for sure. A bad boy biker and an upper middle class woman fall in love. The actors make it work and since it is in Spanish it seems to make it work even more. Mario Casa is hot and handsome. He is perfect for the bad boy biker role. If you like movies in Spanish then this one should be on the top of your list. I watched in on HBO GO.,1361404800,,353,3.72

8458556,1,B0055Q11TI,"I love this movie. The only reason I'm giving one star is because I ordered and PAID for blu-ray and received a regular DVD of this movie. Paid $26 for the blu-ray and they ended up sending DVD version.  Not very happy.

Me encanta esta pelicula. La unica razon por la cual le doy una estrella es porque orden y PAGUE por la version blu-ray de esta pelicula y recibi la pelicula pero en DVD. Pague $26 por blu-ray.

8458557,3,B0055Q11TI,"This movie reminded me a lot of some of the movies made in the US in the 70s and early 80s with a kind of modern day Romeo and Juliet vibe, alot of violence with an on and off teen romance.  The acting was good and lots of pretty faces on cast.  As others have mentioned, there are no English subtitles on this movie disc.",1502323200,,322,3.9384615384615387

8458560,5,B0055Q11TI,"I previously bought the dvd version but wanted to get the blu Ray. This is one of my favorite movies. Mario Casas and Maria Valverde portray two young people that fall in love. Not difficult to accomplish since they actually fell in love in real life and dated for 4 years. I love Mario's funny, dangerous but sentimental personality. You really get to feel for these characters. Overall, this movie is amazing and came in when expected. Very satisfied.",1482796800,,453,4.746835443037975
