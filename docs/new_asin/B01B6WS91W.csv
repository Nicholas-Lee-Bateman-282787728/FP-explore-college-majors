8749446,5,B01B6WS91W,"BOTTOM LINE: A fun, engaging cold war thriller/mystery with a disturbing Twilight Zone-esque vibe. THE WHIP HAND features a bunch of B-movie character greats, with solid direction and good production overall. No frills DVD sports good picture & sound. Recommended. 5 STARS

THE STORY (contains spoilers): A magazine reporter injured while on a weekend fishing vacation seeks treatment in a tiny out of the way town and must spend the night. When he learns that all of the fish in the local lake mysteriously died almost overnight several years ago he smells a story and decides to stick around for a few days. Almost instantly the various townspeople change from quaint folksy eccentrics to cold, whispering co-conspirator types. To his horror, the reporter eventually discovers that the entire town has been stealthily infiltrated by Nazis & Commies plotting to wipe out the USA from within, using germ warfare! Our Hero finds himself constantly watched, the phone lines tapped and his car coincidentally out of commission. Will he be able to get word of the insidious plot to someone outside the isolated little town before he winds up dead and our nation turned into a mass graveyard???

THOUGHTS: This is a terrific little noir-ish film. Feels like an episode of the Twilight Zone in certain spots. The cast is peppered with a wealth of stalwart B-movie thesps who ratchet up the fun factor several notches. Heroic reporter Matt Corbin is played by none other than Elliot Reid, famous as the snarky creep who sought to win the affections of Fred MacMurray's fiance in the original THE ABSENT-MINDED PROFESSOR. Edgar Barrier & Lewis Martin of 1953's WAR OF THE WORLDS fame are on hand, playing a conflicted physician and criminal mastermind, respectively, as well as UNKNOWN WORLD's Otto Waldis, as the vile Nazi doctor. And we'd be remiss if we didn't mention legendary GODZILLA, PERRY MASON, IRONSIDE actor Raymond Burr, as a seemingly genial hotel proprietor who's actually one of the bad guys' main heavies (in more ways than one). The production suffers somewhat from several stagebound ""outdoor"" sets, though a handful of decent location scenes later in the film help offset that. Besides, this film's tense narrative and mounting dread more than make up for any minor imperfections. Overall, THE WHIP HAND is a great little diversion that should keep you engaged right up 'til the very end. A fun film for sure.

THE DVD: Sadly, this is yet another zero extras M.O.D. release from Warner Archives. As annoying as these barebones efforts are, I am still very happy just to have decent physical media copies of some truly obscure, unique, interesting and terrific old films. This one was a blind purchase, and my wife & I both really enjoyed it. Hopefully you will, too.",1479600000,,2778,4.982758620689655
8749447,3,B01B6WS91W,"I have a certain fondness for this goofy Red Scare movie because it is about the only one I know of which is set in the North Woods of Northwest Wisconsin.  I judge this location based on the somewhat crude map of the United States as seen on a big wall of the Kremlin in Moscow where the Soviet bigwigs are meeting at the film's beginning.  The fictional town of Winnoga would be in Wisconsin, not Minnesota as many have thought.  Elliott Reid, acting like a grown-up version of one of Beaver Cleaver's friends, slips on a rock while fishing and cuts open his forehead.  He drives one-handed into Winnoga (the other hand pressing a cloth to his injury), and finds treatment from a doctor played by the semi-foreign sounding Edgar Barrier.  Reid is ""hit by-a the thunderbolt"" when he meets the doctor's lovely sister, played by Carla Balenda.  Then the vacationing reporter takes a room in the hotel of outwardly jovial but inwardly treacherous Raymond Burr.  Reid wants to write a story about how all the fish in the lake died five years previously, but the locals are hiding a nefarious scheme in the heavily-guarded lodge across the lake, and want Reid either gone or dead.  It all culminates in the imminent threat of a commie attack on the big cities of the United States.

  Big Bear Lake in California stands in for the piney and boat-y Winnoga Lake area.  You will relish the pine cones on the ground, the shimmering moonlight on the lake, the cracker barrel general store, and the movie night at the town hall (which strangely begins with gloomy footage of war-shattered buildings and ends with a comical dog and cat spat).  The townies are divided into loyal American old-timers and the disliked come-latelies.  This film is corny and even childish but director and designer William Cameron Menzies gets much visual atmosphere out of claustrophobic close-ups, shadowy comic-book style compositions, and eerie-looking sets, as he would again two years later with ""Invaders From Mars.""",1476316800,,1993,4.84070796460177
8749448,4,B01B6WS91W,"The Whip Hand is a 'cold war' mystery that started life with a different title in 1951. Howard Hughes took over RKO studios and decided to change the villains from Nazi's to communists. RKO studio's was out of business shortly thereafter. The original movie was called 'The Man He Found.' Incidentally the man that is none other than Adolf Hitler, plotting to take over the world. Both versions of this movie have been very difficult to find until recently. I for one, would have like to have seen 'The Man he Found' version, however,  WB has recently released 'The Whip Hand' as part of it's Archive Series. Thus that is the movie being reviewed.

The print quality is very good as are most of the WB Archive Series.

William Cameron Menzies of 'Gone with the Wind' (set design) fame directed this movie. He apparently did not do the set design as he did in Invaders from Mars' and 'Things to Come.' His set designs were often both beautiful and surreal.

The movie opens with a bunch of communists pointing to a map, specificallyat Winoga, Minnesota for some unknown reason. Apparently it is supposed to be near Duluth. They are speaking Russian.  We then see a writer Matt, on a fishing trip in Winoga, Minnesota. Matt hurts his head and heads into town where he is treated coldly. Everybody seems to be in a hurry for him to leave. He soon learns that there are no fish in the lake and that they disappeared about 5 years ago, about the same time a bunch of outsiders moved to the town and bought up most of the land. With the help of the doctor's daughter, Carla, Matt soon learns of a plot to poison the water supply of the United States. While spying he sees a Nobel winning scientist that he previously wrote an article on who has disappeared. From here it's up to Matt to stop the communists.

The acting is somewhat uneven especially Matt's character (Elliot Reid). He starts out as a wimpy writer and turns into an action hero. Raymond Burr, who would soon go on to greater fame in 'Godzilla' and the tv series 'Ironsides.'  is pretty good as the hotel operator and communist, Steve Loomis. Everyone else is decent enough.

I give the movie 3 stars and add another simply for it being made available with a nice print.

Recommended for 50's sci-fi fans. More specifically for those who want a copy of every movie in Warren's authoritative work on 50's sci-fi, 'Keep Watching the Skies.'",1460592000,4,2397,4.568764568764569

8749450,3,B01B6WS91W,"The Whip Hand is a 1951 Anti-Communist film from Eagle films, a subsidiary of RKO, known for their limited budget releases. It stars Elliot Reid and Carla Balenda and the only well known actor was Raymond Burr.

Raymond Burr (1917-93) plays a heavy, which was his normal role prior to the successful Perry Mason series (1957-66) for which he won 2 Emmys. Of his film roles, the killer in Rear Window (1954) is probably his most memorable.

Elliott Reid (1920-2013) plays a reporter who stumbles on a plan to destroy America with biological weapons. Reid is best known as Jane Russells love interest from Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953)

Olive Carey (1896-1988) appears briefly near the end. Carey was the wife of Harry Carey Sr. who was the man who got John Ford his first job and a friend of John Wayne and Ford. Their son, Harry Carey Jr. appeared in dozens of films with one or the other of them, as did she.
Otto Waldis (1901-74) who plays the Nazi/Commie Doctor, has a familiar face, having appeared in over 100 films and TV roles.

William Cameron Menzies (1896-1957) directed this film, but is better known for his art direction for which he won 2 Oscars  The Dove (1927), Tempest (1928) - and was nominated for 3 more. In 1940 he received a special Oscar for his color work on GWTW (1939). This was his 15th of 20 films he directed, the most notable of which were The Thief of Bagdad (1940) and Duel in the Sun (1946).

The film was originally written with the Nazis as the bad guys (with even a cameo from Adolf himself) but studio head Howard Hughes switched it to
the Commies, although they are former Nazis.

1951 was a good year for films. The top grossing films were Quo Vadis, Alice in Wonderland, Show Boat, A Streetcar Named Desire, and David and Bathsheba. Oscars went to The Quiet Man (Director), High Noon (Actor), Come Back Little Sheba (Actress), The Greatest Show on Earth (Picture), and Viva Zapata (Supporting Actor).  Other notable releases that year included The African Queen,  The Day the Earth Stood Still, Murder Inc, and A Place in the Sun.

The most notable anti-communist films from this era are Pickup on South Street (1953) Kiss Me Deadly (1955), I Married a Communist (1950), My Son John (1952), The Fearmakers (1958). Some people believe High Noon (1952) and On the Waterfront (1954) are heavily influenced by anti-communist rhetoric. They also consider many of the invasion films from this era (Man from Planet X, Invaders from Mars) to be allegorical, and certainly The Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) is the best of these.

The Whip Hand is of little interest in any department. Its a B film in the fullest sense of the word.",1455408000,2,2672,4.663829787234042
