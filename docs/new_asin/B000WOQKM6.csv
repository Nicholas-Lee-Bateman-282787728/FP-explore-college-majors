2988875,2,B000WOQKM6,"I am another in the line of people who purchased this DVD and later finding out that both discs were the same. Fortunately I purchased this at a Best Buy store. Took it home, anxious to view the Bonus: Live at The 2005 Monterey Jazz Festival. Then I found out it was the same as the first disc. Returned it the same evening and exchanged it for another. Took it back the next day and told them they may have been sent a ""bad batch"" of DVD's. They didn't want to refund my money at first.
  They said I would have to exchange it for another. I replied that I would do so only on the condition they opened it and played both discs to make sure I received a good copy.
  To make a long story short, I had to DEMAND to speak to the manager. I insisted they either refund my money or order another batch. Needless to say, my money was refunded.
  I really want this DVD. Guess I'll have to wait for the manufacturer to re-release proper copies in the future.",1196812800,6,953,4.124324324324324
2988876,1,B000WOQKM6,"Pre-Ordered this after seeing the PBS special. Bennett is my all time favorite and disk one is absouley wonderful. However as an earlier reviewer noted, the second disc is a duplicate of the first, not the concert performance it is supposed to be. Having this corrected by Amazon is an impossibility. Just try to get a human to respond to your problem. My advice is not to waste your $ now on amazon and wait to see if warner video realizes what they've done. Get it from an actual store that can address the problem if your copy has the error.",1196812800,24,544,4.396039603960396
2988877,5,B000WOQKM6,"""You want it for Christmas?"" my wife asked, after spotting a small, full-color ad for this DVD package in our ""National Post"" newspaper.  And while she shopped at Sears for a red dress yesterday, I dropped into the next-door Wal-Mart (ostensibly to see the new ""Eagles"" CD - ""available exclusively, for under 12 dollars!"").  And there it was: stacks and stacks of ""Clint Eastwood Presents Tony Bennett: The Music Never Ends TWO-DISC Special Edition"" And well . . . I couldn't wait till Christmas to enjoy!

After my son put up our (artificial) tree -- as he always does -- and had strung the hundreds of (clear) lights . . . in preparation for his two children coming over today to decorate it (as only they can) . . . then we sat down to watch this show: 'Spellbinding,' is the word that springs to mind.

First things first: No performer in the history of American popular music has ever  been better `celebrated' in a made-for-TV production than by this (2007) ""American Masters"" PBS special.

Lovingly produced -- with the highest conceivable professionalism -- by Academy Award-winning film director Clint Eastwood (narration by his friend and fellow Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins)  this double-disc `treasure' provides more than two hours of terrific entertainment -- ""for the whole family,"" as they used to say. I say it's `guaranteed' to stand up to repeated viewing. And though it contains not a word about Christmas, this will always be a happy `seasonal' association for me. No program has come closer to capturing the ""magic"" way in which Tony Bennett manages to appeal to each new generation of audiences!

I remembered seeing portions of the progam on the original PBS special (at the heart of this new package) earlier this year; but had already  forgotten (or missed seeing) so many wonderful details - the sort you always see `the second time around.'

So many highlights! Where to begin?

Oh, let's start with the delightful film clips, from movie-musicals -- starring the likes of Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire --  all of them beautifully re-mastered in glorious sound and perfect color.

And the celebrity interviews! -- funny and fascinating . . . plus amazing clips from TV shows - maybe the best of which is Alec Baldwin's ""Saturday Night Live"" impersonation of Tony Bennett, as a talk-show ""mirror-image"" of the singer (thanks to an incredible make-up job that breaks up Tony (who compliments him on his `nose job' before they sing a duet whose every second word is ""great!"").

Those interviews, with Tony's celebrity admirers, are beautifully interwoven with excerpts from the singer's  many ""live"" TV performances;  included are some endearingly serious comments from otherwise funny-men, like Don Rickles and Mel Brooks.

Rickles deadpans that, ""Frank was the King: Tony would be the first one to say it. Frank adored Tony: I think he thought, in his mind, that he could `pass the torch' to Tony, and he did. I think Tony was the last remnants of what Sinatra was all about.""

Mel Brooks (was there ever a more expressive face?) tells us, ""When I grew up I think my favorite singer was . . . a toss-up between Louis Armstrong and Bing Crosby: They BOTH thrilled Frank singing, `I'll Never Smile Again') -- There was this little guy, `Sinatra' . . . and he kept getting better and better!  And then . . . hot on HIS heels, was this other little Italian . . . Tony Benedetto. And HE was obviously the `heir apparent.' Maybe Sinatra was `King'  . . . but Tony was always `Crown Prince'.""

Immediately we see a clip of Sinatra, circa 1966 --  a live, color-TV broadcast - featuring a snippet of his (Count Basie Band) swing arrangement of ""Fly Me to the Moon."" That's followed by Tony Bennett's most recent ""live"" performance (with gorgeous, solo `rubato' jazz guitar accompaniment (available later, in its entirety, among 14 tracks comprising Disc 2 of this package: ""TONY BENNETT'S CONCERT PERFORMANCE AT THE 2005 MONTEREY JAZZ FESTIVAL"").

The distinguished voice of narrator Anthony Hopkins then provides some historical perspective, accompanying B&W photos of the ""Sinatra and Benedetto families.""

Hopkins says, in a voice-over, (he doesn't appear on camera) ""Frank Sinatra has said that, what he finally hit upon - in his approach to singing - was that `one should pay attention to the Bel Canto, Italian school of singing.' This insight - among others - led to Frank's words of praise about Tony Bennett in LIFE magazine. Frank Sinatra said, `For my money, Tony Bennett is the best singer in the business - the best exponent of the song.  He excites me when I watch him; he moves me. He's the singer who gets across what the composer has in mind - and probably a little more. There's a (real) feeling in back of it'.""

On camera, Tony Bennett says,  ""And that is why I started this school - the `Frank Sinatra School of the Performing Arts.' He was my best friend in the whole world . . . and he was so wonderful to me through all the years: His `endorsing' me, changed my whole career by having everybody get interested in what I was doing.""

Songwriter Alan Bergman -- who with wife Marilyn composed several Sinatra hits, beginning with ""NICE `N' EASY"" just before they were married, says:  ""I remember calling Tony -- Marilyn and I  -- we called Tony after Frank had died, and we said: `Tony - you're responsible now!' (for the legacy). Tony is kind-of `synonymous' now, with `The Great American Songbook.""

-----

At select intervals (throughout the first DVD) we see Tony Bennett `alone together' with Clint  Eastwood -- sitting alongside the piano, upon which - eventually -- Eastwood plays a few hesitant chords of accompaniment to one of Tony's early hits.

For those of us who've never heard either man speak, at any great length, one is struck by the sensitivity and the gentle intelligence displayed by two older men (one in his 80s, the other in his 70s) as they elicit insights and good humor from each other. Clearly, each man considers the other a genius in his own right: They listen carefully, with a quiet reverence - to each other's thoughts. It's a fascinating dialogue.

And what a delight to find that `interplay' in its entirety as the ""Bonus Feature"" on this DVD - 37 minutes of Clint & Tony at their reflective best,  trading anecdotes about favorite actors, singers and jazz performers.

Frank Sinatra and Jimmy Durante are singled out for special praise, along with a `current musical genius' --  Stevie Wonder, now a good friend of Tony's. (They shared a 2006 GRAMMY award, for Bennett's best-selling ""Duets"" CD, Number 1 at Amazon.com for several weeks last year.)

Throughout the `special feature' extended dialog, Eastwood sits at the keyboard --  wearing a sage-colored golf shirt, his glasses folded and hanging from a shirt button; Tony -- seated to his right --  looks casually resplendent, in white dress-shirt and a golden-yellow jacket. Among their shared insights:

TONY: ""A good example I tell all young musicians (about putting your heart into each-and-every performance) - I tell them that Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews when they did MY FAIR LADY - such a smash Broadway show! . . . Well they had to do it, like EVERY performance was `Opening Night.' That `flatness' (that wants to creep in) has to simply disappear . . . it has to be just like `The first time you've ever done it'.""

CLINT: ""Yeah that's an interesting analogy . . .  because that IS the thing that astounds most people about `live' theatre: How do you do it? Day-in, day-out --- sometimes twice-a-day!""

TONY: (chuckles) ""Yeah -- a little inhuman!"" (he later recalls doing ""seven shows in one day - from 10:00 in the morning till 10 at night!"")

CLINT: `But you have to make it interesting for YOURSELF before it becomes interesting for the audience! And of course, as you performed at that venue last night, (Monterey Jazz Festival, September 17, 2005) ""it was so spectacular!

""And something happened that I'd never seen before: You were singing about `Fly Me to the Moon,' and all of a sudden the moon comes out from behind the clouds (TONY laughs)  - the full moon!!  And suddenly the whole audience is just `ooh-ing and ahh-ing' -- and it was really a moment (for people) to talk about.""

We're taken immediately, to that magic moment of the previous night's ""live"" performance:  Tony looks up at the moon, as it suddenly emerges from a cloudy sky over Monterey, just as he sings the words, ""Fly Me to the Moon.""  There's a collective gasp, and some woops of joy, from the enraptured audience - sharing in Tony's obvious delight at this happy `coincidence.'  The ""greatest living popular singer"" grins a dignified grin . . . but keeps singing -- without missing a beat; as if to say,  ""Well, what can you expect, on a magic night like this?""

Share the magic, I say. Prediction: You will enjoy repeat viewings of this new `Gold Standard' for musical biography.

2988878,2,B000WOQKM6,"The 1st DVD is wonderful.

However there are apparently a whole bunch of the 2nd DVD labeled as the 2005 Monterey Jazz Concert but it is an exact duplicate of the main DVD.

Who do we appeal this to get what we paid for???  No phone number listed for Warner Home Video or Red Envelope Entertainment.  Who reimburses our return postage?",1195430400,8,335,4.442622950819672
2988879,4,B000WOQKM6,"I didn't know what to expect as I opened the wrapper to this DVD. I have listened to Tony Bennett for years, but knew very little about him. Having seen that Clint Eastwood had produced this DVD and knowing how much Eastwood enjoys jazz, I was intrigued.

I watched this DVD with a couple of co-workers on our lunch break. We all enjoyed it very much. It brought back memories for all of us -- not because we were old enough to remember way back when Tony Bennett began his career -- but because his career has spanned so many years. The footage used to illustrate Tony's career climb is marvelous and truly sets the tone of the video. This DVD is about the man -- and his music. You see Bennett not only as a musician, but as a painter and citizen of the arts. You also see his ups and downs, how his son helped him re-invent himself and how he has adapted to today's musical environment.

This DVD is well worth the price for those who have an ear for good music and have a desire to walk down memory lane with one of the premiere singers of the century.",1195257600,,1056,4.197044334975369

2988882,4,B000WOQKM6,"Based on the single-disk package:

Of the many documentaries based on Tony Bennett's artistry -- and there have been many -- this is perhaps the most entertaining, inclusive and nostalgic. Except for the occasionally choppy edit, the movie tracks Bennett's career from 1949 to 2006 through dozens of segments featuring Sinatra, Basie, Durante, Astaire, Belafonte --and excepts from Bennett's appearances on SNL, The Ed Sullivan Show, The Tonight Show, and live clips from performances in at least a dozen great venues.

The film is also one of the few to address the singer's participation in the Civil Rights Movement and career during the Second World War.  The music is fabulous, and the total production polished and engaging.

Oh--but I'd skip those extras, folks (in the single-disk set) except for a promising vocal performance by Antonia Bennett. The outtakes, entitled ""Clint and Tony at the Piano"" offer clips of some of the most vapid conversation between two creative artists I've ever seen. Eastwood (the producer) seems awed in the presence of Bennett and has difficulty putting  sentences together. Don't get me wrong.  He is a superb filmmaker and pianist, but the extra segments in which he appears here are simply embarrassing.  Were it not for these, I'd give this package 5 stars.",1191542400,9,1300,5.132701421800948

Wish Clint would comb his hair! Very clever juxtapositioning of other artists between Bennett's singing his signature songs. Bennett has aged extremely well, and in my opinion, sings better now than he did decades ago, a palatable huskiness that only emphasizes his style, so what if his voice breaks on a note now and then - it's the one and only, it's Tony Bennett!",1189814400,6,566,4.90625

How can one complain about this marvelously gifted singer?

Why do I think I might have just seen and heard it yesterday?
Was it composed only of singers?
Was it only artists?
Was it profound thinkers?
Was it clarity of thought or question?
Did it take you some where in order to remove you from somewhere else?
Did it take you apart or put you together?
Did it bring you to some unexplainable place in or out of your self?
Is it a clarity of expression, question, lyric or was it an inescapable melody?
Where are or were we when the morning stars sang together, and the Lord laid the foundation of the earth?
Was it the beginning of the end or must it have been the end of the beginning?

The most amazing inquisitors, thinkers, artists and pioneers seem to have come together to explore the subject at the end of 2012 having fallen into some kind of Divine melting pot of inquiry. All I know is that yesterday when I first became aware of it it struck me as a musical inquisition which may never again be assembled in the future of musical history.

You just have to have been there. The interplay of artists, thinkers, moments, honors, and songs are heart stopping beyond believe. We may never see this again in such profundity, and revelatory brilliance - not for or a thousand years to come!

2988898,5,B000WOQKM6,"This film, directed by Clint Eastwood, is a great tribute to a great artist and a wonderful man.
His singing is still so superb! I recently experienced him live in concert at 84 years old and he sounded even better than on this DVD which was shot a few years ago!
If you love Tony, you'll want to add this film to your collection!",1309824000,2,330,4.171875
2988899,5,B000WOQKM6,"I'll confess that I fast-forwarded past the more formulaic material--e.g. the Belafonte and Talese interviews about Tony as civil rights pioneer, the stories about his humble beginnings, the endless testimonials about his musical excellence (from Bill Charlap to--in a rare flattering portrait of the producer-oboe player, Mitch Miller!), but there's simply too much good footage (much of it in seductive, colorful hi def) to make this expendable viewing, whether for an ardent Bennett fan or a more ""casual"" admirer of his music.

One wishes that for once the writers wouldn't shy away from some up-close, critical, play-by-play analysis of a specific performance or two if only to  demonstrate the taste, presentation, and interpretive excellence that so many of the general testimonials call attention to.  (I'd swap the whole movie for a ten-minute glimpse of an intense rehearsal between Tony and either Ralph Sharon or Bill Evans.)  The brief clip of Tony and Evans whets the appetite for much more, and Tony's metaphor for Bill's playing--""it was like an ocean""--is practically the same as that used by Marian McPartland after playing with Bill on an episode of ""Piano Jazz.""  To paraphrase the host roughly: ""You created such a powerful surge, such an irresistible undercurrent, that I forgot I was playing the piano!""

In any case, there's no question but that the film, including the script, will delight the choir who purchase or rent it--it's probably safe to say it places T.B. not below but on the same pedestal as Crosby and Sinatra. And what's not deniable is that shots from 20 or even 35 years ago--showing Tony in the company of Bob Hope, Pearl Bailey, Bill Evans, Johnny Carson--and looking contemporaneous if not older than them--serve to emphasize his extraordinary staying power.  Tony Bennett certainly knew disappointment, tragedy, despair even if he never surrendered to it.  The film might have scored a few dramatic points by probing those moments in Tony's life. But unlike so many other performers, Bennett's was a life characterized by resilience: however depressed he may have been during a few rough patches, it's doubtful he came close to being down for the count.

 In ""Frank: The Voice"" James Kaplan stresses above all Sinatra's ""genius"" and his singular ability to create spine-tingling moments in album after album, song after song.  Tony Bennett has his own special brilliance, and some of his most spine-tingling moments are to be found on relatively ignored sessions like ""On Holiday,"" ""Jazz,"" and ""The Playground.""  But added to that is his humility and sincerity--which is no less apparent during a Bennett concert than the swagger in a Sinatra performance.  Add to that his natural talent--perhaps exceeding that of the self-punishing, perfectionist Sinatra, who made the phrasing, the breath support, the sound of each and every vowel and consonant an obsessive priority. (One often has the sense that Crosby and Bennett could afford to live with some open-ended moments, leaving a few items to chance, thanks to their absolute trust in their own formidable talents.  Sinatra, on the other hand, worked his material harder than other gifted performers--hence his incongruous indebtedness to the artful Mabel Mercer as an influence in his learning to sing with the naturalness and believability, the story-telling communicativeness of a Billie Holiday.)

Perhaps as a result of a more ""natural"" gift, Bennett could widen his horizons, explore the music of America's great composers, performers, and jazz artists more completely than other performers.  His aim was not perfection, merely, but ""continuity,"" adding yet another chapter to the story of a proud and distinctive tradition--an ""entertainment"" that he was not too self-absorbed or uninformed about not to recognize and openly acknowledge as a unique American art form.  (The outstanding moment in the film for this viewer was the cross-cutting sequence between Gene Kelley's dancing from ""An American in Paris"" and Tony's celebration of Kelly's ""foreign"" expressiveness--the whole segment emphasizing Bennett's own continuation of an ever fresh tradition compared to which the French contribution instantly pales.)

Perfection has its attributes but so does resilience. Without marginalizing his extraordinary good fortune in fathering a son who happened to be the world's most savvy business agent, Tony never required much more than a gig--or a party.  From there, the stage, the room, the studio were all his.

(Mitch Miller may come off more sympathetically in this film than in some accounts, but he's not necessarily any righter.  It's highly questionable whether Tony's range, as Mitch claims, has dropped--the juxtaposition of Tony and Frank performing ""Fly Me to the Moon"" certainly leaves no doubt about who's the tenor and who's the baritone.)",1305849600,,4857,5.322875816993464

3223374,5,B000WOQKM6,"""You want it for Christmas?"" my wife asked, after spotting a small, full-color ad for this DVD package in our ""National Post"" newspaper.  And while she shopped at Sears for a red dress yesterday, I dropped into the next-door Wal-Mart (ostensibly to see the new ""Eagles"" CD - ""available exclusively, for under 12 dollars!"").  And there it was: stacks and stacks of ""Clint Eastwood Presents Tony Bennett: The Music Never Ends TWO-DISC Special Edition"" And well . . . I couldn't wait till Christmas to enjoy!

After my son put up our (artificial) tree -- as he always does -- and had strung the hundreds of (clear) lights . . . in preparation for his two children coming over today to decorate it (as only they can) . . . then we sat down to watch this show: 'Spellbinding,' is the word that springs to mind.

First things first: No performer in the history of American popular music has ever  been better `celebrated' in a made-for-TV production than by this (2007) ""American Masters"" PBS special.

Lovingly produced -- with the highest conceivable professionalism -- by Academy Award-winning film director Clint Eastwood (narration by his friend and fellow Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins)  this double-disc `treasure' provides more than two hours of terrific entertainment -- ""for the whole family,"" as they used to say. I say it's `guaranteed' to stand up to repeated viewing. And though it contains not a word about Christmas, this will always be a happy `seasonal' association for me. No program has come closer to capturing the ""magic"" way in which Tony Bennett manages to appeal to each new generation of audiences!

I remembered seeing portions of the progam on the original PBS special (at the heart of this new package) earlier this year; but had already  forgotten (or missed seeing) so many wonderful details - the sort you always see `the second time around.'

So many highlights! Where to begin?

Oh, let's start with the delightful film clips, from movie-musicals -- starring the likes of Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire --  all of them beautifully re-mastered in glorious sound and perfect color.

And the celebrity interviews! -- funny and fascinating . . . plus amazing clips from TV shows - maybe the best of which is Alec Baldwin's ""Saturday Night Live"" impersonation of Tony Bennett, as a talk-show ""mirror-image"" of the singer (thanks to an incredible make-up job that breaks up Tony (who compliments him on his `nose job' before they sing a duet whose every second word is ""great!"").

Those interviews, with Tony's celebrity admirers, are beautifully interwoven with excerpts from the singer's  many ""live"" TV performances;  included are some endearingly serious comments from otherwise funny-men, like Don Rickles and Mel Brooks.

Rickles deadpans that, ""Frank was the King: Tony would be the first one to say it. Frank adored Tony: I think he thought, in his mind, that he could `pass the torch' to Tony, and he did. I think Tony was the last remnants of what Sinatra was all about.""

Mel Brooks (was there ever a more expressive face?) tells us, ""When I grew up I think my favorite singer was . . . a toss-up between Louis Armstrong and Bing Crosby: They BOTH thrilled Frank singing, `I'll Never Smile Again') -- There was this little guy, `Sinatra' . . . and he kept getting better and better!  And then . . . hot on HIS heels, was this other little Italian . . . Tony Benedetto. And HE was obviously the `heir apparent.' Maybe Sinatra was `King'  . . . but Tony was always `Crown Prince'.""

Immediately we see a clip of Sinatra, circa 1966 --  a live, color-TV broadcast - featuring a snippet of his (Count Basie Band) swing arrangement of ""Fly Me to the Moon."" That's followed by Tony Bennett's most recent ""live"" performance (with gorgeous, solo `rubato' jazz guitar accompaniment (available later, in its entirety, among 14 tracks comprising Disc 2 of this package: ""TONY BENNETT'S CONCERT PERFORMANCE AT THE 2005 MONTEREY JAZZ FESTIVAL"").

The distinguished voice of narrator Anthony Hopkins then provides some historical perspective, accompanying B&W photos of the ""Sinatra and Benedetto families.""

Hopkins says, in a voice-over, (he doesn't appear on camera) ""Frank Sinatra has said that, what he finally hit upon - in his approach to singing - was that `one should pay attention to the Bel Canto, Italian school of singing.' This insight - among others - led to Frank's words of praise about Tony Bennett in LIFE magazine. Frank Sinatra said, `For my money, Tony Bennett is the best singer in the business - the best exponent of the song.  He excites me when I watch him; he moves me. He's the singer who gets across what the composer has in mind - and probably a little more. There's a (real) feeling in back of it'.""

On camera, Tony Bennett says,  ""And that is why I started this school - the `Frank Sinatra School of the Performing Arts.' He was my best friend in the whole world . . . and he was so wonderful to me through all the years: His `endorsing' me, changed my whole career by having everybody get interested in what I was doing.""

Songwriter Alan Bergman -- who with wife Marilyn composed several Sinatra hits, beginning with ""NICE `N' EASY"" just before they were married, says:  ""I remember calling Tony -- Marilyn and I  -- we called Tony after Frank had died, and we said: `Tony - you're responsible now!' (for the legacy). Tony is kind-of `synonymous' now, with `The Great American Songbook.""

-----

At select intervals (throughout the first DVD) we see Tony Bennett `alone together' with Clint  Eastwood -- sitting alongside the piano, upon which - eventually -- Eastwood plays a few hesitant chords of accompaniment to one of Tony's early hits.

For those of us who've never heard either man speak, at any great length, one is struck by the sensitivity and the gentle intelligence displayed by two older men (one in his 80s, the other in his 70s) as they elicit insights and good humor from each other. Clearly, each man considers the other a genius in his own right: They listen carefully, with a quiet reverence - to each other's thoughts. It's a fascinating dialogue.

And what a delight to find that `interplay' in its entirety as the ""Bonus Feature"" on this DVD - 37 minutes of Clint & Tony at their reflective best,  trading anecdotes about favorite actors, singers and jazz performers.

Frank Sinatra and Jimmy Durante are singled out for special praise, along with a `current musical genius' --  Stevie Wonder, now a good friend of Tony's. (They shared a 2006 GRAMMY award, for Bennett's best-selling ""Duets"" CD, Number 1 at Amazon.com for several weeks last year.)

Throughout the `special feature' extended dialog, Eastwood sits at the keyboard --  wearing a sage-colored golf shirt, his glasses folded and hanging from a shirt button; Tony -- seated to his right --  looks casually resplendent, in white dress-shirt and a golden-yellow jacket. Among their shared insights:

TONY: ""A good example I tell all young musicians (about putting your heart into each-and-every performance) - I tell them that Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews when they did MY FAIR LADY - such a smash Broadway show! . . . Well they had to do it, like EVERY performance was `Opening Night.' That `flatness' (that wants to creep in) has to simply disappear . . . it has to be just like `The first time you've ever done it'.""

CLINT: ""Yeah that's an interesting analogy . . .  because that IS the thing that astounds most people about `live' theatre: How do you do it? Day-in, day-out --- sometimes twice-a-day!""

TONY: (chuckles) ""Yeah -- a little inhuman!"" (he later recalls doing ""seven shows in one day - from 10:00 in the morning till 10 at night!"")

CLINT: `But you have to make it interesting for YOURSELF before it becomes interesting for the audience! And of course, as you performed at that venue last night, (Monterey Jazz Festival, September 17, 2005) ""it was so spectacular!

""And something happened that I'd never seen before: You were singing about `Fly Me to the Moon,' and all of a sudden the moon comes out from behind the clouds (TONY laughs)  - the full moon!!  And suddenly the whole audience is just `ooh-ing and ahh-ing' -- and it was really a moment (for people) to talk about.""

We're taken immediately, to that magic moment of the previous night's ""live"" performance:  Tony looks up at the moon, as it suddenly emerges from a cloudy sky over Monterey, just as he sings the words, ""Fly Me to the Moon.""  There's a collective gasp, and some woops of joy, from the enraptured audience - sharing in Tony's obvious delight at this happy `coincidence.'  The ""greatest living popular singer"" grins a dignified grin . . . but keeps singing -- without missing a beat; as if to say,  ""Well, what can you expect, on a magic night like this?""

Share the magic, I say. Prediction: You will enjoy repeat viewings of this new `Gold Standard' for musical biography.

I watched this DVD with a couple of co-workers on our lunch break. We all enjoyed it very much. It brought back memories for all of us -- not because we were old enough to remember way back when Tony Bennett began his career -- but because his career has spanned so many years. The footage used to illustrate Tony's career climb is marvelous and truly sets the tone of the video. This DVD is about the man -- and his music. You see Bennett not only as a musician, but as a painter and citizen of the arts. You also see his ups and downs, how his son helped him re-invent himself and how he has adapted to today's musical environment.

This DVD is well worth the price for those who have an ear for good music and have a desire to walk down memory lane with one of the premiere singers of the century.",1195257600,,1056,4.197044334975369

3223379,4,B000WOQKM6,"Based on the single-disk package:

Of the many documentaries based on Tony Bennett's artistry -- and there have been many -- this is perhaps the most entertaining, inclusive and nostalgic. Except for the occasionally choppy edit, the movie tracks Bennett's career from 1949 to 2006 through dozens of segments featuring Sinatra, Basie, Durante, Astaire, Belafonte --and excepts from Bennett's appearances on SNL, The Ed Sullivan Show, The Tonight Show, and live clips from performances in at least a dozen great venues.

The film is also one of the few to address the singer's participation in the Civil Rights Movement and career during the Second World War.  The music is fabulous, and the total production polished and engaging.

Oh--but I'd skip those extras, folks (in the single-disk set) except for a promising vocal performance by Antonia Bennett. The outtakes, entitled ""Clint and Tony at the Piano"" offer clips of some of the most vapid conversation between two creative artists I've ever seen. Eastwood (the producer) seems awed in the presence of Bennett and has difficulty putting  sentences together. Don't get me wrong.  He is a superb filmmaker and pianist, but the extra segments in which he appears here are simply embarrassing.

Why do I think I might have just seen and heard it yesterday?
Was it composed only of singers?
Was it only artists?

Was it clarity of thought or question?
Did it take you some where in order to remove you from somewhere else?
Did it take you apart or put you together?
Did it bring you to some unexplainable place in or out of your self?
Is it a clarity of expression, question, lyric or was it an inescapable melody?
Where are or were we when the morning stars sang together, and the Lord laid the foundation of the earth?
Was it the beginning of the end or must it have been the end of the beginning?

The most amazing inquisitors, thinkers, artists and pioneers seem to have come together to explore the subject at the end of 2012 having fallen into some kind of Divine melting pot of inquiry. All I know is that yesterday when I first became aware of it it struck me as a musical inquisition which may never again be assembled in the future of musical history.

You just have to have been there. The interplay of artists, thinkers, moments, honors, and songs are heart stopping beyond believe. We may never see this again in such profundity, and revelatory brilliance - not for or a thousand years to come!

3223395,5,B000WOQKM6,"This film, directed by Clint Eastwood, is a great tribute to a great artist and a wonderful man.
His singing is still so superb! I recently experienced him live in concert at 84 years old and he sounded even better than on this DVD which was shot a few years ago!
If you love Tony, you'll want to add this film to your collection!",1309824000,2,330,4.171875
3223396,5,B000WOQKM6,"I'll confess that I fast-forwarded past the more formulaic material--e.g. the Belafonte and Talese interviews about Tony as civil rights pioneer, the stories about his humble beginnings, the endless testimonials about his musical excellence (from Bill Charlap to--in a rare flattering portrait of the producer-oboe player, Mitch Miller!), but there's simply too much good footage (much of it in seductive, colorful hi def) to make this expendable viewing, whether for an ardent Bennett fan or a more ""casual"" admirer of his music.

One wishes that for once the writers wouldn't shy away from some up-close, critical, play-by-play analysis of a specific performance or two if only to  demonstrate the taste, presentation, and interpretive excellence that so many of the general testimonials call attention to.  (I'd swap the whole movie for a ten-minute glimpse of an intense rehearsal between Tony and either Ralph Sharon or Bill Evans.)  The brief clip of Tony and Evans whets the appetite for much more, and Tony's metaphor for Bill's playing--""it was like an ocean""--is practically the same as that used by Marian McPartland after playing with Bill on an episode of ""Piano Jazz.""  To paraphrase the host roughly: ""You created such a powerful surge, such an irresistible undercurrent, that I forgot I was playing the piano!""

In any case, there's no question but that the film, including the script, will delight the choir who purchase or rent it--it's probably safe to say it places T.B. not below but on the same pedestal as Crosby and Sinatra. And what's not deniable is that shots from 20 or even 35 years ago--showing Tony in the company of Bob Hope, Pearl Bailey, Bill Evans, Johnny Carson--and looking contemporaneous if not older than them--serve to emphasize his extraordinary staying power.  Tony Bennett certainly knew disappointment, tragedy, despair even if he never surrendered to it.  The film might have scored a few dramatic points by probing those moments in Tony's life. But unlike so many other performers, Bennett's was a life characterized by resilience: however depressed he may have been during a few rough patches, it's doubtful he came close to being down for the count.

 In ""Frank: The Voice"" James Kaplan stresses above all Sinatra's ""genius"" and his singular ability to create spine-tingling moments in album after album, song after song.  Tony Bennett has his own special brilliance, and some of his most spine-tingling moments are to be found on relatively ignored sessions like ""On Holiday,"" ""Jazz,"" and ""The Playground.""  But added to that is his humility and sincerity--which is no less apparent during a Bennett concert than the swagger in a Sinatra performance.  Add to that his natural talent--perhaps exceeding that of the self-punishing, perfectionist Sinatra, who made the phrasing, the breath support, the sound of each and every vowel and consonant an obsessive priority. (One often has the sense that Crosby and Bennett could afford to live with some open-ended moments, leaving a few items to chance, thanks to their absolute trust in their own formidable talents.  Sinatra, on the other hand, worked his material harder than other gifted performers--hence his incongruous indebtedness to the artful Mabel Mercer as an influence in his learning to sing with the naturalness and believability, the story-telling communicativeness of a Billie Holiday.)

Perhaps as a result of a more ""natural"" gift, Bennett could widen his horizons, explore the music of America's great composers, performers, and jazz artists more completely than other performers.  His aim was not perfection, merely, but ""continuity,"" adding yet another chapter to the story of a proud and distinctive tradition--an ""entertainment"" that he was not too self-absorbed or uninformed about not to recognize and openly acknowledge as a unique American art form.  (The outstanding moment in the film for this viewer was the cross-cutting sequence between Gene Kelley's dancing from ""An American in Paris"" and Tony's celebration of Kelly's ""foreign"" expressiveness--the whole segment emphasizing Bennett's own continuation of an ever fresh tradition compared to which the French contribution instantly pales.)

Perfection has its attributes but so does resilience. Without marginalizing his extraordinary good fortune in fathering a son who happened to be the world's most savvy business agent, Tony never required much more than a gig--or a party.  From there, the stage, the room, the studio were all his.

(Mitch Miller may come off more sympathetically in this film than in some accounts, but he's not necessarily any righter.  It's highly questionable whether Tony's range, as Mitch claims, has dropped--the juxtaposition of Tony and Frank performing ""Fly Me to the Moon"" certainly leaves no doubt about who's the tenor and who's the baritone.)",1305849600,,4857,5.322875816993464

3223400,5,B000WOQKM6,I purchased this as a gift after seeing it on PBS--I just had to share it with someone who loves the music of Tony  Bennett as much as I. Hope they will have me over to hear it again!!,1270684800,,184,3.717948717948718
3223401,2,B000WOQKM6,"Ive ordered 3 of these in hopes to get the Concert disk- to actually be a concert.
Both disks are the same thing- disk 1.
Sony didn't even recall them.
And they Admitted it!!!
They just let us waste our money and figured we would live with it.
Typical of a rich corporation nowadays.

Boooo on Sony for this.
Very WRONG of them to pull such a selfish stunt.",1265155200,11,357,4.173913043478261
3223402,3,B000WOQKM6,"Wow! Though i wasn't a big fan of this style of music i can't help but be blown away by this man's amazing vocal range. The older i get the more i appreciate talent and here is one that is loaded with it. He is a living example and pattern for all other singers to watch and listen and learn from. This DVD is lovingly directed by one of my favorites Clint Eastwood and it shows beautifully the almost magical talent and charismatic charm of Bennett as he proves that he's one of our greatest singers even at 80 and still going strong. This DVD is as warm and inviting as a fireplace on a cold night and this crooner deserves all the accolades he gets and like fine wine and time he has truly stood the test and God has definatley smiled down on Tony Bennett, just watch this concert/interview film for living proof.",1263168000,2,816,4.2709677419354835

I returned it and purchased another,  and AGAIN it was 2 of the same, I returned it again and purchsed 2 used concerts of Tony and spent less money. From other reviews I see that I am not alone in this problem, this DVD needs to be recalled!",1207353600,3,280,3.7457627118644066
3223407,5,B000WOQKM6,"Really, Tony is the most wonderful singer in the world, and the real bearer of Frank Sinatra's legacy for all of us.
The first dvd is very complete but I regret the lack of subtitles for french fans.
The second dvd is a real magic concert. Just one regret : the pianist. Ralph Sharon was more discret and as good as Lee Musiker.",1203033600,,328,4.222222222222222
