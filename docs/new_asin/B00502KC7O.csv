4511461,5,B00502KC7O,"This is a great deal on three really decent movies for the family to enjoy.  Camp Nowhere is funny and entertaining as you'd expect from anything Christopher Lloyd is in.  Baby is not so funny but it's a nice tale of how many humans will try to destroy something they don't understand, but luckily there are humans who don't feel the same and want to preserve this uniqueness.  And My Father the Hero was actually very funny.  Based on how people can get their messages mixed up and the chaos it can cause.",1324166400,,506,4.408602150537634
4511462,5,B00502KC7O,Very fast delivery!  The DVD case had a crack and a very small scratch on one of the DVDs but i only bought it for camp nowhere.  Great price speedy and well worth it!  Will buy from again,1320192000,,188,3.8947368421052633
4511463,5,B00502KC7O,LOVE Camp Nowhere and the DVD itself worked awesomely!  I have never heard of the other two movies on the DVD and have yet to watch either of them also.,1318291200,,152,4.066666666666666
4511464,4,B00502KC7O,These movies are family viewing the way they used to be made.  Although not up to todays standards of special effects and lacking a bit they are still quite watchable.,1313625600,,167,4.566666666666666
4511465,2,B00502KC7O,Poor audio quality.,1464480000,,19,5.666666666666667

4511468,1,B00502KC7O,My movie shows up with the case broken and the movies rolling everywhere,1454889600,,72,4.615384615384615
4511469,5,B00502KC7O,"This a 3 movie set which I purchased to see My Father The Hero with Gerard Depardieu, which is a good film with a warm heart and several very funny scenes in it. This father-daughter story comes to life thanks to Mr. Depardieu's expressive French reactions to everybody and his ability to seriously make fun of his own ego and be funny all at once. The lines are classic and the story isn't always strong but go along for the good stuff and great situation comedy.",1452816000,,464,4.406976744186046
4511470,2,B00502KC7O,The My Father The Hero DVD was scratched. My children couldn't finish watching it.,1451433600,,82,4.928571428571429
4511471,4,B00502KC7O,Quality of movie is well.  Movie case was crushed or broken on the corner of DVD case.  It does not close properly,1450828800,,114,4.136363636363637
4511472,5,B00502KC7O,"I watched one of these movies when I was a kid - Baby: Secret of the Lost Legend.  Been trying to find it on DVD so I can enjoy it again.  I've been searching for lots of movies from my childhood, glad I found this one!  I currently don't have kids, but one day I plan on having them and I'll be able to share a piece of my childhood with them when I share my childhood movies with them.

The other 2 movies was just an added bonus.  My father the hero is ok...I never did care for it too much (my sister watched it several times and wore me out with it).  And Camp Nowhere I never heard before, but it too was an ok movie.",1447113600,,623,3.828125
4511473,1,B00502KC7O,"When I ordered this DVD I was expecting a triple feature as advertised.  However, when I received it, only Camp Nowhere and Baby: Secret of the Lost legend were on it.  My Father the Hero was not included at all, thus making this product a double feature.",1446336000,,255,4.404255319148936

4511478,5,B00502KC7O,Get this for My Father the Hero and see Katherine Heigl as a little girl in a very funny funny show.  Gerard Depardieu is perfect as a funny straight man.  Dry but perfect humor.,1425600000,,178,4.205882352941177

4511485,5,B00502KC7O,"I had been telling my niece and nephew about Camp Nowhere for years but it was never on tv or available for cheap. I was ecstatic when I found this dvd and my munchkins loved the movie. We haven't watched the other 2 movies, but I wish they were better movies from the era. Maybe Blank Check, Ritchie Rich, Man of the House, Cucamonga, etc....",1395360000,,343,4.292307692307692

4511490,3,B00502KC7O,"My girlfriend and her daughter love My Father the Hero so I got this set for them.  Have yet to watch the other movies but I will say, MFtH is actually very enjoyable....and you can't forget Katherine Heigl in a 90's thong (even if it makes you feel creepy watching it as she is only 16)",1368057600,,287,4.125

4511493,4,B00502KC7O,"Camp Nowhere funny and probably the best of the three.  My  Father the Hero with a very young Katherine Heigl and always likeable Gerard Depardieu is enjoyable.  Secret of the Lost Legend is not PG, not suitable for anybody under 14 even these days due to lengthy scenes displaying topless native women of all ages, otherwise it is a strictly B science-fictionay flick.  The 4 stars are for the other two movies.",1355875200,,412,4.680555555555555
