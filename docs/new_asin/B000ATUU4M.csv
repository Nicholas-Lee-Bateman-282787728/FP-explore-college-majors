2394418,4,B000ATUU4M,"If Only is beautiful.  It's funny, it's sad, it makes you want to get up and sing and it make you want to hold your head in your hands crying your heart out.

It has supernatural undertones, superb acting from Paul Nicholls and Jennifer Love Hewitt, who incidentally were having a relationship when this film was being shot - it shows!!  Real tears and absolute devastation of love is conveyed in a beautiful fashion.  Tom Wilkinson as the strange taxi driver and Lucy Davenport as the ever supportive Lottie.  A gem of a movie that should not be missed.  See it - you won't be dissappointed.",1144713600,,592,4.537735849056604
2394419,5,B000ATUU4M,"After catching this movie by chance when it first premiered on the ABC Family channel, man was I glad I didn't miss this film.....Jennifer Love Hewitt and Paul Nicholls were great in this movie, together along side the rest of the cast and crew ""If Only"" really became the movie it was intended to be, romantic, dramatic, yet comedic. The story line was well constructed and wasn't the usual romantic carbon-copy of a film, very original in it's own right.

I really enjoyed this film for its very moving and touching scenes and how it just had me guessing on what was going to happen next, trust me this film has some surprising twists to it that will keep u guessing till the end. Overall, this movie really stood out on its own and really draws u in on the love story between Samantha(Jennifer Love Hewitt) and Ian(Paul Nicholls). I highly recommend this movie to any JLH fans and anyone looking for a heart-moving romantic flick.",1144281600,2,933,4.620481927710843
2394420,4,B000ATUU4M,"First I must say, this is not quite your typical made-for-tv movie: it didn't feel like it was made low-budget & I thought the cast did very well.  I saw a preview for this on TV one day, & set my Tivo to record it: I was so glad I did!  The storyline was well-written, & just when I thought I had figured out the movie & knew the ending, I was wrong: it kept me guessing the entire time!

It was heartfelt, moving & even funny: but definitely bring a box of tissues when you watch this one, as it is a bit of a tear-jerker as well.  I was expecting them to follow the atypical sappy romance formula, without much originality (a type of movie I happen to love anyways), but I was pleasantly surprised by this movie in: the script, the cast & the quality.

All in all, I would highly recommend this to anyone who is a romantic at heart!",1141689600,30,835,4.067073170731708
2394421,4,B000ATUU4M,"I am a big fan of Jennifer Love Hewitt's, but even I can recognize that most of her roles have been one dimensional. The teen in distress chased by a lunatic, the teen in distress attending a party, the young woman in distress over her con-artist mother. Most of her roles require very little acting ability. Finally, If Only comes along, a movie which she financed and produced through her Love Spell Entertainment Company.

The story is about a young woman named Samantha who is seriously neglected by her boyfriend Ian. After arguing, and breaking up, a tragedy occurs and there is loss for one of the characters. Fortunately, this being a fantasy-romantic drama, the couple get to relive their day all over again.

If you lost someone and had the opportunity to go back and do things differently, what would you change? That is the question that this film asks, and ultimately it proves that Love never dies. If Only Love Hewitt was given more opportunities to shine. Watch for this movie coming to ABC Family Channel in January 2006, and to DVD shortly after. If you like romantic movies like the far superior Love Story, you won't be disappointed.",1141344000,,1153,4.731343283582089
2394422,5,B000ATUU4M,"I watched If Only twice on Family Channel and I have got to tell you, It's a fantastic movie! It kept you interested from start to finish. Jennifer Love Hewitt played the part to perfection",1137974400,,189,4.428571428571429
2394423,5,B000ATUU4M,"MOVIE: Overall, This movie is Amazingly Romantic, Charming, and Poignant! The Acting is one of the best I've ever seen. This is about a guy,Ian (Paul Nicholls) who gets a 2nd change to re-do the worst day of his life. You get to see what the actors are thinking without them saying anything because their acting shows it.

My OPINION: By far, This is the BEST movie I've ever seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (I am not exaggerating. I usually don't like a lot of movies). WHen i saw this on ABC family, I really didn't think it'd be this GOOD - but it IS !! My hope is that this movie will come out in the US in DVD!! (Isn't it ironic that a movie this good doesnt get published in the U.S.?? I mean what is that??)",1137542400,2,701,4.192592592592592
2394424,5,B000ATUU4M,"I didn't know if I would like this movie when I watched it on ABC Family channel the other night.  I loved it.  The story was well done and the acting made me connect with the characters.  I felt all the pain/hurt feelings that Samantha was portraying when she slowly realizes that Ian has come to take her for granted.  Then his and Lottie's pain were both well played after Samantha's death.  This has a sad ending but it is more life like than fantasy.  I believe that the fantasy of ""getting another day together"" was a well proportioned amount of fantasy.  The viewer is then thrown the reality ending of death.  Yes it made me very sad but it also clicked with me in the sense that life continues.  Samantha talked to Ian earlier in the show about how love doesn't die when someone is gone.  That is brought home with this ending.  It was very sentinmental.  I was also very surprised by the fact that Jennifer Love Hewitt can sing.  I had heard she had music cds out but I have never actually heard her sing.  She has a lovely voice.  I really enjoyed the song she sang in the movie.  I wonder if she wrote it...?  Well all I have to say is if you love a very good love story you need to see this movie.",1137456000,2,1210,4.191304347826087
2394425,3,B000ATUU4M,"I loved this movie...until the end.  The characters were more than one dimensional and you were pulled into the plot, rooting for their relationship.  I wish I would have known that the movie didn't have a happy ending.  When I have the time to watch a movie, I want it to be a feel-good movie...not like reality.",1137369600,,313,4.456140350877193

I think the Story of the Movie was not completely done as the Movie Jumped to Conclusion before Audrey's second marriage and she gave birth to her second son! it looks like the film maker went out of budget so the rest of her life story been written by sentences at the end of the film. I hope we watch her Complete Life Story in a better film.,1409788800,,406,4.151898734177215

We don't realize this is where the real gifts from life are. Some of us are resistant or ""caught up in our lives"".

2394500,2,B000ATUU4M,"If you like this film then you can be confident you are the vacuous person the system exalts in producing, so it can sell you this kind of film.

Romance, as characterized by this film, is running around half-naked in your multi-million dollar (London) home which you share-out-of-wedlock with your lover. Never mind that countless studies have demonstrated that cohabitating couples are more likely to divorce if eventually they marry, than if they had not cohabitated.

Hewitt and Nichols play lovers (Ian and Samantha) in their early twenties (she hasn't even graduated conservatory) who find romance grows best in the fertile soil of wealthy extravagance. Ian is some kind of young - obviously high paid - pitch man for a genetic engineering enterprise that offers mankind the ""greatest  gift of all"" - a longer life. He effortlessly affords a multi-story home in London (think in terms of affording such a pad in, say, Manhattan - even Sean Connery lives in multi-family dwelling in Manhattan) and performs his mysterious work-a-day chores in an office that probably rivals Bill Gates'. But we must be charitable to the screenwriter - after all, How can romance flourish with the dirt and grime of some youthful poverty clinging to your heels?

The whole idea behind this film is that we would all appreciate those closest to us better if we could sample their demise. That's fine so far as it goes, but they make their pitch farcical thus: about two-thirds way through the film Samantha consoles Ian over the loss of his beloved father by making light of it - ""Wherever (your father) is, I bet he knows how you feel (about him)...death doesn't put an end to love"". Now isn't that a curious line to insert into the context of this film? First, Ian's lucrative career is driven by his passion to give people longer lives (through genetic engineering). If death doesn't end love between the deceased and the living, then why the big push to extend life for as long as possible? Second, the whole point of this film is - besides romance - to drive home the point that ""Boy, you better love the one your with, with all your heart, mind and soul, while you have the chance. You never know what tomorrow may bring."" Well, what concern about tomorrow bringing separation through death if ""wherever"" people go, they still know we love them, and they can reciprocate?

Death is a calamity, and must be regarded as such without exception. This film undermines the very point it is trying to make.

2394502,2,B000ATUU4M,"Four & 5 star reviewers must be kidding when they declare they were romantically raptured by this film. In my book, a romantic movie should also include meaningful, elegant, interesting or powerful dialogue (say, Butterflies are Free, Two for the Road, The Swan, Sabrina First and 2nd version...). Nothing of that sort is here.
SPOILER!!!*** The engaging and promisory premise that gives grounds to ""If Only"" is disjointedly developed. Even Tom Wilkinson comes across as a nasty, implacable fellow, more than a wise benevolent spirit. What is the point of his behaviour? The male hero really does not redeem himself in the second chance he receives, and even if he does, is him who dies, not the girl. So, again: what is the moral?
I admit that I am badly predisposed against ""If Only"" for three not-too artistic reasons (but which made me laugh when they happened and convinced me that this was a cheap movie): JLH character is supposed to be a violin teacher and a violinist in a symphonic orchestra, yet she has NO idea how to remotely pretend to be playing the violin. While she ""plays"" (let's call it that) her wrist seems held in a cast and the instrument's bow goes all over the place, probably endangering the eyes of the extras sitting around her :-). In the meantime her left hand grabs the infortunate instrument as if somebody were trying to take it away from her. I suggest watching the old ""Intermezzo"" film to see how an actor -Leslie Howard- could really imitate the playing of a violin.
Second: she is a symphonic musician, yet the piece she composes and sings at the end is a cheap inconsequential pop song even more forgettable than this movie. And the public of the theatre applauded at her. (Good for them: they were being nice, no doubt, but do not try that in the Metropolitan).
Third, my favorite: The boyfriend steals from her a sheet of the song she wrote (a piano part?) and he makes 65 photocopies of it (which assumingly he distributes to the members of the orchestra). Evidently, according to the screenwriters, every musician in an orchestra reads the same part, no matter what instrument he/she is playing. Kinda One-Page-Fits-All music. Did the screenwriters ever heard of the words ""orchestration, arrangement and harmony""?. Hilarious.",1316822400,,2269,4.83547557840617

It has some elements which are similar to those found in SOMEWHERE IN TIME, and in GHOST. Fairly good production values, some good cinematography, one great landscape. Quite well written, I thought. There is sort of an epilogue which I almost thought was not needed, but all in all, if you like a good romance, I would say this is a ""buy"".",1296086400,2,625,4.1735537190082646
2394506,5,B000ATUU4M,"Incredibly moving, lighthearted at times, IF ONLY is one of those movies that brings about conflicting emotions at the same time.  The story is quite simple: Samantha (Hewitt) is, as she put it, a very distant second in her boyfriend Ian's (Nicholls) life and she is tired of it.  Ian loves her, to be sure, but does not act on it.  When Samantha suddenly dies, Ian regrets everything he did--or rather, did not do--when he had the chance to. But then,  the morning after, he wakes up and Samantha is at his side, as alive as anyone, and it dawns on him that he's been given a second chance. Life, destiny, whatever you call it, pressed the rewind button on his life and allowed him to finally appreciate her, to actually love her.

I thought the movie was well done; like I said, very simple, nothing fancy.  The leads fit their roles quite well. As a few reviewers have pointed out, Jennifer Love Hewitt isn't the greatest actress out there; however, in all the flicks I've seen her in, this was the one where she showed that she could actually act and do it well, given the right script, co-actors, director, etc.  I found her very charming and likable in this movie.  Paul Nicholls also gave a good performance as the cold, neglectful boyfriend; even more so when during the ""rewind"", as he finally opens up and drops all pretenses and just simply loves her.

This is a sad love story; so if you're the type to cry at the littlest things, I'd say be prepared and watch this with a handkerchief or tissues nearby.  You'll leave feeling a little sad and wistful but in a good way..",1285372800,5,1583,4.465277777777778

2394530,5,B000ATUU4M,"This is a touching story of giving the person you love everything they want, if only for one day.  This is, I think, Jennifer Love Hewitt's best role to date.  She looks her best, she's given a great script to work with, and she creates her character perfectly.  Some people won't like the ending because it's not a feel-good ending, but when you think about it, that's the most powerful scene of all.  What he does, and gives up, for her shows just how much he loves her and how far he's willing to go to protect her.

I have only two problems with this movie.  First, why is there no soundtrack for this film?  Jennifer's songs are beautiful, and they are not available on any of her CDs.  It's a shame to keep them locked away within the movie.  My second issue is with the aspect ratio.  Right at the beginning there's the standard full-screen notice saying the film has been modified to fit your screen.  So if they filmed it in widescreen format (which is evident by the last few seconds plus the credits having the black bars on top and bottom), why not release it in widescreen format as well?

After seeing many movies in my lifetime, I've grown to expect the predictable.  Believe me, this one was not.  Now, being that this one was different than the norm, it would be a betrayal to tell you in what way it was unpredictable...so I won't.  I'll just say that if you are looking for a movie with true love in it, not one that is a shallow portrayal of selfish, lustful behavior, give this one a try.  I know I'm not backing up my opinion very well here, but I see no reason to ruin the movie for you by giving away the plot any more than the editorial review did.  I will say this, have a box of Kleenex beside you, and maybe see it with a friend with a chocolate bar nearby as well.

2) The story is very original and beautiful... JLH waited 7years to produce this movie on her own, so if you like her, trust her

3) She is singing in it 2unreleased songs that are great!

So, don't miss your chance to have a good moment & maybe to change your point of view about love!

How can a movie be so creative and enjoyable, make you think, entertain you, keep you in suspense, make you cry, make you cringe at its sappiness and maudlin acting---do all of these things at the same time?  That's ""If Only"".  It is a love story, and sort of a psychological thriller, based on an interesting idea: what if we could live our lives over again...and change the outcome...or could we change the outcome?  Without spoiling the plot, there's not a lot more I can say about that.

It's a movie about the importance and impact of love, what it means to truly care about another person, how differently we might think about those we love if we were to be on the verge of losing them, and much more.  The value in this film is in its creativity and in how it makes you think.

On the negative side, the acting is not great...it highlights Jennifer Love Hewitt's singing way too much...it is obviously a lower-budget more B-grade type movie...it is maudlin...still these negatives don't ruin all of the positives.  It is a meaningful movie, not just entertaining, and as I said before, will definitely make you think about your life and how you are living it---relatively few movies do this as well.  Maybe someone will take the idea behind this movie and redo it with great acting and writing---then it would be absolutely incredible!

I think you'll be glad you watched it, and if you have friends or a date to talk it over with afterwards, you'll have some really provocative discussions.

2394555,4,B000ATUU4M,"Christina Welsh has written a fine screenplay that proves that old ideas can be re-worked in a thoroughly original way.  Gil Junger steps out of his role as a director for TV series and molds Welsh's story into a visually charming and sensible, touching movie.  Add the considerable talents of one highly regarded pro (Tom Wilkinson) and two underrated young bright lights (Jennifer Love Hewitt and Paul Nicholls) and the result is a little film that is polished, absorbing, and genuinely tender.

Samantha (Hewitt) is a musician living and studying in London where she is in a healthy relationship with a handsome young executive Ian (Nicholls): though obviously in love, Ian is more involved with his work than Samantha would like and on the day of her 'finals concert' they have a spat over several issues. On his way to his all-important meeting Ian encounters a taxi driver (Wilkinson) who gives him some sage advice about his love life. Abruptly Samantha is killed in a freak auto accident and Ian is devastated.  In his grief he strangely awakens to the same day in which Samantha was killed, and through a series of working through the elements of his life where he failed her (with a bit of aid from the taxi driver), Ian has an 'If only' experience, a time to re-evaluate his love for Samantha, his life, and his changes.  A twist in the events brings the story to a surprise but apropos ending.

From what could have been yet another love-death tearjerker of a Hollywood movie emerges a story with heart and with some poignant lessons for us all.  Hewitt proves a fine actress in this film and is beautifully paired by the exciting presence of relative newcomer Paul Nichols.  It is not a great movie, but it is one that will pleasantly surprise viewers who may have though it was just another 'chick flick'.  Give it a chance - it is worth it!

2394556,4,B000ATUU4M,"This is hardly an original movie, let's start with that. Then again, what was the last truly original movie you've seen? Now that we got that out of the way, let's agree that you either love sappy romances that have that ""if only"" element attached to it or hate them.

This movie is in the vain of such films as ""Family Man"" and Chances Are."" Jennifer Love Hewitt is ""Samantha"" an American living in London with her boyfriend, ""Ian"" (played by Paul Nicholls). Ian is absorbed in his work, not being the boyfriend he could/should be. When Samantha dies in an auto accident, Ian is racked with guilt...until a cab driver makes possible the opportunity to relive the last day they spent together.

Well, suffice to say, having the chance to do it all over again, Ian is everything he wasn't the first time around. But yet little things throughout the day seem to indicate that no matter what happens, the day will end with Samantha dying. Unless....

I can't spoil it for those who haven't yet seen it. There will be tissues and there will be tears. It isn't anything you probably haven't seen before, but it works like a charm this time.

Jennifer Love Hewitt really should be the go-to girl for romantic movies. She has the girl next door appeal that woman don't find threatening and men find attainable (think Meg Ryan). And, yes, women will swoon over Ian.

From what I've been able to gather, this movie was released overseas theatrically, but was only on ABC Family in the United States. The fact that Amazon has it listed probably means there is a DVD release in the future and this one is well worth owning.",1145491200,,1612,4.56401384083045
