2703418,5,B000LC3III,I'm not sure if anyone knows this...but i'm pretty sure i've seen this dvd/vhs a very long time ago.  I think this was made back in the 80s or early 90s and was released on vhs.  I saw something like this when i was in college (back in 97).  Does anyone have any clue what i'm talking about?  the only thing that would be different are the new interviews and stuff like that.  but the main part of this dvd was made some time ago i think.,1175212800,,438,3.9885057471264367
2703419,3,B000LC3III,"I am a loyal fan of the NWA/WCW, and I think that The 4 Horsemen were one of, if not the best group of wrestlers I've ever seen.  Based on what I'm hearing about the Horsemen DVD, I'm not sure that the Horsemen are getting the much credit that they deserve.  I personally don't feel that the DVD should be called Ric Flair, And The 4 Horsemen, since he was the lead man in that squad.  I would understand it more if it were entitled J.J. Dillon, And The 4 Horsemen, since J.J was the manager for that team.  Until I actually get a chance to view the DVD, I'll only give it a 3.0 as my default vote, which is a fair opinion  for not viewing the DVD as of yet.  I'll make a more informed opinion after I see the DVD's.  One important factor, I'm hoping that The WWE focuses more so on  the Horsemen from the original squad,which in my opinion, was the best 4 Horsemen group, rather than spending alot of time on the last official group of people who were fortunate enough to be called Horsemen, I'll just have to wait and see.  In a nutshell, don't give an honest opinion, until you've actually seen the DVD, afterwards you will be able to site the pros and cons  about this Horsemen collectors item.  Regardless, I remain a fan of The Horsemen, and  The National Wrestling Alliance/World Championship Wrestlingg for life, even if those companies no longer exists.  Although I am now totally blind , my love for wrestling still lives within me, and for that one reason, I'll continue to watch, or rather listen to it as often as I can.  The Blind Legend is through!!!",1175040000,,1565,4.333333333333333
2703420,5,B000LC3III,"Looks like it is going to be awesome!! and guess what, the footage has to be WCW since there was no 4 Horsemen in WWE!!!! So, we are going to be getting classic footage in this... I cant wait!!!

2703421,5,B000LC3III,I've been waiting a long time to see a dvd about the Horsemen since I've only watched them during the time that Sullivan was the booker and he kinda hated Benoit and Pillman.  I do hope that they include some of the viewpoints from the members of the Horsemen that are still alive I mean the WWe has a chance to really make this a great dvd and I hope they include some of Benoit's matches with Sullivan on this dvd.  I mean sure the matches might not have been tag team matches but they was done during the time that he was a member of the Horsemen also I hope they include the tag team match between Ric Flair and Arn Anderson going against the Late Brian Pillman and Steve Austin which in my opinion was one of the greatest tag team matches of all time.  I'm also hoping they include some of Flair's matches with Sting and some of Arn's matches on this dvd as well as Ole's matches since there really isn't a place to watch those anymore unless you get WWe 24-7.,1172448000,2,965,4.17741935483871
2703422,4,B000LC3III,"Three DVD's from the first faction in wrestling. If this is done right it could be one of the greatest wrestling discs ever. Wargames 1987 has to be included. I also remember a match from 1987 on WorldWide Wrestling from the Charlotte Coliseum Dusty, the Road Warriors, & Nikita Koloff vs. Tully, Arn, Ric, & Lex. If they have singles matches you have to include a Ric Flair vs. Arn Anderson match, you have to have Flair vs. Sting from Clash I in Greensboro, Ric & Kerry Von Erich from Texas Stadium. Obviously you have to include Horseman break dusty's leg. Horseman attack Dusty in the parking lot. Horseman Nitro return interview. Ric's final interview on last Nitro great mic work. Horseman attack Ricky Morton in the dressing room. I also hope there is no repeat matches from the Ric Flair set. With a 30 year plus career of Ric Flair there should be no repeats. I can't undeerstand why they did this with the Hogan anthology, considering all the matches Hogan has had in his career. Well we can only hope for the best.",1168128000,5,1025,4.545945945945946

2703493,4,B000LC3III,"I actually thought this one could have been way better. Some of the match choices were a bit baffling, like the selection of the Clash I meeting between Arn + Tully against Lex and Barry instead of the more important rematch that had Windham turn on Luger and join the Horsemen. But still worth having.",1472083200,,302,4.509090909090909

2703495,5,B000LC3III,"One of the familiar statements by ""Double A,"" Arn Anderson when making reference to the greatest faction in wrestling history--the 4 Horsemen. Of course--judging by the cover of this DVD collection and when the Horsemen were inducted into the Hall of Fame--that WWE would seemingly want people to remember the Flair, Windham, Blanchard & Double A lineup as the greatest version of the Horsemen.

The apparent reason for that line of thinking seems to have to due with Ole's reputation of being somewhat of a bleep-hole off camera & the apparent falling out he had with Ric Flair back when the Nature Boy returned to WCW back in 1993. Whatever the case may be, originals are more often than not the best--and (imo) the same thing is true of the Horsemen.

The documentary of this collection is easily the best part--especially when Slick Ric & a few of the other wrestlers interviewed cut loose on the many bad choices that were made as far as the guys who would get recruited into the faction. Hearing the Nature Boy rip Sid Vicious a new one was particularly amusing--in Ric's own words, ""please put this on the DVD.""

Overall, a must have for fans of the most elite faction in wrestling history. 5 stars",1464134400,,1205,4.6745283018867925
2703496,4,B000LC3III,I fondly remember watching the four horsemen. It was like lightning striking. They can wrestle and can talk the talk. Even if you do not know anything about them you will be captivated by their charisma. It is hard to turn away from watching them. Sort like watching your favorite actor even if their in a bad movie. Definitely worth 6 bucks. Bought one for my friend as well. Buy it. New wrestlers have nothing on them. Enjoy.,1464048000,,427,4.487179487179487

Led by Ric Flair the group set the standard for excellence. From their tough take no prisoners in ring style. As well as the high roller larger than life lifestyle outside of the ring.

2703568,5,B000LC3III,"I received this dvd on time.

To the vid;
I liked this story on the greatest of them - the 4H.
It was informative and well produced.
The vid centers mostly around Flair and the original group, but I personally feel not enough time was given to Ole.
He was a major part of the stable's early success.  I know he had/has a bad attitude at times, but that is Ole.
And love em' or hate em', he was a great wrestler, booker, and mic man.

There is good commentary form Barry Windham and Ric, as well as the awesome Arn Anderson.
and frankly, without Arn, the whole damn thing wouldnt have lasted past the middle 90s.

It shows some great promo footage, and some of the big matches.
It's definitely a nice addition to any rasslin' fans' collection.

Pick it up if you love the Horsemen.

2703569,5,B000LC3III,"It's too bad this isn't in BluRay format.  Brings back memories.  I've seen most of these matches and promos on TV when I was a kid.  If you're savvy enough, you can find most of the footage here on YouTube but the quality is horrible.  The DVD cleans up that footage a lot.  The only problem is that the DVD was created in a 4:3 aspect ratio (standard definition).  Unless your DVD/BluRay player can compensation for the ratio, you will be seeing the whole DVD in a 'stretched' format making Dusty looking fatter than he already is and everyone appears to be really bloated.

2703670,5,B000LC3III,"Long before the NWO,the Studd Stable, DX, Evolution and countless other super groups there was the 4 Horsemen.  It was around 1985 when 4 of the greatst stars of their era came together:  Ric Flair, Arn Anderson, Ole Anderson and Tully Blanchard.  They added JJ Dillion and thus the Horsemen were born.  The first part of the DVD set that u get to see is the documentary on the group which details the formation of the group plus most if not all of the incarnations of the Horsemen.  So many awesome talents have been Horsemen and all are told in this set:  Sting and his subsequent forced removal from the group, Lex Luger, the very underrated Barry Windham, Chris Benoit, Dean Malenko, etc.  I did like how they explained the so called family ties with in the original members of the group which told that Arn, Ole and Flair were all cousins.  This is finally answered.  They do show when the Horsemen very viciously attacked Dusty Rhodes within a steel cage and ""broke"" his leg.  I remember at the time this was such a huge deal within the NWA.  They also like home video footage of the Horsemen attacking Dusty outside of some store or plumber place or something and breaking his arm.  Awesome stuff that we don't get to see today.  Of course they talk about Ole leaving the group and Luger joining.  I never got why they chose him but they did.  We also get some history in the War Games match as at one time this was considered the Horsemen's match.  They do talk about Barry Windham joing the group who in my opinion is just a fantastic member.  I think he was a perfect fit to the group and in a lot of people's opinions formed the best group of the Horsemen along with Tully, Arn and Flair.  Some people wonder why Ole isn't on the cover of this set and I think it's cuz of Barry being a more popular member and the fact that Ole is so hated within the wrestling community that it isn't funny.  Next they talk about Sting and his brief time within the Horsemen and his getting kicked out in one of the greatest moments in wrestling history.  They also talk about Sid and don't have a lot of good things to say about him.  They even talk about the hotel room/stabbing incident with Sid and Arn.  One of the funniest moments on this set is when the group for some unknown reason decided to add Paul Roma to the group.  You've just got to hear Roma and how full of himself he is.  I mean he basically says that he was good for the group cause he was so good looking he gave people something good to look at.  Give me a break!  We hear about Benoit being added and Pillman and then Mongo and then Dean Malenko and some others.  All in all just a great documentary.  I'm hoping that with the induction of the Horsemen in the hall of fam this year that this will lead to yet another dvd set of the Horsemen.  The extras were good and included Flair talking about the wildest night in the business, the footage of them attacking Dusty in that parking lot, a Barry Windham story on Lex Luger that is just funny as crap and some interviews plus more.  The matches were good as well and included:

Arn Anderson, Ole Anderson and Ric Flair vs. Pez Whatley, the Italian Stallion and Rocky King from NWA tv 6/22/1985:  This was just your standard television match for that time period but it is cool to see the Anderson's and Flair together.

Ric Flair vs. Ricky Morton from Great American Bash 7/5/1986 in a cage match:  Morton was a part of the Rock and Roll Express but has a beef with Flair cuz of his attack on Morton and breaking his nose.  Awesome match from start to finish (Ricky was really underrated and proved it in this match).  Of course there was blood and just some very exciting back and forth action from both.  It did look like at times that Ricky would pull this off and win the title but to no avail.  By the way, check out Flair's awesome entrance before the match.  Great one.

Tully Blanchard vs. Dusty Rhodes from Starrcade 1986 11/27/1986 in a first blood match for the TV title:  This was a pretty good match but they would have better ones including some fantastic cage matches and a ladder/barbed wire from GAB 1987.  This match was good but we do see both guys wrestling fairly defensively due to the first blood stip in the match and I think this hindered what would have been a very good match.

Four Horsemen vs. Dusty Rhodes, Nikita Koloff, Lex Luger, Steve Williams and Paul Ellering from Great American Bash 7/16/1988 in a War Games match:  This match was not near as good as some of the previous War Games matches that took place.  This match was conjured up by Dusty Rhodes and is still considered one of the most brutal matches of its kind.  I do think there is a misprint in the date for this match.  I think in 1988 there was only GAB event with Luger and Flair main eventing.  I thought this match took place at the Citrus Bowl in 1987 when the GAB went on a tour.  I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Anyway, this match is good but near as good as the first two that took place in 1987 on that tour.  Also there is on commentary for this one which normally doesn't bother me but I just think u need that in a War Games match.  Still plenty of action and blood for everyone.

Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard vs. Sting and Nikita Koloff at Great American Bash 7/10/1988:  Great match with lots of back and forth action.  I have often felt that Blanchard and Anderson were very underrated as a tag team and just freaking brilliant to watch in the ring.  I know Shawn Michaels really loved to work with them when he was in the Rockers.  Anyhow great match here that goes to a 20 min time limit draw.  Oh if only they could have added just 10 more mins.

Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard vs. Barry Windham and Lex Luger at Clash I for the NWA Tag titles 3/27/1988:  Awesome match and fantastic title change.  The fans are so into this one that it's hard not to get caught up in it.

Ric Flair vs. Arn Anderson at Fall Brawl 9/17/1995:  They said it wud never happen but it did and boy what a great wrestling match this was.  From start to finish these guys gave us everything they had and then some.  Most people do get pissed off because Brian Pillman interfered in the match and caused Flair to lose (I think most wanted to see a straight up match just to see who was truly better) but still this match is probably the best one they have on this set.

All in all this is a great DVD set with a lot of classic matches and a great story about how the greatest super group of all time was created and ran rough shod over the NWA and WCW.  Could u just imagine what these guys could have done in the WWE back in the day?  Great set that will stand the test of time and as I stated earlier:  It wud be nice to see another Horsemen set come out with more interview, more footage of them attacking other wrestlers and more matches on it.  That wud just be great.  Get this set!  Highly recommended!",1330732800,,6924,4.275596612779061

The DVD seems to provide a strong chronology of how the group formed and describing the elements that were added and that were missing with each change in the membership of the group and how that chemistry separated the 4 Horsemen from a created faction or manufactured story. It made me wish that WCW had just let the group go into the sunset instead on insisting on adding odd members and dragging the group out like it was just any other hodgepodge of guys.

The DVD does an incredible job noting the switching of some horsemen from WCW to WWE and back. It does a great job on getting candid with most of the participants, which makes the interviews with Arn Anderson (as most have noted) seem quite odd at times. The Extras & Matches were well chosen in correlation with the documentary.

By themselves, the documentary & the extras/matches would be worth the buy. Together, ""Ric Flair & The Four Horsemen"" is a must buy.",1254873600,,1152,4.528846153846154
2703699,2,B000LC3III,"I would like to make a mention, and that I think most of my wrestling colleagues would attest to, is that The Four Horsemen's introduction into the NWA/WCW was comprised of: Ric Flair, Arn Anderson, Tully Blanchard,Ole Anderson, and Lex Luger. This was unmistakenly the best tandem of Horsemen ever assembled. Even though Ole was going through some nagging injuries throughout the mid to later 80's, Ole and Lex were a mainstay of this organization. If Vince McMahon would just get off of his high horse for just a brief point in time and recognize the fact that Lex and Ole should have been included on this DVD. Hey, the guys careers are over Vince. Give them the credit that they deserve. I mean, make the effort Vince and just bury the hatchet, have a good heart to heart talk with these two former greats and let life go on.  Even Chris Benoit should have probably gotten some mention in the re-edited DVD also, but due to the extenuating circumstances that happened to Chris & his family, Vince won't let that happen either, even though there are some copies of this DVD that have Chris on it.
  There were other really great Horsemen members like Barry Windham, Sid Vicious, and others, but the 1985 formulation was like the founding father of this group. After finding out that Lex & Ole were left off the DVD, I guess I can't blame Lex for jumping to WCW Monday Nitro, after just completing a pay-per-view event the night before in the WWE.",1241222400,2,1449,4.586872586872587

I've watched this video numerous times.  My only complaint is that some of the match selection could have been a lot better, but overal this video is a must have for any old school wrestling fan.",1231459200,,367,4.432835820895522
2703702,5,B000LC3III,"WWE does it once again.  A great re-living of the best group of wrestlers ever assembled.  I was fortunate enough to start watching wrestling again the very week Arn Anderson originally came to Georgia so I lived the whole thing.

I wish Ole would have participated in the commentary but understand that past events and health problems prevented that from happening.  I also would have included more matches with a third disc, especially featuring the original four.  The one match above all others I wanted to see and was disappointed by its lack of inclusion is the Ole/Arn Anderson vs. Rock and Roll Express match where they originally ""broke"" Ricky Morton's nose.  That match above all others showed just how sadistic Ole and Arn could be in the ring together and show what a great tag team match is all about.

Everything else is all I could ever want or hope for.",1214265600,,869,4.677631578947368
2703703,5,B000LC3III,"The Horsemen were THE original wrestling mafia gang.  They didn't play characters.  Every night was a private jet to the next city, a limousine ride to the arena, and a limousine back to the hotel for a party with all of the ladies from 18 to 28.  They took wrestling thuggery to a new level with their brutal attacks on wrestlers that tried to take the Nature Boy's title.  Fans were actually calling for the arrest of the Horsemen for their brutal televised assault on Dusty Rhodes at a gas station.  The Horsemen used a baseball bat to break Dusty's hand.

The Four Horsemen are still wildly popular with wrestling fans today.  Recent seasons of CBS's hit Reality TV show Survivor have featured contestants flashing the four-finger salute and calling themselves Horsemen.  The Horsemen paved the way for the NWO, Degeneration X, and Evolution.

2703705,4,B000LC3III,"Some straight to DVD documentaries leave you wanting more.  This one, if anything, is too long.  I ended up fast-forwarding through parts where it was obvious they would have a bunch of interviewees saying basically the same thing.  It could have used tighter editing.

As for the Horsemen, it's clear from this account that they should have retired this gimmick well before they were down to 2 original members.  They kept reforming, with one short-lived arrangement after the other -- some so bad they were laughable.

When Arn Anderson was shown in his mid 20s, he looked about 40.  When he retired at 40, he looked 40.  In his interviews for this DVD, he still looks pretty much the same as he always has.

Unfortunately, Ric Flair is barely recognizable from the man he was just 10 years ago.  I grew up watching him in his heyday and as a sincere and true fan of his, I wish he would have retired after the final match on WCW he had vs. Sting.  He's been mainly a sideshow on WWE, although a year ago he had an incredible (and dangerous) table,ladder,chair match vs. Edge and got the hell beat out of him.  I don't know how he does it, I have all the respect for him in the world, but the Ric Flair I remember wasn't the ""good guy"", didn't show up to matches as an underdog old man to make you feel sorry for him.  He was ""the man"", the dirtiest player in the game, the World Champion -- but in order to extend his career past 50 he's had to assume the role of someone else entirely.  And while Vince McMahon still looks and sounds good with charisma to spare at 62 (despite his apparently declining mental capacity as reflected in his increasingly terrible ""creative"" decisions), Flair does not, despite being younger.

Some people have different ""peak"" years.  Vince didn't really hit his stride until his 50s.  Flair was at his best in his late 30s-early 40s.  Britney Spears was past her prime by 19.  Arn Anderson was born to be a 40-year old man.",1198713600,,1958,4.449438202247191
2703706,4,B000LC3III,"RIC FLAIR AND THE FOUR HORSEMEN
actual documentary is a little over 2 hours

Wow!  Or should I say... Wooo!  Like many others, I am a big fan of the Horsemen and have been for some time.  Due to the fact that the WWE had nothing to do with the legendary stable, I was almost certain that they would mess this DVD up, but to my surprise they delivered a quality product!  And yes I believe its still true: The Four Horsemen are the greatest wrestling stable of all time!

The DVD starts off in the pre-Horsemen days, with Gene Anderson and Ole Anderson wrestling together as sibling tag team (the team actually predated Ole but maybe that's another DVD...).  Ole was joined by Arn Anderson, who was noticing the potential in a young man who we now know as Ric Flair.  Along with their ""sparkplug"" Tully Blanchard, the group joined to become the Four Horsemen and were managed by J.J. Dillon.  The group would famously isolate a certain body part (i.e.- leg, hand, whatever) and ""work on it"" to wear it down.  They were also known as much for their flamboyant lifestyles outside the ring as they were for their wrestling skills.  This led to a great combination of exciting interviews and classic arcs in the history of the NWA/WCW where each member held a belt (Ric- World champ, Arn and Tully- Tag champs, 2nd generation member Barry Windham- US champ) amounting to one of the greatest forces in the wrestling industry.

In the way of history, this DVD has most of what you need to know.  Naturally we get a large segment dedicated to their historic feud against Magnum T.A. and Dusty Rhodes (another one of my favorite wrestling personalities), not to mention Ric Flair's ""open secret"" disgust with various WCW figureheads including Eric Bischoff.
But part of why I like this DVD so much is it also devotes considerable time to some things that were just confusing as a fan.  For example what about the half-induction of Kendall Windham (Barry's brother) into the group, the brief selection of Hiro Matsuda as manager or the infamous ""3 Horsemen"" lineup with jobber Paul Roma?  You will also hear the Horsemen's thoughts on Lex Luger, Sting and the notorious incident between Arn and Psycho Sid.  I am a huge Brian Pillman fan and even though he wasn't as important as some of the other members, I was happy to see his inclusion on this DVD.  Finally we get to the late WCW version of the group with Chris Benoit, Dean Malenko and former Chicago Bear Steve ""Mongo"" McMichael.  The Curt Hennig/nWo angle is covered but after that point the ""story"" of the DVD kind of disintegrates as the final years of WCW were so fragmented and weird that nobody really knew if the Four Horsemen (or Flair's contract) were still in existence.

It is true that Arn Anderson is in character for this DVD.  As a fan who grew up on 1980s wrestling, I like that.  Also it is clear that he is giving ""real"" answers when he needs to, for example when he comments on whether or not he took the nWo skit about him personally.  However, there are a couple points when a ""shoot"" response would've been nice, such as a better explanation about Ole's expulsion from the group.  For wrestling reviews, I normally include a list of matches referenced or included.  Its true that the shortage of some of the important matches may be the set's only shortcoming.  Well that and no recent footage of Ole (although that was probably more his doing that WWE's).

The last thing I will say about this DVD is that I'm very happy that it didn't cover any of the WWE allusions to the Horsemen (like they did on the 'nWo: Back in Black'  DVD) and also  that somehow it didn't turn into a back-patting session for the McMahons ('Monday Night War' DVD).  The closest we get is the needless inclusion of Triple H, but anyone who knows the WWE title history understands the story there.  Anyway, I've more or less given up on pro wrestling as any kind of entertainment but this DVD set at least gives me the incentive to buy some of these ""retro"" DVDs!

2703707,5,B000LC3III,"A very enjoyable dvd set. Great matches; excellent interviews and commentary. Unfortunately, it also serves as a reminder of how much more entertaining wrestling used to be--back in the pre-steroid days when guys didn't shave their chests or their armpits.",1189814400,,256,5.425
2703708,3,B000LC3III,"I loved the documentary, having grown up in the NWA/WCW Horsemen era (all incarnations).  My favorite ""stable"" was the original: Ole, Arn, Tully, and Ric.  Seeing more of Ole on the mic would have been nice, but the full story of the Horsemen is told well.  The choice of matches on Disc 2, however, is horrible.

It's also sad to be reminded of how the suits at WCW never really understood the fan appeal of the Horsemen.  It's inexplicable.  If you didn't already know about him, watch the documentary and see Eric Bischoff at his megalomaniacal, dissembling best.",1184716800,2,566,4.724489795918367

2703750,5,B000LC3III,"A ""historical"" documentary on this Horsemen DVD seems as endless as Ric Flair's career. Flair and his fellow creaky wrestling comrades, Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard, engage in self congratulatory stories about their questionable antics from another century that occurred both inside and outside the ring.  The DVD gives top billing to Flair who, most notoriously today, wrestles at an advanced age and attracts a mocking response from modern audiences when he appears at arenas in his sequined house robes (suitable attire for an old man) accented by an entrance theme from a stale science fiction movie. Flair, Anderson, and Blanchard are just as Has-Been as the ""2001"" anthem.  Finally, a Horseman of much younger vintage and with more true ring athleticism, Paul Roma, rescues the DVD and infuses it with life.  Roma stands his ground in the documentary against charges that he was not a team player from molding doughboys Flair and Anderson and their sycophant Triple H.  Roma rescued the Horsemen from antiquity in the Nineties and brought both class and renewed audience support to the decaying team. Evidently he did not subscribe to the Horsemen's frat boy rules of conduct, so now they try to punish him with their cheap shots in the documentary.  Triple H chimes in as the self proclaimed wrestling ""historian"" who conveniently forgets that Paul Roma was a solo powerhouse in the ring plus a member of championship tag teams The Young Stallions, Power and Glory, and Pretty Wonderful.  During his portion of the interview, Roma responds to the cheap shots with his own observations about his former colleagues that are more accurate and have the targeted power of one of his patented wrestling high kicks.  Bravo Roma!  The full star rating from this Amazon customer is exclusively for you.  You survived the Horsemen with your credibility and integrity intact.  The same can not be said for Flair and Anderson.",1182384000,4,1925,5.044164037854889

2703753,4,B000LC3III,"This is a very good overall DVD.  The first DVD featured the documentary portion which is almost always incredible for most of the WWE releases so this one is no exception.  There is only one beef I have with the documentary portion of the DVD and most of the comments written before me already touched on it which was; Arn Anderson damn near stayed in ""character"" on the DVD which he should not have been.  The only reason why I gave it four out of five stars was because there wasn't enough matches on the second DVD and I feel like it should have been more than that.  My favorite stable of the 4 Horsemen were:  Anderson, Blanchard, Flair and Windham.  I think at that point they were at the pinnacle of the stable and their careers.  I do think that if Pillman stayed in WCW in the later 90's (with the Horsemen) that would have been incredible too.

Which brings me to the next point.  The people who should've never been considered Horsemen are:  McMichael (can't wrestle), Roma (especially him!), Sting (why would WCW toy with that idea?), Vicious (terrible) and Jarrett (pathetic!).

Overall I highly recommend to add it to your wrestling DVD connnection just to bring back the memories.  I wonder if the WWE will release a DVD on Ravishing Rick Rude or Ricky Steamboat.  That would be awesome.",1179619200,,1303,4.564655172413793

2703809,4,B000LC3III,"One of the WWE's better nostalgic DVD's. Excellent inetrviews, with Slick Ric, Arn and Tully in good form, straight shooting. Match selection a bit thin for hard core buffs, but still a trenchent reminder of just what makes Flair and Co great. Breakout star in this DVD Arn Anderson- he truly was a sensational wrestler in his day, and Blanchard was a terrific heel as well, his great skills worked with Anderson wonderfully-the tag team you loved to hate (the match vs Nikita Koloff and Sting is fantastic) The combination of the original Horsemen truly lightening in a bottle.

The ironic scene is having the king of prelim jobbing bums, Paul Roma (whose selection in the Horseman can most charitably be described as a bizarre mistake)diss Arn and Ric. This will hopefully be the only WWE DVD he ever appears in.

2703813,4,B000LC3III,"What a great DVD this is. I'll say it every time I review a WWE DVD. The WWE really hits the mark with their DVD releases. The Four Horsemen DVD is no exception. Between this and the Ric Flair DVD set, you should have more than enough on a great era of wrestling.

The documentary on this DVD is the best, right up there with the ECW and Hulk Rules DVD's. Ric Flair speaks so honestly and candidly on thoughts of the various incarnations of the 4 Horsemen. I liked hearing what he had to say on Luger, Roma, and Bischoff, worth the price alone.

The other thing I liked was hearing from Barry Windham, I always enjoyed his work. He was a Florida boy, when I used to live there. It was great to hear what he had to say, sad to see him get so heavy.

Arn Anderson, and Tully were interesting. I was such a big fan of the horsemen back in the day, to go down memory lane and hear them talk about what was happening behind the scenes was awesome. I haven't gotten to the second disc yet, but I can already say I would have somehow liked to see more Barry Windham.

Great DVD, especially if you were a fan at the time. WWE hit another one out of the park.",1178150400,,1150,4.052863436123348
2703814,5,B000LC3III,"The reason I am giving this set a 5 star rating is mostly for the bio! True, Arn Anderson is in character for most of this but quite frankly, there is little difference between his in-ring character and the real man so I didn't get upset about that at all.

As for the bio itself, it was great but you can get some negative vibes at times (especially when discussing Ole Anderson, Paul Roma, former WCW Executive Vice President Jim Herd and Eric Bischoff)! I know some fans would've liked to have heard from other former members like Lex Luger, Sting or Ole Anderson but you have to remember something here. Sting currently works for TNA (at the time that I am writing this) so there was no way he was going to be on this project and neither Lex nor Ole are on good terms with WWE. Plus, with the way Ole bashed Ric recently in his own autobiography, I doubt they would've wanted him on the project anyway as a lot of people have grudges against him. Still, I would've rather heard from Ole than ROMA! That guy is VERY DELUSIONAL! Even at near 60, Flair can still work a better match than Paul Roma in his prime! I'll take a 100 year old Flair over Roma any day! You got to hear the comments. This guy is on crack!

As it was, the bio was great as they discussed the different groups and how a lot the changes were made more for political reasons rather than good business sense. They also said that some changes were made by non-wrestling officials (which I tend to believe myself). Overall, just a great trip down memory lane. To paraphrase Jim Ross' words, ""WITHOUT THE HORSEMEN, THERE WOULD'VE BEEN NO DX, NO DANGEROUS ALLIANCE AND THERE DAMN SURE WOULD'VE BEEN NO NWO!"" Get this to see the rise and fall of the ""symbol of excellence.""

MINI-UPDATE:
Recently, I read an article in Pro Wrestling Illustrated that WWE 24/7 has re-edited this piece due to their unoffical ""DON'T MENTION CHRIS BENOIT"" stance.

As a result, however, the Brian Pillman part of the Horsemen saga is shortened and the chapters mentioning Steve McMichael, Jeff Jarrett and possibly the big reunion in 1998 in Greenville, SC have been removed! The DVD release, however, has not been recalled or re-edited yet so for those that want the history with no edits, I would DOUBLY RECOMMEND this release! This isn't an endorsement of Chris Benoit so much as it is an endorsement of telling a story and telling it right!",1177027200,22,2390,4.5
2703815,4,B000LC3III,"Let me preface this by saying that I have been a Ric Flair fan since he came on the scene in 1974, and DO remember his first two title belts (Mid-Atlantic tag title with Rip ""The Profile"" Hawk, and the Mid-Atlantic TV title).  This should have been even better than the Ultimate Ric Flair DVD, but as others have already commented, it comes up just a little short.

The GOOD; the always open and honest dialog from Ric Flair.  Even after reading his book, I loved hearing him articulate his true feelings about what happened to WCW, and seeing his pain, hurt, animosity, and happiness, especially when he talks about the partying/lifestyle aspect of the Horsemen, very refreshing as always.

The PROMOS; is there any doubt that the original Four Horsemen wrote the book on promo cutting???  Every promo they show, clip or complete is worth watching again and again.  I especially enjoyed the cut where Tully acknowledged the Horsemen fans...something you would never expect a villain to do!!  The passion of Double A in his words...Ric said it all, the guy can talk, I believe Arn was second only to Ric as a promo cutter.  The cool, sinister matter of fact approach Ole had most of the time, loved it even in the 70's with he and Gene.  Tully...what can be said...the ultimate antagonist, always saying just enough to piss you off!!!  J.J., cool calm, diginified, always a pleasure to listen to.  And of course, the Champ...you never knew which Nature Boy was going to show up in a promo...to say he was and is a chameleon on the mic is an understatement.  He is the greatest promo cutter in the sport's history.

Seeing Tully, J J, and Barry Windham open up.  I actually learned things I did not know in listening to them, not wanting to spoil things, I respect and admire Tully even more now.

With all due respect to the Champ, this is Arn's video.  Despite the fact he's kayfabing the entire time, his passion and feelings about the Horsemen show through.

The War Games Match, and the match between Tully/Arn v Barry/Luger.  nice to see Dr. Death Steve Williams again...get well soon Doc!!

the Barry Windham ""Luger story""...I laughed so hard I had to watch it again.

Seeing Triple H, Stone Cold, and Shawn Michaels paying respectful tribute to the Horsemen, JR said it right, without the Horsemen, there would have damn sure been no DX.

The early footage of Arn, if you look quick, you can see a pre LOD Animal, in his original Road Warrior garb.

The clips of the feud with Magnum TA, who you can see had the potential to be a megastar before his untimely accident.

The footage of the locker room attack of the Rock and Roll Express, and the parking lot ambush of Dusty Rhodes...but if you listen carefully, right before the bat hits his wrist you can see and hear Dusty say, ""Make it GOOD!!""...I laughed a lot at that.

Seeing the true friendship of Ric and Arn...I would hope someday to have a friend that strong and close. You can see it in the way they express it on screen and in the promos.

The pride and passion in Chris Benoit when he spoke of his time as a Horseman...Ive always respected him and the way he carries himself like a true champion, with the same class that the Horsemen always presented.

Now the Not so good

WHATS UP WITH THE KAYFABE GENTS????  Its clear that Arn, Rick Steamboat, Michael PS Hayes, and maybe even Dusty and HHH are all speaking in their wrestling characters.  WHY???  If most of the people are speaking out of character why is ARN especially speaking in character?  Oh well, Im still Arns biggest fan. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!

Why are Michael Hayes, Teddy Long, Jerry Lawler and especially ERIC FREAKING BISCHOFF in this DVD????  I clearly see no reason for ANY of them to be there.  If you wanted more people, you should have spoken to Ole, Lex, Magnum, and even Jimmy Garvin or Jim Cornette.  Those four people really have NO REASON to be included!!!!  And PLEASE...would someone just put Paul Roma out of his and our misery!!!  The biggest thing he would ever do, and he whines and moans about Ric Flair.  This from a man who couldn't even hold Mongo McMichaels jockstrap.  Someone at WWE must really have a Jones for the not so Pretty Paul to include him on this and not Mongo. Sting I can understand because hes under contract to TNA, but ROMA????  SHEESH!!

The matches could have been a little better selection, showing them against Magnum/Dusty, Arn and Ole winning the National Tag Titles, more footage of them just wreaking overall havoc. I really could have cared less about the cage match with Ricky Morton!

Barry Windham...what happened???  My heart ached when I saw him.  I realize hes in his forties like I am, but MY GOD MAN...I was shocked at how he looked.

The two biggest disappointments to me in this overall wonderful production are:  Seeing Arn and the guys made to kayfabe their way through the interviews...I just shook my head.  Secondly, and to me even more glaring, the failure to include the two most important on camera promos/interviews, the promo where Arn names the group, and the emotional retirement speech he made.  Oh well, perhaps the footage to the first one doesnt exist, and the second one probably didn't matter to the PTB (powers that be) at WWE...for that, well, theres always the ""eB"" word!!!

Overall, Im glad that WWE productions has released this DVD and the earlier AWA tribute DVD.  Now if we could only get them to start releasing territory based DVD's.  The best of Mid-Atlantic, Florida, Mid-South, Mid Southern, World Class, Pacific Northwest of the 70's and 80's.  Can you imagine how well those would sell??  Think about it Vince!!!!!!!",1176768000,29,5645,4.643794147325933
2703816,5,B000LC3III,"The first disc lone made it worth it. This disc is not only for anyone who loved the Horseman but classic wrestling as well. The only bringdown here is that Arn Anderson mostly stays in character. While it's dissapointing that's not WWE's fault since they obvioulsy couldn't have

excluded him from the disk. The other interviews on the disk more than make up for it. If you want to hear Ric Flair really shoot this is the disk to buy. The comments on Sid Vicious alone are great. Also fun is everyone ripping apart Paul Roma and hearing Roma's (mind-boggling) view.

  Yes, there could have been three discs and some better match selections. But I'm rating this on what it DOES have and what it does have is fantastic. I always rate these types of discs on the strength of the documentary and this is one the best to date. They did an excellent job getting interviews/commentary from nearly every member in the group.

People may not also realize that WWE hasn't been on the best of terms with JJ Dillon since he left the company. The fact that he's included here means they did someothing they don't always do (not even with their DVD's) and put the fans first.",1176768000,3,1163,4.519047619047619
2703817,3,B000LC3III,"Don't get me wrong - I was thrilled that WWE finally put out a DVD on the legendary 4 horsemen.  Overall, I was happy with the product.  However, I was expecting more.  Here are my main complaints:

1.  Lack of matches.  Where's War Games 1997?  WWE has put out War Games 1996 in a few other DVD releases, so that didn't bother me.  But 1997 should have been there!

2.  Some people were doing interviews in character, while others were telling it like it actually was.  No releases such as these should be in character.  That's not the point of these releases!

3.  It should have been a 3 disc set to fit in all the stuff that should have been on here.  They also should have covered more of the 90's and less on the 80's in my opinion.

Other than that, I guess I was happy overall. Look at it this way:  They could have skipped the Horsemen all together!",1176681600,11,858,4.197530864197531
2703818,5,B000LC3III,"Since everyone has reviewed the content on the DVD already, I'll just state 2 things that bothered me about the DVD.

Why did Arn Anderson do most of his interview ""in character."" It's a liitle strange to hear everyone else talking freely and then have Arn describe moments as if they aren't part of a show.

Paul Roma's comments are really dumb. I wonder if they took his comments out of context because he can't possibily have as big an ego as they portrayed him as having...",1176595200,,477,4.471264367816092
2703849,5,B000LC3III,"the best thing happening. oh back in the day me and my Homeboys thought we were the Four Horsemen. Ric Flair was the standard in Wrestling. now you had the Rock and Roll express, Midnight Express  and there manager with the tennis racket,  you had the Road Warriors, the Garvin brothers, and others,but there was nothing like JJ Dillion and the Four Horsemen. Ric, Arn,Tully and Lex Ruled Wrestling back in the day.  Arn and his Brother Olle were tough.  Tully use to be a tag team teammate of Gino Hernadez way back in the day.  all the classic battlers against  Dusty Rhodes,Barry Windham (with that Broke Vest) Rocky King who always got tore up. Thunderfoot.  Magnum Ta who use to rock the shag Mullett. Magnum Ta was something else before his accident.  so many battles and so much history,but Ric Flair and the Four Horsemen ruled. that was a fantastic time to be a Wrestling fan.  Steel Cage matches and everything else in between.",1176508800,,937,4.63030303030303
2703850,5,B000LC3III,"From Watching this DVD, I'd have to say that this is one of the best DVD's on wrestling that has ever been released and it shows why the Four Horsemen are the elite and the symbol of excellence. I really liked that it told the whole histroy of the Horsemen, both the good(the early years, how they came together, etc.) and the bad(how they were used at the end of Jim Crockett Promotions and WCW, especially the horrible way they mocked Arn Anderson's retirement speech). I also thought that it was intresting on what Flair and Arn Anderson though of some of the subsequent members whether good(Windham, Pillman, Benoit) or bad(Sid, Paul Roma).

I also thought that the promos that were on the DVD were excellent and shows why they entertained people for so long. The only thing I didn't like about the DVD is the match selection, I thought that WWE could have selected better matches to show the Four Horsemen in their glory.

Other than the match selection, this DVD shows why the Four Horsemen are the symbol of excellence in wrestling.",1176508800,,1039,4.641304347826087
2703851,5,B000LC3III,"This was a great dvd about the group they call the four horsemen the dvd doc is pretty long over two hours the dvd talks about arn and ole anderson before the horsemen then they talked about the rich lifestyle of the horsemen they talk about ole being kick out then luger taking his place then they go over barry windhams part in the horsemen then they go over arn anderson & tully blancherd leaving for wwe then they go over tully blancherd drug test then ric flair wwe slint then paul romas horsemen slint along with sids and sting over all great dvd

the extras some great interviews and promos with the horesmen also so matches i just wish their where more",1176422400,,660,4.365853658536586
2703852,4,B000LC3III,"I really enjoy this dvd and have always been a huge horsemen fan. The documentary section is very well done and covers differing sides of the group from the perspective of members and contemporaries alike. Several excerpts from HHH,Jerry Lawler,Steve Austin,Shaun Michaels,Teddy Long and Jim Ross permeate the disc. Dusty Rhoades and Paul Ellering also contribute their insight into the horsemen phenomenon. I was disappointed in some of the match selections. I know some can be found on other disc but I would of liked to have seen some of Tully's matches with magnum T.A. or Flair against Luger. Even some of flairs matches against the road warriors in singles competition,Arn and Flair vs. Doom,Sid vicious vs. Sting and finally some matches against the new world order.

 The disc is a testament to way a wrestler worked the mic and the ring,which is a lost art form today. I highly recommend this disc to any wrestling fan.",1176336000,,928,4.904458598726115
2703853,4,B000LC3III,"I really enjoyed the interviews on disc one. Honestly, that is what carried the whole set. I was disappointed that the selection of matches they selected. I mean, with all the legendary matches they had with superstars, they had the nerve to show Tully, Arn, and Ric, vs. Rocky King, Pez Whatley, and the Italian Stallion! People did not buy this set for those type of matches, I certainly did not. And the War Games from 1988?! The 1987 was the original and THE best! They left out how J.J. Dillon throwed champaign in Sting's face, the feuds with Ronnie and Jimmy Garvin (They showed that date with Precious) Dusty Rhodes beating the crap out of Tully Blanchard with a bat, and Tully and Arn's brief feud with the Midnight Express. again, very good, but the match selection could have been a whole lot better. If this was a Crockett/Turner owned DVD, I am sure we would have gotten the Total Package (no pun intended)",1176249600,,919,4.575757575757576
2703854,4,B000LC3III,"I've been waiting on this dvd for sometime, and finally got it yesterday. The documentary part is over 2 hours, which is rare for a WWE non-ppv release. It pretty much covers everything you could imagine about the Horsemen. You get insight from almost all the former members, even frickin' Paul Roma(wonder what rock they looked under to find him). No Jeff Jarrett or Mongo, thankfully, as they were disgraces along with Roma. Then only real drawback I can find is that Arn Anderson needs a reality check. Either he doesn't realize it or just won't admit that the wrestling business is fake. Yes, they get hurt during matches, but the animosity and angles are all created. To hear him talk about breaking Dusty Rhodes' arm and say he doesn't know how they didn't get arrested just makes him look like a big goof, and this goes on the entire dvd. Flair, HHH, Benoit and everyone else talk about everything in storyline aspect. Blanchard sometimes has the same problem AA does, and it's just annoying. We're not dumb. We know wrestling is planned. Don't insult our intelligence. Other than that, and the fact that the matches could've been picked alot better, this is worth the buy.",1176249600,,1180,4.733009708737864
2703855,5,B000LC3III,"Before the nWo, DX, and Evolution...there was the Four Horsemen. This was the elite stable/faction in wrestling that dominated the late 1980's in the NWA to the point where they're influence on wrestling is still being felt to this day & will be felt on throughout professional wrestling. In this DVD, you get comments from almost all the horsemen except Brian Pillman (R.I.P.), Sting, Sid, Ole Anderson, Lex Luger, Jeff Jarrett, and Steve McMichael. With that said, you hear from all other members of the Horsemen and how they rated each member of the group.

The documentary starts on Ric Flair helping Arn Anderson break into the NWA with his resemblance to Ole Anderson forming the Minnesota Wrecking Crew. The real story behind the Anderson's ""family ties"" with Flair is discovered along with quick profiles on Flair & Tully Blanchard before the story of how all 4 men united against Magnum T.A. & Dusty Rhodes is told. How J.J. Dillion was factored into the equation, the story behind the ""4 Horsemen"" name and the impact they had as a group is also chronicled. Their feud with Dusty Rhodes is discussed including hearing the story behind the Horsemen attacking Dusty Rhodes in a parking lot & how that resulted in fans demanding that they would be brought up on police charges. The ""high roller"" lifestyle that the Horsemen lived & talked about on promos is highlighted before moving on the story of behind Lex Luger replacing Ole Anderson in the Horsemen. The funniest part of the documentary is next when Ric & Dillion talk about the Precious angle where Ric Flair won a date with her & how they were building it up until Ronnie Garvin (dressed like a woman) ruined the whole thing. The concept behind the War Games match & how important a role Dusty & Arn had in it is heavily discussed with additional comments from Road Warriors manager Precious Paul Ellering. The tag team of Arn & Tully is glossed upon before getting to the story behind Lex Luger leaving the Horsemen & Barry Windham eventually taking his place. The story behind the Horsemen having a monopoly on the championships and how that lead to problems in the locker room is discussed before Arn & Tully talk about leaving the NWA because they felt like they were being underpaid to the point where Tully mentioned that J.J. got paid 3x's more than he did for a PPV match. The aftermath of Arn & Tully leaving, the NWA being bought by Ted Turner, and the placement of Jim Herd in WCW's management is discussed along with the story behind Kendall Windham's association with the Horsemen with comments from Kendall himself. Hiro Matsuda replacing J.J. Dillion and how that made things even worse for the current state of the Horsemen is discussed along with the story behind Arn Anderson returning WITHOUT Tully Blanchard & Barry Windham himself leaving. The true story behind Sting becoming a Horsemen and his rivalry with Ric Flair is heavily discussed including the infamous ""Black Scorpion"" angle that Flair himself even admit was embarrassing. The story behind Sid Vicious being put into the group to the heavy disapproval of Ric Flair is brought up before Flair discusses how he left WCW (which was heavily censored), why his WWE run didn't live up to expectations, and his return back to WCW. This is one of the most interesting parts of this DVD as they talk about Paul Roma joining the Horsemen with Roma himself talking about what he brought more to the table that ""Pillsbury dough boy"" Anderson & ""98 year old"" Flair couldn't. The hotel incident involving Sid Vicious stabbing Arn Anderson with scissors and how that led to the Roma version of the Horsemen ending. The brief Anderson/Flair rivalry in late '95 that eventually lead to the '96 version of the Horsemen with Pillman, Benoit, and eventually Steve McMichael is gone into detail including how much of a role the ladies (Elizabeth, Woman, Debra McMichael) played on & off the camera. The storyline behind Jeff Jarrett becoming a member of the Horsemen is briefly discussed...in a negative light...before the importance of Arn Anderson's retirement is heavily discussed. The problems between them, Eric Bischoff & the nWo is heavily discussed as the story behind Ric Flair disappearing in '98 is told from both sides along with comments regarding the nWo's mockery of Anderson's retirement speech. The last version of the Horsemen is discussed along with why it didn't work out with everyone going their separate ways before ending the DVD on the legacy the 4 Horsemen left on the sport.

Matches Include:
Ric Flair, Arn & Ole Anderson vs. Pez Whatley, Italian Stallion, Rocky King - Despite what the chapter menu & insert booklet advertised, Tully Blanchard wasn't in this match, it was Ole Anderson.  This was your typical TV match in which it was an exibition for the future Horsemen showcasing both their offensive & defensive skills.
""NWA World Championship Wrestling"" June '85

Steel Cage Match: NWA Champion Ric Flair vs. Ricky Morton - Ricky Morton was out for revenge here against Flair for the Horsemen breaking his nose & as a side note, Ric Flair sure knew how to make one hell of an entrance for this event.  Ricky took the fight right to Flair in the beginning & even ""made an ass"" out of him at one point.  Flair heavily targeted his broken nose using the steel cage to assist him while Morton returned the favor with the cage later on.  This was a match that went back & forth with Morton coming so close various times to getting the victory.
NWA Great American Bash '86

First Blood Match: Tully Blanchard vs. NWA Television Champion Dusty Rhodes - This match had a very comedic beginning with the antics of both Tully & James J. Dillion resulting in Dillion bleeding worse than anyone else involved in the match.  With the way this match was structured, this was a different encounter than usual as both men were wrestling more of a defensive style & heavily protecting shots to the head while also giving out more impactful blows to the other's head.  This was a good match with great storytelling by both men.
NWA Starrcade '86

War Games Match: Ric Flair, Arn Anderson, Tully Blanchard, Barry Windham, James J. Dillion vs. Dusty Rhodes, Lex Luger, Steve Williams, Nikita Koloff, Paul Ellering - For those who never seen a War Games match, it's a two ringed cage match with a caged top on it & the first two wrestlers go in for 5 minute period. A coin toss is held (which the heels always seem to win) to determine who goes in next and the teams alternate wrestlers entering the match. When the final wrestler enters the cage, the only way to win is by submission or surrender.
After reading some of the other reviews, I know some would have opted for one of the two original War Games matches however this one is a special treat as this is a rare match concidering how it never happened on PPV or was released onto video tape unlike all the other War Games matches.  This was just a battle as it got real bloody & violent with all men just beating the crap out of each other with their bare fist before ""The Match Beyond"" actually began.  This is really just a unique match to sit back & watch to see how so many different styles came together for this match.
NWA July '88

NWA World Tag Team Champions Arn Anderson & Tully Blanchard vs. Sting & Nikita Koloff - They went to the 20 min. draw here but it was a solid match here from beginning to end. You saw the traits of what made Arn & Tully one of the greatest tag teams as they cut the ring in half & always kept their opponetts in control while Sting & Nikita held their own here as well.
NWA Great American Bash '88
(""Allied Powers: World's Greatest Tag Teams"")

NWA Tag Team Champions Arn Anderson & Tully Blanchard vs. Lex Luger & Barry Windham - The team also known as the ""Twin Towers"" dominated the first half of this match to the point where Luger he got the Torture Rack on Tully in the first minute & Barry had a sleeperhold so tight on Tully that he was able to keep it on when they both rolled out of the ring. The Horsemen later caught up & did what they did best in tag team wrestling by cutting the ring in half & making their quick tags having this match go back & forth between both teams with the crowd hot the entire time. James J. Dillion got involved in the end as this match didn't go long but it was non-stop action from start to finish.
""NWA Clash Of The Champions"" Mar. '88
(""Legends Of Wrestling: Heatseekers"")

Ric Flair vs. Arn Anderson - As they talked about on the documentry, this was a match that nobody would ever thought they see but deep down...was curious about & did want to see to the point where you saw various WCW talent sitting in the audience just to see what happens.  Since both men knew each other so much, this had various moments where both men ended up showing each other up at one point & hitting their trademark moves while at times countering the other person's moves.  This lived up to the hype it had down to the commentary putting over just how close & personal this match was but with who got involved in the end & how things ended up happening within the next month, this match would be the starting point to the reunion of the next generation of the Horsemen.
WCW Fall Brawl '95

Other DVD extras include interview outtakes such as the story behind the Horsemen interviews & ""The Four Horsemen Vitamins"", J.J. Dillion talking about this pre-War Games match & getting surgery, Tully Blanchard remembering a college kid buying a Rolex because the Horsemen did, Jim Ross' relationship with the Horsemen, Barry Windham remembering being busted open by Lex Luger, Ric Flair on his wildest night in the business, and Dean Malenko talking about how he met Arn Anderson & a funny story about a hardcore Chris Benoit fan who had no thumbs. 10 Horsemen promos are included such as Ric Flair's WCW return in '98, Sting being kicked out the group, and J.J. Dillion receiving a ring as a gift from the Horsemen. Easter eggs include two hidden Horsemen promos, Dusty Rhodes talking about Arn & Tully leaving, Ric Flair discussing Bischoff's reaction to Sting beating him, and the true story behind J.J. Dillion's ring.

Overall, WWE did another legend (or in this case legends) justice as they presented not just the best or worst but the complete story of the Horsemen. Plus as a fan of old school wrestling, getting the chance to see some of this old footage is just an added plus. The only thing negative I could say is that I wish they had the original War Games match on here since that was the one talked about on the documentary and it didn't make any sense for Dean Malenko to have comments in the extras section but none in the documentary. Besides those two little things, I highly recommend for any TRUE fan of wrestling.",1176249600,10,10792,4.60801665799063
2703856,4,B000LC3III,"I really enjoyed this DVD, though much of the first hour is presented in a manner that could be described as Kayfabe.  But after the first hour, the DVD begins to pick up, particularly once Tully Blanchard began talking about the payoff for pay per views and how poorly both he and Arn Anderson were treated.  Then we actually get more of the story concerning the NWO, Sid Vicious and Eric Bishoff.  Disappointingly there was hardly any mention of the Arn vs. Sid bar room fight.

Overall this is a great DVD for those who are both ""hardcore"" fan and those who are just learning about the business.  The extras are wonderful in the DVD as well as Ric seems to be much looser since his divorce.  For a fan who is pretty knowledgeable, the first hour somewhat dragged, thus the reason for a 4 star rating.",1176163200,,803,4.428571428571429
