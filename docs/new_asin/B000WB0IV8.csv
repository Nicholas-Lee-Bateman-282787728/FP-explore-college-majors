That aside, it does a dang good job teaching Spanish-it's clear, informative, and useful material.  And, you can't beat the price!  I would suggest this DVD to anyone who wants to learn Spanish...just first be aware of how incredibly 'cheesy' it is!",1213142400,,388,4.938461538461539
2963883,3,B000WB0IV8,"This is definitely a good deal for the price, but it's not perfect. It mainly shows two guys talking, one is the teacher and the other student, in different locations in Mexico.

A few minor problems: occasionally the audio is out of sync with video. Also you can't turn the background music off.

But overall I'm happy because I can put kids in front of it, let them watch it a few times, and surely they'll retain something.",1212537600,2,426,4.448717948717949
2963884,2,B000WB0IV8,"As I've seen all too often in language course advertising, the use of ""immersion"" in this course's title has been badly abused. True ""immersion"" means the student is exposed almost exclusively to the language being learned - even when it comes to explanations.  The immersion process, though, like a nuclear reaction, is supposed to be controlled - the student hears words and phrases over and over with the view of attaining the ability to think in the language.  8 DVDs is a fair amount of time for presenting material where the student would be able to see and hear Spanish being spoken in progressively more difficult dialogs, the dialog material dissected and explained using visual cues to inform the viewer of what the Spanish means.  Unfortunately, nothing like that happens in this DVD course.  While I realize it would be unrealistic to expect anything close to fluency after 8 hours of watching TV, perhaps 80-90 percent of the video time is wasted with the two ""actors"" discussing the beautiful scenery and the basics of elementary Spanish grammar - in English.  Yes, you will learn some basic Spanish vocabulary and simple phrases like ""I am an auto mechanic"", ""The table is large"" or ""The cliffs are tall"".  Like the old ""phrase book"" approach, you will learn some useful situational phrases. There are occasional scenes where the viewer is presented with rapid dialogs by native speakers which I suspect were introduced in order to justify the use of the term ""immersion.  However, these are not structured in any meaningful way with the course material and are not anything like true ""immersion"".  As a beginning course, it might prove entertaining in acquainting somebody with elementary Spanish, but I can't recommend it as a serious language course.",1212537600,14,1768,5.010238907849829
2963885,4,B000WB0IV8,"These DVDs are a great value when you consider that you get 8 DVDs for $30. They are shot on scene in Mexico, and the scenery is beautiful. It's also helpful for learning new words, because if you are learning the word for supermarket, then the narrators stand in front of a supermarket. This makes it easier to remember words and is also more fun than someone lecturing in a classroom setting. These DVDs also teach Mexican Spanish instead of European Spanish, which is great if you're American.

This video does not explain how grammar works. It assumes that the best way to learn a language is through memorization and immersion. I personally would enjoy learning a little more about how the language works instead of just memorizing words, but everybody learns languages differently, and the videos do a good job of teaching and building vocabulary.

The biggest problem with the videos is the typographical errors. When teaching a new word or phrase, the word or phrase appears typed on the screen. Many of these words or phrases are misspelled, and accent marks are never included. You will have to double check the spelling of every word you learn, and this is time consuming and no fun.",1205193600,17,1194,4.763285024154589

8221996,2,B000WB0IV8,"Watching someone learning a foreign language as a means of learning that language was a bold experiment.  But, alas, it does not seem to be the most efficient method available of gaining any degree of fluency.  A for effort, but a D minus for achievement.",1425168000,,255,4.644444444444445
8221997,1,B000WB0IV8,"Absolutely useless! Waste of time and money. The only thing worse is Rosetta Stone.
I've done some other language courses (including Pimsleur and Michel Thomas) and this is by far the worst.

8221998,1,B000WB0IV8,"This is called ""Complete Spanish Immersion"" but 98 percent of the DVDs are in English.  The teacher and his student are both non-native speakers, and there is very little time devoted to listening to native speakers.  This is about the most low-budget piece of garbage I have ever seen.  It is edited so poorly that some of the scenes are not even in the correct order!  They don't even have wireless microphones so if they aren't holding the microphone appropriately you can't even hear what they are saying.  The teacher and his student appear to be having some sort of a bromance and spend far more time flirting with each other than they do introducing or practicing vocabulary. If you are thinking about buying this DVD, don't.  I am very, very, very disappointed.  I have learned much, much MUCH more by watching the Spanish channel on TV for 15 minutes than I have learned from this piece of JUNK!!!",1279238400,2,906,4.660377358490566

The entire first DVD is like this, and three quarters of the second and the rest are spotty at best. This is so bad how could they miss it? They must be aware that they are sending out a defective product. It's not that the DVDs aren't functioning, they were NEVER dubbed. Horrible product.",1242259200,,421,4.341772151898734

The setting is in Mexico, although it is not a movie on Mexico, it is for learning Spanish.  They do take you to different settings to film the scene.  Our children also like this DVD set and are learning quicker than us.  It is a great homeschooling tool that we will use because we are moving to CA as missionaries.

This is the BEST DVD set for the price that you will find.  The pronounciation is real good although there may be just a few misspellings (check your spanish/english dictionary for that)  We feel like NOW WE CAN learn Spanish!!  With this tool and also some other CD's we have to listen to, we will be a step forward.  Our children love to listen to it too, and it will make a great homeschooling tool in the future.
We enjoy Professor Chris and his energy in teaching and the way that he makes comparisons to other words.  We are hoping that they do a follow-up series with even more details of the language to learn.
