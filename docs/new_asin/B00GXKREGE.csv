8628472,5,B00GXKREGE,"Once again, awesome dvd series. This alone helped my guard retention, and using the tilt sweep described in this was a great bonus to my game. If you are stuck on getting this or not, don't worry it's money well spent",1424217600,2,217,4.317073170731708
8628473,4,B00GXKREGE,"Overall a great dvd, I don't like to play the inverted guard but just knowing what high level guys are looking to do from the position is huge for defense. The cross grip sweep techniques(disc 2 of 3) which essentially is a position you will often find yourself in if you like to play the two on one grip, is great and well explained. The only thing I was slightly let down by even though it was slightly covered is inverting to maintain or recover guard. All in all I would buy it again and will continue to purchase his other instructional.",1399852800,,542,4.323529411764706
