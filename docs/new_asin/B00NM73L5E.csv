6667639,5,B00NM73L5E,Bill Bixby and Ray Walston had a remarkable chemistry that few comedy duos had.  Amazing timing and lovable characters that you really believe care about each other.  What happened to today's television?  I am so happy that SHOUT took these over and issued them the way they did.  Great quality and another series I can watch over and over again.  Love it!  Loved the bonus of Ray on The Merv Griffin Show too!  Excellent!,1423612800,7,422,4.621621621621622

Season One and Season Two of ""My Favorite Martian"" are both worth every one of the five stars that I am allowed to give to them, but Season One is still better better than Season Two.

But WOW WOW WOW!

After 37 first season one episodes, they were ready to take risks. They not only tried two Mrs. Brown's, but three Uncle Martins (who must find agreement before they can can continue). Even adoption and Mother's Day make their way into the show (how often does Mother's Day occur on Mars?).

In about six months, I'll come back with my review for the third season, but I can guarantee that I'll love it. After all, I first saw it many years ago, but wish to have more than that to say when I do post my review.

As I did say in the other review, this is a very thought provoking series. Even though we know so much more now about travel between Earth and Mars, it is still fun to see all the discussion, and all his attempts to get home, and the times he aborted because he would hurt a friend in the process.

When my Librarian friend in Summerville can let me borrow Season Three, I think I'll rewatch One and Two. They are worth it. Then, every few years, I can enjoy them again.

If you have kids who like to question their teacher, they might enjoy this series because of the claims that Uncle Martin makes at times, things he has said to characters throughout history and more.

I highly recommend all three seasons of MY Favorite Martian, and I bet you can capitalize MY also.

6667651,3,B00NM73L5E,"I dunno. I wasn't too impressed with this season. It's a little strange for a series to go bad this early on, but that's just what's happening here. All the episodes have pretty much the same storyline. Uncle Martin gets ill or causes some accident to occur, and he and Tim have to think of a way to put everything right again; while at the same time preventing others around them from finding out Martin's a Martian. Oh, and get this: this season, Martin is even at times able to erase people's memories! I mean, come on! shouldn't Martians have their limitations too?

At the same time, Tim O'Hara appears to be unemployed this season. He's always at the apartment. He never goes to work at all! As a matter of fact, Tim & Martin spend almost the entire season at home! This isn't like the first season, where they are frequently out and about, getting involved with things like rescuing a kid from a high cliff or competing in a painting contest, or trying to get an interview with a high diplomatic figure from a foreign country, or even joining the space program! Here all they pretty much do is cause some accident and try to resolve it and 95% of the season is spent in the apartment with Tim O'Hara never going to work.

Truthfully, three stars seems like too much for this season. It's more like 2 & 1/2, for the rare moments when it still may be insightful. But exercise caution when contemplating the purchase of this product. It may not be what you're expecting! You may also consider just watching the episodes on Hulu. Much to my dismay, I just recently found out that practically all the episodes of this show are available on Hulu. Had I known this before, I probably would not have bothered to purchase this.",1425945600,4,1725,4.490445859872612

8679121,5,B00NM73L5E,"The Space Race... That's what was happening in America as My Favorite Martian came to the screen.  All eyes were fixed on the heavens.  A news reporter in L.A. managed to bring the Space Race home.  His name?  O'Hara.  Tim O'Hara.  Bill Bixby who would years later go on to play Bruce Banner in television's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Incredible-Hulk/dp/B00JB4TOPS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Incredible Hulk</a>&nbsp;has the honor of being the Earthman with his very own Martian.  Ray Walston, a well rounded actor played ""Uncle Martin"" to Bixby's Tim for a good many years.

Season 2 of My Favorite Martian definitely has the gents comfortable in their roles.  The comedic timing is spot on and the acting is great.  But what is great acting without great writing, I ask you?  Not much.  Fortunately these gents had a crew of writers who knew what to do and did it well.

Sadly we don't make television like this anymore.  There should be a requirement that each network produce at least ONE truly family worthy television program.  Maybe then I'll go back to watching television as it's aired instead of DVRing everything or getting it on Netflix.",1473724800,2,1205,5.335106382978723
