8753216,5,B01CJCQ8L6,"Excellent documentary examining the changes in the world's transportation systems.  Any intelligent person knows cars and bikes can coexist.  The car industry is making a huge mistake by not supporting bicycles and bicycle lanes.  Cities all across the world are already plagued by daily major traffic jams, which will only get worse.  Already the cost of owning a car is prohibitive and the car industry needs to rethink how they are going to sell vehicles if those vehicles cost at least 25% of a person's income to own; yet, spend more time stuck in traffic than actually moving.  I think there is a balance that can be reached between cars and bicycles, and once more roadways support bicycles, and those of us who would rather ride bicycles switch over from cars, it will decrease the stress of traffic congestion and parking for car owners.",1497052800,,846,4.847222222222222

8753218,5,B01CJCQ8L6,"Very well done.  The producers clearly show the benefits and problems with bikes on the road with cars.  It was especially interesting to see how other countries, besides the US, view bicycles as an alternative form of transportation.  This DVD was informative and thought provoking.",1473897600,,283,5.2444444444444445
