2277669,5,B0009CTV5E,"I saw most, if not all, of these episodes when they originally aired on TV as The Daily Show is a must on my TV line up. But I will definitely be buying this DVD set - finally, a DVD set, it's about time! - when it comes out.

The Daily Show is a brilliant, hilarious, smart, satirical, and everything else that makes a TV show great, example of ""fake news,"" but surprisingly is where many younger people are beginning to get their daily news. The writing and ""news coverage"" is pure genius, witty, and smart. Jon Stewart, with his hilarious facial expressions, sounds, and overall reactions to ridiculous statements, makes this show that much better.

I can't wait for this and hope it is a great start of things to come - as in, more DVDs from The Daily Show!",1118880000,14,761,4.390070921985815
2277670,5,B0009CTV5E,"The single best show on television. Jon Stewart and his team of correspondents are brilliant, never failing to poke fun at the craziness and irony in the world, the media, and the government. I highly recommend it to anyone. Though Jon has some liberal leanings, he is a non-partisan comedian. :) A terrific show, and their coverage of the election was excellent. I saw it on TV, but I am going to buy this DVD as well.",1118534400,11,419,4.454545454545454
2277671,5,B0009CTV5E,"I certainly look forward to this release.  The Daily Show was one of the few refuges of sanity during the awful election coverage of 2004. Every year I say it can't get any worse, but somehow it does.  My hat is off to the team at The Daily Show for not only puncturing the balloons of the political candidates but the inflated egos of the news media as they stumbled over themselves in a pathetic effort to cover the election.  Hard to believe that ""fake news"" sounds more genuine than ""real news,"" but that is too often the case on The Daily Show.",1115337600,79,549,4.310679611650485
2277672,5,B0009CTV5E,"""The Daily Show's"" coverage of the presidential election was awarded the prestigious Peabody Award for media excellence for ""Indecision 2004"". It was the second Peabody award that the show has won for its election coverage. The Peabody Board cited the show's appeal as, ""satire that deflates pomposity on an equal opportunity basis."" I was on the screening committee for the Peabody Awards and I highly encourage you to watch this coverage if you missed it. Once you start getting your news from ""the Daily Show,"" you never go back.",1113350400,18,532,4.98876404494382
2277673,5,B0009CTV5E,"I was very excited to see that The Daily Show was finally coming to DVD. I understand it's difficult for this type of show to release a Season by Season box set but this seems like a good compromise for fans. It will include:

3 discs

All 4 Democratic National Convention episodes which were taped at Boston university in front of a live audience.

All 4 Republican National Convention episodes which were taped at Daily Show Headquarters in NYC.

The first Bush/Kerry Debate entitled ""The Squabble in Coral Gables"" Really funny stuff.

The Daily Shows live coverage of Election Night 2004 entitled ""Prelude To A Recount""

I can review all of these things honestly having watched the show since it's inception and having seen all of the above mentioned episodes. I've even gone to watch a live taping which I would recommend to anyone who lives within striking distance of NYC. The special pieces they did during the campaigns are truly funny from either side of the fence.

As for special features I really don't know but I hope that some of this information has helped.",1113264000,128,1072,4.731182795698925

2277697,3,B0009CTV5E,"As for the actual Daily Show episodes they are sweet.  The fact that this materials is now 8 years old and the jokes still hold up is a testament to the great writing.  With all that being said this DVD set is barely worth the $5 I paid for it.

The first 2 discs have only 4 episodes a piece on them.  The extras include Comedy Central quickies and half baked commentaries.  I have seen other reviews that love these quick 10 minute audio affairs.  Having heard them all the humor is a lot different than that in the episodes.  Non of the commentaries have anything to do with politics or the campaign.

2277698,1,B0009CTV5E,I originally bought this product as a gift at my local Big Lots and the DVDs were in poor shape. They had a weird cloudy and warbled appearance; only one DVD actually worked. So I thought I'd try to buy it again online. This set had the same issue. If you buy this... good luck.,1310515200,,278,4.072727272727272
2277699,4,B0009CTV5E,"I'm a huge Daily Show fan, and the coverage of the conventions wasn't as funny as the regular Daily Shows are. However, these are the only episodes on DVD, and they're still really good. Plus, Steven Colbert is still on the show, so it's extra hillarious.",1266278400,,255,4.565217391304348

2277701,5,B0009CTV5E,"I get my news from Stewart (and Colbert). Horrifying to some, but no one gives a more balanced account of the news that these two. Their coverage of the 2004 presidential election (DNC & RNC to Election Night) is first class.",1242604800,,225,4.512195121951219
2277702,5,B0009CTV5E,"At the outset I want to say that prior to getting this dvd collection, I was not a fan of the show.  Due in large part to the media, I did not think this was going to be good.  Quite simply, I thought that the show simply took easy shots at the party in power.  But as the 2008 Presidential campaigning started and I saw this set at a reasonable price on Amazon (I bought it used), I, a fan of comedy, decided to give this a shot.  And I must say that I have rarely been this pleasantly surprised.  Sure, I think that if you look at the show as a whole, they probably do take more shots at the Republicans, but it is nowhere near as skewered as some would have you believe.  And particularly this set of dvds, which pokes even fun at both sides for the 2004 Presidential election.

I hope that the powers that be at Comedy Central give us ""Indecision 2008"" on dvd at the end of this year (we all know they have plenty of material already, and we all know this Presidential election is going to give us a lot more comedy between now and November 2008).

A Former Non-Fan

2277703,5,B0009CTV5E,"Okay, the 2008 United States Presidential Elections are more than a year away and it looks like there is no escaping it no matter how hard you try but despite the political upheaval of our country. The 2004 presidential election coverage was handled with style, slickness, and humor by Jon Stewart, Stephen COlbert, Samantha Bee, Rob Corddry, Ed Helms and their guests like Hardball's Chris Matthews, Ted Koppel, Senator John MCCain, and others. I love how they present the two hosting cities of Boston and New York City. It's kind of funny how New York City is categorized as the home of Greenwich Village, moral decay, Harlem, Spanish Harlem and English as a third language and hosting the whoops, The Republican Convention. While Boston hosted the Democratic convention which boasts liberal values like same sex marriages and abortions for everyone. You can't help thinking that the two cities should have been switched. Corddry visits his hometown of Boston. Stewart doesn't have to room with Boston University students. Stephen Colbert is always hilarious as well as Samantha Bee, Rob Corddry, Ed Helms, and others. Who can forget the Zell Miller incident at the Republican Convention challenging Chris Matthews to a dual. I keep reminiscing of the Saturday Night Live sketches with Chris Mattews and Zell Miller. My sister who lives and works in London has missed the Daily Show and COlbert REport so she got this DVD package.",1186272000,,1432,5.046413502109704
2277704,5,B0009CTV5E,"This DVD brings back a lot of fond memories of the Daily Show, with half the cast no longer there. Rob's segments on life in Boston are hilarious. The usual dissection of political life is there and is always entertaining.

The opportunity to have these 8 full episodes [4 from each convention] is great and the bonus disc as well is brilliant. I hope Comedy Central can come up with some other similar-themed packages as well from this era.",1177804800,2,441,4.582278481012659
2277705,5,B0009CTV5E,"I am a huge fan of the Daily Show, and for my money, no one can beat Jon Stewart at political satire. I bought this right after the 2004 elections and it was a great collection for all the fun they provided-lies, flip-flops and open bloopers.

This takes it a steap ahead with candid interviews, and pulling gags on some famous senators. Definitely a must have if you love political satire.",1171929600,2,390,4.492957746478873
2277716,4,B0009CTV5E,"i live in sydney, australia and know very little about the machinations of u.s politics, but i do know from bill hicks , al franken , mike moore to a lesser extent and now john stewart, that it is ripe for parody.

this 3 disc set was for the most part pretty hilarious stuff, the comic timing of jon stewart is impeccable, i loved his appearances on larry sanders many years back, and he's just as sharp today.

 his regular daily show episodes  periodically appear on sbs (the cultural intelligent channel here in sydney...the same channel that shows ""oz"" and ""queer as folk"") but i'd never seen these before.

i'd love to see al franken and jon stewart join forces, man that would be something else.

  but i have to say, the line that stephen colbert says at the republican party convention, when he's squeezing through a throng of people ""boy , it's tight in here,.i feel like a turd of liberty being squeezed out through the colon of independence"" is the hardest i've laughed in years.

stephen colbert is pure comic genius, as is mr stewart.",1159574400,7,1048,4.561497326203209
2277717,5,B0009CTV5E,"Having only recently been fully introduced to The Daily Show and the Colbert report on Comedy Central (I have no idea how I haven't been watching sooner) I didn't know what to expect from this set, but being a big fan of politics, and especially shows that satire the subject, I had high hopes and wasn't disappointed.  While the segments that didn't contain Jon Stewart or Steve Colbert (and Steve Carrell pre-superstardom) sometimes fell flat, the rest was pure magic.  Watching Steve Colbert make Don King make a fool of himself was classic, and not to mention the irony of what actually ended up happening in the election and the continuing war in Iraq makes it an interesting watch.  If you love political comedy, or ""fake news"" as Jon Stewart calls it, then this is the show for you",1155945600,7,788,4.654676258992806

2277719,3,B0009CTV5E,"I've been a fan of The Daily Show for many years now, and while I really enjoyed their coverage of the US' 2004 Presidential Elections, I found this DVD to be VERY underwhelming. There are three DVDs, 2 of which have 4 episodes apiece (the two conventions), and the last one having ""special features"" - which are collection of various reports made by The Daily Show's reporters; as well as the hour-long ""Prelude to a Recount"" episode.

If you're a fan of The Daily Show, you will most likely enjoy these DVDs; but if you buy these expecting something more than old episodes, you will be dissapointed. There are very little special features (a few clips from various Comedy Central shows, the aformentioned ""Prelude to a Recount"" and the special reports which didn't fit on the other 2 DVDs), and - most dissapointingly - there are only 4 directors' commentaries; which - while quite funny - are short (the length of the reports - about 10 minutes) and have NOTHING to do with the actual show.

For example, hearing about Stephen Colbert's lustful attraction to a chubby Samantha Bee IS funny; but I'd much rather hear an actual commentary on her report - which was quite funny in and of itself.

In short, this DVD is dissapointing, and while a The Daily Show fan can enjoy the nostalgic feeling of seeing Zell Miller challenging a tv-host to a duel on his own show; those expecting more should look elsewhere... possibly in the excellent ""America: The Book"".",1140998400,7,1460,4.6953125
2277720,5,B0009CTV5E,"A lot has already been said about this boxset, so I'll keep it to what I feel are the most important points.

1. For the price on Amazon, this set is definitely worth the money.  The special features alone are very desirable from a fan's point of view on top of the stellar episodes from the convention weeks.  No one that likes the daily show will have buyer's remorse here.

2.  (Perhaps the most important point)  Think about this...the daily show has gotten liberals to buy a dvd boxset that covered their worst nightmare! I can't think of anything that would be a clearer indication of how good this actually is.",1130198400,7,617,4.513513513513513
2277721,5,B0009CTV5E,"pithy social commentary?  certainly.  stewart gets ""it""... or does he?  on one hand, stewart consistently picks apart the bush administration -- its constant rhetoric (iraq, war on terrorism, 9/11, etc)... flat out lies... corporate bias.... energy consumption.... ""no child left behind""... evolution vs. creationism....  homophobia.... breach of the establishment clause.... republican scandals..... incompetence at FEMA and other levels of government... the list goes on....

This is why it was, well... SHOCKING to see him and his ALL WHITE CREW accept the emmy for ""best comedy writing"" or something like that.  his guests are all white.  his co-anchors are all white.  his writers are all white.  There's a credibility issue for stewart here.  how can he legitimately suggest that the president did not respond to the hurrican katrina disaster in a timely and effective manner because the victims were mostly black -- to accuse bush of being disconnected with race relations in the united states -- in effect, a ""racist,"" BUT have ZERO representation of black folks on his show....?  hmmmm -- how does he reconcile the two?  If you're out there John, i'd love to here your response -- better yet, i'd love to see some black folks in critical roles on the Daily Show.",1128384000,10,1271,5.146341463414634
2277722,5,B0009CTV5E,"Indecision 2004 is the Daily Show's hiarious take on the whole mess that took place in mid to late 2004. With Ed Helms, Steven Colbert, Rob Corddry, and Stewart himself taking us to levels which we might not find funny on a regular news channel, this is definately worth seeing.

This set comes with three disks with 10 episodes full of laughs. I especially liked the election night itself, with the title, ""Prelude to a Recount."" John Stewart's remark on how the blue and red states have turned into a Blood and Crip gang war had me in tears.

Thats just one of the reasons why The Daily Show is so great, Stewart always comes back with a great joke or a wide eyed expression on just how stupid the polliticians can really get. He never fails to make people laugh and if he says a joke that might go too far for some people, he just smiles and says, ""Sorry, too harsh?""

The disks themselves have some good guests on them as well, with guys like Ted koppell, Al Sharpton [Who is always good for a laugh on The Daily Show] and John McCain. Some may not be as good interviews as others, but I reccomend Sharpton's interview, very good and humorous.

Other things you will see will be eight episodes with each of the four Democratic and Republican National Conventions. {I liked the Republican episodes better just to hear Stewart's George Bush impression.]

If you are a fan of the Daily Show, you should really give this a look at. Sure some of you might have already seen all the episodes on Tv, but get the DvD to remember them for the laughs....",1128211200,12,1548,4.417543859649123
2277723,4,B0009CTV5E,"When the dust setles, when the anti-Kerry/pro-Bush, anti-Bush/pro-Kerry material disappears and fills a landfill somehwere in Utah, The Daily Show will stand alone and point out the stupidity, the insanity, and the free spa service of the Democratic and Republican national conventions. Jon does a great job as usual, and his crack research team and correspondents fills what Jon can't do. If anyting, Lewis Black's comments and rantings will provide a real perspective of the conventions.

But it's not perfect. With little ""bonus"" material, and a less than stellar layout, Indecission 2004 gets a great and not a perfect raiting.",1123632000,4,631,5.31

IT IS BRILLIANT.  These guys are frighteningly intelligent.  It is gut-bustingly hilarious.  The extras are worthy of a mention also (Steve Carrell dancing to ""I Feel Good"" while interviewing - too funny.)

There is nothing bad about this DVD. There is nothing boring on this DVD.  There is nothing on this DVD that won't make you laugh out loud.  PLEASE release more episodes of the Daily Show.  Anything.

And Joe Biden -- the top Democrat of the Senate Foreign Relations Committeee -- gets a pass; absolved of the Mess O' Potamia....  The Daily show campaign coverage is like  sarcastic nerf-commentary from the lunch room wings, aimed at the cool table....  And the ig'nant sidelined viewers are emboldened for... an ""above it all"" passivity.

The Daily Show campaign coverage *is* better than real news, like Baywatch is better than lifeguarding -- it's more sassy fun!

(Hmmm... kind of like something ELSE that takes nine months...)  This set contains several classic bits (Zell Miller at the Republican convention is a standout) but also the painful hourlong election night show where the crew was trying hard to be funny when you could tell they weren't thrilled with the unfolding result.  It's actually the stuff that's not part of the political conventions that's the funniest, however.  Highlights include Stephen Colbert's hilarious ""Requiem for a Show that was Daily"" (watch the whole thing); Steve Carell's coverage of the then-bright-eyed-and-bushy-tailed Dean campaign; and Ed Helms investigating the spin room.  It's a shame that the Daily Show couldn't have packaged its very best bits, rather putting together a ""theme"" set instead, which means that there's more than a little dross in between the brilliance.",1121990400,8,1023,5.329192546583851
2277739,4,B0009CTV5E,"I am proud to announce that I am one of those 18-35 year-olds who (nearly) exclusively gets his news from The Daily Show.  Jon Stewart and company's critiques of the way the media has slumped into a 24/7 spin machine are both heartbreaking and hysterical.

On to the DVD - I must agree with the other reviewers in that this seems a bit slapped-together.  The Comedy Central previews that open up Disc 1 are rather obnoxious, as is the fact that Discs 1 & 2 both have long intro segments (though funny long intro segments) that must be skipped past in order to get to the main menus.  Speaking of the menus - the third disc is horribly laid out, with the two live shows buried at the bottom of the screen.

The studio portions of the show are uncensored, meaning that every time Jon Stewart drops the F-bomb you actually get to hear it.  Somehow, actually hearing the word instead of the bleep takes something away from the comedy.  Most of the pre-taped segments are still censored, however.

While it is nice to have 10 uncut episodes of the show all in one place, I wish that they had removed some of Stewart's more uninteresting interview bits and loaded on more of their election coverage instead.

It has also been noted that the bonus content is rather sparse, and this is true.  There are a few commentaries on segments from the third disc - the commentaries heavily feature Samantha Bee, though the other three correspondents drop by as well (including Colbert, even though this is not advertised).  Unfortunately, Stewart is not featured in any of the commentaries - though just as well, since they're all fake anyway.

Colbert's studio tour DVD extra is enlightening in that it appears that The Daily Show is produced in the basement of a crack house somewhere - though the Daily Show has moved to a bigger studio, so the segment has become even more irrelevant than it was to begin with.

To sum up - if you're a fan of the show and don't already have these episodes illegally downloaded on your computer, this is worth the purchase just for the historical value.  Also, if you don't have cable and have been wondering what all the fuss is about, this is definitely worth a purchase (though if you're at all conservative, prepare to be offended).

So while this is a good first effort at repackaging The Daily Show, I hope that they'll produce a ""best of"" clip DVD in the future.",1120694400,21,2390,4.5514018691588785
2277740,4,B0009CTV5E,"If you're a voracious fan of the show don't let my review discourage you (it wouldn't anyway probably . . .):

I love the Daily Show -- have watched it since its inception before Jon Stewart -- been to the tapings , etc. Stewart warns at the beginning of Disc 1 that the material is no longer timely -- I can easily live with that because 2-3 years from now it will still be interesting to recall (with laughter preferably) some moments from that crazed election of 2004.

My complaint is the extra material -- there's just not that much of it. How difficult is it to do commentary over 4 or 5, 3-4 minute long segments? Not very difficult at all.

I guess I hoped for better ""extra stuff"" in a debut disc from such a talented group of people. It may well have been that Com Central gave them little or no money to do the extras. I feel like it shows.

And I agree with the other reviewer -- don't like the Paramount ""bug"" in the corner of my screen either -- I payed my good money for these discs and shouldn't have to deal with that kind of perpetual blot on my tv screen.

And one more thing: Just want to make note that before the disc was even released, a few people here decided to celebrate and then rate the quality of the show (number of peabody awards, emmies, etc.) instead of using this space the way it is meant to be used -- as a space to rate THE PRODUCT. nuff said.",1120262400,27,1381,4.138059701492537

However, the quality of the release is my main beef. A Paramount release, with a dreaded network ""bug"" in the lower right hand corner!!!!! This is one of the reasons I buy DVD's....to get away from the obnoxious self-promotion of the networks.

In addition, the quality of the picture is equivalent to broadcast quality. Given this, the ""bug"", and the brevity of the package, I have to say I wish I'd saved my money.",1120176000,28,554,4.475247524752476
2277742,5,B0009CTV5E,"This DVD set is fantastic.  It includes all the shows aired during the DNC and RNC conventions, and the extras include many of the funniest election-related featurettes done by the correspondants.  Jon Stewart is my hero, and it's great to be able to turn him on whenever I feel like it!

The best thing about ""The Daily Show"" is its ability to poke fun at blowhards on the left and right of the spectrum.  Watching Jon Stewart's spectacular takedown of the people who marginalized Al Sharpton after his electrifying convention speech is truly a thing of beauty.  Not even frequent ""Daily Show"" guest Brian Williams was safe.  However, Stewart's liberal leanings are not easy to hide, especially when you compare his treatment of the Sharpton speech to his treatment of Zell Miller's similarly electrifying oration at the RNC.  Both men have been guests of his on the show.  (Well, Sharpton was actually Colbert's guest, and that hilarious interview is included in the extas.)

Also among the extras are the broadcasts of the election night coverage and the show they did after the first debate, an animated ""School House Rock""-style demo of mid-term elections, John Edwards' announcement of his presidential candidacy, and commentary on select features.  The set is well worth the money because it's chock-full of funny tidbits.  And just like ""America: The Book"", every single part of it is funny, including the blurbs on the packaging.

My favorite extra by far is the rendition of the National Anthem that Samantha Bee, Stephen Colbert, Rob Corddry and Ed Helms do in harmony.  It's funny, because everything they do seems to be funny, but it actually is an honest-to-goodness performance not meant to be humorous per se.  Who knew they could sing?  Maybe the next ""Daily Show"" project will be a CD!",1120176000,12,1803,4.943521594684386
2277743,5,B0009CTV5E,"Being a fan of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart for many years, I was ecstatic to hear that, finally, a DVD would be released, and what better material to release than their Emmy-award-winning coverage of the 2004 election.  Throughout 2004, I found most of my news from The Daily Show.  For those who are interested in politics and need a good laugh will find all they need in this awesome three-disc collection.  The package is a box that contains three thinpaks.  The first disc, ""The Race from the White House,"" contains all four episodes of coverage from the Democratic National Convention in Boston, just as the second disc, ""Target New York,"" contains all four epiodes of coverage from the Republican National convention.  These episodes are hosted by Jon Stewart and supported by Stephen Colbert, Rob Corddry, Ed Helms, Samantha Bee, and Lewis Black.  Each disc contains hilarious intros by Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert.  The third disc is filled with bonus material.  Bonus episodes include their coverage of the first presidential debate ""The Squabble in Coral Gables"" and their live election coverage ""Prelude to a Recount"".  There also is John Edwards declaring his presidential candidacy live on The Daily Show, an animated short ""Daily Show Rock!"", a parody of the Swift Boat effort ""Continental Skiff Boat Oarsmen for Veracity"", and the National Anthem sung by correspondents Bee, Colbert, Corddry, and Helms.  Also on the bonus disc are pieces from each correspondent.  There are reports by Bee, Colbert, Corddry, Helms, Steve Carell, and Bob Wiltfong.  Worth noting is audio commentary on Bee's and Corddry's reports, which rarely comment on the piece while the correspondents just have crazy conversation.

Some people may believe that this is dated material that isn't as funny now or the future as it was when it actually occurred, but for those of you who paid close attention to the election year of 2004 will never forget the craziness that happened, and also should never forget the even crazier intepretation that The Daily Show gave.  And for those of you new to The Daily Show, I highly recommend it, weeknights on Comedy Central.",1120003200,13,2159,5.02808988764045
2277744,5,B0009CTV5E,"The Daily Show is pretty good, but I suggest watching CNN instead.  Much more outrageous and, unlike the Daily Show, can NEVER be confused with real news.  Fox News is too far out there to have even a little credibility and I find their humor to be far too crude.  The Daily Show is a great news source, but, if you want laughs, stick with CNN or the Network News!",1119830400,17,364,4.171428571428572
2277745,5,B0009CTV5E,"Although the DVD hasn't come out yet, I watch The Daily Show faithfully, especially during the election. So, having seen all the episodes, I can tell you that this DVD will be in my DVD player soon and hopefully your's too. It's so funny that you'll find yourself watching it over and over. It's one of only a few TV shows worthy of 5 stars.",1119484800,10,341,4.2615384615384615

The second four episodes are of the RNC in NYC. Famous people appear who go on to better jobs. Insightful. Interviews.

The third disk contains an Election Night show and bits from previous show. Occasionally pulls the curtain back on the American election process.",1489449600,,457,4.846153846153846

This provides great coverage of the election and is also very funny to watch because Stephen Colbert is still one of Jon's correspondents, and because half of the videos are of Barack Obama and Joe Biden comes on the show, just strange to see them before they even ran!",1353456000,2,376,4.544117647058823
