7781178,5,B01H7QA5XG,"Had to satisfy my Veep fix. Couldn't wait for the DVD's so I downloaded to my laptop (it's worth having to cock my ear over its incessant humming). Suggestion for the show: Get rid of that annoying-more-issues-than-a-newsstand daughter Catherine. She's hogging up scenes that can be given to Roger Furlong and Jonah Ryan. At the rate she's going, by season 6, she'll be a Resistance bitch and by 7, she'll be joining ISIS. Don't kill her off, though. I don't want her to be martyred. No, I want her ass to go the same way brother Chuck went on Happy Days: like gone and never talked about again. Ever.

I know I'm not alone here!",1494720000,,629,4.469565217391304
7781179,1,B01H7QA5XG,Crappy- ion a single word that's it.,1494547200,,36,4.285714285714286
7781180,5,B01H7QA5XG,"The back cover of the ""Veep, Season 5"" DVD case features a quote extolling the show's use of obscenity-laced dialogue, so if you are in as far as this fifth season, you should by now be completely accustomed to it (by all accounts it's fairly realistically observed as far as D.C. behind-the-scenes political dealings are concerned, which is what this series is about).  The quote also mentions the show's ""funny satire,"" and that satirical edge is still present in spades throughout these ten episodes whose main story arc is about the resolution of the electoral tie from last season's presidential election.  A worthwhile side benefit of this story is the vivid lesson we get in how such a tie would be resolved constitutionally.

The cast - beyond the always stellar Julia Louis-Dreyfus as President Selina Meyer - is as excellent as ever, so I will only mention a couple of long-timers for whom this season represents a series high point so far: Timothy Simons (as the ludicrously tall and unfiltered Jonah Ryan) is manipulated into running for Congress from New Hampshire, and there is no end to the hilarity that ensues; Matt Walsh (as Mike McLintock) receives more focus, as his domestic life and career are moving in opposite directions, resulting in increasing difficulty in his post as White House press secretary, who - under the bright lights - has to try to spin the unending chaos of the Selina Meyer administration.  Whereas last season Anna Chlumsky (as Amy Brookheimer) had the fantastic meltdown scene, this time it's Tony Hale (as Meyer's supposedly meek and emasculated personal assistant Gary Walsh) who finally [in the season's final episode] gets his chance to unload on her political team who lack his sense of total devotion to their boss (he is especially upset with the senatorial traitor-in-their-midst, Tom James [Hugh Lawrie], whom he had accidentally - and much to his horror - witnessed boinking his boss).  In the best Season Five guest role, Martin Mull is letter-perfect as the longtime political fixer (called in to head the Nevada recount for President Meyer), who may or may not be playing with a full deck, so to speak.

The series had a major behind-the-scenes overhaul this season, but it's imperceptible to anyone not watching it under a microscope.  I only became aware of this from the commentaries (of which there are six this season - all well focused on the show and the episodes and full of insights).

One of my minor pet peeves concerning the writing remains unchanged: the occasional wince-inducing puns that somehow manage not to get scrubbed before shooting.  This time I noted the ""Yemen/'Yemenade'"" one and the particularly impoverished ""We got to lance that Doyle,"" referring to Selina's own treacherous ""veep.""  If the character's name were Boyle - an equally good name - then I would say, yes, by all means use it at some point; but the writers should have learned in Punology 101 to avoid nearly all rhyming puns. Also, it becomes a bit distracting how many times the same ""joke"" about the mispronunciation of ""Nevada"" ia repeated.  (I hope they don't intend to do the same with ""Colorado"" next!)

Remarkably, they have gone fifty episodes without ever mentioning any political parties by name.  This might not seem realistic, but it is absolutely necessary for this show to function and not become divisive - or even worse: predictable.",1494201600,,3397,4.949033391915641
7781181,5,B01H7QA5XG,Gets better each season.,1493424000,,24,5.25
7781182,5,B01H7QA5XG,"Heartbreaking.  I was beside myself when I concluded viewing.  Had to try to cheer myself up.  One of the best Seasons of VEEP or any other show.  Especially when there is so little of anything at all worth watching.  JLD absolutely deserved winning the Best Actress Emmy last September for this Season 5 of VEEP.  Her performance is absolutely moving, poignant, affecting.  One can see how vicious and snake-like Washington, D. C. really is.  That guy back in the Watergate days, maybe Dwight Chapin, who said he would advise young people to stay away from Washington, D. C., government, politics, etc. was and is absolutely correct.  It is a seething poisonous pit of vipers.

This is a tour de force for JLD!",1493164800,,711,4.754098360655738

7781194,5,B01H7QA5XG,"For my personal tastes, the best comedy that's ever aired on television. Apolitically eviscerates everything you love to hate about politics, and offends the sensibilities of the political left and right equally. Typically amazing performances from one of the queens of American comedy, and a supporting cast that's just utterly amazing. Really, I can't say enough about what a fantastic show this is, and I'm super sad whenever I get to the end of a season.",1486166400,2,458,5.0394736842105265

Are you supposed to like the characters? Everyone is annoying and unpleasant, in an annoying unfunny way. Hugh Laurie was the only bright spot. The writing has gotten really lame. Season 5 has some of the worst examples of the stereotypical obnoxious ""HBO"" one liners. How many horrible jokes about genitals are there this season?

7781321,5,B01H7QA5XG,"This ain't TV it's HBO and this HBO at its best. As the best of HBO means Veep is one of the best comedy/drama series ever air through the medium of the small-screen.

Julia Louis-Dreyfus is the best of her field. Her body of work demonstrates her phenomenal acting ability. Its hard to find her rival, though there are acts, men and women, demonstrating remarkable acting talent now days. So to be the best of them is a distinction she has earned the old-school way: hard, smartly done work, done constantly over years of actively working. Julia Louis-Dreyfus has been blessed by Grace as an artist as she graces the production stage upon which she lets her well crafted characters show who they are naturally.

This final season of Veep is phenomenally good. Anyone in disagreement would be hard-put with rational argument saying Veep, the final season, is less than real and raw -- a phenomenon.

The final scene, final episode, Selina sits on bleachers in a little rain, in the distance are sounds of a parade, a celebration -- Selina's had she obtained the presidency. Dreyfus is brilliant as Selina, not just all the time, but most particularly at that moment of acting -- Selina's heartbroken moment. The heart of this scene is Selina and her heart is broken yet she behaves bravely. The scene has heart, shown smartly, aptly -- perfectly -- a display of excellence.",1472860800,3,1373,4.760504201680672

and unfunny.  Selina was a breath-takingly bad President with an outrageously clumsy staff but we had come to love the character (although we certainly wouldn't vote for her) and seeing her broken was seriously un-funny.

Veep's season 5 finale is a shocker, and one of the best yet; the final 3 seconds of the closing credits provide a clue as to the contention we'll see in season 6.

Or is this a completely separate defective product that has nothing to do with pre-orders? If it really is a pre-order you should have said so up front.",1467417600,6,316,4.56140350877193

7781355,1,B01H7QA5XG,"Like other folks I paid for this expecting to be able to watch Season 5 episodes on my Fire TV just like Seasons 1-4, but I am only able to watch the trailer.  It directs me to download the HBOGO app, but this doesn't work either.  Perhaps the regular episodes are going to be made available on Amazon Video eventually, but if that us the case, this should have been made clear before folks made their purchases.  Perhaps someone from Amazon Video can respond to all these 1-star reviews and explain what is going on?? There are going to be a lot of displeased customers.",1467158400,17,571,4.419047619047619
7781356,5,B01H7QA5XG,"I have always enjoyed Julie Louise-Dreyfus. If you do not like her, that could be a problem as it is her show. Just like she did in 'Seinfeld', she plays her character's flaws to perfection. She skewers Selina Myers at every turn. So if you are looking for a likable heroine, she is not that person.

Of course, she is not only a politician, she is now President. This show, just like the UK one which inspired it, go after with a sledgehammer the incompetence of all politicians. No one is spared. Everyone in office has an ego the size of a state. The one exception is Gary, who is her ""Body Man."" He is with her constantly and does everything for her. Sometimes these people hate their politicians. Not Gary. He loves Selina and is happy devoting his life to her. The actor who plays Gary also played Buster in ""Arrested Development."" He has been picking up lots of tv awards for these comedy roles and deservedly so.

Hugh Laurie is on board as a politician trying to get the presidency away from her. He is very different here from the character he played on ""House."" This character is a lot less likable than House!

There is the character Jonah who is reprehensible personified. There is nothing he does which is not repellant. So of course this time out he wins a Congressional seat. His opposite is Dan who is extremely shallow but very good looking and can turn on the charm when needed. These two hate one another and will go to any lengths to sabotage the other.

This time out the show does a very good job of coming quite close to the actual situation we have in this country present day. In Selina's race for reelection, there is no one you want to vote for as president. All the presidential candidates are all but consumed by their own egos and vanities.

They view you the voter as an irritant who has to be somehow appeased, if only for the moment. When they are with an actual voter they are forced into semi charming versions of their real base selves. You are wondering how the voters can be deceived by them and then realize that you are one of those voters!

Everyone in Congress is just as bad. They are all about maneuvering for better jobs in government. To a person they believe their full potential has not been realized.

No one wants to be VEEP unless they are fortunate enough to know that at the start of the 4 year term, the President is very, very ill.

Catherine, Selina's daughter has a bigger role this time. Trying to be someone's college aged daughter is this environment is like being a goldfish in a shark tank. But Catherine likes making movies so might get some of her own back.",1467158400,8,2622,4.425311203319502
7781357,1,B01H7QA5XG,"I just paid for Season 5 on Fire TV, but I cant watch it.  Amazon video lets you purchase either season 5 in HD or in SD. But DONT DO IT.

Amazon Video instructed me to download the HBO GO app.
Then when i tried to view Veep, it asks me to activate HBO GO.
Then I go to try to activate it but nothing works. Went to [...]
Then it tells me to login to my cable provider. So I login to xfinity.com
But there's no option to activate HBO GO.  Such an convoluted mess.

So I ended up going to Amazon help. Then on chat. I asked for refund.",1467072000,16,534,3.7837837837837838
