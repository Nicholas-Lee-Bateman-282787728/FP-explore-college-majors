3499464,1,B001BTODZC,this is a very stupid movie,1358467200,,27,3.6666666666666665
3499465,3,B001BTODZC,"I bought this DVD because this is one of my favorite Childhood movies. The reason i give it 3 stars however is because the DVD itself has not been re-mastered and so it looks exactly the same as it did on my old Beta max machine, in other words you can tell its super old.  However because this is how i remember seeing the movie it didn't really bother me and still enjoyed the DVD format non the less, because its still easier then plugging in old technology . lol",1339459200,2,466,4.177777777777778
3499466,5,B001BTODZC,"The first copy I received was unwatchable. The DVD itself was scuffed and when we could actually get it to play the picture was broken. I immediately requested a replacement and one was send to me in a timely manner. I am very happy to have this, this was one of my favorite cartoons as a child. You can tell that this is not a ""high end"" quality of DVD but I am happy to have this on DVD.",1323648000,,389,3.9367088607594938
3499467,5,B001BTODZC,"I have searched for a very long time for this movie!! I could not be more pleased to now have one of my own finally. The quality is excellent and everything I can remember that made it so wonderful. I was pleased with the excellent response time for delivery,dealing with the vendor in the future will be a pleasure.",1260230400,,316,4.372881355932203
3499468,5,B001BTODZC,"Our family is now sharing this great movie with a second generation. The story of a funny man who steals the childrens toys in order to have some fun is one in which young children become totally engrossed, they care for the children, the toys and for funny Dunderklumpen. Great songs fabulous dialog. A classic for our family and an absolute joy to watch, over and over again.",1243555200,,377,4.5588235294117645
3499469,2,B001BTODZC,I had been waiting for the release of this movie on DVD for years. I must say I am very disappointed with the very poor image quality. Worse than a VHS! This really good movie deserved better.,1223769600,2,192,4.216216216216216
3499470,5,B001BTODZC,"This enchanted summer night story brings the viewer back to a time where nature had a part in fairytales. It's from a time when children didn't grow up too fast and when the magical creatures of the forest and mountains still had a place in our everyday lives.

I love it and I am looking forward to the day when my children can take part of this Swedish heritage.",1116028800,,364,4.27536231884058
3499471,5,B001BTODZC,"This is a Swedish live action/animation hybrid from the mid-Seventies. Dunderklumpen is a lonely troll who decides to abduct a few toys to keep him company. The toys' owner is a boy names Jens who soon follows after him into the Swedish countryside and his father, guided by a bumblebee, tries his best to keep up. It's an engaging story, peppered with hermits, talking mountains and waterfall faeries. Rooted in both Scandinavian folklore and modern fantasy, this dubbed version will appeal to anyone looking for an alternative to typical Disney style animation and storytelling.",1080345600,3,580,5.180851063829787
8284868,5,B001BTODZC,"Wonderful, heartwarming, beautiful to view.  Sweet, peaceful, funny, dear.  My daughter and I loved this movie when she was a tot, now I get to watch it again with my grandson!  Life is good!  So glad you offer it here.",1497052800,,219,4.4

8284871,5,B001BTODZC,One of the best movies I've ever seen.  I watched it with my brother when I was really young.  It's been a family tradition movie ever since.  My brothers house burned down and he lost everything inside.  One of the first 3 things that I bought him to put in his new place was this movie.  Even watching it now as an adult makes me giggle.,1409184000,,339,4.075757575757576

8284874,5,B001BTODZC,"This is a fantastic little movie that I enjoyed as a child and still enjoys. It has a inner meaning, wants to say something meaningful as a real saga should, it shows you the nature of Sweden, has beautiful songs and a funny story for the small ones too.",1402272000,,254,4.204081632653061
8284875,4,B001BTODZC,I remember loving this movie as a child and watching it over and over - my grandmother had it on VHS back then.  It was fun to re-watch this old classic with my family and rediscover the fun and quirky characters and addictive songs all over again.,1398816000,,248,4.276595744680851
8284876,5,B001BTODZC,"We raised our children on this wonderful, wonderful movie.  Why this wasn't a bigger hit in America is puzzling, it is such a sweet fairy tale.  Lionel and his sensational pants!  My oldest daughter, now 36, wanted me to get this so her 5 year old son could know these characters and have these memories to grow up on.  If you want blood and guts and gore action cartoons for your grandkids, get some other movie.  If you want a hip, magical fairy tale full of greatly drawn characters they will remember all their lives, get Dunderklumpen and watch it with them over and over.",1388620800,,577,4.457142857142857
8284877,5,B001BTODZC,"As a kid my parents had this movie on ""disc"" but was never able to locate in English on DVD very happy",1388275200,,102,3.6818181818181817
