4503658,2,B004YVO62E,"Judge David Johnson, DVD Verdict-- This terribly titled set (i<3 icarly?!) brings three previously released DVD collections from Nickelodeon's popular tween show, iCarly. Miranda Cosgrove (Despicable Me) stars as Carly, a spunky high schooler who's found modest fame with her online talk show. She's paired with her best friend and co-host Sam (Jennette McCurdy, Minor Details) and the duo have inexplicably carved out a name for themselves online. Inexplicable, because as far as I can tell, their show is terrible.

Carly is built around the concept that Carly and Sam's internet show is high-larious. Yet I can't escape the truth that it is objectively terrible and would not exists past one day's worth of bitter YouTube comment threads were it not for the fictitious universe the writers created where two unfunny teenage girls can create a hit show on the air.

Don't let me rain on your parade, if you enjoy iCarly. It is inoffensive and that's saying something these days. And if you don't own any of these discs, this set is a good way to build up your library in a hurry. Also, you have to love the ""iFight Shelby Marx"" episode, where fellow Nickelodeon TV star, Victoria Justice, who may or may not weigh 60 pounds, plays a championship female kickboxer who beats up grown men.

All 433 minutes are full frame and 2.0 stereo. Extras: Featurettes, trivia, an episode of Victorious, and the pilot for Big Time Rush.

4503659,1,B004YVO62E,"DVD ""collections"" like this are an insult to the consumer.
A series should ONLY be released as a series, not a (somewhat) random collection of 4 or 5 episodes that will NEVER amount to a series.
If consumers continue to purchase these insults, they will continue to package them.  This goes for all the Disney collections as well...where are the missing seasons of Hannah Montana, Lizzie McGuire?  When will we see DVD seasons of Little Mermaid, Kim Possible, Bear in the Big Blue House?  Never, as long as we continue buying these junk collections for $15.  Unfortunately, when (only) these come out, dd wants them so either we disappoint or buy them (and increase the chance of never seeing the series on DVD).
You rarely see any other series on TV released this way (except real old series).
ONLY BUY THE SERIES.  BOYCOTT THESE COLLECTIONS.
NOTE: THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE COLLECTION...ICARLY IS A GREAT SHOW...BUY THE SERIES AS IT IS RELEASED SO THEY CONTINUE RELEASING THEM.",1309824000,22,977,4.791666666666667
4503660,3,B004YVO62E,"This collection is simply a combination of the three previous iCarly releases iSpace Out, iSaved Your Life and iFight Shelby Marx. Since the episodes found on those releases were again released in the Season 2, Volume 2 and Season 2, Volume 3 sets, this DVD release is really not needed.",1307318400,39,287,4.76

4503665,1,B004YVO62E,"Although this show has its share of sweet and smooth and funny characters, I think it should be banned.  Showing thet it is OK and even fun to stick objects in peoples' ears, pillows on peoples' faces, making prison sound like an ordinary fact of life...  I am not as worried that well raised children will fall for it.  But the fact that somebody even portrays these things in such a popular show with kids really scares me.  Not everyone is equally lucky or smart as to know better...",1397433600,,486,4.426966292134831

It was just like being home when this was on. We really enjoyed it. It's one of the most tolerable teen shows from an adult point of view. In fact, I actually enjoy it.",1347580800,3,342,4.196969696969697
