2254186,5,B0007Z4HAM,"Remember that line from the old Arthur Murray TV show, a line that the ever-smiling Katherine delivered between swoops around the floor with serious old Arthur?  Well, get through this set of five DVDs and see if you don't agree.

These well-constructed lessons don't play down to the student nor do they take too much for granted.  The instructors move through the basic concepts and moves, gradually increasing the complexity of the moves and sequences so that by the end of the fifth DVD you'll find yourself able to Salsa despite your initial misgivings.

If for no other reason than to just have a fun workout, give this set a try.  Gather some friends, load up the discs, and at least some of you will become proficient. The others of us...well, it still is a fun spin around the dance floor.  Grady Harp, January 06",1136246400,,822,4.63448275862069
2254187,5,B0007Z4HAM,"This is a fun set of videos and it is well worth buying all of the series. The lessons are easy to follow. They are broken down into small parts that are easy to understand and practice. With a little practice it is easy to move yourself from basic to intermediate. I have.

Well worth the money. Enjoy.",1135036800,,303,4.224137931034483
2254188,5,B0007Z4HAM,"This second volume continues at the level of quality of the first in giving the viewer an introduction to the techniques and joys of dancing salsa. Anyone who has chosen to continue with this collection of lessons has without doubt felt the joys of salsa dance and succumbed to its addictions. Salsa is one of the few dances that allow a large degree of creativity, this due in part because of the flexibility in the partners' frame and the attitude that is encouraged by the music itself. Leading and following is still of course very important, and this video gives many hints in this regard.

The video begins with a collection of warm-up patterns, all of these being drawn from Volume 1. The instructor then covers the inside (left) turn for the lady with belly roll and neck roll variations included. This is followed by the inside turn with a ""check"", where the lady is stopped and sent back.

Switching to the two-hand hold, the instructor discusses the hammerlock (which he said can form the basis of a ""million moves."") Many interesting and fun variations are discussed, such as the hammerlock spin, with hand drop and hair spin, with inside turn, with leaders left turn, leaders head loop, and the cross hand-hold with dual hairbrush.

The video ends with instruction on the cross-body lead, considered to be a `fundamental move' by the instructor, and he uses this to set up the techniques to be discussed in Volume 3.

All of these movements, at least with practice, can be done on a real dance floor, as they must if the partners are to really have a good time. But the size of the real dance floor will also dictate to what degree these patterns can be executed. A crowded dance floor is typical with salsa. After all, all who have done it are addicted, and cannot resist the temptation to get on the floor when its seductive rhythms are heard and felt.",1134777600,3,1867,4.6314199395770395
2254189,5,B0007Z4HAM,"If you've gone through the entire SalsaCrazy Lean to Dance DVDs, this one shouldn't be any problem for you. A challenge still, yes, but nothing you can't handle. Though all of the previous DVDs are enjoyable, this one is where the true fun begins. The reason: The moves are all about you, your partner and how to really master complex patterns and feel your way through the moves.

Moira Denike and Evan Margolin, the instructors throughout the DVD series, return in this volume with all the tips you'll need to not just execute the dance moves you've learned in previous DVD but to actually begin to feel comfortable doing them. One of the key elements to that, of course, is practice...and a whole lot of it. Beyond that, they also provide practical advice for both followers and leaders. Some of the advice includes tips to help leaders know exactly how much strength and guidance they need to provide to followers so they know what to do. Technical advice is also provided for followers to help them sense the moves the leaders are guiding them to make.

In this second intermediate DVD in the SalsaCrazy Learn to Dance series, you'll also learn advanced versions of moves such as the cross-body lead, the wrap check and hammerlock patterns. Flourishes, the Copa turn, touch-and-go checks, embellishments, hand-over variations and more are also moves you can look forward to mastering with a little help from Evan and Moira. Basically, all the moves you need to really look like a pro and make beginners jealous while you're out on the dance floor.

I have reviewed the entire Learn to Dance Salsa series so if this DVD isn't ideal for your skill level, you may want to check out the others in the series. In addition to this DVD, there are three beginners volumes and the first intermediate DVD so one of them is bound to work out for you.",1133913600,,1844,4.685185185185185
2254190,5,B0007Z4HAM,"I'm so proud of myself now that I've promoted myself from beginner to the intermediate level. Learn to Salsa Dance, Intermediate Series, Volume 2 is a great buy. The lessons are easy to learn and broken down in small parts systematically. The instruction is very complete and easy to follow. I had a crazy, fantastic time going through the DVD and learning every move and I am totally fascinated by it. Learning all by yourself at home is much more convenient and easier as sometimes you're so tied up with other activities that you miss your regular classes. I've had tried some other DVD's before but nothing is as interesting as this and I don't regret buying it. At first I was kind of hesitant about getting it but everything worked perfectly and surpassed my expectations in every respect. The instructor makes everything so lively that you don't get tired of it. He's a great dancer and amazing instructor.

If you are looking for a DVD I would highly recommend this to everyone. This is something that you shouldn't miss!",1131840000,,1029,4.716666666666667
2254191,5,B0007Z4HAM,"Never thought salsa would be so easy. Me and my friends had joined salsa class before but didn't work for me coz I got a job that involves too much stress. I was quite disappointed that I muffed the chance of learning something I've always loved. I'd encourage and envy my friends at the same time whenever I saw them doing salsa coz it was too difficult for me to catch up especially when you are working 6 days a week. The only time I could spare was on Sundays and you don't have classes on Sundays. I heard about this DVD and kinnof perked me up and decided to get mine ASAP! It's so much in detail and so interesting that you don't want to miss any part of it. The instructors give explicit directions and it never gets too boring. I've amassed so much knowledge on salsa...the moves, the steps, rhythm etc that I won't mind shaking a bootie, showing people my passion for salsa and my skills. If anybody wants to know anything about this DVD I'd show them the green `GO (for it)' signal.

2254193,5,B0007Z4HAM,"I joined salsa dancing group in my locality a year back but could not continue as my job required a lot of traveling. A friend from the same group suggested this salsa crazy collection of DVD's to me but I was kinda confident about the basic steps so I got this Intermediate, Vol 2 DVD and ever since then I have been hooked into it.

The steps are so well defined that I did not find it difficult to pick up even after a year. Now; I take this along with me wherever I go and practice my steps whenever I can. I have already recommended this to 2 of my friends and they have bought the 1st volume, now every time we meet we always go cha cha cha.",1129420800,,647,3.976923076923077

2254206,5,B0007Z4HAM,I bought this DVD for a very different reason than most who've reviewed the product on this site. I wasn't really looking to Learn Salsa but rather improve my Salsa dancing. I am very familiar with Salsa but I'm not very good at improvising so my goal for the DVD was to learn some different combinations that I can incorporate to the dance moves that I'm already familiar with. The DVD worked out well for me. The lessons were fast-paced enough to keep me interested and not only did I learn some good combinations but some new shines and crossovers too.,1144713600,,555,4.5049504950495045
2254207,5,B0007Z4HAM,"This DVD, as with all the others in the Learn to Dance Salsa DVD series, builds on the lessons learned in the previous DVD. As such, the pace is quick, the moves are more complex and the repetition of movements is less. Still, this DVD is an hour and half of pure fun for those who love to dance. The combinations are exciting, the music is invigorating and because the lessons taught show the lead and led what they're supposed to be doing, you and your partner will be making up your own combinations in no time.",1144022400,,514,4.309278350515464

The DVD is definitely for those who love Salsa and love to dance.",1143244800,,313,4.589285714285714
2254209,5,B0007Z4HAM,"Well versed in Salsa lingo. A veteran dancers. A number of real world hours out on the dance floor. You have got to have it to do well with this DVD because though you will learn a few new things, the focus is on how to capture the intense feeling Salsa dancing can inspire.

The idea with the SC Intermediate DVD is to make Salsa dancing seems as if it's innate, something that you just do not something that you just learned. Instructors assist with this by focusing on the little things that make a big difference during a dance: Hand pressure to signal guidance for moves, tips on how to relax and just flow with where your partner is taking you, etc. You will also learn a few new techniques on Learn to Dance Salsa, some of which include flourishes, embellishments, checks and more advanced patterns.

This entire instructional dance series by Salsa Crazy is well put together, taking dancers step by step (pun intended) to being a wonderful Salsa Dancer. The key is picking the DVD that best fits your dance level. If this one isn't a fit, maybe one of the earlier volumes will be. Good luck.

That's why this one was my favorite of the Salsa Crazy DVDs. The moves had more potential for freestyle-ability. Twists, turns, leads, shines, all sorts of things that I can do within a basic routines to really jazz up the dance.",1139011200,,350,4.318181818181818
2254231,5,B0007Z4HAM,"My first encounter with the Salsa Crazy instructional DVDs was back in December of 2004. That's when I received the 5 DVD set from my daughters for Christmas. I have always enjoyed dancing and was excited to learn a new style, which is exactly what these DVDs did for me.

I started with the first beginner's DVD and worked my way through each of them during the year as my daily exercise. I found it to be a fun way to keep myself moving and it was a lot of fun. The DVDs are wonderful. Except one thing: I want more! Any plans for an advanced instructional series Salsa Crazy?",1138233600,,578,4.254545454545455

When I first got this DVD...I was like WOW and started dancing everyday. It also works like a workout routine and it has helped me so much. Going to the gym plus salsa classes can be tiring and also making a big hole in your pocket...for me I'm doing everything from home. I get my lessons from home and dancing everyday helps me shed a few kilos. I just love the instructions and his innovative way of teaching. Any one can learn from this DVD doesn't matter if you are a beginner or an intermediate. It's so well elaborated that it won't leave you confused.

My friend gave me this DVD on my birthday and ever since then I've been listening to only Latin songs and dancing whenever possible even at work when I feel like nobody's watching me!

When she suggested that I should enroll for a dancing class, I took up on that idea but I never got round to doing it because my schedule was pretty tight most of the time. Then she gave me this step to step guide on salsa. It's really good for beginners like me. I am now less stressed and unbelievably enjoying exploring the exotic world of Salsa. I highly recommend this DVD for all those who want to break away from monotony. Add fun to your life!",1136851200,,487,4.247311827956989

I used to go for classes but I had to stop coz my schedule didn't work out with the daily classes. At first I was lil disappointed coz I was so used to with goin for regular classes' n meeting my friends and my wonderful teacher who was always so patient and cheerful...dat was something I was going to miss. Unexpectedly this DVD turned out to be a Ball! My knowledge on salsa has grown more n my moves...it's beyond words!!!

2254236,5,B0007Z4HAM,"Before Salsa happened to me, I used to be the most boring person ever! I was literally a sloth. A day in my life revolved entirely around eating and sleeping. My friend was so tired of my pathetic routine and forced me to get this volume for beginners. You can pretty much imagine that I wasn't exactly ecstatic about the idea of me learning Salsa but I decided to go ahead anyhow. Wise move! For the first time in my life I can say that I have a life. Its working wonders for me.",1136851200,,480,4.117021276595745

To get back to my old form, I was advised by my doctor to get into an exercise regime. So I decided to learn Salsa. That was a year ago. Salsa has become my lifeline now.

I would suggest that for those who had been learning Salsa for a while and want to further hone their skills, go and grab this copy today!",1136851200,,433,3.865168539325843
2254238,5,B0007Z4HAM,It's a funny story but salsa happened to me by chance. I was never into the groove. I heard about salsa but I had the faintest idea on it. Once when I was coming back home after dropping off my kids from school I saw a couple doing this really interesting and sensual dance...there was a huge crowd clapping for them and everyone looked so alive and so much into the groove. I feel in love with it instantly and did a big research on it but all the classes available didn't suit my schedule and also I was too embarrassed to join salsa classes' coz I'm already in my mid 30's and dancing with people so much younger to you is something I cant do. I asked my husband to join some class so that he could teach me from home but he had the same problem...WORK. When I read about this DVD I grabbed a copy for myself and it didn't disappoint me at all. I learnt each and every step the instructors explained...it's simple and easy to follow. The music is great and goes well with the dance. The instructors are so lively and energetic. I just love their enthusiasm and their way of teaching. Me and my husband dance every day and we are enjoying every part of it. It's a great DVD for beginners cos it's well elaborated and not complicating to learn.,1136851200,,1245,4.235294117647059
2254239,5,B0007Z4HAM,"Salsa happened to me by chance. I was never into any kind of dances till my friend introduced me to salsa. It swept me off my feet when I saw all the dancers dancing on the dance floor, I felt like a goon starring at them with my mouth wide open. Imagine how I must have looked standing in the corner knowing nothing about salsa and wanting so much to join them. I asked my friend to teach me some steps and I started learning little by little from her. I wanted to join some salsa class but my schedule is such that I get no free time for anything other than work. My interest in salsa grew more and more, everyday I would practice the moves my friend had taught and sulk for not being able to join a school. I saw the ads on the net and read the amazing feedbacks from people. I ordered my DVD pronto and in no time I started learning. It's a marvelous DVD and it sure is worth buying. The instructors create such an environment that you feel like you're in a dance class room surrounded by people dancing with you and a wonderful teacher teaching you step by step. I've progressed so much and now I don't sulk anymore for not being able to go for classes...It's as good as that. I would highly recommend it to everyone.

The ones I got before was a BIG BIG disappointment, A DISASTER! They promise you so much and you experience nothing but disappointment. I wanted to make sure that every penny I spent on any DVD's would be worth enough. This DVD goes way beyond expectations. It's excellent and the instructors are totally mind blowing. Everything worked out just perfectly and now I'm eagerly waiting for my 2nd volume.

Salsa Crazy came back in this DVD with still even more patterns and taught me how to do advanced versions of the Copa and the Pretzel and fun, sexy moves like the Hip circle, the Body Roll, the Hip catch, the Walk-around circle, and the Back spot turn. The other thing that was given instruction time on this DVD were tips for both the leader and follower on how to better feel the music and be in sync with one another. Learn to Salsa Dance gets an 11 out of 10 if you ask me.",1150934400,2,572,4.116071428571429
8054538,5,B0007Z4HAM,"Though much of Learn to Dance Salsa Intermediates 2 is spent on patterns and advanced versions of some initially simple Salsa moves, you'll learn some new things--the hip circle, the body roll, the back spot turns, dips, and the neck wrap. As an added bonus, Salsa Crazy has some signature movements that you'll also learn.

All the whirling and twirling that goes on with this lesson makes it a blast for anyone who's an experienced Salsa dancer. I don't care how many lessons you've taken or how many years of experience you have, you're bound to learn something new or learn to do an old move in a new way.",1150329600,,609,4.536363636363636

That means you should be familiar with open breaks, closed position, left and right turns, basic hammerlocks, simple crossovers, hand drops as well as contact points and signals for leading and following. Got all that down pat? Hope so because the patterns get even more complex on Learn to Dance Salsa Intermediates 2 as well.
