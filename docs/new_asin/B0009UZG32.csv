2323464,5,B0009UZG32,I just ordered this. I know both these movies will be a hit with my dad when he opens it on Xmas. Unless it comes damaged I don't see there being any problems.,1353974400,,159,3.8484848484848486
2323465,4,B0009UZG32,My family have been looking for Tango and Cash and got Cobra as a bonus... great value... it's already been watched several times...,1310947200,,132,4.782608695652174
2323466,3,B0009UZG32,"A double sided disk, with basic menus a few old previews with no extra features. For collectors only.

Both movies are roughneck, about tough cops and crazy criminals.
somewhat barabaric, jokes that don't really cut it, action thats mostly just violent for the sake of being violent. Not exactly an adrenaline rush, more like a crash and burn mismatch with comic relief that just makes you scratch your head and stare at the ceiling.

Cobra is cool, Stallone is great at being the anti-hero or good guy with an edge but this type of stuff is pretty worn out ever since lethal weapon and the days of die hard. Its definetly old school and if your a fan of that then Cobra is a must have and a major milestone for Stallone.
If you like in your face action, thriling chase scenes and murder victims
this is where its at. 80s action was all about tough guys and hot chicks.
Well that is if you cant Bridgeete Neilson. This is definetly a gun glory.
Perhaps this movie is responsible for the cliched Act 3 of a horror or action movie wherein the good guy chases the bad guy into a steel mill and they slug it out. Classic.

Tango n Cash on the other hand is like a freebie thats tacked on, its somewhat interesting seeing Kurt Russel and Stallone team up but there 1 time romp is nothing more than a hayride over a hill. Its full antics and
misfortune. They try to play off each other but its obvious there a mismatch of acting styles. I feel a little bit dumber having watched it.
I think they tried to mimic the success of Lethal Weapon but failed. How can you have Stallone playing a ritzy and clever wallstreet tycoon that is also the number 1 cop in his city? Hes too clean cut and straight forward, and alot unlike Stallone other characters whove had shady pasts.
Its almost like Sacralidge when Tango says ""Rambo sucks"" compared to what may I ask? If this were a western it would be Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid, but worse, its just an awful team up. Oh and it has a very young Teri Hatcher as Stallone's sister. Imagine that. Stallone without the girl this time.  Silly, stupid and uneventful. Avoid it.

Its this cheap for a reason,its old, everyones already seen it,some people own it,its probably available for free at the library, and theyve been shown on tv over a dozen times in the past 10 years. But go rent or borrow a copy of Cobra, watch it once if u haven't already, and prepare for the next big release from Stallone, ""the Expendables"" 2010.",1247184000,2,2463,4.404395604395605
2323467,5,B0009UZG32,"I was originally just looking for Tango & Cash, but saw this double set that also has Cobra and said hey- why not! These are two movies I grew up watching on TV so they were must haves for my collection.

These are probably two of my favorite cheesy 80's action flicks. I don't care if these are Stallone's (and Russell's) worst movies ever, I love em!

Tango & Cash is just entertaining with all the wisecracking and gun blazing that goes on, and Stallone's Merc ""lead sled"" in Cobra is just awesome (too bad it gets wrecked and fubared like every other movie).

My one gripe is this-the double-sided DVD is not marked as to which side is which movie! So, that takes a little trial and error.",1245283200,2,693,4.3565891472868215
2323468,2,B0009UZG32,"If you like Stallone at his taciturn and violent best, this may be for you.  Anyone else should take a pass.  The body count in Cobra alone makes many war movies take a back seat.  However, he drives a really neat car and Brigitte Nielsen has legs to die for.  With Tango & Cash, you get Jack Palance hamming it up as the bad-guy kingpin and Teri Hatcher for eye candy, but the story is so fanciful that one wonders if this is a spoof or just a really bad plot.",1236556800,,461,4.032967032967033
2323469,5,B0009UZG32,"So bad it's good?  YES!!  My buddies and I often talk about how awful (and awfully funny) Cobra is.  The best part is that Sly seems to think he was actually making a cool as hell action movie, instead of a piece of laughable garbage!!  We even formed a band, The Cobretti's, and our cd is a collection of Cobra themed rockers (""Eatin'Pizza With My Gloves On"" is always a real crowd pleaser!).  Seriously though....this is a bad film only to be watched while drinking with friends of a like mind.  Oh, Tango and Cash sucks too, but isn't nearly as funny!!",1235088000,,555,4.392156862745098
2323470,5,B0009UZG32,"I had seen both movies dozens of times, but I love them so much I couldn't help but buy this special pack.
Cobra is an amazing classic action film that has everything a fan could wish for - a great villain, the idiotic police bureaucracy. Stallone was a superstar in the making at the time, and this movie certainly help to speed up the process.

Tango & Cash holds, in my opinion, a special place in the universe of old school action movie, for it is certainly the funniest. I stopped counting the great one-liners after 20 minutes as I kept on laughing. The story isn't especially original, however the lead actors are at the top of their game. Those two really seem to have had a lot of fun during the movie. You'll find this movie hugely entertaining.

I recommend this special pack to all action movies fans.",1208390400,,813,4.449664429530201
2323471,5,B0009UZG32,this is a great action combo the movie industry should present more two for ones.,1200700800,,81,4.466666666666667
2323472,4,B0009UZG32,"For action fans, this is one of the best 2 discs DVD sets you can buy. Each of the 2 discs has the same movie on both sides: one for NTSC and one for Widescreen. Each of the movies has good picture and good digital sound. The films are full of action, drama, and romance. The DVD menus are incredible; each disc is like it's own single independent disc but this is a 2 discs DVD set. 2 into 1; you can't beat that.",1171238400,3,414,3.9404761904761907
2323493,4,B0009UZG32,I like Tango and Cash. Cobra is okay.,1479427200,,37,3.75
2323494,4,B0009UZG32,"It may be a backhanded compliment to say you're not going to burn many brain cells with this pairing of Sylvester Stallone action flicks.  This is the kind of fare that guys salivated over in the Eighties with its preponderance of bullets, blood, guns, and gorgeous girls.  Don't examine the plots too closely because they contain enough holes to drive a tractor trailer through.  The villains are pretty over-the-top particularly a slithering Jack Palance in ""Tango and Cash"".  If you were to give the edge as to which film is better it would have to be ""Tango and Cash"" solely on the basis of Kurt Russell's presence.  He seems to be having a lot of fun and his self deprecation brings out the best in Stallone.  In ""Cobra"" Stallone is  paired with the mannequin like Brigitte Nielsen and he looks pretty bored.  His acting range in this one can be judged by how hard he clenches on his toothpick.  Neither are classics, perhaps of their genre, but a terrific time capsule memento regardless.",1474588800,,994,4.699421965317919

The disc sides are so smooth, my PS4 almost couldn't spit it out.

This a double sided disc. It also contains Tango & Cash, which for my surprise, was an excellent movie as well. Kurt Russell and Stallone make a good different team. Both movies are in the full screen format. Cobra can be watched in English, Spanish or French whereas Tango & Cash only in English or French.

8067135,5,B0009UZG32,"I like the 1986 86-minute action thriller Cobra. It is filled with lots of looting, shooting, knifing, fist-fights, and chases. Stallone is at his best here. He wrote the screenplay. The film was produced by Golan-Globus which produces very good action films. Stallone is a police lieutenant in the film who is called upon to act when other cops are unable to handle the situation. He is brutal, as he should be, and is therefore called The Cobra. A newspaper reporter asks him inappropriately at the start of the film, after he shot a terrorist who murdered many people in a supermarket, Couldnt you have handled the situation without killing the man?
The city, in this film, is infected by a slasher who has cut and killed sixteen people. No one can find the killer. Stallone is called in. A woman sees the killer and the killer is seeking her to kill her so that he will not be identified. Stallone and his partner are assigned to protect her while trying to find the slasher.
It soon turns out that Stallone, his partner, and the woman are not only up against a single slasher but an entire army of anti-government murderers who Stallone must face alone when his partner is wounded.",1501718400,,1186,4.625592417061611
