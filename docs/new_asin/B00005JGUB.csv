7938665,3,B00005JGUB,"It feels more like a ""making-of"" documentary than a sexy video. Almost clinincal in its analysis of the shoots, so called imaginary problems, dizzy models complaining, etc .. If I buy a swimsuit video, I want the girls to be hot and posing .. like in the ""Wild Girls: Thailand"" DVD .. a bit diff, but hot nonetheless.",1149984000,,317,4.482758620689655
7938666,1,B00005JGUB,"I really was looking forward watching this edition of Sports Illustrated,because I have all the previous editions,and because I am a big Josie Maran fan(I think she is one of the sexiest and most beautiful women ever).
But how disappointed I was for two main reasons,
Firstly,the 'uncensored' tag is totally misleading. One would be excused for dispensing quickly of few $$$ without a thought just for this word alone,but this is all a marketing hype! I wonder what would the censored version be like??? Shooting fully clothed in the Artic??
Secondly, if you expect to be watching good photography, and lingering shots of these gorgeous women in bikinis,you will be sorely disappointed. This whole edition looks like behind the scene documentary for the magazine shoot, and what shots of models we have are annoyingly edited and are few seconds long at most. The last thing on my mind when I bought this DVD, was to hear photgraphers, producers and models talk and talk...
So careful not to believe the uncensored claim, and if you have the previous editions, then it is ok to buy this one too to complete the collection, but it will certainly be the weakest one by far.",1059350400,,1170,4.797029702970297
7938667,1,B00005JGUB,"Once again nothing that fantastic. the only thing that fits the description of fantastic is the word UNCENSORED.
does not live up to expectations apart from a few see through scenes. i guess i'll wait till christmas before i give it away.",1000857600,,238,4.690476190476191
7938668,4,B00005JGUB,"It's the exact same thing that they had showed on MTV a few months back.  Brian the new guy at MTV is the host of this telecast.  Nothing is new in the DVD, it is just like having the VHS version of it, either way they are about the same thing.",992044800,,244,3.764705882352941
7938669,4,B00005JGUB,"Yeah, it's the same 1 shown on MTV a few months back.  It's the same thing but just without the 5min commericals.  It is preety much the same thing as it is on the DVD.  Nothing new you need to see here.",992044800,,203,3.7857142857142856
