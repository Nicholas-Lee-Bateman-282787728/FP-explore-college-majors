8423323,1,B004COQ99G,"I just love all of Jane Austen's books and was looking forward to watching a biography of her life.  This DVD fell flat - just not all that interesting. Many interviews of people, like Princeton professor,  guessing and commenting on how Jane ""felt"" during her life. Several interviewees said the exact opposite of each other - one saying Jane was happy, another guessing she was unhappy.  Also interviewed people around the world on Jane Austen clubs or similiar.  All distractions.  I just wanted to hear about the facts of Jane's life, see her home, her town, etc. and just didn't get much from this DVD.",1332115200,,607,4.742857142857143
