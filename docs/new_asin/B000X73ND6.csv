8227194,5,B000X73ND6,". . . and this is one of the greats.  The story of taking the train from Moscow to Siberia in the middle of winter is most definitely worth the price of the DVD.  I can't even remember what else is on there.  I won't spoil it by trying to retell it; I'll just say buy it and watch it.  It is hilarious and eerie---in a way that only a train story can be---at the same time.  For another classic train story see the special feature entitled ""Quinoa"" on David Lynch's Inland Empire DVD.  Anybody got any more great train stories?",1389571200,,527,4.1683168316831685
8227195,5,B000X73ND6,Just don't watch this with small children around. A little older of a video but still some solid stories to listen to,1366502400,,117,4.363636363636363
8227196,1,B000X73ND6,"Good production quality.
If you want to know the depth of hatred some of your co-workers and neighbors of the liberal left persuasion have inside them, watch this video.  You will likely never put another bumper sticker on your car ( if a republican ) for concern of inciting road rage or vandalism.  Rollins makes it very clear that he is seething with contempt for conservative values in any form.  I hoped that by scene 3 or 4 he would provide some convincing information that would justify his profanity and anger but it didn't materialize.  Rollins has a formidable stage presence and I watched this video because his music video for ""Liar"" gives me goosebumps. What I hoped for was a clever, hard hitting panorama of his mind's musings.  Unfortunately, he stays on target here with laser like focus to vent his peculiar political angst.  He is a hard working performance veteran with a razor sharp mind, unfortunately like Darth Vader, he has been corrupted by the ""dark side"".",1350000000,,983,4.78698224852071

8227198,2,B000X73ND6,"Okay, you have a choice between recent Rollins DVDs.  Either way, you're gonna lose.

An unhealthy chunk of this, as well as the Live in NYC DVD, are taken up with Rollins' account of his time spent on the Trans-Siberian Express, a bit that's really not all that funny, and drags on more than his stories about his infected hand and almost stoning a fisherman to death Down Under (where this DVD finds him).  At least here though, you don't have to deal with the labored discussion of de-scenting spray from the NYC disc.

The earnest, intense rooftop commentaries seem kind of out of place as well.

That's not to say there's not some great stuff here.  Bush bashing is always a joy with Hank.  His musings on getting older are also a laugh.  I really loved his ""You really want my money son?  MUG ME!"" story.  It's just that this, like Live at Luna Park (but for different reasons), could have been so much better.
