8203181,5,B0001NXL2U,I came across this as a used copy from a rental shop that was going out of buiness. It was $1 so I said why the hell not? After watching it I know it was the best buck I spent. Don't know if this will be as a download but I hope so.,1325030400,3,232,3.3962264150943398

8203183,5,B0001NXL2U,"Director Ethan Minsker has created a funny, sexy and gritty world for us to explore in his latest film ""The Soft Hustle"".
  Shot on location in New York City's Lower East Side and in Atlantic City, we follow the trials and tribulations of ""The Businessman"" (Omar Rojer), ""The Artist"" (Colin Burns) and ""The Florist"" (Jimmy Drago) who are trying to make it on the Lower East Side often with comedic results.
  With fine supporting performances by Christine Holt, Catharine Lyons, Heather Litteer, Heather Soto, Alison Ball and the director himself, this movie is fun to watch and deserving of a wide release.
  The  kickin' soundtrack (which deserves it's own CD) features great music by ""Champions of Sound"" , ""The Goops"", and other great bands.
  Take time to enjoy ""The Soft Hustle"".",1084060800,5,785,4.931297709923665
8203184,4,B0001NXL2U,"It's a black and white ride with noises, voices and all kinds
of face colored by what's really going on below the ground.
It's also what is really driving the people of NYC. It is restless and just has been there and will be there no matter what happens. The next fuzzy funny thing will pop up right before you are about to get bored...You'll get it if you can ride on NYC subway.",1084060800,5,380,4.148648648648648
8203185,5,B0001NXL2U,"The characters in this film are such scumbags, but you can't help but love them. My favorite is 'the businessman' he's so skeezy, beautifully portrayed, you wanted to punch him in the face with brass knuckles. The Soft Hustle was filmed in the East Village and it's great to see the local spots and people that were in this film, you don't get too much of that nowadays. Definitely buy this film, it's funny and dark and each storyline brings in something new, and are tied together so well. Now, get it.",1080950400,6,504,4.489130434782608
8203186,4,B0001NXL2U,"A lot of films claim to be made in the Punk Rock style and of course they are not. Having ""punk rock"" characters in a film does not a Punk Rock film make. The Soft Hustle is truly a Punk Rock movie in that it is made in that style and mindset. It seems to say this is our story and [expletive] you  if you don't like it, make your own and then talk to me. If you are looking for beautifully set up shots, continuity and Actors who went to acting college don't look here. If you are looking for a film that is in your face and as real as the East Village streets and bars it's shot at look no further. This movie is a must buy for collectors of hardcore counter culture.",1080604800,4,669,3.9191176470588234
8203187,4,B0001NXL2U,"Popping in my copy of ""The Soft Hustle,"" I prepared myself for a film of brutal violence, crime and romanticized notions of ne'erdowells.
But instead, what I got was an excellent spotlight on the breakdown of interpersonal relationships from the points of view of three lovable losers.
""The Businessman,"" excellently portrayed by Omar Rojer, oozes such bada-bing sleeze the greasy buildup in his hair is the last thing that will grab your attention.  His criminal leanings become a joke towards the end as we watch his complete ineptitude at completing any task-- whether it be robbing a local record store or convincing his girlfriend why he should be trusted; even as he pretends to be gay so as not to be thrown out on the street.
""The Artist"" is the most sympathetic character.  Faced with the possibility of the realization of the ""American dream,"" he instead takes the road less traveled.  And in a surprise move, the viewer will be stunned with a finality that reveals his undisputable love for his creation.
""The Florist"" is probably the smoothest talker, but man most likely to die before he hits 35.  Juggling more women than the flowers he can hold in his hands, you know sooner or later he will get what's coming to him.
All in all, a hugely enjoyable film-- with some excellent cameos from East Village celebrities thrown in as well.
You'll never quite look at a game of quarters in the same light again.
Charlie Bodt as ""The Boss,"" in particular, gives the film's most engaging performance.
**** Four stars out of Five",1080604800,6,1532,4.769811320754717
8203188,5,B0001NXL2U,"It's just one of those films that makes you want to live in NYC and go out to the bars, and drink someone else's drink. Then have the bouncer kick you out. Wait I do that every night. The Soft Hustle was made in the East Village and after watching it I keep seeing the actors walking around or working in the bar it was filmed in Niagara. On this DVD there is a short film on the group that made the film. The Antagonist Movement it covers art, live music, and writers. If you are thinking of a move to the big apple you should watch this first then if you still want to go at least you will know the bars, people and all the dirty little tricks they will play on you.",1080518400,5,668,3.9555555555555557
