8331725,5,B001OY3ZGC,Guy Williams was born to play Zorro. Such a dashing and handsome man comes across perfectly as Guy Williams is all macho. Great masculine voice and in great shape at the time Guy still is a hero for little boys who have grown into men now. God Bless you Guy for giving us a real man to admire in his work for years to come. Guy Williams still leaves his legacy for his millions of fans who still love  him like me.,1292630400,,414,4.048780487804878
