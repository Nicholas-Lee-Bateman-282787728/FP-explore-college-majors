2772302,5,B000NNUX10,"I loved ""The Perfect Man"" (nice romantic comedy) and ""Head Over Heels"" (absolutely hilarious! so worth watching!). ""In Good Company"", however, is a dissapointing feature.",1250899200,8,170,5.84
2772303,5,B000NNUX10,"I liked having all three movies in one DVD case, the only thing I didn't like was the ending on Good Company.",1231459200,2,109,4.0
2772304,4,B000NNUX10,The first two movies are good and worth the money you pay for all three.  The final movie was not all that great.  I would give that movie one star.  But because the other two were good I gave the entire DVD 4 stars.  They are funny and romantic...,1226620800,7,248,4.0

2772306,1,B000NNUX10,"The movies might have been good, if they were actually in the case! Only In Good Company was there. I received a dvd of The West Wing...The Complete First Season,  not Head Over Heals or The Perfect Man. Obviously there's a problem here.  In Good Company was fun though.",1396828800,,270,4.489795918367347
2772307,4,B000NNUX10,Very good action movies it kept u on the edge of your seat & the action was non-stop & very good story line,1396742400,,107,3.6956521739130435
2772308,5,B000NNUX10,Head Over Heels is a great little comedy with Freddie Prinze Jr. that is worth the price of admission alone. Have not watched the other two titles yet but the cast on both is great and should be just as good as H O H.,1394236800,,217,3.8444444444444446
2772309,5,B000NNUX10,We love watching these movies at home.  They never get old and I can't wait to watch them over and over again.,1355875200,,110,4.0
2772310,4,B000NNUX10,"These are ""Chic Flicks"", but ""Head Over Heels"" won't bore most men and Freddie Prinz is always cool, even for an old lady like me.  ""The Perfect Man"" is a sweet movie, and ""In Good Company"" will also leave you feeling happy.",1335830400,,224,4.333333333333333
2772311,5,B000NNUX10,I enjoyed all three of these Romantic-comedy movies. Hilary Duff plays matchmaker in the perfect man to cheer up her mom but things get mixed up etc. Freddy Prince Jr. is great in Head over heels even though he gets accused of some strange things in this romantic comedy. In Good company was interesting with Dennis Quaid as the over protective father/boss of a guy who falls for his daughter etc.,1314921600,2,397,4.605633802816901
2772312,4,B000NNUX10,"I had never seen any of these movies before, so I bought this Triple Feature on a whim. It was inexpensive (less than if I had rented them, for sure) and delivered free and fast via Amazon Prime. ""The Perfect Man"" was cute. ""Head Over Heels"" was hilarious -- silly romantic comedy in all the right ways. By far my favorite movie of the three. ""In Good Company"" was okay... doubt I'd watch it again, but it wasted a couple of hours and put me right to sleep. The subtitles worked well and were easy to read. Not the greatest collection of movies, but well worth the price here. I will definitely watch ""Head Over Heels"" again, so the collection was worth the price for that movie alone.",1313971200,2,685,4.359375
2772313,5,B000NNUX10,"I loved all three movies , my favorite was

The perfect Man :
Daughter tries to find her mom the perfect husband ..

Head over Heels:  This movie was a laughable change, yet still a love story . plus 4 dizty
fashion models looking for a roommate to pay their rent get involved with hilarious results ..

In Good Company : was a good movie too, Father loses promotion to younger man who becomes his
new boss , who falls in love with his daughter .. laughable and funny as you watch good popcorn
evening ...",1292976000,2,505,4.229166666666667
2772314,4,B000NNUX10,"Ok first the idea of 3 movies for a not so expensive price is a good idea, too bad all three weren't good though.  The Perfect Man was really funny and good, Head Over Heals was pretty good also, not great but I did enjoy it.  However, In Good Company, really really bad.  Very boring, bad acting, no substance.  I turned it off, feeling a bit disapointed in my overall purchase.  You know a great bargin, 3 movies for a reasonable price.  Oh well 2 out of 3 aint bad.  So I gave this package 4 stars simply because the first movie was so good and the second pretty good also.",1262822400,11,576,4.135135135135135
