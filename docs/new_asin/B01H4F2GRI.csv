8764732,5,B01H4F2GRI,"Any movie with Joseph Fiennes, seems to me, is a work of a Master in the Art of Movie Making!!  He didn't fail in his rendition of a non-believer! I wished the scene in which Judas Iscariot would have included in the movie! It would have shown the other side of an non-believer, which is death by one's own action!! Never the less this picture is a powerful rendition with a message!!
The audio and video is excellent!! Thank you for listing this inspiring movie with AMAZON!!!",1487721600,,477,4.482758620689655
