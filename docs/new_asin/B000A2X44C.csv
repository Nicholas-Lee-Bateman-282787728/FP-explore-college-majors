8073502,1,B000A2X44C,"The year 2002 was an odd time in the year of Sid's movie choices. In addition to the regular b horror/action/comedy we'd always watched we also attempted to broaden our horizons. As we walked through the local video store we began to notice a trend of rappers taking a stab at the acting scene. Upon an intense discussion while we placed ""I'm Over Here Now"" in the guaranteed to be here slot it was decided we'd give the genre a shot. Big mistake! Even for the ultimate b enthusiasts these films are just too bad to enjoy. Of course there's a few laughs when you have Gary Busey teamed up with Ice-T, but that's not nearly enough to get the job done.

Dakota Smith (Fred Williamson/Shaft) is an ex-cop/private eye who is very involved in the community. He comes out of retirement vigilante style when a young local kid gets mixed up with the original gangsta Slim Jim (Ice-T). Awesome! Yes Slim Jim is his name in the movie. The kid owes Slim Jim money but can't pay up. So naturally in this situation the only thing you can do is hire hit-man Gary Busey to throw some cement boots on the young charlie and finish him off. Busey's name is Felix, yeah great name for a hit-man, and he is utterly hilarious. As the plot jumps all over in a confusing fashion we finally come to the point where Shaft and a couple buddies take on T & Busey. It's the ultimate b fight to reclaim the streets in which they do.

As you can tell by the rating this one was really awful. In fact the 1 star is a combined effort of Ice-T and Busey as they dulled out horrific/hilarious acting. You can tell this is the point where Busey stepped foot on the crazy train and has never looked back. His best acting after this was when he played a killer bakery item in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Gingerdead-Man/dp/B000BITVH4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Gingerdead Man</a>&nbsp;and his appearances on Celebrity Fit Camp/Celebrity Rehab .  The reason for the review 7 years later is that Sid caught this one on tv late last night and was inspired to finally review the disaster. Especially when we realized Ice-T's name was one of Santa's favorite snacks. We will not recommend this film since it is NOT one we would have liked in the glory days.",1244592000,,2269,4.681704260651629
