8731748,5,B014SPIE64,Fantastic DVD and CD as well.  Creative and brilliant in execution.  Also great to see the interviews with Alan Moore in the bonus section.  Having the scripts for each scene also shows the creative process and how script is translated into cinema.,1487116800,,248,4.857142857142857
