1848202,5,B00008J2GQ,"Six good songs by Roy Rogers, Gabby Hayes, and the Sons of the Pioneers with Pat Brady. One of Roy Rogers best because of some priceless songs.

The song, ""Mavoureen O'Shea"", with, surprise, Gabby Hayes in the lead with a great Irish accent; a song of subtle humor. (I bet this song took more than one take, because Gabby's Irish accent is so convincing, it must have made the other guys laugh.)(A rare glimpse of Roy at the start of this song, breaking character, having a good time).

""Mary Smith is my Irish rose, how much I love her? there's nobody knows. She's happy I know cause she told me today; she'll be changing her name to Mavoureen O'Shea. Ohhhhhh Mavoureen O'Shea, her name sounds better that way. McCarthy is fine and Smith is Ok, but none half so fine as... Mavoureen O'Shea!""

The song, ""No Good Son of Gun"" is made great by Pat Brady (Take a look at one of the band to Pat's right, breaking character, enjoying Pat's humor). These guys were all great friends in real life. This unique script and these unique songs allow their off-screen, friendship to shine through. They are having a lot of fun. They can't make them like this anymore.

""The Sandman Lullaby"" is very relaxing with a little yodeling, a true lullaby.

You are better off purchasing the ""Happy Trails Theatre"" version at Roy Rogers Dott Comm, which has an added opening and closing, hosted by Roy and Dale years later; they show a home-movie.

The bad guys try to swindle a ranch from the heir. Plenty of action and a little humor. The story is fine and lively. This film is exceptional because of the exceptional songs and some unique opportunities for Roy and the boys' real life fun to shine. (1942).

A rider approaches the Bagley Ranch. There is a new owner of this ranch. The hired hands are let go, the other ranchers don't need help. One man has a plan to buy this land cheap by cutting off the water to its stream. Cowboys sing about their condition. Who is working cattle at night? A woman tries to get milk to feed a child. She asks Gabby to rope a cow, the others help. This baby is the heir to the ranch! Roy and his friends arrive. Rodney Blackton is introduced to the housekeeper. Dinner is served. Jackson has a note for a $5,000 loan from Bagley. Roy and his friends volunteer to help. Where are the cattle? They find the cattle but are fired upon! Falling rocks stampede the herd, the crook ride off. That note was forged! The newspaper says the Army wants 500 head of cattle. That could settle the debt.

Roy and his friends go to town. There is a fight in the tavern. Then a song. Mr. Sheldon, the agent, buys the Bagley ranch cattle. There is a song, people dance. But cattle thieves steal the herd! Roy and his friends pursue the thieves. Isnt it funny how that stream dried up? They learn of the treachery and take action. Gabby calls the Sheriff. Roy and his friends ride to the canyon to save Sheldon, Miss Clark arrived first. But she is captured by Jacksons men. Sheldon found the dam! Roys men show up for a gunfight. Jackson orders the dam destroyed (this will flood the canyon) Can Roy save Sheldon from the flood? Yes, with the help of a friend. The Sherif found the truck with stolen cattle, Sheldons cattle will be shipped east.

This is an interesting drama about saving a ranch from fraud. Using a baby as the owner is a change from other stories. Could a forged note be valid without a notary publics stamp?",1468195200,,1766,4.361702127659575
