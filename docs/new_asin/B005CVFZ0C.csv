4654775,1,B005CVFZ0C,"SCARLETT FRY'S JUNKFOOD HORRORFEST, (SFJFHF) seems DEFINITELY NOT a movie to see on a full stomach -- or an empty one.  SFJFHF seems definitely NOT a movie to see before, or after, going grocery shopping -- or before, or after, eating at ANY fast-food restaurant.  Or any other restaurant.  Or eating dinner at home...OR at relative's or friend's homes.
SFJFHF seems NOT a good movie to see before going on a diet.  SFJFHF seems NOT a good movie to see before or after visiting the local farmer's market.  SFJFHF seems NOT a good movie to see before, (or after), going to your local ""AA"" meeting....whether the ""AA"" stands for ""Alcholics Anonymous"" or ""Anorexics Anonymous.""  SFJFHF seems NOT a good movie to see before or after Lent, before or after Passover, before or after Ramdan, and ESPECIALLY not before or after Yom Kippur!

In fact, there seems absolutely NO good time to see this total-waste-of-time movie.  Ever. (Go to sleep, try to figure ut lottery odds, or joyously fill out this year's income tax forms, instead.... : )",1308787200,,1035,4.807909604519774
4654776,4,B005CVFZ0C,"This is a good low budget movie but the box that it comes with is a plain white box with no artwork!! None of this is explained in the listing, this dvd looks like a cheap knock-off so if your expecting to get the version with full color artwork, be aware its not!!!! You get a cheap disc with a box that has a plain white piece of paper inserted in the cover for artwork.",1279670400,,372,3.973333333333333
8465930,1,B005CVFZ0C,"The DVD is divided into three parts. The one that says, ""Play Movie"" consists of an hour of short features which involve killing somebody and on occasion eating them. The second feature consists of more of the same low budget stuff. The third feature is the old black and white film, ""Carnival of Souls"" being witlessly hosted by Scarlet Fry (a guy). A more fitting title would be ""Abandoned Amusement Park of Souls"" but who would pay to see that...other than me.

If you just want to watch cheap effect idiotic killings with no plot, this is it.

Guide: F-bomb. No real sex or nudity. One scene with a quick grope and flash of side breast meat.

8465931,4,B005CVFZ0C,"I'm always on the lookout for new blood...heh heh...in horror films.  This was a great horrorfest, wonderful variety, lots of campy gore.  Seriously, whatever horror monster/theme you're into, at LEAST one of these stories will likely cover it.",1370390400,,244,5.394736842105263
8465932,4,B005CVFZ0C,"You get so many great tales of gore & horror in this total package of greatness.  I'm so glad I got this one, we had SO much fun with it!!  You get lots of blood, gore, violence...pretty much everything you could ask for.  It's great because just when you're sad that one is ending, there's another one to watch!",1368316800,,312,4.254237288135593
8465933,4,B005CVFZ0C,"Scarlet Fry is back, this time as a backwoods corpse. (An inspired choice!) With his signature style of macabre humor, he seamlessly weaves another series of twisted tales together. This time, monsters are abandoned in favor of psychopaths, who each deliver a more twisted demise on their unsuspecting victims than the next! This gem of low/no-budget guerrilla-style filmmaking will definitely leave you a little worse for wear, but what good junk food doesn't?",1344384000,,461,5.328767123287672
8465934,3,B005CVFZ0C,This movie was alot of fun. I am a big fan of lowbudget horror anthologies and if you like those as well you will love this. I especially loved the segment with Calico Cooper! :) i'm a big alice cooper fan,1335225600,,205,4.024390243902439

This Anthology kicks off with a reference of drugs being swapped for a VHS MOVIE,Really ?

Tried to keep the segments separated by titles,But,As you'll read,Why ?

1) Blood Thirsty Butcher-Forgettable and really in poor taste(pun),Ours not theirs.

2) Solution-A Park,B/W filming(why), Invalid with an odd nurse,There appears a sniper that shoots invalid in a wheel chair,Mind You,And then runs off with nurse...

3) Griptape Spank  Googled this:gripe tape is used on skating boards and the `Act' of spanking the victim in this segment)-A PLOT,What half way thru the film and this segment has charcaters developing and coming to conclusions. Skaters want dope and have to turn a S/M trick on a dude to get cash...Spanking his bare behind with their skateboards  Lie a prinicipals paddle `Old Skool').Hey Scarlet,Umm Walter -Whats with all the exposed logos on shirts and cigs ?

Let us  examine some issues,This may have been made in 2007-Self Endulgent-No pay-off in most segments,Lets have a punchline in a freakin' moment.

4) Devil Made Me Do It- Satanic Guy of course wearing a white wife beater gets shot by his abused woman--Then a non-ending he comes back.

So,SFJFHF is about to end and then--

5) Love Is Blind-This has babymaking,s/m,and revenge for misguided love. MADE US WAIT for this,Thanks loads. This is a great little scene or two and completes a journey to viewing an horror pic.",1318982400,,1437,5.0423728813559325
8465936,3,B005CVFZ0C,"Scarlet Fry's Junkfood Horrorfest. Wow. Where do I start? There are so many facets to this myriad of horror shorts that it's tough to review it all in one big lump. So, like Walter Reuther's other film ""Nightmare Alley"", I'll approach this with as much finesse and strain as it takes to actually watch a ten minute long no-budget horror short. Essentially, that's what Reuther's films are: collections of [horror] stories told back to back with no connection to one another, hosted by Fry under the guise of a spooky costume, and all on the budget of the average Joe. In this particular feature, he appears as a rotting, overalls-wearing hillbilly...definitely one of his more convincing costumes.

You can't expect much from Junkfood; from the story of an obese lardo that eats his neighbor instead of just going to the grocery store, to the homosexual in short shorts that gets beat down with a skateboard full of nails, it's one facile tale after another. So if you're looking to go swimming in awesomeness, Junkfood Horrorfest isn't for you. If you just want to go wading in a no-budget bloodbath made by someone who shares your passion for gore, then put on your trunks and come on in, because the water's warm and red.

I enthusiastically give this film somewhere between two and three stars for some groovy splatter, a bit of zealous devotion from a fellow horror lover (Director Walter Reuther), and half a breast.",1314576000,3,1422,4.8
8465937,4,B005CVFZ0C,"Scarlet Fry's ""Junkfood Horrorfest"" is a gross, funny, and fun flick that all horror aficionados should check out. An anthology of several horror stories, this harkens back to some of the 80's anthology movies/ shows such as ""Creepshow"" and ""Tales From the Crypt"". Worth noting: Alice Cooper's daughter, Calico Cooper, stars in this!!!",1314489600,,335,5.339622641509434
8465938,4,B005CVFZ0C,"The hard working horror master, Scarlet Fry, really over-performs in serving up a whole smorgasboard of cheesy gory mini-tales of demented people who have a lot of cracks in their their psyche. Calico Cooper stars in her first movie as an alley cat druggie and when she doesn't get the crack she wants, the dealer gets whacked! Love the John Waters twist of performers in these many tales of warped madness and gore. A lot of sick stories combined in a juicy and long winded compilation that is definitely worth the money...Scarlet Fry, our horror host, is a multi-faceted actor/writer and horror afficionado who makes you cringe as the insanity beneath us all is revealed in flawed and fragmented tales of killers and victims on the edge. Often hilariously funny and full of fascinating sickos! YOU GOTTA SEE SCARLET FRY in ""GLITTER GODDESS: QUEEN OF THE SUNSET STRIP""...he plays a heroin addict and he makes the mother of ""THE GLITTER GODDESS"" sick to death cuz he is such a loser drug fiend!!! ""GLITTER GODDESS: QUEEN OF THE SUNSET STRIP"" will be available May 22, 2012!",1314489600,,1073,4.805405405405406
8465939,4,B005CVFZ0C,"As far as anthologies go, Junkfood Horrorfest is sophomore effort that has some teeth. It is uneven, yes, but leans more toward the classic Tales from the Crypt than newer schlock like Dr. Terror. I think Chemical Burn has the right formula here: some homemade grue, lots of campy fun and, most importantly, a good time. You can actually tell that these performers and the filmmakers are enjoying what they do. It translates on screen. Not a bad little film.",1314403200,,458,4.7375
