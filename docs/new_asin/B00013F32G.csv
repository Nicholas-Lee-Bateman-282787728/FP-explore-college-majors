1968720,5,B00013F32G,"H.R. Pufnstuf may have lasted only 17 episodes, it may have come from the late 60's, and there may be a dozen other things that could be considered negative flaws about this show, but they only add to the infectious charm of this wonderfully orchaestrated live action cartoon.
I bought the complete DVD boxset for my fiancee's birthday recently, because I knew it would be something she would simply love and treasure for years to come.  Some may think that the Kroft brothers did drugs in order to create the many zany and trippy programs they created over the years, but trust me, they didn't.
Are there druglike innuendoes and double-entendres placed visually and in the dialogue?  well, that's really up to personal opinions and interpretations.  But I digress.
This show is definitely worth owning, the dialogue can be a bit cringe-inducing at times but not overtly so, the puns and jokes can go from hilarious to Fozzie-like unBearability within the same episode, but everything is simply top=notch.
Jack Wild is awesome as Jimmy, he brings youthful energy and enthusiasm and seems to be enjoying himself wholeheartedly throughout the series.  He is very convincing in his determination to get home or to rescue Freddy Flute from the witch, showcasing a great deal of courage and loyalty to his friends, Freddy, Puf, Dr. Blinky, etc.
Billie Hayes is simply excellent as Witchiepoo, she combines a playful lunacy with a menacing ruthlessness, wrapped up with perfect comedic timing, you can't help but laugh and love the ol' hag.
The costumes are simply marvelous, not just for Pufnstuff, but for everyone: Dr. Blinky, the Evil Trees (specially imported from Transylvania), Orson the Vulture, Seymour Spider, Cling & Clang (perfect examples of Keystone Cops), Judy Frog, etc.
There are even some very interesting moments within each episode.  The show itself can be described as a 'Wizard of Oz' meets 'Puf the Magic Dragon', nowhere is this more evident than in the opening episode.  Especially with a Magic Path looking very much like a Yellow Brick Road.  Even Judy Frog is dressed and talks like Judy Garland (somewhat).
There is even an episode where a bunch of ants are holding up signs of protest with chants of 'Make Candy, Not War', this scene being somewhat reflective of the protests to the Vietnam war perhaps.
Jimmy does 'The Robot' long before it became a dance craze in 'Mechanical Boy', and in one episode a new dance is introduced called 'The Moonwalk' long before Michael Jackson would use the name for his own trademarked dance.
This is the perfect sort of show that can help lift your spirits when you're feeling down.  Despite all of the bright and psychedelic colors utilized for this show, it certainly isn't candy-coated or in any ways babyish.
Let's hope more of the Krofft creations make it to DVD!",1086134400,35,2829,4.916142557651992
1968721,5,B00013F32G,"I am 18 years old and wasn't lucky enough to see this when it first came out. My father told me about this show when I was growing up. He used  to tell me a lot about his life as a kid, which kept me interested. Of course, Pufnstuff was his fave memory.
  After my junior prom which just past, I came home and flipped on TV Land. The show my dad told me about was on TV, a first to both me and my dad, who hasn't seen the show in over 30 years.
  The colorful cast of charactors and the sneezing house made me and my dad giggle. The magic flute was rather creepy, but all in all good clean fun . This show was a far cry from the stuff I grew up on * Strawberry Shortcake, Smurfs, etc* but still has become part of my *Most Interesting Oddities* list. In the last few years, I have never seen my dad so happy. He told me afterward that the trip down memory lane was the best. This DVD set is now his father's day gift.

God, how time flys!  I feel like such a geezer!! Did you see the interview with Jimmy who was 16 when the show was filmed and just a couple years older than me at the time? Well, it didn't do much for my self confidence.  These shows are just as funny as I remember.  Real fake and cheesey but it is supposed to be a fantasy world totally detached from reality.  420 all the way!!!!

I sincerely hope that this is just the first of many more Kroft series box sets.  I will absolutely jump all over a box set of the original 1970's Land of the Lost.

1968724,3,B00013F32G,"H.R. Pufnstuf is the precursor to PeeWee's Playhouse, Zoobolie Zoo, Spongebob Squarepants, and basically every kids' show that looks like the writers used chemical sources of inspiration. If you enjoy the any of the shows I just mentioned, Pufnstuf sounds cool but really isn't all it's cracked up to be. Once you get past the bizarre and colorful imagery of the show, the series itself is pretty boring, with none of the wit that the shows it later influenced added. In other words, one or two episodes is really enough; after that you'll understand why parents never watched this show with their kids.
Of course, if you grew up watching the show, it has an entirely different meaning to you. But if you're just interested in cult TV, keep watching PeeWee and Spongebob and know that you're not missing anything.",1077062400,6,813,4.814285714285714

1968726,5,B00013F32G,"Living Saturday Morning again! This is a very creative story long before Pee Wee Herman and his lively playhouse. Back in the day, it was easy for kids to take this for granted since it was broadcast during the Saturday Morning cartoon time events weekly among some very competitive kids entertainment such as Hanna Barbera cartoon festivals, Star Trek reruns, American Bandstand, & Soul Train. Now that I see this series afar from all that competition I realize now just how good this series was and how incredibly creative the producers and set makers were to bring this story to life. This also includes the great help of some talented artists and performers such as Jack Wild believable as the kid in a strange new world, and the wonderful Billie Hayes as the evil bumbling cantankerous witch. I just wish they would have included the motion picture as bonus like they did with The Munsters full episode edition that included a special disc containing both movies, it would have made the collection complete.",1488067200,,1012,4.855491329479769

1968728,5,B00013F32G,"The first three of my parents ten children were all born in February - I came first, then two sisters, one of whom I shared a room with for 16 years.  As adults, we've enjoyed a ""February birthdays breakfast"" with our parents, which is always a fun time to reminisce - especially since that particular sister and I are now both grandmas!  Came away from that breakfast this year with some gift ideas for her actual birthday this Saturday, and found this DVD - H.R. Pufnstuf was her absolute must-watch Saturday morning cartoon show, she had a major crush on Jimmy (well, as much of a crush as a 6 year old can have on an 11-12 year old ""older man""), and how perfect that all 17 episodes that originally ran in the fall of 1969 are all here on one DVD!  She's now retired and babysitting her first granddaughter, so not only can I not wait to see her huge grin when she opens it, but it'll also be interesting to see what her little lady thinks of her grandma's old favorite!

Sibling puppeteer team Sid and Marty Krofft's first live-action TV series using life-sized puppets, you're sure to remember - if you're of the same generation as my sister and I - the boy named Jimmy and his magical talking flute (Freddy), who was lured onto a mysterious talking boat (which, as it turns out, was owned by an evil witch, Witchiepoo.)  Under Witchiepoo's control, the boat shipwrecks onto Living Island (where EVERYTHING is alive), the location of her castle (with a living door and pillars), where she plans to take him prisoner and steal his flute.  However, friendly dragon H.R. Pufnstuf (mayor of the island) discovers the plot and - with the help of Cling and Clang (short red and green furry 3-toed and deaf cavemen with faces resembling birds who're part of H.R.'s Rescue Racer Crew) - rescues Jimmy when he jumps from the boat and swims ashore, whisking him off to the only place on the island where Witchiepoo's magic is ineffective, H.R.'s cave.

Gosh - do you remember Witchiepoo's henchmen (Orson the vulture, Seymour the spider, Stupid the bat, and the skeleton guards), and the talking mushrooms who lived on her side of the island?  How about Dr. Blinky the owl doctor/scientist and his sneezing house with its talking fireplace, test tube, candle, human skull, and books, or the walking/talking ""Good Trees"" (Hippie, Madame Willow, Chief Redwood, etc.) and ""Evil Trees"" (#1, #2 & #3)?  Not to mention H.R.'s sister Shirley the actress (based on Shirley Temple), film director Max Von Toadenoff the Great (a toad), Judy the singing/dancing frog (based on Judy Garland), peddler Ludicrous Lion and his polka-dotted horse, living lollipop Pop Lolly and her cheese guards (along with the hippie ants who wanted free candy), Tick Tock the alarm clock, Grandmother & Grandfather clock, Miss Wristwatch, Lady Boyd and The Boyds (a band of singing birds), and the family of crabs.  Oh - and how could I forget - The Winds (North/South/East/West), who would help H.R. blow Witchipoo out of the sky!

In 1969 my sister and I were innocents, oblivious to any winking going on among adults with this cartoon's purported veiled references to pot smoking (as was the case with Peter, Paul & Mary's ""Puff, the Magic Dragon""), given the title of the character and the line in the theme song, ""Can't do a little 'cause he can't do enough"" - in both cases, those references have been denied.  Regardless of whether or not there was any truth to them, H.R. Pufnstuf is a true cult classic when it comes to cartoons, and this DVD also includes downloadable vintage music as well as a coloring book, and a ""never-before released episode of Horror Hotel from the Krofft Superstar Hour"" featuring Pufnstuf characters.",1487721600,4,3702,4.740279937791602

Sure the costumes and sets look like the producers were tripping high, but Its a great Childrens show. when I found out the dvd price for Pufnstuf dropped because of another rerelease of dvds I ordered the Rhino version right away

I am truly glad that I watched Hr Pufnstuf, its one of those shows that will always have a special place in my heart. And my friends watched it too

1968784,5,B00013F32G,"I've been wandering down memory lane after giving my young nephews a DVD set of the complete series H.R. Pufnstuf.  (""The adventures of a boy trapped in a fantastic land with a dragon friend and a witch enemy."")  This Saturday-morning series was a huge part of my childhood; I had many fond memories of it, but hadn't seen it for nearly 40 years.

So I thought, what the heck---I went ahead and viewed the discs before giving them as a Christmas gift.  And I was surprised at just how well I remembered the show!  It all seemed very familiar, despite the many years that had passed since I watched it.  A handful of episodes contained musical interludes, and I remembered every single song after hearing just a few notes.

I was also surprised to find that there were only 17 episodes ever produced.  It was shot in 1969, and the network just kept repeating these same episodes over and over---it was on television constantly for about five years.  The producers definitely wanted to shoot more episodes for additional seasons, but the network was cheap and figured that kids would keep on watching the same ones.  It's a shame, because storywise I think a lot more could have been done with the basic premise.

However, the following year the producers (the Krofft brothers) did at least shoot a feature-length film version of the show before the cast was let go and all the sets and costumes put into storage.  I'll have to talk more about the film later...

So, how does this series hold up as an adult?  Hmmmm....  It definitely has the sheen of nostalgia for me, though watching it now I have to wince a bit about how LOUD and over-the-top it is.  And all the very silly slapstick doesn't do much for me; this was intended for a young audience, to be sure.  So what's in it for an adult?  Well, all the drug references---ha!  Man, talk about psychedelic; you have to assume that everyone involved with this show knew their way around a bong (and more).

What I got a kick out of, however, was the fact that all of the costumed characters speak in voices based on classic Hollywood actors.  So, it's fun trying to figure out just who everyone is supposed to be.  (For instance, the talking skull is Boris Karloff, Judy the frog is Judy Garland, etc., etc....)

Due to the fact that yes, to my aged ears and eyes a fair amount of the show now is slightly annoying, I'm not sure it is something I'd watch over and over, but I would get a kick out of viewing little bits and pieces every now and again...

Oh, in conclusion I'll add that one of the chief pleasures of H.R. Pufnstuf for me was Billie Hayes' over-the-top performance as Witchiepoo.  Okay, I'm contradicting myself---I've only now just said that I didn't care for the much-too-loud, much-too-broadly-played antics in this show!  But for some reason I feel a great fondness for that character and the actress who played her.  She isn't so much a witch as a clown in witch make-up; very silly, not scary.

It's good to know that Billie Hayes, at 82 years of age, is still around.  I viewed a few fairly recent videos of her on YouTube---she seems so nice!",1422144000,4,3118,4.517857142857143

1968877,5,B00013F32G,"I watched the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saturday-Morning-With-Sid-Marty-Krofft/dp/B0009YA42G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saturday Morning With Sid & Marty Krofft</a>&nbsp;DVD recently, which had all of the pilot episodes of the various Sid & Marty Kroft shows. A child of the `70s, I grew up on all of these shows, and I was surprised at how crystal clear they were in my memory more than thirty years after I had originally seen them.

I got this ""H.R. Pufnstuf - The Complete Series"" boxset, and have had a great time re-watching all of the episodes. This set has all seventeen episodes released of ""H.R. Pufnstuf."" The episodes are bright and clear, and unlike the ""Saturday Morning"" DVD they seem to have gone through a solid restoration.

The shows are as good as I remember. The brothers Sid and Marty were master puppet makers and imaginative storytellers, who kept it going episode after episode with bizarre, colorful fantasy.  Jack Wild and Billie Hayes do a tremendous job keeping the scenes alive as the human characters in a puppet kingdom.  One detail I did forget--the terrible mushrooms!  I have a lifelong mushroom phobia, and I remembered instantly how scared I was of the mushrooms in ""H.R. Pufnstuf."" Sid and Marty Kroft, you have scarred me for life!

There are two releases of the complete ""H.R. Pufnstuf;"" this out-of-print boxset from Rhino and the reissued&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/H-R-Pufnstuf-The-Complete-Series/dp/B00465I17Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">H.R. Pufnstuf: The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;by Vivendi Entertainment.  Neither of them is a perfect collection, as both have special features not available on the other.  The Vivendi set has the segment of the Kroft Halloween special ""Horror Hotel"" staring the ""Pufnstuf"" cast, while the Rhino set has a slew of interviews with the cast.

Personally, I like the Rhino set better and think it is worth tracking down. I loved the interviews almost as much as I loved the series.  They are nice long interviews, not little sound bites, and I learned a lot about the series and its creators.  I didn't know that Jack Wild was the Artful Dodger from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Oliver/dp/B001IWUZYK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Oliver!</a>&nbsp;(another film I love). And I didn't know that the Kroft brothers were behind the Puppet Theater at Magic Mountain amusement park in California.  I grew up in California, and I LOVED going to the Puppet Theater.  I had no idea I was seeing the Kroft brothers at work.  That was a great detail to my childhood memories that I got from this boxset.",1347580800,3,2709,5.74

I can't speak to this set from a superfan perspective in breaking down what tiny parts may be missing or incomplete.  As far as I can tell it is all of the television series episodes and we love it.  I think it is cool that my 5 year old is into it too.  Maybe some developer should do a remake or something using today's technology .... now that could be really cool.  5 Stars on this set.",1328745600,2,1091,4.075117370892019
1968890,5,B00013F32G,"They just don't make shows like this anymore, and maybe kids today won't understand or appreciate the incredible amount of effort, work and creativity that went into staging such an elaborate, original, fantasy world, but it's up to parents of our generation to expose them to it again I suppose (those from the 40+ crowd now).

HR Pufnstuf actually somewhat pre-dates my childhood, even though I was born in 1969, as I was just a bit too young to recall it as much as I did, say, Land Of The Lost or the Super Friends and other mid-70's Saturday morning cartoons, but as an adult revisiting this crazy Sid & Marty Kroft series, I can still, now, have flashbacks of the the Vulture and other characters, and I can completely appreciate the sets, props, costumes and acting the cast pulled-off...how much fun they must've had doing this.

You can also see how McDonald's completely ripped-off the characters and environments from this show in the 70's, that lingered on for a long time, in order to target children with their junk food.  There are various commercials on YouTube, for instance, that drive this home from the 70's, and I always wondered where in the world McDonald's got their crazy characters and ideas from...God forbid they come-up with something original.

In any case, you have to wonder what sort of psychedelics Marty & Sid were either on or had done, although it is all completely innocent, despite some of the mild ethnic/racial stereotyping that was typical of that era, that seemed out of place (the Indian and African American trees etc..., which didn't really bother me at all, it was an attempt at being inclusive) and the incredible acting job by Billie Hayes as Witchiepoo, reminiscent of the Wizard Of Oz, she plays that role of the Wicked Witch to a tee.

I am still blown-away today by the ability to create such a creative fantasy world with nothing but hand puppets and elaborate sets, costumes, and actors.  It is brilliant, full of 60's Vietnam war era subject matter (characters in hippie costumes protesting dentists and demanding candy, but not wanting to ""work"" for it - which is ridiculously stereotypical from a lame authoritarian viewpoint, and it makes it that much more funny and silly), but relating to children, and brings back a lot of memories from a time when things were done without any digital assistance at all, outside of green screens.

It has better pacing and much more visual stimulation than Land Of The Lost, with each episode lasting approximately 22 minutes.  Adults can appreciate the art direction, stage design, and the incredible costumes, while kids under 8 will be enamored with the stories, characters and relate to the story of an alienated boy finding fun, good-hearted friends in a fantasy world he or she might dream of being in, while going to sleep at night.

It's great to see this on DVD (and on various streaming services including Amazon) now.  The price is perfect and I love putting these shows in the Blu-ray player or firing them up on streaming just to put me in a better, more relaxed mood when the stress and negative nature of the world is weighing on me.",1326412800,7,3144,4.762867647058823

To be able to lay there watching this with the kids was truly wonderful - to enjoy this simple yet fun movie, with no hint of bad language, mobile phones, computers etc was an experience I will cherish.

Well, the package made it to my house but the cheap thin plastic was busted on both sides and the cardboard was crushed too. I'm getting a refund on this product and I get to keep the busted set. But just let me express my frustration. The packaging is CHEAP. The cardboard use for the case and the packaging is about half the thickness of your usual dvd set. And the plastic is pretty thin as well. So this is one of the reasons the set arrived completely busted all to heck. And you should see how gawdy and LOUD the packaging is. There are freaking silly pictures all over the packaging. In short, IT'S UGLY. There are simply too many stupid pictures all over the packaging. The dvds will fit securely in the plastic though. The dvds will not fall out but the product is simply UGLY. Whoever devised this packaging just went CRAZY with pictures. This is easily the UGLIEST dvd set I have ever purchased. I can appreciate the use of the pictures it's just that the packaging is VERY BUSY. It is OVERLOADED with pictures. It is ridiculously overloaded with pictures. It just looks absurd and stupid. So, for me I felt ridiculous just playing with the package. The creators of this reissue should have used sturdy cardboard/paper, thicker plastic and they should have TONED down the images. This set has IMAGE OVERLOAD making it look retarded.

This review is just for the packaging. The dvds seem to be of the usual quality. It is three dvds which are not thin or cheap. So the dvds are better than the packaging.

The rest of the 17 episodes were fantastic, although there is one episode in particular (I forget which one) on disc 2 with really bad video and soundtrack quality.  The rest of the episodes are high quality and entertaining, and looked and sounded better than I ever saw it as a kid.

We do have to be careful if our two year old daughter sees this and constantly remind her that hitting is bad.  There is quite alot of hitting and slapstick involved, especially from Witchiepoo towards her pet bird, Seymour the Spider, and Stupid Bat.

The extra interviews were interesting although I was a little dissappointed in the fact that Marty Krofft was so belittling and condenscending to his younger brother Sid.  Sid seemed to be the fun and creative one, whereas Marty was the older and more serious one.  But Marty wasn't very nice to Sid, and that put a damper on my enthusiasm for their work.

I remember that episode being acted out and the boat speaking to Jimmy to get in the boat etc. Also I remember one plot, maybe it's in that first episode, where the witch sees pictures Jimmy has in his wallet and thinks his family is wealthy. So she grows a beanstalk to climb into his world and get money from them. Jimmy and the gang chop it down right before she reaches the top & Jimmy felt bad he couldn't use the beanstalk to get home but at least he stopped the witch. That show is not in this ""complete"" set as far as I've seen scanning through episodes.

Also, I swear there was a second season because when I watched the show as a kid and they kept repeating shows, I recalled then how much older Jimmy looked in later episodes, plus his hair style was slightly different in the second season. I noticed the difference when the rotation of shows went from last episode to him jumping on that boat when it was repeated on television. In this collection Jimmy looks about the same age on episode 17 as he did on the first one. I swear this show had a second season of at least a few episodes. Episode Websites say there were only 17 episodes. But I remember distinctly how in the later shows Jimmy looked much older from the beginning song recap.

Does anyone else remember a second season and the first episode summary being a complete episode and the witch climbing up beanstalk to blackmail Jimmy's wealthy family?

If this box set were described as a first season I'd give it 5 stars for the quality of transfer and comentary on ""first"" episode in this collection. The individual interviews were bland. I would have preferred a documentary of the show incorporating clips and interviews and backstory. The individual interviews shown straight through felt like a bare minimum of effort for extras.

Remember that this show is pure whimsy, many would not be completely wrong to say total garbage, but those were the times that were the sixties, and we all know the kind of products that time period produced. This show is a staunch reminder of just how bad TV was at times!

I must admit though, it was fascinating to take this trip down memory lane and at the same time realise the kind of utter nonsense that we used to watch and enjoy as children. However, at least it falls short of the kind of nutty political correctness that is seen in kid's shows these days.

The movie is out on VHS, but it really should have been included on this collection.  I remember really liking it as a kid, and would love to see it again.  In the movie the boys outfit is completely different he had a orange shirt, a brown vest with fringes - I had one just like it, he also had matching pants and really cool fringed boots, and an awesome belt that I couldn't find anywhere when I was 7 years old.",1114819200,,582,4.034782608695652
1968982,2,B00013F32G,"Unless you are too young to remember, TV shows in the 80's, 70's, 60's, and 50's were NOT 21 minutes long!  They ranged anywhere from 23 minutes in the early 80's to 25+ minutes in the 50's and 60's.  These shows (clocking in at just over 21 minutes are *obviously* a surreptitious packaging of the syndicated series as re-released by Nick At Night.  Beware.  They did this with Alf and without ANY warning about it.  I don't know what's missing from these shows: it's been too long. But Alf lost some of its funniest lines thanks to the re-editing.  Very sad. :(",1107561600,17,563,4.470588235294118

1968984,4,B00013F32G,"I think the first thing that fans of the H.R. Pufnstuf series might find surprising is that there were only 17 episodes produced, and one of those is what amounts to a ""clip"" show. When the series first aired, it seemed to go on forever. That was in the days of one episode a Saturday, every Saturday. Somehow, kids didn't quite catch on that it was the same eps over and over.

But the show itself was pretty revolutionary for its time. A Dragon with a heart of gold, a witch with an eye for gold and a kid with a golden flute in the middle.

But that's typical of Sid and Marty Krofft, who provided a gentle touch, a bit of slapstick, some wild sets and costumes and a stellar star in the form of Jack Wild, just off his Artful Dodger turn in the Best Picture Oscar winning ""Oliver!"" at the time.

If you're a fan of the series, you will like what you see here. As advertised, every episode is presented (though one of them is in rather washed out shape in comparison to the rest for some reason). But even more notable are the special features you get here.

It's rare to get a sit down interview with the Kroffts themselves, but you get to hear them both tell their stories about the days of their childhood careers, and what led them to create their collection of programs. THAT is worth the price of the DVD, because you get to find out a lot about the psychology of these two guys through their candid comments: Sid, who was the Vaudeville star, and Marty, who copied his world famous sibling doing his same act. The interaction between these two could be the most amusing thing in this collection and MUST NOT BE MISSED!

They also slip you a couple of episodes of an early program titled ""Irving"" about a circus lion and his adventures in and around the Big Top.

Billie Hayes, who played antagonist Witchiepoo, does a wonderful interview at a convention, with people walking by in the background of a hotel ballroom, and that in itself is amusing.

But the toughest thing for me to see was Jack Wild's interview. It's clear that the guy has been through a very tough time in his life and every last bit of it shows quite clearly in his face. He nearly looks as old as his witch counterpart! However, to his credit, he still has the youth in his eyes and is still quite expressive.

If I have any advice, I'd suggest you view all the special features before you see any of the episodes. It sets them up a bit better and give you a better sense of the people involved and the timing of everything. But it's really a great package, good for kids from the 1970s, or maybe even their kids!

Highly recommended.",1105142400,164,2615,4.331288343558282
1968985,5,B00013F32G,"I, unfortunately, did not grow up in the late 60's-early 70's. I never did get to see the show. However, if you feel a connection to that period of time (nostaligac, I assume), this is definitely for you. It's one of those feelings about that time period that you can't explain; it's emotional, and you almost feel like you lived back then. As far as the DVD, like I said earlier, if you feel a connection to that time period (whether you remember the show or not), you will love it. I'm very serious.",1104451200,2,501,4.340425531914893

The color quality and crisp picture is great, like night and day compared to TV or a previous video we have. Our daughter, now 6, still loves to watch these over and over. And on one or two DVDs, you can start it and it will play about 6 episodes on a row, without a parent having to restart it. It also does not have a bunch of commercials at the beginning.

1968989,5,B00013F32G,"HR Pufnstuf is definitely a magical story -- anyone who watched late 60s/early 70s TV will instantly recognized these characters (Puf, Dr. Blinky, Cling/Clang, the evil trees, Seymore the spider...etc.).

Even if you haven't thought about this show for years...just watching one episode will bring back memories of a very special time in children's Saturday morning TV (a time when there really WAS a fall season where new shows were launched and you could wait with anticipation for them at the end of summer).

However...I agree with the one reviewer who said that the talking flute was ""creepy"" -- he is!

Also...I must confess that I have a nagging doubt that the flute really isn't a flute at all.  Witchiepoo may very well be Jimmy's mother...the flute is not a flute...and this is all one Freudian/Oedipal nightmare.  His mom is after his flute.  He tries to get away.  Think about it.
