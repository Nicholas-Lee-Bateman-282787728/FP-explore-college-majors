8600894,4,B00E45VI1C,Quite strange for a strange opera.  Pamina and Rene Pape stole the show.  I find the first act tolerable but there is a majesty and unfortunately still kind of boring 2nd act.  very impressive head gear from the priests in 2nd act.  I've never seen a helmet on fire............,1469577600,,277,4.591836734693878
8600895,5,B00E45VI1C,"It has been suggested that the incredible success of this opera - premiered in 1791 and in the repertoire since then - is due to its sublime music and to its magic sets and staging. This production has both.
The cast is as good as you can get. Pape is an imposing Sarastro, vocally and dramatically. Gerhaher comes across perfectly as the down-to-earth and simple Papageno, the most loved character in the libretto. Damrau, as the Queen of the Night, not only sings those famous and difficult arias perfectly, but her acting is also notable and adds to the magic of the music. The whole cast and orchestra are superb.
Audi's sets and staging are brilliantly colorful, with imaginative staging and creative props. This all adds to the magic of the opera, which is intended for kids from 4 to 120 years old. The only issue I have with this recording is the close ups; the colors and imaginative sets work very well for the whole stage, but create some confusion when the singers are seen close-in with those bright primary colors in the background.  The sound on this recording is very good except in a few instances where the voice gets somewhat lost either because of distance from the microphones or masking by a prop.
Overall, this is a recording to keep and show to kids and adults alike. Great music, and magic spectacle. Magic flute for Tamino. Magic glockenspiel for Papageno. Magic all around for us.",1453248000,,1407,4.673387096774194
8600896,5,B00E45VI1C,"Great performance and beautiful stage art. On top, I'm amazed with the high quality audio and video.
This is must to have.",1441843200,,122,4.590909090909091
8600897,3,B00E45VI1C,"Staging and costumes are not nice to see. Music,& Singers good!",1440720000,2,63,4.818181818181818
8600898,5,B00E45VI1C,"This is well done, well sung, very fun production. It's not a kids opera. There are some deep concepts at work in this mighty opera from Mozart and well-controlled by by Mutti. I really enjoyed every moment. The costumes are wonderful and the staging extravagant. I especially like to see big productions in this age of the spartan style.

Rene Pape is terrific. I have come to appreciate his work more and more every time I see him. The members of the Vienna Boys Choir add beautiful notes and charm.

This is an all around great addition to anyone's collection. I think every home should have this production except for one little typical European thing. Why must the curtain have a rather large and prominent penis? You might not notice but then again, you probably will. And so will the kids. It's a detraction in that you'll have to explain it though the opera is not about sex. Too bad. Buy it anyway.",1436572800,3,907,4.558282208588957
8600899,5,B00E45VI1C,"Outstanding. Just a much fun as Mozart intended. All the extreme very colorful sets, costumes etc. and performed by all to perfection. Just pure ""FUN"".",1432684800,2,151,5.08
8600900,5,B00E45VI1C,"Ah Mozart! Excellent recording.
Let's have the bluray of the Kenneth Branagh version set in the first world war.",1431820800,,112,4.947368421052632
8600901,5,B00E45VI1C,"Does anyone need to defend DIE ZAUBERFLOTE against negative criticism? Does its popularity have to be explained? Is the work's radiance a result of its text by Emanuel Schikaneder or the music by Mozart? Would the answers to these questions make an inexperienced listener listen?
DIE ZAUBERFLOTE transcends such games of interrogation. Just listen. Watch. The magic embodied in this blest creation of doomed men will long inspire generations to come. And this might be a recording to put into a Package for the Future and mail it into another century. It's that good a performance .Genia Kuhmeier sings Pamina with joy and grief. Paul Groves is simply one of my favorite Taminos. Christian Gerhaher has comic stage presence as Papageno and does NOT overact the part, he embodies it. The sheer rotundity of Otto Moll'svoice make him  my favorite Sarastro, but Rene Pape sings and acts with admirable gravitas as he adds yet another triumphant role to his illustrious career. Diana Damrau surprised me with a perfectly pitched and convincing Queen of the Night. Riccardo Muti deserved the full measure of the applause that greeted him during curtain calls. I have a high regard for Pierre Audi's stagings and this production is one of his finest, aided by Karel Appel's childlike or archtypal  stage designs.//Altogether this opera dvd or bluray is a treasure.",1424304000,5,1358,5.058035714285714
