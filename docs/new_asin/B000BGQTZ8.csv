8086420,1,B000BGQTZ8,A compilation not worth reviewing.,1431043200,,34,6.0
8086421,2,B000BGQTZ8,"Its a guide only that. I really want something more explicit and with more zoom in the body areas-
The actors are good, you can see them like real couples, but the images are a little old

If you want and erotic video when you can see the sexual contact, this is NOT the video that you looking for.

But if you want a sexual guide without sexual contact images, this is the video.",1362528000,,380,4.121621621621622
8086422,5,B000BGQTZ8,"Great DVD with a good understanding and explanation of Kama Sutra, and lots of hot sex too!  It is explicit but def not hardcore.  The couples in this video are good-looking and seem to be in genuine relationships with each other.  That made a huge difference for us in our enjoyment of watching it together.  We learned a lot and have had a very romantic evening every time we put the DVD on.  We've watched it more than once... you will too!",1291766400,3,443,4.353658536585366
8086423,3,B000BGQTZ8,this video was ok to watch if you are a virgin. not hard core. looks a little 80's. the asian chick is in another video with another man so not really all committed couples. glad i didn't pay the full price for it not worth it especially if you are already experienced with love making since the positions were nothing new.,1214438400,3,323,4.311475409836065
8086424,5,B000BGQTZ8,"Well - I have viewed quite a bit of material concerning Kamasutra. And just to make the point: Kamasutra is not just exotic acrobatic pornography. It is THAT TOO of course, but since old Asian cultures did not cut A ONE AND WHOLE THING as they percieved it up into little departments like Sex, Porn, Sensuality, Love, Eroticism, Petting, Stroking and Cuddling, Taking, Eating, Pleasure of Physical Togetherness - as our modern cultures with many taboos do now, there is more to it. This ""more"" however is a bit hard to find in the muddy waters of hard core porn that loves to add a tinge of exotic flair to its productions.
One can read dozens of books and look at many dvds/videos and study all kinds of philosophy regarding Kamasutra - and will always stumble over this problem of division.
Alas - for a couple that would like to have an overview and an entrance to the possibility of enhancing ones chances for more intimacy (including some inspirational techniques) I highly recommend this dvd. The couples are definitely devoted to each other, wether they are professionals or not. They are physically attractive. The overall tone of the commented (!) dvd is in warm beautiful and harmonius coloring; the music tastefully underlining. It is - I add again - not hardcore! And it very well delivers more then sex-techniques! It refrains from sexual acrobacy.  It's chapters on erotic massage and hightening sensual experience as well as creating lovingly warm and sizzling athmospheres are very helpfull - and since it is a dvd - not a rather dry book - easy to understand.",1198713600,15,1576,4.794117647058823
8086425,2,B000BGQTZ8,"The producer of these videos uses real couples most of which are porn actors because they are more comfortable having sex on camera.  You don't know how much is real and how much is acting.  You still get the feeling you are watching porn; which was a big negative for me.  There was not a lot of instruction just mostly people having sex which made be suspicious that this was just another way to introduce someone to porn.  I wish it had more of a scientific, instructional, universtiy study approach.",1190678400,10,503,4.555555555555555
