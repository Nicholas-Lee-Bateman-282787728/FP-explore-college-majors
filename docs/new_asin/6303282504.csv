7842908,5,6303282504,"Although somewhat abstract and harder for young children to understand, ""Lights"", is an entertaining well done animated 28 minute synopsis of the meaning behind Hannukah. Narrated well, includes some very popular actors playing roles in the piece. Thank you for a well done short film.",1041033600,5,285,5.355555555555555
7842909,5,6303282504,"This is a sophisticated presentation that will move both child and adult.  Builds strong identity as well as being a fabulous introduction to Chanukah for non-Jews.
A winner--no shlock here!",1040342400,4,190,5.333333333333333
7842910,5,6303282504,"To be honest, I expected this to be yet another tired re-telling of the Maccabees versus the Greeks.  I was pleasantly surprised, and this video quickly became one of my all-time favorite Hanukkah movies for children --  and adults, too!
In this presentation, the war theme is thankfully kept  to a minimum.  Instead, the focus is on the question of forced assimilation  of the Jews into Greek culture. This is represented by the use of dancing  animated Hebrew letters -- the ""lights"" -- that follow the Jewish  characters and come floating up from the Torah scroll as it is read, etc.  The replacement of the brilliant, dancing Hebrew letters with sluggish,  duller Greek ones -- and the social oppression that follows -- is overcome,  of course, by the Jewish heroes, who free the lights to shine brightly once  more.
I especially liked the idea that the kids in the opening scene (in  ancient Israel) are the same kids as in the closing scene (in modern times)  which gives a sense of cultural continuity ""from generation to  generation.""  This is a story that is written on many levels, and will  be enojyed by your family every year.  Highly recommended!",941500800,28,1160,4.777777777777778
