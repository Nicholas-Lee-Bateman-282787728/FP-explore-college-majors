4165789,5,B003Q7B7F6,"As long as there are plenty of full-length Y2J mat classics, this DVD will be worth your time.

Jericho has been a solid rock for WWE (and WCW), and this DVD is LONG overdue! Finally, McMahon gives me a reason to spend money on his product!",1276128000,3,240,4.217391304347826
4165820,4,B003Q7B7F6,"If you have been a regular purchaser of WWE home video titles, you know that their special DVD/Blu-ray releases are a mixed bag. You often get an average documentary with a decent collection of matches. Breaking the Code: Behind the Walls of Chris Jericho is an exception to this. This 3-disc set is worth every penny, more so if you are a Jerichoholic like myself. One of the many reasons Jericho is so good at what he does in the ring is that he has traveled all over the world gaining knowledge and experience in the art of professional wrestling. You read correctly, PROFESSIONAL WRESTLING not ""sport entertainment"" as WWE would have you think. This set and the included documentary is a testament to the hall of fame career of a great pro wrestler. He shares his insight and stories throughout the course of the documentary. Now, if you have read his first autobiography, you will not learn anything new here. However, Jericho's charm and personality will make you hang on his every word. Reading his story and actually hearing him tell it are two different experiences all together. If you consider yourself a true Jericho fan, you will want to know both.

Every single extra on this is must see. Some of them are: hilarious vignettes when he and Lance Storm were the Thrill Seekers, some memorable WCW promos, and a truly great story shared by Christian. Most of the matches here have been carefully selected. If you have not read any other review on Amazon or elsewhere, you should know that no Chris Benoit match made it onto this release. I will let you take a guess why. Trust me though, all the matches on here are fantastic. Some have never been released before in the U.S. market such as his 1995 match against Ultimo Dragon in Japan. That match along with his WrestleMania XIX match against Shawn Michaels has an alternate commentary track recorded by Y2J himself and Matt Striker. Would I change anything about this DVD set? Yes. I do wish he told more stories about his time abroad in Germany and Japan. There should have been some other matches included from his run in ECW and elsewhere. Also, why was there not a Blu-ray version of this released? It would have been great to watch this all in hi-def. HD quality or not, if you are a Jerichoholic, you probably already own this and love it. If you are a pro wrestling fan on the fence about purchasing this, do not wait any longer and get it now.",1418601600,,2415,4.577367205542725

4165823,5,B003Q7B7F6,"I fell out of favor of the WWE since about 2004 or so when things started getting really predictable and stale, but came upon this documentary on Netflix earlier in the year and thought I'd give it a watch. I'm glad I did as it is a very comprehensive and detailed look into the life and career of one of the greatest WWE superstars of all time, and one of my personal favorites. I was very glad to sit down and take the time to get into this despite the fact that I haven't liked the WWE product in quite some time.

This documentary (and several others) took me back to the glory days of wrestling, when I was a kid/preteen totally into everything about the wrestling business, and made me pine for the good old days of professional wrestling. It made me hope the good old days would return sometime and I could get back into wrestling once again.",1388966400,,849,4.30625
4165824,5,B003Q7B7F6,"This long-overdue compilation of the career of Chris Jericho is a must have for any Jerichoholic.  Beginning with his early beginnings and running through he 2007 return to the WWE, it covers all the bases - from his troubles with Goldburg in WCW, to working with Chyna in the WWE, to his breakthrough rivalries with Triple H and Stephanie McMahon, and becoming the first-ever Undisputed World Champion, the first of six Heavyweight Title reigns.  The three-disc set also includes all of his biggest matches through 2009, including the epic one at Penn State in 2000 vs. Triple H.  Chris provides commentary on a couple matches as well, and I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD compilation.",1376179200,,683,4.973684210526316
4165825,4,B003Q7B7F6,"I have been a fan of Chris Jericho for so long. I read his first book and decided to get this set, well, just because. I must say it does not disappoint. The documentary is very good and the extra's are so hilarious. I think my only complaint is that there is zero mention of Chris Benoit. It's sad because CB played a pretty big role in Jericho's career. They had a lot of good matches too. Truth be told, I can't say I didn't expect this. It is what it is. Other than that, I think this is an awesome set and I recommend it to anybody willing to watch it.",1373068800,,557,3.982142857142857
4165826,5,B003Q7B7F6,"A strong telling of what Chris Jericho went through during the territory system prior to joining WWF (now WWE). Also explains how he was able to integrate the various styles into one, entertaining package.

4165827,5,B003Q7B7F6,My husband love's wrestling. In fact he wrestles. Jericho is one of his all time favs. It was very delighted to receive this dvd. He didn't complain about any difficulty in terms of playing the dvd,1348099200,,197,4.5

4165829,4,B003Q7B7F6,"Chris Jericho was the last of the great modern wrestling stars to get his own Dvd biography. Well, It  was worth the wait to be sure. I loved Chris' book so I kind of knew where his story was going, and that made the ride even more enjoyable.

4165860,4,B003Q7B7F6,"It is one of WWE's greatest DVD's. I gave it 4 stars because I read both of his books before seeing this so it didn't give me any info that I didn't know, but the matches were great and it is worth the money.",1336176000,,208,3.75
4165861,5,B003Q7B7F6,"The Ayatollah of Rock and Rolla, The First Ever Undisupted Champion, Larger Than Life, The Best In The World At What I Do, or any number of nicknames can be used to describe just one man, Chris Jericho. This is his story of how he became one of the greatest superstars in the history of wrestling from growing up in Winnipeg, Manitoba, to wrestling on the indy circuit in Canada and beyond.

Its great to hear from Chris about how he left Canada to learn how to wrestle in Mexico, Germany, Japan and other countries before breaking into the U.S. scene in ECW, moving onto WCW where he was featured as a top level cruiserweight who really wanted to break through into the main event but politics prevented this (see his rivalry with Goldberg for an example). Once he got to WWE he was hoping this would be his big break however it took a while even after a fantastic debut that is still talked about today.

The rest of the bio follows his WWE tenure, from winning the WWE title from Triple H, but having the title stripped shortly after, his winning the I.C. title more times than any man in history, of course they talk about his winning the Undisupted Title and his personal feelings on being the main event of Wrestlemania X-8 following Rock/Hogan. The best part was him talking about working with his idol Shawn Michaels at Wrestlemania XIX and how he really felt honored to be put in the same class by the announcers and fans.

What makes this documentary great is hearing about how he set up his life before doing wrestling by getting his degree, which would lead to him writing two best selling books, also how he got into music and became the lead singer of the band Fozzy which led to his depature in '05, so he could take a break and tour and deal with some personal stuff like his mom passing away. His comeback in '07 and how he re-invented himself by turning heel in '08, his rivalry with Shawn Michaels and how he enjoyed playing that type of heel cause it was something different.

However near the end it comes a tad off the tracks when talking about his match with Edge at Wrestlemania XXVI, praising it like it should've been the main event when it wasn't really that great and felt quite forced leading up to the PPV. But that being said the bio as a whole is very entertaining, for the most part Jericho's honesty is great and while I would've liked more details into his international work.

Special Features on Disc 1

-6/11/98, WCW Thunder, Father Knows Best: While doing a promo Chris' real life father comes out and basically tells him to quit whining. Decent on here.

-10/30/00, Raw, Do You Smell What Y2J is Cookin'?: During a promo they go back and forth cutting each other off and Jericho ends up stealing Rock's famous catchphrase. Rock comes back running him down and stealing one of his catchphrases.

Disc 2

An Introducion By Chris Jericho: The man himself introduces us to the following matches saying these were his personal picks as he felt they were important to his career.

-10/2/90, Calgary, Alberta, Canada, vs. Lance T. Storm: Really grainy video here with two very young guys putting on a good wrestling match with some great back and forth action. The video is again quite bad, the audio is choppy but its cool to see them both at the beginning of their careers. The match ends up going to the time limit draw. 3/10. Featuring Alternate Commentary by Chris Jericho and Matt Striker.

-3/12/94, Smokey Mountain Wrestling, w/Lance Storm vs. The Infernos: Standard tag match here with Storm and Jericho hitting some good mat wrestling, rest holds and of course some high flying moves. It ends with a double dropkick from both and Storm covers to win. 3/10.

-7/7/95, Japan, International Junior Heavyweight Championship Match, vs. Ultimo Dragon: Taking from an old tape in Chris' collection, this was a great match between two of my favorites. They traded momentum often in this match, displayed great ground and aerial moves and put on a great performance that excited the Japanese fans. Loved the pace as these two never slowed down and went all out, tons of nearfalls and it finally ended with Jericho hitting a double arm suplex from the top and covered to win. 9/10. Features Alternate Commentary by Chris Jericho and Matt Striker.

-3/12/96, ECW Hardcore TV, vs. Cactus Jack: Decent contest here where Jericho kept fighting from underneath, Jack beat him down and things spilled out to the outside of the ring a couple of times. Jericho was finally able to hit a german suplex and pinned Cactus for three. 6/10.

-9/14/97, WCW Fall Brawl, WCW Crusierweight Championship Match, vs. Eddie Guerrero: The two ring set up was cool and these two did a great job putting on a good match and exciting the crowd. Lots of good mat wrestling as both knew each other well, they traded move for move for a bit. Once things went to the air it picked up even more, the end was great as Guerrero countered a superplex then hit the frog splash and covered to win the title. 8/10.

-2/22/98, WCW Superbrawl VIII, Mask vs. WCW Crusierweight Championship Match, vs. Juventud Guerrera: A good one here where Juvi not only needed to win the match but must also win the title or he would have to unmask. Jericho tried to get counted out at one point, thus Juvi would've lost his mask, which was a funny moment. There's actually a lot of good action and plenty of good heel tactics by Jericho. Juvi almost had the title won but ended up tapping out to the Lion Tamer. 8/10. The post match where he unmasks didn't really receive a lot of reaction from the crowd.

-7/27/98, WCW Nitro, WCW Crusierweight Championship Match, vs. Dean Malenko: It starts out fast with Jericho taking it to Dean, hitting a splash to the outside and he beat him up in and out of the ring for a few. Jericho hits the Lionsault but only for two, Malenko gets the Texas Cloverleaf but Chris gets to the rope, Dean hits a huge DDT off the top but Jericho grabs the rope before 3. Chris grabs some knucks but Dean ends up using them and he gets DQ'd. 5/10 for the finish.

-9/9/99, Raw, The Millennium Countdown Clock Expires: The countdown that took weeks to finish finally counted down to 0 and Jericho made his debut in WWE, to a huge reaction from the crowd. He immediately got into a verbal spat with The Rock, which was very enteratining. Great debut.

-2/27/00, No Way Out, WWE Intercontinental Championship Match, vs. Kurt Angle: Not a bad one here though short after they're pre-match promos are done, Jericho does hit some good moves, Kurt displays great mat based wrestling. There are some close nearfalls and Jericho almost has the match won, the title belt is brought into the ring, Chris goes for the Lionsault but Angle puts the belt in the way and covers Jericho to win. 5/10.

-4/17/00, Raw, WWE Championship Match, vs. Triple H (Champion): Jericho does a great promo where he slams Stephanie McMahon, Trips, Steph and Shane come out, Chris still runs them down and says he should put the title on the line in their match. Jericho says he has some insurance to make sure this is a fair match and out comes the APA. The match itself is good but short, however the crowd is on fire throughout the whole contest as they really wanted Jericho to win. Chris does great using his quickness while Trips uses his strength to beat up Jericho, the ref gets knocked down, Earl Hebner comes in and gets knocked down, Chris hits the Lionsault and Earl fast counts to three and we have a new champion. 6/10.

-10/21/01, No Mercy, WCW Championship Match, vs. The Rock (Champion): This was during the terrible Alliance storyline where WCW/ECW was trying to take down the WWE. These two had great chemistry and it showed in this match. Plenty of counters, good wrestling even a little brawling and the underlying story was could Jericho be a main eventer against the likes of The Rock. He was able to do well though Rock did dominate a good portion of the match, even hitting a Rock Bottom through the announce table, funny how the crowd was more pro-Jericho than pro-Rock. Stephanie McMahon comes down, throws a chair in the ring but gets a Rock Bottom for her troubles. Jericho hits the Breakdown on Rock on a chair and makes the cover to win the WCW title. 10/10.

-12/9/01, Vengeance, WWE Undisputed Championship Match, vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin (Champion): Before the match started, Kurt came down and hit Austin with a chair then Rock hit a Rock Bottom on Jericho and he chased Angle to the back. Once the bell rings Jericho comes to and tries to pins Austin but only for two, then chops at Steve, beats him down in the corner. Austin comes back ramming Chris' head into the turnbuckle a few times, then chops and stomps him against the barricade then into the ring post shoulder first a couple of times. Austin removes the protective mat and suplexes Chris onto the concrete floor, but soon after goes shoulder first into two ring posts, then Jericho locks on an arm bar submission. Later the ref is knocked down, Vince brings down referee Nick Patrick but Flair knocks him out then Flair gets nailed into the post by Vince, but Austin stomps him down. Steve takes over and locks on the Walls of Jericho but there's no ref, Booker T sneaks in, hits Austin in the back of the head with the title belt, Jericho makes the cover and becomes the first Undisputed Champion. 8/10.

Disc 3

-5/2/02, Smackdown, No DQ Match for the WWE Undisputed Championship, vs. Hulk Hogan (Champion): We get the usual hulking up and Hogan antics while Jericho got some good moves in and targets Hulk's throat. Triple H's music hits, he joins the commentary team and he had some funny comments, Hogan hulks up and goes for the leg drop but Jericho counters and locks on the Walls of Jericho. Chris goes for a chair, hits Hulk in the back then Undertaker's music hits, which distracts Jericho and Hogan rolls him up to retain his title. 5/10.

-3/30/03, Wrestlemania XIX, vs. Shawn Michaels: The build up for this one was very well done. Its one of the best Wrestlemania matches ever, after some early wrestling it becomes a series of one-upping as each guy hits big move after big move and Jericho really shines here as he was wrestling his idol and Michaels proved he was still Mr. Wrestlemania. Jericho worked on Shawn's back with backbreakers and the Walls of Jericho, also hitting his version of Sweet Chin Music, Michaels kept battling back and eventually hits a roll-up out of the corner and pins Chris for three. 11/10. Loved the post match handshake and hug then Jericho hits a lowblow on Shawn and leaves the ring. Features Alternate Commentary by Chris Jericho & Matt Striker.

-8/22/05, Raw, ""You're Fired"" Match for the WWE Championship, vs. John Cena (Champion): The night after losing at Summerslam, Jericho gets another chance at the title, he does bring his A-game and really takes it to Cena after GM Eric Bischoff grabs Cena's foot. Chris did make John look good here as Cena hit his usual set of moves, Jericho and even Bischoff tried everything to make Cena lose but Cena hit a big FU and covered to win. 7/10. Loved how the post-match stuff was included as Bischoff fired Jericho and he was carried away from the arena kicking and screaming.

-11/19/07, Raw, Save_US.Y2J: Randy Orton is in the ring talking about how he deserves the torch to be passed to him, so some guy is running to the arena carrying a torch, but he gets clotheslined by someone who turns out to be Chris Jericho. He comes out to a big reaction and runs down Orton saying he's gonna take his title.

-3/10/08, Raw, WWE Intercontinental Championship Match, vs. Jeff Hardy (Champion): After hitting a Twist of Fate the week before, we have this contest, both hit some hard shots, Hardy hits his unique offense, Jericho wears down the quicker Jeff. Chris hits the Lionsault but only for two, Hardy counters the Walls of Jericho but only for two, Jeff misses the Swanton then Jericho hits the Codebreaker and covers to win. 6/10.

-10/5/08, No Mercy, Ladder Match for the World Heavyweight Championship, vs. Shawn Michaels: These two had a big rivalry throughout the summer and fall of '08 and this was the climax in the match of matches. Its a great ladder match, though not as spotty as others in the past, but when it was used they made it count, like Michaels getting pushed off the ladder into the ropes, Jericho slamming the ladder into Shawn's ribs. It was just a good hard hitting match, that saw both take falls from the ladder, the best being Shawn and Jericho crashing through the announce table from about 8 feet off a ladder. Lance Cade interferes preventing Shawn from getting the title, Jericho and Michaels battle at the top with Jericho hitting a headbutt, Michaels falls and Chris grabs the title to win. 10/10.

-6/7/09, Extreme Rules, No Holds Barred Match for the WWE Intercontinental Championship, vs. Rey Mysterio (Champion): Jericho starts at the merchandise stand where he runs down Mysterio calling him a liar, then goes through the crowd to the ring continuing to slam him. This was a good match where they showed a faster more agressive style, they fought in and out of the ring and besides a chair there wasn't a lot of weapon usage. Jericho grounded Rey who countered with some moves we hadn't seen in years from him and the same can be said for Jericho as he hit a great swinging back breaker but only for two. Tons of nearfalls follow and at the end Rey goes for the 619, Jericho tears the mask off and rolls Mysterio up to win the title. 10/10.

-11/13/09, Smackdown, vs. The Undertaker: From the U.K. this was the first ever one on one meeting between these two, Taker hits his usual set of power moves while Chris did his best to chop down the big man. Jericho did counter Old School and locked on a half nelson, Taker fought out of it, though and hit the Lionsault then went for the Walls of Jericho but Taker fights out of it, locks on Hells Gate and Jericho taps out. 6/10.

-3/28/10, Wrestlemania XXVI, World Heavyweight Championship Match, vs. Edge: Not a bad one here but it seemed just a tad forced given the spear chant Edge had going and that I don't think people bought into him coming back as a face. That being said they do work well together, but they have had better matches in the past, but for this match Chris targets the injured leg of Edge and his back setting up for the Walls, while Edge went after Jericho and kept setting up for the spear. Jericho hits Edge with the title belt then a Codebreaker and covers Edge to retain his title. 7/10. The aftermath was decent as Edge went nuts and hit a spear off the announce table through the barricade.

Its great as far as the bio, very detailed though again more time spent on his earlier days would've been nice. The match selection was also good as these were his personal picks so at least each match meant something to him. For Jericho fans its a must buy.",1332115200,,17346,4.577047066408769
4165862,5,B003Q7B7F6,"At long last Jericho gets his own DVD collection behind scrubs like John Morrison. As a long time Jericho mark, I was pumped by the documentary (although his books are better - highly recommend) and the one liners section was outstanding. Matches were great; but the WWE had so many more - a 4 disc set for a 20 yr performer seems the least they could do. For  a true fan of wrestling; this is a must have - a home run for sure!

Because WWE has such a huge library of footage, these kind of documentaries work well because you can see the footage of his evolution throughout the years. I would certainly recommend any Jericho fan to watch this. If you only know the Chris Jericho from the last couple of years while he wore a suit then this is a perfect way to see what he was before that, how he matured over the years and wanted to be the best he could.",1305590400,,569,4.181818181818182

4165865,5,B003Q7B7F6,"Chris Jericho finally gets the 3 disc treatment from the wwe and it's certainly being worth the wait, what you get here is a close to a 2hour documentary on jericho and then 2 disc containing 19 of his best matches from an amazing career.

Disc 1's main feature is the documentary of Chris beginning with his life as a youngster who loves wrestling who goes of to Mexico and Japan to become an international superstar, and goes on to cover his time in ECW, WCW before he makes his that legendary debut in WWE with the help of the Millennium clock which stikes zero right as The Rock is doing one of his famous promo's, anybody who read his excellent first book ""A Lion's Tale"" will be familiar with a lot of the material and stories here, such as when he was in WCW and Bill Goldberg refused to take him serious, his WWE career covered in the disc is interesting from his first stint which includes the highlight of becoming the company first Undisputed champion to facing his hero Shawn Michaels at Wrestlemania XIX, it also covers his time away from the ring between 2005 and 2007 when he toured with his band Fozzy, its looks at how he reinvented his career and how watching the movie ""No Country For Old Men"" gave him the idea for his new persona. There is the usual talking heads included such as Christian, edge, Shawn michaels as well as Chris himself. Disc 1 has some cool extras such as stuff that happens when Raw goes off air and the cameras keep rolling the highlight being him sharing a beer with Stone Cold that features some good and fort stuff on the mic between the two. Also included is his legendary Man of 1,004 holds from Nitro in 1998.

Dvd 2 and 3 includes the material you will come back for, his matches and there is some classics included here such as his junior international heavyweight championship match against Ultimo Dragon from 1995 in July, his cruiserweight matches(the cruiserweights in wcw featured fast paced action with lots of submission style wrestling) in WCW were the best thing on Nitro at the time as he battles Eddie Guerrero,Juventud Guerrera and Dean Malenko. The highlights of his WWE matches are his two aganinst Shawn Michaels from Wrestlemania XIX and a laddermatch from 2008 at No Mercy. To watch these two men go at it is great and features thrilling action. His match against Rey Mysterio from Extreme Rules in 2009 is anon stop back and forth thriller. Also included are matches against Kurt Angle(no way out 2000), The Rock(for the wcw title at No Mercy 2001)as well as the match against Triple H from Raw in 2000 when he thought he had become WWE champion for the first time.

His Raw debut is included as is his return in 2007 when he came back to SAVE_US, both are good and funny in their own ways. Chris Jerich is one of the best wrestlers ever to grace a wrestling wring as is one of the best talkers in the game whether it be playing Y2J or His Best In The World At What I Do, better than everybody else gimmick. This Dvd is nearly 9 hours of Chris Jericho a must for any Jeraholic!!",1299024000,,3046,4.445438282647585
4165866,5,B003Q7B7F6,"Jericho's been my favorite pro wrestler since I started watching almost a decade ago. My excitement for his epic victory over the seemingly-unstoppable Rock and Steve Austin for the biggest prize in the game on the same night was on the same level at least as a die-hard football fan's team winning the SuperBowl. His in-ring style/prowess and comedic talent are what captivated me early on all those years ago, and are two factors he still has in spades to this day. After watching this encompassing dvd that works as a visual WWE-ified version of his interesting book, A Lion's Tale(a great companion piece for a better look at his pre-WWE life), I've figured out what makes him the best he is at what he does, which is the sheer consistency of his work throughout his career, something he owes no credit to but himself. Whether its outperforming ""Mr. Wrestlemania"" Shawn Michaels on his own show or getting the very best out of old fogies like Hogan and Undertaker, Jericho encapsulates sports entertainment and is the one man who always gets a good match out of anyone, even if the crowd is dead on arrival. This dvd is a satisfying, often humorous, look at the man's career; taking a detour to his life outside, but mostly hitting the high notes. My favorite aspect was seeing skits from his t.v past thought lost in the annals of boob-tube history, including very random footage, highlights being the ridiculous sightseeing promo for his team the Thrillseekers and a post-Raw segment with Stone Cold Steve Austin more entertaining than their actual match showcased on the extras. The matches are all good, however, Jericho's got enough material worth five disks at least; noticeable omissions I noticed was the lack of various ""big"" matches he was a part of such as the first MITB or Elimination Chamber or TLC 4/5, something that would've spiced up the single-match heavy disk some more. Another was the lack of Benoit, Jericho's one great rival throughout his career. His notoriety is reason enough to omit him; however any fan can see the holes classics such as the Royal Rumble ladder match were supposed to fill had things turned out differently. The final nitpick would be the lack of WWE promos showing the soap opera hijinks that lead up to to the event. They were always something WWE did well, their omission  from the matches that apply being something missed by this nostalgia seeker. All in all, this dvd is fun all the way through, and I recommend it to both Jerichoholics and people hoping to see the aspect of pro wrestling worth watching represented in the career of one Ayatollah of Rock N' Rolla.",1293494400,,2621,4.773127753303965

4165869,3,B003Q7B7F6,"Breaking The Code: Behind the Walls of Chris Jericho is a fairly serviceable DVD of Jericho's 20 year career. I have my personal issues with it. *NOTE* this will just be about the main feature/documentary. First the positives: Jericho, as the narrator, does a fantastic job of talking about some of the things that made him so popular during the late 1990s in WCW, and how he got his start in the United States working in SMW, ECW and bringing never before seen styles into the states. Also, I like his honesty on certain aspects of his career when he was in the WWF/E for the first time. The DVD also highlights his work in other countries, training in Canada, working in Mexico, Japan and Germany.

Now the negatives: I felt like they skimmed through the time he spent in Mexico and Japan WAYYYYY too quickly. I was actually checking the time on the tracker, and to my surprise noticed there was still well over an hour left on the DVD's time length. They didn't include Chris meeting Eddie Guerrero for the first time, his participation in the Super J Cup, or any of the success he had as far as championships attained, or people he defeated while in these promotions.

My next problem is the lack of time they spent on how crucial he was to ECW's rise in the mid 90s. ECW helped bring in a lot of the cruiserweight wrestlers who would later go on to WCW and even WWE, and put them on the map. People such as Juventud Guerrera, Rey Misterio Jr., Psicosis, Dean Malenko, etc. were a huge part of what made ECW so special. I suppose people who already have the Rise and Fall of ECW DVD may already understand this, but it still could have been included.

His time with WCW was well documented I thought, but there seemed to really be a lot of revisionism when it came to Jericho's time in WWFE. I recall him saying that beating The Rock and Steve Austin in the same night was a huge achievement for him and was a big deal....which I definitely agree that it was. He was the first undisputed champion in the then-WWF. However, his entire run as champion after that took place was an afterthought. Surprisingly, they did not just totally ignore the fact that Hogan vs Rock from Wrestlemania X-8 COMPLETELY overshadowed the match Jericho had vs HHH for the undisputed belt. He still feels that it was a big moment for him, yet he did not like teaming with Stephanie. I feel that the entire buildup for that match was pedestrian at best. Jericho was treated as a total joke as the undisputed champion, and it was predictable that he would drop the belt to HHH at that year's WrestleMania, as HHH had been out close to a year prior to that with a quadriceps tear.

The next thing I recall that bothered me was the idea that the Wrestlemania XIX match he had vs HBK was considered the show stealer. I know this is all subjective, but I felt that the match was very good, but not better than the later match Jericho had with HBK in 2008. I think that match had more real emotion and a stronger story attached to it. Besides, Wrestlemania XIX featured Steve Austin's very last match versus The Rock, and also the insane spot of Brock Lesnar missing a shooting star press in his match against Kurt Angle. I'd venture to say that those matches could be considered show stealers as well.

Finally, my last major gripe is something that Jericho said about Cena. He makes a very odd, and in my view. false comparison to Steve Austin, by saying that people said Cena had a good character, but was not really great in-ring wise. Jericho claims that Cena may be unorthodox in the ring, but so was another guy named Steve Austin. Now in my mind, this is more a WWE bias that is being perpetuated, and not Jericho's honest thoughts. For one, Steve Austin was considered to be a mechanic in the ring during his earlier years, as he worked for years in WCW against the likes of Tully Blanchard, Ricky Steamboat, Arn Anderson, Brian Pillman and Ric Flair. He was very vocal during his ECW stint about using wrestling as opposed to ""rasslin"" to win his matches. Steve Austin, in terms of his ringwork, was miles ahead of Cena in my humble opinion. Again, subjective, but this IS my review, and these are my thoughts.

Overall, the DVD was very insightful. It explains a lot of what Jericho did while he was away taking a break from the WWE after being ""fired"" in 2005. The majority of the documentary itself is done very well, and has a load of great Jericho moments including the 1,004 holds skit, Jericho's debut promo against The Rock, and his more recent work with Edge, Big Show and even Wade Barret.

What hurts it to me is just the revisionary style of claiming that things were better or more important than they actually were. For example, the Edge vs Jericho championship match from Wrestlemania XXVI is brought up. In this, Edge said that he feels his match against Jericho ""captured the crowd and stole the show"". This claim is fairly ridiculous to me, as some fans did not really buy into the Edge return after the Royal Rumble, or the forced ""SPEAR"" chant. Also, there is no doubt in my mind that the best match of that entire show was The Undertaker vs Shawn Michaels II, which was also Michaels' retirement match.

All in all, it is definitely worth a viewing. I would not buy it, but I honestly think for wrestling fans, it is a great piece to add to your collection. I give it 3 out of 5 sparkly vests.",1289347200,3,5399,4.446464646464647
4165890,5,B003Q7B7F6,"First off, Chris Jericho is an amazing wrestler and entertainer. This 3 disc dvd-set absolutely proves it. I felt the documentary was extremely well done, while I did feel some important things were left out or missing, I was still intrigued and entertained by the life of Jericho. To say the least, Jericho is a very unique and different person. He does some weird stuff, and it was awesome to see Jericho evolve as performer through his career. Jericho loves to entertain, and that's one of the many things that makes him the best in the world at what he does.

The extras and promos were also very fun and entertaining to watch. I'm so glad all of these were on here, because all of them are classics. The Thrill-seekers stuff was beyond werid and funny. His WCW is classic with the 1,004 holds and his trip to D.C.. And even stuff later in his carerr like his fight with the Old-man which was unforgettable.

The matches themselves are beyond incredible. I absolutely loved all of them. Very high-quality matches and I'm never dissapointed at the end of one. Very intense and exciting stuff, Jericho gives it 100% in every match. There were some I wish I could've of seen, but I'm happy with what they gave us. Ladder Match with HBK was incredible, the match that never happened with Triple H, his match with Ultimo Dragon and even more surprised how well his first match was against Lance Storm, wish that match was atleast the standard for WWE matches today.

WWE did an outstanding job with this set. 5 stars no doubt. I'm a Jericholic for life now. Highly Recommended to all WWE fans. Thank-you Jericho!",1288828800,2,1611,4.606271777003484

Chris Jericho DVD
3 DVD Discs, was released September 28, 2010

""Roses are red, violets are blue, I'm the best in the world at what I do."" - Chris Jericho on Twitter

Nothing says entertainer quite like Chris Jericho. Chris Jericho has held six different titles in the WWE including the Intercontinental title a record number of 9 times. He has been a babyface, he has been a heel, and in his spare time he just happens to be the lead singer of a band called Fozzy which gives him real street cred to be the ""Ayatollah of Rock `n' Rolla.""

On Disc 1 is a full documentary story of how Chris Jericho came into being which is my preferred format for WWE superstar collections. I find it much more enjoyable to hear the performer's story as a whole with interviews, pictures, and clips thrown in rather than a broken up timeline between matches. When Jericho was young he had a ferocious interest in becoming a wrestler but also a talent for writing. When he graduated from high school at age 17, he was too young to go straight to wrestling camp so he spent some time getting his degree in Journalism first which was a great benefit to him to have a fall-back plan and helpful when he became a New York Times best-selling author later in life.

He spent time at the Hart Wrestling Camp in Canada (which one Hart showed up to the first day to collect the money and then skedaddled) where he was trained in the style of the Hart family. Along with one other serious wrestler with serious ambition, Lance Storm, they pushed each other to their limits with high-flying maneuvers at events where they were paid $30 as if it were WrestleMania. Jericho truly became a world class sports entertainer when he moved on to wrestling in Mexico where he became a star and then onto Japan where animal names prevailed and he wrestled under the name ""Lionheart.""

Eventually he came to wrestle in the United States for the first time in ECW with stars like Cactus Jack and then WCW where the character Chris Jericho began to take shape. Jericho struggled between good and bad for many years and mostly just tried to be entertainingly funny and would do anything to get a reaction from the crowd including scoffing at one wrestler's claim to be the man of 1,000 holds by one-upping him with the claim that Jericho was the man of 1,004 holds and proceeded to read them off several attached pieces of printer paper on the air. Jericho was a member of the Cruiserweight class and took that belt to new heights, but when he wanted to play with the big boys by starting a fight with Goldberg, it never amounted to anything and he grew disappointed with his time at WCW. Time to move on to the WWE!

Chris Jericho's entrance to the WWE is one of the most remembered moments in sports entertainment as the vignettes led up to the millennium clock counting down and a huge entrance with fireworks and music interrupting the Rock's address to the people. After ""three boring minutes"", the Rock informed Chris Jericho that it didn't matter what his name was and the moment became legend. Chris continued being all rock `n' roll, long hair, stealing finishing moves, and performing moonsaults all over the place, but still had trouble finding his place until the first time he won the Intercontinental belt, the belt he has held more than any other wrestler in WWE history.

As EVERYONE knows, he went on to defeat the Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin in one night and became the first ever Undisputed champion, a title which no longer exists today except in legend. (Titles get unified all the time. The Divas got a second belt introduced, now it is united. There were two tag team sets of belts for WWE and World and now they are unified.) In 2005, he needed a break to tour with his band and chose his exit through a ""You're Fired!"" match for the championship against John Cena where he left begging, pleading, groveling, and eventually was carried about by security much to his own amusement. He claims when he does leave the WWE for good, he can only hope it will be like a dog with his tail between his legs and doesn't wish to have a hero's farewell.

In November of 2007, Chris Jericho made another vignette-filled return to Raw, this time interrupting Randy Orton's passing the torch runner, a ceremony that had been built up all evening by Randy RKOing whoever the winner of the current match was and then asking everyone to turn their attention to the big screen to watch his torch runner's progress. I remember watching that night and it was HILARIOUS. Jericho came back sparkly vest and all with a new short haircut and an abbreviated speech of about a minute where he informed Orton that he wished to take that title from him as soon as possible. After a few months of facing superstars as a babyface, winning the Intercontinental belt and not really feeling at peace with his situation, he switched to heel and started a big feud with Shawn Michaels by putting his face into the Jerichotron 5000's expensive screen from his Highlight reel show.

Since then, he began wearing suits, changed his entrance music, and speaks in a dry tone calling everyone in the WWE ""hypocrites"" and my personal favorite, ""gelatinous tapeworms."" The turn did him a lot of good as it afforded him the opportunity for more world championship opportunities and a long story with the Big Show as a tag team partner in ""Jerishow"", trying to and eventually succeeding in ripping off Rey Mysterio's mask, and facing former tag team partner and rival, Edge at WrestleMania this year.

At the current time, Jericho is out for a break after Randy Orton punted him in the skull at the Monday Night Raw Dan and I got to watch in Indianapolis on September 20th (it was taped in advance). Not only did we get to see an amazing match between two favorites - Chris Jericho and Randy Orton, but we got to see Orton PUNT someone...AND it was Jericho! It really doesn't get better than that. If you want to hear about the rest of that night, check out the blog entry HERE.

This is a fabulous set, it has many, many, many GREAT matches on it. A couple of the very early ones are VHS rips that look pretty fuzzy and the one that was taped in Japan has a buzzing noise and Japanese commentary on it so you'd be better off muting it or listening to Jericho and Matt Striker's commentary on the match. There are three different matches with alternate commentary with Jericho and Striker - his first fuzzy match, Japan, and Jericho vs Shawn Michaels at WrestleMania XIX which is arguably one of his best matches ever.

Special Features:

You'll get to see Chris Jericho's entire first introduction into the WWE at ""The Millennium Clock Expires"" on New Years' Eve at Raw 1999 and his triumphant return at ""Save_US.Y2J"" on Raw in November of 2007. There are some interview segments and stories that didn't make it into the documentary like the tale of how he got the name Jericho when his original name Jack Action was made fun of by his friend, how he got the title of Leon de Oro in Mexico, and other stars opinions of him when he was an up and coming star. You get to see some vignettes of him in the Thrill Seekers, watch his entire ""Man of 1,004 holds"" sketch on Nitro in 1998, his Conspiracy Victim sketch in Washington, D.C., and a fun promo with the Rock, sharing a beer with Stone Cold Steve Austin after the live taping, a reel of many of his funnier moments, and to top it all off -- the music video from his band, Fozzy of ""Let the Madness Begin.""

You can call him by any of his names but the fact is that Chris Jericho is one of the greatest sports entertainers of this generation. A man who has the complete package of wrestling ability & entertainment value. This release is long overdue but finally we can hear the story behind the man. Throughout the presentation, you'll hear from various people including those close to him (his father & former NHL player Ted Irvine along with other childhood friends) along with WWE talent from the past (Lance Storm, Eric Bischoff, Goldberg, Roddy Piper) & present (Bret Hart, Chavo Guerrero, Rey Mysterio, Christian, Joey Styles, Dean Malenko, Arn Anderson, Edge, Matt Hardy, The Miz, Michael Hayes, John Morrison, Big Show, John Cena, Evan Bourne, Vince McMahon, Wade Barrett, Pat Patterson).

The documentary stars talking about his childhood in terms of how he was very active while getting into his two biggest passions of wrestling & music by age 12. How Jericho went to a community college while waiting to join the Hart Family training camp was discussed next before he going into about a talk he had with Jesse Ventura along with meeting Lance Storm at the training camp was talked about next. His international travels was discussed next such as going to Mexico was talked about as far as getting his nickname of ""Lionheart"" & becoming a heartthrob to the audience & being able to work various shows on a daily basis before going into his work in Germany where he worked for 42 days straight at one point. His venture into Jim Cornette's Smokey Mountain Wrestling talked about his ""Thrillseekers"" tag team with Lance Storm & how he learned the ability to cut a promo was mentioned before going into his tours of Japan were more wrestling based. His run in ECW was heavily discussed next detailing such things like how he was booked in a matches against Taz & Cactus Jack got him over with the crowd along with the importance behind his tagline of being ""the last survivor of the Hart Family Dungeon."" The story of Eric Bischoff giving him a job on the spot the first time they ever met thinking he would be one the top names for the crusierweight division begins his WCW career where his constant problems were heavily discussed like how being a ""vanilla"" babyface wrestler made his career difficult, the impact of the crusierweight division on the company, and how being turned heel was a blessing. From there, he goes into memorable moments from such as him being a ""Man Of 1,004 Holds"" & also a ""Conspiracy Victim"" before going into details about what went wrong with his storyline involving Goldberg (with comments from Goldberg himself) that convinced Jericho to leave WCW. How Jericho saw a countdown clock in a post office lead to his WWE debut before going into how he felt that he didn't live up to the hype almost 2 months later. His storyline with Chyna over the Intercontinental Championship was talked about before going into how his angle with Stephanie McMahon elevated him & beating Triple H for the WWE Championship on RAW was his breakthrough moment. Becoming the first Undisputed Champion was discussed next with people like Rey Mysterio saying that it opened up the road for smaller guys like him to become champion before going into his true thoughts on working with Stephanie leading up to WrestleMania X8 & how he felt about being the last match on the card following Hogan vs. Rock. His ability to have good matches with anyone & how he wanted his ""Highlight Reel"" to be a modern day ""Piper's Pit"" was discussed next before going into the importance of his feud with Shawn Michaels at WrestleMania XIX to the point where Jericho said that match meant more to him than winning the Undisputed title & talking about his entertaining partnership turned rivalry with Christian. Jericho's thoughts on John Cena were up next as he talked about how Cena reminds him of Austin (his words, not mine), the reaction of the crowd cheering for him over Cena, and his true feelings on the way he was ""fired"" from WWE. What Jericho did away from wrestling was talked about next before going into the concept & evolution of his rock group Fozzy along with his autobiography that became a New York Times best seller & the death of his mother. The story behind his comeback to WWE was heavily discussed with both Shawn Michaels & John Cena playing a heavy part in motivating him was talked about before going into why he felt like he had to turn heel & where elements of his character came from. Highlights & discussions his feuds against Rey Mysterio & Shawn Michaels & Edge were up next along with his involvement with Wade Barrett & NXT before closing out the documentary with Jericho's thoughts on if he really is the best at what he does & how he would want to exit wrestling.

DVD extras include bonus stories of Jericho talking about being a wrestling fanatic, his first wrestling name, being on a mexican wrestling version of ""American Idol"", calling Paul Heyman for a year to get into ECW, Christian telling a story of how everyone knew Chris Jericho in a town they were in, and Joey Styles calling a move Jericho did turned into a big inside joke between the two. Other DVD extras include various video packages from Smokey Mountain on the Thrillseekers tag team, Jericho reading his list of 1,004 holds on WCW Nitro, going to Washington D.C. to get justice for being a victim of a conspiracy theory in WCW on Nitro, his own comedic take on Goldberg's entrance on WCW Thunder, his father confronting him on WCW Thunder, a promo with The Rock where they traded insults against each other, post show moments with Steve Austin on RAW & having a verbal battle against an old man on SmackDown, a highlight package of his greatest entertaining moments, and his debut & return to WWE round out the extras.

Matches Include:
Debut Match vs. Lance T. Storm - The video quality for this match isn't real good but keep in mind that it came from a very old VHS tape (from Storm's personal collection). Both men told a great story for this being their first match with them having a mix of high flying moves & mat work like Jericho working over Storm's arm early with various armbars & armbars as the match went to a 15 minute draw but the work was so great that the fans chanted that they want more.

Alternate Commentary By: Chris Jericho & Matt Striker

Thrill Seekers vs. The Infernos - This was their Smokey Mountain Wrestling debut & nothing more than a showcase of their fast paced high flying style offense including an impressive double dropkick from the top rope.
""Smokey Mountain Wrestling"" Mar. '94

International Junior Heavyweight Championship Match vs. Ultimo Dragon - This was match from Jericho's own archives so the visual quality isn't completely clear while the japanese commentary had some audio problems at times. Jericho did lots of high flying such as a springboard dive off the top rope multiple times (which he completely missed on one occasion) & a big splash while also implementing in-ring wrestling like an impactful double arm powerbomb but Dragon brought the fight to Jericho too including stealing his top springboard dropkick at one point as this really picked up over & towards the end, there was a heavy series of close near falls with both men kicking out of impactful moves against each other resulting in a quality match from early in his career.

Alternate Commentary By: Chris Jericho & Matt Striker

vs. Cactus Jack - Stevie Richards & Blue Meanie had a moment with Cactus before the match with Jericho spoiling it causing Cactus to attack aggressively with punches & kicks to the face while Jericho used his various styles of kicks along with using Cactus' own momentum against him before Cactus was able to catch Chris & get more aggressive using the environment around him to his advantage only for Jericho to get extreme in his own right in a competitive back & forth match that had a deeper meaning behind the scenes as it since Foley helped Jericho get into ECW.
""ECW"" Mar. '96

WCW Cruiserweight Championship Match vs. Eddie Guerrero - This was a rematch from their previous Clash Of The Champions match as the crowd threw Eddie off his game early with Jericho taking advantage with quick offense causing Eddie to get aggressive with chops & uppercuts only for Jericho to not only return it right back but also using his momentum against him to keep Eddie on the mat as they traded momentum back & forth executing similar offense against each other going into series of reversals & counters with Eddie heavily focused on a specific area of the body with strikes & submissions while Jericho continued to deliver impactful offense such as back to back powerbombs & release german suplex in a very physical encounter.
WCW Fall Brawl '97
[Cheating Death, Stealing Life: The Eddie Guerrero Story]

WCW Cruiserweight Championship Match vs. Juventud Guerrera - Juventud must either win the championship or lose his mask as Jericho showed that he was heavily overconfident early allowing Juvi to execute a heavy series of offense from the springboard position along with other lucha libre influenced offense causing Jericho to attempt different tactics from his championship advantage to eventually getting more aggressive as they traded momentum with both taking it to the air along with impactful in-ring offense & countering their opponents offense into their own as this was a very impactful match that came down to one man being able to catch the other.
WCW SuperBrawl VIII '98
[Rise & Fall Of WCW]

WCW Cruiserweight Championship Match vs. Dean Malenko - This was Dean Malenko's final title opportunity against Chris Jericho with Jericho attempting to get a jump start before the bell only for Malenko to caught Jericho in mid-air as they traded momentum going through a series of roll throughs & counters delivering their trademark offense from impactful moves to submissions as it ultimately came down to one man losing his focus on winning the championship that ultimately cost him.
""WCW Nitro"" July '98

Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Kurt Angle - It should be noted that Kurt Angle came into this match also as European Champion while Chyna was in Jericho's corner with Jericho taking control early on in the match sending Angle to the floor where the match turned into a brawl with the ring post & steel steps used before going back into the ring where Angle was able to target an injured body part of Jericho's to the point where Jericho was showing signs of it hurting when executing his own offense. This was a good quality encounter but both men would go on to have better matches throughout their career against each other.
No Way Out '00
[History Of Intercontinental Championship]

vs. WWE Champion Triple H - Jericho was able to manipulate Triple H into making this a championship match before revealing that his hired the A.P.A. as insurance while Shane & Stephanie McMahon were also at ringside.  Jericho was able to stay one stay one step ahead early using Triple H's momentum against him before Triple H caught him & slowed down the pace working over Jericho with brawling tactics pushing the limits of a potential disqualification as Jericho was able to counter not only moves by Triple H but tactics attempted by the McMahon's at ringside before Triple H decided to focus his aggression on someone else that would eventually come back to haunt him with an aftermath that was never before ""seen"" in the history of WWE up to that point.
""RAW"" Apr. '00
[Best Of RAW: 15th Anniversary]

vs. WCW Champion The Rock - This match happened during the period when WWE had brought WCW and the WCW Championship was defended on WWE television. The big story behind this one was the fact that Chris Jericho had never won ""the big one"" as every single time he had a chance at a World Championship, something went wrong & he didn't win it. Both Rock & Jericho were fan favorites at this time so the crowd was heavily split between both men. This was a very physical match as it never once got boring or slow between both men as it started out as a wrestling match but got more personal as the match went on with both men countering each other's signature moves along with The Rock delivering a Rock Bottom through a table while Jericho was stealing moves like the Rock Bottom & People's Elbow. Stephanie McMahon made an appearance & accidentally assisted Jericho to use whatever ""stroke"" he had left to finally become a World Champion.
No Mercy '01
[History Of World Heavyweight Championship]

Undisputed Championship Match vs. Steve Austin - This match was setup in that Steve Austin faced & defeated Kurt Angle in the WWE Championship right before Jericho's match with The Rock over the World Championship which was joined in progress where Jericho beat The Rock with help from Mr. McMahon. The match with Austin started right afterwords with Austin going right after Jericho before Angle & Rock got involved. Austin took the fight right to the floor with both men ending up hitting the exposed floor after failed attempts of a Stunner & Walls Of Jericho on the announce table. Jericho worked over Austin's arm & shoulder with submission moves like an armbar while stealing Austin's own stunner. Things got way out of control with appearance from Vince McMahon, Ric Flair, former WCW referee Nick Patrick, and Booker T before Chris Jericho walked away with two championships & history being made.
Vengeance '01
[History Of WWE Championship]

No Disqualification Match vs. WWE Champion Hulk Hogan - Hogan was able to easily overpower Jericho early on including shoving him out of the ring to the outside causing Jericho to take shortcuts & use illegal tactics along with his trademark offense to have the momentum in his favor as they went back & forth with Hogan still relying on his power while Jericho used his speed & illegal tactics out of desperation as it took one man taking advantage of another's distractions to gain the victory here in a solid contest.
""SmackDown"" May '02
[Best Of SmackDown: 10th Anniversary]

vs. Shawn Michaels - Shawn's WrestleMania return here didn't start off well as two of this pyro guns didn't go off & were duds. Both men exchanged wrestling early on with headlocks & armlocks Shawn attempted to work over Jericho's leg with moves like a figure four while Jericho worked over his back with various moves like a vertical suplex, the Walls Of Jericho on the outside, and ramming Shawn's back into the ring post twice. Jerry Lawler made the comment that ""both men are so similar that it's almost like wrestling yourself"" which we saw apply to Jericho various times such as using Shawn's trademark moves like his flying forearm & Sweet Chin Music while Shawn pulled out some tricks of his own like the countering a suplex into a crossbody. This was definitely a quality match fitting of Shawn's reputation of ""Mr. WrestleMania.""
WrestleMania XIX
Alternate Commentary By: Chris Jericho & Matt Striker
[Shawn Michaels: My Journey; Shawn Michaels: Mr. WrestleMania]

""You're Fired"" Match vs. WWE Champion John Cena - This was the rematch from SummerSlam the previous night with the special condition that whoever lost the match would be fired from WWE with Eric Bischoff at ringside in favor of Jericho & kept getting involved throughout the match as Jericho was completely dominate here with Cena only able to brief momentum with clotheslines, punches & shoulderblocks while Jericho used dirty tactics along with whatever he could get his hands on working over Cena's back throughout the match including the Walls Of Jericho to the point where you saw this effect him when trying to deliver the FU. This was the performance from Cena that he gets heavily criticized for while Jericho was able to adjust to Cena's style of the time to make the match work.
""RAW"" Aug. '05
[John Cena's Greatest Rivalries]

vs. Intercontinental Champion Jeff Hardy - Both men came into this match very aggressive coming at each other with slaps to punches & takedowns right away to the point where the referee had to get physically involved to separate them as the intensity picked up with both men taking advantage of an opening the other left either in the ring or on the floor while either hitting some big moves like the Whisper In The Wind or Lionsault or countering them such as the Walls Of Jericho & swanton bomb. This was a very intense fast paced match between both men.
""RAW"" Mar. '08
[History Of Intercontinental Championship]

World Heavyweight Championship/Ladder Match vs. Shawn Michaels - This was a different type of ladder match than we're used to seeing...and that's a good thing. Just like their previous matches like the Unsanctioned Match at Unforgiven, this was more about each man trying to beat the hell out of each other with the ladder making moves more impactful instead of pulling off a bunch of cool looking high spots. Couple of moments to look for was when Jericho took a fall off the ladder straight to the floor that we normally see except he didn't have tables to break his fall and one hit with the ladder right in the face that resulted in one of his teeth getting knocked out. Fun match with both men (innovators of this match in their own rights) setting a different standard for a ladder match.
No Mercy '08
[The Ladder Match 2: Crash & Burn]

No Holds Barred Match vs. Intercontinental Champion Rey Mysterio - Jericho didn't do his usual entrance as he came through the crowd with words for the WWE Universe as Rey took the fight to Jericho right at the bell taking the fight to the outside using whatever he could get his hands on to beat on him before Jericho was able to neutralize him by slowing down the pace & reversing any attempt he had at momentum as they went back & forth with series of counters & pin reversals as Mysterio continued doing his trademark lucha libre offense from different areas of the ring & Jericho's own momentum against him only for Jericho to keep attempting to remove the mask & keeping him grounded throughout the encounter.
Extreme Rules '09

vs. Undertaker - It should be noted that not only was this a non-title ""champion vs. champion"" match but also the first ever singles encounter between both men despite being in WWE at the same time for over a decade.  Taker was dominate early on using his trademark offense & size advantage only for Jericho to reverse one of the holds attempting to neutralize the superior size advantage along with using dirty tactics whenever he could staying one step ahead with different counters cutting off any momentum attempted in what was a solid encounter that came down to one man catching the other in a situation he couldn't escape from.
""SmackDown!"" Nov. '09

World Championship Match vs. Edge - For those trivia fans, Edge & Jericho did have some interaction over the years in TV matches along various tag & multi-man matches but this was their first ever singles PPV match. As it was put over throughout the match, these two men knew each other so well here that they were able to reverse & counter each other's trademark moves at various times like Jericho being able to counter the spear various times into other moves like the Walls Of Jericho & even a Codebreaker while Jericho even attempted the spear only to run into a big boot. As Jericho made clear going into this match, he focused heavily on Edge's ankle including viciously stomping on it & even stealing his a move from his old ""Thrillseekers"" tag team partner Lance Storm with the half crab where he put the pressure on Edge's ankle. This wasn't a fast paced match but one that had a calculated pace that allowed them to tell a story that was constantly built over time but left you wanting more when it was over. However, the biggest highlight & memorable moment came afterwards when Edge delivered the one word that he promised would happen to Jericho at WrestleMania...""SPEAR"" and boy did he ever.
WrestleMania XXVI

In the end, the documentary is one of the best I've ever seen WWE do as far as quality goes where they covered everything possible as far as his life in & outside the ring while the matches themselves were each quality in their own right. The only thing negative I can really say on this is that because WWE waited so long to put this set out that nine of the matches on here were already released on other DVD sets as although I understand each of these matches are significant in their own to his career, it's just too many repeats for my taste hence why I can't give this a 5 star rating but this is definitely a set I would put high on your ""wish list"" & that anyone should add to their collection.",1286236800,7,20737,4.7376731301939055
4165896,5,B003Q7B7F6,"5 stars for the fact that this DVD has his actual WCW theme. Great matches and moments, plenty of early Jericho, must buy for wwe,wwf,wcw,Jericho, and wrestling fans",1285891200,,165,4.928571428571429
4165897,5,B003Q7B7F6,"I've been waiting quite some time now for Chris Jericho to come out with a documentary. I thought it was phenomenal! It covers every aspect of him as a wrestler, moving up the ranks. The commentary is wonderful as well. Definitely a must have for all those Jericho fans out there!",1285718400,,280,4.509803921568627
4165898,5,B003Q7B7F6,"Finally after all this time Jericho is given a dvd which is way overdue and very much deserved I actually got an early release of this dvd from a local store watched it over the last few days and it was fantastic. The documentary was pretty good but if you have read A Lion's Tale you will know most of the story if you are new to the story it's pretty good. Now for the matches some of these are one's that you may have or have seen but I think it is a pretty good selection even though there are no Chris Benoit matches which would have made a great addition to an already very good set. But the matches on this dvd are all great, to me at least, and this is definetly worth the money",1285632000,3,686,3.9782608695652173

4165910,5,B003Q7B7F6,This DVD is awsome Chris deserves this and his fans willlove it .The matchs are all real good matchs .From the begining to the end its all great .Chris truly is the best in the world at what he does period.,1285545600,,206,4.048780487804878
4165911,5,B003Q7B7F6,I have to say the documentary on this set is GREAT. I'm so glad jericho finally has a dvd. I recommend this to any fan of Jericho,1285545600,2,129,3.814814814814815
4165912,5,B003Q7B7F6,"The match selection is awesome, the doc should be the usual goodness. But the cover? Ow! The effects, font and layout are fine but the picture combined with said effects? Damn.

It looks like he's taking the worlds most epic dump into an Edge shaped toilet. It's a dump so intense he's gone beyond feeling and he can actually *see* it's energy, like Juliette Binoche in Kieslowski's Blue.

I guess Jericho really is the best at what he does, since no one in the history of man has ever, evvver taken a more epic dump, again!",1281484800,,524,4.447916666666667
4165913,3,B003Q7B7F6,"I agree that Chris Jericho's DVD has been long overdue and he deserves one but I think there is a problem with the match selections. Out of 18 full matches, 8 matches are already available on other DVDs. Here is the list. I wish they had put more of Jericho's earlier matches from Stampede Wrestling, Japan, ECW and WCW.

Jericho has been deserving a dvd set for years I mean I can understand them not wanting to make one a couple of years ago and with Jericho going into music.  I also see that Vince won't let their be any matches with Beniot on this set.

I knew of him in ECW, but not much about his in-ring skills or personality and this particular collection doesn't delve too deep into his ECW days. As far as WCW goes, Chris kind of coasted during the early part, but then came that glorious day when the bookers told Jericho he would turn heel & a budding star was born.

Chris really came into his own as a heel, cutting some hilarious promos--such as the infamous ""Man on 1004 Holds"" and his always hilarious personal security. Who could ever forget Ralphus? Monday Night Jericho also came into prominence during that time. It was interesting to hear Chris talk about how his days in WCW became numbered because Goldberg was reticent about putting him over & how he was disappointed about how that potential feud never came to be.

Of course, Y2J was reborn in WWE, becoming a 6-time World Champ, 9-time Intercontinental Champion & is still a relevant player in WWE today. The match selection is great as well. If you like Jericho, this collection won't disappoint.",1494201600,,1072,4.636842105263158

8402155,5,B003Q7B7F6,"As an avid reader of all three of Chris Jericho's books (they are lined up on my bookshelf in hardcover), this was a great DVD set and a fine overall introduction to Jericho and his career.

For fans of Jericho's old WCW theme song, take lion-heart: It's here in the matches. Why the WWE had to edit out his WCW theme song on the ""The Road is Jericho"" DVD set is inexplicable. The WCW theme was a generic version of Pearl Jam's ""Evenflow"", but it just so suited Jericho's silly nineties cockiness. Watching him and Ralphus stumble around backstage to the theme while searching for Goldberg is one of my favorite memories from that era.

A lot of what made Jericho great was finding the right tempo with the right opponent. Check out his epic match with Shawn Michaels from Wrestlemania XIX. Also great to seeing him feud with Eddie Guerrero, RIP. Finally, watch him rip that mask right off Rey Mysterio during the execution of his 619 signature move.
