8439448,5,B004S2XE4K,"Anything ""Elvis"" is definitely worth reading.  So interesting to learn about the ""man"" inside the greatest entertainer who ever lived.",1442275200,,134,5.7
8439449,1,B004S2XE4K,"Probably the WORST book about Elvis Presley I've read - and I've read most of them!
If you really want a good book about him, purchase the one by Jerry Scheilling - I can't remember the name of it.  But, Jerry gives such a good, detailed account about his life with Elvis...and there are not many who are much closer to Elvis than Jerry was.  Jerry also carries a lot of integrity with me - so I find his book very believable!!  But this one, Elvis: Behind the Image - is awful.",1349395200,,478,4.173913043478261
