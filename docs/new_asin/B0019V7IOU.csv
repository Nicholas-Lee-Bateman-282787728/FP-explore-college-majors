8326236,5,B0019V7IOU,"I have owned this DVD and its companion ""Green Screen Lighting"" for several years. I have loaned them out to people who were relatively new to lighting for video. The DVDs always get rave reviews like ""I finally understand what three point lighting looks like."" and ""I never knew why you would need different lights."" and ""When you can see it, its not that hard to do.""

The DVD's strong points are often visual. Sure, you can find all the information somewhere on the internet, scattered in different places in print or pictures, if you know what search questions to ask. In my case, I have been shooting amateur video and photos since the days of super beta and 120 format black and white film. I already thought I knew most of the information Carl presents. Funny, how a video explanation clarifies what you thought you knew. Particularly enlightening are the demonstrations with the model. Carl shows numerous different lights and lighting techniques so that you can actually see the difference between one lighting setup and another. It is highly instructive and should give you some great ideas.

I saw one comment that Carl didn't show all the lights side by side. I am not sure what that would accomplish. I think it would look like ripping off the roof and letting the sun shine in, not particularly useful to me. Could be to you though. Carl doesn't show that. You will just have to buy all those lights and try it.

A quick note: Don't miss the two bonuses included on the DVD. One ""Conversations with Carl"" includes thirteen topics ranging from ""What is a Gaffer?"" to ""Electricity 101"" to ""Saving the Client From Themselves"". Over 20 minutes of insights from a veteran (and he talks really fast.) The other bonus is ""Grip Kit in a Backpack"". In this bonus, Carl shows and explains what equipment he takes with him on location.

You do have to realize that this is a training video that is packed with information and you probably will have to pause it and back up in several places. Carl explains and demonstrates three point lighting, each of the three light sources and that they don't have to be individual lights, the color temperature scale and a visual of the difference between daylight and tungsten. Then he shows and explains the common lights he uses and what they are used for. He does all this in the first 5 minutes. The video is one hour and 11 minutes long. Carl gives a lot of information and talks very fast. Some things aren't defined until later in the video, i.e. gobo and eggcrate. My suggestion is to watch it on a computer so you can use your mouse to rapidly stop and replay a section you want to review. I know I had to do that a lot in the bonus section ""Grip Kit in a Back Pack"" where Carl explains what each piece is called and what it is used for. If there was one weak spot in that bonus, it was that the explanations were good but they did not include pictures of all the equipment. For instance, I know what wire strippers and a crescent wrench look like but not all people do. I wanted more visuals.

All in all, this DVD was a great purchase for someone who is not quite sure how lighting is used to the fullest advantage. If you find this DVD useful and you are thinking about doing any green screen work, check out Carl's ""Green Screen Lighting"" which is volume two of this set. He talks really fast on that DVD too.",1346371200,,3364,4.472312703583062

[...]

The editing in this video is really poor and they never do a full comparison of all the lights side by side, only one at a time, if you do get this, expect to pause and rewind a bunch just to catch the boatload of information coming at you.",1267401600,,347,4.17910447761194
