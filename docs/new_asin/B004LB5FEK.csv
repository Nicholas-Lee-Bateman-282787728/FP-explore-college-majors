4400992,2,B004LB5FEK,"This is less a swashbuckling epic than a low-budget flick to push two stars. It is a rewrite of historical fact maintaining Captain Kidd was NOT hung, but lived on to be a champion of the good guys against the bad (with Blackbeard and Anne Bonney thrown in for good measure). It should be fun. It isn't.",1398902400,,303,4.333333333333333
4400993,4,B004LB5FEK,"Crisp clean plot, no vulgar language that is appropriate for any age, minimal violence with no blood shed. Also, minimal special effects that provide a sense of how events really occurred during those times.",1398556800,,207,5.117647058823529
4400994,3,B004LB5FEK,"I enjoyed Alan Hale (he didn't need such a fake hook), Tony Dexter, and the rest of the cast. Eva Gabor was just like her character in GREEN ACRES. She is never shown doing any chores when her character is discovered as a villainess. I wanted to see her scrubbing, washing,and cooking like a 'slave girl'. She is never shown on screen doing any manual labor. In one instance she is supposed to wash the laundry,but in the next scene the clothes are on the line drying and she is still seated pouting as in the scene before. I have a season of GREEN ACRES and I don't recall seeing her do very much house work there either.",1398384000,,622,4.279661016949152
4400995,3,B004LB5FEK,"This is a good old fashioned pirate movie of the type that teenage boys enjoyed at Saturday matinees about sixty years ago. In brief, it is a pleasurable ""popcorn chomper"" which is not to be taken too seriously. Naturally it has no relationship whatsoever to actual historical events.

The only really preposterous plot element is when Captain Kidd and his trusty sidekick sail the ship by themselves! In reality this would have required a minimum of two watches of twenty men each.

Sound and video quality are decent. As noted by a previous reviewer this is a b&w print of a color movie. The color process used was an inferior (and cheaper) alternative to Technicolor, so going for a b&w version may have been a wise move.",1357084800,3,724,4.692913385826771
4400996,4,B004LB5FEK,"Quite a good film from the 1954, as pirate films go.

 Though if your expecting COLOR ,well this print is Black & White only
and 4.3.
Despite Amazon's and on the slick,its not WideScreen.

The 4.3 ratio is correct, but it should be in Color,it even says Color in the credits.
and on the DVD Slick.

 Being a Projectionist by trade,I ran this in the 50's in a SuperCinecolor print.

 Though I must say MGM have provided a nice sharp Black & White transfer.
Just don't expect Color.

Not worth $19.99 though.",1346630400,12,506,4.423913043478261

An all around fun romp.  Captain Blackbeard even has tiny bows in his beard.",1426032000,3,250,4.744186046511628
4401000,3,B004LB5FEK,"A pretty good old Pirate Movie. Of course, those oldies always had to have a love interest where the hero and his girl fell in love.",1418947200,,132,4.115384615384615
4401001,5,B004LB5FEK,It was supposed to be a color movie. Very disappointed that it was in black and white. I hope Amazon gives customers more access to movies with Anthony Dexter starring in them. Number 1 would be a good color version of Valentino made in 1951 with Anthony Dexter as Rudolph Valentino. I have loved this movie every since I first saw it way back in the sixties when I was growing up. Please make this available in color.,1415404800,3,418,4.371794871794871
4401002,3,B004LB5FEK,",,, and 3 stars is generous...ya' know, every once on a while a 'swash'buckler is just what I need on a Saturday night... well, this one is not it... it is hard to imagine how bad this movie is... but, in a rather unexpected way, it did mange to entertain, I think because it is so bad... you really have to see this one for yourself, don't take my word for it... I had to laugh at loud, at a couple of the scenes... oh well, it seems I enjoyed myself anyway... BTW, this is not supposed to be a comedy...;)",1415145600,,507,4.02970297029703

4401006,2,B004LB5FEK,"I'm surprised by another review that characterizes this film as briskly paced and Eva Gabor as providing ""sterling"" support.  Even at 82 minutes the film simply crawls -- I had to speed up the DVD playback just to get through it, and I'm a collector of swashbuckler films!
Anthony Dexter and Alan Hale, Jr. are fine, as far as they go, but Eva Gabor is simply terrible: wooden and unconvincing. Yet even if she'd had the skills of a Patricia Medina, the atrocious screenplay would still have thwarted her efforts -- it's really that bad.  Swashbucklers are, by nature, stylized, so I wasn't expecting cin&eacute;ma v&eacute;rit&eacute;, but this movie is so stilted it's simply unwatchable without a peanut gallery a la ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"".
I have more than 90 swashbuckler films on DVD and this one is so unenjoyable that it won't go on the shelf with the others. For far better pirate fare try ""Captain Blood"", ""Fortunes of Captain Blood"", ""Captain Blood Returns"", ""Anne of the Indies"", ""The Black Swan"", ""The Sea Hawk"", ""The Spanish Main"", ""Seven Seas to Calais"", ""Duel on the Mississippi"", ""The Buccaneer"", ""The Black Pirate"", ""Raiders of the Seven Seas"", or even ""Last of the Buccaneers"" and ""Pirates of Tripoli"". All of these are available on DVD and even the latter two rather-mediocre swashbucklers are far superior to ""Captain Kidd..."".  The other films listed are delightful alternatives.",1402963200,3,1409,5.03862660944206

8434079,3,B004LB5FEK,"Disappointing! I remembered this from my childhood. I haven't seen it in years. Overall not the best of it's Genre, but still a pirate movie! The disappointing part is that it is  shown in Black and White. It was in beautiful color years ago. The print quality is good. And yes, Eva Gabor can't act! But she was always just eye candy, and as such, she was good. And always good to see Alan Hale Jr. in a movie. Only three stars.",1484870400,,428,4.219512195121951
