2859548,5,B000R7HY0K,"Quentin Tarantino is back and better than ever!  Old music, 70's cars, no CGI, tip-top dialogue, and Tarantino's stylized way of directing makes this film a modern masterpiece.  Also, watch Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror, (the first half of Grindhouse).  I hope you enjoy Death Proof as much as I did!",1180915200,9,303,5.02

2859620,5,B000R7HY0K,"Death Proof (2007) is considered Quentin Tarantino's weakest film, but even Tarantino's worst is a lot of other directors' best. This film pays homage to the muscle car films of decades past, so much so that the picture is often grainy to depict the lower quality of those films. Kurt Russell stars as a stuntman who kills people with his ""death proof"" car. Supporting cast members (the young ladies in particular) sort of steal the show, with their cohesiveness, charm, and sexiness. A thrilling car chase is the highlight of this film, which seems to go on forever (but that's good). This film is a lot of fun, and the dialogue is memorable, as each actor sort of gets their turn at a one-liner. Russell is a believable villain, and really exhibits toughness, grit and gruff, but in the end, he's no match for the girls! Death Proof is a solid Tarantino offering that manages to invigorate open-minded audiences. The blu ray is solid, with some cool special features. If you're a Tarantino fan, then collect all of his films, as this one can't be ignored, despite the 'lower' ratings.",1510617600,,1086,4.721052631578948

Cons: Death Proof

The Plot

Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) seems like a nice older dude who appears to be hung up with the 1970s, a decade that when it had vanished into the 80s, so did his career as a Hollywood stuntman.  Despite the fact that he is advancing in years, he still finds time to go to the bars where young people hang out and he'll even pick up a young lady.  For instance, there was a cute blonde named Pam (Rose McGowan) who at first seemed a bit reluctant to accept the offer from Stuntman Mike for a ride home, but after chatting in the bar for a few hours with him, she decided he was trustworthy after all.  Big mistake, because once Pam was in Stuntman Mike's 1970's stunt car, she may not make it out alive.

Stuntman Mike's stunt car was reinforced for the driver of the car to make it safe no matter what kind of crashes he has to perform for the camera.  This makes the position in his stunt car's driver's seat ""death proof"".  Too bad that's not the case for Pam who is seated on a stool in the passenger seat without any seatbelts (this is so a camera could be situated here.)  Stuntman Mike gets his jollies by offing cuties with his death proof car, and he's not going to stop with Pam.

Stuntman Mike will attempt murder again in his killing machine, could he always be successful?  Won't he get caught sooner or later?  Find out when you watch Death Proof!

The Breakdown

This film is separated into two stories yet it connected by a common theme, which is the case with most Quentin Tarantino films.  The first story tries to appear very low budget, complete with bad editing, cheesy 70's theme music, ultra-grainy film, bad acting, and a horrible script.  I'm guessing that this was all intentional, but unfortunately I'm not too sure.  When the dialogue is laced with the entire trademark Quentin Tarantino one-liners you could bare to hear in this small space of time, that while you're reaching for the ipecac you get the feeling that it's not as tongue-in-cheek as it should have been.

Quentin appears to be creating here an homage to himself.  In the first story, everyone has a nickname (Reservoir Dogs), the cell-phone ring tone is the theme music from Kill Bill, we get many shots of Jungle Julia's bare feet (Pulp Fiction, and more), there are even lines and/or phrases lifted from his other movies here.  In my opinion, his indulgency is flat out annoying.  After watching the first section of this movie, it made me flash back to one month ago when I rented Harper Valley PTA, and when it was finished I stated, that was the worst movie I have ever seen.  After watching Death Proof I now have a contender for that top spot.  The first section of the movie proved to be unwatchable, not again at least, and the second section was only mildly better.

As a major Rent-head, I appreciated the use of actresses Tracie Thomas and Rosario Dawson in this part of the movie.  These two, along with true stuntwoman Zoe Bell (who plays herself) had definitely drawn more of my attention than the first hour of the movie had.  It's too bad the dialogue is ruined with Quentin Tarantino's dopey sense of humor.  He even resurrects the idiotic phrase ""N*g*ah Please"" which I was glad it died out years ago with Eddie Murphy's 48 Hours films.  The second part of this film could have saved the picture from worst-picture-ever contender, but Quentin Tarantino seems to get in his own way.  It didn't matter who the actors are in this film, they all sound like the insane ramblings of Quentin Tarantino, and it's obvious here that too much Quentin is a bad thing.

It pains me to say that, because i love most of Quentin tarantino movies.  However, this movie is just plain bad. I felt I lost 2 hours of my life that I will never get back... Wow.. you just keep waiting for something to happen, but nothing ever does. 95% of the movie is filled with women discussing their female thoughts on men.  The whole movie is talking. There is no nudity, there is no blood and guts. I could deal with that if the plot was good, but the plot sucked a big one. There is absolutly nothing here.

2859672,5,B000R7HY0K,"don't believe the un-hype: this in NOT a lesser Tarantino film. this is not just something he threw together on the side inbetween his REAL films. no, after buying this purely for the sake of completing my collection of Tarantino flicks, this has quickly become one of my very favorites. it bears rewatching extremely well, it's fun, the dialogue (of which there is much) is vintage Tarantino, and the actresses all knock it out of the park.

I like to think of this two entries in a fictional Death Proof franchise. the first half feels like ""Deathproof 1"", and has the feel of being shot in the late 70's on a shoestring budget. the second half (which thematically quotes the first half throughout, and turns elements of that part on their heads, particularly in it's delightfully cathartic finale) has the feel of having been shot about a decade later, either after they filmmakers scraped together enough cash for a second installment, or perhaps as a final entry in a longer series. it's cleaner, less grainy, a bit more polished, and tonally very different. also, both halves seem to pay particular stylistic homage to Tarantino contemporary, Richard Linklater early films (particularly Slacker).

like me, you were probably ""meh, it's okay I guess"" when you first saw it. all I can say s watch it again (and again, and again...). it will grow on you.",1492646400,5,1357,4.819742489270387

Basically it doesn't have enough action, you waited something like 45 minutes for them to hit the road and then there's a cool and bloody scene but then that act ends. The movie is basically two separate stories with the same serial killer. The second story was better because it simply didn't take as long and the dialogue although also consisting of women sitting in a bar, was a bit better and the characters a little more likable and a lot more interesting. There are some parts of act two that we never get back to, such I would have liked to have seen the farm where three of the four girls took a car from for a test drive from again.

Instead of the tedious boring bar scene, we could have had more journeys with the serial killer on wheels. We could have seen him nudging slow drivers off of winding cliff roads or something, running over people changing tyres, just a bit more action was needed.

If you watch this film for ONE thing, it should be Zoe Bell. Her car stunts are incomparable, and I have never seen anything like her before or since. Gear heads will probably appreciate this more than the average movie buff.

This movie was filmed partially in my hometown of Austin, Texas. I love the unique cinematography, and I always spot something new every time I watch the film. Just a feel good, action packed movie.",1467676800,,511,4.543478260869565

The dialogue, while not on par with Pulp Fiction.. Which everyone uses as the yardstick.. Still crackles and puts a big smile on my face! Kurt Russell is a legend, the cars are badass (though it's a bit painful to see them smashed up), the stunts are as real and authentic as possible besides the deaths obviously and the soundtrack is as good as any other Tarantino flick..

2859860,5,B000R7HY0K,"Love this movie.  What's better then watching a movie directed by the best director Hollywood has seen in the last 30-40 years.  I'll tell you what, when that movie that, that awesome director just made happens to have your favorite actor in it too. Quentin Tarantino is a filmmaker on a whole different level and ball field then any other director. The guy don't make bad movies. The two least favorite of mine Kill Bill Vol. 1 & 2 didn't do it for me but a ton of people loved them. Besides those every other movie he's made is gurenteed to be a classic. Not to mention besides directing he also is far superior to all other film makers when it comes to picking the music and soundtrack. Like this movie the soundtrack is 5 stars. With that said my favorite actor I mentioned earlier none other then the great Kurt Russell as Stuntman Mike. I could go on and on. The movie was awesome,  the whole cast was great,  and it wouldn't be a Tarantino movie w/o great dialogue. My opinion great movie and in future any movie Quentin Tarantino directs little advice if you want  to go see a movie and one of his is playing.  Go see it. You'll know you'll like it.  He hasn't made a s*** one yet and until he does then he's a no brainer choice",1461110400,2,1236,4.278969957081545

2859909,1,B000R7HY0K,"Another vanity film with extra added footage that means nothing. Tarantino has to add himself as a character in the bar scene -- totally unnecessary except to satisfy his ego. Watch how he first appears in a bar table scene -- seeming to materialize out of nowhere.

At least one of the ladies in the film is an actual stunt lady and she does perform one stunt while holding onto the hood of the car. As for her acting, it is no worse than that of the others.

Another scene with a beautiful girl in a short cheerleader's skirt (yum) facing the owner of the car that the ladies, with Kurt's help, are going to trash has no ending. We never get back to the scene to find out what happens to her.

Kurt Russell uses his stunt car as a killing tool (severing one's girl leg from the hip) and ends up in the hospital himself. No can prove anything against him since he is the only survivor. So later, he shows up in another town -- in black and white, until the scene inexplicable switches to color. Why? One girl sees himself speeding in his new killer car and remarks that he must have a little p------.  Could be.",1455148800,,1112,4.2559241706161135

2860102,5,B000R7HY0K,"I'm not sure if this is still an issue, but when this film came out it wasn't very well received. Maybe it came from people who were dying for Quentin Tarantino to flub up in the slightest way or the fact that people critical of this film didn't exactly get or care for the Grindhouse/expolitation film world. Either way, this is a great film.

The film features pretty much everything you expect from a Quentin Tarantino film. It has great dialogue, great music and memorable violence. Plus, it has actual stunts. Not some crap filmed in a studio in front of a green screen.

This is a great film worth owning and remembering. If some hipster is steering you away from it because they rather drink PBR and watch Quentin Tarantino's early work, rent this movie and judge it for yourself.",1432080000,,787,4.574468085106383

2860115,5,B000R7HY0K,"The best thing about this movie is the debut of Zoe Bell as an actress.  She's already a well-established stunt woman (she did all of Uma Thurman's stunts in the Kill Bill movies, for example) but here she essentially  plays herself so the phrase 'doing her own stunts' takes on added meaning.  And we're not talking about falling off a four-story building, we're talking about hair-raising, throat-constricting, white-knuckle car chases and smash-ups and....No, wait.  The best thing about this movie is that all of the stunts are 'real'...no CGI, no animation, no robots, nothing but great stunt people who made this movie the way movies used to be made...for real and for certain.  No, wait.  The best thing about this movie is the creation of yet another unforgettable character by Kurt Russell.  He started making his mark as far back as 1965's Guns of Diablo in which he plays a young boy, Jamie McPeeters, on a wagon train wrangled by Charles Bronson, and of course he went on from there to give us a string of heroic figures (all of which adorn my DVD shelves) from Jeff Taylor to Snake Pliskin to Jack Burton. But now comes Stuntman Mike to break the mold, raise the bar, go over the top.  This psychotic serial killer will go into my book for sure (inside joke).  No, wait.  The best part of this movie is the resurrection of a 1970 white Dodge Challenger 440.  Just like the one Barry Neuman and Cleavon Little made famous in 1971's Vanishing Point.  The Tarantino/Rodriguez/et al crew don't do nearly as much harm to this Dodge as Newman did to his but oh mama! will you not bother to count body dings along the way.  Come to think of it the best part of this movie is that it IS a Tarantino/Rodriguez/et al movie, done with all the usual care of a 'family' production.  I'm not suggesting that Quentin and Co never miss....I'm still trying to figure out what the heck Inglorious Basterds is all about...but Deathproof ranks right up there with their best.  I'd tell you to buckle up but chances are you'll find that hard to do that while you're sitting on the edge of your seat, which is exactly where you'll be for most of this movie, that is when you're not daydreaming about all the dreamy eye-candy or grinning at Michael Parks and Son doing the Greek Chorus number that bridges the two parts of the movie, or feeling great sympathy (and empathy?) with the guys who mostly fall flat on their faces as they try to...well, you know, score.  I score this movie 10.",1428537600,2,2478,4.572398190045249

Perhaps some spiffied up version like  pulp fiction or something other than (as referred to) a Rodriguez collaboration action project. I thought Death Proof was shocking, exhilarating and very FRESH as far as psycho killer movies go. Two things I remember most of all was the lap dance and of course the ending. I loved it. I saw it 3  or 4 years ago and I'm buying it today. I must make it a part of my psycho, blood and guts Tarantino /Rodriguez library thank you.",1419724800,,603,4.522935779816514

2860206,2,B000R7HY0K,"""Death Proof has got to be the worst movie I ever make."" - Quentin Tarantino. And so far, it is so. Let's get something straight, I am a serious Tarantino fan. Like M .Night Shyamalan and Robert Rodriguez, I feel any human being who writes and directs their own stuff and it kicks ass, is worth worshiping. Right? So with expected hopes and a good buzz from the whole ""double feature and 70's trailers"" coolness, I knew I was in was in for a rare treat. Then I watch Death Proof and for the first time during a Tarantino film, I found myself looking around the drive-in in boredom. (yeah I said drive-in). A lot of pointless, uninteresting dialog, that even the two girls I was with said it was ""unrealistic"" and ""awkward"" girl talk. Rodriguez's movie in the Grind House Double Feature, Planet Terror, is pretty cool, as are the 70's trailers (also including the trailer for Machete, that they made into an actual franchise.). I would suggest to all Tarantino/Rodriguez fans to buy the Grind House DVD/Bluray, so you have both movies, the cool trailers and another (not great) Tarantino movie in your collection.",1408838400,,1112,4.678571428571429

Here's the problem: The girls in the second segment just aren't nearly as cool, dark, and gritty as the gals in Austin. I could watch the first half df the movie over and over.

2860252,3,B000R7HY0K,"With ""Inglourious Basterds"", I thought that Tarantino did a fine job with allowing his narrative structure to unfold--the chapter headings were far less incongruous than they were in the overly praised ""Pulp Fiction,"" and his nostalgia for cinema (and the older army movies and exploitation classics that he loves too) was on competent display in that film. Shocking it was, then, when I encountered ""Death Proof"", an adrenaline shot of a movie that hurtles at the speed of light to nowhere, all in a rapid pace, but alternating with many elaborate scenes of talk and chatter which I (contrary to others) find to be enjoyable as opposed to being ""slow."" However, ""Death Proof"" is, in my opinion, the most violent Tarantino film, and this is not a compliment. Its foul language, its punk filming style (I kind of like the grainy, pops-and-cracks homage to 70's drive-in theater exploitation film reels, but it's a gimmick and not a necessity here), and its distasteful sense of sexuality (one scene includes a smoking hot lap-dance that seems out of place) all contribute to the film's make it or break it leanings, and, for me personally, it doesn't quite work. If it weren't so persistent in trying to be offensive, I might have enjoyed it more, but the violent sequences (while not always frequent) are pretty hard to take. I did, however, enjoy seeing Kurt Russell in this movie, it felt like a comeback of sorts (although my favorite film of his is still 1998's ""Breakdown""). It seems as if Tarantino wanted to make a girls vs. boys movie, and as such, I think it's too much of a joke that is not funny, hence my interest in the film is lessened due to this. I thought I might have enjoyed it more since other critics seem to think is Tarantino's poorest effort but, oddly enough, I think I agree in this instance. It's just too much of everything that adds up to so little in the end--which is a shame, because Tarantino is quite an interesting (if not inventive) writer and his love of cinema is genuine. Unfortunately, ""Death Proof"" is not my idea of a fun slasher/thriller flick, so I felt it did not work as well as it could have. Maybe in time I will like it more, but as of now I don't think of it as being worthwhile.
The 2-disc DVD is fine, with several fun extras, but since this is a ""throw away"" project, there's nothing terribly important to be discussed in terms of the film's story or its characters. C+",1393113600,,2422,4.595842956120093

If it achieves anything, it achieves the perfect visual marriage of boringness, stupidity, vapidness, meaninglessness and worthlessness.  So congratulations on succeeding at that.

I mean EVERYTHING about this movie stinks.  Even the ""hot girls"" in the movie are major let downs.  Bad actresses playing vapid so-annonying-you-hate-'em characters is NOT a good combination.  And the ""bad guy"" is so lame, and he's hardly in the movie at all, which I guess is a good thing.  In fact, any of the characters NOT being in this movie would have been a good thing, because they are all so unlikable and annoying.  This is just an utterly worthless movie that's NOT funny, exciting or entertaining even one tiny bit at any point.  This movie is just BORING.

I don't understand the long drawn out dialogue scenes with the characters, these scenes are 10-15 minute segments of the characters just talking about nothing.  It doesn't make you emphasize with the characters or grow attached to them.  Quentin Tarantino is a great writer and the way he writes dialogue is like eavesdropping on a real conversation but none of these conversations are interesting. The movie was a real drag until Kurt Russell starts speaking. After 40 minutes into the film, my interest was high but it goes into another lull period until the last 30 minutes.  Also, I didn't understand some of the film techniques the opening credits match a film from the 1970s, however as the film progresses it looks like a modern day film.

2860340,2,B000R7HY0K,"Kurt Russell plays a stunt man named Mike who gets his thrills by violently killing young women with his car. This car is ""death proof"" if you're sitting in the driver's seat, and allows the stunt man to mow down his victims without mortally wounding himself.

Death Proof contains some great writing and some great twists, but it's weighed down by Mr. Tarantino's excessive self indulgence in dialog and foot shots. The movie would have benefited greatly by cutting down on the chatter and focusing on driving the plot forward. And while I'm indifferent to feet, there are so many shots that focus on them that its distracting. When Stunt Man Mike licks his hand and touches one of the girl's feet, I couldn't help but think of Mr. Tarantino's fetish - I shouldn't be thinking about that while watching a movie.

Without spoiling anything, the twist and change in tone that happens in the middle of the movie is brilliant. It shakes you awake and takes you totally by surprise. Unfortunately the movie slows down again and you're left rather bored until the last 15 minutes.

Overall I cannot recommend this movie to non-Tarantino fans. The slow parts are too slow, and the good parts are too brief. Had around 20 minutes of dialog been cut and had the chatter focused more on driving the plot forward, this movie  could have been up there with Jackie Brown or Kill Bill, but as it is, it's a flawed work with some great moments. If you're a Tarantino fan this is worth a watch, but everyone else should look to other areas of his filmography first.",1363305600,,1550,4.625454545454545

2860354,4,B000R7HY0K,"I never saw a film in a 'Grindhouse.' But I did see a lot of B movies on channels 5, 9 & 11 in NJ as a kid in the 70's. Trashy biker films, zombies, blacksploitation etc. Death Proof is a tribute to those B movies. It's also yet another example from Tarantino how a singular character can drive a movie forward. In this case, the character is 'Stuntman Mike.' Not that the other characters are bad, but Mike stands out.

The film is deliberately aged giving it a worn out look. There are jumps and bad edits and parts where the sound is faulty. All of which is in keeping with old, degraded B-films.

I also like that there was very little CGI used. The stunts where all done with real cars and stuntmen/women.

Deathproof is, in my opinion, the last of the dialogue-character-driven Tarantino films. Pity Tarantino thinks it's his worst film. I would give that distinction to Inglorious Basterds.

I'd love to see 'Stuntman Bob,' in a future Tarantino film.

All in all, very entertaining.

2860360,3,B000R7HY0K,"Eight sexy young women are about to take the ride of their lives when they are stalked by a predatory stunt driver who uses his car as a weapon in Quentin Tarantino's DEATH PROOF! DEATH PROOF is trademark Tarantino: Overly long, pretentious strings of dialog that are aimed at indulging the director more so than progressing the plot. The exhausting speeches that these broads deliver never make up for the overall lack of action, and are far less amusing than the director intended them to be. This is especially true when they are coming from a collection of characters that never would possess such finely-tuned powers of articulation. Tarantino is simply setting us up for his now-expected action beats that place an exclamation point at the end of each drawn out piece of exposition. With the exception of a big-name cast, Tarantino comes far closer than Robert Rodriguez in emulating the Exploitation experience during his half of the GRINDHOUSE double-feature. He achieves a gritty realism using fast-paced and explosive car chases that have been have not been tampered with using computer enhancement, which amplifies the excitement and danger. It is in these moments that Tarantino succeeds most, creating the modern equivalent to his own personal favorites VANISHING POINT and DIRTY MARY CRAZY LARRY. It takes so long to finally get to these last-minute thrills that most of the audience has likely checked out already. DEATH PROOF does provide enough momentary satisfaction to make it worth sitting through to the end, however, and the final chase at least adds a heart racing grand finale to an otherwise dull movie.

There is also the element of his being someone who wants to be a killer, rather than someone who IS a killer by nature.

2860390,5,B000R7HY0K,"I was honestly dead set against seeing this for the past few years because for one it being attached to Robert Rodriguez's ""Planet Terror"" (which may be a good movie, but it looked like a gore-fest, and I was taking a stance against those back when ""Grindhouse"" came out), and also because of all the negative reviews I've read over the past couple of years.

However, I finally relented and let curiosity get the better of me and ordered a copy and watched it yesterday. And let me just say: WOW! WOW!! WOW!!! I fkg LOVE it! Did I say WOW?! Best movie I've seen in ages. True story!

From the opening animated credit sequence to the final frame of closing credits, this is such a breathtaking, riveting masterpiece! And there are so many iconic images from everything 1970's drive-in cinema, and includes one of the greatest soundtracks ever committed to film. Tarantino even made use of Pino Donnagio's awesome score from Brian De Palma's ""Blow Out"" (the small piano piece that plays while one of the female characters reads a text message early in the film).

Since pretty much every reviewer has mentioned the plot in pretty much every review since the movie came out, I am not gonna bore you with repeating that here. I will, however, say that I have never seen some of these actors in a better film. Ever! This is the best work from Kurt Russell since his glorious work in John Carpenter's classics, like ""Escape From New York"".

And every single female in the cast is riveting! (Excuse me if I've used that word already.) Especially Zoe Bell, playing herself. You may recognize Zoe from her stunt work being Uma Thurman's stunt double in Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"". She is simply electrifying as an actress!

Anyways, really don't know what else to say except that if you haven't already seen this movie, don't wait another minute: See. It. NOW! And I am gonna go now and watch it again (for the third time since yesterday afternoon).

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Thanks for reading! :)

But as for the Blu-Ray transfer itself...  It's hard to really pick apart the conversion of a film that was intentionally made to look like a 70s exploitation film.  Grainy film, jump cuts and scratches in the film were made to be there.  So how can you judge a Blu-Ray transfer of a film that was made to look old?  It looks just as old as it's supposed to be?  Fine.
As to the extras, there really isn't much new here to see that wasn't on the 2-disc DVD copy.  Although Mary Elizabeth Winstead's A Capella rendition of ""Baby, it's you"" is still awesome to watch, only because I crush on her no matter what she's in.

The look and feel of the film definitely has an authentic retro vibe to it. But then something changed.

(Spoilers)
After the horrific head on collision, the movie takes a different turn into a world of character over development. Too much time is spent listening in on conversation between 4 girls who seem to exist in a 1 dimensional world of pointless gossip and foul talk. The store front, restaurant, and farm scenes are all stretched out way too long for any practical purpose of story telling. I really can't imagine anyone being captivated by this (does Tarantino think this is good stuff?). Very little is seen of Kurt Russels villainous character that was so wonderfully built up in the first half of the movie. As a matter of fact, everything that was so great in the first half of the movie, was completely thrown to the wayside in the second half. Stunt man Mike is no longer the mysterious psycho we knew earlier, but a whimpering after thought who appears in the very end of the movie to get the snot kicked out of himself comic book style.

2860414,3,B000R7HY0K,"Starting with the extras which are nothing to write home about really but director Quentin Taratino gushes over his longtime editor Sally Menke. Somebody needs to tell Tarantino it's in the editing where his movies fail (and as good as Kill Bill was, it is the prime example of something in dire need of editing).

This is the entire problem with Death Proof. Visually it looks great. The music and dialogue (although these scenes go on far too long especially the ones of the women in their cars) are first-rate. Kurt Russell channels a deliciously evil version of Snake Plisken. The ""chicks"" in the flick are all first-rate although I did not really get the fully clothed lap dance which was less than sizzling and seemed like just stuck in there for no reason.

The movie seems to end after an hour then (SPOILER ALERT) we basically get the exact same movie scenario playing out again. Yes, it plays out with a different ending but what was the point of running pretty much the exact same plotline (Russell stalks women, tries to run down said women with his car, action ensues).

I was a bit surprised that the first segment ended rather abruptly and the second segment began just as abruptly. There was a surprising amount of humor and laughs, especially near the end of the film. The location filming added much, especially in such places as ""Guero's Taco Bar"" and ""The Texas Chili Parlor"" in Austin, Texas. The cars were exciting and the stuntwork top notch. Zoe Bell proved herself a capable actress in the second half of the film. I wish that lovely Mary Elizabeth Winstead had been given more to do and more screen time in the film's second segment.

2860449,5,B000R7HY0K,"A temptation some critics have with great director is to build them up only to tear them down. They often have a point as you don't want a director to get too big an ego and Tarantino does have his failings (e.g. the climactic scene in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Bill-2/dp/B0002849JI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Bill 2</a>).
However, what once a director has been knocked off his pedestal, critics then see everything else he does through a lens of failure.

This film, although not as vivid and brilliant as Pulp Fiction or Jackie Brown is still a good film with enough decent dialogue and plot to make for very entertaining viewing. And as a homage to road movies such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vanishing-Point/dp/B0000695JO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vanishing Point</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bullitt/dp/B000803PRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bullitt</a>&nbsp;it succeeds in having both good car chase sequences AND a good plot to go with it.

So, if you're dreading that this film is going to a lemon and think that it should be overlooked, then do remember that Tarantino is still a first class director and is much more worthy of your time than the works of 90% of the other movies out there.

But this is ""Grindhouse"", not an English art film. There needs to be lots of mega-action and a rational limit on dialog, especially sprawling, philosophical, who cares what you think, rambling talk.

2860474,2,B000R7HY0K,"Although I think Quentin Tarantino is an overrated filmmaker, most of his films, even some of his weaker efforts, have some interesting things in and going for them. I'd say the ""first half"" of his career is way superior to the ""second half"". The first half starts with RESERVOIR DOGS, a very unique and groundbreaking film, immediately followed by and improved upon in the stellar and engrossing PULP FICTION, and then culminating with KILL BILL VOLUME ONE, which I think is Tarantino's best film. I think VOLUME TWO is where he began to show signs of decline, but this film, DEATH PROOF, is really the ""proof"" (pun intended!) that he was spiraling downward as a good filmmaker!

The thing is, though, as bad as I think DEATH PROOF is, I think his most recent INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS is just as bad and perhaps even worse! And I know there are a LOT of people that do not think this. But here's part of my reasoning...DEATH PROOF at the very least has what I think can be called an actual ""plot"" and additionally, unlike INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, DEATH PROOF actually has a true central character that the viewer can latch onto, aka, Stuntman Mike (played wonderfully by Kurt Russell, who is woefully trapped in this weak film). The ONLY reason that DEATH PROOF gets the extra star is because of Stuntman Mike! HE is an interesting character. Russell conveys his creepiness effectively and gives one of the very few REAL performances in the film. I think Russell is just as good in DP as Christoph Waltz was in IB, but Waltz was considered to be in the better film, so his performance got more praise and accolades, while Russell was stuck in a film that was both critically and financially unsuccessful. Waltz's character Landa in IB, although a standout, was not really the central character that drove the story; Tarantino didn't have one! So one common thread of DP and IB is that both films have a single great character in the midst of a sea of lesser characters; the other common thread is that both films have endless, go-nowhere, empty dialogue being quoted mostly by Tarantino pupils.

In addition to Russell, honorable mention should also go to Vanessa Ferlito, who authentically plays Butterfly, and Rose McGowan, who, aside from being stuck in a terrible blond wig, gives a good performance. But the rest of the female characters in DEATH PROOF range from being annoyingly nonessential (Jordan Ladd, Mary Elizabeth Winstead) to just plain ANNOYING (Rosario Dawson, Zoe Bell, Sydney Tamii Poitier, Tracie Thoms)! They are cardboard cutout characters that are simply there to quote Tarantino-esque dialogue. The first set of girls (Ferlito, Poitier, Ladd) are definitely more interesting than the second set (Dawson, Bell, Thoms, Winstead) simply because we can latch onto Ferlito's Butterfly through the first hour to keep us intrigued by what's to happen when Stuntman Mike arrives, when things actually get interesting. Sadly, Ferlito's character gets diluted somewhat by the very weak characters played by Poitier and Ladd, neither of whom are interesting in the least! Poitier's character talks too much and Ladd's character is just there.

But then here is where I think Tarantino really screws up b/c instead of going the direction of delving deeper into Stuntman Mike's story and connection to the first set of girls, he shifts the focus to the second group, NONE of whom have any interesting traits or qualities. All they do is just ramble on about nonsense (difference between Aussies and New Zealanders) and do nonsensical things, like randomly drive through the backwoods of Tennessee and just HAPPEN to run across a guy with a Dodge Challenger in pristine condition just to set up the climax! The second hour is a total, unwatchable snoozefest that drowns DEATH PROOF! I know I said that DP has a plot and it does and it is simple...Stuntman Mike! He's the driving force of the story and Tarantino SHOULD have kept the focus on him and the somewhat interesting first story. I still think DP would have suffered from some of the amateurish acting by a couple of the first set of principal characters, but at least the movie as a whole would have been a lot better!

DEATH PROOF is the beginning of Tarantino showing signs of being nothing but a gimmick filmmaker who over-borrows from older movies and genres, including his own!",1278892800,,4345,4.875507442489851

2860476,5,B000R7HY0K,"MOVIE:
""Death Proof"" - part two of the Rodriguez/Tarantino ""Grindhouse"" feature - is, simply put, a darn good time. The movie pays homage to both horror films and car flicks from the 60s & 70s, and it does so quite well. If you were a fan of ""Vanishing Point"", ""Bullet"", ""Dirty Mary Crazy Larry"", etc. then you'll love Tarantino's take on mean cars being driven at high speeds. The movie may start off a bit slow for some of today's audience, but if you're more of a fan of getting to know and love the characters then you likely won't even notice. After about the 20 minute mark you'll be sucked in and by the last 30 minutes you'll pretty much only be sitting on the edge of your seat.

BLU RAY:
The ""Death Proof"" master was purposefully scratched and beat up, which does an excellent job of imparting the feeling that you're really watching an old car movie. You can tell the video quality wants to shine through, however, and I think the Blu Ray version is definitely worth picking up over the DVD. Even though the film is scratched, you never see any aliasing or video artifacts that would suggest a sub-par transfer. The movie looks exactly as it should. Now, ""Part 2"" of the movie (no further detail given to avoid spoilers) is where the Blu Ray quality really gets a chance to shine. The scratches go away and the film is presented in greyscale as the setting is transitioned. Then, almost abruptly, the film switches to full, gorgeous (blemish-free) color. The contrast to the panchromatic footage is astounding. Rich colors fill the screen and stay for the remainder of the movie.

Overall, a great film for anyone looking for a tense-but-not-too-serious Saturday night special. Definitely recommended.",1277337600,6,1712,4.703333333333333

2860479,5,B000R7HY0K,"The key to understanding Tarantino is that he rarely, if ever, has an original bone in his body when he's having fun.  In Kill Bill he uses a great deal of Ennio Morricone music, why? Because he likes his music.  He could have just as easily had a composer write something new for him, but having done original and great films like Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, he became a little more relaxed.  Grindhouse was made by both him and Rodriguez because they wanted to homage all of the horror type movies they enjoy.  Death Proof is Tarantino without the effort to be serious, he is simply having a good time.  He does throw backs to some of his movies and references dozens of his personal favorites.  I for one, am pleased to see that a director can simply have a fun time doing what he loves to do, the film people don't always have to be so hardcore and intense with their work, they deserve a break.  Having said that, I will admit I have a sort of bias to Death Proof, mainly b/c I like horror movies a lot, and I enjoy a really good car chase or two, and in all honesty who doesn't.  This movie is NOT a high point in Tarantino's career as a writer and director, but it is still enjoyable.  You have a bunch of hot babes who can deliver their lines well and with guts, you have Kurt Russell enjoying himself to an almost disturbing degree, you have Tarantino's trademark dialogue, you have rough scratches on the screen to emulate classic grindhouse flicks, you have camerawork and set design that references the color schemes and techniques of Argento and de Palma, and you have one of the most intense, enjoyable, exciting, and awesome car chases in recent years.

2860499,3,B000R7HY0K,"Death Proof and the Grindhouse Double-Feature are of course Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriquez's tribute to the junk films that used to be played in exploitation theaters through the 60s and 70s.  For once Tarantino actually decides that he's going to stick to one cinematic style from beginning to end of the film.  Tarantino decides that with Death Proof he will PERFECTLY imitate the feel of these trash movies.  Boy does Tarantino succeed at doing just that.  In fact he does it so well that it becomes the movie's central problem!  I know it sounds contradictory for me to complain about his lack of directorial focus only to instantly complain about how he sticks to a single style during Death Proof.  Just hear me out before you come to any conclusions.

The frames are damaged, full of grain, becoming dead on imitations of junk films both visually and thematically.  Both Tarantino's Death Proof and Robert Rodriquez's Planet Terror (the other feature from Grindhouse) use this style...One key difference.  Planet Terror is so over the top that it becomes a BLAST; not a perfect or even a good film, but certainly deserving of a 7/10 star rating simply for its entertainment value.  Death Proof on the other hand is very down to earth in its premise and without many exaggerated stylistic choices just becomes what it set out to be: a trashy, boring film.

As a story it is generic (as it should be) following a group of girls stalked by a man named ""Stuntman Mike"" (Kurt Russell) who drives a ""death proof"" retired stunt car.  He stalks them, kills them with his car, then skips state to repeat the process elsewhere.  He is a fun character speaking in a pleasant Southern drawl, passing himself off as a nice guy.  Too bad he has little screen time compared to our three female protagonists who are boring as can be.  I kept checking the clock wondering how long it would take these bimbos to become street pizza!  After a bar sequence that seems to go on forever (where I have to admit, Tarantino's cameo as the manager is the second most entertaining aspect of this film right after Kurt Russell)

I have to admit the stunts in this film really are remarkable.  Stuntman Mike isn't joking about his set of wheels given that all the chases in this film are for real.  When he talks about what a shame it is to have lost the old time values of using real cars and stuntmen over CGI crashes it really shows.  Nothing can top the thrill of seeing real vehicles getting, smashed, slammed, and creating mayhem.  No computer program can compare to live action.

After a thrilling stunt where Stuntman Mike kills a group of girls through a straight on collision (while Tarantino delivers the promised Grindhouse style gore) we are greeted to a cameo from by the cops from Kill Bill before moving on to the second act.  This is where things really begin to fall apart.  For the most part the second half seems a poor excuse to show off Tarantino's lead Kill Bill stuntwoman Zo Bell's skill as she hangs for dear life on the hood of a car during a chase.

Like Kill Bill, Vol. 2 the second half of this film is so different than the first that it seems to be something entirely different.  Stuntman Mike who is an intimidating, soft-spoken stalker in the first half suddenly becomes an obnoxious over actor.  Now I have no problem, because Kurt Russell hamming it up certainly was amusing for awhile, but it was very out of place given how calm his character was during the first half of the film.  Over the top or serious Tarantino, you have to choose one or the other and stick with it!

Speaking of the acting it really is a wonder as Tarantino, to preserve the concept of this being a junk film intentionally baits the cast to do stupid, amateur stunts such as looking directly into the camera for entire scenes at a time, breaking the fourth wall, and just being general hams.  Nothing can be much funnier than a truly awful movie, but the film actually had to be completely unaware of how bad it is.  Death Proof it is clearly intentional, and though this might be amusing when a viewer first notices these quirks, the gag soon loses charm and just becomes annoying.  When you see bad films you want to see a bad film.  You don't want to see an obviously smart director and actors being led to intentionally look bad.  They aren't over the top (until the final ten minutes or so of the movie) so they're just boring.

Another problem is the script.  Tarantino is not a great director on a visual level seeing as most of the time he replicates the styles of great directors.  What has always set Tarantino apart as an artist is his engaging dialogue.  That's where Grindhouse is a disappointment of colossal proportions.  There is very little action in Death Proof, which is good seeing as Tarantino isn't that good with action scenes, but the dialogue in the film is just...boring.  It's as real as it gets.  No, seriously: the dialogue in this film is as entertaining as stalking an actual troop of girls.  Only good dialogue comes from Kurt Russell during the first half, but then Tarantino butchers the appeal of that character in the second act.  If you're not enjoying the dialogue of a Tarantino film it means something is going horribly wrong.

So congratulations to Mister Tarantino for successfully making the junk film he set out to make.  No doubt this was an entertaining thing for him as a director, but as an audience member I was often bored with this film.  The action is fun, but the final car chase goes on for far too long, but worse is that Tarantino's dialogue in Death Proof is just bland.  There is nothing really working for this film.  It could have been far better if Tarantino had made this a more exaggerated homage because as it is it's no different than the bad films it tries to poke fun at.  Planet Terror managed to give that bad movie feel while taking its premise to such absurdity that it was hard not to be entertained by it.  Death Proof on the other hand is so serious about being ""bad"" that it becomes just that.

My Rating: 5/10 Stars
My Verdict: While possessing some of Quentin Tarantino's strengths, Death Proof ultimately succeeds in becoming EXACTLY what it set out to homage and parody; due to knowing that was Tarantino's intention Death Proof ultimately loses the fun of an actual bad movie.  As a viewer I can only hope that from this point on Tarantino can try to focus more on creating his own (very successful, mind you) genre of films.  I'd like to see him make an actual full-fledged western in the style of Sergio Leone - maybe even con Clint Eastwood to cameo, but he needs to steer away from making ""intentionally bad films"".  Leave trash to the trash directors because fake-trash just doesn't have the same appeal.",1265846400,4,6787,4.579121789560895

2860503,5,B000R7HY0K,"First off, I skimmed the 1-star reviews to see what all the bitching was about- it seems people are complaining about the two movies (Planet Terror and Deathproof) being split off into separate releases, and the subsequent loss of the fake trailers from the original double feature theatrical release. Boohoo! Hey, if you were a filmmaker, you'd split a double feature in half for the dvd release too- you make more money that way- and it is show 'business', right?

So a 1-star movie that attacks the dvd release's format and doesn't address the film itself is useless.

""Deathproof"" is an outstanding movie and another excellent entry into Quentin T's body of work. Interesting and quirky characters, dialogue and relationships that draw you in and make you curious- and when Rose McGowan's character gets in Stuntman Mike's car for a ride home, it is a deliberate 'don't go in the basement!' moment worthy of the goriest slasher flick. The car chase sequences are some of the best you'll ever see on screen, as 3 girls in a 1970 Dodge Challenger hunt down Stuntman Mike with maniacal joy.

Since ""Kill Bill"" I fell in love with QT and his style of film making, and that alone would have convinced me to sit for 3 hours to watch this. I had no idea what exploitation films were or are and that's what I love about QT.  He uses elements in his films that show people like me who are not movie buffs other styles of filmmaking and movies. Therefore, You admire a new branch of films and filmmaking you didn't know was out there. Everything was in this movie great dialogue, music, suspense, actors and there is very little I didn't enjoy.  I knew all the long conversation would lead up to something I wasn't expecting and boy was I right.  The car chase in the second half was also exciting and it has a very different turn out from the first half (it seems Mike is more a pussy cat than a lion as he portrayed previously)  I learned a lesson from this to always follow my instinct regarding what films I choose to watch.  The media is so obsessed with Jennifer Aniston, JLo, Britney crap that, that is all they talk about.  There was no buzz over this film and thus my interest went from 10 to 0.  I'm sure Britney was drunk driving again when this came out so the focus was on her, or maybe Jennifer Aniston was getting dumped again for the 100th time. All I have to say is watch this with an open mind because it is a very interesting and entertaining film.  The fact that I'm still thinking about the film 2 days later and looking info about it online says a lot.

2860520,4,B000R7HY0K,"As I'm sure you already know, Death Proof originally served as the second half of Grindhouse and this DVD edition is an extended cut of that version. Written, directed, and photographed by Quentin Tarantino, Death Proof is a loving homage to 1970s exploitation/grindhouse cinema, not just in story but in style as well. As the film begins, we're treated to an intentionally scratched and poorly edited print...It all adds to the fun of the experience.

Initially, we meet three young women (Sydney Tamiia Poitier, Vanessa Ferlito, and Jordan Ladd) whom we'll follow for about the first 50 minutes of the movie. This serves as the set-up, also introducing Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell), the diabolical antagonist.

Grindhouse fans may be pleased to know that the ""Missing Reel"" has been restored and we see Arlene (Ferlito, who looks like a low-rent Angelina Jolie) giving Stuntman Mike his lapdance.

Death Proof does hit a roadblock relatively early on. Tarantino generally has a deep affection for his characters, as if his characters are his friends. However, this initial group of girls doesn't seem to have that affection. They seem less like friends than annoying acquaintances one only mildly enjoys hanging out with. That's probably why they're gone less than an hour into the movie.

14 months after meeting the initial girls, we meet four different girls; it's at this point that the scratches and other grindhouse elements disappear, along with the original tone established for the movie. The four new girls also seem to have Tarantino's affection. The characters are fun to watch and real-life stuntwoman Zoe Bell (playing herself) has a charming screen presence.

Beyond all the grindhouse elements, Tarantino also takes some time to reference his own films and Italian giallo films. It would be easy to argue that Death Proof seems more like a loosely strung-together homage than a fully-realized story...But rather than focus on that, it's a lot more fun if you just sit back and enjoy the ride.

Furthermore, Stuntman Mike is a memorable antagonist and Kurt Russell is delightfully charming and sinister. It's nice to see him taking a break from his recent family-friendly fare.

A lot of people have found Death Proof disappointing and, they're right, this is not a masterpiece. It wasn't meant to be though and this should not be overlooked. Finally, some have seen the ending as an anticlimax...But how else could this film have ended? An epilogue would not have been necessary. What one has to look at here is that Tarantino's loving homage does rise above it's influences. It is pretty good and it made me nostalgic for 1970s grindhouse movies, despite the fact that I wasn't alive in the 1970s. With it's faults, Death Proof is a good, exciting, and entertaining movie, inspired by movies that were never considered particularly good...That's an achievement in itself.

Apparently he was trying to adapt his famous  conversation scenes to women but they just sound like male gab fests.  The action is non existent except for 2 car crashes. The plot is non existent. Half way through the movie the four female leads are killed and Tarantino replaces them with four more and we don't care about any of them.  Kurt Russell is wasted.  He is neither menacing or funny.  Even the  lap dance scene is contrived and boring. Shame on Tarantino for making this indulgent drivel.  I hope he returns to his artistic senses with his next film.

The results for Rodriguez's Planet Terror were basically as usual, maybe a little better, but the unfortunate thing For Tarantino was that his part, which is Death Proof, was so bad it actually made Planet Terror seem like a classic. Yes, being a big Tarantino fan who has enjoyed every single film he has made up until this point, it was something of the unexpected but frankly speaking, Death Proof was so darn boring. Usually the long dialogue is a major part of where his movies shine but here, it's just plain stupid nonsense going on forever, it's not interesting at all. And at the very very end, like for 20 minutes or so we get this chase scene which doesn't come near as close to covering up for the lame hour long crap we had to endure up until then. The people who have enjoyed this movie I believe are only the people who were able to enjoy the long dialogue scenes which in my opinon was not the same case compared to previous Tarantino classics. The dialogue scenes were so bad, I really had a hard time staying awake and that wasn't because I was in bad shape when viewing this, actually quite the opposite so that should give you an idea of how bad this movie is. I recall that this Grindhouse double feature totally flopped at the theaters and those who have seen this all know why it did so bad.

2860539,4,B000R7HY0K,"'Stalk And Crash' might describe this half of the 2007 Grind House double bill, in which the deranged 'Stuntman Mike' (brilliantly played by Kurt Russell) targets and kills young women by running them over with his custom-built high-speed automobile.  It's as bizarre and over-the-top as the Grind House duology aimed to be, sometimes almost surreally so, and it achieves a successful blend of the horror thriller and the 'fast cars and open road' action movie.

  Death Proof is told in two halves, taking place about eighteen months apart I believe, but in the first half it almost appears to be taking place in the 1970s (the decade the movie takes most of its inspiration from) despite the prescence of modern devices such as cell phones, and the film quality is scratched up and sometimes hazy, sometimes cutting out altogether, as if it's trying to achieve the look of a film reel that's been making its rounds from theater to theater from 1972 straight through to the modern day and has taken a pounding along the way.  The second half, which has a much more modern feel and a clean, well-produced look, juts out in stark contrast, as if a sequel to the original half was filmed ages later on a bigger budget.  Oddly enough, it works.  Both halves follow Russell's psychopath character as he targets different groups of girls for death on the road, but in one half it quickly becomes apparant that Stuntman Mike may have selected the wrong group of 'victims'.  Great casting all around (including one of my personal favorite actresses, Mary Elizabeth Winstead), great use of music, terrific action sequences, great dialogue, a sharp wit,and a wickedly sexy vibe during much of the movie, make this one a real winner and the strongest of the two Grind House features (although Planet Terror was pretty good too).  Biggest complaint - between both features, we still don't get all of the fake trailers that were included in the theatrical release (although at least we get 'Machete' with Danny Trejo, which should Definately be made into a full-length movie).",1240704000,2,2064,4.8742857142857146

2860551,5,B000R7HY0K,"Actual movie:

Death Proof seems hit or miss for some people. Most of the people who tell me that they don't like it complain that there's too much dialogue, but there are three reasons for this: 1. It makes the crash scene that much better of a payoff. 2. Tarantino meant this to be like a true grindhouse movie, and in those types of movies there was a lot of useless dialogue because they didn't have a big budget so much of the movie was dialogue to fill up running time to make it a feature length film. In this aspect, I felt he stayed very true to form but a lot of people wouldn't get this. 3. Even if there is a lot of dialogue, it's all really interesting dialogue. Kind of like the book Catcher in the Rye. It isn't really about anything but it's still a good read because the way it's written is so interesting.

Picture Quality:

Now when you hear about something like Death Proof on blu-ray, you might immediately think it's pointless because the whole point of the movie was to look ""bad"". The film was purposely meant to look like it was played too many times. Scratches everywhere, film spliced all over the place. I will still say the first half of the film benefits really well from the high def treatment. It looks kind of soft but the colors recieve a great boost. But where the movie truly shines is the second half with the second group of girls. I don't know if most people who have seen Death Proof bothered to notice how the film style changes drastically in the second half because they were so into the movie at the time, but it no longer has the ""grindhouse"" look after the movie switches to Lebanon, Tennessee. I will just say the second half of the movie on blu-ray makes the movie worth the purchase. It's gorgeous. Colors are splendid, and the images are razor sharp. I think the high point for me was a close up of Rosario Dawson in the car where she finally starts to smile while Zoey is tied to the hood of the car that just hits with a ""BLEEM!"" I can't describe it. It was just a  ""BLEEM!"" that resonated. The second half of this movie is like running naked through the rain. It's like drinking an ice cold beer while having a hot shower after a long, sh***y day at work.

The girls, Arlene, Shana and Julia (Vanessa Ferlito, Jordan Ladd, Sydney Tamiia Poitier) are out for a drive in Austin, Texas. They all talk with an attitude and gab about their men and sex. Everytime they see a ""Jungle Julia"" billboard they break out in exclamation. It so happens to be publicity for Julia who is a popular radio DJ in town. They are headed to their favorite tavern to meet the ""boys"".
  There is a mysterious person in a black car that follows Arlene. She later discovers the same car at the tavern.
  The girls wait in the tavern for their men, meanwhile Stuntmen Mike (Kurt Russell) is being verbally seduced by Pam (Rose McGowan) at the bar.
  The rain is pouring hard and everyone just yaps while Mike gets to know one of the girls a little better and even gets a dance out of it.
  Mike has some plans of his own for Pam and takes her for a drive in his ""Death Proof"" car.

2860595,5,B000R7HY0K,"Admittedly, Quentin Tarantino can be irritating. He's a weak-jawed geek who believes his own press clippings (and thinks he's tough guy because he makes action flicks). And he's also a screamer - an actor who can't stop shouting on screen.

But I've never met him, so maybe I'm being presumptive.

Because whether Tarantino is a jackass doesn't matter. The man makes dynamite movies - from ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992) to ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994). He makes those guilty pleasure flicks filled with great lines, fast action, and superb acting. As a director he yanks the gusto out of his actors. John Travolta should send him Christmas cards for saving his career.

That brings us to ""Grindhouse"" (2007).

All the credit can't go to Tarantino, of course, as he co-directed ""Grindhouse"" with the talented Robert Rodriguez. But the movie is an achievement of writing, directing, and acting.

The concept is brilliant - a throwback to the 1970s drive-in B-movies (called grindhouses in the industry). The movie meshes two exploitation classics: a serial killer revenge flick and a zombie splatter fest. Sprinkle in some pop references and ironic dialog with a dash of dark humor and you've got a roller coaster ride of a movie.

The movie looks like a film pulled out of a rusty canister - complete with missing reels and burnt celluloid. There are fake trailers for movies with names like ""Machete"" and ""Werewolf Women of the SS.""

But the movie flopped. It brought in a meager $25 million and cost more than double that to make. There was just too much going on in ""Grindhouse."" For 191 minutes there were the two movies, the trailers, and an intermission. It was a glorious effort - but it was just asking too much of the viewer.

But all that's been fixed with the DVD release of Tarantino's ""Death Proof"" and Rodriguez's ""Planet Terror."" Rather than sawed-off versions - we get full length features. Both movies are better off longer.

Death Proof

""Death Proof"" is the best Kurt Russell movie in long time - one where he gets his Snake Plisskin mojo back. He plays Stuntman Mike, a charming viper of a misogynist serial killer. Stuntman Mike - gored face and all - has a black ""death proof"" car with a cage inside it. He likes to put women in the cage and then drive really fast, braking, and cornering until he's basically turned his female passengers into hamburger.

This snippet of dialog sings:

  Mike: Well, Pam, which way are you going, left or right?
  Pam: Right.
  Mike: Oh, that's too bad.
  Pam: Why?
  Mike: Because it was a 50-50 shot on whether you'd be going left or right. You see we're both going left. You could have just as easily been going left, too. And if that was the case, it would have been a while before you started getting scared. But since you're going the other way, I'm afraid you're going have to start getting scared - immediately.

Stuntman Mike then proceeds to give Pam a ride she'll never forget (or, in fact, survive). ""Death Proof"" is actually two movies. The first half is about how Stuntman Mike stalks, charms, and then murders a group of four female friends.

The next half he's up to his old tricks with another group of four women. But two of these women are Hollywood stunt drivers - and they know how to fight (and drive) back. The ending is worthy of any revenge flick in existence.

But what makes the film work? Character and dialog. Two things that were given short shift in the original version.

Planet Terror

""Planet Terror"" is Rodriguez's homage to the gore-infused horror movie. The plot is secondary (it has something to do with a chemical being unleashed and turning the innocent into flesh-eating zombies). There're lots and lots of blood - and black humor (Jeff Fahey as a barbeque chef is outrageous).

Rodriguez shines with the small moments - the love scene between the protagonists (Freddie Rodriguez and Rose McGowan) is a high in low-brow. McGowan's character has had her leg severed and a broom handle shoved into her stump as a replacement. Ridiculous camp at it's best.

Then there's Bruce Willis in a self-parody. There's Freddy Rodriguez mounting a mini-motor scooter as he zips down the highway firing bullets into the heads of zombies. There's Tarantino himself (shouting per usual) playing to type as a rapist thug.

But most of all there's energy. The throttle is open wide and ""Planet Terror"" doesn't stop.

So while ""Grindhouse"" had its challenges as one movie - do yourself a favor and get both these DVDs for a true grindhouse double feature.

Its a parody of the kind of B-grade movies commonly shown in drive-in theaters during the late 60's to early 70's. Such theaters were known as Grindhouse. This movie goes out of its way to give you that authentic old-B-grade-movies-from-60's feel and look. Death Proof's beginning is very boring but necessary.

As a woman, whos been through a bit.. I LOVED IT!!!!!
The begining made me wonder what I was in for but the character that Kurt Plays is ... hard to pin down. It is another side of Kurt Russell we have NOT seen before. VERY convincing and really realistic.

I just want to add to all these comments that there are characters from both Pulp Fiction AND KILL BILL in this movie... lol.
NO NOT JUST THE ACTORS.. the characters. If you are a fan of those movies and know even the small part players, you will recognize them once you go through it a few times.. or maybe just watching it once again tonite.. and that really gave me a laugh.
To put it together, this movie seems to be set somewhere after pulpfiction and before kill bill.. as far as stories PF would be story one Death proof story two and kill bill story 3.. LOL.
Only Quentin would slam us with that strangeness.....
Here is a giveaway... The man that one girl stays with when they steal the hot car? Take a look at him. He is also the hospital night guard.. SAME PERSONALITY and same just sick out look on women lol.
Yes we all know Beatix (the bride) Kills him by slamming his head into a doorway.. lol.. and we all know that his car is the pussywagon.. but he also has a few other hot cars apparently.. and one of them is about to get stolen by these girls in death proof.  I loved that little segment.
There are more though!!! You just have to find them.

The 70's look but still Modern 2008 type atmosphere makes you wonder where the heck you are. But its true.. we do repeat fashions and attitudes from the past.. we have all through the 90's and now.. that little addition made me laugh.
The ladies have a modern attitude on things and are a bit cocky at times, but it does show WHO would be a survivor and who may NOT.

2860607,5,B000R7HY0K,"I didn't actually get the chance to see ""Death Proof"" in theatres, though it escapes me as to why...Anyway, I first saw this on DVD.  A friend of mine demanded that I see it, and since I'm a Tarantino fan, found this to be no hardship.

I think part of the problem why some people rated it so low is that most are all about the action--instant gratification, loves a drive thru and not a sit down at dinner type of person.  This movie, though slow, is full of some of the most realistic and witty conversation I've ever heard in film or television.  But no need to worry, gentle readers.  The ending made me want to leap out of my chair and pump my fist in the air.  The payoff is *extraordinary*, and it is one of my favorites of all time.  And that is a damn hard list to get on.

Simply put, it is top notch.  It takes a brilliant bastard to draw it out like that, and I don't think anyone else would have been capable of pulling off such a feat other than Mr. Tarantino.  He is truly talented, and this film, by the way, was rated high marks by certain well known critics (Ebert & Roeper--I agree with most of their assessments of a film).",1219190400,,1143,4.131221719457014
2860608,3,B000R7HY0K,"Another B movie Drive-In Theater Grindhouse production. I enjoyed Kurt Russell and the rest the cast in this fun 70s style horror emulating many of the movies back then like Death Race 2000 made in 1975. Although I didn't find this quite as entertaining as Grindhouse Planet Terror, I still think it is worth at least a rental and for this low low price for this two disc set I went ahead and bought a copy. Russell plays a heartless stunt driver bent on killing women. Unfortunately for him he runs across the wrong group of ladies that want some payback. The dialogue isn't as good as ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Kill Bill"" so characters aren't as appealing. That and the cast isn't as impressive as Planet Terror. You may find yourself distracted so try and hang in there for the action sequences. Afterall I don't know about you but I saw the real movies like this in the 70s and they weren't all that gripping all the entire time and during those slow moments we got popcorn and sodas. Good quality DVD with some replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""Planet Terror"", ""Kill Bill"", and ""Sin City"". - C. Luster",1218412800,2,1108,4.545
2860609,4,B000R7HY0K,"It's true; Death Proof starts out a bit slow.  Don't quit on Tarantino, however, because he eventually delivers.  If you've enjoyed his past works, stick around for the ride and you will be pleasantly entertained.

On one hand, this movie is ground-breakingly original.  It's a seamless blend of various genres, with great camera work and character development, and an homage to old fashioned movie-making that is so devoted as to foregoing various modern film-making advances - so much so that the entire film is full of cigarette burns, screen flickers, and color changes that accentuate the action and overall tone being conveyed.  On the other hand, it's an effort in exaggeration, with nearly everything on-screen coming across as a bit forced; it's almost like Tarantino is following his own script at this point, attempting to live up to his own hype.  What has made him famous is the originality and unique style, but it's as if he's trying desperately to repeat everything he's done for his fans previously.  And in the end, it's PERFECT.

With that said, it's quintessential Tarantino, from the ingenious dialogue (aside from the overuse of profanity) and random movie inserts (Big Red!) to the quirky, close-up angles and the ubiquitous foot fetish scenes.  Appreciate the yin and yang of the long character buildups because they get totally flipped upside down when least expected.  Relish in the shocks, because they're sudden, and you won't see them coming.  In my favorite part of the movie there's an absolutely epic car crash scene in which four different characters meet their demise, and the scene is replayed four times just to show how each dies tragically - and as a side note, when spinning tire meets face, tire wins.

The summary of the movie is essentially Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell), finding, stalking, and murdering groups of young, attractive women, by driving directly through them in a moment of carnage from which he narrowly escapes alive because of his death proof stunt-car.  Stuntman Mike is sadistic to the point of psychosis, taunting the women as he toys with their lives; and in each altercation, the end result is meaningless, no matter who dies the audience wins.  Typically, he gets the better of each encounter, but when he runs into a daredevil group of professional stuntwomen his luck changes.

Making a great cameo reappearance alongside the cock-eyed, initial victim of Beatrix Kiddo's string of revenge murders in Kill Bill is the father-son cowboy cop combo who investigated the wedding day massacre.  They work their way through the first Stuntman Mike situation in the same clever, humorous manner as they did the chapel.  They provide a wonderful addition that, like the entire movie overall, is like dessert: it's often unnecessary, and you usually have to wait for it, but in the end it's almost always delicious.",1218326400,2,2871,5.035940803382664

I just thought there was too much dialogue at the beginning I was so ""bored"".There were only maybe four scenes that I liked from the whole movie and they were all close to the end. I just wish the guy in the movie done more killing, or had a little more action in it just something better than the way it is. It was still pretty good in those four scenes though. Well not everyone agrees with everyone about how they feel about movies.

2860624,3,B000R7HY0K,"... you're in for a humdinger of a ride.  Otherwise, just fast-forward through Texas and pick up the story in Tennessee.

Here is Stuntman Mike, walking into a bar, looking for a girl he can entice into his killer car.  Seems Mike is a played-out stuntman with a grudge at the world, especially the distaff half, and he gets his jollies by killing them off in his very own Deathmobile.  Mike has a jacked-up stunt car that he's made practically impregnable on the driver's side but he's turned the passenger side into a death trap.  As at least one unfortunate young lady is going to find out, to her everlasting regret.  He also uses his car as a battering ram to demolish an oncoming car and everyone in it.

When Tarantino is good, he is very, very, good, but unfortunately he's less than very good in ""Death Proof"".  The first half of the movie is a crashing bore.  The bar scene drags out interminably to no point.  None of the girls is remotely interesting.  Jungle Julia, played by Sydney Poitier, is a tiresome beeyotch who needs some attitude adjustment (maybe a backhanded slap across the mouth might help); Butterfly, played by Vanessa Ferlito, is just plain embarassing with her pathetic attempt at a lap dance, and the other two girls are just plain forgettable.  I can't even remember their names, that's how little of an impression they make on the viewer.  And Tarantino needs to retire Michael Parks as the small town Texas sheriff and Son Number One.  It was halfway funny in ""Kill Bill"" but it got old fast.

Patched up and with the Killmobile lusting for more blood, Stuntman Mike moves to Lebanon, Tennessee, and the second half of the film is as fun as the first half was boring.  Mike runs into four more girls he'd like to feed to the death car, but these girls engage us in a way the four women in Texas never did.  They're fun and refreshingly free of attitude.  Rosario Dawson as Abernathy shows a nice sense of comedy, Mary Elizabeth Winstead is fetching as Lee, Zoe Bell (playing herself) shows some acting ability besides being a world-class stuntwoman (she was Uma Thurman's stunt double in ""Kill Bill"") and Tracie Thoms bring just the right amount of street into the role of Kim.  There's a lot of pointless chattering among these four as well, but unlike the first group, these girls are fun to listen to and we laugh along with them.

Stuntman Mike wants to turn these ladies into car-fodder as well, but turns out he's messed with the wrong women this time.  These chicks know how to give as good as they get and then some.  The last twenty minutes of the film are a wild ride with a bang-up ending, literally and figuratively.  (I did think Dawson's high-kick coup de grace was just a tad over the top, but that's a minor cavil.)  Ole Mike might want to consider taking up needlepoint as a hobby in his declining years.

The second half of the movie almost makes up for the deadly first half, but the first half is bad enough to make me give his film three stars instead of four.  There are plenty of car chases and car crashes, severed limbs and blood and gore throughout the film to satisfy the horror fans, but when all is said and done, it's not enough.  The main problem with ""Death Proof"" is that, in the end, it's only half a movie.

But, that's a very minor complaint because otherwise, this film was loads of fun. The female leads did a good job, Kurt was in top form and terrifically cast as Stuntman Mike. All-in-all, it was one wild ride even if it did start a little slow. If you enjoyed B-movie hot rod-themed pictures in the theater in the 70's that the characters allude to (""Vanishing Point"", ""Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry"", ""Gone In 60 Seconds""), you'll really get a kick out of this - I liked it a lot!",1216252800,,687,4.292307692307692

The characters are exceptionally well made and memorable. Three days after seeing the movie, I'm still constantly thinking about Stuntman Mike and the girls.
At the same time, though, there are some very silly plot elements that simply break the rhythm of the movie rather than contributing to the feeling that you are watching a 70's piece.

Finally Kurt comes on as Stuntman Mike, you would think all the talking the women do would further the plot but it doesn't. He talks to them at a bar get's a lap dance then well let's just say there is about 8 minutes of bloody action. After that it switched to ANOTHER set of women talking for another 30 minutes. Turns out 2 of the girls are stunt women and one has a gun. They get into a cool car chase with Mike then *spoiler* either knock him out or kill him you can't tell. Then the end. So quick summary, 2 hour movie, 2 action scenes that are total 15 minutes long and the rest is talking, cussing and boring.

2860628,4,B000R7HY0K,"Tarentino is no doubt in many lists of favorite Writer/Directors but with Grindhouse, he and Rodriguez have bought something old but new to the table. Tarentino's film Death Proof to me was just too good to pass up. I read the synopsis but I still for some reason just couldn't believe it. The film stars Kurt Russell among others but Russell is the most surprising character.

Russell plays Stuntman Mike, who is basically a psycho in disguise and it certainly is not a good one.  Stuntman Mike has a black souped-up 1970 Chevy Nova that is what he calls, Death Proof. Stuntman Mike has a bit of a secret, he likes to kill women with his muscle car. He picks who he likes, then takes some pictures of them, and then waits for perfect timing when the women are driving of course, and then have a huge planned car accident.

In the first half Mike stalks three friends Arlene(Vanessa Ferlito), Shanna(Jordan Ladd) and a local DJ named Julia Lucai(Sydney Tamiia Poitier). After he heals from the first hit, he moves on to his next victims.  The second victims who are unrelated to the first are Lee Montgomery (Mary Elizabeth Winestead), Abernathy Ross (Rosario Dawson), Kim Mathis (Tracie Thomas), and Zoe Bell. Zoe is visiting from out of town and Tracie and her friends are driving to pick her up from the airport. Tracie and Zoe just happen to be professional stuntwomen.

This becomes very evident throughout the remaining scenes of he film. A local resident is selling a white 1970 Dodge Challenger and is advertising it in the paper. This car is the same car that was in the movie Vanishing Point. The car has caught Zoe's eye and she wants to test drive it or so she says. When Zoe, Tracie, and Abernathy decide to partake in a very risky game of ""Ship's Mast"" Mike takes this as an invitation. What Mike didn't know was that he messed with the wrong girls this time.  There was a lot that I loved about Death Proof and there was some stuff that I didn't like.

I loved the characters; they were all unique and well written. They seemed like real people that reacted to the situations perfectly. The girls from the second half of the film were sick and amazing to complete the film nicely. The car chases were very intense and very fast. Not only will the crashes take your breath away but also what the second half of girls does to Stuntman Mike is jaw dropping, no lie.  What I didn't like about Death proof was the prolonged talking that felt like it would never end. This even made me want to give this movie 3.5 stars. Tarantino admits that he is not the greatest writer when it comes to dialogue and it shows in this film. The dialogue is a little dry in some spots and long-winded but despite this, the movie was still worthy of 4 stars. Other than that Death Proof was a great movie, I would say that the pacing was almost off but evened itself out in a good way. The action scenes were extremely exciting and I would recommend this to all Tarantino lovers for sure.",1214956800,2,2980,4.475138121546961

The car chase itself is OK (as far as these things go) but it surely will not be a reason to want to see this headache of a film TWICE. Most disappointing is the Acting,not just by the Kiwi stunt-woman(and who can blame her?)but by the whole crew. The painfuly awful cameos by Tarantino and Eli Roth only  remind you that,with the exception of Kurt Russell,the acting of everybody else in this disaster is NO better. Even the Music, the hallmark of Tarantino's films, is sadly missing in action;it's as forgettable as this sorry feeble mess.  Yes, we understand that this film is intended as an 'homage' to B-Movies,but instead of Cheesy Fun,we are subjected to Unrelenting Dullness. This movie(not that it moves)is as much Fun as going to the Dentist to have your teeth scraped....It might cost less but it takes a LOT longer(assuming I didn't nod off, the running time seemed like four-and-a-half hours).If you are curious to see this cinematic stinker,keep in mind that there are plenty of used(and not-so-used) copies available on this site.

Overall I just had little sympathy for these moronic girls.  Since all their dilemnas seemed to be caused by such incredible stupidity.  First of all, if you don't want somehting horrible to happen to you, you don't take rides from strange men, duh!  Secondly, the next group of girls deserved to die in a horrible car crash after putting themselves in such a moronic situation, especially after leaving one of their friends behind to be raped in deliverance country.  But OK I guess grindhouse films were all about stupid people doing stupid things-but usually paying for it.

2860644,1,B000R7HY0K,"I lived through the seventies and saw more than my share of ""grindhouse"" movies at our local drive-in.  ""Death Proof"" bills itself as an homage to those sometimes campy, sometimes scary, sometimes just plain god-awful films that kept us juvenilles entertained through countless six-packs of ill-gotten brew.  ""Messiah of Evil"", ""The Student Nurses"", ""Six Pack Annie""--these are just a few titles that I remember with more affection than they probably deserve.  However, ""Death Proof"" is less an homage, than a ham-handed, self-indulgent ripoff of the genre from Quentin Tarantino, a director whose films have grown steadily worse since his halcyon days of ""Reservoir Dogs"", ""Pulp Fiction"", and ""Jackie Brown"".  The ""Kill Bill"" films, despite great performances from a stellar cast, were ludicrous, overlong, and, eventually, tiresome.  ""Death Proof"" is just plain boring, loaded with so much inane and profane banter between some of the least interesting characters imagineable, that it becomes unwatchable.  I forced myself to sit through it just to make sure I was clear on what I was seeing.  Then, I wanted to throw the DVD into the garbage, where it belongs. Kurt Russell apparently needed a paycheck as he non-acts his way through the poorly conceived role of a stuntman/psycho who hotrods around in his souped up auto, stalking scantily clad cuties who spout dialogue that would insult the intelligence of any average seventh grader.

2860662,4,B000R7HY0K,"The first time I watched this movie, I thought it was a little slow and not as good as Planet Terror.  Planet Terror is fast paced and action packed, and this one seemed to have a lot of superfulous scenes.  Then came the car accident scene and I was riveted.  It was, hands down, the best car crash scene I have ever seen.  Horrifying without being terribly gory (there is some gore, but it is really muted compared with your typical slasher flick).  A moment of cinematic poetry.  Same with the second half of the movie; a lot of dialogue that builds to an amazing car chase scene.  But then I watched it again and since I knew what was coming I could focus more on the interaction between the characters and the character study, and I was able to pick out the very subtle nuances that made the dialogue more enjoyable.  Kurt Russell is the bad guy you root for, not so much because the girls are so unlikeable, but because he is so likeable, even though he's derranged.  Butterfly's character is striking, most notably during her exchange with Stuntman Mike prior to her dance.  Rose McGowan shines as Pam (I love the scene where she's talking about her connection to Jungle Julia).

I am, however, an admirer of Quentin Tarantino. I don't worship the ground he treads as so many of his devoted fans do, but I usually like what he does with films (although I think there is a very, very thin line between homage and plain copying at times), especially on the sound side.

""Death Proof"" is not among my favourite films though. Kurt Russel is nothing short of amazing as stuntman Mike, the homicidal and death defying petrolhead picking up girls in bars. The rest of the cast also acts well, no doubt about it, and there is a few bits of decent action thrown in the mix as well, but the story is simply too boring. I belong to the crowd who think it is slow, dull, and not at all witty. This, however, may be an added effect of watching it in the cinema right after the actionfilled and hugely amuzing, over the top Rodriguez film ""Planet Terror"", but I think that even when watched on its own, ""Death Proof"" is still a bit bland. The slow pace with which the story unfolds and the concomitant desire to yawn is not entirely justified by the action sequences in the latter third of the movie, which would've been the only reasonable way for this film to redeem itself. Sadly it doesn't happen.

If you are a fan of the genre or, to use a pathetic and utterly silly, yet popular term, a Tarantino fanboy, I think you might like it better than I did. It's definitely not without potential, but it is just not good enough.",1207872000,,1576,4.320945945945946
2860668,3,B000R7HY0K,"Tarantino's homage to B movie exploitation films just about works. Mainly I think this is down to the teriffic car chases and a superb performance by Kurt Russell as Stuntman Mike.

However in many other areas this was a disappointment. I found some of the dialogue between the women unrealistic and Tarantino has used some if it before (i.e. discussions about foot massages). Yes it was quite violent in places. Noteably, the first female victim and first car crash. The grainy/fake film look worked quite well, but I never really cared about any of the characters in the film.

For a film with a very insubstantial plot this was also too long. To justify its current length (110mins) some of Tarantino's trademark dialog could have been cut or replaced with more exploitation! Most genre films of that type were short (e.g. Texas Chainsaw Massacre was under 90mins).

Tarantino is a talented director and filmmaker who has a proven record in successfully reinventing old genres. In this case he hasn't quite succeeded. Its certainly worth seeing, but I'd rent first rather than buy.",1207440000,,1084,4.945054945054945

2860682,5,B000R7HY0K,"Quentin Tarantino is nowhere near being a bad director. He is a brilliant man with a great passion for the type of movies that he wants to create, and he does it with great skill. This shows through even with his clear film cutting ""mistakes"" and purposefully prolonged filming of uninteresting objects, or of characters who may talk for extended periods of time without feeling the need to cut the majority of these parts into the ""deleted scenes"" on DVD.
 Not just any filmmaker can make a movie with the intention of it being poorly crafted without succeeding on levels where they weren't trying.
 That concept makes a perfect analogy with Pablo Diego Jos Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno Mara de los Remedios Cipriano de la Santsima Trinidad Martyr Patricio Clito Ruiz y Picasso - commonly referred to as Pablo Picasso; that an artist should actually know how to paint and draw human forms and anatomy correctly before intentionally doing it wrong. Quentin knows all of the anatomy.

 I absolutely loved Zoe Bell and Tracie Thoms in this movie. Their acting was somewhat a contrast from the other; where Tracie seemed often forceful and aggressive (hence her being the driver), Zoe was extremely lighthearted in her personality and was going along for the ride while still being on the edge.

 I honestly never thought of Mr. Tarantino pulling off a movie with such a large vehicle chase sequence. He finished the film by executing it with top notch speed and precision, and the result had me cheering in excitement for all of the girls in the film. It was pure satisfaction.

2860684,3,B000R7HY0K,"I'd been wanting to see this for a long time, it never got released in cinemas here due to it being cut in half instead of being screened along with Planet Terror in Australia as it was supposed to. finally it's arrived on DVD here, and it was not what I expected it was going to be.

Kurt Russel plays Stunt Man Mike, a guy who has issues. His character and motivation are not explained as to why the hell he does what he does, but I guess thats probably what they where going for in this.

It's quality is bad, but done on purpose, it's supposed to give the feel of how drive in movies where in the 70's, tho it kinda gets a bit annoying after a while, but more with Planet Terror.

The opening scene is a bit too long, i found myself almost nodding off while 3 chicks go on and on about useless things in there lives that have no tie in to the plot whatsoever. However, by the time there death scene comes, you are happy to see the annoying ego driven chick, the younger looking Angelina Joeline wanna-be and there quieter spethshall friends taken out.

Stunt Man Mikes kind of stalks them, then makes friends with them in a bar, offers someone a lift home, and the 5 hideous girls lives are in the hands of Mike's ""death proof"" car. Death Proof meaning the car is a stunt car, rigged for movies, so if it crashes, the driver will be safe. Which Kurt Russel's character utilizes on.

It almost feels like it could have been a half hour TV show, as now two useless cops into play just to waste up some screen time, then Mike heals up, and he's at it again, only this time what goes around, comes around.

Overall, the whole thing is watchable, it's ok, but it's not fantastic. The first half of the movie is shot for the 70's drive in look, then stalk #2 is clear.

The thing that made it odd to me was it looked and sounded like it was supposed to be in the 70's, but it was present day due to unneeded and useless scenes involving text messaging by cell phones.
IMO none of those things where needed and should have been cut out, and kept it like it was supposed to be set in the 70's.

The second act, left me thinking three words... WTF?
Was the cheerleader and behind the counter sales of a fashion magazine needed, or supposed to be funny, I dunno... I think they just had a 30 minute movie and stretched it out as much as they could with useless scenes of dialog that go for too long and have absolutely nothing to do with the movie. However the end chase scene is pretty entertaining, it's good to see a non CGI car chase on film again that gets the excitement pumping as you watch.

While some do decry the lengthy, dialog-driven charcter establishment of the first two thirds (but, what a glorious, facinating banter it is, as only QT can do), the film is genuinely suspenseful, and thrilling, in a disturbing, train-wreck element of the series of car-chase finales that wrap things up.",1205366400,,630,5.116504854368932
2860690,2,B000R7HY0K,"Both 'Resevoir Dogs', and 'Pulp fiction' are phenomenal films by Quentin Tarantino. I won't deny him that. And whilst the Kill Bills played a very large homage to films of the past (including a scene that came straight out of Good Bad and the Ugly) I was willing to accept his ambitions as a movie buff.

But the Grindhouse films are simply a blatant attempt to cash in on the history of cinema. Its a movie buff trying to see the job through (starting with Kill Bill). Its more blatant and to be quite honest I find it insulting. Wouldnt we all love to make a movie that ripped off some of our favourite films from back in the day. HE Throws in a few Quentin trademarks, blood splatters, drawn out coffee conversations, and overly cool lines... and you have yourself the Grindhouse.

Deathproof is Quentin's overly stylized film with very little substance. I am a fan of the very films he tries to emulate and even though he tries ever so hard to make these feel and sound like the 70's cult classics... it lacks any flair. He tries too hard.. the grazing of the film quality and the intermittent reel skips are just too forced. Its like going to Disney Land... nothing is real... and everything is... ""how can we make this cool""

Tarantino is all about how can we make this cool... oh I know... let the girls kick some a$$... oh I know ... I'll make her walk around with one leg... oh I know... Ill make myself a bad a$$.

The endings to both Grindhouse movies are terribly over the top and I know we can sit here and argue that it was intentional in the tradition of 70's cult classics... but it doesnt work... and thats the bottom line.

So is this Tarantino's future, to indulge as a movie buff.. to borrow, steal and pluck from the tree... is this ok?.. as long as he admits to it?

Does he think he is doing us a favour. As if to say that we had not seen such classics or that we needed the cult explained to us once more?

Of course he has a fan base now that will call whatever he does ""genius"".

Usually, the conversations in Tarantino's movies are entertaining, but in this movie it was just awful.  It's one thing for conversation to go on when it's engaging and amusing.

*Car crash scene in the middle of the movie is intense (a few good gory effects as well).
*Very unique style, very reminiscent of the 70s.
*Good soundtrack.
*Cool cars.
*Some homages to other QT films (look out for the ""Kill Bill"" ringtone, or the car with ""Kill Bill"" colors, or the record from ""Pulp Fiction""...).
*Some homages to other 70s films (like the car in the end, which is the same as from ""Vanishing Point"").

The Bad Things:
*Slow-moving story (and it's a pretty wierd story too).  Some parts seemed like they could have been cut out (lots of dialogue that doesn't fit with the story).
*This was supposed to be a horror slasher film, but it hardly feels like one.
*Half of the movie is made to look old on purpose (which I think is good, because it's additional homage to 70s films (and older ""Grindhouse"" films)).  Some might find this gaudy.

Much like ""Pulp Fiction,"" this is a strange, mesmerizing trip through 70s style filming with cool characters, strong dialogue, and an incredibly unique style.  This film is a little better, because it has excellent action scenes at the end.  It's a little worse, because it's all one story told around two groups of women, and thus gets a little long.

Highly reccomended for people who are transfixed with that era, people who like QT or ""Pulp Fiction"", and people who like car chases.

When I first reviewed this, I listed it as a disappointment. But over time and several viewings, it has become a well favored movie in my collection. It's a sleeper hit for sure. All those things I disliked at first, now it all seems very much part of the charm. I do like this longer cut over the original release cut. But it is worth having both.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I gotta say, I greatly regretted not seeing the double-feature in the theaters. I procrastinated, and before I knew it, it was gone. Oh well. So when I got the DVD of them, I was really looking forward to finally watching two great directors at work. Sadly, though, ""death Proof"" came as a disappointment. There was alot to like if you are very much into watching a professionally-made crappy movie. I don't mean that to sound like I know it does. Bad movies can be great. But from someone who has made such brilliant works of pure art such as ""Kill Bill"" or ""Reservoir Dogs"", what he ended up making here comes across as an overly self-indulgent homage to every single little 'goof' that occurred in low-budget grindhouse movies. Simply put, he way over did it on making the movie look poorly assembled, and the charm wears off fast. And even though I've ALWAYS preferred the longer, extended director's cuts of just about every other movie out there, this one could have been three times better by being half as long.
Buyer beware on this one.

The moment the dialogue kicks in you could swear that the master behind Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs is back on form. In fact, for the first half of this movie, he is, and fans will be very happy that the Tarantino they remembered and loved is back on top form.

However, while the second half of the movie contains some interesting performances, for a film that virtually has an all-girl cast, it doesn't match up to the spectacular first hour which is full of hilarious gags (like comments about Stuntman Mike's scar being the result of him falling out of his time machine) and the most violent car crash scene in the history of motion picture smash ups.

In a way Death Proof plays more as an ode to movies about cars than it does a Grindhouse B-Movie feature. While that style is presented well for the first hour (jump cuts, dirty reels, hammy direction [that's actually really good], new title replacing the original name of the film, bad edits, bad cuts, bad hairdos) Tarantino looses the feel in the second half, devoting most of his time to a car stunt that is over long and a car chase that is nothing spectacular, with an ending that doesn't really sit well. When it's all over you get the feeling that he would have been better off doing the second half like he did the first half for a much more satisfying road rage film.

There are a couple of things which kill the movie, the first of which is that it didn't really need to be divided into two parts. The cast, scenery, dialog, and setup are all much better in the first half of the movie than in the second part. By letting the movie conclude with the first cast having thier revenge (yes, some re-writing) rather than breaking off and re-starting with a fresh cast it would have been a better movie, as well as a bit shorter. Instead, the movie is 30 minutes too long and there are no interesting people on the screen except for Rosario Dawson for most of that time. And there's a ton of dialog between two pretty dull actresses. Three stars is charitable; a great soundtrack helps.",1202688000,3,793,4.401360544217687
2860714,2,B000R7HY0K,"First, the good news: the climax of 'Death Proof' is probably the most thrilling cinematic car chase I've seen since 'Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior'. And since you're watching this on DVD, you can skip through all the boring bits rather than waste an hour watching what must have been Quentin Tarantino's attempt to get in touch with his feminine side and prove that he could write dialogue for women.

!!!  SPOILER WARNING  !!!

The first half of the movie follows a group of attractive women as they head out for a night drinking and meet the murderous Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell as a pretty scary villain), who then kills them in his 'death proof' car. The local sheriff decides that since he has no evidence it was murder, he's not going to do anything, and doesn't. We then meet another four women passing through the same town, two of them stunt performers, who are re-enacting a scene from 'Vanishing Point' when Stuntman Mike starts chasing them.

Now that you've read this, you don't have to watch that part of the movie, which drags much more than it races. Yes, we get some likeable eye candy, some tension, we see how the monster works, but do we really need an hour of this? The Drew Barrymore scene at the beginning of 'Scream' gained our sympathy and had just as much impact in a fraction of the time.

I pity anyone who sat through this in a cinema, but not as much as I pity the ones who fell asleep or walked out from boredom - because if you're into edge-of-your-seat high-octane excitement, the final scene is hard to beat. Unfortunately, the lead-up feels as though the editor fell asleep at the wheel, when he should have just put his foot on the accelerator. Get the DVD, but be prepared to fast-forward.

A particular scene at a diner came off as an actor's exercise--how many times can you use the n-word, the s-word and the b-word in a conversation.  Extra bonus points for using the f-word as an adjective.

These women weren't even discussing anything relevant to the story.  Yes, the scene where the three beauties beat psycho Stuntman Mike at his own game was terrific but the slog you had to go through to get there hardly made it worth the payoff.

2860716,1,B000R7HY0K,"I believe this cumulative film ""Grindhouse"" was an exciting adventure and idea, but this film isn't good. What's most troublesome is that the film is filled with good actors and things just aren't working out. QT alienates people from the films he says he loves in this film by calling them out and then providing a film that vastly underperforms and fails to live up to the mold. I believe I read an interview with him about this film in which he describes the other film as a straighahead zombie movie, whereas this one is a ""more complicated hybrid"" of the chase thriller. Ahem, no this isn't a complicated genre, Quentin, you just have to clutter up a simple structure with your pointless dialogue and that makes it ""complicated"" and ""bad."" The thing that really makes this film's demise worse is that the beginning isn't all that bad and the sequences featuring Kurt Russell are actually very good, but when he's not onscreen and we have to play the ""we're going to learn all about these girls and their lives"" setup game, it completely throws off the momentum of the film. Frankly, he's used the random mundane dialogue in the past and it comes off as endearing, but here it doesn't work because we're both expecting and not expecting it. Previously it worked because the characters otherwise had a bite to them and were interesting, or the things they said were an odd juxtaposition to their occupation (Pulp Fiction).  Here we have four women who are everyday women, they have mundane jobs on a film set, save for the one who can't act, and they talk about the most mundane things imaginable. There's no setup to the plot with these women, they seem conspicously separate from the rest of the movie and that's the problem, there's no connection or intrigue as to why Stuntman Mike chooses them, they're just completely random. The first group of girls, although still a bit yawn-inducing at least had some intrigue prompting their inclusion. We never get that with these women and it feels like most of the film is about them. Also, we don't truly believe that Stuntman Mike wouldn't be able to kill them, it really seems as if he's been doing this awhile and knows how to be efficient.

QT does telegraph the fact these women won't be dying with his inclusion of a character played by a female stuntwoman with the implication being that Stuntman Mike can only kill women who don't know how to play it safe, but if he comes across someone who knows how to play it dangerous and still come out ok, then he's toast.  I don't buy it for a minute and found the resolution lame. The ending is so light-hearted and crappy in a ""girls just having a good time"" kinda way.  This isn't a chick flick and it has no place being here. There's only a few tense moments in this film, when Kurt Russell approaches the girl to give him a lapdance, and when he kills one of the women in his car. Other than that, everything else feels incredibly safe, even the dangerous car stunt that Zoe Bell pulls off.

It doesn't even have some of the campy charm that's found in Planet Terror, also not a classic, but still some fun. There's one thing I can say for this DVD (that I haven't seen) it might possibly be more interesting than the theatrical version, but I can't imagine it being so with all that pointless girltalk dominating the middle and later portions of the film it would just make it more interminable.

Here's hoping that Tarantino comes back with a film that can not only be decent, but stand on it's own. I believe he can because this film felt rushed and second rate, hopefully he creative energy hasn't been sapped.",1202428800,31,3619,4.56

I truly enjoyed the first segment of the movie with all the great visuals,the hot chicks,stuntman mike,the gore and the soundtrack,but then it all goes downhill from there. The second half of this movie is filled with so much boring,useless and stupid dialogue that it really quite annoyed me to no end. All the female characters in the second half of the movie are completely forgetable and annoying. The main problem with this film is that tarantino should have made a horror exploitation movie of the 70's but instead he made a exploitation movie with several sub genres spliced into one,thus missing his objective. Another major flaw is that tarantino writes way too much pointless dialogue which he probably believes is good. Someone should be brutally honest with him about this because it is ruining his films and he is boring to death many audience members who are paying to see quality work which he isn't delivering. Tarantino needs to clean up his act and get with the program if he ever truly wants to be a great director like stanley kubrick or clive barker. ENOUGH SAID!!!!",1201564800,3,1231,4.784037558685446
2860719,4,B000R7HY0K,"I actually liked this wierd tale that is shot like a very cheap movie with intentional cuts and skips and grain in the film.  Kurt Russell is a serial psycho that likes to murder women with his car.  In the first portion of the film the director has a lot of interaction with a group of women that end up at a bar.  Russell seems to have followed them to the bar.  There they meet him and they know him only as Stuntman Man.  He claims to have been a stuntman in many old tv shows and he drives a car that he claims could be used to ram a brick was at 100 mph without a problem.  Russell eventually has his way with the women.

The second half of the film involves a different group of women in a different town.  When Russell tries to have his way with them he finds out fast that he messed with the wrong women!

But I found myself waiting for something more, and then just kept waiting.  Yeah it's got gore, yeah it's got muscle cars, and yeah it's got babes.  So for that-- good job Q.T., but this ain't no Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill.",1200960000,3,668,4.40650406504065
2860732,3,B000R7HY0K,"Not that this film needs another review, but I suppose I'll put in my two cents for s%*ts and giggles.  But before I get into anything, I'd just like to point out that this movie solidly confirms what we'd all suspected since Pulp Fiction, and that is that Tarantino most certainly has a foot fetish.  There are so many shots of feet in this film that you almost(almost) think that the project had started out as a foot fetish porn film that Tarantino might have wanted to do on the side.  With all that aside, the general consensus on Death Proof is that it's a colossal bore.  There are quite a few defenders of the film as well, maybe even moreso than those who didn't like it.  Are people tiring of Tarantino's style or did Tarantino's style just not work this time around?  I'm somewhere in the middle.  I didn't think this was the abysmal failure it's made out to be, nor do I think it's a very good Tarantino film.  I also don't think it's all that great an homage to grindhouse cinema.  Grindhouse films of the 70 were cheap, exploitative, sometimes shocking or groundbreaking, fun, trashy entertainment.  Fast food kinda movies.  Now in Death Proof Tarantino basically made a Tarantino film with a few grindhouse dashes here and there(the music from Dario Argento's Bird With The Crystal Plumage plays while Kurt Russell is photographing his next potential victims like the killer in Argento's film did.  The scene is also shot in the same style.  A nice touch).  Fine.  After all, it is his movie.  By now everyone knows the major criticism of this movie is the constant dialogue and little action.  Personally, I have no problem with movies that take their time getting to where they're going.  Many of the best directors do take their time.  Tarantino himself has made this work for him before.  After all, this is the guy who can take an 80 minute premise and stretch it out to absurd lengths, but manage to keep things interesting.  In the case of Death Proof, it's simply the story of  a vehicular serial killer that finally tangles with the wrong carload of potential victims and has the tables turned on him.  I expected alot of dialogue in this film.  Tarantino himself can't keep his mouth shut, so why should his characters?  My problem didn't come from the dialogue, my problem was that I didn't like a single character in this movie.  Tarantino seemed to find the most irritating and grating women on the planet and stuck them all here.  The few males weren't much better in their small roles(one of them being Tarantino's new bosom buddy, Eli Roth).  I certainly don't get off on real life serial killers, but the great thing about the film world is that you can feel guiltless for rooting for the bad guy.  Killers can be cool in the movies.  I was rooting for Kurt Russell all the way in the hopes that he would put an end to these annoying women.  Speaking of Russell, he's clearly the best actor of the bunch and puts on a good performance.  Personally I didn't like his on a dime turn from macho killer to whining wuss.  People also felt this didn't fit as the second feature on a double bill.  Well, I have no problem with that either coz old grindhouse double features would usually include two films quite different from one another.  On the positive side, I really admire what Tarantino and Rodriguez were trying to accomplish with the Grindhouse project.  It's a great idea and a pity it wasn't a success.  I do feel that Death proof has it's moments, and not just the fleeting violent ones either.  With so many reviews already, I can't add much more to the pile.  All I can say is that I'm glad I saw it and I appreciate the effort even if I wasn't totally thrilled with the results.  In the end I can only suggest that if a person really wants the ""grindhouse"" experience, just rent a ""grindhouse"" movie.  I'd suggest Death Race 2000 if you dig this kinda vehicle carnage.",1200873600,8,3908,4.541547277936963

2860736,2,B000R7HY0K,"While Planet Terror was a rather interesting and unique film, Tarantino's Death Proof exudes an excessive amount of absolute boredom and leaves the viewers with a rather large and unwanted helping of dissatisfaction.  The film lacks any clear plot and consists of endless dialogs shared amongst two groups of women in souped-out cars from decades past.

The faux-plot follows two groups of women who drive from point A to point B while sharing long and boring conversations: the substance of this chatter is not at all applicable to the progression of the film, and it only serves as a filer to bait about a half-hour until the women arrive at point B.  Once settled into Point B, the women then begin more endless and mindless banter for another good thirty minutes.  Somehow, Tarantino managed to weave a sadistic stunt man into the foregone plot who, unbeknownst to the traveling women, has been stalking the current group in hopes of killing them in a fancy act of vehicular homicide.  The act marks an end for the first group of unfortunate women.

Repeat the above with the next group of unsuspecting women, but with more emphasis on nebulous conversations.  But with the second group of women, the sadistic stunt man has bit of more than he can chew: two of the women are accomplished stunt women themselves (one also carries a conveniently hidden handgun).  After surviving a rather amazing chase sequence, the women track down the maniac stunt man and exact their revenge.

Besides the cool chase at the end of the film, this film has lackluster writing, boring camera angles, and characters who actually devolve rather than evolve.  For instance, the first set of women has one clever and instinctive member who correctly suspects the stunt man of not being an entirely good man and suspects a threat about him.  However, any of these suspicions are quickly drowned and forgotten with a lot booze and a pointless and gratuitous scene with a lap dance.

Another point that bothers me with this film, and any film having been made by Tarantino for that matter, is the fact that Tarantino appears in most of his films--regardless the type or the longevity of the character he portrays, he lends absolutely nothing to any of the films.  It's as if he insists to be in each of his films no matter how little sense it makes.

I really tried to like this film, but it lacked any redeeming points; however, the soundtrack is rather fun and catchy.  One such song is the remake of ""Laisse tomber les filles"" which is played at the end of the film while the credits drop.

Hipsters and poseurs (IMDB fans are another story) will no doubt love this film, but will fail to provide anything substantial about the film to explain why they love the film so much.  Skip Death Proof, but if you want a film, that's in my opinion fresh and different, then aim for Planet Terror.",1200268800,5,2870,4.708

2860742,3,B000R7HY0K,"I won't go into the clever game of tagging all of Tarantino's references to cult films and music of the past. Suffice it to say, I know where he's been. I saw Vanishing Point four times while it played at my local cinema for a week and couldn't believe it didn't get an R rating for that naked chick (I was 15 back then). When my kids were little I taught them Dave, Dee Dozey, Beaky, Mick, and Titch as a nursery rhyme of sorts. I could go on.
In short, this should be my kind of movie. But along with the good, there is bad and ugly in this movie.
First, the good. Kurt Russell is excellent as Stuntman Mike. His take on crazy makes me think of where Warren Oates could have taken his character to from Two Lane, Black Top if there had been a sequel. It's a gem of a performance and he's the 440 under the hood that drives this movie. And speaking of driving, that's the real pay-off at the end. It's a magnificent hunter vs. hunted, male vs. female, Russ Meyer vs. Richard Sarafian car chase.
Now the bad. So the movie bombed in the theaters. At the time, I blamed that on his market audience just wanting to wait on extended, unrated DVD cuts (like me, except I can use the excuse of there's no theaters in my town). However, there could be another reason. In Pulp Fiction, those profanity-laced endless conversations were quirky and philosophical. What we get in Deathproof is endless, profanity-laced, bitchy, girl talk about who screwed who (please make it STOPPPPPPPP!!!) It gets to the point that the chicks just seem to argue about EVERY FREAKING THING and if only Stuntman Mike would just run them over, I'd buy his blessed pea-pickin' heart a twelve-pack of Rocky Mountain Coors (and not that lite crap). Maybe this is what drove Stuntman Mike crazy to begin with.
And now the Ugly. I've shown my kids Le Mans and they are big fans of Bullit. I noted to them that this stuff is the real thing, not CGI like in that incredibly crappy remake of Gone in Sixty Seconds. I grew up in the musclecar era. I had a screaming fast Barracuda. My point is, how could anyone who loves those car DESTROY ABOUT TWO DOZEN OF THEM???? OhMYGTOD, the INHUMANITY!! These babies are not exactly coming off the assembly line anymore. When the stunt crew proudly related how when one Challenger or Charger was damaged, they did the exact same matching damage to the other cars, I realized why some people call for Jihad in this world! This holocaust of Mopar dreamcars is hideous beyond measure (the Nova destruction was ok, because I hate those damn Chevys)! This, my Moparlover brethren, is what takes the joy out of this film. And this calls for action, before it's too late. For decades we have seen the disclaimer, ""no animals were killed or injured...la dee freakin' da"" and of course, it is politically incorrect to smoke (unless it's dope) in current movies. Now Hollywood must come to the realization that it is INHUMANE to damage and destroy Detroit muscle in the making of a film. Movies need to be monitored to see that the use of such wheels as these does not leave a scratch or mar their finish in the least. And as for you, Mr. Tarantino, I hope you don't lose too much sleep at night over every child who will never grow up to own a 1970 Dodge Challenger because you HAD to destroy them in your movie. In the balance, is the world a better place adding Deathproof to our respective Netflix queues or are we worse off for your subtracting the existence of untold number of Challengers and Chargers from our midst?

Somewhere between heard it already and yawn. A lot of the dialogue felt forced, like he was just trying too hard, or maybe he drank too much Crystal before writing. Don't get me wrong I like the bootie shots, but Tarantino is about sex, violence AND story. He is a masterful storyteller. Without the storytelling element the genius is gone, and we are left with third rate garbage. Tarantino has a role himself. One of his greatest ambitions is to be an actor, but he was just awful as well. I believe he went to the William Shatner School of acting.

It is understandable why people give the films negative reviews, if you're not familiar with those types of films you won't get it. I believe Tarantino and Rodriguez tried to bring back a long lost theatrical experience, and unfortunately it didn't work out.

The plot decides to disappear for most of the film, only ducking in for about ten minutes of the movie's total 120 minute running time.

The rest of the time is filled with stupid, insipid dialogue that has nothing to do with the plot.  This isn't even entertaining dialogue, like in Pulp Fiction.  No, it's just idiotic conversation between characters that we couldn't care less about.  After the first forty-five minutes we fast forwarded through the rest of the movie until we reached the car chases.

Kurt Russell is decent in this, but his talent is wasted by the idiocy of the script and the ineptness of the rest of the cast.  As it stands, his character was the only one I even cared about a little.

The stylized nature of the film, such as when it has jumpcuts, and when it recreates film reel changes, is campy fun.  Those bits and the car chases are the only good things in the film.

2860764,4,B000R7HY0K,"Death Proof is Quentin Tarantino's contribution to the Grindhouse double feature, an unapologetic embrace of low budget exploitation films that played in drive-ins throughout the 60s and 70s.  Heavy on ""royal with cheese"" dialogue and chalked full of some of Hollywood's best eye candy, Death Proof unmistakenly wears the fingerprints of its creator.  Taking his homage as far as he can go, Tarantino also recreates the hisses, pops, cigarette burns, missing/repeated frames and audio inconsistencies common during the drive-in era.

Despite the dozen or so scream queen roles that Tarantino no doubt wrote into the script so he could fill them with a casting couch, Death Proof's star is Kurt Russell, the mysterious Stunt Man Mike, an ageing scarred Elvis Man who drives around in a stunt car built to survive any accident.  Since Stunt Man Mike knows he can live though any crash with this ""Death Proof"" car, he uses his automobile as a weapon to mow down Tarantino's titillating temptresses.  Death Proof does not explain why Stuntman Mike does what he does, instead relying on the audience to accept the simplistic, one dimensional nature of classic exploitation horror films.  Stunt Man Mike kills people...enough said.

After what appears to have been a long life of automobile decapitations and mutilations, Stunt Man Mike seems to meet his match when he targets a car full of female stunt drivers, a duel which manifests into a car war that would make James Dean, Gene Hackman and The Dukes of Hazzard all jealous.  The last half of Death Proof features some of the most unbelievable stunt work ever captured on screen, highlighted by Zoe Bell (real life stuntwoman playing herself) slipping and spinning on her car's hood at terrifying speeds.

As with most of his work in the last decade and a half, Tarantino is more concerned with having fun than with recreating the brilliance of his early films.  Nothing in Death Proof is meant to challenge the White/Pink bantering from Reservoir Dogs or the Christopher Walken scenes from True Romance or Pulp Fiction.  He's not making those kind of movies anymore.  Instead, Tarantino is like a Senior who only needs a few electives to graduate and spends his last semester taking swimming and ballroom dancing.  He's done all the hard work and now just wants to have a good time.  With Death Proof, Tarantino clearly achieves that goal...and audiences who understand his intentions will enjoy the ride.",1197244800,,2455,5.014778325123153

It could have been a spectacular film, especially with the way talented Kurt Russell handled his role as the automobile-homicidal killer, but the lengthy dialog was brutal.  The topics that were being discussed for time unending were nonsensical and had absolutely nothing to do with the movie.  Through conversations galore you learn all about a few girls and their lives, not to be set up for something in the plot that pertains to their conversations, but to have them killed moments later in a mere few seconds.  What seemed like hours upon hours of dreadful dialog and tiny amounts of action led to the two stars above. The car chase made the one star a two for me.

2860771,3,B000R7HY0K,"Quentin Tarantino's `5th' film Death Proof was originally conceived as the second part of a `Grindhouse' double bill with Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror. The idea was to replicate the 70's exploitation movie experience of low budget shclock opera's, where the posters are better than the actual films, and which have clearly been such a huge influence on both filmmakers - missing reels, scratched celluloid, gate hairs, tacky trailers and kitsch corporate graphics all to an ear splitting trumpet-loaded soundtrack. It certainly took me back to the pre-multiplex days of my childhood when audiences had enough of an attention span to watch two films back to back with barely a moment in between to restock on Embassy No10's and another carton of Kia-Ora.

 I saw the original Grindhouse `double bill' version in New York back in April, and appreciated it for the great bit of self indulgence it is on the part of the directors who should be in the happy position of being able to make the movies they want without having to worry too much about box office returns and studio interference. Unfortunately somewhere in the crossfire of a Mexican standoff between the producers, marketing department, distributors and the directors themselves Grindhouse has been mutilated, Black Dahlia-like, and unceremoniously dumped in two halves on U.K audiences. Although reviews were good, Grindhouse flopped in the states, so, with what appears to be a case of contagious cold feet tippy-toeing their way across the Atlantic, our distributors have decided that we're incapable of handling the Grindhouse experience in its entirety - hence releasing Tarantino's half as his 5th film.

Death Proof is an intentionally slight tale of psychopathic `Stuntman Mike' (Kurt Russell) who gets his kicks causing car crashes in his specially designed `death proof' Chevy Nova (and later a Dodge Charger) in which everyone except himself is killed. After targeting yet another group of nubile young girls as his next victims the tables are turned and Stuntman Mike becomes the subject of their bloody revenge.

  Considering the promise of mucho car-nage that the premise suggests Death Proof is dialogue heavy; but then one line of Tarantino's dialogue is more action packed than all of Diesel, Seagal and Van Damme's `roid' fests put together - and when the violence does descend, it falls hard. But isolated from the Grindhouse concept, Death Proof pales besides the likes of Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill. A 127 minute re-cut of the movie was shown at the Cannes Film Festival last May in an attempt to bring it up to the standard of Tarantino's other outings and this, I believe, is the version U.K audiences are about to witness.

 Unfortunately the faux-trailers of `forthcoming attractions' such as Machete, Hobo with a Shotgun and Werewolf Women of the S.S (with Nicolas Cage as Fu Manchu!) which split the original Grindhouse version are not included. This sequence was the highlight of the whole movie and I know I'm not the only one who hoped that they would actually turn some of these spoofs into real films. It's looking doubtful that the original Grindhouse double bill version will be shown in the U.K and even more annoying that the DVD releases of both films are not to feature the trailers either.

In his latest picture, `Death Proof' I thought by mid-movie, I had entered into a misogynists' paradise.  Not so.  Although you'll understand my misconception.  As most people have pointed out, this film is Tarantino's homage to B-movies.  It even has moments with threads going down the movie or reel changes done like you are sitting at a local theater in the day when they didn't have multiplexes, and the technician showing the movie was asleep at the wheel.

Taking place in Texas and Tennessee, a Hollywood stunt car driver, actually named ""Stuntman Mike"" (Kurt Russell) stalks beautiful models and Hollywood actresses on the scene, so that he can take them for a ride in his professional car.  He calls it ""Death Proof"" because of its design.  What he doesn't tell them is as dangerous as his grudge.  Using a black car with a white skull and crossbones, the whole affair comes across like a Joyce Carol Oates short story without the feeling of tragedy.

Then, 'Kill Bill 2' we were enthralled by the twists, turns, and tension laid out by the key players.  In both movies, we empathized with the pathos, comedy, and tragedy as experienced by Uma Thurman's character.  Our meeting with Bill, played by David Carradine, was no anti-climax, either.  We were in awe and shock mode, and knew that mostly we weren't supposed to take it all so seriously.

My main problem with 'Death Proof' is that, although we have finely drawn characters in the film,' we don't care about them.  The chic chatter of the core female protagonists is meant to get us to hope for their demise.  In the end we hope the road rage ends both the misogynist (played skillfully in a creepy way by Kurt Russell) and the prima donnas who end up in his sites.  The road chase scenes are lively and capture a close up brutality, and the honky-tonk bar scenes certainly provide an exposition that is sordid and detailed.  He's got it right conceptually and visually.  It's just much of the story and characterization often fail.  What we get is a lot of wasted talk time and little of the novelties of past Tarantino adventures.  It's just no fun anymore.

Stuntman Mike, a former stuntman and stunt driver has found a new hobby. He likes killing attractive young girls with his custom built stunt car......

This movie was pretty bad. I know Quentin Tarantino has made some outstanding movies but this movie is anything but.

The Good: The performances given by the actors are pretty solid. The action sequences that there are play well and are entertaining to watch with the exception of the scenes that are way over the top.

The Bad: Quentin Tarantino needs to let go of the 70's. I am sure he had a great time in the 70's and feels very nostalgic while looking back but I am willing to bet that the larger portion of the regular movie going population doesn't share his sentiment. His force feeding it down the throats of movie goers doesn't work. An example would be that the story opens up following around a group of 20ish girls as they go to a bar. Not once is a modern song played or listened to by the group and there are a lot of songs played. I am supposed to believe that a group of young girls hangs out all night and not one modern song played? They get in a car to leave and again we get something on the radio from days gone by. It all just feels a little ""Trying too hard"" to me and not believable.

I understand that this was something of an homage to the old 70's grind house movies. Honoring old films is fine however the movie needs to be able to stand on its own and not simply be just an homage. This move can't stand alone. If Quentin feels the need to devote so much attention to these types of movie why doesn't he try making a documentary?

I don't see the need in intentionally adding in ""Missing reel"" scenes, the rough editing and the worn look of the film. I get it, you are trying to create a feel, but it just doesn't work and again feels like he is trying too hard. Essentially he was trying to make a bad movie and in this he succeeded and some are calling him a genius for it. I am of the opinion that a bad movie is a bad movie whether or not you intended to make it that way.

The story overall was extremely boring. 75% of the movie is devoted to the conversations of 4 women none of whom had any redeeming qualities with almost nothing of interest to say with the ending of the movie being the ultimate ""Girl power"" moment. I have no problem with strong female characters but they have to be done the right way and these weren't.

Overall: I could go on an on about how poor this movie is. A boring story coupled with annoying characters and a poor attempt at force fed nostalgia. I honestly believe that Quentin Tarantino could film a dog fertilizing a lawn, sell people tickets for $9.50 and people would call him a cinematic genius. If Quentin had put this move out using a pseudonym the same people propping up this film would be tearing it down.

2860796,1,B000R7HY0K,"This review is a spoiler for one simple reason: I don't think anyone should ever see this movie. I simply cannot understand the high reviews this movie received from various websites, not to mention my friends. I feel that it was completely pointless. If, for some reason, you actually liked this movie, please feel free to comment as to why.

First off, I had high hopes. There were good reviews, my friends liked it, and Tarantino has directly the occasional good movie. I am also a big fan of Kurt Russell. Well, Kurt has been in some stinkers, and Quentin has directed some real dogs. This is both of them at their worst.

Let's start with the total lack of plot. Girls go out to party. Bad guy has crash resistant stunt man car. He crashes into them and kills them all because he's messed up in the head. Local Sherriff thinks he's a bad guy but can't prove it. End of act one. Act two: repeat. Except this time he picks the wrong party girls to mess with. They shoot and wound him. He cries like Nancy Kerrigan and tries to escape, wailing that he's sorry and he didn't mean it. They make him crash, drag him from his car and beat him to death. The end.

It takes two painful hours to tell this story that I typed in less than a minute. The worst part is that they set up Kurt to be a ""cool"" bad guy, and then turn him into a sniveling little wimp in the second half. Lame, lame, lame.

I realize that this movie is trying to do a 70s thriller camp thing, but the writing is awful. The dialogue rambles on aimlessly and reveals nothing about the story. Real people don't talk anything remotely like they do in this movie. The dialogue is about as genuine as a twenty dollar Superbowl ticket and everyone talks at hyper speeds while absolutely nothing happens. There is so much nonsensical blather going on I'm certain they killed extra trees in printing off the script.

All of the characters are annoying. The women aren't even good looking. In the first half, the one that looks half decent (Rose McGowan) gets stuck in some hideous wig, and this is magnified by the fact that I could never consider a woman who was married to Marilyn Manson attractive. She's tainted for life because of that. Rosario Dawson's infamous lap dance scene has her belly hanging out so far she looks like she is entering her second trimester. In the second half there is one nice looking woman (Lee), but she plays an insignificant role. The others are so annoying I actually want Kurt Russell to kill them, but he turns into a pansy and gets killed by them instead.

There is one character who swears like she is trying to be a female version of Samuel L. Jackson, but she fails miserably. The only person who can do Sam Jackson is Sam Jackson, so don't even try. I was disappointed when she and her annoying friends didn't die.

The one minor redeeming quality of this move was Kurt in the first half. He was mildly interesting. Instead of expanding on that for the second half they turned him into sissy. Maybe Planet Terror will be better.",1194220800,13,3030,4.419354838709677
2860797,3,B000R7HY0K,"OK I like Tarrentino movies but they are getting a little too similar.

The dialog in the movie is totally pointless.  Yes thanks Q for trying to give us a sense of who these girls are, so we care about them when you crash your car into them.  But it seems so forced.  I know you are doing it.

I'm also getting tired of snuff flicks.  What's the point besides desensatizing us.  I think these directors want us to be ok with the idea of people being tortured and butchered.

Anyways, when the movie FINALLY gets to the action it's pretty good.  You may as well just go to those scenes.  There is absolutely no point in the rest of the movie.",1194134400,5,642,4.188524590163935

From noon Saturday to noon Sunday we show movies  upstairs and down on projection screens, so you get a nice, near theater experience. We start with a cartoon feature of some sort and usually have about eleven movies each. We schedule them to oppose one another to force our guests to chose one over another. This year we plan to oppose Star Wars and Indiana Jones. Last year Batman Begins and Superman Returns. We have a commercial popcorn popper, serve a dinner and a breakfast, have door prizes at midnight (including a choice of time slot for next year) and have about 65 guests on average, many of whom stay all night. Many bring sleeping bags, etc. Anyway, from the moment I first saw Grindhouse I knew I wanted to show it at my ""Film Festival"". But chopped up into two films like this it is not the same experience that it was at the cinema and I just can't do it. They were fine films but without the extra material included they are just more horror movies, good... but I can't justify showing them to as broad an audience as my party because the trailers and intros and all the old time theater stuff ties it all together and makes it work as something different.

Especially after seeing Rodriguezs brilliant Planet Terror and some hilarious faux trailers. People in the theater were sighing and a few left during it. Only the last fifteen minutes is even worth looking at. Finally some action. Even the witty Tarantino dialogue isn't here. Watch Planet Terror and skip this one!",1193961600,12,490,4.64367816091954
2860800,4,B000R7HY0K,"My four-star rating in the end might be a little generous, but two top-notch elements in ""Death Proof"" prevent me from giving it a lukewarm three stars: Kurt Russell's tour-de-force performance as Stuntman Mike- where he effortlessly moves between cocky/cool, menacing, whiny, and finally, hilariously cowardly- and that uber-cool car battle at the end, as stunt gals take on stunt-psycho for the road-ruling crown.  You have to see this movie for those elements.  Trust me, it's worth sitting through the handful of endless girl-chat scenes to get to them.

Ultimately I think I prefer the shorter, tighter cut of ""Death Proof"" that originally appeared in the double-feature theatrical presentation, ""Grindhouse"", though two extra scenes in this longer cut were fun: the notorious lap-dancing scene dangled before us but not delivered in the theaters (instead we got the frustrating practical joke of an apologetic, three-second ""missing reel"" insert card) and a black-and-white interlude at a convenience store that creepily sets the tone for Stuntman Mike's stalking of the second set of girls.  But otherwise I didn't notice anything else of note to justify the added length.

Hmmmm, what else to say about this eccentric little DVD? The extra features are entertaining and well done... lots of behind-the-scenes stuff that's fun to see.  And the extras again remind us how enthusiastic Mr. Tarantino is on the set, for a minute making us think that the movie is better than we're giving it credit for.  For a minute.  And, oh yeah... because the movie's closing credits have been redone to excise music and credits for ""Planet Terror"" (the other half of the original ""Grindhouse""), you get some interesting musical additions to replace that stuff, most notably a longer version- featuring a few foreign language verses- of the infectious ""Chick Habit"", performed by April March (the soundtrack album only has the shorter, all-English version of the song).  A small plus but a good one.

""Death Proof"" is certainly a lot of fun, and I'm glad I own it on DVD, but for my money, the two ""Kill Bill"" movies are still Mr. Tarantino's best grindhouse-style projects to date.  But, make no mistake, you still have to give this fuel-injected little thriller a look.",1193875200,,2262,5.102981029810298
2860811,5,B000R7HY0K,"Quentin Tarantino tells a great story, great stunts, Kurt Russel at his best, great female actors, fast story, Zoe Bell at her best.... great entertainment!",1193702400,,156,5.28
2860812,5,B000R7HY0K,"Quentin Tarantino's contribution to the ""Grind House"" project is nothing short of a mile-a-minute thrill ride.  From beginning to end, it's just nonstop excitement, and tons of fun.  It's a bit more straight-forward than your average QT film.  The plot is pretty simple, and doesn't skip around chronologically, and the experimental camera effects are kept to a minimum (with only a grainy, retro-70's picture quality, and one scene that inexplicably switches to black and white).  However, most of the usual ""Tarantisms"" are there, like the excellent dialogue and random pop culture references, the campy, over-the-top violence, and of course the obligatory nod to Quentin's foot fetish.

So, the story we have here is about a fellow named Stuntman Mike, a crazed ex-stunt driver who preys upon young women, using as his weapon of choice a tricked-out muscle car that is 100% ""death proof""....at least to him, anyway.  Mike carves a bloody trail across the countryside, until he meets his match in a group of young stuntwomen with a few skills of their own.  What ensues is one of the greatest car chases I have ever seen, right up there with the famous train scene in ""The French Connection"".  It's surprisingly long, but never too long.  Even more amazing is the incredible Zoe Bell, who actually spends half of this scene clinging to the hood of a speeding car that is wildly careening and colliding with the other vehicle.  This is one tough chick.

And of course Kurt Russell is fantastic as Mike.  He's creepy and terrifying, yet still oddly likable.  With all the more family-oriented movies he's been moving toward in the past few years, it's really great to see him play this type of role again.  He may be getting up there in age, but he's definitely still got it.

Yep, this one is highly recommended for sure.  It probably won't be winning any Oscars, but it's a fun action flick that never feels mindless or dumb.  I was disappointed that this one and ""Planet Terror"" weren't released as a single package, but oh well.  Either way, this one's definitely worth checking out.",1193616000,,2087,4.8474576271186445

And where did that motorcyclist come from and what happened to him? And why didn't the girls use that iron bar some more?

2860814,5,B000R7HY0K,I expected to like Terror Planet better of the two Grindhouse films. I wasn't even sure I was going to buy Death Proof. In the end I liked the movie Death Proof BETTER than Terror Planet. I really felt like I was watching an old movie at a theater in the 70s when I watched this. I didn't feel like I was watching an old movie when I watched Terror Planet.,1193529600,,356,4.028169014084507
2860815,3,B000R7HY0K,"At first I didn't want to buy the movie because 1) I thought Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror was much better, both in terms of action and the homage to the old grindhouse films, and 2) I was one of the people who wanted to boycott the DVD until it was release together with Planet Terror. However, I had a Best Buy giftcard, so I figured what the hell and bought it.
The movie itself is actually better than I remember it (maybe because, after watching one 2-hour movie late at night, you're about ready to fall asleep :) The car chase sequence is amazing. Though it's not up there with Bullitt or Vanishing Point, it's good enough, and it's still better than the computer-generated crap put out now. Also, a lot of the dialogue is more interesting and funnier than I remember (although anyone wanting to hear classic Tarantino dialogue (philosophical, vulgar, and funny at the same time) needs to watch Pulp Fiction). Overall, I would give the movie itself 4 out of 5 stars.
However, the only thing the DVD does right is including the lap dance scene that was omitted from the theater. That's about it. The previews are gone (you can't even watch them in the Special Features menu), and there's not a whole lot else added to the movie despite the claim on the box. Based on losing the awesome previews alone (WTF, Quentin!), the DVD is a 1 out of 5 stars. Hopefully Robert Rodriguez included his previews in Planet Terror.",1193443200,,1424,4.56640625

It was such a great idea and I thought that fun, cheezy, low-budge, violent, and sexy movies would be back. What happened to the B-movie? When did everyone get so serious?

2860819,5,B000R7HY0K,"Again Tarantino delivers another excellent film, with great character development and butt-clenching suspense. Already I have seen this film eight times and I have not got sick of it yet.

This extended edition has a few additions and changes. Here is a rundown: *minor spoilers*
- The first scene in the car with Jungle Julia, Shanna and Butterfly is longer, with a few extra lines here and there.
- After the scene at Guero's, there is a moment where Stuntman Mike watches the girls stumble out.
- Butterfly's lap dance scene
- Kim, Lee and Abernathy are introduced by Stuntman Mike driving into a parking lot. What follows is a reasonably large black and white sequence. This scene further develops these three girls characters, especially Lee.
- The scene in which Stuntman Mike photographs the girls has been extended, and accompanied by music that intensifies the disturbing nature of the scene.
- A few jokes and lines have been changed in the car, before the girls get Breakfast.

The DVD features are surprisingly good for a Tarantino feature. Perhaps the most interesting is a featurette explaining how they did the car crashes in the film. Also, the trailer for the documentary on Double Dare made me get out the film: which was excellent (it contains more making footage on Kill Bill than I have ever seen, among other things).

All in all, it is a great buy and well worth a watch for those who have not seen it. Perhaps a slightly more slow pace Tarantino film: but hey, nothing like having a little patience to put up with artistic beauty.

In Death Proof, Quentin continues his string of strong women protagonists (Jackie Brown, Kill Bill) and these chicks are a blast!  Kurt Russell is a hoot as the bad guy.  As you would expect, the film is full of pop culture and movie references and even reminders of Tarantino's own other films.  This movie moves along breezily, propelled by Tarantino's dialogue.  The big shocking scene, which I won't spoil, continues to shock no matter how many times you watch it (and I backed up 3-4 times and rewatched it both times I watched this movie).

That is especially the case here, the first 1 hour and 10 mins or so is flawless homage, beautiful girls, great tunes, weed, Kurt Russell as Stuntman Mike and Michael Parks in an amazing sheriff cameo.  Very entertaining and self indulgent but perfect in setting that bar in the rain ambiance.  Then the second hour where for some reason he drops the entire GRINDHOUSE look after a B/W scene.  I don't know why he didn't leave the grimy film effect throughout the entire thing they are in the same time period and it is off putting somewhat.  If he meant to draw a line between the two halves he suceeded, but the girls aren't as fun to watch until the big finale and it doesn't fly by like the first hour.  I suppose the two halves represent the male/female fantasy viewpoint, and maybe Kurt Russell is really just daydreaming until he runs into the girls in the second half.

The second best part was ""Planet Terror"".  You have to have a high tolerance for gore to ""enjoy"" it but it is fast moving and overstuffed with ideas drawn from the grindhouse/horror genre.
By far, the weakest, dullest part of ""Grindhouse"" was ""Death Proof"".  It is a Tarantino trade-mark to have characters engage in pop culture discussions, but in his good films that dialog is woven into the ACTION!  In ""DP"" it's 20 minutes talking- 2 minutes action- 40 minutes talking- 15 minutes action.  Even in the theatrical cut ""DP"" dragged.  They sure as hell didn't need to make it longer. There weren't enough ideas to sustain a 70 minute film, much less an extended version.  Also, the car stunts are not impressive.  The girl on the hood was tense but other than that it's pretty much ""Dukes Of Hazard""(TV series) quality.  I liked Kurt Russell's performance and some of the girls were cute.

2860839,3,B000R7HY0K,"Quentin Tarantino and bloodshed. The two seem to go hand-in-hand. From&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reservoir-Dogs/dp/B00008975Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reservoir Dogs</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/From-Dusk-Till-Dawn/dp/1558908455/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">From Dusk Till Dawn</a>, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Bill/dp/B00005JMEW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Bill</a>&nbsp;duet (One and Two), and now the GRINDHOUSE couplet (DEATH PROOF and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Terror/dp/B000XASD1K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Terror</a>), Mr. Tarantino likes to play with crimson. And he sometimes does it very well.

What makes Death Proof watchable is its homage to the drive-in days of early technicolor when scratchy editing and concession stand intermissions were commonplace. The story itself is fairly unremarkable (with the exception of Kurt Russell's performance as Stuntman Mike, a psychotic, out-of-work, stuntman who has girl issues for no apparent reason). His mood swings from depression to exhilaration are done well and mark him as the crux that holds Death Proof together.

The ""Tarantino Girls"" are sure to be eye-candy for most male watchers, their languorously long legs and tight Daisy-Duke shorts being a bit overly focused upon. Although this is what makes Tarantino films appealing, especially when harkening back to the 70's when big hair and revealing clothing were making their way into the mainstream.

And what Tarantino flick would be complete without some cool cars. Souped-up Nova's and Dodge Challengers are indicative of the times (the 70s), a time we're supposed to find ourselves reminiscing about. But Tarantino fails to continue on the right path and veers out of control.

Cell phones pop up in the second act of Death Proof and pull us away from the first (the second act takes place less than two years after the first). I had to ask myself exactly ""when"" we were. Confusing us further, the Dodge Challenger that the girls go check out is designated ""a classic,"" yet, again, the second act (which is where this happens) takes place only 14 months after the first.

Kurt Russell's Stuntman Mike is creepy and funny, and it is his hysterically frightening performance that pulls Death Proof up a notch. His stalking of the pretty girls is spooky, while his later encounters with them are laughable ...and sometimes sexy.

The car crash scenes involving the classic Dodges is sure to make MOPAR owners cringe, each crunch of metal on metal eliciting a screeching quality from the cars themselves and those who love these rare vehicles.

The girls in both episodes are great looking gals: Zoe Bell, Rosario Dawson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Guide-to-Recognizing-Your-Saints/dp/B000KB489I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints</a>), Vanessa Ferlito (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/24/dp/B00005JLF2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">24</a>), Sydney Tamiia Poitier, Tracie Toms (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Devil-Wears-Prada/dp/B000J103PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Devil Wears Prada</a>), Rose McGowan, Jordan Ladd, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead (BOBBY) round out the leggy women whom Kurt Russell's character harasses ...but not the way he intended in the end.

This is a modestly entertaining film, if only for its sentimental value for those who spent time at the drive-in a few decades ago, or for Kurt Russell fans. If you're a diehard Tarantino-ite, you might find it enjoyable as well. But for mainstream audiences, this one might crash and burn.

Sometimes Terrintino's style, such as the diner conversation where Vincent is describing McDonald's, the Metric system, and Mayo on fries, is entertaining.  These little diversions, the director attempting to show off what he considers to be a creative style, are cute once and a while.  Like adding some salt to a Celery stick. Makes it real tasty. Or adding Mayo to fries. Death Proof? He dipped the celery in a salt bath, used it as a salt scoop,  piled on more salt, and kept on going.  I'd rather force down that briny treat than watch this waste of photons.

Picture that quite entertaining dinette table banter.  Now make an entire movie like that. Throw in 2 minutes of action every 20 minutes. Stick a fun chase scent at the end. Then add a real pathetic ending.  Look, I saw plenty of ""grind house"" flicks. The film quality was never as bad as is faked in this POS - and the audio was much worse!

2860860,2,B000R7HY0K,"Although Quentin Tarantino is without doubt a very talented writer and director, this film, it must be said, is a disappointment. It is clear from Kill Bill volumes 1 and 2 that Tarantino has a tendency to pander to his own whims in a way that is cinematically damaging. However in 'Death Proof' this pandering to whims turns into full blown self indulgence.

Most cinema goers have long been fans of the marvellous Tarantino dialogue that became the stuff of legends during the days of 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Reservoir Dogs'. However here that exact same dialogue is used as a crutch to drag audiences through a film that lacks anything more solid.

One thing that becomes patently obvious among this ubiquitous dialogue style is that Tarantino can only really write one type of female character. Although the icy-gazed, sass-mouthed, cold-hearted young woman character has served him well in many movies, it becomes somewhat tedious when multiplied by 7 in 'Death Proof'.

The central plotline would be a lot more compelling if it were not basically the same 45 minute plotline shown twice. It must also be said that there are too many frills and not enough body to it. To disappointed Tarantino fans I would say don't worry. One bad film does not mean he has lost his spark and I, for one, am sure that he will be back with something far more worthwhile.",1192406400,6,1354,4.753191489361702

I do wish some of the parody trailers that I heard so much about were included in with the DVD and to be honest I think their ommission is rather tacky. However, Death Proof is an outstanding flick. Honestly since Resevoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, I have found most Tarantino movies to be forgettable. Maybe I'm just tired of movies about thugs. Death Proof is a refreshing change. The build up is slow but well worth it. There is no real action in the first half hour but it sets up the movie perfectly. The cinematography is nothing short of brilliant. By the time the action starts the viewer is at once ready for it and totally surprised by it. The final battle between the Challenger and the Charger is destined to rank in the top 5 car chase scenes of all time. I haven't seen action that good since the Road Warrior. When so many car chases/stunts look fake due to the overuse of CG it's nice to see one that goes back to the basics.  There are a couple of moments that are stomach churning but the movie is more than worth the price. I firmly believe it ranks right up there with Mad Max, the Road Warrior (well nothing is really the equal of the Road Warrior, but it's close) and Vanishing Point (which the movie pays tribute to).

2860873,1,B000R7HY0K,"I thought I was a fan of Quentin Tarantino's work....but this film makes me question that notion.  I have all his other films (Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, etc.)....as well as a few other films he was involved with (Natual Born Killers, True Romance, etc.) and I pretty-much liked them all.... that is until Death Proof came along.

First of all, let me say....Ok, I get it!  Quentin Tarantino likes the idea of ""eavesdropping"" on other people's conversations.  If you're unfamiliar with this Tarantino-staple, you get to hear the simultaeously mundane and profound conversations of the characters in his movies.

This is generally used to (and I hate to use this term because the subjects of a certain western-European island-nation overuse it...but it's appropriate here) brilliant effect in his films....particularly in Resevior Dogs and Pulp Fiction.

Think of watching a Tarantino film as like watching ""Diner"", but with more gun-play (and F-bombs!).

Anyway, QT goes way overboard in this film along those lines....and other than one brief action-sequence (and the odd smoky burn-out now and again), the first 3/4 of the film is, as others have pointed-out here, BORE-RING!

Yes, the sound-track is good, but that is standard-fair for Tarantino anyway.

As to the final car-chase, there's little if anything here that hasn't been done before...speeding, bumping, person-on-the-hood...<yawns>.  You'd be better-off watching (take your pick) Bullitt, The Seven-Ups, Vanishing Point, Dirty Mary/Crazy Larry, etc. again.

  **Spoiler Alert**

And how the Kurt Russell-character goes from being a World-by-the-B**LS tough-guy to a sniveling sissy in about 5 seconds is really irratating (it was only a flesh-wound!).  :-)

Also, there were numerous times the girls could have stopped their car and let the girl off the hood.  No more risk of girl flying off, no more danger from the road-pycho (i.e. Russell)....especially since the driver of the Challenger had a gun (and Russell, apparently, did not)!

In summary, I'm glad I didn't waste my money buying this film.  Hopefully QT's next film will be back up to his usual standards.",1192233600,8,2130,5.285714285714286

Sorry, you won't find this kind of stuff on YouTube, if that's what you're basing your opinions on. Hey I'm glad to be in the minority here, b/c I think Robert Rodriguez sucks and so many people loved sin city.",1192233600,2,631,4.431034482758621
2860875,3,B000R7HY0K,"A tough-guy killer turns out not to be so tough when the tables are turned against him by some even tougher women. The whole idea of a grindhouse film is that it is supposed not to make a lot of sense as a story, except that the story serves as a justification for the guilty pleasure in the form of titillation, both violent and sexy. It is supposed to be a kind of throwaway effort, something that is thrown together as cheaply as possible as long as there are beautiful people and violent gimmicks you've never seen before as a draw.

The best grindhouse films have something extra, a bit of social commentary, or an existential theme (facing death suddenly and unexpectedly never fails to elicit, at least obliquely, some questions about authenticity and the meaning of life), or some kind of payback to the audience that turns their own pleasures against them (e.g. if the film begins by titillating a male audience by exploiting women and ends by turning the tables having a woman turn tough on her assailant). In that respect, Tarantino has done exactly what he aimed for -- the film is fun and funny, it adds to the grindhouse theme his trademark witty dialogue, and turns the hunter into the hunted. Tarantino knows his stuff, he obviously loves this kind of thing, and you feel his excitement. His own cameo and the cameo of Eli Roth didn't really work for me, but I know this is his game and his world and we just get to watch I guess.

That is the problem, though, with Tarantino's films: increasingly, and this film seems one more step in this direction, they are becoming insular and narrow depictions of a very clever filmmaker's obsessions, not with truth or beauty or meaning or value or justice or any of the things that the greatest of filmmakers who Tarantino admires but can't approach are after, but merely with the various delights of visceral cinema. As an eclectic film lover I can share and appreciate those delights, and definitely enjoy the ride, but leave from watching his films and definitely this film feeling as if I'd gotten nowhere -- to draw a pretentious metaphor from the central cinematic allusion from this film, what I get from his films is not transcendence but merely empty and gas guzzling mileage toward the vanishing point on a highway that never ends and never gets anywhere. Of course Tarantino never seems to pretends or aspires to more than that -- and I think he'd say, sure you won't get anywhere, but enjoy the ride, at least in this film -- but to some degree you have to measure the greatness of a director by the greatness of his aspirations. I'm not sure ""wild and crazy, witty and demented and scary fun"" (not to knock that in any way) is the highest of aspirations ... but I've never really seen much more in Tarantino's films and this film in particular.

Kurt Russel in one of his better roles with a really nice car outfitted for stuntdriving and murder. that sounds cool right? if you said yes then you will probably be dissapointed with what happens next. more of nothing. granted this time it is a bit more interesting and the characters are acctualy likeable. this still takes longer than it should but at least it's tolerable. and then the best role ever gets his balls handed to him. i am mad.
  i am a huge film buff and through my years i have seen some wierd movies (from beyond, versus, the great yokai war, blood thirst, the satanic rights of dracula ect.). i gave this movie 3 stars insead of 1 or 0 for 3 reasons. first, this was exactly what it was supposed to be. anyone who has seen old grindhouse movies can attest to the fact that more ften than not they were pretty bad, and this was pretty bad. secondly Kurt Russel, though underused, was really very good and the role was well written. third the cinamatography and directing was probably the best i have seen from QT yet. it was beautiful. now here are a couple reasons i gave it 3 stars instead of 5. first need i say it again? NOTHING HAPPENS FOR 45 MINUTES. second, i hated the characters in the first segment. now when i say hate right there i don't just mean a general dislike, i mean that if i acctualy knew these people i would go to any means to be as far away from them as possible. i would also like to punch them. third, such a good idea... such a good writer, directer, and cinematographer... such a terrible execution. and fourth, though i enjoyed it, i will never voluntarily see this movie again. i have seen it twice and that is enough for me.

Look, I think we've all been reading Amazon reviews long enough to know that there are some really unbright people watching movies.

As I write this, ""Death Proof"" has a 3 star rating. That's insane. This is the best stuff I've seen in months. What a soundtrack. Great ironic dialogue. Superb video violence.

This movie is fantastic. You're going to be thrilled, believe me.
The movie is about a Stuntman called Mike Mckay and his special death proof car. The action sequences are extremely visceral and well made, made for real with no CGI and fake crap.

A lot of people complain about the dialogs, of course in usual Tarantino manner, but I taught it was pretty awesome and it don't affect the pace of the movie. On the contrary, I was entertained during the whole time.

Kurt Russell is outstanding in his role and just watching him act will worth the price of admission. He was, of course, the right choice for the role. As most critics said he's having a lot of fun and playing around with his cinema icon status. You can feel his presence during the whole movie, and he actually is almost in every scene...you can see him several times in the background of some key talking scenes.

I was actually rooting for him the whole movie and was sad when HE DIED with his head smashed by Rosario Dawson's character Abernathy (Abbie).

Kurt Russell was in it but I have to feel he has fallen on hard times to have taken this acting job. This was not close to the standard or quality of his other movies I've seen and enjoyed. If you liked Russell before don't buy this DVD.

As to the car chase it was at best amateurish with scenes cutting out just before the car actually crashes, cars doing things that just can't be done (radiators can not withstand the beating given etc).

The only remotely credible actors are Kurt Russell, who seems to realize that he's in an awful movie and hams it up accordingly, and Rosario Dawson, who at leasts sounds like a real person. The worst offenders are the black lady driver, who sounds about as tough as Sarah Silverman when she's talking like Sammy Jackson, and Zoe Bell, who needs acting lessons badly. Tarantino gives us no reason to feel bad for the first group of gals--they're catty and obnoxious--and no reason to believe that the second group would go after Stuntman Mike. The ending is laughable as the gals suddenly morph into Charlie's Angels. Despite all its faults, the movie isn't a complete washout.

Here's my thing with Death Proof, it is a nice seventies homage, but its mostly just all talk, Tarantino style. and while this is entertaining after awhile, it gets pretty boring after the initial pass. however, i must say then when the action does happen, it is well worth it, the last thirty minutes or so being not only thrilling but hilarious at the same time.
Death Proof has a relativly simple plot. a deranged stunt man who stalks his victoms and then kills them with his car. Russell obviously has fun with the role and all the 'girls' have there own fun with the roles their given, especially Zoe Bell and Tracie Thoms.
My other complaint is that, i don't know what exactly happened, but somewhere along the line, the whole grittiness and beat up method used in the movie sort of got lost in the second half. Why this happened, i'm not sure, but its just something that sort of disconnects me from the movie.
And finally, about the whole splitting up the film thing, i'm not bothered about it much. But i am bothered that they've cut out the trailers, now see i loved those, i thought they were inventive, funny, and just a blast to watch, escpecially Thanksgiving, so hilarious!

Secondly, this is the ""Extended and unrated, 2 disc, special edition"" yet the fake movie previews (that I felt were an important part of the movie)are nowhere to be found on either disc! That's why I'm giving this 2 stars.

As for the movie itself, I liked ""Planet Terror"" better than ""Death Proof"". Death Proof, is a good movie but A LOT  of the dialogue between the girls is EXHAUSTING. Kurt Russell is fantastic as Stuntman Mike! I'd like to see him take on more villainous roles. The stunts are spectacular! They don't make movies like these anymore and I praise QT for bringing this style of movie making back into the light. I noticed 2 main differences between this extended version and the theatrical version. One is that we now get to see the missing lap dance footage in the bar. It's a good scene but i think it added to the charm of the movie when it was missing. Also we get to see when Stuntman Mike finds the second group of girls. This scene should not have been left out of the theater. For one it's a really good scene shot in Black and white, and secondly it provides knowledge to the viewer that is helpful in putting the whole film together.

I give the movie itself 3 1/2 stars. I really like everything, but the overdone dialogue DOES take it's tole on the film. I know that is a signature of Tarantino but this is too much and it's kind of getting old.",1191715200,3,1589,4.361486486486487
2860903,3,B000R7HY0K,"I saw ""Grindhouse"" twice in theaters and it still remains one of my top movie going experiences of 2007. Both Tarantino's ""DEATH PROOF"" and Rodriguez's ""PLANET TERROR"" are amazingly fun and amazingly flawed movies, but when mashed together in a faux double feature with faux trailers was awesome.

But DEATH PROOF and PLANET TERROR as standalone movies? Eh, not so much. DEATH PROOF is kind of Tarantino's swan song / love song to himself. Every thing is a reference to everything else. True, Tarantino made his bones on the backs of ""homages"", but when he starts recreating his own famous movie moments (for instance almost a shot for shot redux of RESERVOIR DOGS' diner scene) he just seems like a director out of gas. His dialogue just drags on too long and becomes even the geekiest of film geeks. The storytelling is just plain rough and jumpy.

The last twenty minutes of DEATH PROOF are incredible and sad. Sad because you realized DEATH PROOF could've been a lot more than what Tarantino end up making.

Really, ""GRINDHOUSE"" is not the same split up onto two DVDs and marketed as two seperate movies. The appeal and novelity are gone. Normally I don't mind the Studio DVD double dip, but this time around it feels like the Weinstein COmpany is simply butchering a great film experience to make some money. Why not at least offer a special collector's edition of GRINDHOUSE with both the theatrical cut and the special editions of both films on four discs? I know I would've gladly paid $60 for that.

Personally, I'd pass until the Weinstein Company smartens up and puts out a collector's edition of GRINDHOUSE. Neitherthe Death Proof or Planet DVD is really worth full price since all you are getting is half a movie concept.",1191628800,,1734,4.750830564784053

I tolerated the whole 3hr+ thing on opening night, but when I sit down to watch a movie at home, I know that I won't be able to sit through the whole thing again, so the split will be perfect. The dvd is packed with extra stuff to satisfy, and the movie itself is awesome, in my opinion. The character development is fantastic and interesting, and this is coming from a guy that usually likes when movies get to the point.

2860908,5,B000R7HY0K,"[sound of blowing] ""uhh... hello?  this thing on?  Alright I want everybody in the entire world to stop what they're doing and pay close attention.  Cause I just got something to say to you.  And it goes a little something like this:  Deathproof is not a perfect movie.  It is a blend of a genius premise and a flawed execution.  The women in the movie are all extremely vulgar and grating, unintentionally I believe.  And this is the poor execution that mars the fantastic premise of a guy that mows down a bunch of women with his car -- himself being hospitalized thereafter -- then, as a sort of cosmic irony, is himself busted up real bad by ANOTHER bunch of chicks who kill him with karate moves, right out there on the two-lane blacktop.  This premise is so absurd, so completely, laughably preposterous, so INCONSEQUENTIAL that it is true art.  Deathproof is full of inconsequentiality just as TOP HAT is.  And it, in it's own way, approaches the same ether-sphere of artistic heaven.  Tarantino, through vulgar execution, falls just short of true art in the finished product... but he's definitely a hip, not a square.  And nowadays, the squares they are so many.  And the hips they are so few.  What is it to be a hip?  Is it to wear your pants falling down and your hat on backward and some sunglasses MTV told you to wear?  Hardly.  To be a hip is to see things from a special angle.  The sixties were a failed hip revolution because of the basic flawed implicit idea that the hip perspective and economy can be mass-produced with the aid of psychedelic drugs.  There's nothing wrong with psychedelic drugs, but they don't turn a square into a hip.  Nothing can.  What's that?  What is a square?  Very simple:  A square is a person who, deep down, has no sense of humor.  No, not the kind of humor where you watch Jackass and laugh when the guy does something stupid.  I'm talking about a cosmic sense of humor.  It is this cosmic sense of humor that lets the hip see that at some basic level life is just a riff and a routine, full of buzz and kick and verve.  But the square, he can't see that.  He can't see it even if he's decked out in all the hipster trimmings, over-urbanized, over-socialized, over-surface-ized.  True hips are very rare.  Back in the old days, even the hips were still basically squares.  And real hips, you may not agree with all they come out with.  But you've got to admire it.  Mozart was a hip, though I don't really dig his music all that special.  Stendahl was a hip, Burroughs was a hip, Hunter S. Thompson was a hip.  They all had that basic, cosmic unseriousness that is what transcends this life and reaches into the world beyond.  See, you can't get out of this world with seriousness alone.  And that's where so many religious seekers go wrong.  They think enlightenment can exist without humor.  But it can't.  And you know the old saying, ""the Lord moves in mysterious ways""?  Well, that's just another way of saying that God is a hip.  And if you can't see the joke, can't roll with the punches from that special angle and unlock from yourself just a bit, you could be religious as all get-out but you'll still just be a locked-in square.  So Tarantino, I don't like all your stuff, but I dig the basic groove you're laying down.  And I see that it's a hip groove; and that you're not a square.",1191456000,,3346,4.438220757825371

My issues are not with the film presented here.  It's how it is presented.  What made Grindhouse so awesome was the experience of seeing it in theaters as a double bill, with the fake ads and trailers and all that came with it.  These DVDs of Death Proof and Planet Terror completely take the film out of the context it was meant to be seen.

One final gripe: I don't think the ""missing reel"" should have been inserted onto this DVD.  It was one of the best jokes in the whole film.",1191456000,3,580,4.218181818181818

2860924,1,B000R7HY0K,"I have a friend who swears by Quentin Tarantino.  Regular readers of my reviews will note that I was disgusted by the violence and nihilism of Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" movies.  Why, you may be asking, have I spent nearly two hours of my time watching ""Death Proof""?  Simple: Kurt Russell is a fox.  And my friend sort of made me watch it (in order to get a free meal).

So imagine my confusion when I realized Kurt Russell is practically absent from the movie.  It's true!  The man only has maybe one-quarter of the total screentime.  What a rip!

With only a few exceptions, this movie is (thankfully) free of the mind-numbing, soul-crushing, hedonistic violence that is such a hallmark of Tarantino's horrid filmography.  But the endless profanity more than makes this one unsuitable for church parties.

The movie is basically two segments - the first half and the second half.  And only the first half has the ""grindhouse"" look (i.e. intentionally grainy look, scratches, missing footage).  The second half looks like any other crappy movie.  Oh, and there is a pointless black and white segment dividing the two halfs.

Basically my feeling is that his is Tarantino's attempt at making a ""chick flick"" - how else can all the inane girl-talk be accounted for?  I'm not kidding when I say that more than half the movie's running time is given to meaningless chit chat.

If I want to see character development, I will watch a movie with Anthony Hopkins and/or Emma Thompson.

Please ignore the rave reviews by the Tarantino lemmings.  I lose more respect for Quentin Tarantino after each movie directs.  He is just a step away from directing the next Pauly Shore movie.

As far as the minimal action is concerned, kudos to the stunt drivers, but I felt as if I was watching a rerun of ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" series.

This movie mentions, and aspires to be, the same level of movie as ""Vanishing Point"" and ""Dirty Mary & Crazy Larry.""  ""Death Proof"" fails.

If you want to see a GREAT movie that shows a sense of speed in a car chase scene, watch ""Jeepers Creepers.""  (Francis Ford Coppola was an executive producer for that film.)

There is a reason this film went in & out of the theaters in the blink of an eye... it is truly bad.

Please do not be lured by the ""UNRATED"" aspect of this movie.  It is probably unrated because no one in the MPAA could stay awake til the end of the movie.

2860930,4,B000R7HY0K,"""Death Proof"" is Quentin Tarantino's contribution to ""Grindhouse"", where it was double-billed with Robert Rodriguez' ""Planet Terror"" and sandwiched between fake move trailers that recreated the exploitation film experience of the 1970s. ""Death Proof"" offers gruesome murders, bang-up car chases, and sexy women for the moviegoer who doesn't like a lot of context with his entertainment. Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) is a teetotalling, scar-faced killer who stalks and slays his pretty young victims with his souped-up death-proof stunt car.

Shot in natural tones and altered to look like a scratched, crackly print that has run through the projector too many times, cast with characters who smoke and drink carelessly and constantly, ""Grindhouse"" intermittently feels like nostalgia. But this is more than a homage to cruder days gone by. It sends up its own inspirations and shows us just why we like the unapologetic sex-violence dichotomy of B-movies. Cell phones and ATMs remind us that this is not a period film. The period is now; the style was then. The culture encompasses both, and indeed the entire modern era, which is why this is so fun to watch.

The Weinstein Company 2007 2-disc DVD set does not include any of the fake trailers that were part of ""Grindhouse""'s theatrical release. This version of ""Death Proof"" is 2 hours long, while the American theatrical double-bill version was only 90 minutes. The ""missing reel"" has been recovered, but 2 hours felt too long to me. 90 minutes cut short Tarantino's signature languishing on tawdry social scenes and catchy inane conversation. I guess there's no happy medium. But ""Death Proof"" is a surprisingly enjoyable tacky, violent romp that takes on a life of its own and engages the audience at some point.",1191110400,5,1768,5.135416666666667

2860935,5,B000R7HY0K,"First of all, I will say if you missed Death Proof and it's companion Planet Terror as the Grindhouse package in theaters, you really missed a fun cinema experience.  It's a shame that it couldn't have been marketed better, because it truly was a fun, cinema experience that is difficult to grasp for these two extremely different films.

However, Tarantino amazingly one-ups his own brilliance with Death Proof.  The two main reasons this is recommended:  Kurt Russell and Zoe Bell.

Kurt Russell turns in a bizarre, and dare I say Oscar-worthy performance as 'Stuntman Mike.' (I have no remote hopes he would ever be considered for a nod, however.  It's not a traditional 'Oscar' role.)  However, he plays a sexy, creepy, evil, spineless madman like no-one's business.

And Zoe Bell...if you haven't seen the film, she has 20 minutes near the end that will absolutely blow you away.  The fact it's clear that she did her own stunts will be enough of a thrill.  In a day and age where CGI has made the typical moviegoer very blase, Tarantino finding a stuntwoman who can act, (she has a charm that just jumps out of the screen) her work in this is literally jaw dropping.

The film, overall, is just plain fun.  It makes no attempts to deliver a solid plot.  It doesn't pretend to be something it's not.  It's a well-delivered tribute to 70's exploitation/muscle car films.  The ending is one of the best 'pay off's/in jokes' of any you will ever find.  (It's very in-keeping with old grindhouse-type films that were long on ideas but woefully short on budget.  lol).

It's got typical, wordy dialogue, the most amazing car chase scene you will EVER likely see, a balls-out performance by Kurt Russell that shows mastery in restraint and outright menace, cool cars, lots of titillation...in short, a great movie to have fun watching!",1191024000,2,1834,4.786624203821656
2860936,2,B000R7HY0K,"I was looking forward to seeing ""Grindhouse"" on my birthday.  When I got to the local cinema I found out they pulled it.  The given explanation was the Virginia Tech massacre but methinks it was audience apathy.  I ended up sipping wine coolers with my wife and watching ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" at home.  In retrospect that was a more pleasurable experience then watching ""Death Proof"".  I can't fathom it but Quentin Tarantino lost it here.  Maybe the flick would be best appreciated in it's truncated form in the context of ""Grindhouse"".  Maybe not.  Tarantino cites classic drive-in fare from the seventies as ""Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry"", ""Vanishing Point"" and ""Big Wednesday"".  Somebody should inform Quentin that the makers of those films just went out and made good movies without a hint of self consciousness.  In an interview with ""Entertainment Weekly"" Tarantino said he employed Kurt Russell to get him back to the Snake Plissken kind of roles.  Could have fooled me because Russell is virtually wasted here.  Tarantino's knack for writing crisp, witty dialogue is virtually absent here.  I heard a better reference to ""B.J. and the Bear"" on ""My Name is Earl"" the other night.  The only time I remotely chuckled was from a cell phone ring tone that referenced ""Kill Bill"".  The film's lone redeeming qualities are engaging performances from Rosario Dawson and Kiwi actress-stuntwoman Zoe Bell and one half decent car chase.  I have never disliked a Tarantino film until this one.  Here the self-indulgent qualities that were muted in his other films come out in full force.  Maybe Tarantino will learn from this misfire.",1191024000,7,1627,4.985130111524164
2860937,4,B000R7HY0K,"So this DVD wasn't released as a double feature along with ""Planet Terror."" Well boo-freakin'-hoo for all you fanboys out there who probably didn't bother to see ""Grindhouse"" in theaters in the first place. What the hell did you expect? ""Grindhouse"" - as inestimably cool as it was - was a box office disappointment! Contrary to what some reviewers here apparently believe, movie studios do not exist to appease tubby, sweaty-browed 40-year-old film geeks who live in their mothers' basements. Studios exist - from a financial perspective - to do something nobler than that. (Here's a hint: it rhymes with `make money.') Yes, I would like to have seen ""Grindhouse"" released as one set, trailers and all. But don't go blaming ""Death Proof"" for the fact that it wasn't. It's only fair, then, that we look at this movie for what it is rather than what its packaging isn't.

And what it is is easily one of the coolest, BEST movies of 2007. Of course it's talky! Have you folks never seen a Quentin Tarantino flick before? Unlike ""Planet Terror,"" which - self-aware as it is - sticks basically to the zombie flick formula, ""Death Proof"" careens between genres to come up with something not so easy to classify. It's a car chase flick/slasher movie/comedy/melodrama/morality play all at once. Sure, there are plenty of nods to the conventions of exploitation cinema past. But this is also an example of one of the rarest breeds of grindhouse films: it's an arthouse flick dressed down for a drive-in audience (think ""Two Lane Blacktop"" or the oft-referenced ""Vanishing Point."") It's not just a movie about a killer, a car and a bunch of hot women. To some extent, it's an exploitation movie about, well, exploitation movies. It's also an awful lot of fun, maybe even better on its own than as the second half of a double bill.

Of course, some of the charm of a movie like this may be lost on people who just flat don't know their exploitation films. The choppy edits and sound jumps are easy references to catch. But you know how Stuntman Mike eats his nachos in such disgusting fashion? Or the too-low, seemingly post-sync voice of hillbilly/mechanic Jasper? Or even the long stretches of dialog? These are the kinds of nods to Z-grade cinema that make ""Death Proof"" so much fun for fans of all things lowbrow. And with nods to his own films (a 1/10th second flash of the title strip for ""Miserlou"" on a jukebox, a mention of Big Kahuna Burger), Tarantino constantly reminds us that this ain't real life. It's life the way it tends only to exist in cinema, with thrill-killing villains and vengeful heroines willing to commit all manner of mayhem from behind the wheel of a souped-up muscle car. Or, as the classic tagline for ""Last House on the Left"" once put it, ""It's only a movie...only a movie...only a movie...""

THIS JUST IN...Sorry for adding to my initial review, but something occurred to me as I was looking over some other customer comments on this movie. I have to admit, I was a little surprised to see all the negative reviews here. But here's what I'm thinking. The BEST movies, music, books are often met with a mixed reaction from both fans and critics, at least initially. That is, in part I think, because they're different; they don't fit neatly into an expected/comfortable category. Think of a band like the Ramones who were so widely disdained through much of their career. It took a minority of hipsters years to convince the hoi polloi that this was a great, hugely important band. Or think of an album like ""Exile on Main Street"" - poorly reviewed upon its release, but now regarded as one of the Stones' best. Or, for a more recent example, think ""Napoleon Dynamite."" A lot of people absolutely HATED this movie. Very simply, they were wrong. They missed its heart and its sweetness, didn't get the jokes and, probably, wanted something along the lines of ""American Pie.""

So, anyone going into ""Death Proof"" expecting a modern action movie is going to be taken aback. This isn't ""The Fast and the Furious,"" thank God. This movie, like ""Reservoir Dogs,"" is about dialog more than demolition. It's about building tension. And, for you folks who seemingly have never seen an action flick from 30 years ago, it's also MUCH more in line with the pacing of 70s exploitation/action/drive-in cinema than you think it is. Take a look back at ""Bullitt"" or ""The French Connection."" Granted, these were top-tier features of their day - they weren't grindhouse flicks. But they're also very talky cop movies which have a grand total of one car chase apiece. LOTS of drive-in flicks were very much the same: long on talk with a little action.

The point is, I guess, that ""Death Proof"" really is a very good movie, though people expecting a Vin Diesel crashfest (ie: the comfortable crap they're used to) aren't going to think so. But time will prove them wrong just as it has for detractors of the Ramones, ""Exile on Main Street"" and ""Napoleon Dynamite.""",1190937600,3,4967,4.73094688221709
2860938,5,B000R7HY0K,"Kurt Russell as stuntman Mike is one of the coolest bad guys there's been in a while and he really makes this, dare I say, `chick flick' shine.

The unrated version contains the missing dance clip so yearned for and the other additional scenes blend in perfectly, plus the sound and picture are superb.  A bit of the girls dialog does sound like guys talking at times, but overall it was very entertaining and well acted.  If you're not sure about this movie, see it!

2860939,4,B000R7HY0K,"Death Proof is a pedal to the metal, bad-a** homage to b-movies that is an absolute blast to watch.  What makes the movie so good is that Quentin Tarantino ground his beloved ""Grindhouse"" movies to a pulp, found the essence of what he loves, and turned it into something completely unique and compelling to watch.  Death Proof does drag a bit at times and gets a bit too absorbed in dialog, but you will be well rewarded for your patience.  The plot builds towards the film's final twenty minutes, which contains one of the greatest car chases that I have ever seen recorded on film.

There's really lots to this movie, and it only sunk in with repeat viewing.  If you are a Tarantino fan and you deny yourself this movie you are missing something.  I expect a lot of the complaints come from people who do not appreciate Tarantino dialog, and his unique homage style, or aren't familiar with the films he is homaging here (Dirty Mary Crazy Larry, White Line Fever, Vanishing Point, The Road Warrior, etc.) Do yourself a favor, watch these movies, then watch Death Proof 3-4 times and then write your reviews.

2860941,2,B000R7HY0K,"As a big Tarantino fan and a gear head, I was looking forward to this, thinking it would be a slick and exciting car chase movie.  Then I started watching the film, and what I saw was a two hour movie that was an hour and forty five minutes of filler and fifteen minutes of an average car chase.  The scenes of dialogue between the victims, and later on the heroines, drag on forever with absolutely no plot building (mostly because there is no plot to build in the first place), and when the scenes with the cars finally roll around they just aren't worth the wait.  And what's more, at the end of the movie I was actually feeling sorry for the villain.  Yes, Stuntman Mike killed four girls in the movie and tried to kill three more, but the heroines were just so slimy (I actually felt like taking a shower after their dialogue scenes).  All that being said, Death Proof might have been a decent movie if it was a half hour shorter.",1190851200,7,935,4.2897727272727275

And to top it off, the characters were incredibly annoying. Not a good mix. He already makes the current day equivalent of grindhouse movies. Now, when he tries to recreate those clunky films, he fails. He should've made the same movie in his usual style without trying to imitate the look or try to live in a different time. It's like doing an old musical and trying to make it the way they did then. It just can't work. You can recreate the look, but it has no heart, it's uninspired. It's like Scorsese's ""New York, New York,"" it was set in that time, but was a modern movie. Inspiration comes from the gut and Tarantino lives today, not then.",1190764800,18,819,4.466666666666667

The problem was that the talk just wasn't interesting.
 I'm a Kurt Russell fan and mostly a Tarantino fan, but this film was dull except for the ten minutes following the ""wrong turn"" in the first half.
 The second half never approached the intensity of those 10 min, so there was no payoff for me for enduring the interminable yap, yap, yapping of the first two-thirds of the second half.

Zoe Bell was charismatic and appealing, but even together with Russell, who's great as usual (I did like his interpretation of the character when the chips were down; nice touch), they couldn't overcome the intrinsic dullness of the script.

2860966,5,B000R7HY0K,"I was one of the fortunate souls that got to see Grindhouse in the theaters. I liked it so much; I took another friend and saw it twice. When I first heard that Death Proof was going to be released separately, I was naturally ready to join the ranks of the boycotters, feeling this was another attempt at making more money. But Death Proof by itself is an amazing Quentin Tee film, and I won't pass up the chance to own it, as I do most of his films.

I haven't read all 100 or so reviews here on Amazon, but from the many I have read, no one has pointed out what was only obvious to me the first time I watched Death Proof with the NON-Grindhouse crowd. Now, it may only seem like a trivial thing, but I liked the fact that there were characters from the 1st half of Grindhouse (Planet Terror) used in the 2nd half (Death Proof). You have to have seen Planet Terror to appreciate the over-lap. Like the nurse in the hospital scene. Or the crazy twin babysitters in the bar where  Stuntman Mike meets Rose McGowan. That to me is the real issue with splitting them up. But, maybe that's just one cool thing that the rest of us privileged Grindhouse fans will always have to ourselves. Everyone else who missed that theater experience, will only get to see the DVD with the new (originally cut) scenes.  But those who saw the Grindhouse films in the theater will always have those (hey, I remember that character!) moments.

The stunt sequences are, without a doubt, amazing, and hearken back to the days of Bullitt, Dirty Mary Crazy Larry, anishing Point, and the French Connection (which are also all mentioned in the film in a bit of shameless name dropping), but the movie tries too hard to recapture that same feeling. The nod was nice, but you don't have to try and DUPLICATE th classics.  And, honestly, I only plan to watch the last half of the film or so ever again, the beginning is just...well, too much wasted film and vulgarity for the sake of being vulgar.  The beginning is pretty much pointless.  I was SO excited to see the special features on this DVD.....until I watched them.  Tarantino just doesn't know how or when to shut up.  I mean, seriously.  I felt like all he did in each segment was try to convince us why, in his mind, he's the world's greatest filmmaker.  I would have rather SEEN more about how the stunts were done than have Quentin extrapolate on how cool he thought they were and how cool he was for getting these stunt drivers together and why he thought in a few years this driver was going to be everywhere.

2860969,4,B000R7HY0K,"This DVD rocks!
Granted, a film like this won't be to everyone's taste (nor should it be). ""Death Proof - Extended and Unrated"" is long and talky, but if you're game enough to stick with it you'll be rewarded with some witty banter, some steamy scenes, and some of the best smash-up car chases in years. All this and a groovy soundtrack, too.
The extras -- mainly concerning the background, editing and casting of the film -- are not wildly extensive. However, they more than adequately convey the filmmakers' excitement and enthusiasm for what they felt would be a return to the freewheeling days of exploitation cinema: when small time studios tossed aside mainstream cinematic conventions and threw in everything but the kitchen sink to deliver some cheap thrills and make a fast buck.
That the theatrical double-feature bombed at the box office is both a crime and a shame. While it would be nice to have the whole enchilada in one convenient package, at least this project saw the light of day which is a far better fate than most such endeavours would likely receive in this age of empty-headed, watered-down, inspirationless CGI-fests. Whatever has been taken out or added to this release since then (and whatever double-dips may lie on the horizon), I'd rather have it piecemeal than not at all.
Don't deny yourselves, folks; buy this DVD. Bundle it up in a homemade double feature with ""Planet Terror"" (or any exploitation flick of your choice), invite a few friends over and have a rollicking good time.",1190678400,2,1513,4.845559845559846

2860971,5,B000R7HY0K,"To say ""Grindhouse"" was perhaps the most fun I've had at the movies in a long time would be a gross understatement. The genius of Robert Rodriguez's ""Planet Terror"" and Quentin Tarantino's ""Death Proof"" combined was matched only by the disappointment of a movie-going public virtually ignoring such a rich and colorful experience. Would you rather text message or crinkle your candy wrappers through a single, overpriced movie, which will likely be a remake or a sequel as opposed to being treated to two fun, campy, quality films for the price of one? What could have, should have been a film history milestone went by generally unnoticed, and we can probably place half the blame of seperating these movies into two full-priced DVD's on that fact alone.

But I digress. It's hard not to let the disappointment of not being able to enjoy the ""Grindhouse"" experience at home damper your mood, but in reality, ""Death Proof"" was an excellent movie all in itself, so it merits it's own release. For Quentin Tarantino's sixth full-length film, we are treated to a John Carpenter-esque stalker/slasher movie that, oddly enough, features a man behind a wheel doing all the damage. Kurt Russell plays Stuntman Mike. Mike has a rather fancy, souped-up Chevy Nova that has been outfitted so extensively that he can survive any car crash. Trick is, as one poor lady finds out mid-way through the movie, you have to be in the passenger seat to take advantage of it's benefits. Mike goes through the first half of the film taking pleasure in high-speed action worthy of a major motion picture action (hmmm...) that doesn't fare too well for the people on the other end. It's not until he comes across a group of tough as nails, but rather chatty ladies that he meets his match and the killer becomes the victim. ""Death Proof"" works like a strange blend of the original ""Gone In Sixty Seconds"" and ""Halloween."" It succeeds because it's a new take on old material and actually builds characters that are real and relateable.

A blurb on the back of the DVD case totes this as Tarantino's most original film since ""Pulp Fiction."" That statement is not too far off. Whereas ""Jackie Brown"" and both volumes of ""Kill Bill"" also paid homage to movies of past, ""Death Proof"" stands out because it has an unmistakeable Tarantino vibe to it, and what is usually typical, predictable material is turned on it's head and spun in only the way Quentin can. It's got great characterization, realistic dialogue, intense action scenes and one satisfying ending. Even if the DVD features leave a bit to be desired -- you can smell the double-dip coming next year -- it's still worth buying the ""Grindhouse"" features seperately, as ""Death Proof"" is presented in an extended fashion here, with material that helps the film stand by itself even better. Pretty much a perfect movie that I would recommend to anyone who loves Quentin Tarantino, cars and slasher flicks.",1190678400,4,2934,4.842629482071713
2860991,2,B000R7HY0K,"First I should say, I absolutely loved seeing Grindhouse in the theater as it was meant to be seen. The dvd destroys the whole experience.

2860992,4,B000R7HY0K,"One of the things that makes Deathproof so great is the character development. Kill-seeking, slash-'em-up, gore-lovers hate character development.

In your typical run of the mill Horror movie you usually get pummeled with countless deaths of countless B-list actors playing teen aged dysfunctionals; if the killing doesn't start within 15 minutes of the beginning of the movie you're saying WTF. You never really ""get to know"" any of the cast; you certainly don't feel a connection to them; and when Jason&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-the-13th-Part-2/dp/B00001MXXP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday the 13th, Part 2</a>&nbsp;comes a knockin' you don't wince from the loss of a character that you got to like; you wince from the spatter. It's exactly what you paid for.

In Deathproof, for the first half of the movie you're chillin' with a group of young adults; you're part of the click; you're getting to know some pretty cool gals. Even if you haven't seen the trailer or read the reviews, you have a foreboding sense that something bad is about to happen, and by the time that it does you don't want it to because of the bond that you've developed...which makes anything bad that happens that much worse. (Some other movies that did this well recently were Wolf Creek&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wolf-Creek-Unrated-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000EOTVU2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wolf Creek (Unrated Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;and The Descent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Descent-Unrated-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000IHY9TS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Descent (Unrated Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;.

Therefore, Deathproof for me was a very good movie for the same reason that other people might have been disappointed with it.

The average amount of stars at Amazon for Deathproof is unfairly skewed to the low side because of disgruntled customers that want the other half of the theatrical double feature release included for free with their purchase&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grindhouse-Presents-Planet-Terror-Extended-and-Unrated-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000UAE7O0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grindhouse Presents, Planet Terror - Extended and Unrated (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;. Sorry, folks. That was a gimmick for the big screen only.

Speaking of gimmicks, don't adjust your TV; those film scratches in the first 1/2 of Deathproof are part of the intended, deliberate early-70s look. But make no mistake, the film takes place in the current day. And the dialogue couldn't be more snappy and modern...executed precisely by a class-A cast of actors.

What a great over the-top-action flick with tons of tongue in cheek laughs.  After it ends, you're treated to the real star of Grindhouse; the 3 fake trailers in the middle of the double feature.  We laughed so hard.  they were fantastic....and then comes DEATHPROOF.  I like Tarantino's stuff and think Pulp Fiction is one of the top 20 movies ever.  Deathproof halts the whole experience to a ""grinding"" pace.  Horribly boring, the theatrical version sets up the killings of chicks with unending talk about nothing.  Tarantino scripts that even took his own writing too serious as we have to sit through chicks talking about NOTHING for prolonged periods of time. All just to get to the cool chase at the end.  I told my brother to see Grindhouse and stay for the trailers after Planet Terror and then just get up and leave before Deathproof starts.  It was terrible.

This dvd is going to give you almost 30 minutes more of more talking about nothing.  They have hacked out the fake trailers, which were the best parts of Grindhouse to begin with and you know they're just going to milk you for the ""total Grindhouse experience"" dvd later next year.  Dvd's have become a dirty business.  I plan on RENTING Planet Terror when it comes out and I never want to see Death Proof agian....ever.

I AGREE WITH A LOT OF THE OTHER REVIEWERS, BTW.  I WILL NOT BUY THIS OR THE OTHER PLANET TERROR DISC AS THE TOTAL THING WILL COME EVENTUALLY.  STOP MILKING PEOPLE FOR MORE CASH.

Fast Cars, Hot babes and good dialogue is what is in this movie. Stuntman Mike(Kurt Russel) drives a car called / entitled Death Proof, it proves the driver with a almost safe guard againist any accident the driver get himself into. The movie is a play on the old school Grindhouse cinema style so you will notice that the film does jump or is chopped at parts why, back in the day Grindhouse movies were made for almost nothing and had no real big productions behind them so often they did have jumps and bad editing. The Movie is Set in Austin, Texas and trys to make you feel like back in the day, you will notice a old 45 record player at the Bar, this trust me is a Classic and is hard to find them now of days, I mean 45 the record player ask your parents kids what a 45 is if they don't know ask your grandparents then.

The movie goes through a lot of trouble to make you feel like back in the day, old movie posters and classic signs are littered throughout the movie look for them its a great touch to the movie. The movie starts out following Three hot babes going to a bar, and talking and just having fun so far, later on Butterfly(Vanessa Ferlito) notices a certain car following them, its in fact is a Jet black 1970 Chevry Nova supercharged, driven by Stuntman Mike. As the girls at the bar are drinking and enjoying themself's one patron asks for a ride, Pam(Rose McGowan) has been chosen by Stuntman Mike, he offers her a ride home when he is ready, meanwhile the back story here is that Jungle Julia(Sydney Tamiia Poitier) runs a radio show in Austin and has said that for anyone who asks Butterfly her name and offers her beer and says a certain line she would give them a lap dance. Well guess who takes up that offer, Stuntman Mike does and after he does a old John Wayne line he gets a lap dance from Butterfly. After the seductive lap dance they all start to depart the bar, now the fun starts for the film.

Remember Pam is riding with Stuntman Mike, and after he goes over why he calls his car Death Proof she decides to go along with it. But soon learns she made a real bad choice, as Stuntman Mike starts to scare the living hell out of her, and finally he kills her, and now he goes after the other girls from the bar and after finding them on a lone stretch of road, he turns his Chevy Nova around and rams them with the lights out, for a touch of Class he turns them on just before hitting them, you will love the car crash and the mulitangles its shot in, great cinema on this crash truely.

Well after that, Stuntman Mike is in the Hospital recovering from the crash, he is the only survivor of the crash. Well after a short stay at the Hospital he can now be found in Tennessee, now you will meet up with Abernathy(Rosario Dawson), Kim(Tracie Thoms), Lee(Mary Elizabeth Winstead), and Zoe(Zoe Bell). First off both Kim and Zoe are gearheads / stuntwomen so they know there way around a car. Well Zoe says why she wanted to come to Tennessee is to find a 1969 Dodge Charger with a 440 under the hood and it happens to be that there is someone one with a stack one and is up for Sale. Now the Girls just want to drive it to recreate a scene from Vanishing Point. So after Abernathy, Kim and Zoe talk it over they decide to leave Lee with the owner, hoping that her charm will keep the owner distracted. So after they start off on their recreation scene soon Stuntman Mike who has been stalking them so far, starts to begin ramming it, big thing to remember is that Zoe is basically hanging on the hood of the car, so as you can tell Zoe is hanging on to the hood of the car as Stuntman Mike is ramming and banging the car. Well after a couple of minutes Zoe is thrown from the car's hood and into a bush, and after that Stuntman Mike gets out of his car to congratulate himself but Kim shots him in the arm, so he leaves but Zoe is ok so the girls decide to take it to Stuntman Mike at his own game.

From there you can imagine the next car chase scenes is one of a kind, with both the girls and stuntman mike not giving a inch, well from there you have to see the movie to see what happens next, I can't give away the ending just like that its a good movie so check it out for yourself.

The only problem I got is the fact that these movies both Planet Terror and Death Proof where billed as a double feature meaning a two for one, and now I have to buy each one sperately is totally crap to me and everyone else.",1190332800,2,4457,4.134948096885813
2861009,1,B000R7HY0K,"To look at this as some kind of genius 'homage' means willfully overlooking all of this films weak points.

Watching it in the theater, I was looking forward to learning more about Kurt Russell's character.  I was surprised when QT started to spend so much time on a group of young women that it was very hard to care much about.  This segment of the film seemed to go on and on and on and on, and after a while I started feeling sympathetic toward the Butterfly character because I thought that somehow when the script came to a climax, her character was going to be transformed in some meaningful way.

Finally, when my interest was nearly gone, all of the girls were killed within a 20-30 second sequence.  All of the film that had been rolling was just to show the viewer that Kurt was a pretty bad dude.

Why, oh why did QT feel the need for all the exposition on characters that ultimately had no meaning?  It didn't make any sense at all.  Why did he try and get the audience to invest any interest in them?  It would have been far more effective if we were only introduced to the original girls in passing and the story opened near the point when Kurt met Rose at the bar.  All the other material before that was simply nothing more than a waste of the audience's time.

After the first batch of women dies off, we are introduced to a second group of women.  Now these are more interesting, as with them the movie actually starts to show a pulse.  By the time the ladies kill Kurt, I was cheering.  Its not that I wanted to see his character dead as much as I wanted a scapegoat for all of my frustrations with the earlier part of the film.

All of the people out there with their 'homage' comments and 'but its a QT film!' ought to be tarred, feathered and run out of town, and the general public needs to get the message that this emperor simply has no clothing.  If calling this movie a brilliant homage helps you to think of yourself as some sort of sophisticate, then you deserve to have lost your money.",1190332800,6,2017,4.282321899736147

A total rip off that it doesn't include the trailers. They could have easily split them up and put some on each DVD release. No, of course they just want everyone to buy another version of the movie when they release the inevitable double feature version.

Even with that, this movie I just couldn't stand. Who is it supposed to appeal to ? No wonder it was such a bomb at the box office. One hand you have extremely long dialogue scenes where Tarentino just rehashes his former movies. It's like he's trying to recreate the Resevoir Dogs dinner scene with female models. Then after this tedious mess we get the crazy car chases and what not. I think if the movie was cut down to a 30 minute short it might have been bareable.

OK we get it, it's supposed to be a 70's B movie. Wow you're so artisitic. Give me a break, it's just way too obvious with all the grain lines. I can do the same thing on Windows Movie Maker.

2861022,5,B000R7HY0K,"Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof, the second film that played after Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror as part of the original theatrical Grindhouse feature, is a brilliant homage and twisted trip to say the least.  Kurt Russell (in a role originally slated for Mickey Rourke) plays the psychotic Stuntman Mike, who doesn't kill his victims with a gun or a knife like a typical serial killer would, but instead he uses his souped up muscle car to stalk and murder his prey, and he does it quite well.  All goes great for Mike until he comes across the wrong group of girls (including Rosario Dawson and stuntwoman Zoe Bell in her acting debut) who strike back in a big way.  While Death Proof is pure Tarantino all the way (the dialogue is top notch and instantly memorable), it's the car crash and chase scenes that are what's worth noting the most.  With some incredible stunt work at his disposal, Tarantino crafts the trashy homage he set out to do, and he does it perfectly.  Also featuring Rose McGowan, Jordan Ladd, Hostel director Eli Roth, and the incredibly hot Vanessa Ferlito.  On a side note, you'll no doubt notice that the negative reviews here are due to the fact that Death Proof and Planet Terror are not being released together on DVD as they were in theaters.  It's a crying shame that this has happened, because this isn't what Tarantino or Rodriguez wanted.  The whole point of Grindhouse was getting two movies for the price of one, and the fake trailers sprinkled before and in between (directed by Roth, Rob Zombie, Rodriguez, and Edgar Wright) are nowhere in sight.  Whether you purchase them both seperately is up to you, but it's inevitable that further down the line both films will be packaged together with the trailers included.",1190246400,,1757,4.753289473684211

  Besides Russel being in great form and the girls being hot, the car chase at the end is great too. But I'm not sure all the talk is needed. The first bunch of girls just talk about guys and sex and then the 2nd batch come along and talk about the same stuff basically. So I don't think it was that needed since all we really needed to know about the 2nd batch is that they don't take crap and that they are pretty wild.

  While Stunt-Man Mike might or might not really have done stunts in tv shows since no one has even seen his work. He might just be a wannabe who borrowed his stunt-man brother's car, that's my theory anyway lol. With all the talking we do get some new classic Tarantino lines I admit but most of those I think are in the bar scene when we first meet Stunt-man Mike. Although before the action at the end we do get a brutal scene where we see how dangerous Stunt-man Mike and his car really are. Well that is if he is the one ditching it out. When he's getting it back Russel is hilarious and brilliant how he plays it off which to me is why he should be nominated most of all.",1190160000,,1312,4.046332046332046

That being said, Tarantino's theatrical ""Deathproof"" to me always felt unfinished and ultimately ackward in it's timing, the key element in all of his stuff - from the editing, to the music and dialogue...if it's off, it doesn't really work the way that it should.

I watched this version for the first time last night and was literally dazzled by the genius that is Q and his partner in crime Sally Menke.  Gone are the dead-end moments of ""huh?"" and replaced with ""ooo's"" & ""ahhh's"".

2861031,4,B000R7HY0K,"A lot of the reviews here seem to be people upset at the split on DVD. I'm gonna give my best at reviewing the movie and ignoring the split on DVD.

As stated before Death Proof is one half of Grindhouse, which was split upon the DVD release. It's a throwback to 70s exploitation flicks. Death Proof has sparked a pretty big debate among viewers; some love it and hail as a masterpiece others find it slow and boring and a waste of time.

As a fan of exploitation cinema I personally wouldn't put Death Proof with that genre of film. While Death Proof is paying homage to those styles of films it really doesn't feel like one. About the only thing that makes it feel like a 70s exploitation flick is the look of the movie at least in the first half. The lines going through the picture the picture jumps. I really enjoyed that in the first half.

A lot of those movies do indeed look like that well before they are restored onto DVD so in that sense Tarantino really captures that vibe, but just not with the actual movie. As for the movie itself I thought it was excellent. I'll admit thus far I have enjoyed everything Quentin Tarantino has done so I was quite pumped for Death Proof.

As good as a director Quentin is what really makes him stand-out is his dialogue. I think even the biggest of Quentin Tarantino fans will agree while he is a talented director; he's a much better writer.

Death Proof is your typical Quentin Tarantino movie with the great writing he is known for among his fans. Though with that said I do believe there were some problems. I loved the first half of the movie; in my opinion it was some of Tarantino's best writing of his career. Sure it's no Pulp Fiction, but I found it well-written and damn entertaining.

The characters were well-written and again your typical Tarantino characters. But the 2nd half changes focus on the characters and that's when things get a tad bit messy.

The biggest complaint with Death Proof was it was too slow and too much talking. I personally never once in the first half found it slow or boring. The writing was sharp and I found the tension building. We know something was gonna happen sooner or later and the anticipation of that I felt worked amazingly.

But the 2nd half is when I did start to find things slowing down and I didn't feel that tension. Honestly, the 2nd half felt like somebody trying to be Quentin Tarantino. I never found Death Proof boring, but I have to admit I wasn't into the 2nd half nearly as much as I was the first half.

The characters just in my opinion didn't work as well and again I personally felt as if the 2nd half was written by someone trying to copy Tarantino. The 2nd half is by no means bad; it just doesn't work quite as well and in some areas does drag a bit. It doesn't take a way from the fun of the movie though.

The car chase scenes at the end were excellent and that is something we don't see much of today in film. And when we do normally its CGI and even when it's not CG when we do get it I don't know I just find it doesn't work.

Quentin Tarantino knows his stuff when it comes to film the guy is pretty much a walking encyclopedia of knowledge when it comes to movies. So not much of a surprise the car chase scenes cam out as wonderful as they did; the scenes were suspenseful and action packed and very much made up for some of the slower spots in the 2nd half.

The cast was great here. The girls are all very sexy and excellent and Rose McGowan pretty much steals the show from them. But the real stand-out of the movie is Kurt Russell. I have always been a fan of Kurt Russell and this was his best role in years. He's played a couple of Iconic characters and I think Stuntman Mike is another one to his list.

I would very much recommend this flick to fans of Tarantino; if you like his work thus far odds are you'll really dig Death Proof. But for those who aren't fans of QT I doubt this movie will change your opinion of him.

Death Proof is a well acted and made movie that has plenty of thrilling and very fun moments. While it doesn't really capture the 70s exploitation vibe Death Proof is a must see.",1190160000,12,4140,4.257324840764332
2861032,5,B000R7HY0K,"Without reading any reviews about this movie I immediately decided to type my own.  Excuse me if this is a little redundant to what was previously written.  However I know there are two main arguments most people have about this movie.  My goal in this review is to elaborate with my opinion about these two issues.

The first argument I hear often is that it is a rip off that Grindhouse is being released as seperate DVDs instead of the original format shown in theatres.  I couldn't disagree more.  Personally I believe it's a great move they did this.  Granted I do wish I could have a copy to play these two films back to back with the trailers and missing reels but hey, those who missed out are out of luck.  The whole purpose of showing these two films back to back was to experience what grindhouse movie theatres had to offer.  It doesn't make much sense to have missing reels and advertisements for sloppy mexican food on a DVD.  Not many people have film projecters and stadium seating in their living room.

The second argument I hear often is that a TON of people claim that this movie is bad...really bad.  Their main claim is that there is not enough excitement and too much dialogue.  I don't believe they knew what Quentin was trying to achieve in this film.  Quentin did an outstanding job with this movie.  The dialogue is what you would expect...except this time around it's women doing most of the talking instead of men talking about cunnilingus.  The music really enhances the feel of the every scene.  The stunts in this film are a breath of fresh air in this industry currently flooded with CGI computer animated crap.  The chase scene at the end is one that is truly remarkable and simply classic.  Zoe Bell is AWESOME!!!!  Sit down, grab a beer and enjoy this movie.  It's really not hard to do, even though most people would beg the differ.

Support artists like Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino.  If you don't the movie theatres will eventually become one big MTV TRL show.",1190160000,,2009,4.565826330532213

I have to admit I'm in the minority when I say I'm thrilled that Death Proof has been released separately on DVD. It was by far my favorite of the two films in the Grindhouse experience, and now to have it extended, it's an even better film than the first time I saw it.

Strangely enough, Death Proof now seems to be a tighter film, even with a longer running time.  The conversations between the girls seem faster, snappier and more involving; less talky. The much-anticipated lap-dance sequence is hot and worth waiting for.

Watching the film again, you better appreciate both groups of girls.  The first group is young, naive, innocent and looking to have fun as young people do, so their fate is heartbreaking.  The second group is more jaded, edgier and definitely tougher.  I like the contrast, and it's easier to see the second time around.

Ignore the negative reviews, and watch Death Proof for what it is: an entertaining revenge flick.",1190073600,8,969,4.7604790419161676

Quentin Tarantino threatens to become my favourite director. Is it the car chase? Is it the character building? Is it the music? Is it the fact that his direction is flawless and unapologetic? Is it the heart and soul and the idea? Whatever it is, it is Death Proof.

And yes, I have seen my fair share of films this year. Death Proof is a mux of rage, action, madness, eerieness. Kurt Russel was amazing.

2861037,5,B000R7HY0K,"I loved Death Proof.  It works much better on its own than in its original Grindhouse format. Grindhouse was a great idea, but the directors should have stuck with the plan and made two 50 - 60 minutes films. As a double feature, both films were too long.  There was no intermission.  The trailers didn't add anything to the experience (authentic '70s trailers would have been better).  That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed Grindhouse.  The defects in the soundtrack and film stock, as well as the little touches such as the 'feature presentation' banner and music made me feel genuinely nostalgic for the drive-in movies I loved as a teenager in the '70s.  Death Proof suffered following Planet Terror.  Planet Terror was such a fast-paced, over-the-top thriller that Death Proof seemed slow and conventional by comparison.  Taken on its own, Death Proof is a hell of a movie.  Kurt Russell plays a sociopathic ex-stuntman who builds cars to use as weapons against the women he methodically stalks.  The movie is about his victims.  The first half follows a group of women (played by Sydney Poitier, Vanessa Ferlito and Jordan Ladd) out for drinks at the Texas Chili Parlor.  The second half follows a second group of women (Rosario Dawson, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Tracie Thoms, and Zoe Bell) on location and looking to have some fun with a borrowed Dodge Challenger.  The halves are so disparate, Death Proof plays like a movie and its sequel.  The only character connecting the two halves is Stuntman Mike.  The second half is in pristine condition, which adds to the effect of a sequel playing along with the original as a double bill, the original now a much worn film.  The dialogue in the first half is classic Tarrantino, as are the music, the sets, the direction, and the acting.  The second half is a revenge film straight out of the 70s.  The action in the second half is crazy, edge of your seat stuff.  Zo Bell is amazing.  She is obvious doing her own stunts (at least most of them), new stunts, incredible stunts, stupidly dangerous stunts.  The chase scene ending the movie is absolutely authentic.  I love both halves of Death Proof.  It works better on its own than as the second feature of Grindhouse.  I couldn't be happier that the movies are being released separately (for now).  Tarantino is a great director because he makes the kinds of movies that he loves to watch.  We need more movies like this.",1190073600,3,2426,4.744019138755981
2861038,5,B000R7HY0K,"I was skeptical at first; Kurt Russell playing a calculating, manipulative madman who uses an automobile to kill girls?  I mean, Russell's great and all...but REALLY?  So naturally, when I saw ""Grindhouse"" in theaters (yes, world, I was one of the few) I came in ready to critique. What I found was a surprise (although, in retrospect, not much of one)--Russell pretty much reinvents himself here.  Snake Pliskin and Wyatt Earp no more; here we have Stuntman Mike, who goes around stalking and killing beautiful young women.  That's basically the movie.

The great thing about grindhouse cinema is that plot is irrelevant; we come for over-the-top performances, outrageous scenes, a bit of sex and bruality, and not much else.  Of course, this is a Tarantino film, so you DO get something else--great acting, writing, and directing, not to mention a killer (oh dear, a pun!) soundtrack.  I know a lot of people will be unhappy with this movie, as it takes about forty-five minutes for anything to really happen...but when it happens, IT HAPPENS.  And face it--up 'til that point, and ever afterward, it's totally cool.

A word about the release...yes, I am disappointed that ""Grindhouse"" was not released in full.  Not surprised, though; I left the theater and told the people I was with that there was no way in hell the movie was going to be released as a single unit.  I mean, we're talking Tarantino and Rodriguez here.  What do you expect them to do--follow the rules?  ""Grindhouse"" was a THEATRICAL event; I would love to see it again in its entirety, but the effect would be totally lost on a home television set.  Yes, it's a minor tragedy that we don't have the fake previews; and I think it's a shame that some of the ""lost"" scenes were re-instated (although I'm giddy as a schoolboy that the scratches weren't edited out; thank God for small favors).  But take ""Death Proof"" as what it is--a great thriller, another in a long line of Tarantino cult-classics.  And if you're upset about the absence of ""Planet Terror,"" watch the preview for it in the bonus features.  I giggled in anticipation all the way through.",1190073600,,2124,4.7753424657534245
2861039,5,B000R7HY0K,"This is one half of Quentin Tarantino's stylized homage to the dollar theater, GRINDHOUSE, expanded, but without the faux movie trailers.

DEATH PROOF has all the blobs, crackles, changes of hue and missing reels that you would expect of any low-budget schlock film that had made the rounds of the so-called ""grindhouses,"" those sticky-seated, torn-screen movie palaces with popcorn mutating under the seats, places that showed forgotten classics like PELVIS and THE CARS THAT EAT PEOPLE.

DEATH PROOF is not about a car that eats people, it's about a car that kills people. Kurt Russell plays the deranged Stuntman Mike, who likes to take his specially-adapted car (deathproofed with a harness and roll cage for the driver, and a huge death's-head painted on the hood) and smash it at full speed into cars carrying pretty young girls. The violence and gore is pure classic Tarantino: Burlesqued grotesque.

Stuntman Mike always walks away. They don't.

They don't that is, until the scarred Stuntman Mike runs afoul of a car driven by a pair of female stunt drivers (Stuntwoman Zoe Bell stars as herself). At first he gets the drop on them, but when they realize he means to kill them they engage him in an amazing eighteen minute high speed chase scene reminiscent of BULLITT, THE FRENCH CONNECTION, THE SEVEN UPS, and others too numerous to mention, after which the girls take their revenge. It's a case history of Female Empowerment as seen through the eyes of Quentin Tarantino.

Just like the films it pays homage to, DEATH PROOF starts out with it storyline meandering along at a clip somewhat slower than refrigerated ketchup, but we get to meet and like the girls, even while Tarantino teases us with hints of T & A. Thus, when Stuntman Mike breaks out of his rather bland persona into a leering maniac, we shudder. The last half hour---particularly the chase scene---will keep you hopping.

Although its only half of the GRINDHOUSE experience, DEATH PROOF stands on its own merits, particularly if you're a fan of the low-budget films it honors.",1190073600,,2055,4.92485549132948
2861040,2,B000R7HY0K,"Yes, I will say what many have already said, but I don't think that it can be reiterated enough. I just saw the DVD release of Death Proof, and though Death Proof is a wonderfully imagined and executed film that kicks some serious butt, its content is feeble and inferior in comparison with past Tarantino films. As only part of the release of Grindhouse, the deleted scenese have been added back in. This creates a movie that is too long with a premise that is spread far too thin, and one realises it was a better film when these scenes were left out. It is too much, but at the same time not enough. The original cut of Death Proof was perfect and worked beautifully with Planet Terror and the faux trailers that made up the theater release known as Grindhouse. Grindhouse was a masterpiece, an homage to trash, cult film that worked because its various parts added up to a single, fantastic whole. These films are based upon Grindhouse cinema, they are in and of themselves cheap, exploitation films and the directors know that, they love these kinds of films, and what they created in the theater was not just a movie but a theater experience. They created a context in which movies like these are to be viewed and they reminded us, the audience, what is so delicious and fun about going to see movies like this in the first place. Alone, Death Proof is like watching one half of a movie, what is the point of that? Death Proof and Planet Terror need to be Grindhouse, by themselves, they truly are little more than the low budget horror films that they are homage too (which I don't usually think are worthwhile), they are below the tour de force that Tarantino and Rodriguez usually to a cinematic experience, only when they are together in the Grindhouse package does the genius begin to spark. Grindhouse was one of the best movie releases this summer, if this film is not somehow released in its original form, it will be  a terrible loss to Tarantino and Rodriguez fans and to cinema in general.",1190073600,,2006,4.541436464088398
2861051,3,B000R7HY0K,"There's 2 ways you can see it when you watch a film like Death Proof or Planet Terror on their own, either see it as a separated half from a larger whole or a film onto itself without its companion to support it. Either way you look at it, it's probably the most disappointing of Quentin's films and probably the lesser half of the Grindhouse double bill. There is a couple of things to recommend about it but for me, this was simply an okay movie whether attached or on its own.

Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) has a real fixation with girls and the way he gets out his obsession is ramming into them with his ""death proof"" car, a car fitted for dangerous stunts and crashes. Once he's finished with the first trio of girls (Vanessa Ferlito, Jordan Ladd, Sydney Tamiaa Poitier), he goes after movie set workers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Rosario Dawson, Zoe Bell, Tracie Thoms).

That's pretty much the entire film in a nutshell and it's kind of hard to get into detail and specifics because there isn't any. Mind you this film is a tribute to 70's era movies so you can't really be too criticizing of a film like this. But then again you watch the film and find much to nitpick. For one, the film is just way too long yet it's probably one of his shortest movies if you count Kill Bill films as one gigantic one. While in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, those natural conversations about Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"" and Royale with Cheese burgers felt realistic and even fascinating to hear, in this film these chicks just talk and talk meaninglessly. While the payoffs are exciting, the loooong leadup to them feel frustrating.

As a guy, it's kind of fun to watch a film which is essentially dominated mainly by women. Some of them fair better (Dawson, McGowan and Winstead, mainly cause she's just so cute) while some (Bell, Thoms, Poitier) are either annoying and wish somebody would tell them to shut up or they're cute but little else of substance. But the main draw of course is Kurt Russell. Quentin sure likes to cast great leading men who deliver excellent performances like Robert Forster in Jackie Brown or David Carradine in Kill Bill and again with Russell who plays menace and cool, easygoing demeanors.

Ultimately, you have to watch Death Proof with a feeling like you're missing the second half, same if you were to watch Planet Terror without seeing this after it. While it's obvious they were separated for money reasons, it's hard to tell if they're good films on their own or not enough in one to warrant a watch. As such, Death Proof has some goods but not without its bads either.",1190073600,2,2602,4.57725321888412

Four would-be victims babble and drink and do lap dances and flirt and smoke pot and tease guys and tease each other, awesome vintage tunes playing on an old jukebox, and the most interesting element: a look as if it were a cheaply made ""grindhouse"" flick, with spots on the screen and visible mistakes and sound problems and jump-cuts and skips as if it were a broken record. The middle of the film provides a great death scene introducing a great new killer: a hotrod wheeling freddy kruger and now we're ready with our beltbuckles on to have a heck of a ride. But then... something happens. The spots on the film go away. All of the sudden, everything is clear. Too clear. There is no more of that grindhouse cheap movie look from the first half. And instead of now rolling with this new bad guy we get introduced to four new girls, more cleancut and talky, and annoying. Too much dialog and hey, where's the bad guy? Where's his car? We get to see it once during a somewhat boring scene that provides a bridge between both parts of the film, but then that's it until we see him once in a diner, and then at the very end. Tarantino worked up a great course for the first half and then served us a very bad dessert. The killer turns out to be a useless crybaby, the new would-be victims turn out to be karate babe heroes, the car, which the movie is named after, is hardly even shown, and we, the audience, has to suffer through it. But the thing that blows me away is how QT totally abandoned the cheap grindhouse look that made the first half so cool, and then left us with characters who we not only dislike, but who talk so much there's no time to think. QT, you screwed up a good thing. Must be all that money you got in the bank, or something. You need to get hungry again buddy. I was enjoying this movie, and then ended up feeling robbed, and betrayed. Imagine Freddy Kruger or Jason Vorhees or Michael Myers or Norman Bates or the shark in JAWS absent through most of the last half of the films in which they ""star"" as killers. You can't imagine it, can you? Well... in this film, it happens.

So this is part of the whole Grindhouse rule that QT and RR are following.

I loved the whole experience but I have been really looking forward to see those purposely deleted scenes from the theater being included in the DVD releases, especially the lap dance sequence in ""Death Proof"". I read lot of the fans of Grindhouse are crying 'cash-cow' for Weinstein Company releasing the movies separately but we have to understand that they took a huge risk funding these films and it tanked huge in the Box office.

2861060,5,B000R7HY0K,"Death Proof is Quentin Tarantino's homage to the B movie genre form the late 60s, 70s and early 80s. Keep this in mind when you watch this film. Like the original low budget flicks, this film has very bad picture quality and sound, terrible editing, silly dialogue, revealing mistakes and bad acting. Of course, these characteristics were all accidental or due to a lack of talent in the original movies, whereas Tarantino has deliberately added these ""mistakes"" in order to recreate the feel of the old films. This might be a bit confusing or even annoying during the first half hour or so, because, unlike 30 years ago, this movie is not shown in a Grindhouse but a modern theater and you can't help but notice that the bad editing is deliberate and therefor misses the charm of the old B movies. Also, the fact that the film is set in 2007 but shot in a way that would be below standard even 30 years ago, slightly removes the charm it would have had, had it been set in the 70s. However, this changes about 30 min into the movie when cell phones, MP3 players and Japanese automobiles are replaced by muscle cars, references to cult classics and John Hughes movies, old school car chases, stunts and your typical Quentin Tarantino dialogues and soundtrack. The uncut European version could have done without some of the more boring conversations at the beginning of the film, though, but Kurt Russell more than makes up for this when he uses his old charm to talk Vanessa Ferlito into a lap dance and by the end of the film real life stunt woman Zoe Bell and Tracie Thoms will have you roaring with laughter as they seek to get even with Stuntman Mike. Although Death proof might not be quite as impressive as House of 1000 Corpses or The Devil's Rejects, it definitely is just as much fun.",1189900800,4,1793,4.537037037037037
2861071,5,B000R7HY0K,"Yes it sucks they are releasing Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez's films separately.  And yes it sucks most of us will more than likely end up shelling out more dough for either the theatrical version of ""Grindhouse,"" or some form of special edition package that, even if doesn't recombine the films the way they were in their glorious theatrical release, combines these two movies in some fashion - and gives us back the faux trailers, which were just as much a reason to see ""Grindhouse"" as either of the films themselves.

 ""Grindhouse"" was an experience.  That was the whole point of the project.  Bigger than just seeing a double feature, the creators wanted their audience to experience the exploitation pictures of the 70s, many of which inspired them to become the directors they are today, in all their over-the-top glory.

 Because the film was too long, too violent and released on Easter weekend, people just didn't get it, didn't want to see a couple of grainy, odd 70's exploitation style flicks (they weren't hits then either, and that's the whole point), it was rated `R' and largely off-limits to its target audience, or because the promos for the film so heavily focused on something as admittedly strange as a stripper with a machine gun leg - there are several theories - ""Grindhouse"" disappointed in theatres.

It is perhaps because of that we are now getting the films released separately and the experience has been, for the most part, broken up and abandoned.  Gone are those terrific trailers, though they admittedly would have seemed out of place as individual special features on just one the films; and gone is the thrill of what was a three-plus-hour, down and dirty, drive in spectacular.  Who knows if this decision was meant to recoup lost funds in order to release more versions down the road, or if the two films were always planned to live on their own after theaters, like any film that was part of a double feature during its theatrical release.

As I said, this is not the way I would prefer to relive ""Grindhouse,"" and I sympathize with those who would bash these two DVDs because releasing them separately not only distorts and truncates the experience, but this decision feels like it will ultimately prove to be a cash-grab by the studio when, six months down the line, they decide to release another version.  But the fact is, the ""Grindhouse"" films are still great and work well on their own.  Just because they are no longer a double feature doesn't mean each doesn't accomplish what it sets out to do expertly well. And realistically, this type of separate release makes sense in that these really are two separate films, not one long one.  But I loved ""Grindhouse"" in its entirety so much that I was looking forward to reliving the experience over and over, and I envisioned it becoming one of those staple movies the next generation watches behind their parents backs during sleep-overs and such.

Well, shoulda, woulda, coulda.  That's not the way, at least for now, the films will be released.  And my own hopes for the film's legacy are not what I am supposed to be reviewing.

Nearly as much as debating this releasing format, people have been debating which half of ""Grindhouse"" is the best - Tarantino's or Rodriguez's.  I will admit right off that I found much more to savor, as I always do, in Tarantino's film, ""Death Proof"".  Some have dismissed it as too talky or too boring or not the ""slasher"" film it was presented to be (though I don't recall being promised anything specific from the movie before its release).  It is first and foremost a hot rod thriller ala ""Vanishing Point"".  Cars, stunts, menacing characters - both evil and anti-heroes - and thrilling chases are the point of this vehicle.  As usual Tarantino doesn't just mimic the films and filmmakers he idolizes, but he raises the bar and does all the old stuff in a new, interesting and many times in a shockingly audacious way.  And the stunts in this flick are not only spectacular, but they are real; and I'll take that over CGI and camera trickery any day.

Which brings us to ""Planet Terror.""

Yes Robert Rodriguez's ""Planet Terror"" is the flashier, showier, more action-packed entry here, and just because I'm in the ""Death Proof"" camp doesn't mean I didn't love what Rodriguz did with this zombie throwback.  As both spectacle and parody, ""Planet Terror"" is big, loud and fun.  It has a great cast, some surprising cameos, and tons of great lines.  I think the problem I had with ""Planet Terror"" is that it was a zombie movie.  Not because it is a zombie movie (I love zombie movies), but because there have been so many lately and a lot of them have already been presented in a hip, self-winking manor as if they were already sending up old-school, schlocky 70's zombie movies.  Because of that, I always felt like I knew where ""Planet Terror"" was going and I was never that thrilled or gripped with suspense.  The movie managed to have some big surprises here and there and plenty of individual great scenes and moments.  I would never call it dull, or bad, uninteresting or anything other than expertly done - as I said, I liked this film too, it's just that by comparison, I think Tarantino offered up the more interesting film.

But, to each his own.  The criticisms for films like this - and with the goals these guys have in mind, which is really to deliver a piece of hopped-up nostalgia - are relative and negligible.  Too criticize ""Planet Terror"" for some of the things I did one could argue is missing the point.  The whole reason for these movies is to honor and revisit the over-the-top junk that these films were.  It that regard - and in terms pure entertainment and bang for the buck - these films both out do themselves.  But, as they say, I likes what I likes and ""Death Proof"" was more my style.  More ambitious and less obvious in its thrills, the movie builds a sense of dread and it gets that feeling of 70s cinema just right, from the opening shot and title cards, to its gasp-educing, thrillingly abrupt conclusion.  Kurt Russel is flat-out fantastic and real-life Tarantino stunt-woman Zoe Bell is a discovery and revelation.  As always with QT, this movie is dialog-heavy.  I savor his stuff.  If you don't, I can see why the movie may play like less than the sum of its parts for you.  But I love juicy dialog as much as I love the blood and goo that spills and flies out of bodies in movies like ""Planet Terror.""

And that is the genius here.

By giving us both sides of the coin - two major types and examples of 70s exploitation cinema - ""Grindhouse"" delivered on both a promise and a concept.  No two directors were more suited for the task, and it likely would have failed with any others at the helm.  Now that QT and RR have laid the blueprint, I look forward to seeing what other genre-dabbling directors could do with similar material (like all the guys who contributed those terrific afore-motioned fake trailers - I would definitely pay to see full-film versions of ""Machete,"" ""Thanksgiving,"" and ""Nazi Werewolves of the S.S."").  Sadly, because the films are now split, some of you may not feel the same excitement (and if you didn't see it theatres, for now at least, you won't see any of these trailers).

But rest assured, even separated, if you pick up either ""Death Proof"" or ""Planet Terror"" - preferably both (and assuming you know what you are getting into and what these two visionary directors are trying to do) you are in for one hell of ride.  For true film fans or just those in search of something daring, original, and way too entertaining, to miss these two films, or in the case of the fans boycotting their separation:  to avoid buying these two films, is to miss out on a great film experience.  Sure the real experience was better, but buying these separate is hardly a rip-off.  First, both come in jam-packed, two-disc sets with all kinds of bells and whistles, including deleted scenes.  And speaking of deleted scenes, since about a half an hour of each film had to be cut for the theatrical release, had they just released ""Grindhouse"" as we knew it, we would not be seeing the films in their intended entirety.

I don't know if that makes up for separating the two, but it is reason enough for fans of these films to rejoice.  Face it.  Had they released ""Grindhouse"" as we knew and loved it, we would still want to see the individual movies in their entirety, so most likely we would have wound up buying two products somewhere along the line anyway. I'm actually hoping somewhere down the line I do indeed get that chance.  No I don't want to see three or four more DVD releases of the individual films, but I'll spend some money on these as they are, for what they are, and the entire ""Grindhouse"" someday.

Terror was no doubt packed full of the craziest action and hilarious scenes but feels long and gets overwhelming towards the end. At least that's how it felt to me personally. However, ""Death Proof"" has so much style and the pay off at the end is tremendous. It's the most fun I've had at the movies since Jackass 2. The opening sequence of ""Death Proof"" was filmed in such a cool yet simple way. I loved the way Tarantino used the music and the low shots of the woman character's legs walking. I'm not saying it was technically good or anything else some film boy will scold me for implying. I'm just saying I thought the whole style of the film was, not only of course very Tarantino, but also just had such a cool style and flair to it.

I just purchased the DVD through Amazon and I'm looking forward to getting into the special features. It has over 5 Behind the Scene videos that I'm sure Tarantino packed with entertaining material. I do want the trailers and ""Planet Terror"" as one whole package just like other people on here complaining, but I'm cool with waiting to see those portions of Grindhouse once they are released together as a whole experience again in the future.

I wasn't surprised that it didn't do very well either , since it was basically an exercise in nostalgia and most movie goers today are young people who never experienced B movie double features . In that respect it was a calculated gamble by Weinstein to ever give the go ahead for this movie to begin with .

  Of the two I liked Deathproof much better , it had the feel and look of a 70s movie with Kurt Russell in a kind of psycho version of the Snake Pliskin character  . The only nudity though was in the Machete fake trailer which was disappointing since it was advertised as a movie that outdid any of the old B movies in every way and delivered on things that those old flicks never did  .

You people praise this man as if he's done something original. If this homage to grindhouse is so great, why aren't you extolling the grindhouse films of the past? I'm sure you didn't go out of your way and purchase those films. And even if you did, they probably would've gotten some really bad reviews. Right?

So let's be honest here, you like this boring, talk-for-45 minutes chick flick with a peppering of carnage because Tarantino's name is behind it. That's it. You're going to stand there and say this is the bomb and all that other crap. Give me a break. You got sucked into it from the hype machine like everyone else.

===========================================================================

Now, let's get started on the review: This is a movie which relies on excessive cursing to carry most of the dialog, and it got to a point that it was no longer cool but just annoying. That was not genius; That was plain dumb. C'mon, forty-something minutes of **** is too much for anybody except the low-attention span youth of today.

  I'm looking forward to this release as possibly a better experience of seeing Death Proof.  I only wish there was a Tarantino commentary.

  Planet Terror was no great shakes, in my opinion.  It was OK.  The idea of seeing a girl with a machine gun leg fly through the air killing soilders is kinda cool.  But then seeing her land in the ""screw me"" position with that look on her face without being hurt at all...it's like a blow up doll of a movie.  No weight to the action.  Ha, ha.

  In short, I didn't really value my Grindhouse experience enough to feel violated by separating the films.  Hope it helps them each make more money.  Hope more people see them.  Death Proof at least deserves a chance at a wider audience.  We'll see.",1189814400,,1010,4.375

2861087,1,B000R7HY0K,"(warning, this review will contain spoilers, maybe they will save real men the waste of money it would be to buy this hyped of load of feminist propaganda)  Ok, so now to the review.  There I was in the theatre, really enjoying what was so far, an awesome movie.  Yes, the hyped carchase scene was living up to it's hype, then all of a sudden-BAM! It turned from great to sucky in about 10 frames!  You want to know why?  because the evil hags defeat stuntman mike!  Now, when I was watching this the first time, I thought he was going to win, and all of you who were rooting for the evil hags are insane.  You see, they were the evil villains, Stuntman Mike is the hero of the film, so the fact that he died makes it a tragedy.  I was so mad I was literally shaking (like I could barely talk to anyone for about 3 days I was so Irate) when it turned out the evil hags win at the end, I was rooting for Stuntman to make a comeback so bad, and what happened to him was atrocious!  I hated them so bad, at the part where he was on the ground at the end with them in the highway, doing thier retarted cheering, I was literally praying that they would be ran over by a semi or something, it would have at least been a kinda happy ending then. Yes, Stuntman is the hero!  I cheered when he smashed that hippie girl up good, and roared with macho delight when he really gave it to that carfull of idiotic, noisy, and annoying hags.  Serves them right!  Man that wreck smarts! GO STUNTMAN!  Stuntman is so ultimately macho, with his cool hairdo, great taste in food and clothes, and contempt for women!  He rocks!
  Now you see why he is the ultimate hero, and now onto the women, and why they are the evil villains of the movie.  First of all, the now-sellout QT seems to be on some kind of ""I love it when women triumph over men, I love girlpower!"" trip.  Where did he get this crapshoot, awful ending idea from anyway?  Nice way to metaphorically kick all of us real men in the groin, QT.  Everyone knows that men are smarter, stronger, faster and can do math better than women, that's why, until the phony ending, they are such easy prey for the superior male role model and my personal hero, Stuntman.  Yes, QT truly must have turned into some kind of evil feminist (other wise known as feminazi) sympathiser, and made up this sorry ending to satisfy all of those women out there who, by the looks of this ending, somehow scare and intimidate QT with their girl power.  Newsflash QT, girlpower, meet my mighty male fist, the winner, my fist.  Next, the women in this movie are the villains, because they represent all evil women, who try to get all of a guy's hard earned money with thier decieving good looks, and try to claim it's your baby to get checks out of you, or claim some common law marriage crap.  These techniques also have another name: EXTORTION.  So you see, mighty Stuntman was doing the world a favor, and getting his jollies, two birds in one stone.  By doing the world a favor, I mean getting rid of young hot women before they have a chance to not have a job, spend up a man's hard earned cash, and drive him nuts.  I mean, the first group of girls were lame and boring, I hated them from the start, even Jungle Julia's feet and legs QT, jeez, do you think the camera spent enough time there?  Anyway, the point is, they were all a bunch of lazy pot heads with no jobs anyway, so who cares? (yes Jungle Julia did, but it was a lazy, do nothing job consisting of snappy one liners and playing tapes.  WOW!  STOP THE PRESS!)  They would have continued to be freeloaders, misering men's cash if they had not have been righteously SLAMMED by Stuntman, our savior.  And the second batch of ladies, Zoe looks funny, I liked Rosario, or used to, not after that infuriating ending.  Oh, and the hag with the dreads, who does she think she is anyway, with her inane, trying-to-be-bad-banter  I hate them all!  You see, there Stuntman was just trying to have a little fun!  For god sakes, none of the ladies were even hurt after it!  ""Hey that guy did NOT even injure any of us, lets shoot him, go chase him down, cause a serious wreck, and BEAT HIM TO DEATH!""  Murderers!  Watch out men, they will come for you, you had better start taking martial arts, and working out, and practicing your wheelman skills, I did to get ready for the evil feminazis after I watched this movie!  It was unbearable, it was like watching Snake Plissken get beat down by the spice girls, which brings me to the next topic:
  Physics flaws.  That's right, I, your oh so grandiose and knowledgeable reviewer, am going to shed light onto some of the physics flaws that will become readily apparent after my cosmic intellect points them out to you.  First, the trunk.  During the second half of the big car chase, the evil hags ram Stuntman's car (which is cooler than theirs!) from behind.  Now, did you notice how they eventually KNOCKED THE TRUNK off of his car, almost tore the whole rear end off, and there was oddly barely a scratch on the front of their car, even more so, as the no-driving dreads girl crashed into everything in sight?  Let's all just ignore the fact that to have done that much damage to an equally big and tough car, they would probably have maimed their radiator, or done some damage to some part of the engine at least, while the damage done to Stuntman's car from that was mostly cosmetic.  Stupid women, in real life, they'd have busted their radiator, and Stuntman would have just drove off as they overheated.
  Next:  Wasn't his car supposed to be deathproof?  The name maybe should have been changed to Death Resistant there QT, because it looked like during all of that ramming, that Stuntman was getting beat up pretty badly, while the hags weren't so much as phased by all of the rough ramming.  What a crock, think back about that if you've seen it, that final ride was beating him up a lot, and they weren't even flinching with all the ramming?  Yea right.  They'd have been getting bumped up and knocked around too, maybe knocking some of that smarmy attitude out of them.  (note:  never mind the fact that, being a stuntman, Stuntman Mike should have gotten away, in about equal cars, he would clearly be the better driver)
  Next:  The big wreck at the end, run that load by me again?  Jeez, did anyone actually watch it, anyone with some sense?  There is absolutely no way you come up and tap a car at the rear like that and make it go flipping 20 feet up into the air, all that would have done was maybe have made him fishtail out a bit, but that's about all.
  Next:  Now, In case all of the girl power lovers, and feminazis and their whipped boyfriends didn't get the message, the beating scene at the end was ludicrous.  Why?  They never would have beat him up like that, he didn't even fight back at all, what a crock.  Don't you think he'd have at least tried to run, or anything?  Never mind the fact that he is so cool and macho, he would have just beat them all down, and took their car, ran them all over for good measure, and gotten away again, which is what would have really happened, but for QT's stupid girl power trip.  A real man like that could have taken any stupid woman, or 3 of them for that matter.  Plus, wussy girl punches and kicks are minor annoyances at most, lacking real power, so please spare me all the fake brutal punch sounds and splattering blood, QT, until he hits back, of course, which would have happened if QT wasn't brainwashed.  Man that would have rocked, to watch those hags get their smarmy faces pummeled to a bloody mess, wouldn't be rudely yelling in his face then, huh?
  So, in closing, all of the above is why you should avoid this looser:  the ending, the most horrible, shocking, atrocious, crummy, awful piece of junk ever to be released.  But never fear, I have an ultra secret technique to make it rock:  turn it off right after the first wreck.  That's right, by doing that, you make it into a 45 minute movie, with an extremely mesmerizing ending that rocks the eons with its awesomeness!  Oh man, I could watch that wreck all day in slow mo, frame by frame.  That's the only reason to get the DVD, ditch that wuss ending, and enjoy the first half all the way, where all the whining hags get what they deserve, and all real men worship Stuntman as he was, before QT sucked it all up with his girl power garbage, ooh girl power, how about shut up and get me a steak, Zoe!

In true ""girlfriends"" fashion, we see how a group of women interact and react with each other, with other women, and finally, with a preditor. These women kick major a$$ but in a real way. For once, we see women not allow fear to paralyze them but rather, encourage them to fight for their lives. Awesome film. Feminist approved.",1189555200,4,636,4.6875

STORY: While on a night of drinking and partying, a group of sexy chicks are followed around by Stuntman Mike, an insane killer. He offers one of the girls a ride home and mentions that his car is death proof, meaning that It cannot be wrecked. But as he begins to drive fast and agressive, he mentions that it's *100%* death proof, meaning that it deflects death!

THOUGHTS: This is a major achievement in the hands of Tarantino. He nods the famous ""75% dialogue"" style used in his films, which works well here. And the final chase in the film, amazing!

So see this if Grindhouse is still in theaters in your area, or see it when it comes out on DVD!",1189209600,5,885,4.287425149700598
2861112,1,B000R7HY0K,"I don't care about Grindhouse not being packaged with Planet Terror.  True, in order for the whole grindhouse concept to be fully experienced as intended, you really have to see both movies jointed together.  Otherwise it's kinda like getting a cheeseburger without the fries.  And I don't care about the trailers not being included either which--I'm sorry--except for Machete, were really overrated and much ado about nothing.

The real problem with the release of Death Proof is that it is a terrible movie that will cause more than a few people who skipped it at the theaters to be nearly bored to death and ultimately disappointed in the comfort of their homes.

Don't get me wrong.  I'm a Tarantino fan from back when Reservoir Dogs was first released.  Of the films he's directed; I absolutely loved Reservoir Dogs.  Pulp Fiction is a timeless classic that will be on t.v. forty years from now.  Jackie Brown is the closest he's come to making a serious, grown-up film and it's one of my favorite films of all time.  Kill Bill?  C'mon... that movie rocked too hard, I consider it in the pantheon of some of the greatest action/drama/homage flicks of all time.

So after a long wait for the next piece of genius, we get Death Proof.

- The story:  The story had potential.  It had a lot of potential.  A stunt man serial killer who uses his car to take people out.  Great idea.  Tarantino does nothing with it.  Compare how much screen time the women get compared to Stunt man Mike and his car.  Douglas is on screen for scant minutes while the rest of the film follows around a bunch of characters who talk, and talk, and talk, and talk, and talk, and talk....

- The film making:  The movie looks good and is shot well.  But that's like taking a great high-def picture of a really ugly person.

- The action:  He should have called it Action Proof.  A little truth in advertising.  Frankly, the car chase at the end, I guess since it was hyped so much, was okay.  But I couldn't suspend disbelief long enough to say, ""Hey, why don't you just brake to a stop and let the woman climb off the freakin' hood already?""  You want to see a great car chase, watch The Matrix Reloaded.  You want to go to sleep and you're out of Ambien, watch Death Proof without the surround sound on.

- The characters:  Again, Kurt Russel was awesome and his character could have been become the next Jules or Mr. White.  Instead, he does nothing with it.  The women could not be more forgettable.

- That famous QT dialouge:  The is the movie's fatal flaw.  And it's all those numbskull media types and film reviewers who can't stop fawning over the dialouge in QT's movies.  Tarantino read too much of his own good press.  At some point he decided that if a little was good, alot more was better.  Wrong.  Put too much fertilyzer in your grass and you kill it.  Watching this film and listening to these characters talk at some points seemed like a Saturday Night Live parody of a Tarantino film.  Not the reaction you want the audience to have.  Note to QT, when they start giving out Oscars for dialouge, I'd be this indulgent.  Until then, just shoot the movie.

- Bottom line:  The film is ultimately very self-indulgent.  I believe he sat in an editing room, watching the final cut of this mess thinking he'd knocked it out the park; hopelessly in love with every syllable of his trade-mark dialog that starts off boring, becomes ridiculous at points, then meaders along until it becomes so tedious and annoying that it takes you right out the film.  Someone else on this site wrote that when you're QT, no studio is going to try and edit you and I agree.  That's a gamble a studio takes.  This studio gambled and lost (several tens of millions of dollars).  More likely, he felt confident that his vision would be commercially accepted because everything he'd touched before had turned to gold.  Well this one is big lump of mud.  Did I mention I did not like this film?",1189123200,10,3962,4.513399153737659
2861113,5,B000R7HY0K,"let me at first say that this is a fantastic movie.  i had the pleasure of being one of the few who willingly saw this in the theaters and got to enjoy the spectacle of two films being put together in such a presentation that makes one wish that they could experience it a million times over.  that is the true experience of an amazing live performance and something that can only be done a handful of times.  the two films fit together and complemented each other so well, it was like seeing two incredible bands play one show together and just fed off each other that it just blew your socks off.

this is the part where we get to buy the album.  we get to sit in the privacy of our own homes and remember all the parts that we saw with our friends that just exploded when we saw them live; and just like each band needs to put out their own album to be able to support themselves, so must these movies.

yes, seeing the movies together in a theater with hillarious fake trailers and missing scenes; laughing hysterically and being glued to your seat while trying to see if you could hold off the bathroom break for three plus hours was an incredible experience.  i wish i could see this movie like that over and over, but that's the telling of a truly incredible live experience --you will never see those two performances the same again and if you missed the experience you have no one to blame but yourself, and you can't be upset because you can't experience that at home.

as for me, i'm going to enjoy deathproof at home, maybe pause it a few times so i can go to the bathroom or make a sandwich, and remember the time i saw this movie in the theaters with friends and tell everyone i almost wet myself durring the last scene.",1189123200,4,1734,4.265243902439025

2861115,2,B000R7HY0K,"I'm not going to address the Weinsteins' decision to release Grindhouse in two installments. Sure, I'm disappointed that the fake trailers are not going to be included. But what really gets me is how meandering and poorly paced Death Proof is. Gone is the memorable, quirky dialog of Tarantino's earlier films. Gone is the ratcheting tention of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Gone is the style and intensity of Kill Bill.

What remains is incredibly long and unrewarding dialog scenes, a choice soundtrack, and B-movie production values mixed jarringly with expertly put-together tracking shots and cinematographic framing. While the climactic car chase is exciting, the actual end of the film kind of leaves the viewer holding the bag. And the protagonists are not only uninteresting, but several of them are downright unlikeable.

I think Rose McGowan, Kurt Russel, and Rosario Dawson manage to rise above the material -- I could watch them read phone books. But the rest of them are pretty replaceable, and Nicky Katt is completely wasted in a near-cameo role as a convenience store clerk. Check out ""The Limey"" sometime, and you'll see what I mean.

I guess it's a common mistake for people to defer to an artist's ""vision"" when he's previously worked some cinematic voodoo. They don't tell him that his dialog is meandering and pointless, that his characters are uninteresting, or that there's no real story going on. He must know what he's doing, because he's Quentin Tarantino, right? We should just stand back and let him work his magic. It'll all come together in the end, right? Well, it didn't.

2861127,5,B000R7HY0K,"My review:  Great movie.

Now let me just get something off my chest.  I am glad GRINDHOUSE is being released as two movies.  It should be.  They are two separate movies.  The double feature is a theatrical thing and can not be re-created on the small screen if they tired.

For those of you who missed it in theater...I am sorry.  You will eventually get your chance to see them together, but you will not get that experience you missed on the big screen in your local slum theater.

The movies being released on DVD are also in their full length glory.  Why pay for a movie that has 30 minutes cut out of it.  It worked for GRINDHOUSE, but what you will be buying is DEATH PROOF (30 mins) and PLANET TERROR (15 mins).

As for the trailers.  I am disappointed that they have not said that they are on the DVD, but maybe they will be.

Maybe it's because I watch all movies at my local Drive-In that I don't see what the big deal is.  I get double features all the time, and never complain about the two movies I watch on the big screen not coming out together.  Remember, they (Tarantino, Rodriguez) were trying to give the audience a old school theatrical experience.  They never said they were going to give you that same experience at your house.  You can always get both DVDs and play them back to back like a real double feature...and you'll get more movie now.",1188864000,4,1367,4.31496062992126
2861128,5,B000R7HY0K,"Once again Quentin Tarantino has taken several movie genres and smashed them together into something completely unique and original. Death Proof is an ingenious, if slowly-paced combination of slasher movie, car chase thriller and revenge flick. Just when you think you know where it's going, it veers off in a different direction (sometimes literally). For Tarantino fans, Death Proof will be absolutely delightful if you can get past the slow pace and extreme talkiness. Some people were bothered by the long stretches of dialog, but really that's what a slasher movie consists of. You meet the characters, then they chat about BS for about half an hour, then there's a kill. If you don't get to peek into the characters lives, you're not going to care about them when they are in jeopardy. The girls' performances and Tarantino's dialog make it far from intolerable.

All the Tarantino trademarks are present in Death Proof: stunning direction, shots of girls' feet, excellent use of music with old obscure pop songs, lots of dialog, and strong female heroines, but this time he throws a few new things into the mix. The setup of a slasher movie, Austin Texas flavor, and an amazing car chase. And if this movie doesn't make a star out of the great Zoe Bell, then there's truly no justice in the world. She is amazing. Zoe Bell alone makes Death Proof worth watching. She's just adorable and her climactic scene will have you on the edge of your seat. I must mention Kurt Russell too. This movie must be his best performance in ages. His Stuntman Mike is both exceedingly charming and frightening.

The DVD features the extended cut of Death Proof that premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. As for the longer cut itself, I feel that it's definitely better than the shorter cut. There are several great new scenes that make the film an even richer experience. Kurt Russell, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Vanessa Ferlito are all given more screentime which I think is a very good thing. Michael Parks' scene is longer, also a very good thing. There are more great details like the second group of girls' stop at a convenience store with Stuntman Mike not far behind. The longer film feels more complete to me, it feels more like a whole film. However, those that didn't like the shorter Death Proof certainly won't like the longer film any more.

As for the hubbub surrounding the DVD release, I say nonsense. It's probably a consequence of the film's low box office gross. Although Tarantino planned to release his preferred cut of Death Proof separately all along. I'm happy to be able to see Death Proof without having to sit through Planet Terror first. I'd much rather own the longer cut of the movie than just the theatrical version. I think Death Proof will work even better as a stand-alone feature film. I loved the theatrical movie but it worked best at the movie theater. Grindhouse just won't be quite the same on the small screen. So it makes sense to release Planet Terror and Death Proof separately. Perhaps someday in the future people will realize that they missed a completely unique and exciting moviegoing experience and the film will be rereleased in theaters. Until then, I'm happy to have the DVDs of the two movies.",1188864000,,3239,4.7803571428571425

That's too bad because DEATH-PROOF is by far the weaker half of Grindhouse.

This is the first movie where I felt the Tarantino formula didn't work.  Normally his dialogue is catchy, repeatable, and fun to listen to.  In this movie the women have nothing fun or memorable to discuss.  Furthermore they don't even talk like women when they debate about the finer points of a vintage car...sorry I didn't accept this for one second as anything plausible.

Deathproof does end on a strong note with a stellar car chase sequence, but unfortunately there's nothing before this scene to give the movie any additional gravity or to make the movie hold together.  I'm sure the Tarantino die-hard fans will buy this DVD and then buy the entire Grindhouse when it is inevitably RE-released.  Thus the entire marketing ploy by the studios.

2861158,5,B000R7HY0K,"First, a word about this childish boycott. ""Grindhouse"" gave us two brilliant genre films for the price of one in the theaters. It was a once in a lifetime experience for most of us and a chance to see the two most bada$* directors in Hollywood give us 3+ hours of hardcore horror/exploitation entertainment including the funniest faux-trailers you're likely to ever see (or not see if you missed it). And it bombed. Big time. Why? Because lazy America said it'd wait for the DVD because both films together were too long and they lost the chance to support a truly brilliant idea and show that we are sick and tired of cardboard cutout PG-13 teen horror and bad remakes of beloved cult classics. They went to see ""Disturbia"" instead. ""Grindhouse"" was what true horror fans -hell, what all true film fanatics- have been dying for and shame on all of you who missed it. So the studio took a loss for taking a chance on this idea and as a result, they've split the two films up with extra scenes that were cut for time and are giving us these two films as we haven't yet seen them, each in double-disc editions packed with extras. Awesome, right? Weeeeeellllll, now the same whiners who stiffed the films in the theaters are angry they missed out and want both films on one DVD (as if there'd even be room) for a discount price. Sorry, but it don't work that way. The theatrical cut was packaged as just that, an experience for the theaters simulating the double-feature drive-in days of old. Even if that experience would translate to DVD, why would the company re-release it in the same form that already failed miserably? The bottom line is this: we now have another chance to show that THIS is what we as horror fans want to see and the only way to do that is to buy these great-looking DVDs. The notion that making the films bomb yet again on DVD is going to lead to some super-duper deluxe theatrical edition must have been conceived in the mind of a five year old on crack. If we don't support these editions, these films will die and the studio will waste no more money on this failed project or any like it in the future. This is basic business sense. Support true horror and other genre films and boycott crappy remakes and bloated sequels *cough*Spiderman3*cough* instead.  YOu know you'll double-dip on those.

""Death Proof"" was Quentin Tarantino's half of the ""Grindhouse"" experience.  It's a film of stunning originality that switches gears between genres seamlessly and, in true Tarantino fashion, pays tribute to it's influences all the way going so far as to name the films it strives to emulate.  ""Planet Terror"", Robert Rodriguez's zombie-heavy gorefest that served as the other half of ""Grindhouse"", captured the spirit of exploitation cinema by being over-the-top and silly, but ""Death Proof"" pays homage to it while building a more subtle, character-driven masterpiece.  Kurt Russell plays an old stunt driver with a car built so that the driver can not be killed no matter how bad he crashes (death proof, see?).  Well, the guy is a bit of a misogynistic bastard (and a wuss at that) and he gets his jollies by murdering young, beautiful women, possibly as a way of getting back at a world that doesn't share his enthusiasm for -or even a vague awareness of- the carphilic genre films that make up his very existence.  His weapon of choice?  His stunt car, of course. They crash, he lives, they die.  There is an amazing scene where a crash with a car full of girls is replayed over-and-over, each repeat focusing on a different girl and her particular gory demise.  Unbelievable.  The girls are all well fleshed-out as characters with lives and personalities of their own and you just don't know who will live and die.  You cheer when they live, you gasp (and then cheer at the way it was filmed) when they die; a win-win situation.

Rose McGownan is indeed the grindhouse queen as she co-stars in both films and steals the show in every scene she appears in.  Real-life stuntwoman Zoe Bell makes her acting debut and proves an impossibly endearing on-screen presence who shall henceforth be known as Spiderwoman to me after her incredible stuntwork here.  Rosario Dawson charms as always and the rest of the cast is beyond solid as well.

  The last twenty minutes of ""Death Proof"" are among the greatest of any film I've ever seen.  Edge of your seat barely begins to describe the chase sequences and the finale had me literally applauding in the theater as I laughed myself silly.  You will not see the ending coming unless you've see or heard about it already.  The rest of the film is splattered with homages and references to classic drive-in fare, humorous and profane dialogue, horror cliches (horny + stoned + female = splat!), and more QT goodness.

This extended cut features the infamous ""reel missing"" scene featuring a very sexy lapdance and more of the film's awesome music.  There is also a black-and-white sequence where Russell and Dawson indulge in Tarantino's creepy foot fetish and a hilarious convenience store scene which stars the almost undrinkable ""Big Red"" soda in damn near every shot.  I laughed harder every time the camera focused on the offending soft drink.  The special features are impressive; the highlight for me was watching goretastic horror director Eli Roth plead with Kurt Russell in-between takes where Roth's character had to diss the horror legend.

Buy this film, buy ""Planet Terror"" (there is a $5 off coupon for it included here if that helps), and wave your copies at the moron down the street who's boycotting because this is brilliant filmmaking and denying yourself this kind of entertainment over sour grapes is self-punishment.

Death Proof is one of the best of 2007 so far.  It is another cool, original and stylish film from Quentin Tarantino.  A cross between a slasher movie where a car is used in place of a knife and an action movie with a chase scene that would rival The French Connection.

Also Zoe Bell the stuntwoman in real life who worked on the Tarantino's Kill Bill movies, who now is making her acting debut as what else, a bad blank stuntwoman, and she does her own stunts, she performs one, if not the best car chase scene I've seen in a movie.

Special features:
*) Never-before-seen footage including the ""missing reel"" (containing Vanessa Ferlito's unseen lap-dance sequence) as well as a black-and-white segment in the film's second act
*) Finding Quentin's Gals featurette
*) The Guys of Death Proof featurette
*) Kurt Russell as Stuntman Mike featurette
*) Introducing Zoe Bell featurette
*) Quentin's Greatest Collaborator: Editor Sally Menke featurette
*) Trailer for Double Dare
*) International poster gallery",1187136000,166,1601,4.703571428571428

This film is a work of love, more so than the rest of Tarantino's admittedly fabulous projects. The opening scenes reproduce the comfort of a crappy bar and rainy night better than any film I can remember.

The people that are not buying this video because it has been split or because of ""corporate greed"" are going to burn the stupid thing.  They're simply trying to justify their actions.  Me, I thought the experience in the theater was pretty much on target with the director's intent.  I thought Planet Terror was much better than Death Proof, only because it started out at a faster pace.  I'm not looking for plot or story arcs in a movie with missing reels, so just lay it on me.  However, that's what I got in Death Proof, as it's been said before, a lot of women yakking about nothing in particular for most of the movie was pretty much an indication that the experience itself was winding down.  I, for one, am glad that they are releasing them seperately only because I don't want the second half, Death Proof, and as such, I don't want to pay for it.  I'm sure if they release them on a four-disc package (since both undoubtly will have two discs) then they are going to charge out the Wazoo.  Death Proof sucked and so I don't have any desire to fork over approximately $20.  Just put the trailers on both discs and I'll be happy.",1186704000,,1213,4.355555555555555

Now they are releasing the films separately? What are they thinking? I do believe that each movie on its own is fun and worth watching but I thought the whole point of releasing Grindhouse originally was to replicate the feel of going to the movies in the 70's! When I was leaving the theater the first thing I said is that I cannot wait for this to come out on DVD. And now I am disappointed! Personally, if they released both Death Proof and Planet Terror singly AND released a disc as it was shown in the theater, I would buy all three! I am THAT MUCH of a fan of these films but to not even offer the option to see the film (Grindhouse, not Death Proof or Planet Terror) as the directors intended on DVD is a travesty!",1186358400,25,1076,4.253658536585366

The problem with this edition of Death Proof is #1, this is an extended cut and #2 its half of the two films that made Grindhouse (fake trailers may not be included?). Don't get me wrong, I'm curious to see what Tarantino did ,but I want to buy the movie I saw in the theaters...and I've told many people about Grindhouse and they are excited to see it. Too bad they won't.
Its really sad to see the fait of Grindhouse. For those who didn't see it in the theaters...you'll never know how great it was. That is of course if The Weinstein Company gets a grip. The theatrical cut needs to see the light of day on DVD!",1186358400,5,924,4.2259887005649714

i saw the integral version, so i won't be bitchin' about the mutilated DVD release in the states, but reviewing the film instead.
2 stories, first is slightly better in terms of buildup and suspense, ends way way too bloodily for my taste. lapdance scene was great :D.
second story a relief, damn, a happy end.. i didn't expect that and i was so happy when it happened..
great film. not necessarily a movie theater thing, perfectly watchable on DVD. especially if you don't like seeing repeated scenes of a bloody car crashes.

2861192,1,B000R7HY0K,"You have to be joking!

In Australia, despite fans being pumped for the release of Grindhouse, we're getting the separate releases of Death Proof and Planet Terror in theatres.

So the only thing we could do was wait until Grindhouse was released on DVD and then see it.

Only now it looks like they're planning on releasing Grindhouse in split versions on DVD in the US.

Last time I looked, Grindhouse - Grindhouse has two films, trailers and runs 195 minutes and that's the film we've been hanging out to see. It's also the creators' vision, but I guess that doesn't mean anything.

No matter how good these films may be, they are NOT Grindhouse. Even if Death Proof and Planet Terror are ***** films, this insulting joke of a release gets * (and that only because Amazon doesn't have a zero rating).

If they wanted to wring more money out of us, they could have released the separate films on DVD in 'complete' versions. After all, Tarantino himself said they shot the two flicks as full films then edited them back down so they were Grindhouse-worthy. Fans of the cinema version will probably pay to see the 'original' versions of the films. I would. It would also let viewers who didn't like both films get the one they want.

But no, we get this pathetic travesty.

Release the theatrical version of Grindhouse on DVD and you get my money. Until then...",1182384000,50,1361,4.595041322314049
