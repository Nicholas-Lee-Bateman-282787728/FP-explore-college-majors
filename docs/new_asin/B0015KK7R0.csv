I have the anniversary dvd with all the songs, but I wanted the tapes and didn't want to buy them individually. I recommend getting the clamshell ones with 6 tapes. I'm not sure if it was just my VCR, but I had a lot of trouble getting these tapes to play. only grammar rocky played and the sound kept going in and out on the other tapes while the science rock was totally fuzzy. I don't remember ever having a problem like this as a child and I watched those tapes over and over. I guess the tapes didn't hold up and I don't blame the seller for that. The newer, Disney clamshell ones played better.",1473724800,,743,4.13103448275862

I learned so much from these as a child and can still sing almost every word to each multiplication rock song. I can see now that he will be doing the same. Thank you!!!",1383004800,2,320,4.015625
