8195878,5,B000QE1J64,"All three of these:
- Darwin's dilemma
- The Privileged Planet
- The Mystery of Life

Are totally awesome films.
I am especially impressed by the arguments surrounding ""Irreducible Complexity"" and ""The bacterial flagellum""

The way the cells work within the body like a micro manufacturing plant etc.
VERY COOL!

I also realize that The Theory of Evolution is more a religion than it is a science.
And as such, its priests are not about to give up without a fight.

Never the less, the Christian will really enjoy these three films.",1262476800,,532,4.75
