8754541,5,B01D01K5XW,"I was not expecting what I got and thank you gods of film for this paradox of twisted fates. Shot in a bizarre stop-go, animated creatures terrorize humans in search of the ""embryo of the universe"" i.e.- The Biblical Fruit in Genesis. This film is absolutely worth buying/ watching or for your collection. If, like me, you love Jan Svankmajer you'll love this film. 5 outta 5 :)",1490659200,,378,4.573529411764706
