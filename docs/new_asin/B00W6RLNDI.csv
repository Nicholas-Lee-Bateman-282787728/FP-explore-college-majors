7125541,5,B00W6RLNDI,"This is a lovely, colorful DVD with high quality sound and music.  You can choose any of the four fireplaces from a traditional Christmas fireplace with all its cheerful, festive decorations to a plain fire that can be played year round.  The other two fires are nice, too and each of the four can be played continuously for uninterrupted enjoyment or all can be played as one continuously.  Easy to use DVD that is sure to make your holiday experience more pleasurable without the fireplace cleanup.  Can be played with the sounds of a crackling, popping fire or with lovely Christmas music from classical selections to familiar carols.  All instrumental selections.",1431129600,8,667,4.972972972972973
7125542,5,B00W6RLNDI,"This DVD is just wonderful. It turns your house into a cozy home. In this DVD you can choose between four different fireplaces. Once there is a wood fire, then a Christmas fire, Christmas logs and a classic fireplace. When you choose the Christmas fire you see a fireplace with very nice Christmas decoration, this one has the feeling of being in a castle. When it comes to background noise, you can choose between wonderful relaxing Christmas music or fire sound. My daughter and I loved the Christmas music, we were thrilled by the atmosphere and the fireplace is wonderful snugly, we really enjoyed listening to the beautiful music. A DVD that has inspired us and you can use this DVD not only at Christmas time. In the other time you just take the normal fireplaces with fire sound. A great DVD for every occasion.",1430006400,11,818,4.6482758620689655

7125558,5,B00W6RLNDI,"Great fireplace dvd. SO happy we decided on this one!  I think what sold me was the choice of the 4 different scenes. Can't go wrong. Nice music too, if you want a change from the wood sounds. Very clear HD quality. Great value!",1449705600,,228,4.181818181818182

7125562,5,B00W6RLNDI,"This is a great Fireplace DVD for Christmas! It really gets you into a festive mood (and it's only June now!). With all of the options for fireplaces, music, natural sound, etc. - it really is an extremely versatile DVD. The fires take up the screen and the Christmas fireplace is really cheery with all of the Christmas decorations (and Christmas music if you like that). If you want a DVD with different themes, then this is the one for you. Hig quality, sharp photography too. Well done!",1433894400,3,490,4.579545454545454

8712361,5,B00W6RLNDI,"This is a great DVD. I use this as a background on a big screen in my living room when we have parties. I love the selections you can make on the menu. I like to use it in our bedroom at night during the Christmas, and Holiday season. It's nice to fall asleep to the soft music and sounds of the fireplace.  I am a Huge fan of Christmas!! I Farm Christmas trees. We are opening our new Christmas Store later this year, I am going to purchase a few dozen of these DVDs to give away as drawing prizes for our Grand Opening.",1501027200,2,521,3.961904761904762

8712366,5,B00W6RLNDI,"Glad the producers called it a ""Christmas"" Fireplace and not some generic, politically-correct moniker. Love this DVD! Menu's are intuitive, disc loads quickly. Image quality of the 4 fireplaces is excellent. I prefer the crackling sounds most of the time. They sound natural - very sharp and crisp -  like they were close-miked when recorded. Thus you don't get that hollow, reverberant distant dull sound. The music choices are great (and sound good) if that's your preference. Very realistic and very well done. Highly recommended!",1483142400,,534,5.2823529411764705
8712367,5,B00W6RLNDI,"I'd love to have a real fireplace, unfortunately I don't.  This is the next best thing. This dvd is well done. The angle of the camera capturing the fire only shows the interior walls of the fireplace containing the logs and the fire.  The picture quality is very good.  Play, is an endless loop.  I've had it running all day.  The loop is not seamless.  The fire burns down to small flames and embers, then will start again as a full blaze.  I don't mind this, since most of the time you don't notice the transition if you're running it for a long period of time in the background. There is a choice between playing holiday music or the sounds of the fire (which I prefer), and the fire sounds are crisp and clean with no background noise. The music is both classical and popular.
There are four different fires on this dvd, 3 of just the fire close up, and the 4th a scene of a sort of victorian room with a decorative mantel and holiday decor.  I don't think this fire scene is as effective in simulating a real fire experience for me.
I like to put on this dvd with the full screen fire, and while it's playing I burn a balsam pine incense to complete the illusion of a real fireplace.
Just makes the holidays so much more fun.",1481760000,3,1231,4.253218884120171
8712368,3,B00W6RLNDI,"Fun if you like to add a virtual fireplace to your festivities. HD quality, runs 100 min.
with some Christmas music; you have 4 fireplaces to choose from. Problem is the 4 fireplaces
look alike, except for the unappealing ""rich house"" drab one; I love these with plenty of
Christmas music; unfortunately, only one fireplace has Christmas music, the rest have
generic classical themes; it's good but I prefer the ""Christmas DVD with Falling Snow/X Mas Lights/Fireplace and Fireworks ""
from the same seller, which is more festive and versatile. It's good quality HD video but I 'm left wanting for more. ..",1477872000,,604,4.87378640776699
