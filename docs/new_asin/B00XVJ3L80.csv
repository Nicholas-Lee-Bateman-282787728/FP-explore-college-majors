So this kid Josh installs this app that is going to change his life, or so it says, you have to type in goals that you want to achieve, and he wants to have more viewers on his channel, but the more success he gets, the weirder the app gets and more demanding. I watched it for free on another streaming service. I probably wouldn't actually put down money, besides membership fees to watch it.",1488758400,,596,4.330357142857143
8716767,3,B00XVJ3L80,"Josh (Jeremiah Watkins) is an unemployed techno-geek who spends his time in his rent due apartment making reviews for U-Tube. He signs up for an app called i-Lived. The app helps him achieve what he desires, but there is something he must do first. The app takes control of his life.

We have seen similar control film with a caller. This one uses an app instead. The backwards ""E"" in the title is a major clue the reveals itself early in a mirror early on. The acting was okay and the plot could have moved better.  3 stars is generous.

8716768,4,B00XVJ3L80,"An app reviewer discovers an app that promises a huge change in his life, and it starts to actually happen. New girlfriend, money, success, until he stops using the app and starts to lose everything. When he logs back in, the app requires greater sacrifices on his part. Killer app? Sounds stupid beyond belief. But I dig the director. Loved his Maniac remake, and P2 wasn't bad. This movie is surprisingly in between the two in terms of quality. The acting and direction are really good and the story is very engaging. Even before the horror elements come in, and they come in way later in the movie, its a good watch, interesting. After they come in, the movie gets even better. Solid, and way better than I could have imagined, I give credit to the director.",1437523200,2,761,4.562043795620438
8716769,5,B00XVJ3L80,"Directed by a Frenchman who also gave us films like P2 (2007) and remake of Maniac (2012), I-Lived (2015) is a film about 20-somthing geeky loner by the name of Josh, who is unemployed without income, his girlfriend just dumped him, he is about to get evicted from the place he rents, and whose mother is terminally ill.  Day by day, all that Josh does is play video games, post videos of his app reviews, and hang out with his dorky Asian friend.  His life changes for ""better"" when he discovers a phone application by the name of I-Lived.

The film is basically a modern take on the old Germanic tale of Faust or if you like Polish folktale of Pan Twardowski.  The film features some funny moments as well as some tense and jump-off your seat ones.  I would classify this film as dark-thriller with some comic moments.  The film feels very indie. The ending of the movie together with the soundtrack made me give this film full-five stars.

Signed,

I-Devil

ps. Read your contracts...kids.",1436832000,,992,4.590909090909091
8716770,4,B00XVJ3L80,"Now this movie was rather interesting.  I'd heard about it roughly a year ago, and now that I've gotten the chance to check it out, it was pretty much exactly as I'd expected.  That's a good thing.  We (the ""technology"" generation) tend to just click away whenever a contract pops up in assumption that said contract is nothing more than you're typical ""results may vary"" when, in fact, ANYTHING could be included in these TERMS OF SERVICE.

The film revolves around Josh (Jeremiah Watkins), a down on his luck, recent college grad with a degree from Stanford.  This poor guy just has everything going against him at the moment.  His girlfriend cheated and left him, he doesn't have a ""paying"" job, his landlord is after him for 3 months in back rent and he is a total disappointment to his parents.  Oh, and did I mention his mother has terminal cancer and isn't expected to live much longer?  Yeah, his life is in the crapper and the future isn't looking much better.  Luckily, he uses his time to reviews apps on YouTube.  (How he manages to have money for a REALLY nice Apple computer, internet service, a surveillance system, or that big flat screen TV, I have NO idea?!)  He comes across and app called I-Lived.  Decides to give it a go and initially gives it a terrible score.  However, after deciding he was too quick to judge, he gives it another shot.  Low and behold, things start to go his way?!  Deciding that his good fortune has nothing to do with the app (with the help of his new, HOT girlfriend) he cancels his membership.  Unfortunately things quickly return to the way they were.  When he decides the app gave him everything, he REactivates his account, but this time the app asks him to perform far more than just a couple of pick up lines.

Again, I thought this movie was VERY creative as it deals with the very same thing most of us do on a daily basis.  The only reason I didn't give it a five star rating was due to the fact that towards the end it began to drag and I found myself constantly looking at the time to see how much was left.  Also, the final scene seemed an after thought to just finalize the movie.  But other than that, very entertaining!

Final Verdict:  Definitely worth checking out!",1436572800,3,2228,4.46039603960396
