7999673,5,B0000CNY5I,"This movie is truly a forgotten treasure from an era of classic cops and robbers comedies. The stars, the plot, and the acting are perfect for the movie. This movie is hard to find and is rarely played on tv. I don't know the reasons why but it is a shame, I'm sure a lot more people would enjoy seeing it as I did.",1369872000,,315,3.9375
7999674,5,B0000CNY5I,"I was put off buying this dvd for a while,due to other reviews,but after trying to find anther release around the world,with no such luck,went ahead and purchased this copy. Well I do not see what other reviewers are getting at,this dvd version at 89 mins is complete,if you look at film guides all state this running time,I even checked an old uk photoplay mag from 1973,also reviews on the internet are the same running times. So don`t be put off buying as I saw this first in the 1970`s and it`s still a top end cop comedy,good idea and much better than alot of new films,you will not laugh out loud,but it will bring a smile to your face,enjoy. guy vase aberdeen scotland uk.",1277337600,4,679,4.44
7999675,3,B0000CNY5I,"Not to beat this topic to death, but here's a couple more comments.  The present movie is far from being ruined.  It's still enjoyable.  The spirit and feel are still there.  It's just that for those who have seen it and enjoyed it in its first form, the alterations are annoying and pointless and at the expense of the original total experience.

The original version was closer to 100 minutes in length.  A few examples of the differences: the hospital scene was longer giving it more continuity; the interplay between the two cops in the supermarket was extended; there was a birthday party for the Bologna character's son, during which the cops discussed further their caper; classical violin music played during the entire bowling alley segment (which also had a few more scenes to it), almost to the point to where it was difficult to hear the dialogue; the final ending scene was the funeral for the Mafia chief, with a repeated slow camera pan of the faces of the mourners as the music played, not a still shot of the Bologna character floating in the pool.

Movies like this don't always appeal to a broad audience.  However, once released, they shouldn't be tampered with for the sake of garnering a few more viewers.  It's accepted practice (unfortunately) to heavily edit the content, format and length of movies for network television broadcast.  But why would a studio release the television version on VHS and, especially, DVD?  This is the format people buy to get the real McCoy - and hopefully more.",1153440000,14,1517,4.773946360153257
7999676,5,B0000CNY5I,"For someone that has been a NYPD COP BUFF since I was twelve, this movie is the HOLY GRAIL. Not only is it funny, it is New York funny. Make that NYPD-pre-Goodfellas Italian-American funny.

The look and dialogue are priceless. As the bad guys get away, Police Officer Joe Bologna tells his young partner...""WHO CARES!""

RIP, costar Cliff Gorman...Many NYC based actors.

One major flaw? In the last scenes the green/white/black old color scheme NYPD  RMP..""Radio Motor Patrol.."" Police Car changes at least 3 times..Since you are looking at the color you don't notice the bad editing but who cares?

If you love the NYPD and the 1970's NYC, you will love this movie..

OK..Mr. Eastpool?",1151884800,8,687,4.879310344827586
7999677,4,B0000CNY5I,"I remember seeing this one on TV way back in the 1980's. It was a film, while not anywhere near the level of film making of say ""The Godfather"" or ""Apocalypse Now"", is still one of my favorite movies from the 1970's.  But I'll admit that nostalgia also factors into this review (one extra star).

Cops And Robbers is the story about two New York City cops: Joe and Tom, who are jaded, cynical, and tired on playing it straight, living paycheck to paycheck on their meager policeman's salaries. Joe and Tom talk about how things are tough and that how everybody is a crook. They want to live on ""easy street"". Live the good life. Now. In fact the film opens up with Joe (Joseph Bologna) robbing a liquor store.

Joe confesses to his partner and friend, Tom (Cliff Gorman) about the robbery, Tom feeling the same way about things as Joe, wants in on the next one. They want to do a big job, to do a fantastic score, to achieve their goal of being wealthy and being able to provide for their families. But how to accomplish this?

A mobster and fence Pasquale ""Patsy"" Aniello (John P. Ryan) is taken to the precinct (for questioning[?]) where both Tom and Joe work. Tom eavesdrops on the interview of Patsy by a police detective. He hears Patsy say that he is a ""salesman"", that he ""buys"" and ""sells"" things.

Tom then goes to Patsy's mansion (with Joe outside in disguise), and approaches him with the idea to do a crime for a price of $2 million dollars. Patsy, a little suspicious, decides to do business with the two and tells them to steal securities, treasury bonds, bearer bonds with no name on them. To steal about $10 million dollars worth. Bring them back to him and they will get $2 million cash.

Will Joe and Tom be successful? Will the mob give them their ticket to easy street - $2 million dollars? Or will the mob take both the bonds AND their lives instead?

This film was made back in 1973. And it shows. The fashions, the hairstyles, watch for Joe Spinell's (The Godfather I and II,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Maniac/dp/B000JU7JIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Maniac</a>) shirt and hairdo! You don't see the cops using computers to take down information, but typewriters! The buses, the cars, everything is a time capsule from those days.

Grady Tate (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Schoolhouse-Rock-Special-30th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B00005JKTY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Schoolhouse Rock! (Special 30th Anniversary Edition)</a>) lends his voice and does a fine job with the song ""Cops And Robbers"". One thing I believe is unfortunate is that the film is shown in full screen, not widescreen. I personally would have enjoyed the film more if it had been shown in widescreen. The editing and the general quality of the film look good to me. There is a little color bleed in a scene where both Tom and Joe are in a supermarket and a florescent sign comes into the frame. But this is minor. The overall picture quality of this transfer is good. The sound, although mono, is good, too. As for extras, the original movie trailer is included with the DVD.

I have read the reviews on this site regarding the VHS version of Cops And Robbers. About the bad editing, speeded up film, etc. But I don't see it here. The editing seems correct, cohesive and tells the story properly. All the characters talk in a regular tone.

There is one question in my mind about this film's ending. Now, I don't want to spoil it for anyone looking to purchase this film, so I won't go into detail about the ending of the film, But I'll say if my memory serves me correctly, I remember a slightly different ending than the one shown on this DVD.

Oh well, maybe I have it wrong, I really don't remember (again, the last time I saw this movie was back in the 80's).

This is a very good 70's New York movie, though. The acting by Cliff Gorman and Joseph Bologna is good (as well as everyone else). There are some laughs, seeing Joe and Tom's interaction with people who are concerned only with themselves was funny. And there is suspense when they finally make their move and try and get the bonds. As well as when they deal with the mob also. John P. Ryan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-s-Alive/dp/B0002KQNKY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It's Alive</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Runaway-Train/dp/0792838424/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Runaway Train</a>) is also great as Pasquale ""Patsy"" Aniello.

If you are into 70's films, or films that take place in New York City, I recommend this DVD.",1117843200,6,4651,5.056135770234987
