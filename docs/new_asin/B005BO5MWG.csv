4643834,5,B005BO5MWG,I love all the old tv series. This is a well produced beautiful series. It will make you laugh and cry an d keep pressing play! And Treat Williams is quite handsome to watch. It makes you want to live in a small mountain town.,1374537600,,226,4.044444444444444
4643835,5,B005BO5MWG,Loves every minute!!! It was like watching real life. The story was very well written. The characters became my friends. I miss them now that it is over.,1371081600,4,153,4.5
4643836,5,B005BO5MWG,"I purchased this complete series for my Mother. I had watched the series when it aired, but my Mother doesn't really watch TV. She had watched the entire series from the library and wanted a complete set, as she loved it. She is very happy with having it to watch whenever she wants.",1369353600,,283,4.3584905660377355
4643837,5,B005BO5MWG,i loved this show when i was in high school/college and loved it just as much the second time around!,1368316800,2,101,4.1
4643838,4,B005BO5MWG,"This series is overall pretty depressing but has a lot of different family situations, might spark some different ways to handle things",1362960000,,135,5.181818181818182
4643839,5,B005BO5MWG,"Love having the whole set combined of one of the best shows ever. This will always remind my husband, daughters and I of a special time during their teenage years that we watched Everwood together.",1356652800,,197,4.6571428571428575
4643840,2,B005BO5MWG,"NOT a family series;suggested series given. A series that starts OK but you get the feeling the writers are trying to add any PC thought that strikes them into most episodes. For series that are actually great I would recommend: HEARTLAND (A+,not simple,but honest,well written,very entertaining),BALLYKISSANGEL (A,funny,captivating,wish it was longer,real to life,set in Ireland),WIND AT MY BACK (A-,referred to as the
Canadian Waltons,not as good as the Waltons but worthwhile,well written and acted,entertaining),FATHER DOWLING MYSTERIES (A+,an
older series,but great.not preachy,real but decent,great older series).
Everwood IS NOT a family series,including for teenagers. Very PC.More like a tawdry soap opera. I am not a prude and appreciate real life
series,but this is just over the top. Faithful Catholic Doctor performs abortions (mothers health not at risk)but goes to confession after
(not debating abortion here but faithful Catholics equate abortion with willful murder).Sex is the most often topic,including parents
discussing the sex life of their children and how good it is for them. Vibrators,boys who play with dolls,doctor sexually involved with
the wife of patients all accepted as maybe not great-but hey,that's life. VERY PC.I would not recommend it for any family I know.
The series suggested above are all great;real to life,not preachy,decent and very,very entertaining.",1495324800,,1397,5.819512195121951
4643841,5,B005BO5MWG,"Just as the title says, this has to be one of the best written shows I've ever watched. I watched it when it originally aired, and this is one of few shows that I could watch over and over again. This show is related to modern life even today, which in my opinion, makes it so great!

With that being said, the case in Season One was badly damaged in shipment, but discs were unharmed. I originally tried to return/refund, but first, Amazon didn't offer to automatically reorder it. Not wanting to be out another $100 until the damaged one was refunded upon return, I just kept it!

Notice how I didn't rate the show over the shipping aspect of it, as most do. That has nothing to do with the rating of the show itself.",1492732800,2,719,4.279411764705882
4643842,5,B005BO5MWG,excellent drama and acting.  unusual story,1487894400,2,42,6.0
4643843,1,B005BO5MWG,"The 1 star is NOT for the actual show or content. I bought this as a gift for my wife. She loves this show.

My 1 star is about the quality of the DVD itself. I don't know what they call the transfer process when they transfer from film to DVD, but whatever it's called, the quality is TERRIBLE. VERY grainy, and the video will just randomly go dark, then bright, then dark, then bright, then dark over and over. Either get the Blu Ray (don't know how good that is though) or buy it as a digital download/streaming purchase. Do not buy this disc set.

And no it is not the DVD player or HDMI cable or TV. We tried these discs on 2 different TVs, and DVD players. Same issue on both. So it's not my devices.",1485648000,,706,4.071942446043166

4643847,5,B005BO5MWG,"This the best TV series I have seen since the Walton's,  It take on serious issues without being to far over the top. You fall instancing in love with the actors and the story line is moving as well as thought provoking.  It's to bad there is not more shows like this one. I would recommend this series with anyone with teenage children to watch together.",1461801600,,355,4.363636363636363

4643854,5,B005BO5MWG,Disappointed that only Season 1 had Spanish subtitles. The other three are only in English. I never knew this would happen.,1428624000,,123,4.904761904761905

4643856,5,B005BO5MWG,Everwood is undoubtedly the best series I have ever seen!!! The actors make you fall in love with them. The stories are great for the entire family. Relevent and interesting plots. Worth every cent and my husband and I are watching it a second time around.,1426291200,2,256,4.586956521739131

4643860,4,B005BO5MWG,"I always have to grade these series on a curve, so Everwood is not the best I have seen, but captivating enough to hook me emotionally through all of the episodes and keep me involved to the end. The characters are compelling and true considering the dual and evolving natures of many of them, especially Doc Andy.  I was a little uncomfortable how so many of the characters were betrayed and thrown under the busMadison, Doc Jake, Colins, Irv, Reid, Stephaney, Dr. Abbotts sister,  Dr. Linda, and the poor helpless husband of Amanda.  Delia was a little overdrawn and a bit over the top in snippiness and precociousness so less likable than the other characters.  I had a lot of little sisters and none were like that!  I love the characters of the pompous good hearted Dr. Abbott and his gentle wife;  I loved the nerdy Hanna contrasted with the ever evolving Bright along with Amy and Ephram and their never-ending teen-angst lover affair.  But is that not the job of the writers and actors to convince us these are real people and not just imaginary people?  The actors who portrayed these characters were superb.  As for the writing I thought it was very good, great story lines, and deeper than usual philosophical conversations and considerations.  I was especially appreciative that the writers (or producers) dropped the story line about Amys involvement in the Planned Parenthood clinic and the pending affair with Andy and the pro-abortion activist professor.  I would have liked to see Madison again and her relationship with Ephram resolved, so it was sad to see the series end without a fifth season where Madison would have undoubtedly reappeared.  The fourth season seemed a little contrived, but probably because the writers and producers did not know they were on the chopping block until the last episodes.  But this has happened so often with many excellent series.  I wonder how these stories are constructed, with a complete outline or just winging it from one episode to the next (I think I know the answer). Too bad the writers and producers could not have had more time for a proper wrap up.  I give it a B+ (four stars) and recommend  it.",1415145600,,2164,4.776881720430108
4643861,5,B005BO5MWG,"I loved Everwood when it first aired, and this was a great return to the past!  So glad they eventually created all 4 seasons on DVD!",1414022400,,133,4.115384615384615

4643865,5,B005BO5MWG,My grandson actually turned us on to this series.  We rented it from Netflix first and liked it so much that we decided to purchase the series.  Great family entertainment.,1403654400,,172,4.7
4643866,5,B005BO5MWG,I love this series...they never should have ended it so soon. I love all the characters and the fact it deals with real issues in very tasteful ways. I never felt like it was R rated. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a great story line that is well written and set in a quaint  little town in Colorado. I lived in Estes Park and Colorado Springs so Everwood is very real to me.,1402444800,3,387,4.092105263157895
4643867,5,B005BO5MWG,Everwood is a fantastic show! It had great characters and they were castes well. They don't make shows like this anymore.,1388707200,,121,4.809523809523809
4643868,5,B005BO5MWG,"I've loved Everwood since it was on air some time ago. Now, I've missed this show so much, so I decided to purchase it. It was a great deal, delivered fast and making me feel all that love and tenderness in my heart I used to feel when I watched it for the first time. I would recommend this show to all families in the world, for its lessons of love, good communication and quality time to spend with our loved ones. Now I've got the whole show, I love it even more because my 2 year old, who wasn't born by the time the show was on air, enjoys watching it with me; he enjoys specially the music that plays when episodes begin... This makes my heart feel warm and happy and makes me wish to live in Everwood...",1377648000,,711,4.085714285714285
