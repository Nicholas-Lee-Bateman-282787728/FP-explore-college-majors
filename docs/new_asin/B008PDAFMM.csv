8529507,5,B008PDAFMM,"This is a series that I stumbled upon on YouTube and have really found them to be both interesting and educational.  Each episode runs about 45 minutes so they are well worth the money if you have any interest in ships, especially ships that have very specialized duties.  I'd recommend this series to anyone.",1375056000,,309,4.703703703703703
