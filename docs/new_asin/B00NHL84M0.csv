8678275,2,B00NHL84M0,"I'd heard great things about Pizza, so had been trying to see it for awhile.  What I didn't realize is there are two ""versions"" of the film - one in Tamil, from 2012, and a remake in Hindi (both films made in India), released in 2014 - so when I sat down to watch this one, it was without knowing it was the remake.  The premise is awesome: hardworking pizza delivery man Kunal (the handsome, likable Akshay Oberoi), recently learning his wife (a horror writer) is pregnant, is trying to do well by his job so he can get promoted.  He dislikes what his wife does for a living, thinking it nonsense, but she tells him everybody has a horrific tale in their life to tell - which Kunal learns when he makes a delivery to the home of a woman who promptly disappears, leaving him trapped in the house ... not exactly alone.  Sadly, Pizza was just ""okay""; it doesn't really play fair with the viewer, and the time Kunal's trapped in the house actually drags, with few real scares.  The touches of humor are welcomed, but even the ""twist"" that ends the film wasn't, sadly, all that inspired.  (from sixtysecondcinema.blogspot.com)",1425859200,,1123,4.534653465346534
