8640025,1,B00I972WAC,"The video we received is not only of absolutely horrible, less than even SD quality, the main portion of the video was a greatly cropped image that only showed a small center portion of the original image.  The price before shipping was $8.99 so even though not a ton of money, I am greatly disappointed with my purchase and feel I was totally ripped off.  And the seller knew it.",1482019200,,380,4.414285714285715

8640028,2,B00I972WAC,I bought this based on the name and picture..... It isn't a music CD.... It's video DVD of an unauthorized biography of Taylor Swift.  I haven't even stuck it in my player yet... Thinking I'll return it.,1399334400,8,203,4.486486486486487
