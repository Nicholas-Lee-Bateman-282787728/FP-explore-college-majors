A millionaire sets her up in an apartment with clothes, an allowance, and a chauffeur. She rebuffs what she thinks is an immoral proposition, but his intention is for her to lure away his wifes lover. She is also romantically pursued by a Paris taxi driver. This is a romantic comedy gem! Its easy to smile your way through the entire film. Colbert is at her absolute best here. Shes beautiful, funny, witty, and delightful. The cast works so well together, and the story is engaging and highly entertaining.  Dont miss this. Its must see viewing.",1491523200,,660,4.7894736842105265
