3689229,5,B001LPWGGE,"This thing delivers again and again, covering the brightest and the darkest moments alike from the long, wonderful history of the Boston Bruins.  There are no lulls to speak of, it's a constant stream of remarkable stories and invaluable archival footage.  Eddie Shore might be the hardest man who ever lived and Milt Schmidt's story about taking out Rocket Richard is just hilarious.  You get interviews with Bobby Orr, Cam Neely, Ray Bourque, Phil Esposito and even interjections and reflections from the new blood of the Bruins - Tim Thomas, Zdeno Chara and Milan Lucic.  This is the entire story of my team (and if you're on this page reading reviews, it's probably yours, too) and I couldn't be happier with this buy and enthusiastically recommend it.",1255478400,,756,4.929133858267717

3689231,5,B001LPWGGE,"This is a fantastic synopsis of the history of the Boston Bruins, from it's inception as the first American Hockey team all the way to present day. Watching the Big Bad Bruins of the '70's brought back a lot of memories for me growing up in Maine and listening to the B's on the radio or watching on WSBK TV w/ Fred Pierson doing the play by play. I highly recommend this DVD set for anyone who has a true passion for the Bruins or any Original Six hockey team.",1247529600,,461,4.133333333333334

3689233,5,B001LPWGGE,"Highly recommended, not only for Bruins-fans.
Hope there will be a 10+ DVD-set with ""Greatest Games"" by the Bruins soon,
with a lot of (early/pre-knee injured) Bobby Orr-games (others than the 2 games available on the Flyers-10 DVD-box!!!",1242345600,,238,5.2894736842105265

3689236,5,B001LPWGGE,"This is an excellent 2 Disc comprehensive history of the Boston Bruins. Whether you are a Bruins fan or a hockey buff, this set will not disappoint. From it's early beginnings to the present, all aspects of the team are covered. It contains several photos, interviews and comments from past players to the present. The archive footage will please any Bruins fan. We get to see the progression of uniforms and equipment and how the game was played. A nostalgic look at the Boston Garden and the winning of the Stanley Cup still evokes a feeling of pride any Bruins fan can enjoy.",1240617600,,578,4.621359223300971

8319419,5,B001LPWGGE,An absolute must have for any Bruins fan...always fun to look back on the days of The Big Bad Bruins!,1307836800,,101,4.1
8319420,4,B001LPWGGE,The Bruins have possibly the most interesting history of any team and lay claim to hockey's greatest player of all time:Bobby Orr. This video is wonderful;  I felt like I was in Boston and thoroughly enjoyed it!,1297123200,,211,4.702702702702703
8319421,3,B001LPWGGE,"This is a two-disc set. The first one contains the team history. I have been a Bruins fan for many years, but was not a close follower of the team, so I took a lot from this that I did not already know. It was interesting to see the team's history chronicled from its beginning to the present day and to see old footage and the progression of their uniforms over the years. I was surprised that two significant players in team history were not mentioned. Andy Moog, one of the more popular players they had, and Joe Thornton, the high draft pick who never lived up to expectations. These are glaring ommisions. The first disc also has personal stories about the current players, showing them participate in hobbies they like. I would have liked to see more, information about their wife and kids, how they got to where they are.
  The second disc is a complete waste. It has nothing more than the ceremonies retiring the numbers of some Bruins greats and the ceremony for the final game played at the Boston Garden. I would have liked to see highlights of The Bruins greatest games, or stories focusing on their Stanley Cup runs.
  Overall the History is interesting, but does omit some significant figures. The rest of it is nothing special. A good watch for a Bruins fan, or any hockey fan, but this could have been better.",1295827200,,1325,4.531380753138075
8319422,3,B001LPWGGE,Love the Bruins and liked the movie but was hoping for more.  Good movie for a brief history of the Bruins.,1287014400,,107,4.095238095238095
8319423,2,B001LPWGGE,"..Much awaited Bruins History has Dramatic presentation & proper serious tone, but lacks some basic & critical information on key players & Stars, particularly stalwarts of the Late 1950s such as Fleming Mackell, Harry Lumley, Leo Boivin, Larry Regan, Doug Mohns & Don McKenney!! These and several other Bruins from other eras are barely mentioned or completely omitted from the narrative, thus  emerges a very incomplete portrait that is both inexcusable and an insult to the proud franchise that is the Boston Bruins...The vaunted UKE Line & pioneer Black player Willie O`Ree are well featured, but the aforementioned lapses make for an incomplete picture..One can only hope for a revised edition...The Boston Bruins story deserves better!",1286928000,,741,5.387931034482759
8319424,5,B001LPWGGE,This brought back a lot of great memories and is a must for all Bruins fans.,1265414400,,76,3.8125
