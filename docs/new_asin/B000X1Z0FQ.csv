8226568,1,B000X1Z0FQ,"I encountered this film on Netflix. I noticed that there were many bad reviews written about it. Curiosity got the best of me thinking it can't be that bad.  It is that bad! It is the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting is horrible. The subtitles are difficult to read. In fact if Mystery Science Theater 3000 used this film, its poor robots would short circuit and fizzle out in horror.

Do not waste your time nor money on this movie. It is worth while, however to go to its page on Netflix to laugh at the bad reviews. They are more amusing than this cinematic stinker.",1390262400,,577,4.284403669724771
8226569,2,B000X1Z0FQ,"This cute Cantonese film is a spin-off of America's ""American Pie"".  I am sure it was a hit overseas, but I'm not sure it would be a hit to others.  It had its moments...and the love between young teens is always fun to watch.  It's worth a view (rental) but I won't be keeping this in my library.  I have to admit I fast-forwarded on occasion.  This is not for the kiddies either.  There is some nudity and simulated sex, but it is done ""tongue-in-cheek"" to silly music.  No profanity though...none at all.  And remember, the language is Cantonese with English subtitles.",1268092800,3,572,4.53921568627451
