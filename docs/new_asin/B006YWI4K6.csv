The second time I saw it, I realized how great it is. I hope that Joe puts out more of his DVD concerts. Sound quality and video is amazing but not widescreen.",1359676800,3,329,3.925373134328358
5037702,5,B006YWI4K6,"and great Joe. This is a great era, pretty much when i started listening to him. This DVD is a must have for all Joe fans.",1357603200,3,122,3.730769230769231
5037703,5,B006YWI4K6,"Hey Amazon, can I give this 10 stars? PLEAAAAAASE? I just loved this. 3 complete show from the great German TV show Rockpalast. 2 are about 50 minutes long, the other is an hour and 55 minutes. The energy never stops.

If you enjoy Joe's music, get this.",1336348800,16,254,4.291666666666667

8506657,4,B006YWI4K6,"This brought back memories of the first time we saw Joe. I had forgotten that in the early shows he mainly sang and fronted the group, rather than play. Video is a bit rough, but the sound is good.",1474848000,,197,4.076923076923077
8506658,5,B006YWI4K6,"Joe at his best, playing his best material. The evolution from DVD 1 to DVD 2 is dramatic once he adds percussion and other keyboards!",1454457600,,134,4.4
8506659,5,B006YWI4K6,Very good shows. I love Joe Jackson madly. Arrived in time in good condition.,1416182400,,77,4.571428571428571
8506660,5,B006YWI4K6,Always see joe when he comes around. Always something different and always great.,1415491200,,81,5.3076923076923075
8506661,5,B006YWI4K6,"Just like I remember seeing ole' Joe, true pioneers of newpunkwave. Great playing + great songs = great DVD!",1408320000,,108,4.7368421052631575
8506662,1,B006YWI4K6,"This dvd was poorly done by way of audio. The audio was off on the 1st two  concerts on the disk and was on on the last concert. If you're like me , the voice and instruments have to be in sync with the video. Don,t they watch the videos that they sell to see if they are at least in sync.",1404086400,,289,3.661290322580645
8506663,5,B006YWI4K6,"Very good concert DVD of a few good shows. Only negative thing would be the two a Capella versions of ""Is She Really Going Out With Him"" I prefer the standard version of that song.  Which ere is one regular version thankfully.  I'm nitpicking.  Great DVDs. Definately worth the price.",1395878400,,284,4.64
8506664,4,B006YWI4K6,Got this for my dads birthday. He was very excited to put in his DVD player. Thank you so much,1361145600,3,94,3.75
8506665,4,B006YWI4K6,"3 complete concerts from Joe's early days! A certain amount of redundancy in the songs of course but a definite difference of flavor between the 1st & 2nd shows. You can see his show become more polished. The 2nd & 3rd shows are fairly similar as they're only a few weeks apart. Video & audio are of fair quality, good for the time but behind today's standards of course. Still, for Joe's fans this is money well spent",1359849600,2,418,4.371794871794871
