6243961,5,B00HZ7S508,"This story is inspired by a 1970s episode of the Superfriends where Lex Luthor and the Legion of Doom go back in time to stop Superman, Wonder Woman and the Green Lantern from becoming the heroes they were destined to become. This movie is a retelling of that story put into more modern times and involving young heroes from the future to help stop Lex and the Legion of Doom from preventing the Kents from adopting and raising baby Clark. It does not follow any recent storyline from the Justice League. It has the feel of the Superfriends with Superman being the leader of the group of heroes giving the orders to the others in the league as he did in the 70s. In this story Lex and others from the Legion of Doom go back in time along with some of the Justice League to help stop this from happening. The young future heroes help save the day. Don't surprised to see some cameos from characters only seen in the original Superfriends show. It's a story you can safely watch with young children. If you are old enough to remember the Superfriends you will probably enjoy this fun little story. It is just an hour of retro fun and I recommend it for anyone who enjoys the DC Superheroes.",1390435200,72,1188,4.404545454545454
6243962,3,B00HZ7S508,I love comic books - I am familiar with nearly every DC and Marvel origin stories and characters. This DVD was well packaged and came on time but the story itself was lacking that special something that makes a Justice League gathering interesting. The time travel and then the future ramifications *no spoilers here* I just didn't dig it. I ended up re-gifting to a family member that is gaga over DC Comics and Superman.,1485388800,,422,4.64

6243970,3,B00HZ7S508,"This is an okay Justice League film. It really doesn't compare to the animated series, either in style or substance. Its kind of a nostalgic remake of the old ""Challenge of the Superfriends"". Green Lantern doesn't make an appearance even though he was in the original Challenge series - and the episode in particular where they change the past of 3 superfriends which this film is paying some homage to. The original Challenge episode is hilarious when Luther changes Green Lantern's future, ""Hal Jordan, get out of there"", then Luther gets in and is whisked away to receive the Green Lantern and ring, then calls himself ""The Green Luthor"". The young heroes from the future in this fillm are not to great. ""Karate Kid"" seems like a young version of the Superfriends ""Samurai"" character. Don't get me wrong, this isn't bad, its just not to the quality of most of your Justice League series or films.",1466812800,3,899,4.769230769230769

The ONLY thing I wish they had done differently was having more members of the Legion in it.  I will say though that their take on Dawnstar was unique.  I don't remember anywhere in the comics her having the light based powers she exhibited in this film.  Other than that it was wonderful.,1442880000,,375,4.3

However this movie is for fans of the classic D.C.Universe, with a nod to the Superfriends cartoon of the past.

6244024,4,B00HZ7S508,"Just finished watching ""JLA Adventures - Trapped In TIme"" released by Warner Brothers.
""JLA Adventures - Trapped In Time"" is a fond love letter to the old Super Friends cartoon series of the late 1970s and early 1980s. It's really an update of an old story line in the original series where Lex Luthor goes back in time to stop John and Martha Kent from discovering the rocker that brought the infant Kal-el to Earth.
Dawnstar and Karate Kid are potential new members of the Legion of Super Heroes in the 30th Century, when the foolishness of Karate Kid unleashes the Time Trapper and Lex Luthor from their prisons and back into the 20th Century.
Look for a delighful cameo of Wendy, Marvin, and Wonder Dog. This movie I believe takes place before the arrival of Jan and Zan - the Wonder Twins..
The action centers around Dawnstar and Karate Kid coming to terms with their mistakes and trying to correct them.
Spoiler Alert - The ending does leave room for a sequel or a series spin off.

It is as though it were written by a 12 year old, and not a smart one. The plot makes no sense at all. I seriously believe this was thrown together just to make some extra money from the franchise.

6244027,2,B00HZ7S508,"A rare miss for DC animated films. One can tell that this film is directed towards a younger audience. There is very little back story to a great many elements of the film, the Justice League members themselves only play what seems like a small part and it is entirely too short at 53 minutes long. Its one redeeming factor is that it could entertain small children. If you're use to the more adult themes of other DC animated films, stay far awat from this movie.",1422144000,,464,4.406976744186046

The new characters had some cool powers, the means of traveling through time is a little darker than it needed to be.  It's not the best DC movie, but at least it's not the worst by far.  The bonus superfriends episodes are not bad extras.  I guess it's worth the five bucks I paid for it at walmart's black friday sale.",1421539200,,496,4.326086956521739

6244034,3,B00HZ7S508,"A fun kids movie that older fans might appreciate for its homage to classic DC cartoons.

THE GOOD: Fun, lighthearted tone which is missing from a lot of other DC properties these days. Good voice acting, colorful, neat costume designs and models for the characters. It's not quite Batman Brave and the Bold (in spite of having Diedrich Bader, which is a plus!), but it's way better than old school Super Friends.

THE BAD: Don't go into this expecting the same quality of animation as other direct to video DC movies. This one clearly had a smaller budget. It also has a much shorter running time than other films, though if you just want to watch it with your kids, that's not really a big deal.

THE UGLY: Put your Saturday morning cartoon hat on for this one for sure! It's fun, but don't think too hard about the implications of the time travel based plot.",1419292800,2,861,4.506410256410256

While some familiar voices are on board and some of the animation is good. There are far to many things about this animated adventure that put's it in the ""B"" category. And that many be being to kind. Accept for certain aspects, it is a ""C"" category. To much of the dialogue sounds 70ish, just now well written. And even the story which had such potential, was badly executed. While the young children will enjoy it, older teens and adults who have been exposed to the quality of the Young Justice TV series and the Animated movies like ""Justice League-Doom"" will fine it very hard indeed to sit still and watch this one all the way through.

It's definitely not for adults.  I think they are aiming at young children with this movie, but I wouldn't let my kids watch it because it's so illogical in so many places that I don't want kids to try and learn anything from it.

The whole story could of easily been told in 20 min. and by the 40 min mark I just got bored of the movie. Don't get me wrong I like the old Super Friends cartoons but because of more of how lame and cheesy it is. It doesn't take itself to serious at all, and just had fun with what it is. This is not that. This movie tries way to hard to be serious and dark while not being all that compelling or interesting of a story. The characters have no depth at all and are paper thin, in which just makes you not care what happens at all and get bored with what being shown on screen. The Justice League honestly has no reason to be in this movie at all, and that is it's biggest problem. This feels like a movie where The Justice League were just kind of thrown in at the last min as they really have nothing to add to the story or plot.

Overall this movie was a bit of a disappointment, I didn't hate it but it was rather dull and uninteresting.",1418428800,,1076,4.0754716981132075

4 I wanted to emphasize how pleasantly surprised I was by it. I went into it with low expectations, thinking the animation
would be dated and the story-line for kids. I couldn't have been more wrong. The artwork and animation were excellent --
they re-imagined a lot of our favorite Justice League heroes and villains, some slightly (like Superman, Wonder Woman and the Flash)
while others more drastically (like Cheetah and Toyman), but all were done in aesthetically pleasing way. The storyline wasn't exactly overly original, but it was still very engaging, and I loved the interaction between the various characters, both heroes and villains. The voice acting was top notch -- one really delightful addition was Dante Brasco of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" fame, who voiced the unforgettable Zuko in that series. The only thing I didn't care for was the introduction of two new characters, Karate Kid and Dawnstar, both of whom were about as interesting as curdled milk. Thankfully, they play only a supplementary role in the film, and are not permanently inducted into the League at film's end (yay!)

It starts off very similar to the old SuperFriends cartoon, with the JLA facing off with the Legion of Doom, complete with the same roster as the old cartoon. They sound off their names for those young viewers who don't know who they are already. But the real plot starts when Lex Luthor travels back in time from the 30th Century to destroy the JLA, and two wouldbe members of the Legion of Super Heroes, Dawnstar and Karate Kid, must stop him.

Honestly, I'm love that they used the Time Trapper character, and they really surprised me that they didn't take the simple way out with the plot. There's also strong hints that this is maybe a pilot for a series further down the line, or at least a sequel. I would love that. I really liked Dawnstar and Karate Kid.

If there's one thing people will dislike is the voice actors. None of the famous VAs return for this movie, and their stand-ins are nothing special. Then there's the character design. I'm forgiving with a lot of things, but I didn't like Superman's character design - he should have a square jaw, it's practically tradition. Robin the Boy Wonder's design and character is a misstep, in my opinion, the kid needs a haircut and an attitude adjustment. I liked Wonder Woman in this WAY better than her representation in the most recent JLA War, though.

Overall, I'd call this movie's tone one step above the old Teen Titan's cartoon, but still below the old Justice League cartoon. If you are one of those fans that likes action adventure without getting caught up in thing being super-serious, then definitely give this a watch. If you like the JLA to be super-serious all the time, then stick with the PG13 stuff.

6244113,3,B00HZ7S508,"Allow me to begin this review by clearing the air on one important issue of note- there are a lot of critiques littering cyberspace faulting this film of falling short of the precedent set by the DCU and specifically when compared to the Justice League animated features that have preceded it.  To such complaints I do remind that nowhere is this feature even titled Justice League but rather the JLA Adventures (JLA of course representing Justice League of America).  This is important simply because Warner and the individuals responsible for this piece are making sure to differentiate the film (and those intended to follow it) as entirely separate off-shoots of the Justice League fans of come to know and love.

So what then are the JLA Adventures specifically?  The short answer is what would happen if you modernized the universe, characters, plots and animation of the 70s/80s Hana-Barbara series Superfriends.  In fact this film is loosely based upon a 1978 episode titled ""The Secret Origins of the Superfriends"".

The plot, summarized as concisely as possible without giving away any spoilers, works off the idea that if Lex Luthor and his fellow Legion of Doom members were to go back in time to intercept the unanticipated arrival of young Kryptonian Kal-El before his being adopted by Martha and Jonathan Kent, there would be no Superman and thus no Justice League to stand in their way.  Never mind such plot holes as if such mastery over time truly existed, there would be a near-infinite number of more effective means of achieving world domination; do keep in mind this is all based upon screenplay work for children's Saturday morning television in the mid 1970s.  Then it becomes clear to simply be grateful that the powers that be decided to omit the Wondertwins and Gleek from this film.

Beginning with the look of the piece, it's safe to say that the Superfriends have never been presented in finer detail.  Truly the colors, animation and fight sequences are all top notch.  Nearly equal to contemporary Justice League feature films from the DCU and easily on par with the JL series efforts of the early to mid 2000s.

The casting and vocal work is solid as well, if a tier or two below what we've come to expect from the DCU and the DCAU before that.  Peter Jessop performs the voice of Superman and manages to capture some of the authority and good nature of the character (albeit not nearly as effortlessly as say Tim Daly) and Dietrich Bader reprises his Brave and the Bold role as the Caped Crusader (again, passable but vastly inferior to the spoiling Kevin Conroy has provided us throughout the years).

The remainder of the League (exception, Robin) do adequate work considering what they are given; Wonder Woman, for example, has nary a complete paragraph of dialog throughout.  Surprisingly, Kevin Michael Richardson, veteran Lex Luthor actor in the DCAU after Clancy Brown, is on cast but used to voice Solomon Grundy and Black Manta while Fred Tatasciore voices a fairly lackluster Lex.

Superfriends fans will delight at the use of such long standing cues as the Legion of Doom's Darth Vader head spaceship/ base of operations and even the title sequence, which borrows from the Season 3 opening.  The cast is pretty spot-on for what plot-points exist here as well, with notable absentees coming in the form of Green Lantern and Hawkman.

Pacing, as can be expected for a film that completes in under an hour, is remarkably brisk and leaves very little time for such nuances as character development or in-depth back story (though in all fairness, it absolutely puts to shame the total development Superfriends managed to accomplish in its entire 13-year run).

Special features here are limited to a bunch of WB trailers and two Superfriends episodes: The Mysterious Time Creatures (season 2) and Elevator to Nowhere (season 5).  While both of these episodes were surely selected on account of the fact that they deal with time travel in some capacity, the episode most closely resembling the plot of Trapped in Time (season 3's Secret Origins of the Superfriends) is absent.

All in all, it makes sense that as the DCU has raised the bar in their previous releases to such a level that anything shy of sheer storytelling perfection comes under immediate and heavy scrutiny.  Perhaps more clearly labeling JLA Adventures: Trapped in Time with a subtitle to the effect of ""A Modern Incarnation of the Classic Superfriends"" could have saved many a potential customer some grief and backlash.  Going into the film with this ideal certainly makes the experience a lot more enjoyable.  In fact, I've discovered a technique for achieving the ultimate satisfaction with this film: watch the two included Superfriends episodes on the disc first.  Suddenly JLA's weaknesses become a whole lot less glaring!

The reason for my 3-star rating then, as I vowed not to fault it for harking back to a simpler time in both society and superhero animation, stems from the fact that the release is fairly pricey (I paid $14.99 for it upon release) for a film that isn't even quite an hour (not to mention devoid of special features/ commentaries & so on) and the fact that the ending is such where sequels are inevitable.  This film absolutely reeks of its potential as a two-episode pilot for a weekly animated series, which truly makes one wonder if that's not how it had been originally intended.",1403308800,2,5421,4.889737991266376

To this day I still watch them for fun and laughs, like choosing a day to just revist the old stuff. Like throwback thursdays or something. Anyway, the art here is beautiful and the disgn choice for every character was nicely done. I am a little shocked at the rating this movie has recieved. It's definitly one to add to the collection of DC animated movies right along side the others like red hood and justice league doomed. Now granted this is not gritty as the others but its not campy either. Fight scequences are done very well. In fact they are among the best of the collection of home videos. The story is mainly based on two young heros that time travel to the past and team up with the justice league. All though these two are the main characters in this film I didn't really get the feeling that any attention was completely taken away from the JLA. To me they still felt very relevant. The only down grade about this movie is the promotion for it. I heard literally nothing about it. The only way I found out was searching online to find out about any movies in target. In fact instore purchase for this dvd is just that, only in target. But all that aside the story ends as though there will be a sequel. If so I hope the promotion for this is better. I'll be looking forward to it if that is the case. Over all it's a very great film and worth a purchase in my opinion.",1402272000,2,1517,4.252595155709343

The story was thin at best, and the JLA were ineffective, which really bothered me because it was like watching Super Friends 2.0 and not the Justice League of the early 2000s.

6244124,4,B00HZ7S508,"I'm a huge fan of the DC Universe animated movies. There's always been one thing that bothered me about them, though. They were aimed at an older crowd and borderline inappropriate for anyone under the age of 13 for sure. I still don't understand why filmmakers can't cater to both younger and older audiences at the same time.

It's not like they're going to lose an older audience if they take away the sexual innuendos, bad language, and adult content. However, those elements will keep parents from letting younger children watch them. There's more to gain from removing the offending material than keeping it in there and alienating an entire group of potential viewers (and buyers). I wish there were more neutral DC Universe movies like ""JLA Adventures: Trapped in Time.""

Lex Luthor captures an entity named the Time Trapper who controls the Sands of Time. Superman's arch nemesis and his Legion of Doom use the mysterious being's powers to travel back in time and wipe out the very existence of the Justice League of America. Can the super powers foil Luthor's evil plans before they're erased from history and mankind is left to fend for themselves?

""JLA Adventures: Trapped in Time"" came out as an exclusive release a few months back through Target stores. It just recently was released to the mass market on DVD only. The movie is good clean fun for the whole family. Female fans will embrace Wonder Woman and identify with teen super hero Dawnstar. Boys will want to emulate Batman, Superman, the Flash, Cyborg, Aquaman, and teen marvel Karate Kid as they defend the world from the Legion of Doom and the Time Trapper.

Bonus material for ""JLA Adventures: Trapped in Time"" includes 2 bonus cartoons from the DC Comics Vault. They include ""The Mysterious Time Creatures"" from ""The All-New Super Friends Hour"" Season 2 and ""Elevator to Nowhere"" from ""Super Friends"" Season 5. It also contains trailers for ""Teen Titans Go,"" ""Beware the Batman,"" ""The Lego Movie,"" ""Tom and Jerry,"" and ""Tom and Jerry's Giant Adventure.""

""JLA Adventures: Trapped in Time"" was almost perfect in every way possible. It was a clean movie which didn't lose its potency without any of the questionable material found in the other DC Universe animated films. The animation is vibrant and technically superb. It's only 53 minutes long, which is just the right amount of time for an animated movie to pick up, establish characters quickly, and then go full-speed ahead with action up to the very end.",1401926400,2,2486,4.895486935866983
6244125,1,B00HZ7S508,"THE BAD:
DC animated was doing such an amazing job:  superman all star, batman dark knight returns, justice league war, son of batman etc...
Ever since Justice League Unlimited and Young Justice got cancelled, DC Animated has done a solid job of turning out well animated, well voice acted features based on sophisticated comic book story lines and graphic novels.
And so, i got my superhero fix.

This has terrible dialogue, poor plot points, plenty of plot holes, and i could barely go 3 lines of dialogue without rolling my eyes.
If this was indeed, based upon an old SUPERFRIENDS episode, it was a poor choice.

Next time I think about renting a DC Animated feature, i will do my research prior to renting or purchasing and make sure it is coming from a solid story source.

THE GOOD:
it's always fun to see different interpretations of costumes and character design tweaks.
animation is solid
voice acting in ok
it did not exceed in hour in length

if you were fan of the other animate features, save your dollars and skip this one.",1401840000,7,1046,4.663043478260869

6244127,1,B00HZ7S508,"If you are like me you probably just heard of this DC release and thought. HOW DID I MISS THIS???
This movie was a water downed version of the JLU. Actually, it were as though this film was created in the 70s- not the concept but the actual animation and all. The animation was bad. The physical appearances of the characters  (like the joker...wtf) were awful.
 It feels like they tried to fail.
The voices were HORRIBLE. Batman's voice in particular made me shake my head.
The entire film made me wish they had instead made one more JLU episode.  I would have bought that for 12 dollars instead of this garbage.
Literally, I turned off the TV so my nephew wouldn't finish this awful imitation movie. I put on the JL animated series instead.",1401753600,7,742,4.481481481481482
6244128,1,B00HZ7S508,"I was really disappointed with this video, particularly when you contrast it with some of the other JLA offerings, including ""Doom,"" ""The New Frontier,"" ""The Flashpoint Paradox,"" and ""Crisis on Two Earths."" Animation doesn't have to be for five-year-olds, something that the creators of the DC Universe line of television shows and videos have clearly demonstrated over the years. Sadly, this is a throwback and not a worthy addition to the canon. There are a couple of minor spoilers in the text below, so don't read further if this matters.

The movie opens with the Legion of Doom (headed by Lex Luthor, natch) threatening the earth with a bizarre plot to dramatically cool the earth, tying up more of the ocean's water in the polar regions, thereby lowering the water level and revealing more land, land which the Legion would own. And yes, it's as dumb as it sounds.

[Spoilers ahead...]

The League intervenes and in the ensuing struggle the process goes out of control and Luthor is frozen forever deep in a massive chunk of ice. Fast-forward to the time of the Legion of Super-Heroes, where Luthor's body has been found and is now on display at a museum, still locked in the ice. Visiting the museum are Dawnstar and the Karate Kid, who are applicants for the Legion but have not yet passed the test and been given full status. The Kid is frustrated, feeling like his talents are being wasted, and he lashes out at the ice, stopping just short of delivering the blow. The Kid and Dawnstar wander on, while behind them, the ice starts to crack, as the air pressure from the Kid's blow is sufficient to free Luthor.

Luthor finds another exhibit at the museum, the Time Trapper's hourglass which binds and can control the Time Trapper much like a genie in a lamp. At Luthor's command, he opens a portal into the past and Luthor returns to his own era. Dawnstar and the Karate Kid try to intervene but are stopped. Still, they manage to slip into the portal just before it closes. Back in the past, Luthor reveals that, with the Time Trapper's powers at his command, he will send the Legion of Doom back into the past to prevent the Justice League from ever forming, by preventing John and Martha Kent from adopting the baby Kal-El. [End spoilers.]

The rest of the movie consists of the battles between the two groups, with the JLA aided by the two would-be Legionnaires from the future. The plot has several twists and turns, including a new threat that arises just when they think that everything is back to normal. And then when that threat is dealt with, the movie ends on something of a cliffhanger...

So what didn't I like?
- The movie is short, at just 53 minutes.
- The plot is really sub-standard and makes very little sense.
- There is no continuity between this movie and the DC comic books. I know that's often the case with the movies and television series but it's particularly egregious in this case.
- The dialog is pretty lame.
- And the animation is easily the poorest I've seen in recent years from the DC animators.

What did I like? Honestly, nothing. I really regret purchasing this. The only way this title could be at all fun is if you're nostalgic for the Super Friends and you look on this video as an homage to that era. It really is nothing more than a couple of Super Friends episodes which, in my opinion, isn't a good thing.",1401667200,,3362,4.574750830564784

6244147,4,B00HZ7S508,"If your expectation is to see a Justice League movie of the same caliber as the TV series of the last decade or  the various DVD stand-alone movies, you'll probably be disappointed. The animation, voice acting, characterization, and plot are passable at best - good but nothing as dynamic as what we've seen from Warner Brothers in the past. The whole thing comes off as either a platform for toy products and/or as a failed pilot episode for a new cartoon series (given the way it ends).

That being said, what initially comes off as a bit disappointing has some fun and interesting moments. As others have said, the format and setup come off as a retro take on the old Superfriends series - where Superman and the others play a minimal role in the plot outside of action sequences and some background. There are hints and in-jokes about the old series; not sure if it was intended to mirror any specific Superfriends stories. Like with all the old Superfriends series, the story really centers on it's ""teen"" heroes - Karate Kid and Dawnstar. This seems silly at first, but it is done in a manner that makes them likeable. Like those old series, there's also an emphasis on a story moral/theme to emphasize things like teamwork and self-esteem. No dark-meta plots or deeper characterizations are in the running here.

Admittedly, this all seems to point to making it more ""younger child friendly"" than most of the recent DC fare. Does it make come off as one-dimensional or weak? Maybe. Go watch the additional animated Superfriends episodes (from the 1970s and 80's)  on the DVD and you might not think so. It would seem to match their simplicity pretty well.

Overall, it's a serviceable but not great little movie to watch with or for your younger kids. The quality isn't as good as some of the other DC videos, and a Justice League fan will probably be disappointed - unless you keep your expectations low.",1399680000,2,1912,4.695522388059701

The story didn't adapt a specific story, but definitely had the feel of many of the JLA/JSA crossovers w/o the JSA or going very deep into the JLA. In many of those stories members of the JLA would team up with the JSA and break up into to 2 hero teams to deal with the different parts of the villain's evil schemes. In this movie, time constraints mean they only break into 2 teams but that works very well.

6244154,5,B00HZ7S508,"I loved this movie (movella? flimella?) - It was only about an hour long. But there is also 2 full episodes of the old Super Friends cartoons on the DVD.

It was basically an episode of Challenge of the Super Friends, that didn't talk down to its audience, whether they're actually kids, or adults big kids like me that remember the old Super Friends show with fondness but find it painful to watch now, yet references to it still make us squee with nostalgic glee.

DC Animated calls it a ""stealth release"" meaning they didn't promote it big because this is pretty much a ""G"" movie and really meant to just tie in with some toy line and they want to spend their promotion budget on their PG-13 direct-to-video releases like Dark Knight Returns, Flashpoint Paradox, War, etc. I don't know, the way they left it open ended it seemed more like it could have been a new series that got aborted. I would hope that at least we get more ""JLA Adventures"" sporadically released on DVD.

Who cares if the movie isn't gritty if it's fun, and this movie packs wallops of fun! Literally, Batman may not have blood dripping from the corners of his mouth, but he's still allowed to slug with his big right fist making Captain Cold, Knocked Out Cold. No rules like in the days of Super Friends about complete nonviolence. It really seemed to be on the same level content wise and creative wise as the Justice League and Justice League Unlimited series, and those were great!

Characterization was great! Superman is Superman, Batman is Batman, Flash is Flash, etc. Robin was such an obnoxious brat it kind of made me think it was Jason Todd and not Dick Greyson, but it worked. A great departure from the Casey Kasem sub Robin that agreed with everything Batman said with only a ""Holy..."" remark. The writing by Giancarlo Volpe (of the Green Lantern Animated Series fame) is top notch. The witty repartee between Solomon Grundy and Bizarro alone makes this movie worth it.

For anyone who remembers the Challenge of the Superfriends episode where the Legion of Doom goes back in time to stop Superman, Wonder Woman, and Green Lantern from becoming super heroes, this movie is kind of a revisit of that episode, only the Legion just focuses on Superman being the cornerstone that brings the JLA together and when Lex Luthor learns Superman's origin (smartly executed, thank goodness) Luthor tries to stop him ever being raised on Earth by the Kents.

And this movie has such a Challenge of the Superfriends feel to it! From the Hall of Justice to the Hall of Doom, to the opening title sequence, and a couple of fun Super Friends cameos. The look of the Legion of Doom is very similar to CotSF, though there are some updates in character designs, characters like Toyman looked very similar to the old show, with one big difference about him. I never really cared for the character of Toyman in any of his incarnations until this DVD, he had some really great moments!  It's also the same Legion of Doom roll call from the old series minus Brainiac, Giganta, Sinestro, Scarecrow, and Riddler. The only thing that kind of disappointed me is I would have loved to see the old version of Brainiac in this whining about why he couldn't have any pants!

So, I give this DVD high recommendation, but I think you do kind of have to have that nostalgic feel for the old show I talked about or have really liked JL/JLU. So if anything I said in this post appeals to you, then you should definitely check this out!!!",1392595200,3,3489,4.58908507223114
6244155,4,B00HZ7S508,"This film did a good job of clearing away the bitter taste left by JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR.  Curious that the 'mature' WAR has a simplistic storyline, crass humor, and juvenile characterizations while this 'kiddie cartoon' has a lively plot and treats the characters as adults.

This is really just a high-end version of SUPER FRIENDS.  It doesn't match the best of DC Animation (the Justice league series or CRISIS ON TWO EARTHS) but it's fun, quick paced and at times funny.  The action scenes are well choreographed and energetic.

The voice acting was good all around. Usually I find myself missing Conroy, Daly, etc. to the point of being distracted but I thought the actors here were well suited to their roles.  Whoever played Superman had a nice, commanding George Clooney quality.  I wasn't crazy about a couple of the character designs (Cheetah, Grundy), but most of them were pretty solid.

I do wish Green Lantern had been included, and there had been more focus on the League itself rather than the two visiting characters.",1392163200,2,1032,4.857142857142857
6244156,4,B00HZ7S508,"Currently available only as an `exclusive' at Target stores, this 53 minute original film will be `officially released' on May 20, 2014. If you are a fan of the DC Universe Original Animated Films, this is one that's definitely worth adding to your collection now or in May.

Unlike the recently released JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR, rated PG-13 and aimed at older audiences, JLA ADVENTURES: TRAPPED IN TIME is aimed at young children. Yet, it features impressive action, comedic and dramatic sequences by Anne Award winning director Giancarlo Volpe (veteran director of ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars,"" ""Green Lantern: The Animated Series,"" ""Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes,"" and ""Avatar: The Last Airbender""). While Volpe's style is not as distinct as animation star Jay Oliva, he knows how handle both pace and pull off compelling action sequences, delivering an epic climax on a very low budget. The film has the look of the early DC Universe Original Animated Films.

Emmy Award-winning writer Michael Ryan, whose credits include ""Transformers: Animated,"" ""Green Lantern: The Animated Series"" and ""Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes,"" delivers a tight script that manages to deftly move between action, comedy, exposition, parody, epic sequences, and even occasional drama. There's little here to remind you that what the filmmakers are going for is a `re-boot' of the Hanna-Barbera `Super Friends' `70s series. In fact, aside from the homage in the opening titles, and one hilarious visual gag that's best left for the viewer to discover, Ryan's inventive script plays in many ways like some of Bruce Timm's ""Justice League"" episodes. Ryan even manages to introduce subtle character conflict between Batman and Robin - a seed planted to be expanded upon should this `pilot' film lead to a series or subsequent sequels.

What's truly impressive about Ryan's script is that, given the producers' and director's goals for the film, he delivered a perfectly structured screenplay, with polished dialogue that organically fits each character. He obviously studied his source material and insured that his screenplay would deliver both a story and dialogue that would entertain both kids and adults. He masters the challenge of utilizing both Aquaman and Wonder Woman in the film, with their actions and dialogue reflecting their DC `New 52' look and `sound,' while evoking how they functioned as part of the Justice League in the vintage 70's `Super Friends' cartoons.

In adapting Geoff Johns, Jim Lee and Scott Williams' first 6 issues of their run on DC Comics The New 52 ""Justice League"" into his script for the current DC Universe Original Movie JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR, screenwriter Heath Corson dropped Aquaman from the 6 issue arc and substituted the character of Shazam. He also failed to capture the characters of Superman and Wonder Woman as written by Johns, turning Superman into an annoyingly, and disturbingly, arrogant, aggressive, violent and unintelligent character. Corson's Wonder Woman comes across as an immature, rebellious tween, and given a very embarrassing scene involving her discovery of the wonders of ice cream.

While Corson had a film with a full running time of 79 minutes to nail his adaptation of Geoff John's scripts to the comic books he was adapting, he failed in very embarrassing ways. His dialogue derailed the audience's ability to connect with film's characters, at times making them laughable. Yet, with just a full 53 minute running time, in JLA ADVENTURES: TRAPPED IN TIME, Michael Ryan manages to create a story that captures DC's most classic characters in a way that is true to the past and present.

Executive Producer Sam Register made a brilliant call in getting Casting and Voice Director of Rene' Veilleux on the project. Veilleux gathered a cast of seasoned animation voice actors for the film.

Diedrich Balder returns to the role of Batman after playing him for seasons on `Batman: Brave and the Bold.' Here, he is able to up his dramatic ante when necessary while delivering Ryan's one-liners in a way fans know Batman would. Peter Jessop nails the role of Superman, having spent a career in voice-over work on projects such as ""Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes,"" ""Avatar: The Last Airbender,"" and the DCUAOM ""Green Lantern: Emerald Knights."" Jason Spisak (TV's ""The Vampire Diaries,"" ""Green Lantern: The Animated Series,"" ""Young Justice,"" ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"") gives his performance as the Flash the perfect balance of humor, one-liners, and gravitas when it calls for it.

There are a few new and outstanding performances of these classic characters to be found in the film. Fred Tatasciore, whose past work includes ""Family Guy,"" ""Young Justice,"" ""Robot Chicken,"" ""Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes,"" ""TRON: Uprising,"" ""Superman VS The Elite,"" ""Batman: Year One,"" ""Batman: The Brave and the Bold,"" ""The Cleveland Show,"" ""American Dad!,"" and ""Wolverine and the X-Men,"" delivers a Lex Luther that manages to walk the line between the maniacal, twisted Luther of DCUAOM's adult titles with the `kid friendly' tone he was presented in when Hanna-Barbera introduced the Legion of Doom in the `70s animated series.

""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" TV series veteran Jack De Sena gives a performance as Robin that rivals Cameron Bowen's of ""Young Justice"" and Loren Lester's of ""Batman: The Animated Series.""

The true breakthrough is Grey DeLisle as Wonder Woman. She ranks as one of the greatest voice actresses working today, with credits including ""Beware the Batman,"" ""Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox,"" the current Cartoon Network DC Nation ""Wonder Woman"" shorts, ""Green Lantern: The Animated Series,"" ""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Parts 1 and 2,"" ""Superman VS The Elite,"" ""Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes,"" ""Young Justice,"" ""Justice League: Doom,"" ""Batman: Year One,"" ""Batman: The Brave and the Bold"" and ""Green Lantern: Emerald Knights."" Her portrayal of Wonder Woman is simply perfect. She captures the aspects of Princess Diana of Themyscira that all actresses who take on the role of Wonder Woman must convey.

Along with its script, another of JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR's greatest flaws was its top-to-bottom miscasting. Not even the legendary Voice Director Andrea Romano could elicit an emotionally compelling performance from virtually any of the film's stars. As a result, director Jay Olivia's phenomenal visuals ground to a halt whenever one of the characters opened their mouth and spoke. Even on repeat viewings, it's a struggle to emotionally connect to the characters in JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR as, aside from occasional moments, the performances are so off, subdued, or just wrong for the characters. Hearing Grey DeLisle as Wonder Woman in JLA ADVENTURES: TRAPPED IN TIME makes one wish she had also been cast in JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR. She may not have been able to change the script, but at least her performance would have been more true to the character, as opposed to Michelle Monaghan's.

`JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR' was scored by Kevin Kliesch, one of the weakest composers on DC's roster. His score for the film was overtly synth, with a `cheap sound' and lacking the full orchestral sweep that experienced DC composers such as Christopher Drake can achieve electronically using music and choir samples. As a result, Kliesch's score gave no emotional resonance to ""WAR."" If anything, it's `90's Saturday morning sound' distracted viewers from Jay Olivia's superior animation.

Luckily, DC's new rising star composer Frederik Wiedmann was tapped to score ""JLA ADVENTURES: TRAPPED IN TIME."" Wiedmann's previous score was for Jay Oliva's DCUAOM masterpiece ""JUSTICE LEAGE: THE FLASHPOINT PARADOX."" It was a brilliant combination of rich and layered textures specifically designed for the emotional range of the film. Wiedmann delivered distinct themes for the Amazons, Aquaman's army, the Flash, and Flashpoint Batman. It had the sound of a symphonic orchestra with the intentional use of synth elements. Just as he did in ""JUSTICE LEAGUE: THE FLASHPOINT PARADOX,"" Wiedmann's epic score for ""TRAPPED IN TIME"" emotionally elevates this lower-budgeted, shorter film to a higher level of sophistication.

This is a very well made, entertaining, at times hilarious, at times dramatic, action packed Justice League film that adults can watch with their kids, and enjoy just as much as they will. Furthermore, it's good enough to stand on its own and appeal to fans of the DCUAOM line.

Make no mistake, this is no way like the adult `JUSTICE LEAGUE: A NEW FRONTIER,' `JUSTICE LEAGUE: CRISIS ON TWO EARTHS,' `JUSTICE LEAGUE: DOOM,' 'JUSTICE LEAGUE: THE FLASHPOINT PARADOX' nor the new `JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR' in terms of adult themes, violence or intensity. However, as a fond `reimagining' of the 70's `Super Friends' animated show, it succeeds beyond expectations. It shows that such a reboot can be done in a smart, visually epic, funny and action packed way. This is what happens when the priority on any project is a strong script, direction, animation, casting, performances, scoring and sound mixing. Despite being made for the young ones, ""JLA ADVENTURES: TRAPPED IN TIME"" has all this, and this is why it works for adults as well.",1392076800,4,9204,5.255956432947583

6244158,3,B00HZ7S508,"Sorry, I was expecting something with a better story then Lex Luthor trying to make it where Superman never existed. This is more like an episode of Challenge of the Superfriends, where the Legion of Doom went back in time to prevent Superman, Wonder Woman, and Green Lantern from becoming heros. The Animation is good, but the story was terrible.",1391904000,2,347,4.8
6244159,4,B00HZ7S508,"At first, I was skeptical about the ""G"" rating, which gives the impression that it's aimed more at the ""kidlets,"" which in a way it is; then I was skeptical with its premise, being a ""time travel"" adventure.

Now regarding the first concern, although this may be reasonably perceived as an animated feature targeting ""younger"" audiences (seriously, no ""pun"" was intended there, as I found out only after having viewed this movie just prior to writing this review that this DTD-original had been initially released as a ""Target"" stores exclusive, supposedly to help promote a new toy line), I can't help but come away with the feeling that the ""real"" target audience for feature is those of us awash with a heavy dose of ""nostalgia.""

This movie is essentially ""SuperFriends,"" given a bit of an ""update"" boost, making it a bit more sophisticated (you can also read ""sophisticated"" as ""mature"") without really pushing the limits of ""good taste"" too hard, as many of the ""DCAU"" PG/PG-13 rated features tend to do -- often needlessly.

Although they've amped-up the ""intensity"" considerably from what used to be ""Saturday Morning"" fare (which may cause some to question whether the ""G"" rating was truly sufficient), the dialogue in some areas and the littering of ""inside jokes"" puts this movie on a level that only us ""oldsters"" who grew up on a steady diet of ""SuperFriends"" could fully understand & appreciate. In other words, it's really going to feel more like it's ""OUR"" movie than ""theirs""... and surprisingly, that's not necessarily a bad thing or anything that'll make us feel ashamed.

On the second point, DC animated projects have used the ""time travel"" theme with the ""Justice League"" quite characters effectively before (think the ""JLU"" 2-part episode, ""The Once and Future Thing,"" for example), but again, given that this was a ""G"" rated feature, and that the time travel element would be revolving around ""The Time Trapper"" of the ""Legion of Superheroes"" title, I once again had my doubts. Surprisingly, I found that this premise had been handled quite skillfully, given the clear limitations of the story.

Yes, I've read with much interest the fact that many are upset with the exclusion of the JL characters we've come to expect over time, especially the ""Green Lantern"" and a ""Hawk-somebody,"" but in all honesty, I was having such an enjoyable time just going along with the movie that I didn't even have time to think about who was missing or who had been added... I was actually focusing more on character design than anything.

Overall, although it's a ""short"" film and they did have to rush through a few things in order to keep the story flowing, I still found it a surpising entry. With just the right doses of humor (the ""Kansas Cornfield"" romp had me busting a gut throughout, and I'm not an easy laugh), I found it an intriguing, well-balanced and nicely executed story which might have even been something that could've worked as a standard DCAU original movie if given a considerable amount of refinement and had been made a little more ""raw"" to unleash its potential. Of course, due to its runtime length, asking anything more than $12 is, I think, kind of pushing it out of the realm of serious consideration for private puchase, and maybe the marketers will rethink the $20 MSRP.

All-in-all, if you want to groom your ""younger"" audiences to appreciate and become future fans of other DCAU original features, this might prove to be a good launching pad. In fact, in watching this one with their kids, ""grown-ups"" just might themselves find this presentation impressive enough to want to explore the other ""more mature"" titles to see what the hype is really all about.",1391731200,16,3697,4.877388535031847

the makers are very concious that this is a kids movie, and that is fine. Many of the DC animated movies are for older audiances. often bloody and uber violent. I have no issue with that. but its not something kids should see. this movie is aimed at kids. so parents can buy it for their kids who like these comic book characters.

for older fans i say give it a chance.
as other have pointed out this is VERY much a Superfirends episode for today.
part of it is based off the Challenge of Superfirends episode ""Orgins of the Superfriends"". But there are other elements too. the DVD includes Superfriends episodes Elevator to Nowhere and Mysterious Time Creatures. the former is where WonderWoman and the Atom are tricked into using a time machine the latter where the evil Dictor uses time to his own ends.

For this movie the JLA face off once again with the Legion of Doom. events occur where Lex Luthor is stuck in ice (ala Cap America). in the far future Dawnstar and Karate Kid mourn that they are not part of the Legion of Superheros. (Note that team is reffered to but never seen. Luthor is freed and he gains the aid of the Time Trapper. then catastophic events unfold.
its a fun comic book animated adventure, with a few laughes and just plain fun.

so I would say while the DCU is putting out stuff for specfiic fans (which is not bad) I would say this is intended for the 'whole' family. for kids to enjoy for older parents to point out who the charters are to their young and so forth.

the open ending leaves us wanting more.",1391212800,6,1625,4.3180327868852455

This movie rekindles that Saturday morning cartoon feeling, presenting Super Friends the way I only remember it in my nostalgic mind. The plot isn't air tight, but it also isn't stupid. It just does its job in setting the stage for updated versions of colorful heroes and villains to engage in some well animated action that does not overstay its welcome.

Yes, at 52 minutes this is a tad on the short side, but it didn't feel rushed, and the animation is on par with many DC animated TV series. In fact, the tone is somewhat similar to the lighter 3rd season of Justice League Unlimited, but much more grounded than the 80's Super Friends. This is definitely aimed at a younger crowd than something like Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox, but is does not deserve to be dismissed as even adults could find something to enjoy.",1391212800,41,1192,4.87192118226601

At one point, in fact, the two characters fight each other, and it was like old times with Zuko fighting Sokka!  Another plus is that there were quite a few villains involved in this, and not just Batman villains.

6244165,3,B00HZ7S508,"In an attempt to get younger viewers into becoming interested in the idea of a full-on Justice League live-action movie, but not willing to shell out for a new TV series, DC Comics decided instead to do a short made-for-video movie done in the style of the old Challenge Of The Superfriends show. This is an video currently exclusive to Target stores, but more than likely might find its way to being a 2-episode pilot for an ongoing new animated series.

 Not acting as a continuation of any of the previous DC Universe animated movies or TV shows, we find the Justice League of America stopping the Legion of Doom from once again taking over the world, this time by over-freezing the polar icecaps. Lex Luthor though gets frozen alive in the arctic and left for dead by the League and the Legion. Cut ahead about a thousand years later to the time to a museum in the future where Legion of Super-Heroes trainees Karate Kid(no relation to Ralph Macchio)and Dawnstar come across the frozen block with Luthor in it that was found a century or so. Karate Kid accidently lets Luthor out, and Lex liberates the time-manipulating villain Time Trapper from his mystical hourglass which takes him back modern day, followed by the two Legionnaires. Kid and Dawnstar head to the Hall of Justice to tell the JLA about Luthor's plans to alter the past, but are unsuccessful in stopping the Legion of Doom from going back and making it so Superman was sent back out into space as a baby and never raised by the Kents. This means that there's no JLA either, although since Superman never came to Earth, it should mean that Luthor never lost his hair and Bizarro was never created, but it appears to be one of those ""selective"" paradoxes. The remaining Karate Kid and Dawnstar realize that they can stop Luthor from ever being alive in the future in the first place by freeing him from the ice in the present. This causes Time Trapper to erase the Luthor from the future thus restoring the timeline, even though this should mean that the two Legionnaires would be sent back to the future or having never come back to the past in the first place, but fortunately they're still around to help the restored JLA along with Superman to send the Time Trapper packing back into his hourglass. Upon returning to the future, Karate Kid and Dawnstar discover that Lex Luthor has been heralded as history's greatest hero and not Superman, so they decide to return back to the past to help the JLA.

This 53-minute long movie ends on an obvious ""to be continued..."" type of conclusion, which means that DC really has something more in mind for this particular animation line. Possibly a continuation as a new TV series on DC Nation since they only have one show on there at this time. The voice acting was fair with Deidrich Bader returning as Batman, and Jason Spisak upgrading from Kid Flash in Young Justice to here as The Flash. The JLA lineup once actually has Robin in it which has never happened in any other version of the League(Superfriends not withstanding), plus none of the Green Lanterns were present meaning there was probably a licensing issue involved. It worth picking up at Target or online at Amazon, although you might want to wait and see if this is going to blossom into a full ongoing series",1391126400,10,3289,4.6284246575342465
6244166,1,B00HZ7S508,"This movie is pretty much a created scam with dc characters and target. Target wants people to buy the new lineup of DC characters and needed a movie to portray the ""new"" characters they are trying to force down peoples throats. This movie is so bad and filled with complete contradictions that I couldn't help but laugh through most of the movie. Most of the main members of the Justice League had little to no impact on the actual story, and when they did, it was as if they were ""new to the job"". DC has made many masterpieces of animated movies that have been praised by all audiences, however there will always be imperfections in a lineup, and this one is definitely a pass on that lineup.",1391040000,6,695,4.4375
6244167,5,B00HZ7S508,Story was pretty good. I found it to be pretty enjoyable lots of action. Story moves along well. A  good buy  for those dc fans waiting for the next dc animated movie. Can't wait till  justice league doom comes out.,1390780800,2,215,4.325
6244168,2,B00HZ7S508,"I bought this on impulse when I saw it because it was available for under $10.  According to the sticker on the box, the DVD is initially only available at Target.  I should have realized that the fact I'd never heard of it was a bad sign.

The story involves time travel, with Lex Luthor waking up in the far future and then traveling back to the present day with the knowledge and time travel device that he needs to get rid of Superman.  Two young heroes from the future, Karate Kid and Dawnstar of the Legion of Super Heroes, follow Lex into the past and try to help the JLA to thwart Luthor and his Legion of Doom.

Overall the writing is weak in terms of both story and dialogue.  The writer's rules about time travel and paradox come and go at the convenience of the plot, which itself is poorly thought out.  The characterization of the JLA is pretty flat and the team basically just take orders from Superman and occasionally spits out one-liners.  As for Dawnstar, the writer's attempt to give her a unique voice results in dialogue that tries so hard to be awkwardly formal that it ends up being grammatically incorrect.

The central characters of the story are the kids from the future, not the JLA.  Wonder Woman, Cyborg, and Aquaman barely do or say anything and even Batman seems like a passive B-lister next to Karate Kid and Dawnstar.

The overall production value of this project seems lower than what I've come to expect of the DC movies.  The Young Justice series has much higher quality design and animation.

So if you're the kind of fan who loves anything with the Justice League in it, give this a whirl.  If you're someone who loves the strong characterization, complex stories, and great animation/design of Young Justice and the other JLA features, then I'd recommend you skip this one.",1390694400,13,1813,4.572755417956657
6244169,1,B00HZ7S508,"This ""movie"" is only 53 mins. long, and some of the DC Comics costumes are wrong, and they only had six of the JLI and no Green Lantern, no Black Canary, no Hawkwoman, no Green Arrow, no Atom, and no J'onn J'onzz! this is a sorry and pathetic attempt from Dan DiDio's DCnU regime to shove that ""New 52"" pap down the throats of the more traditional, old-school fans! a DVD trash! >:(",1390694400,7,382,4.2465753424657535
6244170,4,B00HZ7S508,"Big fan of the DC Justice League animations. I own every single DC animated movie, as well as all the JL seasons, all on Blu Ray. This movie came out of nowhere. Never even heard about it until I went to Target today and saw it in the new releases. It's a Target exclusive and for a limited time (supposedly). Retails for $14.99 (got it on sale for $12.99).

My Personal Pros:
- Animation is about avg and not as good as the recent movies. Could be worse I guess
- Story is about time travel hence the title which I was pretty happy with.
- Pretty big cast of the more well known DC characters.
- Karate Kid and Dawnstar from the Legion of Super Heroes make an appearance in their 1st movie along side of the Justice League. Was afraid I wouldn't like them here but was liked seeing the new faces.
- Like all or most of the DC animated movies, it also includes 2 bonus shorts. 1st one was The Mysterious Time Creatures from the All New Super Friends Hour Season 2 from 1977. About 23 min long. 2nd one was Elevator to Nowhere from Super Friends Season 5 from 1980). Only about 8 min long. Both are a welcome editions for great cheezy nostalgic fun. It's the 1st time they've included bonus shorts from this era. I actually remember seeing these episodes when I was a kid.

My Personal Cons:
- It's only 53 min long.
- Lack of special features (behind the scenes, interviews, future projects, etc).
- DVD only so no Blu Ray version.
- Worth at least a rental but you can't since it's a Target store exclusive.",1390608000,39,1508,4.269230769230769
6244171,3,B00HZ7S508,"The Good: It has a fair amount of campy humor. Half way through there is slapstick rumble for the baby Kent between the JLA and the Legion of Doom which is fairly clever. Plus there are some enjoyable cameos from the Super Friends of old.

The Bad: The casting is disappointing. The film is only a short 50 minutes in length. The animation is ""meh"" at best. I feel if you are going to make a cartoon that harkens back to the Super Friends you must have it narrated. Somewhere ""Meanwhile at the Hall of Justice!"" should be announced.

While watching, I found myself constantly thinking how much I missed the Justice League Bruce TImm TV series and that Trapped in Time (where a fun aside) was just a waste of time. Maybe if Justice League ""proper"" was still running I would be more sympathetic to this title, a good companion piece. JLA Adventures is not terrible but nor is it great. It's merely okay.",1390521600,5,901,4.454545454545454
