764880,5,6304028512,"The Vichy government in France during WW II was basically a puppet government that was collaborating with the Nazis. ""The Eye of Vichy"" gives us tremendous insight into the Vichy propaganda machine through a well put together compilation of 1940s film reels and newsreels not to mention photographs, speeches etc. The Nazi puppet, Field Marshal Petain and his government worked with the Nazis to produce pro-Nazi propaganda. It was strange [given our own knowledge of the actual history] to see Frenchmen 'volunteering' to go to Germany to work as slave labor in Germany's factories.

This alternate history that was put together by Petain's government is astounding in the large scope of its absurdity and blatant lies, but it showcases the Vichy government's attempts to manipulate French citizens and turn them against the Allies and the Jews.

A must-watch documentary for those interested in the propaganda machinery of the Vichy government during WW II, and anyone interested in the history of fascism.",1231286400,4,1008,5.254658385093168
764881,5,6304028512,"This is an infinitely watchable, very well done documentary about the mystery that was Vichy France. It's a perfect companion to Ophul's The Sorrow and the Pity. There really is not a central narrative here as they let the films speak for themselves. They really do tell one just about everything they need to know about the weird mix of fascism and bureaucracy that was Vichy. Occasionally, the director provides a little voiceover clarification but basically the propagandistic era reveals itself to viewers slowly. Overall, there is some absolutely outstanding stuff here and it is valuable primary source material. I just read a biography of Petain but I have to say I never realized how depressed and despondent his speeches were from that the era. It is funny to see what sort of thing passed for political inspiration back in those days because Petain basically spent most of his time putting down his fellow citizens in these clips.",1185321600,5,940,4.955696202531645
764882,5,6304028512,This is the kind of documentary I like... it lets you see the people of the time and hear in their own words their motivations and justifications. There are so few books and movies on the Vichy regime that this one stands out even more.,1167955200,,236,4.266666666666667
764883,4,6304028512,"This film is a collection of short clips (taken from newsreels, propaganda films, and mainstream movies) made by/for/about the Vichy government from 1940 until the liberation of Paris in 1944.  This is a modern (1993) attempt to paint a picture of the Vichy government that they may have painted of themselves.  I found this to be a fascinating window into how the Vichy government viewed themselves.  The style of the film is, in many ways, similar to `Triumph of the Will'.  There are fiery speechs about duty, honor, hard work, basic/traditional values, sacrifice, etc.  There is clearly some effort to create a personality cult around Petain as well.  An effort was apparently made to place Petain above petty political machinations of individual parties (i.e. he was above partisan politics and only represents France's interests).  Complex issues of the day are framed very simply, with an `us-versus-them' dogma.  Many of the clips are blatant racist, anti-Semitic propaganda (i.e. during discussion of the `Jewish Question' there is video of rats coming out of a sewer).  There is also a great emphasis on the energy of the youth, how they will be the saviors of the future.  One thing I found particularly interesting about this film was the repeated line of argument taken by Petain and the other Vichy functionnaires that France will suffer less pain by siding with Germany than against, so France should work with them.  Finally, I found it interesting how, as the war progressed, the justifications of the Vichy regime to support Germany became progressively more ridiculous.

The place in history for the Vichy regime is still a hotly disputed subject several generations after the war.  This film certainly does not explore many of the moral ambiguities of the Vichy era, it paints the Vichyites simply as Nazis.  I give it four stars simply because it is a propaganda film and there is only so much to be learned from this type of film.  I am not an expert on the Vichy era, but this film left me with more questions than answers (perhaps this was the point of the film?).  The film itself is fast paced and the various clips are seamless woven together.  There is some English commentary, but most of the discussion is French with English subtitles.  Overall, a good inside into Vichy France and highly recommended for anyone interested in WWII or French History in general.  Finally, if you are looking for a good (French) film that actually explores some of the complexities of the occupation check out the film `Uranus'.",1167350400,9,2540,4.92018779342723
764884,5,6304028512,"Anyone interested in the history and development of fascist and national socialism should watch this film. It presents various aspects of the fascist ideology on class, culture, ""nation,"" and of course shows the prevasive anti-Semitism, anti-Bolshevism and racism of fascism.

 The Vichy fascists used anti-communism and anti-Semitism to play upon the fears of its middle class supporters in order to consolidate its position. It viewed its nation-selling to the Germans as a ""holy war"" against Jews, America and communism.

 Also presented in this film is the politics of the radical right-wing fascist politician Jacques Doriot, the role of the French LVF ""volunteers"" in the axis front lines against the Red Army, and the campaigns encouraging youth to ""volunteer"" to work in the Nazis munitions factories. The patriotic partisans are portrayed as traitorous ""terrorists"" against the conservative Vichy government.",1090800000,19,917,5.6231884057971016
764885,5,6304028512,"Admittedly this film is propaganda produced during an occupation by fascist Germany, but it is very educational in explaining why more Americans were probably killed by the French during WWII than were saved by them. But this film shows us what the Vichy government was producing in the way of propaganda, not what the Germans made them do.  Including the Northern Africa campaign of serious battles where Allied forces were attacked by French military loyal to Petain's Vichy government, as well as the millions of Frenchmen who assisted the Nazi war machine in their munitions factories, there is no question that the French were more the enemy of the Allies than they would ever be willing to admit today. For anyone who thinks that French diplomatic treachery is a new phenomenon in the war against Islamofascism, they should see this film. No wonder Chabrol was widely condemned in France for shining the light on this ugly chapter in French history. It is something any nation should be ashamed of. But unfortunately they have learned nothing from their ignominy as well documented by their own propagandists.  Hollywood did a great job of fooling the world into thinking that the ""Free French"" were in the majority fighting German occupation, but in fact the vast majority supported Petain and his fellow collaborators until the tide was turning in favor of the Allies. But what's new? If you are interested in this subject Robert Paxton's book ""Vichy France"" is even more of an eye opener.",1088294400,19,1497,4.960159362549801
764886,5,6304028512,"This is a great video to show in advanced or AP French classes.  It helps students better understand what life was like under Nazi occupation in France, and it affords a glimpse into everyday French life as it was in the 1940's.
The only problem I encountered with this video was that the audio track was malfunctionning - there was such an echo at times that it was impossible to understand what was being said - I had to return my copy of the video because of that.  But I was so impressed with the film that I'll reorder another copy, and hope that it was just a problem with that particular videocassette that I had.
I would recommend this film to anyone interested in French life, in WWII historical data or in Nazi occupation of France.",1021507200,9,742,4.408759124087592
7859644,4,6304028512,"Chabrol (then over 60) was involved; I haven't tried to check what part he played in this film, or what event it was for, though I'd guess 50th anniversary.

Here is Peter Ustinov in his memoirs (Dear Me, 1977): The French are deemed an extremely intelligent, or at the very least, an extremely intellectual people. In Pierre Laval they had a politician who saved millions of French lives by processes which were judged to be below the dignity of France. As a reward he was degradingly prevented from committing suicide, and was led before the firing-squad so weakened by stomach-pumps that he could barely stand. ... a romantic little mafioso like Napoleon splashed French blood liberally all over the European landscape, assured the unification of Germany by compelling German to fight German, therefore being directly responsible for Prussian sentiments of revenge, 1870, 1914 and 1939, and is worshipped as l'Empereur by a nation of republicans who consider that the gratification of panache, the lump in the warrior's throat, outweighs the millions of dashed hopes, of broken lives, of annihilated talents in the balance of national history. ... I hated the idea of striking bargains with the fascists,... I am merely saying that he and P&eacute;tain between them saved millions of lives, an error for which France could never forgive them. Ustinov's father, Klop Ustinov was a Baltic German previously in the service of the Tsar of Russia, who worked closely with British military intelligence. (Said 'Lobster', a 'left-wing', presumably Jewish, magazine; I haven't checked to see if it still exists). Ustinov sounded humane, and it's important to be reminded that Vichy saved Frenchmen, though Jews and their puppets verbally condemned them for not working for Jews.

The French part of WW2 is of course confusing: joint declaration of war, with Churchill; 1941 defeat by Germany, who made Paris their capital; bombing of French navy; Darlan's assassination; Vichy in the centre of France perhaps pro-German, sending French workers to help Germany; removal of Freemasons; P&eacute;tain; Vichy's Institute to study Jews; trains to Auschwitza British voiceover added that this was for immediate extermination; a French orator, saying Britain had lost its empire and was defeatedperhaps he heard it from Churchill. Atrocities from the resistance, or alleged resistance; the newsreel voice says twenty (or something) Frenchmen would die; on the face of it, it would be more consistent to say twenty (or something) Jews would die. Then de Gaulle leader of 'Free France' conjured up at the 'liberation'; and all the rest. The film is inevitably confusing; probably it was made ultimately as part of some Holocaust fraud. The intensity of bombing of France is underplayed; rapes in France are underplayed; Jews in the USSR are barely mentioned, though the Soviet Embassy in Paris gets a newsreel extractbars on the window, cremation facilities, peepholes. The newsreels must certainly be Jew-owned, and serious criticism removed, of course. If, as seems quite likely, Hitler and the NSDAP leaders were crypto-Jews, some explanations change. Maybe it was felt that the USSR ought to administer a lot of death on Germany, while receiving death itself, thus maximising white deaths. Could this be why Richard Sorge told Stalin where Germany intended to attack? Vichy was left to administer the French Empire, which had implications later for Vietnam and Cambodia, and north and central Africa. There was rationing, no doubt run by Jews, as in Britain. The sense of Hitler as 'Moschiach', a new birth for the France, appears in the films, as it did in Germany.

Rather easy watching, as the propaganda parts have to be simple, and the subtitles even simpler. Despite the pro-Jew production values, some truths peep through.",1513728000,,3819,5.226753670473083
7859645,5,6304028512,"My mother's family was in Germany during WWII. My father was an American soldier with th 26th Infantry Division. He was highly decorated. Of my two German uncles one survived the war and one did not. My German grandfather was in an Ulan cavalry regiment  in WW1. Unless you have lived in a police state it is very difficult to understand the population of Germany in WWII. No one in my family was a rabid Nazi.  I am well aware that what happened under Hitler was the biggest evil in history.
The French were outed in 1971 by an American, Robert  Paxton , a professor at UNC Berkeley. He wrote a book ""Vichy"" The myth of the French Resistance was broken. The French react violently even today about the fact that the French Resistance was so small, the majority of the population was complicit in the Fascist Regime.  Why are there not more films or books which tell the truth?  More Americans were killed in France by the French than by Germans.
Even seventy years later there are no significant books written about Vichy. Instead the myth is perpetuated. Our schools don't teach Vichy, I hope that others will watch this film, and educate themselves further. Instead they read one of the numerous novels about The ""Resistance"" and think they are reading history.",1512172800,,1264,4.650224215246637
7859646,5,6304028512,"This review is aimed at WW2 book & video buffs who know its timeline inside-out (1940-45). Youll get more out of this video because the makers do minimal narration and let the vichy films speak for themselves... which is a fun challenge for enthusiasts in order to gauge the regime's behavior.
Reading about the collaborators is not quite as enlightening as actually seeing these frenchmen speak to their well-heeled crowds in every way as a rabid screeching nazi would. Also the characters are fascinating themselves because you wonder what the french saw in them as worthwhile, even Petain himself is questionable. I suggest quickly taking notes & names for researching on wiki later (or during).
My fav two takeaways for me were: that idiosyncratic noise that accompanied the coded messages to the resistance. Why was that chosen? And the extent of the allied bombing upon France itself, especially Paris. Well worth your time to watch so I'm giving it 5 stars.",1509926400,,964,4.9937888198757765

Absurd material abounds on how Jews suddenly were guilty for all of France's problems, what an urgent threat Soviets were, and how England was eagerly hoping to kill babies and women.
