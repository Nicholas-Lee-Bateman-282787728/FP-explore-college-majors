That aside, I can attest to this movie being absolutely perfect for kids.  Particularly conservative households may take issue with its negative connotations on corporate capitalism.  Still, no pun intended, it will make you feel invested the whole way through.  It's got adventure, comedy, drama, & feels.",1515542400,,535,5.174418604651163

1190104,5,B0000063XU,"I have loved this movie since I was smaller, and while re-watching, it is a bit more nonsensical and humorous than I remember. It was an enjoyable film with lots of cute robot jokes and what I think is a good plot. I always enjoy Ewan McGregor's voice acting, as well. The voice acting and characters are bright and easy to get attached to.",1494806400,,340,4.328125
1190105,1,B0000063XU,"This is definitely not the retail version of the movie. Parts of the movie fast forward like someone was taping it and the controls from their system appear on the screen, not the controls I would see if I chose to fast forward. I guess what do you expect when it's offered for $4 but these rip off movies should not be allowed to be sold on here. Highly disappointed with this purchase.

1190119,4,B0000063XU,"This movie is amazing, I loved everything about it but the ending, and that is why it is not as widely loved as it could be.

1190283,3,B0000063XU,"I've always been a fan of robots.  Whether it's the adorable personality-filled machines of ""Star Wars"" and ""Short Circuit,"" the giant mecha of ""Power Rangers"" and ""Pacific Rim,"" or the intelligent giant robots of ""Transformers"" or ""The Iron Giant,"" they've somehow captured my imagination as few things could.  In many of these movies and franchises, however, the robots end up playing second fiddle to the human characters, and while exceptions exist (such as ""WALL-E""), it's rare that we get a movie from the point of view of the robot.  So a movie that's populated entirely by robots seemed like a fantastic concept -- heck, I'm sure Pixar could have done wonders with such a concept.

While ""Robots"" is a lot of fun and possesses a stellar voice cast and great attention to detail, it feels curiously weak, especially compared to Blue Sky's other notable work ""Ice Age.""  And part of that problem lays in trying too hard to appeal to both adults and kids... but more on that later.

In the world of ""Robots,"" Rodney Copperbottom is the son of a dishwasher, constructed primarily from hand-me-downs over the years but dreaming of a brighter future as an inventor.  When he travels from the bucolic Rivet Town to the bustling metropolis of Robot City, he dreams of meeting Bigweld, founder of Bigweld Industries and his childhood idol... but finds the company has been taken over by the scheming Ratchet, who eschews innovative thinking in favor of a business model that pushes conformity and success over all else.  Disheartened, Rodney falls in with a band of scrappy outmoded robots, led by the wacky Fender, and decides to make good among the common populace by repairing robots who can't afford Ratchet's fancy upgrades.  But when Rodney uncovers a nasty plot that could eliminate outmoded robots for good, it falls on him and his newfound friends to thwart Ratchet and restore Bigweld to his proper place.

Blue Sky's animation took a great leap forward from the stylized and more cartoony look of the ""Ice Age"" films, going for a bit more realism in the robot designs.  Dings and scuffs are common on the robots, giving them a more realistic, ""used"" feel, and many of them seem to have been designed after existing machinery and appliances, giving them a more retro feel.  The attention to detail is staggering, and provides a visual treat for robot buffs and anyone who appreciates good mechanical design.  In some cases, however, it feels like the animators were trying too hard to be clever, and you can tell that certain sequences were included just to show off -- the Crosstown Express sequence, for example, is a wild and wacky segment with a lot of well-thought-out design, but much like the pod-racing scene in ""The Phantom Menace"" it ends up overstaying its welcome, and goes on for a lot longer than necessary.

This movie has a huge cast of big names for its voice actors -- Ewan McGregor, Robin Williams, Drew Carey, Halle Berry, Greg Kinnear, Mel Brooks, Amanda Bynes, and Jim Broadbent are just some of the names you might recognize among the cast, with cameo roles from Paula Abdul, Ryan Seacrest, Randy Jackson, James Earl Jones, Al Roker, Paul Giamatti, and Jay Leno, and musical numbers from Tom Waits and Blue Man Group.  There's so much star power packed into this film that it threatens to collapse under its own weight at times, especially since a few of the characters feel pretty superfluous -- Halle Berry's character of Cappie, for example, could have been jettisoned entirely with little effect on the plot.  Still, it's nice to see Robin Williams able to cut loose and have fun in this film, and while not as memorable as his work as the Genie in ""Aladdin,"" it's still a lot of fun to listen to him let loose and have fun.

The film itself seems to want to follow the Pixar and Dreamworks models of appealing to both kids and adults, though at times I feel it tries too hard at this.  Some of the jokes are obviously intended to be naughty winks and nudges at the adult audiences (the ""making the baby"" segment at the beginning complete with circumcision joke, ""fixing"" a dog, an oil change subbing for the obligatory toilet joke, etc.), and there are so many of these packed into the movie that at times you wonder if the movie was deliberately trying to bait people.  And there are some downright disturbing implications to the film as well -- Ratchet's plan involves genocide of the outmoded robots, for Pete's sake, and that's not even counting his slimeball borderline-sexual-harassment of Cappie.  There are films that are able to walk the line between appealing to both adults and kids without a lot of innuendo, but ""Robots"" seems to zigzag over the line a LOT.

While not a bad film at all, and actually pretty enjoyable, ""Robots"" doesn't do as much with its concept as I would have hoped, and seems to rely on its big-name voice actors and its multiple adult jokes to carry it instead of a compelling story and interesting characters.  It's still worth a watch, and kids will probably enjoy it (though parents may want to screen it first).  Still, when it comes to robot-driven movies, I'd recommend ""WALL-E"" or ""The Iron Giant"" before this one.",1463788800,,5193,4.764771460423634

1190356,5,B0000063XU,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies.  Right up there with Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Hobbit trilogy and The Longest Day.  Why is a full-length cartoon one of my favorite movies?  This is just not a cartoon, it is full of some of the greatest animation techniques I've ever seen.  When Rodney Copperbotton (voiced by Ewan McGregor) first comes to Robot City, he is accosted by a character named Fender (voiced by Robin Williams) and they embark on a fantastic journey to Big Weld Industries.  They ride some very fantastic contraptions. The scene were Rodney knocks over the dominoes is so realistic that it borders on the unbelievable.  This movie originally came out in 2005.  I don't know how well it did in box office returns, but my 6 year-old grandson and I have watched this movie a dozen times or more and know most of the dialogue by heart.  I really enjoy this movie.

1190507,5,B0000063XU,Great Movie! I love to story of Robots. I am so glad they decided to start offering Blu-ray/DVD combo packs. It makes it easy to watch at home or in the car. I can't wait for more great animated movies to be released. This is my 4 year old daughters favorite movie and I love the story too.,1412467200,,290,4.017241379310345
1190508,3,B0000063XU,"THE FILM: While the story isn't particularly original or substantial, ROBOTS is a fun film for kids that has plenty of visual creativity. While a plot synopsis probably isn't necessary, here goes. Rodney is an aspiring robot inventor who moves to the big city to make his dreams come true, but along the way he has to deal with an evil corporate tyrant who threatens to turn old robots into scrap metal. First of all, I have to say this movie has one of the best voice casts ever assembled. Ewan McGregor plays the main character Rodney Copperbottom, and is joined by Halle Berry, Greg Kinnear, Robin Williams and Mel Brooks, to name a few. Every single actor brought their character to life vibrantly and with humor. Of course, with an animated movie you can't not discuss the visual elements. Blue Sky Studios (Ice Age and Rio) did an awesome job bringing this robot world to life. It kind of reminded me a little of steampunk, but more colorful and sanitized for children. There's also a number of stunningly creative sequences which are Rube Goldberg-esque in their complexity. The humor is also worthy of mention, because there's plenty of jokes that the kids will get, and some for the parents as well. There's even some hilarious usage of (then-current) pop music, and a couple other original songs. When it's all said and done, this movie isn't really the most original in terms of plot, but there are positive messages for kids and enough visual style to spare.

THE DISC: The film looks and sounds great, which should be expected given that this is a computer animated film that's only 10 years old. For viewers that enjoy extra material, there is a decent amount of special features to round out this Blu-ray package. First, there is a short featurette on the voice cast, where they discuss their characters and experience making the movie. Next up is a music video for a song called ""From Zero to Hero"" by Europop artist Sarah Connor (yeah, I thought of the Terminator). It wasn't a really great song, but it summed up the core message of the movie quite nicely. There's also few deleted scenes, although they weren't completely animated and one was just storyboards with voice-over. Fortunately, there is an optional commentary available for these scenes. Finally, there is a feature-length audio commentary by Blue Sky Studios.

OVERALL: This animated film isn't half-bad, and the star-studded voice cast certainly make it more enjoyable than it could have been. However, the selection of special features available in this package make it worth a purchase.",1410912000,,2571,4.854214123006834

Spoilers:
This movie gives us a good example of what a corrupt corporation might do in order to increase profits and control over their customers. It shows how advertising can make a customer feel inadequate unless they buy the newest product that the company is selling. It shows how ""old"" things can be outdated simply buy no longer offering parts which can increase the cost of keeping the old thing and then cause the customer to just buy the new thing they wouldn't have had to buy.
It also shows us how we can fix some things ourselves or help others and that we do not always have to rely on celebrities or ""heroes"" to help us.
There are some things I did not like about the movie but nothing that ruined it.
Quality actors and actresses were in this film and the plot is well thought out.",1406851200,2,969,4.418994413407821

Andrews Blu-ray Review: ROBOTS falls into much the same trap as that minor 2002 computer-generated effort. Simply put, 20th Century Fox's animated unit, Blue Sky Productions, cannot keep up with the incendiary heights of PIXAR, that is slightly paling in comparison in the story and character departments and lacking the much-needed heart that makes a passable family film great. With that said, ROBOTS is a frequently dazzling eye-opener that is worth seeing just for its visuals of a bustling, futuristic metropolis presided over by a population of mechanical beings.

The hero of the story is Rodney Copperbottom [Ewan McGregor], a talented aspiring inventor who leaves his parents [Stanley Tucci and Dianne Wiest] and small-town existence to make his dreams come true in Robot City. Once there, Rodney's hopes of meeting famed bigwig inventor Bigweld [Mel Brooks] are dashed when he discovers the company is now lorded over by the tyrannical, money-hungry Phineas T. Ratchet [Greg Kinnear]. Instructed by his dastardly, androgynous mother, Madame Gasket [Jim Broadbent], Phineas has made it his mission to sell high-priced parts to the faltering, fading low-mode bot residents. If they are not able to afford it, as is the case with the high-energy Fender [Robin Williams], sweepers are sent out to destroy them and store them in the junkyard. Not one to take such unethical behaviour lying down, Rodney teams up with Fender, Fender's kid-sis, Piper [Amanda Bynes], beautiful company exec Cappy [Halle Berry], and the rest of the low-modes to put a stop to Ratchet's plan and right the wrongs of the Bigweld company.

ROBOTS screenplay is by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel [Where the Heart Is], who cook up a fair share of ingenious comedic fodder as they put a robotic spin on the actual human world. For example, in the robots' world, going into labour means mantling the spare parts of a mechanical baby; public restrooms are divided not by male and female but by input and output symbols; and maps to the stars' homes features celebrities such as Britney Gears. Whereas 2004's mediocre Shark Tale suffered enormously by its flash-in-the-pan pop-cultural references, the ones in ROBOTS are more original and appropriate, including funny uses of Britney Spears' ""...Baby One More Time"" and Chingy's ""Right Thurrr.""

Director Chris Wedge and screenplay by Babaloo Mandel, David Lindsay-Abaire and Lowell Ganz have the humorous aspects of ROBOTS down to a fine art, especially handling the plot and the  ensemble characters. The storyline is a little muddled; zooming at 150mph when 55 mph would have been fast enough. The frenetic pace will enrapture the children in the audience and they, after all, will like anything this fast and colourful, but director Chris Wedge is always so determined to get to the next scene that he loses sight of his ragtag protagonists. They are all likable enough, but, save for the quick-witted Fender, are terminally forgettable and underdeveloped.

Halle Berry, as Rodney's sort-of love interest, Cappy, shares top-billing with Ewan McGregor for no determinable reason other than that she is a big name. Berry is barely there and her Cappy is not humanized enough to understand the character's objective. The team of low-modes are voiced by Amanda Bynes, Harland William, Drew Carey, and the invaluable Jennifer Coolidge. They are energetic enough in their performances, but stand around looking for something interesting to say that they never find. This is one case where an all-star cast in an animated picture is extraneous. The voices too often call attention to them and keep the viewer from believing in the robots as genuine characters. Only Robin Williams calls attention to himself for the right reasons, bringing a zany lovability and warmth to the indomitable Fender that only Williams could achieve.

ROBOTS is entertaining, no doubt about it, a gorgeously computer-animated family film that will win over children and has enough slyly mature humour to bring favour to grown-ups. A thrilling sequence in which Rodney and Fender ride a public transportation contraption that catapults them through the air and over cliffs is a rollercoaster ride-like highlight. Ultimately, it is on the basic screenplay level where ROBOTS suffers slightly next to the superior heights of something like Finding Nemo, Shrek 2 or The Incredibles which those are modern animated classics that transcend the rapidly evolving animation format, meticulously developed and thought out and emotionally resonant. ROBOTS is slightly creakier, slighter and more indifferent, as much in need of an oil change as its heroes. Until 20th Century Fox and Blue Sky Productions match PIXAR in the monopoly of computer animation, audiences will have to make do with ambitious but flawed productions like ROBOTS. It does not sometimes contain a whole lot to grasp onto and take away with you, but it's pleasurable, bright and inoffensive while it lasts. That's honestly not such a bad place to be at. The only thing that would make this animation film soar to greater heights, is if they had finally got round to doing a 3D Blu-ray conversion, especially with the technology available in turning a 2D animation film, into an amazing 3D Blu-ray presentation, as that would indeed be a mind blowing experience.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Cut straight from the digital source, ROBOTS looks absolutely stunning with its 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen presentation. For lack of a better term the image quality here is nearly flawless with really nothing to complain about. The colours remain vibrant, the video is crystal clear and aside from a few moments where it becomes soft the picture is very sharp. There is so much attention to detail in this robotic world that I found it a little daunting at first but it took my breath away. Compared to Ice Age, this animation film is not only designed better, but it receives a much better transfer, compared to the NTSC DVD I had in my collection, that I was glad to get rid of.
Blu-ray Audio Quality  With two English audio options we get the best of both worlds with this release. Depending what you're set up allows for and what you prefer there are 5.1 Dolby Digital and DTS tracks available here. Both sound absolutely remarkable and make some intelligent use of speaker set up although the DTS sounds a smidge better. The directional audio is great with the main sound effects and workings of the robotic world, music and dialogue pumping from all angles. The sound is ultra-crisp and cleans with no real noticeable distortion or flaws and is on par with the visual aspect of the disc.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary by Blue Sky Productions: Nine members of the Blue Sky Productions animation team offer up their insights in this technically-minded free-for-all, exploring the particulars of lighting and animation.

Special Feature: Aunt Fanny's Tour of BOOTY [2005] It is a five minute tour of the Robot City train station. It's more like a comedy reel with a lot of hilarious bits without much story behind it. Definitely watch this when you're done with the film and want some more laughs at the expense of Fender and company.

Special Feature: The Voices of Robots [2005] [7:28] A promo documentary about the all-star voice acting team. With eleven characters under the microscope there are clips of the voice actor talking about their character for each one with the exception of Diesel who doesn't have a voice of his own. Every character also has a selection of design sketches that show the progression of the design up to the final material and there is a 3D turnaround model showing the final product in motion.

Music Video [2005] [4:08] An extremely out dated-looking music video by Sarah Connors. Yeah, I've never heard of her either.

Deleted Scenes [2005] [7:56] Three short deleted scenes with optional commentary by director Chris Wedge. The first involves Tim the gate guard and shows how his conversation with Rodney really ended. This was unnecessary and was understandably cut from the end product because it breaks the illusion that Tim is a hand puppet. The rest are some more character interactions that feature incomplete animations and in some cases conceptual sketches to display the sequences.

Finally, Visually ROBOTS is absolutely stunning and the film is remarkably detailed in every sense. The NTSC DVD that was in my collection was okay, but this Blu-ray disc has an even more fantastic digital transfer, some wonderful audio quality and a slew of quality extras. My only issues with this release have to do with the animation film itself because it definitely has some slight flaws. The story may be rich with interesting characters and many funny situations but the simple fact is in this case the plot was second place next to the concept of the film. Children will enjoy it more than adults will, thanks to some very immature humour and gaudy pop culture references. Even so this is a good watch for the whole family, but will not give you the emotional connection that something like a PIXAR project would, but despite this I am really love this beautiful animation and I love all the characters, especially the mad cap and inventive Robin Williams, who has now sadly departed from us all, and the team that put this projector together, did a fine job and should be very proud of themselves and I am so lucky to add this to my Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

There are a couple scenes with the villain of the movie which can be scary for small children, but they are short and soon overcome by the ""good guys"".

The humor is acceptable and funny to even young children, while still being entertaining for adults. At about the 4th or 5th viewing it is decidedly less charming for adults, but the kids still love it. The use of Rube Goldberg devices as transportation and robots dancing the robot are creative and interesting.

And there's a lot to love. The movie holds up very well to repeat viewing. The world has an incredible amount of detail, with lots of subtleties you don't notice the first dozen times. The plot is reasonably good, the voice acting is great, and it's got a nice pick-me-up moral. Even better, it's got some humor which will appeal to the adults without corrupting the children.

The plot in a nutshell: Rodney Copperbottom grows up poor, with big dreams of becoming an inventor. Once he's grown up, he goes to the big city to meet his idol, Bigweld, the greatest robot in the world. But, Bigweld has disappeared, and his company is being run by an evil corporate executive! What will Rodney do?

So dream via this movie.  Its characters are much the same-looking, and the whole movie is first-rate in every respect, from witty script and animation, to voiceovers, to film editing, to plot.  It's really too fast and too clever for one viewing, so you'll want to buy it and watch it many times, as I will.  A++++ to everyone.

Like every animated film and sci-fi book, this one has socio-political meanings we all know, but for some reason the story never gets old.  Here, the same theme is wonderfully told.  Will cheer your day, even if you watch only five minutes.",1327190400,,836,4.664383561643835

1190783,4,B0000063XU,"The first thing that drew me to go see ""Robots"" was the teaser trailer shown on TV.  It led me to the web site where they snuck in a couple bits of the film, including -- at that time -- the longest single scene of animation work produced!  It looked terrific, and also had the added advantage of the voice of Robin Williams as one of the more neurotic robots.  Despite the simple story, which is not a bad thing, ""Robots"" manages to get you to root for our underdog who decides to right the wrongs being done by the large corporation ""upgrading"" what THEY consider to be inferior robots, including our hero's dad!
  You can't ask for more incentive than that, and so our hero Rodney sets off on his journey and finds along the way others that are willing to help him achieve his goal.  Basically a gang of misfits and mismatched robots made of what can best be described as ""leftover parts""!  I am no professor of fimdom, but this tale is one told many times before in many a different context.  Here it is presented in terrific animation, with engaging action and well written dialog.  That dialog gets spoken by Ewan McGregor, Halle Berry, Greg Kinnear, Mel Brooks, Amanda Byrnes, Jim Broadbent, Drew Carey and the aforementioned Robin Williams (""That's me all over..."").  A good deal of the reason for the success of this film must go to the screenwriting of Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandell, who keep the our robotic friends full of wit and vigor.
  This is really one of the landmark films in animation and is a treat for the whole family!  The Blu-Ray disc really shows off the level of detail that it takes create a marvelously simple tale told to perfection.  The extras on the disc are also worthwhile, especially ""Aunt Fanny's Tour of Booty"", which is an appropriate description of the robot with a considerable 'caboose'!  The DTS 5.1 sound makes this film jump at you -- especially with the sound effects of the robots just moving about and occassionally coming apart!  Hard to believe it has been over 6 years since the release of ""Robots"", but the efforts of Blue Sky have held up well, even against today's marketing of animation.  The younger kids -- and us adults in their 2nd childhood! -- will really enjoy watching this over and over.",1325203200,,2255,4.567164179104478

1190820,2,B0000063XU,"I liked this movie to begin with.  Unfortunately, once Rodney had arrived at Robot City, I soon began to lose interest.

The biggest problem with this movie is that there are far, far too many characters that crowd each other and overwhelm the plot.  Robin Williams is annoying and old - his jokes are repetitive and have been done already in other movies.  I just watched Disney's Aladdin a few weeks back, and couldn't help thinking Robin Williams' performance in robots was ""robot genie!""  Most of the other characters are very forgettable.

The animation looks good and the movie does not feel too dated.  The world was very detailed and interesting.  It felt huge and populated.

The plot itself was very simplistic and didn't really develop much beyond its basic ""you can follow your dreams whoever you are"" beginnings.  The world was nice and left me with that feeling that you could watch the movie a dozen times and always notice something fun and interesting going off in the background.  Unfortunately, I could barely get through this movie once and won't be watching it again.  The whole thing left me clock-watching and bored.

Robots was not a particularly funny movie, and I thought the humor in places was plain obnoxious-fart and ass jokes?  No thanks.  There were a couple of jokes in there that only the adults might get (most of them background stuff, that you'll only spot if you're paying attention) but for the most part, this movie didn't earn more than a ""hah"" from me.  Very disappointing.

The ending made me happy only because I was glad the movie was over.  Maybe a very young child would enjoy this movie, but anyone else should save themselves the boredom and watch something like Shrek instead.",1288656000,2,1726,4.773648648648648

1190823,4,B0000063XU,"From the beginning, the computer-animated feature film genre has been a back and forth battle between Pixar and DreamWorks and then a new contender arrived seemingly overnight to offer legitimate competition in the form of the Ice Age series (which is now a trilogy with a spin off called Rio nearly complete).  The company, of course, is Blue Sky and with distribution being handled by 20th Century Fox, the studio has had an impressive run of CG hits including the Dr. Seuss classic Horton Hears a Who.  Robots snuck into the mix back in 2005 with a cast that was impressive even for a big budget CG feature!

The story follows Rodney Copperbottom, voiced by Ewan McGregor, a small town robotic inventor with aspirations of moving beyond his quaint surroundings.

Rodney embarks on a journey to Robot City to meet his idol, the majestic inventor Bigweld, voiced by none other than Mel Brooks.

Once in the big city, Rodney discovers that things aren't at all like they seemed on television. Before long he hooks up with the Rusties, a ragtag group of street-smart outdated bots including Fender (Robin Williams), his spunky kid sister Piper (voiced by Amanda Bynes), Crank (Drew Carey), and Aunt Fanny (Jennifer Coolidge- that would be Stiffler's mom from American Pie folks).

The main cast is only further extenuated by a back up cast that includes Halle Berry, Greg Kinnear, Paul Giamatti, Jay Leno, Paula Abdul, Terry Bradshaw, Al Roker and James Earl Jones reprising his famous Darth Vader voice.

Vocal word aside, the film just plain works on many levels.  The visuals border on sensory overload at times with almost too much going on in the backgrounds.  Multiple viewings are mandatory to fully absorb all of the gags and laughs going on somewhere in the distance at all times.

The humor itself is layered enough to where adults will find themselves snickering at much of the dialog/ sociological (and sometimes light sexual) references while the kiddies will be sufficiently entertained by the sheer novelty of watching the bots' onscreen interaction.

Comparisons to Pixar's Wall-E are inevitable due to the nature of the protagonists but in all honesty, the two projects have about as much in common as Star Trek and Buck Rogers (but they're both about space right?).  Where Wall-E tells the tale of a solitary garbage-cleaning robot on earth and his unlikely journey toward repopulating the planet, Robots is a family-based coming of age comedy in an all-robot world (in fact there is no reference to humanity ever having existed here).

Perhaps the piece's greatest strength is it is one of few that I am aware of that actually demands the computer-animated medium to get its point across.  In other words, while many CG features look pretty, their stories could just as easily have been told in 2D art or even live-action.  Robots, however, is not one of them! Between mass-transit systems seemingly inspired by the board game Mouse Trap to oceanic tides of dominoes, this one could be realized no other way!

In all Robots is a fun-filled romp from start to finish with enough comedy to keep viewers of all ages paying very close attention both to the onscreen antics and the dialog exchanges (Robin Williams is a rapid fire joke machine that doesn't ease up for a second).

While it's true Pixar and DreamWorks continue to try to outdo one another with each animated effort, Blue Sky has been steadily delivering fantastic feature films that emulate nothing out there.  Robots continues this tradition with style.",1284854400,,3533,4.929173693086003

He moves to the big city, only to have his dreams crushed when he finds out his idol is no longer in control of his company and Ratchet (Greg Kinear), has taken control. Like many CGI animated movies this film deals with a new and exciting unseen world. The plot is unfortunately not as original or interesting as other computer animated adventures. It is also light on comedy, unlike it's predecessors. 'Robots' is much more childish, but still enjoyable. The characters are given sparse screen time, to the point where we do not get to know or really care about any of them. Other characters just seem boring, such as Rodney's love interest. The animation is hardly ever interesting, something that is becoming more and more difficult. It is a film where one action scene leads to the other, rather than fleshing out characters and relationships. It seems the film is scared of becoming boring itself. Only one scene really stands out and that is the exceptional domino scene, which then escalates into absurdity (which is OK for a family film). All the voice actors are well placed, fitting their characters very well, although as I mentioned before the characters don't really have much to do. Robin Williams isn't used to his full extent, with his ad lib never reaching the hilarious heights of 'Aladdin'. The films consequences are inevitable, you know where the film is headed, which may come as a relief to some younger viewers but it is predictable for the rest of us. Being a huge fan of Tom Waits it was great to hear one of his songs used to such brilliant effect. Compared to Blue Skies earlier animated 'Ice Age' this film seems like a poor sibling. It starts off promising with some very clever and funny set-ups such as the making of the baby. Overall we have a film with great potential but boils down to a regular family film that is enjoyable, but probably only worth the one watch.",1253059200,,2004,4.6798866855524075

I was impressed by the first few minutes, but when Fender and Copperbottom got to the big city and the movie had many minutes to waste on them being bounced around the town like pinballs I realized that there likely wasn't much of a story to advance, so they had to waste a lot of time doing gags.  When a flatulance joke goes on and on and on, you know you're in trouble.

And that's what took this movie from a potential classic to an also-ran in the world of 3d animated films.  All those tin men, and no heart.  Maybe they should have gone to Oz first and loaded up.

So, the look is top notch, but the story could have been significantly upgraded.  You can shine no matter what you're made of, and you can also be dull no matter how you're animated.  I wonder what Walt Disney could have done with the technology we have today.

However, I found myself wanting more of the plot and character development. There just isn't enough time devoted to introducing a character before the next action sequence begins. I'd have added another 15-20 minutes of showing the different robots interacting with each other and deepening our understanding of their motives, likes/dislikes and desires. Having said that, it stands up well to repeat viewings (my two toddler girls absolutely love it and would rate it 5 stars) because there is so much going on in each scene that you find yourself noticing things missed the first (or second, or third) time around.

1190888,4,B0000063XU,"Upon first assessment, the movie Robots may seem like just another story about living the American Dream, but it's so much more than that. The protagonist comes from a dirt poor family, whose father has to work washing dishes to make ends meet. Living off of hand-me-downs, his father has nothing to give him except for supporting him in his dream to one day become a world famous inventor. Coming from such humble beginnings, Joe Robot (Rodney) then goes to the big city, and after much hard work and old fashioned American ingenuity, reaches the top of the food chain and becomes partners with his childhood idol.
  In this everyday story are inserted several interesting conflicts of ideas that are very relevant to our modern world. There is the question of the place of corporations and how they are run. The idea of contentment with ourselves as we are vs. having to purchase a perfect body is toyed with. A rejection of Materialism is a strong theme in the film. Finally, there is the eerie parallel to historical events where the extermination of inferiors was used as an excuse for genocide.
  As a child, Rodney was raised watching Bigweld, the head of the company that mass produces all the parts and upgrades which all Robots come from, on TV telling him about the value of the individual. But when Rodney grows up and goes to meet this man, he finds a very different person heading the business now in the form of Ratchet. Ratchet is a very different type of CEO. He is not interested in the little man. His only concern is making profit. The leadership style of these two individuals leading the same company represents our own big corporations who have grown so powerful. Ratchet, blind by greed, loses sight of the fact that it's the little man that allows his business to succeed. The character of Bigweld makes the statement that you can run a business in a moral and honest way, and still make money.
  The movie also tries to teach us about inner beauty. I personally felt a pang of disgust when in the film Ratchet unveils his latest batch of upgrades newly available. In a world of mass advertising where you have sex, beautiful models, and teen pop stars like Britney spears in your face all the time, it's easier to become unhappy with the way you look, if you're not as ""pretty"". Fad diets and plastic surgeons with their liposuction, boob jobs, and butt implants take advantage of this. In Robots, these upgrades were just that; unnecessary cosmetic tinkering that prey upon the insecurities of people exposed to millions of dollars of advertising, for the purpose of bankrupting one out of their money. Ratchet was the pretty poster boy incarnation of this. The Rusties were the opposite extreme. Ratchet's mom shows what happens when you let the idea of outward beauty consume you. You become a hideous, ugly looking monster. Pappy, who sits on the board of Bigweld industries, sheds her upgrades when she is converted the Rodney's cause, yet loses none of her beauty, which is instead heightened by her acts.
  A rejection of Materialism is also a strongly prominent theme. Rodney grows up with his cousins used hand-me-downs. The rusties live off of used parts they find in the dumpsters. Rodney's father relates the story that he wishes he could have lived his dream, (which has astonishingly nothing to do with money considering the state of poverty they live in) but is to have continued to play his instrument and become a musician. When Rodney's father apologizes for not being able to have provided better for his son, Rodney replies that he gave him the best thing in the world, which was believing in him.
  The most obvious parallel in the film is Ratchets plan to eliminate the large numbers of undesirables by ending the production of parts with Hitlers' plan to exterminate non Aryans by sending them to death camps. The huge trash collection machines patrolled the streets looking for outmodes to send to the ovens, much like the Gestapo patrolled Europe searching for jews, gypsies, gays, and sympathizers of these groups to send to the camps.

1190928,3,B0000063XU,"`Robots' didn't impress me as much as I was expecting, but on the other hand it truly is an entertaining family adventure, so it has it's plusses to accompany the minuses.  It's really nothing new, as in the storyline is nothing short of generic.  We've seen this done a million times, and quite frankly we've seen it done better, but for what it's worth `Robots' offers some great humor and an interesting backdrop for it's formulistic storyline.  The world that is created for these robots is truly mind blowing and very well thought out.  Everything from the cities themselves to the concept of child birth and child rearing is incredibly ingenious and makes for interesting topic of conversation upon the closing credits.  While some of the humor may be directed at the adult audience, it's nothing that parents would ultimately find offensive and will most likely go right over the child's head (although your children may start asking about where babies come from).

The story is sweet, although, as I mentioned, very generic.  It's the same good guy wants to be something great and is stilted by the power hungry bad guy who he in the end overthrows.  We've seen this same scenario for almost every cartoon, and it surprises me that this was what they came up with on the story boards.  They had so many endless possibilities with the backdrop they had here and instead of exploring their depths and coming up with something as unique and ingenious as their robot world they stuck with the same ol' same that has grown tired.  Rodney, a young robot in a poor but loving household, dreams of one day being an inventor in the lines of Big Weld, the greatest robot in the world.  He leaves home and travels to Robot City in pursuit of his dream only to discover that Big Weld has been replaced by the money hungry Ratchet whose diabolical plans could mean the end of robots like Rodney and his family.  So, with the help of some dim-witted robots he plans his attack against Ratchet and his evil robot hordes.

The animation is brilliantly done, the world a fantastic character in itself.  The voice actors are all well cast, all except maybe one.  We all know that Robin Williams is a voice over God and should be enlisted as the comical sidekick in every cartoon ever.  He doesn't disappoint here and his character Fender delivers most of the films funniest scenes.  Jennifer Coolidge is another bonus, for her voice work on Aunt Fanny is hysterical.  Greg Kinnear was a brilliant choice to play the evil Ratchet, his voice fits it brilliantly.  The not so brilliant choice falls in the line of Halle Berry, who just comes off kind of awkward.  Ewan McGregor works fine, as does Mel Brooks and the adorable Amanda Bynes whose voice just seems suited perfectly for animated work.  Here's to hoping she does another cartoon soon.

So, in the end `Robots' is a worthwhile addition to your animated collection, and is one I most likely will buy for my daughter.  It's not one that I would readily call a masterpiece (ala `The Incredibles') but it's definitely not boring or passable.  Thanks to the brilliant work on the part of comedic genius Williams, there is much to laugh at here, and visually it's impressive.  It's sure to captivate the minds of your young ones, and thankfully it's not silly and ridiculous, at least not so much so that us parents can't tolerate it.  So, the plusses here (animation, humor and ingenious robot world) far outweigh it's minuses (that generic plot and Halle Berry) and come together to deliver an animated experience for the whole family.",1186617600,,3579,4.713826366559486

As a growing fan of animated movies, I was really looking forward to seeing this one, especially after some of the advertising shorts looked so good. While I rather enjoyed the movie, it did not ""wow"" me as others had done.

The animation is not an attempt to compete with the likes of Pixar, and the different style really works well for the movie. The detail is excellent, the characters all come off well, and the movie has a good overall texture to it. All in all, the animators crafted the movie exceptionally well.

In the humour side, there is some for the adult audience, such as when Rodney's father misses the ""delivery"" and his mum makes a comment that the fun is in ""making the baby"". Apart from once or twice, I do not recall much else along the same lines. The likes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Incredibles-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00005JN4W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Incredibles (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;has a lot more of the references to other films and so on for the adults.

Having said that, a lot of the humour is quite funny, mostly from the different characters and their ways. Robin Williams is particularly deserving of mention, as his charm and style with animations comes right on through, perhaps more than other characters.

Overall, ""Robots"" is a good film, and certainly worth having a look. I enjoyed a lot, but I am not sure I would want to sit through multiple viewings like I have with other movies of the same genre.",1177632000,5,1620,5.125

First off, this movie was MUCH better than Ice Age...either of them.  Those movies were kinda dumb, with a totally cliched storyline.

Robot had beautiful visuals, clever humor, and a cute story line.  Much like Star Wars borrowed from fantasy & folklore stories, Robots also borrowed from the past. Midnihgt Cowboy & Metroplois certainly come to mind as influences.

While the story was pretty good, the one thing i would have changed was to have the Mel Brooks character incapacitated by Greg Kinnear, not just emotionally defeated.  That way, instead of the cliched ""I'm a new man"" angle, it would be neat to have him simply saved from destruction, then lead the fight with the other Robots against the tyranny of the ""rich.""

In fact, I was expecting to watch a show along the lines of Cars or Monsters, Inc. and this one was nowhere near as good as they were. However, the being said, it IS a good little movie.

One of the things I noticed about it that makes it a bit different from other cartoonish type animation movies out right now is that this one had a lot of adult innuendo that the other movies don't have. While a younger child, of say age 3-9 or 10 might not notice it, my son was 11 when he watched it, and he got a lot of the 'adult' innuendo in the jokes. He was slow on the uptake, but on one scene, he turned around and looked at me and said, ""Oooohhhh, I GET it now!""

While I liked the movie, and so did my daughter and son, I found myself diappointed in my expectations of what this movie would be about and what it would be like. If you let go of those expectations and realize that this is NOT Monsters, Inc. or Cars, or a Bug's Life, or any of the others like this, you might be able to enjoy the movie for what it is. Otherwise, you'll probably be disappointed too.

I don't recommend the movie for little kids. The only thing about the movie that will appeal to them is the actual animation. Boys ages 10 and up might enjoy it, and teenagers seem to like it because of the innuendo. I wouldn't show this one to a younger child though. It's just not that kind of movie.",1157846400,10,1505,4.074324324324325

""Robots"" is a movie with heart, what do you expect for a movie targeted for a family audience. It also had some funny moments, and, as expected, were mostly contributed to Robin's robot character. There were also little details that achieved good laughs... Robot City wouldn't be complete without a robot doing the robot.  It can be really funny, but other times it tries a bit hard.

Despite its clean and shiny look, its stellar cast of voices and its expert animation, ""Robots"" offers little to interest the adult audience.  Set in a world made up entirely of mechanical creatures, the film tells the tale of a young robot named Rodney Copperbottom who leaves home to find fame and fortune in the Big Bad City.  Once there, he discovers that a major manufacturing company has decided to stop making affordable replacement parts for the robots of the world, instead forcing them to either pay for expensive upgrades or face annihilation in the city's infamous chop shop.  Soon, Rodney and his new assorted pals are taking on the villain and taking a stand for oppressed robots every where.

In addition to its rather trite and hackneyed storyline, the screenplay lacks the sharp humor and satirical edge of the ""Shrek"" and ""Toy Story"" movies, relying instead on a series of uninspired double entendres - and a plethora of flatulence jokes - that seem a trifle inappropriate in a film aimed mainly at young children.  The movie does have a nice Oz-like, art deco look to it, which at least gives the viewer something to watch while the story ever so slowly spins itself out.

It's a fairly entertaining light family film with some good moments and just enough comedy to hold your attention, even if much of that comedy involves Robin Williams doing jokes that seem like hold-over material from the TV show ""Mork & Mindy"". But then your kids aren't old enough to know what that show is, so they won't be aware of the recycling. What this film really did for me was make me appreciate Pixar more. Unlike the maker of Robots and other recent high-tech CGI films, Pixar starts out with a solid story idea and THEN develops the CGI and the gags to support that idea. Technology has gotten to the point where dazzling effects are easier to do and cheaper than ever and filmmakers are forgetting that audiences ultimately want to see an interesting story, not a dog-and-pony show of the latest in graphics effects with a storyline that has the complexity of a 1930's serial thrown in to hold it all together.

Actually, the jokes come so hard and fast, it's hard to keep up with all of them. The visuals aren't gorgeous, as many modern-day animated films have become, but they are interesting.

1191110,3,B0000063XU,"Robots, taking the cue from the current animation trend, is yet another 3D animated feature from Dreamworks, who also made Ice Age. And, like trends, this style of animation is starting to get old, already. Though it's possible to do anything with this type of animation (see the upcoming Final Fantasy VII Advent Children) this movie was just the same old. While the story was fun, and the voice-acting excellent, little in this movie is unique.

The story itself follows a young Robot named Rodney who has a dream of becoming a great robot inventor. Though he wants to do this for himself, he also wants to make his parents proud at the same time. Problem is, he's a spare-parts kind of robot, and can't get into the place where his dreams can be obtained, and where shiny, new-age robots dwell. He isn't deterred, and goes on a quest to find his mentor who Rodney believes can help him. Along for the ride is a cast of rusty robots, led by Fender, voiced by Robin Williams, definitely the comic relief.

The movie has a lot of funny moments in it, and a few stabs at pop-culture, but beyond that nothing in this movie needs to be seen.

Robots, is a film about friendship, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, integrity and inner strength.

Knowing the director and the producer, it is amazing to see how well this movie was put together. The plot was really suitable for children. The characters are funny, which is the whole idea of this movie. The story goes like this...

This robot named Rodney Copperbottom has grown up not as the richest family. His parts are hand-me-downs, and his father is a dishwasher working at a restaraunt. Rodney has had an inspiration for many of his childhood years until after he finishes college. His inspiration is a fat inventor called Bigweld. He invents things to make things better. The big thing that he makes is spare parts so people can fix themselves. So, for many years of his childhood, he works on an invention called wonderbot. It helps his father with the dishes because his father ""has to take work home with him,"" because he didn't have any extra time. After college, he finishes his invention, but it gets nervous under pressure. So, wonderbot messes up with the dishes at father's job. So, Rodney wants to got to Robot City, where Mr. Bigweld lives and show wonderbot to him. He ends up going and gets into a little trouble at first. He finds out that Bigweld isn't there and this guy named Rachet, has taken over. Next what happens is that he meets new friends that are broke. Then, the whole group goes to find an extra part for his friend. They find out that he is outmoded. They are no longer making spare parts. They are making upgrades that are worth a lot of money. Mr. Bigweld was about saying, ""You can make anything no matter what you are made of,"" but Rachet is all about making money. He finds out that Bigweld hasn't been there for 2 years and then he started to look for him. He ended up meeting a girl that works with Rachet named Cappy (Halle Barry). She never really liked Rachet and started to help Rodney. They found his place, and then they found out that Bigweld had just given up. They didn't know what to do afterwards. I will not give the ending.

1191139,5,B0000063XU,"I'm sure glad I rented Robots. I almost didn't after reading some reviews here that downgraded it and rated it lower than Ice Age, which I didn't find so great and which my 5 year old didn't like much at all. Aside from the fact that it's obviously got parts that are too dark and scary to make it apt for young children, I'm not really sure what those people found so fantastic about Ice Age. Other than the running slapstick gag of the squirrel chasing the acorn, the story itself is a somewhat hackneyed ""good calms the heart of a savage beast"" fantasy, scripted as a typical buddy-film with lots of adult-level comic banter between the motormouth wise-guy character and the serious, close-mouthed grump. From that standpoint, it's just a poor take-off on Donkey and Shrek.

But where Ice Age really fell down for me was in its animation. It hardly rises to the level of standouts like ""A Bugs Life"" or ""Toy Story Two"", let alone ""The Lion King"" from which it seems to have borrowed its idea of evil felines. In fact, the artistic rendering of the menacing sabertooth cats is quite static, boxy, unrealistic and ugly, with none of the visual subtleties of a character like Scar in the original Lion King. Then too, the truth is there's not much you can do visually with an endless landscape of snow, ice and fog and a white on white color scheme. Beyond that, the plot basically plods (literally, since the mammoth walks at that pace) through the snow to save the baby, who somehow survives sub-freezing temps totally unclothed and without food or water (right!), until the climactic fight which, as in the Lion King, my son found dark, scary and unpleasant, with not enough fun parts to offset it.

In contrast there's Robots, which thankfully I rented after all, and which the whole family found to be an exciting, funny, visually amazing, rip-roaring thrill-a-minute up-beat adventure story. It's got incredible animation of a Rube-Goldbergesque world where every other second there are a dozen visually arresting images and actions. The characters are great--funny, cute, engaging, complex (as opposed to the frozen cardboard ones of Ice Age), the story engaging, and the script is chockfull of musical and cinematic quotes and references. The Gene Kelly ""singing in the Rain"" fountain scene is just one of many such gags, and on top of that there's all the funny dialogue, which even when it's aimed at adults as in the case of Robin Williams' character, a 5 year old can have fun with as mere words without having to understand the meaning. For example, my 5 year old immediately parroted back Robin's bit about having to run in these ""cha-cha heels"". He found all this type of dialog funny on a basic verbal level, which in fact is what makes verbal comedy funny for kids as well as adults even though they have different levels of understanding of the underlying meaning.

All in all I highly recommend Robots as a movie which all the family will want to see again and again, because that is the only way one is going to catch all the visual and verbal gems in this whiz-bamg rapid-fire film.",1135728000,2,3103,4.700367647058823
1191140,5,B0000063XU,"I can't come up with one thing not to like about this movie.  The animation is superb, with many a subtle whatsit worked into the background, the star-studded voiceovers are excellent (and just because Robin Williams has a relatively small part here doesn't mean he's not funny), there's wild fun and abundant laughs to be found everywhere, and there's an uplifting story with all kinds of morals at the heart of everything.  Robots is a great family film that proves as entertaining to adults as it is to children.

This is the story of Rodney Copperbottom (Ewan McGregor), an idealistic young inventor from a humble robot family who dreams of going to Robot City, meeting famed inventor/robotitarian Bigweld, and helping to make the lives of all robots just a little bit easier.  He doesn't mind the fact that his parents can only give him hand-me-down parts, and he's not ashamed that his father is only a dishwasher in a little restaurant.  When he comes of age, though, he faces the moment when he must decide whether to pursue his dream or adopt a ""never try, never fail"" outlook on life.  He goes to Robot City full of vim and verve - but things aren't the way they're supposed to be there.  He can't even get in the gate, and it turns out that some schmuck named Ratchet (Greg Kinnear) is now running the company in the place of a conspicuously absent Bigweld (Mel Brooks).  Ratchet, in cahoots with his horrible chop shop bot mom, declares war on outmoded bots.  With no parts available for repairs, the older bots will have no choice but to purchase the company's expensive upgrades or fall prey to the sweeper and chop shop oblivion.

Rodney makes some interesting friends in the big city, including a run-down crackup named Fender (Robin Williams), the aptly named Aunt Fanny (Jennifer Coolidge), and even a Bigweld corporate exec named Cappy (Halle Berry).  He sets himself in opposition to Ratchet when he begins repairing all of the outmoded robots, but he knows he can't stop Ratchet's terrible plans unless he can find Bigweld himself.  It's your classic ""do-gooder underdog takes on the man"" kind of film, and it works really well as such.

You can shine no matter what you're made of; that's the message you take away with you from the film.  It doesn't matter where you come from, what you look like, or what you do - you're just as important as anyone else.  With that kind of positive message incorporated into a zany, wonderfully crafted, very funny film (with more celebrity voices than you can shake a spare robotic arm at), I have to repeat myself and say there's absolutely nothing not to like here.",1135641600,,2626,4.703056768558952

When the Copperbottoms find out they're going to be parents, they are so excited that the father runs through the street stuffing cigars into robots' mouths. Once home, and peering into the box of parts, he realizes the task ahead of him: assembling a son. Rodney Copperbottom (Ewan McGregor) is born. We whisk through his childhood and into his teens where we discover his true calling: to become an inventor.

Following his dreams, he travels to Robot City to meet his mentor, Mr Bigweld (Mel Brooks), an inventor of all things Robot-like. But upon entering the city and coming to the gates of Mr. Bigweld's offices (ala the gates of Oz), Rodney finds that Mr. Bigweld is nowhere to be found and the company has been taken over by the corrupt Ratchet (Greg Kinnear). Secondhand parts are a thing of the past and Ratchet orders all faulty parts melted down. Every Robot must now purchase upgrades. Can't afford them? Sorry, you'll have to be scrapped.

Along with a bum-like robot called Fender (Robin Williams ....think THE FISHER KING) and several hundred of his obsolete buddies, Rodney is headed toward trouble ...and maybe success.

______________________________________________________________________________

Coming off the heals of such phenomenal animated features as SHREK, FINDING NEMO, and ICE AGE, this film falls short but delivers on laughs and fun thanks to the energetic voice of Robin Williams; without him I fear this movie would've flopped entirely. But his action-packed antics made it completely watchable.

There have been comments about how slow ROBOTS was to get going, and this is undeniably so. But it was a fairly decent attempt at character and plot set-up. And although ROBOTS lacked anything new in the form of animation or concept, it did entertain enough to make me finish watching and even emitted a guffaw or two.

But is it on the same level as those earlier animated super-films? No way. Not even close.",1135296000,2,2100,4.968660968660969

I think it is great because I think it was much more tastefully done than some of the other animated movies...many nowdays seem more interested in adult comedy than what is appropriate for children. However, I think that there are several parts/jokes that parents can really relate to (ex. the 12 hours of labor joke).

There are a few places where the humor is a little crude but the kids do not really get it and it is not nearly as crude as Shreck.

The only other parts of the movie that may desturb young children is when Ratchet goes to visit his mother, the sweepers, and when Fender looses his bottom half and picks up a ""woman"" robot's bottom. My 3 year old wasn't scared by any of these parts but she kept asking me why the ""Mom"" was mean and sounded like a boy, why the sweepers kept picking up parts and one of the robots and if they were hurt by it and where they were going, and why the boy robot had on a girl skirt. Some of these things sound a little odd but I think they were ok within the context of the movie. After doing a little explaining she was fine and has even been repeating a few lines from the movie...which she has never done before with any show.

I would recommend this movie to anyone but I think parents should watch it first and make sure it is appropriate for thier children.",1134864000,2,1416,4.1231884057971016

When he gets there, the company has been taken over by a shiny, nasty robot named Ratchet. Ratchet is being guided behind the scenes by his mother who runs an underground lair that grinds up old, antiquated robots. Rodney helps Bigweld take his company back, gets the girl, gets new parts for his ailing father and makes a bunch of new friends along the way.

The animation is good and the look of the robot towns is inventive. There are good voices here, Robin Williams, Ewan McGregor, Mel Brooks, Greg Kinnear and others.

And while Robots is certainly entertaining, it never ratchets itself up into the land of four stars.

The natural comparison is Monsters, Inc., which I still pull out every so often (more often now that I have an 18 month old daughter). Sections of Robots are filled with the same sorts of allusions that generate an chuckle at the cleverness of the creators. That cleverness, however, overloads the movie, and feels too intentional (""Wouldn't it be clever if we...""), instead of giving additional levels of amusement.

The cast of characters is, also, I think a bit too large for total enjoyment on a first viewing, as I was too busy trying to keep track of people, not knowing how significant they were going to be.

And all that, the cleverness and the number of characters, and the clear amount of thought and energy that went into this makes me think I'm going to watch it again, and probably even enjoy it more the second time around.

Robots has the same team that directed Ice Age, Carlos Saldanha & Chris Wedge, whom started animating this movie after the release of Ice Age.

1191212,3,B0000063XU,"There seems to be 2 camps when it comes down to CGI animated films: Pixar, and everyone else. Those everyone elses' include Dreamworks(Shrek, Madagascar, Antz) and Blue Sky(this film, Ice Age). Looking at the last camp, it clearly shows they're still not at the level as Pixar, simply because the latter companies try to hard to be funny and charming. Their films are practically littered with pop culture references and puns. Well Pixar had that Jurassic Park parody in Toy Story 2 or Raiders of the Lost Ark in Toy Story 1 right? True, but at least it had other things as well. Here it's just one gag/pop culture reference after another and it becomes thin.

Rodney is a robot who wants to be an inventor, like his hero Bigweld of Bigweld Industries. When he goes to Robot City, he finds that not only does Bigweld Industries not accept inventors anymore, they actually don't even have Bigweld run the place. So Rodney is shut out and meets a ragtag group of robots. And you guessed it, he must make everyone band together to stop the corporation.

Now, if it seems like there's a certain ""I've mentioned this kind of plot before"" tone in my voice, well then you guessed right. Having a loner group of heroes band together against more stronger enemies has been done before but it's for the kiddies but if you're a kid, you'll most likely like this movie, if you're an adult, you might.

If there's one thing you can count on with animated films is great visuals and of course Robots look great. The images and colors are sharp, robots are really detailed and when they do that rising shot that reveals Robot City you're like ""wow"". And this is true throughout the film as well.

Look at the cast list for Pixar films: Don Rickles, Jim Varney, Dave Foley, Richard Kind, Allison Janney and Sarah Vowell. Half of those you can't even figure out where they're from right? We'd actually have to tell you where they're from and you go ""ohhhhh right!"" Well anything non-Pixar is essentially a who's-who of Hollywood talent. Look at this cast list: Ewan McGregor, Robin Williams, Halle Berry, Drew Carey, Albert Brooks, Greg Kinnear. Jeez, it's like that Live Aid charity single on film. Personally a standout was Amanda Bynes, not only for being cute in general but for actually being a bit beyond just a ""wow is that actually Halle Berry doing a voice?""

Doubtful I'll ever purposely watch it again.  This is another one of those poorly executed great ideas that you watch die onscreen....you've seen it before:  The poor but determined kid leaves the small town to make his dreams come true in the big city, only to find that the big city is not all that he thought it was.

This would have been perfectly acceptable for a made for TV movie, but for the big screen I expect a little more.  The forced gags (the Brittney Spears dance number, ""Scareface"" reference, and flatulence jokes) were weak, animation and music was bland (I'm sorry, but even the inclusion of the Tom Waits song ""Underground"" couldn't save it), and the dialog and story were predictable.

I can understand how kids under the age of eight might like a movie like this, but this isn't what I would consider ""family"" entertainment.  Hollywood has seemingly lost it's way, or else the public has either forgotten or simply expect less nowadays.  It's really too bad - the technology is so promising.

Here is a short summary:

The hero Rodney goes to the big city to seek his fortune with his hero, Bigweld, only to discover the bad guy ratchet has taken over. He has to find Bigweld and convince him to come back. That's about it.

Throw in bad mamma of Ratchet who is a shameless rip-off of the witch in ""The Wiz"", some really pointless flatulence jokes and you have the whole movie. Even the pace was too slow.

On the technical side, there is too much on the screen constantly to focus on. On a normal TV the entire show is too tiny to see in the widescreen edition.

1191255,2,B0000063XU,"Robots is what happens when you take a simple story, put it in the hands of talented animators and an exceptional case of actors to provide the voices; and then just allow the project to drift.  For all its promise, the movie just falls flat on its face.  I'm guessing that there was no strong guiding force with a coherent vision to bring all of it together.  Read on and you'll see what I mean.

The story is simple enough, ""young robot inventor heads off to the big city to make good, encounters evil corporate titan that has unseated the benevolent founder of his business, and struggles to make things right.""  Rodney Copperbottom wants to become an inventor for Big Weld Industries, and work for his idol, Mr. Big Weld -- whose philosophy has always been to make life better for the common robot.  The overall vision of this alternative robot universe is quite compatible with the far, far better Monsters Inc., but the details just seem to get jumbled.  Consider the transportation system of Robot City, which combines elements of the game MouseTrap, pinball arcade games and gyroscopic toys from the 50's.  It all makes for a great visual, and a chuckle or two, but does little to advance the story.

The animation is detailed and well done, perhaps a little too well done.  The detail is extraordinary, and I suspect it looked great on a movie house screen.  But viewing it on DVD, you're tempted to hover over the pause button just to answer the many ""what the heck was that in the background?"" questions.  But again, these little details do little more than generate a smile or two, while the story just limps along.

That brings us to the cast.  Ewan McGregor and Greg Kinnear provide the voices for Rodney and his nemesis Ratchet, and they do a good job with generally bland material.  But the tragedy of this production is that someone recruited Robin Williams and Mel Brooks (arguably two of the funniest men on the planet), and then gave them sober pills!  Whereas on Disney's Aladdin, Williams was given free rein to adlib and build his character, on can almost see the script supervisor hovering over him as he stood at the microphone reading his lines for Robots.  The same with Mel Brooks, the voice is there but the jokes obviously came from someone else.

It's not necessarily a bad movie, but it's not worthy of the popularity that the previous work from this creative team (Ice Age) turned out.  It ends up looking rushed and pieced together, and never really makes a connection with the audience.",1128297600,3,2521,4.66289592760181
1191256,4,B0000063XU,"Robots!!  Well if you haven't seen the movie yet and are a fan of this style of movie at all, then I reccomend watching it.  Sure, its not Finding Nemo, or The Incredibles, but it is a very entertaining show.

Basically the plot goes like this:  A new baby (Rodney Copperbottom) is born (well assembled anyway) and he grows up in poverty; His father is a dishwasher at a local resturaunt. Rodney's family love him and raise him with lots of love and affection.  He grows up and sees that his father is doing all he can to give Rodney a good upbringing.  Then as Rodney is growing up, he is inspired to become an inventor by watching a television show called the Big Weld Show.  Rodney grows up learning to invent and when he finally moves out of the house he decides to show an invention of his to Mr. Big Weld in the hopes that he will land a good job and then help his Father get out of his situation and have a better life.  What Rodney finds out is That Big Weld industries is being run by an evil Money monger and Mr. Big Weld has gone into a forced retirement.  Rodney meets up with some really funny Robots and his adventure begins.  Eventually, the movie has a happy ending and Rodney saves the day.

Yes the movie is a bit predictable, but hey, aren't they all really??  We usually like to have a happy ending with a hero winning and a villian getting what is due.

I read other reviews that say the fact that they are Robots, they had a hard time relating to the show, but in my opinion, the voice acting was done very well and I never had a problem relating to any of it.  All in all, its not my most favorite movie, but I will buy it to add to my collection cause it was a fun and origional movie.  The older I get the harder it seems that hollywood can think up anything origional anymore, but they keep surprising me!

1191258,5,B0000063XU,"The 2005 animated film ""Robots"", created by Blue Sky Studios and Fox Animation Studios, tells the fictional tale of a young robot named Rodney Copperbottom (voice of Ewan McGregor) who lives in a world populated purely by robots.  After he was built and upgraded (often with spare parts) by his parents, he decides to venture from his small town to Robot City where the famed robot Bigweld (voice of Mel Brooks) resides.  Rodney, inspired by Bigweld who spends his life inventing and improving parts for robots, has become an inventor himself partly to help his father Herb Copperbottom (voice of Stanley Tucci), who has been a dishwasher for many years and is increasingly in need of repair.  However, spare robot parts are becoming increasingly scarce because a greedy robot named Ratchet (voice of Greg Kinnear) and his mother Madame Gasket (voice of Jim Broadbent) took over Bigweld's robotic supply company.  Their plan is to replace outdated robots with new sleek models and reap the profits.  To do so, they need to melt down as many spare parts as possible to create their sleek new designs.  So, many robots run fearfully away as the large collector robots scour Robot City for spare parts that they then take to the furnaces operated by Madame Gasket.  In desperation, many outdated robots that are breaking down come to Rodney in hopes of being repaired.  Rodney then becomes determined to help them with assistance from an odd assortment of other robots.

With wonderfully rendered computer animation and a wonderful story, ""Robots"" is a fun and engaging story for both young and old alike.  Other interesting characters include Piper (voice of Amanda Bynes), Crank (voice of Drew Carey), Aunt Fanny (voice of Jennifer Coolidge), Fender (voice of Robin Williams) and Lug (voice of Harland Williams).  The story for the film (written by Ron Mita, Jim McClain and David Lindsay-Abaire) is possibly an allegory to modern society as demonstrated by it's conveyance of greed and the constant need to upgrade trying to replace a philosophy based upon repair, reuse, recycling and thrift.  Overall, I rate ""Robots"" with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.",1128211200,2,2166,5.002785515320334

1191281,4,B0000063XU,"The strength and weakness of ""Robots"" is found in the revelation somewhere in the special features that the genesis for the 2005 film was the idea to do a computer animated movie about robots.  This led to production designer William Joyce coming up with robots inspired by outboard engines and metal items found around the house rather than the cinematic traditions represented by ""Metropolis"" and ""Forbidden Planet.""  Listening to how they came up with the ""generations"" of robots was fascinating and you can see how once they latched on the idea there were inspired to come up with all of the delightful creations we see on screen.  Consequently the characters pretty much came before the story and while director Chris Wedge and co-director Carlos Saldanha (the ""Ice Age"" team) have created a wonderful world, the story being told does not rise to the same level (to wit, it needs an upgrade).

The irony is that why the character designs work on two level so that adults can enjoy them in a different way from the kiddies, does not apply to the story, which is programmed for the short set (despite the cinematic and cultural references that only older viewers can get) and based on a simple message written large and hammered repeatedly: you should follow your dreams.  The dreamer in this case is young Rodney Copperbottom (voice of Ewan McGregor), an inventor, who leaves Rivet Town for the big metropolis of Robot City, to work for his hero Bigweld (Mel Brooks).  Rodney leaves behind his parents, Herb (Stanley Tucci), a dishwasher, and Mrs. Copperbottom (Dianne Wiest), and the initial problem is that Herb needs spare parts that are no longer available.  Rodney discovers this is because of a larger problem: Bigweld has disappeared and in his place are Phineas T. Ratchet (Greg Kinnear) and his evil mother, Madame Gasket (Jim Broadbent), who want all of the robots in the world to upgrade or go to the scrap heap.

I have to stop and wonder if younger viewers will make any connection between Ratchet and Gasket's grand plan and the Nazi designs for helping along the creation of a master race through the practice of eugenics.  Or will they simply see this as just another example of the economic imperative for things to become new and improved?  There is a larger lesson here, but ""Robots"" just takes the evil at face value with the undesirable result that the villains are too buffonish to be really evil but doing things that are evil enough that their humor rings hollow.  If the success of a film ultimately rests on the villains, then ""Robots"" is at a disadvantage for anyone who is a bit along in grade school.

As much as I enjoy Robin Williams jumping off into the deep end of the pool casting him as the voice of Fender works against ""Robots"" as far as I am concerned.  None of the other supporting characters stand a chance as long as he is around, and most of the better bits in the film gravitate towards his character.  Only Jennifer Coolidge's Aunt Fanny provides any real competition, and that is mainly because that baby has back, although Paul Giamatti as Tim the Gate Guard has a nice scene, but they really should have spread the wealth a lot more given the rich characters they created.  The other thing that bothered me was that I wanted Rodney to end up with Piper (Amanda Bynes) rather than Cappy (Halle Berry), because I thought they were the more appropriate pairing given Rodney's youth and the way the film is geared for the kiddies.  But ""Robots"" is totally locked into the formula by that point in the film.  The best thing that can be said about this film is that if ""Robots"" is an average computer animated film, then that still constitutes an above average film.",1128124800,,3711,4.702160493827161

I got an advanced copy of this DVD, and went into it expecting it to be okay, and by the time the end credits ran, was a true fan of this remarkable film.

What I DON'T get, is all of the mediocre reviews that I've since been reading on this film.

The animation is incredible, the characters are alive, individuals, who you like and care about, and the story is fun and full of great gags, both sight and verbal.

So, why all of the so-so reviews then?

One reviewer mentioned the ""Fart"" jokes, as if this were a bad thing, I mean come on people, this is suppose to be a kids movie after all, and believe it or not, kids (and most adult males :) still find ""Fart"" jokes funny.

Another reviewer felt that the story wasn't so much a story, but rather a bunch of gags strung together, which isn't true at all, as there is a story (be it a rather simple one, but a story none the less) with the gags helping to both flavor and move the story along.

But the most amazing criticism that I read was that the animation was only so-so.

First, let's take into consideration that the first film that this company produced was Ice Age, a film who's animation and character designs where of very low end quality (when you compare it to stuff like, Finding Nemo) and that this is only their second computer animated film, and you'll see what a HUGE jump in design and animation, has occurred.

And secondly, even the much beloved, The Incredibles (which, up till, Robots, was my all time favorite computer animated film) is no match, in detail, to Robots, where every scene and character, is textured in rich detail, from shadow, to grease, to corrosion, to background action.

And the gags, oh man, the gags are plentiful and hilarious, I mean, how can you not laugh when a robot, surrounded by an enemy bent on it's destruction, in sudden desperation, suddenly brakes into a Brittney Spears dance routine, thus distracting and destroying the enemy, in the process.

And Robin Williams gets to have fun, ala Aladdin, being left to run wild, but also being edited, so that only the really funny and clever bits are kept in the film.

So, do yourself a favor, and dismiss all of the mediocre reviews, and rent or buy this DVD. Then sit back, pay attention, and enjoy this GREAT little treat of a film, and let the kid in you, out for an hour and a half.

His dad worked in a restaurant as a dishwasher, so instead of shiny new parts, Rodney always had hand-me-downs.  But Rodney dreamed of a better life as an inventor.  So when he's finally old enough, Rodney decides to say goodbye to his parents.  He buys himself a one-way ticket to Robot City, where he'll finally meet his hero, Bigweld (Mel Brooks) and make his dreams come true.

Once Rodney arrives in Robot City, however, he finds that Bigweld has disappeared, and he's been replaced by Ratchet (Greg Kinnear), who, with his mother, Madame Gasket (Jim Broadbent), is plotting to do away with hand-me-down robots once and for all.  Together, with his new friends (including Fender, played by Robin Williams, and Piper, played by Amanda Bynes), Rodney decides to find Bigweld and bring him back to Robot City.

Don't expect any Oscars for Robots-because it's just another animated movie.  Yes, the animation is pretty cool, but that doesn't carry this movie past its dull and unoriginal plot.  Robin Williams, who brought life to Disney's Aladdin, may be a bright spot, bringing plenty of laughs-but even he couldn't make this movie more than just so-so.  Robots is an amusing movie-good for a few laughs.

""Robots"" is an allegory to the imagined USA that existed in the fifties of the 20th Century (and against superficial commercialism and fashion).  Suposedly, corporations were good then and their interest was to make our lives better.  Fifty years passed by, and still Hollywood want us to believe that this is the bussiness entour we must protect (and I am not even sure that this kind of enterprise existed once).  Schumpeter's animal spirits had been replaced long ago by the pure capitalist drive which is to maximize profits (who doesn't know this?).

The animation is really nice and the pop references find a place between the populist Dreamworks jokes and the intelligent Pixar homages: we get Britney Spears (-), but also a robot version of ""Singin' in the rain"" (+).  Some sequences are very kinetic and sorprendent: the local mode of transport (not very efficient, btw) and the dominoes wave.  Is a nice rent (or a buy for a child), but don't expect more than that.  For your children, you could do worst than this.

(Is really disturbing that in a fantasy environment the animators need to reproduce American capitalism: why the robots need to work? why they have kids? why they need a corporation? etc.  Is not clear).",1127174400,4,1434,4.741935483870968

1191333,4,B0000063XU,"If you remember Chris Wedge's previous work 'Ice Age,' you know what I am trying to say.  Like that enjoyable animation film, his new film 'Robots' offers striking visuals, but no orignal story.  Having said that, I find 'Robots' very entertaining.

The film begins when a new member arrives to the Copperbottoms family.  Actually, a robot boy is literally 'delivered' to them, and after long toilsome 'labor' our hero robot Rodney is born.

The situation is surely corny, but let's wait for a while.  The film barely succeeds in concealing that fact by giving some silly sight gags when Rodney grows up (yes, he grows ... don't ask me how) to be an amateur inventor.  Aspiring to be 'somebody' Rodney (voiced by Ewen McGregor without Scottish accent) goes to the big city called 'Robot City' where he thinks he can meet THE greatest inventor Doctor Bigweld (voiced by Mel Brooks).

Actually, as you know, what Rodney finds there turns out different.  Instead of seeing his dream come true, Rodney is treated bad (especially by the annoying guard voiced by Paul Giamatti).  Broken-hearted Rodney meets new friends there, one of whom is Fender (Robin Williams in his fast-talking mood), who gives some funny slapstick gags using his own body.

Two things are memorable.  One of them is the film's visuals.  The color texture of the robots (including their nuts, screws, even the shadows) are realized with delicate touch, and the long shot showing the big city is simply beautiful.  Other great thing about the film is its voice cast, which includes, besides the players named above, Halle Berry, Drew Carey, Greg Kinnear, Jay Leno, James Earl Jones, Jennifer Coolidge, Diane Wiest, Stanley Tucii, Dan Hedaya, Natasha Lyonne, and Jim Broadbent.  Some of them appear, however, very short -- James Earl Johns as phone booth, for instance -- so do not miss their voices.

The jokes are not particualry new, and some of them are too tired, gross, or sexual, I am afraid, for the kids.  But still 'Robots' remains delightful to see throughout.  Not a gorundbraking effort, but entertaining nonetheless.",1123113600,3,2096,4.957020057306591

1191354,5,B0000063XU,"Animation is a hot genre these days, thanks to the phenomenal success of Pixar's multi-million dollar blockbusters ""Toy Story,"" ""Monsters, Inc,"" and ""Finding Nemo,"" and DreamWorks' ""Shrek."" These studio giants have opened the door for other, smaller companies like Blue Sky Studios to release innovative and high-quality movies, such as their first film, ""Ice Age"" in 2002, and their new, more ambitious endeavor, ""Robots.""

Visually, ""Robots"" is stunning, both in the look of the world and the creativity of its inner workings. The colors are vivid and the setup is ripe with potential for visual gags. The first half hour of the film is especially entertaining, beginning with Rodney's ""delivery"" as a baby. In the robot world, babies are delivered in boxes and are put together like children's toys at Christmas.

The characters, led by an all-star cast of distinctive voices, are fun too, especially Broadbent's deliciously evil Madame Gasket and Williams's high-energy Fender, though I thought Williams could have been given more screen time and more freedom to improvise.

The film's only weak spot, if you can call it that, is in its overzealousness to please. At times, there are so many visual elements, action sequences and gags going on at once, it feels as though we have no time to breathe. But, I applaud the creators for their passion for the project. I'd much rather see a studio go too far with its enthusiasm than not far enough. The film's storyline, too, could have been a bit more complex, but kids will love it, and parents will appreciate the complexity of the visual world in exchange for what it might be lacking in story. Overall, this film is a joy to watch, primarily because its cup runneth over with creativity and delight. It's obvious the creators put a lot of time and soul into it, and it paid off-- in spades.

It's exciting, too, to see this level of animation coming more frequently to the big screen. Pixar sparked a new interest in animation with its release of ""Toy Story"" in 1995, and has bred an entire generation of animation lovers over the past decade with its subsequent blockbusters. This trend, in turn, has given companies like Blue Sky Studios, Fox, DreamWorks, and others an audience hungry for more of what they have to offer - and they are only too happy to deliver.",1120348800,23,2319,4.848484848484849

You keep seeing new computer animated movies coming out and they're either copied ideas from previous ones, or they're just plain not funny. Or both. Shark Tale, to name one. The Incredibles had enough action and stuff in it to make up for the lack of belly-shaking humor, but it still could've been better.

Robots has some hilarious sequences in it. Namely, Rodney and Fenders armpit moment, in which everyone in the house joins in *most memorable line* - ""Aunt Fanny, we were using our ARMS!!!"" Another sequence that made me split was Fender's dance moment. The idea of Robin William's robot wearing a small skirt and dancing is funny enough; combine it with Britney Spears' hit Baby One More Time and you've got serious funniness.

1191361,3,B0000063XU,"Perhaps I'm spoiled by all of the wonderful Pixar flicks, but ""Robots"" just doesn't hold up too well when compared to them.  The story is fine, but it seems to be spread a little thin in this flick.  Our hero, Rodney Copperbottom, leaves Rivettown for the big city to become an inventor and eventually repair his overworked and underappreciated father.  When he reaches Robot City, he finds a great company that has been overrun by corruption and greed by the spoiled crybaby, Ratchet, who's helping his mother take control of the city.  From there, we are offered up a good mix of characters who help Rodney save the day.

Ewan McGregor does a good job as Rodney, and Greg Kinnear was surprisingly good as Ratchet.  The rest of the cast did a fine job, but the glaring letdown was the performance of Robin Williams as Fender, Rodney's comical sidekick.  Having voiced the genie in ""Aladdin,"" you'd expect more of the same from Williams, but his delivery is flat and overshadowed by the other robots in the flick.

I don't recall any bad words in the film.  In fact, they're covered up with words like ""scrap.""

The animation is pretty good, but those spoiled by ""The Incredibles"" and ""A Bug's Life"" will be left wanting more.

Overall, not a bad film.  It will never achieve the status of fellow Pixar outsiders like ""Shrek"" and ""Ice Age,"" but it is a good film to have in your library if for no other reason to appreciate the animation for what it is and the performances of Ewan McGregor and Kinnear.

1191393,4,B0000063XU,"As reviewers, it's natural for us to compare an artist's work to his/her previous album, movie, book, etc. In this case, it becomes ""natural"" to compare ""Robots"" to the previous animated hit by Fox, ""Ice Age"". If we do this, ""Robots"" comes out lacking against its frozen predecessor. It is not as novel in terms of its intent and also the script is not as powerful (perhaps because it's also tougher to relate to inanimate beings such as robots, than it is to relate to animals or humans). But still, it is a funny (though predictable) movie, with touching moments and plenty of excitement all through it. I particularly enjoyed the ride that Rodney is put through when he arrives in Robot City, in order to get to the headquarters of Big Weld, where he dreams of working.

The humor can be argued to be more adult-oriented, but still with  proper supervision, I totally see it being fit for children. The fact that our 18-month old was jumping out of his seat halfway through the movie is more the result of him being hyper than the movie not being fit for children. Now I admit this is no ""Finding Nemo"" (which keeps him entertained all through it, time and again). So, bottom line, while not as good as or innovative as ""Ice Age"" and without a very powerful storyline and groundbreaking animation as ""Nemo"" got us used to, ""Robots"" is still a funny movie worth checking out.",1115596800,41,1377,4.57085020242915

I was THOROUGHLY disappointed. I didn't care about the characters, who never really grew or changed.

The jokes that I felt in ""Ice Age"" were timeless, were non-existent in this movies. The subtle animation (e.g., guilty downward glances, pauses in steps) to convey emotion was also missing.

1191396,3,B0000063XU,"The art and animation in ""Robots"" are the star of the show --incredibly detailed and inventive. The commuting scene near the beginning is a vertiginous and seemingly endless escapade through loops and jumps and slides that was as delightful to the eye as it was turbulent to the stomach. And there's a domino scene that is just stunning. The movie's characters are lovable and well-drawn, and the action is VERY fast-paced.

The story--a hoary and cliched tale of a down-and-out kid trying to make it to the big time--nearly sinks the film. There were the expected subplots of ""doing it for my Dad,"" and taking on the big corporation -- this time a soul-sucking firm intent on making a profit (and running out the small-timers) with shiny new products that everyone was induced to buy. I don't suppose there's any irony that the film, made by a big business (20th Century Fox), is making oodles by pandering to the very folks who are pushed around by big business. Alas.

""Robots"" includes an awful lot of toilet and sexual humor, most of which will sail thankfully right over he kiddos' heads. Some won't, though, and is thoroughly unfunny. A character with an enormous backside was the source of a string of vacuous rear-end jokes. The extended farting scene might have delighted six-year-olds but seemed out of place in a robot movie -- don't you need flesh to fart? And was it that hard for the writers to resist telling a meek character to ""grow some bolts""? One senses that Robin William and Drew Carey (who voiced two of the characters) improvised some if this ""adult"" dialog. We're a long way from ""Alladin,"" here, both in humor and intelligence.

Personally, the best way to enjoy the movie is with the dialog off, allowing you to enjoy the incredible animation (the shots of oil flowing over metal are incredible) and action without the turnoff of the incessant potty humor and banal story line.",1114128000,4,1905,4.766666666666667

Rodney had been taught: ""if you see a need, fill it!"" which gets the story rolling to its happy conclusion.

Fender, Rodney's side kick is played by Robin Williams, who is in fine form. Ewan McGregor is OK as Rodney, and the rest of the cast supports this gleeful madness with aplomb. My 5 year old was literally on the edge of his seat for the whole thing (as opposed to The Incredibles, where he was bored at the talky bits and wanted to go home) and my 12 year old loved the little smatterings of naughtiness (farting, urinating jokes).

Robots is the story of Rodney Copperbottom voiced by Ewan McGregor , a young and enterprising inventor robot vying to one day work for the greatest robot of them all, Mr. Bigweld voiced by Mel Brooks. Rodney leaves the security of his home, parents, and small town to fulfill his dreams of working in the big city for Bigweld Enterprises. Whilst on his journey, he is befriended by a rag-tag group of robots called the Rusties, headed by Fenders (who is voiced by Robin Williams).

Any robots needing repairs must upgrade their model, or parish to the underworld of scrap-metal; ruled by Ratchet's mother, Madam Gasket.

The CGI in this film is visually phenomenal; however, the storyline reeks and the dialogue hardly clever. The film spends exuberant time on multiple disconnecting scenes such as the ""city transit system"" and ""domino falling"" sequences, which are beautiful to watch; however, meaningless to the plot of the film.

Upon his arrival at home, he and the wife get to work putting together their baby boy. The baby ""grows"" up by replacing his parts every year. Rodney grows up watching a Mr. Bigweld show on television with his father. Mr. Copperbottom looks up to Mr. Bigweld as the greatest robot in the world. Bigweld is responsible for a huge production company in Robot City that produces replacement parts for Robots around the world. He also has an open-door policy encouraging any robot with an idea to come see him.

After causing havoc in the kitchen where Rodney's father works, Rodney boards a train and sets forth to Robot City to meet Bigweld. He meets up with a group of outcasted robots--Piper, Crank, and Fender--who help him find a place to stay and get a start on his own after learning that Bigweld is no longer running his company and that an evil executive named Ratchet (Greg Kinnear) is now in charge. Ratchet has plans to get rid of outmoded robots and turn them into scrap metal. It eventually ends up leading to a battle between differing values, the old-school, common 'bots fighting against Ratchet and his army of sweepers and hatcheteers.

Visually, ROBOTS is unbelievable. The robots in the movie appear more life-like than any animated robots seen on screen before. Vivid colors brilliantly fill the screen filling one with wonderful optic sensations. Younger children especially will be attracted to the film because of the bold use of color.

The movie is also filled with all kinds of humor and cultural references. There's the occasional juvenile toilet gag thrown in, but many of the jokes go beyond that.

In a movie that is largely about color, it also uses sound throughout. In a world filled with robots, it would only seem appropriate that things are more noisy than they are in the real world. With all the metal clunking around, noise is bound to be made. In addition, there the movie boasts a fairly decent soundtrack that set the mood for many of the movie's scenes.

I enjoyed watching ROBOTS. However, as much as I liked it, I felt that the general plot and pacing of the movie suffered. Though the movie's general plot might not be all that original, it seemed that the filmmakers initially set out to give their own original take on the story. The movie moved along at a nice pace and didn't feel forced. But that changed during the last half of the movie. Right around the time that Rodney and Cappy go to Bigweld's mansion, things domino downhill. Up to that point the movie was fine, but from that point on it felt as if the filmmakers wanted to rush to the movie's conclusion to get it over. The last 1/3rd of the film doesn't fit or flow with everything previous to it. Cliches are overused and everything is just too pat-pat. For instance, a ""romance"" between Cappy & Rodney is forced, but the movie would have been more interesting if Piper and Rodney got together. It makes me wonder how much of the film was cut or edited out so that Fox could release it ""on time"".

Therefore, the movie itself is just an average animated flick. However, the theatrical release of ROBOTS includes a couple of extras that improve the general movie-going experience. Just prior to ROBOTS there is an animated short featuring Scrat from ICE AGE. Unbeknownst to many, this short is the first promo announcing the upcoming ICE AGE sequel. In addition to that, because ROBOTS is from FOX animation, the long trailer for REVENGE OF THE SITH is supposed to be shown before every ROBOTS showing. Though ROBOTS isn't in the same league as ICE AGE, it's a decent movie, full of color, and is sure to appeal to children. Just don't lose your head over it.",1112486400,,3912,4.670537010159651

- some memorable jokes/scenes

Con's

- shallow, cliched message

- seemingly no time/energy put into development of theme/message/story

- voice-overs (not bad, but certainly nothing spectacular)

- quite a forgettable story

- humor could be crude and obnoxious

However, I still found it entertaining to watch with my family with a wonderful display of CG technology along with a lot of laughs.

Positives:

1)  Humor.  Yes, there are a lot of laugh-out-loud moments.  Any comedy with Robin Williams has to be.  There was some gross-out humor (see negatives) but when they shied away from that, the movie was very funny.

2)  CG Animation.  The computer graphics were fantastic!!  This isn't a surprise as it was made by the same people that made Ice Age.  What should leave anybody left with their eyes wide open was when the star of the cartoon (Rodney) was traveling through Robot City in a ball.  It would not surprise me if this was the most time-consuming part of the animation creation.

3)  Message.  This is one of my favorite messages in any movie... if you have a dream never give up in fulfilling that dream.  There are also other messages such as caring for people no matter their age, shape, and type.

Negatives:

1)  Gross Out Humor:  While this was funny, I was surprised that they felt they needed to degrade themselves to the level of flatulence and posterior-jokes.  The movie was funny on its own and I felt no reason that they needed to get that desperate.  This movie should have been above all that.

2)  Portrayal Of Big Business:  It seems that this movie carries a negative message about big business.  As a child, after watching this movie I would think that big business must be evil and want to control the world.  Everything about business (bit or small) in this movie contradicts what really happens in the business world in order for a company to survive.  This idea that a large business would be threatened enough to want to kill (literally) an upstart mom n' pop just left me appalled.

3)  Lacks originality.  There was just nothing ground breaking or original about this movie.

4)  Lacked heart.  Often times the difference between a good movie and a great movie is the heart of the movie.  Again, there wasn't anything original and it seemed like the actors all just coasted through the production.  I just didn't see anything that said that a little extra was given into creating this movie.

The voice-overs were bland, the animation was dull (with the exception of one ""wow"" sequence), the story has been done a thousand times over, and some of the characters were flat-out gratuitous (namely Halle Barry's). On top of all of this, the writing was cliched, broad, and immature; in no way would any of it appeal to kids above the age of eleven. As I see more of these animated films from companies other than Pixar, I'm seeing less and less intelligence. To me, great animation is thoughtfully and respectfully made for all ages. The best example of this would be last year's ""The Incredibles"" (yes, from Pixar, the only non-anime company to turn out great work in the genre these days). It contained both simpler messages for children and more complex messages for adults (specifically married couples). ""Incredibles"" was an animated film to which I could respond, ""Deep stuff."" It was real and honest: a near-masterpiece. But besides the afore mentioned anime companies and Pixar, studios --like Disney-- continue to dumb down their work (and quality of animation) to give us crap like ""Robots,"" which in the end is the cinematic equivelant to setting a pile of money on fire.

Not only does it give the basic ""don't give up"" motto, but it shows that you can do better than the rich people that look down on you, or the cool people that look down on you, it almost has a hint of anti-racism in it. That the robots made of a certain model weren't good enough for the robots in a different model. Speaks to people of all ages, really.

Robin Williams isn't annoying, either, I don't know why people say that. They must just think he's annoying altogether and if that's true, then they shouldn't complain about the movie just becaue they don't like one actor.",1111795200,,756,4.316901408450704
1191468,5,B0000063XU,"What a load of miserable killjoys we have out there critiquing this movie! This was a smashing little film that the whole family could go and enjoy together and all age groups would find something in it for them!

I took my 13 year old nephew with me to see ROBOTS, we had both had enjoyed Ice Age which was made by the same film company so we were looking forward to this movie and we weren't disappointed.

The plot is short and sweet; Rodney Copperbottom a young bright and sparky Robot from Rivet City wants to be an inventor so with the blessings of his dishwasher father (literally a dishwasher!) he sets off to Robot City to link up with the famous Bigweld (Mel Brooks in a large metal pot!), a larger than life Robot who Rodney's hero, after his father that is!

Along the way we meet up with Fender, voiced over by Robin Williams, he and ""outmode"" a model of robot that in theory should be recycled, his perky sister Piper, Aunt of the very large metal backside, and an assortment of other misfits known as the Rusties who are all on the verge of a breakdown, literal and otherwise!

Rodney soon finds out that Bigweld has disappeared from his famous factory and the up-grade fanatic Ratchet is running the show and there is nothing he hates more than out moded robots.

Along with his evil mother Madame Gasket, she is actually quite a scary creation, Ratchet sets about his dastardly plan, making sure no more spare parts are made for older robots, selling the idea that new is better than old and old should be scrapped.

But Rodney has other ideas and with his plucky band of out-moded robots, a sexy upgraded female robot called Cappy and Bigweld himself, they take on Ratchet and his minions in a laugh a minute fight to the death.

Watch out for the subtle and not so subtle mick takes of many films we have seen and loved over the years, ""Singing in the Rain,"" ""From Dusk Til Dawn,"" ""The Wizard of Oz"" ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" ""Braveheart"" but to name a few, this is a fast moving, fun feel good animated comedy for the whole family.

One of the funniest moments for me was when Fender after hearing Rodney's father achieving his dream of being a musician pipes up to the silent audience of robots, ""Hey it's a new sound, Jazz and Funk, its junk!""

I cracked up.

Go and see this movie for yourself and make up your own mind, you might just surprise yourself and find you actually like it!",1111708800,,2413,4.426636568848759
1191469,1,B0000063XU,"I wouldn't have thought it possible for a computer-animated film to be described as ""lazy,"" given the amount of work required to pull off computer animation. Then I saw Robots.

Or should I say, then I saw one hour of Robots.

At the one hour mark, having checked my watch for the 4th or 5th time, I realized that it was not going to get any better. Robin Williams just wasn't going to deliver one inspired punchline. The plot was not going to take one remotely interesting twist. The fart and butt jokes were not going to stop substituting themselves for actual humor. It was going to suck out my will to live if I stayed and so I left.

I have to wonder how such a talented cast could be so incredibly misused. Wait-- Incredible-- Let's talk about the Incredibles. Another computer animated film and one that combined eye-popping animation with a compelling story sprinkled with fabulous action sequences, hysterical comedy and a surprising emotional depth. One of my favorite movies in recent history.

If anything, the brilliance of the Incredibles made me even more excited about seeing the movie Robots. And Robots, amazingly, managed to be the ""bizarro-Incredibles"" being absolutely the opposite of everything good about the Incredibles. Boring story, bland animation, almost no visual interest, not one laugh, zero emotional honesty. From Robin Williams on through the entire crew and cast it's hard to believe anyone cared about this film even as they were making it.

Due to the talent involved, the time it must have taken to make and the sheer amount of money wasted in making and promoting it, I'd have to consider Robots the worst movie I've seen in years. Or, more accurately, the worst first hour of a movie. Walking out of a theater has never felt so good.",1111536000,11,1773,4.781045751633987
1191470,2,B0000063XU,"Rodney Copperbottom (Ewan McGregor) grows up with his Mom and Dad (Dianne Wiest and Stanley Tucci) telling him that he will, one day, do great things. As a young man, he sets off to the big city to meet Big Weld (Mel Brooks), the creator of all of the robots, a great benevolent robot.  Rodney wants to be an inventor and knows that Big Weld will value and help him with his ideas. Upon arrival, he learns that Big Weld's corporation has been taken over by Ratchet (Greg Kinnear) and his mother, Madame Gasket (Jim Broadbent). Rodney soon learns of their plans and enlists the aid of his new friends to help him.

""Robots"", directed by Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha, the folks behind ""Ice Age"", is a bright, colorful, richly detailed film with very little plot.

The animation is very well done. All of the robots have slightly burnished edges or area where the paint is wearing away. This detail, coupled with an overall 50s-era visual reference creates a unique and interesting visual style that many adults may find interesting. Hopefully, because that is about all the adults will enjoy.

It is very easy to tell each of the studios animated films apart. The Disney and Pixar films are at the top of the heap. They contain an attention to detail unrivaled. Characters and story are developed to the point that they could be real people. The films contain true comedy, suspense or drama, as the story dictates. The films are also worked out to contain a lot of interesting moments for young and old alike. They appeal to everyone, which is why they will become classics. Dreamworks has a mixed record, but their ""Shrek"" films are classics, containing all of the thought and attention to detail found in a Disney film. The ""Shrek"" films are funny, irreverent gag filled fairy tales which appeal to everyone. The Fox animated films are none of these things. ""Robots"" is fun to look at, but the story if overly simplistic.

None of the voice actors is memorable or funny. Ewan McGregor seems to be auditioning for his next dramatic role. Halle Berry, Amanda Bynes, Jennifer Coolidge, Drew Carey and many more all join in, to little or no effect. The only actor who seems to be a natural fit is Robin Williams. But he is basically doing the same shtick he always does. And it is less funny than it was in ""Aladdin"".

""Robots"" will clearly enchant the children with the bright colors and the fast moving sequences. The adults will most likely find the short preceding the film more funny than ""Robots"". It features Skrich, the squirrel from ""Ice Age"" in a hilarious tribute to the Looney Tunes cartoons of the 50s.",1111536000,6,2614,4.659436008676789

However, after some clever jokes, the film falls into the same race-to-get-somewhere-without-any-plot-development that seems to plague most animated films recently.  SHREK 2 went overboard with its GHOSTBUSTERS II ending, MONSTERS INC. opened too many doors, and now ROBOTS goes on and on endlessly.  Although, Robin Williams saves the day along the way.  Kids will love it (in fact, the kid behind me giggled so loud so often, I found him to be funnier than the movie at times), and adults will be happy to keep the kids busy while not being board out of their minds.

1191472,2,B0000063XU,"Robots is a nice visual journey but not much else. The character development is weak to none, so the viewer really doesn't become attached to anyone.

His seeks out his idol, the master inventor Big Weld (Mel Brooks) who has mysteriously taken a ""leave of absence"". Along the way, Rodney encounters some friends and uncovers the mystery of Big Weld's disappearence. Robin Williams turns in a surprisingly uninspired performance as Fender who becomes Rodney's best bud. I can't put my finger on it exactly but Robots is missing something, I suspect heart. If you look at great children's films of the past ten years (Monsters Inc, Toy Story, Finding Nemo) they all endeared us to their central characters first and then told the story. Robots gives very little background information and jumps quickly into the plot. It seems as if Halle Berry's character Cappy was a useless write-in just to cash-in on star power, as her character has no essential purpose other than taking Rodney to Big Weld's home. Overall, Robots is probably a journey better left untaken; the litmus test I use is my 3 year old son and his reaction to the film was indifference.

The whole robot world and how they interact and live was really unique, the writers of the movie had very good imaginations.  It's a visually stunning film and I think all the right actors were chosen, Jay Leno plays a trash can.. haha.

1191474,4,B0000063XU,"There's no question this movie is absolutely stunning to look at.  William Joyce, the ""designer"" is one of my favorite children's book authors (""George Shrinks,"" ""Dinosaur Bob and the Family Lazardo,"" ""Santa Calls."") .  His books have a sleek, retro look that is clearly an inspiration for the look of this movie.  The idea of an essentially metallic world is wonderfully suited to CGI animation.  Smooth, reflective surfaces show off the technology best.

There are some wonderous bits in this movie, detailing a world populated by robots.  Our main character begins life not as a newborn, but as box of robot parts that his mom & dad must put together.  As he ""ages,"" he is fitted with bigger and bigger parts, until he's grown up.  That's a cute idea.  When young Copperbottom (voiced by Ewan McGregor) makes his arrival in ""the big city,"" he is taken on a ride through the public transportation system that is remarkable, clever and a great example of why seeing movies on a big screen is still so important.

I found myself smiling at the invention in the movie all the time, and chuckling at a lot of the ideas.  When robots wake up in the morning, instead of a cup of coffee, they enjoy a cuppa hot grease which they pour on their weary bodies.

The movie has plenty of gags for kids too: gas jokes in particular.

But to me, what the movie lacks is a true heart.  The story, of a young kid moving to the big city and nearly being left disillusioned, only to lead an ""assault"" against the bad guys running things, feels uninspired and uninvolving.  Who cares?  When we have our inevitable ""tear-jerker"" ending, none of my tears were jerked.  I haven't really grown to care about the characters...the filmmakers haven't earned that.  They've wowed us technically (really wowed!), made us laugh, but they haven't sucked us in.  We watch the robot world from the outside, at arms length.

The reason so many past CGI movies are such classics is because of their almost miraculous melding of incredible visuals with a story that can break your heart...remember the TOY STORY movies?  FINDING NEMO?  MONSTERS, INC.? ICE AGE?  Frankly, TOY STORY set the standard of tech/emotion melding, and if a movie falls short of that...it just doesn't get my five-star endorsement.  ROBOTS is superior to the boring SHARK TALES...but it left me somewhat cold, much like A BUG'S LIFE or ANTZ.  And it makes me worry that the artform is becoming less special.  Once upon a time, one movie a year of this wonderful new art was available to us.  Now we get several a year.  Let's slow it down a little.

Speaking of slowing down, another part of ROBOTS that bugs me is the sometimes frantic pace.  You almost feel the flop-sweats of the filmmakers trying not to let a single moment go by without frantic activity,loud noises and eye-popping visuals.  And Robin Williams, in a lead character, doesn't help this problem.  He became annoying so many movies ago.  He peaked in ALADDIN, but now his non-stop patter seems to suck energy from a film rather than add it.  He's long been outclassed by Eddie Murphy's ""Donkey"" from SHREK.

Please don't get me wrong...I'm nitpicking.  I'm giving the movie 4 stars only in comparison to its superior compatriots.  But it's still an enjoyable marvel, and I DO recommend it highly.  It wasn't perfect, but it's darn good.",1111104000,2,3344,4.721453287197232

He sets out to the big city of Robot City to find Bigweld (Brooks), an inventor who is always looking for new ideas.  When Rodney gets there though, he finds Bigweld nowhere to be found.  Instead Phineas T. Rachet (Kinnear) is in charge, with the help of his mother Madame Gasket (Broadbent) who is really pulling the strings.  Their plan is to get rid of the outmodes and make everyone into ""upgrades"" that are all shiny new and resemble Rachet.  It seems that even in the robot world, greed is a problem.  Rodney sets out with some new friends to find Bigweld, and make things right.

This is a great looking movie.  Children and adults will be drawn into the robot world.  Full of gadgets and bright colors, there is always something to catch your eye in every frame of film.  The public transportation is a wild and crazy Rube Goldman-esque ride through the city that is fun to watch.  The voices behind the robots are all solid with Robin Williams being the only standout as Rodney's friend, Fender.  You can't help but wonder how much of what he says is scripted and how much was just ad libbed.

""Robots"" is good family fun for all.  With the adult humor that has become standard for animated features in recent years, adults will not be bored.  The ideas of following your dreams and being yourself are nothing new, but they are presented well.  Fox has also showed that they can make animated movies as well as Pixar and DreamWorks, which can only lead to higher and higher levels of movie making in the future.

1191489,5,B0000063XU,"John Lasseter must be really worried about now.  Pixar has had a straight run of 6 for 6 hits. That 'Cars' has been pushed back to next year may point to problems - although with their high standards and willingness to go back to the storyboard, I'm not worried.  However, Robots is the first film to truly compete with Pixar's output in both visual and script terms.

Dreamworks had Shrek and its sequel (which were pretty good) and then disappointed terribly with the appauling Shark Tale - visually their next (Madagascar) looks undercooked.  Even Pixar's weakest (arguably A Bugs Life) is still excellent (and beat Dreamworks Antz on all levels).

By these standards Fox looked like a rank outsider.  Ice Age was good but pretty fogettable and didn't rival any of the other studios on design while the story smelled a little too much like that of Monsters Inc.  This all has lead to Robots being the biggest animated surprise in a good few years.  We all knew that The Incredibles would be good - Robots hits you right between the eyes when you're not looking!

The design is fantastic and beautifully rendered.  Its entire universe has been created from the imagination and is stunning.  Robot City is a vista that takes away the breath!

Also taking away the breath are the numerous expertly handled set-pieces.  The city's pubic transportation system gives us our best moments with a staggeringly intricate journey from the station to BigWeld Industries.  Also amazing are the domino sequence and the genuinely exciting climax. Another particular favourite moment of mine was the fight over a foot that ends up as a wonderfully choreographed ballet.

The voice talent is uniformly good. Robin Williams obviously steals the show but, since his character is pretty incidental, isn't allowed to upstage the action.

The script is tight and works on all levels - from in-jokes to fart gags - with a good message that isn't rammed down the audiences' throats.  Laugh-out-loud funny!

Overall a recommendation for any and every age group (my 3 year old was spell-bound) and an announcement that the bar has officially been raised. This will get my bet for next year's Animated Oscar!",1110844800,3,2184,4.9046321525885554
1191490,2,B0000063XU,"I went to see this movie ""Robots"" last night with my friend Michael (please see our review for ""The Polar Express"").  After ten minutes, I found myself unable to get comfortable in what normally would be a very comfortable seat. At first, I couldn't figure out why. Michael didn't look my way with a smile even ONCE during this film -- in fact, he spent almost the entire movie slumped down in his seat, a stunned expression on his face (what I imagine a shell-shocked soldier must look like). In other words, he looked like I felt.

On the way home, in the darkness of my car, the two of us were  completely silent --- RELISHING the silence. I finally spoke up and said, ""Hope you don't mind my silence!""  Michael said, ""No, it's okay. That was noisy!""  We didn't say another word until I dropped Michael off at the L'Arche home where he lives with five other residents and three assistants - all of whom had been sitting down to dinner when we were leaving -- wishing Michael a ""good time at the movies"" and me a happy birthday (just turned 58).

----

This is a film without silences -- the 'polar opposite' you might say, of ""The Polar Express"" which uses silences the way a great composer or jazz musician does -- that innate sense of taste or the knowledge that . . . what you leave OUT is often as important as what you leave in.  ""Robots"" must surely have had moments of silence - but in the aftermath (my ears are still ringing) I can't recall them.

My all-time favorite comedian Robin Williams likes to coin two-word phrases (describing, for instance a Southern dialect as ""having a vowel movement""). With Robin in mind I hereby mint one of my own, to describe this movie: 'Ear rape.'

---

If you are a mother with children, the analogy I would offer you is this: Imagine spending over an hour and a half locked in a room with noisy -- REALLY noisy -- toys that you cannot shut off.

If you are a working man, imagine being trapped for an hour and a half in a really noisy environment (think foundry or steel mill).

Prediction:  This movie - far from becoming a `classic' - will have a very short shelf life. I cannot imagine - if you see this on the big screen, (with volume levels you cannot control) ever wanting to see it on your home TV screen --- even with the sound turned low.

Come to think of it, I might watch this movie for its visuals, with the sound turned off . . . my favorite music playing in the foreground, (and perhaps some intoxicant in my veins). I believe under such controlled circumstances I could handle seeing this movie again.  The unrelenting body humor (machines losing arms and legs -- `slapstick' is what we older folks used to call this) eventually strikes most everyone as funny.

And the five minute roll of credits at the movie's end (Michael and I always stay to watch the credits and are always the only ones left in the theatre) credit hundreds of no-doubt talented people who may have worked hard to make this a VISUAL treat.

But you know what? The funniest bit of animation isn't a part of the movie proper: It's five minutes of animated fun BEFORE ""Robots"" begins.

Remember the little ""Ice Age"" creature we've seen before? -- the tiny, grey, sort of combination cat and fox (and something else) delivers its own brand of agonizing humor:  It hangs upside down to an ice-covered outcropping, clinging by its fingernails (even by its tongue, frozen to the ice) . . .  risking death-by-falling-into-an-abyss - just to retrieve its ACORN!

I am not sure what is going on with the people who make the cartoon movies but I just left with an okay feeling.  Nothing spectacular to give it 5 stars.  I will also admit I laughed in some parts just because I knew I was suppose to laugh and not actually because it was funny.

The son of an out-dated diswasher robot goes to the big city to find the great robot inventor and share some ideas that he has.  Along the way he meets up with Robin Williams who is a type of con-man robot with old parts and who is literally falling apart.  Williams is excellent in this role and is the first cartoon role where I could understand him without being out of breath.

The trip to the big city parallels for the robot inventor parallels Dorathy's trip to Oz in search of the elusive wizard.  In fact there is a door guard that kind of reminds you of the door guard from The Wizard of Oz.

We find that the great inventor has disappeared and an evil robot has taken over and has decided to force all old robots to the scrap heap, in an effort to sell robot upgrades instead of replacement parts.

The movie pokes fun at big business and their constant downsizing and cutbacks in service to increase their bottom line.

There are some amazing scenes such as a spectacular fall of dominoes and the trip that the young robot takes with the Robin Williams robot to the city.

This movie is very different than the usual ""taking animal"" animations that seem to be mandatory in these types of films these days.

1191493,4,B0000063XU,"Unlike the Pacifier that ""entertained"" (I use that term loosely) without really giving a message, Robots entertains more thoroughly and gives a somewhat cliched but very important message that kids of all ages should know.

Rodney Copperbottom, the main hero and inventor, has been getting ""hand me down"" spare parts ever since he was a child.  His family is poor and can't afford the ""upgrades"" he deserves.  One day Rodney decides to go to Robot City to find a great inventor who proclaims that everyone is special, regardless of how shiny they are, because he wants to become an inventor.  Complications arise and Rodney and friends end up having to save the robots who are considered junk.

What follows is a bunch of laughs and funny situations, most of which have been done before.  But it has a good cast of people including Ewan McGregor, Halle Berry and, of course, Robin Williams.  The animation is great and there are some nice action sequences that really made me smile.

Having been created by the team that brought us Ice Age, Robots injects some similar mechanics.  In Ice Age we had Scrat (who returned in a preview for Ice Age 2...poor Scrat, so funny) and in Robots we have Rodney's washing machine assistant, a small flying robot Rodney created to help his father.  He adds some funny scenes to the mix in a lovable way that Scrat and his eternal quest for the acorn did.  Very cute.

I guess in the end if you were to compare this movie to say Incredibles or Finding Nemo, you'd find this movie lacking.  But where I consider the Pacifier to be junk as far as a family film goes, this movie is gold.  Take your kids, friends and those young at heart.  It has a great (if cliched) message about how even those who don't have the most expensive upgrades or the most shiny parts can make a difference.  And I think that while this message has been seen a lot in movies, kids still need to hear it.  It's a good message.  And it's a good movie.

2002's ""Ice Age"" was a sizable hit for Blue Sky Studios.  While it didn't exactly make Disney and Pixar quake in their corporate shoes, it was a blip on the computer animation radar screen too big to be ignored.  The mix of dramatic storytelling, light humor, and crisp animation made the film a winner at the box office.  Now with money, Blue Sky has invested in better animation and a larger cast in their new movie, ""Robots"".  But a bigger cast is not necessarily a good thing.  Rather than just the four characters that dominated ""Ice Age"", a plethora of complex well-voiced robots star in this picture, which can make it hard to keep up with what everybody is doing at any given time.

 Rodney Copperbottom (voiced by Ewan McGregor) lives in a little burg in a world of robotic beings.  Rather than settle for being a dishwasher (literally, a dishwasher) like his father (Stanley Tucci), he decides to make something of himself and work for Big Weld (Mel Brooks), a rather large and eccentric inventor who cares about the little guys even though he's a big time money-maker.

Immediately upon arriving in Robot City, Rodney crosses paths with Fender (Robin Williams), a neglected and slightly unstable robot who leads a gang of out-of-date misfits just trying to get along in the world.  The problem is Big Weld's company has been corporatized, symbolized by Phineas T. Ratchet (Greg Kinnear), and no longer serves the public, but is only interested in making a profit.  While at first it appears that Ratchet is the evil mastermind, it soon becomes apparent that he is just being used by his own mother (Jim Broadbent) to do her evil bidding.

As the protagonist, Rodney obviously must right the wrongs and save the day with a little help from his new friends.  It's a simple idea, but comes across well, with a good message or two to boot.  As animated movies go, ""Robots"" doesn't really have anything new, except perhaps stylistically.  The whole movie feels like a 1950's-style view of a robotic future, with shiny chrome, streamlined stuff, and fins.

Of note to fellow geeks out there: as with the last Blue Sky film, the trailer for the next ""Star Wars"" film (with Ewan McGregor in a more dramatic role) is attached to ""Robots"".  And as trailers go, this one will certainly get your attention.  Also attached is short film starring Scrat, the little ""Ice Age"" rodent who's always after his acorn.

""Robots"" is a worthy effort, but falls short of becoming truly a classic, perhaps because it must juggle so many characters simultaneously.",1110672000,,3031,4.856031128404669
1191496,4,B0000063XU,"Much to my suprise, I thought Robots was just going to be good. But, it's much more than that. It's a wild and crazy adventure through Rodney Copperbottom's trip to Robot City.

Ewen Mcgregor was good. He wasn't the best one, but he was good. I think he played Rodney a little too dramatic in the Big Weld scene, and that's what threw me off a bit with him.

Robin Williams, however, was a hoot as Fender! He, as always, probably improvised with a lot of things. He did such a great job when he was ""singing in the oil"". Not to mention, he sang for help two times. Now that kicks!

Amanda Bynes was very cute as the little sister, Piper. She sounded so relaxed, and that was what made her character shine.

The animation was just like any other CGI film, except for two amazing scenes. The scene where Rodney and Fender are in that bubble type car just is amazing! It looks like it could be a ride itself! And, the Big Weld domino scene was really cool too. It made the shape of Big Weld, and not to mention, it looked like an ocean, and it sure was!

I really enjoyed this movie. Every single character played a funny role, which I liked. Some minor role point-outs were Al Roker as the mailbox, and Paul Giamatti as Tim, the gate guard of Big Weld Industries. All in all, I'd give this a solid B+. After all this praising you may ask, why did she give a B+? Well, I thought The Incredibles kicked butt, so I guess it's down there with Ice Age and stuff.

By the way, this to the kid who judged the movie on its bad poster and trailer: YOU probably look bad too! Oh let's see..the horrible shoes, the shirt! Ugh! (Heh heh)",1110672000,,1623,4.202572347266881
1191497,5,B0000063XU,My 5 year old will remember this movie for a long time. He is still talking about it the next day. I wouldn't mind going to see it again. There is great graphics for all to enjoy. The story line is precious and any parent would like the message it delivers to our kids. The cast is perfect to their robot they play. There was plenty of laugh out loud moments. I immediately got out of the theater and started making phone calls to other friends to make sure they take their kids out to see it. Anyone would enjoy this movie. It is worth the time and money to go out and see it.,1110585600,2,577,4.026086956521739
1191508,3,B0000063XU,"From the creators of Ice Age comes this nice little animated feature about Robots. In this one, the Bigweld Company has a new owner, the evil Ratchet, voiced by Greg Kinnear, who is out to replace all the old robots, so called ""outmodes"" and replace their parts with expensive upgrades to make them look sleek and shiny. Of course, our band of plucky heroes led by inventor Rodney Copperbottom(Ewan McGregor) and including Fender(Robin Williams).

The animation here is decent enough. The world and all it's mechanical contraptions but it just doesn't hold up when compared to other animated features of our time, whether from Pixar, Dreamworks or even Japanese animation. The soundtrack is nice and pleasant and the voice cast is pretty strong in names although the delivery is a bit lackluster. None of the characters stand out particularly. Even Robin Williams who is usually excellent doesn't add much here. The humor and script isn't all that great as well. The jokes are mostly aimed at children and Robots lacks the many pop culture references or adult jokes that Shrek or Pixar releases had.

Robots is a bit of a disappointment when compared to recent releases like The Incredibles. The animation and voice acting are only passable and the humor is mostly aimed at children meaning that adults won't enjoy it as much as with other animated features. Your kids will probably enjoy this film as it does feature a colorful cast of characters and some decent humor aimed at them.",1110585600,2,1484,4.908366533864542
1191509,5,B0000063XU,"Let's get the easy parts out of the way: the animation is incredible. That cross-town ride is pretty hard to forget, and the dominoes were a nice set-piece. What kept working, though, was that all of the robots were unique, and there were hundreds of them, maybe thousands, sometimes hundreds in a single scene. And they all moved right! That's a pretty big statement when ""right"" means ""right for that particular body"", and all the bodies were different. Even complex motions, like roller-derby, came across well. Technical excellence is easy, though. (If you're a super-nerd, watch for the reflections.)

Good characters are hard, and good relationships are harder. Yes, this is a movie for kids, so we're not talking about any deep subtleties. Still, you really care about Rod Copperbottom, you really feel for his parents, you really like Aunt Fanny even if you'd never want to be seen in public with her, and it's kind of sweet that Mr. Bigweld likes her for her conspicuous assets. And a little bathroom humor never hurts.

Nor does a charmingly manic performance by Robin Williams. The whole production team seems to have caught his spirit, and keeps the little visual and verbal jokes coming in a steady stream. Remember what I said about good motion? That even translated into physical humor. Movies like ""Final Fantasy"" may look good, but can't deliver a prat-fall that you'll really believe.

OK, maybe you won't remember this one in ten years. Still, whhen you see it again, you'll like it again. It's fun, it's put together well in just about every way, and it's kid-safe. And there's plenty to keep an adult amused while s/he chaperones the li'l darlin'. Enjoy.
