2570988,5,B000FKPEBK,"As the other reviews attest, most users of the Tal Reinhart Facial Workout DVD will be women anxious to avoid plastic surgery (or reluctant or unwilling to consider it).  Facial musculature, and its slippage over time however, is identical for both sexes and few males can deny that if we're fortunate enough to last to ""a certain age"" (49 in my case) we could most likely benefit from this sort of a program.

And the good news for us aging XY's is that if you can overcome your ""hell no I won't ask for directions"" stubbornness, this program can REALLY do you some good.  Tal Reinhart is not my first facial exercise guide; I've also done Carole Maggio and a couple other books, and those ARE helpful.  Nevertheless I would recommend this as the place to start.  First because VIDEO is by far the best way to learn these exercises.  Although I do the Carole Maggio workout faithfully I am never 100% sure I'm doing everything correctly.  Even the best descriptions and still photos can't demonstrate a facial move as well as video can.  Second because Tal Reinhart is VERY well organized and presented.  First time viewers can learn the individual exercises, practice them in isolation, then (quickly) advance to the full workout, offered without interruption at the end of the DVD.  This is an EXCELLENT way to organize the material and demonstrates considerable foresight on the part of the producers to optimize our use of this material.

The first part of Tal Reinhart focuses on each individual exercise, explaining not only the technique but also showing via computer graphics how age and neglect cause facial muscles to sag.  It's a horror show indeed!  House of Wax part 2!  See once-supple faces turn into cranky grandmothers before your eyes!  More than anything else these visuals reinforce why facial exercise is IMPORTANT to personal self-confidence and general ongoing maintenance.  Indeed, if you're reading this, you are most likely getting much of that motivation already from your own saggy visage staring uncomfortably back at you every morning from the bathroom mirror.

In addition to these eye-opening graphics (yes-intentional pun), the demonstrations are very slickly done and reasonably easy to follow.  It sure doesn't hurt that the individual exercise demos are split between three gorgeous young Israeli models (actually the entire production is from Israel) whose faces are alabaster perfection to begin with.  But who can fault the producers for using the beauty to which we aspire to motivate us?  All three ladies are well experienced in the exercises they are demonstrating and as indicated earlier are easy to follow along with.

But the critical question is of course does it work?  My short answer is YES however I must qualify that response by adding that I am continuing with much of the Carole Maggio workout alongside this one so it's impossible to say where one leaves off and the other begins.  The eye & upper face exercises are MUCH more comprehensible in Reinhart than Carole's books so anything above the nose I credit to Reinhart.

In evaluating this question we need to carefully consider exactly WHAT counts as success.  I realize no amount of exercise will shrink my Darth Vader helmet of a skull; I must also accept that pattern baldness is just an indignity that life commands me to endure, and like a woman refusing plastic surgery I will NEVER glue a rug to my scalp (or anything equally ridiculous).  In other words, my expectations have to be in line with what can be achieved.

Even within those limitations I'm satisfied that the results justify the effort.  I started facial exercise (Maggio) back in June '06 and only picked up Reinhart in early '07.  I have been doing both daily and fairly quickly saw my face firm up and take on a chiseled shapeliness that certainly wouldn't have happened on its own.  Taming my tendency to a double chin has taken somewhat longer but with ongoing effort it is DEFINITELY receding and I'm convinced that this too is an important battle that can be won.  I am slightly amused by other reviewers complaining that facial workouts create more lines than they erase.  What you're seeing here (for the first time) is muscular definition; would you gripe if you could see a six pack on your abs after months of effort?  EVERY change I've observed on my own face has been an improvement!

An IMPORTANT (and possibly overlooked) point made on the video is that the ""full routine"" closing the DVD serves as a basis for constructing your own personalized facial workout (the full routine on the video takes about 20 minutes).  In other words, don't just follow along with the ""full routine"" and wonder why things aren't shaping up as quickly as you'd like.  I suspect most men (like myself) will require extra work and effort to sharpen the mouth and jawline.  Be prepared to DO EXTRA reps for the areas you're particularly concerned about.  This is where it might be useful for you to have a second book or video for another perspective.  However I believe you CAN get good results using only the exercises demonstrated here, provided you'll customize your routine to match your needs.

So then, fellow males, have I convinced you?  If you're not happy with the face you're showing then here's your best chance to DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!",1174176000,176,5325,4.852713178294573
2570989,5,B000FKPEBK,"Working out and dieting can bring about major changes in your body - but those benefits don't always extend to your face.  I became interested in this DVD because I wanted to tone up my jawline, eliminating the dreaded ""double chin.""  But first I watched the entire DVD two or three times, and was impressed by how thorough, well-explained and challenging each of the exercises were.

Once you have become familiar with the system, you can just click forward to the ""Full Routine"" at the end of the DVD.  It's excellent for toning up the entire face - but my favorite sections have to be Cheeks, Jaw, and Neck.  Since I began doing these exercises about 4 weeks ago, my jawline has become significantly tighter, prettier and more defined.  Love it!",1174089600,51,748,4.67175572519084

2570991,5,B000FKPEBK,"This is a great product. Scared of plastic surgery? Can't afford plastic surgery? Don't want to look like Michael Jackson or wind up with grotesque fish lips?

Then this is absolutely your answer. Very professionally done. eight years ago I had a different facercise video, the woman who designed facercise did the video, it looked kinda home made and it made me look better than I'd looked in twenty years. Killed the double chin, tightened the jowls away, opened up my eyes....  it was very effective. Friends who saw me a month after I started were asking me what I'd done, had I gotten a little work done or what! :))

Now this one has beautiful girls and when I'm done, i get that wonderful slightly sore muscles feeling all over my face and neck that tells me this is working just as well as the other one did. And this one shows computer graphics of which muscles you're working out and what happens to your face if you don't work those specific muscles.  Ouuue. Scary and true too.

So before you go under the knife, give this a shot for a month or three.... you may decide you NEVER needed a face lift, all your face needed was a good, easy, quick exercise program like this one.

Least that's what I decided. :))",1168560000,239,1222,4.433035714285714
2570992,5,B000FKPEBK,"This is a very well executed DVD. Pleasant to watch with clear instruction. The first part demonstrates and explains all the exercises accompanied by great animation that shows facial muscles and why exercising them will help one look more youthful. The exercises are simple and easy to follow (though feel silly at first). The second part is a flowing routine incorporating the exercise demonstrated in the first part. It is only necessary to follow the second part once the exercise have been mastered, making it pretty time efficient. Definitely worth the cost (and we all know we have spent far more on cosmetics ;) ).",1154131200,21,622,4.933333333333334

2570996,5,B000FKPEBK,"I highly recommend this DVD!

I purchased this DVD for my wife three weeks ago, because she wished to have some instruction for relieving the stress in her face and shoulders.

She has suffered from stress in her shoulder muscles and facial muscles all her life and has equally experienced bad sinus problems.

Upon watching this video multiple times she was able to learn all of the very good exercises and reported to me that it also caused her sinuses to drain which is great new tool for her to control that problem.

I am posting this now some three weeks later, because she's only watched and practiced the exercises in the video a total of 8 times now, and swears she has received remarkable improvements.

The DVD itself does not promise anything, but my wife has experienced great success with total relief of the stress and tension in her shoulders as well!

The most impressive comment out of her I can report, is that she tells me that ""she can feel her face again!""",1457481600,,978,4.56

2571020,5,B000FKPEBK,"I have used other facial workout programs, and like anything, if you are diligent, they work. However Tai Reinhart is top of the line. For one thing, I love that the women performing the exercises are beautiful. I don't buy into the ""real woman"" argument. Models are real women - they just happen to look better than most of us, which I find to be motivating. I love the way the different muscles of the face are represented in separate ""chapters"" so that I can really learn the way each segment is done. Then the full routine is excellent also. I get to see three different beautiful face structures performing the various exercises. I agree with the other reviewers about the models making the exercises look easy, but isn't that what the professionals always do?? I have to concentrate intently to isolate the specific muscles being exercised the same way a body builder must isolate each muscle group to get results.
The only thing I do not like is the repetitive music. After I learned the basic format, I started muting the sound.
I definitely recommend this product to everyone. I am 63 and have to overcome some problems. If men and women would start the exercises early in life, think what a beautiful world this would be!",1400889600,4,1231,4.651376146788991

I believe it really tightens the facial muscles when done consistently!,1390003200,4,306,5.14
2571030,5,B000FKPEBK,"I actually bought this on ebay several years ago and need to pick up a new copy and am so glad I found it again on Amazon!  My DVD copy stopped working and I eventually stopped doing these and will be starting back up again soon as I get my new copy!  Folks tell me still though that I look a lot younger than my age - I even got ID'd when trying to buy a lotto ticket last month.  You have to be 18 in my state to by Lotto...  I'm 43!!  O.O  To be fair, part of that might be good genetics but I do give some credit to this dvd because I used to do these exercises pretty faithfully and have recently begun to see gravity taking over again after I stopped doing them over the last couple years...  :(

This Facial Workout is actually quite amazing! The DVD gives you a great introduction as to what muscles you are working, and has a great computer-generated display that advises which muscles you will be working in each step, and tells what working those muscles will help prevent. It makes a lot of sense and explains what each muscle group causes when the muscle declines as we age.

This is not only incredibly informative, but it is also a GREAT stress reliever especially if you get eye strain from working at a computer or any other eye-intensive work. If you've ever had a great workout that leaves your body feeling energized, this DVD does the same thing for your face. I was really surprised at how much tension I carry just in my face and around and behind my eyes since I stare at a computer all day - this actually helped me dispel a headache I'd been carrying around for nearly 2 days back when I first started the program.

The DVD works out the muscles in charge of keeping your eyelids from drooping, your forehead muscle to help the forehead stay firm and keep your eyebrows from drooping too. It also works your cheek and jaw muscles to help keep you from getting that ""jowly"" look. It even works out the eyeball muscles (which is my fave part personally), and the muscles around the lips, which keeps your mouth from drooping and your lips actually looking youthfully fuller, longer. It's very well explained and displayed in the video. It also works your tongue muscle, which seems is responsible for getting that dreaded double or droopy chin. The exercises are odd and kinda funny looking, but if you do them right, you really CAN feel them working.

Also, the ladies who display the exercises in the workout video are well chosen, as they make the exercises very easy to follow and display them perfectly and in a very serene setting. This video is not at all obnoxious, the way some videos can be. If you are at all concerned about the effects of gravity and simple aging on your face, investing in this DVD would greatly benefit you. And if you understand the principles of how working out your muscles helps keep you in better shape, then it's easy to understand why working out your facial muscles is important too!

If you spend tons o cash on expensive creams, lotions, etc., do yourself a favor and invest in this - it will only cost you $ once instead of repeatedly, but will give back a lifetime of results that no lotions or creams could duplicate.

Might even save you major $$ if you're planning getting a surgical procedure at some point in the future. No surgery can replace muscle tone or exercise, even if it can have a similar effect on your looks - kinda like physical therapy. You can have a corrective procedure, but it's not nearly as effective unless you get those muscles back in shape ;). Or, if you've already had some procedures and want to keep that look longer, start doing these exercises to keep your benefits. Your plastic surgeon may not be as appreciative, but your wallet will!",1389484800,9,3738,4.431486880466473

2571038,5,B000FKPEBK,"I do not usually go out of my way to write reviews but this this DVD has made a tangible difference in the way my face looks in a very short time, with very little effort! I'm approaching 45 in a couple of weeks, and some sustained stress over the past several months left me looking quite tired.  I eat well (I've been following the Paleolitic plan for 14 months now), stay well-hydrated, and I exercise about 20 minutes daily (yoga, pilates, strength training), so it made sense to work toward a more energized face to match the rest of me.

In just a week or two of doing daily the complete 20-minute routine that you can select from the menu, I began seeing changes, especially around my mouth.  A word of caution though, after two weeks or so, the cheeks of my narrow face began to fill out a bit disproportionately to the rest of my face, so I went to every other day to avoid getting a chipmunk-cheeked look.  But what it does for those naso-labial lines from the nose to the outer corners of your mouth is pretty dramatic--It fills them out quite nicely if practiced in moderation.  I also do a forehead and eyes only session a couple days a week now and my eyes look more youthful and open.  For me, it has not ironed out the crow's feet, but my whole face, including my eyelids, is more lifted and energetic now. And you can literally feel the firmness under the skin.  You can even feel a difference when you're smiling, chewing, or using any of the facial muscles.

In conclusion, this DVD has exceeded my expectations and I have experienced a marked improvement in the tone and youthfulness of my face.  A couple of added bonuses: As someone mentioned previously, it's a nice, relaxing transition into evening after a day at work.  And it does help alleviate eye strain for those of us who work extensively with computers.  Highly recommended.",1374883200,7,1856,4.494047619047619

I have only been doing the workout for about three weeks but in a short amount of time I have seen a tremendous improvement in my face.  I would definitely recommend buying this dvd.  It is a great facial workout and it doesn't take that long to do.,1363564800,2,364,4.260869565217392
2571041,5,B000FKPEBK,"This is my second purchase of this CD, as I gave my original copy away to my best friend.  I am over 40 and am always asked what I do to keep my face toned: I give credit to this CD.  It has the most wonderful introduction to very simple and effective facial exercises.  The explanation for each exercise shows which facial muscles are toned, so you know where the improvements should appear.  The models are beautiful and the photography is bright and clear.  I did all the exercises as directed and could see visible  results in the first week.  Many friends have ordered this CD from Amazon and everyone who has kept with the program for a week or two has seen the improvement.  Your face just feels different.  The entire routine takes 10-15 minutes, is very simple to learn and can be done anywhere.  If I can't get to sleep at night, I do the exercises: it distracts my mind from the thoughts of the day and I fall to sleep knowing I've done something productive!  Sometimes I do them while watching TV.  But I always do them at least three times a week.  If you can commit to a few minutes several times a week, you'll be pleased with the results.",1362614400,10,1154,4.336448598130841

2571044,4,B000FKPEBK,I found this DVD easy to follow and the workout makes you face muscle feel good.  I've been doing this workout for a couple of weeks and my face feels better after doing the exercises and a little firmer.,1349827200,,204,4.230769230769231
2571045,3,B000FKPEBK,"I rated this program three stars for three reasons:

1. Production quality is great, as mentioned. (The models certainly don't need facial exercise though - maybe that's why the exercises are so weak. Honestly, if you're going to take the time out of your day, choose something that works a little faster and better!)

2. The price is right.

3. The exercises, while nothing special, are at least a place to start a facial exercise regimen.

However, you should do yourself a favor and get a program that uses resistance against your facial muscles, like FlexEffect or Ageless if You Dare (which I use and LOVE).",1343433600,4,612,4.745283018867925
2571046,5,B000FKPEBK,"This is my third facial exercise DVD and my favorite so far. This particluar routine added some very unique new exercises I have not seen anywhere else. Some of the exercises appear deceptively simple at first but there is no mistaking the resulting facial muscle burn.  The tongue over teeth one for the neck is just fantastic! Once learned (super easy) the entire routine may be completed in only 20 minutes. Just enough time to really tone the face, yet not too much to overstress the muscles. If it's not enjoyable and it's too time consuming as many routines can be, then it likely won't get it done at all. I really appreciate the option at the end of the DVD to do the full 20 minute routine with model demonstration, the repetition counting done for me, while relaxing background music and a soothing environment supports my goal of actually completing a daily routine.",1337558400,12,877,4.694805194805195
2571047,5,B000FKPEBK,"Guess what, men can be just as vain about our looks as women.  True we do not like to be seen as preening ourselves in front of mirrors.  And there is belief of the ruggedly manly looks of an outdoors man.  But if we admit it to ourselves when a man first sees the tired sag in his jowl line, the beginning of crow's feet at the corners of his eyes and the lines at the corners of his mouth growing.  Well, most men will at the very lest begin to wonder where the years have gone and is it down hill from here.  Will he end up wearing his father's face?

Come on guys, we all know when we start to reach a certain age that is in the back of our mind.

Like all things in life you can either accept it or go down fighting.  Tal Reinhart Facial Workout gives you a chance to fight for the fitness of your face like you would the fitness of your body.  If you are willing to take charge of your fitness this dvd if full of exercises that target the different areas of the face that cause problems.

Don't be put off by the fact that Tal Reinhart Facial Workout is demonstrated by women, it works for men too.  Personally, I have seen my crow's feet lessen to a great degree and my jaw line tighten and I have only been doing these exercises for a month.  Granted I set aside 20 minutes daily for these exercises, but as with all exercise programs you get out of them what you put in.

I almost cannot wait to see how I look after 6 to 12 months of this program.

At Tal Reinhart Facial Workout costs a lot less than a face-lift and is more than likely a lot less painful and a lot safer.  And let's face it there is something far more manly about saying you exercise your face to stay looking good rather than saying you are visiting a plastic surgeon or getting a facial.

Buy Tal Reinhart Facial Workout, exercise and become a strong-faced man for years to come, if you are man enough. The choice is yours.",1325289600,6,1905,4.080645161290323
2571048,5,B000FKPEBK,"I had bought Maggio's book years back, but had a hard time keeping up with the exercises (pain in the butt to turn the pages and count to myself) so was looking for a DVD which would lead me through a routine without me having to think and ordered this based on good reviews. I have been doing the 20-minute routine in bed every night for the last two weeks and am really pleased with the results. I know the routine by now so can have the DVD running on low volume on my laptop while I'm watching TV - 20 minutes goes by no problem and other than the eye rolling exercise I can keep up with whatever show I'm watching. I often repeat the lower face exercises once the DVD is over - why not since I'm just watching TV anyway. I wish I had taken a ""before"" photo because I think I look years younger already - got my hair done today so was forced to look in the mirror, which I usually hate. Today I was actually happy with my face - less puffy/baggy under the eyes, no nasal labial crease and my lips look fuller too. Still need to work more on saggy jaw and double chin, but am confident that with continued practice those will improve too. I do feel a burn with the exercises and soreness after - not sure why some folks don't. The sets are beautiful, the exercises are well-explained and the voice-over is pleasant in that mellow, yoga, feel-good sort of way. The girls are young and super-pretty, which seems ironic, but that really doesn't bother me. I am 50 with a moon face which, while adorable when I was younger, had gone to looking puffy and slack. I now feel that I won't need injections to fill in the folds around my mouth and can avoid that weird flat upper lip look that you see on almost every woman over 40 on TV...in short, highly recommended.",1322784000,17,1762,4.231454005934718

It is working for me.  The familiarity with the facial muscles that you gain from this helps you to be in better control of your face and expressions.  I just pop over to the full routine and am done in no time.  Very efficient and excellent DVD.,1312070400,5,412,4.0246913580246915
2571051,3,B000FKPEBK,"I've been doing these exercises for one week (twice a day) and I would like to leave some comments on them.
First of all, I must say I am not doing them specially for the wrinkle thing, but because I would like to strengthen my right side of the face, weakened because of an accident some years ago. Everybody told me it is going to keep on being weak for ever but I just wanted to give a try to the exercises. I combine them with relaxation, palming for the eyes and other neck exercises I was already using.
After a week I must say there is a little improvement: my mouth continues to be a bit opened by its right side while is closed in the left side, but it seems to be a little less opened and I have the feeling of a more relaxed cheek. So I will keep on doing them for a while to see if it is not a ""placebo"" :D

About the DVD I agree with people complaining about the models and the footage lost between exercises. My solution was making a list of the exercises with their patterns (most of times the same) and do it by myself without the DVD.

For the ones interested in getting rid of wrinkles: I have only three problem zones, as I am 35: the smile one and the eye corner are two of them and they are really worst after a week, specially the eyes. On the other hand I have two big vertical lines dug between my eyebrows that are simply disappearing.

One last thing: there are some exercises that concern some jaw movements that I think can be harmful and not should be done. I am not a doctor, not a physiotherapist, but a musician, playing the flute professionally for many years and I must say I think the fifth exercise proposed in the jaw section should be done by no one. Besides, I would recommend not doing: the last exercise of the mouth section, the last exercise on the cheeks section and the two last exercises on the jaw section (besides the one I already mentioned). I gave these ones a try this week but my jaw started feeling weird and today it has started making some little noise, so I'll give up those ones too.

UPDATE: I changed Tal Reinhart for Isabel Morillo and worked much better. So my final advice would be to find a good book on facial yoga -Morillo's or any other one- and stick to it. Facial yoga combines strengthening movements with relaxation. Every area is covered, included skull.",1300579200,9,2326,4.255656108597285

2571054,4,B000FKPEBK,"Tal Reinhart customer service is excellent. I downloaded the video, and silly me ""opened"" it instead of ""saving"" it, and the FaceIt team was nice enough so I can downloaded and actually save it. As for the product itself, I prefer to do it in the morning because it really freshens up the face. It gives the bright eyed bushy tailed look, and hopefully as I grow older it will save me from some wrinkles. I already have smile lines that have deepened from the nose to the mouth, and if I do that in the morning it seems to lessen it.

I do feel a sensation when doing these workouts, not strong, but it seems like if one really focuses the intensity can be varied depending on how focused you are (just like body exercises)",1277942400,3,723,4.3161764705882355

The one thing I'd like to mention is that the models make it look very easy, so at first, I wasn't exercising the facial muscles as hard as I should have been. I've since done differently, and I can really feel the burn. It's too early to tell visibly if it is working, but I do feel the difference after each workout, just as I do when I exercise my body. My sister has the DVD, and she told me that her beautician recently told her she could definitely see a difference in her facial structure. I think it is well worth the money! I also own the Carol Maggio DVD, but I find that she goes very quickly in explaining the routine, and I had a hard time sticking with it and wasn't sure if I was doing the exercises correctly.

The leadup up to the actual workout is quite long and this panicked me as I had so little time to memorise it, but in reality in this professional presentation, tuition is presented the way these things should be -no short cuts just pragmatic instructions - until you really know what you are doing.

Much to my joy, the DVD actually did play here and I was able to double check its contents again. As to whether the program works- undoubtedly yes-I have heard more 'you look really well' comments than for quite a while  before starting this program a few weeks ago. Even on a purely psychological basis-it does feel so good to dedicate (only) 20 mins a day on something which more than any other part of the body 'frames' our personality so effectively.

2571064,2,B000FKPEBK,"I had bought the Carol Maggio Facercise book and DVD and used them for a few weeks, and after reading some of the reviews of the Tal Reinhart program I decided to give that a try, too.  It only took a few viewings of Tal Reinhart to decide that it was not the best face exercise program when compared to Carol Maggio's.  If you can put aside the the fancier production, lovely models and smooth narration of Tal Reinhart, the actual exercises are kind of shallow.  Some of them mimic the ones on Carol Maggio's Facercise, but most of them are different.  The models who perform Tal Reinhart's exercises are very beautiful and clearly acting and posing.  When you do the movements they demonstrate, only a few of them felt like they were really working any facial muscles.  I tried the Tal Reinhart program after having done Carol Maggio's Facercise for two weeks, and even though her exercises make your face tired and muscles burn, my jaw clicking was actually improving.  But when I tried Tal Reinhart's, those movements made my jaw feel worse and click more.

The big difference for me is that even though the Facercise presentation is a little more vague on the DVD and the photos in the book aren't always as clear as they should be, if you carefully perform the Facercise program exactly as described then you can actually feel the so-called ""burn"" of muscles in your face being pushed.  This has never resulted in any pain or strain in my face, and I have actually seen small improvements in some areas, especially forehead, nasolabial folds and an area on my right cheek that seemed ""sunken"" compared to the left one.  All of these areas have ""plumped up"" a little since doing Facercise.

I'm not expecting a miracle in my appearance, but I do expect to feel like I've actually worked some muscles and that's the difference between the two programs.  They both explain the anatomy of the face and what happens to the muscles over time - Facercise does this in the book and Tal Reinhart on the video.  But I really feel like the exercises in Facercise teach you to isolate and work specific areas of your face better.  Once you learn the program, you don't need to watch the Facercise video anymore or look at the book except to check back once in awhile.  I don't think I could have watched the Tal Reinhart video many more times without being really irritated by the acting, much less not being impressed by the exercises.",1234137600,87,2431,4.594907407407407

2571069,3,B000FKPEBK,"The good:

1)Variety and Production. There are three beautiful models (all young) performing the exercises throughout the DVD. Each model has her own set with matching color scheme and the exercises are shown from multiple camera angles.

2)Some of the exercises on this DVD are not found on other (better) DVDs so this might be a good companion to some of the other (Carol Maggio) DVDs. Some of the exercises on this program will give a nice muscle burn on parts of your face.

The not so good:

1) There are much better facial exercise DVDs out there. There is no comparison between this DVD and Carol Maggio's DVDs. On Tal Reinhart's DVD, there is no explanation of what the exercises are supposed to do for you so if you don't feel a burn, you have no way to know what muscles you should be focusing on. Many of the movements on this DVD did not cause any burn for me no matter how many repetitions I did. Just seemed like I was doing ""wrinkle repetitions"".

2) Nearly all of the exercises as performed on this program will deepen your wrinkles, not fill them. Yes, your face will likely get stronger, but these movements will deepen wrinkles at critical areas such as around the mouth/lips and eyes/forehead. Seriously, do these exercises in front of a mirror so you can see how you wrinkle up.

2) There is no way to gauge the long term benefits of these exercises as the models are very young and beautiful. They do not speak, they just perform. They appear to have been hired for this video and that's it.
There is not before and after or older people to testify to this programs long term benefits or effectiveness.

3)Boring. Did I mention that this program is boring and repetitive? They try to compensate for it with multiple camera angles and various sets and models, but it doesn't help much.

Carol Maggio's program is heads above this one.",1216944000,23,1855,4.54954954954955

2571071,5,B000FKPEBK,"I am 61 years old. I previously bought another facersize tape and was unable to follow the instructions. The Facial Workout DVD has a more scientific approach and shows you individual exercises with examples of the muscles you are working out. Don't kid yourself, it is not easy figuring out how to access these muscles. At first it feels like you're doing nothing but after a few tries you get closer and closer to actually feeling where you should be working out. Then she has a full routine which is great, it only takes about 20 minutes and goes through it all quickly and efficiently, no extra gabbing or time wasting.

I have the usual jowls and hanging wattles, not terrible but not pretty. Several people have asked if I've lost weight, I haven't. It is all very subtle but I 100% believe in this. I do exercise my body but never thought I needed to exercise my face.

2571075,3,B000FKPEBK,"First of all I believe these exercizes are very good.  The problem I have is not with program - in fact I felt very toned after just one workout!  The problem is with the production of the video - there is way too much unecessary footage!  It is clearly meant however to be sort-of meditationally relaxing to the viewer, they get credit for that --- but after seeing the camera (slowly) pan past a facade of columns and into the ""meditation room"" where the model is poised on top of the meditation platform for the umpteenth time - I now know what that pan dial on my DVD remote control is good for! ;-)  Too much footage is also spent (completely wasted in fact) on the models poising empty-headed facial expressions - that no one really cares about (I'd have more fun reading some meant-for-teen publication like Seventeen).  I also will say of some of these exercizes - they can be hard to do without resisting the temptation to burst out laughing due to both the exercizes themselves and the expressions make by models while they are performing the exercizes. My issue htere is not that the models are young and beautiful - it's just there is way to much almost narcissistic focus on this dippy footage - it in fact borders on being insulting to the viewer.  Another issue is as you may have gleaned thus far - it is way too long which does not facilitate a once-daily routine - oh unless you wish to make yourself crazy.  My recommendation is to learn the exercizes cold and practice at your leasure - or perhaps supplement with a facial exercize DVD routine that is SHORTER (there is one put out (published) by Barnes and Noble - not quite as good but the neck exercizes are easier - also has facial massage which makes you feel really good :-)) ).  My routine - I do that video ( B&N DVD - accompanying book is good too and cheap) right before bed - I wish to supplement with exercizes from this DVD being reviewed here once I have them down pat - as the other video is much shorter and conducive/motivational to a routine.  NOTE though - I have not watched any of the other DVDs available at Amazon on facial exercize.",1206576000,19,2126,4.41687979539642

My face already feels worked out and uplifted.  I am sure I will see fantastic results from doing these exercises.  I look young for my age but want to keep my good looks up.  I believe that anyone who wants to preserve or improve themselves to a more youthful appearance will adore this video.  I will keep it by my beside and do the 20 Minutes Complete Facial Workout upon retiring each evening.  Boy, my face feel tingly and tight.  Great video, Tal!",1201305600,10,599,4.431192660550459
2571079,4,B000FKPEBK,"I'm using these exercises and find them both effective and easy to do.  The one thing missing with this DVD is a pdf file or insert with a listing of the exercises ..... I'd like to be able to keep a print out of the names of exercises/(or even better) a small diagram of each in my purse so that I could do them while I'm waiting, stopped at a light, taking a break from work etc.  Most often I try to use those spare here and there moments to get everything accomplished in the day.  I decided to try to make this list up myself but found it very time consuming and hard to get all the info while playing the DVD.  I'd love to be able to contact someone about supplying this list but don't know how to reach them.  Would love to be able to make this happen.",1198540800,6,759,4.0
2571080,4,B000FKPEBK,This is a very enjoyable and instructive CD.  Well done.  Especially for the young needing prevention.,1191196800,3,102,5.3125
2571081,5,B000FKPEBK,"Enjoyable, informative and educational (i.e., I can learn this)presentation.  Memorizable content.  Great attitude in models.",1190332800,4,125,7.266666666666667
2571082,2,B000FKPEBK,"Great idea using a muscular representation of an aging face! This video does demonstrate very well the effects, i.e. what occurs to the facial muscles as we age without some type of successful intervention to stop gravity and all of the associative muscles in each location. However, when trying the DVD I did not feel any resistence or lactic acid burn, both of which are necessary for firming and toning.

Also, initially the different cameras and angles were a novel way of presenting  these exercises. Quickly they became distracting and annoying, as well as appeared to greatly lengthen this video. This was much too long to be done each morning and evening.  It would probably result in my pulling my hair out! Ouch!!!

How believable is it to see young beautiful models who have very little age or wrinkles to demonstrate? That may be a draw for very young females, not for mature and intelligent women. On the other hand, it is much more convincing and validating to see first hand the creator of the program demonstrating her techniques, as Carole Maggio does in her books, videos and DVDs, as well as the CDs for home and car use! Not only do we see the creator of the exercise program, we are as well witnessing the successful result of someone in the second half of her century and, `we get it'! Carole Maggio looks great at this age BECAUSE of her program. Innovation comes from experience!!! She has been doing and perfecting her technique for over 20 years! She doesn't just talk - she walks the talk!

I am always on the lookout for natural programs. However, this appears to be missing the target population. I have definitely achieved muscular definition and toning, as well as I now possess a radiance that can only be achieved by increased blood circulation to my face - which Carole Maggio's complete program delivers! I have learned a new and lifelong skill! Check out the June issue of More Magazine, a national magazine for women over 40, to see the outcome of Carole Maggio's Facercise program. I'm the oldest one, 56 years young, however that is only obvious by my driver's license! Since doing her program I am given more, no pun intended, compliments than ever in my life. In fact, I have never felt more beautiful!!!",1181520000,45,2245,4.702290076335878
