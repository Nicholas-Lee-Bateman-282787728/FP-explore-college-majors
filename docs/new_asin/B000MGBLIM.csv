2734873,3,B000MGBLIM,"I stopped watching it after the most stupid beginning where a German patrol boat is firing with a heavy machine gun at one guy on a non-moving boat.  They miss, but the one guy on a non-moving boat shoots a few Germans on the patrol boat patrol which is moving very fast.  Okay.  Idiotic.",1409875200,,288,4.296296296296297

2734875,5,B000MGBLIM,"Singer Robert Goulet plays a James Bond clone secret agent, with the usual gadgets and girls. The novelty here is that he is an American spy inside Nazi Germany, where he and his beautiful female partner (Christine Carere) are never more than a misstep away from exposure, torture, and death. This is understandably more somber than most secret agent films. It portrays the terrible choices which must sometimes be made by those who fight evil, as well as the conflicts experienced by decent Germans who came to realize that they were on the evil side.

The movie was filmed in postwar Germany with a mostly German cast, which gives it a greater atmosphere of reality. The drawback is that it consists of only a few episodes of an early 1960's TV series called Blue Light, and ends in the middle of the story, leaving the viewer wondering what happened next. Unfortunately, the complete series is not available. I would certainly purchase it if it was. As it is, I highly recommend this movie to both secret agent and World War II fans.",1406246400,4,1036,4.6923076923076925
2734876,4,B000MGBLIM,"I am a huge fan of Robert Goulet.  He is my favorite male singer and I always have enjoyed his performances in the great American musicals.  Also he has a very ability to do comedy as his appearances on the Lucy Show demonstrate.  I Deal in Danger was filmed in black and white.  Robert Goulet was very good as an undercover USA agent who was involved in trying to derail the horrible plans of Hitler and his Nazi regime.  This was a dark story with a mixed ending, partially happy, partially unhappy.  As someone who was a small child during the World II period, it outlined much of what went on during that time.",1401840000,,614,4.342105263157895
2734877,4,B000MGBLIM,"I found out about this DVD from an internet search on 1960's TV series. I was looking for the Robert Goulet series ""Blue Light."" This movie is a compilation of some of the episodes. I had liked the series and was sorry it only ran for 1 season. I enjoyed this very much.",1392508800,,270,4.113207547169812
2734878,5,B000MGBLIM,"This is good movie starring Robert Goulet, as a spy who is trying to sabotage an underground Nazi factory. This movie is presented in color, Full frame formant and runs for about 90mins (1hr 30mins). This movie also stars: Christine Carre, Donald Harron, Horst Frank, Werner Peters, plus others! Overall this is a good War movie and I would recommend it.",1359590400,3,354,4.819672131147541
2734879,5,B000MGBLIM,"I loved the series ""Blue L:ight""  searched so long for the movie.  great buy...good story.  A series Robert Goulet played well in.",1357862400,,130,4.818181818181818
2734880,5,B000MGBLIM,"Blue Light was a TV series done in the 60's when other shows about WWII were pretty common, 'Combat', '12 o'clock High' etc. Starring the singer Robert Goulet of all things, I remember this show fondly as a kid and was skeptical purchasing this DVD but its great! The story is about a dbl-agent,(Goulet), who infiltrates the German missle program with plans to sabbotage it. The 'plot' is similar in theme to the very good WWII flim ""Operation Crossbow"" starring George Peppard and Sophia Loren in a small role. 'I Deal in Danger' moves a bit slowly by todays movies standards, but its well done, has decent action scenes, and a fair amount of suspense. But really, the best thing in this film is Robert Goulet which I would never have expected. He's tough and serious and believable as a guy risking his life for his Country and really wanting to take down Germany. If your over 50 and grew up with WWII TV shows like this, you will love this TV/Movie from that era.",1336089600,9,967,4.531428571428571
8168969,4,B000MGBLIM,"I understand that this movie represents a compilation of four (?) episodes from the Blue Light TV series. The result is a very entertaining , slightly over 90 minutes WW II  espionage actioneer , competently edited for maximum thrills. The only drawback is, little time for character development,  but then who knows how much of that was inherent in the series.  I remember watching this very short -run TV series with my dad, some 52 years ago (!),  and I only remembered the ""Blue Light"" title.  Now thanks to 20th Century Fox for releasing this, I can see why I enjoyed it as an awestruck 12-year-old back in the day!  The drama, writing and production values in the series is excellent, and reminds me why TV was so good back then, before there was any of these so-called ""reality shows"".",1523750400,,792,4.621428571428571
8168970,4,B000MGBLIM,It was 1966 tv stuff but still very entertaining.  Robert Goulet was just so incredibly handsome. His acting wasn't too bad either...lol,1515196800,,136,5.181818181818182
8168971,4,B000MGBLIM,"Fun but formulaic made-for-TV WW2 movie with Goulet as a WW2 James Bond prototype spy pretending to be Nazi collaborator while actually working for the Allies. VERY well-made for a TV move. Almost wouldn't know it was made for TV.

Production values are excellent. Much of it looks like it was shot in Europe. Sets are elaborate & authentic-looking. Cast & acting are far above average as well, especially Goulet, who elevates the decent, plausible script above the genre. Goulet is a natural actor & it's a shame he didn't do more films. He definitely has all the tools, including his incredible voice, which made at least a zillion women swoon in the '60s. The direction & photography are more than adequate and the score is suitably suspenseful & evocative.

Don't misunderstand, this is a WW2 spy genre movie, no more. But it is nice to look at, the story moves right along & Goulet saves the day. All in all, a good way to spend an evening. Definitely worth watching again some rainy afternoon.",1506384000,,999,4.702857142857143

8168974,3,B000MGBLIM,"I Deal in Danger, 1966 film

It begins in Occupied Holland. A boat in the sea is shot and destroyed. Elsewhere a guard is silenced and a fire bomb is planted! The SS will search the guests in this house. David March, the American, will be told why America cant win the war. SS agent Ulm suspects March of being a double agent and wants him killed. Another American wants to join the Nazis and bring secret documents on air defenses. The travel on a train when an RAF plane attacks! March meets Spalding, an old friend and a double agent, who tells him the plans: denounce him and shoot him! This will provide March with great bonafides. But the SS man wants to question Spalding by using a truth serum drug. There is drama in the confrontation. There is an attack by British agents and they flee. There is more shooting, men die. March arrives in Berlin to answer questions. Ulm was taken prisoner by the British, he was the last member of Blue Light, a spy ring. March will be sent to a top-secret location.

March insults a Frenchwoman about her executed father! She sends a message to the British. March goes to Grossmunchen with Suzanne. That secret weapon is a missile that can be launched from a submarine to attack Allied shipping, then later American cities. But there is more intrigue. One spy will spy on another spy! What can go wrong? There are scenes to pad out the story. [Night scenes cut down on costs needed to recreate daytime scenes.] Can a disguised March rescue a prisoner? An alarm sounds! But March succeeds. Professor Eckert has changed his mind! An open window provides an exit. The SS investigates. Can Eckerts daughter destroy the secret factory? Professor Hoffmann has doubts. Visitors are thoroughly searched. March begins his sabotage. Gretchen is detained as a suspect. She says something will happen! The alarm sounds, there is shooting! Rockets are launched to destroy the secret factory; there are explosions and fires. There is no need to worry about Grossmunchen.

This is an interesting movie made in Europe with one American actor. It is a lower budget production (the lack of outdoor daylight scenes).",1458950400,,2140,4.7319034852546915
