7985082,4,B00008K793,"***1/2 1974. Directed by Michel Deville. A petty bank clerk (Trintignant), is turned into a social climber under the guidance of a Machiavellian writer (Cassel). I really enjoyed this tale about a modern Rastignac who uses women to achieve power and wealth. Michel Deville is certainly a director worth your attention who deserves to be rediscovered while he's still working and alive.",1196812800,5,385,5.225806451612903
7985083,4,B00008K793,"Beatifuls girls (Schneider, Jane Birkin) in a plot that seems like a hollywood one, but much more honest, and funny, as dreamlike.

The US version of this film could be ""Risky bussiness"", film that i just can' bear.

Extremely recommended to everyone who not like Cameron Crowe.",1099958400,3,278,4.8936170212765955
7985084,1,B00008K793,"Romy Schneider , my favorite star and Jean -Louis Tritignant of 'A man and a woman"" wasted on an extremely poor script. Jane Birkin always delightful , here almost comical in a serious role. One good line "" Nobody dies anymore except in a comedy""could not save this flick anymore.",1099699200,,280,4.62
