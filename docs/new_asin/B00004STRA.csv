1348650,2,B00004STRA,"To start with, it was NOT 100% accurate. The film drags too much, which makes it boring. Plus, the story ends after Audrey Hepburn finishes 'Breakfast at Tiffany's', and then they show a few precious seconds of  Audrey helping in the UNICEF. Frances Fisher is effective and admirable as  Ella Hepburn, Audrey's mother. Peter Giles and Eric M. were also  well-casted for James Hanson(Audrey's ex-fiancee) and Mel Ferrer(Audrey's  first husband). Pretty much everyone else is satisfying too, except for  Jennifer Love Hewwit and Emmy Rossum. I admit that Jennifer Love H. has a  somewhat resemblance to Audrey Hepburn, but she was too young and didn't  have enough experience and enough 'glamour' to portray the world's greatest  actress, despite the fact that she tried very hard. Emmy Rossum played a  teenaged Audrey Hepburn and failed miserably. (By the way, Audrey Hepburn  is one of my all-time fav. actresses. I except she's one of yours too.

1348651,1,B00004STRA,"If you are looking for the Audrey Hepburn Story, then this is most definately not the place.  While the film is whimsical and pretty to look at, a documentary film or biography on the late actress would be far more  capable of telling the story.  The title role was horribly miscast, and  while Ms. Hewitt tries very hard, she lacks the age, grace and wisdom to  conquer such a role.  I was very dissapointed in the picture, especially at  the fact that they dedicated three hours to such a small portion of Audrey  Hepburn's life and only ten seconds to her work with UNICEF (the best ten  seconds of the film).  While Hewitt fans are sure to enjoy her in a role  that was very obviously tailored for her, I urge people in search of the  ""real"" Audrey Hepburn to look elsewhere.",955411200,6,779,4.408450704225352
1348652,4,B00004STRA,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. This is probably the single hardest job an actress would take on. I belive that people are expecting to see the actual Audrey Hepburn. That is not going to happen. Mrs Hepburn is regarded  as the best actress of all time, and to think that Jennifer Love Hewitt can  have the same performance is not logical. But Ms Hewitt does a wonderful  job of capturing the charm and grace of Hepburn in a way I don't believe  that any other young actress could do. Who else could pull off this part?  In my opinion, no one else has even close to any resemblence to Hepburn  compared to Hewitt. I believe this was a wonderful film and it made me even  more interested in some of the classical Hepburn movies that I have not  previously seen. Give credit to Hewitt for tackling such a hard film and  pulling it off. A job well done.",955324800,9,851,4.3354430379746836
1348653,1,B00004STRA,"I could not get passed the fact during the whole movie that it was Love Hewitt ACTING as Audrey.  I did not get into the role at all.  The accent was off and everything.  I spent the whole 3 hours sitting there not  watching the movie, but only pressing pause during the commercial; thinking  I might actually want to watch it later.

This TV biopic was built around Jennifer Love Hewitt, not Audrey Hepburn.  Technically speaking, it's innacurate and skips over many important  milestones in her life, and totally omitted her life beyond Breakfast at  Tiffany's! For a good watch, try the A&E biography. At least it's  accurate, and shows actual pictures of Audrey. This biopic crams all  5'2"" of Jennifer's busty little self into replicas of Audrey's  stunning and world-famous costumes, just so she (JLH) can over-reenact  Roman Holiday and Breakfast at Tiffany's, probably the only two Hepburn  films she bothered to watch before casting herself in this $7 million  budget stinker.

1348661,3,B00004STRA,"Audrey Hepburn has been celebrated as one of the most famous actresses of the 1950s and 1960s, along with Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, Ava Gardner, Kim Novak, Doris Day, Natalie Wood, etc., however, I do believe HBO could've done a bit better by this famous and good-acting beauty! Jennifer Love Hewitt, who plays Miss Hepburn, resembles her somewhat, yet I do believe her acting could've been a bit better. The main thing I do not like about this film biography is that it doesn't contain ALL of Miss Hepburn's life. It starts with her on the set of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" (1961) and then goes back and forth through her past and up through her early life, her beginning years in show business, and her breakthrough as a Hollywood mega-star. However, the film doesn't go passed 1961. At the end, the film is still set on the ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" set in 1961, and doesn't even show her later life, her social activism, and her death. It does, however, mention her films after 1961 and her death, but this it! THAT'S NOT ENOUGH!!!!! The feature spends WAY TOO MUCH TIME (in my opinion) on her early life. Don't get me wrong, it is interesting about Hepburn's early life, but her Hollywood limelight career is MORE INTERESTING and MORE BELIEVABLE!!!! If you are a HUGH Hepburn fan, I suggest you search for bigger and better Biographies on her, but if you are just interested in learner more about her, I believe this could be a good piece of Hepburn-inspired to see.",1344556800,,1476,4.680769230769231

1348663,5,B00004STRA,"No one is like Audrey Hepburn; we know that.  But Jennifer Love Hewitt does as good a job of presenting her as I think could be expected.  Having been a fan of Audrey from the 60s and JLH for the last year since I stumbled on ""Ghost Whisperer"", like everyone I had doubts she could have pulled off presenting the essence of Audrey H on screen, but I was wrong.  She did a great job, and I found the movie a delight to watch.  I ran some of it A/B vs. the real ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" and was impressed how much closer JLH was to the persona presented by Audrey on screen than the location managers were in presenting New York. Another reviewer said that Audrey's son approved of the job done in this movie, and I can see why.  If he approves of JLH's version of Audrey's life, it would seem Ms. Hewitt must have done a pretty good job.  Anyway, I knew the general picture of Ms. Hepburn's life, but nothing like the detail presented in this film.

I commend Jennifer Love Hewitt on her performance and thank her for reacquinting me with Audrey.  I've recently ordered 8 of the classic Hepburn movies so that I might truly experience the beautiful actress and fascinating culture of her days (and, later, mine).

JLH looks NOTHING like Miss Hepburn so I don't konw why she was given that part. She does not have the elegance or the grace of Miss Hepburn, and she did this head shaking thing waay too much.

I love seeing Miss Hewitt and Miss Hepburn in other venues.  I can not think of one lady without thinking of the other.  For me, Miss Hewitt BECAME Miss Hepburn!

1348672,2,B00004STRA,"I wondered when I watched this movie why anyone who had the reckless incomprehensible desire to produce a biopic on Audrey Hepburn would have cast Jennifer Love Hewitt in the role.  Then I saw that she was the producer.

If I were trying to be ugly, I'd say that Ms. Hewitt's portrayal amounts to a cheap knockoff of the completely unique Audrey, but that's not really true.  It was more like one of those expensive Hollywood star dolls put out by The Franklin Mint. The clothes and pose are close but the indefinable essence is missing particularly from the face, which is vacant and doll-like bearing little resemblance to the real thing.

This movie had one of Audrey Hepburn's swains say something like, ""Just let us look at you.""  And it was true that Audrey Hepburn was something to look at, but the most vital part of her considerable charm was the fact that she was looking back, engaged, interested, fearless, which is why she did well as characters with questing spirits like Holly Golightly, and like Sister Luke and even Princess Ann.  She made you feel the absolute need she had to connect with the world and other people.

Ms. Hewitt would have done well to try and capture that essence rather than busy herself with copying the Hepburn mannerisms and accent rather poorly.  The one time she comes close to the spirit that was Audrey Hepburn is in the scene where an older actress is trying to help her line readings for the part of Gigi on Broadway.  For one brief, all too brief moment you felt the character's eagerness to learn, her satisfaction and joy at having mastered something difficult.  And I thought, ""Yes, it could have happened like that.""

I don't know who directed Ms. Hewitt, but she was not well served.  Too bad.",1174953600,4,1746,4.633116883116883
1348673,4,B00004STRA,"I must whole-heartedly disagree with the editorial review in my assessment of this film. I have never been a fan of Jennifer Love Hewitt--in fact, her performances usually annoy me. Her portrayal of Audrey hepburn, however, blew me out of the water. Her ablity to capture the eligance, delicate strength, and beauty of Hepburn is nothing less than brilliant. And please, Natalie Portman for this role? She killed the newest Star Wars movies. I was completely surpised and delighted by Hewitt's portrayal, and with the film overall.",1164844800,2,531,5.114942528735632
1348674,5,B00004STRA,"This movie shows an intimate portrayal into Audrey Hepburn's life and may appeal more to those who enjoy fiction rather than those who are highly critical concerning the exact details of Audrey Hepburn's life. I would guess if you enjoy mainstream romance then you'd enjoy this story, because it has a bit of everything... and of course regardless of whether romance was in the movie there would still be a story there.

Those who are really specific about every detail of Audrey Hepburn's life will probably be disappointed. Die-hard Hepburn fans will probably walk away with more to dislike than to like. Although, I personally think Hepburn was a fairly good actress, I would have to personally say that Jennifer Love Hewitt sparkled as Hepburn more than I ever personally felt concerning the real Hepburn herself. I think what Hewitt and Hepburn really share in common is that they are both very adorable women. They both sparkled in their own way.

I don't personally agree with others who say they didn't look anything alike. I don't think they had huge resemblances but I do think they do resemble each other in less obvious ways. After seeing Hewitt in the film, I didn't think her acting was bad at all (as said by other reviewers)--personally after seeing the film, I felt that if she took more adult roles her talent would be much better appreciated.

I think that Hewitt may receive some harsh reviews because a lot of people are simply used to seeing her in less mature movies, but I think if she were to portray more adult roles as in this film, she would eventually earn the respect she deserves. I think many teen movies underplay her talent to be honest.

Other reviewers have said Natalie Portman would've been a better choice. I'm not sure I agree. Natalie Portman is talented and I can see resemblances to Hepburn, but I think Hewitt has a magic and charm that Portman doesn't have quite the same way.

Hewitt comes alive beyond the film and you really believe she's Hepburn. However, die-hard fans may not be convinced that she is, but those who are less critical will probably enjoy the film and enjoy her portrayal.

I think they did make the right choice to cast Jennifer Love Hewitt. Jennifer Love Hewitt is the type of person that you can look at and really tell she's alive and she just has an energy that bounces off the walls. I think they casted her as Audrey because she had the same energy and magic that Audrey has (inner magnetism). I believe they saw that.

I don't think you have to look exactly like Audrey to pretend to be her. Other reviewers have questioned why she was casted because she didn't look like Audrey, but clearly there are countless movies in which actors/actresses didn't look exactly like the real people, but they were casted as the character for other reasons and perhaps they resembled the character at least a little. I think reviewers are having trouble with this simply because Audrey Hepburn was famous.

""Erin Brockovich"" is a good example. Julia Roberts didn't look anything like ""Erin Brockovich,"" but she was cast as her. And Diane Lane who plays Frances Mayes in ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" doesn't look a thing like the real writer (Frances Mayes). Looks don't mean believability. It doesn't mean just because an actor/actress looks like that person they should be casted to play that part. It helps but it's not always enough. It also doesn't mean because the person looks like that real person you'll necessarily believe they are that person, and it doesn't mean because they don't look like that person that you'll believe they aren't that person. That's why it's called acting. A large portion of it is a matter of illusion.

I personally think Jennifer Love Hewitt created a very good illusion as Audrey Hepburn.",1153612800,5,3780,4.741248097412481

1348676,5,B00004STRA,Both Jennifer Love Hewitt (Grown Audrey Hepburn) and Emmy Rossum (Teen Audrey Hepurn - Also in Phantom of the Opera movie) made wonderful productions of the life of Audrey.  They both brought life to a woman that many of us new only as a celebrity.  This is the best movie on a real person's life that helps you connect with the real person.  If you are interested on her life as a child up to the time of her death then this movie is for you.

1348677,4,B00004STRA,"I saw this bio-pic when it came on tv a few years ago and being a long-time Audrey Hepburn fan, I was skeptical.  I have to say setting aside Hewitt's unfortunate attempt at Hepburn's accent and less than realistic acting, the film at least delved into lesser known areas of her life such as her early hopes of being a ballerina, her time during the war, and her very early career.  Yes, the film stops at ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" arguable her most famous role, leaving my favorites untouched (My Fair Lady most notably).  However, it does show how she was inspired to start working with humanitarian efforts, eventually leaving acting to work tirelessly with UNICEF.

[I would have to say, Emmy Rossum (the actress who portrayed Audrey from 12 - 16) was by far a better actress than JLH.  I saw her in Day After Tommorrow and it took me a while to figure out where I had seen her before and then realized it was from this movie.  Now, her career seems to have taken off with the Phantom of the Opera movie.]

1348678,4,B00004STRA,"Jennifer Love Hewitt is clearly not Audrey Hepburn, she doesn't even come close, but, I will concede that she did a great job at producing and starring in this made-for-TV-movie. It takes us from Audrey's childhood all the way to one of her many defining moments - the filming of Breakfast At Tiffany's.

It really is a pleasant film to watch. Although the script can be slow at times, I feel that it honors Audrey's memory. Even her son approved of this biography.

Ultimately, I'd like to say to those who bash Ms. Hewitt for starring in this bio-pic, I'm glad that she used the fame she has to introduce Audrey to a younger audience that possibly would have never learned about her otherwise.

I give this movie four stars because of Emmy Rossum's incredible talents. I wish her and Ms. Hewitt many more successes.",1124064000,11,817,4.620689655172414

Biopics are difficult to make well because of the problem of selection of material, and the consequent risk of portraying characters in insufficient detail (like Hepburn's father). Even this however illustrates that she hardly knew him.

1348682,3,B00004STRA,"Though IMDb.com raised the sort of factual issues that Hepburn fans would have been expected to have known about, the tenor of this biopic is generally warm.  The daughter of a baroness, Hepburn's family is reduced to refugee status by the end of WWII, her father missing and presumed dead.  Though living below their station, the Hepburn's are generally sunny about their existence.  Audrey makes friends easily, but is a failure as a ballerina.  She can't sing or dance, and when she gets her first major gig as Gigi, she can't even act.  By then, the script settles on Hepburn's charm as her greatest asset.  Never having seen Hepburn act, Collette is nevertheless sold on her stage presence.  Actors and directors fawn over her, none knowing of her insecurities or a desire for a future involving a stable family life.  Though her star rises further, Hepburn struggles to find that sense of security - eluding her in various misfired or purposelessly sabotaged romances (including one with James Hansen, heir to a fortune and founder of Hansen PLC; also William Holden from ""Sabrina"").  She turns typically to her mother, who happily enough is a supportive parent - aren't parents normally saddled with the blame in these biopics?  Famous names and faces cross Audrey's path, but the story makes her the center of attention everywhere - it seems that there's nobody who can resist her charm.  The story climaxes with the ""Hollywood Ending"" final scene of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", hinting to us that Hepburn finally found her emotional center.  (The story doesn't go as far as having an older Hepburn star as the elderly Maid Marian, mourning with Sean Connery over their lost love; nor must we endure Love Hewitt grappling in the dark with Alan Arkin from ""Wait until dark"".)

Love Hewitt manages to sound a lot like Hepburn, but her likeness seems as plagued as those of the other celebrity stand-ins.  The makers of this biopic seem painfully aware of how delicate the likenesses are, and they do little to shake up their characters for fear of threatening the resemblance too much.  Hewitt's mannerisms seem unconsciously jerky - unlike Hepburn's grace.  It's not quite a cutting bio; though perhaps Hepburn doesn't deserve that treatment, a better tribute may just be to kick back with one of her movies.  My favorite?  ""Scharade"".",1100563200,3,2340,4.9411764705882355

Though they had many items from Audrey's history, they seemed to be missing the most important ones, and getting some other facts wrong.  I think what happened was that the author of the script was doing a wonderful job, but then got to 2 hours and realized he couldn't make it any longer, so he just added the finishing touches and cut out a lot from her history.
JLH did have brown hair and brown eyes and was quite skinny, but Audrey was so much thinner. JLH had a very different ""body structure""than Audrey did.  Also, JLH, if you cannot do a good accent, don't try.
I liked the movie, all in all.  But....they didn't put enough emphasis on what she thought was probably her greatest accomplishment, her humanitarian work.  They ended in the middle of Audrey's career and just did a small blip on her humanitarian work.  Whatever happened to the rest of her movies?  I can't wait until someone has enough money to make a movie that goes throughout her life and does it accurately from start to finish.  Though it might be four hours, there are people like me who wouldn't care, as long as it was accurate and all there.

You do not have to be an Audrey Hepburn fan to enjoy this movie! It is just a film that can be enjoyed by anyone. The acting in this film is wonderful, especially Jennifer Love Hewitt. She does an amazing job here, and I am a huge fan of hers. The other actresses that play young Audrey are great as well. The actress that plays Audrey's mom is one of the best (she also played Rose's mom in Titanic). Eric McCormack (from Will and Grace) also appears here, and does a fine job. This film has many different elements to it that make it what it is. You go through the happy moments with Audrey, and it makes you happy, but then there are the sad moments that make you sad!

A lot of people (including me) thought Audrey slaughtered the film version of My Fair Lady. Personally, I forgave Audrey for that error long ago. Is this movie her payback?
Jennifer, get over your self. Your a horrid actress. I cannot believe you have gotten as far as you have in your career. I never thought anyone could miscast THEMSELVES.
Since JLH played Audrey, here's some suggestions for future movies about legendary actresses...
Starr Jones as Bette Davis
Cindy Crawford as Katherine Hepburn
Rosanne as Marlene Dietrich
Bea Arthur as Marilyn Monroe
Elizabeth Berkley as Ethel Merman
Tori Spelling as Judy Garland
If JLH can play Audrey, then my list is very plausable.",1019433600,8,714,5.008403361344538

JLH's casting of (surprise, surprise) herself as Audrey Hepburn is, believe it or not, a new lowpoint in made-for-tv movies.  Her only physical similarities are brown hair and eyes.  She is too short and busty to play the 5'7"" waif-like Audrey.  It was more like dress-up playtime for JLH than any serious attempt at portraying any truths about Hepburn.  Her accent was inconsistant and nothing like Audrey Hepburn's smooth and enchanting voice.  She was the opposite of graceful, poised, and captivating.  Her acting was more suited for a high-school drama club play than a movie about such an amazing woman.  This was poorly acted, poorly casted, poorly written, poorly directed, and so very inaccurate!

I've watched all of Audrey Hepburn's films as well as researched many of her biographies, and believe Jennifer Love Hewitt did a poor job in portraying the hollywood legend.  The movie wasn't grounded, it didn't have a good feel to it, they didn't contribute a lot of the things that was most important to Audrey...except to show the rise of fame.  The other actors portraying other characters in the hollywood era looked nothing like the characters themselves-including Jennifer Love Hewitt portraying Audrey Hepburn.  Jennifer Love Hewitt's look is of no resemblance to the beautiful Audrey Hepburn.  If not for the hair from the Breakfast at Tiffany's set-they might as well have had Whoopi Goldberg portraying Audrey Hepburn.  I was VERY disappointed in spending $ on this film.  Not worth owning.  To satisfy the curiosity of movie goers, worth a view for half the movie-I'd bunk the rest.  In my opinion, it was a ludricous portrayal of the beautiful, classic legend.  To what honor shall Jennifer Love Hewitt have portraying the legend?  An unknown actress would have suited more than she.  She's too bubbly-and her own usual character shows through too much to make her Audrey Hepburn impersonation fall through.  She brings in too much of her ""own"" look and smile to Audrey's, the classic smile she poses for every one of her films.  Not genuine.  Not believable AT ALL.",1015286400,12,1539,4.95703125

Audrey Hepburn was an amazing person. The story was very surprising to me because I had no idea she grew up around the war and without a father. If you've only seen her movies and have no clue what her life was really like, this movie will be interesting to you. Of course, if you're looking for a movie on Audrey Hepburn, portraying her life with meticulous detail and accuracy there's always a possibility that you'll be disappointed. I don't know that much about her so I can't say that the movie was perfectly correct or inaccurate. I would still say that is worth a try though.  This movie is based on her life so it's main purpose was to tell her story rather than create a plot that would entertain the viewers.

And certainly not Jennifer Anniston, who looks nothing like Audrey Hepburn anyway. But Jennifer Love Hewitt is the one that could do it, and surprisingly well as I'd never expect from a Jennifer. Reinforces her as the best actress among Jennifers. Audrey was definitely the underrated of the two Hepburn actresses, who I always thought were related, since their name is uncommon, until someone told me they weren't. I'm Happy Jennifer Love Hewitt has the stuff after all to give this sweet and loving tribute. It made me cry, almost as much as when Audrey died.",1012089600,4,731,4.903225806451613

It would take a very special person to play such an extroadinary person like Audrey Hepburn. Actually I think they should have found an unknown that would have brought a fresh look into the the life of Audrey Hepburn.  Even the character that played Capote didn't convince me. I felt the movie as a whole looked as though it was thrown together which made me bored with the whole process. I felt nothing.

The Audrey Hepburn Story is an average-and-a-bit film that occasionally frames Hepburn as a bit of a ..., but a likeable one. The TV-movie is a little over-long, but it spends a nice time telling the world what it must have been like through Hepburn's eyes. Jennifer Love Hewitt is good, although she does not have quite the touch to portray a brilliant performance. Better ones come from Frances Fisher as Hepburn's mother and a young actress called Emily Rossum who movingly plays Audrey from 14-16. The script has some really intriguing moments and a touching back-story. But, in the long shot, the film really misses greatness when it flaws itself deeply at the end. Nice work, but misses the mark sometimes.",990144000,3,829,4.724137931034483
1348698,1,B00004STRA,"Jennifer Love Hewitt certainly has a lot of courage to take on a role that she had to know would bring her more criticism than acclaim. Or she just isn't that bright. It is sure to be the greatest mistake of her career. It is noticeable how much effort she puts into portraying Audrey, but she does it void of emotion. And as if Audrey Hepburn was only a paperdoll. Not a woman with a real story to tell.
Audrey Hepburn was admired for much more than her looks and talents. She was a woman who suffered and survived many things! She was courageous, intelligent, generous, the list goes on and on! Hewitt's performance reflects NONE of this. It takes more than doe eyes.
Hewitt needs to stick to fluffy teen movies and Neutrogena commercials until she matures as an actress. I did not find her looks or mannerisms to reflect Audrey's very much, but more because Hewitt was obviously trying so hard, it did not seem to come natural at all. Maybe if she wasn't such an obvious wanna-be and had relaxed, she would have done a better job?
Many people say, well *who* could have portrayed Audrey and my answer is (I am sure I will get flamed for saying this), I would have much rather seen Julia Ormond in this role. I know she wasn't supposed to be portraying AUDREY HEPBURN in her role as Sabrina (the remake with Harrison Ford), and  at the time her performance was so reminiscent of Audrey that it irritated me - BUT after seeing THIS horrible ""movie"" with JLH it made me appreciate Julia Ormond so much much more! I think she would have done a splendid job. Ormond really captures Audrey Hepburns softness and warmth of character and heart. Also, I agree with the previous review that suggested Natalie Portman. Perhaps Natalie Portman as a young Audrey Hepburn and Julia Ormond as a mature Audrey Hepburn? Can we please reshoot this film?
Jennifer Love Hewitt showed us her stuggle which was a distraction to the story. Poorly produced and researched as well - you miss out on so much. You are much better off buying the A&E Biography tape (much better than the Hollywood Collection, Audrey Remembered) and reading Alexander Walker's biography on Audrey Hepburn.
It would have been refreshing and enjoyable to see a story based on Audrey Hepburns life, not documentary style and maybe some day we will. However, this movie is not worth the buy and not worth the watch, unless you are curious to see just how bad a job Hewitt did. I'm really not trying to just slam JLH, I happened to like her on Party of Five.",977184000,7,2510,4.540838852097131

But then, what do you expect from the co-executive producer who just happened to cast herself in the lead?  Hewitt makes no secret that she's an Audrey wanna-be, and this movie just shows how hard she'll try (and how much money she'll spend) to be Audrey.

 I agree 100% with the reviewer that mentioned she would have rather seen a ""documentary style special.""  So much of the 'Audrey Hepburn Story' is not even accurate and I think its a shame!

Well, first  of all, she lived until she was 63, she divorced Mel Ferrer, got remarried  and divorced, and ""shacked up"" with another man for the final 13  years of her life.  She struggled to have a child.  Her 2nd husband was  unfaithful.  She had little contact with her father.  She didn't do much of  the singing in ""My Fair Lady.""  She suffered during the 2nd World  War.  This movie, if it was REALLY telling the TRUE  Audrey Hepburn story,  would have chronicled all this in greater detail.  Yes, Hepburn was a great  actress who became a cherished icon.  Yes, she was a fine human being whose  tireless work for UNICEF brought her much praise and attention to the  forgotten children of this world, but she was a human being too with  struggles not unlike what we ""mere mortals"" have to endure.

After all, how could someone have the temerity to attempt to  portray Audrey Hepburn, one of the ethereal luminaries of the screen.  I  fell in love with Audrey Hepburn when I was 12 years old and saw her in  Sabrina in 1954; I remained in love with her for the rest of her life.  Consequently, I doubted that any mere mortal could do justice to this role,  especially Jennifer Love Hewitt, who had not be known for major dramatic  performances.  However, I must concede that I was pleasantly  surprised.
The performance was quite convincing and believable.  Hewitt  had Audrey Hepburn's voice and a number of her mannerisms down quite well,  and also conveyed some of the fragility of her personality.  On balance, I  found the film quite satisfying and enjoyable.",966384000,24,842,4.710344827586207

1348705,2,B00004STRA,"What an awful movie. Audrey Hepburn can never be portrayed well enough by one actress today in a movie. There are many actresses that hold some of her qualities, but never all of them. Certainly not Jennifer Love  Hewitt.
Speaking of the ""leading lady"", it's a sad tale about how she won  the role of Audrey in this film. You see, the young actress fancies herself  to be an Audrey for the ages, but even she knows it's not true, so she  bought the rights to the movie, produced it and cast herself as Audrey. She  is no Audrey Hepburn.
Where Audrey always was always so unsure of her  looks, Hewitt takes the `character' and makes her devoid of that emotion.  Other qualities of Audrey lack as well. Hewitt should stick with those TV  series for FOX; although they'll still fail, they won't be as bad as this  movie.
Another alteration for Hewitt's casting was the  flashback-from-Breakfast-At-Tiffany's situation. That stunt painted over  some of her finest work, including the fabulous `Wait Until Dark' and  tosses it into a small paragraph at the end.
You may think I am being a  harsh judge, but worse criticisms have been uttered. Audrey Hepburn, quite  possibly the greatest actress to ever work in Hollywood, should never be  handled with such, for lack of a btter word, stupidity. This movie handles  her with just that.",964224000,17,1330,4.717391304347826

Oh where to  begin? The casting was beyond reproach, I do go on the record right now as  saying that Miss Hewitt made a valiant ""attempt"", but failed  miserably.
Nobody with any sense of who and what the real Audrey Hepburn  was could sit through this debacle without becoming ill. The characters (I  use that word, because any passing resemblance to William Holden, Bogart,  Mel Ferrer,Kay Kendall, Billy Wilder , William Wyler, Truman Capote, etc is  so pale and insulting, that all that is left is a ""character""  type, not a real person) all react to this fictional Audrey as if she is  eminating the most extraordinary Star Quality, but WE NEVER SEE IT!
Miss  Hewitt is hopelessly unable to generate any lustre or vivacity as Hepburn.  The dates are screwed up, the design elements are amateurish, the faux  costumes draped on Miss Hewitt make her look like a five year old playing  dress up in a drag queen's closet, and the attempts at recreating scenes  from Roman Holiday, Breakfast at Tiffany's et al are so pathetic they don't  even merit examination.
STAY AWAY FROM THIS TRIPE!! If you are an Audrey  fan, you will be scandalized, if you know nothing of Audrey, go rent some  of her movies, this one will teach you NOTHING about her.
This has to  rank up there with previous horrible choices like Cheryl Ladd portraying  Grace Kelly, or Lynda Carter failing miserably at portraying Rita Hayworth.  If you want a good or at least decent recreation of old Hollywood stick to  movies like Chaplin (flawed, but at least a good performance by Robert  Downey Jr.), or even Marilyn with the Emmy nominated turn by Catherine  Hicks (who gets most of it right), or heck, even Ann Jillian as Mae West  (gutsy attempt).

Hewitt pulled of the part as well as anyone possibly could and that's a  huge compliment considering her subject.  She looked stunning in the roll.  I'll admit that her accent wasn't dead on, but it passed well.  If nothing  else, she captured the fun that was attributed to Audrey.
Quite a few  people have critisized the movie and her roll.  I honestly feel that the  reason for this is because they're so used to watching Audrey that they  expect that someone portraying her can be as charming, elegant, and  beautiful as Audrey herself.

However, this would go for any actoress who dares portray  Hepburn.  The fact that Love Hewitt is a ""teen-sensation"" is not  exactly helpful to the reputation.  However, there are a slew of ideas  people must keep in mind.
  #1 To be fair to Hewitt, anyone who tried  to portray Hepburn would receive bad reviews.
  #2 The movie wishes to  portray Audrey Hepburn's life.  I am much younger than most people are and  obviously Hepburn was before my time.  However, I feel exposure of such  classics is very important.  If this special can accomplish that, whether  or not it's ""perfect"" is trivial in comparrison to the attention  it can bring to Hepburn and her revival.
  #3 In regards to accuracy,  although it is important, we must view it with the mindset that this is  Hollywood and sometimes things are changed for different reasons.
  #4  Although there are many other ideas necessary to keep in mind, ultimately,  viewers must watch this movie with an open-mind.  The movie as a whole is a  touching and moving movie--but not Hepburn.  The movie, in and of itself is  a good movie and you'll see what you want to see.
