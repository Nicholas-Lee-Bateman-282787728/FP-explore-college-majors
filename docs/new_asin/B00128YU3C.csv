8304003,5,B00128YU3C,"Disclaimer: I am a certified yoga instructor and I have taken a Radiant Child workshop with Shakta Kaur Khalsa. This is a very engaging DVD. My three year old son asks to watch it daily.  Even when I think he isn't paying attention because he has decided to walk away from the TV and play with some toys, he is actively listening.  This entire DVD is songs with accompanying motions.  Most of the songs are sung by children and most of the motions are demonstrated by children.  My son is less interested in participating in the songs with motions demonstrated only by an adult, although he still listens to the songs and sings them on his own long after the DVD is done.  This DVD flows well and keeps children engaged because there is no instructional down time.  There is a separate chapter in the menu for learning the moves that go with the songs.  The only thing that would make this DVD better is if it had a matrix option to pick and choose the sequence of play for the song selections.",1385769600,,994,4.398907103825136

8304005,5,B00128YU3C,"I bought this DVD for my 4.5 year old son, as he really liked it (a friend of mine gave us her copy to try). There is a lot of motion, and a lot of fun, and we enjoy doing it together. And the order came in really fast which was great!",1329091200,,235,3.5384615384615383
8304006,5,B00128YU3C,We bought this 2 years ago to try and bring some peace and fun to a chaotic house. From the day it arrived my kids have loved it. They are now 5 & 3 (& a newborn) & they still love to do it. They ask to put it on at least 3 times a week. It is fun and rhythmic and captures their attention and gets them moving. It's a great gift for any kid when you don't want to settle for another plastic toy that will end up in the garbage or a garage sale. Start the habit early and hopefully will always find it fun and a natural part of their day. LOVE IT!!!,1316131200,,549,3.700854700854701
