The actors were fantastic, especially Nancy Travis, who delivered an incredible performance in this film. Out of all of the movies I've watched starring Nancy, this was her best dramatic performance for sure. The plot made sense and the story was easy to follow. Will definitely watch it again.",1474502400,,394,5.076923076923077

513288,4,6302796377,"To be fair I haven't seen the original Vanishing so I don't have a basis on why this American remake is so hated. However, judging this remake on its own merits with no basis for comparison its a very solid and well acted thriller. Kiefer Sutherland is great and Jeff Bridges gives a truly creepy and bizarre performance that he should be proud of. Its also a very unique thriller too and uses a lot of effective psychology. Its not perfect but its a very noteworthy thriller that deserves a lot more props and is by no means one of the worst movies ever made. Definitely recommended and Twilight Time's blu ray is very quality.",1469836800,,628,4.469565217391304

513316,3,6302796377,There is a blu ray limited edition out there from screen archives available.  But this dvd is what most people will end up with.  The movie is a remake of a great foreign film that came out  a few years earlier than this one. Of course Hollywood had to have a happy ending. which that movie did not.  That film was much more powerful for it's sinister end. This one has the great Jeff Bridges in it though.  A master actor and that's a plus. As well as a young and excellent keifer Sutherland!.  And it's not their fault that the ending was changed here. we need the watcher to show up and give us a choice of endings! The watcher is a marvel comics character that often shows parallel universe choices.  Oh well.  The blu ray looks much better than what we have here of course but it's much more expensive and you must go to screen archives website to get one. They also have 'man in the dark 3d' on that site and many other good movies.,1423699200,5,938,4.201117318435754

513352,4,6302796377,"Seeing Kiefer Sutherland play an overall good guy after so many villianous roles is making me praise this film, I haven't seen the original yet and am very intrigued now. This film has so much depth and suspense, to me at least, that director Joseph Ruben of Good Son and Sleeping with the Enemy couldn't have done better. Jeff Bridges plays a multi-layered villian who only seems to want to prove something to himself all while using Kiefer's obsession as a weapon. Nancy Travis as Rita I went back and forth with, between liking to disliking, especially in regards to Kiefer/Jeff. The remake argument has mostly annoyed me to this day, and has gotten very cliched. To me, you can watch and enjoy both, if both are done right. After the American Funny Games though I have no interest in the foreign version, because that one just infuriated me, (not sure why, read my review under another username.)",1402358400,,900,4.7025316455696204

513389,3,6302796377,"Many of the posted reviews of this film comment unfavorably on Jeff Bridge's acting. His accent is said to be peculiar and his demeanor ""wooden"". I think the flat personality of the character is Bridges' attempt to portray a psychotic character, who is unable to communicate with other people. I am sure he did research into the type of character he was to play. Another criticism of the film is that it is vastly inferior to the original Dutch film. Very possibly it is, but if one watches it on its own terms, it has something to offer. The story is very compelling, even with the much-maligned happy ending. I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone who can bring an open mind to it. There is much to like about it, including that ""happy"" ending. There are good performances by all the principal players and the direction and cinematography are praiseworthy.",1376697600,3,866,4.666666666666667
513390,5,6302796377,"This review is on the movie, not the DVD.  I'm trying to decide if I'll get the DVD or rent it again.  Why the hesitation?  This is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen in my life.  Knowing what's going to happen doesn't lessen the dread, the foreboding.  Every actor in this film should get an Academy Award, especially Bridges.

What makes it scary, is that its plot can happen to anyone.  Very much worth watching.  You'll think twice before entering a truck stop, as a result.  That's good.  Never hurts to be too careful.",1376697600,,531,4.4375
513391,2,6302796377,"This movie was beyond terrible. It's so bad I can hardly believe it. though Sutherland's acting is really very good, Bridges is so wooden it's totally rediculous, and nearly insulting to the intelligence of any human being with an understanding of genuine creative acting. The entire film feels like amature nigthat the movies. I kind of doubt even the Frech version would raise an eyebrow if this remake is really this bad. I don't plan to watch the French version because the story it's self is beond inept and far fetched and just plain stupid. Sutherland is the only reason I gave this mess two stars which is really far to generous. Spare your self the anguish if you have any intelligence at all. What a crapfest this turned out to be- Good lord!!",1367625600,,753,4.626865671641791
513392,1,6302796377,"Last night my girlfriend and I watched both the original Dutch as well as the American remake of ""THE VANISHING"". I'm not sure if there's a more clean-cut example of Hollywood completely ruining something unique and engaging. The only interesting thing about the Hollywood remake was trying to figure out what the hell Jeff Bridges' weird accent was supposed to be. At times he sounded sort of French, sort of German, sort of Indian (both ""feather"" and ""dot"" at various points), sort of mentally handicapped... but nothing we could ever pin down. Finally we agreed that he just sounded like Tommy Wiseau.",1365465600,2,604,4.931372549019608

Kiefer becomes obsessive. He puts up posters and requests help on TV. It is now three years later, and he has never given up looking for her. A waitress picks him up and the two are soon living together. He loves her, but cannot abandon his search. He needs to find out what happened to her.

 Jeff writes Kiefer a letter saying he took his girl friend and comes to his house. Kiefer beats him up. But Jeff says that he will not tell him what happened to his girl friend unless he goes through what she went through. Driven to find her, Kiefer agrees to be drugged. His new girl friend finds out what happened. A neighbor tells her the license plate of Jeff's car. She drives off to save him.

 What ever happened to the kidnapped girl? Will Kiefer's girl friend be able to save him before he experiences what she experienced? Will Kiefer be able to get over his obsession?

It is very suspenseful the first time around, and it is great to watch this movie over again for the comedic elements. The only shortcoming in my opinion is that the ending is too abrupt.",1252281600,7,346,4.421875

Rita investigates his computer and finds some secrets. Jeff explains his actions. Rita works on the problem. Jeff makes his decision. He gets a letter from the man who says he kidnapped Diane. Will they meet? Will Rita be disgusted and leave? [Nobody locks their doors?]

Barney shows up for suspense. Jeff meets him and displays his feelings. Will Jeff follow Barney after being promised a meeting with Diane? Rita goes back to check on Jeff and gets the license plate number of Barney's car! Barney tells how he lured an unsuspecting young woman to his car. Jeff and Barney converse. Will Jeff do something foolish? Will Rita take that metal box? It is better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it. There is conflict again. Rita has spunk, she is a fighter. She revives Jeff for a happy ending. ""We don't drink coffee anymore.""

This is an interesting story about a clever murderer who is a seemingly respectable college professor. You may find fault with parts of this suspense story.

Jeff Bridges showed that he really is a good actor but his ""evil"" doesn't really mesh with how he helps his students and his concern for their safety during chemistry experiments. The other problem with how the director has Jeff Bridges portraying the killer is the foreign accent and appearing mentally slow and socially inept at the beginning of the movie.  I found the ending anti-climatic with Jeff Bridges and Nancy Travis' characters choosing not to write about the events of the disappearance of Sandra Bullock and how Kiefer's obsession with knowing what happened to her was used to ensnare him by a psychopath.  The movie would have been better ending with the rescue and death of the killer.",1226966400,2,806,4.911764705882353

513467,1,6302796377,"Many decry Hollywood remaking great European and Asian films nowadays, but they were doing it many years ago.  This is a great example of the sickness of Hollywood.  This film trashes everything that made the original unique and scary, and tacks on one of the most asinine, childish, unbelieveable happy endings I've ever seen.

This film should be thrown out into the nearest incinerator, it's that bad.  They added a girlfriend for Keifer's character (the original film just concentrated on the boyfriend's obsession with his missing girlfriend), they make the normally brilliant Jeff Bridges speak with a strange accent and look greasy, and the ending (which is so different from the original) is disgustingly conventional, cheap, and stupid.  Despite the fact that George Sluzier directed both the original and this remake, this remake sucks.  Don't see it.  See only the original.",1220054400,3,885,5.23404255319149

513469,4,6302796377,"I'll start out by saying I have neither seen the Dutch film of which this is a remake or read the novel THE GOLDEN EGG that was the source material for both movies.  From reading a little bit about the acclaimed Dutch film it sounds like the first half of the Hollywood version of THE VANISHING follows the original movie very closely but then the second half becomes more of a ""by the numbers"" Hollywood thriller with some action sequences and the requisite happy ending for the survivors.

I'm not giving any spoilers aways by saying Jeff Bridges plays the kidnapper, Barney, as we see him practicing how to snatch a woman in the opening scenes.  Bridges looks the part of a Barney who on the surface is a likable if somewhat eccentric chemistry professor.  For some reason the American Bridges plays the part with some type of European (I think) accent which is quite  jarring when the script states Barney was born and raised in Seattle and at one point even shows his birth certificate.  Kiefer Sutherland is quite good as Jeff whose life becomes an obsession filled mess after the disappearance of his girlfriend more because of a burning desire to find out what happened to her then pure devastation at her loss.  Nancy Travis plays Rita, Jeff's new girlfriend, whom he meets ""cute"" by coming in exhausted from his search for the missing Diane to the all night diner where she works.  Rita later displays amazing talents as a detective and strategist so  apparently was way underemployed in her waitress gig.  Sandra Bullock as the very pretty and sympathetic missing Diane is very adequate but does not have a lot of screen time.

The first half of the film creates Diane and Jeff as believable characters caught in a nightmare.  The second half relies too much on coincidences to move the plot ahead and pop psychology as motives for the characters' actions. If you like thrillers this is an OK way to spend a couple of hours but it seems the potential promised at the film's beginning is not even close to being realize by the end.",1203120000,19,2041,4.638888888888889
513470,2,6302796377,"This is a maddening film because it starts out promisingly but quickly dissipates in the second half to typical Hollywood schlock thriller.  For the first hour or so the film was reminiscent of Hitchcock's work.  Superb performances were on display particularly by Nancy Travis.  Oddly, the worst performance on hand is by Jeff Bridges who previously I never thought capable of bad work.  He affects some implacable accent that makes you scratch your head and not think him menacing.  Pacific Northwest maybe?  Whatever, this flick typifies mediocrity and elicits ennui instead of genuine terror.",1200009600,5,596,5.287234042553192
513471,1,6302796377,"Spoorloos, the Dutch/French original telling of this story, was incredibly successful and remains very popular to this day. Unfortunately this, the American remake directed by the same George Sluizer, frustratingly manages to produce what is almost a mirror-image in terms of value. A lot of this has been attributed to the tacked-on ending that pretty much negates what came before, but it is wrong to blame this alone. The film which precedes the climax is similarly disappointing.

**Most of you will now be aware of what happens, but I'll try my best not to give away too much of what Channel 4 viewers voted the 45th Best Scary Moment in broadcast history. The reason for this is that, although the original is more than worth watching regardless of how much you already know, I'm sure the enjoyment of it is aided further by the viewer's attempts at working out what its sinister antagonist could consider the ultimate act of evil. However, I might reveal aspects (or even big, meaty chunks) of the ending for THIS film, and this interpretation alone, as it's important to understand why it was, deservedly, so poorly received - especially by audiences outside of the United States.**

The first mistake, or the first questionable difference, is that the disappearence and its build-up are all shown in chronological order. In the first version, the story begins with the two victims (Rex and Saskia) driving towards a holiday home, only to have an argument that is then resolved at a petrol station. The supposed villain is then revealed, and then Rex realises his girlfriend has gone missing and is sent into panic. It then flashes back in time to Raymond (the man responsible) preparing for the deed and asking neighbours of his new farm estate about the level of noise they could hear when his beloved family were screaming. Several failed efforts are then shown before the story is brought forward to three years after Saskia went missing, where Rex is still searching for her.

In this remake, the preparation and previous efforts are shown BEFORE we meet the two future victims, this time called Jeff and Diane. This means we immediately know that Diane was kidnapped, unlike in the original where you could have formed the conclusion that she had just gone with the man of her own accord until it was proved otherwise. You're also left with a very unsympathetic baddie, renamed Barnie - presumably because you HAVE to feel some sentiment towards a man who shares a personal label with a dinosaur - whose numerous unsuccessful ventures into abduction are now on display long before his wife and children are introduced.

This may not have been such a problem had the characters eventually been played as vulnerable human-beings. They're not. As Barnie, Jeff Bridges simply comes across as a psycho with no real attempt at justification for what he's done. Not only that, but his strange, quasi-European accent (because pure Americans are incapable of such savage acts of anti-social felony) does nothing less than bludgeon our minds with the hammer of stereotype. Sandra Bullock's small amount of screen-time as Diane is spent whining and bickering with Jeff, leaving the viewer wondering why the two ever got together in the first place. And Kiefer Sutherland's Jeff is a self-motivated, cynical fop - a world away from the obsession-riddled loser portrayed so perfectly by Gene Bervoets five years prior. I don't blame the actors here in the slightest - in fact, all things considered, the two aforementioned male leads do as well as they could - but the material is so blatantly dire that not even Cooper and Brando would, if cast, raise this above two stars.

Oh yeah, that's another stupid decision on behalf of the filmmakers. One of the reasons Spoorloos is so effective is that everyone cast in the leading roles was a complete minnow. None of them, with the exception of Johanna ter Steege, had ever been seen before or has been seen since, which just adds to the depression felt once the tale has culminated. Had Sluizer taken that approach once more, perhaps we could feel some sort of emotional attachment to the characters being presented to us.

I'm not saying you always have to use unknowns - if that were the case, nobody would ever become established. However, the approach worked for the story first time around and would have worked best again, due to its dark nature. Instead, two 'hot property' actors and a woman who was in the midst of a rising career were chosen to represent isolation and unfamiliarity. On this occasion, the suspension of disbelief was far too great for them to achieve. Thankfully for them, the film was actually so bad, as the result of other peoples' stupidity, that none of the main actors' credibilities were really damaged.

So three years pass, although it seems longer on tape, and Jeff obtains a new girlfriend (Rita, played by Nancy Travis). We have to see them meet for the first time in this, because English-language spectators are apparently too slow to put two and two together and work out he's met someone else. We'd probably think it was his sister, wouldn't we? As Jeff's desire to find his past love doesn't really grow beyond 'light concern' or 'mild regard', I'm left scratching my head wondering how on Earth Sluizer thought this would enhance his stock. Is this really his 'vision'? No matter, because Rita gets annoyed anyway, and - unlike in the original, where she won't compete for his affections but still cares very deeply for him and wants him to be content in life, before leaving never to return - decides to get a very small amount of revenge by changing Jeff's answering machine message.

Of course, this is a new twist that allows for the horrendous finale to transpire down the line, as Jeff changes his message back but is interrupted while doing so by the appearance of Barnie. After beating the life out of him for the sake of it (Rex in Spoorloos hits and kicks Raymond due to shellshock and desperation, whereas Jeff just says ""FTW"" and pretty much smashes Barnie's head in for giggles), Jeff hops into Barnie's car and this degenerates into a buddy movie. Well, I wish it had because what we got instead was a very watered-down version of the revisiting/explanation sequences from Spoorloos. The scenes in which Barnie's motives are studied are apparently so worthless and unimportant to the plot that they have to contend with jolly background music and slow-motion camera techniques to hold the attention of the viewers, as well as being roughly a quarter of the length of the originals.

Once these, as well as the flashback of Diane's abduction taking place, are all over, the 'coffee scene' and the 'lighter scene' which marked the end last time around are copied almost word-for-word and shot-for-shot - although without ANY of the urgency, as Jeff's reaction when he realises what has happened to him (and, by proxy, Diane) is no more inspiring or heart-rendering than that of a man infuriated by an untimely power-cut. Albeit, obviously, not a power-cut that took place while watching this movie. I can imagine the fallout from THAT turn of events would probably involve balloons and whistling.

By rights, the film should finish here, and perhaps should have ended long beforehand just to put us out of our collective and individual miseries. I maybe would even have bumped the score up a bit if Rosanne Barr had apologised afterwards as a DVD extra. Alas, it was not to be, and the experience descends further into sub-hope as the most excrutiating of contrived plot-twists takes place.

You see, Rita is so proud of herself for violating Jeff's Smartbeep Autosave earlier in the day that she phones him, at a time she knows he'll be out, to let her friends take a listen. However, discovering the new recording - that, of course, involved Barnie and Jeff's acquaintance - she hurries off to find him. Somehow, she manages to track down Barnie's daughter at his suburban home, becomes friends with her in all of four minutes to the extent that she willingly tells her where the farmhouse is, and then travels there without any trouble finding it in the dark and in the middle of nowhere. She then works out almost immediately what has happened and, even more ridiculously, exactly WHERE it happened, and tricks Barnie into thinking she's kidnapped his daughter. So NOW we're supposed to readily accept that Barnie, a calculating and evil man with no conscience, is so compassionate and easy to fool that he would compromise his own safety and freedom on the grounds that Rita knew his daughter's name. JUST HER NAME and nothing more. I honestly could cry at that point.

Then, she promptly saves the day (and, of course, Barnie just HAS to get his comeuppance), and the film ends with - of all things - a 'feel-good' reversal of financial fortunes and A JOKE as its final line. And not even a good one. Yeah, keep telling yourself you're mentally crippled by your past, Jeff! The only thing it was missing was a pregnancy revelation and a letter from Diane saying she escaped and is living in Cuba. Although, admittedly, if Diane's parents had turned up to complain about Jeff's new business move and taken him to court for it, I might have heralded Todd Graff as the greatest genius on the west coast. Sadly, that didn't happen and what remains is an unmitigated apocalypse of quality.

A lot of idiots blast Martin Scorcese's The Departed because its characters are not faithful to the original, but what these people somehow fail to realise is that they're not supposed to be. It's a complete re-telling in a different climate with different incentives and motives, and it's just as good as - if not better than - Infernal Affairs. THIS is just an incredibly lazy remake of a much-heralded classic, an attempt to make some money from an audience they've determined as being too lazy to read subtitles and too fragile to accept anything bleak, which falls short in almost every conceivable way at creating anything that can be considered decent viewing.

In short, this is not just a disaster in relative terms, when compared to the original. It is, without a doubt, a horrific film in its own right.",1199232000,7,10212,4.8246716162193035

So yes, this film does provide vengeance/resolution/good guys win, which Americans crave, but it also provides some insight that is in my opinion worth the rewrite.

She is not a victim, she has agency - she will not go down without a fight, figuratively or literally, with Jeff or with Barney.  I love watching her piece the whole thing together, and I love watching her interact with Barney in a totally different way from Jeff.

513510,1,6302796377,"NB - Once again Amazon have thoughtlessly contrived to combine the reviews for two different fims on the same page. This review refers to the US remake.

George Sluizer's original Dutch-French version of The Vanishing (aka The Man Who Wanted to Know) offers one of European cinema's most quietly disturbingly anonymous and everyday sociopaths, feeling his way one step at a time towards murder. If you've seen that version, you probably still can't get the final revelation out of your head, but the film had plenty more to offer than that, playing with chronology, subverting the usual cliches of its 'Lady Vanishes' plot (the hero wants to know what happened to his missing lover far more than he wants her to be alive) and throwing in some excellent characterization. I can only assume that for this 1993 US remake Sluizer was so determined that no-one else was going to get the chance to ruin his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself, but few people could have anticipated how comprehensively he trashes his own work. His career never recovered.

Chief culprit is an astonishing performance by Jeff Bridges that has been overthought through in every detail to a truly disastrous level. A friend who produced one of his earliest movies noted that Bridges was a great instinctive actor as long as you stopped him thinking about what he was doing, and this film is the proof of the pudding. Every movement is overly mechanical in its precision, making him look like a rusty clockwork toy, while his voice is a bizarre mixture of Tootsie, Latka Gravas from Taxi and a Dalek who have all been taking elocution lessons from Dok-tah E-ville. No banality of evil here, just a looney walking around with an invisible sign over his head saying ""Please. Let. Me. Kill. You. Thank you. For your. Consideration.'

But the blame really needs to be shared out here. None of the performances are good: often, they don't even look good - Keifer Sutherland looks more like a baby hamster than a distraught man at his wits end in the hurried scenes at the gas station, Nancy Travis flounders badly and Sandra Bullock makes no impression at all as the object of his obsession. Not that they're given any help by either director or writer Todd Graff. The script is particularly weak. The chronology has been altered to put the focus firmly on Bridges at the expense of the couple at the opening of the film. Worse is the rush the film is in, draining the life and character from each scene in its race to get to the next. Rather than the high/low mood shifts in the couple's relationship or the apparently casual but careful establishing of the feel of the location, we just get a couple of arguments that give you the impression that he's probably better off without her. As for the new and improved happy ending - standard woman chased by nutter in the woods jeopardy stuff complete with lame `let's end on a joke like a TV cop show' moment - best not go there... which is advice that holds for this entire trainwreck of a movie. Even a shockingly bland and uninspired Jerry Goldsmith score can't do anything for this one.",1131148800,3,3125,4.678181818181818
513511,3,6302796377,"Director George Sluzier has remade his classic of the same name, but Hollywoodized it for our audiences.  The result is a mixed bag, blessed with good performances, but with a by the numbers script that suddenly turns ludicrous.  Jeff Bridges is effective as the psychopath who kidnaps a then unknown Sandra Bullock right out from under Kiefer Sutherland's eyes.  Three years later, Sutherland is obsessed in finding out what happened to Bullock.  He falls for Nancy Travis (an excellent performance) and tries to start his life again...supposedly.  But he is covertly tracking Bullocks whereabouts and can't shake his obsession.  The movie then turns pretty outlandish when Bridges decides to tell Sutherland where he can find Bullock.  We pretty much know Bullock's fate, and Sutherland's willingness to follow Bridges is pretty incredulous.  A whacked out finale at Bridges' isolated cabin is more reminiscent of a slasher film and ultimately destroys the credibility of the movie's plot.  A nice try but not as good as it should have been.",1131148800,2,1043,5.197604790419161
513512,5,6302796377,"In 1988, director George Sluizer had directed a film entitled, THE VANISHING. The film was all in Dutch and starred Dutch actors, who are nowhere near well-known in this country.

  In 1993, director George Sluizer, who had directed the original Dutch film, had decided to direct a remake of his own film, this time, casting a well-known cast that consists of Kiefer Sutherland, Nancy Travis, Sandra Bullock, & Jeff Bridges. The film is almost the same as the original Dutch version, but this one is much more worth the time and money.

  JEFF HARRIMAN (played by Kiefer Sutherland) and his girlfriend, DIANE SHAVER (played by Sandra Bullock) are driving to the mountains for vacation. They have a little spout, after their car runs out of gas, while in a dark tunnel. Leaving Diane there, Jeff heads off to get enough gas to drive them to a nearby gas station. He comes back to find Diane sitting outside the other end of the tunnel, upset and distraught. They pull into a gas station, where Diane has Jeff, who laughs with cheerfulness, repeat an apology. They kiss passionately, where Diane heads into the store to buy her and Jeff some cold beers. A half-hour goes by and Diane has not yet returned. He searches the store, as well as the whole ground, but Diane is nowhere to be found.

  Three years later, Jeff is still on the hunt for his beloved girlfriend. Every month for the last three years, Jeff would renew the posters he had printed of Diane. He has even gone to the local newspapers and national television news stations and pleaded with the person who had kidnapped Diane to tell him where she is. He walks into a diner one night, still very miserable, and meets RITA BAKER (played by Nancy Travis). Rita is instantly attracted to Jeff. Jeff and Rita begin a love affair together. Jeff tries to move on with his life, but he cannot, for he is still searching for Diane. Rita finds out about what Jeff is doing behind her back. She tries to help get over his obsession, but it doesn't work. Jeff receives a letter from a man named BARNEY COUSINS (played by Jeff Bridges). Jeff shows Rita the letter, but she realizes that his obsession is still going on, where she leaves him. She goes to their appartment, packs her things, changes the outgoing message on their answering machine. Jeff returns home and changes the machine himself, but as the recording is still going, Barney appears. Jeff beats the hell out of him, but Barney reveals that he can tell him where Diane is, and that in order for Jeff to find out what happened to her, he'd have to ride with Barney.

  While at a bar with her girlfriend, Rita calls her appartment to let her girlfriend her the outgoing message, but Rita hears that Jeff had already changed it, to which she finds Barney's voice on the machine. She realizes that Jeff is in danger and rushes over to help him, but Jeff and Barney are already on their way.

  Rita finds out what happened from her neighbor, where her neighbor gives Rita the license plate number to Barney's car. With this License Plate #, Rita finds out where Barney lives and drives off to his place.

  Jeff and Barney arrive at the gas station where Diane was last seen three years earlier. Barney hands Jeff a cup of coffee, where Barney informs Jeff that the coffee is drugged. He tells Jeff that in order to find out what happened to Diane, Jeff has to go through the exact same details that Diane had gone through. Jeff, through hurtful tears, drinks the coffee and blacks out. He wakes up to darkness. He flips on his lighter to find himself locked...in a coffin and...buried alive outside Barney's vacation cabin in the woods. Barney had done this to poor Diane, who, after three years of being buried in the ground without anyone coming to her aid, is now dead.

  Rita arrives at Barney's house, where she meets Barney's daughter, DENISE (played by Maggie Linderman). She asks Rita to giver her a ride to the carnival, as long as she doesn't say a word to to Barney. Rita asks Denise how to get to the summer cabin where Barney is at. Denise gives her the directions and Rita is on her way. She arrives and has a brief brawl with Barney. She stops when he is about to kill her. She is now seated inside his cabin, talking with Barney, trying to find out what he did with Jeff. She notices the dirt on his shoes, the dirt on a shovel, standing beside the door, and realizes that she had seen a long spot on the ground without grass, and realizes that Barney had buried Jeff alive. She knocks Barney and begins digging up Jeff. But not before Barney awakens and begins brawling again with Rita. Did Jeff suffocate and bite the dust as Diane had done? Will Barney kill of Rita as well? The only way to find is to watch this 1993 remake of THE VANISHING.

I do not find that a good enough reason to hate this movie. This movie was just outstanding and was much better than the remake.

Let me get one thing off my chest, first of all. This is a remake...in a different language. All you sad acts who compared this to the original probably marked it down because it didn't have subtitles. Face facts guys, you only watch foreign films because it makes you feel clever, therefore any film that dares try and take a subtitled film and put it in a more accessible format can't possibly be good because it brings you down to the level of Hollywood 'plebs'. GET OVER YOUR OWN SELF-INFLATED EGOS!! Why you can't you enjoy a film purely in itself, without your damn incessant comparing using big words. You're not big, you're not clever; you are boring and narrow-minded. Foreign cinema does not broaden your horizons, it merely places you 3 steps higher on an intellectual ladder that exists solely in your own heads.
I, in my own little head, enjoyed the film. It was good, not brilliant, so I gave it 4 stars mainly to raise the average rating to save it from snobs like you lot. The ending, however, was pure Hollywood stilton but did not taint my enjoyment of the film; I'm not petty like some I could berate.
The gist of the film, basically, is that Kiefer Sutherland has spent the last three years of his life trying to find his missing girlfriend, Diane (Bullock), who was abducted and subsequently (yes, I know big words too. Foreign film fans beware!!) buried alive by the evil psychopath, Bridges (who acted a little hammily!). Travis plays the new girlfriend who must constantly live in Diane's shadow. As Sutherland gets furhter drawn into this macabre cat-and-mouse game with Bridges, so Travis must try to extricate herself from the situation.
The finale is fantastic, even gripping, and Sutherland is well on par throughout. My advice? Enjoy the film, forget it's a remake, and if you can't be satisfied with that, stick your head up your own hmm-hmm-hmm and buy the foreign film so that you don't waste mine, and other people's time, with your incessant whinging and ego-boosting.

513547,4,6302796377,"Well, what can I say?  Other than I was deeply impressed with how a film can create so much suspense with hardly any action or nail biting scenes.  The only other film that can create such a docile form of suspense is Hitchcock's ""Rear Window.""  The suspense of this film is brilliantly done, because as we follow the main character, we are asking the same questions he is and we never lose interest.
Dianne (Bullock) mysteriously vanishes while her boyfriend Jeff (Sutherland) is waiting for her outside some gas joint.  When she doesn't show, he calls the police and goes through the typical missing person's routine of anxiety.  We feel for Jeff instantly because the panic in both his expressions and performance are real.  He's scared, worried, and with good reason.
Well, things begin to look up temporarily for Jeff when he meets Rita, who becomes his new girlfriend despite being unable to find Dianne.  But hold on, Jeff still loves Dianne, and wants to still find her even though he is just beginning a new life with Rita.  This emotionally tears at Jeff and he finds himself torn between a woman who he loved that is gone and a woman who he is loving and is there.
Now bring in the kidnapper Barney (Bridges), who kidnapped Bullock as an experiment and without malice.  Barney is the most well done character in this film, because he we don't hate him, not initially, even though what he is planning to do and does is wrong.  We like him but we don't.  He seems harmless but what did he do to Dianne?
This movie is one of those that tears at you.  You're torn along with Jeff over Dianne or Rita.  You're torn on the character of Barney: just eccentric or flat out evil?  You're torn on Jeff's biggest decisions.  This is a highly entertaining movie because you love the suspense these divisions create.  You want to find out what happened to Dianne and what Barney is really all about.
Now, the bad news.  I gave this film four stars for two distinct reasons.  The first is because I never did fully grasp why Barney wanted to kidnap someone.  Although I praise his character, the one flaw in it is motive.  He wants to kidnap as a form of experiment, but surely there must be something else, something deeper.  The movie tries to explain his deep down reasons to why he does what he does but it is muddled and difficult to fully understand why.  I guess one could rest at ease by just labeling him a typical looney.
The second problem I have with this movie is that I think it's a one time watch.  Meaning, you'll see it the first time, think it's great, but then never watch it again.  It's because this movie survives by portraying the unknown.  You don't know anymore than Jeff does about what happened to Dianne, so you watch in eager anticipation.  But once you know what happened, is it ever even remotely as entertaining to see it again?  Sure, you can say this about any movie.  The difference is that this movie's only and biggest draw is, again, the unknown.
So I do recommend this movie, to those of you who like psychological thrillers, and love movies that keep you wide awake with subtle suspense and tremendous believability in both plot and acting.  But beware, it may not be the kind of film you'll want to see again and again.  Because this movie never vanishes from your memory.

  The story is the following: a young couple-  Jeff  (Keifer Southerland) and Diane Shaver(Sandra Bullock) returns home after spending a weekend near Mountain Saint Helens. At a gas-station, Diane goes to buy some beer but never returns. Jeff doesn't give up the hope and keeps looking for her ,as 3 years elapse... He finds a woman to rebuild his life with (Rita -  Nancy Travis), but the memory of Diane doesn't allow him to continue his life. He's permanently asking himself where she is, whether she is dead or maybe living happily somewhere... The thought of not-knowing is too painful.
 At the same time, Barney(Jeff Bridges) is a strange chemistry-teacher, with a wife and daughter, apparently a normal, pleasant person, but who is ,in fact, a weird kind of psycho, obssesed with the perfect kidnapping. After three years, he contacts Jeff telling him that he is the one who kidnapped Diane 3 years ago, and that he is willing to let him know the truth, with one condition: to accept being submitted to the same experience as Diane. Jeff accepts to lead the same horrific path as his beloved Diane.
  This is the story, mainly, but what really attracted me was the opposition between Jeff and Barney. For Jeff, Diane is the love of his life...while for Barney she is nothing superior to an experiment. Her life means nothing for him. A person can mean so much to someone and so little to someone else... Also, Jeff's drama is the drama of not-knowing...he doesn't know if Diane just abandoned him or if something happened to her...He just wants an answer, and until that happens, his life cannot be the same as before...
  Although brief, Sandra Bullock makes a really good and convincing performance as Diane Shaver, the missing girlfriend.",1027036800,5,2001,4.807580174927113
513552,5,6302796377,"I love this movie.  It didn't open in the theatres with a bang and a lot of people, I have found, have never heard of this film at all.  It's pretty surprising since The Vanishing boasts a pretty strong cast.  What I can tell you is that if you haven't seen the European version (I still haven't), this is a wonderful thriller and a must see.  I have shown this movie to multiple friends and they all came away loving it.  I don't understand with all the horrible and unknown movies making it to DVD these days, why a good film like this hasn't made it to DVD.  I can honestly tell you that this is one of my favorite movies of all-time.",1018137600,7,637,4.138211382113822

7831382,4,6302796377,"Released in 1993 and directed by George Sluizer from a novel by Tim Krabb, The Vanishing is a crime drama/mystery/horror about a man (Kiefer Sutherland) whose girlfriend goes missing during a trip in Washington State (Sandra Bullock) and he searches in vain for her for years. After he starts a relationship with a new girlfriend (Nancy Travis), the abductor (Jeff Bridges) finally contacts him. Will he find his former girlfriend?

This is the second time the director shot this same story; the first time was the 1988 Euro film of the same name. The stories are identical except for the final acts and the fact that this newer version has a better character/part for the new girlfriend (Travis). Both films are worth catching, but I prefer this one for reasons explained below. Fans of the first movie object to the changes, arguing that the producers of this version were pandering to North American tastes. While this may be true, its also likely that the director didn't want to make the same exact movie. After all, we already have the first version, why make an exact duplicate with different actors and locations? Besides, whats wrong with appreciating BOTH versions? My comments below reveal why Sluizer wanted to change things up a little with this version.

Audiences may have rejected the film at the box office on the grounds that they weren't used to Bridges playing a contemptible villain or Sutherland playing the good guy, but they're both fine in these roles, particularly the former, whos great and fascinating to observe. One thing that keeps you watching during the drama of the first two acts is to find out what his motivations are. But, as hinted above, its Travis who steals the show, at least as far as protagonists goes. Perhaps audiences didn't receive her or the movie well because her characters merely a waitress whose story arc doesnt end in a reversal of fortune, which is in contrast to the typical movie heroine. Who knows? I think shes awesome.

In any case, if you like psychological drama/thrillers like Fatal Attraction (1987) and Single White Female (1992) youll appreciate The Vanishing.

The movie runs 109 minutes and was shot mostly in Washington State, but also Cody Tunnel, Cody, Wyoming (the tunnel sequence) and La Canada and Long Beach, CA (the diner and pool hall scenes respectively).

GRADE:  B+

***SPOILER ALERT*** (Dont read further unless youve watched the movie)

While the first film could be interpreted as a commentary on nihilism, since the villain wins and the hero loses, it doesnt HAVE to be interpreted this way. After all, its a simple fact of life that sometimes evil wins a battle now and then; and sometimes A LOT of them, but this doesnt mean evil wins the war, so to speak. If theres ultimate good then evil will eventually have its day of reckoning.

In any event, the 1988 movie ends on a decidedly downbeat note. And this is why I appreciate this newer version: While it is also downbeat, and evil wins to a point, the changes in the final act show good triumphing over evil, not to mention perseverance over intellect and love over absence of love. The subtext is all about freewill  freewill to kill for no good reason and freewill to kill for good when absolutely necessary. The theme of the first movie is limited in that it drives home the first point whereas this version drives home both, and is the better for it.",1488067200,,3395,4.778156996587031
7831383,4,6302796377,"Fairly creepy but Kiefer Sutherland and Nancy Travis give terrific performances in this movie. Of course, Jeff Bridges is remarkably on point with his interpretation of the highly disturbed Barney. Definitely one good for locking up all the doors and turning out the lights with a nice little blankie to hide under when it gets to be too nerve-racking.",1484179200,2,352,4.983050847457627
