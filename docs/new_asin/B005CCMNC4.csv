4652522,4,B005CCMNC4,"Coming to the Olympic Lifts as a CrossFit coach, Greg Everett has made an incredibly thorough and instructional DVD here. When combined with the accompanying book, you are really able to get inside the details and technique of each lift, including several different progressions. Highly recommended only if you really want to learn how to perform and / or teach the lifts. Not for anyone looking for a quick, ""get fit now!"" program.",1328572800,14,432,4.931506849315069
4652523,5,B005CCMNC4,"Having done olympic lifts for the last 10 years but not having instruction on them either in about 9 had left my technique with some holes.  I have always been able to get a good amount of weight up but I wasn't efficient with my lifts.  This video shows just about if not every movement involved in olympic lifts in full speed as well as slow motion with an occasional pause where the point of emphasis is.  When dealing with movements that are done in a split second this breakdown of the movement is vital in seeing what you want your athlete (or yourself) to be concentrating on.  I recommend this for all lifters novice and experienced as we can all take something from it, well worth the investment.",1328486400,20,705,4.441860465116279
4652524,5,B005CCMNC4,"Perfect DVD for the novice or experienced lifter. Explains in details the Olympic lifts,  various warm ups, and equipment/gear to facilitate better lifts. Coach Everett applies an easy approach to performing the technical lifts with better ease. Great for coaches, Crossfit athletes, or beginners. I highly recommend this DVD.",1328486400,5,326,5.653061224489796
4652525,4,B005CCMNC4,"This DVD set is a perfect companion to Everett's book which has extremely detailed descriptions and many pictures.  However, if you are one who learns visually or by example, the pictures may not be enough.  The DVD steps in at this point and puts all of the drills into full-color motion.  Don't expect any new material to be presented here that's not in the book nor any ""bonus"" sections either.  Simply put, it's the book transferred into a video format.  If you don't have access to an Olympic lifting coach locally, this DVD will give you a good start on the mechanics of the lifts.",1328486400,9,587,4.552380952380952
4652526,4,B005CCMNC4,"Of course the best way to learn is the read it, hear it, write it, do it.  This video allows us as athletes to hear and visually see the progressions of the Olympic lifts. My only wish was that they were broken down a bit more, frame-by-frame.  They are slowly shown, but a more ""Dartfish""-type of view (or additional angles) may also be beneficial.  Still, this is a great video for those looking to not only see the progressions of the clean and jerk and the snatch, but also to hear the how's and and why's of the progressions.  It's a great way for someone who has some Olympic lifting experience to continue to improve given their own determination to practice the lifts consistently.

Worth the investment - C. Miller, Owner, Raleigh CrossFit, Raleigh, NC",1328227200,5,761,4.607407407407408
4652527,5,B005CCMNC4,The book and the video go hand in hand and are awesome tools for the beginner and the coach alike.  You won't go wrong with the set.  With the oly lifts seeing the movement in action is priceless.,1328054400,5,196,4.131578947368421
4652528,5,B005CCMNC4,Crossfit led me to the Olympic lifts and I had no clue as to form & technique for these lifts.  I would just muscle my way through them and it was ugly.  This video not only broke down the form and technique it also made it simple and easy to follow. I am a visual learner and this helped me so much as opposed to looking at video's on you tube.,1327968000,11,345,3.8450704225352115
4652529,5,B005CCMNC4,"As a 'close to middle-aged' olympic lifting novice, this DVD is just what I needed to continue working on the lifts at home. Of course, nothing can replace being under the gaze of a good coach, but when you're not, this will help instill proper technique and form.",1327968000,4,264,4.520833333333333
4652530,5,B005CCMNC4,"This volume represents a thorough presentation of the basic and advanced training to acquire and build the skills to successfully perform the 2 Olympic lifts. For those unfamiliar with Olympic lifting, this sport demands the development of flexibility, co-ordination, speed, and finally, power. Performance of the lifts represents a true measure of overall body strength and agility. All of this goes far beyond gym rat bodybuilding and power lifting (no disrespect - but what are you guys trying to accomplish?).

In more than 50 chapters, Greg Everret methodically works through the basics for learning and performing the lifts.  This is probably the first time that I have seen both a precise description of the hook grip and the reasons to use it.  Everret uses a unique approach to the lifts by breaking down the lifts into specific movements and exercises from the top down.  Learning to lift from the floor is the last part of the lessons.

I am 65 years old and have recently returned to resistance training after a 10 year layoff.  I wanted to take an approach different from a basic (and boring) conditioning regimen that focused on isolated muscle groups. Olympic lifting gives a true measure of athletic conditioning.  My workouts now focus on learning the lifts and working on those movements such as squats, dead lifts, and presses that condition the muscle groups necessary to perform the lifts successfully.

See [...] for a good preview of the DVD.",1327795200,29,1465,5.0
4652531,3,B005CCMNC4,This is a good guide for your more advanced lifting coach who has an intermediate knowledge of how to train the olympic lifts. If you are new to coaching the olympic lifts I would recommend something a little bit easier to follow.,1419811200,,230,4.5
4652532,4,B005CCMNC4,Excellent teaching tool for learning to do it the correct way. I also bought the book and recommend it as well.,1413590400,,111,4.333333333333333
4652533,5,B005CCMNC4,Excelent DVD! Good explanations about the tecnical aspects of all lifting and their progressions.,1410998400,,97,6.0
4652534,5,B005CCMNC4,I know nothing about Olympic lifting.  This seems like a good place to start.  Good quality video and progressions on the disc.  The book is very useful as well.,1397433600,,161,4.482758620689655
4652535,5,B005CCMNC4,"Very informative book on how to learn to olympic weightlift, the technique, assistance exercises as well as how to program. Good to be coupled with the DVD. Highly recommend the resource! He also has a youtube channel where you can watch how he trains his current members",1394928000,,271,4.787234042553192
4652536,5,B005CCMNC4,"I got the book and the DVD and would highly recommend getting both. The book has descriptions, longer commentary and stop photos that are not on the DVD.  The DVD is excellent in showing and describing the lifts - breaking them down.  But the book goes a little deeper.  I have been watching the video and then going back to the book to look at the pictures and reread the descriptions.  There is a lot of overlap for sure.  If you can only get one, it would depend on your learning style.  If you are a visual learner, get the DVD.  If you learn from reading, get the book.
If you are interested in getting better at your Olympic lifts or trying to fix a problem, I haven't found another Olympic lifting book and/or DVD that is better.  If you are a coach, this will give you a bunch of different views and ways to help someone see and feel each component of each lift.
Highly recommend as a set.",1393804800,,897,4.235294117647059
4652537,5,B005CCMNC4,"Perhaps the most comprehensive and accessible book on weightlifting out there. If you are a weightlifter and are interested in coaching yourself, or if you coach weightlifters, this book needs to be in your library!",1386115200,,215,5.171428571428572
4652538,3,B005CCMNC4,Shows you the only lifts but not enough to diagnose and fix your form. It trys slow motion to show correct path of the bar but not enough cue points given. Get the book also if you're going to buy.,1376956800,,197,3.95
4652539,5,B005CCMNC4,"This is for me the Bible for everybody who wants to practice weightlifting in any sport. Lot of tips, facts and great photos to explain complexity of weightlifting.",1375401600,,164,4.892857142857143
4652540,5,B005CCMNC4,"I refer to it often.  Well organized and simple enough for a novice to understand, but at the same time very technical and useful to the experienced lifter looking for minor technique refinement.  The video is excellent as well.",1366329600,,228,4.82051282051282
4652541,5,B005CCMNC4,Great source of information for the beginner to the seasoned trainer. Must buy for anyone looking to take there olympic lifts to the next level.,1362700800,,144,4.8
4652542,5,B005CCMNC4,"Purchased alongside the book provided a great learning tool

Amount of content in the book was great and explained perfectly. Book has a way of conveying information that experience coaches and relative newcomers to Olympic weightlifting can both benefit from. DVD was to the point and gave easy to understand instruction.

Book was also written in a way that gave the best information in terms of what the author had found with his athletes. Too many of these books seem to have an agenda based on providing the new 'must-do' techniques and training regimes. Everett gives his take on things with the attitude of 'this has worked for my athletes but doesn't necessarily mean other methods won't work'. Any S&C book that takes the tone of 'this is the best way to do it every other way is a waste of time' isn't worth the effort in my opinion.

If you want an Olympic Weightlifting resource for both a coaching and/or a training viewpoint, purchase the book and the DVD and you won't need another resource, it really is the 'complete' guide. Is a great product, well done to the authors.",1361750400,,1087,4.680628272251309
4652543,4,B005CCMNC4,"Very good, systematically progresses through a series of movements that eventually lead you to perform the olympic lifts. You can find a lot of this information for free on youtube and the internet in general, but this is from a reputable source and saves you the many hours of cutting through the BS, finding good quality videos, compiling it all, etc. However, it does not go so much into diagnosing common problems or how to fix them, or setting a lifting program, it is only how to do the lifts. But, once again, if you want that kind of stuff you can easily go on youtube. There is a book which is supposed to partner with the video but I did not purchase, maybe the information is on there, I don't know. Overall, good technique video, saves you a lot of time and research. The downside, it doesn't have everything you might wish it to, and you could conceivably find a lot of this yourself. Look up 'Starting Strength' by Mark Rippetoe on Amazon, you can read the incredibly (maybe overly) thorough instruction on how to do Press, Squat, and Deadlift (foundational moves for oly lifting) for free if you click on the 'look inside'. This is part one of the most useful video instruction I've found on youtube for performing the Clean: [...]  And this is part 1 of the most useful videos I've found for the Snatch: [...]  Learn the strength exercises, go through all three parts of each of these videos, perform the technique progressions, maybe find a lifting program on google, start light, and you should be well on your way.
Happy lifting!",1359849600,,1548,4.584837545126354
4652544,5,B005CCMNC4,I got this for my boyfriend at his request to accompany the textbook that it complements.  He loves it!  Great tool for anyone serious about improving their lifts.,1356739200,,163,4.785714285714286
4652545,3,B005CCMNC4,I like he DVD.  The only complain I have is the way it teaches you how to perform the jumping position.  Everett be leaves that it can not be thought and the best way is just tell the person to jump when the bar is in jumping position.  I keep bending my elbow when I just tried to jump.  I purchased two DVDs from World Class Coaching and they break it down.  I was able to clean up my clean greatly.,1356566400,,401,3.9012345679012346
4652546,5,B005CCMNC4,"Watch and watch again, then start doing it. It did teach me few minor things that do make the difference. I had had some lifting problems that watching this dvd corrected .",1356480000,,172,4.40625
4652547,5,B005CCMNC4,"Everett knows his stuff and lays it out well in this DVD. I watched, I learned.
Definitely a worthwhile purchase.",1356220800,,113,4.7
4652548,4,B005CCMNC4,"this is a great dvd for learning the olympic lifts

if you are thinking about getting it, don't think, do it

even if you have the book - it is worthwhile

so why the 4 stars? well it would have been nice if there had of been some examples of coaching with some novices. the dvd is entirely made up of drills, so it shows you exactly what to do correctly, but not what common mistakes are.

and also it does not have english subtitles! i just think this necessary in every dvd, not just for deaf people, but so people with impect hearing (like me) don't have to rewind to pic up on words... and we can watch  it in our apartment when our girlfriends are asleep after being on the night shift. i was so used to having it on every dvd i buy i didn't realise how much it sucks without it

but... that probably doesn't bother you... so just buy it!",1352505600,,844,4.084848484848485
4652549,4,B005CCMNC4,"A very thorough and instructive DVD covering 2 Olympic lifts. This is a systematic approach to teaching the Snatch and the Jerk.  The DVD is divided into chapters covering each of the stages in the progression of the lifts. Subjects such as stance, grip, grip width, are covered. This is a great complement to the book of the same name. I found it helpful to actually watch the movements as they are described and the slow-motion view is also very useful.  I have not watched or practiced these lifts extensively and have been accustomed to bodybuilding style training, so that is just insight to my background on the subject.
I found the systematic approach to the lifts was congruent to my style of instruction.  The are no troubleshooting drills, but that would seem to be too overwhelming to cover in this DVD. I realize there are numerous variations to a lift and this DVD covers basic positions and movements and does suggest a few options due to physical differences. The DVD does not cover lack of flexibilty or ways to develop proper mobility, but that could again be another complete DVD in itself.
Overall I feel I gained enough from the DVD to teach basic movements. I will in no way ever be teaching competitors, so the depth of detail is perfect for my use.",1351382400,,1271,4.64
4652550,5,B005CCMNC4,"This is a well made DVD, and presents a logical approach to learning the Oly lifts.

I follow along with the DVD at home using a light PVC pipe to work on my technique.

If you do not have access to professional instruction, and want to learn the Oly lifts, this is a good option.

The book covers much more than the DVD, but for learning the lifts, the visual format of the DVD does a better job than the well written instructions in the book.",1337644800,14,444,4.1395348837209305

8465113,3,B005CCMNC4,"I got this to help me understand the different lifts that I'm learning in CrossFit. I'm still confused, though there is some good information here. Looks perhaps more useful for coaches, teaching them how to break lifts down into smaller moves that can be taught and drilled before someone attempts the complete move. I'll rematch in a few months and see whether anything stuck!",1438214400,,378,4.921875
8465114,5,B005CCMNC4,"I'm not really qualified to critique a resource for learning Olympic weightlifting technique since I don't compete in it, but my context and experience may be useful for some that are looking into buying it.  I primarily compete in triathlons and took up weightlifting to improve performance after some CrossFit experience.  I began with ""Starting Strength"" and later progressed to this.  The learning progression is very detailed, so I feel the DVD is sufficient to learn Olympic weightlifting with no other resource, though the accompanying book does provide deeper insight if you need it.  The photography and production are superior to the ""Starting Strength"" DVD if you're familiar with that, and doesn't have the cheeseball music and antics you've probably seen in many an eighties and nineties fitness video.  It's a serious resource that I think accomplishes well a noble goal: spreading solid knowledge of a sport that is very underappreciated in the USA.",1435795200,,964,5.233766233766234
