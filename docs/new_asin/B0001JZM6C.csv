I digress...sorry.  The movie and the seller were simply outstanding.  I searched for YEARS for this moving.  Be aware however, it IS the show, not the one with the cartoon at the beginning.  Yes, I have a steel clamp memory.  Much to the chagrin of old friends.  Uh, Did I type that out loud?  This involves the ""YOUNG"" Kurt Russell long before he tried to ""Escape from New York,"" only to head west and ""Escape from LA,"" he should just go to Texas and settle down.  You'll enjoy the different sequences of mid 60's car nostalgia.  Makes me want to dig out the ol' VCR and hook it up to my flat screen...why?  Because I HAVE A COPY!  You can to.  Enjoy.",1437091200,,899,4.375757575757576

8013412,5,B0001JZM6C,"Considering this is a VHS tape, and a relatively older movie, the quality is decent.  The movie itself has that Disney feel to it, but has some cheesy parts as well.  I got this for my dad for a birthday gift and his loves it because it reminds him of being younger.  I love the original Disney stuff, so I enjoy playing this movie once in a while.  I wouldn't get it if you are interrested in some cool new find of an exciting movie, this is kinda booring at times (I have fallen asleep twice white watching it) but I enjoy watching it to remind me of when times were more innocent.",1359072000,,583,4.132743362831858
8013413,4,B0001JZM6C,"This video has 2 separate adventure episodes from ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" television show that played on Sunday nights from 1953 to 1983. The first is one of my favorites, the comedy ""Dad Can I Borrow the Car"", originally aired in 1972 after first serving as a theatrical featurette in 1970. In a twist from the usual plans for these shows, the studio originally planned this as a TV episode, but during production they changed it into a theatrical featurette since it was turning out so well. Later they had to add more material to make it fit the time frame needed for the TV show when the decided to air it there.  Americans love their cars, but hate the pollution, traffic, bad drivers, and such that comes with car ownership. A mix of some terrific animation bits mixed with a live action story of a kid who wants to own a car and his experiences buying a car and in driver's education.  Hilarious family fare and I and my 9 year old son really enjoy it.

This next episode is more serious fare, first aired in 1980. ""Hunter and the Rock Star"" originally was titled ""Sultan and the Rock Star"" is a story about a tame tiger who is taken to a rich man's private island to be hunted. The tiger is tormented by the gamekeeper in order to make him mean for the owner to hunt down. A young Timothy Hunter plays a rock star who is hiding from his fans and tries to help the tiger. I highly recommend this video.",1111449600,6,1417,4.339622641509434
