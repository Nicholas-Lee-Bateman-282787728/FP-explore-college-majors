8594734,5,B00DNF1SCI,"This is a well-made documentary.  The camera work is first-rate and they capture some extraordinary moments.  But it contains acts of violence that were hard for me to watch, and I'm a veteran naturalist--that is to say, a veteran, and a naturalist.  I have three purple hearts and a doctorate in ecology.  I bring my unique skillset to my own line of wildlife documentaries.

In my first feature, ""Blood on the Savannah"", I was following a herd of Thomson's gazelles across the dry scrub of the Serengeti.  They paused to rest in a clearing.  It was near sunset and quiet.  Too quiet.  Just as they were bedding down, I spotted a clan of hyenas approaching in predatory formation.  They circled the herd, allowing the stronger, mature gazelles to escape, until they'd surrounded a cluster of terrified fawns and yearlings.  Then they closed in.  They began their high-pitched vocalizations--it sounds like laughter to us, but it's how they communicate their plan of attack.  There is nothing malicious in this.  It is only instinct.  At this point, however, my own instincts kicked in--in the form of a concussion grenade.  Their laughter died down pretty goddamn quick.  That night, the ""circle of life"" was a perimeter of sulfur flares and small arms fire.  Purists may question my objectivity, but in the morning, the gazelles rejoined their herd.  Objective achieved.

On my next project, ""Deep Water, Wide Load"", I was filming a herd of hippos in a mangrove swamp in Mozambique.  The herd was presided over by a particularly aggressive alpha bull.  A female swam by with her newborn calf--the shy calf cleaving to his mother's side.  Suddenly the alpha lunged at the calf.  I'd seen this before.  Dominant males will kill the offspring of a breeding-age female in order to put her back into estrus.  It's the alpha's way of establishing his genetic dominance, and may contribute to the long-term viability of the herd.  That said, it's a terrible thing to watch.  Unless you have a bazooka.  Which I did.  Aim, click, BOOM.  Suddenly it was raining blood and blubber, and all that was left of that alpha were the four stubby legs now holding up my coffee table.  Go ahead and judge me, but that baby hippo lived to see another day.

Maybe I don't always get it right.  I still wake up in cold sweats over that emu in Tasmania.  Was it a bluff charge?  I'll never know.  You can't second-guess a flamethrower.  At the end of the day, you make the best call you can and hope to God you've left the world a little better than you found it.  It's a jungle out there.",1392249600,15,2568,4.685393258426966
