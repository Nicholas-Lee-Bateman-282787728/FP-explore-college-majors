8706424,5,B00UGQEWUM,"It is between world wars in London. Laura Henderson (Judi Dench) is recently widowed. Now she must look for something to do with her time and money. Having exhausted all the conventional outlets, she ventures in to the world of theater. She purchased the dilapidated ""Windmill"" theater. To make a go of it she employs the well know Vivian Van Damm (Bob Hoskins) to run things. Vivian demands a free hand and is many time at odds with Laura. To save the faltering enterprise they come up with a nude tableau presentation.

Mrs. Henderson is overbearing and not as much a bigot as snot. Early on she accuses Van Damm of being Jewish. To playact his entourage he is forced to disrobe. When Mr. Henderson walks in and takes a long look ""You really are Jewish"".

The film is loosely based on real events yet adjusted for today's audience. You will notice many of the standard scenarios and clichs with a touch of ""chorus line"" or maybe 42 nd street. The real value is not just the fine acting but their personal interaction of the characters as the all learn (usually too late) more of each other as time goes by. As facades are stripped away, there is a lot more depth of character than meets the eye.
