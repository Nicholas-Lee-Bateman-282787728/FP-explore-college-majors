8235066,3,B000Z7G8CW,"I was a little disappointed at how dated this video is.  Of course the history of the country doesn't change but the production of the video is at least 10 years old ... and shows it.  I wanted to give my Chinese students a look at what Australia is like (my home) and I am too embarrassed to show it to them.  It misses out a lot of Australia that I think is the core of Australia.  For example, the rugged farming and country towns that each have their own character.  Instead the video focuses on the cities and some of the history of Australia.  The wildlife, the Great Barrier Reef and the beach life were also poorly represented.  Very disappointing...!",1275696000,3,659,4.396694214876033
