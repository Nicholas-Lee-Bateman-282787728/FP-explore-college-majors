1665995,5,B00005UO7R,"This is the first two part episode of Farscape, and it is one packed with Farscape drama and action at its best.  The show opens not long after the events of the previous episode, ""A Bug's Life"".  It turns out that Aeryn Sun's injury is worse than first expected, and without a vital nerve transplant, she will die in a matter of days.  To save her, John Crichton seeks a transplant at the only available source within reach-a Peacekeeper base.  Impersonating a Peacekeeper, and with some distraction provided by Chiana, Crichton infiltrates the base to get the transplant.  While there, he meets an old friend who gives him a hand in getting what he needs.  But Crichton is discovered by the Peacekeepers, and comes face to face with a new enemy far more dangerous than any before encountered by Crichton and crew--Scorpius.  Now, Crichton's comrades must struggle to save Aeryn from death, and Crichton from the hands of Scorpius.
All of this unfolds in a two part adventure with plenty of action, suspense, drama, and twists to keep you on the edge of your seat.  With this two part adventure, Farscape's excellence reaches a new level.",1008892800,8,1139,4.775510204081633
1665996,5,B00005UO7R,"Poor John Crichton. Up to now he's had to evade a crazed Peace Keeper Captain hellbent on revenge. What could happen next? How about a cold calculating alien villian trying to torture Crichton into divulging the secrets of how to make a wormhole.
A two part episode that introduces Scorpius, John Crichton's new antagonist, and Stark- a banek slave. Two of the best episodes of the first season. They set into motion much of the storyline for the 2nd season. The first ep starts with Aeryn dying from a wound she sustained in A BUG'S LIFE. John is forced to go down to a PK gammek base and try to procure the treatment to heal her. He's joined in this dangerous mission by the seductive Chiana. They run into a past aquaintance in a PK tech named Gilina. She obtains the needed cure for Officer Sun, but John is discovered shortly after. The 2nd part deals with the base's commander, Scorpius, suspecting that Crichton is a spy puts him in the ""chair"". The chair is a memory extraction device that rips the memories from your head and shows them on a viewer. In the interrogation, Scorpy discovers Crichton too is involved with wormholes.
The combination of the calm malevolence of Scorpius and the crazed almost manic cellmate of Crichton's, Stark, create a wonderful contrast of characters. A must have for the Scaper fans out there.",1008460800,3,1335,4.685106382978724

7954887,5,B00005UO7R,"This was the best two parter episode leading up to the final cliff hanger, Crighton's attempt to infiltrate a top secret Gammak base goes awry when he encounters an adversary far more ruthless and dangerous than Crais.., Scorpius.

The introduction of Wayne Pygram was a nice touch portraying the chilling Scarren half breed Scorpius that would pursue and torment the crew of Moya through seasons to come.., I rate this as one of my favorite episodes of season one.",1339372800,,465,4.886075949367089
7954888,4,B00005UO7R,"in these episodes we are introduced to a new villian, who will be a thorn in Crichton's side for the next 2 seasons, named Scorpious.  He is obsessed with having worm-hole technology which he plans to use as the ultimate weapon in the universe.

upon hearing that Crichton has this knowledge stored in his subconscious, he then tortures John with the Aurora Chair.  This chair is able to pull short and long term memories from its victims.

Unfortunately for Scorpious, this attempt is unsuccessful and John and the crew escape back to Moya from the peace-keeper planet below.",1287446400,,576,4.846938775510204
7954889,5,B00005UO7R,"""Nerve"" and ""The Hidden Memory"" are a two-part story that gathers together the various plot threads of the Farscape story and launches some ambitious story arcs that will figure prominently for the remainder of the series.  Crichton (Ben Browder) and Chiana (Gigi Edgley) infiltrate a Peacekeeper base to obtain genetic material that is necessary to save Aeryn's (Claudia Black) life while the remainder of the crew remains aboard Moya to attend the birth of her child.  Crichton falls into the clutches of Scorpius (Wayne Pygram), a hybrid being working with the Peacekeepers who is determined to rip the secret of wormhole technology from his mind.

The biggest development here is the introduction of Scorpius, who deserves to be ranked among the great villains of science fiction.  Other new characters introduced in this pivotal story are Stark (Paul Goddard), the former slave, and Talon, Moya's unique offspring.  This is Farscape at its best, which means this is television at its best.",1117238400,,994,5.1875
7954890,4,B00005UO7R,"Farscape was a mixed bag during the first season; the best episodes rank with anything produced by the Trek franchise or Babylon 5. What made Farscape unique is the quirky sense of humor at the core of every episode. It's the first series since Tom Baker's Dr. Who era to wink at the audience while serving and exciting premise or boots to the floor action episodes for dinner.
Both episodes feature Scorpi and Nerve in particular stands out during the first season. The premise is borrowed from an old Trek episode; Scorpi has a device that allows him to see inside the mind and pick apart the psyche of whomever is strapped into its chair. Unfortunately, Crichton becomes victim # 2 when Scorpi discovers that Crichton has wormhole technology buried in his brain by an alien race.
Never and The Hidden Memory are among the best two part episodes produced for the series. The writing is sharp and the dialog witty. I'd recommend either episode as a fine taste of the Farscape universe which has, sadly,gone on to rerun heaven.",1053475200,3,1027,4.711111111111111
7954891,5,B00005UO7R,"It's really nice to be able to stay up-to-date with our favorite television shows as they are now while still being able to look back from time to time.  Right now, as FARSCAPE enters its fourth season, I still enjoy going back and watching the old DVDs.  Each one has something excellent to offer; volume 10 has a LOT of excellent stuff to offer.
The Sci-Fi channel's FARSCAPE series distinguished itself by taking a solid (if rather common) concept of an astronaut from the present thrown across the universe into a strange galaxy inhabited by even stranger lifeforms and drenching the entire series with character, creativity, and charm.  Episodes ""Nerve"" and ""The Hidden Memory"" help to not only continue this tradition but mark a major turning point in the series for characters and plot-lines.
For those who haven't yet seen the previous episodes, the basic story is this: meet John Crichton.  John has been having a bunch of pretty bad days since his flight of the NASA spacecraft Farscape 1 where he was sucked through a wormhole into an interstellar battle halfway across the universe.  After a few unfortunate mishaps (whoops, didn't mean to crash into that ship and send it spiralling into that asteroid - no, siree), Crichton finds himself the target of the Peacekeepers (a collection of tyrants, closely physically resembling humans, seeking to extend their control over the galaxy) and one Peacekeeper Captain Crais, seeking vengeance for Crichton's accidental killing of his brother (the pilot whose ship spiralled into the asteroid).  He takes up ship with a group of escaped convicts: the Worf-esque Luxan warrior D'Argo, the Delvian (and very blue - literally) anarchist priest Zhaan, the deposed Hynerian ruler Rygel, and the outcast Peacekeeper Aeryn.
Flash forward to this episode.  After an unfortunate incident in the previous episode during which Aeryn received a Peacekeeper knife to the ribs, Crichton notices a sharp downturn in her condition - namely, her vomiting blood and coming very close to death.  The only way to save her is to infiltrate a hidden Peacekeeper base and bring back a tissue sample.  After arriving, Crichton finds himself involved with former love intrest Gilina (from episode 7, ""PK Tech Girl"") and the utterly evil Scorpius, the leader of the base.  Of course, Crichton soon finds himself in a lot of trouble, thus establishing Scorpius as the new supreme villain of FARSCAPE.
The story works out superbly, thanks in part to the signature directing of FARSCAPE (unorthodox, but very effective) and the superb acting that the cast is able to pull off, once again.  Ben Browder (as Crichton) adds his usual genius and personality to the role, proving once again that the Emmys far too often overlook certain actors; Wayne Pygram, playing the role of the seclusive and almost frightening Scorpius, does a fine job playing a character that many others would downright fail at.  Lani Tupu later enters as Crais, managing to put in even more hatred that usual and making his role even more convincing than it usually is.  All of this is held together by great writing: Crais is hate-crazed, Scorpius is the ultimate thinking villain, and Crichton has all the usual one-liners and wisecracks.  What more could you want?
The price of the DVD may seem a bit high to some for only two episodes, but these ones are definitely worth your time.  If you enjoy science fiction at all, you owe it to yourself to take a look at this one.",1024617600,6,3472,4.941580756013746
7954892,4,B00005UO7R,"As we reach the end of the first season of FARSCAPE in the DVD releases, one has to wonder what the future of the line of DVDs will bring, now that the folks at ADV are once more going to add all sorts of new features to future FS DVDs.  This second to last DVD of the first season hasn't got any real special features on it, but includes two terrific episodes that form the first two-part story in FARSCAPE's history.
The first episode, ""Nerve,"" finds John Crichton and Chiana travelling to the Gammak based mentioned in the previous episode, ""A Bug's Life,"" to seek a tissue graft for Aeryn, who is dying of the injury inflicted on her by Larraq.  Crichton's chance encounter with a scientist by the name of Scorpius leads to his being captured and interrogated in the Aurora Chair, and even the arrival of Crais doesn't diminish the threat to Crichton from this new, implacable foe.  However Crichton is not without his allies on the base, but it is still a race against time to save Aeryn's life.  And back on Moya, it is found that the Leviathan is getting close to giving birth.
""The Hidden Memory"" continues this two-part story with Crichton still in Scorpius's grasp.  With the now partially recovered Aeryn leading a rescue mission to save Crichton, things are complicated by the birth of Moya's offspring and a surprising revelation about it, and Crais's falling into Scorpius's hands after a surprise is pulled on the two of them by one of Crichton's allies.
These are two superb episodes that form a nice whole, although the story is marred by a lack of the potential of ""Nerve"" being lived up to by ""The Hidden Memory.""  The new character of Stark is one who will have repercussions down the road obviously, and the additional footage in both episodes adds to the overall story and clarifies a few matters in both cases.  The Profile on Wayne Pygram (Scorpius) is a terrific addition to the DVD, and brings to light some of the hidden depths of the character, as well as showing the actor sans makeup.  These two episodes raise the stakes in FARSCAPE, and lead into the final pair of first season episodes.  This DVD would have been tremendously enhanced by any form of commentary episodes or other extra material (the character Profile just isn't enough), but the high quality of the DVD and the two superb episodes on this one make this a good and worthy addition to any FARSCAPE fan's collection.",1016582400,2,2412,4.629976580796253
7954893,5,B00005UO7R,"I must say up front that I am a true Farscape fan. The first year's episode have been my favorite. These two episodes are where things really started to come together for the entire cast. It's great to see the cast so inter-twined with each other in this release. I can watch this episode over and over again and not get tired of it.
You won't be disappointed. Even if you have yet to watch a farscape episode, or are not a huge Sci-Fi fan you will love this release. Don't miss out by not seeing this great episode.",1014336000,,516,4.222222222222222
7954894,5,B00005UO7R,"Continuing to push the envelope of science fiction today, Volume 10 of ""Farscape"" brings us, perhaps, the best two episodes thus far - as well as the first two-parter.  Dealing with themes of loss, vengeance, torture, desperation and obsession, we are brought into the realm of the Peacekeepers for yet another necessitated undercover mission for Crichton.
As Crichton goes to a Peacekeeper base to retrieve a tissue sample necessary to save Aeryn's life in the wake of their last tangle with the Peacekeepers (in Volume 9), he meets up with his would-be love interest from ""PK Tech Girl"" (in Volume 4) and has everything blow up in his face just as he seems to be escaping, for once, with his skin intact.  Bringing into the story a new recurring villain - Scorpius, arguably the nastiest villain ""Farscape"" has produced yet - as well as the never-far-behind General Crais and the again-problematic wormhole question, this episode manages to weave together elements from the entire season while leaving a half-open ending that has me, at least, wanting to see Season 2 as soon as possible.
On the technical side, ADV Films has done their usual quality work with the video and audio transfer.  The extras continue in the theme of previous discs: conceptual art, an image gallery, a computer ""Farscape"" screensaver and a video profile - this time for the man that plays Scorpius.  It would have been nice if ADV would have continued putting a commentary track on this disc as they did with the earlier ones, but it's still a solid disc nonetheless.
""Farscape"" has become one of the most interesting (both visually and plot-wise) series on television today.  It continues to build on it's established stories while giving away answers to questions in, at best, small chunks.  These two episodes are absolutely wonderful and I, for one, and happy to add them to my collection.  If you're looking to get into the series, go back to the  first disc, but if you're already hooked, definitely don't miss this installment.",1011657600,,2014,4.902941176470589
