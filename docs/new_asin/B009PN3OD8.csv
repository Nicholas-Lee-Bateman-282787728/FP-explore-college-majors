5360519,5,B009PN3OD8,"I'll leave the reviews of the films themselves to other people, as I am a HUGE Bond fan so I love them all, but I will tell you what's on the discs. The set features 'Moonraker,' 'For Your Eyes Only,' and 'Octopussy,' and it's disc one only of the two-disc Ultimate Edition sets that came out in 2008. Unfortunately, the second discs were the ones with all the bonus features like theatrical trailers, radio spots, and documentaries, but disc one does contain audio commentaries. 'Moonraker' has 2 commentaries, one with Sir Roger Moore, and one with director Lewis Gilbert and members of the cast and crew. 'For Your Eyes Only' has 3, one with Moore, one with director John Glen and members of the cast, and one with Michael G. Wilson and crew members. And 'Octopussy' has 2, one with Moore, and one with director John Glen. The picture and sound for all three movies are fantastic. If the bells and whistles aren't that important to you, this is a great way to pick up three of Sir Roger's best.",1358553600,23,997,4.544444444444444

5360533,5,B009PN3OD8,"When I first saw MOONRAKER I remember that it really broke my heart. I grew up in the 60s on James Bond and Sean Connery amongst others. The first 45 minutes of MOONRAKER was the closest that the Roger Moore Bonds had ever come to the look and feel of the James Bond films of the 60s. It was really incredible. Equally incredible was how the film did a flip-flop into slapstick when Bond is floating down that canal in Venice. As the film progressed the level of slapstick escalated. It was just plain out ridicules. The film was very annoying. I thought Roger Moore had finally combined his best qualities as a personality and an actor to represent James Bond in this film. His scene in the centrifuge showed his ability to bring depth to the character in a very credible way. This one scene is a standout because it equals any performance given by any of the actors that have portrayed James Bond in this series. Christopher Wood, given sole screenplay credit this time, delivered a script full of witty dialogue. The free-fall pre-credit sequence with John Barry's background score, incredible stunt work and cinematography was excellent. With so many fine elements at their peak of perfection it was a shame that the film unraveled in so many different directions. When I saw this film on opening day I remembered how the whole lobby was crammed with people. As I sat during the film I remember a little boy who was sitting in front of me turn around and look at his father. ""Daddy I really like this movie."" I never forgot that. It took me about 10 years to understand what this film was really all about. The Bond films have been around for almost 40 years now. I suppose with each decade another generation of Bond fans is born. Each generation takes with them the fond memories of their introduction to James Bond. Each generation savors the moment and no matter what I or anyone else says is going to erase those memories. The magic of MOONRAKER is that it contains the best to the worst, or the worst to the best, of all the elements found in the series. There is something in MOONRAKER for everyone.
FOR YOUR EYES ONLY is filled with stunt, after stunt, after stunt obliterates this film's attempt to return the James Bond series to its original origins. Roger Moore gives a competent performance as 007 but the physical stunts that he is supposedly performing defy credibility. It is interesting how the level of physical stunts that James Bond is required to perform increases proportionally with Roger Moore's age with each new film. The first two thirds of the film are good. However, the film falls asleep in the third. When you've seen one impregnable mountaintop fortress, you've seen 'em all. Bill Conti's disco score actually helped this film along the way giving it some energy and drive. It is in the final third of the film that Conti returns to a more traditional orchestral scoring which only contributed to the anti climatic finale. The sinking of the St. Georges, the attack on Kristatos' warehouse and Bond kicking Locque's car, with Locque still inside, off the cliff were high points that were excellently filmed.
OCTOPUSSY is probably Roger Moore's best Bond movie. It seems like a throwback to the 60s style of filmmaking. The pace is slower and deliberate and the dialogue seems to have more subtle wit interspersed. It has an overall nostalgic feel about it. The opening is excellent as we see Bond the spy infiltrate a banana republic air base. Bond escapes via a Bede Acrostar mini jet aircraft with a guided missile in hot pursuit. The score by John Barry is a little vague. The action scenes he scored didn't have his old punch. It was like he was in a transitional state. He scored the early scenes very well and they had that unique Bond sound that he used to bring to the earlier films. As the film progressed the score seemed to become repetitious and tedious. He did do a good job scoring the scenes involving the Soviets, which had that eastern block flavor similar to his score for ""The Quiller Memorandum."" To its credit, the film uses elements from the short stories ""Octopussy"" and ""The Property of a Lady"" by Ian Fleming in a sentimental throwback to earlier Bonds. ""For Your Eyes Only"" filmed just before this one, also used some of Fleming's original writings for inspiration. In that one Bond as the shark bate in-tow was taken directly from Fleming's novel ""Live and Let Die."" Louis Jourdan as Kamal, in a very underrated performance, is excellent and is one of the best villains of the series. He is Bond's counterpart nemesis. It was also good to see many of the regular cast members return for this one. Desmond Llewelyn as ""Q"" seemed to return to his old self prior to ""Diamonds Are Forever."" Walter Gotell as Gogol, Geoffrey Keen as the Minister of Defense, Eva Reuber-Staier as Rublevitch, Jeremy Bullock as Smithers and Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny all reprised their roles much more effectively and reminiscent to the style of the earlier Bonds. Robert Brown replaced Bernard Lee as the beloved ""M."" We all missed Bernard. The film goes a little over-the-top near the end having Octopussy's troupe of beautiful amazons attack Kamal's Monsoon Palace. Then the film really goes over-the-top and under-the-top as Bond crawls all over Kamal's Beechcraft Model 18 Super H18 as it dives, loops and tailspins. I don't see anything wrong with that.",1381622400,,5404,4.71957671957672
5360534,4,B009PN3OD8,"Three movies in this package:
Moonraker- For Your Eyes Only- Octopussy
The display aspect ratio is quite wide screen, which I don't care for much but the movies themselves are standard Bond fare with Roger Moore.
Personally, Moonraker was not all that good but with most Bond movies, even an average movie has interesting parts.
The color and picture quality is good on these DVDs.",1375315200,4,381,4.876923076923077
