5064125,1,B00798MFA4,After watching this i am not impressed. The mysterious lights are i think a crew member with a flashlight nothing more and the e.v.p.s sound distinctly electronic to me.,1331769600,3,169,4.862068965517241

8512596,1,B00798MFA4,Sucks. Bugs flying around are not ghosts!!!!,1462233600,,44,5.428571428571429
8512597,1,B00798MFA4,Not what I expected at all. The description makes it sound so much more intriguing and dramatic. Neither word would I use to describe this show. It is very boring!!! It's hard to see as it is so dark and it appears as though the host is trying not to wake the dead because he WHISPERS the whole time and this low toned whispering makes it very hard to hear and thus harder to enjoy at all. I only made it half way through before I  couldn't take it anymore! I actually turned it off halfway through.  Watching  this show made me feel like I was back in college and my boring biology lecture course. Honestly it's not even worth $2.99.,1447977600,2,634,4.223140495867769

8512599,2,B00798MFA4,"Ack.  Yet another poorly shot and poorly edited ""reality"" paranormal film.  I should know by now, but I am always hopeful that one of these types of films will finally and definitively catch paranormal activity.  Not this time.",1417046400,2,227,4.921052631578948
8512600,3,B00798MFA4,"The wife and I will watch almost anything spooky.  This had its moments.  Overall, the $2 price tag for 44 or so minutes wasn't worth it...",1376611200,4,139,4.3076923076923075
8512601,2,B00798MFA4,...but too much talking and repeating what where and when they are going to get down to business. Don't care for it.,1371081600,4,116,4.318181818181818
8512602,5,B00798MFA4,"The Washington paranormal research group really should have their own show. Just remember it's not all edited and fancy like TV, this is real. Amazing evidence. Must see!!",1364169600,,171,5.142857142857143
8512603,1,B00798MFA4,"Very short, not informative stayed on one thing way too long, did not hold our interest. Need to go a little more indepth guys.",1361923200,3,127,4.333333333333333
8512604,1,B00798MFA4,"I would like to start off by saying that I'm a believer in the paranormal and will challenge any that try to say otherwise. However, several things irked me about this video:

Firstly, it's ""dilapidated"" not ""decapitated"". This is the second time I've heard you mix up the words. They do not have the same meaning, sir.

Secondly, it's ""tries"" not ""trys"". Spell check is your friend.

Thirdly, those are clearly bugs zooming around in the air above the gravestone. Not orbs. And I'm almost 100% certain, that ball of light you were filming at the end was someone playing around with a flashlight. It looks exactly the same and is exactly round and the height of someone standing in the brush with a flashlight. But I'm sure some people were fooled.

Fourthly, the voices you always seem to capture either sound like someone using a voice manipulator which I am quite familiar with seeing as I was just listening to my friend use one over a video he was streaming. They sound exactly the same as do all your ""EVP's"". A couple in this video sound electronic like almost sounding like a robot.

Fifthly, the fact you're like ""it's not bugs, there's no bugs out here"". I mean, what? You're outside.. of course there's bugs! And to say the howling sounds like a werewolf. Umm, could it perhaps be a wolf? Just a little bit maybe? If not, a coyote maybe? Oh yea, you said no to things. That must mean you're an animal expert, huh? Cuz you're certainly not a paranormal expert.",1341532800,2,1470,4.553030303030303
