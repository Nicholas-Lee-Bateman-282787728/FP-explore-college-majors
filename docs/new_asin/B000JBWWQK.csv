2667660,4,B000JBWWQK,"The 1991-92 season,the sixth of Fox's Emmy-winning Married...With Children,begins with the pregnancies of Peggy Bundy(Katey Sagal) and Marcy Rhoades D'Arcy(Amanda Bearse). Sagal's real-life pregnancy was written into the show and unfortunately,she miscarried. She did have children by her now-ex-husband Jack White,though. Peggy did miscarry with her and her husband Al's(Ed O'Neill) third child. The child would have enjoyed(to a degree) a good life with his/her siblings Kelly(Christina Applegate) and Bud(David Faustino). Kelly and Bud lambasted Al for impregnating Peggy against her preference. On September 8,1991 when this season began,Marcy and her second husband Jefferson(Happy Days veteran Ted McGinley) had been married for nine or ten months. Marcy did contemplate having children with her first husband Steve Rhoades. McGinley is now an official MWC cast member. He joined MWC in late 1990 but on a frequent guest star basis. However,McGinley's inaugural appearance on the show was in the season 4 episode IT'S A BUNDYFUL LIFE. For the first time since his final appearance as a regular in the season 4 episode ROCK AND ROLL GIRL,David Garrison as Steve Rhoades,makes a guest appearance in THE EGG & I. Accountant-turned-forest ranger Steve is wanted by the FBI for stealing a rare hawk egg. He hides out in his old neighborhood amongst the Bundys' home and his ex-wife's home. Also,although he called it quits on his marriage to Marcy,Steve intended to reclaim her,not knowing she had remarried. Marcy was far from enthused about Steve's visit and he and Jefferson fight a duel. The Bundys witness the duel and a camera is in Peggy's hands. The Bundys were surprised by Steve's visit as well. But Steve is caught and taken into police custody. In the season finale,the Bundys travel to England. The other episodes are great. Al still manages his shoe store,Peggy still is a lowly mobile housewife,Kelly is working various jobs and attending college and Bud is doing the same as Kelly. The late briard Buck is still like Peggy,lowly mobile(he was by this time elderly and died before the series ended). This season has a mostly new opening montage(personal scenes for almost every cast member). And in the closing montage,Al and Peggy are still sitting on their sofa. This montage has been used since the beginning of 1990. Six down,five to go.",1162252800,3,2357,5.221635883905013
2667661,5,B000JBWWQK,"You might be asking ""Does it still have the substituted theme song?"", and unfortunately it still does but, that shouldn't stop you from purchasing this amazing dvd set. The episodes are the uncut, non-syndicated versions so that is something to be happy about. This is a great season and includes one of Married...With Children's best three-part episodes, ""The England Show."" Just those three episodes are worth the price alone.

This season features hilarious cameos from other celebrities and past cast members such as David Garrison (Steve Rhoades) in ""The Egg And I.""

This is also the season where Peg and Marcy were supposed to have babies at the same time but, since Katey Sagal (Peg), who was actually pregnant in real life suffered a miscarriage. The show later decided that they wouldn't want to use a stand-in baby (as she wanted to use her real baby in the show) and, that is why the season had to use the ""it's all a dream"" idea (borrowed from the show Dallas). The show was already good in the past five seasons but, this is the season where the show really got going. This set will keep you laughing for hours and you will want to watch these episodes ever and ever again. It's good that fans of the show are able to quit watching those old VHS recordings and finally view the episodes in the clarity which they were originally shown. Lastly, if you have seasons 1-5 already, don't hesistate to order this right away.  If you've managed to make it through my entire review, I thank you very much and hope that you enjoy Married...With Children as much as I do!!!",1160956800,55,1577,4.625

2667740,4,B000JBWWQK,I have always loved this show. Glad to own it and not have to sit through a ton of commercials.  The only down side is the crappy theme music.  The producers lost the rights to the original theme music somehow and the music they replaced it with is HORRIBLE. I usually fast forward through it but if you are watching episodes back to back that can be disruptive and quite annoying.,1357430400,,381,4.352112676056338

2667742,3,B000JBWWQK,"I love love love Married...with Children. I think it was one of the most intelligent - humor wise -  (in the beginning at least) and most hilarious shows to ever air on US TV. It is vulgar, sexist, chauvinists and totally un-PC and filled with a hilarious and super talented cast. There is just something so delicious and wicked about a family that is so decrepit and dysfunctional and rotten and of course Al Bundy, the eternal loser who is still a winner in our hearts. I have loved all seasons thus far but Season 6 unfortunately is weak. That whole Peggy and Marcy becoming pregnant thing and holding those baby meetings and saluting the baby was annoying. Most of the episodes are about that and it just got old.",1305072000,,717,4.515384615384615

Since then...I've purchased OTHER seasons of ""Married With Children"" for Birthday, Valentine's Day, Easter, etc....,  & HOPE to COMPLETE the collection by this next Christmas. He just LOVES watching these OLD episodes, & tells me how much he laughs at them & how they bring back memories of he & I watching them together.

2667745,4,B000JBWWQK,"Married with Children - The Complete Sixth Season in my opinion was the last enjoyable for this long-running sitcom. Katey Sagel was pregnant so the writers decided to make her character Peggy pregnant as well. It was a good idea but tradegy struck and Sagel had a miscarriage so the whole pregnancy thing was turned into a dream/nightmare sequence. After that this show really lost steam, season 7 was a mess and I never watched the remaining seasons, the magic was gone. Season 6 had some special episodes so I recommend this raunchy gem, enjoy!",1246752000,,547,4.768421052631579

2667768,5,B000JBWWQK,"This 1991-92 Season of Married With Children is a great DVD and I recommend it to any Bundys fan or viewer, but they still should have used the ""Love & Marriage"" song by Frank Sinatra like they originally used when ""Married With Children"" was on FOX.

The Bundys 6th Season is also the season when Jefferson D'Arcy(Ted McGinley) becomes a full-time co-star on Married With Children and the season when Marcy's ex-husband Steve Rhoades(Dave Garrison) tries to reunite with Marcy(Amanda Bearse) while being on the run from the FBI, plus this is the first and only season with a 3-parted episode, such as the 6th Season Finale episode when the Bundys win a vacation to London and get lost in England while they're at it.

In addition, ANTHRAX does a cameo appearance at the Bundy's house in this season as well when Kelley(Christina Applegate)and Bud(Dave Faustino) win a prize and sports celebrities Sugar Ray Leonard and Big Joe do a cameo appearance in the episode when Al(Edward O'Neill)gets hired to be the fall guy for a Zeus shoe commercial for Super Bowl Sunday, except Al doesn't even end up being shown on the commercials and gets too hurt in the process.

Kelley gets her own show in this season, but ends up getting fired when the show flops and cancels.

This season also takes me all the way back to memory lane to the recession we had back in 1992-1993 when George Bush, Sr. was the president along with the fact that I was 19 years old and living in my hometown(El Centro, CA)at the time when the Bundy's 6th Season was running on FOX.

In the meantime, I can hardly wait till the Bundy's 11th Season gets released on DVD this Fall since I just got word that Married With Children's 1996-97 Season is now scheduled to be released October 13th, 2009.",1200528000,,1762,4.616613418530352

2667770,4,B000JBWWQK,"The cast members and story lines are funny. However, the treatment of the story often contains raunchy elements and is definitely not suitable for children.

2667771,5,B000JBWWQK,this dvd is hilarious. True the changed the original song. BUT THE EPISODES ARE HILARIOUS. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE.,1191542400,,126,5.0476190476190474
2667772,1,B000JBWWQK,"I will never--for as long as I live--buy anything else from Amazon.  Amazon is being sued by the Humane Society for selling dogfighting DVDs and cockfighting magazines.  Had I known this when I made the purchase, I would have bought Married With Children DVDs from another vendor.  Animal fighting is heinous and totally unacceptable, not to mention illegal.  There is no way I'd ever give Amazon my business knowing that profiting from animal cruelty is more important to the company than doing the right thing.",1188000000,4,512,4.988235294117647
2667773,3,B000JBWWQK,I can't stand this series.  It's ridiculous and stupid but it's my husband favorite comedy series ever.  He loves it and will watch the reruns over and over.  He recorded just about all the episodes off the tv onto vcr tapes when they first aired but the tapes are wearing out and we've had to discard some tapes since they were not longer viewable.  He can't wait for the next season to be released and keeps asking when it will be.  The last one released was in December 06.  Isn't it about time for a new season to be released.

It's sad if you know the full story behind Katey Sagal's pregnancy, and it sucks that she's missing from a few of the episodes because of it.

2667789,4,B000JBWWQK,"This is probably the only season (along with the final season) that'll receive mixed reactions to both fans and critics. While the Anthrax & England episodes were good, Peggy's pregnancy was just unrealistic.

But flaws aside, this is still one of the funniest sitcoms ever to be put on air. Sure the humor is almost always crude, but that's what makes it so good. The Bundys are absolutely hilarious. Al's shattered dreams and Peggy's stupendous carelessness are the highlights for almost every episode. Kelly's low intelligence and Bud's failing love life completes the dysfunctional family. And let's not forget their neighbors: the chicken-legged Marcy, and the charming but unemployed Jefferson, and (from the earlier seasons) the one-and-only Steve.

Undoubtedly, everybody knows about Married with Children, so let's skip that bit, and get right down to why this labels as my favourite season so far.

One of my favourite Bundy storylines has always been them being brought to the UK, in a desperate attempt to dispel a witch's curse. Well, folks, that's this season.

However, my absolute favourite episode ever is where Jefferson and Al try putting together a ""Handyman's Workbench 5000"" (some assembly required).

There's some other beauts in this season as well, but these four would be my favourites.

2667794,3,B000JBWWQK,"This was the beginning of the end as far as I am concerned. I loved this show through the fifth season, and even though I bought this one, it will surely be viewed far less often. I actually never had a problem with Ted McGinley, as others do, but the repetition of the same old lines, starts to wear on me this season. The first several episodes revolve around the baby thing,........and all the ""hail baby"" stuff really gets to be stupid. The 3 part episode of the England trip, was equally stupid to me. You always know when a show is going downhill, when they take the cast to another country or on an exotic vacation,.........they have all done that theme. This was also the season that Bud starts to act like a total moron, with all the ""Grand Master B"" stuff, and the MANY variations of the name. Last but not least,.......by six seasons, the constant hunt for bits of food, and cheese from mousetraps to eat gets too repetitive for me. One would think that talented writers could have come up with a few new ideas, with such a talented cast. I always loved Al to the end, but this will most likelybe the last season that I purchase. Oh gee,.......we have the stupid ""little kid"" coming up before long, forgot his name, but whoever thought of that gimmick, must have been on drugs! It was a great show though, and the first five will probably be worn out in my DVD player!",1170201600,9,1379,4.390625
2667795,5,B000JBWWQK,"Married With Children is an awesome, funny show that consistently aims at grabbing the audience with every little biting remark or gesture.  Its crudeness is what puts it above many of the shows today and will always be unique in that the humor is in a class all by itself.  My husband can watch this show every night and is obsessed with the hilarity of it all.  I just wish they would release the rest of the seasons as soon as possible so that my husband can enjoy the rest of the series.  The 6th Season is another Classic Year and should be added to anyone's collection who likes crude humor with a wacky family and neighbors to boot!

2667809,5,B000JBWWQK,This is a great DVD for all Bundy fans. All the characters get funnier and the episodes are some of the best. This is the season where Peg and Marcy are pregnant which drives Al and Jefferson crazy. Sadly that plot line had to be changed after Ms. Sagal experienced health problems. This set offers the three part London adventure and the two part Kelly does Hollywood episodes. Both are side splitting comedy. Kelly seems to get even dumber and Bud more actively pursues the fairer sex. This series seemed to get better and better even through the last season. I can't wait for season 7.,1167782400,,588,4.556603773584905
2667810,5,B000JBWWQK,"Every time I see Mr. O'Neill portray Al Bundy I ALWAYS crack up! He did such an excellent job as Al Bundy, he shoulda won an Emmy! But I can understand why he didn't...the Awards Academy is made up of snobs who considered ""Married-With Children"" to be too lowbrow and ""beneath"" them. Well, a pox on those tools! This was and still is a hilarious program!

Katey Sagal should be commended for this sixth season; she suffered a miscarriage (her pregnancy caused the first few shows to center around a new Bundy baby; the plotline was eliminated and explained away as part of Al's dream) yet when she returned to the show, she was the Peg Bundy character with no signs of depression or sadness. What a trouper! She deserves high praise for getting back in character as professionally as she did.

Bud's ""Grandmaster B"" persona is also a darn funny addition to the show; if this bit was tried on some other TV show it wouldn't work - but here it does and it's very funny!

Now, on to Ted McGinley. I think he's been treated unfairly in reviews; I find his character of Jefferson to be a fresh addition to the show! He's a criminal, a huckster, a cad and he secretly despises his wife, Marcy; his facial expressions behind her back crack me up; he's a good rabble-rousing partner for Al! David Garrison's role as Marcy's first husband Steve was good too, but McGinley fills Garrison's shoes well as a whole different, funny character.

I never get tired of watching this show, no matter what season. I hope they release the remaining seasons in a more frequent schedule!",1167350400,9,1565,4.5587188612099645
2667811,3,B000JBWWQK,"I'm still on the fence as to whether or not I want to buy the sixth season of this show.  Married With Children was my favorite show up to this point and the sixth season is where the series began its decline, which was shortly after the departure of David Garrison.  Ted McGinnley's ""pretty boy"" character just didn't jibe well with Al Bundy the way Steve Rhoades did.  I think I'll stick with my five seasons of this show for now.",1167177600,5,432,4.308641975308642
2667812,4,B000JBWWQK,"This season is great, no doubt. Al Bundy is truly an American hero. Anyone who can put up with what he does and not eat a bullet deserves a standing ovation, which the live audience gives him this season when he walks in the door bellowing ""A fat woman oozed into the shoe store today.."" Ed O'Neil is a great actor, as are the rest of the family. I love how he uses old-fashioned highbrow grammar one minute, then proudly picks his ear wax and shows it to Peg the next. Who else can drop a bird from mid-air just by taking off his shoes? Nothing else on television today is remotely as good as Married With Children, not even Family Guy. There are only two things I would change, and that's get the REAL Sinatra music back, and include some extras on the DVD's. I would LOVE to see some bloopers from the show; I have never seen any. For these two things I have taken off one star, but for just the show itself, it deserves 5 stars.",1166659200,3,932,4.183333333333334
2667813,4,B000JBWWQK,"Learn what it takes to being a member of the Bundy family with ""Married... with Children: The Complete Sixth Season"". ""Married... with Children"" is the outrageously funny comedy sitcom that changed our view of the typical family comedy. The comedy series follows the lives of luckless shoe salesman Al Bundy (Ed O'Neill), his dysfunctional family and his bothersome next-door neighbors. In this hilarious sixth season, the announcement of Peg's (Katey Sagal) pregnancy leaves the family in shock and forces Al to run away from home. Kelly (Christina Applegate) lands her own talk show and goes to Hollywood. Bud (David Faustino) tries to impress women with the help of his hip-hop alter-ego Grandmaster B. In the three-part season finale, the Bundys win a free trip to England but are unaware that some vengeful villagers seek to get rid of all male Bundys to break a curse cast upon their village. The sixth season marks star Amanda Bearse's directorial dbut on the show and the brief return of David Garrison as Steve Rhoades. It also includes guest stars like Jon Lovitz, Traci Lords, Fred Willard, Steve Carlton, Ed ""Too Tall"" Jones and Sugar Ray Leonard.

Though the sixth season of ""Married with Children: The Complete Sixth Season"" will certainly leave you laughing for hours, this 3-disc DVD set is certainly nothing to rave about. All 26 hilarious episodes of the sixth season are presented in their original full screen format. The picture quality is noticeably cleaner and sharper than your average television rebroadcast. Its simple 2.0 Dolby Digital sound is rather satisfactory. There are no bonus features included in this 3-disc DVD set. Though the lack of extras is certainly a big letdown, ""Married with Children: The Complete Sixth Season"" earns a decent ""B-"".",1166572800,4,1779,5.092465753424658
2667814,5,B000JBWWQK,I really Enjoyed this Season especially the Bundy Go To England Show where they meet  Former Goodies Star Bill Oddie who played Winston  his Performance was great :)  I've got it on Order  I've seen it on tv a few times  most early shows were great  I've seen the Reunion show  even Katy sagal said the show was Disgusting wonder why she didn't turn the part down :D,1166400000,3,366,4.294117647058823
2667815,5,B000JBWWQK,"This is the set I have been waiting for, my favorite season of one of my favorite shows.  The running ""Grandmaster B"" gag was hilarious, with all the ways the other characters got it wrong.  And its beginning, as a rip-off of ""The Fresh Prince of Bel Air"", cracks me up just thinking about it.",1166227200,2,293,4.3090909090909095
2667816,4,B000JBWWQK,This is the final season in which the show was great...the following seasons are all very mediocre....This season continues the trend that started in Season 5 of turning Al and the rest of the family into cartoon characters (as opposed to the first 4 seasons where the show relied on sharp edged humor) But the material is still strong enough to get by so the show does not become a parody of itself as it did in following seasons....,1162684800,9,434,4.506329113924051

8149509,3,B000JBWWQK,This was another great season of Married With Children.  Although it starts off with Peg being pregnant.  Which is kind of sad because she was really pregnant and had a miscarriage.  This has another one of my all time favorite episodes.  The two part Kelly Does Hollywood.  Which has  Denise Richards in a don't blink or you'll miss her role.  And the season ends with the three part England show.  Which is good to watch all at the same time.  Instead of one show over three nights.  Or over three weeks.  I would really like to have it without te credits between the episodes.  Have it more like a Bundy vacation movie.,1506643200,,622,4.455357142857143
