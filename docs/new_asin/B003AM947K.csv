4104214,1,B003AM947K,"Not impressed with the author and his attitudes about his religion. As far as Boteach's book, I'll quote a popular comedian about sex: ""Sex has it's ups and downs (sorry about that) but when sex is good, it's great, but when it's bad, it's still good."" Did I have to buy this book (-:",1424736000,,284,4.277777777777778
4104215,5,B003AM947K,I love this so much.  I tell everyone about it. Rabbi Shmuley is so great with relationships.  You can watch this even if you are not Jewish it is not religious but for all people of any or no faith.,1399680000,7,199,3.95
4104216,5,B003AM947K,"Don't let the name fool you, this is not a Jewish way of having sex !!  It is not a video on how to have sex !!!

What it is; is an open short lecture about the true meaning of relationships as they were meant to be and should be.  Being old fashion I could really relate to the discussion while wishing more people would watch this video or even read his book.

Rabbi Boteach has a very open, clean easy to understand talk with you and his audience about the raw nature of the way relationships should be and talks about the problem with marital relations in America. There is obviously a huge problem when a country has a very high divorce rate, and married couples only have relations twice a week for an average of 8 minutes. Rabbi Shmuley does a great job of offering solutions practiced by Jews for thousands of years.  Not being Jewish and even being single I found this to have many of the truths and values that I have and that so many are missing.

He also discusses the true meaning of relationships and what SHOULD matter most when we're in or looking to enter a relationship.  He speaks openly and honestly to everyone of every faith or to those with no faith, this is for everyone.

The DVD is educational, entertaining, insightful and inspiring. Highly recommend it!",1372982400,4,1281,4.421276595744681
4104217,5,B003AM947K,Accidently found this video but was worth the listen. Rabbi Boteach has a very interesting approach to this topic.  Spend the time watching it.,1362009600,,143,4.958333333333333

4104220,5,B003AM947K,"I have neither heard of these books or videos, but was curious after reading such stellar reviews.
Firstly,  I am a liberal ,Southern Baptist...no need to assume you should be Jewish to watch or read The Rabbi's stuff.
I have been married 27 years. I found this video not only candidly honest and uninhibited, but so incredibly accurate and loving.
I only wish I could get my husband to watch it now. The Rabbi describes such truths regarding love, romance and sex within a respectful relationship. I wish he were my husband!",1357344000,4,525,4.706521739130435

4104230,5,B003AM947K,He is so correct about why relationships are so broken.  We do get married with the idea that we want to have sex with only this one person for the rest of our lives to find ourselves swallowed up in unhappiness with sexless marriages trapped by raising children and every day the same as the next.  Not saying it is only the mans fault or only the woman's fault but lack of being taught the true meaning of marriage.  Kids grow up either in a broken home or saying they don't want a marriage like their parents had.  It truly is sad.,1471046400,,534,4.205882352941177

He is a thinker, and speaks intelligently. However, I realized he is a man-hater. And then I looked at the people in the audience, and they are mostly (all?) women.

In other words, he is a public speaker, speaking to his audience of women, telling them that they are great, that they are better than men, that all sexual problems come from problems in men, and that men need to continually make their women happy, or those women are justified in cheating.

I realize that a person can get very rich and famous by feeding people's egos, and that's all he's really doing. I just wish he didn't bring God into it, because God doesn't hate men.",1527465600,,743,4.488888888888889
