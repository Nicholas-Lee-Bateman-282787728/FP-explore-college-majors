6583418,5,B00MIYN5M6,"this film is a rare cinematic masterpiece. it is often eclipsed or overshadowed by the 1996 remake of the same title minus exclamation point. this awesome film from the 1950s is in this reviewer's opinion is superior to it's successor. upon initial release this little gem mostly disregarded and quite unjustly. it merits more credit than what has been given to it. the acting is great for the era and the premise or plot is engrossing and the mounting tension within the story is more than satisfying. this film delivers in every aspect. a definite must-see for every fan of the era. if you have seen the remake with Mel Gibson then you must see it's predecessor.

as for the dvd transfer: the picture is quite good. the audio could have been slightly better but still gratifying.",1414972800,4,781,4.700729927007299

6583421,2,B00MIYN5M6,"They don't make movies like this anymore. Thank God! The setting is middle America of 1956. Sexist stereotypes are in full bloom. The plot which creeks along concerns the aftermath of an eight year olds kidnapping on his family and the larger community. Glenn Ford plays the father who is a hard nose industrialist. He is the decision maker. He  makes the decision not pay the ransom. He does not need to discuss this with his wife, the mother, played by Donna Reed. because she goes to pieces in the crisis. Therefore she is given sedatives to keep her quiet and out of the way.  The scene where she is stumbling around on the dope. offers unintended comedy relief. Glenn Ford stands alone his decision is correct everyone else is wrong. The nonsense finally ends with the boy reunited with his family. I did not see Mel Gibson's remake but it could not have been worse than this turkey",1423958400,,887,4.572327044025157

6583424,4,B00MIYN5M6,"I really enjoy the drama of this movie and in particularly I like seeing Donna Reed at a different angle in her acting. She is know for ""The Donna Reed Show""  and ""It's a wonderful life."" She often plays roles like those, but to see some intense and dramatic acting on her part made this movie that much more interesting to me; in fact, that's what made the movie good to watch. The Story itself is also as if it could be ripe out of the headlines today. Children often get kidnapped. The viewer is seeing the effect it is having on the family and is left hoping for the best(the viewer is not sure, really, because if seen from today's view) it's entirely possible it will not turn out well, then the viewer is concerned about all the choices that have been made; will it help or hurt the outcome of the situation. All this adds to the building drama.
The Acting is well done by all. I think it is also a remake, but I find I like this version the best. If you like drama, You'll probably find some interest in this.",1422403200,,1017,4.2153846153846155

6583428,5,B00MIYN5M6,"RANSOM! is a film that should be a lot better known than it is today. Until recently the DVD was not available but I asked for it so many times that probably Warner released it just to get rid of me! With the great GLENN FORD, DONNA REED and LESLIE NIELSEN in the cast, you just can't go wrong. But the whole cast in this movie is tops, and the story keeps you interested from the beginning to the end. It was released in 1966, when the Beatles were at the tops of the charts. Glenn Ford is a master actor, always so natural in every role, never trying to overact or outshine anybody in the cast, a true great one! You may not only love this movie, but you may want to watch it again. I enjoy it every time, that's why I recommend it to you.",1416096000,,741,4.013513513513513

8672683,5,B00MIYN5M6,"This is a great film, a real thriller. It is very suspenseful. The plot will raise many questions in the minds of viewers, as it should.
Husband and wife, played excellently by Glenn Ford and Donna Reed, have an unusually good loving relationship with each other and with their son.  The husband is very successful in his business and highly respected in his community. He is able to run his company well because he is able to make good decisions.
His son is kidnapped and a $500,000 ransom is demanded. This was a huge sum in 1956 when the film was made. At first, he thinks he will pay because he loves his son greatly. But then he is told that there is no guarantee that the payment will assure that his son will be returned alive. He is told that if you pay to get your son back, you may or may not get him back alive. The same applies if you do not pay, you may or may not get him back alive.
He decides not to pay.  He goes on TV, addresses the kidnapper, shows them the $500,000, says he is not paying. He adds, if you harm my son, I will place this $500,000 as a reward for your capture, dead or alive. Think about it. Can you trust anyone that wants this much money not to kill you or turn you in? And he adds: If you return my son and are latter captured and tried for this kidnapping after returning my son, my wife and I will ask the judge to show you mercy because you listened to me and returned my son. Then he took ahold of a Bible and said, I swear that I will carry out what I have said.
Virtually his entire community, including the police, and including his wife think he acted improperly.
Did what he did make sense? Is it a gamble? Should he gamble on the life of his son? What is his public obligation? Should he have considered the public reaction? Should he consider the reactions of the stockholders of his company? Should he have listened to his wife?",1504396800,,1878,4.1707988980716255
8672684,5,B00MIYN5M6,"In the town of Westbridge, in a stately residence on 1411 Elstead Avenue, millionaire manufacturer David G. Stannard has got it made in the shade. The leading citizen in Westbridge, Stannard has made his bones producing well-received household appliances (i.e.: vacuum cleaners). He's got a supportive beautiful wife in Edith (Donna Reed) and a bright 8-year-old boy, Andy (Bobby Clark). He is a loving father and husband. As president of his appliance company, Stannard is shrewd and decisive and unafraid to take gambles, a skills set that may not be adequate to see him thru when his son is snatched away.

Ransom! is a fraught drama from MGM that first released in 1956. It was remade in 1996 with Mel Gibson starring, an updating that sprinkled in more action than did the original. The 1956 Ransom! relies more on psychological tensions brought about by a family shattered by unexpected crisis. In the original version, we don't ever get to see the kidnappers. When Stannard speaks with them on the phone, we don't even get to hear them.

Me, I dunno know if I would've been able to do what Stannard did, dunno if I would've dared take such a big, calculated risk. See, Stannard was all for heeding the advice of the police force what descends upon his household... at first. But then he's made aware that paying the half-a-million ransom gives the abductors license to kill his child and, thus, erase all evidence. It dawns on Stannard: ""They don't have to trust me. I have to trust them."" Glenn Ford is at his best in this one. In fact, this may have been his best ever performance. You can see everything on his face, what he wrestles with. He's alerted to his public obligation. One gutsy underling even mentions the fallout of negative public perception as to how it'll impact his company and its stockholders and board of directors.

The most gripping sequence is inarguably Stannard's televised message to the kidnappers in which he floors everyone with his choices. I only wish there'd been space enough to show even more how the public reacts to Stannard's very unconventional move, more from the buzzards and the rubberneckers. Obviously, what Stannard does is wildly unpopular, particularly with his wife. Donna Reed - whom most of you will recognize from It's A Wonderful Life - does the most with her thankless role of the wife who gradually falls apart.

Two other actors deserve a mention. Juano Hernandez plays the Stannards' butler with moving dignity and incredible grace. Leslie Nielsen - known mostly for his Naked Gun spoofs - may surprise most with his dramatic turn as Charlie Telfer, jaded reporter from the Times Chronicle.

I couldn't tell you which version is better, this one or the one from 1996. Gibson's remake has more in common with Liam Neeson's Taken in terms of action. This one is more of a harrowing character study. The one nitpick I have for the original is that it's absent of observable accountability for the abductors' crime. Far as we know, they get away scot-free. Not okay.",1503878400,,3026,4.8227360308285165
