8613125,2,B00F8OO8H4,I had hoped that this would help my son's father learn to cornrow as I have severe arthritis in my hands. Her hands are in the way of being able to see the hair clearly as she braids so he is still as lost as ever. the only video we watched was the how to cornrow. The other methods on the dvd may be worth it for experienced braiders. I don't know at this time.,1444867200,2,362,3.84
8613126,5,B00F8OO8H4,"I Love this book, to the death of me. the author Breanna Rutter, is the bomb. I first was following her on YouTube because she have several tutorials on how to take care of black hair. She teaches you everything you need to know and your hair. I learned about my hair and what type of hair I have as well as texture, now that I know,  I also learned how to simply wash my hair and condition my hair as well a knowing what products to use that best works for me. My hair was badly damaged due to over processing my hair and using harsh chemicals from perms to coloring. I recently did the big chop and started all over again, now I can say that I love the way my hair is now responding.  I was spending big money on going to hair dressers and realizing that my hair is responding better now that I'm taking care of it my self, that's because I know what I am doing. This book gives you the tools you need in caring properly for your hair type and texture. I would love to meet her one day that way she do my hair, because you can tell that she really cares.  Where was Breanne, three years ago.  Lol!! I hope that this was helpful.  Thank you, Iyauna",1389484800,,1149,4.044052863436123
