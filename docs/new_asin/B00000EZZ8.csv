1199632,5,B00000EZZ8,Ms. Hornaday's review is very good and accurate so all I will add is this: this cooking show is the best. It is well worth the price and then some. The Two Fat Ladies is something you have to experience and you will be delighted. I just love this show.,1211414400,4,252,4.06
1199633,5,B00000EZZ8,"I cannot say how thrilled I am that this long-awaited DVD is being released in the US.  The Two Fat Ladies remains my favorite cooking show of all time.  The Food Network would do well to toss some of their no-name bobbleheads and bring back this excellent show.
I currently own the VHS Series 1 and 2 tapes, and bring them out at least once a year for some ""comfort viewing"".  Clarissa and Jennifer are refreshing and funny, their show is a joy to watch.
Having made a few of their less-intimidating recipies, like Chocolate Fruit tarts, I can say that in addition to their show being hilarious and entertaining, the recipies are delicious and easy.
More importantly, Clarissa and Jennifer were frontrunners in the current movement towards less processed food and seeking out good local ingredients, rather than purchasing imported schlock from the local supermarket.
You will certainly enjoy this DVD, it's unusual, fun, and a pleasure to relax and enjoy.",1210636800,27,957,4.895061728395062
1199634,5,B00000EZZ8,"It's time to ""bubble and squeak"" with joy!

In the history of cooking shows, this one remains a true Iconic TV Classic. It is utterly unique and richly deserves this complete DVD series release - just as richly as the flavors that run through the dishes featured!

Part cooking show, part comedy, part travelogue, part buddy-show but ALL entertainment, fun and very, very British, Two Fat Ladies featured Clarissa Dickson-Wright and the late Jennifer Paterson, both middle-aged and overweight.

It originally ran for three seasons, from 1996 to 1998 on BBC Two. Repeats of the show also appeared on the Food Network in the US, and on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in Australia. In total, only 16 episodes were produced, but it was more than enough to propel the women into unlikely, beloved, worldwide celebrities.

The show featured the pair traveling throughout the United Kingdom on Paterson's signature Triumph Thunderbird. Wright rode in the sidecar and, appropriately, hurled hysterical a-sides down the country roads as they rode to unusual and often, historic destinations to feed large groups.

In general, wherever the ended up, they used existing kitchens to cook and often incorporated ingredients unfamiliar to American pallets, like lard and drippings, raw eggs and unpasteurized milk products. They emphasized the importance of using freshest ingredients of the very best quality, eschewing supermarkets for farms and roadside stands along the way. Interestingly, the use of these heavy, rich ingredients led to criticism by some journalists who considered them a bad influence on the British diet.

Undeterred and unabashedly outspoken, the women had a dislike of vegetarians and spoke quite disparagingly about them with humor; Patterson once said a terrine was, ""Delicious, despite its vegetarian overtones."" In another episode, Jennifer explained that although a dish had originally included lentils, a Colonel's maid who brought the dish back to England got rid of them. The story won cheers of support from Clarissa who said, ""Hurrah! Get rid of all lentils. You've no idea how randy they make vegetarians.""

Paterson and Dickson-Wright sang their own theme song during an animated opening of each show, and Paterson often burst into song during the show, once introducing Apple Pan Dowdy with a verse from an Andrews Sisters song. Both frequently quoted literature while they cooked, Dickson-Wright frequently quoting Shakespear.

Sadly, Paterson smoked heavily and, at one point, took the opportunity to go out for a cigarette while a dish cooked in the oven. Most episodes ended with her smoking and having a cocktail. In one scene, in order to keep the wind from blowing out the lighter, she opened her coat and lighted her cigarette in its shelter.

In 1998, the ladies filmed an episode at a Safari Park where Paterson asked if she could take special care of the elephants. This was the last episode she was able to shoot. The close of the show was extended and instead of its usual one-minute close, it ran five minutes. Later, she told Dickson-Wright that she was feeling unwell, and was going to see a doctor. She was diagnosed with incurable lung cancer and hospitalized immediately.

The day before she died, she asked Clarissa to bring her a tin of her favorite caviar but when Dickson-Wright arrived, Paterson had just died. She was 71. Clarissa said that after Jennifer's funeral, she ate the caviar as a tribute to her friend.

Season 1 Episodes are: Fish & Shellfish, the ladies prepare a meal at The Shark's Fin restaurant in Mevagissey, Cormwall; Meat, the ladies go to Westonbirt School in Cornwall to cook for the lacrosse team; Fruits & Vegetables, the ladies fix dinner for the priests at Westminster Cathedral (not the famous Abbey); Cakes, The ladies prepare cakes for a fait in Hallaton using a private kitchen of a friend of Clarissa's from her Women's Institute days; Game, the ladies go to Scotland to cook at Lennoxlove House in East Lothian which is owned by the 15th Duke of Hamilton; and Cooking in the Wild, the ladies go to Kielder Forest in Northumberland to cook for a Boy Scout Troop.

The ladies fixed a Christmas dimmer for the choir boys.

1199636,5,B00000EZZ8,"This video is priceless!  In an age when we all are watching our fat intake and waistlines, Jennifer and Clarissa fearlessly take on the forbidden art of cream, butter and wine.  Besides their delicious dishes,  they shamelessly will entertain a fine wine and cigarette after a day of  cooking, something you NEVER see anymore.  Bless their hearts.  I miss  Jennifer already.",939427200,9,375,5.049180327868853
1199637,5,B00000EZZ8,"As a former and sometimes still practicing quasi-vegetarian,well aware of chloresterol, red meat and warnings of possible negativeconsequences, I can't help but think that the sheer joy of cooking which comes across from Jennifer and Clarissa in these and their other videos, can only increase my life expectancy! I became addicted to their shows the first time I happened to be in New York and have since done my best to obtain as many videos and books as possible. With a former British upbringing I fully appreciate their humour and cutting sarcastic remarks about 'polystyrene board' alias supermarket chicken (Episode on 'Game') or in the same episode Clarissa's impersonation of a microwave oven and lamentations over the younger generations' missing out on being brought up with the aromas of real cooking. Although I am not a cook by profession, I am more than aware of and acknowledge that there are many excellent books/videos around by talented chefs. But in the case of 2 fat ladies as becomes so obvious in the first few minutes of the videos, they are more than just cooking. We hear nursery rhymes in Latin in the episode on meat, accounts of Catherine de Medici and how she nearly died from an overdose of artichokes on her wedding day as the they prepare lunch for the priests of Westminster Cathedral in the absence of the Portuguese nuns and hear vivid descriptions of the habits of pheasants which I won't go into details about here. These videos are a must and I can't recommend them highly enough.",934675200,16,1519,4.846153846153846

1199754,5,B00000EZZ8,"What a treat to have this on DVD to watch on a whim. Video and sound are of great quality. Not only is there great fantastic information on food and culture, but Jennifer and Clarissa are hilarious together in this show as they ramble on about nothing and everything while traveling the UK, Europe and abroad. They are mildly inappropriate, sometimes askew with their manner and speech in that ""1950s sort of racist"" way, but never so much that a child or your grandparents can't watch it even. My boyfriend and I would binge watch this, remembering seeing the episodes air in the 90s on PBS, all while eating junk food, smiling and laughing the whole time. Two Fat Ladies really leaves a good feeling in your heart (and stomach).",1449878400,,730,4.623076923076923

Now that the shows are off the air and have been for a while, she was missing the unique entertainment and recipes.  This DVD set provides all of the episodes and a whole lot more.  There are a lot of little bits that were cut out of the Cooking Channel broadcasts to keep them at 30 minutes and allow for commercials.  Plus there are extra features on the two hostesses.  This is well worth the investment.",1447718400,,500,4.391304347826087

To be clear, it's not a pure cooking show.  The Ladies hardly ever give measurements (but you can usually look them up online), and just barely cover technique.  But in each show, the Ladies demonstrate 4 to 5 simple-yet-interesting recipes.  And at least 3 of those will be delicious, something your friends will love if you make it at home.

As to entertainment: The Ladies visit interesting locations and are full of charming, eccentric personality.  I sometimes watch this show for fun.",1422057600,,611,5.0

1199798,5,B00000EZZ8,"For me .the delight of this ,the best ever of cooking programmes was the personality of Jennifer Paterson ..she stole every show and Clarrisa, the other fat lady, seemed rather ordinary in comparison although in real life she was not .Jennifer had a wonderful accent and parts have found their way into my speaking also . There has never been a programme like this before and I doubt if we could ever find a Jennifer again ,,superb viewing . Of course, in these days when everyone seems to be on a diet, no one could reproduce the recipes that were in the show",1421193600,2,560,4.446601941747573

1199830,5,B00000EZZ8,"I was a big fan of this show when it was first broadcast in the US, in the 1990s.  I was deeply saddened to learn about Jennifer's death in 1999, and Clarissa's death quite recently.  I love these ladies.

This show really separates the wheat from the chaff, the boys from the men! I've long had a lack of patience, to put it mildly, for people who are afraid of food and who hold the extra ounce of water weight on their own hips in horror and disgust.  There are so many fertile topics for discussion here--each age's ideals of beauty; the mono-vision that television and Madison Avenue have brought to popular culture; the politics and economics of food production and distribution; the disdain, nay, shaming, of body diversity in our culture--but this is about the cooking and the food.

I love the recipes, I love the style, i love the delivery. The recipes are all tried-and-true old English fare, and look quite delicious! I admit, I'm not exactly won over by the idea of deviled kidneys, and Clarissa's quick mention and then dismissal for the American South were annoying, but nearly all the food looks scrumptuous.

The real treat is the chemistry between these two ladies.  One can see it grow from a cordial, cheerful professional banter to a real friendship over the course of four series.  Even within the first series of six shows. That's where the magic is. That's why, even though I know every word by heart, I watch this DVD set constantly, much more frequently than I watch any TV show online (broadcast TV? what's that?) or other DVD. I have shelves and shelves of opera DVDS, but these are much more fun!",1417824000,2,1625,4.618055555555555

tasty dishes for groups and loving every minute of it.  The ladies in question

The two ladies are a joy, bantering away as they prepare their incredibly rich feasts for varying groups of British citizens.

1199929,5,B00000EZZ8,"If you enjoy traveling and eating tasty food, you'll enjoy watching this cooking show with the ""Two Fat Ladies."" These women are humorous and talented cooks. What I like about this cooking show is that they travel to and fro in an old motor bike and side car to the places they are going to cook at and on the way collect, purchase new and regular ingredients for their recipes on the way. they travel the English countryside while doing so. In doing so they travel to a variety of places and cook in a variety of places from inside a monastery, inside a convent and even in a large tent for a local Boy Scout group.
Overall, I love this series. The women are humorous to watch and they are talented in cooking too. I have made a least a dozen different recipes from this season alone and all were yummy, yet most are not very healthy, but simply tasty. I particularly love their Shooter's sandwich. Lots of good food are cooked on each episode. You name it and they two lovely ladies cook it from wild game to desserts to seafood and vegetables.",1382227200,,1046,4.369230769230769
1199930,5,B00000EZZ8,Love these two ladies!! So much fun and the scenery and cultural details ate the icing on the cake! (pun intended).,1379980800,,115,4.523809523809524
1199931,5,B00000EZZ8,"It would be an understatement to say that I'm a fan of this program. I think, over the years, that I've watched and re-watched these episodes more than a dozen times a piece. Surprisingly, I still find myself learning something new with each screening; usually an obscure reference that just begs to be explored.

I see the fascinating foodstuffs and recipes are well covered by many other Amazon customers, so this review explores the two ladies themselves.

It was genuinely shocking to learn more about the incongruent team and their personal histories - a stunning and rather stark contrast to how I imagined their lives prior to the show. Suddenly, remarks made off the cuff and benign interrogatives with elements of good humor became subtle stabs and gentle reproaches. A competitive and sometimes uncomfortable dynamic I always felt, but never understood.

Honestly not sure if it was insight or sheer dumb luck that led producer Patricia Llewellyn to put these two on the same stage. Given that, on paper at least, they seem terribly incompatible.

To learn that my favorite lady, Jennifer, was not formally trained as a chef surprised greatly. It hurt me personally to read many unflattering comments when the show was presented live, impugning her ability and disparaging her physical presence. A monstrous groupthink arrogance that reveals the oft ugly snobbery found amongst foodies and wannabe epicureans. Does your meal taste good? Then shut the bleep up. No degree or certificate makes up for a pleasurable dining experience. If that were really true - our collective mother's cooking should taste like crap. Reality check: Everyone I've ever met and shared a meal with loves my mother's cooking. Not just polite lip service, genuinely loves it. Even her sorry excuse of an ex-husband, who it can be said despises her as a person, misses her cooking. So, again, food snobs - shut the bleep up.

Clear from her many fascinating comments and observations that Jennifer had a rich and full life; filled with parties, traveling, and a joyous sense of the world. A price her once beautiful face and body paid as a result. No one stays young forever. And the fools that attempt physical immortality reflect the horrible narcissism that infects multiple generations of humanity today. I like to imagine she called her wrinkles and weight ""battle scars of enjoyment"" - and such a campaign she waged! Additionally, what makes her even more interesting in my eyes is how she managed her material life with a deep devotion to Catholicism and The Church. No doubt a difficult balancing act, one that made her so wonderfully interesting as a person and a cook.

Contrast her against the classically trained and blatantly sexual presence of Clarissa Dickson Wright. Talk about a person with hidden skeletons and terrifying closets! A wondrous and grand lady who nonchalantly reveals old wounds that almost certainly were born out of the deepest kind of pain; offered up to us in the audience as tidbits of self-deprecating humor. Wow.

An example: Several such old hurts manifested itself as stabs directed at her late father. One stands out amongst all others. During the ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Food-in-the-Wild/dp/B001ODU1KG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Food in the Wild</a>"" episode, as the pair hunt for wild mushrooms, she remonstrates Jennifer not to pick a particularly colorful fungi. Reason: It's lethal. And without any prompting, adds that it's one type that she could never find as a young girl - who intentionally sought out that particular species to poison her dad.

Yikes.

I had to pause and rewind to make sure I heard her correctly the first time. Again, yikes.

Mind you, that was just one of many skewed and skewering comments she made over the course of the series.

If I sound as if I'm criticizing the program and its stars - I'm not. Again, I'm a huge fan of the show. Not only having purchased the dvd box set, but also the digital versions for our tablet for times when my wife and I are on the road ourselves. It's just that, beyond the food, there was, and still is, so much more depth beyond what the ladies are serving. It's my hope that this review will challenge you to find it and them yourselves; to get deeper into this seemingly straight forward cooking show.

With the very sad passing of Jennifer there really wasn't a show anymore. Not that the producers couldn't have found another companion for Clarissa, but let's be blunt - some partners are just irreplaceable. One can't imagine Stan Laurel looking for another Ollie once his best friend had passed on. Ditto any number of famous pairs whose presence was manifest only as that person's other half.

Perhaps the greatest legacy the two ladies left: A desire to learn more about life-giving foodstuffs and the world of dishes yet untasted.",1379808000,6,4880,5.009876543209876

TFL measure by a ""slurp of this"" and cup (not a measuring cup, mind you) of that, a knob of butter, etc. There are a few dishes I've attempted (with some variations) and will likely try more.  But they all look interesting and harken back to a way that few people cook anymore. The ladies are charming, witty and clever and it's all unscripted.

1200040,5,B00000EZZ8,"The only issue I have with this DVD set is that they didn't get to make more episodes before Jennifer passed away.

The commentary on various things from supermarkets, to young vegetarians, or cheese is plain hilarious.  On multiple episodes they even poke fun at the people they are cooking for.

These two are a bit like taking Julia Child and Paula Deen, multiple by 100 or so, add some scotch, a hatred of vegetarians & health nuts, and fine english accents.

There is nothing on American television like this.  The cooking shows now have hosts I find very annoying.  Either the food is pretentious or the host is a boring cardboard personality.  The ladies' comments are nothing like the manufactured stuff we see so regularly.  They are just being themselves and having a damn good time.

The comments the ladies make about mass produced food items are funny, but thought provoking as well.  Many of the items they use from local farms and merchants are nearly unrecognizable to the processed versions we have available in supermarkets.  I don't think they would approve of Sandra Lee's semi homemade.

Two Fat Ladies is something you need in your DVD library.  It would be very fun to have this on during a cocktail party or during holiday cooking marathons. It would also be a great attitude adjustment on a tough day to come home and watch this show.

Also, at least every episode gave me an invaluable tip on how to cook/prepare something, for instance, piercing a goose's flesh to let the grease flow, and being sure not to use a mussel that is already open to avoid poisoning.
I greatly enjoyed seeing the kitchens of many an English mansion/former mansions, and the downstairs to Abbeys, Embassies and the like. Not to mention the entire English countryside as they tool around in their motorcycle/sidecar. Too cool for school. I'd like to see these reality show cooks try to cook on some of those English stoves or in an outdoor military tent, or in the very ground. These ladies can cook anything anywhere. If they came to the US south, they would no doubt try cooking an egg on the hood of a car and baking a cake inside! They would probably pull it off, too!",1340668800,2,1078,4.561855670103093

1200069,4,B00000EZZ8,"First off, let's get the British element out of the way:  A lot of Americans would sit through five hours of the most historically accurate portrayal of dust settling on drying paint, in the 1920's, if the BBC produced it.  And then, feeling insecure, would denounce the British for their ""snooty"" way of talking.

This is not that sort of British tv show, and thus the few reviews who found the show engaged in ""America Bashing"", or who simply dismissed it out of hand, must have come from Americans at a very desperate stage, in very dark places; or expat Brits, who should never be trusted, least of all with the silver, or daughters with an inheritance.

This is a very comfortable, lounge-about sort of show that all those BBC Miniseries and Monty Python episodes told us the British weren't capable of.

The back story to this show is quite interesting, and you should google it.  Especially if you're middle aged and wonder what you could do ""at your age"" to get your life in gear.  Both Clarissa and Jennifer had lives before the show, and Clarissa had made a pretty spectacular wreck of hers.

This is a show about cooking the sort of food that causes too many intelligent people to say they love the show but would never try the recipes.  Neither woman brooks much dissent from vegetarians, nor has any enthusiasm for supermarkets and prepared food, although there are a couple of episodes where one or the other will admit to cheating.  I found the admission of cheating via the purchase of puff pastry to be my own gripe, as so many of my friends do the same thing.  If I had Jennifer's manicure, I'd do a YouTube video on the subject just to show how easy it is to make a puff pastry, and really, how little time, and effort, it takes (Julia Child often substituted short pastry--but at least she was dealing with a 1960's-'70's audience that had become addicted to convenience and forgot what cooking looked like).

Ah well....

The settings vary, from monasteries to nunneries, a law school (where Clarissa got her degree, the youngest woman to pass the British bar)(and then she lost it for ""practicing without chambers"") and a light house, and even a guest house in Jamaica.  A polo match!  While the setting is often beautiful, architecturally interesting, and historic, the kitchens are always wonderful affairs, but with the oldest stoves and the tiniest ovens.  I've tried to google those British ovens to no avail--they all have huge round lids to cover the flat-plate ""burners"" and tiny little boxes resembling wood stoves for the ovens.  There's a lovely assortment of pottery, from Mason Cash bowls most anyone can still buy, and the blue and white striped pottery that one can occasionally find stateside, or order online (of course, America has it's own regional pottery, Bauer and Fiesta come to mind..., but there I go sounding like a red state nutcase!).  And of course, there's Jennifer's manicure, an exquisite nail job that makes any hand preparation (and she always does her entry by hand) a visual delight.

As the ladies cook, everything (prepared for a small group, generally) is scaled to the home kitchen and recipe provided (in the cookbook, or on the Cooking Channel website) to allow the viewer to see the recipe as it will look, as cooked at home.  The format of the show is fairly consistant, episode to episode, with the two swapping duties as one's preparation goes in for a rise, a bake, a simmer or a marinade; and often they take to the motorbike and go off for berries, or a goose, or honey.  You don't learn a lot about the science or history, or cultural significance of an item or recipe, although very often there is some story provided, and most of the time it sounds at least plausible.  The humor is conversational;  just as often intended as not, and sometimes missing the mark.

As cooking shows go, this is the oddball, two very large women who like to cook food that makes people fat, and who do so in colorful, often quaint and almost always scenic settings.  As they cook they banter and converse, and the camera records it all.  Sometimes it's funny, sometimes it makes you cringe (not too often) and mostly it's just like hanging out with a couple of middle class people, maybe like yourself, maybe not, but very engaging nonetheless, recently bathed; with clean hands,  cooking.  And you know the food is going to be good, because you saw what went into it.  Will you tell your doctor?  Of course not.",1318982400,8,4467,4.675191815856778

I've heard (and suffered through some) many different opinions of the TFL's, and always chose to ignore the negative ones, as we embrace these two fine ladies with open arms.  Their presentation of their dishes, and their candor is simply priceless, and the beautiful settings in which it all takes place ; sadly, there will never, ever again, be a team like this; which, of course, makes this DVD collection all the more so extremely valuable.  It has sentimental value, in addition to being extremely entertaining.  We noticed that during their interaction with each other, there's no background music, and the amazing thing about that is, it's not needed at all; they are just two of the most entertaining cooks that television has ever aired.  We love them so much, and were deeply saddened by Jennifer's passing, and miss both Jennifer and Clarissa very much (especially as the TFL's).  There's nothing more to say except, if you're a devout fan, you're going to to love this DVD set.

1200073,5,B00000EZZ8,"""Two Fat Ladies"" is not only a gastronomic feast, but an exploration of what it means to be unashamedly comfortable with yourself and your own opinions.
Both Jennifer Patterson and Clarissa Dickson Wright are at home in their skins,and make no aploogies for their firmly held likes and dislikes. The tragedy of Jennifer's death brought this well-loved series to a close, but that just means we must love the ones that exist all the more.
Even though the motorcycle and a few of the situations may seem a tiny bit contrived, the ladies rise to each occasion, and demonstrate supreme charm and grace. They relate to each topic as if they were borm to do so -- as they undoubtedly are/were.
Having read Clarissa's autobiography, ""Spilling the Beans,"" it was a revelation to revisit her in the ""Two Fat Ladies"" series. It was, indeed, like running into an old friend.

The Two Fat Ladies, Clarissa and Jennifer had wonderful TV chemistry that was apparent in every episode.  Their unusual mode of transportation along with beautiful locations throughout Great Britian and quirky side trips made each show even more enjoyable.

1200089,5,B00000EZZ8,"Expect fun and cooking delight without real recipes. These Two FAT Ladies, really fat, show how they got that way, by their cooking. Butter, bacon, anchovies, sugar, salt and booze combine to scare the hair off a cardiologist. This show was everything I was warned about in my heart attack rehab. Well, except plenty of exercising from slapping my knee, and holding my aching belly after another round of laughter. These 2 girls had rather eccentric lives and they are just being themselves during the TV series productions. TWO FAT LADIES was an instant pilot success in the UK and a world-wide hit not long after. Only the death of Jennifer put the show at its end. Yet it lives on, with used DVDs commanding good resale prices.

Not exactly a cooking show because many ingredients are never weighed or measured, and you have to guess how much their pinch, dollop, splash, or other odd measurement might be. Names of some items are particularly rare to the typical home cooking male or female. Cooking times sometimes never given and temperature comes in the form of ""gas-7"" (whatever that Argo language means.) But who cares? The delight of seeing these 2 perform their skill is enough. And the scenery and education you get along the way in seeing a goat cheese source worked out in a ""rapid fire"" grip; or the ""don't look"" warning for cooking live lobsters; desserts for the gents made to look like female parts; and always just slipping off the tongue smoothly delivered. Songs, poetry and the like appropriate for a dish is an appealing as the scenic motorcycle rides through the countryside of Britain and Ireland. Just too many favorite parts (ingredients) to list for this Chef-less Bikin'-Cooker Ladies Duo-nut.

BONUS material is great!
24 episodes at 30 minutes each come WITH SUBTITLES.
Booklet: 8 YUMMO Recipes with true instructions minus the nutritional disaster for the fat/salt/cholesterol unconscious types (including famous Hedgehog).
text bios for each of the TWO FAT LADIES, a delight to read after becoming acquainted with the pair, thus realizing they are quite transparent, not actresses.
Bonus Program: A Tribute to Jennifer Paterson, with interviews from former employers, friends, family, and even showing parts of the funeral. An amazing story, it could have been a movie.

My wife also declared it a KEEPER, to be returned to for viewing. Soon!
I think I gained 5 pounds just watching the butter melt. Laughed it off.

They brave the politically incorrectness of cooking with all the abundance that is available to them; butter , lard, beautiful marbled beef, organ meats and everything else that delights ones palate.  They bring great ideas, from many cultures into my kitchen.  We should all revisit The Two Fat Ladies more often...our palates need to be entertained with good food and drink.  We have restricted ourselves to the doctors diet of nuts and greens; which is of course the proper way to extend ones life, but how boring is that?  What a great adventure you can take with the girls and their motorbike.

Their unique manner with each other was so charming and genuine we immediately felt we had known them forever. They are the epitome of your two favorite wacky English aunts...that you never knew existed. Some of the dishes they prepare are things I would never eat, but that's beside the point. Whether or not you like their recipes is irrelevant. They boost the confidence of fledgling cooks and breathe new life into the forgotten kitchen. They are sharp, witty, opinionated, and ever so proper. I think I gained a deeper and broader appreciation for all things British by watching these two wonderful women. The box set is so much better than what we were offered by American television. I quickly realized that we had never really experienced the episodes as they were filmed. The American edit is about 20 minutes long, and so much of the good stuff is edited out for commercial insertions. The box set contains the uncut 30 minute versions in all their irreverent glory.

1200145,5,B00000EZZ8,"While I was growing up, my dad owned a restaurant. I learned early on that the most interesting place to be was in the kitchen with the cooks. Not only were there great smells and the occasional morsel of food to be had, but also the intermittent scrap of overheard adult conversation, spiced with local gossip and experiences that young ears were probably not supposed to hear.  The kitchen was certainly never boring. The cooks put me to work doing all sorts of elementary tasks like peeling vegetables and helping make deserts and, in payment, I learned a lot of colorful information about the outside world. I also learned how to cook.  Many years have passed. They are all gone now and I miss them terribly, especially when I'm in my own kitchen cooking as I do now quite often. It's no fun cooking by oneself.
  Now something delightful has happened. After many years of absence from television, a comprehensive compilation has been made of the smash 1990's BBC cooking show, The Two Fat Ladies, and it is available for American audiences to buy.  I find that I can go into my kitchen, slip  one of my four new DVDs of the Two Fat Ladies into my computer, and cook with ladies very much like my former idols.  The two fat ladies are the late Jennifer Paterson, a spirited lady who spent her life living in many different corners of the world both as a privileged member of the British upper class and as a cook, caterer, and eventually food writer for the Spectator.  She relates the most remarkable stories from her past and has the tendency to sing an occasional show tune or pub song, or recite a childhood poem.  Clarissa Dickson Wright is her down to earth complement. Early circumstances for her also included maids, cooks, butlers, and travel. Both women are able to bring to the screen a multitude of cultural dishes with a side dish of entertainment similar to that provided to me in my childhood.
  Each week, the beginning of the show features Jennifer, driving her trademark BSA motorcycle, with Clarissa sitting beside her in the sidecar, to some of the most picturesque parts of the English or Scottish countryside. After arriving at their destination, they are given the use of a remarkable kitchen, sometimes in a century old building complete with the quintessential Aga stove. In those kitchens, the two ladies turn out sumptuous meals using enough butter, double cream and lard to send people conscientious of their fat intake away screaming.  In the process they are delightful.  Along with watching them making wonderful looking meals, one is treated to an occasional history of food, utensils or ingredients; weekly trips into the country to buy farm fresh ingredients; local folklore; royal gossip and a lexicon of pre 20th Century measuring terms that have always given the serious measurer fits: a `slop' of cream, a `touch,' a `slurp' and a `splash' of this and that.  For anyone who loves to hang around in kitchens, The Two Fat Ladies is not to be missed.",1230508800,10,2989,4.745173745173745

Two old party gals that will take you to a different british setting each program while serving up not only a beautiful meal to diverse people such as ambassadors, barristers, lumberjacks and boyscouts but also dishing out stories, song and their own point of view on life.

A sad ending to an incredibly delightful duo of chefs. You can't find a cooking show that comes close to the antics of these two ""fat"" ladies, and the fact that they could make fun of themselves and vegetarians.  They cooked the way my grandmother Belle did on the family farm in Vermont in the early 1900's. Lots of lard, butter, fresh cream (from the cows), bacon, and meat. Jennifer and Clarissa would have loved Belle's breakfasts....homemade pie, bacon,blood sausage, fried eggs, toast laden with lots of fresh butter, homemade molasses cookies, salt pork and gravy. Watch these two ladies cook up sumptious meals in castles with huge kitchens full of copper pans hanging from the ceilings and stoves they don't make anymore, to cooking in a hole in the ground; and feel your mouth water when they serve up the meals to Benedictine nuns in Ireland to a hunting party in Scotland or an embassy in London. You will be mesmerized by their unending jocularity and humorous intelligence on world affairs. This is not your typical cooking show-they outshine them all.",1223251200,9,1219,4.804761904761905

They show you the techniques, while bantering with each other, and still having a good time, regardless of how tedious the task at hand may be. Throughout the series, you could feel the warmth that Clarissa and Jennifer felt for each other, overlaid with respect for the other's ways. And, at the end of the day, after the toils are done, the two relax with their respective drinks (Jennifer with a cocktail, Clarissa with water and lemon), and recap the day.

It's great to finally have the whole episodes with all dishes and jokes included. The nice thing about Two Fat Ladies is that they do not hit you with a wall of ""talk"" like the TVFN cooks. They talk when they have something to say unlike the talking machine Rachel Ray for example who will wear you slap out.

These witty, droll, magnificent people are survivors and seers without measure. So much more than a cooking show, the adventures, tales, songs and recipes shared by this pair of master chefs make us remember that it is neither ""live to eat"" nor ""eat to live"" but fight on and laugh in the face of terrible odds no matter what-and feed the people you love as well as strangers by the side of the road. A show that brings courage when you least expect it and lives on after JP is with The Saints, CDW and JP speak to all of us- Catholic or Not, Gay or Straight, Man or Woman, Sous Chef or Amateur.

If you don't have a bloody clue about what I'm prattling on about, stop reading, spend some coin, open a bottle of Wine and call your friends over and START COOKING.

(and when you realize I'm right about all this go and look up Clarissa's auto biography ""Spilling the Beans""!)",1217548800,8,1033,4.347150259067358
1200214,5,B00000EZZ8,"Whooo hooo! Finally, the Two Fat Ladies are on DVD! The episodes are fabulous and it is so wonderful to see Jennifer and Clarissa cooking again. I am also pleased that the DVD set includes bios and a tribute to Jennifer Patterson.
A must have DVD set for any Two Fat Ladies fan!",1217462400,9,278,4.264150943396227
1200215,5,B00000EZZ8,"I watched this show like so many others on Food Network, but the network did not do the show justice. I received the set today and already I see scenes that was cut out when aired on TV. The only downer is when Jennifer passed away that Clarissa did not carry on the tradition. I have tried only one recipe in the past and that was the ""Shooters sandwich"" which was delicious. I plan on making many of these recipes this fall/winter. If you enjoy rustic cooking with a bit of humor thrown in you will love this show.",1217462400,2,516,4.222222222222222
1200216,5,B00000EZZ8,"These shows are what cooking is all about, and even if you choose not to eat some of their dishes, as I, the shows are such great fun that the pleasure comes not just from their creations but from the cooks themselves, their stories and quips, their adventures, and of course, the lovely scenery and kitchens which are refreshingly different for every single show.

I have been a long-time fan and still lament over Jennifer Paterson's untimely death. When I saw that this show FINALLY went to DVD, I pre-ordered in about 5 seconds flat, then passed out from the sheer excitement of anticipating my order's arrival.

These are wonderful, informative shows, and FUN FUN FUN! Jennifer and Clarissa pull no punches and do not ruin our day with worries over too much of this cream and too much of that butter. Indulge yourself and enjoy.

And, as if that were not enough to send me to heaven and back on a sheet of shortbread, there are 11 - count 'em -ELEVEN MORE episodes than were available on VHS (which of course I purchased ages ago). PLUS the bonus feature about Jennifer Paterson. I am thrilled beyond all measure, and so thankful to the media reps responsible for getting these wonderful shows put on DVD. Thank you!!",1217462400,18,1222,4.622119815668203
1200217,5,B00000EZZ8,"I'm so thrilled that this is finally on DVD in the US.  I received my DVD set yesterday after having pre-ordered and already watched several of the episodes.  What a shame that they weren't able to go on and have a longer run.  Their show was one of a kind and there will never be another cooking pair matched up such as them.

Jennifer and Clarissa are such fun to watch, and their interactions with the people they visit are wonderful.  They are truly special, and in me, they will always have a fan.",1217289600,4,502,4.297872340425532
1200218,5,B00000EZZ8,"So said the delightful, departed Jennifer Paterson as she and her chum Clarissa whipped up a batch of vichyssoise. This is a wonderfully entertaining show, that rare cooking show where what was being made sometimes took a backseat to the antics of the show's stars. Their glee  is contagious.
The Food Network edited these episodes significantly; some were seen unedited in the US on PBS. Hopefully these discs will contain full episodes. Most of what was cut turned out to be the gals bashing neighboring countries (""The only good thing the Dutch ever came up with was cocoa""). As Jennifer would say, ""Never mind."" We can handle it.",1215475200,25,633,4.861111111111111

Five stars all the way!!",1214352000,138,956,4.9375
1200220,5,B00000EZZ8,I agree with the previous reviewer.  This was one of the best shows in the Food Network schedule.  Of course that was in it's 'heyday' when FN was showing real cooks not just pretty faces.  The ladies were always at their finest.  I can't wait to get this DVD set.  I have a few episodes that I taped years ago and relish watching them.,1212019200,7,336,4.1875
