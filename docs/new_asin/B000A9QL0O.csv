8076436,5,B000A9QL0O,"This is one of the best produced, most accurate, yet also most absorbing version of Biblical stories. It doesn't dumb down the stories the way many productions about the Bible tend to, but it also doesn't try to shock you with explicit, graphic detail. Part of this includes offering social cues for some of the things the Hebrews did that might be puzzling or just strange to a modern audience.

It's an excellent balance between character development, keeping pretty faithful to the story, and teaching the audience something they perhaps forgot.",1513209600,,548,5.021978021978022

8076438,5,B000A9QL0O,"This DVD is a great deal, it has four stories for the price of one. This series is most interesting in that each story has a different style of animation. The Abraham story features stop animation with 3D characters, while Elijah is produced with traditional 2D animation. Speaking of Elijah, that show alone is worth more than the price of this DVD, it is a bible story that is rarely attempted for film, and done well here. The scene where God lights the alter on fire is very impressive and invokes the sense of the power behind the action. Also on this release is the story of Jonah, done with much humor. Last is the Creation story which includes ADAM & Eve, and Noah and the ARK. This one is very interesting, as even within the story, there are different styles of animation. Someone once told me that bible animated stories are usually poorly produced, but this one is fantastic, I highly recommend for all ages.  I just can't believe I had never seen these before, I will rave about them to my friends. My 13 year old son loved it, my wife loved it, and this series is now my new favorite of any animated bible series.

The quality of the DVD itself was good, a very clean picture that appears remastered, and clean sound. No problems playing the DVD in the machine,or freezing. The packaging is a little weak, it is a thin cardboard box with both DVD's tucked into slits, no plastic at all, but maybe that is better for the environment anyway. Other DVD's in the series are stand alone title's, and they all come in typical plastic cases. The Testament series is notable in that they used smart writers to try to turn each story they chose into a 30 minute program, but just as important is their choice of different animators and styles of animation for each of the episodes.

The series, produced over 10 years ago by Christmas films in Wales and Russia for the BBC, is not made for kids, but for all ages.  I believe HBO family channel ran these for awhile a few years ago. There are other DVD's in the series that you can buy as stand alone title's, also about 30 minutes each. The series includes ""Daniel"", ""David and Saul"",""Moses"", ""Jonah"", ""The Creation and Noah"", ""Elijah"" (my favorite), ""Ruth"", ""Joseph"", and Abraham. The last 3 are in claymation or stop motion animation, like the holiday TV specials). For some reason there is a misleading statement on the boxes of the individual stories, they say ""Full Length Animated Feature"" on each box, but to me that means movie length, not 30 minutes.

If you want a good deal, and a head start on the series, this 4 episode set is the best way to go.",1257724800,11,2614,4.483193277310924
8076439,5,B000A9QL0O,"The TESTAMENT productions have proven to be valuable, educational, and biblically accurate.  We own several and enjoy the various modes of animation. We researched these a bit before purchasing and are very satisfied with the content, quality, and price. Excellent use of interesting media formats!",1256169600,4,298,5.622222222222222
8076440,5,B000A9QL0O,"Sure it's graphic, but have you ever read these stories? Jonah, Elijah, Abraham, Noah? These stories are full of real life accounts of murder, violence and ultimately, God's redemptive power. My family and I have enjoyed this series over 10 years now and I plan to pass them on to my grandchildren one day, Lord willing.",1244592000,5,320,4.732142857142857
8076441,5,B000A9QL0O,"I grew up watching this show on HBO. As a child I loved it, and as an adult I appreciate the depth in which the writers have so intimately portrayed the Holy Scriptures.

The classic intro ""Adiemus"" by Karl Jenkins always stirred something within me because I knew that Testament was on. Great, great show to raise your kids and family watching.

This is simply timeless.",1228521600,8,371,4.606060606060606
