8480288,5,B005NB5AC4,A really great deal for this many blu-rays and the picture quality is amazing. I had only one problem with this and that is that I received duplicates of one of the discs. I received two 2010 Survivor Series instead of the 2011 Royal Rumble. I normally wouldn't include something like this in a review but I need to contact the seller which is Amazon in this case and there is no option to do so.,1337472000,,396,4.223684210526316
