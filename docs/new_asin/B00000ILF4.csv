7910675,5,B00000ILF4,"When you have Kristi Ducati and Julie Strain in the same film you've got a winner.
Julie is one of the hottest women ever to be in a film and Kristi Ducati is, well, Kristi!
Just absolutely gorgeous! Her shower scene is unbelieveable! The rest of the movie is OK and I really envy the dude who gets to have Julie Strain and Toni Naples in bed at the same time! WOW!
I gotta admit I love women! and these women are to be loved! Linda Blair and Edward Arnold are in the movie too.",1264204800,4,478,4.042105263157895
7910676,4,B00000ILF4,"A quaint little film which crosses the erotic and the horror genres quite nicely, with very attractive young ladies, inclusive of a beautified Linda Blair, who plays the part of a Black Witch set on possessing the man of her desires, and not surprisingly, she does ultimately get what she wants. She has an elaborate Ritual Chambre inclusive of a huge red Pentagram with a demonic statue reminiscent of Pazuzu placed appropriately in its center configuration. Additionally to being quite a seductress, she is also a veritable puppet-master, speaking her will before the demonic altar, and her helpless subjects are powerless to refuse, despite the pedantic efforts attempted by erstwhile ""white witches"", who fail redundantly. It is certainly delightful to view the disrobed buxom bodies intermingled with scenes of the dark Sorceries transpiring. Sex and Satan are always a wonderful combination. And viewing the credits carefully, tongue 'n' cheek, one will eventually notice that the ""Occult Adviser"" is none other than ""Abdul Alhazred"" {the primary Arabian character from the book 'Necronomicon' by ""Simon"" / H.P. Lovecraft}. The expected demoralization occurs at the conclusion of the presentation, but there is a surprising and pleasing turn of events calling to mind the finale in The Devil's Rain.
Rating: 3/5 Black Candles 'round The Pentagram. Recommended as a rental.",1084752000,8,1378,5.3842592592592595
7910677,2,B00000ILF4,"This direct to video Erotic thriller is a OK thriller. There's a couple of nude scenes done by the main star(the boyish hairy Larry Poindexter) and a few women. If you like to watch these kinds of DVD's buy this DVD.Be prepared for a ton of plot  holes. The only problems I have with this DVD is it's pan/scan,no trailers and no captions. Even though this stuff is not on the DVD,it's a great transfer. if you can handle ""black bars"" on the side of your TV,instead of the side.buy this DVD.
I'd doubt you can find this DVD for rent/to buy  at a local video store. Buy it for the nudity and the OK story....Somewhere in this movie is the producer,has anyone spotted him yet?",997401600,3,673,4.333333333333333
