Even though this film was made in 1958 it is still painful to watch today because indignities like this still exist.  There are still people trying to thwart the dreams of others for racial, religious or political reasons.  This film will stand long after all the trivial films of our era are forgotten.

2324319,4,B0009VDJQ2,"Review of A Raisin in the Sun
Hot Toasty Rag, November 19, 2017

When you rent A Raisin in the Sun, get ready for some seriously intense acting and a beautiful script. Usually, when a film is made of a play, one or two members of the Broadway cast are used, and the rest is filled with Hollywood names. In Daniel Petries adaptation of Lorraine Hansberrys play, almost everyone in the 1959 original Broadway cast reprised their roles on film. And, while Sidney Poitier and Claudia McNeil, as well as the direction and play itself, were nominated for Tonys, the film was universally ignored at the Oscars.

In a small apartment that doesnt even have a bathroom, there lives the widowed Claudia McNeil, her son Sidney Poitier, her daughter Diana Sands, and Sidneys wife Ruby Dee. Theyre all dissatisfied with their lives, but each family member deals with their disappointment and frustration in different ways. Sidney throws his heart into untrustworthy schemes, Diana is studying to become a doctor to better herself, Ruby keeps her head down as she tries to get through each day, and Claudia tries to continue mothering her grown children.

Unlike most plays, A Raisin in the Sun isn't overly wordy, and not a single moment is boring. Its terribly sad, but still a bit optimistic at times, and very thought-provoking. Perhaps my favorite element, besides the superbly heart-wrenching performances of Sidney and Claudia, is the character development in the script. Every single person in the story is three-dimensional, and no one is a villain or a saint. Audiences can understand their thought-processes and motivations, and its nearly impossible to choose a favorite character. Depending on how well you handle sad stories, this might be a staple you add to your collection, or it might be a film you watch only once but remember forever.",1511049600,,1839,4.944983818770226

2324423,5,B0009VDJQ2,"I am an older Black Chicagoan and, for me, this movie is evocative of the early sixties. Anybody who lived on the south side and remembers Woodlawn (where the story takes place) as the vital shopping restaurant, night club district that it was before the gangs destroyed it will feel this movie. Lorraine Hansberry, who wrote the original play grew up and lived there.

Claudia McNeal nails Mama Lena, as does Ruby Dee as the harried Ruth, Sidney Poitier as Walter Lee, Ivan Dixon as the Nigerian Assagai and Diana Sands as Beneatha. All the actors did a larger than life portrayal of ordinary people living in Woodlawn at that time.

This is one of my favorite sweet movies. A lot of so-called Black movies are an embarrassment to the Black viewer, but this one is one of the real ones.",1462492800,,787,4.574468085106383

2324439,4,B0009VDJQ2,"Imagine your lifetime earnings gone in an instant, poof, without a trace. Now imagine your familys lifetime earnings gone in an instant, poof again, no, its not a magic trick. Finally, imagine if you were responsible for losing the money, how would you face your family, knowing you the reason for losing your American dream and theirs? This isn't the easiest situation to imagine, but Lorraine Hansberry, writer of the 1959 screenplay, A Raisin in the Sun, convincingly conveys a story of a child-like natured husband and father who must grow into his manhood in order to unite his family through harsh times in a harsh period in American history. Jump forward just two years and we are presented with a film adaption that masterfully realizes Hansberrys mesmerizing play with colorful characters and raw emotions.
  Directed by Daniel Petrie Sr., A Raisin in the Sun was adapted for film in 1961 and won the Gary Cooper Award, in 1962, at the Cannes Film Festival with Ruby Dee, played by Ruth Younger, winning the Best Supporting Actress, 1961 in the National Board of Review. The film is well cast with the likes of Sidney Poitier as Walter Lee Younger, Claudia McNeil as Lena Younger, Ruby Dee as Ruth, and Diana Sands as Beneatha. A Raisin in the Sun captures, with so many of these powerfully real characters, what it means to chase after the American dream while still trying to shake off the historical shackles of the time, such as racism, equal right to education, and the right to ownership of property, which refers more to the segregation of black and white families living together.
With all of these characters living under one roof, the debate of the individualistic American dream vs. the collective American dream comes to the forefront as Walter longs so desperately to carve out his own rags to riches story investing in a business he is convinced will provide financial abundance for him and his family. Lena Younger, Walters mother, believes her new financial inheritance of $10,000, contributed by her late husband, can provide her family with her American dream of owning a home. The audience is made to witness this dramatic tension as Walter Lee, after much cynicism in his struggle for self-advancement in the land of opportunity, pleads with his mother to take a chance on him, resulting in her gifting Walter Lee the remaining $6,500 after she puts a down payment on a house. A portion of Walters gifted funds belongs to Beneatha, Walters younger sister, and her pursuit of higher education. Lena Younger hopes to see him reach the level of manhood that made his Father such a great individual knowing that her husband also had faults, but eventually overcoming them to provide for his family. Ultimately the film climaxes as Walters associate, Willy, whom we never meet, runs off with the money leaving Walter Lee to face his family in shame and creating the fork in the road for Walter to either become the great man his father was or drown in his mistakes.
Sidney Poitiers performance as Walter is absolutely intoxicating to watch. Nothing short of amazing, as much as you want to dislike his character for being self-centered, borderline egotistical at times, you cant help but sympathize with his desire to better his life in a historical period of America that pushes back immensely against those of color. One scene in particular that really epitomizes two standout performances is when Lena Younger confronts Walter, her empty shell of a son, in this moment of the film, at the Kitty Kat bar and the two characters exchange their philosophies of life as well as their reasoning behind their actions with Walter Lee comparing his feelings of financial slavery to the slavery that Lena Youngers generation faced in the south. This bar scene encapsulates fear and hope as the driving force of each character and its the emotion brought forth by Poitier as well as Claudia McNeil that collide so spectacularly, forming a truly believable mother and son relationship. With Walter appearing throughout the film as a strong, albeit ignorant oaf, its in this scene that we see him at his most vulnerable as hes leaning over the table, drink in hand, ready to give up and weeping. And up to this point of the film, Lena Younger has been a very stern figure grounded in her religion, but its here that we are introduced to the softest side of her wanting to do everything in her power to nurture Walters broken spirit.
Walter and Lena Younger are by far the reasons to watch this film if you haven't already read the play. As a film that depicts the American dream and the road to redemption within a family that is fighting for every right they can achieve during the early to mid 20th century, and with a cast that is fully committed to such raw emotional roles in Lorraine Hansberrys play, A Raisin in the Sun, it comes with tremendous recommendation that those reading this review drop it, and watch the film at this very instant. And maybe enjoy some flavorful grapes, while you're at it.",1460592000,,5021,4.803468208092486

2324504,5,B0009VDJQ2,"I'm so glad Amazon had this. I read this book years ago in high school and have loved it since. I've seen all the plays on television but this one remains my favorite. This is my second favorite Sidney Poitier movie, rivaled by the great To Sir With Love. I love the fire Mr. Poitier brings to Walter lee. I played Benetha in our Black History presentation of the film and used it as inspiration. I also encouraged all the other cast members to see this version. We got awesome reviews for our performance and I credit some of our success to this film version. I'm so glad amazon had it, if you haven't seen it then you really should. It's a great story about families, the importance of believing in one another and the benefits of knowing your self worth. It speaks to all ages, I watched it first when I was 10 years old. It speaks to men and women, black and white, old and young. For young people it helps us to understand where our people, both black and white have come from, how we've grown and shows us the dual effects of a raisin in the sun.",1440201600,,1052,4.2388059701492535

2324531,5,B0009VDJQ2,"This movie, to me, is about the first Chicago project family, The Younger family.  This takes place some time after Younger senior passes, and the family is lost in the sauce.  Younger Jr. is a chauffer, tired of working for the white man, and taking anything that offers quick bucks.  His wife just learned she's pregnant, and she not really overjoyed about it.  Baby sister is flucuating between an african man, wanting her to embrace her heritage and a regular joe, wanting her to accept him as is.  Then, the insurance check from Younger Sr. arrives, and EVERYBODY has already decided what to do with the check...especially Mama, who has taken steps to see her will done, much to Younger Jr.'s dismay.  This movie pulls at my heartstrings each and every time.  The struggles & triumps are realistic, and Sidney Poitier's melodramactic acting STILL fits right in.

There is not a false note, there is not a wasted line, every interaction is true; it pulled me on relentlessly on.  I cared about everyone I met and tried to understand them.  At times it was incredibly funny and at times it was dark and desperate (when hope and ambition smash and break hard against walls of unowned talent and unavailable opportunity, giving rise to that disappointment and despair which breeds criminals); but always the movie was very, very human.

A film of 5 characters, mother, son, daughter-in-law, daughter, grandson with all actions happened in a small apartment but it tells so much about life of every individual from a hardworking low income black family in Chicago that holds true until this day.  Their lives filled with challenges but hope prevailed.  Young Sidney Poitier who plays against type is excellent and moves around the small apartment like a dancer.  Claudia McNeil who plays the mother holds the whole family together and the film as well.  Ruby Dee plays the long suffering wife.

Watching her constantly in the kitchen "" making eggs"" for Walter made me laugh and feel a sadness for those women who think they can make things better if they can ""bake or cook"" their problems away.

2324807,5,B0009VDJQ2,"A Raisin in the Sun(released May/61)consists of an all star black cast,that simply crackles with the vibrancy and immediacy of the actors and the tension that is created between the various characters. The film has the feel of its stage origins,and the cast that of an ensemble as sure as the characters they portray. I recall seeing it way back when upon its release and it certainly made for an uncomfortable feeling. All star black casts of this quality were few and far between in those days and the message portrayed in it was powerful and to the point. Sure it looked at the black culture and its foibles but it also cast a big light on the racist white to black aspect of things which was bound to make any middle class person of the Caucasian persuasion more than a little uncomfortable. This was the early 60s don't forget. There were a combination of messages for both cultures in the picture and the blend of both was seamless.
Most of the action takes place in and around the apartment lived in by a hard working mother,Lena Younger(Claudia McNeil),whose years of back breaking work and worry are carved into her face. Living in this small apartment are her son Walter(Sidney Poitier),his wife Beneatha(Diana Sands)and their son Stephen,along with Walter's sister Ruth(Ruby Dee,real life wife of the late Ossie Davis).Day to day existence is hard because Mom is the only one with a steady income,son Walter is a daydreamer full of ideas and nothing much else and they are all in each others faces day in and day out. Walter and Beneatha's marriage has suffered greatly and both are in a rut.
Along comes a scheme from one of Walter's buddies at the bar to go into the liquor business and open a store. It sounds sure fire and Walter lays down a good deal of Moms savings. Mom in the meantime has put a down payment on an inexpensive home in a white neighbourhood. Everything is looking up with the family until news comes in that Walter's future business partner has absconded with all the cash. All are devastated and it affects each in a different way. This was Walters ticket up and out of his problems which have all come crashing down on his head. This was a chance for Mom to have a better feel about her son and a better life for both of her children. This was Beneatha's chance at a new and better improved Walter/marriage.
Thrown into this cauldron of wildly conflicting tension is a rep from the white neighbourhood they are moving to. He at first seems to be a one man welcoming committee of sorts until his real reasons come to the fore,which include buying out the family so they do not move in. After he leaves they are at first indignant but do to the money woes,his offer is very tempting. The tight family continues its bitter squabbling until Walter finally realizes how far he has sunk and swallows his petty pride. He starts to rebuild himself and his marriage from the bottom up and has the obvious pride of his mother behind him. They vow to move despite their woes and hold their collective heads up high...together,as a family.
Each actor has his moments to shine. Poitier is the easiest to pick out as his was and still is the name with the most star power,but I did not see any actor within this film fall short at any point in keeping that tension and dynamic on an even keel. Looking back after so many years it's hard to imagine today a film like that not receiving some form of Academy recognition. It didn't and I have heard every explanation I think there is,from Hollywood's shortsightedness to its prejudice. The truth is part and all of it at the same time. However time has not diminished the power of the actors herein,the play or the film overall.
Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp and in a w/s a/r of 1:85:1,in b&w of course. Along with production notes there are talent files and its trailer.
This is a film not to be missed. Rarely does a film stand out as a small testament of its time and still have relevance after all these years. Some would say the battle is still being fought,I will leave that up to you,dear reader,to decide for yourself. Highly recommended.",1341014400,,4134,4.550335570469799
2324818,4,B0009VDJQ2,"First, I've had the hots for Sidney Poitier ever since I was 11 or 12, and I found out it was OK to admit a black man was sexy. So I am disposed to like this movie. But it is an odd little black-and-white heart-wrencher.

Walter Lee Younger (Poitier) is 35, works as a chauffeur for a rich white guy, and wants something more out of life. His mother Lena (Claudia McNeil) is about to receive a check for $10,000 from her husband's life insurance, and everyone in the family has an idea of how to spend it. Of course they all say that money is Mama's and it's up to her what she does with it. But they dream.

Walter wants to invest all or most of it in a partnership with two of his friends to buy a bar. Mama says she's not going to use her dead husband's money to sell people liquor, it's not a fitting memorial to a hard-working man.

His sister Beneatha (Diana Sands) is a thoroughly modern college student who wants to be a doctor. She has a passion for all things African, including Joseph Asagai, a charming young Nigerian who goes to college with her. She also considers herself above her mother's simple Christian faith, declaring that she's sick of hearing about God.

But Mama wants to buy a house to get them out of their too-small apartment. Especially since Walter's wife (Ruby Dee) is pregnant. Their son is already sleeping on the couch because there's not enough room for everyone, they share a bathroom in the hallway with another apartment, and the idea of one more leads her to consider abortion. Of course Mama thinks that is ""talking about killing babies"" and blows up about it.

So when Mama gets the check, she puts a down payment on a house. They go and see the house, which is in an all-white neighborhood, and they all love it. Then they receive a visit from the chairman of the Neighborhood Improvement Committee, a wimpy little white guy who explains very condescendingly that ""people are happier when they live in neighborhoods with their own kind,"" and offers to buy their interest in the house and include a profit. They angrily order him out of their house.

Without telling anyone, Walter hasn't gone to work for three days when his boss's wife calls and says he will be out of a job if he doesn't show up tomorrow. Mama goes to the club where he is drowning his sorrows in beer. She explains that she put $3,500 down on the house, and then hands the rest of it (in cash) to Walter to show that she trusts him. She tells him to put $3,000 in a savings account for Beneatha to go to medical school, and put the rest in a checking account in his name, and he'll be the head of the household. But he takes the entire $6,500 and gives it to his friend Willy, who is supposed to use it for the bar. Predictably, Willy disappears with his money and his other friend Bobo's money.

So how is this tangled mess of emotions and finances and contest of wills resolved? I'll have to leave SOME things for the movie to tell you. Can't give it all away. As I said, it's a heart-wrencher. Be sure you have a good supply of tissues when you watch this one. It's good, even if it is a bit over-played for the emotional roller coaster. I suspect it is pretty authentic for all that. I recognize some of that mercurial personality Walter displays as pretty typical of a man who is frustrated because he feels he's not going anywhere. My own father got like that.

I enjoyed it, but even more, I respect it as a real American story. And like I said, I've had the hots for Sidney Poitier for nearly 50 years.",1337126400,,3522,4.3419452887537995

2324821,5,B0009VDJQ2,"Before I started to write this, I just had to see who in the world could have given RAISIN IN THE SUN a single star, poor review. In a way it was a relief that all those reviews were complaining about the quality of various version of the DVD on the market. So, I want to make it clear that I am commenting on the original MGM, black & white version with Sidney Poitier.

Most of the cast were in the original stage version of A RAISIN IN THE SUN--that must have been a hell of a performance. The play/film stands out as a shinning dramatic reflection of the Civil Rights movement. According to TCM's Robert Osborn there was creative tension between Poitier & Claudia McNeil who played his morally powerful mother. Poitier believed the script spun around the son and McNeil, of course, felt the mother was at the center. An interesting dilemma. In the end Poitier won out, but the conflict between the actors probably was good for the dramatic tension--and there is PLENTY of dramtic tension in  the movie.

It is a conflict of personalities within a family & the social/racial tensions in soiciety at the time (late 1950's to early 1960's) affecting the family. The hip, wise-cracking sister (perfectly played by Ruby Dee) represented the view of Black Nationalism; Poitier's pregnant wife doesn't want to rock the boat; the mother wants to realize her deceased husband's dream of home ownership (using his insurance pay out.) Poitier's character just wants to make fast $$$.

Poitier is an emotional dynamo in this excellent fim & should have earned the Academy Award. Instead he won it the following year in the lightweight comedy LILLIES OF THE FIELD in which an itinerent, a-political (hence, ""safe"") black man builds a church for nuns (OMG!)

A RAISIN IN THE SUN is a film classic & I definitely recommend it for a collector's library.",1323561600,,1841,4.722741433021807
2324822,5,B0009VDJQ2,"This is one of the finest films ever made.  While it is set at a specific time and place--the turbulence of the late 50's in Chicago--the themes are universal.  The ideas of Hughes' poem, which gives the play its title, are captured by some of the greatest actors in theatre and film.

I use this in an English class, along with the more recent version, because the ""white guy from the new neighborhood"" scene is much more powerful in this version than the new.  John Fiedler's milquetoast persona makes his words so much more sinister than John Stamos's.  Stamos is wonderful, but the contrast between Fiedler and Poitier, especially their sizes, makes the power of the white character's words much more frightening.

My college freshman all connect fully to this film, even though these people are not very like themselves, nor is the neighborhood much like their mid-Missouri town life.

SYNOPSIS--
Lena Younger (McNeil) has lived in the same cramped, sunless Chicago tenement apartment all her married life. Now a widow, Lena plans to use a portion of her husband's 10K life insurance policy as down payment on a pleasant home in a white neighborhood. The balance will be evenly divided between her 35-year-old son Walter Jr. (Poitier) and 20-year-old daughter Beneatha (Sands), a college student with dreams of becoming a doctor.

Beneatha is seeing Asagai (Dixon), a Nigerian exchange student, and now she preaches against ""assimilation"" and embraces traditional African garb and music.

Walter and wife Ruth (Dee) have a young son named Travis (Perry). Like his mom and sister, Walter also has dreams. He wants to quit being a white man's chauffeur and become partners in a package store with Bobo (Fluellen) and fast-talking Willie Harris (Glenn). His hopes are crushed when the insurance check arrives and Mama refuses to invest in Walter's liquor store idea.

Walter despairs that his last chance to make something of himself is gone. He spends three days in a local bar and is on the verge of getting fired. Lena comes for him, gives Walter her remaining 7K with instructions that half is for Beneatha's tuition and the rest for Walter to open a checking account with. He asks in surprise if she trusts him with this money and Mama answers ""I've always trusted you.""

The Youngers' moving day is interrupted by a distraught Bobo. Con man Wille has disappeared with Bobo's life savings and with the money Mama entrusted to Walter. The dreams of all seem irrevocably shattered.

Roy Glenn, who appears briefly as Willie, was a regular supporting player on the controversial TV sitcom,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-AMOS-N-ANDY-SHOW/dp/B002DFQQBW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE AMOS 'N' ANDY SHOW</a>.

2324849,5,B0009VDJQ2,"One of the most spellbinding films I've ever seen, and certainly the film that Sidney Poitier should be remembered for (and the one that should have netted him the Oscar, not that horribly mediocre `Lilies of the Field' film), `A Raisin in the Sun' is a powerful look at racism, poverty, religion, dreams and aspirations as well as to importance of family and togetherness.  With a stellar cast (seriously, Oscar nominations should have been handed out to nearly everyone) and a tightly woven and poignant script, this film is a total must see.

I think it is safe to say that I didn't expect this to move me as much as it did.

The film revolves around a check for $10,000, made out to Lena Younger, the matriarch of an African American family living in Chicago.  With the check scheduled to arrive in mere days, everyone in the family is expressing their feelings as to how the money should be spent.  Despite seemingly noble motives, the divided interests of the family begin to ware at the fibers of their unity and cause them to turn on one another.  Walter is a struggling chauffer who just wants a chance to provide for his family.  His plans are hasty but he means well.  His wife, Ruth, looks at the expected money as a chance to get out of their small, cramped living space and really spread out (get their son off the couch maybe), but her role as `supportive wife' makes it difficult to really voice her concerns.  Beneatha, Walter's sister, is spoiled and nave to her cultured existence, developing a certain arrogance that lends itself to disapproval from those around her.  She, of course, feels that the money should be spent on furthering her education.

In the end, the final hand is to be dealt by Lena herself, a wise woman who knows just how to give her family what they need, even if they don't see it that way.

The film, adapted from a stage play, never plays to the confines that most stage-to-screen adaptations bare with.  It feels open and free even if the scenes all take place within the small confines of a cramped apartment (mostly).  This is thanks in large part to the fantastic performances that litter the screen.  Sidney Poitier, an actor I often find stiff and highly overrated, is a revelation here as Walter.  He just commands every scene with a theatrical naturalness that is rarely seen in films today.  He is supporting by a strong female cast, most notably Ruby Dee, who is beautifully restrained as Ruth.  Diana Sands is also stellar as the self-centered Beneatha, and Claudia McNeil is remarkable as the wise Lena Younger.

With a delicate yet affirmative stand on very sensitive subjects, `A Raisin in the Sun' is a beautiful film that everyone should see.  I have not seen the made-for-television remake, but I cannot imagine it can hold a candle to this finely crafted and unforgettable experience.",1258934400,,2847,4.678714859437751
2324850,4,B0009VDJQ2,"Directed by Daniel Petrie, this is the first of 3 film adaptations of the play created by Lorraine Hansberry (who also penned the screenplay) and stars the original theatrical cast.  Fighting poverty, cramped space, and institutional racism, a black Chicago woman (Claudia McNeil) stakes her family's future on her late husband's insurance money but then leaves it in the hands of her mercurial son (Sidney Poitier).  Try as he/she might to picture Hansberry and Petrie's vision, nothing could prepare the viewer for Poitier's fiery, intense Walter Lee Younger.  But I give more praise to McNeil's Lena Younger, Walter's mother, whose subtle but strong demeanor is the glue that holds her family--and, dare I say, the story--together.  Indeed the drama and the acting in ""Raisin in the Sun"" make it a classic in all sense of the word.

2324857,5,B0009VDJQ2,"""What happens to a dream deferred? Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun?"" So begins what is perhaps Langston Hughes' most famous poem ""A Dream Deferred"" and ends with the line, ""Or does it explode?"" The writer Lorraine Hansberry lifted the quotation from Hughes' powerful poem for her equally powerful award-winning play that ultimately became the 1961 film starring Sidney Poitier, Claudia McNeil, Ruby Dee and Diana Sands, directed by Daniel Petrie for which Ms. Hansberry wrote the screenplay.

It is safe to say that America had never seen a film quite like this one coming not that long after Brown v. Board of Education and on the eve of the racial change of the 1960's. I saw the film in Syracuse, New York in 1964; and as a white Southerner, I was so pleased with myself. Now over 40 years later it has only gotten better with time. Sad to say, one need only drive though practically any neighborhood in any city in any state in the union to see that unfortunately forty years after the passage of the Federal Fair Housing Act the pupose of which was to make racial discrimination in housing illegal and to promote integration many African American familes experience what the Younger family did in Chicago. They are not welcome in an all-white neighborhood and are confronted with racial prejudice when they try to purhase a home. Our nation remains racially segregated.

But the film is much more than about race. It is also about the conflict of generations and between husbands and wives. It is about pride and dreams, living your dreams through your children, the importance of family, and redemption through love. As the matriarch of the family Lena Younger says, you should never stop loving someone, particularly when they are at the lowest: ""There is always something to love.""

There is so much conflict in this wondrous film that it practically explodes. The acting by everyone is impeccable. Sidney Poitier, who for years was the only black actor to have received an Oscar for best actor (""Lilies of the Field"") should have won an academy award for his performance as Walter Lee Younger. His confrontation with the white representative from the Community Improvement Association is as good as acting gets. ""We are going to try to be good neighbors."" Of course Ruby Dee is an American treasure. And Claudia McNeil is magnificent as the matriarch of the family, its moral center, who seeps love and compassion although her love is tough. There is one powerful scene (of many) where she makes her daughter Beneatha all full of dreams of Africa and medical school and no religion repeat: ""In my mother's house there is a God.""

If there is any lover of movies alive today who hasn't seen this particular version of this truly American story, you owe it to youself to rent what is one of the best American films ever made.",1213920000,,2840,4.742914979757085

The family is frustrated with living in their crowded Chicago apartment and when the $10,000 arrives, they see this as an answer to everyone's prayers.  But what to do with the money? Pay tuition for college, open a liquor business in Chicago, or buy a house for the now extending family in an all white suburb of Chicago.

The Matriarch ""Lena Younger"" is wonderfully and beautifully played by Claudia McNeil, the Son aka ""Brother/Walter Lee Younger"" is played by the incomparable Sidney Poitier in what I think is one of his best roles ever.  Daughter/Sister ""Beneatha aka Benny"" played by the beautiful and talented Diana Sands is great as the ""non-assimilationist"" daughter who is smitten with an African Exchange Student and dates a wealthy black collegian.  Ruby Dee is Walter Lee's wife ""Ruth"", who struggles with a ""surprise"" pregnancy and her role as wife/daughter-in-law/and mother in this mercurial family.

directed by Daniel Petrie

approx. 2 hours 10 minutes

This is the black and white version of Lorraine Hansberry's classic book on the black experience in the United States.

The story revolves around a family in Chicago's housing projects who are awaiting money from an insurance policy.  Each member of the family has a different perspective on life as well as a different idea of what should be done with the money.  Sidney Poitier's character Walter wants to invest it in a business while his mother, (played by Claudia McNeil) plans to buy a house for the family.  But money isn't the only issue that's addressed.  The Beneatha character espouses atheist viewpoints and a strong connection to Africa.  Meanwhile  Walter's marriage seems like its on its last leg due to stress and confusion of the couple.  The movie paints a vivid picture of domestic issues as well as many of the social problems of the time.

This version takes place almost entirely inside their apartment, maintaining a feel of a stage play.  The acting is wonderful all around, and the writing is excellent.  Highly recommended!",1177286400,,1132,4.858638743455497

2324894,5,B0009VDJQ2,"For one who has never had the chance to se this luminous film, you have a rare treat in store. Lorraine Hansberry adapted her NY Drama Critics Circle Award-winning drama for the screen in 1961. It is a deeply compassionate film with an ensemble cast unequaled in its day.

Hansberry had the power to translate a black family's struggles into a universal parable that bears repeated viewing for its magnificent dialogue, rich black and white photography and unforgettable performances.

It was the film that launched not only Sidney Poitier's career, and also inspired the start of so many other careers for talented African-Americans. Claudia McNeil's performance is towering as Lena Younger, her final soliloquy (""Have You Cried for That Boy Today?"") one of the most moving highlights of the film.

Ruby Dee's nuanced portrayal of Ruth Younger is one in which the actress is completely immersed in her character: beautiful, vulnerable, tenacious. Even when the script calls for Ruth to be resigned, grief-stricken or fatigued, she is infused with life and is always very, very beautiful.

Diana Sands also delivers a bravura role as Lena's headstrong daughter, providing much of the comic relief in the script.

The pacing of Daniel Petrie's direction is flawless and Lawrence Rosenthal's musical score heartrending.

My only complaint is that Columbia Pictures has not yet released a fully-remastered, two disc special edition of this  historic film. The package provides a ""widecreen"" version of the film on one side and a full-screen version on the other. The film source run on the full-screen side is slightly off-speed, painfully evident inmusical pitch of the main title. So buyers should just move to the wide-screen side, which
has a warmer transfer with the source film running on-speed. I can only imagine the gifts Criterion collection would bestow on this timeless work.

One of my top-20 for over thirty years.",1155081600,,1925,5.167202572347267
2324895,5,B0009VDJQ2,"This adaptation of Lorraine Hansberry's compelling play is marvelously executed.  Credit goes in no small part to the wonderful cast (Sidney Poitier as the mercurial Walter Lee Younger, the legendary Ruby Dee as his wife, Ruth, Diana Sands as his spirited sister, Beneatha, and Claudia McNeil as the matriarch, Lena Younger).

RAISIN is centered on the Younger family.  When Lena Younger, the mother and head of the family, is widowed, she is left with $10,000.00 in insurance money.  The family must decide how to spend the inheritance.  It is between funding her daughter, Beneatha's education and purchasing a house for the family.  Walter Lee wants to invest part of the inheritance in a business (specifically, a liquor store).

This film examines the African-American experience in 1950s Chicago, where racial tensions are strong (and remain so today).  There is also an underlying examination of the strain existing in the African-American experience in the United States (specifically, in the experiences and conflicts in the identity of Beneatha, Walter Lee's younger sister).  An example of the tension between the African and African-American experience is really illustrated in Beneatha's interest in African culture and her commitment to establishing pride in her identity.  This play is truly a groundbreaking, important and truly original look at the African-American experience.  I really reccomend that everyone see it!  This is also a great introduction to legendary actors, Sidney Poitier and Ruby Dee.",1153180800,,1521,5.452991452991453
2324896,5,B0009VDJQ2,"The performance given by Poitier will not dissappoint. This movie version of the play is done from the view point of the son as oppossed to the view point of the mother, Lena. This work is timeless.",1142294400,,198,4.378378378378378
2324897,5,B0009VDJQ2,"In terms of cinematography and multidimensional characterization this film is flawless. Claudia McNeil does a superb job as Mama, the head of the Younger family. She depicts successfully the foundation that the family needs in times of both trouble and struggle. For instance, in the one scene after Walter is about to give in to ""the man"" and his sister is disgusted with him, Mama quickly advises her to understand that ""there is always something left to love."" This is a recurrent idea embedded in the film: through thick and thin, troubled times or good, the essence of moving forward, being successful, is to look past mistakes and try to see the good in all, especially those who are closest to you.

The other characters are also multifaceted, not only having good characteristics, but also negative ones. Walter seems to be a man who struggles with alcohol, Ruth struggles to cope with the idea of bringing another child in the world, and Beneatha is often impatient and rude to those who don't think like her. Yet, it is through these faults that the characters become stronger. The whole concept of self-reformation is prevalent in many of the moments of the film, as the characters try not only to accept others, but become better themselves in some way for the benefit of the family.

The film really is a testament to not only the situation of African-American families in the 1950s but the struggle of any family trying to better their situation in life. After the Younger family receives the check for ten thousand dollars they try to figure out what would be the best thing to invest this in. Walter Lee (Sidney Pointier), the movie's protagonist, has dreams of giving his son Travis and family a better life than he had, and decides to try to invest the money in a risky investment, a liquor store. While this turns out to be a foolish mistake, it is his realization of what is important for family that becomes the essence of his character.  His sister, Beneatha, is perhaps his complete opposite being a college student who is all about free thinking, and has big dreams of being a doctor. All in all, the family struggles to not only exist in an apartment making ends meat, but to gain the foundation for getting ahead in life.

One of the major morals of the film is the importance of keeping family together. There are many instances where the family appears to be falling apart, but Mama continues to help everyone resolve their disputes for the common good of everyone's interests, and she also inflects the values that her late husband had onto both Walter and Beneatha.

Another great aspect of this film is the ability to keep the feel of the play alive. Most movies have a hard time transferring from play to movie without losing much of the significance and essence intended, but this film almost comes across exactly as the play. There are great performances all around, and this is a movie that will make you think deeply about the struggles of not only past generations, but also the struggles of ""making it"" in today's world.",1140393600,,3058,4.708411214953271
2324908,5,B0009VDJQ2,"My applause goes to director, Daniel Petrie, for a masterpiece movie that concentrated on one set of a black family's small apartment, in the projects of Chicago.  This movie shows every hardship that black families went through in the fifties. A Raisin in the Sun movie is a remake of Lorraine Hansberry's classic stage play of how a black family tries to escape from their crowded apartment life to a house in an all white neighborhood. Sidney Politer delivered his usual outstanding performance in this film, which sends a message about the limited opportunities open to blacks in this time period. My favorite character was Mama, played by Claudia McNeil. She did an excellent job showing how the mother is always the backbone of black families through every trial and tribulation. I am not usually a fan of black and white movies, but this movie displayed a wonderful storyline for me to understand the struggle they went through. There was never a movie that I can think of that was this excellent with one set most of the movie and was in black and white. The part of the movie that meant a lot to me is how Mama took the money she received and did something with it that would benefit the whole family. Overall, each main character portrayed a strong black person.  For example, Walter Lee realized that he is suppose to follow behind his father and be a strong black man and raise a family. Ruth always stood by her husband no matter his wrongs, Beneatha was a young black student going to college to be doctor and Mama was just their for any of her family member's and remain strong for everyone.",1133049600,,1606,4.611888111888112

2324911,5,B0009VDJQ2,"With perhaps the best cast ever assembled for this play, David Susskind's 1961 production of Raisin in the Sun is a classic film and a landmark achievement during the civil rights struggles of the early 1960s. Starring a young Sidney Poitier as Walter Lee, Claudia McNeil as his mother Lena Younger, Ruby Dee as his wife Ruth, and Diana Sands as his sister Beneatha, the film closely follows the script of the play, and director Daniel Petrie wisely confines the setting almost entirely to one room, as it is on stage. This intensifies the emotions and interactions of this three-generation family, which share a small, two-bedroom apartment in South Chicago, and makes their longing to break free obvious both visually and emotionally.

Sidney Poitier as Walter Lee is the ""giant...surrounded by ants"" as he dreams of escaping his job as a chauffeur and investing in a liquor store. Poitier's body language and subtle gestures as he argues about how to spend his mother's ten thousand dollar life insurance check powerfully convey his anguish. The close-up of Poitier's slow transition from an insolent and angry young man to a tearful and repentant son in one scene with his mother is unforgettable. Claudia McNeil, as the mother, is stalwart, strong, and full of pride. Ruby Dee, as the devoted wife, trying to decide whether to have an abortion in order to lighten her husband's load, is simultaneously resolute and resigned. Diana Sands, as Beneatha, the agnostic medical student, reflecting the beginning of the ""Roots"" and ""Black Power"" movements, provides some comic relief as she practices African ""home-from-the-hunt"" dances.

At the heart of the play is the issue of discrimination against black people and the limitations on their dreams, and the filming in black and white is appropriate. The small dying houseplant that Lena nurtures remains the major symbol here, as it is in the play, but through the cinematography new symbols emerge. The kitchen cupboard door opens and shuts as family members open and shut themselves to each other and the outside world, and numerous scenes take place between two people with a door in the background, opening and closing as their emotions change.

2324912,5,B0009VDJQ2,"I just finished watching this spectacular movie, A Raisin In The Sun. My eyes are still moist from the tears...

I will not ruin your viewing of this spectacular piece of film by telling the story, but I will outline some facts:

This movie chronicles the basic dilemma of life which is: whether a person's skin is white, black, purple or green, a person wants to have dignity in their life and to have a place of their own to call home. That is the driving force behind this movie. Angst and drama is present on a daily basis as the characters discuss life, money, family and death. Metaphors and symbolism abound throughout the production. Even though the movie plays out primarily on one set (an apartment in the projects of Chicago), the viewer does not get the feeling of being closed in or claustrophoic. On the contrary, the dreams of the family are so big that they over-flow outside the walls of their small and dingy apartment.

Mama, (Claudia McNeal) who was the matriarch and the backbone of the family was my favorite character. She was unbelieveable! Her worry over her family was metaphored in the plant that she constantly fussed over. What an amazing woman.

Sidney Poitier was... I cannot find the words. His performance should have won him an oscar. He goes throughout the movie trying to find himself, but in the end he realizes what really matters.

The supporting cast was excellent. I cannot think of one negative thing to say about this movie. It was wonderful. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",1121904000,,1523,4.605166051660516
2324913,5,B0009VDJQ2,"So much drama with very little props. Sibling spats are the best though, in typical Poitier fashion, he slaps someone and triumphs over racial oppression. This is one movie you'll want to watch enough times to memorize it. ""Walter Lee Younger, it is time for you to GET UP and go to work!"" ""You're just a happy little woman this morning."" ""He's mad, boy."" ""In my mother's house there is still God."" ""Willie! Willie!?""",1115251200,,417,4.648648648648648
2324914,5,B0009VDJQ2,"With perhaps the best cast ever assembled for this play, David Susskind's 1961 production of Raisin in the Sun is a classic film and a landmark achievement during the civil rights struggles of the early 1960s.  Starring a young Sidney Poitier as Walter Lee, Claudia McNeil as his mother Lena Younger, Ruby Dee as his wife Ruth, and Diana Sands as his sister Beneatha, the film closely follows the script of the play, and director Daniel Petrie wisely confines the setting almost entirely to one room, as it is on stage.  This intensifies the emotions and interactions of this three-generation family, which share a small, two-bedroom apartment in South Chicago, and makes their longing to break free obvious both visually and emotionally.
Sidney Poitier as Walter Lee is the ""giant...surrounded by ants"" as he dreams of escaping his job as a chauffeur and investing in a liquor store. Poitier's body language and subtle gestures as he argues about how to spend his mother's ten thousand dollar life insurance check powerfully convey his anguish.  The close-up of Poitier's slow transition from an insolent and angry young man to a tearful and repentant son in one scene with his mother is unforgettable.  Claudia McNeil, as the mother, is stalwart, strong, and full of pride.  Ruby Dee, as the devoted wife, trying to decide whether to have an abortion in order to lighten her husband's load, is simultaneously resolute and resigned.  Diana Sands, as Beneatha, the agnostic medical student, reflecting the beginning of the ""Roots"" and ""Black Power"" movements, provides some comic relief as she practices African ""home-from-the-hunt"" dances.
At the heart of the play is the issue of discrimination against black people and the limitations on their dreams, and the filming in black and white is appropriate.  The small dying houseplant that Lena nurtures remains the major symbol here, as it is in the play, but through the cinematography new symbols emerge.  The kitchen cupboard door opens and shuts as family members open and shut themselves to each other and the outside world, and numerous scenes take place between two people with a door in the background, opening and closing as their emotions change.  The film quality and its high contrast have withstood the test of time, the sound is good, and the acting, especially as revealed in the close-ups, makes this a classic film, better than any stage version I have ever seen or imagined.

2324915,5,B0009VDJQ2,"This is acting at its best. Not only for African American Actorsand Actress,but for acting period. The story is based on the everyday struggles of a Black family. The story is based sometimes in the early 60ds or late 50ds but these struggles still go on today. As a black women in the struggle I related to every part of the story, not only do we get knocked down by the world as per say, but we also get knocked down by our own people. Black men try hard to find a way to take care of their families and sometimes things look better on the other side, as brother in the story does he trusts his friends because his mother trusts him and things go bad for him, but out of every thing bad comes something good, I don't want to tell the story for those who hasn't seen it, the family still go own to move on with their plans and whole their heads up high as they go on and that makes the struggle even better, as least the family still has their self worth and dignity. And as usual Momma the head of the family per say teaches them lesson and also teaches them a lesson in the lost that they experince. always keep your head up and never do anything to loose your self worth or your diginty.

2324916,5,B0009VDJQ2,"In Lorraine Hansberry's masterpiece, A Raisin in the Sun, we are shown a world-wide crisis with which we deal with to this day: the importance of our reality and our dreams.
Walter Lee Younger's father, who in the plot has recently deceased, left his family an insurance policy worth $10,000 (which is approximately worth $60,000 or $70,000 in today's monitary value).  Despite their sorrow, they are ecstatic because they can all now make something of their lives.  Unfortunately, they all have big plans with the money and, once again unfortunate, it involves the majority of the amount.
Walter Lee wants to start a business with two friends and make a promising future for his son, Travis; Beneatha Younger, his sister, needs money to pay for her medical school; Lena Younger, his mother, has always wanted a house with a backyard so her grandson, Travis, can play; and his wife, Ruth Younger, desperately wants to move out of the ""hole"" they currently live in.
Lena takes it upon herself to go out and put a down payment on a house in a completely white neighborhood.  Walter Lee is then dumbfounded.  After many drunken incidents and pleadings, Walter Lee convinces his mother, Lena, to give the money to him so that he can start being the man of the family.  After not following his mother's strict orders to place some of that money to pay for Beneatha's education, the money is all gone in one bad investment.
Without giving away the complexity of the ending, you can imagine what happens to his self-esteem and his likeness in the house.  There are multiple interpretations on a specific meaning to the story, but one that is perhaps impartial in criticism, would be that having a dream is what keeps us striving for the next best thing in our lives.
As mentioned in the movie in reference to judgment, ""Make sure you done take into account what hills and valleys he come through before he got to wherever he is.""  It's in that part of the play the idea of the story is exhibited.
Truly a great play, both in text and on film.  However, there are slight differences in the text as compared to the film.  These differences are very minor and do not effect the story, or the idea of the story, in any way.  Recommended as a leisure film or for analysis.",1066262400,,2260,4.6275
2324917,5,B0009VDJQ2,"Sidney Poiter's portrayal as Walter Lee was phenomenal! Poiter captured the very essence of what it is to be a African American man hungry for a dream. It is interesting in the story and in the general plot how with his father's insurance money how he can began to start his dream. He continues to plot and envision with his buddies as to how he will take hold of something finally and create with his own mind what is and what ought to be. Later he is seen as a fragmented man, dried out at the bones for what seems a vision loss. It is amazing how Lorraine Hansberry captivates the audience with the highs and the lows of all the characters.  The bodacious younger sister who is captivated by everything that ever was; knowledge during this time meaningful of influence and power. The divisions of the haves and simply the have nots. The strivings for the mother to make a better life for herself and her two grown children is imperative.
Either way the development of the story carries the viewer from glory to glory.  Walter Lee 's dream looms as big as life, and you can almost hear yourself deflate as his dream goes looming by. It is captivating to see the family still overcome such a difficult blow by still remembering what matters the most --  each other.
This movie can be critique a million different ways and I suppose I will be reviewing it again and again. An African American man with a vision, a dream, a goal accomplished and fulfilled is a beautiful thing. One can strive towards essentially everything but as a people we know that being mediocre is not allowed. To be the best at whatever he wanted to be was Walter Lee's desire. . . For the most crucial thing of all for any man is to stand up and be just that a man. Regardless, as to the choices one makes in getting there the power of accomplishing just that gives one the UMPH to survive after having reached whatever star or attained whatever vision.
I think that Lorraine Hansbury's insight into a very significant scenario still exists today. The very ideal that Walter Lee had a dream of becoming in terms of society's idea of somebody still looms today in the hearts and minds of many men. The mere fact that he wanted a better string of pearls for his wife is indeed a fact that he reckoned with the ""quality of his life"" everyday.",1061251200,,2313,4.437647058823529

2324939,5,B0009VDJQ2,"The <i>Hollywood Citizen-News</i> dubbed this ""One of the most powerful films to grace the 1961 screen.""  I'd say that time has proven this to be one of the most powerful films to hit the screen in any year.
The character Walter Lee is a man driven to the edge of insanity by the prospect of seeing his dream slip right through his fingers. A dream that he thinks is his only way up. Sidney Poitier, who is <i>the</i> finest, most natural actor I have ever seen, plays this part flawlessly. Ruby Dee, Diane Sands, and Claudia McNeil also strike stunning, emotional performances as the family members dealing with not only Walter Lee's downward spiral, but also with their own issues and inner turmoil.
In keeping with its origins, the cinematography of the movie retains many aspects of a play, and is thus unlike modern movies that cater to the growing attention deficit of our society. However, the content and fine performances will capture your attention, regardless of what you are now used to seeing. The turmoil will be familiar to many people. The conflicts brought up here are classic social conditions experienced by many different types of people all around the world... whether it is due to skin color, religion, money or other class distinction. For this reason, I feel this movie will strike a cord with people from many different backgrounds.
The quality of the DVD is superb. I noticed no degradation of the picture or sound quality. There are subtitle options for English, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean, and Thai.
The movie's 1961 preview, which is one of the extras, begins with a ""Message to Moviegoers"" by the producer, David Susskind. I would like to quote his words, because they do ring absolutely true of this movie:
""Here is entertainment which is rare and unique... [W]hen you see this picture you will live it. After you leave the theatre, you will talk about it, and for a long time afterward you will remember <i>A Raisin in the Sun</i>.""

2324942,5,B0009VDJQ2,"The title of this film is taken from a line from a Langston Hughes poem called ""A Dream Deferred"":

What happens to a dream deferred?

Does it dry up
like a raisin in the sun
Or fester like a sore-

And then run?
Does it stink like rotten meat?
Or crust and sugar over-

Like a syrupy sweet?

Maybe it just sags
like a heavy load.

Or does it explode?

""A Raisin In The Sun"", an award-winning Broadway stage play brought to the screen, is a story about dreams. Everyone in this film has them, but the question is, do they ever come true? Do you have to put that dream on hold because of other circumstances beyond your control, until it consumes you to do something unthinkable? Or in order to reach that dream you want to come true so badly, you decide to take another route to get it? Or you just let it die, and you are forever regretting not taking the necessary steps to make that dreams a reality?

I first saw this on television umpteen years ago and in school, and I was touched by the whole plot. In the 1950s, an African-American family living in a Chicago tenement obtains a large amount of money from an insurance policy due to the death of the patriarch, and his widow (Claudia McNeil) decides to use a large portion of it as a down payment on a home in the suburbs, which is a thrill to everyone in the family, except her petulant son Walter Lee (Sidney Poitier). Walter Lee has dreams of his own, and wants the insurance money for another purpose.

Walter Lee's headstrong, witty and socially conscious younger sister, Beneatha (Diana Sands), is a college student who has dreams of going to medical school and becoming a doctor and in the meanwhile, trying desperately to identify with her African roots after meeting a Nigerian exchange student (Ivan Dixon). This is a major ingredient in the script, being that this was written shortly after the birth of the Civil Rights Movement, several years before the Black Panthers were formed and at least 15 years before the women's liberation movement. Will she ever get there? Meanwhile, Walter Lee and his mother continuously clash until his mother finally breaks down and gives him a portion of the money, but she is very careful about how she wants him to use it.

Meanwhile, the residents of the white suburban neighborhood where this family wants to move don't want them there. Later on, a decision must be made. Should they move to this beautiful new home where they aren't really wanted, or take the white neighbors up on their offer to buy the house back from them with a profit?

The entire cast, which is the original Broadway ensemble, is stellar, especially Claudia McNeil's amazing portrayal of the widowed Lena Younger, Walter Lee's mother. She is nothing short of phenomenal - she is a proud woman, a tower of strength in the face of tragedy and although she herself is suffering, she is able to put her own grief aside to comfort the other family members. This is clearly Sidney Poitier's finest role, right up there with playing Virgil Tibbs in 1967's ""In The Heat of the Night"". Exploding with intensity, he accurately nails down the frustrations and pain of a black man who wants for much more for himself and his family, and pins his hopes on an unyielding dream. Ruby Dee plays Ruth, Walter Lee's wife, a beautiful woman of quiet dignity who is struggling with conflicts of her own. Also appearing in his first movie role is future Oscar winner Louis Gossett, Jr. as George Murchison, an articulate and well-to-do college student.

This is still a relevant  topic today, even though this film was made over 40 years ago because these  things are still happening. Lorraine Hansberry, the playwright, was inspired to write this masterpiece by her own experience of moving to an all-white Chicago suburb as a child, and the very public genrification story of entertainer Nat King  Cole, who faced the same kind of bigotry when he brought a house in  a wealthy white neighborhood in California in 1948.
