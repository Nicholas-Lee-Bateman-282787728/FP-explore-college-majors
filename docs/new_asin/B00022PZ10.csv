8020918,4,B00022PZ10,Love vampire movies and love Kennedy Johnston.  This hit the daily double for me.  I am a happy customer! I already had a VHS version.  DVD is better.,1347753600,,150,4.285714285714286
8020919,5,B00022PZ10,"I just recently became aware of the Donald Glut movies; this one is a pretty good one.  Its a B movie.  No big budget, just beautiful girls in hot scenes.

If you like this one try Mummy's Kiss and/or Mummy's Kiss ( Second Dynasty ).  Even BETTER!",1227571200,,247,4.191489361702128

8020921,3,B00022PZ10,"Well, I've never been a serious fan of ""Dracula"" movies, except when there were lots of babes running around in flimsy veils etc.  [:-)  Lately, I had been searching for more exposure of the dark haired beauty ""Kennedy Johnston"" and when I saw her listed as staring in this production, I went for it.  The opening scene of ""Orgy of Blood"" made the purchase worth while for me.  After that, I did find her in a pool with another dark haired sweetie but that did it for me.

Finally watched and listened to comments about the production.  They were very interesting, Dracula &/or (Paul Naschy) fans WILL enjoy the commentary and background information.  Watch it with a friend.  [:-\",1122595200,4,681,4.663865546218488
8020922,3,B00022PZ10,"First off, i want to say that Lolana is in this movie. Such a babe, a hottie, her alone is worth the purchase of this movie. Second, i would like to say that Lolana is in this movie! :) 5 Stars for Lolana, and -2 stars for the movie. So add or subtract that all up, 3 stars. The movie is set in the 1st century. Very old costumes, and time line. That alone makes the movie almost completely unwatchable. But my favorite adult actress Lolana, makes up for that. I think if the director and or producer made a movie with a 2000+ or even 1990's setting, they'd probably make a good movie. But this one, set in early times, really sucks. if they made a new setting type one, 1990'+ i'd see it. Well, they better put Lolana back in it! :)

Where ever you are Lolana, I love you! no wait, i LUST you! lol",1116720000,2,798,4.050632911392405
8020923,3,B00022PZ10,"This 2004 direct-to-video erotic horror film starts off in 1897 Southern California where Countess Dracula gets the old stake-in-the-heart treatment when a local rancher finds her in the sack (and sucking the neck, among other things) of his wife.

Fast-forward to the present, where the local vampires are running around doing their sucking thing when one stumbles onto the body of the Countess, and of course, brings her back to life.

Things predictably suck forward from there until the Countess once again meets an untimely end with the stake thing. There's plenty of nudity and sex action, of course, mostly lesbian.

Yeah, it's really bad, and even worse, there isn't a sharp frame in the entire movie, but hey, you want your nudity and lesbian action sharp, too? Jeesh.",1103328000,17,777,5.007751937984496
8020924,2,B00022PZ10,"As a lover of horror i knew from the title this one would be a cheezer but with Paul Naschy i figured it might be not so bad. Wrong! The bad acting and bad lines were good times to grab a snack in between lesbian love scenes. The babes are quality and there are lots of them but thats about all. Naschy was around from time to time but did little to improve this grade C attempt. If you want porn buy porn, if you want a vampire movie try something else. Mystery Science Theatre has shown and made fun of much better movies than this.",1094774400,21,534,4.047169811320755
8020925,3,B00022PZ10,"Writer director Donald Glut is currently the last man standing in imaginative and intelligent erotic horror.  His unfortunately titled ""Countess Dracula's Orgy of Blood"" brings expertise and reverence to the vampire genre, plus a welcome heterosexuality that has been drained (pun intended) by the likes of Ann Rice, Clive Barker, David DeCoteau, and their imitators.  Unlike the horror-ignorant productions from Seduction Cinema, Troma, Playboy Films, and lesser filmmakers that exploit the vampire form for dull, formulaic T&A, Glut's eroticism rises FROM the sub-genre's conventions.  He essentially brings out the sexuality which the Universal and even Hammer films could only hint at, making it delightfully profane.  To that end he is wonderfully assisted by an amazing Glori Ann-Gilbert, whose unrestrained performance as a sexually insatiable, erotically beautiful vampire hits every fantasy mark.  There is also a fleeting turn by iconic Spanish Horror star Paul Naschy as a tortured monk that provides a rewarding link to the past and reflects Glut's appreciation for it.  Though the movie is hampered by low-budget realities and some unnecessary intentional campiness, it's the best erotic horror film in years, and a key step in Glut's ascent to major minor filmmaker.",1087689600,9,1280,5.572164948453608
8020926,1,B00022PZ10,"The only reason the film even gets one star is due to the performance of Paul Naschy. He is the only individual who appears in this film who even deserves to be called an actor.
I purchased this film expecting something impressive, since I am a huge Naschy fan. Unfortunately, even the presence of one of my all-time favorite horror actors/directors could not polish this turd enough to make it shine.
I truly hope and pray that Tomb of the Werewolf, Naschy's second US film, lives up to the legend. Unless you are a horny teenager looking for a movie filled with plenty of T&A, you will be very disappointed with this film.",1087516800,8,624,4.530973451327434
8020927,4,B00022PZ10,"The title here promises a lot, and thanks to the presence of voloptuous star Glori-Anne Gilbert - it most certainly delivers.  Fans that have seen the delectable Ms. Gilbert in films like TREASURE HUNT and CURSE OF THE KOMODO, can now see her darker side as she portrays the sinister seductive neck-biting Countess. Yes there's abundant nudity, but what really makes the show is how Glori-Anne turns what could have been a rather one-note role into a tour de force perfomance.  Not since Ingrid Pitt, in the classic Hammer Film THE VAMPIRE LOVERS, has there been such a multi-dimensional vampiress on the screen.
It's amazing to think how this upcoming star will do with future turns in even bigger, more mainstream films.  Truly, if you're a fan of this lovely lady, this is a must-have dvd.  Check it out!",1087171200,13,807,4.784172661870503
