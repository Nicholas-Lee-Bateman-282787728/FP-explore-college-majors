1849207,3,B00008K79S,"This Treasure Island is the animated special that aired on CBS in the early 70's at Thanksgiving time. It's created by Air Programs International (API), and was part of the ""Famous Classic Tales"" series.

If you grew up during the 70's you probably remember these specials. Treasure Island was one of the best of them. It's well voiced--with Australian actor Ron Haddrick as Long John Silver. Distinctive API animation and nice music too. Certainly worth having, if you remember it.

The show has been available on VHS from time to time, but this is the first time it has been on DVD. Unfortunately the quality of the DVD is not so good. I'd give it four stars if the DVD quality was a little better.",1097798400,2,700,4.592

7984953,4,B00008K79S,"A wonderful, modern retelling of a classic. This version brings to bare, the story we all have known with some refreshing back story of key characters and delivers it into the current age. This two-part film no longer leans on the genius of the original story, but marries it with the look and quality of modern digital film making.",1433721600,,332,4.6440677966101696

7984955,4,B00008K79S,"This version of Treasure Island is very well done - the acting is solid, sets and costuming are quite good, and the pacing is excellent - especially considering it's split across 2 segments.  Eddie Izzard as Long John Silver is likeably menacing and Tony Regbo is the perfect Jim Hawkins.  All in all, this one is a lot of fun to watch.",1403568000,,336,4.403225806451613
