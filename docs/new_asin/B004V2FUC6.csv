8511779,4,B004V2FUC6,"SHEMAROO subtitles all the songs of ""Nigahen."" SPARK does not subtitle the songs of ""Nigahen."" This is the biggest difference between the two editions of this movie.

The SHEMAROO edition of ""Nigahen"" displays a logo throughout the movie after the opening credits. The SPARK edition displays no logos or watermarks.

The subtitles for the dialogue in the SHEMAROO edition ""stick"" for about 2 minutes about halfway through the movie (at least they do in my copy).

The movie itself is a good sequel to ""Nagina"" with many good songs. I prefer the SHEMAROO edition because SHEMAROO subtitles its songs. (SHEMAROO subtitles all the songs in ""Nagina"" as well. SPARK and EAGLE do not subtitle the songs of ""Nagina."")",1305417600,3,710,5.0
