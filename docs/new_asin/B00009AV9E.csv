1882589,4,B00009AV9E,"From a technical viewpoint, this must rank as one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The ""feel"" was like that of a soap opera, the sound poor, and script, well... let's not go there.

However, the story itself is powerful and important. At last, someone had the guts to show the bigotry, hypocrisy and outright hate of the religious right in America, which cherry-picks from the bible in order to justify homophobia, while ignoring other equally important messages in the bible. The fact that their bile can result in innocent loss of life is immaterial to them.

From this point of view, ""The Last Year"" outclasses 90% of all other movies, including so-called ""blockbusters"", which are generally devoid of any real substance or meaning. So... well done, and thanks for having made this film!",1116892800,10,795,4.838235294117647
1882590,4,B00009AV9E,"I thought this film was very good...for a low budget independent film.  The acting was good overall, though hardly Oscar worthy.  The lighting, sound, and video quality were ok. The film is about 3 gay men who find themselves at a very conservative bible college.  It deals with the repression, harassment, difficulties, and stresses that exist in such environments, especially when one is coming to terms with being gay.  It also explores the friendship, loyalty, happiness, hope, joys, love, and beauty that can develop even in the harshest of places.  People considering buying this film should understand that this is a low budget, independent film. It should not be compared with films that have much, much bigger budgets and a lot more resources but instead should be judged for what the actors, writers, directors, and other crewmembers managed to accomplish with the resources at their disposal.  I think they did a very good job!

  I don't understand a lot of the harsh criticism about this film.  I certainly don't believe the ""review"" that claimed that the owner of a small video chain was removing this video from all his stores because of all the complaints.  This is pure bunk!!!  I believe that there is more to these types of reviews than meets the eye.  Perhaps the ""critics"" of this film object to the context of this film and the message it sends out.  Believe it or not, things like what happened in this film DO happen.  I am not a bible-thumping Christian nor am I an atheist.  I have no agenda.  I'm just a regular guy who enjoys good movies, even low budget ones!!!

  I bought this film despite some misgivings.  I really believed a lot of the bad stuff that had been written about this film, but decided that it would be, at best, good for a good laugh.  Throughout the film, I kept waiting for all of the ""bad and horrible"" acting, directing, sound and light quality that some ""reviewers"" said were in this film but none of it ever showed up.  To be fair, this film was not perfect.  It DID have some major flaws and stuff, but hey, how many ""thumbs up"" Hollywood films do as well???  And a lot of these bad Hollywood films have huge budgets.  This film had a small budget - I can't stress this enough!!!

  Generally speaking, I think that the people involved in this film, from the director to the actors to the writers, all did a very good job.  This is why I give this film 4 outta 5 stars.  I recommend this film.  Check it out!!!",1094688000,19,2463,4.552511415525114
1882591,1,B00009AV9E,"I thought this film was about the worst thing I have ever seen. Ron Nikolas was ok, but script, the lighting, sound and directing was worse than a high school film project. The rest of the cast looks like they are reading their lines from cue cards and the concept of the plot is stupid. Honestly I usually do not write online reviews but this lame excuse for a movie upset me so much I had to write something about it. There has been a huge step forward in the quality of gay themed films, and this thing sets it back it zero. It doesn't even deserve one star. It deserves a big fat zero! I don't know what the director, Jeff London, was thinking when he made this complete mess, but he obviously didn't have much to loose as it was obviously shot on video with home-made music to boot! (...)STAY AWAY from this thing! That's all it is...A THING! Calling it a ""movie"" gives it to much credit and makes ""The attack of the killer tomatoes"" seem like an acclaimed epic. I actually yelled at the manager of the video store when I returned it and he said he is pulling it from the small chain of stores he owns as many people have complained about how horrible it is.

Still, the situations are well portrayed in an almost ""DEBATE""-like mode, presenting many sides of the situation, tho' very contrived at times. Thusly the generalized Homophobia is presented within a Christian format but with a well documented rebuttal.

With a few changes, this same film could have been made more believable with a ""regular"" college backdrop, as most of the same ""problems"" exist therein.",1054857600,3,352,5.192982456140351
1882595,1,B00009AV9E,"Although I don't regard Last Year as a complete waste, it certainly doesn't present a very realistic view of life at a small Bible college. I spent three years at a small Baptist university in a small town and my spouse spent four years at a moderately sized Presbyterian university, so we spent much of the movie cringing at the conflicts between our observations of reality and the portrayals in the movie.
From the description, we expected to see young gay men struggling to reconcile their sexual identity with their religious convictions. Indeed, from comments by the actors and director/writer/producer in the additional material on the DVD, that was the intent. However, two of the gay characters came to the college by mandate of their parents and had little or no religious conviction and the third had obviously discarded much, if not all, of his religious belief as he had embraced his gay identity. The frequent mention of St. Jude and the few seconds he is portrayed on screen prior to the end credits doesn't qualify as reconciliation of gay identity and religious (Christian) dogma. The reference to St. Jude is problematic as well, since emphasis on saints is a Catholic reference and all the other religious references in the film imply the college setting is a Protestant/Fundamentalist, possibly Baptist or Pentecostal.
The production quality of the movie is dismayingly amateurish, as is the performance of most of the actors.  Although some of the scenes seem to have been actually filmed in the facilities of a small school, which added the benefits of existing ambient sound, the sound effects and score were very lacking. And, as much as I have often joined in condemning movie and television producers who fail to utilize gay actors to play gay parts, it would have certainly improved the quality of Last Year to have cast straight actors in at least some of the straight roles. It was almost impossible to suspend belief and see Robby as anything other than gay. In the most confrontational scene between the gay bashing jocks and Paul, it almost seems like Paul and the lead jock want to kiss as they stand nose to nose. And, in fact, the outtakes include that scene ending with Paul leaning the additional inch in and planting a kiss on the jock's lips. Another criticism I have of the casting is that I saw no chemistry between the actors portraying Paul and Alex, although these are the two characters that develop a physical and emotional relationship as the film progresses. Mike Dolan, who portrays Alex, brings the most professional and close to believable performance to the movie, but it simply isn't enough.
As for cautions, I think anyone with unresolved issues about suicide might want to skip this movie. Also the movie really doesn't provide any serious help to resolving gay identity and religious conviction; so if you are struggling with this issue, don't expect too much help there either. If you want to see a movie for light entertainment, I wouldn't discourage you from Last Year. But it is better as a rental rather than a purchase, because I am not sure many would want to devote the time to watching it a second time.",1052265600,13,3168,4.834254143646409
1882596,5,B00009AV9E,"What a lovely discovery! This bittersweet little film by Jeff London
examines the lives of three young gay men at various stages of being
out, attending a 'Christian' college.

Hector (Merrick McMahon) has been outed, is being persecuted by the
Dean and his jock henchmen, and shunned by classmates. Alex (gentle and
winning Mike Dolan) is new at the school, though a senior, because his
father hopes the religious environment will cure him of 'a certain
young man' from home. Beautiful and troubled Paul (played perfectly by
Ron Petronicolos) is deep in the closet after being compromised in a
library restroom over the summer. He hides his homosexuality at first,
but soon tells his room-mate and best friend Robby (Patrick Hoesterey).
Robby is straight, and unpleasantly surprised, but quickly overcomes
his reservations because of his love for Paul.

The four boys become a little family and try to protect each other from
the violence, intolerance, hate, and hypocrisy that surrounds them.
Each character is lovingly drawn, and they all change in remarkable
ways. Alex falls in love with Paul and leads him towards the light of
self-realization and personal commitment. Hector, unfortunately, is not
so lucky. They are all watched over by St. Jude, who appears briefly in
one of the dearest moments in the film.

There are flaws and stretches of credulity in the story, but the
overwhelming sincerity and heartfelt nature of the writing and acting
negate such quibbles.

The outtakes are serendipitous, nicely edited and really funny --
happily so after the seriousness of the film. The interviews reveal the
actors to be just as sweet, supportive, humorous, and genuine as they
are on screen.",1051574400,37,1698,5.097122302158273

The actual storyline wasn't original (I've seen this rank & file many times before) and it was made too episodal with the predictable, annoying <Fade Out,> <Fade In> technique for spacing scenes for visually setting the story/characters to the proper surroundings or the quick way to ""cut off"" from a scene (or action) without any connection to the next section of the story.  Personally, I prefer a story that flows, rather than one that stops and starts, but that's only an opinion.

Had more financing become available, perhaps a few Actors who understood acting could have been added to the mix of people on-screen.  Too many minutes of awful whining and monotone line reading.  Yes, I thought it sounded read instead of spoken.

I just don't understand it.  Why are all gay-themed films more expensive to purchase than films with similar storylines, but skuewed to a straight orientation?

This movie is no exception, and, like his other movies, is stunningly successful at times and embarrassingly amateur at other times.

I like to end on a good note, so let's start with the ""bad"".  There is too much going on in this overlong movie and many unnecessary and underdeveloped characters which muddy up the central story and theme.  Some of the peripheral actors are really bad.  Some of the dialog is really forced.  (Some of it actually made me squirm.)

1882654,3,B00009AV9E,"Jeff London ('Regarding Billy') seems to be a director and writer who is committed to investigating the various degrees of problems young gay men face as they live in a homophobic society. His films resound with an honest feeling but too often he settles for stereotypes at both ends of the spectrum and that tends to weaken his work.

The setting is a Bible College somewhere in America where hunky Paul (Ron Petronicolos) is entering his 'last year' of study, his summer having been disrupted by an incident that is revealed later in the story.  He re-joins his longtime roommate Robby (Patrick Orion Hoesterey) but keeps asking about his good friend Hector (Merrick McMahon), a subject no one wants to address.  He meets Hector's roommate Alex (Mike Dolan) and gradually Alex lets Paul know that he is gay.  Paul learns that the Bible College has discovered Hector is gay and the Dean (Rand Smith) and his henchmen are out to have Hector expelled.  Paul's changed ways are noted by Robby and he finally confides that his summer incident was a gay experience in a restroom - a fact that Robby finds repulsive at first but soon comes to support Paul's anguish about his parent's disapproval and punishment.

As Paul's feelings for living who he really is surface he finds solace and sanctuary with Alex and the two become lovers.  The Dean's spies gradually intimidate the group of four (Paul, Alex, Hector and Robby) and disciplinary action is taken.  Among Paul's discoveries in his rebellion against the Bible College's stance against gays is the fact that the dean is a closet case and that is the reason for the rough action against Hector (with whom the dean had an assignation).  It all comes to a tragic end for some and a sense of freedom for others - to find out who belongs to which category requires watching the film!

The movie has its moments, due largely to the ability of the actors Petronicolos, Dolan, and McMahon, but it sadly is buried by otherwise mediocre to poor acting from the rest of the cast. The work of Rand Smith, Penelope Ma (who plays the dean's wife), and Lawrence Rinzel (who plays Paul's father) is particularly weak just when strong acting could have supported the flimsier portions of the script.  London needed to spend more thought on Bible Colleges, finding that more razor sharp line between right wing bias against  gays instead of opting for the usual clich?s that are found everywhere.  That dividing line among young men challenged by sexual identity would have made a far more successful film.  But the film is worth watching for the performances of the three lead actors - strong young men each!  Grady Harp, April 06",1145318400,4,2666,4.765217391304348

Normally in my reviews, I start off by offering a brief summation of the plot of the movie. However, since this stinker only played for ten minutes, I don't know much of the plot. Apparently, it's about a religious college student struggling with his sexuality.

In the scene that I saw, the dorm room set looked like it was filmed on a stage, and the acting so wooden that it was unbelievable at best.

The actors are both immature and underdirected, there is no sense of any of the males being or being sensitive to what it is like to be a gay man.  One of the two males who are suppose to be gay in a what should be an intense revealing moment  to a potential love interest, reveals himself by saying ""I'm a homo"",  to me that is like a black man saying ""I'm a nigger""!  The Christian theology at this Christian college is also treated with shallow immature regard for Christianity's struggle with all kinds of new thought.  I hope this movie dissappears quickly, never to return",1123372800,6,630,4.387931034482759

7990489,3,B00009AV9E,"Well, it's not a good film but it has attractive qualities. With more rehearsal and tighter editing it would have been a much better film. Scenes are held too long so that any dramatic tension drains away before the next scene begins. And some of the line readings sound hollow. A few of the actors manage a naturalism that stands out from the stilted proceedings, especially Elizabeth Flesh as Beth and Patrick Orion Hoesterey as Robby. Ron Petronicolos is asked to carry the lion's share of the story. He does well though he needed more support from the director and a script that had a more natural sound and rhythm.
Some day I hope these coming out stories will no longer be traumatic and necessary, but until that time comes, films even as under-budgeted, under-rehearsed and too quickly filmed are necessary. I give it 3 stars for sincerity, some good acting, a few effective scenes and for having its heart in the right place.",1509408000,,933,4.695121951219512
