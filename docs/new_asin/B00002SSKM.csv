Later he acted in a small budgeted, sentimental look at the 50's, film called American Graffitti. As far as I know, I think he later appeared in a very popular hit TV show about the 50's. And that was as much as I knew about Howard's career. I never heard from him again so I thought he was another forgotten TV star...
The next time I heard from Howard, he was directing this film with Steve Martin called Parenthood in 1989.  This was a very good effort and I was deeply moved by the story because I could relate to a lot of what was going on on the screen.  The family dynamics the film was trying to convey were very felt life and  I thought were dead on, at least for me that is.
Now, we have this interesting AFI feature that I strongly recommend.  Knowing that I really liked Parenthood, I wanted to see this DVD to get further information and knowledge on other Ron Howard directed films.  This DVD was a strong help.",984441600,6,1093,4.276699029126213
