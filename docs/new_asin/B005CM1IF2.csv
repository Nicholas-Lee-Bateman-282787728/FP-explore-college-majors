4653648,2,B005CM1IF2,"This movie should be rated R and is not worth watching.  It does not feel like a real movie, more like something staged with no substance.  Jackie is not a likable character from the beginning.  He may be famous but I haven't heard of him and even if I had, it is not a flattering portrait of his abilities.  After ten minutes of watching, I am done.",1429488000,,350,4.17910447761194

4653651,4,B005CM1IF2,"I was really baffled by this DVD at first. I kept expecting the opening jury room scenes to be merely a set-up for Jackie Mason to break out into one of his stand-up routines. I kept waiting for his trademark acerbic observations and laughable comparisons of people of different religions and ethnic groups. It doesnt happen on this video. So be forewarned:
This is more drama than comedy routine.

After being called to jury duty, Mason does some random grumbling and name-calling - none of which is very funny. But I finally realized that the point of this production is to be a take-off on the classic Henry Fonda movie Twelve Angry Men. However, Mason delivers a few surprising twists on the plot of that famous depiction of a jury room deliberation. In Fondas version, the group is led from an ill-considered certitude about the guilt of the suspect, to a realization of his innocence. Here, the perennial maverick Mason flies the other way. He tries to catalyze the jury panel away from their initial off-the-cuff certitude about the suspects innocence  to a unanimous vote of Guilty. But theres more to the plot than that.

You will probably get a few chuckles as the antic Mason orders in all sorts of conveniences for himself in the course of the deliberations, including a vibrating lounge chair. Again though, don't get this DVD if you're looking for laughs. Beneath the goofiness of this parody, the group gets enjoined in some really thoughtful analysis of the evidence against the young Middle Eastern suspect accused of killing a drug enforcement agent. This turns out to be a rather well-constructed crime story.

Whats more, most of the twelve jurors here turn out to have well-limned personalities that youll probably find memorable. Theres a good, ol boy, a cross-dresser, a mobster wannabe, a father of a soldier killed in the Middle East, and a feminist.

Once I finally got over waiting for my expectation of one of Masons standard stand-ups to be fulfilled, I really could look back on the DVD as something different  and something fulfilling in its own right. As far as Masons almost tangential participation in the proceedings go, I end up voting him  not innocent  but agreeably Insolent.",1384992000,2,2214,4.86968085106383

4653653,3,B005CM1IF2,"One angry man is the fictional story of real life comedian Jackie Mason, who as he prepare's for his Broadway show, is summoned for jury duty. After repeated attempts to get excused, Mason is chosen to serve and that's where our story begins. This Funny, satirical look inside the deliberation room will have you laughing, but must importantly, you will connect with at least one of the 12 people in the room. From jews to Italiam mob wannabees,Cross dressers to gossip columnists, there is bound to be appeal for everyone. It's very difficult to stay involved in a film that primarily takes place in one room with nothing but dialogue, but ""One Angry Man"" manages to succeed. I only wish some of the characters had more to say. All in all, I think you will enjoy this laughfest starring one of the greatest comedians of our time...Jackie Mason's ""One Angry Man"" is a winner. Oye Vey!",1336348800,,884,4.673076923076923

8465675,4,B005CM1IF2,"Jackie wants out of jury duty. His lawyer buddy gets him an out, but, when he is rejected for jury duty, Jackie is offended and excoriates the judge in a lengthy speech that lands him...in jury duty. In a comic twist on the old, ""Twelve Angry Men,"" film, we are taken to the jury room where the Jewish Jackie is the one dissenting vote against a young Muslim accused of a terrorist move. Obnoxious as he seems to be, Jackie is left defending himself as well. the characters are great and include: a possible mafioso, a crossdresser who identifies as female (but doesn't seem to have reassignment surgery in his future), the country redneck who thinks he has found his soulmate in her ( he is the one person who hasn't figured out its a man in that dress), a hostile feminist, a patrician snob and a couple of other average citizens to round out the story. It's all hoots and giggles as the jurors try to pressure Jackie into agreeing with the rest of the room so they can go home.
  Why haven't I heard of this movie before? it is a pleasant, engaging comedy full of insights into people and their, views and motives. Well done !",1483833600,,1129,4.3971291866028706
