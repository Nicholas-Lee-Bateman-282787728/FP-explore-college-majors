8252484,2,B0013OXT82,"I lost interest after the first 2 segments. Would have been better as a NON STOP 25 minute prequel, instead you get 7 mini micro episodes (approx. 3 min each, ANNOYING). The 30 second intro was not necessary for all 7 episodes (SLOWS DOWN THE INTEREST). 30 Days of Night Blood Trails should be re-edited so viewers can enjoy what little this prequel has to offer.",1514419200,,363,4.515151515151516
