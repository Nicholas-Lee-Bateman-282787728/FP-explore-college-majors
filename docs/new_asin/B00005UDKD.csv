3497940,1,B00005UDKD,"This is a touching story of deaf-mute Ruth and severely mentally and physically handicapped Remy, and their attempts to learn the game of golf. In all seriousnes, this DVD is awful. First of all, this is an instructional series from 1983! Though it is cool to see persimmon woods and hickory(!) shafts, many of the teaching methods are outdated. The instructor, John Norsworthy's putting stroke is fundamentally unsound, and I cringe at the thought that beginners might attempt to mimic his knock-kneed stance, his wristy stab at the ball, and ball position which is placed too far inside his sightline.
I also can't imagine that an experienced golfer would actually learn something from this video! 45-minutes with a qualified PGA instructor would cover all the bases and then some.
Back to Remy and Ruth, the two hapless beginners. Norsworthy gets so fed up with them, that he throws sand in their face with unabashed glee! He also leaves them on the course by themselves, in order to visit the hotel pub! I guess that part was funny.
I can't recommend this DVD to anybody. The instruction is poor and watching Remy and Ruth gave me a sad-headachy feel. Also, since this was recorded nineteen years ago, the travelogue that is included has limited benefits.
I am very very very suspicious of all the 5 star reviews this DVD has received.  They must not be real, because they are misleading and they resemble bad infomercials.",1014681600,2,1427,4.848360655737705
3497941,2,B00005UDKD,The video was filmed in 1983. I'm not feeling happy to buy a 20 years old instruction at this price.,1018656000,6,100,4.05
3497942,3,B00005UDKD,"it had better golfers playing as John's students.  A quick overview--John takes two young and inexperienced golfers through the basics of the game, and along the way they stop at different sights and courses in France.  John's instruction and demeanor are great--he's fun to watch.  However, his two students are bad--I know they're supposed to be beginners, but their game is weak all around.
That being said, I thought overall the dvd was good and worth getting--I'd love to visit some of the courses in France in person, after seeing them on this dvd.",1015372800,3,554,4.872340425531915
3497943,4,B00005UDKD,"While on a business trip five years ago in Valbonne France, I took two private lessons with Jon Norsworthy.  He was the best golf instructor I have ever been to, no question about it.
When I saw that there was a video with him, I had to get it.  He's as good on film as in person.  The only reason I didn't give the dvd five stars is because the two students he had, Ruth and Ramey, were very bad and gave the impression that this instruction is only for beginners.  Jon's instruction is of benefit to experienced golfers and it would have been nice if one of his students was an accomplished golfer.  Otherwise, this dvd was excellent and I'd recommend it to Norsworthy fans and those who'd like to find out what they're missing by not visiting the South of France.",1015286400,12,766,4.328671328671328
3497944,4,B00005UDKD,"Truly unique training, in this hyper-competitive culture where even kids in Little League seem to have their own agents.  Jon is so laidback in his instruction, you are just kind of absorbing the knowledge.  The footage in Valbonne is beautiful--after a day at the public course, I can only dream of going to some of those courses in France that sit on cliffs at the ocean's edge.
If you like golf, or know someone who does, I would recommend this DVD.  The information is solid.",1015286400,,479,4.6117647058823525
3497945,4,B00005UDKD,"I have taken lessons from John Norsworthy and can attest to his skill, knowledge, and teaching style.  He has been teaching in the French Riviera for years and many a pupil have learned a great deal from him.  I own this program and found it exciting, entertaining, and refreshing...and I feel like I've seen them all!",1015200000,2,318,4.660714285714286
3497946,4,B00005UDKD,"One of the most entertaining golf instructors that I've ever watched.  The video begins with two new beginners to golf and Jon teaches them golf from the ground up.  In between lessons, they visit scenic places all over France.
Not only was the DVD entertaining, but my game actually did improve after incorporating some of its tips....especially on putting.  The natural instinct method seemed to really work for me better than most private lessons--and at a much better price!",1015200000,14,478,5.025316455696203
3497947,4,B00005UDKD,"A delight for new golfers.
I'm a beginning golfer, and I learned alot about golf and the fine courses in the South of France with this DVD.
Jon Norsworthy is a really entertaining host and teacher--his trick shots are great and rival those of the ""Hitman"" series.",1015200000,3,263,4.617021276595745
3497948,4,B00005UDKD,"Great introduction to the game of golf.  Designed for beginners who need to learn good habits from the start.  Jon's teaching method, Natural Instinct, is designed to be intuitive for beginners and have an easier learning curve than other methods that force you into uncomfortable and awkward positions.
In the video, you follow two rank amateurs as they learn the basics of the game.  No matter how inexperienced you are as a golfer, trust me, the two students of Jon's are probably worse golfers than you are!  Jon is great teacher and very entertaining, especially his section on trick shots.",1015200000,4,595,4.92
3497949,3,B00005UDKD,"This DVD is a rehash of old footage, but it is put together very solidly.  I enjoyed the instructor's laid-back approach to learning golf.  He suggests that when to start simply ""grip it and rip it.""  I think that's a lot better than nit-picking every tiny thing I'm doing on the driving range.  Also, it's quick to jump around to different sections, the golf jokes are ... well, golf jokes, and the trivia was interesting.",1015113600,5,423,4.6
8284423,5,B00005UDKD,"This is a very novel approach to teach golf to beginners and even weekend golfers. It doesn't go through the mechanics of the grip, stance, back swing, etc., but at the end of the course, you have learned it all.
I highly recommend it to anyone picking up a golf club for the first time and for those who have played for a while and can't break 100.",1268697600,,349,4.147058823529412
8284424,1,B00005UDKD,"These lessons are dated, out of touch and older than God. The clothes would be great for a retro party or Halloween...Keep looking.",1112832000,5,131,4.739130434782608
8284425,3,B00005UDKD,"It's really not a good investment, because it's and old video, image quality it's not the best and it's not really covering much on the golf instruction. Probably only good for a person who's never played before.",1042502400,5,212,4.756756756756757
8284426,4,B00005UDKD,"I just started playing golf and decided to buy the dvd instead of seeing a pro.  This was an excellent investment.  John's instructions were great and has improved my game considerably.  My drive from the tee now goes extremely straight and over 250m far with an entry-level driver.
He should however lose the male student in his next release.  The female got to grips with the lessons more easily.
A great buy for the novice golfer. Well done John !",1022198400,4,450,4.5875
8284427,4,B00005UDKD,"The instructor in this program is hilarious!  I thought his trick shot sections was pretty cool too.  This program has a high ""cheese"" factor, but I thought it was great.  The golf jokes are especially lame, but what golf jokes aren't?",1021852800,3,235,4.682926829268292
8284428,4,B00005UDKD,"my golf game did improve a bit, mainly from relaxing my stroke and hitting more naturally.  The ""right"" way to swing is all dependent on your physiology and build, and doing what comes naturally to you is the best way to develop a good swing.",1021420800,4,242,4.377777777777778
8284429,4,B00005UDKD,"sure the students are bad golfers--that's why they are the students and not the teacher :)
The instructor was really funny when he was making fun of the students.  He doesn't take himself too seriously and that's exactly the attitude that most amatuer golfers really need.
It was pretty good overall, though an updated version would be 5 star.",1021248000,,343,4.813559322033898
8284430,4,B00005UDKD,"The **** is based on someone who is at my level, one of the worlds worst golf players. As a beginner with only a couple of lessons under my belt, I feel this is a wonderful video for people like me. It makes me realize that somewhere out in the world, there are other people who have the same problems as me. It made me feel a little bit better about my game. The main things this video taught me are:
i) Enjoy the game, it doesn't have to be as serious as everyone makes it.
ii) I don't have to memorize the 1000 golfing tips each month in Golf Digest. Norsworthy stresses that many people make a simple act very complicated.
iii) The basic basics. How to simply hit the ball from the tee, to the green, to the hole. This actually has improved my game, so I have certainly learned some things. For certain, I would beat Remmy and he's had more lessons than me(unless he cheated and drove off the ladies tees again).
iv) Why we don't see many French people on the PGA/European tours :-)
For the better player, unless you enjoy watching 80's golf styles, I think it would be a bit too basic for you. It really should be renamed ""Good Golf is Easy for Beginners"". As other reviewers have stated, costs a bit much for a 20 year old lesson so it looses the 5th star for me (mainly as I was hoping I didn't dress anything like that when I was in the 80's).
Recommended for anyone just starting golf.",1020988800,4,1394,4.205223880597015
8284431,4,B00005UDKD,The elements of good golf play have not changed since the game was created.  Jon Norsworthy's common sense wisdom about what it takes to improve your game will be of great aid to players of all levels.  Ignore how badly his students play--the lessons he teaches to them are applicable to everyone,1020902400,,296,4.673076923076923
8284432,1,B00005UDKD,"Sure, a few shots of France are nice, but this video was not helpfull.  The students in this video have never played, watching them swing was of little use to me.  If you are looking for ways to correct a slice or improve your short game, I am guessing you won't find your answer here.  I regret purchasing this 20 year old video.",1020211200,3,330,4.2063492063492065
