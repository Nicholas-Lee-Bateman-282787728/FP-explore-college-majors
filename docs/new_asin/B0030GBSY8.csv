8385861,3,B0030GBSY8,This movie IS extremely low budget with a story line that is hard to follow. It would be an injustice to single out one actor as being the worst (unless its coming from someone who worked on this film and has a personal vendetta ) when  you can't even see beyond how bad the film is made. Before adhering to any negative reviews on how bad the acting is judge for yourself; NOTE; Marlon Brando would look bad in this!!!!,1300838400,,420,4.25
8385862,1,B0030GBSY8,Another movie I wanted to purchase and at least enjoy it more than not.  Not the case here- there were very few moments in the film that made it shine- Some of the camera angles used were good but the direction in general just really lacked. The opening part of the movie was cool but then it just slowly started to go downhill. It was very repetitive in many parts especially during the torture scenes. The clown outfit was cool but this movie was missing something for me- there needed to be a lot more suspense. The best kill scene is when the girl opens the shower curtain and the clown is right there in her face- it gives you no time to think about it.  This is what the movie needed more of and less random conversations. I love a good clown scare movie but this one didn't do it for me at all. 1.5/5,1273449600,2,807,4.166666666666667
8385863,5,B0030GBSY8,"I liked the twisted story and that Patient X nut woman! It was a good watch and it kept my attention. Very creative film and that girl Rachel was hot. The worst actress was that older woman Susanne Lauren, but her sidekick Rocco George was hilarious! Bllod guts and some frontal nudity! Yikes!",1271116800,3,293,4.547169811320755
8385864,2,B0030GBSY8,"Anyone who watches this movie will fall into one of two categories: people terrified by clowns, and people who aren't. If you aren't afraid of clowns, this horror flick won't do much for you.

I'm giving Geraldine Winters some leeway, as this was her first time directing a movie. Clownstrophobia is about what you would expect for a first-time filmmaker with a shoestring budget. It's campy, the cinematography is sub-par, and the low production value really shows.

The film delivers a good bit of gore and torture, courtesy of a psychopathic clown. There's a tiny bit of nudity, though unfortunately not on the part of milf Suzanne Lauren as hot psychologist Dr. Janelle Wethers. First-time actress Rachel Blair (as Ashley) is unbelievably pretty and sexy, making the movie more watchable.

I'll give credit to Winters for doing her homework; per a commentary I watched, she did a good bit of psychology research to prepare for the film. The premise of the movie isn't really bad, it's just that the presentation is weak. Most of the cast is inexperienced in film, and many scenes plod along much longer than they should.

The story had some potential, it just needed a real budget and an experienced cast. Winters has a great deal to learn about directing and cinematography, but it's not a terrible start (unless you actually worked on the movie like the other reviewer who not surprisingly gave it 5 stars). I'd say watch it once before deciding to buy the DVD.",1270512000,3,1467,4.8326693227091635
