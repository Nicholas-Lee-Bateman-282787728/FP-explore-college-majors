846528,2,6304337124,"What you have here is a pretty typical feel good family picture.  It has all of the necessary elements: A strong willed woman who doesn't need a man to help her; A precocious child that sees right through the adult's barriers; and a cynical scientist that learns an important lesson about love and life.  All of this takes place around a picturesque Scottish village with the usual cast of loveable rouges and just the right splash of ineffectual villain.
Of course there is a Loch Ness monster, and of course the cynical scientist will learn to love and choose not to further his selfish career by revealing the pictures of the monster (really a lovable family of monsters, who, of course, respond to the unselfish innocence and purity of a child's love).
At the end of the day, this is a mediocre children's film, that never rises even a hint beyond the formula that drives it.  If it wasn't set in Scotland and stared Nessie, I would never have seen it.  Still, I suppose there are worst ways to spend a couple of hours.  It just seems like there are so many quality children's films out there, that this one could be missed.  (If you want a children's film with a celtic flair, try ""Darby O'Gill and the Little People."")
Key line of the film (paraphrased): ""You don't look for Nessie with your mind, you look with your HEART.""",982627200,14,1330,4.543933054393306

846666,5,6304337124,"Well, I love this old fashioned solidly made romantic movie.  I enjoy watching it again on occasion because there are a lot of beautifully done cinematic moments -- not groundbreaking, just smart, solid script and convincing acting for such a small budget movie.  It is not ""high concept"", you won't find a mind-blowing new take on the Loch Ness monster.  Rather it is a very nice romanticized tale with likable characters, some broad and stereotyped, but delightful nonetheless.  And a warm-hearted message that a few dissenters saw as ""anti-science"", but as a science person myself, I found perfectly fine.

If you are looking for a spooky, X-Files type of movie, this is the opposite.  It is a warm Disney style movie, more about characters than mystery.

*** This review is about the movie, not the Blu-ray/DVD combo which I don't have yet.  I'm concerned about the playability and the format.

*** Trailer Spoiler Alert - I thought the trailer on this Amazon web page was way too revealing and spoils the fun of letting the story unfold.  Don't watch it.

*** Format question - The trailer seems to use a strange format that looks like a 16:9 format letter-boxed on four sides.  That seems very disappointing if that is what the Blue-ray and DVD uses.  One commenter here mentioned it was a cropped movie, not the original cinematic format.

Update: I notice now that the DVD format is described as ""full screen"".  As far as I know, that is essentially the old squarish 4:3 TV format, meaning the sides have been cropped off and lost.  Even though the trailer has a sort of HDTV 16:9 aspect ratio rectangular look, I think they may have stretched the ""full screen"" picture a little to fool us into thinking it is actually the hi-def aspect ratio.  Stretched pictures just make people look fat and don't add any real extra viewing width to the picture.

Can anyone definitively answer this question about format?  Is the picture actually clear enough to present on a modern large screen TV without fuzziness?

Update2: I see now that these same reviews are attached to different disk formats of this movie.  There is one that is a ""DVD"" and is apparently for Region 1 U.S., U.S. Territories, Canada, and Bermuda)  players described as ""full screen"" which I expect is the old 4:3 TV format.  Then there is a Blu-ray version and one that only plays on Region B/2 (Europe, Greenland, French territories, Middle East, Africa, Australia and New Zealand) supporting players.

So any reviews should mention what version they got to clarify the quality of the picture, that would be appreciated.",1456790400,,2591,4.8099547511312215
846667,3,6304337124,"A low budget movie that went straight to TV screens in 1996 follows the formula of pretty much unknown at the time actors, anchored by a recognisable face from a successful TV show from the past to get viewers to tune in and hopefully later buy/rent the DVDs (and VHS tapes at the time).  In this case they cast Ted Danson from one of the highest rating shows of its era, Cheers, which ended a few years before.  He plays a scientist who is facing unemployment due to his reputation being in tatters after he tried and failed to prove Bigfoot was real.  He is pretty much blackmailed by a university faculty head to fly to Scotland, hire a boat and journey back and forth along the surface of Loch Ness and prove through sonar images that there is nothing dinosaur sized in the water after the former scientist sent to do the job is found dead at the back of a pub.

Dempsey (Ted Danson) doesn't want to be there and acts like it towards the Scottish locals.  He is awoken while sleeping in his car by an angry hot red head for blocking her driveway.  Unfortunately for him she is the owner of the only hotel that is open (well it's not really but a little girl told him a room had been reserved for him there).  That little girl is the daughter of the angry red head. The little has the gift (called something else in this film) that lets her see things that most humans can't.  She of course can see through the angry exterior of the American visitor and thinks her lonely mother should hook up with him and become her new dad.  Dempsey just wants to hire the boat, prove Nessie (or ""The Beastie"" as it is referred to by locals) isn't real and go home to some teaching job at the university that is blackmailing him to be there.

Even though this isn't a Disney movie it sort of is very formulaic and therefore predictable like one. You know the outcome of this movie pretty much as soon as Dempsey arrives in Scotland.  The movie is set in the wrong time (modern day 90's) to really be plausible it should have been set a hundred years before or something.  Dempsey is referred to as the American in a way as if an American (or non local) is a rarity and novelty when in the real world thousands of Americans can be found at town's around the loch every day. The film also implies there's just this little town in the area when of course you've got the massive city of Inverness that Dempsey could just as easily have based himself out of.

Spoilers follow - The film also contradicts itself, at first it doesn't want Dempsey to prove there is no monster as this will affect tourism dollars that the town's economy relies on, hence the blind eye turned to the reckless ramming of his boat out on the loch by two local boats (although in reality I don't see how the police could have been kept out of it, with tens of thousands of dollars of equipment at the bottom of the loch, the university would have been filing a report so they could claim on their insurance at least).  Yet when he can prove there is something there that will bring in tourists and scientists hoping to also encounter it (which is exactly the current real world scenario) this is seen as a bad thing.  The running out after the daughter senses there is a man blocking our driveway, and suddenly throwing herself at him by the hot red head after she had told him to get lost didn't make any sense.  Perhaps if he'd come back and lived in a room in someone's house in the town and eventually had a conversation or two with her over time he might have won her over and this might have happened, but it just seemed cheesy, unrealistic and stupid the way it was.  The violent stalker guy who claimed ownership of the hot red head didn't really add anything to the film, and for a film that you'd imagine is supposed to be a kid aimed one seemed to be something that would turn some parents off.

Fans of Cheers or Ted Danson will probably get more out of this than others, if you come across this for a couple of dollars give it a go but it isn't going to be one of the best films you see this year or probably even this week.",1452816000,,4097,4.271317829457364

846918,5,6304337124,"We live in a society where far too often and too easily and too rapidly trash floats to the surface of our cultural ocean - and the truly special remains too oft submerged.  And because deep sea-diving requires a bravery the majority do not possess, the floating trash is too easily embraced and mistaken for treasure.

LOCH NESS is a small, smallishly known film that was originally intended for the big screen but was for some reason dumped on the small screen - hence, the deplorable fact that the DVD on hand stateside is NOT widescreen, but pan-and-scan.  But...at least this gem is, indeed, available.

Why do I say it is a gem? Because everything is precious in this film from 1996: script, setting, acting, directing, special effects, music, editing, photography.  Ted Danson is flawless as the disillusioned and downtrodden scientist who is sent to Scotland to fade into oblivion - but instead discovers more than he could have ever dreamed for.  Joely Richardson (daughter of Vanessa Redgrave and sister to the late Natasha) is radiantly beautiful as the alluring owner of the magical Moffat Arms where Ted Danson winds up staying as he searches the fabled Loch.  The little nine year old girl who plays the innkeeper's daughter - and who apparently never made another film! - is absolutely adorable and perfect in her performance.  The omnipresent Ian Holm as the Keeper of the Loch turns in a splendid and powerful performance, as he usually does.  Harris Yulan is on hand offering his smarmy best.  The list goes on.  Everyone is pitch perfect and vibrantly real in this fantastic offering.

The music by Trevor Jones is what music in a movie should be.  Most music scores in the last decade at least are comprised of long drawn-out notes, predictable scales, female vocalizations sans words or monotonous percussive rhythms.  As in the films of old, melody reigns in this score.  It is truly a great soundtrack for the movie - and as equally great away from its source.  Much of today's movie music doesn't really stand up too well when divorced from the imagery for which it is intended  - if it even fits the film at all.  Thankfully, LOCH NESS's soundtrack is available on CD.  The movie also ends with the fabulous Rod Stewart song ""Rhythm of My Heart"" - and the final image of the film is absolutely sublime.

Spoiler alert:  the entire film could have been severely compromised by a fake Nessie.  Thankfully, such is not the case here.  The encounter with the Legend of the Loch is breathtaking and the animal(s) are not cutesied  up at all.  It - they - look real.

But apart from the praises above, what truly makes LOCH NESS the fabulous film it is is that it is on the surface about the search for the mythical, mystical
monster - but below the surface of the celluloid waters it is about the larger search for meaning, purpose and above all Love in one's life. Love and the Loch Ness Monster are interchangeable here.  Both are rumored to exist. Both are skeptically said NOT to exist. Both are virtually impossible to find.  Both fill a need vaster than one can possibly imagine. Both are mystical secrets that should not be objectively, scientifically tampered with. And, with this in mind, there are two maxims offered in the course of the movie that apply to both the search for the mysterious monster of the Loch and equally to the search for enlargement of self and soul through Love, and they are ""You can't find it if you don't want to"" and in response to Danson's skeptical ""I have to see it to believe it"" we have the little girl's rejoinder: ""No, you have to believe it to see it.""

So much of the tinseltown trash of our times comes presented in totally unwarranted double disc format, with hours of extras and making of featurettes and alternate endings and outtakes ad nauseam.  LOCH NESS has no such backstory on the DVD, even though it highly deserved such.  However, at least it is available - unlike so many other movies that never see the light of day, but sink below the surface never to be seen again.

The film stars Ted Danson as a burned out U.S. scientist suffering from alcoholism, divorce and professional scandal after fruitless years in search of Bigfoot (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/History-s-Mysteries-Bigfoot-and-Others-Monsters/dp/B001IQDAQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">History's Mysteries: Bigfoot and Others Monsters</a>). Depressed and broke, he's given a chance at redemption. Armed with the latest in technology, in addition to a bottle of whiskey, he arrives in Scotland to disprove the legend. He lodges at a picturesque inn with a nice view of the water and, as luck would have it, owned by a single mom (Joely Richardson) with an adorable daughter (Kirsty Graham). He partners with a youthful guide (James Frain), who also happens to be his biggest fan, ""I've read all ye books!"" Danson, in one of his most appealing performances, samples a wee bit of the local brew in the inn's first-floor pub, where the single mom spends evenings as a no-nonsense bartender brushing off men's advances. On a nightly basis, local eccentrics throw darts, sip pints and eye the stranger with suspicion.

A water bailiff, played by the incomparable Ian Holm, is none too happy at Danson's presence, and attempts to sabotage his efforts while eerily standing at the foot of moldy shoreline castles. Danson tugs along in a boat loaded with scanning computers to expose the empty depths. But what are those caves near the shoreline?

The beauty of ""Loch Ness,"" is not necessarily Danson's search for the mythical beast, but his growing attachment to the small town where he temporarily resides. Multiple times I was reminded of the whimsical classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Local-Hero/dp/6305558205/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Local Hero</a>, another film where an American tourist is charmed by the simplicity of a foggy Scottish locale stubbornly holding back the hands of modern time. The town (filmed in Diabaig Village, North Loch Torridon) closely guards a secret and Danson must decide whether to reveal his discoveries or allow mysteries to remain.

""Loch Ness"" was released straight to American TV in 1996, though it did receive a European theatrical release. It's a shame, as the film deserves an audience. Lovingly directed by John Henderson, the movie displays sturdy production values, beautiful scenery and earnest performances (especially Graham as the daughter, her only film to date). It's a well-intentioned fantasy more about a troubled soul lost in modern society. I love the local color as Danson dines on meat pies, explores castles and strolls the Loch's lonely shores attempting to rediscover his future. Perhaps it's predictable and Holm has a scene almost identically mirroring his famous moment of exuberance in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chariots-of-Fire-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B0006HBLUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chariots of Fire (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;so many years ago. No matter. In ""Loch Ness,"" there's magic to be discovered, and it's not necessarily in the water. A pleasant surprise.",1278547200,,3753,6.142857142857143
846977,5,6304337124,"This movie can be enjoyed as long as you are prepared to accept the plot for what it is - A far fetched romantic tale to well the tears in your eyes and make you think ""A[...] isn't that sweet"" The plot as far as the actual ""Beastie of the Loch"" is far-fetched enough without stretching the bounds or reality with the love story.

Being far-fetched does not, however, mean that this movie is not worth watching. I actually quite enjoyed it, and was able to watch along with a young family without having to cringe at foul language or blatant sex scenes. Take this movie for what it is - family entertainment. The kids will live the monster storyline and the special effects, the romantic among us will sniffle at the course of true love, and the others will probably find this to be a fairly average, fairly entertaining way to spend 90 minutes or so of your time.
Actually, this film is worth seeing, we need films that are a bit far-fetched, sometimes we just need to go see a film that has nothing based in reality and allow things like that to recharge our batteries, I enjoyed it and I really would recommend this film highly.",1268006400,2,1131,4.411483253588517
846978,4,6304337124,"Will Laura (Joely Richardson), owner of the pub beside Loch Ness, get the man, Dr. Dempsey (Ted Danson)? It's expected from the start, when they meet in confrontation.  It's about as predictable as the doctor/scientist getting the facts and a real photo of ""Nessie,"" the monster. But, what will happen if he gets the photo, and wants the girl?  How can he save his career and grab the sassy lass as well?  It's the progress of the relationship between those two as well as other characters that makes this movie worth the viewing.

Laura's little girl, Isabel (Kirsty Graham), red head and blue eyed lassie with an accent and facial expressions that will melt your heart, opens the eyes of adults with her powers of knowing and seeing.  She's almost worth the movie price all by herself.  Watch her closely, what a grande bonny job of playing this wee lass.

I'd rank this up there with ""The Water Horse.""  Both are good films for everyone to see.  A must for Nessie fans and anyone loving views or stories of Scotland.",1231891200,2,1019,4.616666666666666
846979,5,6304337124,"As the title would suggest ""Loch Ness"" explores the possibility of the Loch Ness monster, at least on the surface. Ted Danson plays a disillusioned cryptozoologist who is sent on assignment to Loch Ness, Scotland, to disprove the mythical creature's existence. With the assistance of a clairvoyant girl (Kirsty Graham) he discovers many life-changing things, including love.

If you're remotely interested in cryptozoology ""Loch Ness"" is a must. Despite the fact that the story is predictable, this is a very well-made film. It was filmed in 1994 on location in Scotland and England. Although it was primed for theatrical release and released as such in Europe, in America it was ultimately decided to release it on network TV in September, 1996, which was probably a good decision.

The film has a lot going for it: Ted Danson is perfect as the jaded scientist; Joely Richardson is Beautiful; the little clairvoyant girl is cute and spiritual; the locations are breathtaking; the people are likable and the story touches on important themes that every non-moron can relate to. If you're in the mood for a mindless slasher/monster flick with lots of gore, this isn't the film to see. See ""Loch Ness Terror"" instead. However, if you care to explore some of life's most vital questions, look no further.

Danson has given up on love in the aftermath of a divorce; he's also given up on his life's work, his dream. He's a laughing stock in the scientific community. Note his powerful statement to his Scottish partner at Loch Ness:

""I'm a joke. I'm the guy who chases looney tunes and you think I don't wanna find something out there? If I nailed a dinosaur in Loch Ness I would be vindicated a thousand times over. I would have it all back and more. But it's not gonna happen. There's nothing down there, there's nothing up in British Columbia, there's nothing unexplained flying around the skies at night. That's just a wish list to make us feel like there's something more to life than the $#*% we got stuck with.""

As you can see, the film is more than just cutesy family fare or mindless monster mayhem. The struggle Danson is going through is real and we can all relate to it on some level. We may not be looking for the Loch Ness monster, but we all have dreams; we all hope to discover love in some manner; we all hope to find meaning in life. Unless, of course, we've given up, like Danson's character in the story. Yet, even then, in the blackest pit of anguish & despair there's hope.

There are two general views on life: 1.) That life and the universe are one big meaningless accident and you're just an insignificant bug that will soon be squashed out of existence and memory. And 2.) that there's an intelligent design to the universe and, although it's somehow fallen (i.e. severely messed up), there IS meaning, love, hope and purpose, even if we are presently unable to fully comprehend it.

The film addresses the clash of these two opposing views. We've all experienced the conflict of these two positions within our OWN hearts; it's the clash of flesh and spirit. On the one hand, we WANT to believe the latter position, but life keeps dishing out so much crap that we are seriously tempted to give in to the former.

This is the struggle Danson faces in the story. He's given up; he's stumbling in the darkenss; he's just going through the motions to exist. His smile is mostly a facade.

The little girl is a key factor in his deliverance. She is able to see things as they truly are, including beyond the areas of normal perception. Danson says seeing is believing, but the little girl insists that believing in unseen reality is more important than physically seeing, if you know what I mean.

If this review sounds like a bunch of mumbo jumbo you're not ready for this film. Check out ""Freddy V.S. Jason Part VI"" instead.

It's both a mystery and a love story in one. Ted Danson (Dr. John Dempsey) is a divorced, nearly bankrupt/unemployed teacher. His University boss gives him one last shot at redemption- Loch Ness! Angry at the possible ridicule he may face if he finds nothing (He searched British Columbia for a no show Sasquach) he boards a plane bound for Scotland. His job is to prove there is actually no Nessie. What he finds at the Loch restores his faith in Love, and himself. Co-Stars the beautiful Joely Richardson and the wonderful Ian Holm. The little red haired girl (Kirsty Graham) is a doll too! The gorgeous Scottish Highlands are often shown, and the music is lush and moving. A Great Movie

But beyond the plot, beyond the charming photography of Loch Ness locales, beyond the excellent roles played by everyone in the cast, the thing that made me HAVE to own this movie is the unexpectedly charming accent and mannerisms of the real ""star"" of this movie, ""Isabel Mary McFetridge"" played by Kirsty Graham.  So winsome is this bright red-haired girl of eight years in this film, it is hard to imagine the movie having the same charm with any other child actor.  And the fact that Kirsty was not a professional actress prior to being cast in the film may be why all of her dear mannerisms are unlikely to have been ""directed,"" she is just winsome naturally.

Ted Danson played a somewhat disgraced professor/researcher and ""seeker of unusual phenomena.""  He is the man who COULDN'T find Sasquatch, proof of UFOS or any other of the ""quests"" he pursued.  His reputation is more as a laughing stock at this point, and he only reluctantly agrees to go searching after ""one more folly,"" (the Loch Ness Monster) when he is told he only has to prove it ""ISN'T there.""  He is to take state of the art sonar and imaging equipment, scan the Loch with it, and prove the Loch Ness monster is a complete fable.  He figures it should be easy to prove this type of negative, and heads for Scotland to ""do his job, then get out of Dodge.""

Performances by Ian Holm (Lord of the Rings) as the ""Water Bailiff"" and Joely Richardson (playing mother of Isabel) round out the main roles, but the large blue eyed ""Isabel"" steals the show.

This is a ""must see"" film that leaves you cheering at the end.  You'll want to buy this one because you're going to want to re-savor the sweet gaelic charm of this film many times over.  It's a ""keeper.""",1178928000,3,1828,4.4894259818731115
847016,5,6304337124,"I first saw the movie ""Loch Ness"" when it was on TV and I have to say that it looks so much better on DVD especially without the commercial interruptions in between scenes and the picture is much clearer than when I first saw it on TV in 1996.  The film stars Ted Danson as a down on his luck cryptozoologist who despite several failed attempts to find other mysterious legends in the world and in the mist of a bad marriage with a lawsuit thrown in, he is finally given the one in a million chance to redeem himself professionally by going to Loch Ness at the request of his employer to prove that the legendary monster that haunts the Loch is a ridiculous hoax. After arriving there he discovers that there's more to his plum assignment that first meets the eye, literally.  Throughout his quest to find the mysterious monster that the world has come to know as ""Nessie"" Danson's character John Dempsey comes across wacky and sometimes completely irate locals who appose his study of the lake and his bad bedside manner. However, along the way there is no shortage of adventure for Dr. Dempsey in the form of unexpected clashes with other boats on the loch and the rather violent sinking of his research vessel by a territorial Nessie who miraculously saves him from a near drowning in one harrowing scene in the movie.  But there are a few friendly and charming characters in the film to help keep Dempsey from going off the deep end in his pursuit for answers.  One of the most memorable was the little girl Isabell and her mother played by Joey Richardson who help open John's eyes and his heart in very unique ways to the mysteries of their home and the haunting lake that serves as the family's backyard.  In 1998 my dad and I took a trip to Scotland to tour Loch Ness and what I found interesting when I went there was that only fifteen minutes of the film was actually shot on location at Loch Ness. The rest of the film was shot at another loch nearby called Loch Torridan. The filmmakers thought that Loch Torridan looked more like Loch Ness than Loch Ness does itself. I'm not going to comment on their decision to do so, even though after seeing the real Loch Ness and comparing the scenery in the film, it's easy to see that they were shooting in different locations for the film but that's beside the point. In conclusion, Loch Ness is definitely worth a look you won't be disappointed. The story is good, the scenery in the film is beautiful, the acting behind each of the characters was excellent and the animatronic dinosaurs for the film were the most believable Lake monsters that I've ever seen portrayed in a movie of this genre. If you're lucky the film might just inspire you to go see the real Loch Ness and if you're hoping to snap a photo of Nessie just remember what the little girl says in the film, ""You have to believe in it before you can see it.""

Now I came in about 10 minutes into the movie and had no idea who directed it.  I was pretty surprised I was entertained.  I liked the twist on it, they don't portray Nessie as most movies would, i.e. a giant monster eating everything in sight.

The acting's pretty good along with the direction.  The effects are not bad either.  One thing I deeply Disliked was the ending.  I was in a bad mood which didn't help, but I was kinda hoping for the government and Nessie to go blow to blow.......I know.  I'm a horrid person.  I felt it was a bit of a cop-out, but that doesn't detract everything from this movie.

The film, shot in 1995, was to have been a theatrical release for 1996.  The movie was shot in Panavision (2.35:1 scope).  This merits understanding because the film was never released in domestic theaters--but instead dumped on ABC in an awful pan-and-scan version.  Guess what you all own on DVD at this point?

That's right... a cropped movie!

It would be nice for the distributors to one day release the film in its original widescreen aspect ratio so that we may enjoy the scenery of Loch Torridon and Loch Alsh better.

That's right... most of the film was NOT shot at the real Loch Ness.

What should be shots of Urquhart Castle (Loch Ness) are really of the famed Eilean Donan Castle in Loch Alsh!

The scenes of the loch are quite authentic, although sections of Castle Urquhart may have been recreated for certain scenes.  With the locals swilling down their drams you can almost taste the single malts.
