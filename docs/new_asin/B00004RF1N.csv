7921017,4,B00004RF1N,"I very much enjoy watching this show.  It captures the spirit of the Devil's playoff run and all the obstacle they faced -- it goes back to the 1995 Stanley Cup and the trials and travails from then on.  It is a nice insider view of how different players and members of the team dealt with the challenges along the way.

I was hoping it would have more coverage of Elias and Sykora.  It was surprising that they were just briefly mentioned toward the end of the show.  Also, I would have liked the program to be longer and have more clips from the playoff games.  The total run time is about 50 minutes. I do recommend the product however.",1171324800,2,639,4.283333333333333
7921018,5,B00004RF1N,The 2000 Stanley Cup Champion New Jersey Devils proved to the world that they are a powerhouse in the NHL.  This video shows the Devils historical run to North America's most storied trophy.  All hockey fans(except Rangers  fans) should check this video out to relive the excitement of the NHL  playoffs.  (Ranger fans would not know the what this video is about due to  the fact that they have not seen the playoffs in 3 years! ). Repeat in  2001!  Let's go Devils!,963360000,10,466,4.530120481927711
