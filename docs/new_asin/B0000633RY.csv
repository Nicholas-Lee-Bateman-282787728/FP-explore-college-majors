1687240,4,B0000633RY,"Effects good as can be expected for this type of movie.

Story line of a couple in love and then to have to face the lose of the lover [husband] is always touching.

Concerns for the environment and wildlife fleshes out the story of sorrow and lose.

The oil refinery appears to be the villian here [or rather the people managing it].  The reasons behind the treachary adds mystery to the story and the lose of friendship between Dr. Lia Freeman and her husband's pilot friend adds depth to it.

The oil people hopes Dr. Freeman is nothing but an alarmist and too emotionally involved.

I was expecting an explosion of the plane.

Of course Grifith's bed interest was a bit trite [or silly] but what can you expect from the male intellect.

An how else is anyone going to see what looks like an actual avalanche? [that snow looked good after all this heat].

Not matter what any one says it is good entertainment.  What else do we want? We seem to be spoiled with high-powered Tech.",1122508800,2,982,4.466292134831461
1687241,4,B0000633RY,Some good photography of Alaska and the native wildlife. The acting is 3 stars and the scenery is 5 stars. There are exciting special effects and exciting flying in a two-seater airplane. A large avalanche is very dramatic in the second half of the film. Most of the action in the film in total is in the second half.,1106784000,4,317,4.389830508474576
1687242,5,B0000633RY,"What can one say about a movie that offers such gorgeous vistas of the beautiful Alaskan countryside?  Admit it - those of us who have never experienced such wonder can only stare in awe at the tremendous power of the avalanche.  Add Thomas Ian Griffith's dimples, Caroleen Feeney's birthmark, F. Lee Ermey's continued lack of acting ability; C. Thomas Howell's quick departure, and some adequate special effects, you can't help but be entertained by this cornball thriller.  Some cute animals, and a nice turn by Geoffrey Lower as a villain make ESCAPE FROM ALASKA good escapist fare!",1079308800,2,585,5.010309278350515
1687243,1,B0000633RY,"I agree with the reviewer before me.  I rented this to watch with my kids one afternoon thinking it would be a great wilderness adventure movie.  My kids even kept saying,""Mom, that looks so fake""... they said this many times during the movie.  The scenery was pretty but the acting just so-so.  I wouldn't recommend this although it had very few cuss words and no sex or voilence.  This was a plus since my kids watched it with me.",1053993600,,432,4.417721518987341

7958415,1,B0000633RY,"Okay, I dig disaster films, so I'm used to some of them being low-budget and schlocky. That said, this one reached an all time low. First, Thomas Ian Griffith isn't a really awful actor, but here is absolutely no chemistry between him and Caroleen Feeney. And Feeney is a wooden actress. I thought maybe C. Thomas Howell would rescue this film, but he has about 7 minutes of screen time... so really just a cameo. As others have mentioned, the ""special"" effects are the worst! I've seen better YouTube vids made by graphic designers goofing around. As far as plot, it sort of has something going on, but the meandering drama behind the disaster is dull, dull, dull. I feel as though 90 minutes of my life has been sucked out of me. If I hadn't been doing laundry and somewhat distracted as I paused and came back to this film twice, I would have been depressed.",1377302400,,861,4.490445859872612
7958416,2,B0000633RY,Another Alaska movie not made in Alaska. Just another anti development environmentalist propaganda movie with a little phony romance thrown in.,1376092800,2,143,5.857142857142857
7958417,5,B0000633RY,"I saw this movie on TV, it was under the name Avalanche.  I tried to find it everywhere. One day a stumbled across it at a movie shop in the mall.  I was sooooo happy.  The special effects in this movie are far from today's standards, but the characters I believe are worth it.  I am happy to have it in my collection.",1148601600,7,318,4.0
7958418,3,B0000633RY,"There is a little bit of everythiing in this movie - plot, pretext, suspense, action, mystery, and romance.

There's nothing wrong with this movie..... and of course it's cornballed.  Thomas Ian Griffith is famous for those.",1133740800,,224,5.194444444444445
