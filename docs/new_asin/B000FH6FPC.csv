8122494,5,B000FH6FPC,this is a awesome movie.this third and final chapter of the fly movies is good. even though the fly is not in this movie it's about the madness of the delambre family and a girl who escapes a mental hospital and gets mixed up in their madness. the story is good and the acting is good and the make up effects are good. but i would say it's not the best in the series. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do,1480032000,,423,3.9302325581395348

8122496,4,B000FH6FPC,"Of the three original films that make up the FLY trilogy, 1965's CURSE OF THE FLY is clearly my favorite. I even prefer it to the David Cronenberg/Jeff Goldblum FLY from 1986 and its unfortunate sequel. There are a number of reasons for this. I always found the first two FLY films to be on the silly side and not very believable especially the second one. This version, made in England, retains the essence of the original story but dispenses with the title monster altogether. What we have instead is a focus on the merits/dangers of teleportation and a character study with striking similarities to JANE EYRE. The black & white photography gives the movie the look of an OUTER LIMITS episode which makes it more plausible and effective. Obviously made on a lower budget than its predecessors, CURSE still manages to deliver more shocks than the first two and in a more realistic manner but they are (fortunately) not nearly as graphic as in the Cronenberg film.

Journeyman director Don Sharp, who has made a number of my favorite British B movies (KISS OF THE VAMPIRE, FACE OF FU MANCHU, PSYCHOMANIA) opens the film with a remarkable credits sequence. Filmed in slow motion, it features the heroine Patricia Stanley (Carole Gray) escaping from a Canadian asylum clad only in her underwear and then running down a highway at night. The scene is totally surreal and subtly erotic and immediately grabs our attention. We then follow her on her journey as she meets Martin Delambre (George Baker) who picks her up and, in classic B movie fashion, quickly falls in love with her, marries her, and takes her to his isolated home where trouble awaits. It is here that the Delambre family conduct their experiments in transporting people from one place to another without much success. The failures (which include Martin's first wife) are locked up away from sight. Slowly but surely Patricia realizes that things aren't as they should be and that she needs to get out of there.

Thrown into the mix are Martin's brother Albert (Michael Graham) and their domineering father (Brian Donlevy) who is the driving force behind the experiments. Screenwriter Harry Spalding has created a tense, believable story of experiments gone awry and even manages to inject a little humor into the proceedings (the Asian servants are named Tai and Wan). Donlevy was reportedly in his cups during the filming and occasionally you can hear it in his voice but he gives a solid almost tragic performance. George Baker is very good as Martin who genuinely loves his new wife but has to take injections to keep from aging prematurely. However the movie belongs to Carole Gray who plays her ""woman in peril"" part without reverting to stereotype. The B&W photography is vivid and the film moves along nicely. If you value sci-fi that features ideas over effects, then CURSE OF THE FLY won't disappoint. Unfortunately, the single disc edition from the complete FLY set has been deleted so you either have to get this Region 2 version or buy the set if you want to see it.",1414800000,,3042,4.81453154875717
8122497,5,B000FH6FPC,"I very much enjoyed the sequel ""Curse of the Fly"". I wanted to watch this movie because I have seen the original movie ""The Fly"" and the sequels ""Return of the Fly"" and ""The Fly II"", all of which I liked and enjoyed very much. ""Curse of the Fly"" is a classic black and white movie which is a fine continuation of the original movie with both fine acting and special effects. Being of a scientific mind I find the theory of teleportation most interesting and wonder if it will ever become a reality. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in science fiction movies and the concept of teleportation and disintegration/reintegration of matter. I wish there was a book version of it as I would also like to read too. Does anyone know if there is a book version of this movie?",1324684800,,789,4.448275862068965
8122498,3,B000FH6FPC,"Curse of the Fly opens with a young woman, Patricia Stanley, escaping from the mental hospital in which she has been confined ever since the death of her mother some years before. Dressed only in her underwear, she smashes through the window to her ground-floor cell and disappears into the night in her underwear. She meets up with a passing motorist on the road a while later, who turns out to be Martin Delambre (George Baker) who just to happens to be headed for Montreal, where Patricia is making for. Martin has been sourcing some vital pieces of equipment for his research, while Patricia doesn't really seem to know why she is going to Montreal, but Martin becomes a good enough reason. And when the time comes for him to go back to his lab out in the country, she decides she would like to accompany him there as well. As it turns out, Martin and Patricia get married before leaving Montreal.

Patricia keeps quiet to Martin about her escape from an insane asylum, not knowing she can expect some unpleasant surprises from his private life. Being a Delambre, his ""research"" involves a teleportation machine, something that had not proved good for Andre and Philippe Delambre in the previous two films. And the legacy of their research is that Martin ages prematurely if he does not inject himself periodically, thanks to Philippe Delambre retaining some fly genes in his DNA, even after he had restored back to apparent normality at the end of Return of the Fly, which have passed on to his descendants. As a result, Martin's body ages as rapidly as a fly's, by which standard he should have died in infancy. The drug he takes controls this accelerated aging, but if he misses a dose, the aging catches up to him in minutes. Little wonder Martin keeps this from Patricia.

Martin and Patricia arrive back home at the Delambre mansion in whose basement a lab is secreted. Both Andre and Philippe Delambre took some of the secrets of the teleporter with them to the grave and the device, in its third incarnation, simply does not work properly. It succeeds in teleporting people back and forth from Martin's lab in the Quebec countryside to one in London, where his father Henri (Brian Donlevy) and brother Albert (Michael Graham) are based. The problem is that anything living that enters one teleportation cabinet leaves the other mutated. Henri got away with a skin deformity similar to a huge scar on his last trip, though he insists on keeping this from Martin and insists his trip was a complete success. Previous volunteers were not as lucky, as is later revealed. The equipment Martin picked up in Montreal was meant to sort out this problem.

The day after arriving at the Delambre mansion, Patricia finds herself in the backyard while hiding from Police Inspector Ronet, who is investigating her escape from the asylum. While Henri and Martin attempt to convince the detective that Patricia is a Delambre now, and that the asylum will thus have to go through them in order to re-commit her, Patricia herself stumbles upon a row of locked stables, each of which contains some hideous creature. These are the previous volunteers, the teleporter having left them deformed, semi paralyzed and even apparently brain-damaged. Most of these creatures had once been colleagues of the Delambres, but one, the young woman (Mary Manson), had been Martin Delambre's first wife, Judith. Patricia faints at the sight of them and, when she comes to, her husband and father-in-law try to convince her that her faint was caused the stress of Ronet's surprise visit, and that her encounter with Judith and company was just a nightmare.

Patricia goes on seeing things she shouldn't, especially since the housekeeper lets the deformed Judith out at night to play the piano (she had been a concert pianist), the sound of which attracts Patricia like a moth to a flame and is confronted by the mad jealous/ vengeful first wife, or what she has become. Meanwhile, Ronet checks into the background of Patricia's new family, eventually learning the whole sordid story from the now-retired Inspector Charras (Charles Carson), who had been in charge of investigating the death of Andre Delambre in the original The Fly.

Suspicious that things are closing in, Henri and Martin drug the mutations and send them all through the teleport to London, where Albert Delambre is already becoming increasingly impatient with the sacrifices his father demands of him in the name of the family project. The arrival of a single composite creature, made up from the teleported mutations finally sends him over the edge and he kills it with an axe. When Martin informs Albert that he has sent Henri through the teleport to escape the Canadian police, his brother breaks down. He has wrecked the London teleport and Henri is lost forever. The police close in as Martin succumbs to his family curse and ages to death before a helpless Patricia.

Made five years after Return of the Fly, the film is an unusual second sequel to 1958 original. Or maybe that should be post script, as Curse of the Fly has an entirely different flavour from the first two and stands up very much on its own. This is partly due to the fact that this is a British made sequel to a pair of American films. Though ostensively set in Canada (as the first two were), the English landscape is prominent throughout the film, while George Baker's RADA trained mid Atlantic accent fails to disguise his British credentials.

These quibbles aside, this little known sequel is actually a fine film and arguably the best of the original The Fly movies. One of the reasons it gets overlooked is the fact it does not actually feature a man size, half human, half fly hybrid, just its legacy left in the Delambre's DNA lineage. But then, it was such a creature that is now considered the weakness of the first two films in terms of logic; the question Cronenberg asked when approaching his 1986 remake was ""Where did the extra atoms come from?"" So instead he came up with the idea of the teleported merging the fly's DNA with the human host, and said human slowly mutating afterwards. It is from Curse of the Fly that the gene splicer idea was initially proposed, thus underlying its unaccredited influence.

It is a pity the Curse of the Fly has been largely forgotten, overshadowed by its two Hollywood predecessors. It is a superior film, with better scripting, direction and some haunting photography. The opening sequence, where an asylum window shatters outwards in slow motion and Patricia, dressed only in white underwear, escapes from the oppression of a dark mental institution into that an oppressive, consuming night time landscape; escaping into a dark unknown that offers only more secrets and dangers.

Much credit must to the much underrated director Don Sharp, whose crisp direction lives up to his name. Originally from Australia, Sharp carved quite a healthy career as a jobbing director and sometimes actor. He had previously directed one of Hammer's classier horrors, Kiss of the Vampire in 1962. As second unit director, he choreographed the high flying speedboat chase in the 1971 thriller Puppet on a Chain, which set the standard for speed boat chases in subsequent James Bond films. He also directed an excellent version of The Thirty Nine Steps in 1978, which stuck far more closely to the John Buchan novel the celebrated 1930s Alfred Hitckcock adaptation.

Plot wise, screenwriter Harry Spalding draws on that favourite gothic standard, Jane Eyre, a text that previously provided the archetype for Val Lewton's I Walked With a Zombie. Martin Delambre as Rochester, Judith as Bertha Mason. There is also a flavour of Daphne Du Marier's Rebecca with the Delambre's housekeeper, like Mrs Danvers before her, remaining loyal to her previous mistress and ambivalent to the new one. Thus Curse of the Fly also differs from its predecessors in its gothic undertones, further heightened by sharp black and white photography.

The only puzzling thing about the film is that Harry Spalding's screenplay seems unable to remain within the chronology of its back-story, or rather that of the previous two films. Henri states that three generations of Delambres have devoted their lives to the teleporter project, which would seem to make him the son of Return of the Fly's Philippe. But when Charras (who would have to be over 100 years old if Henri is Philippe's son) tells Ronet the story of his involvement with the Delambres, he seems to merge the events of both earlier movies into a single incident, making Martin and Albert the third generation, and Henri the son of an Andre-Philippe character whose history more closely resembles Philippe's than Andre's. Or maybe Henri is Philippe, having changed his forename since his mis adventure in Return of the Fly. That explanation actually makes the most sense.

Curse of the Fly deserves a lot more than its reputation as a forgotten sequel. It  has stood the test of time far better than its two ascendants, with classier production values and scripting. In fact, this is a ""sequel"" that does not actually need the previous two chapters and would  have arguably benefited by being completely estranged from them. It has cult film written all over it, so grab the DVD and help get it re discovered.",1226016000,4,9306,4.877925363693865
8122499,3,B000FH6FPC,"This British-made sequel to the original Fly movies starts off slowly, but picks up pace. A man and a woman meet on the road to Montreal, fall in love, and are soon married: She neglects to tell him she has just escaped from a mental asylum; he neglects to tell her he is engaged in highly dangerous experiments in teleportation; fun ensues.

There are mutants, fantastic machines and scares here and there, so it's not bad. Director Don Sharp (The Kiss of the Vampire, Face of Fu Manchu, The 39 Steps) can usually be trusted to deliver a good time.",1158192000,4,549,4.49
