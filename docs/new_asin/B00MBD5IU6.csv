8671377,2,B00MBD5IU6,"2.5 stars for this sophmoric tale of 3 schlubs (and a nephew) who were buds in the 80's but now have drifted apart leading miserable lives.  An event triggers a reunion back at a ski lodge where they used to party back in the day.  Alas, the resort has fallen on hard times and isn't the happening place they remember.  The crew indulges in a wild night of drinking in their condo's hot tub and a spilled beverage shorts out the tub controls resulting in time traveling back to the 80's.  Vulgar zaniness ensues.  Call me a tradionalist but to me time traveling conveyances should be something more like H.G. Wells imagined, or at the very least a DeLorean but a hot tub seems to push the limits of belief. I have fond memories of the 80's and picked this up in a bargain bin for $5.00 though not sure why it was ever released in Blu-ray, it's no cinematic masterpiece.

So, I'm no stranger to low brow humor and thought ""Animal House"", ""National Lampoon's Vacation"", and ""Blazing Saddles"" were all quite funny and cleverly written.  They say humor is generational and to me at least contemporary films like this or ""The Hangover"" and it's ilk and other raunchy comedies prove the point.  I just don't get the appeal of these flicks.

It's unclear how John Cusack wound up in this farce lampooning all things 80's when he is something of an icon of the decade playing Lloyd Dobler in ""Say Anything"".  The rest of the cast is largely forgettable.  There are a few chuckle provoking moments but most of it's just profanity and vulgarity with some scatological and homophobic humor thrown in.  It's amazing this mess garnered so many 5-star reviews on Amazon and that it even spawned a sequel in 2015.  Oh well, to each his own and if this your kind of thing then dive on into the tub but if your tastes are a bit more mainstream than ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" is not recommended.",1498089600,,1874,4.492625368731564

8671381,1,B00MBD5IU6,"I am a HUGE John Cusack fan but this is definitely the worst movie of his I have ever seen and probably one of the worst movies I have seen ever. It is not funny at all and just totally disgusting. Threw my copy away- did not want to even yard sale it or donate it to anyone. BAD, BAD MOVIE!",1472860800,,291,3.7868852459016393

8671385,5,B00MBD5IU6,"3 friends from the 80's reunite to have a catch up party back at the Ski resort
where they had their best memories from 1985
during the night they decide to get in the Hot tub to keep partying/getting wasted
while getting wasted one of them accidentally spills an energy drink can on the control panel of the Tub
the control panel starts to short circuit and the Hot tub immediately sends them back to 1985
winterland 1985 the exact Ski lodge where there at but 25years earlier
all 3 of them wake up with a big Hangover and find themselves in 1985
as a viewer watching the film it was an acid trip that's for sure seeing all the 80's Nostalgia
Rob cordroy is extremely funny and so is John cusack of course
Collete wolf who plays Kelly in the film especially in the 80's retro scenes, very funny
Chevy chase has a cameo in the film he plays the role of the Hot tub repair man who fixes the control panel
to get them back to 2010 at the end of the film
Chevy is only onscreen for about 5mins but his prescence is still funny
very funny for sure, the Unrated version is even more funnier
has little more Crude/insulting Humour i guess and lots of F words aswell
the Theatrical version just cuts down the swearing  that's all
apart from that both versions are similar to each other

The sequel Hot tub time machine 2 has been released on blu-ray now
where the plot is pretty much the same except the friends get sent 10 years into the future actually
that's the only Difference
again the sequel has both Theatrical and Unrated versions
so the Distributor thought to reissue the original film on blu-ray again
which has the exact same content as the original 2010 blu-ray release
both versions are included plus usual extras
so the only thing difference is the cover art that's all
so whether you buy the 2010 blu-ray version or this new reissue
has exact same content just different cover art
5 stars for the films for sure, the Unrated version is the best version",1440374400,,1961,4.3994490358126725
