5707456,2,B00C94YYSY,"The acting is lacking. Story line is ok but, too melodramatic. It is time that Bollywood mature into a more believable and compelling storytelling and acting. This particular movie at times was boring. There was moments of overacting and then their were times when you can tell that the characters was acting in a movie.",1400716800,,320,4.836363636363636

5707459,4,B00C94YYSY,"Directed with verve and style by Abhishek Kapoor, ""Kai Po Che!"" is a pleasant surprise of sorts: a big-budget Bollywood movie that significantly tones down many of the elements - i.e., corniness, cutesiness, and an air of self-congratulatory smugness - that often make them such a chore to sit through.

Beautifully shot by Anay Goswamy, the movie chronicles the trials and tribulation, joys and heartbreaks of three young men, best friends from childhood, who fulfill a lifelong dream of opening a sporting goods store and of training young boys in their neighborhood in the art of cricket.

Sushant Singh Rajput, Amit Sadh and Raj Kumar Yadav are tremendously appealing as Ish, Omi and Govind, respectively, and it is their performances that really make us care about the characters' plight. In fact, so deeply are we drawn into the narrative that we barely even notice the touch of melodrama that slips in as we're approaching the finish line. Instead, it's the small but myriad moments of keen observation about the enduring nature of friendship that make ""Kai Po Che"" such a satisfying experience in the end.",1378166400,,1113,5.010810810810811
5707460,5,B00C94YYSY,"one of the best movies of recent times; solid performance / solid story line / no ""filmy"" stuff - absolute marvel",1374969600,,113,4.428571428571429
5707461,5,B00C94YYSY,"Great movie from start to finish. The lead actors acted so well, it's hard to tell they are relative newcomers. A thinking person's movie. Kai Po Che is a phrase used in kite flying competitions, when your kite is cut by another's. An apt metaphor for the movie, which is about three friends' aspirations, and what happens to those in the end.",1374537600,2,343,4.548387096774194
5707462,5,B00C94YYSY,"This was a great Bollywood movie- Awesome. If you are not desi- watch it! Read the subtitles. It is very touching, it is about friendships- cricket- sports, etc. Can't say enough good things about this film! Bollywood rocks!",1373155200,2,224,4.921052631578948
5707463,5,B00C94YYSY,"While Abhishek Kapoor's Rock on was about urban friendships and picking up strewn pieces in fulfilling a lost dream, Kai Po che is rural, youthful in its mood, about creating a future, its a film that greatly reflects the zeal of India's youth. However  ultimately both films are about friendship and the meaning that it gives to life.
Kapoor adapts an book by Chetan Bhagat ( Bhagat seems to be India's Stephen King in terms of most books adapted to films) with amazing results in telling us the story of three friends set in Ahmedabad, Gujarat and the effect of three events - the 2001 test series between India and Austrlai, an earthquake and communal riots that changes their life forever.
There has been a trend in Bollywood about male bondings as evident by the directors sophomoric outing- Rock On, which starred Farhan Akhtar who had earlier directed Dil Chahta Hai, another film about male bonding. Three Idiots, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara are other  recent examples. However all the prior films were urban and had a known cast. Kai Po Che is filled with fresh and young talent as the main leads and their chemistry is mesmerizing and palpable- Govind (Raj Kumar Yadav) the gentleman but shrewd businessman, Ishaan (Sushant Singh Rajput) is headstrong but finds salvation and a purpose in a cricketing prot&eacute;g&eacute;, and wants to give him all the opportunities that he never had.... and Omi (Amit Sadh), the confused but eventually vicious figure with many complications - are friends who dream of opening their cricket coaching academy but only Govind has the head and the financial acumen for it, Omi is navigating a career in fundamental politics with the help of his uncle, and Ishaan is the coach of the sporting academy who finds his protegee in Ali (Digvijay Deshmukh). Their life is at a crossroads of conflicting personalities and career directions but keeping them together is their friendship and love for sports. The fun is watching their chemistry crackle on screen, it feels genuine and lived in without any pretentiousness.

There are other acts in this film mostly through a very cute budding romance between Ishaan's sister Vidya (Amrita Puri) and Govind.
However this is mostly an directorial achievement because every character gets a chance to shine brightly and many scenes deserve the rewind button...Abhishek Kapoor has turned in a finely crafted drama. This is a failed actor- (remember his film -Uff Yeh Mohabbat- I do, it had great songs). Only a failed actor could direct with such amazing clarity and sensitivity. Troubling issues such as the Gujarat earthquake and the Godhra massacre are handled without the slightest hint of preaching however the end does celebrate forgiveness, the futility of violence and hope. While watching the film, if you find dampness on your cheek, remember it is not caused by eyestrain but tears..
The plot is pretty simplistic but the casting makes it amazing- Mukesh Chabria.
The filming is beautiful and accompanied by songs - beautiful songs by Amit Trivedi- put Meethi Boliyan, Shubh Aarambh and Manjha on repeat.

I could go on and on- this is a brilliantly executed and outstanding film...simple and complex at the same time......Five stars. I regret not watching it in the theaters...Go and cry out KAI PO CHE..5/26/2013",1369872000,3,3302,5.0200729927007295

The Bhuj earthquake and the Sabrmati incident creates a perfect backdrop, but the credit goes to the three protagonists - never made me feel I was watching some people put on a show..felt that real and everyday.

5707490,4,B00C94YYSY,"A fresh film adapted from quite a mediocre novel. The film ranks in the pantheon of Bollywood's best coming of age films. The director and his team have done a great job adapting the film and removing 'dead weight' the book contained to make it a 'feel good' movie despite its many tragic moments.

The fresh faced actors must be commended for a job well done. It is a great watch for any aspiring entrepreneur as it provides insight into the importance of enterprise, resourcefulness, relationships, and most importantly how innovative thinking can create a company out of any tiny everyday business. Special praise for Raj Kumar Rao.

The film is not without its flaws , but is a young, fresh, and entertaining film that is a must watch for Bollywood film connoisseurs.",1436400000,,771,4.7894736842105265
