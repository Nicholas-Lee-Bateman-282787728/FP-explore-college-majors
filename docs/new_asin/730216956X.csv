1112412,5,730216956X,"I bought the DVD's of Vol1 & 2 ! The main reason I bought both the Cd's & Dvd's is because I love THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CROSS so much! The words are beautiful! But the way it is sung Makes Me want to hit replay over & over! They have sung some beautiful Gospel songs! Many Many ,Songs We will sing at church will bring the Statler's recording of these songs to My Mind! ALL the songs on these CD's & DVD's are beauitful !

1112416,5,730216956X,"Bill Gaither is host for this wonderful collection of the gospel music of the Statler Brothers Show.  I watched the Statlers faithfully, but somehow, I simply overlooked the gospel segment at the end of each show.  The Statler Brothers Show ran for 7 years and a favorite time for the Statler's was the end of the show, the gospel segment.  They retired from touring in 2002.

Gaither has a sitdown chat with the one of the most popular vocal groups, The Statler Brothers.  Known particularly for their country songs, they started out and continued to sing Gospel music.  The group discusses their time with Johnny Cash, and how Jimmy Fortune became into the group after the death of Lew Dewitt.  Harold shares about his writing books.  They discuss the song ""Amazing Grace"" and the clip you will see is from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Statler-Brothers-Farewell-Concert/dp/B00009AV9H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Statler Brothers: Farewell Concert</a>.  Also discussed is the important message in ""Farther Along.""

One song that is not from the The Statlers Show is taken from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cathedrals-A-Farewell-Celebration/dp/B0047K6PYY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cathedrals A Farewell Celebration</a>, where George Younce emotionally reveals how during his illness, that Harold was willing to give him a kidney.  From that show, they sing ""The Other Side of the Cross"".

These are beloved classics here, like ""Turn Your Radio On""; and ""Jesus Hold My Hand"", ""Life's a Railway to Heaven""  ""Farther Along"" and among others here, are considered in gospel music's all-time greatest songs.

But one of the more beautiful ones and a favorite is ""Eastern Gate.""  Don't miss the second volume to this collection,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gospel-Music-Volume-2/dp/B003EHZJQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gospel Music Volume 2</a>....

1112432,5,730216956X,The Statler Brothers are by far the best quartet ever in American history.  They are good Christian men in every sense of their lives and the comedy is clean and funny.,1437523200,,168,4.419354838709677
1112433,2,730216956X,"The music is fine and excellent, but there is far too much talking and reminiscing.  In the end, it is only worth purchasing if you care about the brothers themselves, not so much about their music.",1428624000,,198,4.5
1112434,5,730216956X,Excellent CD. I Listen to it all the time!! Highly recommended!!!,1419552000,,65,5.0
1112435,5,730216956X,"Their Gospel is Second to Nobody. They feel it, they sing it, you feel it and hear it. For me to watch the music videos is the answer, and if they tell a story about a song they sing, I don't mind at all. It is history told by the artist, not some reporter's spin. They are missed, but they too, deserve to return to a normal family life.

Nothing wrong with the seller or their product. Thank you",1418428800,,397,4.025316455696203

He goes on and on about utter nonsense to make his own theological points.  It is terrible.  If Bill Gaither feels the need to make his theological points he should write his own systematic theology rather than stepping on the music of the Statler Brothers just to make his silly and and nonsensical points.  Bill Gaither must have an enormous ego.",1480032000,,469,4.728395061728395
