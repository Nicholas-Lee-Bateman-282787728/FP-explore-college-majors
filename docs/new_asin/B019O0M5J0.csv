8745577,5,B019O0M5J0,Please do your best Amazon to get this . Great series !! I know so many that miss this show.,1494720000,2,92,3.65
8745578,5,B019O0M5J0,"This (brief) series was brilliant--writing, cast, characters, ambiance. Totally off-center, smart--one might say twisted, in the mode of Deadpool.  Of course the soulless bastards at Fox cancelled it (they will only tolerate the occasional non-mainstream offering). I will never look at Rainn Wilson in the same way again. Because this is the overseas DVD I will have to check with my local (also brilliant) media lab to see if they can convert it. They were able to convert an Australian WWII dvd, so I'm hopeful.",1489104000,3,514,5.047058823529412
8745579,1,B019O0M5J0,"The description online was not clear.  I thought it meant that American dvd players would not work in Sweden.  In reality, American dvd players couldn't play it here.  I loved the TV series Backstrom, and was disappointed that I couldn't play it.  I returned it and am still waiting to be reimbursed minus a restock fee.",1488153600,2,320,4.660714285714286
8745580,5,B019O0M5J0,This is a wonderful - - - but it is the overseas edition and cannot be viewed without a special VCR.  When is it coming out in a USA version?,1469232000,4,141,3.7
8745581,5,B019O0M5J0,"please hurry and get the american verson on DVD so that I can have it for my collection, I love this show because it is different from all other detective shows and I was terribly disappointed when it was cancelled. Please get the American region 1 version Thank You",1466121600,8,266,4.448979591836735
