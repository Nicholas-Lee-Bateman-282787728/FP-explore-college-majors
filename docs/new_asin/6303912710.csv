739434,5,6303912710,"Can someone tell Claudia to make these wonderful 4 tapes - arms, abs, buns, and legs - on DVD.  PLEASE!  My VCR no longer works, and I'm not planning on buying a new one.",1111881600,2,170,3.9705882352941178
739435,5,6303912710,"I use to work in a gym so I am use to working out everday. I have my own work-out room in my home now with a treadmill and other equipment. But I LOVE this video to do before my other work-out. I have just ordered the other three Legs,Abs and Arms. I like a video that has just one person in it and it's not a whole class jumping around. I highly recommend it. Thanks",1054252800,3,367,3.8421052631578947
739436,4,6303912710,"I really like this tape.  About 30 minutes long, the tape starts with a warm-up, proceeds with the work out and finishes with stretches for the muscles that you just exercised.  The main part of the work out cosists of about 5-6 different excersize series.  Each of them is some variation of the old but proven lunges, squats, leg lifts and pelvic tilts.  What is really helpful for me is that while there are not any ""revolutionary"" new exerices, I am forced to do all the repetitions--something that I do not have the discipline to do by looking at a magazine or going to the gym.
My only issue with the tape is that Claudia does not have the controlled movements we are led to believe are safest and most effective.",1015372800,5,718,4.458015267175573
739437,5,6303912710,"I love this series of tapes!  The whole series has helped me to ""reshape"" my body into better form.  I like that it targets certain problem areas.  My only criticism is that the arms tape moves fast but it is still highly enjoyable.  These tapes combined with a cardio workout (jogging, spinning, etc.) one other day a week, helped me to lose 2-3 inches off my waist in two months.  More importantly I feel better, healthier and stronger.  I HIGHLY recommend this series to anyone just starting or continuing their workout. Kathy Kaehler ROCKS!",1013126400,12,544,4.73404255319149
739438,4,6303912710,"I really wanted to write this the day after I got the tape, because thats when my buns started getting sore. But, I held off for 2 weeks to get a real feel for the tape. Claudia's tape really does give a good toning workout for the buttocks area. It deffinatly doesn't do much cardio  wise, unless you are a beginner. The only other bad thing is that my boyfriend claimed "" this tape isn't for girls it's for guys"", refering to the almost corny  voice of Claudia's trainer coming from the back ground as Claudia does hip thrusts in spandex(lol). Overall, this tape does what it claims to do in a pretty quick and slightly painful way. I recommend it as an extra side workout for those already doing consistent cardio and strength workouts.",1006300800,5,739,4.466666666666667
739439,5,6303912710,"I am very happy with this video!!! It was everything that they said it would be. The great thing is that you can do it anywhere at all. I liked it much better than Cindy Crawford's workout because I didn't sweat as much  but still got a great workout in my butt. Cindy's is good is you want to  sweat and work every muscle in your body, but Claudia's video targets the  area I want to work. The exercises are simple and the time just flies by  while I do it. I liked this video so much that I'm going to get her video  for the legs, too.",914371200,21,537,3.935185185185185
739550,5,6303912710,"As an early fan of Claudia's, I purchased all of her workout tapes when they were first released. Now, in 2009, I'm still using them. They are fantastic. I think they're available in Europe/Australia/New Zealand on DVD. Each tape targets a specific area with extremely effective exercises and a worthy amount of repetitions. As Claudia states in each tape's intro, ""It's not about keeping up..."". You can move along at your own pace and gradually build up reps. Be faithful, stick to it, and you will not be disappointed with your results. Kathy Kaehler built a great workout routine that has every bit of relevance today. There is nothing outdated about these tapes...every exercise you see here is still being touted today. These tapes were filmed in St. Bart's and Prague. The scenery is gorgeous...just like Claudia.",1237420800,4,820,4.992700729927007
739551,5,6303912710,"Please, Please put these four Claudia Schiffer Perfectly exercise tapes on DVD.  VCRs are outdated and if one goes out I am 100% certain that no one will buy another one.  I agree with everyone.  PLEASE put these on DVD.  Surely you can do that!",1168387200,3,245,4.377777777777778
739552,5,6303912710,"I thik all 4 of her videos are amazing. The legs video is my favorite, because you see results within two weeks.  I really would love to see them on DVD, they are the only reason I have a VCR still.",1145750400,6,198,3.8292682926829267
739553,5,6303912710,"I love these videos but it's a pain to hook up my VCR so I need them on DVD now. They're so great & effective, please put them on DVD already. I've been doing them for 9 years now and they are the best comprehensive home workout around. Judging by these Amazon reviews, I'm not the only frustrated Perfectly Fit-fan. So please put them on DVD ASAP and I will buy them all over again!!

The workout is good, Claudia isn't annoying, and the scenery is beautiful. The music is good and makes things go faster. The production of these videos rock and Kathy Kahler (sp) is quite the pro. No matter how many workouts I do, and gym classes I go to, I always come back to these.",1145059200,9,670,4.1937984496124034
739554,4,6303912710,"As a Pro Trainer, I always like to see programs for beginners - it is the population that needs the most help.

The exercises are basic with basic variations - & quite convenient, another good factor for beginners who may be time challenged.

Would like to see it in DVD if not yet available.

739555,5,6303912710,"That's exactly what you'll feel when you do this tape! Your butt and legs will burn from these exercises! (In a good way of course)

I have been doing it for 2 months and I still find it extremely challenging. Some sets I cannot even finish.

I love all the videos in this series. It's the best workout you can get in only 30 minutes. The music is great, the scenery is great - you have no excuse to be lazy! Especially when your butt and tighs are nice and toned.",1140652800,,464,4.087912087912088

Actually, I am buying this tape the second time because I loaned it to some one and it never returned! One last word, and the most important one, Please make it avaiable on DVD!",1124668800,5,401,4.647887323943662

7856879,5,6303912710,"f I haven't worked out for a couple months or longer, Claudia Schiffer's Perfectly Fit is great to get back into shape without wrecking your body for the first week. I highly recommend: BUNS, ARMS, & ABS. You will have TONED results. I also LOVE to double run the ABS after 2 weeks! These are a low-impact but, that doesn't mean that they won't give you results. I have limitations on my ankles & minor knee issues. THESE ARE PERFECT for me! I have 2 lb, 3 lb, & 4 lb weights. Start with the 2 pounders, when they become easy- go a poundage up. So you won't be super sore for about 3 days when you first start.",1350777600,,610,4.1344537815126055
