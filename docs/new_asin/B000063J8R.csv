1690382,5,B000063J8R,"""You talk about trying to find your way but to me, you are my way,"" Xena says slowly to Gabrielle, her eyes methodically lifting.
Altogether, the 4th season of Xena was mindblowing and equally daring...a fair half of this season is characterized by Xena (Lucy Lawless) & Gabrielle (Renee O'Connor) venturing outside the familiarity of Greece only to find seething adventures with Indian deities, soul surging battles on foreign & colourful soil, and confronting crushing forks in the fork all while facing multiple tests of their love, their ""way"", and their willingness to sacrifice. As a die hard Xena fan, I absolutely LOVED about half of the episodes. Both characters were at a strong point in their relationship, rough and brazenly heroic, both heartmelting and driven by the sheer power of their commitment and promise to one another and the world. MY FAVORITES INCLUDED:
""A Family Affair""
Xena reunites with Gabrielle and the two face off with the evil Hope and Dahak's grandson, the monstrous Destroyer. ""How's she been?"" asks Xena. ""Without you, just fine...You should know,"" replies Gab's bitter father, ""seducing her away from home with your heroics, filling her head with strange ideas. How's she been? She's changed forever...because of you.""
""A Good Day""
Xena orchestrates an unusual plan for a quick battle between and Caesar's and Pompey's forces in order to save Greece. (You can really see Gabrielle starting to ""change"")
""Locked Up and Tied Down""
Despite Gab's pleadings, Xena surrenders to authorities and is sentenced to life in Shark Island prison for an unspeakable crime she committed in her dark past.
""Crusader""
Xena & Gabrielle are attacked and then befriended by a radiant warrior woman, Najara , who preaches about the light, but later competes with Xena for Gabrielle's heart and soul.
""Paradise Found""
Gabrielle hopes to find inner stillness but Xena is plagued by violent images in a land ruled by a weird man who claims to know the true path to peace.
Note: This season introduces the serene and peace-loving friend, Eli, who tries to set Gabrielle on a path to peace; Gabrielle gets her beautiful blonde hair wacked off and Xena just can't seem to get a moment's peace. I must admit that this season produced a few of the best fighting sequences and storylines I've ever seen. My favorite seasons in order: 6, 3, 2, 4, 1, 5 but a good number of my top ten episodes came from this season.",1025395200,,2421,4.921760391198044

Anyways, she's been wanting the fourth season for a while now, it's her favorite season of Xena. I recently borrowed the first 3 seasons from her to find out she was missing the 4th & 6th season.

She let me borrow this season and I can honestly say it's a great season so I can understand why its her favorite. Definitely something I'd recommend for any fan.",1446854400,,551,4.19811320754717

1690544,2,B000063J8R,"Season 4 has some  good episodes on it. But it seems as if Season 4 starts turning over to a darker side. You see Xena literally transform several times into demonic entities. The battle starts to turn away from physical battles that she fought before against men, gods and some unnatural opponents to a spiritual battle against demons, witches and gods of the underworld. Xena starts to transform into a demon to be able to fight these entities when she always used her skills and smarts to do it before. In some of the shows they talked about embracing the dark side and because it exists that was what made them be able to fight against the evil. I am all for a good action movie. I liked the different places they travel to and I like good stories. But what I don't like is when it is a dramatic change from Seasons 1-3. It is like there was a totally different writer who brought a different world into the mix from Seasons 1-3. I could not finish Season 4. I have one more disc to watch but I could not bare to watch anymore of the season. I also bought Season 5 and from what I saw in Season 4 I didn't even open the package to season 5. If I do watch season 5 it will be curiosity to see if Season 5 topped 4 because 4 was really dark and if season 5 is darker than 4 then wow.",1421193600,,1285,4.099206349206349

This series meets the bill.  When the kids hear the intro music, they come running.  There's a lot of action, some subtle humor and a smattering of out-right-blatant-laugh-out-loud humor.  There's enough loosely tagged history to keep it interesting, with enough fiction to spark the imagination.

So I got the second and the third seasons, watching the characters grow...I love it more now than when I watched it years ago! I like mythylogical themes, nevertheless Xena had it all, good stories, acting, cinemetography, campy comedy and it all blended in and worked wonderfully with characters that had chemistry.  ""Compared"" to much of the junk that's on now and weirdness I might add, Xena is a masterpiece. However, like many shows, without going into detail, they tend to take a turn, usually for the worst. Weirdness and silliness begins to evolove in season 4 and stories arise that aren't excecuted well, they lack substance, the personalities within the characters shift a bit and it affects their acting abilities, the familiar characters that worked harmoniously with each other aren't there and are beginning to fade out of the show and so forth. I'm not done watching season 4 yet but if this nonsense continues unfortunately season 5 and 6 will be out. I'll just have to enjoy the previous seasons which is what I thought was great and withstands the test of time.",1377993600,,1217,4.822966507177034

I had to buy this box twice, because the first time I bought, 7 DVDs out of 9 were defective.
Since I had already watched so many times the episodes here in Brazil, I had no hurry to watch the DVDs. When I realized the discs were bad, more than one year had passed and the seller wouldn't replace them.
I bought another box and this time all discs but one came OK. Episode ""If The Shoe Fits..."", on disc four, can not be played the normal way. I have to hit the title menu on my remote and enter chapter 5, this way the episode plays. If I try the normal way and press ""Play The Episode"", it goes directly to interview and never plays the episode.

And disc 9 says ""Exclusive 30 Minute Interview"". Ok, Where??? It's not include in this disc nor any other.

I give 10 stars for the show!
And I give 2 stars for the DVD Box.
And I end up with 3 stars.

1690745,5,B000063J8R,"`Xena: Warrior Princess' takes yet another surprising turn in season four as our favorite, feminine anti-hero and sidekick take their battle against the forces of aggression and evil in the world to a whole other level. The season begins with a two part blockbuster; `Adventures in the Sin Trade' I and II, in which Xena fights against a powerful shamaness in the spirit realm via out-of-body travel in an attempt to open the pathway to Paradise for a departed tribe of Amazon women trapped in a desolate limbo state.

This impressive beginning marked a season of spiritual unfolding and metaphysical adventures that I found truly delightful and captivating. Who could ever get enough of an action/adventure series filled with shamans, avatars and demons. Don't be surprised to discover that the classical Gods and Goddesses of Greece are not the only immortals out their in the cosmos. As Hades, God of the Underworld states in episode one, ""Not all the world's dead come to me"".  Yes there are many heavens and hells in the Xenaverse!

Well I guess spiritual warfare is just my thing, season four of `Xena: Warrior Princess' is definitely my pick for `Best of the Best'! My rating: -5 Stars-.",1227484800,2,1194,4.900990099009901

1690747,1,B000063J8R,"To the makers of ""Xena"" - what were you thinking when you made this season? After seeing Seasons one and two of ""Xena"", I considered this show to be one of my favourites of all time, if not my very favourite. Season three was still excellent, although I thought the writers mishandled the whole storyline involving Hope. However, in Season four, the writers manage to make pretty much every mistake imaginable and the series jumps the shark.

The main theme of season four of ""Xena"" is Gabrielle's spiritual journey. Following her experiences with her evil daughter, Hope, Gabrielle feels drawn to the path of peace, which ultimately leads her and Xena to India in search of some sort of spiritual guidance (which appears in the form of Eli, ""Xena""'s answer to Jesus), and results in Gabrielle laying down her fighting stick and becoming a full-blown pacifist. Now, I think peace is a great thing. I would love it if everyone in the world chose to stop fighting and be friends. However, when I watch an action movie or TV series, I want to see people being kicked in the head. I don't want to watch people sitting around doing yoga and wishing that they can heal people. Another mistake that was made in Season four of ""Xena"" is that many of the supporting characters, who made the earlier seasons of ""Xena"" so much fun, barely appear. I am still trying to figure out why Ares (Kevin Smith), one of the best things about ""Xena"", only appears in one episode, while Minya, possible the most annoying character ever, appears twice.

Ironically, Season four of ""Xena"" was made and screened concurrently with Season five of ""Hercules"". Previously, ""Hercules"" had been the weaker of the two series, and yet, Season five of ""Hercules"" has the best running storyline and best episode of both of these series combined.",1206144000,,1809,4.75796178343949
1690748,5,B000063J8R,"This series had everything in it: Comedy, drama, inspiration, musicals, etc... I also believe this was a series that helped create certain television shows and movies. Watch (Here She Comes... Miss Amphipolis 1997) and tell me that's not similar to (Miss. Congeniality 2000). Remember that Xena was being played in a different time period (Historical Times) and Miss. Congeniality is being played in the present, yet they are still similar. The show not only had a few good laughs with the help of Joxer (Ted Rami)but also allows viewer the feeling of Catharsis. Seeing Xena battle her past demons and realizing she wouldn't be the hero she is without her past is PRICELESS. Also watching the growth of  Xena (Lucy Lawless) and Gabrielle's (Renee O Conner) friendship is something very special. They become family and travel to the exotic lands of Asia and to the beautiful landscape of Egypt etc...

The DVDS are worth it I own all 6 seasons and the commentaries are GREAT. I especially love watching Hudson Leick's (Callisto)commentary she's intelligent, funny, and beautiful.

P.S. My one note would be buy the director's cut of The Final Episode (A Friend In Need) because it's much better. Plus you get great extras including commentary by Lucy, Renee, and Rob and you also get behind the scene footage including a little B-Day cake for Lucy. The commentary is great I just finished watching it again for my 100th time because I find Lucy and Renee hysterical.

I will always have faith that a Xena Movie will be made, although Gabrielle lost faith in her Hope; I will always have faith that Xena will eventually become a movie; plus I'm only 19 so I still have plenty of years left to wait lol.

Well Thank you Lucy, Renee, Rob, Hudson, Ted, Bruce, Kevin and all the other people that made Xena possible. You filled many homes with joy, laughter, and inspiration; it truly is one of televisions greatest moments!",1200787200,2,1918,4.817629179331307
1690749,4,B000063J8R,"Although the production values for XENA went up in Season Four -- with consistently more complex camera angles and better and more interesting sets and effects -- and despite the fact that the season ended and began on high notes, as a whole Season Four was something of a disappointment compared with Season Three.  That season had a number of excellent dramatic episodes, but even more a large number of superb comic episodes.  But while Season Four had some good comic episodes, they were fewer and farther between than in Season Three.

Part of the problem in Season Four was a story arc that took Xena and Gabrielle to India.  Though there was a lot of potential there, the actual episodes in India were rather disappointing.  The most important thing was clearly meeting Eli, who would play an ongoing role through the rest of Season Four and into Season Five.  Another problem for me personally in the season was the loss of Callisto (for the most part) as Xena's main antagonist and her replacement by Alti, who I never came to like.

The beginning of Season Four, however, was extraordinary, as Xena makes a journey to the Amazon equivalent of the afterlife in search of Gabrielle, who she believes had died in the closing moments of Season Three.  She is given a series of visions while there of her time with Gabrielle, including one where Gabrielle, while being crucified by the Romans, looks up at her and tells her that she loves her.  This was clearly not a memory, so Xena concludes that Gabrielle is in fact still alive.  While this is good news, the rest of the season is clouded by the fact that Xena fears that the two of them eventually face crucifixion.  While most of the rest of Season Four is somewhat flat, it ends spectacularly with the culmination of the Caesar story.  ""The Ides of March"" easily goes down as one of the five best episodes of XENA, if not the best.  But I must qualify.  It, unfortunately, was not the final episode of the season.  The last was one of the worst episodes of the series, ""Deja Vu All Over Again.""  In it we see Lucy Lawless waking up in a modern bed with Ted Raimi (Joxer).  She is convinced she is Xena and that she must be the Xena vigilante who is going about town solving crime.  Convinced that she was Xena in a previous life she and her boyfriend go to a past lives counselor (Renee O'Connor) who hypnotizes her.  Eventually, Lawless realizes that she was not Xena, but Joxer while Raimi realizes that he was Xena.  O'Connor turns out to be Gabrielle.  Despite some good occasional comic moments (such as Lucy Lawless leaving the office singing her own version of the Joxer song) it was a terrible end to the season.

The good news is that Season Five would be a big improvement.",1186185600,5,2745,4.547861507128309
1690750,3,B000063J8R,"I am definitely in the minority on this review and only one or two other people here might agree with me.  I thought the first 2 seasons were excellent and wonderful.  I thought the third season was polarized between good and not good.  I thought I would give the series one more chance with season 4, hoping 3 was a fluke.  I was so wrong.  Season 4 took what I didn't like about the third and made it even worse.  I will say that the 3rd and 4th seasons did have some of the most memorable and enjoyable comedies, but the other stuff disappointed me.  Most of what you liked about the first 2 seasons was trashed by now.  The series should have stayed realistic like the first 2 seasons, instead of embracing total weirdness like this one.  I thought ""Adventures in the Sin Trade"" was one of the most unwatchable things I have encountered on TV.  Some of the later parts of the season were probably even weirder, but I only watched select episodes after that.  I certainly did not even waste money on the 5th or 6th seasons.  Most might think I missed the point of the series.  Indeed I did, for my favorites were others least favorites, and my least favorites were others favorites.  I recommend that somebody buy this cheap and used on ebay.  About half the shows were good, but this certainly isn't worth more than $20.  Ok, feel free to bash my review now, all y'all want.  I just hope I could warn somebody out there that the series took a major turn away from what was good about the first 2 seasons.",1184025600,3,1508,4.347670250896058

1690765,4,B000063J8R,"The truly remarkable thing about Xena the Warrior Princess over its six-year run is not that it was one of the first series to show women as fighters who could hold their own. (Xena never needed a guy to step in and save her.) No, the really interesting thing about this series is that it was carried by two women characters... whose strengths and flaws, insecurities, doubts and struggles were central to the whole six-year epic story arc. With each season, the series grew a bit more complex.  Season 3 was brilliant for its darkness, the ""rift"" of jealousy and betrayal in the partnership between Xena and Gabrielle.  The end of Season 3, episodes Sacrifice 1 and 2 were an amazing testament to how much these two characters mean to each other.  Season 4 carries this arc even further, with the first two episodes dedicated to Xena's search for Gabrielle, much more backstory about Xena's mean and murderous past (and the nasty friends she kept), and then deepening as Gabrielle tries to reconcile living life with a warrior while trying to find her own way as a non-violent person.  This season is brilliant in the way it reveals so many shades of gray, so many conflicted feelings. Is violence always bad?  What does self-sacrifice accomplish?  How much do we owe to free will and how much to fate?  And how much is just trusting your gut to do the right thing--no matter what that is--when the time comes. There are some of the series' best episodes here:  Between the Lines, which shows Xena and Gabrielle fighting injustices through a future lifetime in which Xena is the Mother of Peace and Gabrielle a warrior prince, reveals the relationship between the two characters as something much bigger and more profound than they (or we) ever previously thought.  End Game and Ides of March are just plain amazing. This season demonstrated what XWP the entire series was really about: The way of love (or friendship).  Some of the themes and episodes in this season are the foundation of many references and excellent episodes in subsequent seasons.  There are more episodes in later seasons that explore Xena and Gabrielle's future lives. Others that touch on the notions that these characters were destined to be together no matter what.  Others that explore the shades of gray between peace and violence in even finer detail.  On a more critical note, in this season, as in all of the others, there are a handful of great episodes, some okay episodes and a few clunkers.  A Tale of Two Muses (or XWP's version of ""Footloose"") is just plain dumb, and Daughter of Pomira is flat and uninteresting (harking back to the ""dispatching-the-baddies-of-the-week"" formula of Seasons 1 and 2. By Season 4, we're all hanging on this series for its development of the main characters, for the sly and campy humor, etc. We're way past being interested in the old schtick. But this is a minor criticism, really, of a TV series that during its time took so many risks, managed to mixed light and dark, slapstick and melodrama, as it tried so many weird and wonderful things. It can be forgiven if not every episode is a perfect 10. This show in its entirety is still some of the best television I've ever watched. I've cared more about these characters than any others. That's perhaps the biggest accomplishment of the show, its producers, writers and actors. And a remarkable accomplishment given that many people might easily never watch Xena Warrior Princess--assuming it to be nothing more than a silly, campy costume comedy.  Sure, it was that. But it was so much more, too.",1159574400,8,3569,4.780487804878049
1690766,5,B000063J8R,"This season was so damn good! Action, sometimes bloody and laghter at the same time. This is one of the best shows around! I especailly enjoyed the India trilogy. Episode The Way was shocking!",1135555200,,192,4.676470588235294
1690767,5,B000063J8R,"At the end of Season Three, Gabrielle had jumped into an abyss to kill her evil child, Hope.  Season Four opens with Xena undertaking a spiritual journey to recover her friend.  I don't want to spoil anything major, so I'll just mention that the pair travels to India in search of Gabrielle's Way (path through life) and in the process Xena discovers her own Way.  They bump into Pompey, Caesar, and Brutus repeatedly, and are instrumental in setting up the famous Ides of March incident at the Roman Forum.  This sets up a big dramatic ending for the season, and there's a modern episode (about past life regression) in the final episode.

Season Four has important consequences for the Amazons, shows how Xena played a pivotal role in Roman history, dabbles in FOUR different spiritual paths (shamanism, crusaders, the Way of Love, and the Way of the Warrior), travels to a new part of the Hercules/Xena world, and kills off some major characters.  Plus Joxer turns out to be less lame than expected.  There's a LOT going on this season.

The DVD collection of Season Four of ""Xena: Warrior Princess"" contains even more extras than the oodles included with Season Three.  The collection includes nine DVDs and one CD-ROM; that's one more disc than for Season Three.  There are the usual ""interviews"" (episode commentaries) featuring many of the usual suspects (Lucy Lawless, Renee O'Connor, Robert Tapert, Steven L. Sears, Eric Gruendemann, Ted Raimi, Bruce Campbell).  The two sets used for the commentaries are the same as for Season Three.  There's the expected blooper collection, with heavy use of *BLEEP* to cover the naughty words.  There's a fairly long Ted & Bruce bit, where Bruce's first book (""If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor"") is pitched repeatedly.  There's a modestly scholarly take on Siberian shamanism as relating to the ""northeastern Amazons"" of X:WP, a commentary by the martial arts teacher about how he trained the actors (particularly Lucy, Kevin Sorbo, and Hudson Leick) to fight, and a visit to the firm that made the ""suits"" and mechanical rigs for the monsters in the series.  The ""extra"" DVD is filled with alternate, longer cuts of scenes that didn't make it into the finished episodes.  The CD-ROM is just as lame as in all the previous seasons, but who cares?  The truly lavish quantity of extras on the DVDs make that inconsequential.  One downside: the packaging uses an inconvenient overlapping disc arrangement, so you have to remove the preceding odd-numbered disc to get at each even-numbered disc.

Guest appearances for Season Four include:

o Marton Csokas as Borias, warlord and Xena's former lover

o Victoria Pratt as Cyane, Amazon Queen

o Sheeri Rappaport as Otere, Amazon warrior

o Claire Stansfield as Alti, shamaness

o Karl Urban as Julius Caesar, Roman Triumvir

o Jeremy Callaghan as Pompey, Roman Triumvir

o Shiri Appleby as Tara, wannabe sidekick

o Bruce Campbell as Autolycus, King of Thieves

o Timothy Omundson as Eli, prophet and healer

o Kathryn Morris as Najara, crusading zealot

o Alexandra Tydings as Aphrodite, Goddess of Love

o Meighan Desmond as Discord, Goddess of Retribution

o Danielle Cormack as Ephiny, Amazon Queen

o Jennifer Sky as Amarice, Amazon warrior

o Hudson Leick as Callisto, Xena's arch-nemesis

o David Franklin as Brutus, Roman centurion

o Robert Trebor as Marco (no, not Salmoneus)

o Kevin Smith as Ares, God of War

Bottom line: FIVE STARS.  Buy this collection; you'll be glad you did.",1113782400,20,3503,4.974137931034483
1690768,1,B000063J8R,"Season 4 is filled with great episodes for any Xena fan. Ides of March is one of my favorite episodes - the weaving of the Xena and Julius Caesar stories is so well done. That's what makes this boxed set so disappointing.  The DVD are made cheaply and of poor quality.  (I'm writing this review regarding the 3 seasons that I bought: 2, 3, 4)  1st the color landscape of the menus is so horrible that you can't see what you have selected.  The basic DVD layout of menus looks thrown together. The dvds are obviously made on the cheap. The disks stick, skip, and revert to the wrong menu and I had to ship bak 5 bad disks so far (at my expense)for replacement by Anchor Bay. Some don't play very well but the skips are minimal and I don't feel like paying the postage, so I've kept them. The extras in seasons 3&4 are more substantial - more interviews, commentaries, extra shorts etc.  I tend to be a big fan of audio commentary and listening to Lucy, Renee, and Rob reminisce is nice. The Bruce Campbell/Ted Raimi Cabin Fever in Season 3 is quite funny.  I love Xena and wish that another company had taken on the project.  So disappointing.

1690769,5,B000063J8R,"Having discovered the beauty of a multi-region DVD player I have started to buy these USA Xena DVDs. The UK DVDs have been out much longer but don't have any extras.....boy was I in for a treat with this particular set.

The episodes speak for themselves and most fans will be well acquainted with them so I need not say anymore here. Season 4 had some of my favourite episodes and some of the most powerful and thought provoking episodes too. It IS nice to have them in full and arranged nicely on the discs in the set.

The extras are incredible. Interviews with cast and crew and a couple of fascinating featurettes. There are some great audio commentaries on the episodes and a couple of fun video commentaries from Lucy Lawless and Renee O'Connor, as they sit and watch the episode.

I have seen similar types of extras provided by the Official Xena Fan Club....but having seen these extras and the quality of the interviews, it makes that particular ""other"" company look amateur and cheesy. On top of that this box set provides incredible value for money, including some beautiful insights into one of mine and other fans favourite episodes, ""Ides Of March"". From what I have seen the ""other"" company does NOT provide value for money when you compare the quality and design of this product.

However, there are 2 things I didn't like about this season set. First, it doesn't have as many extras as season 3 set, and second, once again, nobody has thought about non English speakers, who live in Latin America and Spain. I'm from Chile, and my English is not the best, but at least I can understand most of the episodes, but I'm sad for all my friends that simply don't speak or understand the English language. No matter how much they want to buy the DVD episodes, they won't, 'cause they just won't understand them.

I read the reviews about season 5, and I saw no subtitles are included once again, and I guess it will be the same for season 6. I wish someone could make something about the Spanish, French, Portuguese, fans around the world.",1092873600,10,1015,4.571428571428571

1690805,5,B000063J8R,"I believe this is one of the best seasons of Xena. I'm not going to go into detail about every episode, but here is my rundown: Throughout the series our favorite Bard and Xena convey opposite people with opposite pasts, whose lives are entertwined because of a common love: friendship.
In this season, Xena is haunted by dreams of Gabby and her demise atop an icy mountain; they are cruicified. Xena grapples with the decision to leave her friend and not lead her to her death, or face destiny together. In this season, Gabby grows as a person spiritually in India, leaving her warrior path and gaining one of purity and love. In the end our Bard has to make a decision: is her path, her soul, worth the friendship with Xena. (Watch it!)
At times I must say some episodes around India got farfetched, but they were needed. This season is an opener for the next seasons and shows how above all, true friendship leads people to change who they think they are into what their souls convey. This season is a markee for character growth for both Xena and Gabby and is totally worth the money. (Saved up for a month!)
--EXTRA FEATURES--
1. Bloopers could have been more and better organized.
2. Interviews...ok, but much more from the actors would have been better.
  The season speaks for itself as one of the most engrosing seasons that proclaim and solidify the series as thrilling; and unpredictable. Enjoy.",1089158400,3,1406,4.642570281124498
1690806,5,B000063J8R,"I have to say out of the 6 seasons, the 4th season is the one I missed a lot of the episodes.  So when the day finally came to get I was so excited. I have to say this season is really good. The acting is very good(maybe even better),the fighting are a lot more intense, and the villains are even more evil. I loved Alti, she is a very great character, complete dark and the actress who plays her has a lot of talent. Just like last season, it had a theme, which was friendship and betrayal. This season's theme was paths in life, Gabrielle and Xena both had to find out there paths in life.  But we know that there paths end in disaster by the end of the season. My favorite episodes were:
Adventures In The Sin Trade(pt. 1&2)-The best season premiere, Xena must find Gabrielle in the Amazon Land of Dead, battle Alti, and free the dead amazons to go to eternal bliss. Here we get the first glimpse of the season finale.
A Family Affair-great episode!!!, Xena finds Gabrielle, but finds out it's really Hope. But then Xena finds the real Gabrielle(a very touching reunion) and both must stop Hope and her son, the grandson of Dahark, The Destroyer.
A Good Day-A great battle episode, with Xena, Pompey, and Caesar in a head to head fight. Poor Gabrielle, if only she could have saved him.
Crusader-Najara!!! that girl has some issues, good thing Xena and Gabrielle brought her to jail.
Locked Up and Tied Down-A dark and classic episode, Xena goes to jail, finally, but it's the only crime that she didn't that she is going for. Also, some good fight scenes.
Past Imperfect-I love the story of Xena/Borais, how he really loved Xena and she never could love him back.
Daughter of Pomira-This episode may be weaker compared to ""The Price"" in Season 2.  But I loved the story of Vanessa/Pili  and the fight scene between Xena and that guy who hated the Horde, what his name?
Paradise Found-From Xena's dark side coming out to her monster transformation. This was a very creepy episode.
Devi-Gabrielle is honored as a Devi, a healing deity, and is possessed by the evil spirit, Takarta. Here we meet the Jesus-like, Eli for the first time.
Between The Lines-One of My All Time favorites!!! This is just perfect. Xena and Gabrielle travel into their future reincarnated souls to battle the evil soul of Atli.
The Way-Controversial but symbolic, a masterpiece of an episode.  Xena finds help in the god, Krishna to save Eli and Gabrielle from Indrajit, The King of Demons.
Endgame-Amazing episode!!! Great acting, great fight sequences, and we say goodbye to the beloved Amazon, Epiphany and the beheaded Pompey. Loved how I just said that.
The Ides of March-Incredibly touching and powerful!!! Xena has tried to stop the vision that has been haunting her and Gabrielle for the whole season but fails.  Callisto returns and Caesar is killed by his own men. One of the best episodes of the series.
Season 4 has a great set, with the discs designed and placed in better than the last three sets and the main menus are also great as well. Season 4 had its weak episodes though, ""The Key To The Kingdom"", ""A Tale of Two Muses"", and ""The Play's The Thing"". But the strong episodes out way them all. Season 4 may be great, but it Season 2  will have most of my favorite episodes and Season 3 had an amazing story arc.",1087603200,4,3306,4.546218487394958
1690807,5,B000063J8R,"This is probably the best season of Xena: Warrior Princess. Finally free of its parent show Hercules : The Legendary Journeys, the show is allowed to branch out into some interesting new directions and take on a bit of a different spin. This season shows pretty much the last of the crossovers between characters from Hercules into Xena and establishes the main cast of characters that will be definitive to the show.
The first three episodes deal with Xena searching for her dead sidekick Gabrielle by travelling to the Amazon Land of the dead where she battles the shamoness Alti and frees the spirits of the dead Amazons of her wicked past. Eventually she recovers Gabrielle but, she has been changed by the loss and the quest. We begin to see the relationship between the two characters begin to take on a new level that will eventually cause arguments for years to come.
I don't like to write spoilers so from an overview perspective highlights of the season include a hillarious send up of ""Footloose"" dubbed ""A Tale of Two Muses"" and a reoccurring band of characters from Roman Times that we all know from reading Shakespeare's ""Julius Ceasar."" There are also several appearances by the ""King of B Movies,"" Bruce Campbell as Autolycus, King of Thieves, which are always welcome to me in any series. The show stopper is, appropriately, the season finale ""De ja vu, All over again,"" which is so funny I have to wonder if the great Yogi Bera had something to do with the script other than lending the title!
The stocking stuffers on this set are incredible. I have yet to see this much bonus content on another series. The packaging is a new and compact design that is unique from what I have seen out there. Apart from the eight discs with episodes and commentary there are two ""bonus discs"" just for special features which I haven't seen outside of ""The Lord of The Rings"" releases.

Along with the three seasons before the release of Season 4, I have antipated them all as if they were being released for the very first time, never before seen.  Season 4 is probably one of my more favorite seasons.  They traveled further out of Greece and not only did the characters grow themselves but we, the viewers grew with them.  New characters were introduced, old ones returned for yet a fourth time, and we meet more gods, goddesses and god wannabe's.  Also finally Gabrielles clothes take on a more seasoned/mature look to reflect her hardships and growth in herself and in her life.

001. Adventures in Sin Trade:
This was a good episode. We get to see more from Xena's evil past, which is always great! (LOL!) I loved the range of emotions we get to see in this episode. I don't think I've ever seen Xena so sad... Broke my heart..I didn't like the Anokin  story though. In my opinion it belittled Xena and Gabrielle's relationship.. And since when does Evil Xena care about anyone but herself?
002. Adventures in Sin Trade II:
Not as good as the first one, I got more of a ""bad trip""feeling,like I was watching the Xena version of ""Requiem for a dream""...
003. A Family Affair:
Fantastic episode!! Very emotional and well done. Renee does a great job playing both Hope and Gabrielle. I'm glad we (finally) get to see Xena interact with Gabrielle's parents... I always wondered about that...
004. In Sickness and in Hell:
This is actually the very first episode I've ever seen of the show.(Now I've seen them all). It may not be the best episode made, but I found it quite funny and loved the Xena and Gabrielle dynamic in this episode.
005. A Good Day:
To this day this, this episode always moves me. Love Xena's intensity in battle. Great strategy episode.
006. A Tale of Two Muses:
Liked this one much better than ""Forgiven""(season 3, also featuring Tara). Good Xena and Gabrielle interaction and I totally LOVED Auto!!(King of thieves)
007. Locked Up & Tied Down:
 Xena tries to atone by going to jail... Solid episode, great performances by our leading ladies.
008. Crusader:
Ouch... I REALLY don't like Najara.
009. Past Imperfect:
Gotta love EvilXena!! I truly enjoyed this episode, the Xena/Borias dynamic was great!
010. The Key to the Kingdom:
Although I love Auto (and there were a few good jokes in this episode), I didn't like this episode.. Don't like Meg much either (never did).And where's Gabrielle? I'm not watching this episode any time soon again...
011. Dauther of Pomira:
The return of the Horde... This episode can't hold a candle to ""The price"" (season 2), where the Horde was first introduced. Not a great episode.
012. If the shoe fits:
Very funny episode, a re-telling of Cinderella (Tyrella, in this episode). Great Xena and Gabrielle interaction. Didn't like the little princess, though...
013. Paradise found:
Gabrielle down the rabbit hole, just like Alice in Wonderland.... Didn't like the way they portrayed Xena's dark side. Lucy Lawless would have portrayed it beautifully without all the physical changes, in my humble opinion.
014. Devi:
Great episode!! Renee does a great job as the manipulative Tataka. Here, we get to meet Eli for the first time.
015. Between the lines:
Another wonderful episode! Here we learn that the souls of Xena and Gabrielle are forever connected. Beautiful... Also, Gabrielle loses her ""golden fleece"".
016. The way:
Xena and Gabrielle find their way... Loved the Krishna story line.
017. The play's the thing:
Gabrielle writes and directs her own play. Pretty funny episode.
018. The convert:
The return of Najara... Liked this one better than ""Crusader""
Joxer has trouble with his first kill...
019. Takes one to know one:
Gabrielle's birthday with a twist.... I don't like Discord one bit..
020. Endgame:
Wonderful episode!! Very well written and acted. Too bad that Ephiny had to die... She's one of my favorite amazons.
021. Ides of March:
WOW!!! What an incredible episode!! One of my all time favorites. Xena's dreaded vision comes true...
022. Deja Vu all over again:
I'm not a fan of this kind of ""ber"" episodes, but it's quite funny. (didn't like it at all after a first viewing, but it grows on you...) I liked ""Soul possession"" better (season 6) which is kind of a continuation of this episode...
This season had its ups and downs but I still liked it a lot. Hope you will too! Battle on!",1033257600,11,3807,4.792998477929984
