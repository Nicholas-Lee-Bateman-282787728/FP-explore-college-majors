2828390,4,B000PUB2AM,"Powerful and gentle are my two thoughts on this DVD. When I don't have the energy to drive to the gym for a workout or even use one of my yoga DVDs at home this is my first choice as an alternative.

It's a quiet practice, working with energy flow and intention. It's not about weights or how flexible you are - or are not. Perhaps if you have never been introduced to this type of practice it may be strange to hear about chi and meridians but if you have an open mind you can simply trust that it is working.

A little thing that I like is that when instruction is given to place your left foot forward, he places his right foot forward so that you are in a mirror image of him. This makes it easier to follow along without having to think too much.

Also, what I like is the option to do the practice with verbal instruction or with just the music once you feel comfortable enough to work without the verbal cues.

My only criticism is that I wish there was a way to pick and choose which exercises you will be doing before you start like in the yoga DVD ""Kundalini Yoga for Beginners & Beyond.""

This DVD focuses on balance and grace while building strength. It's an invitation to slow down and breathe using subtle and flowing movements. I always feel relaxed when I have finished, especially after the water segments.",1204761600,57,1323,4.276
2828391,4,B000PUB2AM,This video is very well done.  Matthew Cohen does a superb job of walking you through the fine points of the Qi Gong movements.,1203897600,4,127,4.291666666666667
2828392,4,B000PUB2AM,This is the second Qi Gong DVD we're purchased and it is very comprehensive.  I almost didn't pirchase it because the picture of Matthew Cohen on the front looks pretty hard core.  I'm not a Kung Fu kind of guy.  What my wife and I discovered once we started using it was a gentle and very realistic approach to a wonderful exercise form.  This is really 2 sessions on one DVD.  Both are very good.  I recommend this DVD to anyone of any age as an introduction - moderate practice of Qi Gong.,1201392000,54,492,4.236559139784946
2828393,5,B000PUB2AM,"This is my first introduction to Qi Gong and I have to say I'm hooked!! Matthew is a great instructor--easy to follow and very detailed in his instruction, which has helped a newbie like me.  I love that there are two workouts to choose from.  And the location...WOW, like the program, just amazing!",1194480000,24,299,4.622641509433962
2828394,5,B000PUB2AM,"QiGong sounds so wierd (it's pronounced CHEE-GUNG), but here in my little spa town, it's more popular than yoga.  I love it because I don't have to change into workout clothes or lie down on the floor, but the effects are immediate -- something about the breathing and the movement together are instantly revitalizing.  And it's much easier to learn than Tai Chi!

This program is my favorite because of the two practices:  one hot and one cool.  The FIRE program is great when I'm feeling sad or low on energy, or like I might be getting a cold.  The WATER program is great for calming down if I'm angry or stressed, or if I can't sleep.  Matthew's teaching is detailed and poetic, and the scenery is almost as healing as the practice!

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1194307200,108,757,4.555555555555555
2828415,5,B000PUB2AM,"This video may initially seem slow and simplistic, but if you follow the movements you will be pleased
with the results....as each section is a complete work out for the entire body, lungs, heart, internal organs...
Moving meditation on breath, energy and control.....I think it is excellent..the instructions are clear and very helpful.
This is great for your health, body and mind!!!",1484179200,,385,5.225806451612903
2828416,4,B000PUB2AM,I was seeking something that would be beneficial to my health and yet kind to my age.  At 70 my mind is often at cross ends with what the body can still do!  This is exactly what I have been looking for.  It is slow controlled movements that are easy to learn/follow along and is geared more to the health aspects of the art rather than the martial arts side as Tai Chi.  I have seen improvements in my balance and less episodes of my vertigo so I am well pleased with my purchase!,1483401600,4,481,4.085106382978723

2828423,5,B000PUB2AM,I have been studying Qi Gong for about 5 years now. I started learning with lessons and have taken several weekend workshops. I've been practicing everyday and find this DVD very helpful! It's great for the beginner but also for someone who has studied the practice as a reminder. I love the way it is set up so that you can listen with instruction or just go through it with the music and practice. I would recommend this to anyone interested in exploring Qi Gong for the first time or someone like myself that practices but needs a reminder or the many moves. Very easy to follow.,1459987200,2,582,4.4485981308411215

2828434,3,B000PUB2AM,It was ok. I don't like the scenery...stark and bare...not soothing.

2828468,3,B000PUB2AM,"I had seen this dvd for some time. I thought I would give it a try as I prefer qi gong over some of the other arts/exercises. Video quality is fine and instruction is pretty clear. I have only viewed the video, attempting the moves in a cursory way, but I would have to view this a number of times to get things down correctly, as would anyone. Not a problem. The problem is not doing it! I am disappointed that the exercise routines are approx. 40 minutes each. I was looking for 20 to 25 minute routine. Now, that is my own fault, but I am not knocking what the outcome would be if I put this video into practice. I am sure that I could adjust the exercises according to my schedule. It is just easier to have routines that one can learn, remember, and do when time allows. But, sometimes we need to set time aside for better health, and that is where I am falling short.  The three star rating is given only due to the routine length, not what I believe the quality and benefits from the exercises would/will be.",1407283200,,1015,4.205128205128205

2828471,5,B000PUB2AM,"I started out doing the Water for about a month and it is incredible - if you want to feel energy between your hands and move 'stillness' and release tension this practice will do it for you.
I then did the Yang or Fire practice and I can't get enough of this QiGong practice.
Matthew and his partner do an incredible job of demonstrating the movements.
I followed along for some time and now I can do these anywhere since I have them mesmerized - from time to time I will play the video again to be sure I am doing them right and I always find something I can improve on.
Since I've started QiGong it has become a part of my life, a part of me.
I prefer this practice to Yoga anytime, anywhere.

2828475,5,B000PUB2AM,"I use this DVD every night during Water/Kidney time before dinner. Matthew Cohen is an excellent instructor. It is easy to follow his mellow presentation style. I know it works for me because not only do I feel better after the exercise but I can feel the increased energy in my hands. I missed my nightly practiced this weekend, and I could tell. With other Qigong DVDs I could not wait for them to be over. With Matthew's instruction I do not want it to end because I always wind up feeling better. This is a must have DVD for those with shallow breathing and weaker kidney function.",1392076800,,585,4.425925925925926
2828476,5,B000PUB2AM,"My wife and I like to learn to practice qigong. We like to play a video such as this on our big screen TV and stand in front of it and follow along. This is what we want to do. We do not want a all talking video on theory and background; we want a follow along practice video.

This is one of the better pairs of videos we have. We do Water on Mondays and Fire on Tuesdays. I believe that water is more receptive and fire more energetic, but that's just my take.

It is clear that Matthew Cohen is good at what he does and is serious about it. He has a martial arts feel to him. The young woman seems to offer softer versions of the poses, perhaps more towards the healing side. In many ways, I follow her more even though I'm a guy.

The end result is a nice, well rounded practice that begins and ends in meditation with action sandwiched between. The 40 minutes seems to fly by. I like the emphasis on balance and I like the closing (clearing) on each prqactice to bring each to a proper end.

These are two very high level qigong videos. I am 69 years old and if I can do these easily, you probably can as well.",1383523200,,1115,4.009009009009009
2828477,1,B000PUB2AM,"Although I received this DVD in a timely manner, the sound and visual quality sucks. There's no instructions, only the sounds of crackling fire wood or running water. So I have no idea how to be breathing or how my stance should be. And there is not an option for closed captioning. Also, the contrast on the video was so off the people looked similar to cartoons with all the color difference in background, faces, and skin of the instructors.  Im disappointed considering I bought two of these, one for a pregnant friend and myself and they are both this way. I hope for my issue to be fixed but the package didn't come a receipt, return address, or return postage paperwork.",1381536000,,677,4.549180327868853

2828481,4,B000PUB2AM,"I really liked this DVD.  Mathew Cohen presents the material in a way that is easy to follow.  He presents it in a mirror fashion, so that when he talks about the left side, he moves his right side, so it corresponds with the side that the viewer is using.  The exercises are done methodically with good verbal instructions.  He has a good tone and he is easy to follow.  I like this DVD a lot.  The camera work is pretty good, except that there is a lot transitions, which is a little distracting.  If it wasn't for that, I would have given this review five starts.",1375574400,3,566,4.233644859813084

I definitely prefer the ""water"" practice.",1360972800,2,357,4.774193548387097
2828484,5,B000PUB2AM,Really like this workout. I like the form of Qi Gong demonstrated--one that I haven't done before. Easy to follow and can be as difficult (strenuous) or easy as you need.,1353801600,,170,4.516129032258065
2828485,3,B000PUB2AM,"I really enjoyed this and though that the two 40 minute programs were worth the cost of the DVD (even though some content is repeated). However I really would have liked a little more information on Qi Gong in general, it's history, practice and more specifically what defines it from Tai Chi which about 40% of the content on this disk appears to be.

Having practised Yoga for almost 8 years I was also left wanting more instructions on breath. Mind you there is constant narration of ""breathe in / out"" but I'm sure there must be more to it than that. Was given the impression that the breathing was through the nose but then I noticed several times that Matthew Cohen is opening his mouth and it's unclear if he's performing some kind of Qi Gong / Tai Chi breathing or even if he's out of breath.

Something else that became obvious after a while was that the woman seemed to be positioning her body differently than Matthew a lot of the time. i.e. leaning forward more, arms straight while his were almost bent at 90 degree angles and sitting with her waist just above knee level while Matthew would sit all the way down parallel or under his knees. Also despite instructing the viewer to place their feet at ""shoulder width"", both his and his assistant's feet are placed way wider than that (at least by my Yoga training).

I must stress that I'm glad I bought this. It's very well made and I really liked the extra on hand mudras (most of which I hadn't seen before) but if you're after more detailed instruction you may be disappointed.",1342915200,13,1544,4.487544483985765
2828486,3,B000PUB2AM,"The movements are great but the narative is so BORING.  It's slow and without any energy...like a bad lecture.  The people doing the exercise don't look happy joyful or at peace.  This dvd is more focused on exercise not flow.  There is a pause between every movement.  I kept finding myself wanting this to be over.  Other qi gong masters, know how to flow right along and make you enjoy the movements and find joy.  Won't buy another one by Cohen",1338422400,3,448,4.45679012345679
2828487,5,B000PUB2AM,"This video was offered on my cable service, but it was discontinued.  I've been searching for it and plan to order my own copy.  I'm 64 years old and have fibromyalgia, so strenuous exercise videos can wear me out.  This video gives a good stretch and is also stress reducing. There are some weird movements that require twisting and swinging the arms ...it's supposed to help the digestive system. I think my energy level improved after using this DVD.",1336694400,2,453,4.708860759493671
2828488,5,B000PUB2AM,"Love Fire and Water-easy to follow for beginners, good quality recording, you can choose as few or many of the exercises as you want to do, nicely paced and formatted so that it's easy to skip or repeat sessions if you want to focus on something in particular. I've been practicing Medical Qi Gong for years (but with only a few courses w/Masters), and found this DVD a nice enhancement to my practice. Sometimes I chose one or two of the segments to practice over and over, refining the movements or just enjoying that emphasis for the day.

I appreciate the healing emphasis as well as the physical and mental benefits. I like that there is a female practitioner, although I think they/Matthew should've given her credit/an intro as well-nice to see that each person's style/appearance may not be exactly the same as the instructor, yet you are still doing it 'right'.

I think there's value in seeing QiGong by traditional Asian practitioners, but have been disappointed in the quality, coherence, or menu organization of them, and some are very rigid regarding technique. This DVD was not a disappointment! During midwest winter months especially, when it's either hazardous or arduous to make it to a class (not to mention costly and some of the teachers are not as good as on this DVD), it's nice to have something to practice at home, and the sessions helped fire up my mood as well as keep me moving in therapeutic, empowering ways. I think it was worth the money spent, have been using this DVD for several years. For a more meditative, full-practice gentle style of Qi Gong, I recommend Teja Bell's Radiant Heart Qi Gong (available through Pranamaya).",1334534400,4,1661,4.7839721254355405
2828489,5,B000PUB2AM,"This is one of the best exercise-type of DVDs I have ever purchased.  In fact, this is the only one that I continue using on a regular basis-- it's THAT good!  I've been using it for almost a year.

It's wonderful to have two main workout sessions to choose from:  Water or Fire.  Each one lasts approximately 40min. and there is some meditation at the end, which is lovely.  While my inclination is towards the Water workout, by mixing it up with sometimes Water and sometimes Fire, I don't get bored.

The things that make this workout so great:

1.  Having a male and female presence.  This not only makes it more interesting to watch, but also shows that it's okay if the poses vary slightly.  Also, it just feels more balanced.

2.  The pace.  It flows just right; it's calming, yet energizing, and it goes by quickly.  I'm often surprised that i've reached the end.

3.  The mirror-image.  If the instruction is to put left foot forward, it's the mirror-image onscreen.  I love not having to think about which arm/leg to move.  As Cohen says, ""We spend so much time in our heads, it's time to focus on our bodies and breath.""  (That is a paraphrase of the quote.)

4.  The scenery.  It's awe-inspiring.  (Look up the Alabama Hills in California where it was filmed to get an idea.)

5.  The music.  It's so good, I rarely notice it.  In fact, I can't even tell you what it sounds like off the top of my head.  It just fits.

6.  The transitions.  Between each exercise, the screen shows a faded out image of something--flowers, water, etc. with the title of the exercise.  There is also a sound such as wind, or water flowing, with the transition.  It's beautiful, calming, and prepares me for what's next.  These transitions work really well and is just one of the many things that work together to make this a great DVD.

7.  The ability to turn off the instruction and just have music play.  Personally, I like the instruction and haven't felt the need to turn it off, but it's nice to have that option.

8.  The extras.  There is the option to watch an Introduction about Qi Gong, or a free-from demonstration (of Cohen) which is beautiful to watch, or do some Mudras.  I really enjoy doing the mudras even though sometimes it's hard to follow.

9.  With consistent practice (3-5 times a week) I find that I am feeling the energy more and more.

One thing that could be better:

Sometimes critical parts of the instruction come at the end of the pose.  All this means is that it will take a few times doing the workout before you are doing all the poses correctly.

I love this DVD and would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in Qi Gong.  It's very well done, and very effective.  It's also easy to watch again and again without getting bored or annoyed-- a feat for any DVD of this type!

2828490,1,B000PUB2AM,"First the video shown with the product description is deceptive, that's not Qi Gong. The two sets of exercises are not very interesting in my opinion, focusing mostly on chi pulsing, chi movement. I'm not a 'believer' in that but enjoy tai chi and yoga as forms of exercise for strength, flexibility and balance. Qi Gong apparently doesn't go there if this DVD is representative.

2828492,4,B000PUB2AM,"I originally bought this for my mother, but have ended up using it myself. It's pretty fun, it's different and it doesn't drive me nuts trying to follow along with the on-screen directions. I found it to be relaxing and strengthening and the only reason I would not rate it five stars is personal preference. I'd say five stars if it had really impressed me, but while it is pretty good, my reaction wasn't ""WOW"". Still, a decent program and a good workout.",1317254400,,457,4.518072289156627
2828493,5,B000PUB2AM,"I've been doing Tai Chi for about 6 - 7 months now and was looking for something to change things up a bit.  For a lack of better words, Wow!  My legs were shaking by the end of the Fire routine the first time I did it.  Now I'm not trying to scare anyone off here, just want to let you know that this is a really good work out.  The upside is you can make it as easy or hard as you want (I was going more for the hard side when I was doing it).
My only complaint about this video, is the breaks between the forms/poses.  It would be nice if there was a segment that ran everything together on the DVD.  Other than that it's really good, and something I look forward to doing on a regular bases.
Another nice aspect of this one is there are two people doing the exercises and his ""assistant"" is normally doing a slight variation which is nice.  They also show everything from multiple angles so it makes it easier to pick up the movements vs a straight on shot like most videos.
Enjoy!!!",1311292800,,987,4.056701030927835
2828494,4,B000PUB2AM,"This is my first experience with Qi Gong, altho I have done tai-chi and it's similar.  I've only done the ""fire"" part, haven't done the water part yet. The instructor explains things very well and I think it's a good dvd for beginners as well as more advanced.

There is a first part where he talks and explains the moves, then you can also go go a part where you can just go thru the moves and not hear his voice.  There was a part marked ""music only"" but there is nothing there so I don't know what that's about.

You need a good amount of leg strength to do this dvd.  His only suggestion for modification is either standing up straighter if you want less, or bending your knees more if you want more.  However, I have been doing some of it sitting on an exercise ball because alot of the moves, at least in the ""fire"" part, are just arms anyway, so standing for a really long period of time with knees bent just to do arm movements didn't seem beneficial to me personally.

But all in all, I think it was worth the money and a good dvd.  I'm not into worshiping the earth so the references to this sort of thing I just let go by.  It just seems like a relaxation type of exercise--I haven't made any connection to channeling energy that he talks about.",1311120000,4,1256,4.2
2828495,5,B000PUB2AM,I had rented it from the library and liked it so much that I bought it.  I have tried multiple Qi Gong videos for use in my Eastern Massage class and this is by far the best.  The students really related to it and they could more readily feel the energy which was important in learning to feel the meridians and do acupressure as well as marma points.,1310860800,,351,4.147058823529412
2828496,4,B000PUB2AM,"I use this video for a morning and evening workout, it's short and sweet, a good 20-30 minutes. Fire for morning, if you have experience with chi gung you can tell the fire routine is meant for morning and getting energy going, and the water is meant for cleansing, winding down and night. Sure, you could do both/any anytime without harm, but it's best to do what the chi intends. That's a little weird though that Cohen doesn't really fully explain this, implies but really doesn't explain the intent of these routines, or maybe I didn't catch that part on the video.

Overall, it's well done in terms of not too fast or slow to follow, and each exercise gets about the right amount of time to feel its benefits.

The one quibble I have is the 'water' sequence would have been better if the background music or the setting where they do the exercise had water in it. It doesn't. It's in some very dry place that looks like the south west, beautiful scenery but nothing that evokes water. It's a minor quibble.

Another good thing about this one is that a beginner or advanced chi gung student can do them fine and benefit.",1303344000,2,1124,4.4731707317073175
2828497,5,B000PUB2AM,"I had never done Qi Gong before getting this DVD set and so didn't know what to expect. I was looking for something to relax me since I had too much stress in my life. So I did the Water series first and was stunned at how well it worked - I sat down on the floor afterwards and didn't move for half an hour. I have also found that when I was really stressed, the first part of the Water series was hard to do, but by the second half the relaxation had set in and I was feeling much better. I found that doing this several times a week after work was an excellent way to calm me down, although it didn't seem to do much else physically since it was so gentle. The Fire series on the other hand is much more intense and definitely more energising (as it is meant to be). While I would still feel calm, it was in a different way to the way I felt after the Water series, such that I was more focussed and ready to get on with things that needed to be done. The only problem though was that the Fire series really worked the legs and I found that I would be really sore for a couple of days afterwards, which of course meant it was good for strengthening the legs. I highly recommend this to anyone curious about Qi Gong, particularly if they are using it as a means to destress. The instruction is clear both visually and verbally, the background scenery is pleasant and calming, and the music is very complementary. There are also some really great shorts/demonstrations by Matthew Cohen that are fascinating and beautiful to watch.",1300233600,5,1531,4.228668941979522
2828498,5,B000PUB2AM,"This is a gorgeous instructional DVD, and a pleasure on every level. Matthew Cohen's instruction is clear and simple, with never a wasted word, and yet he never sounds like he's dumbing-down his insights into this profound and at times esoteric practice. And -- joy! -- his voice is calm and relaxing. Both practices (about 40 minutes total each) end with a seated meditation, and I only wish those meditations were longer. Both practices also have chapter headings for skipping around, though I've never been tempted to do so.

What I most enjoy about this is the thought that went into the production. The stunning outdoor setting somehow enhances the simplicity of the practices. Using voice-over instruction, Cohen performs both practices with another instructor; her equally calm presence and mirroring offers the eye and mind another place to learn from and study. Every visual detail seems to have been considered in advance. To name just two: i) the timing of the day (stunning morning light for the Fire practice; dusk-evening light for the more calming Water practice), and ii) crane shots that enhance the instruction by letting us see different angles than would be available to us if we were standing directly in front. Some 'jazzy' quick cutting here and there (the disc has a couple of free-form practice demonstration chapters separate from the instruction), but overall the artistic direction is sophisticated, subtle and unobtrusive. I particularly like the music and sound effects in the Water section.

One suggestion: keep the remote nearby at the end of the Water practice. You'll be in a mellow zone after the end of the meditation, and the music pops back on so quickly that it's kind of startling.

Overall, my favorite Qi Gong DVD by far. Can't wait for more from this instructor.",1296604800,6,1806,5.013333333333334

I have seen several Qi Gong DVD's, and so far this is my favorite.  From my experience, I have gained a very tactile understanding of this art through watching this DVD, and if he puts out a 2nd DVD, I would purchase it.  I hope this helps.",1286236800,,373,4.3768115942028984

What I really needed is Matthew Cohen to lead me through these exercises.  He has a very personal and spiritual way of teaching and moving.  When I do my Qi Gong DVD exercises, I always feel so much better, physically, emotionally, spiritually.

Even got some incredible insight and relief!

I've already gifted this DVD to 2 close friends.",1282003200,,428,4.578947368421052
2828503,5,B000PUB2AM,"Matthew Cohen explains the moves well and is really adept at conveying a meditative, mindful practice experience. His narration holds up to months of repeated viewings. Fire Qi Gong works better for me than water though some water moves and poses are great. I spent time with some other Qi Gong DVDs like the Garipolis. They were good but have different emphases than Matthew Cohen. This one is more full body and I consistently felt significantly MORE Qi after a fire workout than with other DVDs. It develops balance in a big way and after doing it for a few weeks, I felt more energetic, centered and flexible. Both mentally and physically. I've been doing it now for about a year. Usually do it right before bed and it helps me get more restful sleep. I wake up sometimes with an intense body energy the next morning depending on the intensity of the workout the night before.

The production on this DVD is also really well done. Great camera work. Great narration. Great setting - the hills. It has a grandness and vastness that is inspiring. Good music. Not too interesting or distracting but mysterious, stimulating and relaxing. Overall, this workout is good for beginners or people with more experience. Even after you develop further and integrate other styles, Fire Qi Gong will be an energizing and intensely Qi generating routine.",1280102400,5,1344,4.818181818181818
2828504,5,B000PUB2AM,"The beautiful red rock scenery alone is enough to make this DVD a winner.  Matthew's soothing voice and careful demonstration of the Qi Gong moves makes this even more special.

The Fire practice gently eases you into your day; while the Water practice helps you end your day on a relaxing note.  There is something magical about circular movements that soothe the body.

Matthew provides just enough instruction so you can do the moves correctly, without detracting from the workout.

A very highly recommended workout for anyone wanting to experience the magic and the peace of Qi Gong.",1279843200,3,588,4.959183673469388
2828505,3,B000PUB2AM,Based on other's reviews I expected a bit more from this DVD. I took a class and really liked Qi Gong. I guess doing a DVD is just not the same as taking a class in person.

We wish he would have another one out just for a change in the routines. We like the fire workout the best. I find myself unconciously doing the breathing and postures in my daily chores.

I am very pleased with this DVD.  It is exactly what I wanted.  I love that it has two different routines.  One (fire) is a little more strenuous - my thigh muscles hurt the next day!  But it is invigorating and definitely feels good.  I love the water routine the most, it is very flowing and gentle. I feel very centered and relaxed afterward.  I also think it is helping my back pain!

I flip between the two routines, Fire and Water, throughout the week.  The Fire routine is a bit faster and the Water routine is a bit more graceful.  Matthew Cohen explains how to move very clearly and even explains the origin of some poses, qigong terminology, how each pose is a benefit to you, and about your intention for the movement (i.e.: clearing away unwanted stress or gathering energy).  He is so clear that after the first couple of times watching the instruction, I was able to close my eyes and follow his voice.  The music and visuals are calming.  Now that I do these routines at least 3 times a week, I am experiencing much more focus in my life.

The production quality is excellent, head and shoulders above many others that I've seen.  Matthew Cohen's quality of movement is outstanding.  He clearly has a great deal of depth in what he is doing.

The movements themselves are well explained, though there's not a lot of explanation of qigong theory or principles provided.  But it's evident that Matthew is employing the theory and principles in what he is doing.  The DVD is not intended to teach qigong theory or principles.  It's intended as a follow-along practice.

This DVD along with some other books or videos on the theory and principles of qigong would provide a very nice background for an excellent qigong practice.  Highly recommended!",1232064000,15,899,4.973154362416107

2828522,5,B000PUB2AM,"I highly recommend this DVD. It consists of two fantastic and powerful practices. As the title suggests, the Fire practice is more vigorous and energizing and the Water more calming and relaxing. Each set begins with rooting/centering, then a bunch of movement exercises, followed by a few static standing postures, and closes with a seated meditation. The Fire  practice in particular is incredibly grounding and it's easy to work up a mild sweat even though the moves are performed very slowly. I just have one major criticism which is that a few of the standing postures are not explained very well. The ""dragon stance"" in particular is a bit complex and the instructors adopt it very quickly with little instruction to guide you into it initially. It's also a very demanding posture and although a strong beginner could do it, it's definitely not for those who are out-of-shape or weak. This is also true of a couple other postures in the Fire section, mainly because the stances are low and wide (called ""horse stance""). I don't mean that as a criticism so much as a disclaimer. But if you can manage them, your legs will get a great workout (and you can always start out by holding a higher stance at first). The Water practice is suitable for about anyone though. One of the things I like about the DVD is that the moves are performed very slowly (even for typical Qigong), which makes it easy to follow and very relaxing. Also, as someone else noted, the sequencing of moves is really nice and makes a lot of sense. Production-wise, the DVD is top-notch, the setting stunning, and the voice-over instruction by Cohen clear and helpful. And the music is quite good (a tribal/new age/eastern-sounding mix) though I wish there was an option to turn it off because I find it distracting at times (you can turn off the narration though). All in all, this is some of the most effective and enjoyable Qigong I've learned so far. I use these practices almost every day right now.",1211155200,31,1979,4.703170028818444
