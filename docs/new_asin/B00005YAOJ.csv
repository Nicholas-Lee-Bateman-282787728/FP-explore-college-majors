7956897,4,B00005YAOJ,"Gene Roddenberry always thought of the Star Trek universe as a time and place when humanity would finally rise above its barbaric past and live in simple peace and harmony. This was why the Enterprise bridge crew was racially diverse and even included a Russian. The problem is that there is not a lot of dramatic conflict in peace and harmony, which is why we often find episodes like ""Star Trek: The Next Generation,"" Episode 95, ""The Drumhead"" (Written by Jeri Taylor, Aired April 29, 1991), where the problems of the present are extended to the future. Certainly on the one hand this episode deals with the evils of righteous persecution, which we saw during the Red Scare of the McCarthy period, but which go back to the Salem Witch Trials and beyond. But this episode also speaks to one of the annoying dramatic conventions of the STNG, which is that while there is not a finer captain in Starfleet that Jean-Luc Picard, there are Admirals back at Headquarters who are idiots, controlled by weird little alien creatures, or, in this case, subject to acute paranoia.
Certainly it is great to see a film actress of some repute such as Jean Simmons playing the role of Admiral Norah Satie, but it would be even better if she was not playing yet another Starfleet Admiral jumping off the deep end until Picard brings them back to reality. Satie is investigating possible sabotage after an explosion rocked the Enterprise's dilithium chamber. There had been a report that the Romulans had recently received detailed schematics of the device. Worf uncovers the fact that a visiting Klingon exobiologist stole the plans, but the man denies he had anything to do with the explosion although he admits stealing the schematics. Satie's investigation widens, and when she learns that Simon Tarses, one of the medical technicians, lied about the fact that his grandfather was Romulan and not Vulcan, the admiral's investigation escalates. When Picard tries to offer a reasonable defense for Simon's actions, Satie decides that Picard too is obviously a Romulan collaborator.
I will not quibble with those who really like ""The Drumhead."" Certainly watching Simmons and Stewart go head to head is worth the price of admission, and when it comes to STNG episodes dealing with Picard in conflict with the clowns who rise to the rank of admiral in Starfleet, you will not find an episode better than this one. I just have a prejudice against stories in which military leaders are invariably portrayed as people too dangerous to have anywhere near advanced weaponry. That stereotype is already too rampant in the movies today and it would be nice if it were eradicated in the Star Trek universe at least. Do we really believe there are more pseudo-Napoleons and Hitlers in our military than Powells and Schwarzkopfs? If so, why are we sitting around watching old episodes of Star Trek?",1073520000,,2873,4.901437371663245
