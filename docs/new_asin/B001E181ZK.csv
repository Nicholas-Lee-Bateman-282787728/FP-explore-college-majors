8296061,4,B001E181ZK,"Documenting the 2008 edition of the world's most prestigious endurance race, the DVD highlights all of the excitement surrounding the tense battle between Audi and Puegeot for top honors in the race. The DVD covers the entire Le Mans weekend -- practice, scruntineering, qualifying, Friday night's festivities and the race itself.

The DVD is similar to the 2007 version. Here are some of its strengths and weaknesses:

STRENGTHS
-- Good coverage of the Audi-Peugeot battle. Most of the DVD is devoted to covering the duel between the two diesel-powered teams and their six combined cars.
-- Extensive highlights of practice and qualifying. A little more than an hour is devoted to the actual race.
-- Coverage of the events going on at Le Mans. The DVD goes into the new course change at Tetre Rouge and covers the celebrations marking the centennial of Wilbur and Orville Wright's trip to Le Mans in 1908.
-- Highlights of the Le Mans historical race featuring Group C cars from the 1980s and early 90s.

WEAKNESSES
-- Too little onboard footage. Last year (and the 2005 version) offered full-in car laps on the Peugeot and Audi. There are only small clips in the 2008 version.
-- A large portion of the DVD has overlapping coverage. The DVD covers practice and qualifying twice since the first portion of the DVD is nothing more than a syndicated highlight show covering practice and qualifying (it was the same two, half-hour shows with preceded SPEED's coverage of the race last year). This adds about an hour of repetition to the DVD. This has been an on-going problem with these DVDs since they came out in 2002.
-- Too little focus on the other class races. Corvette-Aston Martin coverage in GT1 is decent, but the P2 and GT2 battles only are mentioned sporadically (most of it coming when one crashes or has a mechanical problem).",1240876800,2,1839,4.813291139240507

8296063,4,B001E181ZK,"This is a very good review of the 2008 Le Mans 24 Hour race.  I have all the reviews going back to 2002 and this is one of the best.  It covers all aspects of the race.  If you are new to sports car racing or are just interested in this race, it is worth the price and will give you a good insight into what it takes to race and win this event.",1229040000,3,344,3.6216216216216215
