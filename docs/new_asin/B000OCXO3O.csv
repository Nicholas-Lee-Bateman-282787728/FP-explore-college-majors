8184513,4,B000OCXO3O,"This is a tv show that you would find on the History Channel, but in China.  There are two episodes here: one about Chinese puppets and the other Leather Silhouettes, each episode a half hour long and spoken in Mandarin with English subtitles .  The first episode documents the history of Chinese puppets, and how it was a form of entertainment for the royal family, but later became available to the general public.  Ideas for the puppets came from international visitors, particularly from Europeans who wanted to entertain the emperor.  The other episode talks about leather silhouettes or shadow shows that were performed as Chinese operas, a folk art and entertainment in China.

Both forms of entertainment were popular attractions for large audiences.  Think of them as early motion pictures.  People were going to watch these shows like they were going to watch movies.  This tv show provides valuable information about art and entertainment in the olden days of China.  Very interesting for anyone who is into art and the history of these two forms of entertainment and how they are created.",1457481600,,1100,5.0
