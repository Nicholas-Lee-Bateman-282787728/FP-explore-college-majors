8359309,4,B002ACPNV2,"Santa Mesa is a heart-warming story of a young boy whose world is literally turned upside-down after the tragic death of his Mom.  It is amazing to see the strength, courage and resiliency that Hector must call upon to survive.  The vivid on-location scenes really bring out the emotional and cultural struggle.  I highly recommend this movie -- don't be put off by the subtitles.",1246752000,,380,4.815384615384615
8359310,5,B002ACPNV2,"Santa Mesa is one of those films where you wish it could go on longer. It's quite an impressive debut for Ron Morales, a former camera/crew member on such films such as the Departed and Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist.  He clearly picked up some major soft skills as he explores the journey of 12-year-old Hector, born and raised in the US, to a strange new land - the Philippines - where he can't speak the native language (Tagalog) and lives with an older relative who can't speak English.

Morales successfully avoids the common cliches of culture clash and poking fun of differences.  Rather, through Hector's eyes he gently takes us through a gritty new community where he must learn to survive by choosing his friends, mentors and relationships.  One of the main characters is the background of poverty along the railroad tracks where Hector now must call home - a constant reminder of the challenges and noise that Hector must filter out and overcome.

The film's milieu and pace reminded me of a younger, coming-of-age Lost in Translation, without the commercial or celebrity overtones.  The standout performances from a talented ensemble of mostly unknown actors includes one from the grandmother whose emotion you can feel just under the surface, and the Jose character who is not whom he seems to be.  There is a lovely scene where Hector enters a place he is not supposed to be, where you can feel the emotion that he so desperately wants to be there as a throwback to the life he once knew - and yet remains unstated.

The story is both touching and compelling, and like any good independent film leaves some open questions - but only to the extent that you feel you just spent some quality time in a different world that you'd like to visit again. I saw this in San Francisco SFIAAF last year and it won a Fan Favorite award - and it was well deserved!",1245110400,2,1869,4.642424242424243
8359311,4,B002ACPNV2,"This film was very touching and moving to me as it followed the life experiences of a young boy who left the only place he called home to be introduced to a world unknown on the other side of the planet. Many of us have been through experiences such as these at one point in time in our lives. I loved how the producers were able to make you place yourself in Hector's shoes, the star of the movie and feel many of the frustrations he learned to overcome.

To me, Santa Mesa was about making the best of what you have in life and where you are in life to grasp who you really are in this great, big world.",1244592000,2,605,4.0
8359312,4,B002ACPNV2,"A pleasant surprise.

The theme is Filipino but is different from a regular Filipino film.
The screen play/narrative is not typical Filipino and very good.
The perspective is not that of a Filipino.

The cinematography is surprisingly good;
reminiscent of The Slum Dog Millionaire.

Direction is very good; would have shone more had the theme been a little more complicated.",1244505600,,374,5.2
8359313,5,B002ACPNV2,Our family really enjoyed this movie. Congratulations to young actor Jacob Shalov (portrayed Hector) on a job well done. Good family movie. Very well directed and the cinematography of Manila outskirts is revealing. Highly recommend this one.,1244505600,,242,5.5675675675675675
8359314,4,B002ACPNV2,"A very touching coming-of-age story.  Poignant without being melodramatic.  Beautiful cinematography, terrific performances by the teenage actors.  Recommended!",1244073600,2,160,7.777777777777778
