THANK YOU!",1267142400,,77,5.333333333333333
7930778,5,B0000549AW,I am a Yoga Zone fan. With this collection I can pick my choice of yoga. I especially enjoy the Yoga for Abs as it really makes you sweat and you can feel a difference. Great collection with two sessions in each cassette. Namaste,1123372800,,229,4.2272727272727275
7930779,2,B0000549AW,"I really disliked these videos.  I was surprised to find, after reading the other reviews, that these videos were boring, cheezy, and entirely too easy.

First of all, three out of five of my tapes had no sound.  While this is no mistake of the yoga zone people, it was still very frustrating.

Secondly, I could not get into these videos.  The people were way too talkative, and the relaxation and meditation did not work because they chatted throughout the entire time.

I definately recommend Rodney Yee or other Gaiam products ahead of Yoga Zone if you really want a good, effective, meaningful yoga workout.",1111536000,3,612,4.780952380952381
7930780,5,B0000549AW,This is the first set of yoga tapes I ever bought and actually use. I've tried Living Yoga for beginners but found them complicated and hard to follow. Yoga Zone's instructors are very knowledgeable and easy to follow. This set gives you 2 20 minute workouts per tape so variety is never a problem. These tapes will give you a great workout if you are new to yoga.,1110844800,3,364,4.367647058823529
7930781,5,B0000549AW,"As Alan Finger says on the TV version of Yoga Zone, ""get ready for the workout that will change your life.""  These twenty minute workouts are the best way to start they day.  It is easy for a busy person like myself to set aside twenty minutes in the morning and do these yoga practices.  Instead of feeling tired and worn out like other kinds of exercise could, I feel refreshed and energetic to face the day.  Unfortunately we don't get the TV version of Yoga Zone in my area any more.  The only thing that I don't like about this video is that there aren't enough of them.  I hope they will make more of these workouts available on VHS or DVD.

7930782,5,B0000549AW,"I ordered this set ten months ago and I do one tape (2 sessions) 3 to 4 times per week.  If you want to lose weight and tone up your body they will work. After doing the tapes for 3 months I started to get asked what I was doing because I was losing weight, now I continuously receive compliments from friends, family and coworkers asking me what I have been doing to get in such great shape.  I tell them Yoga.  I don't run or do anything else. But you also have to watch what you eat it's a total mind body connection.  Because there are two sessions on each of the five tapes you never get bored with them and the instructors are upbeat and fun to workout with.  I am really happy that I purchased these tapes they really have made a difference in my life.  If you are looking for a fun challenging workout Yoga Zone can work for you too.",1051833600,14,841,4.066666666666666
7930783,5,B0000549AW,"I bought the 5-pack about a year ago, and it's still my favorite set of yoga tapes today.  There are two 20-minute segments on each tape which covers something a little different (yoga basics, yoga for abs, total body conditioning, intro to power yoga, and evening stress release).  You get a great introduction to different kinds of yoga workouts, the variety makes it so you don't get tired or bored of any one tape, and you can pick and choose according to what you feel like doing on any given day.  You can go through two sessions on one tape or mix and match and get a great combination workout.  Even if you've done yoga for a long time, these workouts can still provide a nice change of pace--it's great for 'getting you back to the basics'.
The yoga sessions are videotaped at the Grand Lido Sans Souci in Jamaica which makes for a beautiful backdrop, and the background music enhances but doesn't get in the way.  The instructors are good at explaining proper form and breathing techniques, and they help you set your frame of mind (i.e., having willful determination but non-concern for results and using yoga and breathing techniques to speak to any stress that you're feeling).  Some of the sessions are definitely stronger than the others, but the different styles of all the instructors is preferable to hearing the same person go through the same workout every day.  There is consistency between the Yoga Zone instructors in explaining proper form, and they give you options to make the poses easier or more challenging for you.  This makes it so the routines can be adapted to individuals at different fitness levels.
Having a good variety of sessions to choose from and being able to customize your own workout makes this set well worth the money.",1048204800,21,1765,4.726384364820847
7930784,5,B0000549AW,"This 5 pack VHS set by yoga zone is well worth getting in every way.
 The instructors are easy to follow and very personable. The poses are done in mirror image for you, so that when they want you to use your left leg, they use their right (and since they are facing you it's easier to follow, especially in poses that are more complex). Also they constantly alternate the primary instructor from session to session so you get a lot of variety which I find enjoyable.
 The routines are very well put together, have a really great flow ,are short enough to fit in on a daily basis, and enjoyable to do.
 Also I like the way many of the routines will build in sections into longer sequences of poses. So you're not just thrust into a pose, but eased into them in a way that lets your body ""warm into"" the pose as well as ""master"" each section of the flow. The instruction is very clear and they give very useful ways of helping you with the more subtle details of the poses.
 In many parts of the sessions there are also a lot of very creative and interesting longer sequences of poses that they have put together (vinyasa (flow) style) which you generally do about 3 times before moving onto the next pose or series of poses. This helps create a nice heat in the body.
 There are two 20 minute routines on each tape, so you can just do one if you're short on time or energy or both, or you can mix one routine from one tape with a routine from another and still do it in about 40 minutes.
 The scenery is beautiful, filmed in Jamaica (which I personally find adds a lot to my enjoyment) and has ""island"" type music which adds to the overall vibe of the tapes.
 I highly recommend this set, not only for beginners, but for those folks who would like variety in their practice (I've personally been practicing for over 4 years on a daily basis). I like to use these tapes when I want enough of a challenge but not an overwhelming one. I often rotate doing these tapes with more intense days (where I might use a video by Bryan Kest, Baron Baptiste, David Swenson etc.).
 The price per tape is also very reasonable by buying them as a set of 5 rather than individually.
 While I hate to compare different types of tapes, I would have to say that overall I like the Yoga Zone tapes better than I do many of the living arts tapes. They seem to have an overall better flow in terms of both the sequencing of poses and the pace (many of the living arts tapes, Rodney Yee in particular are a bit too rushed).
 Still, there are many Living Arts videos I do find comparable: Suzanne Deason's ""Stress Relief Yoga"" is a great short tape, ""Patricial Waldens' ""PM Yoga"" is excellent, and Suzanne Deason's ""Weight Loss"" tape is also quite good for a longer routine which is certainly more than just a ""weight loss"" routine.
There is only one mistake on all the tapes, and that is in the second session of the ""Total Body Conditioning"" tape, they somehow forgot to precede a side lunge with a forward lunge when they switch from doing a ""lunging sequence"" from one leg to the other leg.
 I just rewind here, do the various lunges with the other leg and then forward the tape to the next pose. It's not that big a deal to do because you'd be setting up to switch legs there anyway so it doesn't affect the flow too much. It's a shame they didn't fix this, but not something that would prevent me from recommending this set. Just be aware of it when you practice so that you keep the routine ""balanced"".
 Another excellent set that was just released is from Rainbeau Mars. It's a four tape set in a vinyasa flow style called ""Sacred Yoga"". The first two tapes are more gentle ""For Beginners"" and ""Pure Tranquility"" and the last two are more challenging ""Pure Power"" and ""Pure Sweat"". These are highly recommended also!

 Namaste.",1030060800,53,3810,4.355430183356841
7930785,5,B0000549AW,"I just ordered this set of videos and have been very pleased with them.  They are an excellent place to start with learning the various parts of yoga.  The tapes all have two 20 minute sessions so they are easy to fit into a busy schedule.  I like to pick three out and do a full hour of mix and match, that way I don't get bored with the same routines and instructors.  I do believe the relaxation is way too short and some of the instructors are quicker than others but all in all I think these tapes are an excellent, easy way to start on the Yoga track for an exceptional value.",998092800,12,582,4.078947368421052
7930786,5,B0000549AW,"As of writing this there was no info on what tapes are included in the pack so I did  some research. Included are ""Yoga Basics for Beginners"", ""Evening Stress Relief"", ""Total Body Conditioning"", Introduction to Power Yoga"" and ""Yoga for Abs"". Hope this helps!",975801600,185,259,4.886363636363637
