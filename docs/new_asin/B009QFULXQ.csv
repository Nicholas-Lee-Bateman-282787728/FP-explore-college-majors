5361009,4,B009QFULXQ,"Dear Dracula... a very cute kids movie.. I know when i was little writing to Dracula instead of Santa sounds like something i should have thought of.. The jokes are geared more for kids but adults can still laugh too..  Like making fun of costumes that aren't scary.. haven't you ever wondered what is scary about a princess or a puppy dog? Isn't Halloween supposed to be ""spooky""?  Also as far as the last reviewer mentioning Twilight.. look i know those movies are popular and are made very well but vampires should be scary.. not moody.. Dracula is the king of vampires! Hell The Count from Sesame Street is more ""scary"" than the Twilight vampires!! LOL",1351987200,3,656,4.646551724137931
5361010,3,B009QFULXQ,"This is an hour long Halloween cartoon for kids, perhaps 4-9 age group. Sam (Nathan Gamble) lives with his grandmother. He writes Dracula (Ray Liotta) who in turn visits Sam on Halloween. Sam helps Dracula get his scare back while Dracula helps Sam with his shyness involving Emma (Ariel Winter). Sam has a pet spider named Webber which makes him an outcast to his peers which include the stereo typical shallow cheerleaders.

Very boring production for parents and older kids. The jokes lines are old. Film is of course critical of ""Twilight"" as that has become the fad. I would go watch ""Monsters and Aliens"" instead.",1351382400,2,619,4.839622641509434
5361011,5,B009QFULXQ,"The Dollar Tree sells this DVD for $1.00 but if you can't find it there then it is still worth the $5.00

 This is a really cute film, my 3 year old watched it almost the entire month of October just about every day.",1418428800,,216,3.8863636363636362

5361013,3,B009QFULXQ,"Should you happen upon this computer-generated film on DVD, it's pretty easy to want to compare it to some of the bigger studio releases of similar theme (like Hotel Transylvania or Igor to mention a few); and in doing so, it's a sure-fire way to find disappointment in Dear Dracula.  However, once you realize that this was a made-for-tv affair that originally aired around Halloween-time on Cartoon Network a few years back, it becomes a lot clearer what the intentions were here.  It also explains the ridiculously short 42-minute run-time of the feature (the 60-minute claim on the package includes an added extra of the program Artzooka); as it would have been a full hour program on network television when you factor in the commercials.

The story itself, surprisingly, is based on a graphic novel from 2008 of the same title that came out through Image comics (Shaowline imprint) in attempt to bring younger readers to the sequential art fold.  I should disclaim, however, that the film is a much more simplified variation of the 48-page source material; chief among the cuts is a thread whereby the lead character has ambitions of becoming a vampire for Halloween like his hero Count Dracula and begins to reconsider the request only after discovering that his diet of hamburgers and pizza would be forever replaced with visits to the blood-bank.

The story here makes things even more all-ages friendly by offering up a plot where main kid Sam, a huge classic horror movie buff, catches a commercial for a new Drac action figure that he absolutely has to have.  His grandma recommends he write Santa so as to get it for Christmas but Sam instead decides to write the Transylvanian Count instead.  What results is a surprise visit from the father of all vampires on Halloween night.  This would be a dream come true except it turns out our ol pal Dracula is suffering through a bit of an identity crisis of his own in that this modern generation simply doesn't fear him as they once did.  Almost like Rodney Dangerfield getting no respect complaints, a Halloween party being held across the street from Sam's house becomes an opportunity for Drac to find his lost mojo and for Sam to, uh become more confident around the fairer sex.  Wait, wasn't this the same dude just writing a letter to Santa concerning a toy? Oh, never mind all that.

The point here is that the setup becomes an ideal situation for the pair to learn a valuable life lesson and if the viewer comes away with same- mission accomplished.

The visuals are fairly simplistic and overly caricaturized but this is expected on a made-for-tv budget.  The younger viewers will likely be enamored enough with the tale not to notice and in all honesty, there is some hidden charm scattered about to keep the adults interested as well (the movie takes shots at contemporary films like Twilight & Saw, Dracula, voiced by Ray Liotta happens to call Sam a Goodfella and so on).

Of course, this shouldn't be mistaken for the type of mastery over the CG craft that we've been getting from Pixar, DreamWorks, Sony and the like; but it is an honest attempt to bring something clever into a modestly budgeted film.

In conclusion, Dear Dracula isn't going to challenge the supremacy of any of the leaders of the genre and aside from being a tad bit too user-friendly (if such a thing exists), it concludes a little briskly and anticlimactically presumably due to the light run-time.  Not to the point of plot-holes per se, but be prepared for final resolve to happen quickly and not entirely satisfyingly but again, the younger set will likely be far more forgiving about such things.

All in all, bargain bin pricing, especially around Halloween make this one fairly easy to recommend, especially if you're looking to keep some young ones entertained for a little over a half-hour.",1412467200,3,3844,4.791225416036308

5361016,4,B009QFULXQ,"At only 41 minutes in length (not one hour as the product page states) Dear Dracula probably should have been longer.  You do wonder if it was maybe originally made to be an episode of some wider horror themed cartoon TV show and the others were never made or ended up also being marketed separately.  It has good three dimensional type animation and a pretty well known cast of actors for the voices including Emilio Estevez, Ray Liotta and Ariel Winter (Alex Dunphy, Modern Family).  The storyline is pretty basic, pretty much a don't be afraid to overcome your fear and try something you're avoiding type message.  Basically a young boy who is known as a bit of creepy loser by the other kids writes to his hero Dracula, asking for him to send him the latest Dracula action figure.  Dracula's days of being feared by the masses have long past and he is thrilled to get a piece of fan mail after all these years so decides to visit the boy.  Both ultimately decide to help each other with their issues.

Has a lot of references to classic monster films and characters as well as makes fun of modern horror films such as Twilight and Saw.  It is young kid friendly in dialogue and plot but does suffer from being a bit too short.",1409356800,3,1230,4.435555555555555
