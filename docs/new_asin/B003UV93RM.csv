Returned and same thing happened about two-thirds of the way through. Poor quality. Unable to return 2nd disc. Again froze our equipment, had to shut everything down to get out of our DVD player. No problem with any of our other DVDs.",1293840000,2,384,4.5
4207701,2,B003UV93RM,"Good movie - great Lucille Ball performance.  DVD a disappointment.  DVD picture and sound quality OK.  Only way  to get this movie on DVD, but print obviously taken from a TCM showing, because TCM logo keeps appearing in lower right hand of screen.

Manufacturer and Amazon should warn potential buyers of this drawback.",1289347200,5,321,4.981132075471698

4207710,5,B003UV93RM,"I love Lucy and no pun intended

She was comic queen, royalty no matter what role she was playing you could count on her to make it hilarious
Lucille Ball plays Sally Elliot (Everyone knows Lucy from Everything radio to tv shows to movies)
Eddie Albert plays Humphrey Briggs (You might recall Eddie Albert from Green acres&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Green-Acres-Season-1/dp/B0000V4906/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Green Acres: Season 1</a>&nbsp;the whole series.)

SPOILER:::::
Sally and Humphrey are a couple  and they are wanting to get married but still need to secure the home of their dreams. They have the down payment but need to make more to make the house payment.
They work for a shady businessman but they do not know it yet. He give Humphrey promotion (suppose to only be for 1 day). So they get excited for the promotion and raise and Humphrey goes to put the down payment on their home.

Meanwhile: Sally has a friend come by her job and they talk about her working on the side as a fuller brush girl. Selling makeup door to door. But as luck would have it, while showing her some of the items they sell she accidentally causes a fire. Sally looses her job when she blows up the telephone operator equipment.
Desperate she decided if she was to practice being a Fuller Brush Girl before Monday then the Owner would for sure hire her....that is when everything that can go wrong does.

Times were simple back then (1950's) and films were more light hearted and comedy was more physical and situational than the movies of today. I love that time and black and white movies bring me back every time.

Child friendly and family fun or just curl up and relax as you journey to a time where live was easy and laughter was light ..",1464998400,,1784,4.871287128712871

4207723,4,B003UV93RM,"Although the stories are different, ""The Fuller Brush Girl"" reuses many of the comic elements used in Red Skelton's ""The Fuller Brush Man.""  For example, there is a scene where Sally (Lucille Ball) & Humphrey (Eddie Albert) are fighting a couple of thugs on a flat-topped roof covered with may TV antennas.  Every time they bump into one, the folks watching their small round-tube televisions down below get a funny, surprising change in channels.  In Skelton's movie, the bit was done with radio.

Almost all of the laughs are derived from slapstick ( dust blown in the face, slipping on bananas, and etc. ) and funny situations ( being tied up by kids playing cowboys and indians, and etc. )

There is one bit that involves wordplay;  it is easy to miss.  Listen closely to what Sally says to the four women to whom she has just given home permanents.  Her statement has a double meaning.

Overall:  This is a funny movie;  it is just not quiet as funny as the original.

Extra:  trailer.

DVD - 2011.  Picture (B&W): sharpness & contrast: good to excellent;  defects: none apparent;  measured Aspect Ratio: 1.41:1.  Of special note: the picture is smaller than the screen, not only on the sides, as is typical of ARs less than 1.77:1, but it also has black bars on top and on the bottom.  Sound volume normal, clear.  Subtitles: none.",1435449600,,1337,4.656652360515022
4207724,3,B003UV93RM,"There are some truly nutty moments in this film that  make it one of the classic pieces of Lucy comedy. The scene where a boys' toxic chemistry experiment gets mixed with a perming solution that Lucy is demonstrating is side-splitting......Lucy is always at her funniest when the mayhem that seems to plague her is not really her fault and she does her best to rectify the situation. If you are a fan of this wonderful woman,you haveto add this one to your collection.",1433980800,2,468,4.63855421686747
