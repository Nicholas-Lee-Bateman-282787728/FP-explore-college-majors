8014406,4,B0001M81BM,"This western remake of the war move Sahara is very good. Broderick Crawford heads the cast which includes Barbara Hale and Lloyd Bridges, who was also in Sahara. It's a good remake with suspense and well-staged action scenes. It's very good entertainment.",1354147200,5,255,5.095238095238095

8014408,4,B0001M81BM,Nervous Andr de Toth western. Ten people are trapped in an old Spanish mission in the middle of the desert. With a lot of thirsty mean Comanches around them. So it's not Ten Little Indians but rather Ten Little White Men here. Note the numerous close-ups of chapped lips in the movie. Have a beer on them ! Highly recommended.,1322438400,,326,4.45
