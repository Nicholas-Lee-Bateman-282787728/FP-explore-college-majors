If you like funny but a little melancholy movies you MUST SEE THIS. Sweet and sad, romantic and quirky, ""Men Don't Leave"" offers a stellar cast and top notch writing and directing.

346058,5,6301704754,"All I can say is where do I sign up to vote to have this movie and any extras they can dig up put on DVD. This movie is a whirlwind of emotions. You watch the disintigration and the ultimate piecing back together of a family in trama. I found this movie to be funny, sad, hopeful, depressing, joyous and pretty much a reflection of life as it really is.

Jessica Lange, who I have always thought was a phenomenal actress (barring King Kong days; hey a girl has to work) deserves much more lauds for her work than she receives, out does herself in this movie. Anything Kathy Bates is in pretty much a shoe in for entertainment. Joan Cusack is also outstanding in this as well, playing the self determined, I do things my kind of way, love interest to Chris O'Donnell, her performance is quirky and brings the character to life in the few short scenes she actually has in the movie.

Chris O'Donnell and Charlie Korsmo are integral to beauty and tragedy of the story line. Arliss Howard, not often mention when talking about this movie play an accordian pumping new age musician who comes into the lives of this family doing a crash and burn. He plays a divorced father of a child that he only sees marginally, and though he is interested in Lange's character, he just doesn't know how to get his arms around the whole situation.

All and all, this movie will get to you, get under your skin if you have any heart at all and will make you want to see it again and again.",1124928000,2,1468,4.330909090909091

346060,4,6301704754,"Sometimes life deals us a bad card. Men Don't Leave is a movie that depicts such tragedy to Jessica Lange's movie character when her well providing husband is killed in a work related accident.
From that point, money woes plague Jessica and she has to move her family from the lush suburbs to a more edgy part of Baltimore. At this point her two boys become more affected by the new surroundings as each crave for the attention left by the oid of their late father. Chris O Donnel's character is especially rebelious as he takes on ""the man of the house"" role and acts up around Lange's musician love interest.
Its very interesting how the relationships between mother and sons shift and change as the movie develops. The influence of both O'Donnel's and Lange's romantic relationships are quite unique as well. In spite of some rebelious attitudes by all, the bonds of family seem to stand strong. Help proves to be around the corner.
Good pacing, drama, and balance between laughter and tears. This movie does have a fairly broad appeal to many audiences.",1051315200,2,1057,4.718918918918919
346061,5,6301704754,"Jessica Lange is an American Treasure in the same league as Meryl Streep but with a much less lauded filmography. In ""Men Don't Leave,"" Lange plays a recently widowed woman who finds herself without much money, two young sons and no job. She moves to Baltimore to seek her fortune and make a new life for herself and for her family.
There is a deep and abiding humanity in everything Lange does. Here she is all naked emotion and frantic desperation tempered with an endless well of positivism.
Chris O'Donnell's scene at the Riverfront with Arliss Howard is one of the great, emotionally open and heart wrenching scenes in movies...ever. O'Donnell has not been as truthful in films, since.
""Men Don't Leave"" was much ignored when it first opened and it is an embarrassment that it is not available on DVD. But nonetheless, it contains one of the best performances of Jessica Lange's career and it is not to be missed by anyone interested in fine movie acting.",1047859200,27,960,4.720238095238095
346062,3,6301704754,"This film recommends itself so strongly to you that you feel the need to reach out and strangle it and cry 'STOP!' With a luscious cast including Jessica Lange, Joan Cusack, Chris O'Donnell and Kathy Bates, one would think that this would endear itself more than it ultimately did. Sadly though, despite being a terrific feature in terms of acting, I would have to agree with critic Ebert in saying that it finally falls under the weight of its' own ugly cliches.
Jessica Lange loses her husband in the first few minutes of the film, and a host of Chinese cooks get to witness her pain after her trip to the morgue (Lange later dreams about the cooks, though I can't imagine why). Her eldest son, played by a youthful Chris O'Donnell (whos supposed to be 17 here, but looks 13) is a snotty brat who wants to be 'man of the house' now that Daddys dead. Her youngest, played by Charlie Korsmo (a has been who could've been - he was also that boring child in 'Dick Tracy') is sweet enough and likeable, but the vapid script soon makes it hard to care about any of these people.
Lange wastes no time finding a new boyfriend in Baltimore. This was highly expected of course, and coming as it does just 25 minutes into the film, it marks the beginning of the end of this movie. Lange is a superb actress and tries to do things with her role that could possibly inject it with SOME kind of interest, but like all the others, she too stumbles. The only thing really worth watching here is Joan Cusack who plays a nurse living above the Lange family. She and Chris get it off, much to Lange's puzzlement and dismay, yet it is she who finally brings some sort of sanity into Lange's life (after a series of predictable cliches, of course).
All this goes to show that it is the weird who help the 'normal', I suppose. Whatever. The point is, this film starts so well and ends so tamely, and the director is to blame. How else could you explain the brilliant Kathy Bates utterly wasted as the owner of an exclusive Italian eatery? She has the minimal of lines, and barely begins to make a presence before the film ends. Disappointing.
Chris O'Donnell is impressive as the eldest son, though its easy to sleepwalk through such a role. His wooden-facedness makes it that much more tasklesss for him to achieve perfection in this part. Lange, as usual, does more for her character than any of the others, and Cusack is hilarious, though I wondered what she was doing in this film at all. And it was quite a relief to find that O'Donnell's character was supposed to be 17 in this movie - I was a trifle startled to see Cusack jump his bones, for she looked like she could be 30, and he really looks pre-teen like in this film. Oh well.
This is a good watch, and while certainly not as 'essential' as this website says it is, it does have its moments. Pity that the cliches got in the way of everything. Heres a spoiler : as usual, the child gets hurt, and this in turn brings the family together. Ho hum. BOOOOOORING!!",977270400,,3002,4.391382405745063
346063,3,6301704754,"When I was about 10, I got to be in this movie as an extra.  Although it was a lot of fun to spend a day ""in Hollywood,"" this movie stunk.  My family took me to see it when it came out in the theaters (it only came  out as a ""sneak preview""; not enough people went to see it to  qualify it as a hit), and we were greatly disappointed.  If you want to see  me, though, I'm the little boy on the lottery T.V. show when the main  character is watching T.V. at his father's funeral.",955324800,2,478,3.816326530612245
346064,5,6301704754,"On the A-list of my favorite movies. This is an overlooked gem of a film, where everything works. It reminds me of a great Salinger short story, where all the details are both suprising and totally convincing. There are  many moments in this movie that had to be based on direct observation, or,  if not, are acts of great creative imagination: the grocery line  conversation, the breakfast scene, the food delivery to the Peabody musical  performance, and many others. Joan Cusack, Kathy Black, Chris O'Donnell are  all outstanding. The music is perfect, as in Brickman's other great effort:  Risky Business. There are scenes shot in such a way that they keep evoking  different reactions, flipping back and forth between the feel of present  event and poignant memory, a sort of bipolar mood established sometimes by  nothing more than the distance of the camera from the actors and the  lighting. Lange's performance has one of two moments that seemed  unconvincing or forced to me, though she's tremendous overall. Like Bottle  Rocket and High Art, this is a nearly perfect movie that does what it does  so softly it hasn't gotten nearly as much critical attention as it  deserves.",944784000,13,1185,4.949238578680203

346127,4,6301704754,"Paul Brickman has had a very odd career as a director.  After debuting with the smash hit Risky Business, it was 7 years before he made another film  this small, intelligent and emotional drama.  Then that was it (except for one short) in the 25 years since.  A pity, since he showed a lot of talent, and a desire to go beyond Hollywood tropes and blend style with heart.

To me, Men Dont Leave, while much less known and less flashy than Risky Business is arguably the better film.  For the first 30 minutes or so this portrait of a family knocked out of whack by the sudden death of the father seems like it is going to shy away from real emotions, and how hard real grief really is.  But then, slowly, it becomes clear that the good face being put on by the film, is also the one being put on by the characters, and the cracks underneath go much deeper.  By late in the film the psychological damage done to both kids and adults by loss feels much deeper and true.

There are excellent performances all around, and both the script and direction are full of nice touches that steer away from clichs (again, especially as the film goes along).  Worth making an effort to see.",1460592000,2,1176,4.328767123287672

346194,4,6301704754,"This is one of the most original movies I've ever seen.  Quirky and unpredictable, the film scores on all fronts but one.  Jessica Lange as Beth McCauley is remarkably fragile as the recently-widowed mother of two sons who must sell her house and car and relocate to Baltimore after her husband's untimely death.  Unqualified to do work that would pay her much money, she must fend for herself in a gourmet deli owned by arrogant divorcee, Kathy Bates.  Later, she meets a musician (Arliss Howard) who specializes in making noises with his typewriter/eggbeater/angelic voices 'band,' and she struggles with the notion of any kind of new relationship.  As much as I like the acting and casting of this film, I am troubled by the concept of the older X-ray technician, Jody, played by Joan Cusack, who literally seduces the underage Chris O'Donnell.  When Beth objects to his spending all his time in her apartment and tries to clamp down on their affair, the film seems to go out of its way to depict her as being uptight and uncooperative.  My question is this: would the film be this casual about an older man seducing an underage teenaged girl?  In fact, I know that entire concept would be distasteful in today's feminist climate.  This aspect of the film detracts from what is otherwise an imaginative take on an American nuclear family falling apart at the seams.",1332374400,2,1368,4.787234042553192
346195,5,6301704754,"This is a movie about a woman (Jessica Lange) and her two sons, ages 17 and 9, played by Chris O'Donnell and Charlie Korsmo, respectively. When Lange's character loses her husband in an accident, she is forced to move, with her two sons, to a cheaper place in inner-city Baltimore. All three members of the family are trying to grieve and cope in their own way with this tragedy, though not always successfully. (For instance, at the funeral, someone tells Korsmo's character that it's okay to cry. The boy replies coldly, ""No, I'm not going to cry."") Ironically, at a time when they all need each other the most, they end up becoming more separated through their own poor decisions, bad judgment, and their sheer confusion over what is the best thing to do. At times, this movie was funny, such as in some of the wacky scenes with a neighbor, played by Joan Cusack. And don't miss the great turn by Kathy Bates as Lange's boss. At other times, the film was just downright heartbreaking, as in the scene with O'Donnell on the dock with Arliss Howard, and for me, the scene near the end with Lange and Charlie Korsmo (a truly brilliant actor), at their old home where Korsmo had run away to. In my view, this is a truly great film. Executive producer and director Paul Brickman has fashioned a real gem in ""Men Don't Leave"". This is a masterpiece that will stand the test of time, because the situation is timeless and human emotion is eternal. Finally, I think it is a travesty that such a brilliant film did not get a DVD release (although the Warner Archive Collection has made the film available in a DVD-R version). I highly recommend this film. Watch it and judge for yourself.",1316304000,7,1682,4.554455445544554
346196,4,6301704754,"There is an intimacy in `Men Don't Leave' that caught me off-guard and certainly made the film more palatable; that and the beautiful performance by Jessica Lange.  The film itself has no real surprise thrown in, for it mostly plays out rather predictably and uneventfully, unless you count that ridiculous yet somewhat wholly believable plot line involving Chris O'Donnell's affair with Joan Cusack (I love it when she pops up in a movie).

No, `Men Don't Leave' is a rather small glimpse in at the life of a recently widowed woman raising two boys.  With little money to her name, she moves to Baltimore where her depression makes adjustment difficult and ultimately threatens the fabric of her family.  Couple that with the budding hormonal difficulties brought on by her eldest son (O'Donnell in his big screen debut) and the advances of a man who seems like a perfect fit and you have a tough time to be had by an emotionally vulnerable woman.

Lange totally makes this film hers and she owns every frame.  She is such a talented actress, and this may be one of her finest moments; such tenderness and emotional conveyance in small moments.  That is something I really respected about this film, for as much as it doesn't `go a lot of places' it manages to feel sincere and earnest; something that a lot of films fail to capture.  There is a scene with O'Donnell and Arliss Howard where your heart begins to break over the amount of raw honesty projected; so open and naked and vulnerable.  Director Paul Brickman uses a deft hand at creating an intimate feeling that permeates the film, even when certain moments begin to fray.  Lange, Cusack, Howard, O'Donnell (his first and best performance, by miles) and Bates lend memorable and commendable performances and help make `Men Don't Leave' an underappreciated must-see film that very few have seen.

This is a wonderful film about how a family adapts to brutal upheaval:  after the sudden death of the father, his family is left without resources and is forced into a lower class, moving from the suburbs to a gritty city.  The mother, who is played with extraordinary sensitivity by Lange, watches as she begins to lose control of her children; she feels responsible and tries to handle things on her own, but feels she is failing.  The youngest boy gets into petty crime with a worthless friends, while his older brother begins an affair with an older neighbor.  I was astonished to witness Lange as her life and self-image descended into chaos as she tried so hard to cope, to make enough money, to become tougher, and to keep her family together.  In perhaps her best film performance, Lange is completely believable as she heads toward a nervous breakdown.  In the end, they all adapt and to a certain extent, grow and reach a new place.  Kathy Bates, as the tough and occasionally mean shop owner, is also excellent, as is Joan Cusack (a lucky find as a natural caregiver), and O'Donnell in his first major role.

I think that this is particularly relevant now, in these troubled economic times.  Just about any of us could end up in this place.

346218,5,6301704754,"This film was extremely emotional for me because I lost my father when I was 4 years old.  Although I don't remember him very well, I went through the same emotions that Matt went through in the film. It was as if the writer knew exactly what I went through.
My mother was also depressed and my goal in life was to make her happy so I hid my emotions.  I tried everything in the world to make my mother happy, not thinking about myself.
I too wondered if my father knew what I was doing.  And I too wanted to know when the pain would stop.
It has gotten better now that I have a 6 year old son, but when I see how attached he is to me, I feel sad thinking about what I went through.
God has blessed me with a beautiful family now so I am greatful for that.
This is one of my all time favorite films.  The acting, the music, emotions.
It was very emotional for me to watch and I have it in my collection as one of my favorite films.

All of the characters are dealing with difficulties in their lives and find a connection with each other that is so endearing. Each is acted superbly by Arliss Howard (divorced father), Kathy Bates (angry business owner), and a bittersweet performance by Joan Cusack as a lonely x-ray technician - What a cast! Chris O'Donnell as the older son does a great job in one of his earliest roles. This movie also has a superb music score by Thomas Newman that really adds to the atmosphere of this film.

346222,5,6301704754,"This has to be Jessica Lange's greatest performance of all her great films. She portrays the shattered widow so believably, a woman that picks up and moves her and her two sons from small town life to Baltimore after her husbands sudden death. While her son's are trying to adapt and pick up the pieces with their new lives, she tries to fight off her depression with her frantic late night baking and constant daytime sleeping. Charlie Korsmo is heartbreaking as the sensitive younger son trying desperately to bring his Mom back to life. Arliss Howard plays the sweet musician that comes into her life quite by accident. Joan Cusack is great as the ditsy nurse that seduces the elder son, and Kathy Bates has a small part as the abrasive boss, for which she is at her usual best. I couldn't recommend this movie more, and make sure you have your hanky ready. I agree with the rest of the reviewers, when will this film be available on DVD???",1156809600,14,943,4.552941176470588

The power of saying goodbye and getting your life back.  This is one of Jessica's best films, my #1 film that she did will always be ""Sweet Dreams"", followed by ""Frances""

The only other actress besides Jessica that can portray complex characters in a sea of emotions would be Meryl, it's sad that so many of Jessicas films are underseen by many people.  That is also why I respect her, she chooses the roles for acting not the big bucks!  I love you Jessica!!!!

346224,3,6301704754,"Jessica Lange is often applauded for her acting in this film, and it is work of art from that perspective. What is disturbing about the film is its message to the viewer. When you pick up the film you get the feeling that you are going to watch a warm, humorous and moving film that will portray the strength of a mother and will exalt the place of the family in society.  However, this film's definition of the family is anything but traditional. Lange plays the part of Beth, a wife and mother who takes her role in life seriously and gives herself fully to her family. What is odd about this film is how all the characters in the film set out to ""help"" Beth change her mind about what a mother and family should be. She is depicted as way too uptight when she protests the advances of Charles, a married man separated from his wife, and also when Jody, a twenty-something oddball of a radiologist lures Beth's high-school son to move in with her (an idea that Charles supports as ""not a bad idea""). Jody is appalled at Beth's uncourteous manner when she protests Jody's preying on young boys, and Jody assures Beth that she's really a good woman who only wants to ""help"" her.  Beth goes through a number of traumatic situations, and through it all, the characters around her eagerly pursue their mission of liberating Beth from her traditional hangups. Interestingly, Beth is about the only truly altruistic person in the film. With the exception of her youngest son, the other characters are all motivated by what will ultimately serve their own immediate wants. I find the story line and the message of this film very narcissitic and self-serving. The message is clear: ""Ligthen up; take what you want when you want it, let others do the same and we'll all end up happy.""",1144713600,3,1776,4.564263322884012

7813966,5,6301704754,"This sweet, funny, and poignant film, directed by Peter Brickman, is the  story of Beth McCauley (the incomparable Jessica Lange at her finest) and her two  young sons, Matty  (a remarkable Charlie Korsmo) and Chris (Chris ODonnell, in his auspicious screen debut) having to redefine their family dynamic and learn to survive after the sudden death Beths beloved husband (Tom Mason).  They leave their familiar hometown and move to the big city of Baltimore so that Beth can find work to support the family.  Matty, along with his slightly shady pal Winston, plot to help Beth get the family home back.  And Chris becomes overprotective of his mom and tries to thwart the budding romance that starts to bloom between her and Charles (the brilliant Arliss Howard), a quirky musician who starts to help Beth out of her depression.  Chris also, much to Beths displeasure, moves in with Jody (the hilarious and touching Joan Cusack) a kooky nurse who lives in their apartment building.  It also features Kathy Bates, in a scene-stealing turn as Lisa, Beths new boss who is a bitter divorcee.  But the real meat of the story is watching Jessica Lange masterfully take us on a complicated journey of a woman who loses her love and is forced to fend for herself, keep her family together, and find a new purpose for her life.  Lange was nominated for an Oscar that year for The Music Box, but most critics agree the nomination was  for her sublime work in Men Dont Leave as well",1515628800,,1471,4.70703125

7813970,4,6301704754,"Released in early 1990 and directed by Paul Brickman, Men Dont Leave is a drama with comedic elements about a mother (Jessica Lange) and two sons who lose their husband/father and must move to Baltimore to make it and overcome their grief. Chris O'Donnell plays the teenage son while Joan Cusack appears as his older girlfriend, an x-ray technician. Arliss Howard is on hand as a potential beau for the mother, a musician. Kathy Bates plays her new boss, the manager of a gourmet bakery.

This movies tragic, odd, dramatic, funny and inspirational, just like life. It respects the intelligence of the viewer as everythings not always spelled out. Roger Ebert complained about the predictability of the mothers meet-cute with the musician, which may be true, but he overlooked the many UNpredictable and offbeat elements of the movie, like the teens relationship with the medical technician and her interesting relationship arc with the mother.

He also complained about the films depiction of clinical depression and its supposedly trite antidote, but  speaking as someone who suffered severe depression in the past; and overcame it without meds  this simply isn't true. Both the depiction and the remedy are real-to-life; the portrayal is sad with some realistic humor and inspiration thrown into the mix. What did he want? Her to take a pill and everything would be hunky-dory? The best thing for a person whos suffering depression is to get them out of the darkness of the bedroom and into the light of day; get them talking; give them something active to DO; and help them set some realistic goals that they can immediately start working toward, not to mention encourage some close, positive relationships, and discourage negative ones. The movie effectively shows this.

The film runs 115 minutes and was shot in Baltimore, Maryland, and Illinois & Michigan Canal National Heritage Corridor, Illinois.
