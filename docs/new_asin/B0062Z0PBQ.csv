This, in my opinion, presents the real deal.
Very happy.",1482019200,,110,4.285714285714286
8491600,5,B0062Z0PBQ,I understand there are several (??) videos out on Calder but maybe to good fortune or luck I happened to choose this in hopes that it would be worthy of the subject.  It was.,1444521600,2,174,4.117647058823529

8491602,5,B0062Z0PBQ,This is a lively little documentary about Alexander Calder; it is clear & easy to understand. We used this with a group of older adult learners who wrote about Calder's art after studying about him. The project was quite successful!,1396828800,,232,4.825

8491605,5,B0062Z0PBQ,"I gave this Calder DVD this title because it is a French production. Indeed, the French seem to have appreciated Calder more than we have in his own birthplace of America. This film, which lasts only, unfortunately, a brief fifty-one minutes, is quite good as it shows some scenes of Calder's famous toy Circus, modeled after the ones performed with human beings in early twentieth-century Paris, some 1920s-30s films of his wire sculptures, some 1940s-50s films of his kinetic art and mobiles, some of his gigantic stabiles from the 1960s-70s, which grace the open spaces of many modern buildings and open country spaces, and lastly of his home and workshop in Connecticut. All in all, for fifty-one minutes, this DVD is an entertaining eye piece, or should I say ""eye candy""? Calder's unique art and manufacturing style and technique are also exhibited in this interesting film for all ages and the young at heart. Dare I may ask, regrettably, where another film/documentary of Alexander (Sandy) Calder is to be found? The French have done him an honor with this film. It was well-produced, as only the French can do for someone whom they have seemingly loved so well. It is a visual treat to see this unique artist's sculptures in action. Many resident Parisian artists and intellectuals of his time, from Marcel Duchamp, Piet Mondrian, Joao Mir, and even the composer Edgard Varse, seem to find their apotheosis in the work of this American, Alexander Calder. The film is a visual sight and even auditory sound spectacle for all!",1374364800,9,1533,4.922779922779923
8491606,5,B0062Z0PBQ,Used this video to teach about 3-D design in art class.  Students appreciated the explanations and views of Calder's works.,1370304000,3,123,5.15
8491607,5,B0062Z0PBQ,I used this video to teach a class. This a very good video that shows a lot of Calder's kinetic and stable sculptures.,1363996800,4,118,4.173913043478261
