Once again do NOT read the description of the movie on the box...it gives way too much away...just let it happen. and the movie is so transfixing I forgot to even read the box afterwards...until I started this review.

This movie started out incredibly dark. I thought... Oh gosh what the heck is this!?...
It started out with total shades of Nazi Germany... Then it turned into a... comedy?...what!?!
There is no logical way the people in the movie could support the villian yet no logic is apparently nessesary. This is really a crazy movie with fascinating dream/mind of man sequences that are hillarious or just weird... take your pick! (Now I know where fruit of the loom got it's ideas!)It even had some pretty good special effects for the time.
Then the movies gets dark and desperate, then it gets silly...and when you think the movie is about to end it goes onto another bit of sillyness. But it was funny and yet it was typical Fairbanks fare.
  Some might critisize it wacko illogicalness, but hey it was fun to watch, in fact so Fun I completely missed the music. I guess it must have fit the movie because I can't even recall it.

It's 68 minutes so a pretty full length movie for the time (1919) this is a must see. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 stars was it didn't have that Classicness, one might give say a Chaplin City Lights, but it's a five star wacky film for sure. All that and the inimitatable Douglas Fairbanks. A definite must have for silent collectors and even for non silent fans.",1331596800,,1573,4.466898954703833
