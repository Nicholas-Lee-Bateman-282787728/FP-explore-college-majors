2270775,4,B0009941E8,"It was a good view, but I don't think I learned anything that I didn't already know! Being a history lover and having a grandfather who was there for the liberation of Auschwitz/Birkenau, I'm thinking I may have seen more photographs that were never printed or published anywhere else. Having said that, I have to say it was worth the money for an exemplary overview of WWII. Thank You! Doug",1124668800,2,391,4.6
2270776,5,B0009941E8,"This BBC series is just what you need to understand the reason, why WW2 is the pivotal point of the 20 century. With the chapter on the Nazi you understand, why democraies can't sit and negotiate with tyrants. On the battle for Arhnem you can see how a small desicion not to take the city changed the future of post WW2 Europe and the Cold War. The Chapters on the concentration camps gave an understanding of the horror of a nation gone insane. And the unrepentence of those who perptrated the horror",1124668800,3,501,4.456521739130435
2270777,5,B0009941E8,"One of the finest things ever to grace the dvd format.

If you are looking for the ultimate WWII COLLECTION then you have found it.

An earlier review makes refrence to it being heavy on the British footage.

That is because THE BBC is BRITISH.

If ABC would have put this together then trust me you wouldnt see a Brit in sight.

As for Stanley Dalton Jnr who ripped into Monty.

Let me remind you that because your President didn't listen to the much wiser smarter Churchill then Russia was given free reign and despite many warnings from Churchill' they raped and tortured millions of Germans.

Monty was a WWII Hero and did what needed to be done.

If you really were a WWII student STANLEY you would never go on a dvd review site' and start slamming people who helped save the world from speaking GERMAN.",1124150400,7,808,4.448979591836735

2270779,5,B0009941E8,Got this for xmas 2015. What a great series. You don't have to watch in Ord since they are actually separate documentaries. Very well done. I've read many WWII books so it was easy enough to follow. The DVD's on the Holocaust are very disturbing. I really liked the Japan section showing how they felt the West was responsible for what happened. Interesting. There is a lot of information on these discs. It can easily be watched over and over again. Very well done.,1459382400,,466,4.559523809523809

It is exceptionally well done....very hard to watch sections on Nazi treatment of Jews, this is news footage from the time not a movie. I believe Americans should watch this to really grasp the scope of the events that led to the war. Understanding the political posturing of that time offers insights to many of today's events. The US still views itself as protected by oceans as we did in the 1930s. This series would be an eye opener for many.",1457222400,,526,4.489583333333333
2270781,5,B0009941E8,The series is wonderful and deserves a 5 star rating - repackage misses out on the booklet that might have gone with the original? Well at least it seems like it should have had a booklet with info and overview? Repackaging is more compact and fits more easily on the shelf - most likely more organized and accessible? I do not have previous packaging to compare anything to so I am not too sure if this is a fair rating for packaging - the only reason I give this less than a 5 star rating for packing is because I do not know if a possible booklet is missing? Love being able to see things with BBC documentation and early events before US involvement - great resource to go with history books and other documentation,1456790400,,719,4.333333333333333

I am french and my grandfather was in Paris when the Germans invaded the city, and I wish there was something about that...

2270807,4,B0009941E8,"This set is a collection of BBC programs, aired over a span of years.  Different directors, narrators, and approaches to story-telling mean that it is not a single integrated history.  Perhaps it's best to back it up with a reading of, say, Anthony Beevor's book on the History of WWII.  Doing so adds searing images from archive footage as well as reconstructions that fix the history in ones mind.  I wish every high school student in the world, especially in Europe and the USA, would have the experience of being taken through this series with the aid of a knowledgeable teacher to fill in supporting detail.

2270821,5,B0009941E8,"This is my second favorite WW2 documentary box set (The World At War , 30th Anniversary has a slight edge due to more-complete-even-coverage). Being from The BBC it is , by its nature , strongly oriented to the British perspective. That's not a major fault because there are several discs that are worth the price of this set. I do have mixed feeling for the docudrama story telling style of some episodes.

The Nazis A Warning From History and Auschwitz: The Nazis and 'The Final Solution' are each 2 disc sets that give details I never saw from another documentary. These are worth the price of the box set. Fascinating and horrifying at the same time. They have interviews with several people who were directly involved with the events and give a perspective needed to grasp what happened (or at least try to grasp).

I did hope for more than just the one disc covering what Russia went through in The War of the Century: When Hitler Fought Stalin as they bore the brunt of Hitler's war. A well done episode  I just wish there were more to it because the war was really won on the Russian East front.

Japan's story is Horror in the East , very well done , but it should have been longer than one disc.

Dunkirk gets a nice docudrama touch but it gets a whole disc to tell the story , too much of one story for a single episode. It was a major point in the war for the British but , arguably , less so for the war in its entirety.

Battle of the Atlantic gives good coverage to what allowed England to stay alive and the U.S.A. to transport the materials and manpower to fight in Europe.

The Road to War , Battlefields , D-Day 6.6.1944 and D-Day to Berlin are all good and should be seen.

My criticisms are minor. I wish they had voice-overs for the interviews of non-English speakers. Instead there are captions to read and it keeps you from seeing into the persons face to gage their emotions. As stated before there is too little coverage of Japan and Russia , a minor point to some but 12 discs for this set and only 2 for them.

I hope that someone gets us better coverage of what happened in the Russian East front. With the passage of time there are fewer people alive to give us an eyewitness story. History is too important to forget.",1389744000,,2248,4.3460620525059666

Even in episodes where Americans were the main side of the war against Nazism, the series dwelt for so long on British soldiers and on what Montgomery had to say. Be careful, it is not a documentary on WWII, but a showcase of the British role. And even there it is not honest, and comes across as BBC propaganda.

The blending of actual footage with re-enactments of historical events was very smooth and kept the story going without a hitch. I was riveted by the interviews with people who were there. Getting the British point of view and the coverage of events in which the British armed forces played major roles was very enlightening.

I thought I was knowledgeable about the events covered but I learned quite a bit more in viewing the DVDs. As the co-President of the Holocaust Museum & Study Center in Spring Valley, New York, I am recommending this series to our Education Director so that sections may be utilized in furthering our educational mission.",1261526400,8,778,4.720588235294118
2270834,3,B0009941E8,"Docu-drama sums up a lot of this series.  I watched the two DVDs on Auschiwitz.  The BBC felt the need to dress up some apparent Germans in Nazi uniforms to recreate certain events.  One specific example was an escape from Auschwitz.  They actually recreating the majority of the breakout -- right down to the guard tower which let the escapees go free.

While such antics might be needed for today's youth and those without an imagination, they seem like cheap stunts to me.  The stunts ruined the series for me.

To be fair, there are some slightly interesting bits.  One example is how the producers recreate other concentration camps from blueprints.  It is all computer-created, but still, seeing the camps as they were built during WWII is chilling.  Being able to walk through a virtual gas chamber then from the chambers to the ovens is heart-wrenching.

The docu-drama dress-up antics detract from an otherwise interesting series.  There are other, higher quality documentaries out there which don't insult a viewer's intelligence.",1248652800,5,1040,5.052941176470588

Professor Holmes, who never saw a battlefield except from a safe distance, does NOT interview anyone to defend the actions of either General Clark or General John Lucas.

In the chapter on ""Bomber"", Professor Holmes presents only the story of British aircraft bombing Germany and completely excludes any mention of the US Air Force. In the chapter on ""Alamein"", there is no mention of the 400 tanks President Roosevelt and General Marshall sent the British Army. After listening to Holmes, you would think the British won WWII by themselves.",1200096000,22,733,5.318965517241379
2270839,5,B0009941E8,"They say that war histories are usually written by the victors not long after the event. Thus, earlier  documentary histories of World War II failed to  give much balance for telling the story from the viewpoint of the  ultimately defeated Axis powers, though the first successful  attempt was in the excellent German TV series made into  a movie, Das Boot, based on the last voyage of a  U-Boat submarine and its crew.

Also the further  away in time one gets from the actual series of  events that make up World War II the more perspective one gets on it. Hence for at least the first half of the nineteenth century  Napoleon I was viewed  as every bit of a villain and disturber of the international  peace as Hitler has been seen during the second half of the twentieth century. That is not to say that this fairly new box set on World War II puts any unnecessary gloss on Hitler or the Nazis but it does attempt to explain who they were and where  they  were coming from, how they got elected to power and why they  were greatly supported -up to 1943  at least- by the majority of German and Austrian people.

Yet one never is free of contemporary fashions regarding  a particular period of time in history. The viewpoints  subtly, and sometimes not so subtly, hidden in these documentaries  reflect the  early 21st century's  mistrust of wars as a solution in human conflict. Thus,  the BBC documentary  focuses  much more than usual on the seemingly inevitable  bloodiness and inhumanity of war, with atrocities committed by all sides, although  the Nazis and Japanese still seem to be the worst, but not the only offenders. German guards are seen  executing French  resistance  members  even with  allies only three miles away. In the episode  on the wars in the Far East  a US marine  veteran  over fifty year later is  explaining how, and why, they routinely shot Japanese soldiers even while they were surrendering. The  American soldiers regarded Japanese as subhuman just as the Nazi troops viewed the Russians. Russian and German  civilian survivors relate how their women were raped and murdered by either side almost as a matter of routine.  A whole episode  is shown of the allied bombing of  Germany and the dreadful and deliberate slaughter from 20,000  above of civilians under Bomber Harris.  The episode covering the D-Day invasion is particularly  graphic and  vividly coloured, showing blood and guts galore after  firing  of machine guns or shelling, the like of which is not show  at all in the famous  black and white film of the event, The Longest Day. The  moral seems to be that war brutalises almost  everyone involved.

The series is  presented roughly chronologically  but is more analytical than usual  in war documentaries and necessarily selective despite the 30 hours at the producers' disposal. Being a British  documentary  it naturally focuses much more on British units than on their American allies, for example. In many episodes , particularly those covering the German  invasion of Soviet Russia and the subsequent  reversal of fortune after Stalingrad, there are  reels of vintage footage spliced with  modern interviews with  military and civilian  survivors  on all sides. The episodes on the successful retreat from  Dunkirk interestingly enough  rely on a complete and very convincing  dramatisation of events  as seen  by different battle units  and  by high command control in Whitehall.  This approach is loosely followed in the D-Day diskette. In the Dunkirk and D-Day diskettes  actual footage is skilfully interwoven with the dramatisation.  Personally I found this  box series produced between 2000 and 2004  one of the most enlightening and interesting drama documentaries on the subject that I have seen in my  own 66 years.",1195603200,5,3782,4.9375

2270848,3,B0009941E8,"This series-compilation fills in a few of the gaps in the World at War series, but is no World at War which is arguably the best commercial review of WWII.

Part of the reason the World at War is so compelling  is it's historical footage and accuracy which is UNTAINTED by modernist views.

The BBC history of WWII has a perceivable anti-war slant which doesn't belong in a historical accounting. the World at War is NOT pro-war mind you but simply relates what happened during the War.

If you want a good, comprehensive, accurate accounting of WWII from both the Allies side and the Axis side (and civilian side as well) run, don't walk, and purchase World at War.

if your simply looking for more information to fill out your library, you could do worse than this compilation, but you certainly could do better as well.",1149638400,28,822,4.602739726027397
2270849,4,B0009941E8,"A remarkably deep and penetrating analysis of a war that changed the world forever has come to us from the BBC, and I must confess that I am impressed by the scope of this production.

With commentary provided by noted Hitler biographer, Ian Kershaw, and other noteworthy eyewitness accounts and featurettes, these all raise The BBC History of WWII to the status of near-epic. Comparisons to the World At War, I'm afraid, are not really applicable here. World At War was meant to be a comprehensive examination of WWII from A to Z (Autobahn to Zeitgeist?), this series offers a more analytical examination of specific issues and their far-reaching consequences on the war and the players involved--not a battle by battle account of the war.  ""The Nazis: A Warning From History"" is a case in point.  In depth interviews reveal German psyche and attitudes towards Hitler and the Nazi party in the early days of the Reich; for some, joining the Party was the ""thing to do"" and for others, Hitler was the answer to restoring German prestige in a time when most of Europe was reeling from the physical and economic devastation of WWI. All fascinating stuff that goes beyond the scope of battlefield's winners and losers and bodycounts.

In my opinion, the installments on Nazi Germany and Auschwitz are worth the price for this magnificant collection of over 30 hours of programming. Anyone who has World At War would do well to purchase this set as well since this offers an up front and detailed look at a war that still haunts us today. Some of the re-enactments utlilizing actors, especially those of the Battle of Dunkirk, are questionable, but do not really detract from the overall quality of this set.

My grandfather served with the Alpine Division in the Italian Army before he emigrated to the Bay Area in the late '30's, so the installment on Italy's involvement in the war was of particular interest and well-handled by the BBC team. Some great footage was preserved and included in this set.

But why only four stars? Well, to echo the claims of the other reviewers, the war against Japan gets little coverage confined to the one disc ""Horror in the East,"" but don't let that keep you from purchasing and enjoying this series.",1148688000,13,2235,4.77720207253886

One example of this is an ""economics expert"" claiming that the public works projects in Germany had no effect in alleviating the depression.  These seemed to work when done by other countries.

Every once in a while there is something of importance that is not in the usual history books.  One example is the error-free leader of a major spiritual group based in Rome publicly praising Mussolini for invading Ethiopia.",1139443200,9,652,5.046728971962617

2270852,3,B0009941E8,"This is NOT a history of WWII. Rather, a skillful compilation of BBC documentaries about WWII released over the past few years , of varied relevance and inconsistent quality, which internal redundancies show not to have been originally designed to hang together as a whole. In addition, the military perspective is almost exclusively British (at times tendentiously so), hence narrow to a point perilously close to offensive neglect. If one is looking for a DVD overview of WWII, go to ""The World at War,"" amazingly remaining the primer after all these years, even if its relative disregard of the Eastern European front, though emblematic of its time, remains problematic.

Nonetheless, having raised appropriate general caveats, there is much that is interesting and well executed in this elegant package.  Taking each documentary in turn,

The Nazis - A Warning from History: Together with the final documentary on Auschwitz, the best the set has to offer. The exposition is clear and as thorough as one can expect from the medium. The footage is well rendered, a significant lot of it fresh to me.

The Road to War: Episodes detailing the political background leading to the War in Britain, Italy, Japan and the USA.  All of it is quite good, but the one glaring omission is France. Considering that in 1939 France's was the most powerful Allied army (Britain's strength was its fleet), the rapid fall of France was not only a disaster but a puzzle, Vichy's initiative of ""collaboration"" a disgrace. Both can only be understood in context with France's internicine pre-war politics, the most conflicted of European democracies, an understanding of which is essential to an appreciation of Nazi Germany's initial diplomatic and military successes. This omission is a serious flaw.

Dunkirk: This retreat and rescue gets a full DVD.  It relies heavily on play-acting, docu-drama type film, depicting leaders and grunts, which in neither case is interesting nor convincing.  The May 1940 cabinet dilemma in London is played out as drama with actors portraying Churchill, Halifax, Chamberlain et al. It sinks lower from docu- to melo- with scenes portraying ""Everyman"" Brits protecting the rear or fleeing Germans, even being massacred. This is truly history not only ""lite"" but ludicrous and boring.

War of the Century: Hitler's attack on and eventual rout by the Soviets. Probably as much or more than we get elsewhere about the war in the East. Kursk, the largest tank battle ever fought, at around 4 million men one of the most significant engagements of the war, and, arguably, the beginning of the end for Hitler, is not analyzed, indeed perhaps not even mentioned.

Horror in the East: Mostly centers on Japan's actions in mainland Asia and its impact on British troops there. The American island war in the Pacific takes a back seat, though Okinawa is covered. Midway is not mentioned though it terminated Japan as a naval power. The emphasis is not on the war's progress but on Japanese cruelty. Some of this DVD is redundant with prior analysis of Japan.

Battlefields: Provides analysis of El Alamein, Casino, Arnhem (remember ""A Bridge Too Far""?) and the Allied bomber offensive. Mostly interesting though Arnhem analysis engages in wishful ""what-if"" thinking of what proved to be an ill-conceived, botched operation which soiled Montgomery's glory earned so splendidly at El Alamein. As for the bomber offensive over Germany, USAF participation is hardly covered.

D-Day: well done, though it also relies a lot on ""docu-drama"" as if one hadn't seen much better stuff at the movies. It's important to note that the largest national contingents of troops who carried out Operation Neptune, the initial Normandy landings of Operation Overlord, were British and Canadian. The British slant of this episode is welcomed.

D-Day to Berlin: rushes the war in Europe to a conclusion, spending an inordinate amount of time on Montgomery's squabbles with Eisenhower (history showed Ike to be invariably correct, though one wouldn't guess it from the rather tendentious narration).

Auschwitz - Inside the Nazi State: 2 superb DVD's, with masterful narration by Linda Hunt. Unbeknownst to us at the time, the moral epicenter of the answer as to why we fought. This documentary explains all aspects of Auschwitz, moral, political, mechanical, indeed technocratic.

The documentaries benefit from participation by surviving participants on all sides of the conflict.

Thus this is indeed a mixed bag of a collection. Documentaries supplement but do not substitute good books, and perhaps no single volume WWII history is more thorough, better structured, more balanced, and readable than ""A World at Arms"" by Gerhard Weinberg.  For documentaries, first choice, as mentioned above, remains ""A World at War."" For docu-dramas, indeed perhaps the greatest ""war movie"" ever made, I suggest ""Band of Brothers.""  This BBC compilation is worthwhile for some of its components; in no way is the whole greater than the sum of its parts.

ADDENDUM:

Since I wrote the review above (my gosh, almost seven years ago to the day!) there are two points I'd like to add, and a third I'd like to re-emphasize, while continuing to agree with what I previously wrote:
1/ ""The Road to War"" volume seems even more fatally flawed than before by the exclusion of France in the 1930's.
2/ This BBC product understandably focuses on British participation, the western European front and its ancillary theatres, notwithstanding select forays into the Pacific. But regarding the European war, the major flaw, indeed damning flaw, of this and the superior ""The World at War,"" is the failure to acknowledge that Germany was defeated primarily by the Soviets. Most of the Wehrmacht was deployed to acquire ""lebensraum"" in the East, thus fight the Soviet Union. It was Soviet might, heroism, ruthlessness that crushed the Nazis. The great and heroic Allied actions in Normandy, the Battle of the Bulge, the long slug up the Italian peninsula were all ultimately designed to prevent Germany from re-deploying forces to the Eastern Front, where the massive, decisive battles and the inexorable march to Berlin had been taking place for the past several years. Cold War propaganda distorted the teaching of history, at least in American schools; several American generations were taught WWII barely discussing Soviet participation, their ""Great Patriotic War"" as the Soviets referred to it. Such failure encompassed the neglect to describe the immense suffering and ruin that took place in Soviet territory as a result of being the only theatre being continuously active since the inception of Barbarossa in 1941. One would hope that by today the teaching of history has changed. The Pacific war and its victory was almost exclusively an American domain. The BBC documentary still feels very perfunctory in its treatment of American painful island-to-island combat on its route to Japan.
3/ With regard to one volume histories of World War II, a new worthy companion to Gerhard Weinberg's has appeared just this year:The Second World War Anthony Beevor's ""The Second World War.""",1131148800,100,7143,5.173310225303293
2270853,5,B0009941E8,"The BBC once again shows why they are the best in the making of documentaries.  I watched several of my discs already and am hooked to them.  The BBC gives you the most extensive look ever at the war and the people who lived through it.  They talk to former Nazis, government officials, soliders, and victims and show films not seen before.  I do not agree with the people who say ""The World at War"" is the more superior series.  That series was made 30+ years ago and did not have many of the resources available to it that the BBC had for the making of this series.  You need to remember, many films and documents were not released until after the end of the cold war and you will see them in this series.  Not to take anything from ""The World at War"" which is an excellent series for the time it was made, but watching it on TV I didn't really learn anything from it where in the BBC series, I have already learned a lot just from the 4 disks I have watched.  If you are a war buff like I am, you will want to consider this set for your library.  You do need to shop around before you buy though, because the price for this series varies widely around the internet.",1127433600,14,1168,4.132743362831858
2270854,4,B0009941E8,"The contents of this boxed set are up to the usual high standards of the BBC. It should be noted that it was not conceived as a single integrated documentary series. It is actually a collection of separate, unrelated series (10 series in all) produced by the BBC over a span of some 16 years from 1989 to 2005. There is no common thread between them except that they all relate to WWII. Those wanting a straightforward, integrated account of the War would do better to look at the multi-award winning 1975 ""World at War"" series. Nonetheless, the various series gathered here are superb in themselves and have individually garnered a plethora of awards. It is just that they were not meant to be cobbled together as a set and thus, taken together, serve more as a collection of excellent individual documentaries than a comprehensive history of the Second World War.

The BBC set presupposes a basic knowledge of the war on the part of the viewer. It does not cover all aspects of the conflict. In fact large parts of the war are left out. But what it does touch on, it does so in greater depth than ever before. The finest parts here are the documentaries on the Nazis, the Final Solution and the Russo-German war. The two separate series on the Nazis, one examining their rise to power and the other on the Final Solution rank among the finest documentaries to have been made on those subjects. The collection also benefits from its more recent production date, with greater access to film and documentary archives from the former Eastern bloc.

The emphasis of the set is definitely Euro-centric. Some events are touched on at great length while others get hardly a mention. This is the result of it being an ad-hoc collection of unrelated series. An astonishing three hours are devoted to the evacuation from Dunkirk. There is then no account of the subsequent Battle of Britain and only passing mention of the London Blitz. The stunning victories achieved by the Germans in the early months of the war are given rather short shrift. So to is the revolutionary form of warfare that helped them achieve this, the Blitzkrieg. While the Holocaust was one of the most abominable crimes of the 20th century, devoting 5 hours to it in ""Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State"", plus even more in ""The Nazis: A Warning From History,"" meant that the Holocaust accounts for over 1/4 of the entire set. In contrast, the entire Asia-Pacific war is relegated to a mere 90 minutes. And the focus of those 90 minutes is not actually on a chronology of the Asia-Pacific war but on the reasons behind the Japanese Army's transformation from the humane, ""civilised"" army that fought in WWI to the barbarous one that perpetrated so many atrocities in WWII. It makes for one of the most fascinating documentaries in the set but it is not in the end meant as an account of the Asia-Pacific war. The set as a whole is thus very lopsided with an overemphasis on the European theater and especially the Holocaust. The result is that while the individual series are great, they do not add up to a balanced and comprehensive whole. Still it deserves at least four stars for the sheer quality of the individual documentaries. This set will be more suitable for viewers who already have a fairly good grasp of the war and are keen on going deeper into particular topics. It will appeal to those wanting to explore less often tackled subjects, like the above-mentioned transformation of the Japanese Army for instance, or the morality of the allied firebombing of German cities, or the reasons behind the intense brutality shown in the Russo-German war compared to the war in the west. It is definitely more thought provoking than your usual run-of-the-mill war documentary.

As it is such an extensive and disparate collection, it is not possible to write an article discussing the merits and faults of all 10 separate series within the 600 word limit imposed by Amazon. For those interested, more extensive reviews can be found under each individual series which are all available separately. Viewers should note that the four most recent series are in a ""docu-drama"" rather than traditional documentary format. 1) ""Dunkirk,"" 2) ""D-Day: Reflections of Courage,"" 3) ""D-Day To Berlin,"" and 4) ""Auschwitz: Inside The Nazi State,"" are all in docu-drama form. ""Dunkirk"" is a complete dramatization (much like a TV movie), while the other three have a fairly good mix of archive footage, interviews with veterans and re-enactments and thus more closely resemble traditional documentaries. I am not a fan of dramatization. I can see where dramatization has its merits as in showing the discussions within the various High Commands, or internal Nazi meetings (like the Wannsee Conference) where there is no archive footage available, but some of the re-enactments have no real military or historic significance and serve only as drama. Of the 4 docu-dramas, the 2 most successful were ""Auschwitz: Inside The Nazi State"" and ""D-Day To Berlin,"" with just the right mix of archive footage, interviews and the minimum amount of drama. Nonetheless in terms of factual content, both the docu-dramas and the traditional documentaries are excellent.

The following are the contents of the boxed set:
1) ""The Nazis: A Warning From History."" (1997, 6 Episodes, 290mins, 4:3 Fullscreen, 2 Discs)
- On the reasons behind the rise and fall of the Nazis
2) ""The Road To War."" (1989, 4 Episodes, 195mins, 4:3 Fullscreen, 1 Disc)
- On how Britain, Italy, Japan and the USA entered the war
3) ""Dunkirk."" (2004, 3 Episodes, 176mins, 16:9 Anamorphic, 1 Disc)
- On the evacuation from Dunkirk (Drama)
4) ""War of the Century."" (1999, 4 Episodes, 190mins, 4:3 Fullscreen, 1 Disc)
- On the Russo-German war
5) ""Battle Of the Atlantic."" (2002, 3 Episodes, 146mins, 16:9 Anamorphic, 1 Disc)
- On the U-boats and the Atlantic convoys
6) ""Horrors Of The East."" (2000, 2 Episodes, 98mins, 4:3 Fullscreen, 1 Disc)
- On the Japanese Army and the Asia-Pacific war - Supplements on the Indian Army and the Burma War
7) ""Battlefields."" (2001, 4 Episodes, 194mins, 16:9 Anamorphic, 1 Disc)
- On El Alamein, Monte Cassino, Arnhem and RAF Bomber Command (the firebombing of German cities)
8) ""D-Day: Reflections of Courage."" (2004, 2 Episodes, 90mins, 16:9 Anamorphic, 1 Disc)
- On the events surrounding D-Day (Docu-drama)
9) ""D-Day To Berlin."" (2004, 3 Episodes, 150mins, 16:9 Anamorphic, 1 Disc)
- On the breakout from Normandy, Ops Market Garden, the Battle of the Bulge and the German surrender (Docu-drama)
10) ""Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State."" (2005, 6 Episodes, 300mins, 16:9 Anamorphic, 2 Discs)
- On the Nazis' conceptualisation and implementation of the Final Solution (Docu-drama)

Picture quality is very good even in the earliest of the series dating from 1989. The five most recent series all come in 16:9 widescreen with anamorphic enhancement. All in all, the 10 series presented here are excellent. Whether you get them separately or together depends on how many of the individual series interest you and also whether you take to the new docu-drama format that has been the rage with the BBC in recent years. Personally, given a choice of buying them separately, I would avoid ""Dunkirk"" and ""D-Day: Reflections of Courage"". But that's a purely personal preference based on my dislike of dramatization in documentaries. A major consideration for getting the boxed set is its price. If you intend buying 6 or more of the individual documentaries, it would make sense getting the boxed set, as it is some $80 less than getting the series separately ($149 vs $229).",1126915200,264,7607,4.907536907536907

Russian soldiers questioned local villagers to confirm a concentration camp had been there. So the Nazis knew that they were doing something very wrong to try and hide it.
