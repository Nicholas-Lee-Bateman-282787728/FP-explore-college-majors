I opened it to find a crack in the disc, not on the edge or in the center, but in the play surface which rendered it unviewable. Now I have a $29 coaster because  it was 3 days over the return window. I bought the book as well so I'll have to make do.  Do yourself a favor and make sure you check the disc.
