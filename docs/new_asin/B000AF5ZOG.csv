Otherwise, I'm amazed just how juvenile and dopey this series has become over the years.  Zelda Gilroy [Shiela James] is, of course, always watchable.",1496707200,,255,4.906976744186046

Lately with the advent of the Internet, anything in the world now is plausible such as remembering 1 hit wonder songs that I loved as a kid and being able to listen to them again. Dobie Gilis, a very entertaining and philosophical series on relationships is enjoyable to experience and relive The DVD's are excellent, usually the the sound suffers from the old series and I did not encounter this at all.

8078367,5,B000AF5ZOG,"The other reviewers are only talking about the cost of buying a new version not the joy of seeing the programs themselves! My advice, wait for a used version at a reasonable price and you won't have a reason to complain.  These programs are gems of nostalgia especially for baby boomers who grew up watching them.",1178841600,,313,4.589285714285714
8078368,1,B000AF5ZOG,"A great 50's show, perhaps the prototye for ""The 70's Show"", a series with the TV's most beautiful golddigging goddess Thalia Menninger (Tuesday Weld), Maynard G Krebs (""Work!"" Bob Denver, aka Gilligan), clothes-hound Milton Armitage (Warren Beatty), dwarfish Zelda Gilroy (propinquity) and let's not forget the rich Chatsworth Osborne Jr (Family motto ""Never dip into Capital"").

However for $18+ you get only 2 twenty-five minute (without commercials) episodes. Poor quality print.

Poor value for the money.",1175644800,5,510,5.697368421052632
8078369,2,B000AF5ZOG,"SUMMARY:

This is a very funny show, which I have not seen in 30+ years.

I recently bought volume 3.  The good news is the episodes are funny and the quality is fairly good, considering the programs are 45+ years old.  The bad news is there are only TWO episodes on the DVD, which cost $18!  (I knew these weren't 'complete seasons' when I ordered it, but I guess I missed the part about only having 2 episodes.)

DETAILS:

There is a menu where you can select either of the 2 episodes.  The Dobie theme (with lyrics) plays over the menu.

Each episode opens with the Dobie Gillis theme, complete with the 'cartoon Dobie' looking through the knothole in the fence, etc., and has full closing credits.  Of course, each episode includes the quote ""I'm gonna kill that boy"" from Herbert T. Gillis!  Also, Dobie has blonde hair for both episodes.

The episodes on volume 3 are 'The Big Sandwich' and 'The Chicken from Outer Space'.

The Big Sandwich:

Featuring: Dobie, Maynard, Thalia Meninger, Herbert T. Gillis, Mrs. Gillis, Mrs. Gillis' brother, others.

His parents are off to a family reunion, so Dobie has to mind the store on Saturday (fans of the show can easily guess where this is going).  Dobie, Maynard, and Thalia make 400 sandwiches (ingredients charged to his father's store account, naturally) to sell at a school picnic.  Of course, the picnic gets rained out and Dobie's stuck holding the bag on $50 worth of stale sandwiches.  Meanwhile, his father is in (as he put it) ""double-misery"".  He's stuck at his in-laws' family reunion for the weekend, AND he has left Dobie in charge of the store.

The Chicken from Outer Space:

Featuring: Dobie, Maynard, Zelda, Herbert T. Gillis, Mrs. Gillis, others.

(BTW, this has nothing to do with outer space.)  Zelda wants Dobie to have a fighting chance at a future, so she makes Dobie enroll in Biology class, so that eventually, he can become a farmer instead of a bum. Dobie agrees, as long as Maynard enrolls with him. Well, their science project involves injecting chickens with growth hormones and observing the results.  Zelda convinces ""Mother Gillis"" (as she calls her) to let them keep the chickens in the store's basement storeroom.  Zelda tells Mrs. Gillis: ""between you and me, we can salvage Dobie from being a bum"".

Anyway, one day Dobie & Zelda are busy, so it's Maynard's turn to administer the injections.  The instructions say to use 2cc of growth hormone.  He asks Mrs. Gillis ""what does 'c' stand for, like in a recipe?"", to which she says ""cup"".

Need I continue?  Ok, so he injects the chicken with 2 cups of growth hormone, and the next thing you know, Dobie's father is being chased through the store by an 8-foot chicken!

Elsewhere in the episode, Dobie is chatting up a cute new girl (not Thalia) on the park bench.  Zelda shows up with a dossier that includes Dobie's high school transcripts, a penmanship sample, results of his IQ test, and a picture of his father.  After seeing all this, the cute girl scrams, leaving Dobie all to Zelda.  Too funny!

Unfortunately, there are no appearances by Chatsworth Osborne Jr, or quotes of ""WORK!"" from Maynard.

At first I felt ripped off, but the episodes were of good quality picture and sound, one episode (the Chicken) was very funny, the other was ok (thanks to Herbert T. Gillis), and you just can't get Dobie in syndication anymore.

So, all in all, I'm satisfied with the purchase, but won't buy more at this price.",1149292800,15,3453,4.685524126455907
