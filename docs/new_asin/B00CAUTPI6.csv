8579297,5,B00CAUTPI6,A wonderful tribute to such important thinking!,1515715200,,47,5.857142857142857
8579298,5,B00CAUTPI6,"Nora Bateson was twelve years old when her father died. She grew up with him when he was at the height of his understanding and wisdom. It is one thing to read Gregory Bateson's sometimes demanding prose and to gain an intellectual understanding of his theories and ideas. It is quite another thing to live with him for the first twelve years of one's lifeplay with him, explore with him, talk with him, listen to him give lectures, and to be loved and nourished by one of the twentieth century's seminal thinkers. Nora is an embodiment of her father's learning and worldview. Just as Gregory was an embodiment of his father (William Bateson, the esteemed biologist who coined the term ""genetics"") and built on his father's legacy, so too Nora has in her own creative way added to Batsonian thinking and practice. An Ecology of Mind is a beautiful portrait of Gregory that brings vividly to life the essence of his being and ideas. Gregory said something like: most of the world's problems arise because of the difference between the way nature works and the way people think. Nora's film teases out the meaning of this insightful perspective and looks at it from many angles.

The film is, I think, helping many people move towards a revolutionary and sacred epistemology, a way of seeing the world in terms patterns and relationships rather than parts and things. I've watched the film many times and each viewing evokes nuances of meaning I had previously missed or only dimly seen. In the six years since the movie was released on DVD, the world seems to have sunk further into social pathology and environmental degradation. If humanity is to survive the twin bogeys of climate change and nuclear destruction, it is more important and urgent than ever that we begin to think ecologically and inter-contextually, that we take seriously the implications of quantum physics for everyday life and nature, of which we are. As Nora puts it: we must ""remember the future"" . . . or perish.

Fortunately, there are signs that we humans are beginning to question our most unquestioned, taken-for-granted assumptions about knowledge, living, economics, politics, education, health, and so on.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Are-We-Smart-Enough-to-Know-How-Smart-Animals-Are/dp/0393353664/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are?</a>&nbsp;is Frans de Wall's question that dives to the heart of the patterns that connect all living things. Good work is happening on the margins, here, there and everywhere.

It is time to transform.",1510358400,3,3049,5.698901098901099

8579300,5,B00CAUTPI6,"Readers encountering Gregory Bateson for the first time have their work cut out for them.  Although neither obtuse nor confusing, Bateson's writings (e.g., Steps to an Ecology of Mind: Collected Essays in Anthropology, Psychiatry, Evolution, and Epistemology; Sacred Unity: Further Steps to an Ecology of Mind) are often difficult and challenging, as they bear on this or that topic (play, information ecology, learning, change, interaction, evolution, etc.), but can leave the reader in some uncertainty as to ""what is Bateson really getting at here?""  Although the essays in the books mentioned repay study handsomely, none of them can fairly be described as good places to start as an introduction to his thinking.  In this context his daughter Nora Bateson's An Ecology of Mind film is something of a Godsend.  I know of nothing that makes Bateson more accessible than this warm and deeply stimulating treatment of her father's life and thought.  It is both a tribute and a blessing, and a golden path to Bateson's writings.  But be forewarned: An Ecology of Mind is not for passive viewing.  It requires an active and alert engagement, and a single run-through may well not be enough.",1421798400,7,1189,5.097938144329897
8579301,5,B00CAUTPI6,"Well done, and thought provoking, An Ecology of Mind brings the ideas of Gregory Bateson to life in a stimulating medium. The pace is very nice, and the subject matter (which could have been heady) is made to be very palatable without getting watered-down. I think this should be shown in a classroom environment, especially for schools that understand the importance of interdisciplinary courses. Viewers will be inspired to ask questions, and wonder more about the world around them! Never stop wondering!",1386979200,10,507,5.195121951219512
8579302,5,B00CAUTPI6,"A great film about a brilliant man and his ideas, which are still cutting-edge 40 years later. I've seen this film at least 30 times, and I still make new connections every time. Nora, Gregory Bateson's younger daughter, has done a masterful job that is both heart warming and intellectually stimulating. She captures the essence of her father's mind and heart.

As we continue towards ecological collapse, this film is critically important for helping us rethink the way we live.",1383782400,11,480,5.0
