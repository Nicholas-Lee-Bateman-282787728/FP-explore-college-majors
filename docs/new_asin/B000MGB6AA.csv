8168467,2,B000MGB6AA,"The good part - it does show the basics of guitar setup on a Fender Stratocaster style guitar.  John LeVan seems to know what he's doing.  There are 8 sections: Playing Style (asking the guitarist how they play), Tool(s) and Materials, Cleaning and Restringing, Adjusting Truss Rod, Bridge Saddle, String Nut, Adjusting Pickups, Intonation.  There is also a Closing Thoughts section.  Each section is about 5 minutes long but, w/ a caveat (see below.)

The bad parts... pretty much everything else.

It is extremely short.  Much of the video portions consist of still shots (like a ruler held on a fret to measure a string... or the all important magnifying lens lamp) that are repeated in the various 8 sections.  The actual video instruction is pretty minimal (although the Intonation section has an overly long scene of LeVan making adjustments).  In addition, much of the instructions are trite and repetitive - for example, ""use more light to see"" and ""use the right tools (available from All Parts).""  I suggest that LeVan take a cue from Norm Abram and get some of those basic instructions out of the way in the beginning and move on.

It feels like a long commercial for Planet Waves and All Parts tools.  I'm not sure what the relationship is between Mel Bay, LeVan and those companies are, but how many times do we need to hear, ""Using the right tools is important.  All Parts can provide them."" or, ""I'm going to wind the string with this excellent Planet Waves string winder...""  those are somewhat paraphrased but, I am not exaggerating.  It's distracting to the technique - they should have created a separate section w/ ""recommended tools.""

The interviews are worthless.  Let me summarize the 2 interviews.  ""What do you think is important for a guitar?""  ""the Setup.""  That question is followed up by the equally banal questions, ""what are you doing now?"" and ""what do you recommend for an up and coming guitarist?""  (answers - ""I'm setting up a concert"" and ""Practice."")  In addition, I'm not sure why these two interviews are interspersed with the main body of videos showing the setup.  They interrupt the flow of the instructions unnecessarily... perhaps it is b/c the interviews are only about 2 minutes long each and they couldn't justify that as a separate main menu item?

Poor quality video, music, and sound.  It is a very poorly produced video with overly loud constant repetitive background music that often drowns out LeVan's low/soft voice.  The overall quality is indicated by the obvious typo on the menu.  Lose the music, get a mic on LeVan.

Instructions are very minimal.  Although there are 3 other types of electric guitars on the wall behind LeVan, the different methods of setting them up are not discussed in much depth.  Perhaps, I am unfair in expecting a more complete reference so I won't hold this against LeVan/Mel Bay too much.

No liner or booklet.  I think a booklet with some measurements or reference information could have been useful.  Maybe they want you to buy the book to go along with the dvd?

I know very very little about guitar setup... I now know a little more.  In my opinion, getting guitar setup information on the internet is probably equivalent to this dvd.  The Intonation section was the part that I learned the most about and I wish it had been expanded upon.  Overall, I can't recommend this DVD for most people.",1174003200,7,3384,4.7923875432525955
