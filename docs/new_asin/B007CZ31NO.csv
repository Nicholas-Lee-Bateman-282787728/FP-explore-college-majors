8514718,4,B007CZ31NO,"A young war veteran entering the Roman Catholic priesthood, though not without doubts about his suitability for it, encounters two women who, in their very different ways, offer alternative paths in life. But it's the second woman who presents the greater challenge, as she is in need of immediate help which he may be the only one to provide, but at cost to his priestly vocation. Viewers familiar with the story Jesus told of the priest, the levite and the Samaritan on the way to Jericho will recognize the problem, even if the particulars have been changed, and the person in need made more conventionally appealing.",1472515200,,620,4.8584905660377355
8514719,4,B007CZ31NO,"Anne Baxter and Steve Forrest are upstaged by the location photography in BEDEVILLED, the first major American film to be shot in Paris after WW2.  The story itself is pure melodrama - Gregory Fitzgerald (Forrest) has just arrived in Paris to commence his training for the priesthood when he stumbles into Monica Johnson (Baxter), an American nightclub singer who is visibly distressed.  Greg is the perfect gentleman and soon uncovers Monica's plight - she is being chased by underworld heavies for her part in a murder.

The performances from the two stars are fine but they can't compete with the stunning location photography, including a wonderful scene staged at Napoleon's tomb in Les Invalides.  Anne Baxter spends the bulk of the film in an outrageous, Helen Rose-designed tangerine dress with sheer Arabian-style robe.  This was Forrest's first 'leading man' assignment and he does well, considering that he is saddled with some of the clunkiest dialogue in the script.

Print quality on this Warner Archive disc is very pleasing - the image is thick and has good colour, but the sound isn't the best.  The only extra is the obligatory trailer.  Recommended for Anne Baxter fans.",1438819200,3,1189,5.061538461538461
8514720,5,B007CZ31NO,"This film was made when going to Europe was a luxury, before cable and the Web made it so commonplace, so the director features the Paris locales to the hilt. The plot concerns a beautiful American singer who is also an illegal resident (Anne Baxter) and who is being chased by hooligans over the death of her European lover (who had ties with the underworld). She is helped by another American, a young seminarian (Steve Forrest), though she does not know this. Yes, it's all very corny, but very well served. You get the feeling, particularly when Baxter sings her world weary ditty in a Parisian loft, that this vehicle was probably intended for the likes of Marlene Dietrich, but what the heck. The print is sharp and full of color from edge to CinemaScope edge. You get to see post war Paris before the traffic got truly scary. There is not a tourist site you won't be treated to, but it is all somehow worked into the plot. There's even the 50's de rigueur Fashion Show"" (!!!). It's a B-movie with class-A treatment by the slick and sophisticated Mitchell Leisen. If you like old fashioned escapism don't hesitate to grab this one.",1387584000,7,1137,4.605911330049261
