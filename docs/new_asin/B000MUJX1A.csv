8172461,1,B000MUJX1A,"I have this concert on VHS and decided to buy it on DVD.  My VHS copy is crystal clear and the sound is wonderful.  This is a great concert and I have watched it many, many times when I had a VCR.  This DVD looked like an amateur filmed it on their camera - the sound is terrible and the video is fuzzy, color is terrible - unviewable.  I want to return this DVD and get a refund but I cannot find the receipt that came with the DVD.  Is there any way to return this DVD?",1374451200,4,471,3.814432989690722

8172464,5,B000MUJX1A,"I was 14 years old when I went to this concert.  We had good seats and I could feel the energy electrify the stadium, the concert goers and those like me.  I don't have the adequate words to describe the spiritual connection I still feel with Ms. Turner.",1188518400,2,254,4.270833333333333
