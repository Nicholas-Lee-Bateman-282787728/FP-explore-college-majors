8496078,5,B006BHIARQ,"Joshua is very clear and to the point when reviewing  the ""4 Steps to Getting a Job Interview with LinkedIn.""  He focuses on how to list your targeted companies, connect with Alumini Groups, looking for Patterns and Trends in your business, reaching out and connecting to people you know and gathering information on companies to include who was recently hired, let go and was a recent former employer for a company.  He also stated that you need to have someone introduce you to a hiring manager rather than connecting yourself.  Joshua also answered many questions after the video which is wonderful.

8496079,4,B006BHIARQ,"Joshua has many good tips for enhancing a LinkedIn profile in order to promote visibility and generate interest. He provides links to tools outside of LinkedIn to help the job seeker keep up with trends and issues in their industry. This is a recording of a webinar, so the requests for questions and the screen sharing is lost on the viewers of this DVD.",1333324800,,355,4.5625
