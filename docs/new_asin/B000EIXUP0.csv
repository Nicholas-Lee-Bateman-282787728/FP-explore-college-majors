8110521,3,B000EIXUP0,"The movie 'The Ring' was based on a novel by Koji Suzuki, the first book of a trilogy.  The books of the trilogy are Ring, Spiral, and Loop.  The movie is a sequel to 'The Ring', based on the second book.  It was not particularly successful...it goes off in unexpected directions with different characters than the first film.  So the Japanese eventually made another sequel called 'The Ring 2', which was more like the sequel which was made a couple of years later in the US.  Still, this movie is worth seeing if you enjoy Japanese horror movies, or if you just want to compare it to the book.  The books have been translated into English, by the way, and are also available here on Amazon.",1155081600,,692,4.4523809523809526
