8575887,3,B00BZMMRBM,"I thought the movie was okay but nothing spectacular. Richard Coyle did a god job of acting in what is now a run of the mill subject with no where to go, as everyone else has put out stuff on this subject dozens of times over.",1395360000,,226,3.9347826086956523

8575890,4,B00BZMMRBM,This is a pretty good movie about a pusher under pressure to deliever on a debt. I found it interesting that this guy doesn't get high on his own supply. I think he might get high pushing the edge of his own envelope.,1386979200,,217,4.069767441860465
8575891,2,B00BZMMRBM,"This film didn't need to be made and was not as good as the original.  I got more 'real' feeling from the original and I thought it was way better done than this movie.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.  Go watch the original instead.",1377734400,2,234,4.043478260869565
