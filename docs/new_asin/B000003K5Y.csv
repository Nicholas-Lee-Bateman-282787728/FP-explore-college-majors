7902824,4,B000003K5Y,"I was fortunate enough to review this episode after others have done so and I found myself agreeing with the points being made by almost every reviewer but my conclusion differs.
Masks is a star-vehicle ... allowing actors Brent Spiner and Patrick Stewart to display the skill that put them on board the Enterprise.  No, not the ability to command but the ablity to act.  Each actor gives a very entertaining portrayal and I found myself enjoying my viewing much like one would enjoy ""Night Gallery"" or ""Twilight Zone"".
Unlike most ""Star Vehicles""... this plot plays on Jean Luc Picard's interest in Archaeology, thus being true to the series and true to the character.  The tale interweaves great ideas that could have made a better full length movie than hour-long episode.  Not only does the script and the setting evoke images of fogotten Gods and Mayan-type religions, but the names (especially Korgano and Masaka) instills a sense of mythical curiousity and cautious foreboding.
This is another one of those episodes where telling you the facts(comet, ancient civilization, changes, near-catastrophe, clever solution) does not really help you to understand it.  Those are only the plot devices.  The strength of this interlude is way it is handled.
This is a not a stereo-typical, definable race encounter nor is there ever meant to be a clear understanding of this alien ideology. Part of the entertainment value is in the mystery and the inability to label the motivations.  This clever use of props to portray a mood (symbology, subtle design of artifacts) and gives depth to an alien culture without the need to define it in formal terms.  The almost subliminal way the writers play on our innate understanding of ancient cultures and religions stands out without being heavy handed.
There are some obvious shortcomings... the obligatory investigation of an object in space gone awry, the all-powerful alien artifact, the ever-malfunctioning Data.  Despite these fallacies, this episode is like a roller coaster.  All coasters look alike from a distance but you notice the differences when you ride them.
This is one of those interludes where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. I didn't come away from this viewing as a better person with deeper understanding of mankind... I came away thoroughly entertained and had my curiousity stimulated beyond the confines of a mere TV show.",1037318400,,2403,5.060759493670886
7902825,3,B000003K5Y,"The Enterprise is checking out a rogue comet when strange artifacts start appearing all over the ship, weird symbols pop up on terminal displays, and Data starts exhibiting multiple personalities.  When the Enterprise burns away the outer layer of the comet they discover an ancient archieve that is apparently transforming the starship into a living museum of the culture it represents.  Meanwhile, several of Data's new personalities warn of the coming of Masaka, which is apparently not a good thing.
It is always nice to see Brent Spiner getting a chance to do a bit of acting on the show, but ""Masks"" is one of the sillier STNG episodes.  Certainly the characters take what is happening more seriously than the viewers who have no choice other than to go along for the ride.  This is another one of those ""alien artifact overwhelms Federation technology putting every one in danger until Picard saves the day"" episodes.  The series sure made the most out of Picard's ""interest"" in archeology, but for such advanced technology the alien culture is pretty primitive: Masaka and Korgano are sun and moon archetypes.  However, it does serve as a nice excuse for the prop department to come up with some nifty doodads.",987811200,,1218,4.917073170731707
7902826,3,B000003K5Y,"None of the Next Generation episodes are terribly bad, but this episode ranks with ""Encounter at Farpoint"" and some of the very preachy episodes in the first season as being among the worst of the series.  The plot deals with a strange device within a comet slowly transforming the Enterprise into an ancient alien temple.  It gives Picard, as an amateur specialist in archaeology and ancient cultures, a chance to guess as to what it all means rather than do what Kirk would have done if he were there:  blow the comet into bits.  The plot also provides the writers a chance to cause Data to malfunction yet once again and turn into a god (and a few other unusual personages).  On a positive note, this episode gives Brent Spiner fans a chance to see him at his best and I really did enjoy his performance despite the weak story.",971395200,6,830,4.506666666666667
