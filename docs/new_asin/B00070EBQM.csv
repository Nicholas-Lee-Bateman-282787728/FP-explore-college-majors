Christoph Waltz appears in Schussangst for about four scenes.  If his German work interests, perhaps purchase Schussangst.
 Gun-Shy's protagonist is Lukas, and Lukas's love interest is Isabella. They are Schussangst's main characters, and Schussangst is a character study of them--especially Lukas. This German story shares a premise with Garden State, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  The uninitiated might like this movie if they like those. A very introverted young man exists in an absurd--yet realistic--world, and he meets a quirky girl who draws him out a bit. However, Schussangst has a more melancholy tone and plot than the three films mentioned. For example, violence and frustration play parts in Gun-Shy. Both Lukas and Isabella are repressed. Isabella has dark secrets; therefore, she loses herself in the martial art kendo. Lukas feels impotent, for Isabella remains emotionally and sexually unavailable to him. Also, most everyone seems to tread over the quiet, unassertive pacifist who Lukas is at the film's beginning. Then, through certain circumstances, Lukas becomes interested in guns. You see, the title Gun-Shy, fear of others' shooting, is actually not the closest translation of ""Schussangst."" Actually, Schussangst describes someone who hesitates to shot, someone who is not a man about things, someone who feels impotent.

Is it a good movie?
Sometimes, thank God for a lack of explication and an opportunity for interpretation. Schussangst's characters are realistic. We the audience have met Lukas and Isabella and many of the characters around them. And, just as in real life, we must read the characters around us. We interpret them, and our individual analyses vary. Round characters, such as this film's, make for complex texts that give viewers' minds more to do. Writer Dirk Kurbjuweit and director Dito Tsintsadze show instead of tell, and an active viewer appreciates their approach greatly.
Schussangst's characters are realistic. We the audience have met Lukas and Isabella and many of the characters around them. We understand and appreciate Isabella. Isabella has every right to keep things platonic, to keep secrets, to keep control. One understands especially once one learns about her life situation. And, we are all Lukas to some extent. We want to do things passively and peacefully--without ""shooting."" In quiet desperation, we want to be loved and supported in so many ways: carnally, emotionally, spiritually. We want others to appreciate how much we do for them. Any audience empathizes with Lukas and Isabella. Both pursue respect as we all do.
 Finally, I appreciate all of the symbolism throughout Schussangst. Tsintsadze describes this work as a ""poetic thriller."" Certainly, it has much poetry throughout. For example, Lukas acquires North Korean whiskey that contains a snake in the bottle the same way that tequila contains a worm. The snake might represent the phallic creature or the venom within Lukas who, with much inner venom and frustration, cannot use his gun, for he is impotent and gun-shy, remember. In another scene, an old prostitute first warms Lukas like a mother would; then abruptly, she fellates this repressed young man. Her age, her behavior, and the scene's juxtaposed actions provide rich opportunity for analysis. Throughout Schussangst, Lukas encounters odd characters and odd situations, and one finds his journey slightly similar to a fairy tale. Such mythos is poetic.

How could it be a better movie?
I watched Schussangst twice before especially ""getting"" the plot. Tsintsadza's greatest strength is also his greatest weakness. As mentioned, Kurjuweit and he do not spell-out everything in the film. Therefore, I understood Gun-Shy's ending only upon re-watching the movie. Then, I knew (or could well guess) why two characters did as they did. Although never bored during any viewing, a viewer must review, study, and analyze this film",1344384000,2,3978,5.3568
8044387,3,B00070EBQM,I couldn't find! Why? Perhaps it is lock of the right element or it wasn't implanted there from the beginning. Action and transitions from one scene to another are too slow due to lock of experience of the entire team or director's ability. Actors and characters do not always match the desire or expected personality. The scenes are too long and poorly developed. Lock of a closing element at the end of the story.,1317600000,,415,4.621621621621622
8044388,4,B00070EBQM,"Curiouser and curiouser.  I found this movie to be very captivating.  I couldn't really take my eyes away from the screen for too long (and that's the way I like my movies). It's about a lonely young man who meets a young woman. . . but it's about so much more.

Actually, at the end of the movie there may still be a few questions left unanswered (if  you decide to watch it, you can be the judge).

This movie is about a boy-girl story and how that develops (there are a few surprises).  It also includes an interesting cast of older characters that the boy/man meets through his job delivering meals to the elderly.

I think this film was full and complete with several interwoven plots and a well-developed pace.  It wasn't fast-paced but it moved along very nicely with the viewer learning something new about the characters constantly throughout the film.  The plot development is a bit unique.  The viewer isn't spoon-fed anything.  I love that.  The story just moves along and you sort of have to figure a few things out.  It's very refreshing.

This movie has a lot of elements that I like in a film but some of surprises at the end disturbed me a bit.  Hence the 4 stars.",1261958400,2,1181,4.427906976744186

8044391,4,B00070EBQM,"Schussangst (Fear of Shooting) is a deliberately paced, suspenseful movie that unfortunately, will not be for all audiences. It is not a typical Hollywood thriller. In fact, to call it a thriller may be to do it a disservice by attracting the wrong crowd.

Lukas (Fabian Hinrichs) is a shy and lonely young man who because of his pacifist outlook, chooses to serve out his national service by delivering food to the elderly. One day on a tramride, a beautiful young woman (Lavinia Wilson) throws a letter into his lap. It says ""Help me"". Nothing more. Intrigued, he follows her off the tram, gets to know her and eventually starts dating her. She never explains the letter.

Over time, he gets infatuated with her, obsessed would be a better word. Secretly he trails her around the city. He finds her at a martial arts class practising Kendo. What would a stick-wielding martial arts expert need his help in?. Later he sneaks in after another Kendo session to find her humping away with an older man. When he questions her about it, she gives him a cryptic reply about how life is full of unfathomable pain. Only later does he find out that the man is her stepfather. Putting two and two together, he concludes that she isn't happy with the relationship she's having with her stepdad. So he hatches a hare-brained scheme to kill the stepfather, picturing himself as her valiant rescuer. He goes about buying a rifle and learns to shoot. The pacifist learns to become a killer - is he just a deluded romantic? or is he a psycho-stalker in the making?

One major drawback of the film but one arrived at by artistic choice, is the way it is shot. The film is disorientating because at many points, the camera looks at the world through Lukas' eyes. From his point of view, the world doesn't make sense and that unfortunately is what the audience also feels. Why does the girl choose him of all people? Did the girl even choose him? Why does she ignore him totally at the end? We are left in the dark because that is precisely how Lukas feels.

At the end, the movie leaves the viewer to fill in the blanks. Did the girl really set him up to kill her father? Or to kill herself? Or was it all just the overworked imaginings of his warped mind. An intriguing movie. But not to all tastes. It was the controversial winner of the Best Picture award at the 2003 San Sebastian International Film Festival. Controversial because many of the critics didn't like it.

The DVD transfer is in its original aspect ratio of 1.85:1. Unfortunately it is letterboxed and is NON-anamorphic (not enhanced for widescreen TV). Audio is the original German 2.0 stereo. Optional english subtitles are provided. Picture quality is fair with no major concerns but nothing to boast about. Black levels are good and colors are natural. It could have been better considering that it was made in 2003 and the the DVD was released in 2005.",1114387200,16,2907,4.615087040618955
