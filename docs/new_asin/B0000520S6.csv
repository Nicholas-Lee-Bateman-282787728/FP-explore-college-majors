1388082,4,B0000520S6,"Culled from shows made from 1956 through 1960, mostly in a slightly grainy b&w, with approximately 15 minutes in color, this 55 minute tape takes one back to simpler times, with a lot of homespun humor; Ernie has a good sense of comedic timing, making it very enjoyable to watch.
There is wonderful dialogue between Ernie and the children, with guest spots given to Lee Aeker and Rin Tin Tin, and a marvelous scene with John Provost and Lassie, where Ernie explains the meaning of Christmas to him, and reads from the Bible, Luke 2: 1-14. There is also a funny Ford car advertisment, with Ernie packing the kids in a station wagon like sardines.
Most of the singing is done by the Top Twenty group, and they are a fine ensemble. Ernie sings ""I've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm"", ""Children Go Where I Send Thee"", and the Alfred Burt/Whila Huston ""Some Children See Him"", which is a truly beautiful hymn.
The guest star is Kate Smith, and she sings ""Joy to the World"", and ""White Christmas""; it is so nice to see and hear this venerable grand lady of American song.
The best comes at the end: Ernie is joined by Gordon MacRae in an incredibly moving rendition of ""O Holy Night""; hearing these two great voices singing this magnificent hymn, brought tears to my eyes. I am so glad this exquisite duet was saved on film, to delight and inspire us so many years later.",1066435200,11,1361,4.469879518072289
1388093,5,B0000520S6,"For anyone with a fondness for classic, family television, ""A Ford Show Family Christmas"" is a textbook, must-have DVD.  Those Thursday nights from 1956-61 with Ol' Ern will never be duplicated because we don't have the performers who sing the kind of music presented here.

We will never revive the variety show from the grave, but this is a pleasant reminder of what television once was.",1387843200,2,389,4.878787878787879
1388094,4,B0000520S6,"I understand that this Christmas video combined scenes and song segments from three of the late 1950s-1960 Christmas shows Tennessee Ernie Ford hosted.  The program consisted of approximately 15 Christmas songs sung by his choir, The Top Twenty, plus numerous skits.  There was a cute skit centered around the march of the toy soldiers and a ballet dancer.  There was one commercial advertising a Ford station wagon, and one appearance each by Rin Tin Tin and Lassie; all three segments featuring lots of children!  Ernie read the story of the Nativity from Luke in the Bible to make the children understand the meaning of Christmas.  Kate Smith, who had been on his previous Christmas Shows sang ""The Christmas Song"" and ""White Christmas"" by herself.  The other guest star was Gordon MacRae, who sang ""O Holy Night"" in a beautiful duet with Ernie.  I thought this video is fine for children and family viewing.",1335657600,2,911,4.915032679738562
1388095,5,B0000520S6,"I love this DVD, if you miss the old fashioned Christmas shows or if you enjoy the wonderful humor of Tennessee Ernie Ford you will certainly enjoy this. Or if you just want to add to your Christmas collection I would recommend this DVD.",1266105600,,237,4.409090909090909
1388096,5,B0000520S6,Excellent time capsule of Ernie's show from the 50's and 60's. A few unscripted scenes with the kids are great. A great show to watch anytime of the year.,1261526400,,154,4.344827586206897
1388097,5,B0000520S6,"This is a fantastic, wonderful video! So nostalgic and entertaining. I have bought so many of these DVD's to give as gifts, it is so great that I want to share it with all of my friends and relatives. The Seller that I have been buying them from is great also, very prompt delivery, and the best price on amazon! 10 stars to both the product and the Vendor!",1260403200,,357,4.188405797101449
1388098,5,B0000520S6,"The shows are wonderful! Heartwarming and unapologetically Christian in orientation; good music presented by professionals with warm stories and chats that only Erine could pull off.
The tape its self was less than wonderful. It is a VHS made from the old films where they actually filmed a TV screen. I forget the name of that process, but it is dark and grainy. Too bad the old Ford shows can't be found in direct film format.",1250208000,2,428,4.644736842105263
1388099,5,B0000520S6,"This compilation from several Christmas shows of the Tennessee Ernie Ford TV series is outstanding.  If you like nostalgia, gospel, and good, clean fun, then this is a DVD for you.  Though the staging is a bit awkward at times, consider the era and rejoice that Ford's impressive and powerful voice has been preserved.  There are other treasures here as well: Kate Smith and a '56 Ford station wagon!",1231200000,6,400,4.768115942028985
1388100,5,B0000520S6,"I saw this on PBS some years ago, and having grown up listening to country music (when it was still country music), I was well aware of who Tennessee Ernie Ford was.  This video is well worth the price and includes some standards as well as some of the classic carols sung by one of the best baritones in the business, then and now.  The song listing is included with the case insert and is indexed as well on the DVD.  It is made very entertaining by both Ford's down home manner and is especially memeorable by the antics of one of his children during a live performance.  I like listening to people who can sing, which is becoming rarer and rarer these days, and I highly recommend this video to everyone.",1230854400,9,708,4.340909090909091
1388101,4,B0000520S6,"Tennessee Ernie Ford was without a doubt one of the great singing voices of the 20th. Century!  At his best, he was right up there with Crosby, Jolson, and Sinatra. This 'Christmas' program, culled from his long running TV series has some nice moments, plus some nice guests such as Kate Smith singing a lovely version of 'White Christmas'.

Anyone who thinks Tennessee Ernie was just a 'Hillbilly type singer', think again, when it comes to big ballads, this classicly trained singer had the 'big voice', and could deliver the goods! As well as this DVD, there is an excellent one featuring a biography available, which includes another program of 'Spirituals' [as he called them], which is well worth the price alone.

There are some very pleasant surprises for anyone wishing to re-discover, or indeed discover for the first time, one of the really great entertainers of the 50""s & 60's.",1178496000,15,890,4.880794701986755
1388102,4,B0000520S6,"If you are the type of person for which videos must flash and have bells and whistles, you won't like this. However, if you enjoy the leisurely pace of older Christmas specials, this one is for you. It is a compilation of several different Tennessee Ernie Ford Christmas specials, most of them in black and white. One has Lee Aaker and Rin Tin Tin as guests--Aaker is funny--and another has Jon Provost (Timmy) and Lassie--fun to see them on a variety show. Of course the highlights are the musical numbers, and there's one very funny family singing scene where Ford's little boy is sitting next to him and just bopping to the music (it's shown up in several blooper specials). My wish: they'd included ALL the shows in their entirety.",1160956800,2,735,4.661538461538462
