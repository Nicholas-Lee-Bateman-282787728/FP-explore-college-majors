8067819,4,B0009W5JUK,"This DVD has some of Clifford's best episodes on it. There is a plethora of education here as well as morals for all ages. I'm only minusing a star for the episode The Truth About Cats and Dogs because that episode is quite bland. Still, it's a great DVD with some of my favorite episodes",1494115200,,288,4.254545454545455

8067825,4,B0009W5JUK,"""Doggie Detectives"" is a Clifford DVD release featuring eight stories from the show. The first set of four have a theme of mysteries and mystery-solving, while the second set the second set of four don't really seem to have any unified theme that I can figure out, but are still pretty cool.

The eight stories are ""The Kibble Crook,"" ""Doggie Detectives,"" ""Who Moved My Bone,"" ""To Catch a Bird,"" ""Mac's Secret Dog Club,"" ""The Truth About Dogs and Cats,"" ""Good-Bye, T-Bone"" and ""Magic is in the Air."" These are all fully close-captioned and are also available in a Spanish audio track. Both the English and Spanish tracks are Dolby digital.

The special features aren't much to shout about, but at least they made a try at them. There is a game that lets the viewers solve some small mysteries --- you are given three clues as to a mystery that happened and you have to choose from three characters based on the clues in order to solve it. Those that are familiar with ""Blue's Clues"" will be fully aware of this concept and have probably already figured out that these generally only really need one or two clues to solve. Also included are three Speckle stories, accessible also in the Special Features. These are nice to have on there and are kinda cute. Also included are trailers / promos including one for the show ""Maya & Miguel"" (never seen) and the movie ""Care Bears Big Wish Movie"" (absolutely wonderful.)",1134777600,12,1413,4.670682730923695
8067826,5,B0009W5JUK,"I recently bought this cartoon DVD for my 3 year old daughter. When my daughter was much younger, we would lay down and watch Futurama or Simpsons. However, now they she has become very impressionable, we no longer watch those older cartoon and now focus on Clifford and Franklin.

This Clifford DVD included 8 episodes that all revolve around a detective theme. One episode brings in a friend of Cliffords who is a handicapped dog and is missing one of his rear legs. I think this is great because my daugher watches it and see that even though the dog is missing a leg, he can still play with Clifford and T-Bone and Cleo like a dog with all his legs. Teaches my daughter that even though he is slightly different he can still run and play like all the others. As is the par for Clifford all episodes reveal a lesson to the children that they can take with them and learn to apply to life. One episode has T-bone taking all of Cleo's food. It is called the Kibble Crook. T-bone lies and says it was another dog and in the end learns that lying was a mistake and he should have told the truth. All episodes teach these kinds of lessons very well.

I am 32 years old and I also grew up with Clifford, although it was books and not the cartoons. I have been very pleased with the Clifford series and just bought two new DVD's for me and my daughters night time bonding time so we can snuggle and get some good laughs with together. Good buy for the family and it just tickles me to be laying there with my daughter and hear her snicker at something Clifford or friends are doing.",1129593600,5,1578,4.274247491638796
