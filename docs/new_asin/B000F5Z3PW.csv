8117794,3,B000F5Z3PW,"Just got this from amazon, played on my region free player but not my region one player. It's a roughly half hour compilation of monster clips (and some fights) from assorted Max episodes. Included are clips of Eleking, Gomora, Metron and Batlan plus various new monsters. I was surprised to see that the show has a somewhat campy/jokey approach as opposed to classic series such as the 1966 Ultraman. The monster suits have awesome detail but somehow look artificial in a way that these characters didn't in their 6os appearances. They look more like giant, living Bandai toys than the ""suspend your disbelief/pass for real""  monsters of the old days. Maybe it's the lighting. But it's definitely deliberate. In any case, there's a lot of reverence for (and reference to)  the earlier series and I'd love to see a Region One release of the actual episodes. Or at least the ones with Red King.
