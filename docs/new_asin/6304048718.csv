Getting Robert Penn Warren before he died to talk about Long on film was  also a stroke of genius.

It would've been nicer to see Long's efforts (and the forces he was up against) explained in the proper context they deserved.

769276,4,6304048718,"This is a very good informational documentary about former Louisiana Governor and US Senator Huey Long, and there really aren't any others on that subject that are in its league as far as the overview of his life and career are concerned. I definitely feel that the film has a fairly strong conservative bias to it, however, and that is really the only reason I didn't give it five stars. So much emphasis is placed on the corruption associated with Long that it seems as if he actually invented political corruption in Louisiana. I assure you he did not. Much of what is cited as corruption was simply the political spoils system that had been practiced in the South since the time of Andrew Jackson. The fact of the matter is that Long was the best governor Louisiana ever had. Not that that's saying a whole lot. But he was almost single-handedly responsible for modernizing the state in almost every way imaginable despite serving at a time when the Great Depression was bringing the nation to its knees, and he was hugely popular with the people for doing so. His enemies were the conservative politicians, big oil companies such as Standard Oil, and other corporate interests, whose previous monopoly on power and influence were threatened by the idea that the will of the people was actually being carried out and, God forbid, that they were actually expected to pay taxes like everyone else. You know, the same people who constantly gripe about paying their fair share of taxes today. Long did pretty much monopolize political power in the state for himself and his cronies, but he did so with the overwhelming support of the people, unlike his predecessors and contemporary opponents. For those who would give credit to his conservative opponents for standing up to him, please keep in mind that these are the same people who had been keeping the average person in Louisiana down for decades with their own political corruption and bad policies, and they would continue to do so once they regained power later on, including staunchly opposing progress in the area of civil rights in the state. These are people who love to go around quoting Thomas Jefferson, but violate his principles at every turn by favoring the rights of corporations and banks over those of individual citizens. Long sought to return the power of government to the people, and that is exactly what he did, at least for a time. Anyway, that's just something for anyone who isn't from Louisiana to consider. Those of us who are from the state know better than to pay too much heed to what Long's political opponents had to say about him, but I feel that he has largely gotten a bad rap outside the state.",1359936000,3,2683,4.735042735042735

769278,5,6304048718,"""Huey Long"" (1985) by Ken Burns tried to defame and demonize Huey Long, but failed...Long was a ""good guy,"" and this doc shows that.

U.S. Senator (and former Lousinana governor) Huey P. Long was an opponent of Franklin Roosevelt, and might have won the 1936 USA Presidentail election, but he was murdered in cold blood in front of dozens of people in September of 1935, the year before the 1936 election.

Revisionist history instructs us all (especially if we attended government schools, which always provide doctrinaire political viewpoints when USA history is taught) to revere President Franklin Roosevelt and all he did (nobody much now questions the USA entering World War II which killed half a million USA citizens in less than 4 years, even though most of pre-WWII America opposed entering the war, and many historians opine that Roosevelt engineered and manipulated USA entrance into that war...many state that entrance into WWII was neither desirable nor justified).

That same revisionist history demonized Sen. Huey P. Long, and anti-Long slogans from his opponents have made their way into post WWII history books and movies and become ""respected facts."" The Ken Burns ""Huey Long"" (1985) tries to be anti-Long, but fails.

Many anti-Long partisans, some very famous and influential, state the anti-Long case, but somehow, they are not believable.

What comes through in this documentary, in spite of the obvious bias of the filmmakers who present it, is that Sen. Huey P. Long was a man of astonishing ability and accomplishment who had goals many politicians of the 1930's and later stated they shared, but came much closer to delivering on his public promises than most others stating they shared his same ""redistribute the wealth"" agenda ever did.

Huey Long delivered.

That is the unmistakable message of this documentary.

The anti-Long sentiment and invective melts away in the face of that message, and the considerable evidence which supports it.

He was a good man who died young, and people hoping for good people part of politics in the USA's future can and should remember who he was, and how close he came to getting national leadership power, and using it well.

For anyone who doesn't remember Hewey Long it should be watched to learn what can happen under the right circumstances. Also read Robert Penn Warren's book ""All the King's Men""and review another film ""A Face in the Crowd"" though that film is actually about Arther Godfry.",1329004800,2,396,4.591549295774648
769339,5,6304048718,"A lot of people seem to think that America would never had been the same had Long became president, that America would have become purely a socialist country. I don't think so. People seem to become short-sighted when it comes to whether or not Congress would have allowed his ideas come to pass. Considering all of the deals that Roosevelt didn't have go through during his second term such as the NRA, among others, and his attempts of adjusting it and Congress still not letting become law, what would make them subject to someone (Long) who felt that Roosevelt wasn't doing enough? His ""Share Our Wealth"" wouldn't have happened on a nationwide scale. But enough of my viewpoints on this issue.

Burns does a great job with adding people who supported him (the poor) and the ones who didn't (middle-high class), and that they were still alive a half-century after his death is remarkable, and surely couldn't happen now except from a third-person perspective. It showed all of the good he did with building better highways, bridges getting textbooks for the children at the schools, and improving the overall structure of state of Louisiana. The also showed what he had to do to keep power, which wasn't justifiable in certain cases, if any (for example, the kidnapping prior to the elections) and the puppets he had in office during his term as Senator. It gives you a balanced look at what he did during his time involved with politics. I also enjoyed the looks of his earlier life, and his campaigning with ""Every man a King, but no one wears a crown"", and you can see how people were drawn to him with more than his promises? It also makes you think was he justified in his actions in order to keep power.

I've seen several of Burns' documentaries,  ""Thomas Jefferson"", ""Prohibition"", and the Lewis and Clark documentary, along with this one. Haven't had the time to get around to ""The Civil War"" or ""Baseball"" yet, but this should be mentioned as one of his best.",1324425600,2,1972,4.69364161849711
769340,4,6304048718,"Engaging, repulsive, remarkable, corrupt, conniving, accomplished, effective, diversive and arrogant. If you recognize that all of those terms and a few hundred others have been used to describe the subject of this Ken Burns profile of Huey P. Long, you already know the Kingfish. This is an excellent documentary for those with an interest in Huey Long or for those merely curious about him. Burns presents a plethora of perspectives from a variety of people familiar with Long in differing ways. The Kingfish would have heavily edited Burns' version and might well have had him kidnapped to prevent its release. But that shrewd rascal would have loved his inclusion of the comments of ""the poor people"" who clearly loved Huey P. It becomes very clear that the former Louisiana governor and state senator was a dramatically polarizing personality whose individual ambitions were so intertwined with his determination to improve the lot of marginalized people along the backroads and bayous that simple assessment becomes impossible.

While we may be disappointed that Burns spends so little time with the assassination, we surely appreciate the rich tapestry of Long's career, personality and style. Burns does not attempt the conventions of simple explanation and consensus opinion; with Huey P. Long, that simply is not possible. What he does give us is a very comprehensive sampling of often conflicting perceptions from diverse characters, some of whom are quite colorful themselves.",1268611200,2,1488,5.3319148936170215
769341,5,6304048718,"This documentary ,which is one of Ken Burns earliest, is just a excellent look at Huey Long. Long was one of the most controversial figures in 20th century American politics and this documentary does him great justice. I only wish that the documentary could have been longer because their are so many great anecdotes about Long that are left out. I would highly recommend reading T. Harry Williams Pulitzer prize winning book 'Huey Long' along with this DVD. It's too bad the documentary couldn't have been at least double the present length.

Almost all of the people interviewed in this documentary are now gone so it was great that Burns was able to interview them in the '80s and hear people's impressions of Long and his many contradictions. They talk about Long like it was only yesterday not like fifty years had passed. The archival footage is just awesome. The footage is very clear and to see Long in the flesh actually talking really makes him come alive even more. This footage is worth the price of the DVD alone. You will hear Long's song 'Every Man a King' and this is very fascinating to see and hear. Also, the documentary begins with Long and his comparison between Democrats and Republicans and this is still hilarious and still so very true.

This documentary is very fair and shows both Long's dark side and all of the achievements he did for Louisiana. Long ,love him or hate him, is one of the most fascinating political characters that this nation has ever produced. The story as told by Burns is gripping and excellent. You will revisit a time when politicians ,by either legal or illegal means, actually got things done. You will shake your head at the shenanigans of Long and his cronies and you will wonder at what a strange, wonderful history our country has.

Highly recommended!

769342,5,6304048718,"This video is just the ticket if you want a brief but thorough overview of the life and times of Huey Long, a larger than life politician whose life was cut short by an assassins bullet.",1245888000,2,186,4.194444444444445
769343,4,6304048718,"America's memory of Huey Long owes a lot to two films: this 1985 documentary by Ken Burns, and Robert Rossen's 1949 movie, ""All The King's Men.""  Both the documentary and the movie portray a hero of the common people, who rises to be dictator of his state, then falls to an assassin's bullet.  Yet there are large differences.

The movie was inspired by Robert Penn Warren's novel of the same title, which in turn was inspired by Long's career (a fact that Warren famously and unconvincingly denied).  The movie's hero (named Willie Stark) is very bright, but a hick - a redneck - by birth and childhood circumstances.  His political career only catches fire when he learns to hammer his audiences with the tough sternness of a hick pounding fellow-hicks.

In contrast, Huey Long, in the documentary, is born to a hardworking, middle-class family, which sent most of its offspring to college, at a time when only one in twenty American children had that privilege.  Huey was an accomplished debater in high school, and a persuasive salesman in his first full-time job.  After just a year in Law School, he passed the bar, and soon was elected, at age 24, to the Louisiana Railroad Commission.

The movie confines Stark's political career to governor and boss of his state, and his policies primarily to state-sponsored public works, e.g., highways, public education, hospital care.  The documentary adds Long's years as United States Senator, crusader for the redistribution of Americans' wealth, and probable candidate for the Democratic nomination for President in 1936.

The documentary includes colorful excerpts from Long's speeches, crusading against economic inequality:  ""4% of the American people own 85% of the wealth of America,"" while ""70% of the people of America don't own enough to pay the debts they owe.""  ""The Lord has answered the prayer, he has called the barbecue.  Come to my feast, he says to 125 million American people. He has invited Americans to his feast, but Morgan, Rockefeller, and Mellon and Baruch have walked up and took 85% of the victuals off the table.  Now, how ya gonna feed the balance of the people?  What are Morgan, Rockefeller, Mellon and Baruch gonna do with all that grub?  They cain't eat it, they cain't wear the clothes, they cain't live in the houses.  Give `em a yacht! Give `em a palace!  Send `em to Reno & give `em a new wife if they want, if that's what they want.  But when they've got everything on God's living earth that they can eat, and they can wear and they can live in, and all their children can wear, and live in, and eat, and all their children's children can use, we gotta call Mr. Morgan and Mr. Rockefeller and Mr. Mellon back, and say: Come back heah, put back on this table heah what you took away from heah, the stuff you don't need; leave something for the American people to consume.""

The documentary notes the tremendous public response to Long's crusade, but fails to take seriously his plan for redistributing American wealth.  The plan is not described; its merits, pro and con, are not weighed.  This failure is my reason for giving Burns' work four, rather than five stars.  I won't try here to discuss the merits of the plan, but its main provisions -- very large taxes and subsidies -- are stated below.  I found them in a slim book of Long's speeches, entitled ""Kingfish to America: Share Our Wealth,"" edited by Henry Christman,1985, and available on Amazon.

By taxing savings and property, the wealth of the very rich would be reduced, so that ""no one would own more than 3 or 4 million dollars.""  Income would also be taxed, to ""limit the total anyone could earn or inherit in one year to $1 million.""  [These 1934 limits were actually less severe than they sound in 2009.  Due to inflation, one million 1934 dollars would equal over 15.4 million 2009 dollars, and four million 1934 dollars would equal over 61 million 2009 dollars.]

The money thus gained was estimated to provide every needy family in America with ""a home and the comforts of home, including such common conveniences as a radio and an automobile, free of debt.""  The government would ""guarantee food and clothing and employment for everyone who should work, by shortening the hours of labor to thirty hours per week, and to eleven months per year.""  Education would be free for every child, not just through high school, but on through college and vocational education.  Everyone over 60 years old, whose income was less than $1,000 per year, or whose net worth was less than $10,000, would receive a pension sufficient to support them in comfortable circumstances.",1239580800,5,4622,4.795454545454546

There are fascinating interviews and comments by Mrs. Hodding Carter Sr, and other contemporaries, but Robert Penn Warren absolutley steals the show with his readings and comments.

I think I, and many others, may have become overly accustomed to the flashy and light-hearted biographies produced by A&E.  Like other works in Ken Burns' oeuvre, this work is serious in tone.  Despite being released approximately 20 years ago, this work did not seem dated.  Those who find Cajun accents and the voices of the elderly exotic will especially love hearing the interviewees here.  At one point, they show Long singing a jingle.  I laughed inside just the way I rolled on the floor when John Ashcroft introduced his song ""Let the Eagle Fly.""

Huey Long promoted a redistribution of wealth.  They mention that he admired previous populist William Jennings Bryan.  However, I wonder from where else his class-based views arrived?  Was he influenced by Marxism or socialism at all?  Long helped the first woman be elected to the Senate.  He fought the synecdoche between man and human kind, by adding ""Every Girl a Queen"" to his motto ""Every Man a King,"" though ""girl"" seems un-feminist to those in the ""post-post-post"" era.  The narrator says Long did not ""race-bait"" in his speeches and the work includes one African-American interviewee.  Nevertheless, more could have been said.  Burns, in the past, has said racial relations are essential to American history and that he tries to focus upon it in every work, but this did not happen here.  President Woodrow Wilson created all kinds of measures to help working-class people, yet he was profoundly anti-black.  This work never says if Huey Long was different.  This lacuna is a problem.

This work begins with showing many people who loved him and it ends with showing many people who hated him.  I wonder if this love-hate dynamic was there all along.  Modern viewers may relate as President Bush, Jr. is said to be loved or hated by most.  Long predicted his murder, just as Malcolm X would three decades later.  This work basically said Long had one assassin, but Wikipedia suggests that one of his bodyguards may have accidentally shot and killed Long.

Part of me wonders if Long is history that could not repeat itself.  He's loud like Traficante, who was booted from office, and is now in prison.  He was a maverick like Howard Dean, who was quickly dismissed as ""un-presidential.""  He was a populist like Jesse Ventura, another chin dimple owner, who only had a few years in office.  It's harder now for politicians to rock the boat like he did, especially a Robin Hood-type like Long.  Though the past may be the past, I was pleased by learning of this deceased elected official.",1161302400,5,2807,4.834033613445378
769409,5,6304048718,"It starts of with the question, everyone who watches this DVD wants to see answered. The intro of the DVD in that respect is very very nice. So who is or was Huey Long? It turns out the answer does not depend on who is asking, but more on who the question is asked to. The Anglo-American establishment such as the Buro- and Aristo-crats all say : ""We were always discussing how to get rid of this guy""  The poor and middle class people in Louisiana however all adored Huey Long, as during the documentary it turns out that Huey Long, a very intelligent man, had only one objective, and that was to diminish the power and influence of the big corporations such as e.g. Standard Oil. The problem with Huey Long was that he used dictatorial governmental tactics, which at that time were used by e.g. Mussolini but never the less widely accepted in the 1930's. The Buro- and Aristo-crats didn't like this at all of course, because they were exactly the target to be diminished by Huey Long. The poor people of course we very carried away with him, not only because of his famous speeches, but also because this man was one of very few who really could have succeeded in his objective. In this respect his assassination was a sure thing to come, because the covert elitist organizations, who without doubt also killed JFK, will never allow a Fisher King to liberate and prosper the ordinary people.

If you want to know _all_ about Huey Long, also get the book ""Huey Long"" by T. Harry Williams.",1127520000,5,1489,4.511111111111111
769410,5,6304048718,"One really is left wondering ""what might have been"" after watching this splendid documentary of one of the most compelling figures in 20th century US politics.  I have my doubts that Huey Long could have wrestled the 1936 presidential nomination away from FDR (a far more adroit politician who knew as well as anyone how to marginalize his foes), but what would have the 1940 elections brought?  Huey Long might never have had the national following to get the nomination, but he would have been a force to be reckoned with within the Democratic party.

How he reached this level of power is fascinating.  Relatively unschooled but with political instincts second to none in Louisiana, Long could have written the book on the consolidation of power.  The Long Machine is not unique --- there have been other statewide machines such as the Cameron Machine in Pennsylvania, for example --- but the swiftness with which Long's organization rose to power is unparalleled.  Even more amazing was the fact that he had sizeable opposition within Louisiana who knew exactly what he was trying to do, and yet Long was still able to outmaneuver his foes!

Clearly it is pretty easy to paint Long as an utterly corrupt dictator, and not a few of the talking heads in this documentary do exactly that.  I could have done without Arthur Schlesinger Jr. (evidently taking time off from being the official Camelot court historian and Kennedy apologist) self-righteously pronouncing judgement on Huey Long, even though Long deserved it --- but that is neither here nor there.  The fact that Long was a thoroughly unsavory autocrat does not explain the popular appeal he had which lasts to this very day.  Burns, to his eternal credit, devotes a not inconsequential amount film to interviews with ordinary people who recall all the wonderful things Huey Long did for the have-nots in the state.  Look into their eyes --- you can see genuine affection for the man, decades after his death.

All of this leaves the viewer with no easy answers, which is fine with me.  History is rarely a black-and-white proposition, and we should not pretend that it is so.  Did the good deeds of the man excuse his corruption and hunger for power?  What is the benefit of democracy if the have-nots always lose and suffer?  Some countries have had the chance to choose tyranny because it least it meant that every citizen would have his or her basic needs met, and to them it was worth sacrificing civil liberties.  It hasn't happened often in the US, but it did happen once upon a time in Louisiana.  Ken Burns does a splendid job of telling the story.",1115164800,26,2619,4.782222222222222

Burns shows that while Huey used powers that often bordered on the dictatorial, he did a lot for his state during the Depression and was loved by the poor who had been ignored for years.
After watching it, I was most struck by the vicious hatred aristocrats and others had for the Kingfish.  These people expressed glee at Long's assasination and noted that many of them had plotted to kill him on numerous occassions.  The reason that this is so noteworthy is because Long is often savaged by historians (such as Arthur Schlesinger on the DVD who labeled Huey ""sinister""), but they often fail to mention that Huey needed to be politically heavy-handed to deal with the similarly powerhungry artistocrats and machine politicians that had total control of Louisiana before the Kingfish was elevated to the governorship.

My immediate thought was how in the name of perdition does a convicted felon get to run for public office?

""Huey Long: A Film by Ken Burns"" provides just what you would expect from America's premier documentarian: extensive archival footage mixed with recollections from Louisianans who knew Long and commentary from celebrated talking heads such as historian Arthur M. Schlessigner, Jr., journalist I. F. Stone, and, of course, author Robert Penn Warren, whose novel ""All the King's Men"" was a fictional retelling of the rise and fall of Huey P. Long.  The balance between Long's supporters and opponents, between his own rhetoric and the verdict of history, and between his political accomplishments and his quest for an American dictatorship, is quite impressive.  As a viewer you understand why the man was so popular with his ""Every Man a King"" and ""Share-the-Wealth"" programs and also how dangerous he was as a political demagogue.
Huey Long's quest for the White House remains one of the great ""what ifs"" of American politics in the 20th century.  My opinion has always been that Long could not have mounted a successful challenge to FDR in the 1936 election.  The techniques of bribery, intimidation, and coercion that Long used so effectively in his home state to be both Governor and U.S. Senator at the same time, would not have worked outside the borders of Louisiana (although I have little doubt he would have tried).  Long would also have to contend with Roosevelt's own formidable charisma as well as the machinery of the Democratic Party and the enmity of every other Democratic politician in the rest of the country.  However, this point is certainly debatable and one of the reasons Long remains such an intriguing figure, especially when you are considering the American variant of fascism from the first half of the 20th century.
This 88-minute documentary is nominated by David McCullogh, and there is a point where ""Ashokan Farewell"" pops up and you have to remind yourself that this documentary on ""Huey Long"" came out before ""The Civil War"" made Ken Burns a household name.  This is a first rate documentary that provides a fairly objective portrait of a complex and controversial man, as well as the era in which he lived and the power politics that made Long a legend.",1042848000,4,2704,4.882096069868996
769415,5,6304048718,"Although forgotten or largely discounted today as a political aberration,  Huey Long came closer to becoming a total dictator than any other American.  This film by Ken Burns brings the power and presence of Long into its  proper context of a poor and desperate state in the throes of a crippling  depression. Burns illustrates this documentary with excellent interviews  with Long's contemporaries, constituents, friends and opponents. There is  also revealing footage of Long himself that reflects his intended image of  a ""countrified buffoon,"" which caused his enemies to  underestimate him. This doucmentary brings Long back to life as a veritable  dictator who might have won the presidency if not for his  assassination.
The film's main strength lies in its balanced approach to  this controversial figure. Although Burns interviewed many of Long's  enemies, he also sought the opinion of the average Louisiana citizen who  benefited from Long's provision of free school books and hospital care.  These people were Long's source of strength of power who still regard him  as a great man and never cared how Long managed to give them these things.  Again, Burns balances the man who provided relief to a struggling people,  and the dictator who compromised decomcracy in order to provide that  relief.

7860280,5,6304048718,"Ken Burns does some great documentaries and this one is no exception.

Though most folks either loved or hated Huel Long - I think Burns presented facts in an unbiased way - neither praising or condemning beyond presenting actual events and using historical newsreel footage.

Did Huey Long do some great things for the state of Louisiana and the people of that state? Without a doubt.
Did Huey Long also do a lot for himself, his ego, and his career? I think that is clear as well.

I would like to see more about Long's ""assassination"" as I think there is a lot left unsaid there. Certainly, Long was an ambitious man - to the point of making himself a target. The movie doesn't get into the ""wealthy"" people who obviously took a beating at Long's hands - though it does address the hundreds (thousands?) of state employees who ""donated"" to his political war chest.

7860286,1,6304048718,"Isn't it funny how political rebels aren't long to live when they cross the wrong person? This was (nearly) from beginning to end, an unprofessional ""hit piece"" against the long-dead Huey Long of Louisiana. Any positives that Burns was loathe to mention, he'd counter with 4-5 negative rumors and innuendo, just to try and continue beating the Two Party System drum.

Burns went out of his way to make the pro-Long crowd look and sound like back-water, uneducated hicks, as they stood in front of their defunct front porches, or in their sparse homes. This was clever, but obvious nonetheless. Any academics or pro-FDR ""shoe shine boys"" presenting their ""learned"" opinions (lol) spoke with book cases and high-quality wallpaper flanking them. However, the good southerners who actually lived in and benefited from Long's programs, were filmed in an attempt to display stereotypical, uneducated squalor -- black and white.

Lending his snooty, elitist, upper-crust bow tie-wearing condescension is Arthur Schlesinger, who serves as the occasional cheerleader for the pro-communist FDR regime. All through this ""documentary,"" Burns went to pains to shine shoes of freemason crooks like FDR while constantly floating rumors of bribes and abuse by Long. Mind you, never a sideways word against His Royal Highness FDR occurred during this complete abortion of a ""documentary.""

About the last 30 minutes of this trash goes to laughable lengths to talk about how Huey Long was a dead man walking, so many assassination plots afoot, he knew his days were numbered, ""oh he was so hated"" and on and on and on. I grew up in Louisiana in the 1980s and adults I grew up around were poor and eternally grateful for all of Long's programs, free hospitals and care for the forgotten people of Louisiana. Huey was killed in 1935 and over 50 years later, not only were his generous programs STILL in working order, but people knew damn well who had made them all possible. But this ""hit piece"" goes on and on about how Long was going to become a ""dictator"" as if the US president didsn't ALREADY have dictatorial powers since even before Lincoln.

Whether you approve of Long's brand of populist politics, he was a man who did more for the poor of Louisiana during his lifetime than any continuous string of freemason elitist scumbags have done during the history of the United States. The biggest ""danger"" Huey Long ever posed towards the United States, was the clear and present danger to its pampered, elitist power structure. He was a real possibility as a legitimate 3rd Party candidate and the comfy cozy Republicans and Democrats couldn't tolerate such an enemy.",1463529600,5,2652,4.979683972911964
