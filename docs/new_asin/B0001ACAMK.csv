8225326,5,B0001ACAMK,"I think this concert has captured Tina at her best. It was recorded right before her return to mega stardom. Her voice is at it's prime. The lady can wail like the best of them. And can she move. You really have to be in good shape to sing and dance at the same time, like Tina. Just watching her I loose my breath. (And start to sweat!!) The singing, dancing, and ""teasing"" thats done on ""Proud Mary"" show's one of the many reasons why we love Tina. Pure, Raw, Rough, Wild and really SEXY!! You must buy this tape as it is quite hard to find. I just wish it has been released on DVD. A must for all Tina fans. Nuff said.",1204588800,3,621,4.016129032258065
