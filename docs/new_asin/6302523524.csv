476911,5,6302523524,This is one of the best videos to teach children the Ten Commandments. This video is great for ages Pre-K to 5th grade and really shows the children what the Ten Commandments mean.  It's very upbeat and the music is fantastic in helping the children remember.,1253145600,,259,4.630434782608695
476912,5,6302523524,"This video was a favorite of our 3 sons back in 1984!  We had it for years...until our boys met a playmate who didn't know the Lord.  They asked if they could give it to him (becuase he used to come to the house and ask to watch it all the time!) and so we did.  Here we are, 2008, our 3 sons are now married with kids of their own, and ""grandma"" is here purchasing it once again...but for the grandkids now! :)  What a joy!  Your kids will love it too!

(PS. You might want to check out Psalty the Psalm Book videos too.  They were also great!)",1211673600,3,545,3.9
476913,5,6302523524,"A grandma at church loaned us a box of tapes.  We have had this one for 2 years now.  We sing it all the time!  Helps with lessonas of faith and spelling!  L-I-E-S, L-I-E-S spells Lies, Lies!  What a soundtrack.  I will try to buy this one day to have in my family forever even though it is the more American Protestent numbering than the Evangelical numbering, still an opportunity to explain the difference to my child.  The plot is so enjoyable, makes it clear what each one means.  Wish we still had stuff like this on ABC.",1157760000,,527,4.3061224489795915

7827177,5,6302523524,"I loved this movie as a kid (now I'm 34).. watched it over and over and over until the tape wore out and the box fell apart. Found the movie on YouTube and burned it to DVD, but it just wasn't the same as watching that VHS. I just remembered about this movie last night before going to bed and I started looking for it today, hoping to find it so I could share it with my friend's child, too, and I'm so glad I did! :)",1509321600,,418,3.8160919540229883

7827179,5,6302523524,"My husband had this movie as a kid and my kids watched bits and pieces of it on youtube. I have been looking everywhere for this movie and am so grateful to have found it.

7827185,5,6302523524,"I grew up watching this video, I don't know when my family got it but it is one of the first videos I remember watching. I hope they bring it out on DVD or Blu-ray so that it survives. I plan to have my children watch it one day, when I finally get married and start one. If you haven't seen this show it is great for any family who wants to instill th ten commandments upon their children's hearts and not just in their minds.",1328745600,3,427,3.9767441860465116
