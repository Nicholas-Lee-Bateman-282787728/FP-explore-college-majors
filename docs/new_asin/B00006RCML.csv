1787151,5,B00006RCML,"I am really happy with this purchase. I really like Leslie Sansone and i like the walk away the pounds for Abs, and I also love the belt that came with it too!",1235433600,,159,3.8484848484848486
1787152,5,B00006RCML,"The first thing I noticed when I tried this set is they've changed the belt.  In the beginning of the video, she explains how to attach the resistance bands to the handles. Well, mine came already attached with little plastic clips, so they've changed the belt they supply.  As far as other people reporting their belts/bands broke, if the clips break, I can probably rig up something to reattach them; if the bands lose their stretch, I'll probably snip them and replace them if I still want to use the belt. So far, they're holding strong!  One note: the plastic clips started making an annoying clicking sound but I soon realized that if I maintain resistance (like you're supposed to...) instead of letting it go slack between reps I don't have that problem.  For what I paid, I have no complaints if the belt breaks - you usually tend to wear those things out anyway, or even outgrow them.

On to the actual workouts - I don't really notice a strong focus on abs, other than the belt helps remind you to keep your abs engaged and promotes good posture - all things that will help tone your abs, but I still don't think of this as an ""ab workout""  However, the belt/bands DO give an excellent upper body workout, especially for someone like me who's looking for that extra toning.  I felt it in my arms, shoulders, and back muscles, and it felt great!  Overall, I recommend this set - it's a great addition to my workout videos.",1235001600,,1432,4.501930501930502

1787154,5,B00006RCML,"Walk away the pounds, for the abs, is great.  Really gets you moving and it is a great starting place for beginners (start with the one mile walk).  I have had two shoulder surgeries so the belt is allowing me to strengthen my arms and shoulders.  She explains all the steps ahead of time so you know exactly what you are supposed to do which I find so helpful.  Other videos (Denise Austin) just starts and you are supposed to follow.  Doesn't work!  You will not make a mistake by ordering this video by Leslie Sansone, or any of her videos.  She is great!  Happy walking!",1233360000,,574,4.349056603773585

1787176,5,B00006RCML,"This is a good workout, and I enjoy using the belt.  It is a different variation of Leslie's other work-outs. I have read that the belt breaks so I am waiting to see how long mine will hold out.  I can tell that I am getting a good cardio work-out.  I have only used this for 2 weeks and so I am waiting to see how much improvement in my abs that I might see.",1228348800,,359,3.76

At the end of the 3 mile walk, I couldn't believe how good it felt and that I actually broke a real sweat. AWESOME purchase; I will be purchasing more of this product. This product outstands the firm, turbo jam, and all the crunch products I have purchases over the years. I was able to participate all the way through without feeling intimidated, fatigued, in pain, and completely exhausted after the workout; yet i felt it really working my muscles. This is definitely the right product for home gyms.",1228176000,,610,4.605504587155964
1787178,4,B00006RCML,Luckily I have not experienced any issues with my belt. I enjoy this workout much better than the ones without the band. I try and do it 3-4 times a week and I've gotten some great results. I would recommend this video for anyone who likes low impact workouts.,1216166400,,260,4.326530612244898
1787179,5,B00006RCML,"The 3 in 1 disk for walking inside up to 3 miles with the abs belt is outstanding! What an acomplishment in the realm of physical therapy. I live out in the forrest and high desert at 5,000 ft. I do quite a variety of movements outside while splitting wood manuely, raking pine needles, walking the dogs which requires my soul attention since the neighbors happened to be cattle and the dogs think they're just other big dogs.
Yet I don't seems to lose I've gone from 125 lbs. to 190 within a 2 year period after quiting the smoking habit.
I was going to have the Lap-Band process done if qualified, but with this program I think I'll try this alone first.
My girlfriend went from size 18 to 12 in less than 2 months, her idea is that she'll eat what she wants when she wants and pay for the priveledge by extending her workout. Letting the punishment be equal to the crime.
Good luck to all that venture into this catagory of exercise.
Walk away the fluff with this program and smile even during winter. Remember there are other people just like us trying hard to slim down.

1787182,5,B00006RCML,"This product is fabulous.  If you use it, it will work.  I had Leslie's workout in tape format and purchased the DVDs.  I use them and I love them.  I highly recommend them.",1208131200,,173,4.151515151515151
1787183,5,B00006RCML,"I absolutely LOVE Leslie.  This DVD has 3 workouts with the Walk-Away Belt.  While you don't use the belt the whole time, it absolutely does work wonders!",1203638400,,154,4.666666666666667
1787184,4,B00006RCML,"I've done a lot of Walk Away the Pounds DVDs trying to decide if I like the program and eventually bought this one. Unlike most DVD workouts I tried you don't have to learn any moves or memorize the order of the steps. There are no surprises and even if you get distracted you can just fall right back into step. Leslie is very motivating and encouraging. You also never feel like you can't keep up. She always encourages you to go at your own pace, but pushes you to dig in a little deeper if you're up to it. Even the same workout can yield a different experience just on how I feel that day, which means I'm more willing to stick to my schedule because I can go light on days I don't feel very motivated. If you're thinking about purchasing I would definitely recommend getting a 1,2,3 mile set like this one because I have found you can keep to a routine much better when its flexible. Plus if I put more energy in to the 2 mile I feel just as good as when I do the 3 mile. I love the belt that comes with this set too. The combination upper body workout and walking workout make these workouts much more favorable in my opinion as well. The belt is great because you do feel like you are using your core while you extend your arms because you are resisting the belt in two different directions at the same time. The only thing I don't like is that the belt that came with my set is not adjustable. I had to tie a knot in the cords to up the resistance.

Over all, I would highly recomend this product to those who aren't very keen on exercise and have a hard time sticking to a routine and need some motivation.",1194480000,,1616,4.130158730158731
1787185,4,B00006RCML,"I have four of Leslie Sansone's WATP videos.  I also have dozens of other cardio workout videos, but Leslie Sansone's are, by far, the simplest to follow.  I don't have the belt for the abs videos, as they were given to me, sans belt...but it works just fine without the belt, or with hand weights as a replacement.
I try to do one of her ""walks"" every morning, as well as any time I think I need an extra boost to get through the day.  I highly recommend her videos to beginners, especially; but they are good for people of any fitness level.",1193356800,2,543,4.252427184466019

Although diet has helped also, I would not be where I am today without these great workouts. Thank you, Leslie Sansone.",1174953600,2,444,4.493827160493828
1787188,5,B00006RCML,"After reading the previous reviews regarding the belt, I was hesitant to purchase this set. I'm glad I did. I have been walking with Leslie for about six months and I am currently following Leslie's Walk Away The Pounds book. The Ab Belt is added to the program in the 4th week. The belt I bought in Feb. 2007 is sturdier than the model shown in the DVD and the tubes are more secure. I find it works my abs and look forward to seeing the results as I continue using it.

I like the workout as well. I was happy to see most of the same ""walk buddies"" she has had on her Express and WATP DVDs, and I enjoy the conversations they have. I hardly recognized Cat and Wendy from their previous Express appearances. They look great! I actually was introducing them to my husband as ""my walking team!""",1173312000,6,793,4.251655629139073

1787190,5,B00006RCML,I am new to the WATPs exercise but I really love it.  I am definitely noticing results after 1 month of religious usage.  I haven't dropped many lbs but all my clothes are loose and my middle is getting smaller.  I do the 1 mile on the days I have to go to work (3 days) and I use the 3 mile on the days that I am off.

I've decided I liked it enough to go ahead and spend the money for the DVD's. The reason for 4 rather than 5 stars is the belt. The belt broke pretty quickly I wrote to the company they sent a replacement but it also broke.  So to rectify the problem, I bought my own resistance bands at a sporting goods store, cut it in half and attached it to the belt and handles and this has worked fine and it gives a little more resistance which I find better for myself.",1155081600,3,627,4.208333333333333

1787193,4,B00006RCML,"The belt is great to use to with all of the walk away the pounds workouts because just having it around your waist creates extra resistance against the abs.

It's nice that all three workouts are on one video & the belt comes with it. Great value!

1787194,5,B00006RCML,"I have been a fan of Leslie's for a few years, and this set is probably my favorite. Since there are 3 separate discs, you can do as little or as much as you want. The 1 mile takes only 15 minutes,so you can never say you don't have time to exercise. If you love the 3-mile, but don't have 45 minutes, you can skip some and go to the cool down. The belt is great, and if it gets easy, you can shorten it to get more resistance, and/or use wrist or ankle weights. And if you don't feel like using the belt at all, you still get a good workout if you follow her directions. Each half-mile is indicated on the screen, and Lelie talks through the whole thing, so it really seems to fly by. Sometimes you just wish she'd be quiet, but then she's onto something else, and it just flows. I even used this last year when I had a cast-just sat in a chair with a weight on my good leg, moved my legs as much as I could and did the upper body-and trust me, I am not an exercise fanatic. She just makes me smile while I sweat!",1129334400,5,1014,3.9271844660194173

I also noticed that my belt seems a little different than the one they are using in the video, so perhaps they have improved it.",1126483200,7,379,4.428571428571429
1787197,5,B00006RCML,"Checkout my advice on how to make a resistance belt on the review for WATP for ABS 1 & 2 Mile DVD - it has worked fantastically over the 6 months or so since I bought WATP for Abs DVD's only . Being in Australia I was unable to buy the resistance belt so I had to make my own . Mine is so good that (a) it doesn't move , full stop , when you pull on the cords (b)have medium strength resistance cords give me a much better workout (c)won't break unless I cut the cords . This WATP for the ABs is my favourite workout as I like the music on it and I like working with the resistance cords - I prefer the resistance cords to the stretchie band thing . And I just love Leslie Sansone - all her workouts are so easy to follow that even a klutz like me ( I almost tripped whilst attempting a ""grapevine"" move) can keep up with it . Her DVDs are the only exercise ones that I do 3 to 5 times a week - I've just about given up on all the others like Kathy Smith who is just too fast for me .",1113350400,7,984,3.735576923076923
1787198,4,B00006RCML,"I orginally purchased the workout for me and my husband was watching me workout and was interested in trying for the indoor walking type exercise. My husband and I love to walk and he is not coordinated for all the fad workout videos like ""Kick boxing"".

As all the other reviews we had the same thing happen, we went through two belts. The latex rubber drys out and eventually breaks from the heavy pulling and stretching which ours took only 3 weeks. After a while the resistance becomes too easy and you start to pull too hard on the belt and it breaks! The concept is good because you feel you are getting an upper body workout like you do if you were using a nautilus machine at your health club. My husband and I after ordering the for the second time which took 8 weeks to order. After the 2nd belt broke I just went to a Target store and purchased a Reebok long stretch band in two resistant levels. We folded in half and looped it through the attachment loop on the old belts. We use a heavy rubber band to make the band shorter for our resistance level as we need to. I purchased the advanced band for my husband and the intermediate for me. This has worked for us for over a year and they have not broken yet! One good thing about it the Reebok stretch band is made out of rubber tubing and only costed us $9.99 each. We would like to see the walkaway belt made out of better tubing and maybe have the optional attachement of different resistance level bands that can be detachable. Otherwise we both enjoy the walking workouts and both of us have had good results in loosing weight. You must do it everyday to see results. My husband and I do the workouts together if you have an extra belt on hand. I find this being a good workout for a couple to do together and gives you more quality time together and saves on the cost of an expensive health club. We both have found if you have the right resistance band on your belt you do see the results on your stomach,toning of upper body and weight loss. We both give it a 4 stars just because such a poor design and quality of the belts that come with the videos. Otherwise this walking program is good. If the 3 mile gets to easy in this set, It is worth purchasing her walkaway the pounds 4 mile video.",1106092800,8,2262,4.236111111111111
1787199,4,B00006RCML,"Even with its quirks, WATP for the Abs still works!

Ok, I've read a lot of the reviews, so I thought that my ""2 cents"" might help someone make the decision to invest or not invest in this set.

I bought the set-2 DVDs, one with the 1 and 2-mile and the other with the 3-mile.  No belt came with my DVD set, but that was what I wanted since the other reviews discussed the belt's drawbacks and short lifespan.

Leslie's still her cute, talkative, and happy self.  She keeps me motivated.  The routines are simple, like everyone else has said, and my boy Randy is doing his thing in the back!  The crew is mostly new to me, and they are not the most coordinated bunch.  People, including Leslie, get offbeat or off of the correct foot.  It is easy to get back in time, though.

I love the fact that with these DVDs I don't feel unpleasant cramps in my calves at the end from the lunge stretches that we do with the regular WATP videos.  The squats are a great addition.

Now on to this belt.  I use the 2-lb. weights from the original videos.  They are heavier, but I'm fairly strong so I use them when Leslie uses the belt.  People have talked about the belt breaking and everything.  Check this out on the 2-mile DVD.  Go to just before the 1/2-mile point.  Look at the lady in the back on the right.  Her name is Jo.  Watch her.  Does her belt break?  I just noticed this today, and I use the 2-mile DVD on the regular!  It was so funny.  I was tempted to stop the DVD and watch it, but I figured that that would not be good for my body.  SO, I went back and viewed it.  A long piece of resistance cord hangs by her left side.  It is so pitiful.  She fumbles and fidgets with the belt and looks so defeated.  Jo gets off beat and tries to adjust the stupid thing.  At one point, she fakes it with one handle!  Sometimes she uses both of them, with no cords.  Then she pulls a Randy and just does the arm movement without the handles at all.  By the time the full mile is reached, it looks as if she has a new belt.  Oh and let's not talk about Wendy and the belt that engulfs her like a hula-hoop!

Alright, with all of that said, I still do the videos because I see and feel the results.  Although other people may not notice, I notice and that's all that matters to me.  I can feel when I haven't done the videos for a few days.  My thighs feel like they get wider or something, and my stomach seems like it loses its firmness.

Check these videos out for yourself.  If there's a way to borrow them from the library, try them at no cost to you.  Even with its quirks, WATP for the Abs still works!",1097107200,40,2601,4.071287128712871
1787200,2,B00006RCML,"Leslie is the queen of walking workouts. Her tapes leave you with no excuse not to exercise. They are simple, you can do them at home rain or shine and they are quick.
I enjoy many of Leslie's tapes but found the Walk Away The Pounds for Abs tape to be less than her best.
The walks are Leslie's usual walks with easy movements, sidesteps, marches etc. This particular set includes a l mile, 2 mile or 3 mile walk on one DVD. A resistance belt, recipe cards and a small booklet with a suggested walking workout schedule. The problem is with the WATP's belt.
The tapes are marketed as walks that work your abs. You put a velcro belt around your waist and pull on the resistance bands attached to the belt. One band per arm. This does not work your abs at all. It works your arms. Sadly it also strains the muscles in your back. Not a good thing.
The ab belts are not well made and many folks have been sad to discover theirs have broken with just a few uses. To rectify this the manufacturer of the belt now makes them so the bands have a very light resistance. This way there is not a lot of tension on the bands, so they are less likely to break. Naturally, this also means your arms are not going to get a workout either.
You could do the workouts without the bands and just use light weights but why would you when Leslie offers so many other workouts to choose from.
Unless you want a sore back skip these tapes and select something else.",1090108800,49,1442,4.209386281588448
1787201,4,B00006RCML,"I first discovered Leslie Sansone's workout videos at the local library.  I tried them all and liked the walk away the pounds for abs the best.  She does not incorporate any intensely difficult steps and she is a gentle but uplifting instructor.  She has a fit but not perfect body and the music is ""canned"" but with good beats.  Her laughter is infectious and her smile is warm.  All these elements help me to put my DVD in and ENJOY the workout.  My husband bought me the 3 DVD set with belt as a Valentine present - and I really like them.  The ONLY regret I have is that the DVDs are not set up by chapters - I can't jump ahead to the cool down by clicking to it, I have to ""fast forward"" just like a video.  That's unfortunate.  Other than that, I like having all three ""videos"" on DVD so I can choose whatever I feel like doing.  The belt is an easy way to add variety to the workout and I also use 1.5 lb hand weights when I'm feeling super strong.  I have gone from 210 lbs to 177 eating healthy (NOT the Atkin's diet), smaller portions and exercising.  Leslie Sansone's DVDs are a great investment for a beginner or a moderate exerciser.

They are all wonderfully invigorating, but I love the abs program the best. I never feel exhausted after completing the workout, and my whole body feels the blood flowing and the energy level rising. For years, I walked for 45 minutes a day outside, and on a treadmill in the long New England winter, listening to books on tape to keep the boredom away. But these workouts utilize the upper body as well as the lower, and really do get the endorphins flowing. Of course, being able to keep it up during the winter, and to vary the level among the the 1,2,3, and 4 mile walks is very helpful in terms of sustaining motivation. I am 57 years old, mother of three grown kids, and a bit overweight. This workout is helping with weight loss, but more importantly, my whole mind set has been improved by the exercise regimen, and I actually look forward to my workout session each day. I can't praise Leslie highly enough for her style-minimal chit chat, pleasant and sincere in her manner.

The belts have very weak rubber bands.  They don't support the strain of pulling; they break easily.  Once broke, the set is worthless.

1787222,5,B00006RCML,"I have many workout videos on my shelf, but until I discovered Leslie Sansone's Walk Away tapes, they mostly just collected dust.  The wonderful thing about Leslie's in-home walking workout is that it is easy (no difficult choreography or quick movement changes to confuse you), fast (you can choose the 15-min:1 mile, 30-min:2 mile, or 45-min:3 mile depending on how much time you have), and effective!  Using both Weight Watchers and daily 2 or 3 mile walks, I have managed to lose 15 lbs. in 5 weeks!
While this might not be the best choice for someone looking for a super high-energy workout, it is perfect for those who prefer a no frills way to exercise out some stress and calories.  Also nice is the fact that her exercise crew represents all body types - while there a few ""perfect"" figures, there are also those who may look more like you or me.
I like the walk-away belt; it provides just enough tension to work the muscles of your arms and back without burning you out.  I've never had a problem with the belt, though I'm skeptical of Leslie's assertion that it will help tone your abs just by wearing it during the workout...I've yet to see it.
All in all, I will never buy another workout video again, and am getting rid of all the others I own.  If a busy stay-at-home mom can finally make the time to exercise daily - and ENJOY it - what other endorsement does it need?!",1045353600,29,1386,4.462450592885376

1787224,5,B00006RCML,"Please note that some of the other reviews may be misleading because they got the wrong DVD. This was probably a manufacturer's error, so please do not base your decision on those mistakes, which have nothing to do with the video.
Mine has the correct DVD, in which Leslie shows you how to use the belt. My only complaint is the actual belt. Leslie goes on about how the fact that the belt is tight around your waist (yes, your waist, not your hips-- she makes that clear, I think) is enough to work your abs. Now I don't feel like I got an ab workout from this video. I also had a problem (please don't hate me) with the way the belt fits-- it is way too big for me! I am not a model, but I have a smaller than usual waist, and I have to pull it as tight the Velcro will close it and then tuck the slack in, which gets a little scratchy at times. Other than those complaints, though, the belt is great for arms. I never did the video with the weight ball, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I like the elastics.
Otherwise, I like this DVD a lot! I have not yet done the 3-mile (frankly, I don't have the time), but I LOVE the 2-mile workout. The 1-mile is good if you are out of shape, but for those who are slightly athletic, it is too easy. If you only have time to do a mile (15 minutes), then do the 1st or 2nd half of the 2-mile workout. The 2-mile workout is 30 minutes (and the 3-mile follows suit at 45 minutes), and it goes SO fast! Today I planned on doing half of the 2-mile and ended up doing the whole thing because it went so fast. This video has NO FANCY STEPS, I promise! If you can walk and do small kicks and knee lifts (which Leslie demonstrates), you can do this video. She never even does the ""grapevine,"" a normal aerobic workout staple. This DVD is really great for those of us who have done boring and/or torturous workout videos only to retire them all too quickly.
As you may notice, I have reviewed a lot of Denise Austin tapes. I love Denise, but Leslie is a great change from her. So, Denise Austin haters, rejoice! Leslie is motivational without being overly enthusiastic or annoying. I like that there are a lot of other people (big change from Denise) of many shapes and sizes and that Leslie actually talks to them as opposed to their being decoration for the star of the show. She keeps the banter to a minimum, though, so as not to detract from the workout at hand. Leslie asks them how they feel as the video goes on, so you almost feel like you are in the room with them. It truly motivates me to put it back in and do it again the next day.
So even though I have my issues with the belt, some of which are due to my body type, I really think this is a great workout for both the upper and lower body. If you really want great abs, then I recommend any of Denise Austin's ab videos (10 minute segments are great).
ADDITION...  I have since been doing the 3-mile segment daily for the past two weeks.  I love it!  It works so much more muscle than even the two-mile segment.  Awesome, awesome awesome.",1044403200,11,3043,4.126475548060708

The tapes themselves are great, especially for those not in the greatest shape but who are willing to work! The ab belt really does increase the intensity of the workout and the amount it makes me sweat, too, although it's prone to snapping if you pull too hard or too suddenly. While the belt didn't seem to decrease my waistline all that much, I did tighten up my upper abdomen just below the bustline. In turn, my posture is better, I've been told I look taller--and thereby, thinner! My button-front blouses fit better, too. My endurance is greater for walking, in general, and I've especially noticed a difference in taking the stairs, much less wheezing after the 4 flights to my office!
The only reason I knocked this down to 4 stars is that I felt as if the distributor is deliberately trying to misrepresent the tapes as being new ones, since, as I said, their release date is listed as December 2002 and the videotape cover shots show Leslie Sansone in different exercise outfits than on the tapes I bought earlier, but the tapes--and I checked all 3 of them to be certain--are the exact same ones that were released earlier (in 2001 I think, at least that's when I bought my 1st set of these). I felt cheated, since they appeared to be new versions--which I really looked forward to!

1787230,3,B00006RCML,"If you enjoyed Leslie Sansone's Walk Away The Pounds workouts, here is a new variation for you.
The kit includes a Walk Away Belt, and a DVD. The DVD has three workouts on it:
- 1 mile
- 2 mile
- 3 mile
Each of the workouts includes the same basic steps that were used in the Walk Away The Pounds set:
- kick backs
- knee lifts
- kicks
- side steps
- and of course, walking
There are no new steps introduced. If you have done the Walk Away workouts, you can do these workouts. They are not much different. The people walking with Leslie are mostly new. For example, in the 3-mile walk, you'll see Randy (who was in the old workouts). The music is new, and updated for today. This is not a recycled, older product like the Miracle Mile and 4-Mile Walk.
The 3-mile workout uses the belt only minimally. For an ""ab"" workout, I was shocked not to have crunches and sit-ups. Leslie uses the belt to work the upper body, but does not explain what this belt does for your abs, or how to use the belt. How is it supposed to be worn? Sitting on your hips or on your waist? How can the same upper body moves we used in the old workouts work the abs?
The 3-mile walk is a good variation on the Walk Away The Pounds 3-mile walk. If you're bored with the old set, give this one a try. It is not necessary to use the belt, you can always go without it.",1040860800,37,1338,4.033834586466165

1787232,3,B00006RCML,"I'm a big fan of Leslie Sansone's original Walk Away the Pounds videos.  I have been using them every day for a little more than a month and have lost 13 pounds.  I have not so great coordination and two left feet and get frustrated trying to follow complicated aerobic routines.  With Leslie's workouts there are only four basic moves that just about anyone can do--stepping side to side, knee lifts, forward kicks and hamstring curls which Leslie calls ""kick backs"" (you kick your heel and calf backwards).  These are alternated with walking in place and occasionally arm movements are added.  Some have complained that the workout can get too repetitive and too boring but I suppose you could say the same of a treadmill.  It also may not be challenging enough for someone at an advanced level who wants a more high impact workout, but for someone who needs a really basic, easy-to-follow workout, Leslie's videos are highly recommended.
This set follows the same basic principles of the original Walk Away the Pounds, with walking alternated with the four moves mentioned above.  There is a 1-mile workout that lasts about 20 minutes, a 2-mile that goes for about 30 minutes, and a 3-mile walk that is 45 minutes.  What makes these workouts different from the original Walk Away the Pounds is that whereas the original workouts have you occasionally use weighted balls with the workout for added intensity and toning, in these walks you use a ""walk away belt,"" which is a resistance belt that is supposed to reduce and shape the waistline.  The belt has a velcro strap that wraps around your waist and two resistance cords with handles.  You wear the belt throughout the workout and at various times Leslie has you do exercises with the belt, such as pulling the cords over your head, out to the side, etc.
I've noticed that these workouts are faster paced than the original WATP videos.  For that reason I feel more challenged by this set and I seem to get a better workout.  Leslie spends much time proclaiming the wonders of the walk away belt, but I'm skeptical.  She seems to suggest that just wearing the belt throughout the workout will literally whittle down your waistline.  The belt does force you to hold your abs in and encourages better posture, which are certainly helpful for trying to get a flatter, toned tummy, but if your goal is ""six pack"" abs, then regular cardio work and crunches are going to be a lot more effective than this belt.  Also, the belts sold with the older editions of these videos were very poor quality and broke easily.  From what I've heard the belt has been improved and people who buy newer packages don't have as much trouble with the belt.

The music for these videos is a little better than her previous videos.  In some of Leslie's videos the music is so soft and subtle you can barely hear it, and these new abs videos do have music that is a little louder and a bit more energizing.  Still it's very generic musak-type stuff and these videos are definitely not the ones to buy if you want to workout to exciting music or the current hits.
If you've done the original Walk Away the Pounds and would like to purchase these to add a little variety to your workouts, they would work fine for that purpose.  The faster pace can be a nice challenge for those who feel the original workouts have become too easy.  Just don't believe all of the hype about the belt.",1040688000,3,3409,4.610927152317881

7972381,3,B00006RCML,"I don't know why it's so hard to find the original tape series on dvd, but this was as close as I could get, and even the Mile 1 dvd wasn't the same as the original Mile 1 tape. Also, I wouldn't blow extra money on the belt. The bands don't provide much resistance at all, the belt slides around during any cross body movements, and it's pretty much just plain annoying and gets in the way. I prefer to use light dumbbells for all the band moves, and it makes a perfectly fun workout.",1415318400,,484,4.105263157894737
7972382,5,B00006RCML,"If you want to get into a good exercise program without having to get dressed for the weather this is the way to go.  You can choose the 1, 2 or 3 mile walk and the longest time you will spend is 45 minutes right in your own home.",1410393600,,230,3.693877551020408
7972383,5,B00006RCML,I love this basic walking workout.  I got it when it first came out in 2000 in VHS.  I have used it regularly over the years and have worn out the bands and replaced them numerous times.  I was worried that the VHS tapes were gonna wear out so I purchased it again in DVD.,1409788800,,272,3.909090909090909

7972386,5,B00006RCML,This is one of my favorite at home exercises. I work out almost everyday and I walk away the pound when ever I don't feel like doing high intense exercises.  It great on my knees and legs and I absolute love the walk away belt which helps tone my upper body!,1396396800,,258,4.0588235294117645
7972387,5,B00006RCML,I bought this for the belt. Leslie Sansone is so inspiring. She is easy to follow. Thank you so much.,1391904000,,101,4.1
7972388,5,B00006RCML,"This program is easy to do at home.  It is easy to step up with your workout with 3 different levels on one CD.  My sister has one, but the workouts were not separate with warm ups and cool down for each workout.  This one has each individual workout separate with the warm up and cool down.  Not for advanced atheletes, but good for people just starting out or for individuals who need to walk, but cannot do so due to inclement weather.",1380672000,,438,4.240963855421687
