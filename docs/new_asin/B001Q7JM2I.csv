I would recommend it to anyone who is struggling with PD or knows someone who is living with this disabling condition. It was both touching and hopeful at the same time.",1260576000,,256,4.565217391304348
8335118,3,B001Q7JM2I,"When this first started, I was worried that the work would only speak about the things that most viewers already know about Parkinson's.  However, in seeing how they speak about history, genetics, politics, cures, and mitigating factors, this work did seem well-rounded to me.

By showing Obama at the beginning of the work and not just focusing on Bush, the work tries to say, ""Hey!  We realize that the status quo on research this decade may change any second now.""  They later show Senator Boxer saying stem cell research was the first bill vetoed in six years of W's presidency.  The work also shows how Michael J. Fox's commercial for a Democratic Missouri candidate may have helped her win an election.  So the politics is still portrayed as crucial, rather than being ""yesterday's news.""

The work tries to be fair-minded as it showed a disabled man who still opposed stem cell research.  I never liked ""Family Ties"" or Fox's whiny voice, but seeing him here makes me appreciate him immensely.

The work spoke about the possible origins of the illness, however, something seemed missing.  Around the time that Fox came out as having the illness, a report said that two other cast members from a show he helped to make in Canada also have it.  Articles then questioned if it may be contagious and this documentary doesn't really pursue that.  In askig about genetics, the narrator stated that maybe the disease has North African or Viking roots.  Well, those I know who have it are not of those ethnic backgrounds.  I wonder if this may mislead viewers into thinking, ""Well, I'm not Scandinavian or Arab, so that'll never happen to me or anyone in my family!""  That would be truly problematic.

This work implied that until a cure is found, exercise has been helpful to sufferers.  So, be buying a treadmill if you can.",1238198400,,1825,4.761146496815287
