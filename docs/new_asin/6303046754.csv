He also has to find out who shot him and why.  The film follows the book fairly close.  If you like a lot of action, you will enjoy this video.",1006214400,13,314,4.065573770491803

This was most frustrating as he loves his westerns. This UK production company needs to check their products before listing them as playable in all areas of the world.",1446681600,,384,4.565217391304348

541018,3,6303046754,"""The Man Called Noon"" (1973) is a Spanish/Italian/English Western starring Richard Crenna as the eponymous character and Stephen Boyd as his pardner. After Noon suffers amnesia from being winged in the head and falling, he teams-up with Rimes (Boyd) and meets a woman named Fan (Rosanna Schiaffino), who takes a liking to him. Farley Granger and Patty Shepard are other characters in the story, which features a hidden cave and fortune.

Shot in Spain, the film has the cool style and music of Spaghetti Westerns of the time, but with an arguably better story and characters, likely because the script's based on a Louis L'Armour novel. Unfortunately, as the movie progresses its flaws surface, like an obvious smudge on the lens of one of the cameras, the inexplicable lights in the ""bat cave"" and an increasingly unbelievable vibe. Despite this, Crenna and Boyd are effective Western protagonists and Rosanna & Patty are agreeable female eye candy. Although mediocre overall, it's worth checking out if you like Westerns from the 60s/70s.

The film runs 98 minutes.

541019,5,6303046754,"Although I'm a big Western fan,I have read very little of Louis L'Amour's novels. For that reason ,I decided to give this movie a try. I gave it a 5* rating because of the movie itself;but as to the quality of the VHS,the reproduction was awful. Over and over again I simply couldn't understand what was being said. All the actors were unknown to me,but I found there were a couple of very good performances,especially that by Richard Crenna, who played the main role of Noon. The storyline is quite different from the run-of-the-mill Western. It is more like a combination of something Eastwood did with his Spaghetti Westerns and action scenes from a Sci- Fi adventure.
It is filled with lots of action and shooting scenes ,particularly the grand finale of destruction by bullets,fire and dynamite.
 I can't really comment on the music,because the sound quality of the video was real bad. I did like the photography,which was also more like Eastwood's than the Westerns before his influence.
 Overall, a very absorbing,thrilling and entertaining Western;but by all means,find a better reproduction to watch than this poor quality video. The VHS I watched was by Direct Source Special Products Inc. and had a Running Time of 87 minutes.",1416528000,2,1237,4.9423076923076925

541091,3,6303046754,"Have just watched the remastered version and thought I was in for a treat when the opening scenes stayed close to the book.  But extremely disappointed with the second half when even expected dramatic licence went over the top for Spaghetti western pyrotechnics.

I could only recommend to those whose challenge is to collect all Louis L'Amour based films as opposed to someone wanting a good western to watch.",1360022400,,410,4.927536231884058
541092,5,6303046754,"I purchased this years ago on VHS and love Crenna and Boyd as gunslingers of the old west.  But these DVDs selling for 20 and thirty plus dollars with shipping and taxes is a bit much.  By the time my old VHS wears out I will probably have outgrown my want to watch it.  The movie is a bit disjointed being an Italian film but still enjoyable if you follow the developing plot.  If you are a Crenna fan and choose to spend the money, you will not be disappointed.  Not as good as Catlow but unique.  I have enjoyed it from time to time so I gave it five stars but that is because I like Richard Crenna and Stephen Boyd.",1355356800,2,619,4.032786885245901

And I had forgotten how good an actor was Richard Crenna.  He had a long run in the industry, including Our Miss Brooks (both radio and TV iterations) through The Real McCoys and Rambo, and many others.  In this feature, not only are his acting chops on display, but the entire production is first-rate.  I highly recommend this Louis L'Amour-penned western.",1487030400,2,489,4.511363636363637
