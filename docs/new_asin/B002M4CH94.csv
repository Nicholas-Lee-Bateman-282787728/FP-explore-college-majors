If you really want to see a Twilight spoof movie go see Vampires Suck, despite the fact it was made by the guys who made meet the spartans, epic movie and other horrible movies it was really funny, easily the best spoof movie since the original scary movie.",1282608000,,406,4.217948717948718

It's essentially the quality of something a bunch of high schoolers would make: badly written, horribly shot (on an old camcorder, it looks like), with cheesy costumes, props, and fake mustaches. How this ended up on Amazon, let alone priced at $18, is beyond me. This is something that should be up on Youtube, not for sale on Amazon.

Meredith Host and Kurt Indovina both parodied their Twilight counterparts perfectly with just enough LBP outlandishness to make me giggle.
The rest of the cast were also spot on with their characters and backed up the leads wonderfully.
Serious fans of Twilight will NOT like this movie. But if you have a sense of humor, especially if you love bodily function humour, and an are looking for a fun, well-acted and enjoyable movie you will love Taintlight.",1255219200,7,662,4.6581196581196584

I have seen 14 year olds do a better job of producing a film.  I think they were trying to do a 'Hot Shots' type parody but ....they are not funny.

3951941,5,B002M4CH94,"This is a wonderful movie, lot of laughs with this one.  Many people are arguing that the quality is s***, costumes suck, and compare it too ""Vampires Suck"".  My friends let me start off by stating the costumes (mustache, make-up) don't make a movie, the story line, acting, script and most importantly the director does.  This dominates that, with extremely humorous lines, the acting is amateur, but is what makes the movie funny. Second, your kidding me by comparing this to ""Vampires Suck"".  This is a perfect example of better quality doesn't necessary make a movie ""better"".  This movie is clearly independent, making it so phenomenal, you can get away with almost anything when shooting an independent movie.  How ever ""Vampires Suck"" is a motion picture that was released in theaters.  There's your problem, one word, CENSORSHIP.  When you release a movie/film onto theaters you can't release more than half the scenes shown on ""Taintlight"" to the audience, they wouldn't allow it for a second.  ""Taintlight"" is an amazing movie with brilliant humor, and a small funny cast.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves spoofs, or loves to laugh at perverted jokes.",1365724800,,1179,5.0
3951942,1,B002M4CH94,"If you think Twilight was bad, this makes it look like an Academy Award winner... The level of bathroom humor is similar to what you would hear in a kindergarten classroom... at the same time the sex jokes (that definitely make this inappropriate for most of the preteen audience that drools over Twilight) are very grown up but are entirely vulgar. The makers went too far off in left field with this one. There is so much to poke fun at in the Twilight series that they ignored to just go off and throw random, vulgar, and immature jokes in. They literally failed at shooting fish in a barrel.",1354406400,,595,4.467889908256881

It looks like a cheap cellphone camera, the acting is TERRIBLE and the entire mood of the movie will leave you uncomfortable. I can't believe I wasted $2 on this movie, it isn't even worth a free download. I did not even watch 5 minutes into the movie it was so bad.

3951945,5,B002M4CH94,"Okay, let me start off by saying that I definitely DO NOT AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEWS. This movie is probably one of the funniest movies I've seen, ever. The fact that its such a low-budget movie makes it even funnier. The awful props and costumes are just another thing to laugh at. I seriously recommend watching this with a big group of friends, and invite your mom. Just kidding don't do that..",1343174400,,399,4.47945205479452
3951946,1,B002M4CH94,"This movie was horrible. I cannot fathom how it is available on Amazon for 17 dollars.  I began watching it, hoping it would be funny in a ""it's so bad, it's good kind of way,"" and I had to shut it off after thirty minutes.  It wasn't funny, at all, and it looked as though it was shot using a smartphone camera.  This film  looked like it was done by a bunch of kids, for fun, for about 500 dollars in production costs. I hope the team learned from creating this film, and I hope the next one is better  (good luck, guys)!!  I think that Taintlight  would be more reasonably priced for five dollars or less, or, really, I think they should make it available as a free download.  Please preview this product before you buy it.",1323993600,2,726,4.2101449275362315

3951948,3,B002M4CH94,"For those who desire to see a decent spoof of ""Twilight"" I would recommend ""Vampires Suck."" Taintlight, which I found funny at times, was mostly crude. The film starts out with a man dropping his pants in the woods and then dropping the f-bomb. The humor includes far too many period, fart, incest, and masturbation jokes. Meredith Host is the twenty something that played a high school student.

I liked the dad, who wore a t-shirt which proclaims, ""I hate actors"" which was clearly making a statement about the original film. Edgar would tell Stella to ""shut the f@#$ up"" and then say, ""I'll see you tomorrow."" Yes, there is clearly a spoof of the original, but the abundance of crudeness detracted from the film.

F-bomb, no nudity.",1316390400,,735,4.734375
3951949,2,B002M4CH94,"Let's face it, parodies are not often funny! Regardless of the reviews, I just had to see this spoof. It wouldve been a much better one without the father figure in it. His character was too gross throughout to add any laughs to its plot at all, and completely ruins the opening scene. (Since when is incest funny?!) If the movie had opened with Edward and Stella meeting in school it wouldve been better. I did have a slightly better appreciation for the movie after hearing the Making Of extra, which explains their loathing for Twilight, as opposed to an attempt to make a top comedy, which clearly is it not. Think of this as a student film low-budget experiment, which may give you a few sarcastic laughs and Edward is amusing. But overall it wouldnt have been difficult to write a slightly better, less immature script.",1313712000,3,825,4.619047619047619
3951950,1,B002M4CH94,"I swear this thing is just as bad as those porno movies that have no story to it and it's all about the sex and nudity. This movie doesn't even have the sex or nudity, but kept the bad acting, graphics, and story. However, there are a lot of sex jokes, bad jokes, and stupid jokes. There also plenty of sexual and masturbation jokes with the dad and daughter. Then again, there just a lot of sexual jokes with the daughter, period.",1313107200,2,431,4.2682926829268295
3951951,1,B002M4CH94,"I've seen some awful movies inexplicably wind up on DVD, and Taintlight is easily one of the worst.  There are dozens of things wrong with this movie, but I can sum it up with:

1. It's not remotely funny.
2. It was shot entirely with a camcorder.
3. There's no use of lighting or color correction.

That was 65 minutes of my life that I'll never get back.",1311465600,10,356,4.205882352941177

3951953,1,B002M4CH94,"Wow!!  This is BAD!!  The acting is horrible...Not to mention the costume/make up is nonexistant.  The fake mustache on Stella's father is so obsurd looking it almost comes off when he hugs her.  I don't quite understand why Stella's father checks out her bust size and gives her prono magazines.  There was not a perverse father in Twilight that I am aware of...I've only seen Twilight one time but I don't remember all the sexual jokes.  However, it is not only the father who is a perv but Stella's buddy who fingerbanged her...apparently this is a big thing and the whole school knows of it....Again, I don't remember the overtly perverse humor being in Twilight.  Also, why the close up camera shots of Stella's nose and Edgar's lips snarling???  I was unable to make it thru the whole movie...which is pretty bad considering some of the movies I have endured thru.  I at least made it thru one viewing of Twilight.",1309305600,,920,4.6645962732919255

I'm sure the kiddos had fun making this, but not the best film to watch on a Friday night. You're better off watching Plan 9 from Outer Space.  I think the only thing I liked about the film was some of the music, but it distracted me from the film altogether, which defeated the purpose of watching it.",1303430400,,575,4.86734693877551

That being said, it is a low budget spoof, so if you're expecting awesome camera work, special effects, and great acting, you're going to be very sad.  If you can get over the incest jokes and the low quality, then it's not too bad.  Yes, it's a group of friends that got together and filmed a movie, but if you're sick of all the Twilight hype, you might just find some enjoyment in this flick.

That's part of the reason why I found the much of Taintlight's cinematography to be stunningly creative. Many of the difficult scenes were done as tastefully as possible--from scanning across Stella's room, to dealing with a vampire exposed in sunlight to finding ways to cope with reality of not being able to afford yuppie sport cars (even for a day). My testimony is I was just as entertained.

I'm sick of people complaining how horrible this film is. Critics, haven't you ever heard of something being done tongue-in-cheek? This is a well done parody. Well done!",1283644800,3,656,4.857142857142857

8373561,1,B002M4CH94,"It's Twilight if it was written and performed by a bunch of high school kids who had detention for smoking in the school bathroom.

It's supposed to be a parody and when it does stick with the Twilight story line it does an ok job but the majority of the film is just expletive filled masturbation, fart and incest conversations with Twilight references occasionally thrown in.  If me typing the word ""poop"" in this review made you laugh then I highly recommend watching this.  If it didn't, you're most people.",1519516800,,511,4.655555555555556
8373562,5,B002M4CH94,"If you think the entire 'Twilight' series is dumb (as I do) and you don't mind cheap movies (I don't), this is perfect. Love it.",1512950400,,128,4.16
8373563,1,B002M4CH94,I like spoofs when they are clever and fun.  This is neither by a long shot.  It's crude and sophomoric and seriously.... embarrassed for them.  The language is disgusting and the sexual innuendos are gross.  Even what is meant for shock value is shocking in a really negative way.  I can't imagine anyone watching the whole thing.,1512777600,,331,4.7368421052631575
8373564,5,B002M4CH94,John Waters Tribute all the way. I love it!,1509321600,,43,3.888888888888889
8373565,3,B002M4CH94,"As spoofs go, this was really hard to watch.
Not going to say don't waste your time because there are all kinds of people out there.
I'd love for once if they tried to do something different with the dad other than making him a creep for his daughter.
kudos for giving us an effeminate character that was campy in a very un-campy way.",1500163200,,334,4.234375
8373566,5,B002M4CH94,An original and enthralling story line with lovable characters! What isn't there to love?? The actors are amazing and the special effects are on point; so life like! This is a must see hidden gem.,1492214400,,196,4.628571428571429
8373567,4,B002M4CH94,"It's so bad that it is actually hilarious. Don't go into it expecting much, just take it how it is. God I love that bubble seen so much lmfao. It is definitely now one of my all time favorite cinema moments.",1490832000,,207,4.073170731707317
8373568,5,B002M4CH94,So bad it was almost somewhat okay.,1489881600,,35,4.142857142857143
8373569,3,B002M4CH94,"Ok this is some low budget s***. But it's also so dumb it's funny. A buddy and I checked this movie out on Netflix about 6 years ago. We didn't think we were going to finish it but at an hour and 5 mins it wasn't hard. We both laughed our a$$es off. Theres no big talent in this movie, probably a collage film. But if you ever enjoy stupid pointless (spoof) movies (this is a horrible spoof movie) then you'll enjoy this. So stupid you can't help but watch.",1489363200,3,457,4.088888888888889
