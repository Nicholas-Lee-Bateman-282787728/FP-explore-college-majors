I remember seeing this movie on showtine in 2000, and I quickly noticed that the film had been edited in several parts (espcially the love scenes). I was very disappointed.  In short the movie was great for a low budget movie, I just hope that it comes out on DVD uncut, and unedited in the future so I can get the real thing.",1175644800,2,431,4.130952380952381
7851014,5,6303578284,"I feel that it is definately a Fatal Attraction/Play Misty For Me type movie.  It is very suspensful with a tad of humor.  I think it is a very good film.  It may be a low budget film, but it is a lot better that some high budget films that I have seen with a similar senario.
I saw the film for the first time on Showtime in 2002; and, I was very impressed.
Chad McQueen and the other actors in the film did an excellent job.  Further, I hope to see Chad McQueen in more films.  I think he is a great talent (like his Father Steve McQueen) and I hope to see him in more/future films.
I thought that it was a great, exciting and suspensful film from start to finish.
I not only highly recommend this film to anyone, but I have encouraged my friends to see it as well.",1037750400,2,767,3.9869281045751634

  The story revolves around Chad McQueen, who plays a hot shot actor known by everybody.  One day, he has a one night stand with a beautiful, sweet yet disturbed young woman that when angry, have homicidal impulses.  These impulses become evident to the actor when his closest friends turn up murdered.  That's when he realizes that she wants to be more than just a one nighter.
  This movie may seem as if you have seen it before, but it turns out to be entertaining and suspenseful.  The stalkings of the victims are riveting and you can't help but keep your eyes glued to the television screen.  The performances are fairly superior for a low budget flick.
  However, this movie is not perfect....  The film's pace is also very slow. The killings and suspense come later in the second half of the film.  By the time you get to this, you will probably already be bored and about to doze off.  Last, the stalker formula very familiar and it will disappoint viewers.
  In conclusion, I definitely recomend this to anyone who either needs to kill time or likes fatal attraction thrillers.  This is not recommended for people who are looking for an taut, original thriller, because you will be disappointed at how predictable it is.  If you are not recommended for this, then I suggest you just go out and rent Fatal Attraction again.",996019200,3,1556,4.505376344086022
