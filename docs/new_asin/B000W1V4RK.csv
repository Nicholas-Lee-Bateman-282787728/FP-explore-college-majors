8221002,5,B000W1V4RK,"Christi Taylor is my favorite video instructor ... I'm not the most coordinated person, but I love the challenge of learning her choreography, as my mind is concentrating on the moves instead of the butt-kicking workout.",1354233600,,220,5.138888888888889
8221003,4,B000W1V4RK,I am a Christi Taylor fan! In this set of DVD I got 3 of her older workouts. The step is really good but the floor aerobic / Happy Hour / was very difficult to follow. The toning is ok but not advanced!,1211500800,,202,3.7209302325581395
