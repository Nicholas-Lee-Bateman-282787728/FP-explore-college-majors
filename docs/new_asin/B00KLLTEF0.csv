6433469,5,B00KLLTEF0,"Surprise yourself with an unusual performance of Clint Walker in The Bounty Man. The plot is surprising because the bounty hunter never suspects what he is capable of doing. Can't reveal more except to say, total surprise for all characters is very rewarding. Especially fine soundtrack by period instruments and original songs of great harmony from those isolated settlements in the old west who danced to their own tunes. This is a gem of a movie true to the time and place and characters. Enjoy. Thanks to Clint Walker for being a pathfinder in the western genres.",1464912000,2,567,4.855670103092783

6433474,5,B00KLLTEF0,This is an excellent potpourri of enjoyable Westerns with a good Clint Walker flick as an anchor. Priced right too!  Buy,1446249600,,120,4.714285714285714
6433475,5,B00KLLTEF0,"This was a much different role for Clint Walker although he still rode a horse, was the besr shot but had a different demeanor. I never tire of Clint Walker & wish he would do more. This movie was as the title says he played ""The Bounty Man"" & always got his man & many more. I especially liked the song written for the movie. It is more than average viewing.",1444608000,6,359,4.070422535211268
6433476,3,B00KLLTEF0,Not a great dvd - some okay other movies not that good,1441584000,,54,3.5833333333333335

6433478,1,B00KLLTEF0,The Bounty man is really the only movie on this disc that is any good.  The other 4 are pretty much B movies.,1438300800,7,109,3.739130434782609
6433479,4,B00KLLTEF0,I got this just for The Bounty Man. The other 2 weren't that great.,1436313600,,67,3.857142857142857

6433482,2,B00KLLTEF0,The two spaghetti westerns were poorly transferred to the digital format.  I have a number of the spaghetti westerns sitting in my shelves and only the Leone and Corbucci efforts stand out.  The rest are rehashed clones of one another with poor dubbing and mismatched sound tracks and awful plots.,1434240000,4,297,4.92

6433486,5,B00KLLTEF0,"Three movies were great, but 2 were the worst I've ever seen. Clint Walker is in only The Bounty Man.",1426464000,7,101,4.1
8659792,3,B00KLLTEF0,there are 2 dvds of this pic.  though there are multiple pics on the dvd the pic quality on this bm is the best and the one to get. it also has a pic of walker in front.  the other one just has the bounty man.  the opening has those white line dropouts you got on some videotapes.  there are a fair number of night scenes so dark i could see nothing. sound is ok.  strangely the cover says remastered the bounty man starring margot kidder and a black and white pic of her.  i imagine most are like me and wanted this for clint walker so the whole thing is bizarre and seems like some amateur with an old videotape they are selling copies of.  you can see it on youtube in this version for free.  this was a made for tv movie and the pic looks as good as it did on tv and is worth the money.  in one night scene you could even see shadows from the fire flickering on walker's fsce. on the other the pic was so dark you could hardly see a face.,1533340800,,942,3.9157894736842107
8659793,4,B00KLLTEF0,He stepped away from Cheyenne and into any role he was presented with and made it so believable!!  Tough bounty man with a soft heart...! Great,1501545600,,143,4.5
8659794,3,B00KLLTEF0,"3 out of the 5 movies are good watching. Spaghetti westerns have never been my cop of tea with the exception of Clint Eastwood's foray into them. Clint Walker carries ""The Bounty Man"" with his usual aplomb & I also enjoyed ""Aces 'N Eights"" and ""Prairie Fever"". As I say, 3 out of 5 is reasonable value.",1492473600,,302,4.315789473684211

8659801,3,B00KLLTEF0,I could only get the movies on a 19 inch screen. Anything larger and only one movie showed and it wasn't the Clint Walker one and that was the only one that I really wanted.  If they are not formatted for all tvs it needs to be stated in the description.,1478736000,,254,3.980392156862745
