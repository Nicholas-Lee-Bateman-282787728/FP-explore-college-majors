The chapters od the DVDs describe the art of bondage step by step, they helped me to learn more about the basics of bondage and about safety as well.

4860711,5,B005QYNTCQ,These movies are worth their weight in gold! The instructor does an amazing job from safety to the step by step ties. I also love the feature where you can isolate one single tie or play the whole series. These DVD's are amazing for the novice to the advance and highly suggest these to anyone interested in kinbaku or shibari!,1345248000,,327,4.466666666666667
4860712,5,B005QYNTCQ,"This DVD set is perfect for all levels and I strongly recommend getting both DVDs as a set. The goal of the DVD is how to tie people with emotion and not the mindless, soulless tying of inanimate parcels.  In the bondage world, many people forget about the emotional connection to the rope bottom.

Japanese rope bondage style is very different from Western (American) Bondage and you will see this in the DVDs. The biggest difference is the ties are done with one continuous rope.  Ropes are joined together to complete the tie. From start to finish the box tie (TK) uses 2-3 ropes. This is why rope used for Japanese bondage is one set length and thickness.  American (Western) bondage is more modular and uses different lengths of rope to complete a set of smaller ties. This becomes a burden with different rope lengths.

The modern version of the movie ""Flower and Snake"" (2003-04) has the rope work of Arisue Go who was one of Esinem's teachers. The rope work is awesome in this movie, just a shame the movie starts off slow so you may fast forward to the action.

These DVDs are a great start into rope bondage with emotional connection.  Love the person with rope.",1325548800,4,1172,4.578947368421052
4860713,5,B005QYNTCQ,"As a complete beginner at the art of shibari I ordered these DVD's not know what to expect. I have looked at other DVD's and they are often just performances, often in Japanese and difficult to follow. I am not likely to ever become and expert so really I just wanted some basics.

What you get with this DVD is more than that it is an extremely detailed demonstration of how to tie each tie. I think it will take me a long while just to get through the first DVD as there is so much material. Each tie is beautifully shot with very clear instruction so I found it easy to follow the couple of ties I have so far tried.

I think the safety section was also really useful as I didn't know half of this stuff and can see that you need to be a bit careful about doing shibari now. At least it will help me avoid some of the easy mistakes he shows in the video. Same for the rope care video. I thought this was fascinating and I have ordered some rope to try and copy what he does. Certainly a little better than just buying it off the shelf I would have thought.

If anything the downside of these DVD's is there is just too much to take in quickly. I still feel a little swamped by the amount of information, all the different ties. It is a lot to take on board but then that is what I wanted.

I love the fact that he keeps telling you to be creative, have a go and try to experiment. I think that is the way to go.",1322438400,6,1414,3.9683098591549295
4860714,5,B005QYNTCQ,"I'm going to give a really honest, fair review of these DVDs, so anyone interested in buying them gets an idea of what to expect for their money.

Price

I ordered Vol 1 & 2 from Esinem, as I particularly wanted the second DVD, which isn't available on it's own yet. Both DVD's cost $75, or just under 50 by xe.com rates. I think this is a really reasonable price considering the quality of the content and the finished work, in relation to private lessons or even workshops.

Content

First off are talks about rope types and care, conducting a scene and a discussion on the difference between tying a pattern and tying people, not parcels.

I am really impressed by the depth of discussion and points covered in the safety section, which is included in both DVDs. Prodding parts of my arm along with Esinem's discussion has shed greater light on the nerve placement in bodies.

Volume 1 covers the basic ties that will be added to in Vol 2, such as the single and double column ties, and variations on those. In addition, the single tension tie, lacing and finishing tutorials are all useful in terms of free work or the box tie that is a major part of Vol 2. The tutorials are clear, concise and well presented.

Volume 2 deals a lot with the takate kote, with clear instruction on the 2 rope and 3 rope variations and then moving onto ties which utilise the box tie as part of the whole thing. Again all the tutorials were clear and concise, with extra safety information and points for riggers to watch out for.

Both volumes have demonstration sessions with Esinem and his wonderful rope bottoms, which were enlightening in terms of seeing how the ties can be put together, and also for reinforcing the message of having a connection between rigger and bottom, and for the journey that rope can take us.

My thoughts

Overall, I really like these DVDs in terms of format, methodical approach, clarity of tutorial and deeper discussion into the finer details of rope - care, type, different ways to express feeling with rope as well as the actual ties.

The safety section is superb, and I really liked how the talk from Esinem allowed you to touch the nerves on yourself to feel where they are - much clearer and more easily remembered than reading a book or looking at a diagram. Other important issues were discussed here in terms of all round bondage and play safety - absolute essential information.

The demos were beautiful and enlightening, and I really enjoyed seeing the connection there. I was also impressed that Esinem had used more than just female rope bottoms for his tutorials and demos - something as a female rigger I can find lacking in other material.

Constructive Criticism

It's important for me to say that I had a hard time picking anything out that I felt was lacking - these really fabulous pieces of work, and I hope that Vol 3 isn't too long in the making!

My one nitpicking comment would be that in the TK tutorial, the rope bottom had a black loose top on, which made it difficult to see the placement of the ropes in relation to her body. I would have preferred a sleeveless or formfitting top, so we could see where is ideal placement in relation to the armpit for the top rope (broadly speaking).

Summary

Other than that, I really cannot fault this wonderful work. I think the DVDs look professional, clean and well presented, clear, concise and informative. I'd say they should be on the recommended list for any newbies or riggers who want to improve their style or expression, and are a useful reference tool for the scene. I'll certainly be recommending them to anyone who is interested in rope bondage, and wish something this conscise had been out when I was starting out in rope.

I hope you find this review useful and I'd just like to say a massive thank you to Esinem for making the DVDs. I hope he continues with this amazing gift of knowledge to the rope bondage community.",1319328000,19,3928,4.563300142247511
