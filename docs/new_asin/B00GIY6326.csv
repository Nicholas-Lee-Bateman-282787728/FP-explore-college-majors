8623655,5,B00GIY6326,This video was great! As a teacher myself I found this video to be a great resource to learn about chair yoga and how to teach it to my clients. Jennifer has a lot of yoga knowledge to share. As a practitioner I love taking this class. It flows beautifully and is the perfect level of challenge! I highly recommend!,1431907200,2,315,4.266666666666667
8623656,5,B00GIY6326,"Jennifer has such an easy and approachable demeanor and teaching style. I look forward to practicing with her through this accessible format which is a close second to being able to practice with her in person. Providing just the right amount of accessibility and challenge, I have found using this chair based practice as a break during a long day of sitting at my desk on my computer to be just the 'medicine' I need for managing mental stress and physical discomfort. Better still, I feel stretched, strong and refreshed after each practice. If every corporate office played this video at lunch time or during the afternoon slump, we'd have a lot fewer stressed executives and office workers and ultimately a healthier, more productive, compassionate culture in the workplace! Thank you for this gift, Jennifer Lake!",1395878400,3,819,5.029411764705882
8623657,5,B00GIY6326,Jennifer clearly has studied and has a passion for yoga which she shares in this DVD. It is an easy and comfortable way to practice at home and help nurture your body and mind. Highly recommend for anyone who wants to help find some peace and balance in their life and learn from someone with a gift to share.,1392595200,,309,4.254237288135593
8623658,3,B00GIY6326,"The sound was bouncing off the wall.  The teacher kept batting at her hair.  There was a picture in the back that kept on getting cut out along with the teacher feet at times.  Now for the good stuff!  She is a very good teacher who just need to braid her hair in back or have it secured in a soft bun to keep it out of her face.  She wore a washed out blue top and black bottom.  Need some better colors in there.  Beautiful decorations framing the scene.  Get rid of the wall photo and put an accent piece that coordinates with the rest of the decorations.  The actual workout is good but limited.  Needed is beginners, the next two steps as people progress.  I would put the teacher in the middle put in position where she can show the more advanced, but can also pop up to bring attention to the other two people.  If this DVD were redone with these recommendations I would certainly but the first to order one.",1391644800,2,915,4.195402298850575
8623659,5,B00GIY6326,"Jennifer Lakes Active Chair Yoga DVD is a great supplement for at home yoga practice as she guides viewers through seated, active standing, and stretch/relaxation sections that may be followed in a 55 minute continuous practice or individual sections. An inspired and inspiring yoga teacher, Jennifer provides clear explanations and demonstrations of yoga poses designed to improve balance, strengthen core and enhance flexibility for anyone who wants a gentle entry to yoga practice. I have been a student in Jennifers chair yoga classes and also in individual sessions and this DVD is the next best thing to working with Jennifer in person! A super way to start the day.

8623662,5,B00GIY6326,"I started working with Jennifer Lake in a chair yoga class three years ago. I have made significant gains in strength, flexibility, and balance. I do other forms of exercise (weights and cardio), but I attribute her chair yoga the most directly for my improvements. I am thrilled to have her DVD to use at home. It allows me to practice yoga every day.",1384905600,,352,4.515625
8623663,5,B00GIY6326,"I've been working out with Jennifer Lake's Active Chair Yoga DVD for the past month, and I absolutely love it!  Her program is easy, relaxing and gets results.  I'm already looking slimmer and more toned than when I first began. And I actually look forward to exercising, which is a first for me!  Jennifer's pace flows beautifully with the soothing background music.  I highly recommend this DVD for anyone, at any age, who wants to enjoy the process of slimming, toning, stretching and losing inches (particularly around the middle).",1384732800,,535,4.977528089887641
