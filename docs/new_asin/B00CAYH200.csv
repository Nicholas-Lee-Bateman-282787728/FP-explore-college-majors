5709960,5,B00CAYH200,"What a great film!  The acting was superb from start to finish.  Much like 8 mile this movie has a very real element to it, I would highly recommend it!",1374105600,3,152,4.033333333333333
5709961,4,B00CAYH200,"Imagine my surprise when out of nowhere and without any pre-release fanfare this movie showed up this past weekend at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati. I figure that this would not be playing long, so I decided to see it (as it turns out, on the very last day of its screening here, as it is already gone after one week).

As ""Filly Brown"" (2013 release; 101 min.) opens, we see Majo (played by Gina Rodriguez) performing at an in-studio radio session as Filly Brown, a hip-hop singer who is trying to find success. In the very next scene we see Majo visiting someone in jail, and we learn very quickly that it is her mom Maria (played by Jenni Rivera), who is serving time on a drug charge. Maria is quite the manipulative person, and she is trying to get Majo to somehow get several thousand dollars so that Maria might perhaps get a retrial. We get to know the lawyer who will head up the effort to get a retrial, Leandro (played by Edward James Olmos, who looks to be about 85 or 90). We also get to know Majo's dad/Maria's husband Jos (played by Lou Diamond Phillips). Majo/Filly Brown is turning some heads with her music, and pretty soon she is getting courted by a major player in the hip-hop world who is trying add to her street cred and sultry image. To tell you more of the plot would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first, this movie plays more like a tough family drama than it does as a Latino/hip-hop version of ""A Star Is Born"". That does not mean that music isn't a major factor in this movie. In fact, the music plays a key role in particular tjhe first half of the movie. I am not big into hip-hop as such, yet I found myself enjoying the music a lot. Second, Gina Rodriguez really shines in the title role, and is someone to be watched. Even better, she does all of her own singing in the movie. (The movie soundtrack, available here on Amazon, inexplicably only has 2 songs on it from the many songs Gina Rodriguez performs in the movie.) Third, this is sadly Jenni Rivera's last screen role, as she died in an accident late last year (before the movie got its wide release). Fourth, can someone explain to me why it took 15 months for this movie, first shown at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival, to get released in theatres? Last but not least, I (a middle-aged while male) am certainly not the target audience for this movie, yet I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish. If you're in the mood for a great indie movie consisting of a Latino family drama with a twist of hip-hop music added to it, I can readily recommmend this movie.",1371686400,9,2656,4.385395537525355
5709962,4,B00CAYH200,"As a movie fan in general, I enjoyed Filly Brown. But as a longtime urban music journalist, I also appreciated just how true to life this movie was.  What makes Filly Brown stand out from movies like Hustle and Flow or 8 Mile is both how it deals with women in urban music, and having a female lead that offers a powerful performance.

Filly Brown tells the story of Majo Tonorio, a Latina rapper who dreams of performing for huge audiences.  The Los Angeles MC builds her buzz rapping on the radio as Filly Brown, but her desire to get signed gets put into full gear because of her family. Filly's mother (played by Jenni Rivera) is serving a ten year prison sentence, her only hope for early release depends on whether Filly can come up with fast cash. What follows is a story of desire, manipulation, and redemption.

Despite having a low budget, Filly Brown was shot well. But what really stands out about the movie is the cast, a mix of film veterans and new faces. Gina Rodriguez puts on a terrific performance as Filly Brown, with a voice and intensity that made her a great choice for the role.

Edward James Olmos adds some seasoning to the film, and is reunited with Stand and Deliver alumnus Lou Diamond Phillips, who plays the hardworking father of Filly and her younger sister.  Film and TV star Emilio Rivera plays Mani, Filly's protective uncle and boss. California rappers Cuete Yeska and Baby Bash add new faces to the cast, with H-Town artist Chingo Bling adding some needed humor to the film as Filly's manager.

Despite this being her first feature film, Jenni Rivera (RIP) offers a moving portrayal of Maria, Filly's drug addicted mother doing hard time.  Rivera ditched her trademark stage glamor for a prison uniform to deliver a haunting and memorable performance.  Her scenes are convincing, bittersweet considering Filly Brown will be the only time she appears in movie theaters.

As far as the movie's inside look at the urban music game, Filly Brown scores for realism. Hip Hop managers are left hanging when labels strike backroom deals. Female rappers are often denied mainstream attention if they refuse to compromise their artistic integrity. In this case, Filly succumbs to the pressure of ""sexing up"" her image and lyrics to land a record deal for a fast payout to help her mother.

The movie isn't flawless, of course.  Filly Brown offers more than a couple character types common to other movies, which gives several scenes a recycled feel. There are also one too many subplots, which threatens to muddle the film as the end approaches.

Overall, Filly Brown succeeds. Its lineup of actors, surprisingly good Hip Hop soundtrack, and tear-jerking ending all make it a film to remember. Although the film features a variety of established Latino actors and artists, it's a movie that anyone should be able to enjoy. Definitely worth getting on DVD or Blu-Ray.",1365897600,17,2893,4.785140562248996
5709963,5,B00CAYH200,Really good movie. I liked the simplicity of it and how it could be any person's life. Very relatable. I also really like Gina's rapping. She's got a talent.,1457740800,,157,4.448275862068965
5709964,5,B00CAYH200,"I like the plot and the introduction of conflict - what happened to Majo's mother and whether Majo should trust her.  If anything, I wish there had been more freestyling on Gina's part. I hope Gina Rodriguez releases an album! Her emcee chops took my girl crush to the next level.",1455580800,,280,4.490196078431373

It came in excellent condition not damage but i was expecting that was gonna come with the slip case too",1451347200,,285,3.9310344827586206
5709966,5,B00CAYH200,"Not the pyrotechnic variety but the more subtler form. It was very ""meaty"" in that it presented
realistic situations that are relatable on different levels by men and women alike. That being said,
the creators of ""Filly Brown"" should be lauded for the courage to cast a Latina in the lead role of a movie
which explores universal themes. The characters are not archetypal. You may think you have them pegged
until they turn around and surprise you (I won't give away the ending.)
  It was so well-directed that even side stories contained elements that resonate with larger audiences.
For example, former gangbangers are not the only people who struggle with concealing their tattoos at work.
Folks in all the colors of the rainbow reckon with that decision whether they work construction, join the military,
enter the education or health care sectors and many points in between.
  ""Filly Brown"" has as much heart as the real-life actors who portrayed the characters. In the movie, the up and
coming rapper risks her artistic integrity and street cred to boost her appeal. In real life, singer Jenni Rivera risked
shedding her glamorous image to play the role of an inmate. ""Filly Brown"" was an uplifting movie about family, courage
and hope. Well-worth watching.",1439251200,,1263,4.971563981042654

5709991,2,B00CAYH200,"I'm not into hip hop music so I cant' recommend this.
The acting is okay there was less profanity than is normally common so I think that's an improvement.
Edward James Olmos does a cameo as a crusty old Chicano, no reach there.
Lou Diamond Phillips reprises his role as  a Chicano in the father's role.

Jenni Rivera appears as a somewhat recovering drug addict. Sad to she she couldn't escape the harsh reality of her life in Mexico. For those of us living here we just lumber on. This movie ends on a hopeful note; through it all the characters quarrel among themselves but there seems to be an absence of hate and that is hopeful.
Guess some people got work on this movie; that's a good thing.",1391212800,,697,4.395348837209302

Filly wants to gain stardom to help pay a lawyer to get her mom out of prison, and that's where the trouble begins. Before prison her mom wrote music under a male pseudonym, and gives Filly one of her original scores. Filly likes it and claims it as her own, only to be outed for plagiarizing the song from the unknown ""male"" author. Does she get out of trouble, does she lose her friends, is her career over?
