8657437,5,B00KBZ2U98,Some episodes are on YouTube if you want a preview. A taste of satire can go a long way! Make sure your TV plays PAL -- my DVD player is multi-region but I found that my older flatscreen only plays NTSC so have to play these on my computer.,1479772800,2,240,3.9183673469387754

8657439,5,B00KBZ2U98,I've only seen about 10 minutes of the first episode.  I went in cold and had no idea it was not a serious crime drama.  I had to stop watching because there are varying opinions of this type of humor in my household but I found it hilarious.  Think about a cross of Big Train and a cop show.,1467763200,,292,3.9152542372881354
