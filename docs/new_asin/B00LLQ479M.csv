6490273,3,B00LLQ479M,"Page Eight was a first class piece of cloak and dagger work, British cold and foggy ambiance, politics, and behind the scenes deal making. Turks and Caicos had none of that. I didn't care for the sun and sand atmosphere of this film. Bill Nighy was as good as ever but this film just didn't have the ""look"" and ambiance of the first film at all. I watch Page Eight several times a year. I'm not sure I'll ever watch this one again. Christopher Walken was good, but wasn't in it that much. I just wanted Wynona Ryder's character to go away. Too jaded. Even Bill Nighy said in an interview that he didn't prefer the sun and sand for this movie, that he preferred a more British approach. I agree. apparently the 3rd installment called Salting the Battlefield is a return to that. I will review it after I watch it. I hope it's closer to Page Eight than this one was....Bill Nighy said he would love to play this character for the rest of his life. The creator says there are no more planned. I hope he will change his mind.....",1418428800,,1025,4.316062176165803

Aside from louse acting, Walken in particular, and poor, actually NO plot, this looks like a Death In Paradise episode. Just terrible.

6490277,5,B00LLQ479M,"#2 in the trilogy of Johnny Worricker (Page Eight was the first one).  These stories are GREAT.  Great writing, fantastic acting, and the settings are really wonderful!  Turks & Caicos seems to be a lovely place to visit.  The front of the CD says ""Ralph Fiennes"" on it as though he is the star - he's only the Prime Minister.  The Star and the story line is about Bill Nighy's character who has scruples, values and works as a analyst for the MI5.  Also appearing is the wonderful Helena Bonham Carter and also one of my favorites - Winona Ryder (she's on in the 2nd one).  Watch all three one right after the other.

6490284,2,B00LLQ479M,I purchased this video because it was filmed in the Turks & Caicos islands and I was excited to see the island.  The story was semi-interesting but I didn't expect the f-bomb to be dropped.  I didn't know PBS used that type of language.  I have not seen the previous Worricker Trilogy so I was a bit lost with the characters and storyline.  I tried to stream this movie with Prime (and save myself $15) but it wasn't available.

6490286,4,B00LLQ479M,"Turks and Caicos are tax shelter paradise islands. This is part two of the series. I have not seen either one as of this time. I was able to keep up with the characters in spite of it. Bill Nighy plays former MI5 spy Johnny Worricker, a man with a conscience. Winona Ryder is typed cast into a  mildly crazy woman. The film is a well acted spy drama. It is not an action film unless people sitting at a table having drinks is your definition of action. The film is twisty and real identity of Christopher Walken and his ""lizard charm""  changes like the wind.  Interesting topic.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1437955200,,612,4.342105263157895

6490293,4,B00LLQ479M,"This is the second part of the Worricker Trilogy. The first part of it has always been easy to find in America, called ""Page Eight."" That was an absolutely perfect spy film and set in in England with Bill Nighy as a long time UK spy up against the PM, played by Ralph Fiennes. He goes on the lam in that film and this tropical island is where we find him a few years later. Unfortunately, he is recognized by a CIA agent who is on the island, played by Christopher Walken. Walken is doing a big investigation on the island and needs Nighy's help. There is also quite a cast of other characters: mobsters, a mobster's daughter, Nighy's old girlfriend, native islanders who come to his aid. Nighy is the best part of it even though big names are throughout this second part of the series. Why were all these big names aboard a UK tv show? Playwright and director David Hare was at the helm and it doesn't get much better than that. He's at the top of the heap in UK talent. I found it enjoyable but it does not excel like ""Page Eight"" did. I enjoyed it but I did not absolutely adore it as I did ""Page Eight"". Now I'm ready to watch the final part of the trilogy.",1432166400,,1161,4.1875
6490294,5,B00LLQ479M,"Art imitates life. Here we have a sort of under-the-radar business group called ""The Bridge"" which is funneling money to politicians. The Bridge (not to be confused with the now defunct ""Atlantic Bridge"" which was funding a group of Tory politicians until 2011) is a nebulous organization which is also laundering dirty money in the Caymans....sorry....Turks and Caicos island and distributing it to various politicians in GB, namely the PM (not to be confused with the Minister of Defence in any way). Anyway, Worricker makes the discovery, and the connection between these entities, and brings them to light.

This could never happen in America. When we find that dirty money is infecting a political figure, we just ignore it. Our media won't even cover it at all. There's no coverup, since nobody covered it to begin with.",1432080000,2,826,5.029197080291971

6490297,5,B00LLQ479M,Worricker wins again in Turks & Caicos. But Winona Ryder steals the show as the damaged Melanie. If only Nighy would be shot moving around as he does so masterfully on the stage. Saw him in Skylight. Producer - shame on you for losing a Nighy strong point with your endless motionless head shots!,1430956800,,296,4.5
6490298,5,B00LLQ479M,"Wonderful production in all aspects - casting, acting, writing, storyline...

6490299,5,B00LLQ479M,"Bill Nighy, Winona Ryder, and Christopher Walken really MAKE this film, but great performances by several actors in minor roles give it polish. Helena Bonham Carter's performance is a nice preview of the emotion and understated passion her character will display in ""Salting The Battlefield."" The location shots are mostly in-tight closeups, so Turks and Caicos scenery is not featured much. The plot twists and character development are why I so thoroughly enjoy the Johnny Worricker trilogy, and this second installment does NOT disappoint. However, this film does NOT really do well as a stand-alone: you need to see ""Page Eight"" (first in the trilogy) to get the context of Johnny's physical and moral predicament. The last scene is a GREAT segue into the third installment of this gem of a trilogy.",1428192000,4,803,5.090909090909091

6490304,2,B00LLQ479M,"I actually enjoyed Page Eight, but I felt like this one fell apart.  Winona Ryder was annoying as always drunk.  It was really painful to watch.  Even Johnny's part wasn't that good.  I believed his nice guy image in Page Eight.  It did not sustain itself in part 2.  He looked like he was losing interest in it too.  Nice to see so many famous people, but don't know if they worked with one another even.  The chemistry between the characters was a little off.  Now I'm not so keen to see part 3.",1425772800,,497,4.202127659574468

6490326,4,B00LLQ479M,"it was a pleasure too turn to this, the second film in David Hare's ""Worricker"" trilogy, after the hyperactivity of ""The Bourne Ultimatum.""  Viewers who saw ""Page Eight"" will understand that Johnny Worricker (Bill Nighy) is hiding out on the British Protectorate of Turks and Caicos under an assumed name, since he is now persona non grata at MI5, having discovered the Prime Minister's involvement with the CIA to run an under-the-radar intelligence scheme.  Now, on his island, he is recognized by a CIA operative Curtis Pellissier (Christopher Walken) who has been following some American businessmen whom he suspects of being connected to an American company, Gladstone, that is overcharging the US Government for contract work done in relation to the ""war on terror.""  Pellissier tries unsuccessfully to win the confidence of Melanie Fall (Winona Ryder), an associate of the company, but she rebuffs him, and he turns to Worricker to see if he can help.  It's not clear to the viewer early on that Pellissier knows who Worricker is or only suspects, but Worricker assumes the worst.  However, Worricker finally does win Melanie's trust and comes to an agreement with Pellissier not to blow his (Worricker's) cover in return for helping Pellissier deal with the contractors.  Melanie's information, however, ties these contractors to a group headed by a British entrepreneur Stirling Rogers (Rupert Graves), who is ostensibly setting up a charitable foundation, The Bridge, that Johnny suspects might be a front for money-laundering.

At this point, two coincidences come into play rather too conveniently: first an international business colloquium has been organized to take place on Turks and Caicos, and both Rogers and the Gladstone group will attend.  Second, one of Johnny's old girlfriends, Margot Tyrell, a former MI5 operative, now works for Rogers's company, and it is through her that Worricker and Pellissier are able to find out more about the funding of Rogers's charity.  So by the time the colloquium takes place, all the major players, including Margot, whom Rogers has brought along, are on the island.  The climax is a confrontation in which Worricker and Pellissier reveal what they know -- the full extent of which I will say no more about in the interest of avoiding spoilers.

Much of the tension in the movie is generated in conversation.  There is a murder, but its relation to the main action turns out to be surprising, and there is a local law-enforcement officer on the island who plays a critical role at the end.  The whole thing is low-key, but very effective, with Nighy, Graves, Bonham Carter, and Walken doing good work.  The switching of focus from the Caribbean to London and back is well-handled, and perhaps the only thing one might complain about is the device of having Margot be employed by Stirling Rogers.  It's hard to see how Worricker could have come up with the information he needs without her help, and of course, the setting of the colloquium in Worricker's hiding-place is a bit too neat as well.  But still . . . these are old pros at work here, and it's good to see them go at it.",1419552000,,3139,4.9504761904761905
6490327,5,B00LLQ479M,"This part 2 of the trilogy is excellent, like the other two parts, and taken as a whole is an excellent commentary on the depravity of the world that we currently live in, coming first of all from our own governments.",1419292800,,217,4.317073170731708
