The other girls are beautiful but there is nothing sexy about the scenes, the play between them is really dull when there is some play. Don't expect a party (people having fun and doing exciting things), in this case party means just a bunch of girls together. They are posing sometimes in bikini, sometimes topless and very few times all nude, but the pace is so slow and the music is so dinner-like, that you can have a nap every 5 minutes and don't miss a thing.

Save your money, don't buy BabeWatch: Mild Pool Bunch of Girls.",1145232000,7,805,4.395973154362416
