5893709,5,B00E83BBV2,"To be short & brief the overall review for this was really good well for sec I thought it was something new added to the series but no I was wrong. I don't wanna spoil anything just cause the fact its short about 52 minutes to be exact & credits 7 minutes & a preview to the second half yet to be released later this year If my sources were correct. Fans for this series will appreciate it while people that aren't familiar will think twice, but you'll regret it reason being the US only got a limited supply about 2,000 while Japan has plenty in stock but Region 2 & not Region 1. The blue Ray comes with a few extras & a piece of flim form the movie & let's not forget to read the extras when you get it well booklet size, it helps a bit. Short summary for the flim its before the the shell squad was founded that should give you some clues. I loved it & I can't wait for the second half...",1377561600,5,892,3.988826815642458
5893710,5,B00E83BBV2,"First off, sorry; No matter how much I edit this review, it just keeps getting longer. I can't help but ramble about my favorite franchise of all time. I've done my best to stay on topic, but may venture off Ghost in the Shell (GitS): Arise - Border 1 and onto GitS in general. So here's an index to help you sift through my mumbo jumbo:

1. Info (Director/Music)
2. Review (What's different/similar about Arise?)
3. Hardware (DVD, case, extras, audio/video quality)
4. Conclusion (anything else?, wrap-up)

So it's been 7 years since the latest installment of GitS, GitS Solid State Society (SSS), and 11 years since this new OVA's ""sequel"" Stand Alone Complex (SAC). Guys, I've officially turned into a 12 yr old school girl.

1.  INFO
-Kazuchika Kise was the chief animator for the first 2 films some 20 years ago, so we've got a GitS veteran at the helm. I can tell by the direction he took his film compared to both Oshii (Original film/Innocence) and Kamiyama (SAC/SSS) that this is his first major director debut though, and could have been a little better.
-Kise certainly respects his predecessors and pays homage to the franchise, some say too much (which I will discuss in 2.) This being a good or bad thing is subjective; I thought it was a good thing.
-Cornelius (Appleseed: Ex Machina) collaborated with Salyu x Salyu for this OST. Their voices are beautiful, but interesting non-mainstream style is definitely an acquired taste; nothing like Yoko Kanno, Origa and Kenji Kawai.

2.  REVIEW
-Motoko's new character design left me a bit reminiscent of the old designs, especially when they left the rest of the major cast unchanged.
 -To the up-side, each character re-design helps personify the Major in a unique way, and this new series is no different. She is a younger, more vulnerable, gritty and ""looked down at"" Motoko; she's not afraid to put all her chips on the table, and kick some ***. Plus there is some explanation as to why Motoko is so different from the others.
-All of Section 9 is voiced by a new Japanese cast. Ill admit I was very skeptical about changing the cast and dropping Tanaka, but Maaya Sakamoto and they others did a DAMN good job.
-It takes place in Motoko's mysterious past; that was partly what made her so intriguing. Part of her story being told was a delicate balance between maintaining mystery and satisfying fans with ""know-you-know"" that was well accomplished.

-What's Good: powerful animation, great choreography, homage to its predecessors and complex characters.
-What's Bad: Very short, barely started plot (being only part 1 of 4) and Kise mirroring many iconic scenes in the original GitS (surprise opt-camo scenes, the Major prying open a hatch, straining/ripping cyborg bodies/ligaments, etc) to the point where many thought it was non-beneficial, dull and repetitive. So if you're looking for something fresh to GitS in that aspect, be warned. I'd describe it as a tribute to an old film with new animation. You'll at least enjoy this this you enjoyed the original film

3.  DVD

First Glance - The case and slip cover is lovely due to the new black/red scheme
Audio - Japanese 5.1/Stereo (NO English)
Subtitles - Japanese/English/Chinese
Video - 1080p (you can notice how this is true HD, and not a remaster from DVD)
Aspect Ratio - 1.78:1 (16:9) HD standard
Extras - booklet with character art, few frames of film reel showing Aramaki, Logicoma Beats music video, Promotional clipo, 2 teaser trailers and a regular trailer.

4.  CONCLUSION

-Overall, this is a purchase for fans, and can only recommend so due to its price. It's a 50 minute OVA, and part 1 of 4. While it's definitely worth watching, It's a very steep purchase, and that's just the way the industry is.
-Just like every other ""limited edition"", there's not much to distinguish this ""Blu-ray Japanese Collectors Edition"" from any other edition.
-This is a great film as a standalone. When you consider the iconic ScyFy title of ""GitS"" it holds though, it wasn't as great. The silver lining is that Arise isn't over yet, and has plenty of room to live up to its name.
-All I can ask is that you show your support. The anime industry requires a lot of dedication from talented people, and don't think it gets enough recognition.
-My purchase was an instantaneous *add to cart, checkout, CONFIRM, flips table, SCREAMS!* I was that excited, and don't regret it one bit.

My entire review in 1 conclusive sentence: ""This GitS fan is proud to associate Arise with its GitS counterparts and consider it a well-done, well-timed and traditional spark to the franchise that I hope never dies"".

Should you buy it? Hell Yea!
Is it practical? Hell No!
If you really like GitS, I could genuinely recommend you buy this.",1377561600,43,4737,4.800982800982801

5893720,4,B00E83BBV2,"I know there is alot of naysayers to this Arise series. But honestly I really enjoyed it, it takes more of a detective approach to the world of cyber terrorism with some neat concepts thrown out there. One thing to keep in mind this is not the same universe as S.A.C or any previous G.I.T.S works, this is a re-imagining of sorts for the series and isn't cannon. So treat it as a separate work altogether.",1407024000,3,405,4.342105263157895
5893721,5,B00E83BBV2,"I was pleasantly surprised by this. I love Ghost in the Shell generally, but I wasn't sold on the idea of a prequel (even if it is more of a reinvention of the chronology, I think?). But Arise is great, high energy, fast paced, interesting, and full of the signature twists that are the hallmark of the series. Check it out if you're into things that are awesome.",1406851200,,363,4.352941176470588
5893722,5,B00E83BBV2,"Firstly, this was my first experience with Amazon Instant and it was awesome!! I usually have to wait for downloads and what-not with other video services like on Apple Tv but this was truly instant.  The film itself is masterful.  There is an amazing soundtrack as well provided by Japanese artist Cornelius that is in 5.1 and is mind blowing.",1406246400,,344,4.716666666666667
5893723,5,B00E83BBV2,"An excellent start to the new series if for no other reason than the Major gets real pants and no battlethong. It does a great job of establishing a character that is every bit equal to the movie and series, if somewhat younger and less experienced. One of the best aspects of Ghost in the Shell was always it's prescience in regards to discussion of internet culture, the roles and corruptions of governments, autonomy and humanity. While the philosophical themes aren't as overt in this, they are nonetheless present.",1405382400,4,519,4.842696629213483
5893724,5,B00E83BBV2,"For any anime fan that liked the Ghost in the shell series, this prequel is a must see!  You are taken back before the war to essentially see how the Major comes to work for public security after her military career.  There is action, most of the team you know and love are here (but for reasons you will see, more so in the second Border, are not working together yet).  There is also the spy and espionage theme in all Ghost in the shell series and movies.  You also have the whole mind hack situation and it gets you thinking if we as a society were to start going cybernetic, would it be better or worse? But the best of all, the first model of the Tachicoma, the Logicoma!  I love those guys...",1404604800,,699,4.186567164179104
5893725,5,B00E83BBV2,"Finally some history about the Major!!!!  My one ding on this movie is its to damn short!!!!!  Ghost in the shell is a cult like movie series.  But, even cult movies need some background  history.  This film does that for the Major and others characters form the other movies and the Tv series.  Grab it, turn down the lights and watch it.

5893726,1,B00E83BBV2,"Please be aware that this is a review for the horrible seller, PVP Filmworks and not the bluray, Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Border 1: Ghost Pain. The OVA is fantastic and is a nice reimagining of the franchise we have grown to love over the past 20 or so years and I'll leave it at that.
Back in November I bought what I ASSUMED was a new bluray. I agree that the fault lies partly in my hands but I've been busy with school, life, and spending my free time exploring other endeavors. Tonight I couldn't sleep and wanted to watch the OVA again so I thought what better way to do it than with my ""brand new"", still sealed copy? I noticed something was wrong right when I opened the bag the bluray came ""sealed"" in. There were an abundance of scratches adorning the case and a piece of the case itself popped off. Shaking my head in disgust I opened the case and saw that the miniature guide that was included was marred beyond belief. The pice de rsistance was the fat scratch and large fingerprint adorning the center of my disc.

What a disgusting practice to sell a poorly used item as new. I'll never purchase another product from you people again and I'll be doubly sure to open everything right when I get it to ensure that something like this won't happen again. It's people like you that give 3rd party sellers bad names.",1403049600,,1329,4.316
5893727,5,B00E83BBV2,Always liked ghost in the shell this is alot better now its on blueray. Everything is good on this dvd.the story is good too.,1401753600,,125,4.25
5893728,1,B00E83BBV2,"This is like what if anime headed towards a hollywood mentality of big bangs, lights, and blind pointless action vs character development.

The stories are decent but in the end WHO CARES.  What people grow from and should care about in a GREAT movie or show is CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT.  And in this show it's slow and boring.  I was watching this in the theater and walked out.  A WASTE OF TIME.

I'm getting tired of these ""works of art"" that are just hedonism for the eyes rather than making people think and grow and get up and do something with their own lives",1401321600,2,563,4.41747572815534
5893729,5,B00E83BBV2,"really glad they did some more stories with this Ghost in Shell crew.
a little different look to the younger Major but very well done.
great animation and story.
more coming I hope.",1400198400,,181,4.515151515151516
5893730,5,B00E83BBV2,"I give this an A-Plus, and it is a GREAT introduction to all the Ghost In The Shell films for someone brand new to them.

People who complain about Kusanagi's look being changed in this film aren't ""getting it"" that this is a prequel/origin story; she is younger, and her body is a younger-styled body. In flashbacks, she's depicted in even younger cyber-bodies. Everyone in this film is rendered in younger form; the Chief's hair shows no grey.  Because her body is completely cyber, and only her mind is unique, Kusanagi can take on any form she wishes, which often becomes a plot point later, and you can expect to see the body type (and her personality) evolve over time in the follow-on episodes of this series, until it gets to the one most people recognize.

As to the film, I found it to be well-plotted and directed; the animation is a more subtle blend of CGI and cel animation than the 20-year-old originals, and the look is almost seamless, yet, it's all still quite consistent with the entire series art direction overall. The combat scenes are rendered much more smoothly than what could be done 20 years ago, and fans of action should not be disappointed.

Thematically, this story does a great job of explaining the origin of Motoko's character in a much less ""talky"" way than what we're used to in Stand-Alone Complex. It is very much more ""visual"", which shows some maturity in the writing, that you SHOW without needing to EXPLAIN.  We ""connect the dots"" along with Kusanagi as the story evolves. Where SAC  tended towards bursts of action between rather long, static, kabuki-like scenes of expository conversation, this movie is plotted and written in a more conventional ""western"" style of story-telling, letting action reveal character and plot.

What this episode does very well is establish and extend what is a core debate, thematically, within all the Ghost In The Shell series: what IS ""reality"", and what is ""self"", when so much of ourselves transcends flesh and ""lives"" in a virtual world?  Being unable to trust your own senses is a classic plot device of suspense and horror, and this episode plays up that aspect in very artful fashion; ratcheting-up the mystery and the paranoia thru Kusanagi's character and channeling it thru the audience's eyes.

Excellent and artful hard-style sci-fi, asking probing questions about the nature of being human and probing the boundaries of the Self... accompanied by kick-ass fight and battle scenes and eloquent art direction.  A must-see.",1397952000,11,2510,4.912529550827423
5893731,5,B00E83BBV2,"Ghost in the shell was my very first anime crush. The artistry of the movies was spellbinding at times, (remember the umbrellas in the rain, with the music?)

5893742,5,B00E83BBV2,"I began watching ""Arise"" with a great deal of trepidation; however, I think they did quite well. Although there are some conflicts with the established fluff of the GiTS anime (which is itself at odds with the manga ha!), none of it is distracting. Once you get used to the Major in a late teenager's shell, and not her voluptuous shell, it's smooth sailing. She's a little more vulnerable emotionally here.

The combat is sharp and powerful; her diving is excellent. The scenery is beautiful and the music is a good match. The key to watching this is to not be obsessed with it being an absolute mirror of the originals, but a slight re-imagining retaining the spirit.

I am hungry to see the next episode and am excited to see something else from my favorite anime series.",1390176000,,774,4.601449275362318

While somewhat different than her childhood memories exposed in the stand alone complex series, I felt it still fit in rather well with the entire Ghost in the Shell franchise. There are minor differences between the Manga, the original movie and the Stand Alone Complex/Innocence/Solid State Society and this new look at The Major and Section 9, it shouldn't stop you from enjoying the rich visuals and the amazing feel of the Ghost in the Shell setting.",1388880000,,644,4.758928571428571

IT was great to see this story line created; possibly to bring viewers up to speed on the background of the characters, if the story can be trusted (Plot hint).

-1 Star for crude and amateurish character drawing. Did Kise give the task of animating to unpaid interns? Appalling.
-1 Star for unimaginative sets and environments. Bereft of new ideas, not remotely equal to it's predecessors. Awkward & crude.
-1 Star for ridiculously predictable storylines. They hit every cliche in the book. Not one curve ball thrown. Yawn.
-1 Star for disregarding canon. This is Ghost in the Shell in name only. Sure SAC wrote it's own way, but this is just insulting.
+1 Star for kawaii new version of Tachicoma. Though still not very interesting.

Worth $3.99 standard and $4.99 HD maybe. Maybe a free stream next year.

The soundtrack was expertly interwoven with the film which just made the whole experience amazing.

In SAC and 2nd Gig, Motoko was a very sexy adult without showing much nudity or being overly sexualized.  I would have been fine with more of that then.

Here, she's quite obviously a KID, and she's naked half the time, and the camera just leers at her in a way that grossed me out, and I couldn't ignore.  If not for that, I would have given this five stars, because it's still very much a Ghost in the Shell story.  Whatever the story tells us about her mental age (I don't know how old Motoko's ghost was at this point), her body is the body of a child, and it's REALLY obvious how much the director was into that.  If you can get past that, it's good, but prepare to be sick to your stomach getting used to it.",1435708800,,893,4.192982456140351
