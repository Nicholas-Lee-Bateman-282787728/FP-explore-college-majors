He was to complete his Ninth Symphony (D 944) in his last year, as well as the String Quintet in C major (D 956) and the sad and lovely last three piano sonatas (D 958, 959 and 960).
Schubert was a sick man when he composed Winterreise: this is composition by a man who knew he did not have long to live. This riveting and unconventional DVD with Ian Bostridge and Julius Drake performing and directed by David Alden gives a vivid interpretation of Schubert's state of mind during his last year. Highly recommended.
Despite his short lifetime, Schubert composed over 600 lieder. This song cycle and his last three piano sonatas are my favorites.
Just one note of caution: the English translation on this DVD gives Lindenbaum as Oak Tree. The Lindenbaum is a large flowering deciduous tree of the genus Tilia famous in German poetry and song. The grandest boulevard in Berlin is named Unter den Linden. The most common translations of Lindenbaum are Linden Tree or (mostly in England) Lime Tree.",1238803200,23,1365,5.443396226415095
7928648,1,B0000505FS,"Do you really want to see Bostridge crawling around in a dusty attic? Or tearing down blinds? Or lying flat on his back? What's the point? The music is surely powerful enough to speak for itself, and Bostridge, though he has always been a somewhat wimpish tenor, surely has enough sheer musicality not to need this pretentious posturing and writhing. An old-fashioned embarrassment, for which David Alden must take responsibility, though how Bostridge consented to this grotesque travesty of this sublime song cycle passes understanding. Truly dreadful.",1471046400,2,553,5.367816091954023
7928649,1,B0000505FS,"Excruciating! Like slapping stucco over a marble temple.

No disrespect to Messers Bostridge & Drake, who are world class interpreters of this masterpiece, but the film is trash. The Director came into the project with a ridiculous, over dramatized concept (bad 80/90s MTV - Michael Jackson's 'Thriller' video with a 'Suede' video blended in).

The two gentlemen should have trusted their initial instincts (clear from the Special Feature) and baled early.",1468195200,,456,5.408450704225352

7928651,5,B0000505FS,"Ian Bostridge is the author of the volume ""Schubert's Winter Journey."" Although minor alternatives to the Bostridge personal translations of the Mueller texts, this book is a spendid work of music exposition.  Then to have a DVD of the Bostridge-performance of ""Die Winterreise"" is an extraordinary gift to classical music lovers everywhere.  Everything comes together here exceptionally well: voice, interpretation, music.  One comes away with a better understanding of Schubert's art and also of regret and loss.  Could there be a better complement?
Peggy Lee's question: ""Is that all there is?""  The Bostridge answer: No",1430611200,,623,5.515789473684211
7928652,4,B0000505FS,"This is an dramatization of Schubert's towering song cycle, a enjoy-at-home music video. Ian Bostridge's devotion to Winterreise is well known through his performances and writings. Now he adds the visual elemen. He is not the only one doing this. Matthias Goerne (baritone) offered WIlliam Ketteridge's multi-media version to critical acclaim in Vienna, France and New York. I was prepared to dislike this. I have always experienced Winterreise as a valuable, sometimes shattering, inward journey. Adding the visual element changed the experience for me. While I am always eager to hear a new interpretation and listen repeatedly to favorite recordings, I'm not sure I want to watch this repeatedly worthwhile.
Choosing between tenor vs baritone (and mezzo-soprano) versions depends on personal preferences.  Bostridge has a typical English tenor sound that is quite different from the German baritone. If your current favorites are Fischer-Dieskau or Hotter, you may not like Bostridge's voice.
If you are new to Winterreise and visually inclined, this might be the best path into this masterwork.",1427587200,3,1099,5.502958579881657
7928653,5,B0000505FS,"I found the David Alden film capable of drawing a somewhat younger audience.
 I applaud its intent to interpret in an austere contemporary style, sometimes in old decrepit buildings, sometimes before glaring white background. The crow in particular is very artistic. The throwing of chairs, of atmospheric phenomena, the appearance of people in his former life in their Biedermeier outfits, it all enriches our understanding and is capable of passing it on to a younger generation, which simple recitals are less capable these days.
I consider it a worthwhile contribution to the interpretative tradition that has the potential to create its own reference system. I wish it would be followed perhaps in an even more contemporary style by a new artist.
Not that I wouldn't keep going back to my old favorites though.",1425168000,8,815,5.12781954887218

7928655,3,B0000505FS,"I wasn't entirely fond of the way Davis Alden decided to push things visually. While it is more interesting to watch than your standard recital DVD, I felt as though the dramatic interpretations might've undermined the intention of the cycle by making it the director's vision and not necessarily the composer's or performers'. I do give it 3 stars for those who may not be too familiar with the cycle, but I don't feel like the dramatic representation would be all too appealing to those who commit a lot of time to it.",1401667200,7,520,4.602150537634409
7928656,4,B0000505FS,"This DVD is a very interesting and innovative presentation of Schubert's well-known Winterreise (Winter Journey). Sung in German with English subtitles (if you like), Ian Bostridge, tenor, sings and acts each song in the cycle. It is very illuminating to see the early 19th century brought to life in this way, and the movie makes striking use of light and staging to augment Schubert's relatively spare piano score. While Bostridge is not Fischer-Diescau, I still think this is a worthwhile contribution to the interperative literature. Some see Bostridge as ""over the top"", and certainly some of his concert recital performances have become a bit, shall we say, ""idiosyncratic"", but still Ian can sing well and with effect. I'd buy it again...",1358553600,10,745,5.1652892561983474
7928657,5,B0000505FS,"This video was done very well and the performance of Ian Bostridge and Julius Drake were amazingly wonderful.  The format was certainly ahead of it's time, sparing the viewer another boring recital rendition.  I give it ""A"" for connecting the viewer with the music, but there is always room for improvement.  I would like to see an even more contemporary music-video performance of the Winterreise cycle.",1302998400,3,404,5.090909090909091
