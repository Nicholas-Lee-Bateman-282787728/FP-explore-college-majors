8700201,5,B00T40NSQU,My son and I have done this workout together. It's tough for both of us. I love that the people working out with her range from 13 to college age. The stretch segment is great as well. Looking forward to future volumes of this series. Thanks to Kelly for offering an at-home training option for young athletes!,1437955200,,310,4.456140350877193

8700203,5,B00T40NSQU,"This is a fantastic workout. I didn't buy it at first because I was afraid it was geared too much to the younger people. But since I'm such a huge KCM fan, I ended up buying it. It is tough!  It consists of one minute athletic drills including jump tucks, rolling plank push-ups, broad jumps, etc. in the Athletic part, and then a thorough stretch in the other section. I'm an advanced exerciser and I would say that this is one of Kelly's toughest workouts. I love it that she has her son Zak participating. Kelly periodically teases them in a good natured kind of way during the workout. Well worth it.",1419206400,7,604,4.392857142857143
