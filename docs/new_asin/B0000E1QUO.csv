1930492,4,B0000E1QUO,"I'm always looking for something different to keep me interested and keep my workouts fresh and this was just the ticket.  Lisa Nuziella does an excellent job at cueing the moves and showing proper form.  The warm ups have live percussion and the workout itself has has a nice latin track that keeps you moving to the beat.  There were only a couple things that kept me from giving it 5 stars.  One was that I didn't realize until the end of the video that there was an instructional segment, which you wouldn't know about unless you you went to the ""scenes"" area.  The other is that the warm up and cool down are pretty much the same.  I would have liked to have seen a little bit of variety here, but these are both small items.  Overall, a great workout, just like taking a dance class.  You are constantly moving, adding on combinations and variations of the mambo, until the end, when you complete a full workout, by putting all the combinations together.

I have many workout tapes/dvds and I would have to say this is one of my favorites, it keeps the heart rate up, is fun (if you like dancing) and the time goes very fast-before you know it, the workout is done.

Try something a little different-you'll be glad you did!",1108944000,17,1229,4.4222222222222225
1930493,5,B0000E1QUO,We got the video right away and I am really having fun dong the salsa with Lisa.  The end of the video helped me on a few of the moves.  Now that I'm better I am really working up a sweat and have lost a few pounds.  High recommendation.  Can't wait till the next one and plan to get the hip hop program.,1101081600,6,304,3.7777777777777777
1930494,5,B0000E1QUO,"Excellent NY Salsa aerobic video. It's great.
Lisa has made the best Salsa Aerobic video that we know of.
The music is great. The dancers are excellent. This is an interesting & long video with a slow & basic warm up. A Stretch section. A long Salsa Aerobic section then a cool down. Finally a ""how to section at the end"". It is not a total Salsa video but it is the best so far.
Well worth buying for males & females. The only complaint we have with this video is Lisa is cueing for a right forward basic not a left foot basic. We ask that you mirror her steps not her cue's on the basic NY Salsa step.
One of the reason's we love this video is you know how tired you feel after a day at work well becouse this video workout starts out really gentle & slow you do not feel you are working untill you get energized into working out. This video really tricks you into working out. Also if you are a beginner Salsa dancer this video will also teach you the basic steps & rhythms.",1058572800,6,977,4.09375
1930495,5,B0000E1QUO,"I purchased Lisa's Red Hot Salsa DVD about four years ago and have been using it ever since. I hadn't used it in a while, however I pulled it out last night, danced with Lisa and remembered just how much I love this DVD! Lisa breaks down the moves and goes through the choreography slowly. She does a great warm up and cool down too. This is a really fun DVD, guaranteed to work up a sweat and get the heart pumping! Feels like you're in a Zumba class except in the privacy of your own home. I love this DVD!",1364947200,,508,4.03960396039604
1930496,5,B0000E1QUO,"There are so many workout DVDs on the market and if you don't know where to start working out dance can be an option, and Lisa is a great instructor.  This workout will make you sweat...  She starts off with a warm-up, stretch and then red hot salsa!  This workout is low impact and last about 46 minutes not including a segment where she teaches you each move individually.  There is a live drummer and prerecorded salsa music during the workout which really puts me in the mood for shaking my hips.",1364342400,,500,4.4021739130434785
1930497,5,B0000E1QUO,The red hot Salas is every it Enegry and fun you learning. The dance to plus the steps you get fit!,1363219200,,99,3.761904761904762
1930498,5,B0000E1QUO,"I liked this dvd. Lisa is a great instructor. I'd say some of the moves aren't too easy, because it's ""real"" dancing. But the whole video is slowed down for beginners, but opposed to many other dance videos, Lisa turns up the heat. Lisa includes a good warm up, but you should really strech your inner and outer calves, and also ankles and toes before you try this one. There's a lot of footwork you may not be used to. Otherwise, better safe than sorry, especially if you're a chicken. If you are you can always do the funky chicken, or the hokey pokey.
 Good Luck,
  No switch....Mitch.",1292630400,,588,4.425925925925926
1930499,3,B0000E1QUO,"The cueing on this DVD is simply awful. It's a perfect example of how NOT to cue on an exercise DVD. She does not explain the moves well at all and in some cases, the camera is fixed on the upper body when she is teaching a move (which she barely does). How is that helpful?

After the DVD ends, there is an instructional to learn the somewhat complex moves. Question: Wouldn't that have made more sense at the beginning of the DVD or at least available on the opening menu? It's like a secret at the end. Dumb.

Additionally, the cool down and the warm up are exactly the same. Total lack of imagination. Otherwise, it was somewhat fun. Not great, but really could have been if someone applied common sense.",1287964800,,708,4.356060606060606
1930500,4,B0000E1QUO,"I own a couple of the Dance with Lisa series DVDs and I have always enjoyed them because they are more advanced and they are a great cardio work out because she moves non-stop. My only complaints with this one is that the warm up is far too long and not intense enough. In comparison with her other DVDs, I didn't feel ""warm"" at all after the warm up, plus it was like 15 minutes long.

The workout itself is intense, it always works up a sweat when I do it and I exercise regularly so I'm in pretty good shape. My only complaint there is that the actual routine is only like 20-25 minutes long.",1275091200,,595,4.129310344827586
1930501,4,B0000E1QUO,"This is a fun video for those who know the basics of salsa and would like to work out using some basic turns and improvisations from the dance. I agree with other reviewers that people without any salsa experience will find this video difficult. It is not meant to teach you salsa, and it will probably be a bit challenging unless you have salsa experience or pick up footwork quickly (even then, the fact that she is facing you makes it difficult). However, for salsa enthusiasts looking for something different and enjoyable, this video is great. Beginning salsa students may also enjoy practicing their turns and some improvisation and body isolations. More advanced salseros, however, may become bored with the monotony and not get as great a workout after the first few times. I wouldn't have minded seeing the entire routine done again at the end to a different song with a slightly faster rhythm for an extra challenge to those who want it. Overall, the video is great for a select audience; I recommend this video to my female beginning salsa students.",1206403200,3,1060,4.797814207650274
1930502,3,B0000E1QUO,"The steps and music are fine. I do think, once you get the steps, it is a great cardio workout. The downsides-I had fun at the beginning, but like others, I found the long combination sequences repetitive and long. Nonetheless, those who stated that the moves were hard had good reason.  A huge problem was that Lisa and her dancers face you.  They need to switch up and dance with their backs to you!  When facing you only, you can't see what the legs are doing in the back.  Additionally, when copying the mirror image, the opposite leg (ie:right) to the one that dancers are using (left) will go back on ""1"".  It just gets very confusing at times because you cannot get the gestalt of the moves when you see the dancers at one angle.

It would also be good in the breakdown of the basic steps segment not to simply say ""good"" or ""nice"" after one time of teaching the move.  Do it several times (facing front and back) slowly, then speed it up.  Instead of having one bonus step and silly outtakes (sorry, they are not hilarious, as the DVD suggests), perhaps introduce 5 or 6 other steps that we could use.",1205539200,2,1109,4.375609756097561
1930503,1,B0000E1QUO,Do not buy this or any of Lisa' videos if you are looking for Salsa.  This is a slick marketing product to sell an exercise video in which she is not dancing Salsa but rather dancing Mambo....and very poorly at that. If you are looking to exercise to Salsa you will be confused.....If you are looking to learn Salsa you will not learn it.,1199923200,3,338,4.28125
1930504,1,B0000E1QUO,This video was very fast paced and hard to pick up on. You will only do well if you already have experience.,1197504000,2,108,3.9545454545454546
1930505,1,B0000E1QUO,This video doesn't teach you how to salsa. It is very fast passed. I think if you had some salsa background you'd be fine. But for beginners..no. I really wanted something that taught the steps and then put them together. This just does the steps and you need to catch on. I will say it works up a good sweat.,1185667200,7,309,4.166666666666667
1930506,4,B0000E1QUO,"I had fun with this workout since it never slows down for teaching, it keeps your heart rate up. She does do some of the same moves over & over, but it's still fun. I almost didn't know there was a instructional at the end of the video or in the scenes part of the DVD which helped a lot. She breaks things down well, but there were some moves she doesn't teach at all. Considering I don't learn very fast, I still enjoy this DVD unlike Crunch: Dance Party or Crunch: Hip Hop & Kathy Smith's Latin Dancing is horrible since only 2 people out of 15 can dance & they're all in the back hidden.
There could be more teaching & breakdown as she dances, but if you're looking for non-stop latin dancing & you don't have left feet, this is a good choice.

There's a trailer for this, her other dvds& all the other ones I mentioned at collagevideo com",1183939200,8,843,4.171779141104294
1930507,4,B0000E1QUO,"I thought this was a fun dance workout.  It's basically a routine that is broken down and taught.  You do each step twice and then you add on to what you already have learned.  It goes fast but you have enough chances to work on it.  At the end you do the whole routine 3 times.

The only thing I didn't like about it was that it uses live music instead of a soundtrack.  This is a personal thing, some people may like live better.  I also enjoy doing workout videos where it's one continous routine. It livens it up for me.  She doesn't give much review during the actual workout but does it in a additional segment at the end.  I like this because I can keep doing the workout long after I get used to the steps.  It's a fun latin dance workout!",1169251200,6,747,4.089655172413793
1930508,4,B0000E1QUO,"I am a beginner in salsa dance, and this DVD was my first purchase of a salsa DVD. I love it! The moves are a challenge, it keeps my heart rate up, and watching her and her dancers really inspire me to dance! I can only hope she'll come out with another DVD of more salsa moves. And I do appreciate the breakdown of all the moves. Now, I just have to work on getting them down!",1166227200,2,377,3.909090909090909
1930509,2,B0000E1QUO,THE VIDEO WASN'T AS FUN AS I EXPECTED THERE ARE ONLY ABOUT 4-5 BASIC STEPS.  AS FOR THE DANCERS IN THE BACK THEY LOOK LIKE ID AREN'T REALLY INTO IT.  THIS IS NOT TEACHING YOU HOW TO DANCE SALSA AS IT SAY OR THE MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND IS NOT SALSA.,1148083200,9,248,3.843137254901961
1930510,1,B0000E1QUO,"I thought this would be a fun deviation from my standard workout tapes.  I am not really a dancer and found this hard to follow.  Lisa has an introduction to the steps section, but it is hard to see what she is doing since she is wearing all black.  The warmup was easy to follow, but when you get into the workout it moves so fast you really need some patience to keep trying.  I also quickly realized you can not do this workout wearing standard workout sneakers as you really need to have flexible feet to complete the steps.  Overall I may use this once in a while, but this workout is no where near my favorite.",1125619200,9,616,4.186440677966102
1930511,3,B0000E1QUO,"Pros:  challenging for a beginner, steps are small enough to do in a small exercise space, decent cardio work out

Cons:  essentially only one routine, she teaches you one step at a time and you keep adding an additional step until the full routine is complete - can get boring after a while.  I've only used this DVD once since I've purchased it b/c it's a bit boring and doesn't motivate me enough.",1123977600,4,400,4.438356164383562
1930512,5,B0000E1QUO,"Recientemente recibi este DVD y quede encantada con el mismo. Me encanto el sentir que realmente me estaba ejercitando a la vez que practicaba una pequea coreografia de uno de mis bailes favoritos que es la salsa. Una de las cosas que mas me agrada es que este video conserva el verdadero sabor latino que envuelve y caracteriza a este ritmo. Hasta ahora la unica forma en que disfrutaba de bailar salsa era con una pareja, pero ahora puedo bailar por mi cuenta a la vez que obtengo un muy buen ejercicio.",1115337600,4,505,4.5
1930513,2,B0000E1QUO,"I was expecting a lot of moving, not repetition of complicated steps.  I used to teach beginning ballroon dancing and this was even complicated for me.  Salsa dancing can be very cardio, but the ""somewhat"" cardio section was very short.  If you're looking for a workout this is not the video for you.",1114646400,2,300,4.622641509433962

8001623,4,B0000E1QUO,"LOVE. IT. The moves are so easy to pickup, especially if you're a ballroom dancer or a linedancer (I do both). But even if you're not a dancer, Lisa breaks down the steps at the end of the video so you can do them slowly. The time goes so fast, and before you know it, 50 minutes have passed. I do the steps breakdown as part of my cool-down as well. It is fun and easy to do, and by the time you're done, you are sweating. Sometimes some of the movements were not synchronized with the music soundtrack, but that's a minor issue. I kept focusing on Lisa and not listening to the music when that happened. You will enjoy this workout, especially if you love Latin dancing and music.",1464393600,,682,4.213740458015267

8001628,5,B0000E1QUO,"It's true! Even the uninitiated dancer can have fun with Ms. Nunziella's program.

I was looking for a good cardio routine, and a friend recomended this one.
It was as good as the classes at my health club....I now do this 2-3 times a
week when I don't have time to get to the gym.

I was also surprised by how much I enjoy doing this in the comfort of my
living room....Will try Lisa's other dvd's as well.",1399593600,,407,4.139240506329114
8001629,2,B0000E1QUO,"The DVD starts with a basic moves section, accompanied by a solo percussionist. He is surrounded by various unattended instruments, so I was really excited at the prospect of live music (the back cover even mentions ""move to the sexy Latin beat of Salsa classic with live percussion"") - nuh-uh. Once the workout starts in earnest, he disappears, only returning for the stretch, and we're on to a backing track. A not particularly exciting backing track at that - to be honest, it sounds like the same song on a loop to me.

The workout has a dance class feel, as you repeatedly learn a new move and then add it to everything you've done before - which makes me want to cry with boredom after a little while. Same moves, same pacing, same music... where's the flavour??!?!?!?

Oh, and while Lisa mirror-cues, she and the background dancers haven't changed which leg they're leading with - which means you at home get to learn everything the wrong way around. The basic move (which we return to between each new step) is salsa (although in reverse), and there are a few other recognisable salsa steps, but overall the vibe is more musical theatre-ish than salsa.
