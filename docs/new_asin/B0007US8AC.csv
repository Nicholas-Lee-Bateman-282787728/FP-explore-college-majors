8052098,5,B0007US8AC,"I first discovered ""The Emperor Wears No Clothes"" in 1995 at a ""New Age"" ship in Capitola. For weeks I could not put it down. It impelled me to volunteer the next year gathering signatures for Prop 215.

I finally met Jack Herer last year at the 4/20 rally at the State Capital.

I finally bought the documentary last month. A terrific movie that pulls no punches!",1348185600,,364,4.417910447761194
8052099,5,B0007US8AC,I thought I knew what he was about but the doc tells it all. It just shows that one person can truely spark a revolution.,1344902400,,121,3.88
8052100,5,B0007US8AC,"I learned a lot from watching this movie. I took for granted how well it was done until I started watching so many of the documentaries that followed. This movie, financed by Anita Roddick of The Body Shop, is by far my favorite hemp documentary. This introduction to Jack Herer actually inspired me to become a hemp activist myself!",1327363200,,333,4.661016949152542
8052101,4,B0007US8AC,"Emperor of Hemp is a brief documentary about hemp activist and author Jack Herer. This film documents his life from Goldwater Republican to the ""emperor"" of hemp activism. It includes footage from protests, as well as interviews with Jack, close friends, and work partners.

Although the film is only 60 minutes long, it also includes a brief history of the illegalization of the marijuana plant and the history of the hemp plant as a multi-purpose crop grown around the world, and even grown by our first president George Washington.

I hadn't heard of Jack Herer before watching this documentary, and now I'm glad that I have. He wrote the book ""The Emperor Wears No Clothes"", which is a very detailed and well-researched account of the uses of hemp and the reasons it was made illegal.

Overall, this movie is very interesting, and should be viewed by anyone interested in finding out more about hemp and/or the man who started the hemp movement in this country.",1177372800,15,965,4.836363636363636
8052102,5,B0007US8AC,"Thanks to Jeff Meyers and Jeff Jones for putting together the important new documentary, ""Emperor of Hemp"", and for making one great vehicle for spreading the truth!  This widely acclaimed new production from  Double J Films spotlights the life of Jack Herer, author of the  best-selling book, ""The Emperor Wears No Clothes: Hemp and the  Marijuana Conspiracy"".  While his work has made Jack Herer a hero of  the movement to re-legalize cannabis for adults, this film story of his  struggle is significant for all of us!  It reveals how our own government  attempted to change history to hide the truth about hemp from the American  people.  It also details the racist lies that formed the basis of marijuana  prohibition and explores important facets of the corruption that maintains  the modern drug war.
New Mexico's anti-prohibition cannabis activists  premiered ""Emperor of Hemp"" on public access television in Albuquerque in  conjunction with our drive to recruit new volunteers to work for repeal.  This film perfectly illustrates and encapsulates what are trying to do and  why we have to do it!  Perhaps you've heard that New Mexico's governor,  Gary Johnson, has called for public dialog on ""the miserable failure  of the drug war""?  Well, airing ""Emperor of Hemp"" not only presented  much hidden truth directly to our fellow citizens, we also issued a press  release inviting major media folks to a special showing where we made  ourselves available to answer their questions.  And we gave a video copy to  Governor Johnson.  It's been wonderful to have a tool like ""Emperor of  Hemp"" to tell Jack Herer's story and to help us disseminate accurate  information about cannabis to counter decades of government-sponsored  anti-marijuana propaganda.",947030400,,1757,5.171428571428572
