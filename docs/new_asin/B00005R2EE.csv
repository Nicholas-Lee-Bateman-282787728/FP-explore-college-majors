7951795,5,B00005R2EE,"All of you soap opera nuts will love this movie. You will remember Vincent Irizarry (the handsome Derek in this film) as ""Lujack"" on Guiding Light in the early 1980's. Cassidy Rae found fame on the short lived 90's drama, Model's Inc. This is a true story about a high school senior who gets mixed up with a much older, and married, man. He buys her expensive gifts, and takes her out to dinner and art exhibits. While Amy (Cassidy Rae) thinks she's met her dream man, someone is making her life a living hell. Someone trashes her locker at school, mails a bra to her house with a letter attached, and while driving home someone tries to run her off the road. Who is the mystery person? Let's just say it's not who you think. My daughter & I love to watch this movie. I would tell anyone who's interested to buy it.",1092787200,,815,4.298701298701299
