603671,5,6303234534,"I was doubtful, but this video workout is excellent.  She's a clear and enthusiastic instructor, and it's nice that the workout is broken into three parts.  I'd like to find another Kathy Ireland tape that is similar  -- not interested in the ""12 minute buns"" or high-intensity  aerobics.  This workout is great for new and experienced exercise lovers.  An outstanding value, with no need to purchase weights.  All you need is a  mat or towel and a sturdy chair.  Good luck!",954892800,15,474,4.753086419753086
603672,4,6303234534,"I have purchased several aerobic videos that I have simply put back in the box, because they are too complex to watch and repeat from a TV screen.  This video is wonderful because Kathy takes you through each step  thoroughly.  The steps are very friendly and you feel the results at the  end.  I have used this video over and over again since I bought it, I have  put the others away. I like this video so much that I am now in search for  another Kathy Ireland workout video to add variety to my workout.",944265600,15,506,4.208333333333333

I was very pleased to see it was still available.  I love Kathy Ireland and this is a video that your average woman can do and also for seniors.  I am in my 50's and overweight and this video is doable and makes you feel great when you are done!  FIVE STARS!",1342915200,,416,3.9047619047619047
603853,3,6303234534,This is a video I did at least 10 years ago and remember it being an accessible routine and a challenge. There are interesting body conditioning cycles here that you don't need to be an expert to do. Really enjoyed it then but unfortunately now have to find a more challenging routine to accompany my time at the gym.,1321056000,,317,4.389830508474576
603854,5,6303234534,"I am 5""3, 39 years old and a die hard Kathy Ireland fan.  I have used this DVD since 1995.  I used it so much that I went from purchasing a VHS TWICE to eventually buying the DVD.  I first used it to get in shape for my wedding.  Then, I have used it consistently over the years to shed major weight gain from my three pregnancies.  It is the main tool that I use for weight loss.  IT WORKs!!!  Over the years, I have come to depend on this tape to get my legs muscular and toned.  It works.  It gets rid of my cellulite.  I also have Body Specifics which I highly recommended once you have Total Fitness learned.  So, I do Total Fitness three days a week.  Sometimes, I alternate Total Fitness with Body Specifics 5 days a week.  I like to incorporate outdoor walking with Total Fitness for maximum burn.  I walk a minimum of 5 miles for 5 days.  I walk at least 2 of the 5 days for 7-8 miles.  I recommend doing the video first and walking later.  Walking is something that is easier for us all to do.  Kathy is a great instructor.  Try it!!!!!",1304726400,2,1046,4.064039408866995
603855,5,6303234534,"I first bought this workout as a VHS tape in the mid-90s.  I wound up using it so much that the tape completely wore out - I actually managed to record the audio as an MP3 file just before the tape broke down completely.  I'm extremely pleased to have the DVD.

The aerobics workout is the primary feature - it has a good warmup period and is paced well as an introduction for people who've never done this kind of exercise before.  If you're completely new to this stuff, or just getting back into it, you can definitely use this workout to get ramped up pretty quickly from zero to reasonably in shape.  The second and third segments are strength-building sections, and they weren't something I could complete all the way through right away, especially the 2nd section (tough workout for the legs, also includes pushups and crunches).  After a few weeks (starting from zero) I was able to get the aerobics completely mastered, and could do the entire workout all the way through; later I added weights.  If you stick with it, eventually you will likely graduate to a tougher workout, but this would still be nice for an ""easy"" day.

Even though it's pretty active, you do not need a whole lot of space to do the workout.  You need kind of an L-shape of cleared space, where you can easily step 3 paces forward and 3 spaces sideways, with the area forward being a little wider (you need about enough width in the forward-to-backward space to essentially do jumping jacks).  I've been able to do it in hotel rooms on the road.

I've enjoyed it, and kept coming back to it nearly 15 years later.  When I used it consistently (and watched my calories) I lost over 20 pounds, and that's after adding quite a bit of muscle.  I'm back at it again this summer, and getting through the whole thing today brought a nice sense of accomplishment.

There are a few minor flaws in the aerobics - one or two places where she gets slightly distracted and does an extra few reps of one move, and one where she goes one rep short on another.  Editing could have fixed this.  After a while, though, I actually found myself using these as a way to remind myself how far into the workout I was; they're not too big a deal.",1278892800,4,2203,4.429280397022333
603856,5,6303234534,"Kathy Ireland knows a persons body and how to get it to maximum work out level. Every time I use her tapes or Cd's she always gets me to loose weight and get into good cardiac shape. I feel so blessed to have her helping me stay in shape. She really knows her stuff and you can pause the tape, take a break if it is too much for you in the beginning. She starts out slow though and even in  my worst shape, I have been able to keep going to the end. Her exercises actually cause you to shape your entire body. Even my doctors say that aerobics is the best exercise, even better than going to a gym. I would recommend her tapes and Cd's to everyone. She makes it fun in her work outs too. You almost feel like you are there with everyone working out. Plus it is always done outside, usually close to the ocean so you feel good.",1245196800,,826,4.006060606060606
603857,5,6303234534,"Warning...this is the SAME AS ""Kathy Ireland (VHS) ~ Philippe Torreton ""!! Only the picture is different (and of course, the format!). This is a great video for beginners. Or, if you used to be in shape, but you're not any longer! Its easy to follow...you can do it and not get frustrated and give up. Even though its easy, it works. I lost 30 pounds by doing this (1st and 3rd segment) for 3 months.",1212019200,,400,4.276315789473684
603858,3,6303234534,"The workout is OK, but a little goofy.  Kathy comes across as a dumb supermodel and talks as if we're kids.  Wish she would stop cooing: Good Joooob!  Could also do without the Kathy Ireland lovefest at the end of the video and the dumb comments from the pretty boys (Do you have a sister?!)  Video OK, but not very inspiring.",1211414400,,326,4.295081967213115
603859,5,6303234534,"I had this video on VHS for awhile, years ago. I had been working out at a gym for awhile, so I got rid of the video when we moved. Then it got too hard to make it to the gym around everyone's schedule, so I found myself working out at home again. I re-purchased this video and have been reminded why I liked it so much. I have mostly used the low-impact aerobics work-out. I haven't really tried the other two on here yet. She makes it easy to adjust the intensity to your fitness level, and is very good about demonstrating more complicated moves before bringing them up to tempo. I'd consider this a good beginner to intermediate video. I like it for those days that I just don't feel like exercising but really should do something. It's a nice, uncomplicated workout that you can make as intense or easy as you want to.",1210896000,2,823,4.282051282051282
603860,5,6303234534,"This is an outstanding video! I loved it 10 years ago when I wanted to drop the weight, and I love it today. The excercises are simple to follow and if you want to kick it up a bit, you can use some hand and ankle weights.

You can challenge yourself and do the entire video and get a total body workout - as the title suggests.

This video is great especially for people who are trying to ease their way in (or BACK in) to a excercise program. It's not so strenuous that you dread doing the video, but still more effective than sitting on the couch getting fat.",1207785600,5,562,4.1
603861,5,6303234534,I LOST 60 LBS IN 3 MONTHS DOING THIS VIDEO 6 TIMES A WEEK.  I LOVE IT AND I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE. IT REALLY DOES WORK.,1204502400,,128,3.5714285714285716
603862,5,6303234534,"This DVD is wonderful. The great thing is I can take my lap top anywhere to any room and pop it in and start my work out. In the beginning it is hard, and now it is much easier. But starting out it is easiest enough to get going on a work out and keep it up and build up my stamina and get back in shape. She goes slow enough for you to get the routine down, not too complicated and gives three 20 min. work outs. I would never want to be without this DVD.",1199836800,2,456,3.711340206185567

603924,5,6303234534,This is a fantastic low impact workout that really gets your heart a pumpin.  I originally had this in VHS format but wore it out so i'm anxiously awaiting the delivery of my new DVD format lol.  Even if you get used to this workout and feel as if you aren't huffing and puffing enough to burn off many calories you can always add arms even when Kathy isn't or if you really want to kick your butt add some light strap one leg weights!,1180051200,4,435,4.105882352941176
603925,2,6303234534,I wasn't too pleased with this DVD.  If you are a beginner or need something very low impact than this DVD would be very good for you.  Just wasn't what I expected and wasn't for me.  I gave it to my grandmother who said she didn't even break a sweat.,1179273600,,251,3.98
603926,5,6303234534,"I am not very coordinated and really hated other aerobic workouts I had tried.  This one is fairly easy to follow, Kathy is very encouraging AND there is a plus size woman in the workout who dropped out at different levels - so I didn't feel so bad when I couldn't do the whole thing at first.  I like the way it's broken up because you can do 20 or 30 min on different days and still get a great workout.  I was doing this one before I got pregnant again and this is my video of choice for getting back in shape.",1137110400,13,513,3.9611650485436893
603927,5,6303234534,"Buy this workout if you're a busy mom without a lot of time to workout.  I have used this workout for almost 10 years and I still love it.  If you're short on time, like I am b/c I've got a toddler and a newborn, It's short enough that you still have a little personal time after you've completed the aerobics section but it's effective enough to give you the results you want.  It's also low-impact so there's not a lot of bouncing around which is great for getting back in shape after pregnancy. The additonal segments are wonderful and effective for toning and shaping and you can do those while your toddler and baby are awake!! Please do yourself a favor and buy this one -- I've been working out for years and this is one of the best workouts I've ever used -- it's a keeper.",1136419200,16,781,4.263513513513513

603929,3,6303234534,"This movie had been sitting at the back of my fitness video collection for a few years, but I decided to pull it out the other day and see what it was like.  I consider myself very fit.

The first segment of the video was an aerobics segment.  This part is for major beginners.  I held weights in both my hands and I still could not get my heart rate up at all.  The choreography is easy to catch on to, although her cuing suffers at times.  Kathy seems to struggle the entire time, constantly trying to catch her breath.

Her inability to keep up with the seemingly easy aerobics segment made me hesitate to keep the video rolling into the next segment.  However, I am very glad I did.  The next segment was amazing.  The leg conditioning was better than most videos.  Her arm and ab work was just mediocre, but her leg work was fantastic.

I rarely get sore, but the following day I was definately sore.  The last segment was fine as well.  The legs were better than any other body part.  So, if you need help sculping your legs - this is the video for you.

The 15 minute Q&A with her and her trainer was not too informative and seemed staged.  Hope this review helps!",1121040000,3,1171,4.25
603930,5,6303234534,"I am reordering this tape because the first one I ordered actually warped. This workout is amazing!! I lost 30 pounds that I had gained with my daughter within one month. I could feel the exercises working within a week. I love how it is broken down into 3 parts, amazing!! I still do this workout and my daughter is 6 years old. You can really keep up with the pace of this workout. This is an easy way to stay in shape!!!!!!!!!",1116374400,3,429,4.180722891566265
603931,4,6303234534,"This is a GREAT workout video! I bought it on a whim last week and have used it almost every day so far. I've tried many other videos in the past but this is the one that has inspired me to actually do it most days.

If I eliminate all the walking forward/side-to-side, I can do the whole aerobic section in the 3'x5' chunk of space next to my bed, about the space a yoga mat takes up, and still get my heart rate going. This is important for me because if I'm bumping into furniture or have to clear space and prepare before I even get started, I never get started.

The aerobic section is low impact, no stupid dancing or irritating cheerleading section in the background. It's basically some walking in place, lifting the knees, stepping side-to-side, the ""grapevine"" and some bicep curls. It gets your heart going but at the same time it's easy... and also easy to build on. I imagine as I get more in shape it will be easy to add things to this basic routine to make it more challenging. In this way, I feel like it's a great investment and I'll be able to use it for a long time to come.

I'm picky about music, and this one is good- it's just a basic drum beat- which is enough to get your toes tapping and give you something to play with. No crazy obnoxious rave music or (worse!) disco.

It's also fun to do with a partner! My fiance and I have done it together a few times and have had fun playing with its basic format and adding our own silly dance moves.

Kathy Ireland is a good leader- she seems a little nervous, repeats herself a few times, and is easy to heckle and talk back to when you need a laugh to keep your spirits up. She's clearly human in this video, so don't be turned off by the 'supermodel' thing.

I've held back from five stars for a few reasons:

1. I've only done the aerobic section, so I can't comment on the body conditioning or lower body workouts.

2. It doesn't specifically say that it's for beginners, and somebody who is more advanced might find it a tad too easy. However, as I said before, that's a benefit in disguise. With a little creativity, this workout could be the basic structure you build your more advanced routines around.

3. A few of the warm-up stretches don't feel right in my body... so I just don't do them. I do some yoga and make stuff up that stretches the same basic muscles.

If you're looking for a fun, flexible beginners routine that you can play with and modify as you go, this one is top notch.",1110585600,5,2467,4.240938166311301
603932,4,6303234534,"The tape is broken into three parts. The first is aerobics and you just do alot of repititions of low impact moves. It's not very challenging but you can always add 3 pound weights for some of the moves for arms or leg weights. [that's wat i did] The second part consist of toning your legs mostly. You can REALLY feel the exercises for these. The third is basically also toning for legs and for abs but aren't as challenging so i suggest you to do your own sets for those. After all that, they have a 15 minute question session. The workout portion of the tape adds up to about a little more than an hour =/ so might not be good if you have a tight schedule. Also, i personally think the only reason they sweat so much is because it was so hot out there lol.",1060560000,,759,4.100671140939597

I had never been one to work out very much so I wanted something low impact (and hopefully easy). At first it was challenging because I was out of shape, but very soon it became an enjoyable and quick workout. I've only done the first workout on the video, and I still use it all these years later! I kept a VCR for years just so I could still use this video, and was excited to see that it had been released to DVD. Now it is my ""go to"" workout on days that I don't want to do much or if I'm sore from a hard run. I also use it as a warm up on occasion to get a little cardio on weight lifting days.
