8031161,4,B0002S64NM,Interesting with a twist. I enjoyed this movie and as usual the streaming from Amazon Prime was excellent.,1427500800,,106,4.944444444444445
8031162,4,B0002S64NM,"Acting was a little rough (Unconvincing) for some of the characters.  The poorest job done by the beautiful female villain, Sandra Vidal.  However, the two on the cover, Tricia Helfer and Judd Nelson, did a very good job. Was more like a made for TV movie, which it probably was.  I still liked it.  Great story line with a switch at the end.",1426636800,2,342,4.380952380952381
8031163,1,B0002S64NM,"OK, I confess I started watching this because I was bored and it had Tricia Helfer.  About 10 minutes in I gave up.",1426118400,,115,4.0
8031164,4,B0002S64NM,Product (DVD) arrived early & in great condition.  Have not had a chance to view this movie yet but I can almost bet that it will be good as I like all of Judd Nelson movies.  He's an excellent actor in all movies that I've seen him in.,1399766400,,236,3.8958333333333335
8031165,1,B0002S64NM,"Someone adapted a lousy ass attempt at a script from a book called White Rush, Green Fire, now it could of been much much better if someone from Hollywood or some Independent guy did it but this is just plain crap. While on a camping trip, 3 guys and 2 girls hear gunfire in the woods and that would be a drug deal gone bust. Soon, they take the drugs for themselves but one of them gets nabbed by dealer Judd Nelson (Breakfast Club, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back) who is an undercover DEA agent and he wants the woman's friends to bring the cocaine back to its rightful owner otherwise her friends are dead. So, the big honcho dealer sends out a deadly assassin which just happens to be a Brazilian woman which an itchy kill finger. On the other line, the gang with the cocaine have to deal with smart ass cop Chick, played wildy over the top by Louis Mandylor (The Game Of Their Lives) and I'm not saying he's good he isnt, he just gives an annoyingly over the top performance....too bad Costas Mandylor wasn't in here. Anyway, the script sucks, the acting is bad, only Judd Nelson has some spark and he hads a little life to the story but this is just too retarded. Also starring Charles Schlatter (Diagonis Murder).",1129680000,4,1220,4.378854625550661
