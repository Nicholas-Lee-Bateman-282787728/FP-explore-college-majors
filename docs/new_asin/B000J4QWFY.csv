2666950,4,B000J4QWFY,"The Quick and the Undead is a spaghetti western with zombies instead of Indians. The movie starts our great and is well-paced but drags towards the end when the zombies maraud the house. The dialog is typical cowboy cheesy and the acting, while somewhat hackneyed and stilted serves its purpose well even though the characters are stereotypes. While this movie is certainly no masterpiece, it does help and improve on the genre, so as zombie movies go, it's quite good. The zombies themselves are definitely Romero descended but aren't quite the shambling corpses they started out as.

*Spoiler Alert*
The only real problem I have with this film is the hero is somehow immune  to the Zombie Virus. WTF is up with that?",1218240000,3,718,4.829268292682927
2666951,3,B000J4QWFY,"What can I say about this movie? I think people are being way too hard on it. I love the Z-Grade zombie movie, the DIY microbudget gore fests, so I picked this one up for cheap not expecting much, and I actually found myself enjoying it. The plot is pretty good, and it is pulled off decently, the acting is so-so, not bad, I've definitely seen worse. The zombies look pretty good, and the gore is above average as well. It has all of the elements a watchable zombie movie needs, and while the pacing could be tightened up, and maybe some more zombie action could have been included, I was never really bored by the movie. It also had some pretty good production value as well, this is no camcorder movie. It is not a Romero zombie flick, but is still better than a lot of crap out there, I would call this an above average zombie movie, not great by any means, but still a solid addition to anyone's zombie collection.",1207612800,5,919,4.317919075144508
2666952,1,B000J4QWFY,"cool idea terrible movie. I swear the main character wanted to make love to his gun a few times, he wanted to cram it up his cheeks, and I couldn't understand if this movie took place in the old west or present day.  I mean why would all the bounty hunters dress like the old west when basically all the zombies wore clothes of today, its stupid.",1198540800,3,346,4.164179104477612

2666954,1,B000J4QWFY,"Firstly, I would like to say that I would rather be EATEN by zombies than EVER watch this again!

If it were the last film on Earth I would personally burn it and go read a book.

As stated before by others, the concept is quite interesting. But the overall execution of the story simply fell flat on its decaying face.

It felt as if the acting was being done by high school students. High school students with no talent that is. The actors were wooden and lacked any interest in their characters.

I didn't care much for the special effects, but I did like the concept of the dead moving at varying rates of speed depending on their stage of decay.

If they had taken this good concept and, instead of placing it in a retro-future western shoot'em up, placed it in the actual wild west of the 1800's than maybe they could have pulled it off... MAYBE.",1189987200,5,852,4.333333333333333
2666955,2,B000J4QWFY,"I just rented this movie and would like to give a small review to any interested in this zombie film.  I'm a huge zombie fan and I must see any movie relating to the undead.  I've seen just about all of them and I'll say that this one is mediocre at best.  The idea is great and I would love to see someone else make a sequel along the same idea as this movie (but done better of course).  It's a great concept but executed poorly by the actors/production.  The movie does have a good quality to it, but I have to be honest and say it's the actor/director/producers fault at ruining the vision.  This film will show a hint of promise, but then suddenly will leave you utterly dissapointed.  I was especially dissapointed by the lack of zombies in the film being replaced by useless dialogue and some totally confusing scenes I think the director may have wrote on the spot.  Seeing movies such as this makes me realize just what a talent and a genuis George A. Romero is with what he did with his films.  I would not recommend this film, even though it has a some decent gore moments.  I feel that this could have been a really good movie, despite what resources the production had, it totally missed the mark :(",1166486400,4,1212,4.323008849557522
2666956,1,B000J4QWFY,"First off, i think the other review is written by the director, or at least one of his friends.  How can he know about Flesh Keeper, when the film isn't listed on IMDb or any of that.  But whatever.  As i said in my review title, the story here was pretty interesting, and the concept of combining an old style western with a zombie movie is intriguing.  Unfortunately, the lead actor exudes the charisma of most socks.  If you're going to make your lead this sort of iconic, Man With No Name/Snake Plissken type guy, make sure the lead has the ability to be as interesting as Eastwood or Russell.  They should have tried to get Nick Chinlund (who the actor resembled a bit anyway) - HE could have pulled this off.  Also, the last third or so of the film is shot with that blue filter Michael Bay liked to use on Armageddon, except here it made no sense other than (I suspect) to cover up the fact that it was shot during the day.  It looked ridiculous and was very distracting.  All in all, I hope that the supposed Flesh Keeper is given to those more capable of pulling it off, as its a shame such a great concept was buried by such a mediocre film.

p.s. the makeup effects were quite good, i will give it that.",1162252800,8,1214,4.239130434782608
2666957,5,B000J4QWFY,"Described as a futuristic zombie western, newcomer director Gerald Nott combines elements of classic zombie horror (Night of the Living Dead) with that of the spaghetti western (The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly) creating a highly entertaining, original zombie-action flick. The laconic Ryn Baskin hunts zombies for bounty in a world where a deadly virus has turned 75% of the world's population into flesh eating zombies. Imagine Sergio Leone doing horror movies in the 60s and you'll have a general feel for this flick. Clint Glenn's protrayal of Ryn brings back memories of those long sorely-missed spaghetti western heroes like Clint Eastwood in his hey day. Parrish Randall plays Blythe Remington, adding a dash of southern charm to this otherwise treacherous but daper villian. Rounding out the cast as Ryn's rival bounty hunters are Erin McCarthy, Dion Day and Jeff Swarthout. Also of note are the performances of Nick Giacobbe as the treacherous side-kick Hans and Toar Campbell as one of the most frightening looking zombies to come around in years. The Quick and the Undead shows that director Jerry Nott knows how to deliver a punch and his forthcoming film, The Flesh Keeper, will drive the point home!",1160611200,9,1212,5.065
8149246,2,B000J4QWFY,"Quick and the Undead (2006)

 This low budget flick takes itself seriously, so I will return the favor.  The builders apparently intended to make a hard hitting Zombie movie using Clint Eastwood style spaghetti westerns as a model, which might work out very well if done with some skill.  Star Clint Glenn plays bounty hunter Ryn Baskin with a genuine homage to Eastwood.  He squints and smokes thin cheroots.  He doesnt say much either.  In fact, in the shortish film no one says very much. In further fact, no one does very much.  Most of the film time is wasted on non essential shots of people walking through the woods and the like.  In a Zombie film we would rather see Zombies getting shot or at least chasing the still living characters around.
 The story begins some eight decades into a Zombie Apocalypse.  There remains enough of a society to pay bounty hunters, like Ryn Baskin, a fee for snuffing Zombies.  They bounty claims are satisfied by the presentation of the pinky fingers sliced from the dispatched Zs.  The conflict in the story comes from our hero getting shot and robbed by a rival band of bounty hunters.
 All good, you might rightly think.  And the concept is actually a good one.  The acting, while not Oscar winning we can accept as good enough for a Zombie movie.  We don't expect a Clint Eastwood level of work from a Clint Eastwood impersonator.  The cinematography also comes well up into the good range and not just good enough.  Even the sound, though a bit uneven at times is ok.  The Zombie make up in the close ups we call good to excellent and the Zombie mobs are filmed from a distance or in the dark so the mass make up is ok too.  The Zombies move with traditional slow staggering.
 We have an innovation where a captive Zombie eats his own innards and doesnt seem to mind, but why would he?  A story subplot has the bad bounty hunters deliberately infecting humans in order to stimulate the bounty business, so they have a captive Zombie.
 The pace of this film leaves much to be corrected.  Slow and meandering describes it well as does less than fully fleshed out.  The post-apocalypse society is never shown nor described in enough detail for us to understand it.  We only see a couple of non central characters living people.  How do the living humans thrive well enough to afford to pay the bounty hunters?  We just don't know.
 But what sinks this movie is the sloppy continuity.  In the 21st Century we do not expect severed fingers to magically grow back.  We do not expect empty guns to suddenly begin firing again. We certainly don't expect people to totally (and safely) ignore a quartet of Zombies chowing down on a guy ten feet away.  We surely don't expect lethal Zombie slayers to allow Zombies to walk right up to them and eat them.  Did they shoot this film without a story board to guide them?  The project has a slap dash taste to it as though they shot the film without a lot of forethought.
 Writer, director, producer Gerald Nott has a career in the movies to this day.  But this might be a first.  His career in the movies began AFTER his experience with Quick and the Undead.  He latched onto $105,000 to make this movie, more than many other Zombie flicks and much more than some.
 Star Clint Glenn has gone on to have something of a career as an actor.  The other cast members, Parrish Randall, Nicola Giacobbe, Dion Day and Erin McCarthy have been less successful but have had a few more roles.
 My favorite line from the movie-Bad Bounty Hunter says They told me you were dead.  Hero Ryn Baskin replies Better dead than undead.
 Not rated but should have an R for violence but no naked stuff.  It runs a very short one hour and 18 minutes.  This promising idea needed a lot of fluffing up to come to completion so it gets only one and a half brains.",1442966400,,3820,4.471014492753623
8149247,3,B000J4QWFY,"The artwork on the cover is just artwork, the dead zombie with the gun on the cover never appears in the movie, so scratch one off for false advertisement.
The movie is just ok,

Okay acting, and nothing worth getting scared over, even the gross parts aren't really that bad, so scratch off another star.

As a zombie genre lover, I would say I bought this movie expecting more, and was a little disappointed, but it is a good additive to a zombie movie collection...
Watch once then store, that's really what this movie is good for.",1400284800,,533,4.484536082474227

8149254,2,B000J4QWFY,"Biological warfare leads to the creation of a landscape littered with zombies roaming the land.  An unidentified man gives himself an experimental injection with the hope of virus immunity.  Bounties are paid to hunters for killing zombies; payments are based upon appendages collected at the kill site.  Sounds like a great premise, right?  Too bad the movie ruined it.

This movie is from A to Z bad, here are a few examples:
Acting - Not a single cast member utters a convincing line; they're horrible.
Blood - B should have been for budget, because neither ketchup nor koolaid is a convincing alternative for blood.
Cast - They're atrociously untalented, with preposterous accents and absolutely no tangible emotion whatsoever.
Direction - It's all over the map and disorganized.
Filming - Aside from one or two decent scenes, the whole thing gives off the feel of a high level high school AV club production.
Lighting - Dark and amateur at best, there are scenes in which some color scheme is attempted, but it never accomplishes what the director wants.  And I think they fell in love with the color blue for some reason.
Makeup - Put on by a blind transvestite.
Protagonist - A cross between a weather-beaten desperado who carries his gun in a guitar case, and a poor man's Hugh Jackman from Van Helsing
Settings - The settings are essentially someone's backyard and one or two low rent properties.
Zombies - Aside from the soundtrack, the zombies were the only redeemable aspect of the movie.

Pass on this one unless you want to become a zombie in the little over an hour this movie will sap from your life.",1231113600,3,1616,4.770609318996415
8149255,4,B000J4QWFY,"Quick and The Undead was original. The story was a basic western story but with zombies thrown into the mix. I highly enjoyed this film and i'm surprised not more people like it. The dvd comes with a behind the scenes feature that is almost half an hour, which was a surprise. I recommend this to horror fans who like something different.",1226448000,,338,4.467741935483871
