8274178,3,B0019K4YVG,I bought this out of boredom one day because I needed something new to watch and was on a reality tv binge. I can see why they didn't make a second season. This show wasn't all that good. But it's still packaged in a nice case at least.,1484697600,,236,3.9375

8274180,4,B0019K4YVG,"This show is so funny, and entertaining. The Olly's are idiots, but entertaining. Jannelle two faced. Erin is a sweetheart and Nick can be a little biotch sometimes.
The DVD came really fast, in two days I think. The only problem I have is both discs were loose in the case, and they got scratched up. The DVD skipped at some parts, and I couldn't even watch some parts which was irritating, but it was still fun to watch.",1355875200,,422,4.3544303797468356
8274181,5,B0019K4YVG,"The DVD release of E!'s hit television show, ""Sunset Tan"" is great! It features all 12 episodes and special features. The first disc includes the first 7 episodes (although the episode guide included in the box includes an error and says the first 6) and the second disc contains the rest and special features. The special features included are deleted scenes, red carpet interviews from the cast, and the Olly Girls Guide in which the Olly Girls teach you how to do random things.

It is packaged different than most DVDs. The cover and back cover are on the slipcover and the box (a traditional DVD box) has no cover inserts, so it is clear. There is a paper insert with a list of episodes and on the back is an ad for season two. Disc one is on a spindle and disc two is packaged regular.

It features appearances from celebrities like Britney Spears, Chelsea Handler, Chris Kattan and more. It also features the episodes about the  Sunset Tan opening in Vegas and who will be manager of it which creates a lot of drama. One thing I didn't like was that everything is censored. I would prefer that the language was uncensored and nudity was uncensored like The Girls Next Door DVD releases.

Pretty good DVD release and I hope that Lionsgate releases season two soon!",1237939200,4,1270,4.557017543859649
8274182,5,B0019K4YVG,"I love this show. I use this as a teaching tool for my HS job readiness classes. It's so helpful to discuss the issues on the show like, supervising your friends, dating co-workers, socializing with co-workers etc.",1231113600,5,214,4.8108108108108105
8274183,4,B0019K4YVG,"I don't know why this is so addictive; I guess it's the fact that watching superficial, stupid rich people and ditzy blondes go about their day to day life, makes my life seem normal.  I mainly started watching this because I love LA and so love the shots of it, but for some reason I couldn't stop watching it.
The two Olly girls are stupid and ditzy and annoying, but watching them screw up time after time makes me laugh.  Nick is the best in this because although he totally admits to wanting to get the best job for the money, he is very caring about the business and has his head screwed on right as far as running a business (he's not the owner, but does a great job and is their highest seller.  He even sold a stupid woman $1200 worth of goods and services just for her young girls school photos - really highlights the wrong in LA).
The first scene in this season is Britney Spears getting sprayed, and the list of celebs is endless.  It is no doubt a highly successful venture and it is that side of the show that I also enjoy.  It's definately not going to enhance anyones brain function by watching Sunset Tan, but it's good for a laugh and light fluffy fun.
On a final note, the one thing I'd HATE to see as a result of this show, would be an increase in sunbed tanning.  Melanoma's are born this way for sure and I hope young impressionable kids don't think it's cool to get their tans this way - it's certainly not healthy at all - just stick to the spray.",1220140800,18,1472,4.202127659574468
