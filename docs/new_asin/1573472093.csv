192079,2,1573472093,I got this DVD simply because my wife and I watched it many years ago when we were just married.  For laughs it is worth the spend but I think I have matured and would rather get a better buy such as Close Encounters..,1264464000,3,218,3.9545454545454546
192080,3,1573472093,"This is easily one of the silliest coming of age sagas ever made. Made in Canada and starring Judy Landers as ""Miss Xenobia"", an alien disguised (with excessive makeup and gigantic hair) as a college biology teacher. ""Dr. Alien"" is somewhat like ""Weird Science"" combined with ""Hobgoblins"" in overall texture and concept. The plot revolves around the transformation of Billy Jacoby from nerd to extremely cool (for mid 1980's Canada) studmuffin. Along the way many silly situations typical of the genre happen, and poor Billy Jacoby gets a comical looking, yet disturbing additional appendage (which talks, but it's not what you think) that helps him out with the ladies.
I am particularly fond of the scenes in the bar, both for the rankness of the music and later the Hobgoblins-esque (though with better special effects) brawl. Three stars, it definitely has mid 1980s camp value, which will make you laugh if you are so inclined, but it isn't outrageous enough to watch repeatedly.",1077580800,10,984,5.042944785276074

7798237,5,1573472093,"Love this 80's movie.

I forgot that it has the hot girl from ozzy's ultimate sin video,and she is very cute.

Silly 80's sci-fi comedy with lots of eye candy.

Judy Landers is so cute, it was very funny when she got her head stuck in the trash can.",1506816000,,249,4.040816326530612

7798245,3,1573472093,"This movie is pretty bad, even for a Full Moon release, but there is some decent gratuities nudity so I added a star. The audio mix is messed up too, I had to continually be adjusting the volume from max to low to try to follow the dialog. Pretty much just a movie for 80's teen sex comedy completest, I imagine this movie to be pretty hard to get through for the average viewer, if you're looking for 80's teen sex comedies this is pretty much bottom of the barrel, there are 100 better examples of the genre that are much better than this one.",1456185600,4,545,4.2
