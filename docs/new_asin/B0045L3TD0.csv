I have converted it to NTSC and can view it on my Blu Ray player but it will only give you a letterbox view.
You can play a PAL format on most computer DVD r Blu Ray drives these days and watch on your monitor. But you can't play them on Region 1 DVD or Blu Ray players connected to your 65 inch TV.
As far as the movie goes I think it is overrated as a horror film. It's a nice try.",1519689600,,519,3.56140350877193
