7933031,5,B000056WQS,"Vance Pierson (Barry Sullivan) and his wife, Verna (Sherry Moreland) are a happily married couple w/ a lovely daughter. Vance is a successful engineer, busy during his off hours, searching for his dream home. One day he stumbles into a house where a woman named Laura Blanco (Martha Hyer) is about to commit arson. The two strangers strike up a bargain, where Vance will buy the house instead. Things get complicated when they fall in lust w/ each other. For a while, Vance enjoys his affair, but decides to stick w/ Verna. When he dumps Laura, he figures that she'll simply fade away. Unfortunately, he's misjudged his new mistress, and her insane jealousy. Horror erupts when Laura uses her firebug skills to remove the human obstacles in her way. Vance, now minus his family and burned beyond recognition, seeks vengeance. PYRO: THE THING WITHOUT A FACE is a rather grim tale of madness and fiery death. Sullivan is quite convincing in his tortured role. He's a sympathetic ""monster"", much like THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA or DARKMAN. One feels for him, and understands his hateful fury. Deserves to be more widely known...",1426291200,,1123,4.854166666666667

7933033,5,B000056WQS,This movie is a great portrayal of horror in the 1960s.  Also the author Gene Barry is an excellent actor.  I enjoyed it so much and I watch it over and over again.,1401494400,,164,3.9393939393939394
7933034,2,B000056WQS,"I had heard about this film all my life and never got a chance to see it.  According to my Aunts in the late 60's this was a ""not to miss"" and ""if you ever get the chance"", type film.  Maybe it was spectacular and a new plot for its day, but I found it to be slow moving, unexciting and predictable by today's standard.",1384300800,,319,3.8923076923076922
7933035,3,B000056WQS,"Troma Video has released a Euro rarity from the sixties Director Julio Coll's 'PYRO'-1964 which is not a true Horror film per se but has elements throughout including calling the protagonist a disfigured monster hence the Horror gig.  It has been said it is a forerunner to Director Adrian Lyne's 'FATAL ATTRACTION'-1987 and Director Sam Raimi's 'DARKMAN'-1998  but not by much.  It has the revenge motif but it emerges as a Euro excursion of the disfigurement genre which was in many titles at that time mostly gothic horrors.  Barry Sullivan and Martha Hyer are the American actors and many familiar Spanish faces are peppered throughout including a young Soledad Miranda before she worked with Jesus Franco and became his muse in a series of excellent erotic films until her untimely death in 1971 from a car crash.  The film is produced by Sydney Pink who gave us 'THE ANGRY RED PLANET'-1960, 'JOURNEY TO THE SEVENTH PLANET'-1961, and 'REPTILICUS'-1962 which were co-written by Ib Melchior.  'PYRO' is his best work but seems to be lethargic in spots never really gripping you as it should.  Troma releases it in a nice transfer with slight scratches but who can quibble because of its rarity and has bright colors considering its age.  Sullivan would go on to another great Euro Sci-Fi classic Director Mario Bava's 'PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES' aka 'TERRORE NELLO SPAZIO'-1965 also released by American International who released 'PYRO' in the states.  Hyer would make a few more films and then marry Producer Hal Wallis and it is her performance which steals the show.  Recommended for lovers of true Euro rarities.",1336780800,2,1617,4.977695167286245

7933037,3,B000056WQS,"Greetings from Tromaville!!
This film is basically about a guy who gets revenge on his mistress/girlfriend who seemingly starts fires. It reveals what a 4th degree burn is (total carbonation of the skin) and clearly had an influence on such modern films as ""Fatal Attraction"" and Sam Raimi's ""Darkman"". Despite this, it is dated has loses steam after the first thirty minutes. The extras are simply the Radiation March, and an interview with the script writer.
FYI: This film bombed in America, but was a blockbuster overseas with it's alternative title: ""Phantom of the Ferris Wheel"".
