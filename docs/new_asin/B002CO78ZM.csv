From the uplifting joyfulness of Mathieu Ricard and his late teacher, Dilgo Kyentse Rinpoche, to the mesmerizing photography and cinematography, the fascinating portrait of his family and of himself, and the way Mr. Ricard gently and humbly lives his very busy and amazing life.  We are continually captivated by this inspired and inspiring man. One cannot help feeling touched by his devotion and humility. Highly recommended!",1285027200,22,466,5.383561643835616
8364324,5,B002CO78ZM,"This film is a great overview over a fantastic case of total life transformation... Starting off as a biologist at the Pasteur Institute in France, Matthieu's life took a completely different direction and he went on to the Himalayas to study with the last generation of great Tibetan masters that still lived in Tibet...

This film, very well shot, depicts very up and closely not only his life story, but also the humanitarian work that Matthieu has developed since, something he assures us, has also been his source of fulfillment in life!

A must see for buddhists and non-buddhists!",1281744000,17,587,4.91919191919192

I was somewhat disappointed with this film (although I may have had ungrounded expectations).
I was hoping for something that offered something to chew on - some useful insights - something that could be pondered and learned from.  But this was more like a travelogue.
This film is an autobiography of somebody I don't know.  He interacts with a number of high-ranking monks whom I have no understanding of (and therefore little interest in).  The film is in part a promotion for some orphanages.  Nothing wrong with that, but not what I was hoping for.

Another complaint is that no subtitles are provided for the English dialogue.  The speakers are non-native English speakers and it is difficult to understand what they are saying.  I had to watch it a second time to understand it better.

There is indeed some beautiful photography.  The monk who is the subject of the film seems a likeable fellow and I'm sure his fundraising is doing some good.  Nonetheless, if I had it to do over again, I would not have purchased this film.",1263686400,26,1159,4.627450980392157
