8296282,4,B000QJDF8Y,"Mail Call is one of the more interesting and fun series on TV these days. R. Lee Ermey is a terrific host, taking on the persona of Drill Sergeant Hartman from Stanley Kubrick's film, ""Full Metal Jacket.""

When I saw that this package for seasons 1-6 was only $51 I couldn't resist. But when I received them I understood why the set was so cheap. There are only seven episodes per disc. See, these aren't the full seasons, but only a ""best of"" selection of episodes from each season! I should have read the product description more carefully, but in my exited haste I failed to do so. Some of the discs lack menus and play automatically in the DVD player. The bonus features included are dissapointing; only R. Lee Ermey's bio and filmography, which can easily be found on the web.

All in all, watching the included episodes is a fun way to kill time, but it would be cheaper to watch the show on the History Channel, as most of the Mail Call episodes they air are re-runs anyway.",1205539200,,981,4.414364640883978
