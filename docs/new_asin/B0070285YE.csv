5045940,5,B0070285YE,"To clear up some confusion, this set is perhaps best described as the American version of the set available to purchase at Amazon UK.  The UK set was released by the History Channel UK, and according to the Amazon UK listing, the DVD portion of the package contains 6 Titanic programs produced by History Channel US (which appear to be available on DVD in the US in various History Channel collections).  If you go to the Amazon UK listing, you even see the History Channel logo several times on the packaging.

For whatever reason, the History Channel did not distribute the set in the US.  Because of this, the DVD portion of the American version does NOT contain the 6 History Channel US Titanic programs.  However, it does contain a History Channel UK program that, as far as I can tell, has never been released on DVD in the US.

Here is a complete breakdown of the package:

1 - ""Titanic: A Tale of Two Journeys"" DVD (45 minutes, 16:9 anamorphic widescreen)  This 2005 program was produced by the History Channel UK, which sponsored a contest whose prize was a submersible trip to visit the Titanic wreckage.  The program tells the story of the Titanic while following the contest winner and a guest as they prepare for the voyage and go underwater to survey the wreck site.  As such, this is not an in-depth analysis of the voyage and sinking of the Titanic, but it provides a nice overview of the event, and seeing what goes into visiting the wreck site is interesting.  And while the DVD case doesn't say so, the program is presented in anamorphic widescreen format, and it looked great on my LED TV.

2 - ""The Band Played On"" CD (73:35, 25 tracks)  Mainly original recordings from the 1910s, usually as cleaned-up as possible considering when they were recorded.  Includes artists like John McCormack, Scott Joplin, and Ada Jones & Billy Murray, and songs like ""Come Josephine In My Flying Machine,"" ""Let Me Call You Sweetheart,"" and ""On Moonlight Bay.""  No copyright information is given for the songs, but it's clear that a few later recordings of popular 1910s/Titanic songs (for example, Jo Stafford, who was born in 1917, sings ""Nearer My God To Thee"").  Some tracks don't sound spectacular, mainly due to age, but overall, this is a well-chosen selection of music from around the time of Titanic.

3 - ""The Story of Titanic"" by Henry Hirst  This 2011 hardcover book measures 8"" x 5.4"" and contains lots of great pictures with a solid amount of text about the history of Titanic.  Nowhere near as comprehensive as the incredible ""Titanic: An Illustrated History"" by Don Lynch and Ken Marschall, but ""The Story of Titanic"" is a very compact book that suits this collection.  One very minor quibble is that the book is technically 128 pages - the back cover states ""132 pages,"" but when you look at the numbering, they count pages by starting with the front cover as page 1 and ending with the back cover as page 132!

4 - 26 reproductions of Titanic memorabilia  No reproduction of the NY Times, but I can't find any fault with the wonderful collection of blueprints, telegrams, ID cards and other items here.

As shown in the images at the top of the listing for this collection, the packaging is simply wonderful, showing that the time was taken to make it right.  Various Titanic images and text is printed around the package.  The entire package is very sturdy.

Overall, this is a wonderful collection of Titanic items.  I bought this at Target for $19.99, which truly seems like a bargain when you consider what is inside the package.",1335139200,19,3554,4.672025723472669
5045941,4,B0070285YE,"Unexpectedly this box set is packed with a hard back sized book, an envelope of dozens of little letters, cards, notes, and then the DVD set.  I have not had the time to watch the video yet, but I really like the box, book, and memorabilia reproductions.  If this is priced at $19.99 or below, you should be happy with this purchase.",1334534400,9,333,4.354838709677419
5045942,2,B0070285YE,"First, let me start off by saying this is a very nice collection. The memorabilia packet is especially fascinating. One of the reasons I purchased this is because of the NY Times replica. When I received it in the mail, the replica wasn't in it. I was very disappointed. Amazon did offer to let me return the package, but I decided to keep it, minus the NY Times. However, I have noticed that the NY Times replica has been dropped from the product description now. Other than that, this product is very nice to add to your Titanic collection.",1333843200,8,542,4.484848484848484
5045943,5,B0070285YE,"This box is a gift lovers dream!  It is a hard embossed box that opens up into three parts.  It includes a hardbound book with a written history of the Titanic - full of photos.  A memorabilia packet that is very unique- blueprints of the boat, passport and crew info cards etc.  A beautiful CD of the music from the era and a historical DVD.  Seriously, for the Titanic historian this is the best gift available.",1330905600,50,413,4.381578947368421

5045951,4,B0070285YE,"As we all know about how sad this ship came to an end but Now 100 years after we still talk about it and that tell you something of how great this ship was even though the loss of Life.
They called it unsinkable and many question could it have been if it was built better or so on no one will trully know.
For this set i find it very good and I found in a store and I like the  History of Titanic and if you have not seen the movie then you must see it.
When the one game out wow it was made very well.
A ship that is at the way bottom of the sea and most still together but if it was all together would they raise it??
There is a movie Raise the Titanic but we all know that will not happen.
So for all those who like it get this and what comes with it is great.
DVD or no dvd it would still be great",1390262400,,801,3.603448275862069
5045952,5,B0070285YE,"Had to get this for my friend, a real Titanic buff.  I just know he'll love it, with the video being a 100 year special.  Not counting the other things inside.  Not sure what they are, but I'm sure he'll love them.",1371513600,,214,4.0476190476190474
5045953,5,B0070285YE,"This is great. Everything is great, from the book to the dvd to the memorabilia. It could be also be a very good gift for a Titanic-passionate!",1368576000,,143,4.333333333333333
5045954,5,B0070285YE,This was a gift for my titanic crazy daughter.  She loved it!!!  All of the extra things were a bonus.,1359417600,,102,4.05

5045957,3,B0070285YE,"I knew this was a Docummental but I think it should omit the music CD. Its really boring. Anyway, my nephew love it.",1351296000,,116,4.086956521739131
5045958,5,B0070285YE,"I highly recommend this product.  The case is durable and decorative.  The contents are well organized in the case.  The memorabilia packet is full of interesting information.  For example: index cards giving us a little information about a few of  the crew members, postcards of the Titanic, telegrams and letters about the tragic accident, a plan showing emergency exits, poems about the Titanic, a blueprint of crew space, and testimony of one of the survivors at one of the inquests.  The hardcover book has 129 pages. It tells the story of the ship being built, about the lives of some of the passengers and crew, about the disaster, and what happened after the accident.  The book is full of black and white photographs.  I felt the DVD about a man and his father's journey to the site where the Titanic sank was interesting. It shows us footage of the site where the Titanic lays. The DVD includes testimonies from the actual passengers about their journey across the Atlantic before the accident. Last but not least, there is a CD of 25 songs from that time period.  Many of the songs were played that tragic night on the ship.  The only thing I wish the DVD should have provided is Closed Captioning for the hearing impaired.",1342396800,,1234,4.6976744186046515
5045959,4,B0070285YE,"I love this beautiful set, but if you are buying it mainly for the DVD you WILL be disapointed. It's only around an hour long, and mainly focuses on a guy who won a chance to be part of a History Channel exploration to the wreck  moreso than it does on the ship itself. I have seen MUCH better and interesting productions. The box and the rest of the set is very nice, especially the memorobelia reproductions. Buy it and use the DVD as a coffee table stabilizer or frisbee.",1340323200,,474,4.266666666666667
5045960,4,B0070285YE,"I bought this for my nephew because he and I are both fascinated with all things Titanic. I thought it would be a great addition to all of the Discovery Channel specials that were showing during April for the 100 year anniversary. Everything in the set was intersting and fun to look over except for the dvd itself. For the most part, the dvd focuses on a man who was picked to go on one of the diving expeditions but very little time is spent showing the actual dive and the artifacts themselves. What little is shown, is at the very end of an hour long dvd and was disappointing to both of us. All in all, this boxed set is a good value especially at the Amazon price.",1337817600,4,670,4.2015503875969
5045961,5,B0070285YE,This collection is a MUST for avid Titanic fans. Much of the reproduced memorabilia are items that I have never before seen! And I own 3 other collections of Titanic memorabilia! So I was impressed with this collection. The hardcover book is also very nice and I enjoyed watching the DVD and wishing that I had been the one to win the contest!! And it is very attractively and uniquely boxed.,1335484800,2,392,4.535211267605634
5045962,3,B0070285YE,This box set is very nice and filled with great historical memorabilia for the Titanic enthusiast. I do wish that the DVD held a deeper history lesson into the ship other than focusing on Rob Goldsmith's journey to the site. If you're looking for a deep history lesson on DVD of the Titanic this is not what you want. Other than that the rest of the information in this set was well worth the money to me. This is the U.S. version that I have reviewed and to my understanding the U.K. version has the DVD with the in-depth history.,1335139200,,531,4.32

8507482,3,B0070285YE,"It's presented nicely, the book and music are nice, but the video is lacking. I've seen more Titanic wreck photos and video online, this video featured a person that won a trip to see the Titanic, it seemed to be more about him than the Titanic itself.",1500768000,,252,4.382978723404255

8507489,5,B0070285YE,"I purchased this particular set for the upcoming anniversary,but I had no idea the information would bring me closer to the actual crew and its passengers experience. The separate package that includes the short notes,telegraphs,etc..was a nice bonus the videos and book.
I would recommend this set to any enthusiast.  Thank you again for a great product that actually arrived a day early.",1424390400,,389,5.174603174603175
