8243419,5,B00120WGUE,"This video is awesome!  You can just look at the beautiful natural scenes and listen to the gentle music, or you can listen to the readings from the Tao Te Ching with the music and natural scenes.  I find it is a real help in creating a serene and relaxing mood before meditation.  The reader does a wonderful job reading the Tao Te Ching.  His voice is strong, calm, and soothing.  The images are beautiful!  It is a harmonious creation in keeping with the spirt of Lao Tzu.",1348099200,2,475,4.340909090909091
8243420,5,B00120WGUE,"I have every one of the Mindflow videos and this is my favorite.  How could you possibly go wrong with the words from the wisest book ever written.  Add to that an incredible speaking voice to do the narration and marry that to unbelievable scenery and cinematography.

You need to buy this one!
