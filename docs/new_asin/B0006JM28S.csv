8041861,3,B0006JM28S,"The quality of narration content could use improvement, and the camera work at times has a somewhat tourist quality feel to it. 'Dharma River', one of the Yatra Trilogy titles, has some pleasant aspects, but overall I was somewhat disappointed with it. Another title in the trilogy, 'Prajna Earth', was more successful than ''Dharma River' in its production and presentation.",1378684800,,375,5.266666666666667
8041862,5,B0006JM28S,"This film takes the viewer on a voyage of discovery to some of the most extraordinary places in the world. Going down golden rivers, into buddha caves, lost civilizations, abandoned plains of 7000 temples - the viewer is transported into another world of peace,beauty and timelessness. We see the people and their sacred customs in places that are hard to believe are going on at the same time as our own lives.

I cannot recommend this enough - it has narration and non narration ambient versions on same DVD. I have watched it 6 times. It is always a different experience.",1135036800,9,574,4.683168316831683
8041863,5,B0006JM28S,"Dharma River is a film of absolutely stunning beauty that takes the viewer on a  personal journey to some of the holiest places in Laos, Thailand and Burma.  The director/cinematographer uses a filming process that makes one feel like he or she is there in person.  Exotic vistas and ancient shrines contribute to a unique cinematic experience.  Colors are incredible;  the music is a perfect complement to the film.  Dharma River is a treat for the senses and the soul!",1101686400,10,470,4.8125
