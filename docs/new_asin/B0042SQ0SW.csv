8589502,5,B0042SQ0SW,"This series was recommended to my by a friend visiting from the U.K. Presently, it's not available in the standard NTSC format in the USA, therefore an all-region DVD player is necessary watch the show. This is comedy at it's best, well written, directed and extremely well-played by the cast. Ronnie Barker was one of the greatest performers and is backed up by a super cast. Subtle, wry prison humor and an outstanding performace by the cast make this series one of the best. I've already seen it twice and am on the third round, and it's never tiring or boring.",1344902400,,564,4.594059405940594
