The first three seasons are about three young women Prue Halliwell(Shannen Doherty), Piper Halliwell(Holly Marie Combs) and Phoebe Halliwell(Alyssa Milano) reunite after the death of their grandmother. Prue and Piper live together in their deceased grandmas house, While Phoebe lives in New York. phoebe moves back in with prue and piper. Prue is upset by this because she dislikes Phoebe for over past grudges. Prue divorce her husband while Piper discovers that her boyfriend wants to kill her and her sisters so he can acquire their witch powers. Phoebe expolores the house finds the attic and its locked. the door opens by it self allowing phoebe to go in. Phoebe finds a lot of stuff including a chest containing a book. Titled The Book Of Shadows. The book has an incantion and Phoebe reads it. The spell makes The three sisters witches and she tells piper and prue who don't believe her at all. later on phoebe discovers that she can get premonitions which she uses to save a boy who almost get hits by a car in return phoebe ends up in the hospital. Piper finds that she has the power to freeze and she accidently freezes her boss before he tastes a dish that she made and she adds a sauce that she forgot to put on the dish. Prue finds out about the power of Telekinesis with the help of Phoebe. Throughout season one the three battle demons who disrupts their life. at the end prues ex and childhood friend andy tredau dies and prue becomes depressed which is seen throughout the begginning episodes in season 2. in season 2 Prue overcomes her depression when a demon almost erases all the good that they done. The trio continues doing more good in return Prue acquires a new power known as Astral Projection. Phoebe and Piper get a little bit jealous then towards the end of season 2 Phoebe meets a guy she falls in love with who is a demon known as Balthzar. In season three Phoebe gets the power of levitation. prue gets turned into a dog in the third episode to the last of the season. Then piper gets the power to blow up things while fighting with her boyfriend who is an angel and pretended to be her handyman Leo Wyatt(Brian Krause). Then the last episode of season three is a major tear jerker!!! The last episode starts off with the sister saving s doctor or running from a demon who is the source of all evil's henchman Shax. Shax send Prue and Piper away from the doctor who he goes to kill, instead he sends Prue through a wall and Piper follows prue and she gets sent throgh another wall. Phoebe attacks with a spell which injures shax and he leaves. Phoebe sees her sister bleeding bad. She calls Leo and he comes and luckily heals them. To make a long story short and make a spoiler alert, all lot of chaos happens and leaves the power of three destroyed. season 4 kicks in with a new girl in town who turns out to be Prue, Piper and Phoebe's half sister. Her name is Paige Matthews(Rose Mcgowan. Struggles and hardships are well seen in the season and Paige gradually gets accepted into the Halliwell family after some time of anger at the Father of Prue, Piper and Phoebe Victor for not telling them that they had another sister. Charmed is an excellent show astarts and anybody who starts watching it, I recomend that you start with season 1 to get the full experience. There are eight seasons total jampacked full of comedy, drama and kick ass action",1298851200,,3444,4.494417862838915
8200836,5,B000CCBCGW,"Charmed is a great supernatural series about 3 sisters who discover they're witches and have to protect the innocents every week from the darkest of evils as the Charmed Ones. During the course of it's 8 year run, Charmed had lots of ups and downs, most of them behind the scenes!! But whatever the case, Charmed was at it's strongest the first half of the series with the writing being well-plotted, the acting top notch, the action well-choregraphed, and the sisterly bonding always consistant!! Not to take anything from the second half of the series (Season 5-8), but the show just dropped the ball as the show took a bizarre turn with the story telling and it's overall theme. But with Season 1-4, Charmed's storylines were surreal and viewers could idenitify with the show eveen with it's supernatural twist.

Season 1(1998-1999)-We are introduced to the terrific trio, Prue, Piper, and Phoebe Haliwell!!! 3 ordinary, everyday sisters who each take their lives in a different lite. Prue is the oldest, the born leader, always looking out for her 2 young sisters. She may be bossy, even sometimes bitchy, but she always means well in the depths of her heart. Piper, the middle has the toughest role, always keepng both her sisters from killing each other, she loves cooking, she's sweet, but can be sarcastic and funny!! Phoebe, the youngest, which automatically means she gets the most fun out of the sisters. She's care-free, light-hearted, and sassy if not a bit of a trouble maker!! When Phoebe moves back in with her sisters, the sisters' destiny begins as they become the Charmed Ones, the most powerful witches ever!! Now, Prue has telekinesis, Piper can freeze time, and Phoebe has premontions of the future!! With the help of Inspector Andy Trudo and Darryl Morris, the sisters battle for the first time a variety of warlocks and demons.

Phoebe goes back to college, while dealing with her past life literally!! This season is more light-hearted than the first, but the drama remains as their are few episodes that tests the bonds of the sisters.

An overwhelming season where Charmed hit its pick and which ultimately was the last great season of the series. 10/10!!

While Season 5-8 had their share of good to great episodes, the seasons as a whole felt flat, and the show lost it's dynamic with the sisterly bonding. The show was had basically jumped ship, mostly thanks to producer's Brad Kern taking charge of the show. Damn those fairytale creatures!! These are the only seasons you really need, and what Charmed is all about.",1178841600,,7463,4.86682427107959
