8600980,4,B00005QW85,"This is a VHS tape released by Goodtimes Entertainment in 1993. The name Goodtimes may ring a bell as the company that made all of those Disney knockoffs, but that's NOT what these are - these are 1950s cartoon classics! The contents are:
-'A Visit From St. Nicholas,' a combination of live-action and animation from the 1950s.
-'Madeline's Christmas' from the book series, a very rare film that's good for young children.
-'Christmas Fantasy,' a Canadian animation from the 1950s.
-'Fresh Hare,' a Bugs Bunny cartoon that has nothing to do with Christmas, but does take place in the winter.

Overall, it's a good collection of classic cartoons that will appeal to both kids and collectors. I enjoyed it!",1386460800,,704,4.915966386554622
