7870913,4,6304401884,"Pierce Brosnan is a maestro at orchestrating the women in his life.  JoBeth Williams and Virginia Madsen are master mistresses in their coy attempt to capture his love.  This is not a sweet little drama. It is packed with suspense, did he or didn't he?  You'll want the lights on to watch this one!",1398816000,,298,4.481481481481482
7870914,5,6304401884,"Arrived within reasonable time - whole (not broken) - worked and was pleasant.
I do not know what else I can say about a DVD I ordered because I wanted THAT DVD ???
I find it exaggerated to ask for such a long text.",1394841600,,215,3.909090909090909
7870915,5,6304401884,"Wow, what a movie.  Pierce loves acting in physiological thrillers.  This movie had so many twist and turn it kept my attention.  I could not believe the ending of the movie.  I thought he was a nice guy and not the killer.  I guess you can say he is a real lady killer.",1368144000,,270,4.018867924528302
7870916,4,6304401884,I loved this movie from start to finish. It was real good. I just love Pierce Brosan.,1282521600,,85,4.0588235294117645
7870917,3,6304401884,"The cheesy late 80's-early 90's saxophone aside, it's pretty good, for something of this genre. THe first love screen between the two main characters is red-hot, as are the rest of them. There's a lot of twists and turns that leave you wondering if Paul (Brosnan's character) is bad or good, but ultimately, you realize it's Pierce Brosnan, who cares, I just want him. :)

Solid work from everyone and a decent way to waste a weekend or weekday afternoon.",1111449600,7,455,4.6875
7870918,4,6304401884,"I was not expecting a good movie, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I highly recommend this movie.  Pierce Bronson is sexy and so is Jo Beth Williams.  A real thriller-under-rated.",995328000,10,179,4.9
7870919,5,6304401884,"For a TV movie(not cable)this is one of the sexiest shows I've ever seen. Pierce is a handsome rogue and JoBeth is one of my favorites. This thriller never lets up till the final moments of the film. A shocker. Just as you think you've clenched it, bingo here you go again. Would recomend it, simply for the fun of watching Brosnan and Williams steam up the screen. The dance scene was pretty well worth it too as was the visit to the local museum! Buy it and enjoy.",977184000,18,466,4.247191011235955
7870920,1,6304401884,"This wanna-be Hitchcockian thriller shamelessly rips off scenes from  Vertigo, Psycho, and North by Northwest, with the music of Richard Stone  imitation Bernard Herrmann via Pino Donaggio. Psychologist Jobeth Williams  is dating Pierce Brosnan, the same man who it turns out is also dating her  patient, Virginia Madsen. Or is he? The time it takes Jobeth to realise  such a faux pas makes her seem rather dim, though she appears to be  preoccupied in showing how she thinks she can do sexy. It is unfortunate  that her (many!) love scenes with Pierce play so awkwardly, though having  Pierce recite Edgar Allan Poe badly doesn't help. Madsen probably comes off  best. She manages to invest emotion and truth in what is a cliche role of  the woman scorned. Jobeth has some tiny moments, particularly with her  friend played by the baritone-voiced Georgia Brown. Director Jerry London  gives us a juggling clown to represent Jobeth's confusion, and rain to  accompany Billie Holiday singing Stormy Weather.",968803200,,1006,5.098159509202454
