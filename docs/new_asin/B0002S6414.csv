8031031,1,B0002S6414,"All I wanted was a nice Christmas show to enjoy with the family, to add to the too-often-watched standard fare -- Charlie Brown, Grinch, etc.  It only took a few minutes of watching each story to find out that I wasted $11 on this junk production.  Dopey stories, cloying voices, cheap visual production -- it looks like an art school project from the early days of computer animation.  Nothing ""classical"" here.",1356652800,,412,4.774647887323944
