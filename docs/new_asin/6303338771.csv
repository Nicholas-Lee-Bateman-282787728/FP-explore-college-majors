7845230,4,6303338771,"For a Westerner, this film required some adjustment on my part. The structure is loose, almost improvisational in its feel (I won't, at the risk of sounding like some ivory tower white person, say 'like jazz'), but the structure is there. It's just not what we're used to with our cultural traditions. But it's always a good thing to at least occasionally step outside of one's comfort zone, open your mind, see the world through someone else's eyes. This film does that.

Running like a chorus throughout the film, is varied footage of women (and some men) engaging in what I assume are traditional dances and singing, with musical accompaniment (mainly drums), and expressing through their song and dance various universal emotional states, aspects of their lives and so forth. These segments are naturally very engaging, both emotionally and rhythmically, as they have a somewhat rough, almost newsreel-like quality, giving them an immediacy and sense of genuineness.

The other two 'stories' (and this term is loosely used here, at least from a Westerner's perspective and level of expectation) concern on the one hand a village woman's covert relationship with a man living outside her tribe's traditions, and on the other the frustrations of a woman who lives in the city and her difficulties finding a good man.

I will agree that the latter storyline is less interesting, but that's largely due to the fact that the village woman's narrative is highlighted by an extended sequence of lovemaking that would have almost certainly earned this film an NC-17 rating had it been submitted to the MPAA. It's quite well done, truly erotic, but yes, also pretty graphic. Be warned: this is not a film to show to a classroom of high schoolers.",1369872000,,1741,4.975945017182131
