8044082,5,B0006ZJAXW,"The description for this product (at the time of writing) is not clear what it is. This is actually a documentary style tour of the Studio Ghibli museum. It goes through all 4 floors showing exhibits and discussing the ideas behind the architecture and design.

For a fan of the studio and Hayao Miyazaki this is a really nice disc to see, especially if you never plan to visit Japan and see the museum in person.

Though you may have seen glimpses of some of these exhibits in extras on some of the movies, none of the extras goes into anywhere near this much depth or detail.

The version I recieved was region 0 (worldwide) so I'm not sure why Amazon has it listed as region 2.

I've seen these marked up for $50 because I believe it is out of print, it was released shortly after the museum opened and as far as I know hasn't been put out again. If you can get it under $30 and your a fan, do it.",1303516800,21,900,4.155172413793103
