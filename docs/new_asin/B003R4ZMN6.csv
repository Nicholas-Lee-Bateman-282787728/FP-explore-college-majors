4177323,1,B003R4ZMN6,"It's a sad reflection of today's society that trash like this is successful.

There's nothing but obscenties thrown around by barely-literate apes and trailer trash girls.

These guys and gals (if you want to call them that) were simply in the right place at the right time and found stardom via this putrid vehicle.

The girls (and most of the guys, save for Vinnie and Pauly D) don't even have good looking faces! Just surgically and chemically enhanced bodies.

I feel bad for the next generation, being weaned on this nonsense.",1301529600,13,531,4.802197802197802
4177324,5,B003R4ZMN6,I recieved product in a very timely manner and was quite impressed with how fast it was recieved.  The DVD was in perfect condition and I would definitely purchase from Seller again.,1300147200,,182,4.6875
4177325,4,B003R4ZMN6,I enjoyed the season. Pretty similar dvd set-up as season one. I would have prefered a few more extended scenes or extra footage.,1298246400,,129,4.6521739130434785
4177326,5,B003R4ZMN6,I can't get enough of this reality show! My Thursday nights are not complete without them! I purchased the first season also. I enjoy watching the series when there is nothing else on TV.,1297296000,2,187,4.529411764705882

4177328,5,B003R4ZMN6,"Jersey Shore is probably the most entertaining show on television [definitely on MTV] even though it does not accurately represent Jersey in the least. I'm from the coast and what they portray are the typical 'benny's' that we have to deal with year after year.  But, still, I'm a fan and the DVDs are great to have. haha it's a good distraction from schoolwork :)",1297036800,2,364,4.6

4177331,5,B003R4ZMN6,"This set is great for us shore fans! It is uncensored so no beeping when they talk. You get the full experience when the arguing between Ron and Sam is going on, or Sam and JWOWW fight. They still blur nudity which is fine because it's usually Snokki's vag being shown. Overall it's worth it",1294704000,9,291,4.3090909090909095
4177332,1,B003R4ZMN6,"i know im in the minority here. you can all make fun of me. but the show is just about eye candy for both men and woman. i think everyone of us, at least those with any kind of life at all, has gone through or still going through everything they are doing.  i just don't think most of us are really that stupid and have the IQ of our shoe size. nobody can be that stupid. nobody.......and although the woman love the guys, and the men love the woman, although i can honestly say, the girls aren't that good looking. maybe one or two at best.  i see so many girls at the shore that are better looking, not to mention at college. you can go to any college, even a community college where i started at, and get better girls then them. although black hair is exotic so they got that right. the guys walk around like they want a fight nightly. let them go to my local gym down the road here in north brunswick and see if they feel that way after hitting the pads with those guys. nope don't think so.  i just think to follow around people who are barely out of their teens act like idiots really is not entertainment.  if they did pranks, or pushed the envelope more maybe it might be worth watching. but if you are looking for eye candy don't you think you can find it elswhere and much much better?  i can just on my way to work!  but i guess teens and people who are not happy with their partner find happiness through others.  i just don't get it.  my daughter is 12 and i have to stop her from watching it. my god if that was my daughter i would shoot myself!!",1290124800,,1560,4.07516339869281

4177399,5,B003R4ZMN6,"Love the DVD set. The packaged was sealed, delivered on time and everything is uncensored. Meaning all the swears and such are going to be heard. When you put the disc in, you get a dvd preview of Mean Girls. Then, you get the video contains some Bad, VERY Bad words and such, meaning the uncensored dvd version and also deleted extras from the intros and such as well. Well worth your money if you want your own Jersey Shore Marathon. I would highly suggest you buy them by the season and NOT the set. The SINGLE Seasons are well worth it.

We have finally finished all the episodes.  I have watched a lot of reality shows in my day and I gotta say this one isn't bad.  There is definitely a lot of drinking, brawling, drama, and goofy antics.  You will have moments of rolling your eyes and then moments of wanting to hurry up and find out what's gonna happen next.  Give it a try.  It's good for a lazy day or when you are working on stuff and can't fully concentrate on the tv.  For the record...Pauly D and Vinnie are hilarious!!!  They should be the ones with a spin off (not JWoww and Snookie).",1389484800,,817,4.219354838709678

The girls are pretty large and seem out of shape. All the people do is go out and try to get as many guys and girls to sleep with them as they can.

These young adults barely hold a job, get drunk every night and change partner like I change clothes. This is ridiculous and shows our youth a wrong side of America instead of being responsible lets pay them millions to act like fools. Great idea....now throw in pregnancy before marriage and in their teens, oh wait there is a show for that too called Teen Moms. What is our society coming to when we show our children that it is okay to do this by making TV shows about it.",1347062400,2,570,4.238532110091743
4177715,1,B003R4ZMN6,this is the worst tv show on tv i no longer liked mtv when they started putting reality shows in their line up but i no longer watch mtv due to it showing unintelligent reality shows like this borefest known as the jersey shore i do like beavis and butthead and other stuff but i hate reality shows they long stupid and boring and unintelligent buy something else better instead of this dvd that truly is a waste of time and money,1339632000,,430,4.2560975609756095

4177717,5,B003R4ZMN6,"They ""uncensored"" alot of it I don't why people act like it's not uncensored... At all. Which it is because other-wise it wouldn't say ""uncensored"" for no reason. And they have to censor some of the words because they can be really dirty and crude. And if that was me I'd censor some of it too. But one question, how come when I bought this DVD it didn't have the ""Cast Interviews"". Hmm.....? And says in special features ""Cast Interviews"". Well I don't care as long as I have uncensored ""Season Two"" episodes. Thatz all I care about.",1328227200,,534,4.459183673469388

4177733,5,B003R4ZMN6,"i been watchin jersey shore. i think its majorly entertaining makes me laugh alot as well. i don't live the lifestyle they do though im more of a good girl but then its nice to  see realityand how everybody does different things. diff values.  i think  they definately have lives, family, dating school work but its summer so why not let them have fun. they aint hurting you so why should make you so angry am i  tisright. its so great to get the inside scoop on the jersey shore. and watch when u want to and complete season i love it its fun total guilty pleasure i think everybody on the show has a pretty good chemistry with each other. the mix gets stirred and its fun to watch what can i say. america has fallin luv with these guys and they re making  a whole lot. i think they shouild keep it going til the fire fuses out

the price of this dvd is underrated towards the rewards. a $20 buck well spent. i spent my weekend watching and i have now watched the whole season. theres so much fire in these characters

ronnie - a great jerk and ass hole towards sammie. she deserves much better. shes a real pretty girl i don't know what she sees in ronnie!!!

situation - im not liking him to much after watching this he starts a lot of trouble and conflicts in the house i don't like his character that much

pauly d- the end made me realize that guys like vinny and pauly just want a true girlfriend that they respect and take out to nice dinners and gets flowers for. not the grenades they bring home and smush. pauly pointed out he didn't watch smash rosio his girl he wanted to 'get to know her' instead. i thought that was sweet shes a very lucky girl rosio
see girls

jenni - mad cool realy great personality and i really like her i think her personality nice and fair

angelina - i think she makes herself become what she was in the show. she wasn't open to her roommates or try to become friends. she talks on the phone 24/7 she doesnt help clean and contribute to the house. she puts herself out. at a few moments there are times angelina seems like a cool ass person but then she blows it

snookie - cute and makes funny noises i thought it was real funny she pulled on jwoww foot when she in bed with her boyfriend. snookie can be such a cutie. shes stylish, smart, sticks up for herself, good with doing hair and wearing the right clothing. shes very savvy indeed

ronnie - a complete jerk i hate him

vinny- mad chill and cool personality very likeable",1308873600,,2468,4.223404255319149

4177738,3,B003R4ZMN6,"None of these guys or girls would be described as geniuses, but the editors of this show might be.  Jersey Shore is MTV's biggest hit, and it's status is not entirely undeserved. Much like the Real World, the show groups together young 20-somethings to live together in an idyllic life pretty much filled with clubbing and rarely a BS job (I can tell you for a fact you won't be able to afford a place like that in Miami as a grunt selling ice cream).

Snooki is the show's beloved breakout character, ditzy well beyond a valley girl, but also kind of the heart of the franchise. Naturally a charmer who doesn't pick physical fights, she is socially savvy and finds herself in quite a few scuffles. Sammy and Ron can pretty much be seen as the definition of an Abusive relationship. Ron cheats, verbally abuses, and lies to Sammy with abandon, Sammy the codependent responds with adoration and loyalty. Mike ""The Situation"" has no brain, but is good with the ladies and thinks he's cool. Vinny's the ""nice guy,"" kind of an apprentice of the other two boys, but still clinging on to a semblance of morality. Pauly D is the oldest of the crew, but ironically the loudest. Jwoww might be alpha female, tough as nails, kind of the hard side of Snooki's softness. Angelina is the omega, outcast, but vicious in her desperation.

This isn't intellectual stuff by any trace of the imagination. But it is well put-together and edited. Often, the show plays tricks with what has happened and what is happened. As one roommate lies to another, the show quickly flashes back to prior events to display the outrageous bending of truth taking place. While it's not moral, it is an active lifestyle, and the editing briskly moves through the highlights (perhaps lowlights) of the lives of these young people. To the savvy viewer, one can take small lessons. How for example, the abusive Ron and Sammy pair team up on those who intervene on an abusive dual psychosis. How, despite being brainless, the crew is reproductively successful for other reasons. A lot of the fights, pathologically driven, are hilarious, as are the cast's not-too-bright observations on life and lingo. Try it out... much akin to Beavis and Butthead before it, the kids involved are dumb, but the show itself might just be saying something about youth today.",1303603200,7,2319,4.749379652605459
