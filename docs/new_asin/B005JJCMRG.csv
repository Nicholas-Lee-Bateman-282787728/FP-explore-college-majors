4712787,4,B005JJCMRG,"Here is a great case of a film being made and released at the wrong time.  Director Jerry Thorpe's 'THE VENETIAN AFFAIR'-1967 is a masterful tale of intrigue and double crosses but unfortunately had two things against it: 1) It's leading man ,Robert Vaughn, was acting in one of television's popular shows at the time 'THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E.'-1964-1968 causing audiences used to the humorous air of the show to be thrown for a loop at the seriousness and lack of action sequences contained within its 92 minute running time; 2) there was an onslaught of spy/secret agent films flooding the theaters from Europe to the US following the James Bond phenomena so with the films credits, people were expecting a TV movie being released theatrically as some of the two part U.N.C.L.E. episodes were packaged for US and over seas at that time.  The film flopped at its release and seemed forgotten if not for sporadic showings on Turner Classic Movies.  Warner Archive has given it a well deserved resurrection preserving it as an underrated espionage thriller with some great performances.  Vaughn plays an ex-CIA agent turned journalist assigned to investigate a possible terrorist bombing at a peace conference in Venice.  Vaughn approaches the role of Bill Fenner in a cool mea-culpa tone with traces of his U.N.C.L.E. character Solo creeping in once in a while. He would continue his movie roles with Director Peter Yate's classic 'BULLITT'-1968 as the corrupt cop Chalmers; Edward Asner ,before his future successful television career ,is excellent as Vaughn's ex boss stopping at nothing to get to the bottom of the affair.  The lovely Elke Sommer plays Vaughn's ex wife who double crossed him in the past and would go on to grace Director Ralph Nelson's underrated spy film 'DEADLIER THAN THE MALE' the same year ; Cameos by T.V. actor Roger C. Carmel (known as Harry Mudd on two 'STAR TREK' episodes at that time), the venerable Boris Karloff as ,what else, a nobel scientist, and the beautiful Luciana Paluzzi who played the lethal Fiona Volpe in Director Terrance Young's Bond classic 'THUNDERBALL'-1965 as Carmel's secretary.  The scene stealer is Euro actor Karl Boehm as Wall, an enemy agent who wants Karloff's plans for his own. Boehm, known for his performance in Director Michael Powell's unfairly maligned and ahead of its time serial killer thriller 'PEEPING TOM'-1960,gives his role an incredible air of evil. Director Jerry Thorpe, son of Director Richard Thorpe, known for his massive T.V. movie and series works, seems to have helmed only two theatrical features in his career, this one and 'DAY OF THE EVIL GUN'-1968.  He keeps the film moving in a slow, powder keg tone throughout which enhances the elements of the script.  With a catchy lounge music score from T.V. composer Lalo Schifrin (one of his best), beautiful photography from two time Oscar winner Milton Krasner showing off the breath taking Venetian locales and a good screenplay by Producer E.Jack Newman based on Helen MacInnes's  novel,  'THE VENETIAN AFFAIR' can finally be appreciated by modern day audiences.  It has flaws but it has a timelessness about it hauntingly reminiscent of our modern day terrorist happenings.  Warner releases it in a beautiful 2.35 widescreen transfer with a US trailer its only extra.",1376611200,6,3303,5.027472527472527
4712788,2,B005JJCMRG,"The Venetian Affair has a very boring plot which took much too long to materialize. The DVD is an on on demand order and the

I had expected to see more of Elke Sommer but it was interesting to see her in a dramatic role.  Although she was good, she is much better in comedy roles.",1355702400,2,297,4.086206896551724
4712792,5,B005JJCMRG,"A good spy thriller, acting is good, but the on location scenery is what helps make this movie worth adding to your collection.

4712793,4,B005JJCMRG,"The Film:

I'm a long time Robert Vaughn fan, and indeed a fan of spy films - everything from the Bond adventures, to the silly Italian spoofs and all in between. The Venetian Affair is mostly a serious, detective-like story, deliberately downbeat a la John Le Carre's work. This is most certainly not a Man From UNCLE film, so don't be confused by the similar sounding title. There are no gadgets, no outlandish scenes, and so on. It's all very much grounded in the real world, albeit one heavily stylized due to the demands of drama. Vaughn is superb, as are the supporting cast, and I think the writing and direction is also wonderful. I read the Helen MacInnes novel and was surprised at what a departure the filmmakers took from the source material. It looks quite beautiful - fantastic use of widescreen, very evocative of the era and the moody genre - and the music is also excellent thanks to another fine score by Lalo Schifrin. I'm not claiming the film is perfect - it does have its flaws - but I do stand by my opinion that it's an intelligent, artful (and unfortunately, rare) Hollywood-made ""existential"" spy film from the 60s. A decade later, post Watergate, this kind of depiction of political intrigue, intelligence services and the like were quite common. But for the mid 60s, at the height of Bond-mania, Derek Flint and Matt Helm - not to mention Vaughn's own UNCLE series - The Venetian Affair is a anomaly. I love it.

The Disc:

Well, you're buying just the movie, aren't you? Sadly, since The Venetian Affair isn't a movie in demand, Warner Bros sees no need to mass produce this for the market so it's an on-demand product. This means you're simply getting the film, which is transferred as well as any movie of its era onto DVD so now complaints there, as well as the trailer. There are no special features to speak of apart from the trailer. I suppose at $27 this is quite pricey for a basic DVD, but then again, only serious fans are going to want this so the price is at the upper limit of being acceptable. I'm glad studios like Warner Bros offer this Archive Collection series where movie buffs can buy obscure, hard-to-get movies such as these. This movie isn't available on Netflix or Hulu either. As far as I'm aware, The Venetian Affair has never been available on DVD prior to this release, at least not in the US. So all-in-all, despite paying $27, it's well worth it for me.

EDIT: I want to add that despite what it says here on Amazon, the aspect ratio is proper widescreen (2.35:1) and not the chopped up 1.77:1 that is listed on this page. Also, it seems the price has lowered since I first made my comments, which only makes this DVD all the more a must-buy for 60s spy movie fans.",1319760000,38,2724,4.508097165991903
4712794,4,B005JJCMRG,"Warner Archive has released MGM's ""The Venetian Affair"" (1966) as a solo outing for ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E.'s"" Robert Vaughn.  David McCallum had a few starring roles of his own (""Three Bites of the Apple"" and ""Sol Madrid"") but as yet they remain unavailable.  Warner Archive has also released an 8 movie collection of those ""Man from U.N.C.L.E."" features MGM put together of episodes of the series that were mainly marketed overseas and a two part collection of ""The Girl from U.N.C.L.E"" series.  I suppose it's a cause to celebrate.  Although ""The Venetian Affair"" is based on best-selling author Helen MacInnes book, and scripted by E. Jack Neuman and directed by Jerry Thorpe, it is an adult spy thriller, and it has plenty of pretty girls, but Vaughn is a bit of a grizzled anti-hero on the sauce.  The girls include Elke Sommer, Felicia Farr and Luciana Paluzzi and the supporting cast also includes Boris Karloff, Roger C. Carmel, Karl Boehm and Ed Asner.  The photography especially of the Venice scenery is very good by Milton Krasner and the music is nice but typical for Lalo Schifrin (""Mission: Impossible"").  It's good to see this available, the remastering job excellent.  The complex plot kept my attention from start to finish and it's all there to appreciate now or again, whichever the case may be.  Where would we be without Warner Archive?",1318464000,19,1360,4.878260869565217

8475770,4,B005JJCMRG,"One of the better cold war spy stories.  Keep in mind that this was 1966, and audiences were being spoon-fed James Bond and all the action spy spoofs of that era, and this was a pleasant departure from that.  This movie is what I'd call a step down from something like The Spy Who Came In From the Cold, which is really hard to beat as far as cold war classics. The only thing that bothered me with the plot was Fenner's (Vaughn's) ex-wife.  Her character was a bit contrived, but again, in the 1960s people expected to see guns and women in their spy films.  Ed Asner was great, and Vaughn was even better than his tongue-in-cheek Napolean Solo, playing a tired, disillusioned and world-weary guy who was burnt out before his time.  Definitely recommend.",1483228800,,755,4.522058823529412

8475776,5,B005JJCMRG,"Very good political spy thriller.  Filmed partly on location in Venice, Italy the motion picture moves along well and sustains interest throughout.
Robert Vaughn is quite effective as a disillusioned government agent now working with the media.  Recalled back into government service because his former wife (Elke Sommer) is supposedly involved in espionage and anti-American activities, the former nightmare becomes a reality all over
again.  Good support from Boris Karloff in his final screen role as an aging scientist, Karl Boehm as a ruthless Cold West double-dealing agent and
Felicia Farr (Mrs. Jack Lemmon) as an American secretary/confidant are well-cast and highly effective in all their performances.  Most impressive of
all however, is the late Edward Asner (Lou Grant) as a cold, insensitive leader of an American spy group in Europe.  Asner has a very large part and
his scenes are about the best thing in the entire film!  Good film throughout thatnever ""lags"" in any sense whatsoever.  Intelligent and very well-
acted by a superior group of performers.  One thing -- don't look for a happy ending.",1437868800,2,1115,5.224719101123595
