632716,5,6303355005,"This movie was really cute. It's about a boy, Frank, who goes into the city with his friends to look for a hooker. They find V, a hooker that ends up having a soft side to her. She soon finds herself stuck in the suburbs,  where Frank and his dad live... and falling in love. It's a cute and funny  comedy/drama... And it's worth your time and your money.",954374400,7,355,4.130434782608695
632717,3,6303355005,Cut & sweet story ; no more no less. Griffith & Harris are perfect together & their play is worth the watch. Something to watch if you don't want to make the effort to think & just want to have a relaxing  & pleasant evening.,953683200,3,225,4.0
632718,1,6303355005,"I agree with the reviewer who said ""avoid at all costs"". Melanie Griffith's limited acting skills aside, the script is pathetic. This type of film about the 'hooker with the heart of gold' has already been done (and better) in ""Pretty Woman"". If the boys in the story had been a bit older, this might have worked as a teen-sex comedy (a la ""Risky Business""), but the result is just plain dumb! The scene in the classroom where Frank (the main kid)gives a sex education presentation using Griffith as a visual aid was downright offensive - did he think he'd get an 'A' on that? Frank is supposed to be the hero of the movie; do 'good' kids (how old is he, 11 or 12?) go propositioning strange women on the streets of Pittsburgh with money they've obtained through selling porn magazines? Meanwhile, the scenes of his best friend's father seeking out Griffith for a tryst were not funny at all and just added yet more sleaze to this already repugnant flick. To sum it up in one word: Pass!",952905600,6,987,4.488888888888889

It took a long time, but I found a UK copy (it's deleted from all catalogues here) and have enjoyed it again. I have read several reviews stating it is rubbish, what about AIDS, etc., and  these have really annoyed me. It is not a piece of social documentary or  commentary, it is escapism pure and simple, and on that basis it works  well: it is a jolly good view. I would really recommend it!",945475200,5,497,4.051020408163265

I have to admit though that streaming even with a 1Mbps connection has come a long way in the last couple of years.  Not to make unscientific comparisons but Netflix streaming seems to be better than Hulu and Amazon.,1392163200,,361,4.790322580645161
633184,5,6303355005,"I love this film from beginning to end and never gets old. The humor is great, and Melanie Griffith gives what I think is the most charming role in her career in my opinion. I think she is a great actress overall and the prettiest and most enlightening. The story revolves around Frankie Wheeler who goes to the city with his buddies to see thier first naked woman. A phase that most boys of that age go through in life at some times. The thing I liked about this movie the most was the way she gave a mother figure role to Frankie since his real mother passed away while giving birth to Frankie. The most emotional part was when V gives Frankie the motherly embrace and he starts feeling sad and asks her what's it like to have a Mom. That part chokes me up every time I see this movie. The whole feeling that V gets across in this film makes it a feel good movie. The other thing I like about this movie that it was filmed in Lebanon, OH. which is only an hour or so from where I live and is a very charming historic town with the oldest historic Inn of Ohio called The Golden Lamb that is well worth visiting and the Village Ice Cream parlor across the street from Golden Lamb. Both charming to visit when in that area of Ohio. Milk Money is going to be a timeless classic for generations to come. Check it out. You won't be dissapointed. Ed Harris, Melanie Griffith,Michael Patrick Carter and Malcolm McDowall are all great actors and are a perfect chemistry for this film.",1391817600,,1477,4.2785714285714285

633191,2,6303355005,"This `Pretty Woman'-lite flick that no one has seen has a few nice moments but mostly winds up being a forgettable and lazy film revolving around a man who falls in love with a hooker.  The best part about the film is that he doesn't know she is one, and so their communication becomes unintentionally hilarious (since she believe he knows he's a hooker), but outside of that the film becomes rather pedestrian.  Ed Harris is rather loose here, which is a nice change of pace for him, and Melanie Griffith is notably sassy here, but the general plot feels really predictable and not very well thought out, and that takes away from the film a great deal.  The film follows Frank, a young boy who saves up money along with his friends to pay a hooker to show them her breasts.  That hooker happens to be V, who then proceeds to stay in Frank's tree-house while his father fixes her car.  His father thinks that she is a math tutor and eventually falls in love with her, only to uncover what she really does for a living.

633404,4,6303355005,"""Milk Money"" is a movie with a perverse sounding plot, that is actually a charming (if not cliched and predictable) movie with Melanie Griffith in one of her best performances. In this film, Griffith steals the show. Milk Money has an interesting idea, but it is carried out in a way we've seen thousands of times before. Griffith's character is a character that's been played thousands of times before, but this film still works. Three preadolescent kids named Frank, Kevin, and Brad all long for one thing...To see a woman naked. All three of them are clueless about sex and women in general and the script portrays these kids exactly how they would be in real life. It doesn't exaggerate their curiosity, it hits it right on. Anyway, they figure in order to see a woman naked that they must have some money and go into ""the city.""

So, they begin collecting milk money. When they have it, they ride into the city to find a woman who will take off her clothes for money. For a while, they're unsuccesful; But after a near-run in with a thug, they meet V (Griffith)

who gives the boys what they want. I know this sounds perverse, but it's done pretty tastefully. Anyway, the boys get stranded so V gives them a ride home but gets stranded herself when her car breaks down. It occurs to one of the boys, Frank, around this time that maybe V can marry his single dad Tom (Oscar nominee Ed Harris). Why not? Of course, V and Tom fall for each other quickly (although Tom is under the impression that V is a math tutor); But V's pimp has been ripping off people and has recently been killed and his killer Walter (Malcolm McDowell, with a wonderfully campy take on the character he's had to play over-and-over again since ""A Clockwork Orange"") is looking for V. Does true love prevail? Of course it does but that doesn't mean that, in between the beginning and the end, you can't be entertained. I love the characters in this film and I love the actors who play them. Yes, they're trapped in this carbon copy script but they make it work...Especially Griffith, who takes the hooker-with a heart-of-gold thing and makes it her own. Not for everybody, but it's smooth and senseless entertainment.

633405,4,6303355005,"Okay, so the simularities are there...man falls in love with hooker...okay so that may be it but you have to admitt that when you watch this movie the first thought that pops in your head is 'pretty woman' without Roberts star power.  If that's the point when you turn this off it's a shame for there is a little more to this film than 'man meets hooker man loves hooker'.  First off, the man doesn't know she's a hooker till half way through.  The man is Ed Harris and the hooker V is played by Melanie Griffith.  The story follows Frank, Harris's son, as he and his friends save up their money to pay a hooker to show them her breasts.  That hooker is V.  In a chain of events V ends up staying in Franks tree-house while his father fixes her car.  Frank, who has never known what it's like to have a mother beings that his mother died giving birth to him, is excited to have V around and is convinced she would be the perfect step-mother (although I find it strange that he wants his step-mother to be the woman he just saw naked).  The funny parts of this film consist of when they talk about V's line of work since V believes Ed Harris knows she's a hooker and he believes she's a Math Tutor.  The film is sweet and nice Hollywood fluff, nothing too meaty and nothing you'll be jow dropped and amazed over but it's cute and light and a decent film to boot so it won't bore you and may just be what you feel like watching one rainy afternoon.",1149552000,14,1446,4.191335740072202

Frank (Michael Patrick Carter) and his tow school buddies decide to make their dream come true, of seeing a real live nude woman. So they gather up all of their milk money and make their way into the seedy city center.
Melanie Griffith plays V, a beautiful warm-hearted prostitute in trouble. Being really short of money, she agrees to disrobe for them.
After she drives them back home, she has to crash out in Frank's tree house after her car breaks down. A romance ensues with Frank's father Tom (Ed Harris), who Frank leads to believe she is a Math tutor. Things get hairy when a ruthless gangster finds out where she is and comes after her. But all ends well, through sticky, funny and touching moments.
