755484,2,6304012764,"I got this DVD based on the fact it was a combination of a cheesy horror movie, cheesy porno, cheesy college movie, and cheesy metal movie all wrapped into one. However, it fell a bit short of my cheesiness expectations.
 First off, despite it has ""Demon,"" in the title, it is in no way a thriller or horror movie in any way. Maybe I was jumping to conclusions when reading reviews about it, but I was hoping to see some cheesy murder scenes.
 Secondly, throughout the entire movie, you only see like 2-3 girls naked, which is really dissapointing since the main premise of this film was to be an adult movie of some sort. What's worse is that the demon isn't very hot (she's like 30-40 years old), and one of the actresses has a stunt double in the scene she is naked! I mean, they couldn't find an actress willing to show both her face and body in the same B movie???
 I did like how terribly they potrayed a Greek system at a college. I don't know if they were that stupid, or if they just wanted to make this movie even cheesier. They didn't know how to draw an Upsilon or Sigma, and you can tell from a distance that they taped ""Sigma Upsilon Chi"" over an actually fraternity composite's name in the background. Also, the interrivally between jocks and nerds in the fraternity was hilarious (how that could ever happen in a real fraternity, I don't know). Finally, the party scene with the cheesy metal band was most excellent on my cheesiness scale.
 If you're looking for a cheesy movie to make fun of, there are plenty better ones out there than this one. But, if you're in a frat like me, and are still really intrigued, this can be a fairly entertaining movie to watch with your bros.",994204800,3,1694,4.385350318471337
755485,4,6304012764,"Well,well,well...what do we have here?  A demon temptress who comes to our world to choose a man who will be forced to have sex with her constantly for all eternity?  Where does the line start?  Apparently there's a problem  with this plan because the guys fight tooth and nail not to get lucky with  this special vixen.  But none of that matters because there is a ROCK band  in this.  A really cool rock band.  They play rock and roll.  I need to  know who this band is and where can I get a t-shirt.  One star was taken  away because they didn't show enough of the band.",947635200,5,573,4.194444444444445

7858637,4,6304012764,"It's a Troma production.  If that doesn't tell you that the movie is going to be so bad it's good, there's really nothing much I can say to support my 4-star rating.  I can, however, tell you to ignore the 1 & 2 star ratings if you like campy, silly, adult humor with acting and story lines so bad they'll make you laugh out loud.  This is what Troma is all about, and you get PLENTY of it in this movie along with the gratuitous nudity that also define a Troma film.  Think Animal House of the comedy horror genre.  Seriously?  People watched this and gave it bad ratings?  They couldn't have had a clue about Troma films before they watched this movie.",1491091200,2,654,4.2682926829268295
