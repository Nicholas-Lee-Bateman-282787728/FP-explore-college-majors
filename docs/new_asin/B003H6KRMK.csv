4123786,5,B003H6KRMK,"This show is so funny.  I recommend this to anyone who wants to laugh!  The humor is off the wall and makes me laugh every time I watch it.  So far I've watched the whole series a total of 3 times through since I got it.

I've been wanting to add this series to my collection for quite sometime but the hard copy dvd version was still pretty expensive.  I ended up getting the digital version which I use my Roku player and the Amazon channel on it to watch, and have it saved in my Amazon library.  The quality is good, little bit better than watching upscaled dvds I think and the size of the frame is 16:9.  The digital version was way cheaper than the dvds and I got the whole set (ep 1-26) for one low price.

Anyways I highly recommend this show to everyone!",1305763200,,764,4.114864864864865
4123787,4,B003H6KRMK,"Ratings are a guesstimate, usually on the ""safe side"".

Sub-genre: Comedy, Romance, Modern-world fantasy

Situations: Probably PG+ (Harem-ish, Limited ""Fan-service"")
Language: Probably PG
Nudity: PG
Violence: PG

  Language options: Dub, Sub with separate on/off option. The way it should be.
  The usual unforgivable offense: the ads that play on load can't be skipped or bypassed. (Like I need to see ads for stuff I own or will want to watch the same ads every time I watch this DVD for years to come...)
  Split into two half-seasons rather than put out a a complete series. This is irritating, it takes up more space on my already overcrowded Anime rack...

  Special Features: Clean open/close. Trailers(Previews) - Mostly vague nearly to the point of being useless toward getting me to look into the shows advertised. If you can't tell me what the show is about, don't waste my time.

  Part1: While well done in general, and I'll take nothing from the comedy and plot of the series which is quite good, this could have been better done. The writers for the English dub could have benefited from watching some old mobster movies for dialogue inspiration. Most of the voice acting could have benefited from better direction I think as well. (Exception: Fujishiro the Shark's voice was great in throwing the accents in the wrong places to make him sound less human).
  That aside I enjoyed the series, but I'd have to call it pretty average overall. Better voice acting or possibly voice direction could have made this a great show (dubbed version obviously).
  It's about a boy on vacation with his family who almost drowns, but is saved by a mermaid. This is against mermaid laws so he has to marry her or be executed. Her father, being the head of the local mermaid yakuza (mob) prefers the latter idea. The daughter preferring the former, decides to move in back home with the boy and his family. Various comedy-drama situations arise based on the law of not letting humans see mermaids, rival yakuza mermaid gangs, and rivals for the girl's hand in marriage, a childhood friend possibly in love with the boy (and a nosy one to boot) and of course, the father looking for a way to rid himself of his potential human son-in-law. Introduces a number of main characters as it progresses in good timing so they are easy to keep track of.
  I'm probably sorry I didn't watch this in Japanese with subtitles before I wrote this, it may have gotten a better review. Still it's a pretty good series, even in English as is.

  Part 2: Special Features: Clean open/close. Trailers(Previews) (These looked to be mostly the same ones so I didn't even bother to watch them).
  Concludes the series (and actually seems to conclude, not leave it open for another ""we hope"" season - yay!) with the boy earning the respect of the father and the family. How? Watch it and you'll know.",1298246400,,2875,4.745967741935484

4123789,4,B003H6KRMK,"""My Bride Is a Mermaid: Season One, Part Two"" finishes up the first (and only) season of this funny and oddball anime.  There are thirteen episodes on two DVDs, bringing to a close the complete twenty-six episode series.

I really dug this series, for its mix of over the top antics combined with some outright parody and some nice sweet moments.  If you have seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Season-One-Part-One/dp/B003H6KRMK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Season One, Part One</a>&nbsp;(and why would you be watching Part Two without having seen it?) you know pretty much what to expect in terms of humor and fun.

Part Two starts out with a bang as Nagasumi brings a stray kitten to school.  Cats, it turns out, are the one thing all mermaids are deathly afraid of, and this kitten running around school has all of the fish folk in a frenzy.  Some of the best laughs in the series are had here, showing the terrible monster from the mermaid's perspective, and then the real scene from the human's.  Some additional rivalry is brought in when the class president (whose real name is unknown) is shown to hide a deep love for Nagasumi behind her thick glasses and shy demeanor. Next, Akeno Shiranui comes into town.  She is an inspector for the mermaids who tests to see how the mermaids are doing fitting into human life, and anyone who reveals themselves is exiled back into the ocean.  Hijinks ensue.

Of course, all sorts of other wacky stuff happens.  A field trip to Kyoto.  Sun and Luna's tough fathers running around in school girl outfits.  Kai heading to the hot springs wearing his full astronaut suit.  Pretty much nothing makes sense in ""My Bride is a Mermaid,"" and that is exactly how I like it.

One thing I really liked about ""Part Two"" was the ending.  In too many series they don't wrap things up properly, but this series was really satisfying.  Nagasumi even got a chance to man-up at the end, and the final freeze-frame shot at the end had me rolling.  Very well done.

My complaints with the series are the same as with ""Part One.""  Whoever did the subtitles went overboard trying to capture the Seto accent and Sun and her group come off sounding like a bunch of hillbillies, which is not at all how it sounds in Japanese.  There are a few other lame misses with the subtitles, such as when Luna's father (who is a clear parody of the Terminator) gives the classic line ""I'll be back"" but it winds up in the subtitles as ""I'll return soon.""  The joke is lost in translation.

But weak subtitles can't bury a great comedy, and that is what you get here.  No fan service.  Not an amazing series. But it keeps up a good pace and delivers with every episode.  Good times.",1285027200,9,2734,4.739406779661017

4123791,5,B003H6KRMK,"Ah young love, or in this case marriage. This series is good if your in the mood for a cute and enjoyable series. I would say it's one of those series that pretty much contains NO fan service, so if your looking for that it's not here. The plot takes Mermaid's stereotypicalness away, the Seto family is a brutal mob. In general this is a very light-hearted series about love, family, and comedy. In conclusion I think highly of this series, it's funny and cute...what's not to like?",1281052800,3,483,4.5
4123792,4,B003H6KRMK,"If Jr. High School student Nagasumi Michishio watched as much anime as I do, it should have come as no surprise to him that a seemingly harmless family vacation to the Seto Inland Sea would result in an engagement to a beautiful, sweet girl whose family is made up of the local yakuza clan all of which who happen to be merfolk.  I mean, this kind of stuff happens all the time, right?

So yeah, ""My Bride is a Mermaid"" (Japanese title ""Seto no Hanayome"" or ""The Bride of Seto"") is one of those kinds of anime.  But that doesn't mean it isn't good.  When working in an established genre, it is really a question of how good they do the genre, and this series does a great job.

The Magical Girl/Harem combo can be done for romance (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ah-My-Goddess/dp/B000VAR0T8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ah!

Based on the manga of the same name by Tahiko Kimura., this series is almost a parody of the genre and delivers some good laughs with the many bizarre situations Nagasumi finds himself in.  The undersea humor reminded me a lot of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/One-Piece/dp/B00143XE64/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">One Piece</a>&nbsp;more than anything else, with the romantic element thrown in.  ""My Bride is a Mermaid"" is pretty much a fan service -free anime, with maybe just the slightest hint of it here or there if you squint your eyes, but that is about it.

The story is basic:  Nagasumi and his family go for vacation to the Seto Inland Sea, where Nagasumi almost drowns and finds himself rescued by a beautiful mermaid.  No one believes his story until that same mermaid, named Seto and with legs this time, shows up at his doorstep and begs for Nagasumi to accept her as his fianc&eacute;.  The merfolk have a code, it seems, of killing any human that sees them in their nautical form, and the only way around it is for Nagasumi to take Seto as his bride.  Marry the beautiful girl or be killed.  Of course, to complicate matters Seto's family is also the local yakuza clan, and Seto's father would much rather see Nagasumi dead than give away his precious daughter.

 Nagasumi and Seto are only engaged, not married, so they spend time going on dates and Seto eventually returns with Nagasumi to his hometown of Saitama to attend school with him and get to know him in preparation for their future.  Seto's family isn't going to let her go off alone, however, and they soon show up to wreck havoc on Nagasumi's school life.  Of course, there are some human girls back at school that fancy Nagasumi as well, and a rival mermaid shows up to give Seto a battle for Nagasumi, who she wants to take as her manservant.  Hijinks ensue.

There is all sorts of good comedy packed into this series.  Seto has legs only so long as her feet don't get wet, which means that water is flying everywhere during the series.  Seto's bodyguard Maki is a tiny little elf-girl that lives in a spiral shell but comes out sword a swinging every time she thinks Nagasumi is over-stepping his bounds.  The series relies a lot on running gags and playing around with the genre tropes, such as Nagasumi getting his ""first kiss"" stolen by male yakuza member Masa so Nagasumi is rendered as a ""bishonen"" -type whenever Masa shows up.  When Seto gets serious, she is suddenly shrouded in darkness and accompanied by falling cherry blossoms, which leads the other characters to wonder where all the blossoms are coming from.  There are two transformed-animal yakuza members, Shark Fujishiro and Octopus Nakajima who are exactly what their names sound like.

The only complaint I have with ""My Bride is a Mermaid"" is with the subtitles.  Japanese is a language with many regional dialects, and too often translators feel compelled to use various English accents or way of speaking to capture this.  It doesn't work.  Even though Sun and her family speak perfectly polite Japanese using the dialect local to Seto, the subtitles have them speaking like a bunch of hillbillies saying things like ""yer gonna get it"" or other ridiculous phrases.  When Sun says ""Watashi was Nagasumi no tsuma ni naru"" the subtitles says ""I'm yer future wife"" which is not at all correct.  She doesn't speak like an uneducated country bumbkin.  I don't mind it if this kind of translations is used when done for effect, like when the tiny Maki talks in her ""yakuza voice"" when trying to be intimidating but then switches back to normal Japanese, but putting those words in Sun's mouth all the time just doesn't work.

This release by Funimation has the first 13 episodes of the 26-episode series originally released in 2007.  The series is continued in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Bride-Is-a-Mermaid-Season-One-Part-Two/dp/B003SPDSCQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Bride Is a Mermaid: Season One, Part Two</a>.  Although the boxsets say ""Season One,"" there actually is no ""Season Two"" following up this anime There were two OVA releases in 2008 and 2009, although I don't know if there are plans to release these as well, but it is possible they would be released as a limited ""Season Two,"" but they would be very short and non-continuous.",1279152000,7,5502,5.143820224719101
4123793,4,B003H6KRMK,"It's easy to dismiss My Bride Is a Mermaid as just another dull harem series based off the cover. Ordinary guys have been surrounded by beautiful women in anime since Ah My Goddess proved the formula could work, and it was about time a mermaid was added to the mix. Fortunately for those who might be a bit burnt off the classic formula, there's more than meets the eye to My Bride Is a Mermaid.

It's summer, and Nagasumi Michishio couldn't be more thrilled to spend it at the beach, where he could go swimming and maybe even meet a girl or two while he's at it. Unfortunately for him, the first girl he comes across sees him at his worst- when he's about to drown- and even worse: she's not even human! His savior, Sun Seto is a mermaid and not just any mermaid: she's the heiress to a clan of mermaid yakuza. By mermaid law, Sun should be killed for revealing her true identity to a human, so her mobster family decides to kill Nagasumi and his family instead and make it so that this little blip never happened. The only way to save his life is by marrying Sun, and while he accepts at once, before long, he finds out that spending the rest of his life with a mermaid- one who also happens to be a yakuza princess with a VERY overprotective father and some odd childhood friends- might be more trouble than it's worth...

Like the title suggests, My Bride Is a Mermaid is a romantic comedy, with a very heavy emphasis on the ""comedy"" part. Most of the humor here is very in your face, so if you like your comedies on the subtler side, you might want to skip this. It also takes a few episodes to get going (about 4) before it hits its stride. It's incredibly funny, though, and manages to stay fresh up until the very end, partially thanks to the cast of wacky characters. There are a number of running gags that might make you groan after awhile (Nagasumi's first kiss, for one), but the rest of the show's hilarious enough that you can forgive it for milking a few jokes a bit too much. There are a fair number of references to other anime series added in to spice the show up as well, so if situational comedy's not your thing, you might just bust a gut laughing at the allusions to Dragonball Z or Fist of the North Star.

The harem parts of My Bride Is a Mermaid are never put in the forefront. A number of Nagasumi's classmates have feelings for him, but the show never dwells on that fact for too long. Comedy is the name of the game with this show, and its other parts aren't able to bring it down.

As far as the animation goes, it's pretty standard for a comedy series. This show shares a director with Magikano, so if you're familiar with that, expect the same amount of odd facial expressions to be played for laughs.

For some reason, the composers of this series decided to go all out with the score, and it shows. The music is generally very fitting, and it's not recycled ad nauseum like in a number of other anime series.

For those wondering, this DVD contains the first half of the series (about 13 episodes). It features both an English dub and a subtitled Japanese language track. The English cast is pretty standard for the most part with generally good voice actors, but Todd Haberkorn really plays Nagasumi well. The Japanese track is just as good, with Haruko Momoi's standout performance as Sun, so it's really just a matter of preference. Funimation made some changes to the script, as per the norm, so expect Sun's family to have a country accent and for several lines to be changed for them to make more sense in English.

Overall, while My Bride Is a Mermaid might not be for everyone (comedies rarely are), it's worth a try for someone looking for a light, funny series to check out. The name and premise might be slight turnoffs, but it will most likely have you laughing out loud before it's over.",1277510400,17,3834,4.376404494382022

4123809,3,B003H6KRMK,"I had heard for some time how funny this show was and I was looking forward to seeing it.  So I finally got it this past Christmas and I have to say that I'm glad it wasn't my money that got spent.

First of all, the show just isn't funny, especially in English.  The humor tries way too hard and generally just falls flat.  The English dub is barely average at best and drains what little comedy there is out of it.  While there are some decent performances, the weakness of Todd Haberkorn's portrayal of the lead male character is a major flaw.  He is unemotional, flat, and his voice in the role is just irritating to me.  I was disappointed as I've generally been a fan of most of Todd's performances, but this is undoubtedly his weakest to date.  Sadly this is yet another Funimation dub that could have been quite good if they had just put a bit more time and consideration into casting a lead character instead of just picking some hot in house actor, seemingly by throwing at a dart board.  It's doubly shameful as the script is actually pretty strong, at least with the material they had to work with.

On the bright side, the video quality is respectable, particularly for an anime release that has 6+ episodes per disc.  There are some compression artifacts, but they are not to the degree that has been seen in other Funi releases such as Ghost Hunt, Fruits Basket and others.  Their video quality for their collections took sometime to improve but it appears to finally be on the same level as Sentai, Media Blasters and others.

Also, while the dub is weak and the show is overall rather unfunny, I did find the Japanese language version slightly more enjoyable.  The voices suit their characters much more closely and there is some true emotion in their performances.  If you're going to watch it, I would recommend the Japanese track (and this is coming from a HUGE dub fan.)

All in all, it's a relatively solid release of a fairly bland property with a lackluster dub.  I doubt that even with a better dub that the show would have been much better.  It's not terrible.  It's not even really bad.  It's just remarkably average and unfunny.  I would only recommend this on clearance.",1330214400,,2199,4.530456852791878
