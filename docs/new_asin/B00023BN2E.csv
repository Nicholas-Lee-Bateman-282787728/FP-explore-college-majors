8021237,2,B00023BN2E,"The ""Letterbox"" presentation doesn't translate to full screen, so there are side borders as well as top and bottom borders. This cuts the presentation in half...

*edit: This is because the disc is not anamorphic. It didn't work on my Xbox one, but a reddit post said the 360 or any other DVD player would work and this is the case. Not sure about the film just yet..",1452470400,,367,4.397058823529412

8021240,4,B00023BN2E,"Plot:  Set in medieval China, a young scout stumbles his way into the middle of a trippy supernatural war between magic kung fu masters and all powerful demons that look like flying sheets.

Review: As exciting as it is disorientating, the utterly bizzare ""Zu Warriors"" sprints through its epic plot, gigantic cast,and escalting dark fantasy elments without ever slowing down or stopping to explain itself.  Needless to say you aren't going to have an easy time following this one. Thankfully, the film doesn't take itself too seriously, freely mixing physical comedy and even ironic self-aware humor into the increasingly surreal action. The highly creative and ballet like kung fu fights are frequent and complex with weird cartoonish special effects and wire work. The effects are somewhat dated in places and you can even see ""wires"" occasionally, however this is all part of the campy fun appeal. All the performers appear to be having a ton of fun, providing the movie with boundless energy and charm.  And while the film does show its age and budget, the ideas and visuals are so wild and imaginative, you are still going to have your mind blown.",1300406400,4,1153,4.958549222797927
8021241,5,B00023BN2E,"I usually enjoy films by Tsui Mark. But, this film is different. The blurb says, ""The result is a spellbinding fantasy to delight fans of sci-fi , martial arts, special effects..."". I only partly agree with this. A fantasy story like the story of the ""fall"" is spellbinding because it touches something inside of us. By contrast, this film does not have inside it any kernel of truth at all. I also have difficulty following the theme of the story because of its incredibility. However, this is not to say that I do not derive any satisfaction of all from this story. For one thing, I derive great satisfaction in watching the traditional mannerism of the ladies. Modern, urban chinese ladies tend to feel inferior if they do not expose the yang character of their personality at all. Also, I have ""fetishism"" from watching nude, beautiful female feet. Brigitte Lin's feet look particularly beautiful in her various poses. I wish she will allow me to kiss her feet. So, this factor alone negatives ab initio the feelings of incredulity shown by the various parts of the movie. I am happy to give this movie 5 star.",1261440000,3,1114,4.688775510204081
8021242,4,B00023BN2E,"I would say this film is about the corniest movie I have every seen, but I really like it.  Take it for what it is-cheesy Kung-Fu with cheesy effects.  Almost too much to bear, but it has good characters and a good enough plot.  This movie is not for everyone.",1119916800,2,260,4.16
8021243,4,B00023BN2E,"An absolutely amazing movie! Fans of classical mythology as well as comic book readers should check this film out at once. An incredible plot charged with ancient conflicts between good and evil serves as the backdrop to some wonderful charachter (sic) development. Anyone who enjoyed ""the bride with whie hair"" or any other magical epic set in ancient china will indeed get a massive kick from this movie. Unfortunately, the breakneck pace of the amazing plot combined with only subtitles available to all us occidentals means that if you blink, you're lost. SEE IT!",990057600,9,567,5.042553191489362
