8665076,4,B00LBYKL3A,A well acted India-Pakistan political statement for peace.  Although in film form it is a theatrical piece with few scene changes and a minimum of actors. But the storyline is immortal regarding the simple soldiers from enemy armies having to accommodate to the war while their mutual memories of the prewar life keep crying for peace between the blood-brother  nations.,1449014400,,370,5.15
8665077,4,B00LBYKL3A,"This film is more like a play with just two characters. Other two characters are marginal. The long conversation interspersed with invective and memories of the refugees from India and Pakistan make for a lively exchange.  Actor Viajy Raaz has done a good job as a director and actor. Surprise is Manu Rishi who plays the Indian cook/soldier. He has also written the dialogue. The movie is set in 1948, a remote corner of Jamu and Kashmir border. Based on an absurd assumption, the movie exposes the emotions and fears of the Indians and Pakistanis. Sad to say that those feeling persist after 67 years. The movie has relevance because so much time has been wasted on 'winning' by Pakistan to the detriment of its own people. India is caught in the mess of Kashmir trying to pacify restless population for 30 years.",1413676800,,815,4.699300699300699
