6132112,4,B00H4IR3JC,"""Flu"" is like a Korean version of ""Outbreak,"" and not in a bad way. While the actors aren't as well known, and the budget isn't quite Hollywood, the film showed thoughtful treatment and pacing of a viral pandemic unleashed in a suburb of Seoul. The cover art teaser depicts a bit more degradation then we actually see in the movie, but the cinematography and effects were fine. This is not a movie of huge explosions, but of society grinding to a halt and being overwhelmed by disease. However, where this film shines, is the acting between the two leads - Soo Ae as the single mother/doctor and Hyuk Jang as the Emergency Response Team member. Their personal story of survival and a simmering passive/aggressive romance grabs your attention, and holds it throughout the movie. You care about these characters and want to see their outcome. Yet, their story is integral to the main plot, as they are embroiled in the race to find patient zero who may have immunity to the disease. I would also like to compliment the child actress who played Soo Ae's daughter - she did a terrific job.

The Korean background made for a pleasant change, and offered scenery, politics, and cultural differences that enhanced the film's story. For example, the quarantine situation and conditions might not be as believable if it were America. Part of me feels the shooting and rioting would have started far sooner... with the streets being more of a nightmare. Here, the only guns shown are in the hands of the military/police. For some, this might take away from the movie, but for me, it was the interaction between the characters that made it worthy. Of course, for those seeking action, there is still plenty of pandemic violence, and gore effects from the disease, just not what I would call on a Hollywood scale.

The movie uses English sub-titles, and I didn't find them distracting.

Parental Guidance: There is no nudity, and the language is fine. However, as noted, you have disease gore, societal violence, disturbing mass grave depiction, and Soo Ae's daughter is constantly shown in dire circumstances, so all in this probably should be an ""R"" rating, though most older teens would be accustomed to these scenes from other pandemic movies.

Overall, while ""Flu"" doesn't bring anything new to the genre, I give it 4 out of 5 stars on my foreign film rating scale.",1396396800,22,2358,4.800492610837439
6132113,5,B00H4IR3JC,"In April of 2014 a sealand full of people from Hong Kong are smuggled into Bundang, Korea. By the time the crate gets there, all are dead from a mutated Avian flu strain except one individual, who roams the city. Meanwhile, Kang Ji-koo a volunteer first responder is saving a lady doctor from her car. He does this job to meet women, and is attracted to her. Dr. Kim In-hae (Soo Ae) has no interest in him and gives him the brush off.

Our doctor has a daughter and through a series of circumstances the daughter becomes attached to our first responder and also meets our wondering patient zero. As the city turns into a pandemic, it gets shut down under marshal law and as fate would have it, only our first responder can save the little girl as tens of thousands die around them.

The story was well done. The English dubbing was weak at times. The beginning was light and the translation took on cliches in a ""What's Up Tiger Lily"" fashion. However once the action intensified, the movie lost all humor. This is another flu gone bad film, but doesn't have an infinite amount of subplots to follow like so many in this genre. It makes it simple. Good cinematography.

Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex or nudity. People in under garments. $9.96 Walmart",1396137600,2,1252,4.530973451327434
6132114,4,B00H4IR3JC,"This movie really touches the heart at many parts. It was entertaining, had a good plot, action packed, filled with drama, suspense, love, as well as the usual scientific themes and end of the world scenarios. *semi spoiler alert* It had a touch of the corny big shot authorities challenging one another as well as the little girl getting lost and both kang and kim search for her. This happened 3 times where she was left alone lost and both of them searching for her as we the viewers are supposed to be torn in our emotions every which way as our hearts go out to a young sick/ girl looking for her mommy. All in all it was better than most epidemic films I have seen and foreign films do not cease to amaze me in terms of substance, QUALITY, I WILL SAY QUALITY AGAIN because it deserves to be said twice, and also being down to earth human emotion it invokes. The difference between Hollywood movies is it tries to focus on action and throwing money at big picture and special effects and loses it's way in plot and connecting with the viewer. Foreign films such as this capture a beautiful romance in connecting with the viewer in a realistic touching , heartfelt way. I appreciate foreign films such as these and hopefully more will follow. In conclusion this film was definitely awesome but didn't so much knock me off my feet or ""blow my hair back."" I think most people who watch this film will rate it a 4 or higher! Happy viewing! Godbless

6132118,4,B00H4IR3JC,"Outbreak of deadly strain of bird flu sends a residential area of Bundang district, Seongnam city, into a panic. Peoples only hope of survival rests on the shoulders of one unexpected person. This is a familiar formula for action movies involving natural disasters, but South Korean movie The Flu (Gamgi) makes an effective use of it, and the result is a pretty entertaining action movie with some emotional moments.

The films main characters are Kang Ji-goo (Jang Hyuk), a good-natured rescue worker who gets acquainted with a single mother Kim In-hae (Soo Ae) and her adorable daughter Kim Mi-reu (Park Min-ha). As the panic spreads in the area (which happens to be close to Seoul, capital of the country), military forces step in. Kang Ji-goo and Kim In-hae are ready to do anything  I mean anything  to save the life of the little girl and other citizens.

The films premise of pandemic may remind us of such films as Contagion and Outbreak, but director Sung-su Kim (Musa) puts emphasis on dramatic relationships between the characters. As a result, The Flu especially its second half gets very emotional and intense, if not totally scientifically convincing.

You may spot countless plot holes and incredible coincidences, but with fine performances from the cast, The Flu is an engrossing ride.",1390953600,,1302,5.0092592592592595

Great Plot.

However, the one thing holding it back was a lack of character development. No one character was really developed, and even though the little girl is precious, I was left feeling like I was just getting to know them as the film ended. Still a stellar effort! The main characters were very good actors, and the little girl was perfect! Man, she is good and we'll probably be seeing her for years to come.

There is a charm to this movie. It starts out where boy and girl meet. It almost has the feel of a rom-com. There are some hilarious moments in the beginning and the chemistry between the lead actors is great! As the story progresses into the meat of the movie, it becomes dark fast - without losing the charm it had in the beginning. You become attached to the characters, you get to know THEM. You end up feeling tired after watching this movie because I swear, you went on the ride with them like you were there.

6132156,4,B00H4IR3JC,"There have been a few movies over the decades dealing with a virulent disease, being loosed on a large population, that needs to be dealt with sooner than later. Some, such as the zombie laden ""World War Z"" or ""Contagion"" are among the better. ""Flu"", for my dollar, is right up there.

Here's the scoop. A guy, locked in a shipping container with many others being smuggled into Korea, is really sick. By the time they are set loose all his fellow containees are dead. Only he survives while the virus begins infecting the city in record time. Meanwhile, a first time responder rescues a doctor from her car which is about to plummet into an underground labyrinth. To his chagrin, she doesn't seem all that grateful. But soon he, the doctor and her young daughter are in a race to find a cure for the virus before the entire city becomes history.

This is a really cool flick. It is densely and cleverly plotted which brings visions of Hollywood producers scrambling for their version of it. You have the search for the survivor, by the medical community, as he holds the key to the cure. But he's also hunted by the brother of a guy killed by the disease. Then there are the authorities trying to find the cure while keeping a quarter of a million people quarantined who are frightened to levels bordering on mass panic. Then you have the first responder who is trying to keep the doctor's daughter safe because she might be proof the cure works. And the clock is ticking. The story factions all work well. The characters a good. The hero has a comic side-kick to help things from becoming too overwrought. There are some key scenes involving large numbers of citizens beginning to riot which are staged very well. There are also scenes of what is becoming a mass grave that are quite eerie. There are other serious aspects of the story happening too numerous to note here, but let it be said, this all culminates in a very rousing climax. The split second timing of said climax might put some off and rightfully so, but it's still a heck of a ride.

The directing of some of the scenes seemed a bit rushed but most were directed spot on. The main characters were generally good though they do paint the American medical authorities as being a bit too hard-edged. What really is happening here is the plotting. It's a cool story told really well.

6132169,4,B00H4IR3JC,"This movie is a South Korean version of Contagion, popular enough to attract American attention and a release on DVD [disconcertingly the dialog is dubbed with American voices rather than subtitles; Ive grown so used to following the subtitles]  There are distinct differences from other films in this genre.  The film starts with relationships and it sticks with them all the way through, not getting overly carried away by scenes of people dying.  The hazard is a mutated avian flu brought into Korea in a container illegally filled with Vietnamese workers being smuggled into Korea for cheap labor.  One person had a cough as they left Vietnam, and by the time they arrive in Korea, all but one person are dead.  That one guy escapes, rapidly spreading the disease with his coughing, but also holding out the best chance for a cure if they can find him in time and bulk-produce his antibodies.  This film is unexpectedly topical today with the Ebola outbreak going on in Africa and potentially spreading to other continents, and the controversial rapid use of an antibody treatment never tested before in humans.  So as infection rapidly spreads in this South Korean city, the mayor dithers about quarantining, the President calls in the military who separate people into  infected [who are going to be left to die] and non-infected [some of whom might actually be infected, but still asymptomatic] and the biggest baddie proves to be an American military advisor [giving us a glimpse of how some average South Koreans see us] who plans to nuke the whole city to ensure it doesnt spread to the rest of the world.  Meanwhile the focus mainly stays on some of the first characters we meet: an EMS worker who saves a very pretty young lady and is rather smitten with her.  She is aloof to his attempts to flirt.  Theres lighthearted joking between him and his co-worker as to whether he has any chance of scoring a date.  Turns out, naturally, shes a viral researcher who knows a thing or two about manufacturing antibodies.  And while our heros hopes for a date with her fade, he unexpectedly runs into her charming daughterwho of course catches the flu
Theres not really anything ground-breaking here, mainly an interest in how a South Korean Contagion looks [it seems to have a more optimistic feel than comparable American movies] and the unexpected resonance with the Ebola outbreak.  I give this a B-",1408147200,,2406,4.836585365853659

6132174,4,B00H4IR3JC,"Please Note the following has plot spoilers / reveals.

Yes it's Korean and about an outbreak of nasty flu - the sort that has numbers and letters like HN5D1 or something, so we know it is gonna be bad. What happens is a group of illegal immigrants who are being trafficked in a shipping container all get infected. On arrival in Bundang (just a few miles from Seoul) it is opened and one of the traffickers foot soldiers gets infected. There is only one survivor and he, quite sensibly, does a runner. Said trafficker then goes on a cough and sneezathon across the city.

Then in as little as 36 hours the virus starts to spread, with no incubation period and cold like symptoms in the early stages, this is going to be hard to deal with and then people start dying. The authorities are very soon overwhelmed and drastic measures are taken to contain the outbreak. The story is told through the eyes of a young, attractive, female doctor Kim In-hae (Soo Ae) and her young daughter; and an Emergency Response Team, man called Jigu (Hyuk Jang) - they meet after a car crash and he sort of falls for her, oh and he's good looking too, but you had guessed that.

As the contagion spreads things get ever more desperate and as is essential in these types of films we have to find a cure and turn it into a vaccine and the clock is ticking. As is always de rigueur for epidemic films, we have the authorities being spectacularly wrong and putting profit before people and we also get a load of action, explosions and even shooting. This is what Korea does best, a great big emotional roller coaster with clichs and coincidences by the truck load- sorry exploding truck load. It is over whelmingly sentimental and wears its plot holes proudly on its sleeve. We have the comic asides too that is often a feature of Korean cinema. There is a cast of thousands and the twists keep coming right till the end. If you like Korean cinema you will love this, if you want some serious, thoughtful and original cinema then this is probably not for you. I really loved it but it has its `issues' hence my rating, but I could watch it again and still enjoy it - recommended.",1405296000,5,2156,4.4393939393939394

It's actually a decent movie that begins when a group of illegals are smuggled into the country.  Unbeknownst to anyone inside, one of them has contracted a deadly virus.  Everyone in the cargo hold is dead except for the carrier, who escapes to spread it among the populace.  There is some soap opera with a scientist, her daughter, and a rescue worker.  There is the government fighting among themselves to keep things in order, but just making things chaotic. Is there a cure?  Will the President allow his people to be killed to prevent the spread of the pathogen?  Will the rescue worker kiss the heroic scientist?  If you didn't like Outbreak, this is not the movie for you.  If you're expecting the greatness of the original Andromeda Strain, look elsewhere.

Between him and the two smugglers who find the shipment of dead bodies, soon many of the city's residents are ill and dying, the military sent in to seal off the city and contain the disease.  On a more human scale, the story revolves around city rescue worker Ji-goo, and doctor In-hye, who search the city for the surviving illegal, whose blood may contain the only hope for a cure.  Add In-hye's young daughter, who accidentally stumbles across the sick man, and 'Flu' becomes a stylish, suspense-filled race against time that keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end, while never losing the human touch of caring about what happens to the lead characters and one spunky little girl.

The acting is good in this one and it has English subtitles. We are overdue for a superbug to arrive and take out a third of the worlds population probably.

6132188,4,B00H4IR3JC,"Some commenters said it 'trumped' Hollywood. Now I understand what they meant. The acting didn't, or special effects, or any of that. It was the story line itself.

If Hollywood put out such a film it would not be shown in theaters here. It might even be banned. I just can't see them doing it.  It's far too realistic as to what would probably REALLY happen in such a situation. Hollywood continues to promote American government propaganda. They are generally always portrayed as kind and benevolent, taking care of the citizens, in the disaster movies. Even when they all save themselves and leave the citizens to suffer the disaster, they still try to save some. And they're generally good hearted, moral real people.

Here we see what happens when hell breaks loose and you have tiers of command.

This EMT guy was unbelievable, though. He was a guy every girl needs! Some of it just wasn't (maybe) believable.

I ask all of you at the end of the movie, can you remember the girl's name? I don't think I'll ever forget it!",1399161600,,1027,4.6208791208791204

The 3 main characters (male emergency response employee , female doctor and her daughter) have distinct personalities and are presented initially in a humorous manner.  There was very good chemistry between the main characters and the overall acting in the film was very good. The outbreak of the flu and subsequent quarantine of the people is presented fairly realistically with a horror element to it.  The second half of the film falls into a more predictable pattern with a lot of action sequences, good guy/bad guy confrontations and political in-fighting.

Overall a very good movie with humor, horror, action, politics and a romantic angle all mixed in.

6132193,4,B00H4IR3JC,"  Doggam - FLU

South Korean films have all the excitement, clichs and product placement of any contemporary Hollywood blockbuster if Flu is any indication of things to come.  Roland Emmerich meet Kim Sung-su.  Cast the cutest 5year old on the planet, Park Min-ha, add every iconic plague spreading scene known to man, throw in some useless politicians and an evil American who is first called to help because America is still the best and then at the climax have him give an order to bomb the suburbs of Seoul.  Throw in enough helicopters, smoke and fire, and scenes of a city of a half million on the outskirts of Seoul which apparently consists of massive high rise luxury apartments lining either side of the traffic jammed boulevards between which is a canal with walking path. Stir in illegal immigration as the vector for this highly mutated H5N1 just cuz its convenient and then a cheezie love story between Park Min-has doctor mommy and the EMT she meets in the opening scene when he saves her from an exciting plunge into an unexplained hole in the middle of a street.  Mix until smooth.  Then bake for 90 minutes until the scene that didn't leave a dry eye in the theatre and the scene that will haunt this childs career her entire life.

In 2070 when shes 63 and it will be either the first scene they show in the montage of scenes from her career or the last.  She can milk a line for all its worth and make it her own, baby.

In the meantime, of course, she could always end up in a Margaret Cho sitcom if were lucky.  But I have a feeling Seouls going to want to keep her for their own.",1398470400,,1602,4.393220338983051

6132196,5,B00H4IR3JC,I enjoyed this movie a lot. It had everything all packed in one film. I recommend everyone to watch it.,1397952000,,103,4.2
6132197,1,B00H4IR3JC,"You would think this would be an important element for everyone to know.  The movie is in Korean.  If you want the English version, you have to read the subtitles.  At this point, the amazon streaming movie makes no mention that it is a subtitled movie.  I believe that is something that SHOULD BE IN THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PRODUCT.

The trailer is the opening of the movie.  It shows the sexy, female doctor having a car wreck being saved by the future hero of the story.  Her fear of being entrapped in a car that is hanging precariously on a ledge becomes secondary to her concern about her torn skirt.  The hero rescues her and has a case of insta-love.  She blows him off, but later seeks him out to retrieve her purse.

The next big scene shows a container full of refugees/slaves? at a large port being placed on a ship.  They arrive at Bandung with everyone dead except for one young man, Moon Sai, whom promptly escapes.  (And this is when the infection starts spreading).  The bad men in charge of the operation all speak English at this time, because they are bad.

The hero returns the purse to the 4 or 5 year old daughter of the sexy doctor.  The doctor is called in that night because of an infectious, deadly flu outbreak.  She leaves her small daughter at home ALONE.  It appears this isn't the first time.  In the meantime in a clear rip-off of outbreak, Mi Reu, the little girl, encounters Moon Sai and feeds him food (think monkey at the edge of the woods).  She finds out Moon Sai is sick, and she calls her mother's rescuer to help.  Why not call her mom, the doctor?  They try to find Moon Sai, but fail.  In the meantime, the Hero finds out the little girl is ill.  He loses her in the mall, but mass panic is already occurring as you are greeted with many scenes of people throwing up blood.  (This is supposed to be the flu, not a hemorrhagic virus like ebola, but this is being done to make it gory.)  We see doctors standing around with NEBULIZER MASKS.  The clear masks are not respirators.  They are NEBULIZER masks used in things like treating asthma.  Soooo, Dr. Kim, the sexy mommy doctor, finds her daughter at the same time with our Hero.

Her daughter has the flu, so they cannot evacuate.  The CDC has all 460,000 citizens rounded up into a camp to be tested.  (Umm... the CDC would never be put in charge due to a lack of jurisdiction.  Korea would call on the World Health Organization.  English is spoken again as we learn that the CDC is bad.) The CDC burns the sick alive in large pits.  They decide they have lost control, so they are going to bomb them.  Again, we get this in English, because the CDC is bad.  In the meantime, Dr. Kim has cured her daughter, but the CDC doesn't care and orders the bombing.  The courageous Bandung mayor stops them.

Ugh... the ending shows that the CDC and the United States are evil, but the Korean mayor saves the little girl.

If you can't figure out why I disliked this poorly done ripoff of Outbreak... Needless to say, this is crap.  Ask yourself this question, why couldn't they just blame this on their own government?",1397433600,8,3106,4.3807017543859645
