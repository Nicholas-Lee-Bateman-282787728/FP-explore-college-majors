2612214,5,B000GH3PN6,"If not for my Britcom loving ex-pat English wife, I probably would have never discovered Only Fools and Horses.  Starting with Series 1 - 3, these stateside DVD releases are met with anticipation in our household that only rivals Christmas.  That being said, it was ""Holiday Time"" once again as Series 7 arrived at the front door.

For the uninformed, Only Fools follows the exploits of brothers/""businessmen"" Derrick & Rodney Trotter.  Accompanied by a cast of strong supporting characters (Especially Roger Floyd-Pack as Trigger who also plays Owen in the Vicar of Dibley), Only Fools travels familiar sitcom roads albeit with a fresh, funny and character driven approach.  The final episode ""Three Men, A Woman and A Baby"" drives this point home.

Britcoms differ greatly from their American counterparts.  By using a fifty minute time format, Only Fools is able to broaden the palette.  Not only do you have great comedic moments, but you have interwoven areas of drama, that thanks to strong character development, provide for a stronger, more balanced show.

I am not sure how well Series 7 will translate to American viewers.  Although it is great television, it is not typical American fare and there are a lot of dated and transatlantic colloquialisms that I even had to ask about.  However, if you are already a lover of British television and especially Only Fools, then Series 7 will be a great addition.  After all, Only Fools is the only reason I took a picture of a ""3-Wheel Van"" while in England earlier this year!

It would have been nice if the BBC would have kept up with the DVD packaging they produced for the first two Only Fools sets.  The cheap plastic case Series 7 arrives in resembles something Del might pass off as ""New and exquisite!""

If you are new to the series, start from the beginning.  If you already know the Trotter's than pick right up where you left off!",1161475200,12,1895,4.7846153846153845
2612215,5,B000GH3PN6,"This is Britcom at its very best.  Join the Brothers Trotter for the seventh and final regular season of one of the funniest shows ever to grace the television screen on either side of the Atlantic.

This season begins with the special, ""Rodney Come Home"" (which should be viewed first).  As the season progresses, we follow the antics of the loveable but larcenous Derrick (DelBoy) as he practices his art of selling questionable, to say the least, merchandise.  We see his love affair with Raquel bloom and grow into something truly beautiful.

Rodney is back at Nelson Mandela House after a short and disastrous marriage and the laughs continue as he returns to his earlier luckless wanderings and reluctant participation in DelBoy's schemes.

Uncle Albert is not to be missed with his many tales of wartime antics which no one wishes to hear.

Along for the rollicking ride are the usual cast of characters:  Boycie, the profitable and shameless used car dealer and his saucy wife Marlene with new baby in tow; Trigger, the intellectually challenged road sweeper; Mike, the bar owner; and Denzil, the hapless victim of DelBoy's ventures.  Also included are Cassandra, Rodney's estranged wife, and Raquel, DelBoy's true love.

Each 50 minute episode will have you holding your sides from laughing and wishing for more episodes to come.  Don't miss this hilarious Britcom in all its glorious splendor and pray that the remaining specials will soon be released as well.

So sit back, pop in a disc, and prepare to laugh your head off.  Highly recommended.  Lovely jubbly!

2612216,5,B000GH3PN6,"Produced in 1991, series seven marks the final series of episodes for this classic, long-running britcom.  As with series six, this one features six tightly-written, laugh-filled 50-minute episodes (plus the 75-minute Christmas special).  It too is serial in nature (ie. the episodes should be watched in chronological order), and if you enjoyed series six, you will not be disappointed with this one.

For those unfamiliar, the series revolves around the predicaments in which Derek ""Del Boy"" Trotter (David Jason), the smooth-talking wheeler-dealer of ""quality-challenged"" merchandise, lands himself, not to mention anyone within close proximity--which inevitably includes his younger brother, Rodney (Nicholas Lyndhurst) (who, though better educated and slightly more cultured (which, believe me, is not saying a lot), lacks Del's street-smarts and shrewdness).

All the regulars are back for series seven:  Boycie, the arrogant, shady used-car salesman, and his tarty wife, Marlene; Denzil (Paul Barber), the lorry-driver who's a sucker for getting caught up in Del's schemes; Trigger (Roger Lloyd Pack), the daft road sweeper to whom Rodney will always be ""Dave""; Mike the barman; Rodney's new wife, the sophisticated and elegant Cassandra; and last but not least, jolly old Uncle Albert, a less-than-capable old sea dog who could clear a room in seconds by uttering those immortal words, ""During the war....""  Also, a new regular joins the cast:  Del's long-lost sweetheart, Raquel (who first appeared in ""Dates"" (just prior to series six) and re-entered Del's life in ""Jolly Boys' Outing"" following series six).

Series seven kicks off with the 1990 Christmas special entitled ""Rodney Come Home"".  The special sees problems on the marital front for newlyweds Rodney and Cassandra, and this sets the tone for series seven so far as Rodney's now-non-existent love-life is concerned.  Suffice it to say, he's back in the flat with Del and Uncle Albert.  The problem is that Raquel is now in residence, and while three may be company, four is definitely a crowd!

I'll just mention one episode, ""The Class of '62,"" which sees the return of Slater (Jim Broadbent), a former police officer who went down for his involvement in diamond smuggling in ""To Hull and Back,"" and who happens to be the nemesis of Del and his mates.  But Del's in for more than he could've imagined when Slater waltzes back into his life!

I won't say any more as I don't wish to spoil the surprises or the punch lines.  Suffice it to say that, like series six, every episode in this series is top-notch and very well crafted.  Fifty-minute episodes allow for a greater development of the storylines, and writer John Sullivan's comedic skills have become so well-honed with these final two series that I'd highly recommend giving them a try even if you didn't especially care for series one through five (the half-hour ones).  So long as you enjoy top-notch, well-written British comedy, you're bound to enjoy Only Fools and Horses, which has reached it's full momentum with the final two series.  The pace continues with the seven side-splitting Christmas specials (nine actual episodes) which follow, and which I know I'm not alone in hoping that the BBC releases in North America.  If ever a series deserved to be released in its entirety, it is this one!

In conclusion, I highly, HIGHLY recommend Only Fools and Horses unhesitatingly and without reservation to all fans of the very best in British comedy.",1155081600,30,3485,5.156305506216697

2612248,5,B000GH3PN6,"My sister-in-law is a fan of British comedy and introduced us to this series.  We sometimes have trouble understanding everything said, but not only is the whole series hilarious, but sometimes heart tugging as well.  The actors are truly skilled at their craft, especially, I think, Rodney.  His face is so very expressive and subtle.  And Del Boy is not just the charlatan he seems at first but also a real man who truly cares about his family and friends as well as he can.  This is true entertainment and a lot of good laughs and a few tears.  I recommend it to anyone.",1356652800,,573,4.461538461538462

I live out in the middle of no-where and I don't get any TV reception so I order DVD's from Amazon. I ordered the 7th season of ""The Woodwrights Shop"" I don't don't know what the fools and horses thing is. But if a compulsive spammer like Amazon is selling it I'm sure that it must be something about spam. Cheers bob :)",1340409600,,423,4.170731707317073
2612251,3,B000GH3PN6,"I had seen the originals in the 80's while living in the UK, so being able to buy these oldies for my husband was wonderful. We introduced his family to the Trotter family and everyone laughed once we translated some of the true British phrases. We own another series from an earlier time which is more hilarious. This series sees everyone older, a little wiser and less funny. There are a couple of serious situations that one just cannot laugh about,such as when Raquel's ex returns and she's pregnant by Del. Raquel is a good match for Del, Uncle Albert and 'Dave'.
On the whole, the older sets are funnier, maybe because the decor & clothing is less contemporary. The picture and sound quality is fine, although we are not watching in HD. I am glad that the producers knew when to stop. Some of the jokes are getting past their sell-by-date and are below the belt.",1263686400,,868,4.535031847133758

2612253,3,B000GH3PN6,"Lets be honest, Series 7 is a disappointment.  Much as I enjoyed the preceding episodes, Series 7 is quite different and something of a ""downer.""  It is a darker, more serious set of episodes that I can only attribute to the writers running out of ideas or getting too preoccupied with the relationship issues between Rodney and Cassandra.  In summary, fewer laughs, less enjoyable and quite different from the former easy-going style of the previous episodes.",1206748800,,460,5.026315789473684
2612254,5,B000GH3PN6,"Only Fools and Horses was the top comedy show for years in the UK.  It's been years since we've seen it, and it didn't fail to have us laughing until our sides hurt.  David Jason shows what a versatile actor he is, starting in this comedy series and becoming UK's top comedy actor, he then went on to serious roles, most notably Inspector Frost, which has also become a favorite both sides of the Atlantic.  Thoroughly recommend this comedy, you may have trouble understanding the Cockney slang at times, but the humor never fails.  Be prepared to laugh until your sides ache.",1200355200,,576,4.617647058823529

I just heard you think ""why are you telling me this?"" well because it's was good enough to buy it again but I mostly bought it again because the disc with the singer with the speech impediment was the one that was damaged and that's the funniest episode of the series.
