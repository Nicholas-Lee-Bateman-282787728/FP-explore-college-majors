8342412,3,B001TX9VQ6,"The producers did an extraordinary job of taking a powerful history shaping event and making it seem quite mundane and ordinary.  It is a descent review of the history of the Great Awakening but it fails to capture the dynamic of the movement. For someone with no knowledge of the history, it would be helpful in understanding the context and the general facts of the time. It is illustrated through still photo re-depictions and music of the time. The running time is 35 minutes. It is a slow moving historical account that fell short of my expectations.

I salute the attempt to tell the story of the First Great Awakening on DVD. Yet, I'd love to see a more inspiring effort. A number of years ago, I saw a much better video produced by CBN. Unfortunately I've not been able to locate that DVD.",1273536000,9,797,4.527777777777778
