he lost his mate and was in mourning.  What a poignant sight.  The movie on Hallmark, ""Away and Back"" prompted me to purchase
the DVD for their family to enjoy.  It has such a special meaning to them.",1425859200,5,332,4.222222222222222

6992378,5,B00STY5J82,"Very, very pleasant movie!
Does not have all of the fake, overly-dramatic love triangle garbage placed within it.  It is just a beautifully filmed, family movie with very likeable characters.
If you want to relax and watch a family movie with just a very small smidgen of family/love tension . . . this may be the movie for you.
Enjoy!",1424995200,9,335,4.583333333333333
6992379,5,B00STY5J82,"This is another outstanding movie in the Hallmark arsenal.  While I have enjoyed their movies for a while, there has been a marked improvement in the quality of their movies over the past few years.  ""Away & Back"" is one of their outstanding movies from 2015.  From the young daughter to the couple who meet, the story really finds a place in your heart.  My husband and I really enjoyed watching this movie this year and hope to make it an annual treat.  If you missed it on Hallmark or can't wait again for the movie to become available, this DVD will be a great way to spend an evening.",1424476800,2,589,4.318181818181818

It has an interesting story line to keep everyone's attention. It was a stretch to think of the young girl riding the family jeep so many miles, and then using a map to find the swan, but suspend your disbelief and enjoy the movie!",1422662400,10,407,4.1265822784810124

6992385,5,B00STY5J82,"What I loved about this movie was the incredible heart in this movie of a little 10 year old girl who was brave, tenacious and full of hope. She narrated this story throughout. I could kick myself for glossing over this movie for years. I finally got it free through the Hallmark Now channel through Prime. This is the story of a family of 4. A dad and his two sons and young daughter making life go on after losing the wife and mom to Cancer 2 years before. A trumpeter Swan gets shot, rescued then let go only to appear later in the pond of this family. I do not want to give this movie away but strongly encourage families to sit down and watch this wonderful movie together. I watch a lot of movies and I am always looking for clean family movies. Males and females will enjoy this movie. There is a lot to learn here, a romance and the older brother story too. I loved it. Enjoy!!",1518048000,,885,4.181286549707602

The characters don't blow up anything and there are no shoot outs, state of the art weapons or robots set on death and destruction.  In spite of this, the story is captivating, the characters very well done and the storyline realistic.  I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good movie.",1459382400,10,411,4.527027027027027

6992418,4,B00STY5J82,"AWAY AND BACK is a 2015 Hallmark Hall of Fame movie and an unlikely romance between an uptight ornithologist and a widower who crafts custom doors and who lives on a rural sprawl of a farm just off Bluebunch Falls, Washington. The story's catalyst is the widower's wilful 10-year-old daughter, Frankie Peterson (Maggie Elizabeth Jones), who falls obsessed with a flock of rare trumpeter swans that've settled on the lake next to the farm. Frankie happens to be the sort of dynamic mover & shaker who can talk her peeps into doing whatever she wants. And so it doesn't take much for her to convince her two older brothers into getting closer to the swans.

The plot really kicks in when Frankie randomly rings up the Northwest Wildlife Trust in Oregon, seeking advice in avian care. She gets in touch with ornithologist Jennie Newsom (Minka Kelly) who, come to find, had been tagging, tracking and studying these very same swans. Cut now to Jennie Newsom's invasion of the Peterson farm, there to confiscate the swans and take them back to her Oregon facility for preservation and for further studies. Turns out, trumpeter swans are endangered birds that tend to succumb to natural hazards such as coyotes and, uh, gunshots and power lines. However, when the birds embark on their migratory pattern, their route takes them back to the Peterson farm. And so guess who's back, setting up camp, inches off the Peterson's property line?

It's mutual detestation from jump between the pushy ornithologist and Frankie's dad Jack (Jason Lee). It doesn't help that Jennie has zero people skills. She's more keen on the feathered family than the human one. As for Jack, he espouses that the swans are wildlife and so his children shouldn't mess with them. And yet he's quick to defend his kids when Jennie scolds them for doing just that.

But keep watching and see Jennie loosen up as the Petersons gradually let her into the fold. Note that the children's mom had passed away two years ago, and so there's that hole that needs filling. See Jack gradually warm up to Jennie because, geez, have you seen her? I do wish the writers had fleshed out the ornithologist more. Wolfing down hot dogs at the county fair with the kids does not deep characterization make.

AWAY AND BACK has got several things going for it. The production values are very solid. The scenic cinematography delivers just the right atmosphere, makes me want to relocate to that grand eastern Washington landscape. The trumpeter swans are majestically shot (with cameras, not shotguns). An excellent Jason Lee and the young Miss Jones - whose adorability left such an indelible impression in WE BOUGHT A ZOO - carry the acting load. The romance between Jack and Jennie comes to a head early enough that the writers had to come up with a third act crisis to round off the movie. Which is fine with me, seeing as how it concerns - and here's the big, honking SPOILER ALERT!! - the obstinate, super-plucky Frankie deploying on a 100-mile trek on an ATV to rescue a missing swan. Years later, and Maggie Elizabeth Jones hasn't lost her adorability. Watch, she's gonna be something.",1445817600,2,3137,4.792975970425139
