7943220,4,B00005KH3R,"This TV movie features David Paymer as a nerdy guy who becomes an unlikely and unwanted partner with star Casper Van
Dien, in a comedy that has some similarities to the far superior ""Midnight Run"".  Paymer has stolen a very valuable computer
program he plans to turn over to a beautiful Asian girl he thinks wants to become his lover or wife.  Actually she is part of a
cadre of thugs and she is using him.  He even is planning to leave his obnoxious wife and family for her.  But he becomes a
victim of Van Dien on the bus, a small time crook who is an expert at stealing without the victim being aware.  So now he must
try and get his program back, but that won't be easy.  What ensues is a series of rather humorous events and the good news
is that the script is witty, and the banter is often quite funny.  There is a sequence near the end featuring the lead thug, who
has a certain trait that is hilarious, and had me and the lady I watched with in tears laughing.  Not a great film, but surprisingly
entertaining, and better than I would have expected for a TV film.",1366156800,,1072,4.195121951219512
7943221,5,B00005KH3R,"Surprising little story about computer software theft with different partners involved.  David Paymer was never better, Casper never handsomer, and the various characters were spot on -- well casted, well executed, well produced all around.",1256601600,,240,5.857142857142857
7943222,4,B00005KH3R,"I love movies about benigh low-lifes and how they struggle with the real world, as I had to when I was much younger.  I have to recommend this one fairly highly.  It's a subjective thing at this point.",1242950400,,201,4.2631578947368425
7943223,3,B00005KH3R,"Partners, is a low budget, comedy adventure, that features the odd pairing of Casper Van Dien, with David Paymer.  Van Dien is ""Axel"", a drifting pickpocket and petty thief.  Paymer is ""Bob"", a man who has had enough, and won't take it any more.  To prevent his employer from stealing software he developed, Bob has abandoned his wife, and run off, with the program in a briefcase chained to his wrist.  He is on board a bus bound for LA, when the opportunistic Axel, lifts the case.  Soon the two men are ""partners"" in the scheme to sell the valuable contents.
After procuring a car, the two set off for LA.  There, with the help of Bob's beautiful Japanese girlfriend ""Lin"" (Seiko Matsuda), they plan to sell the stolen goods to an Asian buyer.  After hitting town, they settle in at a motel, and begin to make their moves, doubling the selling price for the goods, at the meeting with the Asians.  Axel renews ties with his estranged girlfriend, ""Angel"" (Vanessa Angel), and leaves the valuable briefcase with her for ""safekeeping"".  A detective (Jennifer Lewis) is also hot on Bob's trail, determined to recover the missing software.  With millions at stake, the players scamper to recover the briefcase, arrange an exchange, and then double cross and kill each other.  The open-ended finish is interesting, and Bob does prove that he is not a total nerd.
Not great by any means, Joey Travolta's production is on par with a made for TV movie.  The comedy isn't ""laugh out loud"", and the acting won't win any awards, but Partners is still entertaining, as the offbeat Van Dien/Paymer pairing, works just well enough.  There is brief nudity, but not of the ""angelic"" variety.  This little adventure, with some light comedy thrown in, is worth at least rental consideration.  This feature does not have subtitles.",1029196800,7,1814,4.787781350482315
7943224,2,B00005KH3R,"Action-man Casper Van Dien and Comedy-man Casper Van Dien team up for this moderately funny comedy-adventure, directed by Joey Travolta (yep, that's John's Brother).
Bob (Paymer) is a confused man. The one thing he has going for him is a computer program that he plans to sell to the highest bidder. Before he can even get to the buyer though, a street smart drifter (Van Dien) knocks it off - only to discover that he's not going to get pay dirt without Bob. They team up.
Unbeknown to Bob, the 'potential girlfriend' who has helped him find a buyer for his computer program doesn't exactly half his best interests at heart; the same goes for Van Dien's character's girlfriend, whose one-tracked mind revolved around the green stuff.
Plenty of double crossing, madcap moments and cheesy one-liners in this surprisingly chuckle-worthy film.",1003795200,,840,4.964539007092198
