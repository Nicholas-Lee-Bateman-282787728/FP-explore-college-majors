2956970,5,B000VWX6TO,"I used this video in my Anatomy and Physiology classes for medical assisting students.  They absolutely were riveted by it.  Following the course of the human body from birth to death was not only entertaining and informative, but also moving.  I highly recommend it for anyone with an interest in the subject, and I suspect watching it could be inspiring for those who didn't know they might be interested!",1374710400,,407,4.869565217391305

I didn't rate it a 5- because I think it's a little corky (and my students too)- as far as having animated characters turn into humans at the various stages of life.  But overall, I think it's fantastic overview of the circle of life!",1367798400,,358,4.085714285714285

2956974,2,B000VWX6TO,"I was shocked to find National Geographic - Inside the Living Body was not very scientific.  Many statements were misleading.  I did not find it to be at a level acceptable to show to an undergraduate class.  However,  the film contained many wonderful images.",1360454400,3,260,4.840909090909091
2956975,5,B000VWX6TO,"I teach high school Anatomy & Physiology, and I show this at the end of the year because it covers absolutely everything we talked about throughout the year. It's a neat visual way to show the kids how all the body systems interact with each other. I like saving it for the end of the year because it uses terminology that they have learned, and it makes much more sense to them than it would if I showed it at the beginning.

The video starts out following two parents that have a child, and then you watch the child grow up. You follow the child through the teenage years, adulthood, and finally, to the end of their life as an elderly person. I have to admit that it's sad as it ends in death, but the information covered throughout the video is spectacular and very interesting. Just don't expect the video to end on a happy/feel-good note...you might need to do something to brighten the mood after it is over!!

There are just a few things that you may want to warn your kids about if you are showing this to a class. I teach juniors and seniors, so *most* of them are mature enough to handle the video (although there are always a few that like to snicker and make comments). First, there's some childbirth. You don't see the WHOLE process, but there are some parts that are a little ""gross."" You also see a baby nursing- so you see a woman's breast and the edge of the nipple as the baby is suckling. Again, if you warn kids that these things will be shown, they're much more likely to react to it as it happens. The last part is that you see a lot of digestion from the internal view, so there's a lot of ""glop"" being squeezed around, pushed through sphincters, etc. You're likely to get a few ""eew!"" remarks from the crowd.

It's a great video- very informative, engaging, and accurate. This is something I plan to use each year to wrap up my Anatomy class.",1359331200,6,1867,4.328571428571428
2956976,3,B000VWX6TO,I bought this to use in my classroom.  I liked the first hand view of digestion.  very graphic but it did not really his our curriculum,1358812800,,135,4.153846153846154

2956979,5,B000VWX6TO,"This DVD can serve a multitiude of purposes. I have used it to teach Medical Assistant (MA) students, to answer patient questions about the human body and to enlighten school classes about the body. It shows, using animation and often
very sophisticated internal micro-camera techniques, the growth and development of the body from birth to senility and
death. It does so without using heavy anatomic or physiologic vocabularies and so is easily understood. It is truely an educational voyage
into the body from the beginning to the end of life. I should add it can also be entertaining as,
for example, when it touches on the ""first kiss"" of adolescence.",1356048000,4,655,4.963636363636364

2956982,5,B000VWX6TO,"This video is incredible. The first time I came across it was in a high school science class. It is very thorough and easily describes aspects of the body which we sometimes overlook. It is intriguing and will even engage the most reluctant science student. This is a video for all ages, both male and female. The information provided on the video is helpful and important to all age groups, for it details the human body from birth until old age. I would highly recommend this video to a teacher or anyone who wants to learn more about the human body. Enjoy.",1340064000,,559,4.490196078431373
2956983,5,B000VWX6TO,"I teach middle school science so I bought this dvd to show segments to my students as we study human anatomy/ physiology.  It is perfect for introductory level biology and maybe a little beyond.  The best part was how engaged my students were with this film!  They only saw the segments that pertain to what we are studying, but they actually thanked me for showing it to them, said it was really cool, and wondered when they would get to see more.  WOW.  That is hard to do with 13-14 yr olds, particularly with the demographic I work with.  So, I would definitely recommend this video, especially to entry level biology educators looking to get their students engaged.",1333411200,2,670,4.635593220338983
2956984,5,B000VWX6TO,"This is an excellent video for class.  I have shown it in its entirety over two classes.  There are also excerpts according to certain systems that could be useful.  The images are really amazing.  IMBD will tell you more how they were made.  The stomach, intestinal and salivary gland scenes are particularly amazing.  At the end it is a bit sad, but still well worth showing.",1333065600,,377,4.636363636363637
2956985,5,B000VWX6TO,excellent video. i loved it. my 5 year old loved it. high quality and keeps you interested.

2956986,1,B000VWX6TO,"This video contains very basic body functions with content appropriate for a 12-year-old. This video is all about new camera technology, not about the magic of life. I couldn't finish it and had to skip through what I did watch.  You'll learn nothing as an adult, but your children may find it interesting if you don't mind them watching the close-ups of the vagina as the baby comes through and the graphic, nipple-sucking nourishment scenes.  A puzzle to me.  What are they trying to show?  Cameras inside the body move through tunnels of tissue that leave you WITHOUT a ""Wow, look at that"" feeling as well as the ""I didn't know that"" expectation as you watch the baby grow into an adult.  Extremely boring and without the inspirational advances in medical science that I was expecting.  If you're pregnant, you will probably love it.  If you have an interest in new technology, irregardless of the lack of new information, you'll enjoy that part.  If you're a medical/science junkie, as I am, looking for information, forget it.",1326672000,17,1031,4.818181818181818

2956991,5,B000VWX6TO,"I teach a quarter-long 6th grade health class and I show this the first week of every term. It's a fantastic overview that we can then refer back to as we go more in depth later in the class. This is not a video you'll just want to play straight through for kids. I would suggest watching it a few times first to know where you'll want to fast forward (like one of the first scenes of the live birth), where you want to pause to forewarn kids to avoid upset stomachs or awkward giggles (some digestions scenes, one where a baby is breast feeding, the puberty scenes, and one where a woman's glutes are awkwardly being massaged). It's also good to know where you'll want to insert your own extra info or try to simplify some of the explanations as some things may be too complex for younger viewers to understand. I think anyone high school age or older can get it all pretty easily and I wouldn't recommend for anyone under age 10. Although I understand this is designed for slightly older viewers, it works great even for my middle schoolers since I've now seen is about 50 times and know exactly how I want to use it.",1298592000,25,1119,4.333333333333333

2956999,5,B000VWX6TO,"This biology program is a must have for anyone interested in seeing real footages and microscopic detail such as blood flow and heart valves.  Also, they inserted an arthroscopic camera down the gut.  There's a tad bit amount of computer generated, such as baby's skeleton crawling on the kitchen floor, but overall we're given the real deal, blood, guts, and squirting glands. Yummy if you're not light headed.  It also narrates our body's changes from birth to death in laymen terms.  I highly recommend this video.  It is very interesting, intuitive, and never a dull moment.

Some technical aspects: Running time is in fact 96 minutes, not 60 as Amazon incorrectly lists.  It aspect ratio is letterboxed widescreen; you'll have black bars on BOTH the tops AND the bottoms of your screen.  Not sure why the producers did this, but you can easily correct this to fill your entire screen by hitting the zoom button on your TV.  Don't worry, quality is still maintained, and excellent picture.  Relatively recent release '07, I did wish a blu ray version was available.

3191472,5,B000VWX6TO,"I teach high school Anatomy & Physiology, and I show this at the end of the year because it covers absolutely everything we talked about throughout the year. It's a neat visual way to show the kids how all the body systems interact with each other. I like saving it for the end of the year because it uses terminology that they have learned, and it makes much more sense to them than it would if I showed it at the beginning.

The video starts out following two parents that have a child, and then you watch the child grow up. You follow the child through the teenage years, adulthood, and finally, to the end of their life as an elderly person. I have to admit that it's sad as it ends in death, but the information covered throughout the video is spectacular and very interesting. Just don't expect the video to end on a happy/feel-good note...you might need to do something to brighten the mood after it is over!!

There are just a few things that you may want to warn your kids about if you are showing this to a class. I teach juniors and seniors, so *most* of them are mature enough to handle the video (although there are always a few that like to snicker and make comments). First, there's some childbirth. You don't see the WHOLE process, but there are some parts that are a little ""gross."" You also see a baby nursing- so you see a woman's breast and the edge of the nipple as the baby is suckling. Again, if you warn kids that these things will be shown, they're much more likely to react to it as it happens. The last part is that you see a lot of digestion from the internal view, so there's a lot of ""glop"" being squeezed around, pushed through sphincters, etc. You're likely to get a few ""eew!"" remarks from the crowd.

It's a great video- very informative, engaging, and accurate. This is something I plan to use each year to wrap up my Anatomy class.",1359331200,6,1867,4.328571428571428

death. It does so without using heavy anatomic or physiologic vocabularies and so is easily understood. It is truely an educational voyage

Cameras inside the body move through tunnels of tissue that leave you WITHOUT a ""Wow, look at that"" feeling as well as the ""I didn't know that"" expectation as you watch the baby grow into an adult.

It's a fantastic overview that we can then refer back to as we go more in depth later in the class. This is not a video you'll just want to play straight through for kids. I would suggest watching it a few times first to know where you'll want to fast forward (like one of the first scenes of the live birth), where you want to pause to forewarn kids to avoid upset stomachs or awkward giggles (some digestions scenes, one where a baby is breast feeding, the puberty scenes, and one where a woman's glutes are awkwardly being massaged). It's also good to know where you'll want to insert your own extra info or try to simplify some of the explanations as some things may be too complex for younger viewers to understand.

8220328,2,B000VWX6TO,"I can see how school teachers might like this video, which seems geared toward teenagers.  I did learn a few things, although the DVD also distorts some information, which is problematic.  Is the misinformation bad enough to throw out the whole DVD?  I would not use it myself for teaching because of the distortion.

There is some interesting information about how babies develop, how their senses, skeletons develop.  The high-stress of the first day after birth is well illustrated.

The misinformation has mostly to do with the discussion of women aging.  There is some sort of preoccupation with stating that women supposedly age more rapidly after menopause than men.  This actually makes no sense as men die, on average, 5 years before women (some of this is because of higher mortality in teenage and early adulthood, but there is probably 4 years of this difference in longevity that affects even men who get through those years intact).  I think the DVD confuses the issue of an abrupt decline in hormones in women that occurs at menopause with the longer, slower decline in hormones for men.  Is there an acceleration for women at menopause?  Yes, but it takes place in comparison to a decline for men that starts much earlier.

I also question the claim that presbyopia happens because the eye has fewer tears.  While I am sure it is true that the lens becomes more rigid with aging so that it cannot bend to deal with reading any more after about age 40, I am skeptical that it dries out because of fewer tears being produced, instead the lens becomes rigid with aging regardless of whether a person has dry eyes or not.

I thought the DVD could have done more to illustrate the effects of preventive care, such as maintaining regular level blood pressure and blood sugar levels, mental health hygeine.  This is actually thought to be one of the reasons men die earlier than women, i.e. because women pay more attention to preventive care than men and also the health care systems pays more attention to preventive care in women than men, men accumulate preventable diseases that shorten their lives.

Also, in its discussion of reproductive issues, it could have presented the information about the DNA copying errors accelerating with age in the context of sperm becoming DNA-degraded with age, i.e. to explain how men who have children past the age of 35 are passing along degraded DNA to children.  You could also discuss the issue of eggs aging and increased risk of DNA damage to offspring of women over the age of 35.

The issues with men are still being researched, although there are enough results already that they could have been included in the DVD, while the ones with women are pretty well-known.",1439164800,3,2724,4.796573875802998
