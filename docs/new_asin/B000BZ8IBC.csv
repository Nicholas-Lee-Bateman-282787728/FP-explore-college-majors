I may be an adult, but I know what high quality is, and Winx Club has won my heart!

2449916,4,B000BZ8IBC,"The greatest part of this DVD is that you get to know Bloom's past. Although it's a little sad, which is unusuall for the Winx Club. Kepp up the great work.",1174176000,,156,4.064516129032258

2449918,5,B000BZ8IBC,"My 9 and 12 year old girls watch these episodes over and over again.  It's like ""Harry Potter"" for girls except it's ""good fairies"" battling ""bad witches"".  Other than the skimpy costumes the characters wear sometimes, I have nothing bad to say.  I've watched a few episodes and they have some good lessons to teach.",1168732800,,316,4.709090909090909

8094637,5,B000BZ8IBC,"I loved this series growing up but until recently had forgotten it existed! I am so glad that amazon carries the 4Kids! version I grew up watching and was delighted to rewatch this surprisingly good series (even for an adult like me now). The only thing I don't really like is that there are so few episodes on each disc in each volume. I wish the whole 4Kids American version had a complete set. ***Just to let you know, this disc is indeed the 4Kids series***",1433808000,,461,4.372093023255814

8094642,4,B000BZ8IBC,"I'm a huge fan of the show but I'll try to be impartial. Yes the show is made to sell dolls but the writing shows that the creators care about more then the money. The writing makes the show though the animation styles also helps. Overall the plot is good and engaging despite ""the been there before"" feeling that can creep in if you can't just get sucked in and follow along. If you like other show of this type you know what you're in for. You will actually care about the characters and the challenges they face. I do recommend this show and the fact that there continues to be new seasons etc speaks for itself.",1398729600,,615,4.264957264957265
