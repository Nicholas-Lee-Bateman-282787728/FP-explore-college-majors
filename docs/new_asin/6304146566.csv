7862745,5,6304146566,I am very happy with the DVD and wish there were more like it available. I also ordered the VHS but wasn't as happy with them as my vcr doesn't play them as well and the quality wasn't the same. The content was excellent.,1438387200,,221,4.045454545454546

We made a point to stop and enjoy laughing with  the show every afternoon. Only quit when the  went off the  air.",1422662400,,269,4.196078431372549
7862747,2,6304146566,A flub up bigtime with who put this mess together it  even duplicates same episodes or parts of them and nothing like the title suggests.  Nice to see the old crew again--but look for a differnt submission by a better company--someplace that had a clue what they were doing!,1389225600,,274,4.571428571428571
7862748,2,6304146566,"KUKLA, FRAN AND OLLIE was another of those TV shows that figured prominently in the history of many people. And yet why is this about the only thing available on the market...and in VHS only, not on DVD? The show is a relic of TV's early days and should be marketed for those of us who grew up watching them. They were on TV for more years than many other shows that have made it to DVD. Why not this? Wake up, someone!",1210464000,,419,4.0602409638554215
7862749,4,6304146566,"I was a big fan of KF&O as a kid. I find that I enjoy them as much if not more as an adult.  This video starts out with several of the Kuklapolitan Players (sans Kukla and Deloras Dragon) singing *together* for the first time (for those who don't know, Burr Tillstrom did all the voices and usually all the puppetry as well. He must have been taking advantage of new advances in recording to do this).  The story is reminiscent of A Charlie Brown Christmas, with Ollie bringing home a really ugly little tree that he felt sorry for.  With some help from Beulah Witch, he transforms it into a thing of beauty.

The puppets aren't as advanced as Hensons.  Tillstrom had the gift of making you believe they're real.  Their personalities reel you in and soon you're just enjoying yourself watching these adorable ""kids"" do their stuff.  No violence, sex (except for some passionate kisses between Madame O and Colonel Crackie) or computer generated anything.  Just pure entertainment.",1103414400,8,980,4.723529411764706
