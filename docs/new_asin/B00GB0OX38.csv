6069668,3,B00GB0OX38,"Eli (Alex Wolff) is a 13 year old boy genius who doesn't know the meaning of the word ""haircut."" He goes to Whittman University after being rejected from Harvard. While at Whittman he is befriended by 41 year old Leo (Brendan Fraser) and develops a love interest in a townie high school girl (Julia Garner). Eli has joined the college Mastermind club and competes in intercollegiate intellectual contests, with designs on getting revenge on Harvard.

The film is designed for teens including formulaic cliche writing. There is the college bully and the older girl who wants his baby. At 50 minutes into the film it awkwardly introduces Leo's daughter. Parker Posey fans will be disappointed in her cameo role.

6069669,1,B00GB0OX38,I couldn't stand to look at the main character long enough to watch the film. He grossed me out so bad. There is a fine line between quirky and downright disgusting people. so gross.,1398124800,,182,4.382352941176471
6069670,4,B00GB0OX38,When I first rented this movie I was a little skeptical because I don't normally watch these types of comedies but i actually found it hilarious so i give it 4 stars ! worth watching.,1397606400,,183,4.257142857142857
6069671,1,B00GB0OX38,"Absolutely awful. I'd give it 0 stars if i could. Poor plot, poor acting and the jokes fall flat. Not funny.",1396396800,,108,4.190476190476191
6069672,2,B00GB0OX38,I slept through some of the movie so my sister says I can't feel strongly enough to rate Hair Brained 1 star.  The truth is that I think the producers owe me some money for the time I will never get back.  I could have spent this time watching a mediocre episode of JJ Abram's Believe.  I would not rate this 4 to 5 stars unless someone was paying me to do so....  which makes me very suspicious.,1396310400,,396,4.038461538461538

6069674,5,B00GB0OX38,Delightful story with quirky characters that are not cartoonish but relatable. Love the relationships between the actors and so many of the small moments.,1393891200,,154,5.458333333333333

8621877,3,B00GB0OX38,Okay movie. I watched it because I'm on a Brendan Fraser kick. I didn't like the sexually references directed to the kid because he was only 14 years old.,1526515200,,154,4.344827586206897
8621878,2,B00GB0OX38,"Okay, Parker Posey was in the film ... but BARELY.

She's prominently featured in the credits -- the second name on the credit role -- but that's obviously due to her name recognition. She has about two minutes in this film. Three minutes tops. Posey plays the mother of a kid genius. She drives him partway to college at the film's start. Then she has a brief non-speaking appearance at the very end of the film, going past a supermarket isle. Oh yeah, we also hear her voice on a phone recording midway through the film. That's it for Posey.

I mention this because the only reason I bought this film was because Posey is in it. So I'm disappointed, big time.

The film itself has a very common, very generic story. A disparate group of freaks and losers find redemption by training for a Big Event. It could be a dance contest, sporting event, whatever. In this case, it's a college quiz game. Everything in the film leads up to the Big Quiz Game against Harvard.

This film DRAGGED. The story was unoriginal, but not that bad. But it felt so padded. When I was bored, and felt the film should be nearly over, I checked the time, and I was only 44 minutes into the film. Not even halfway through.

The BAD WRITING also included a stupid ending.

SPOILER ALERT ...

Near the film's end, one of the quiz team's members falls ill. The moderator says they have 3 minutes to find an alternate player to fill in. They do so, and the team wins. But then the Harvard team (which lost) find a rule in the rule book which says that the team should have played with only the remaining member. Having broken the rule, the winning team (our heroes) is now disqualified.

The problem is, the moderator TOLD the team to fine an alternate. The team was given the erroneous rule. Naturally, the team relied on the moderator to know the rules, and followed the erroneous rules. So how can the team be disqualified? And why didn't the moderator know the rules to the event he was moderating? And why didn't any judges intervene and correct the moderator before the rule was broken?

Nit-picky? Well, when you're watching a dull film that just drags, your mind begins to wander, and you start nit-picking over minutia.

My favorite Parker Posey film, BTW, is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clockwatchers/dp/B000B5XP4C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clockwatchers</a>. Check it out.",1496275200,,2404,4.813106796116505

8621880,5,B00GB0OX38,"I'm only giving it 5 stars because I miss Brendan Fraser and I just adore any character he plays. Overall, the drama about the boy and the Harvard thing was a bit lame. I don't get the whole ""hair"" thing. The kid says it's supposed to protect him against stupidity, but that really doesn't explain much. I don't get why he refuses to cut, comb, brush it out? It just doesn't make sense, and it's a bit gross/distracting.",1458950400,,420,4.397435897435898
8621881,2,B00GB0OX38,Truthfully the only reason I bought this movie is because my brother has a small speaking part in it.  Otherwise I probably would have given it 1 star.  This is a really dumb movie that I can't believe Brendan Fraser is even a part of.,1437609600,,235,4.2
8621882,5,B00GB0OX38,Funny movie especially if you live on Staten Island!,1427587200,,52,4.888888888888889
8621883,1,B00GB0OX38,Terrible film. Embarrassed to be in it. But makes sense since the director was a dick. Worst set I've even been on. Nice cast tho.,1406505600,,130,4.24

8621885,3,B00GB0OX38,"It had so much promise--goofy kid genius character, Brendan Fraser, college setting...and then it just rolled away, like a dropped quarter under the vending machine. It had its moments, but on the whole, this story just fell apart after about 30 minutes. I believe Brendan Fraser is really underrated as an actor, but I couldn't buy his character. It seemed like the writing was at fault. It's not the worst thing I've seen, but it could have easily been much more.",1400716800,,465,4.753086419753086
