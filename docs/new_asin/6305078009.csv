If I based it on them I would give it no stars. Great movie with good story and cast, I will be glad when it is finally back in print. I would be very surprised if it isn't re-released on DVD.

959994,5,6305078009,"This film has haunted me since I first saw it in the 70's, to some extent because prior to that, my viewing experience of Holmes was our standard---yet deeply appreciated---Basil Rathbone interpretation.  This fulsome breathing of life into Doyle's Holmes and Watson was a complete delight---Nichol Williamson and Robert Duvall more than do the stories justice.
Since Williamson's Holmes is lost in the throes of cocaine addiction as the story begins, the journey to free him of it carries us forward to Vienna and Dr. Sigmund Freud to aid Holmes in rehab.
Duvall's Watson has since then been my favourite interpretation due to his capturing the essence of Watson's upright, un-bumbling, and throughly splendid character.  Then to add Alan Arkin as Sigmund Freud is a master stroke.  Only Arkin and David Suchet have been able to interpret the much maligned doctor to my satisfaction.  Vannessa Redgrave also does a lovely turn as a fellow sufferer to drug addiction---her absolute trust in Freud is quite poignant.  And last, but not least, Nicol Williamson's Holmes certainly does justice to Holmes' extreme nature, his theatricality, and his extraordinary mind. (Williamson's HAMLET, directed by Tony Richardson, ought not to be missed, either.)
Others have been less than generous about the film's flaws, but it's casting, photography, intriguing storyline far outweigh the nigglers.  It's a beautiful step back into pre-Edwardian Europe (the Queen is still living), and even has an amusing little Stephen Sondheim ditty thrown in when we venture into an upscale Vienese house of ill-repute.
I am utterly appalled that THE SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION is not available on DVD, but hope in the near future that it may be.",1180483200,6,1718,5.206521739130435
959995,5,6305078009,"From the opening to the closing credits, filled with illustrations that originally accompanied Doyle's stories in the Strand, the details of the movie are painstakingly accurate when compared to those in the canon.  This is one non-canonical Holmes story that exists in the same world as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes.

 The movie takes the liberty of assuming that all of Dr. Watson's accounts of Sherlock Holmes are true, except for one.  That would be ""The Final Problem"", in which the great detective supposedly dies at the hands of his arch-enemy Professor Moriarty.  The movie suggests that this story is merely a cover up for a period in time in which Holmes was getting help with his cocaine addiction from none other than famous psychiatrist Sigmund Freud.

 The settings and characters ring true to both Doyle's mysteries and the Sydney Paget illustrations that accompanied them.  Sherlock Holmes' deerstalker and cloak, though never mentioned by Doyle, look more like Paget's illustrations than ever before, more rugged than in most film interpretations.  American actor Robet Duvall, despite sometimes struggling with the British accent, portrays Watson as an intellectually and physically fit comrade for Holmes, not a bumbler.  Laurence Olivier's Prof. Moriarty matches the vision of Doyle and Paget rather than the clich mustache twirler of other movies.  Only now, Moriarty isn't really a criminal mastermind.  He's Holmes' childhood math tutor.

 Alan Arkin depicts Freud as a man of intelligence, insight, and above all, honor.

 The inclusion of lesser known characters like Mycroft Holmes and Toby is a plus.  There are also references, both direct and sly, to canonical Holmes stories.

 While Nicol Williamson's performance as Sherlock Holmes lacks the vigor and spark of Basil Rathbone or Christopher Plummer, Williamson succeeds in showing Holmes as a troubled individual rather than a god.  The movie mixes drama, subtle humor, mystery, and even action, finally showing Holmes as the capable fighter he was in the canon.  The end of the film strays from the books in order to explore the uncharted territory of Holmes' childhood, providing a deeply moving climax.

 This may come truer to Sir Arthur's original vision than any other pastiche written for film so far.",1140220800,24,2302,5.263736263736264
959996,3,6305078009,"""The Seven-Percent Solution"" is the sort of film that's languished in obscurity for decades. Upon viewing the movie again, I can understand why. While the characterizations of both Sigmund Freud and Sherlock Holmes are spot-on, the action sequences and suspense are woefully underdeveloped.

The film (adapted by author Nicholas Meyer from his book) is a literary ""cross-over"" scenario. What if Dr. Freud, father of psychoanalysis, analyzed Britain's most famous detective? This is a fascinating ""What-If?"" starting point, and Meyer finds a clever way to bring the two giants together. Freud affectionados might be a little surprised at the way Alan Arkin portrays the good doctor, but that's because Meyer provides us with a look at the young, rebellious doctor. As shown here, Freud hasn't yet mastered free-association or dream analysis techniques, and is still using hypnotherapy. It's the meeting of the minds between a famous scientist and an equally famous literary detective that makes this film a charmer.

Unfortunately, there's also a half-baked plot involving Turkish kidnappers, Eastern Europeans with heavy gambling debts, and one of the most poorly-filmed fight sequences atop a train in the history of 1970s movies. I can accept Sherlock Holmes dueling with a saber; I can't accept Freud suddenly brandishing a shotgun and threatening several Turks. To be blunt, the plot seems to exist because Meyer tried to make his original idea a bit more commercial. Meyer failed at this, and the silly attempts to generate suspense are most likely the real reason this film isn't seen or heard of anymore.

The only group of people who I can imagine purchasing this DVD are psychology professors. The portrayal of Freud, as mentioned earlier, is uncannily accurate and I believe that it could be used in a classroom to bring the psychoanalyist to life. Casual Holmes fans may want to take a quick peek, but there's little here to draw the viewer in more than once.",1114992000,2,1970,5.15
959997,3,6305078009,"""The Seven-Percent Solution"" refers to Sherlock Holmes's usual cocaine formula, first unveiled in ""The Sign of Four.""  While Holmes cocaine usage, which was legal at the time, never played such a huge role in the original stories, author Nicholas Meyer used it as the basis for his novel on which this film is based.
In this story, Holmes's usage has blossomed into a full-blown addiction, from which he must soon free himself or die.  His friend, Dr. Watson, lures Holmes to Vienna to meet with famed researcher Sigmund Freud who will help break his addiction.  It is an interesting premise, and in theory no more off the mark than Sherlock Holmes's showdown with Jack the Ripper in the excellent film ""Murder by Decree.""  There are some pretty extreme liberties taken with the characters, and hardcore fans might be shockingly disappointed.
As a Holmes story, it is mediocre at best.  The writers do not seem to have the necessary flair for detection that makes Holmes so interesting and invincible, and the threaded mystery and expositions are a bit lame.  The inclusion of practically every character from the Holmes cannon is a distracting as well.  They are all here, Moriarty, Mycroft and even Toby, although they haven't all been cast in their usual roles.  A hodgepodge of everything has been packed in, some without rhyme or reason.  One gets the feeling that the director was not very familiar with the original Sherlock Holmes stories.
As a character study, the film works well, and the scenes with Freud, Watson and Holmes are very enjoyable.  Robert Duvall makes a surprisingly excellent Watson, coming off as far more capable than Nicol Williamson (Merlin in ""Excalibur"") as Sherlock Holmes.  Alan Arkin is also excellent as Sigmund Freud, supplying a steady hand to the shaky addict.  Sir Laurence Olivier peeks in as Professor Moriarty, in a part that is far too small.
All in all, ""The Seven-Percent Solution"" was a quirky film that I enjoyed watching, but I don't feel the need to own. It takes a few too many liberties with the characters, and the mystery is sub-par.  It would have made an excellent 1/2 hour television episode, but is stretched too thin here.",1085356800,10,2181,4.894021739130435
959998,5,6305078009,"It's the only Sherlock Holmes-inspired movie I have ever thoroughly enjoyed. It's funny, intriguing, clever and even romantic. It takes a lot of poetic liberties with the characters, both the fictional (Sherlock & co) and the real ones (Sigmund Freud), but it ennobles and humanizes them, so fans of both can have nothing to complain about.
The movie does something very interesting: Freud psychoanalyzes Sherlock and 'explains' him. If only it was that easy in real life...but you know that you can never walk away with a full proof 'explanation' to the conundrum that is Sherlock Holmes. Still, as the saying goes, if they did not get it right, they have made a very good point.",1070928000,12,680,4.870689655172414
959999,2,6305078009,"The movie itself gets at least four stars, but minus two for the studio for being so purblind as to issue it with a third of the picture lopped off.  Gee, folks, can't you at least give us a choice to watch the entire movie?",1050796800,25,224,3.977777777777778
960000,4,6305078009,"'The Seven Percent Solution' begins as a masterful telling of Detective Sherlock Holmes and his cocaine addiction, as told by Dr. Watson (Robert Duvall).  To help free Holmes from his addiction, Watson seeks the help of Dr. Sigmund Freud (Alan Arkin).  After treatment begins, all three men are hot on the trail of a kidnapper.
The film is really two stories:  Holmes and his cocaine treatment/withdrawl, and the kidnapping.  Holmes' treatment is the more interesting story and is handled more expertly.  All three actors make what begins as the best Holmes/Watson cast ever to hit the screen.  All are excellent, but Robert Duvall really loses himself in the role of Dr. Watson.  Clearly outstanding work.  The nightmare that is Holmes' cocaine addiction is both powerful and gripping.  It's too bad that the kidnapping and chase scenes are nowhere near as interesting or as well done as the other parts of the story.  What would have been the definitive Sherlock Holmes film becomes instead a very good entry into the Holmes/Watson film saga.",1006387200,11,1044,5.017441860465116
960001,4,6305078009,"In my opinion, this is probably the best Sherlock Holmes film ever made, and one of only a couple that ring true as being faithful to the spirit of the original stories.  This is no Hollywood butchery pitting Sherlock Holmes against Jack the Ripper or Dracula, but a truly excellent film.
The story centers around a cocaine-addicted Sherlock Holmes beginning to lose touch with reality, and the effort by Watson to save him from this fate by recruiting the aid of none other than Sigmund Freud.  The three lead actors are thoroughly outstanding.  This is especially true for Robert Duvall as Dr. Watson, who is really the lynch-pin of the film.  It is a pleasure to see Dr. Watson portrayed well (a doctor and accomplished chronicler after all!) instead of nothing more than the stereotypical bumbling oaf.  The story is compelling and entertaining with action and humor in just the right measures.  Tennis, fencing, and high-speed chases (by train)!
I can imagine that some Holmes purist might take exception to film, but I think that this original flight of fancy is far better than anything out of Hollywood based on stories that Conan Doyle did write.  And the film itself even takes a bit of a bow to the Holmes mythos and Doyle's own designs.  I won't give it away, but just listen the last lines in the film as Holmes says goodbye to Watson.
As to the quality of the DVD, however, this one is unexceptional.  Just try to let yourself enjoy this 5-star film and don't get too caught up in the media (still, to be fair, the DVD has too lose a star because of the DVD, even if the film itself is great).
This is an off-beat Sherlock Holmes film that rings true.  If you're looking for pure fare, just the way Doyle wrote it, look for something by the BBC, such as the Jeremy Brett series of the past decade.  If you like this film, try ""They Might Be Giants"" starring George C. Scott.  It, too, is a bit of a 'strange' Sherlock Holmes film that nevertheless seems right.",972604800,53,1974,4.545197740112994
960002,5,6305078009,"This is the best Sherlock Holmes motion picture.
The plot, characters, acting, direction, production are all quite good. Nicholas Meyer wrote the screenplay for this adaptation of his very fine novel which resulted in a  handsomely crafted and very engaging entertainment. Meyer remains faithfull  in spirit to the Canon and takes us on an enjoyable and plausable adventure  that moves along at a good pace. Highly recommended!
I regret to say,  this early Universal DVD is NOT presented in it's theatrical widescreen  ratio. Pan and scan is evident in a few scenes and the images feel  claustrophophic. The sound is mono but I thought it was stereo back in  1976. There are no extras. Neither is this disk 16x9 enhanced.
This film  deserves to be redone and reissued. And please, Universal, redo that cover.  This IS a Sherlock Holmes story. Your theatrical poster art would be  welcome here.
There are substantialy less than a handful of Sherlock  Holmes films on DVD. Why this is so is a mystery. At the very least we  should have Billy Wilder's The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, Christopher  Plummer and James Mason in Murder by Decree, and Basil Rathbone in The  Hound of the Baskervilles.",945043200,33,1197,4.890547263681592

7882126,5,6305078009,"Taking into account my profound appreciation for Jonny Lee Miller, Benedict Cumberbatch and Hugh Laurie - this is my favorite interpretation of the famous private detective.

Long before it became fashionable to enjoy modernist twists to Sir Conan Doyle's creation came this amazing film from Henry Ross and Nicholas Meyer.

Meyer, who also wrote the novel that the screenplay was based on, wanted to really explore the character in a way that had never been done previously - to sleuth the man himself - giving us a much deeper sense of who Sherlock Holmes was beyond the caricature outlined by Watson's embellishments in The Strand. A journalistic exploration of who SH might've been if he wasn't a fictional creation.

Completely engaging, his treatment of the World's Greatest Detective delivered completely unexpected depth and insight into the character. No spoilers - but Meyer's approach certainly explains so much.

We follow Holmes, Watson - and believe it or not - Dr. Sigmund Freud into the twisted mystery of Ms. Lola Devereaux - star of stage and theater; the celebrated beauty of three continents. Sinister forces are intent on taking her from the world and hiding her away into some dark hole. Why? And what secret connection does she have with Holmes himself?

Amongst a cast UK luminaries, including the unparalleled performance of Nicol Williamson as Holmes, there's Robert Duvall as Dr. Watson. He tends to stand out, but in a unfavorable light.

Dealing with the sometimes infuriating inability of a performer to execute a proper accent is a fairly common complaint. But one that I appreciate coming from another island community where dialects are varied, distinct, and invariably butchered by actors. While I don't find his accent particularly grating, since I tend to forgive actors who can't do accents. e.g. Michael Caine. What upset me was that he *constantly* broke character.

One can see how much fun he had doing the role - which is all well and good for Duvall - but it nearly destroyed the staged fantasy that an audience needs in order to truly enjoy a film. Too often his scenes were marred by his barely concealed mirth. Example: As the two doctors speak about the condition of their patient, Freud makes use of the word 'elementary' - look at Duvall - giggling it up. And he does so repeatedly throughout the film. (smh)

Worse, I have a suspicion that, coming off his (then) new found elevation as an A-list star via The Corleone Family, he essentially told Director Ross - what was what - ending scenes by self-proclamation. A re-shoot too difficult for an engorged ego.

Perhaps I'm reading into it. But we've all heard stories of some actors who dictate their involvement - either 'my way' or no way. The diplomatic industry term is ""temperamental"". My term is ""egocentric jackass"".

Still, Duvall's inconsistent performance aside, I consider this one of the finest incarnations of Sir Conan Doyle's creation via celluloid. Original and fresh - this made for an incredibly enjoyable film - one that I have seen more than a two hundred times over my lifetime.",1443139200,,3099,4.953757225433526
7882127,5,6305078009,"This was a delightful, fast-paced movie in which Holmes showed emotion, Freud became a real human being, and Dr. Watson was genuinely likeable.  The action was good and I had the impression the cast was having fun making the movie.",1417219200,,231,4.775

7882131,1,6305078009,"One reviewer called it the best Sherlock Holmes movie ever made. Well, to me, it's the worst ever made. Only the cinematography and the settings are worth a nod. The foreign accents are amateurishly inept and Holmes, never mind the stature of Nicol Williams, is quite miscast.

7882133,4,6305078009,"I own this movie on 12"" laserdisc format. Unfortunately I haven't had the laserdisc player hooked up in a long time. I've always loved this film. Certainly far above average. I only wish Nicol Williamson would have finished the Granada television Holmes series after Jeremy Brett died. That was sort of a fantasy casting idea. He is superb as Holmes in The Seven Percent Solution. And what can you say about Robert Duvall? You know he's up to the task.

The DVD is out of print in the USA as of this writing (August 2009), and it costs an arm and a leg on the used market.

However, if you have a region-free player, I would check the UK amazon site. You can probably get a Region 2 PAL copy of this movie for about $8 plus shipping. It's also been re-released on DVD in Australia (which the site I'm looking at says is also PAL format -- I don't know, I've never bought anything from Australia).

With most DVD players, you can find a little trick with the remote to make it region-free (Google is your friend). Wikipedia's article on ""DVD Region Code"" states, ""Most freeware and open source DVD players, such as VLC, ignore region coding. Most commercial players are locked to a region code, but can be easily changed with software."" Likely you could view it on your computer with VLC player. So, if you're a fan of this movie, and you don't mind a small technical challenge... it is available at reasonable prices. I think I'm going to get the import.

Update 10/2011: I did indeed buy the import, and the picture quality is fine. Since I only watch movies on my computer, it was no problem to convert it to a format that can be played with common software players. The movie appears to have been filmed largely through a gauzy lens -- i.e. the focus is soft, there is not a lot of detail. I don't believe it is a flaw in the mastering of the DVD. That's just the way the original film looks. I'm very glad I bought this from amazon.uk, as it is one of my favorite films, the best non-canonical Holmes ever done.",1249948800,9,2015,4.394101876675603
