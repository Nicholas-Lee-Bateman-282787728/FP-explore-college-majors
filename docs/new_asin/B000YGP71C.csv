8232714,5,B000YGP71C,I saw this mini series on TV and was dying to watch it again so I had to buy it and I do not regret it.,1334534400,,103,3.0
8232715,5,B000YGP71C,"Great mini series created by Jennifer Lopez. Although it states any events in this short film reflecting real life events are coincidence, it is obvious it was biographically inspired.",1331596800,,184,5.379310344827586
8232716,5,B000YGP71C,"I guess it's great to say that I am not the only one who thought this mini series was a bit about Jennifer's life. Many people felt it somehow showed what she went through being in love and all. But she once said her self that when you do projects you can't help but inject you're personal life into them and make them a bit personal. The novela title ""Como Ama Una Mujer"" is totally named after Jennifer Lopez's first spanish album ever and the song as well. I thought that was a very great idea considering she said that the album and the songs tell a story. In deed, that spanish album went to sell over a million copies and counting! I was so excited it was such a success. Now on to this novela, I thought the story told important lesson's about how high you can go while sometimes people around you get jealous and envy you. It also told about love and loss and happiness and true love all while jammed with drama and sadness. I thought Jennifer did an excellent job producing this novela. As I said before, sometimes there are these little things that make it seem like she went through this but I guess you will have to be the judge of that. I give this project five stars!! Keep in mind, this was a mini series so it was intended to be short :)",1214438400,,1253,4.203319502074689
8232717,4,B000YGP71C,"The novela is based on Jennifer Lopez' Spanish song, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Como-Ama-una-Mujer/dp/B000N3SS80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Como Ama una Mujer</a>"".
First, the song is amazing; the acting is pretty good but, the story is not very original. Of course, there are no similarities whatsoever between Jennifer Lopez' life and this mini-series (insert cynical eye-roll here). Joking aside, the series is very (extremely) reminiscent of Jennifer Lpez' life plus a little bit of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bodyguard-Special-Edition/dp/B0006N2EZ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bodyguard (Special Edition)</a>"" thrown in the mix (namely the stalker and the bitter assistant).

I was quickly drawn into the story and was happily surprised by Leonor Varela's performance. You may remember Leonor Varela from her performance in the ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cleopatra/dp/B00005OW0D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cleopatra</a>"" miniseries. Rebecca Jones and Roco Verdejo also did a good job.

The series plainly showcases Jennifer Lpez and there is a lot of product placement (way too obvious) but, it is good, entertaining.

The novela tells the story of a famous singer and actress who is trying to find true love; in this case is trying to decide between two men-child. Both Diego (Ral Mndez) and Andrs (Christin de la Fuente) play the most self-absorbed, egocentric and selfish men ever. By the third episode I was wishing she would just stay alone and move on without them.

Although the mini-series lasts four hours, I found that the story was hurried and not well-developed. It shows a immature work that hurries to tell a story without really digging in. The characters actions did not seem to go with the story. Everyone tells Sofa that she is the most selfish person ever (and at one point she thinks so herself) and yet, we see her as the only one really giving herself to the one she loves. Diego is constantly questioning her love for him and can't seem to outgrow his childish jealousy outbursts. And Andrs is in self-wallowing misery, blaming everyone but himself.

This DVD has no Special Features whatsover and yes, no subtitles.",1202774400,,2283,5.948170731707317
