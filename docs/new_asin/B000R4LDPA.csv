8198818,5,B000R4LDPA,"This is a black and white production so don't expect great quality.  In fact, the picutre has that bleached look at times.  In spite of the visual imperfections, this game is still very enjoyable to watch.  We should be grateful to the NCAA for releasing this gem before the picture quality suffered further degradation.

In this game you'll see the legendary 1967 UCLA team.  At the time, Lew Alcindor was a precocious sophomore leading his team to the first of three straight national championships. This was a highly anticipated season.  The previous year, the Alcindor-led frosh team had beaten the varsity squad in a scrimmage.  The vanquished varsity team was the defending national champion.

A must have if you're a fan of classic sports.",1200614400,3,746,4.959677419354839
