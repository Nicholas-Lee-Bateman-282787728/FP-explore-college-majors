5731452,5,B00COGDHYE,"This is a great addition to Tracey's Booty Barre workouts.  Like the title says, it is strongly ballet based with Booty Barre moves incorporated to add that Pilates feel to it (Can't forget Booty Hips and pelvic tucks).  I have Tracey's BB Total New Body and BB Plus and agree with Tracey's review that this is an intermediate workout.  Her Total New Body and Plus are more advanced.  She does not work the legs nor the arms to AS MUCH fatigue in this DVD.  It is definitely challenging, but you will not be shaking throughout the entire DVD.  I am simply comparing this to the other two DVDs.  The moves are also completely different, more flowing.
Like it says on the cover, there are 4 workouts to choose from or you can do the entire DVD (about 87 minutes long).  There is a 10 minute warm-up that reminds me of center floor work in a ballet class. In my opinion, Workout 3 is the most challenging as the legs and butt are pretty tired by this point (if you do the whole DVD).  Lots of pulses in this section.  Workout 4 is also pretty challenging for the abs (no barre in this section) .  I say this because she does a lot of planks, which can be tiring on the shoulder joint, but boy do they work!  Love how she incorporates a ball into the abs section.  Workout 1 is great in that she works 1 arm at a time as well as the legs, but the legs arn't worked to fatigue in this section, its arm based.  Workout 2 is the fun, fluid ballet-type movements!  I would rate Workouts 1 and 2 as beginner/intermediate as you get to stretch the legs and Workouts 3 and 4 as intermediate/advanced as you don't get as much rest from the pulses and planks. Plus, you are more tired by this point if doing the whole DVD.  Very quad focused.
Tracey is a fabulous instructor, lovely voice and accurate cuing.  Encouraging.  She also includes an actual ballet dancer in this workout, Logan, as well as her beautiful side-kick, Erica.  Also wonderful to show options.  Like Tracey says on the backside of her Total New Body DVD, once you try Booty Barre, it will change the way you workout forever.  That is the truth at least for me!  Very effective workouts with quick results.",1371772800,33,2164,4.3575
5731453,5,B00COGDHYE,"I really loved this workout, it is fun, cueing excellent, and I left it feeling worked head to toe but not done. You do not need dance experience to do this workout, the petite allegro sections are easy to follow. Tracey Mallet delivers again! Tracey Mallet delivers again!",1370563200,11,273,4.708333333333333
5731454,5,B00COGDHYE,I am in love with barre clases... I try to go to the studio 2 times per week... But this dvd is amazing...i sweat a lot and its the moves like in the studio...,1440979200,2,159,3.7058823529411766

5731458,5,B00COGDHYE,i love doing this workout . Love Tracey !,1412899200,3,41,3.6666666666666665
5731459,5,B00COGDHYE,Love these short workouts.  They are perfect for when you are short on time and need to fit something in.,1410652800,2,105,4.25
5731460,5,B00COGDHYE,I'm impressed with this video.  As a former dancer (to college years) I feel it keeps the gracefulness of ballet while still incorporating strength exercises.,1408060800,6,158,5.32
5731461,5,B00COGDHYE,"This DVD is so much fun you don't even realize your working your booty off (or up!) ! It really feels like you are dancing. I love how Tracey divides her sections into quick workouts that you can fit in here and there or do all together.
As a busy mom of two toddlers I find that somedays I can fit in a good hour to work out and other days I might only be able to fit in a section or 2 in between all the diapers, spills, meals and cuddles!
And believe me, you still get results on those days you could only fit in a section or 2!

5731462,5,B00COGDHYE,She makes you sweat! I'm not as sore as with other workouts but great for cardio and balance. Plus she is fun--- a really great instructor who is easy to follow and fun enough to keep my attention.,1396915200,,197,4.2105263157894735
5731463,5,B00COGDHYE,"I gave this a 5 star rating because it works!!!! You will sweat  and feel the burn just on the warm up LOL. I use the arm and legs and the thighs and abs. LOVE IT!!!! This is the best workout yet!!  I highly recommend this workout, however, if you are a beginner go with the beginner dvd workout. I choose this one because I consider myself intermediate however, this workout is truly challenging and works every muscle. I felt the burn in muscles I didn't know I had. Great workout!!You won't be disappointed with this dvd!!!! Clear and concise directions and the workouts are only 13-28 minutes long depending on which one you choose. Perfect for the girl or guy on the go.",1388880000,7,675,4.435483870967742
5731464,5,B00COGDHYE,"This is probably my favorite of the Booty Barre's now. Still the trademark Booty Barre workout but with some added fun dance ballet moves. This one really challenges me and on the 3rd time I could do this all the way thru without pausing.  If you are new to Booty Barre I would definitely try the Beginner's one first or New Body if you haven't got them. It's over an hour but you can break this up into sections if you are pushed for time which is great about the Booty Barre DVD's is that they are in chapters per body part or just 'Play All'. It is very fluid and they show some modifications for those a bit more advanced or less advanced. You don't have to be a dancer or know barre really well as Tracey is great at telling you what to you, how to hold yourself, your form/posture etc. Very upbeat, not a boring DVD. You will not be disappointed on this Booty Barre with a slight twist. Its fun. Tracey really knows her stuff!",1388534400,5,932,4.206703910614525
5731465,5,B00COGDHYE,"I am in love with this dvd.  I recently found out about Tracey Mallett who apparently has been around and is very famous for her exercise techniques.

This workout is about 85 minutes long and is remarkable.  Tracey Mallett has a unique approach to keeping the audience interested and motivated in this long workout of many repetitions that involve being on the ball of your feet most times. I am absolutely in love with this dvd.

I use this workout in place of my cardio workouts and it really helps build my muscles for other exercises I do, and it has made a great difference in my strength. I recently tested this dvd for 3 consecutive weeks at 2x a week, to see if I could get the results I wanted, and it worked.  Although I was also using Mary Helen Bowers dvds, I wanted to try something different.  I cannot say enough about Tracey's BootyBarre Ballet dvd, other than you will have to try it to believe it.  I am definitely buying more of her dvds to continue to build and strengthen muslce groups.  But of course, Mary Helen Bowers is equally as great.",1384300800,4,1063,4.415384615384616
5731466,5,B00COGDHYE,Love it! Booty Barre Ballet is a Great workout and it's a lot of fun... Makes you want to do daily.,1378944000,2,99,3.761904761904762
5731467,5,B00COGDHYE,"This workout is fun,original and has a great flow! As a former dancer I am always wary of ""ballet workouts"" because they are either too hard for someone with no dance training or they aren't taught well. NOt so with this workout! You get to do the same movements dancers would do in class but they are taught in such a way that anyone can do it! I love doing the swan lake arms in the warm up and the petit allegro! There is so much good stuff packed in to this video I will do it again and again and not get bored! Also,Tracey's personality is infectious when I work out with her!",1378080000,7,581,4.105263157894737
5731468,5,B00COGDHYE,"As someone who is a Booty Barre fanatic, have all the dvds, and take the classes, I have to say, this one is my favorite!  I'm a former dancer, and the ballet spin on things not only brings back some fond memories, it kicks my butt!  It has petit allegro (little jumps) that are not done in any other dvd, so the cardio is more intense than most.  You have the option of breaking it down in sections, or doing the full thing (which is not an easy task).  I have to highly recommend this one!  Love The Booty Barre!",1377216000,11,514,4.1
5731469,5,B00COGDHYE,"If you love all of Tracey's workout DVDs, you will not be disappointed with this amazing workout! The ballet inspired workout is challenging, but thanks to Tracey's instruction, the DVD is easy to follow. Traceys' Booty Barre Ballet DVD is true to the original Booty Barre technique adding a ton of new, challenging and fun combination of exercises that will make you work HARD. This DVD is a great addition to all of Tracey's Booty Barre DVDs! I highly recommend it!",1377043200,8,467,4.777777777777778
5731470,5,B00COGDHYE,She's an outstanding and motivating instructor and I loved this workout from start to finish!  I also enjoyed the fact that she showed modifications during the workout for when it got too intense..and she does have very tough and challenging workouts!  But they work and I highly reccomend her to everyone!,1377043200,6,306,4.980392156862745
5731471,5,B00COGDHYE,"Tracey mallet dvd's are new to me. I purchased two and absolutely love them. Especially the ones with the mini workouts, they are great to do in the morning. She is perky but not annoying and you feel the burn. I have many workout DVD's but, now I am a fan of the booty barre series. You won't regret it.",1376611200,5,304,4.083333333333333
5731472,1,B00COGDHYE,"then you have this one.  This DVD is pretty much the same as all the rest of her booty-themed DVDs.  There may be a different ""nuance"" here and there, but who wants to pay almost $20 for a couple of different adjustments to the same routine from prior DVDs?

Also, the title says ""ballet"", but if you're looking for a DVD that actually has ballet-styled music, again, do not buy this DVD.  The music is as close to ballet music as rap music is.  You get the picture.",1376438400,11,466,4.25
5731473,5,B00COGDHYE,"Love this video as I felt my muscles working and loved the pace. It was perfect for me as I could pick a segment when needed or pick a couple if I had more time. I was sweating buckets so I feel very refreshed. I enjoy that I can make so many different workouts from just one DVD. Don't worry of you are not a dancers as this can be for non-dancers and a person modifying the workout.
Tracey was her upbeat, energetic self that you have to adore and be inspired by.",1373932800,2,465,4.010752688172043

8583961,5,B00COGDHYE,"Killer workout... this gal is hardcore. But I won't do a workout unless its hard so I like it. I can only do about 2 sections at a time. I have yet to make it through the entire workout at once, but it's great for when you have only 10 mins and you want to turn your legs to jelly.",1521849600,,281,3.7

Let me say that this is my 10th--yes 10th--Tracey DVD since I just love her and had to add it to my collection. It did not disappoint! As with all of her workouts, she works the entire body.  I never feel cheated and I enjoy doing them...albeit the sweating, shaking, etc.",1497398400,,344,4.375
8583964,4,B00COGDHYE,"Great video! I lost inches off my hips and thigh areas. Great music I think, not boring. It is a little hard at first to get used to. Looked easy but you can definitely feel it after the next day!",1497398400,,196,3.925

8583968,3,B00COGDHYE,"I have Total New Body and think that this one is actually a bit harder than Total New Body. I consider it to be an advanced workout. In addition, you need a small ball for this workout, which I did not have so I could not do it. Also, a major portion of the DVD required lots of jumps. I prefer to protect my knees. There was a modification for this jumping section, but I didn't feel like I was able to get out of it what I wanted to. I will be returning it because I prefer the one I already have.",1458000000,5,499,3.854368932038835
