8651788,5,B00JKJWUS2,These are the cartoons that are pretty much banned from TV because of the racial tension that was displayed. I love these cartoons regardless and Im glad I now can add them to the rest of my cartoon collection.,1530230400,,210,4.410256410256411
8651789,5,B00JKJWUS2,"Tom & Jerry Originals, Nuff Said. I noticed that there are not any Episodes lists of these DVD's anywhere on the internet so I will post them here. Just click the picture.",1515628800,,171,4.375
8651790,4,B00JKJWUS2,"The collection has all the cartoons from part's 2 and 3. While not much has changed, it is helpful for people who don't own any of the Tom and Jerry series yet.",1409529600,,160,4.03125
8651791,2,B00JKJWUS2,"Of course this is a double dip of both volumes 2 and 3 of Tom & Jerry Spotlight Collection as a double feature DVD collection. But I don't recommend it to anyone at all. And don't expect a replacement disc from vol. 3, it's still the same discs containing the edited version of His Mouse Friday (1951) and the incorrect aspect ratio for Pup On A Picnic (1954). And it's still missing the 2 cartoons that were omitted due to black stereotypes (Mouse Cleaning and Casanova Cat). Stay away from this at all cost!

I guess the reason why they're releasing this is because vol. 1 is the only volume in the series that is still in stores (I always see copies of that volume at my local Wal-Mart). The last 2 volumes sold separately are very hard to find outside of the internet.",1397433600,6,772,4.361111111111111
