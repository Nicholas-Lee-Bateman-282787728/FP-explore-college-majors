7964410,3,B000068MAG,Informative in a very boring way.  This is very school-like.  It is not enjoyable.,1453334400,,82,4.785714285714286
7964411,1,B000068MAG,"AWFUL!  Don't waste your money!
Rambling and and disorganized!
Horrible cinematography, especially the black and white
zooming closeups of the brain damaged raconteur.
Photographer must have hated this guy, as the extreme closeups
of his ugly right eye made this unwatchable.
Not many crop circles.
The REAL Warning!? Don't buy this!!!",1428796800,,335,5.568627450980392
7964412,1,B000068MAG,"Lots of interesting photos of crop designs, but only vapid blathering about their likely origin, with far too much time wasted on possible extra-terrestrial explanations.

Other sources are more illuminating. They tell us that documented cases have substantially increased in recent decades, many in southern England position near ancient sites such as Stonehenge. Another interesting correlation - recent media  coverage, and the absence of fencing. Some pranksters have confessed, and demonstrated how these were done. The more modern formations are believed to have been made with help of GPS and lasers. According to scientific writer Matt Ridley, many involved in the field make a good living from selling books and making personal tours - thus, they have a vested interest in perpetuating paranormal nonsense.

Bottom-Line: Very boring.",1378512000,,842,5.6141732283464565
7964413,5,B000068MAG,I bought several of these after the first one and have handed some out to friends and family.  This is a very good collection of data and photos.  Whatch it more than once!,1327881600,,172,4.181818181818182
7964414,5,B000068MAG,I have bought a few of these.  Others see it and LOVE it and want to buy mine off me.  LOL  This is very good information.  I wish there were more DVDs like this.,1235779200,,162,3.676470588235294
7964415,3,B000068MAG,"A documentary about crop cirles around the world with interviews with the experts and eyewitness accounts. Also it covers ancient sites such as Stonehenge and the Pyramids and there connection with this amazing phenomena.
Transfer 3/5
Audio 3/5
Extras 1/5
Bonus material is a 12 minute interview featurette which they couldn't fit into the program. Transfer is good but the audio on this is out of sync by about a second which is very annoying to watch, I am amazed how this got through there quality control.",1031356800,6,509,4.862068965517241
