8465603,5,B005CKILCW,This was a great addition to our homeschool curriculum which recently covered the War of 1812 and noted Tecumseh's role.,1490313600,,120,5.05
8465604,4,B005CKILCW,I enjoy good films about history and the Indian Nation.  Not bad at all.,1478822400,,72,4.142857142857143
8465605,1,B005CKILCW,This was associated on a Netflix page as an East German film of the same title. It isn't. It's a TV documentary on the same subject. I was looking for the East German film not the documentary.,1455580800,,192,4.216216216216216
8465606,5,B005CKILCW,Great telling of the story of the Great Man.,1428796800,,44,4.0
8465607,1,B005CKILCW,The vhs to dvd reproduction was not very good so it made watching the documentary difficult.  Also I thought I was buying the movie Tecumseh when in fact this was a documentary and a very short one at that.,1420934400,2,206,4.282051282051282
8465608,4,B005CKILCW,cool indian history,1412812800,,19,5.666666666666667
8465609,3,B005CKILCW,"While the film contains some good info, there are also some factual errors and glaring omissions of important details of Tecumseh's life, motivations, and actions. The best parts of this were the footage taken from the longer documentary, ""We Shall Remain: Tecumseh's Vision,"" which I would recommend for anyone who wants a more in-depth look at this topic.",1388793600,,357,5.172413793103448
8465610,4,B005CKILCW,This is a good overview of the Indian's life.  My 11 year old watched it to collect more information for a report and it kept her attention and told her a couple of things she had not read like there are at least 3 cities named after Tecumseh.  I would have liked more info about his early life and the background of his parents. Overall a good short video.,1364256000,2,357,4.159420289855072
