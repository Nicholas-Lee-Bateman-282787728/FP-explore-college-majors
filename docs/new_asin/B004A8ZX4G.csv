4296936,2,B004A8ZX4G,"When you think of milking an animated film franchise for all it's worth, usually DreamWorks comes to mind with properties like Shrek; that started out so original and comical but ended up feeling thin and worn out.  Sony usually manages to duck the gun on such allegations because of the fact that they have such a smaller computer generated library in comparison but if the Open Season series is any indication, perhaps the finger need be pointed in their direction as well.

The funny thing, to me anyway, is that the first Open Season (2006) was an entirely run-of-the-mill affair that did its best to hang with the likes of similar ""talking animal"" CG pieces like the Madagascar(s), Over the Hedge, The Wild and so on.  The visuals were passable (but never astounding), the plot decent (but nothing overly clever) and the characters, ah yes, the characters were pretty darn good.  A lot of this credit is undoubtedly due to the casting choices: Martin Lawrence as the house-broken grizzly Boog, Ashton Kutcher as the obnoxious deer sidekick Eliot, Gary Sinise as the redneck hunter Shaw, and Debra Messing as Boog's caretaker Beth.  In short good characters managed to overcome the limitations of the plot structure and the humor found therein was genuinely appealing.

Then came the sequel.  2008's Open Season 2 was much, much weaker by comparison.  Sony opted for a second rate cast, presumably to keep the budget down, bypassed the theatrical route (direct-to-dvd), and pretty much cut every corner possible in the production process.  It had a little bit of residual charm but it was quite clear that Sony was simply capitalizing on the names/ appeal of the original.

Enter 2010's Open Season 3.  How anyone could have figured replacing the B-list cast of the second film with a strictly C-list cast, cutting down the visuals budget and stretching the already paper-thin premise even further could result in anything short of disastrous is anybody's guess.  And disastrous it is!

This time Boog gets stiffed by all of his friends on an annual ""guys only"" retreat and ends up trading places with a devious grizzly in the Russian circus.  I wish to stretch this synopsis into a full paragraph, but no exaggeration: that's about it.  Perhaps I should also add that the domesticated cast (the dogs and cats) finds out that Boog's in the circus and rally to mount a rescue attempt but this is it boys and girls...  Modern story telling at its finest.

The show's production crew must have known that they had virtually nothing to work with here as indicated by the decision to revisit gags done to death the first two times around.  Prepare for more abused rabbits, trashing of the mini-mart, and bad puns with Mr. Weenie's misguided family structure.  Further taking away whatever attempts at honest humor that the first film established, Open Season 3 makes the move to slap stick scenes complete with ""cartoon"" sound effects seemingly copied and pasted directly from Loony Toons.

The pacing is abysmal but then again re-read my plot synopsis and then try to stretch that across 75-minutes.  Naturally scenes are going to meander around relying upon clich&eacute;s, bad puns and sorry gags to keep young viewers involved.  Adults will often find themselves involuntarily cringing at the onscreen floundering.

Perhaps this would simply be considered a substandard affair if not for the fact that it completely desiccates what little charm remained of its characters after their second outing.  Formerly 3-dimensional characters are reduced to their absolute lowest denominator this time around: The once goofy but innocent Eliot has been condensed to a blathering moron, the antagonist Toy Poodle Fifi returns short a couple gonads with a whole bunch of neutering gags, and even the ever-chuckle-inducing Patrick Warburton (David Puddy of Seinfeld fame) has been axed as the overly-buff deer Ian.

In all this is a sad display of what happens when a corporation discovers that one of their franchises has earned a place in pop-culture strong enough succeed by namesake alone then decides to exploit it for all its worth.  This one may be passable to very young viewers or individuals easily amused by simple visual gags but everyone else (especially fans of the original film) will undoubtedly be left wanting their 75-minutes back.",1296691200,2,4341,5.019525801952581

4296938,1,B004A8ZX4G,"We enjoyed Open Season 1 & 2, accepting that Open Season 2 was not voiced by the original actors but still quite enjoyable. Open Season 3 had no redeeming features. The story might have been enjoyable but the voice acting was so horrible we couldn't finish watching the movie. Do not buy this movie, if you must see it, wait for it to be brought to t.v.",1296345600,17,353,4.2835820895522385
4296939,3,B004A8ZX4G,"The story line was just okay, but the animation looks fantastic on Bluray.  Also my kids loved the ""bunny splat"" mode on the disc.  You can throw bunnies at the screen throughout the movie using our PS3 controller.  The combo pack falls really short because there was no ""digital copy"" included.  The studios have to understand this should be a standard for combo packs, charge $5 more, but include the digital copy!  Also amazing to see actor like Matthew Taylor monitoring and responding to the fan via Amazon feedback.  Power to the people!!",1296345600,3,544,4.795698924731183

When Boog finds a traveling circus full of bears he thinks he found the perfect place, until he learns they will be going back to Russia.  When his friends find out they go on a rescue mission led be Elliot (Voice of McHale).  I was not a big fan of Open Season 1 and never saw Open Season 2, but I really liked this one.  It was made for kids, but had enough jokes in it to keep me entertained and laughing with them.  Not really alot to review here as it is a kids movie, but I will say its fun for the whole family.  I give it a B.  My kids give it a B+.",1295740800,3,648,3.7205882352941178

4297753,5,B004A8ZX4G,This is a nice addition to the Open Season series.  The kids love it.  We haven't been disappointed with our purchase.,1355443200,,118,4.571428571428571
4297754,5,B004A8ZX4G,I will say I will have to keep buyingcopues of this movie as ling as I gave young grandchildren. They watch them over and over until they just won't play anymore.,1355011200,,162,4.258064516129032
4297755,5,B004A8ZX4G,My kids loved getting this for Christmas. It gives us more choices for our family movie nights. Will be looking for more movies soon.,1346198400,,133,4.583333333333333
4297756,4,B004A8ZX4G,We have Open Season 1 and then ordered 2 and 3.  We figured it would be fun to see how they continued the story-and we were quite entertained.  I think the Grandsons liked it too!,1340064000,,179,4.085714285714285
4297757,3,B004A8ZX4G,"My kids, ages 5 and 7, were entertained by this, as with the first two movies, but as with many sequels, the characters are getting old, the gags repetitive, and the storylines uninspired, so it's not one I see us watching over and over. This one mostly centers around Boog the bear, who trades places with a trained grizzly in a circus in order to woo the girl bear working there too. Meanwhile, the bear he trades with tries to turn Boog's friends, including Elliot the mule deer, into servants. Once they figure out he is not the real Boog, they seek to rescue Boog. The wacky RV-driving couple with all the dogs make comic appearances too, as the dogs realize Boog needs help. Lots of silliness, OK voice-talent, and OK animation make this fine for the kids. But as I said, nothing too inspired and certainly nothing very interesting for adults, so this is probably a 1-time film.",1337040000,,884,4.566037735849057
4297758,2,B004A8ZX4G,"Open season one was a great movie. Number 2 was pretty decent, but this one just kind of sucked. It had a few funny parts, but I am ready for Lawrence and Kutcher to return, enough of the sound alikes!",1336867200,,201,4.05
4297759,5,B004A8ZX4G,I liked the story line and the voice talents weren't bad either really enjoyed it I don't really understand what the other peoples issues are with the movie maybe they think their too grownup and thats why they don't appreciate this movie but id recomend this one for the whole family and the first two.,1331596800,,303,4.527272727272727
4297760,3,B004A8ZX4G,"I didn't like voice acting and I didn't like some of the new characters. There were a few funny moments and the story was O.K. Not a too special cartoon, but it was all right to see it one time.",1330214400,,194,3.875
4297761,5,B004A8ZX4G,"This was a cute, funny movie that the whole family can enjoy.  We have all 3 Open Season Movies and each one is pretty good family entertainment.  I would recommend this movie to those with or without children.",1324166400,,210,4.5
4297762,2,B004A8ZX4G,"We loved the first two open season movies so we ordered this one even though it got negative reviews. Well,
the reviews were right. Boring, boring, boring. Oh well!!",1320364800,,165,4.724137931034483
4297852,5,B004A8ZX4G,"Many times sequels, especially multiple sequels, are not as good as the original.  This one was at least as good as the original, and maybe better.  The characters, especially Boog, are more developed, and if you have seen the first and second movies, you will really enjoy this one.",1316649600,,283,4.755102040816326
4297853,2,B004A8ZX4G,"While we have watched both Open Season and Open Season 2 several times, I doubt we will watch Open Season 3 again.  While it may work OK for the 12 and under crowd, most others will be disappointed by the voices and animation.  The story never got any traction, and had no depth.  Could I sum it up by saying we watched it, but we were looking forward to the ending so we could go to bed?  There were a few laugh out loud moments, but gags were poorly written or overdone.  One of the high points is Roger, the ""dumb"" cat.  We would have liked to have seen more of him.  This movie was watched by a 9, 11, and a 13 year old, as well as two adults.  It may be worth renting, but wait till it is cheap if you are going to buy it.  We actually hope for a 4th version, with some more time and effort, and more Roger the cat.",1313971200,,820,3.891566265060241
4297854,2,B004A8ZX4G,"This suffers the same fate as the Smokey and The Bandit franchise...good first movie, fair second one, and painful to watch 3rd installment.  I tried, I really tried for the sake of my kids who were watching with me but there is just nothing at all satisfying about this effort.  Dull from start to finish and my time was wasted.",1309651200,,329,4.466666666666667

They loved Mr. Weenie, and us grown-ups were delighted to have Crispin Hellion Glover as Fifi, the reformed toy poodle, proving Glover is still one the most far-out actors on the planet, and has certainly filled his father Danny's boots well.

4297903,1,B004A8ZX4G,"Light years below the first two films in writing, directing and character developement.  The movie was filled with holes in the plot that even my 9 y/o could see through.  She thought it was funny in some places, but even then, most of the obvious set-ups for jokes where not funny and there where several mis-fires.  She hated the spitting Llama who just plain drools and slobbers.  Combined the slobbbering with his ""South American"" accent and it is hard to understand what he is saying most of the time.  Elliot the deer is, by virtue of the story, a non-existant factor and the chemistry between him and Boog the bear that helped make the others successful is completely gone.  The dialogue is meandering and forced.  Don't waste your money.  Rent it or wait for it to come out on television.",1299369600,4,796,4.635714285714286

4297906,5,B004A8ZX4G,"This was a much better sequeal than most movies, especially being a third installment. It shows true friendship and is appropiate for children. It has some off humor but other than that it's really cute.

Would have liked more Elliot and the rest of the gang.",1298505600,,420,4.397435897435898
4297907,5,B004A8ZX4G,this third installment of open season is pretty good. i do agree that it is not as good as the first two. The story was okay and everything.

4297908,4,B004A8ZX4G,"I liked this movie, and my granddaughter really likes all 3 of these. And, she shows no preference of the three.
So what, if it's not the ""big name"" voices. It isn't the names that get my attention. They're overpaid, anyway.
I often wonder how many reviewers actually watch the entire movie, and pay attention to what is going on. I often find something funny, or just hear a few words that make me chuckle, the second time watching. This can cause a scene to have a totally different meaning.
All in all, this may not have been quite as good as the original, but still a good movie. It was almost a week(from the day it was on the shelf) before I found this movie(one copy of 20+) in stock, at the local video store.",1297382400,,717,4.279411764705882

8419744,5,B004A8ZX4G,"Open Season 3 is a SUPER fun, cute, and lighthearted movie. In this film, Boog feels ignored by his friends because they're too busy to go on ''guys trip'' with him, so Boog decides to have a trip by himself. While he's alone, Boog arrives at a circus, where he meets another Grizzly bear named Doug, and a hilarious llama named Alistair. Doug is a bit of a bully, but in a very lighthearted way, and he's quite funny. They switch places, and Doug tricks Boog by saying that he will be back later on to help him get out. At first Boog is upset, but then he starts to fall in love with a female Grizzly bear named Ursa.

When Doug gets to the forest, he bullies the animals by ordering them around. They rub his feet, feed him, and fan him. But his disguise quickly gets discovered, and they all turn on Doug. The rest of the film involves all of Boog's friends going to the circus to rescue him, with hilarious results along the way.

This movie has a HUGE cast of characters, and it's very enjoyable. Some parts had me laughing out loud, and I got a kick out of the adult jokes they put in. Also, Matthew J. Munn does a WONDERFUL job voicing Boog and Doug.

This is a very fun movie, and I highly recommend it.",1492905600,,1211,4.1888412017167385
