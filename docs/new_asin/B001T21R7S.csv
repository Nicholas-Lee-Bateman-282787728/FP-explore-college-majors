8340349,5,B001T21R7S,My Family is one of those British comedies that's funny EVERY TIME YOU SEE IT!  Every character brings a smile!,1266105600,,111,4.55
8340350,5,B001T21R7S,My Family is a brilliant comedy with an insanely great cast. It's a marvel to me that more people aren't raving about it. And it's a tragedy that so few seasons were filmed. Watch them all!,1265932800,,189,4.277777777777778
8340351,5,B001T21R7S,"If you are browsing for a funny sitcom with great characters, My Family is a very good choice.  This is a husband and wife team who you would think have to be married in real life.  They and their kids are a riot.  One of the funniest episodes shows them at a marriage counselor and the counselor is going through nicotine withdrawl. I can guarantee you will enjoy this series !",1264809600,,378,4.295774647887324
8340352,5,B001T21R7S,"I happened to catch one episode of this comedy on a trip. Idaho PBS is apparently broadcasting it. That episode was so funny that upon my return home I ordered Seasons 1 & 2 and then 3 & 4. If you like Brit comedy, you will probably like this one. I know I do.",1258243200,,260,3.8333333333333335
8340353,4,B001T21R7S,I bought the first two season and loved them. I had to have the next ones. I still like them but Abby isn't as funny as Janie was. It would have been just as funny without her. I am still glad I bought them and I'll probably buy the next ones out too.,1257206400,,251,3.7547169811320753
8340354,5,B001T21R7S,"I enjoy the British Comedies.  My favorite being Ballykissangel.  While in Ireland on a vacation we went to see where they filmed it in Avoca.  Went in the pub, walked the streets, and stood on the bridge in this quiant little Irish town.  After that we watched and before the trip we watched and enjoyed many other British shows including Fawlty Towers, Are You Being Served, Keeping Up Appearance, Father Ted, and we got hooked on My Family.  When you watch it you laugh and just enjoy the family humor.  I recommend all of these British Comedy Shows.  You will enjoy them very much.",1257206400,,585,4.5673076923076925
8340355,2,B001T21R7S,"The first two seasons of My Family were generally very funny. Seasons three and four mostly recover the same ground. the addition of the niece in place of the daughter does not help. The hapless oldest son
becomes tiresome.",1257120000,,223,4.743589743589744
