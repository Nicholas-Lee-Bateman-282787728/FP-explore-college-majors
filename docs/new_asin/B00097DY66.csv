You see and hear things from every point of view from those times.  They did an amazing thorough job on this.  I was glued to the screen.  You can see into the lives of people from all different walks of life, and it describes different leadership styles going on in different areas.  The film talks about how Hitler rose to power, how people were persuaded to follow him, how different Germans felt about what was happening, and what was going on in Poland.  You hear from Nazis as well as Germans who were shocked at what happened,  and from Polish people and Jews.",1414713600,,711,4.723577235772358

2269437,4,B00097DY66,"I have a better-than-average knowledge and appreciation of the issues and the events of WWII.  Must say first off: I learned many new and surprising details from this superb BBC/A&E series.

By the time he wrote and produced this 6-part documentary, British historian Laurence Rees was no newcomer to the medium, and since he made The Nazis, he's completed other books and documentaries on the war.  The man's knowledge and understanding is prodigious.

This is NOT a chronicle of the war in Europe.  The military events serve only both as a backdrop and as illustrations of how, many times, they were the RESULT of the way in which the Nazis came to power and then ruled Germany. It's the National Socialist Party--which became the Nazi regime--that is the focus, here.  Pay close attention to HOW the tiny German Workers' Party struggled to make its voice heard just 2-3 years after WW I, and the economic and social conditions that, in effect, shoved a microphone in front of its leader, Adolf Hitler.

Most fascinating was the chapter, The Wrong War, which reveals Hitler's REAL target of conquest--and it wasn't France, Belgium, Holland or the UK!",1412899200,,1152,4.907216494845361

2269439,5,B00097DY66,This is a DVD not to be missed.  It goes beyond the usual historical account of the victors in war and provides a deep probe into the events and people that were immersed in the world out of which Nazism was birthed.,1412035200,,216,4.142857142857143
2269476,5,B00097DY66,"This is a very well done recent Documentary on that Adolf guy and his party of cronies, the nazi's.

2269484,5,B00097DY66,"The focus of this documentary is Germany (before, during, and after WWII). It contains color and black/white footage, much of which I had not seen before. It also reveals history about Germany, Hitler, and the Nazis that I was not aware of.

The narration is very well done. The music is fine.

One of the highlights of this documentary is the many interviews with German people as well as interviews Jewish people and other European people who were impacted by Hitler.

My only complaint is that it seemed to end abruptly; I think they could have spent a little more time on the suicide of Hitler and those with him.

Although there are only 2 DVDs to this set, it contains a wealth of information.  Very well done.

2269485,5,B00097DY66,One of the best films on Nazi Germany I've seen. Seems tell the truth about and shine light on Nazi Germany. Learned a lot from watching this film.,1393113600,,147,4.285714285714286
2269526,5,B00097DY66,"Laurence Rees' documentary THE NAZIS A Warning From History is a first rate account of the Rise and Fall of the Nazi government in Germany. This story goes to show that no matter how many times a particular history is explored, there is always more to be seen and learned. I particularly liked the look into the social and psychological aspects of the Nazi era. I think this program does an excellent job at probing the aspects of this event that show that it could certainly happen again and in any country. Some of the interviews were quite disturbing in that the showed a lack of remorse and the classic ""I was only following orders"" mentality. This program challenges all of us to ask ourselves if we were confronted with a similar situation, what would we do?",1392163200,,764,4.583941605839416

2269528,5,B00097DY66,I would recommend this product. it was very nice and met all of my expectations. It came on time and I have no complaints!,1390867200,,122,4.125
2269529,5,B00097DY66,"I found this documentary on the rise of the Nazis somewhat simplified but very comprehensive and well laid out.

Excellent use of images and dialog, well balanced in traditional BBC style. Without trying to cover all bases it delves into Hitler's move to the east and the ramifications of that act as well as investigates Hitler's inner person, his dreamy, fanatical qualities.

With smooth pacing and top-notch editing, The Nazis is a well worth the money in my book.",1390867200,,468,4.9113924050632916
2269530,5,B00097DY66,A very good DVD that tracks the life of Hesse frm his being appointed t the camps t the end. Plus it she's gphw the nazis n hitter were able t suck the German people into the belief that hitler was good fr the county,1389052800,,216,3.8222222222222224
2269531,5,B00097DY66,"This is a six hour documentary and the best I've ever viewed on the rise of fascism and the holocaust. I commend the interviewees. for speaking on the record. A horrific how human beings can be persuaded, manipulated, and justify their acts. ""That which has happened is a warning. To forget it is guilt. It must be continually remembered. It was possible for this to happen, and it remains possible for it to happen again at any minute. Only in knowledge can it be prevented."" Karl Jaspers",1387238400,,489,4.632183908045977
2269532,5,B00097DY66,"As many BBC outstanding productions this 2 disc set of 290 minutes follows through with a mix of Black and White and Color footage in Stereo.  The English subtitles assist the viewer in understanding the stories of the many surviving people who were eye-witness to the events portrayed in the documentary.  This film illustrates how a political party regime as fundamentally evil came to power in a democratic state/ republic, gained influence, and suppressed freedoms through lies, political manipulation, fraud, and deceit. Once it took hold even its own people could not resist it!  One needs to view this production to view parallels to our own present political state of affairs in our own country today!!!!!!!! This is a Warning From History",1387238400,,747,5.10655737704918
2269533,1,B00097DY66,"The Nazis - A Warning from History is an attempt to vilify every German who lived in the 20th century and to systematically categorize them as ""evil"". Obviously this is some effort to deflect current controversial political issues onto some past event and ""learn again"" from History. Well, no one has ever ""learnt from History"" and it repeats. America claims to be a nation of ""democracy"" when it has spent the last six years creating bloodshed in the middle east, all for the control of oil reserves. The book should concentrate on the political and economic forces that shaped the 1930 German state and not debase the German people.",1387152000,,634,4.825688073394495
2269534,5,B00097DY66,Film was very well done and historically accurate.  The film gives you insight into the world as it was back at the begining of the war. I allows you to see what people really thought about what was going on in their world and why things happened the way they did.  I think this is a must see film of World War II or anyone who loves history and tries to understand it.,1386979200,,369,4.041095890410959
2269535,5,B00097DY66,This dvd is true to history and is very detailed. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in the history of the Haulocaust,1386374400,,133,4.36

2269538,5,B00097DY66,"Well worth watching. It's such a ghastly, horrifying story, and this documentary shows how the Nazis designed ""the final solution"" in a terrifyingly methodical and unemotional way. Unusually, I didn't mind actors (we don't hear them speaking) playing the parts of Hoess and Himmler, et al; but Hoess is one of the strangest people I've ever come across in history (apart from Hitler, Himmler, Goebbels, Gring, Heydrich, et al). He doesn't seem to have been a typical sociopath but how to explain his indifference to what was going on around him daily, and the almost complete absence of guilt or responsibility he felt at the end of the war? The (Nazi & Allied) film reels of Auschwitz will always stun, confuse and sicken me; but they are such a necessary part of the record. I emphatically recommend this dvd to teachers of 20th century history in high schools.",1386028800,,863,4.837837837837838
2269539,5,B00097DY66,"There's an old addage:  ""Forwarned is forearmed.""  What happened with the almost hidden rise of the 3rd Reich......may very well happen again today, if we're not careful to see the signs ahead of time.  This documentary shows all the subtleties that most people were not aware of, and you can actually see all the prevailing circumstances of why the German people were so easily bamboozled into accepting the ""pie-in-the-sky"" picture that Hitler was presenting to them.  We would all do well to watch this film, considering how upside down our morals are in today's society.",1386028800,,574,5.010526315789473
2269540,5,B00097DY66,"This is another documentary with very good information on the Nazis and World War 2.
What made this world war 2 movie so very interesting is that it gives documentation and interviews on how the community supported the Nazis.  This was surprising to us.  No documentary we've seen on the topic ever revealed how few men were needed to enforce such a nightmarish regime. A real eye opener.",1385769600,,388,4.6911764705882355
2269541,5,B00097DY66,Excellent Documentary!  It contains quite a bit of footage that is not often seen on television or in other documentaries.  Well narrated and edited.,1384732800,,149,5.166666666666667
2269542,5,B00097DY66,This interesting British documentary reveals little-known details about the inner workings of the Third Reich that challenge many popular perceptions of top-down uber efficiency in Hitler's empire and even Hitler himself.  A must-see for those interested in going beyond the superficiality of the History Channel.,1381363200,,313,5.955555555555556
2269543,4,B00097DY66,"A very well-done and thorough documentary about the rise of Hitler's Germany and the claw marks that that regime made in history - claw marks which will not fade for centuries, despite the short 12 years that the Third Reich was in power.  A must-have for any history buff or for anyone interested in learning about one of the most terrible periods of human history.",1380672000,,366,4.630769230769231

2269545,4,B00097DY66,One of the best documentaries about The Nazis and their progression into power.  Excellently narrated and incredible never before seen footage.,1378166400,,143,5.809523809523809
2269546,5,B00097DY66,"This is an outstanding documentary about the history of NAZI Germany from its beginnings to its end.  Produced by the BBC it talks about how the NAZI'S gained in power after World War I during the depression and chaos of Germany.  After its violent political rise the leaders of the NAZI party gained control of Germany and its powerful influence over the German people is chilling to watch.  When this series was produced, the producers were able to interview many former NAZI'S who were in their late 70's and 80's.  It is sad and disturbing to find that many of those interviewed were unapologetic and still proud of their NAZI membership.  This series also in detail gives the history of the rise of Adolf Hitler, Herman Goering, Joseph Gobbels, Reinyard Heinrich, Heinrich Himmler and other leaders of the party.  The NAZI'S role during World War II, and its downfall in 1945.  This is an outstanding and interesting series that really describes the horror of the NAZI'S who were criminals, thugs, racists, and psychopaths who thankfully were destroyed by the Allies who saw the horror they did to Europe and the World.  A highly recommended series to those who are World War II historians, German History historians, and military history historians.  This is a series I would show in a secondary history class to describe what happened in the past, and always remember because it could easily happen again.",1377302400,,1412,4.899159663865547
2269547,4,B00097DY66,"I find it interesting that so may people in this once great nation cannot or will not see or understand the history of the 3rd Reich. There are politicians in this country who think that National Socialism is a great form of government, it just hasn't been tried by the right people, and those same politicians today on the socialist side of the spectrum think that they are the right people to make it work.

The holocaust is all that most people think of when you mention the 3rd Reich--but that aspect of it was only a portion of the real disaster that befell Germany.

This documentary is worth spending the money and time on and it should be required in schools of this once great nation just as it is required in modern Germany. They do not want to repeat the disaster. If only the present crop of big government, politician for life crowd could be made to understand that they are sowing to the wind and the nation will reap the whirlwind.",1374278400,,946,4.431034482758621
2269548,5,B00097DY66,"BBC video productions are almost always first-rate. This one is the best documentary about the the Nazi Party I've ever seen. The people interviewed here were either witnesses or participants in some of the most momentous and tragic events in human history. All the interviews were done in the native languages with no voice-over, just english sub titles, which I found very effective. I am still speechless at the lack of repentance by some of the people interviewed in this documentary, who were either Nazis or Nazi Party supporters in Germany, or the occupied countries. What was most disturbing were the images of the children being led away to their deaths. I found two very important points were emphasized in this documentary: First, how ineffective and harmful the multiple party parliamentary system can be to its people, and their neighbors, compared to the Two-Party system, as has been practiced in the United States. Second, the necessity for strict gun control laws. To the first point, the film's producers underlined that the Nazi Party began their takeover of government in November, 1932, with only a 37 percent share of the vote, split between 29 other parties. To the second point, the documentary makes one of the best cases for gun control I've ever encountered. The lack of gun control was one of the major causes for the ascension of the Nazi Party in German politics in the 1920s - the fact that both the Communists and the Nazis used guns to advance their agendas. The destabilizing influence of firearms in the hands of civilians and paramilitary groups overwhelmed the Reichswehr, and the lack of enforcement of the legal regulations regarding firearms was a key contributor towards creating conditions for the Nazi Party to flourish and gain support at the polling booth. I keep watching this video again and again as a reminder, and to keep vigilant against those racists and tricksters today, who try to convince that the only way to defend against violence is more violence. The Nazis must never march again. It's up to us, every day.",1372809600,,2067,4.942528735632184
2269549,5,B00097DY66,"The six part series ""The Nazis"" is an excellent production.  For the average person who is new to the topic, a student, or a member of the general public this is a great way to get a broad overview of the 1920-1945 events leading up to and culminating in WWII.  These people changed world history with their beliefs and actions and we now live in a world which was created in the aftermath (ashes?) of their actions.  This series gives a broad stroke understanding of the era in which the movement came to life, the means to power they used and the world-wide conflagration which ensued.",1368748800,,587,4.518867924528302

2269551,4,B00097DY66,If you are curious about the different aspects of the Nazis philosophy you will enjoy this presentation. It has a lot of film which I have not seen before. I find I enjoy the dvd the more times I watch it.,1364688000,,205,4.024390243902439
2269552,5,B00097DY66,"I have been collecting WW2 documentaries lately and this is one of my favorites. It's not that this is a comprehensive review of every major Nazi from the era, but is a solid source of information on many major and minor characters who were part of selected stories. It's less about field generals and more about the policy implementers who carried out and sometime modified Hitler's decisions. The stories also are set up by visits to actual locations and both the pacing and tone is gradual and contemplative. It's actually fairly quiet. Less artillery going off and fewer loud battle scenes. More listening to people speak in their own languages. Production values are top notch. Recommended.",1364688000,,695,5.0

2269555,5,B00097DY66,"Prepare yourself for the worst. This is an excellent series and well worth the cost. It shows that Hitler wasn't elected Chancellor of Germany; it was all politics. The arogance of the former Nazis and other Germans who benefitted from the plight of their victims is horrific. Instead of reading reviews, purchase the videos and learn. A BBC production with excellent narration. Should be required for all Americans when studying WWII.",1360108800,,435,5.140845070422535

2269561,5,B00097DY66,"I thoroughly enjoyed this series. Usually World War II documentaries focus on the various battles fought but this series takes a different perspective. It looks at the Nazi movement and Hitler in particular through the eyes of the German people at that point in their history. I have a better appreciation now for how Hitler came to power but also a better understanding of what went wrong and how horribly the Nazi's treated people that they considered non-German, and therefore sub-human.",1357084800,,490,5.061728395061729
2269562,5,B00097DY66,"A very moving, enlightening documentary.  I knew of the horror jews, gypsys, homosexuals, lesbians had faced under Hitler, but this just show the horror and insanity of Hitle and his German people like never before.  Interviews with the people that were involved in committing these crimes and hear from the people that were forced to suffer them.  A very few survived.  Absolutely haunting what the human animal is capable of when God is on his side!  We are the most vicious, inhuman animal on earth!  See it and pray we never do this again!  So frightening because we do on smaller scale but don't learn and still feel we have the right to protect and kill!  May this movie shock you into peace that never raises a weapon again for any reason!",1356825600,,746,4.598484848484849

2269565,5,B00097DY66,"The documentary is very informative and gives a person a more in depth look into the men behind the second world war and the thinking that led up to it. And it also gives you from the mouths of Germans who lived through it, a sense of what it was like living in Nazi Germany. A question I always had personally was, ""why did the Nazis pick the Jews as a focal point for their hatred"" ? Because there are Jews where I live and they're not hindering my life or any aspects of it. And the video leads you to believe that it wasn't pure racism or religion that made the Nazis hate them, it was that Jewish Communists were blamed for the ""Armistice"" of the Great War. And the fact of the matter is that Jewish Communists actually were the leaders of left wing militant groups that were revolting and creating unrest in Germany during and after the Great War. So in defense of the German population of the time I ask this, ""would American citizens treat those they viewed as domestic terrorists any better?"" we have executed most major domestic terrorists or buried them under a jail, does our general public stand up on their behalf? There is no justification for the state sponsored extermination of an entire people, but this video helps you to understand why many German citizens did not risk their lives or the lives of their families in defense of who they were told were domestic terrorists. The video itself does not imply that but that is what I personally took away from it. A lot of historians talk about how the German population should have done something, well what did the American public do when our Government and groups sponsored by our Government were systematically exterminating the Native population of this land? A whole lot of nothing is what they did. And what is left of the Native population is still largely ""concentrated"" on Reservations, living is most cases on full dependence of the state. When you look at things in such a broad view it opens your mind so much. Most other Americans I have this discussion with won't even address the situation, they say ""oh get over it that was so long ago"" and they consider me un-American or unpatriotic and I do not care, what's right is right. You cannot judge the German citizens of the time for not doing something that our own people were unwilling to do, it is pure hipocracy, which does seem to reign supreme in our country. Our fight for independence from England is looked upon as a just cause, but the Palestinians' fight for freedom from oppression from Israel is looked at as terrorism, why? why was our cause more just than theirs is? Just because Palestine is the biblical homeland of the Jews thousands of years ago does not mean that they should have rights to it now all of a sudden because they needed a place to escape to from Europe in the 20th Century. Also funny how our country and even Britain knew of the Jews plight before we entered the war and we didn't step in on their behalf then either. The same way the Muslims are  fighting a war for what they believe is to make the world safe for Islam, we fought wars to make the world safe for Democracy, why is one more evil than the other? Even in a Democracy you don't have any guaranteed rights, yours rights are issued to you by your Government and can be revoked at any time, in America you have the right to bear arms ""unless you have a Felony"" you have a right to remain silent ""but then they just charge you with obstructing justice"". For every so called freedom we have the Government has a way of denying us that freedom whenever it pleases. So how is a Democracy different than a Dictatorship? We only think it is different because we have the deluded illusion that we control who goes into office, which is untrue. In the end yo have to have tons of money and the backing of the people who are already making decisions in this country in order to get elected. It is all a sham, and we are just as brainwashed or complacent as the Germans were. Just that the Nazis at least were honest in the sense that their ideology was that the individual is secondary to the state, here we are told that we are totally free, unless you have enough intelligence to read the small print. My father paid cash for his house, never owed any bank or anyone a dime, but unless he keeps a job so that he can afford the thousands of dollars a year in taxes it can be taken from him at any time, that to me sounds like surf-dom, work  to fuel the state or be stripped of everything, and then they will not only take everything from you they will jail you for back taxes. I always tell my father that he should've just rented a nice apartment, he wouldn't have to cut grass or shovel snow or pay for maintenence, no huge upfront cost, you're paying rent either way, just to the Government as your landlord instead of a fellow citizen or corporation.

Some Wagner would have been much more appropriate and fitting then what they used.

The interviewer was masterful at his ability to get former Nazi's to open up about what happened and what they did. He brilliantly would ask the questions and let the person answer but after they were done answering he (the interviewer) would just sit quietly and look at the person. The uncomfortable silence made them continue talking and eventually you can tell that they are not only trying to convince him they were justified or had no choice in what they did they were trying to convince themselves as well.  I also liked the fact that some that were interviewed did not apologize and in fact still believe they were in the right.  If you are a history buff I suggest you buy this.

2269574,4,B00097DY66,"Any review of this DVD set would have to start with what this DVD covers and what it does not. It is definitely not an examination, so typical of books and DVDs on the subject, of Nazi Germany's foreign policy or a military history of the Second World War from the perspective of the Nazis. What it is, instead, is a history of the Nazi party's policies, governance style, racial policies and factors that lead to its rise and fall. These are examined in six one hour episodes.
The series starts off with and episode setting up the pre-Nazi Germany political environment, specifically how the society had spilt between extreme left and right with an emaciated middle, and how the Nazis were able to exploit this to come to power. This they did primarily by convincing the then governing elite (i.e., law enforcement arms, armed forces and judiciary) that they would be preferable to the communists. Hence these organizations provided their support to Hitler and insured that he became head of state even though his party did not receive the legally required majority in parliament to legally be nominated to this position. Ironically, it also showed how much these organizations despised Hitler and the Nazis.

The second episode examines Hitler's governance style. It shows how Hitler's apparent of a lack work ethic despite propaganda efforts to claim the opposite. He took multi-hour naps and spent considerable time watching movies, for example. In addition, he had the tendency to pre-delegate major policy implementation to subordinates. He gave these subordinates considerable latitude in how to accomplish their objectives. In Hitler's words the only he really cared about is that his orders were carried out, not how they were carried out. The only thing really missing from the episode was the influence of the occult, especially astrology, on his governance. Ironically, Hitler's governance style was quite similar to that of Ronald Reagan during the 1980s.

The third episode covers the Nazis' governance of occupied territory. Unfortunately this is done only via a case study of how three Nazi governors governed the three provinces Poland was separated into after being conquered by Germany. In accord with Hitler's governing style, the governors were given very wide discretion as to how to govern and, as a result, the policies in these three provinces were remarkably different. One governor even went so far as to, de facto, ignore Hitler's racial policies. Very illuminating as to how Poland was governed. Unfortunately not very illuminating as to how the rest of the occupied territories, especially Western Europe was governed.

The fourth episode covers the war against Russia but not the military campaigns but via the governance of the territories and the viciousness of the campaign, both against the Red armies and the occupied peoples, many of whom ironically were quite anti-communists. By doing so the Nazis lost a vast base of support. Guderian, in his memoirs, explicitly states that he thought the Nazis racial policies were most responsible for Germany's loss of the war. This episode does a good job at showing how.

The fifth episode examines the systematic extermination of racial undesirables, primarily the Jews, from early Nazi policies towards them, to the ""final solution"". The one weakness of this episode is that is leaves out Nazi extermination policies towards other racial groups such as the Gypsies, Slavs and homosexuals. Considering that, for example, more Slavs ended up dead under Nazi occupational policies than Jews this is a serious oversight. The episode also is a bit weak on elaborating why the Nazis engaged in such policies. Their racial policies simply are only very briefly glossed over. This is not to excuse them, only to emphasize that the episode does not provide a background or explanation behind these policies. Again, another serious weakness.
The last episode attempts to answer the question of why Italy collapsed so quickly while Germany fought on until the bitter end even well after defeat was clearly inevitable. Reasons included lack of institutional challenges to Hitler (especially in the form of organizations operating independently of Hitler), the efficiency of the Nazis' internal security apparatus and, probably most importantly, fear of what the Soviet Union's retribution on Germany would be if it were to win. There is also some discussion of the failed assassination attempts on Hitler.

All and all the series is well made with high production values, very well researched (not surprising as one of the main consultants was Ian Kershaw - an English professor who is one of the world's leading authorities on Hitler and the Nazis) and provides excellent film footage, a good deal of which has been restored and is in color.

2269578,5,B00097DY66,"This 6-part BBC series should be essential viewing for anyone interested in WWII. It provides a valuable insight into the workings of the Nazi state and provides an intriguing answer to the questions ""How did such a fringe group take and maintain control over a large and cultured country and lead it down the path to destruction?"" and ""How much complicity did the average Germans have in the Nazi state?""

The series does not pretend to be a comprehensive history of WWII -- little attention is paid to the combat. Instead it profiles the workings of the Nazi state and the sources of its power. The topics it deals with include: the rise of the Nazis to power, how the Nazi state worked, the drift towards war and its beginnings, the workings of the Nazi state in the east (particularly in Poland), the ""final solution,"" and the bitter end.

The series contains fascinating original film and interviews with people who were involved in the events, including functional-level and fairly senior Nazis as well as ordinary people who were caught up in the events of the war.

The most interesting perspective of the show is its description of the workings of the Nazi state and how it managed to control its vast empire. The video asserts -- and backs it up -- that Hitler and his henchmen were administratively inept and that the state would not have functioned at all but for the very willing involvement (and initiative) of countless low- and mid-level functionaries, who enthusiastically carried out, interpreted, and in some cases initiated the Nazi party racial and administrative policies. It's a pretty unsparing view of the German people and provides a valuable insight into the workings of this group of madmen. I've read widely on WWII and have long pondered the question of how Hitler and his allies seized and maintained control of the state and the nation and how they seemingly mesmerized an entire People -- this video gave as good an explanation as I've ever seen.

The subtitle of the series is carefully chosen -- the film's message is ""this could happen anywhere."" Brilliant show.",1305417600,,2098,4.851955307262569

""That which has happened is a warning.  To forget it is guilt.  It is possible for this to happen and it remains possible for it to happen again at any minute."" (Karl Jaspers, German philosopher)

The above comes at the very end of this chilling documentary.  It examines Adolf Hitler (1889 to 1945) & the Nationalist Socialist German Workers' Party's or  Nazis Party's or just Nazis' rise to power, their zenith, their decline & fall, and the consequences of their reign.

The historical adviser for this film was historian and professor, Sir Ian Kershaw.  Kershaw is said to be one of the world's leading experts on Hitler and Nazi Germany.  He appears in one episode.

This documentary is deeply informative, easy to understand, well-written, objective, and well-narrated (by actor Samuel West).  It answered many of my questions concerning World War Two.

Throughout the film, there are eyewitness accounts given as well as comments from researchers.

There were two things I especially liked about this documentary.  First, it only gives you the facts.  It is never boring  (In fact, I found it riveting.)  Second, the archival film footage (some of which is in color) has been cleaned-up.  In other words, the footage is not grainy and has no blemishes as you might expect, but is unusually clear.

The ominous music used over the opening credits for each episode comes from the second movement of composer Johannes Brahm's ""A German Requiem"" (1865-68).

This DVD set that was released in 2005 has no extras.

Finally, this documentary has won eight international awards.

In conclusion, this documentary is a frightening reminder of one of the darkest chapters in human history!!

2269600,5,B00097DY66,"I'm amazed at how easily this twisted, little nobody had the nation of Germany handed to him by the German people.
The way they worshiped him, without question.  How he convinced them that murdering millions of people, was the right thing to do, and how willingly they did as they were told.
It's beyond me.",1299888000,,307,4.581818181818182
2269601,5,B00097DY66,"Being a life long student of WW2 history, of course I had to get this documentary they have been advertising on television recently. My parents met during the war so understanding it has been a passionate interest of mine. This is a documentary I absorbed with the same fascination as the excellent ""World at War"" series from the BBC made in the early 1970's. Totally engrossing.

What they do in this documentary is get to the root cause and series of events in Germany preceding Adolf Hitler's unlikely rise to power. He never was your ""typical"" politician, so how did it all happen? Mainly using numerous interviews of Germans, Poles, Russians, etc who lived in Europe at the time, you can begin to understand the mood and thought process that gave way to the ""perfect storm"" in a sequence of events that led to this, the darkest 12 years of recorded human history.

Among the many participants who graciously chose to be interviewed is a General close to Hitler. I learned from this man in this documentary that Hitler made it a habit of giving more than one person the same task. Then he would sit back and let the ""combatants"" fight it out to deliver to Hitler the solution closest to their interpretation of the problem Hitler wanted solved, irregardless of ethics. That is why many German Generals believed they were being led by a band of criminals, because they were. Hitler had no use for anyone who had an opinion contrary to his own, and if you objected on any personal moral grounds, you were simply removed. Hitler wanted his army to be hard as steel and utterly conscienceless. Completely obedient to him. Human compassion went contrary to the struggle for survival observed in nature. Turning the other cheek and blessing your enemies was a Christian weakness he believed was copped from Judaism and accordingly, everything Jewish to him, was contemptible and corrupting.

So when I read from some authors I'll leave unmentioned, that disregard facts that don't support their own ""Mien Kampf"" mentality, namely for one, that the Holocaust was the manifestation of Adolf Hitler's early childhood Catholic influence, it's worth my while to endorse this documentary. This is not a subject that should be allowed to be twisted to embellish any one's personal bias.

People were tripping over themselves to get noticed by Hitler and advance up the Nazi ladder, or just get a nod of approval from this diabolical sociopath. Hitler believed all of nature was engaged in a ""struggle"" to outwit and overpower ""the other"" in ingenuity, physical strength and willpower. This makes perfect sense given the propaganda shown to the German civilians that the Jews were an inferior ""race"" of people. Overnight practically this led to a persecution of them that defies rational explanation. Hitler was a man fiercely nationalistic who believed he was a providentially endorsed and protected superman, leading a nation of people who by the very sum of their many superior parts made them practically unbeatable against any obstacle, any enemy. In these delusions he convinced himself and enough of the population that they only needed to blindly follow him, ""The Fuhrer,"" a strong armed leader and his ""vision"" for them, a glorious future for Germany would last a thousand years. Truth can often be stranger than fiction and in this case frightening so. That is why they aptly subtitled this documentary, ""A Warning from History,"" because of it's attention arresting educational value

On that note you need to witness the answer from an executioner, a local man employed by the Nazi's in the killing squads roaming Nazi conquered territories. He among many others, ended the lives of countless civilian victims with a single rifle shot to the base of the skull at the edge of hastily dug mass ditches used to eliminate and cover over the ""undesirables."" There was a question posed to him as he was describing those executions, and it was, ""did he feel any moral pangs of guilt for his actions, back then and or now?"" I doubt I'll ever get his answer of of my head.

Some of the picture have been colour enhanced, all of the old footage is perfectly clear. Subtitles are used, no overdubs of those interviewed. This is a priceless addition to my library.",1298678400,,4253,4.875518672199171

What is fascinating is the unapologetic admission by some erstwhile Nazis that they were so attracted by the charisma of der Fuhrer that it is likely they would again succumb. Some discount their participation in carnage as not so reprehensible, attributing it to the process of war, a sentiment we encounter even today. The 1962 televison documentary based on William Shirer's The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich available still on VHS is a much more informative history.",1298160000,,703,5.068965517241379

Did they forget the millions more that were murdered by Stalin and his Bolsheviks?  The World was a very different place back then.  Racism, Imperialism, antisemitism, Darwinism and eugenics were popularly held beliefs throughout Western society and elsewhere.  In the USA, great land of freedom and democracy, Blacks were segregated and treated as second-class citizens!  Concentration-camps were a British idea from the Boer War; collective-punishment and mass execution was the typical manner in which the Colonial Powers dealt with insurgency, the German people have been unfairly singled-out.

2269608,5,B00097DY66,"We mostly look for movies and documentaries to supplement our regular studies for homeschool.  We've been watching The Nazis: A Warning from History over the past couple of weeks and it's the best documentary I've watched on WWII, particularly in regards to Germany's role in the war - including what led up to the war, which is very important.

My opinion is that every aspect of the documentary is appropriate for all ages of your family except for the section entitled ""The Road to Treblinka.""  Obviously there are some things in there that are very difficult to see and you'll need to stop and explain some things to your younger children.  There were also a couple of areas that weren't appropriate for younger kids, but for the most part I thought they handled it well and if you're planning to teach this, you have to decide what, when, how much to expose / present to your children at what age.

Otherwise, this particular documentary shares more video, interviews, photos and information than ANY I've ever watched and I've seen quite a few.  They were actually able to do a lot of research and use a lot of new videos and documents that have only been obtained from Berlin and other locations in recent years.  It's amazing to hear some of the documents - file papers, memos, letters, commands, etc. - that have only just been uncovered.  I have NEVER seen these before and I've researched much of this.  Also, the interviews are amazing.

But anyway, if you would like a good documentary series to supplement WWII studies, I would highly recommend this one.

As a side note, I would also recommend The Boy in the Striped Pajamas (which is also acceptable for all family members other than one short part where a Nazi soldier is beating an older Jewish man.  This video is extremely mild as far as violence.  The emotional impact is great, however.  It's an amazing film that tells the story with more emotional impact than any I've ever seen.)

2269626,5,B00097DY66,"I think this documentary was I great one because of the (for me) novel approach to the Nazi History: Why? and destroying the myth that the only evil ones were the SS.

It was ordinary people who did much of the terrible things. The interview of ordinary people (yes human ones) were chilling. They don't show remorse.

And that's the scary lesson: The atrocities were not just done by ""sychos"" (SS) but also by ""ordinary"" people...willingly",1253145600,,440,4.776315789473684
2269627,4,B00097DY66,"To start with, this is a superb documentary, from the point of view of the editing, the cinematography, the script, narration, the wide array of interview subjects, etc. It kept me transfixed until I had viewed the final episode.

That said, while there are few flaws in the content, there are some large and important gaps and some over-simplifications in this film series that, while they wouldn't matter to a viewer with a knowledge of the period and the issues, make this a less-than-adequate introduction to either the Third Reich or the Second World War. What was new and intriguing to me was the additional insight into Hitler's 'hands-off' approach to government, including the degree of his personal indolence, and what that meant in terms of policy decisions. (Would-be leaders were told if they wanted to head up a regional section, they should just seize control; the party didn't believe in appointing people. Meanwhile, Hitler would give two people largely-overlapping responsibilities and let them fight it out between themselves; little wonder Germany's economy never ended up on an even keel.) His entourage competed to keep Hitler happy, reading between the lines of what he actually said, and trying to be 'radical' in their solutions to the problems that he identified, including 'the Jewish question'.

But early on, the gaps start to emerge. If you believed this film, the death of Ernst Rohm was a single murder, rather than part of a massive and bloody purge of the SA (Brownshirts) by the new Nazi state. There is no mention of the burning of the Reichstag, a seminal moment in the Nazi rise to power and one Hitler exploited to consolidate his power and oppress his enemies (that oppression is extensively documented, including interviews with social democrats shipped off to Dachau.) The Spanish Civil War, which served as a 'test run' for the weapons being developed in Nazi Germany, is never mentioned. The third episode is devoted to Hitler's envy of the traditional colonial powers, particularly the British, and his attempts to reach an accomodation with them. But the fourth episode, which opens with the destruction of Poland (the announcement of war closes the Third) moves the locus of all the action decisively to Germany's Eastern frontier. There is no reference to Hitler's efforts to avoid a shooting war in the West, to the blitzkrieg in the Netherlands, Belgium and France, etc. Just as later, there is only a single reference to D-Day and none at all to the fact that Mussolini's deposition was followed by a Nazi counter-invasion and occupation of Italy. (Mussolini's departure is placed only in the context of 'why the Germans didn't do more to oppose Hitler'.)

While the film's broad points about how Hitler had managed to sideline his opponents and make himself not only Chancellor but also head of state (meaning that the Germans couldn't turn to a king to replace him, as the Italians did), the filmmakers focus only on the Stauffenberg bomb plot. And while they emphasize the fear of the Soviet Union as a reason for rallying behind Hitler, they don't mention the insistence of the Allies that Germany surrender unconditionally, even had Hitler been deposed -- something that would have meant another Versailles, in the eyes of even Hitler's opponents. They also avoid any discussion of the (admittedly limited) civil resistance beyond the military that included church leaders like Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Martin Niemoller and the Catholic youngsters in Munich who formed the White Rose group, as well as the pro-Soviet Rote Kappelle. There's a discussion about the bombing of German cities in 1944/45 -- but no reference to the Blitz of 1940 that paved the way for that bombing of civilians. And so on...

The argument of this 5-hour series is that the Nazi regime holds a warning for us. That's very true indeed -- in fact, I believe that once broken, taboos like genocide in a way become more conceivable rather than less so.  Once something has occurred once in history, it becomes an event. But to realize the full horror of the event, it's important to be aware of all the facts and consequences, not just selected ones. There was certainly room to include the ones that I have mentioned above without sacrificing any of the detail that makes this poignant and powerful. I agree that it's hard to deliver a complete history in such a short timespan, but in some cases, being sure that all the facts are there would have required only a sentence or two to be spoken.

There is little new here about the Holocaust, and yet the film devotes the better part of two episodes to the horrors of the campaign to 'Germanize' Poland and eradicate the Jewish population of Europe. Again, however, this would have had a greater impact if the editors and writers had combined this horror story with some effort to relate the Nazi regime's attempts to  encourage the birth of 'pure Aryans' via the Lebensborn program. Anyone looking for a full understanding of the horror of the Nazi racial policies should go directly to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Auschwitz-Inside-the-Nazi-State/dp/B000777JH8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Auschwitz - Inside the Nazi State</a>, which demonstrates in a powerful and chilling way just how theory became practice in Nazi Germany. There's little new content on the subject in this film.

The best parts of this documentary are the interviews with those who lived through the era, of whom fewer and fewer are available to tell the story today. The interviewers don't shy away from the hard questions, asking why a woman denounced her neighbor, why someone participated in killing squads, why another woman admired Reinhard Heydrich. Many of the answers prove unsatisfying - but how can they be? Remorse would be unconvincing; perhaps the way they appear on screen, squirming in embarassement as they try to duck and weave their way through an interview, may cause them the shame that their actions more than sixty years ago should have but didn't.

Recommended only for those with an existing knowledge of the era; otherwise, look for a more basic introduction first. If you're interested in understanding how on earth the Nazi regime crept to power and functioned, William Shirer's book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rise-and-Fall-of-the-Third-Reich-A-History-of-Nazi-Germany/dp/0671728687/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany</a>&nbsp;is still one of the most accessible single volumes available; if you're looking for an excellent and more scholarly version, try the three volumes produced by Richard Evans, beginning with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Coming-of-the-Third-Reich/dp/0143034693/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Coming of the Third Reich</a>. In addition to the Auschwitz series, anyone interested in understanding the Holocaust should, at some point, make the time to sit through the full  film by Claude Lanzmann,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shoah-4-DVD-Set-NON-USA-FORMAT-PAL-Reg-2-Import-Netherlands/dp/B000F8MEHO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shoah 4-DVD Set [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg. 2 Import - Netherlands </a>]. I'd suggest renting the first disc, with the first three episodes, and then turning to the Auschwitz DVD  , which covers the rest of the story in far more detail and with an even more powerful emotional wallop.

In all the examination of the Nazi regime, one giant hole remains: how did the Germans come to grips with this legacy and the issue of collective vs.  individual guilt? There's room for a great documentary film maker to tackle this, from the days that the first citizens were forced to confront what had happened at the death camps, through the process of de-Nazification, reparations, etc., the broadcast of the TV series 'Holocaust' on European TV in 78/79 (I was at high school in Belgium at the time, and the debates the days after each episode aired were dramatic...) So far, that seems to have been only addressed in fiction and  drama, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Reader/dp/B001PPLJIQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Reader</a>.",1248480000,,8359,5.479813664596273

Instead, it focuses on the Nazi policies of ethnic cleansing  and the people that installed and implemented these policies.

A large-scale ethnic cleansing, such as the one undertaken by the Nazis, involves a lot of people. Were they all forced to do it?
No, they were not. In fact, they volunteered for it. And not just the Germans - the documentary shows how foreign nationals volunteered to join the SS forces, which committed the majority of the war crimes during the WWII.
The documentary also shows how locals in the occupied territories voluntarily participated in the  genocide against the Jews.

Violence against other humans is not a national characteristic.
Under specific social conditions, as demonstrated by the Milgram and Stanford prison experiments, ""ordinary people, simply doing their jobs, and without any particular hostility on their part, can become agents in a terrible destructive process"".

2269660,3,B00097DY66,"Preface: Others have covered very well the many positive qualities of this series, so I'm going to focus on just a few points for the sake of brevity.

The Nazis - A Warning from History"" sadly suffers from the same faults of most documentaries about the Nazis. It simply looks at the conditions that were prevalent in Germany, acknowledges the inequity of the treaty of Versailles, but fails to give all important perspective. Anti-semitism was not especially prevalent in Germany. France expelled the Jews hundreds of years prior and at the turn of the century had the Dryfus affair which exposed rampant french Antisemitism. Anti-Jew riots were still a annual occurrence around Europe. Germany only had such a large Jewish population because it was comparatively a very tolerant country!

More importantly, the documentary totally fails to appreciate how the allies very directly enabled the rise of the Nazi party. Towards the end of the war allied propaganda logically targeted German groups they thought less interested in fighting: Jews, Communists, Intelligentsia, Trade Unionists and Socialists.

The propaganda heavily played upon Wilson's 14 points. It was produced and spread by French, American and British agents. Groups in Germany which agitated for peace did so in good faith with the belief that these promises of a lenient peace would be upheld. They did so believing it was best for the country they truly loved and indeed fought for: Germany.

Of course, we know what happened. In America's case its forgivable, as they actually intended honor these promises. But France and England had no such intent, and brutally exploited the good will of these minority groups. From the beginning, they openly planned to betray these promises and extract huge concessions, knowing that once an armistice was signed the German army would not be able to resume fighting.

In Germany the theory that minority groups were guilty of betraying Germany was widespread, and indeed seemed justified. Today it is referred to as the ""Dolchstosslegende,"" literally ""stab in the back"" myth. It is derided as being racist, this corner of history is therefore rarely mentioned. Germans desperately want to avoid anything that hints of racism, and the former ""allied countries"" hardly want to place yet more blame on themselves.

I feel this is a true shame, because this is one of the most important warnings the Nazis have to give and very few appreciate it. Indeed, during the the gulf war we encouraged ethnic agitation by the Kurds, with no real intent of actually giving Iraq a favorable peace treaty of any sort - they paid for our carelessness.

Furthermore, I think the utility of focusing on what happened under Nazi dictatorship is limited with regards to future prevention. History has shown us again and again that once a violent dictatorship establishes itself it is nearly always too late. Milgram's experiments showed that Americans will commit atrocities, we're humans just like Germans. The critical lessons are what lead to such dictatorships. Once a dictatorship such as the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany or Fascist Japan establishes itself, overthrow from within is nearly impossible.

There are many, many redeeming points of this series and I still highly recommend it. I also understand that most people do not see this same short coming - I can't blame them. You can hardly complain that something is not there when you don't even know you should be looking for it.",1228435200,,3479,5.101933216168717
2269661,5,B00097DY66,"This excellent series should be required viewing for anyone with the slightest concern with what's going on in our country today and what's going to become of us in the future.

Step by step, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party's rise to power is meticulously documented, along with how and why one of the most liberal and tolerant of all the European nations in history voted him in as Chancellor of Germany.

The descriptions of Hitler's operating methods and his relationships with his subordinates are especially chilling. He surrounded himself with sycophants whose advancement was based on their personal loyalty to him and nothing else. Then he encouraged them to compete with one another to win his favor.

The series clearly demonstrates Hitler's personal laziness, his disdain for detail work and the day to day administrative governmental grind, which he left entirely to his subordinates.

When it came to new policy, he would suddenly pluck an idea out of the air and throw it at one of his underlings, and he often assigned the same project to two of them at once.

The only actual work he ever did was on his public speeches and appearances, and, as a flamboyant demagogue/showman, he was definitely  in a class by himself.

Not only did he put on entertaining, colorful spectactles at his enormous rallies, he would deliberately aim his inflammatory rhetoric at his audience's lowest common denominator; which was their rage against the Treaty of Versailles after Germany's WWI defeat and its resulting economic woes. Then, when he had his audience thoroughly worked up, he would offer them what they most wanted to hear: a magic bullet.

Just this past week, I watched on TV as a prominent political candidate attempted to whip up their audience with one hatemongering statement after another at the top of their lungs. Afterwards, while I watched them joyously reaching for one outstretched hand after another in the adoring crowd, I suddenly realized that the only thing lacking to make the whole  event complete was a Swastika.

While this is not an easy series to watch, I still thoroughly recommend it to anyone with a concern about some of the things we're seeing happen today, if only so that we won't be tempted make the same political mistakes.",1223769600,,2266,4.923884514435696

2269708,5,B00097DY66,"An excellent production!

One of the best things about this documentary was the personal perspectives - the many interviews with people who were ""on the ground"" as it was all happening. It reinforced the role of individual responsibility and public actions in how the Nazis came to power. As they explain in some detail, before the Great Depression the Nazi's had only single digit (percentage wise) preference by the public. It was the economic hard times that set the stage for the rise in Nazi popularity.

I also found the aspect of Hitler's vacation time and his working hours interesting. Parallels with another world leader, anyone?

The documentary shows how different people chose varying degrees of ""active involvement"" in the Nazi regime. From a general citizen who denounced her neighbour to the Gestapo, to a man who participated in one of the massacres of Jews in the occupied territories - the moral aspect is never left untouched by the interviewers. The guy who refused to answer any questions of whether his conscience personally bothered him, despite his frank discussion of other facts really creeped me out. Contrasting this was the ex-Nazi soldier charged with evicting Polish residents from their villages to make way for resettled Germanics from other countries. He put himself at some risk to warn the villages in advance, saying tearfully that it was the only way he was able to live with himself.

Clearly, the war was a polarizing force in more ways than the immediately apparent.

The step by step charting of how Hitler was ""helped"" into power was also interesting, as were the comments about the Jewish leaders of the Bavarian Communist revolt after WWI. Douglas Reed's book, ""The Controversy of Zion"" provides an interesting historical context in that area. That the Nazis had such an ideological vendetta against the Russians was something that I wasn't as aware of. The documentary also points out some interesting things about the pre-war Nazi relationship with the English and Americans, whom Hitler reputedly admired. It would have been interesting for the documentary to have explored the pre-war Nazi-American connection more - there is certainly a LOT of material there to investigate.

Overall, I would say this is THE best ""overall perspective"" WWII documentary that I've ever seen. When it finished, I felt like 6 hours wasn't enough, and I wanted to see them cover a LOT more, in more detail! Big kudos to the team that produced it - excellent work, and a sober ""Warning from History"" indeed.",1187395200,,2536,5.026190476190476
2269709,5,B00097DY66,"This six-part British documentary chronicles the rise and fall of Hitler and the Nazis, though far from just being the usual retelling of familiar historical events, it goes so much deeper.  A lot of the pictures and film footage haven't been seen before, and many of the people interviewed were actual higher-ups in the Nazi Party or Wehrmacht, instead of just interviewing regular soldiers and civilians.  Other people interviewed are those who lived under the Nazi occupation in Poland, the former Czechoslovakia, and Lithuania.  A number of the very elderly Germans, as well as a Lithuanian who was a member of the Einsatzgruppen, are pretty matter-of-fact and unrepentant about what they did, even with so many decades of historical hindsight and knowing what we do now.  There's also a lot of information that hasn't been brought to light before about many of the topics covered.

Disc one contains the episodes 'Helped into Power,' 'Chaos and Consent,' and 'The Wrong War.'  The first episode covers the historical background that gave rise to the Nazi Party, starting with the humiliation of losing WWI and the skyrocketing inflation and demilitarisation that resulted, and going on to how this minor insignificant party would, within the span of a decade, become as large and powerful as it became, and how it eventually won almost unanimous support.  The second episode deals with the true chaotic inner-workings of the Nazi Party, showing that beneath their veneer of order, they were really disorganised and unmotivated leaders, spending more time on infighting (much of it encouraged by Hitler) and playing around than conducting serious business.  It also covers the topic of the mass murder of the mentally disabled, a policy which chillingly started when a man wrote to Hitler asking if his disabled son could be euthanised.  The final episode on the first disc covers the start of WWII and how it wound up being the war that Hitler had not originally wanted, since he'd long admired Great Britain for how well they controlled their vast empire in spite of being such a relatively small people, and had also long viewed the Soviet Union as Germany's enemy, yet wound up fighting against Great Britain and allied, at least temporarily, with the Soviets.

Disc two contains the episodes 'The Wild East,' 'The Road to Treblinka,' and 'Fighting to the End.'  The first episode deals with the brutal treatment of Poland and the Poles in the wake of the Nazi invasion.  Poland was the nation which suffered by far the most; about one in every five Poles was murdered.  In the wake of encorporating Poland into Greater Germany, ethnic Germans who lived in other areas were encouraged to move in, but as the survivors who are interviewed recount, this wasn't nearly as happy and cheery as the propaganda films suggested, even for the ethnic Germans, who soon found that they weren't moving into some paradise where everything was automatically provided for them.  The second episode deals with the Einsatzgruppen (the mobile killing squads that massacred the Jewish communities in the Baltic states, Belarus, and the western regions of Russia and the Ukraine), experiments into mass extermination by gas, the Polish ghettoes, and the infamous Treblinka itself.  The final episode deals with 1943 through to the end of the war, when Germany's former Italy surrendered to the Allies, overthrew their own dictator and got their king back, and began fighting on the other side, as untold amounts of slave laborers from Poland were brought into Germany to work, as people were tortured and murdered in concentration-camps, as an assassination attempt was made on Hitler's life, as Germany suicidally fought on to the bitter end and even began turning against its own loyal citizens, and finally as Germany came under a horrible occupation by the Red Army.

The lessons to be learned from this series truly do serve as a warning from history.  Most people today like to think that such a thing couldn't ever happen again and can't even understand why it happened in the first place, but as it's demonstrated, the Nazis didn't come about and eventually rise to power, wage a world war, and commit horrific atrocities overnight or in a vacuum.

It's clear, to the point, interesting and instructive. What else can you ask of a documentary? Thanks to the BBC again.",1153267200,,427,4.863013698630137
2269716,5,B00097DY66,I don't think I could add much more than what has been reviewed before me. This wonderful documentary had me glued to my tv throughout its entire run. I learned so much about how the nazi party got it's start. I had no clue before hand. I really liked how they showed where alot of these atrocities occured and then showed the exact places as they are today. Truly an errie experience and the sad silence of the places now. You truly can hear the echoes of the souls lost long ago. The interviews are very candid and show alot of people who to this day have no remorse what they were a part of. They still truly believe in Hitler and what he stood for. A must-see for everyone!,1151884800,,677,4.2153846153846155

2269718,5,B00097DY66,"It takes just 5 minutes of Samuels Wests immaculate narration to spellbind you as you take in the remaining 285 minutes minutes of; ""The Nazis: A warning from history"". The BBC shows once again why the Brits reputation for consummate documentary productions is so well earned. Beginning with the opening theme and title backdrop (a little reminiscent of the World at War I must say) the production moves to a prologue taking in some colour footage of Hitler I have never seen in 30 years of watching historical documentaries.

The seemless editing, superb script and overall production values are of the highest quality and it comes as no surprise that Samuel West is picking up so much work as a a narrator. His diction, tone, enunciation and emotional hues bring vitality, rhythm and wonderful intensity to the story in the same way that Oliviers World at War wouldn't have been the same without him.

As an academic exerise I'm sure the production will have its detractors and critics. (Read ""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich by William L Shirer for the definitive account of the Nazis - published by Pan in 1959). Personally I found much of the information revelatory. How many people knew that there was a Marxist takeover of Munich Council just 18 months after the revolution in Russia. And how many would know that while Hitler was invading Poland half of it had been promised to good old Joe Stalin as part of his pact with Hitler?

As Samuel west reminds us in the prologue to this piece. ""To the upper echelons of the Nazi party the explanation for Hitlers rise to power was simple and was directly linked to his superhuman qualities. The real explantion is less simple and far more alarming"". Truth, as they say is stranger than fiction.

Like the politicians and public of the past, todays generation of power brokers can (and some would argue will) exploit the sloth, mendacity and simplistic bigotry of the masses to achieve very undesireable ends. A warning from history indeed.

Trully a well titled and beautifully crafted piece of documentary television.",1144800000,,2076,4.820224719101123
2269719,5,B00097DY66,"The national socialists or known as Nasdp (National Socialist Deutsche Partei) once led by the founder Anton Drexler) became the Nazis under the new leader Adolf Hiedler mispelled by a church pastor as Hitler. A wandering miller named Alois Hiedler was a physical abuser of his son Adolf,never liked that his son got involved in the arts and wanted to be a famous painter in Vienna. Adolf said ""I would have been a car salesman if i was not the fuehrer of deutschland""
  History proved otherwise instead of a car sales man Adolf became like his dad to the extreme. The only love of his life was his german shepard and war.
 Hatred and violence and the almost genocide of the jewish people was hitler's plan from the beginning to the end of the third reich in 1945.
 Today the anti-semitism, the violence, and the hatred of the nazis still continue today in the neo nazi movements like the badenmeinhof. The muslims have learned from their master hitler all to well. In germany recently the muslims had a big sign saying ""Hitler was right"".  tells any person that muslims are nazis. Hitler and his propaganda (lies) infiltrated into middle eastern arab policy and beliefs in the 1930's.
  From what is going on no has learned the warning from history.",1144281600,,1250,4.680365296803653
2269720,5,B00097DY66,"This series is very good a zeroing in on individual Nazis to show how ordinary people did terrible things within the framework of the larger state.  It also does an excellent job of explaining the Nazi world view.  It pays well deserved attention to the importance Hitler placed on ""art"" and culture as well as the way in which social Darwinism was twisted into a culture of lawlessness where the strong were encouraged to exploit, if not destroy, the weak.

Episode 4, ""The Wild East,"" I found particularly thought provoking.  Its portrayal of Gauleiter Arthur Grieser is disturbing and truly ""A warning from history.""

I highly recommend this series.",1127520000,,652,4.944954128440367

8058055,5,B00097DY66,"As someone who has seen most every documentary on the Nazis, as well as having read most of the major books on the subject as well, over several decades, I can say that this documentary--at least to this American viewer-- presented tons of new information, tons of new historical footage, and many new interviews with Germans who were there. It is extremely well put-together by a producer who clearly knows what he is doing, and was a thoroughly compelling, never-boring viewing from beginning to end. Essential to any student of this subject.

Highly recommended.",1511222400,,565,5.01063829787234
8058056,5,B00097DY66,"A very ugly insight into human behavior. The denial people live in is frightening. The interviews with Germans who lived through and were part of the Nazi terror are interviewed. The are also interviews with survivors of the Nazi terror. Even when shown documents bearing their signatures it's always ""I don't know"" or some other excuse. The complicity of the man in the street is clearly evident. A warning from history is a great title. The parallels with what is happening today are again very frightening. Very well done.",1504051200,,525,4.910112359550562
