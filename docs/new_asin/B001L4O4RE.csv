3681195,2,B001L4O4RE,"I will never purchase this collection 'cause my main man RED SKELTON was
a no-show 'cept for a couple brief clips with Lucy as an afterthought. I
will say that PBS did feature him quite extensively in a release a few
years back titled PIONEERS OF PRIMETIME.  Most of the reveiwers hit the
problem here on the head- as I felt as well with PIONEERS- there really
are too many names & too much material to include. Maybe another six volumes would do justice to THE TOPIC.  What's presented is truly great
but something's terribly wrong when you choose to totally ignore
INSULT COMEDY with the likes of Don Rickles & Jack E. Leonard.  For me
tho, SKELTON WAS A GIANT & among his peers considered on another level!!!",1233360000,3,711,4.496124031007752
3681196,3,B001L4O4RE,"It is inconceivable that you could take all of American comedy over the past century and try to cover it in only six 50 minute shows. A geat deal tends to be missed. That is the case with ""Make 'Em Laugh"". A few examples of notable comic omissions are Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle, Harry Langdon, Charlie Chase, Red Skelton (he was seen for a few seconds, but the topic was Lucy), Fred Allen, Fibber McGee and Molly, Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy, Henny Youngman, Milton Berle, Bob Newhart, Rodney Dangerfield, Red Buttons and Bill Cosby. These were some of the biggest stars who should have been included. Abbott and Costello appeared for only a minute in the sixth episode. Yet the Marx Brothers and Lucy were covered twice! Shows omitted include 'The Mary Tyler Moore Show' and 'M*A*S*H'. Also there should have been a section discussing comedy on radio, and a section on the screwball comedies of the 1930's and 1940's.
In order to do this subject justice, twice as many episodes should have been produced. Based on what I saw, the producers barely scratched the surface.",1233273600,3,1074,4.779569892473118
3681197,5,B001L4O4RE,"This 3 disc set contains an hour more that the PBS series which is currently being shown this week 12 January 2009. If you haven't seen it yet catch it ibn re-runs. With six hours of everything on black and white TV from Danny Kaye to Ernie Kovacs you'll want to treasure this for keeps.
Broken into hour-long segments and introduced by Billy Crystal, the clips flow straight-on. Interviews with contemporary writer's and actors dissolve into the routines of past comedians like Larry David and W.C. Fields, .
Extras include:  Carlin on word power; Dick Gregory's advice to Richard Pryor; Jonathan Winters dumbstruck by Robin Williams.",1232064000,7,635,4.990566037735849
3681198,5,B001L4O4RE,"I'll admit right up front, I am a sucker for this stuff. I'll try to write an objective review here, but I have been absolutely loving watching these DVDs over the past few days, so it may be tough.

Focused on comedians known for their television and movies appearances, this is a 2009 PBS documentary on American comedy. Introduced by Billy Crystal, the six 53-minute episodes cover a century of men and women who, as Crystal once said, ""make funny with the ha-ha."" Each show progresses through a series of well-edited film clips of particular stars, which are mixed with appreciative, often enlightening, interviews -- more than 100 in all -- from comedians, producers, writers and historians, everyone from Mort Sahl and Sid Caesar to Judd Apatow and Will Ferrell.

Watching it is sorta like watching the typical PBS program, where you feel so seriously educated you should be stroking your beard. But most is, for me at least, like watching your own mind flashback through all the best moments from the television shows and old movies you watched growing up. What a treat!

From an intellectual standpoint, what I liked best about this series is how well it explores comedy in the first half of the 20th century. For example, the show on satire spends quite a few minutes on Will Rogers, and watching it I really came to appreciate how entertaining he really was, in a way I never had before. Same for Sid Caesar and Tom Lehrer (a performer I had barely heard of), Buster Keaton, Laurel and Hardy and many others.

As a PBS show, this one is, in its own way, every bit as engrossing as a Ken Burns production. Not as long, not as serious, probably not as good, but often just as interesting.

There's certainly as much depth. In the show ""When I'm Bad, I'm Better"" there's a great segment on Moms Mabley. In the show on physical comedy, I personally loved the short segment on Keaton's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sherlock-Jr/dp/B00005QW5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sherlock Jr.</a>&nbsp;In my work, I have learned about this film because it's the basis for the live host in the Walt Disney World attraction The Great Movie Ride. It was a delight just to see someone else mention it!

BONUS FEATURES

Each disc has a set of extras: a collection of 15 or so interview segments that didn't make it into the documentary itself. These aren't very long, just 90 or so, but there is a Play All button, which turns each set into a nice little feature that runs about 20 minutes. On disc two, for example, you get a couple of minutes of noted producer and manager Bernie Brillstein discussing the brilliance of the 1950s Martin and Lewis shows at New York City's Copacabana nightclub, followed by two minutes of Carol Burnett recalling a conversation with Lucille Ball about Desi Arnaz (quoting Ball recalling a time when after she asserted herself ""that's when the put the `s' on my last name""), then George Carlin talking about his mom's sense of language...these go on and on, and are both interesting and easy to watch, especially while you're cooking, doing chores, or, like me now, typing on a laptop.

WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER
On the downside, there are some obvious gaps. Though Jim Carrey and even Jaleel ""Urkel"" White get lots of screen time, nowhere in the six shows is there even a mention of Rodney Dangerfield, David Letterman, Joe E. Lewis or Henny Youngman, or for that matter silent-film stars Charley Chase or Harry Langdon. Also, Red Skelton barely -- and I mean BARELY -- appears! In fairness, however, I should point out that what is here is well edited. To include other comedians without reducing the watchability of the series would have meant another episode or two, something that I bet just wasn't realistic.

EPISODE LIST
Here's a brief description of each episode:

WOULD YA HIT A GUY WITH GLASSES? NERDS, JERKS & ODDBALLS'
The misfit -- including silent film legend Harold Lloyd, Bob Hope, Phyllis Diller, Jonathan Winters, Andy Kaufman, Robin Williams, Cheech & Chong, Woody Allen and Steve Martin.

W.C. Fields, Groucho Marx, Jack Benny, Phil Silvers, Joan Rivers, Paul Lynde, Redd Foxx, Eddie Murphy, Chris Rock and Larry David.

SOCK IT TO ME? SATIRE AND PARODY
For me, this show is the best of them all. It includes clips and discussions of Will Rogers, Abbot and Costello, Sid Caesar, Johnny Carson, Mel Brooks, Laugh In, Saturday Night Live, even Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert.

The series is narrated by Amy Sedaris. Perhaps best known as the star of the 1990s Comedy Central series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Strangers-With-Candy/dp/B000EWBNM8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Strangers With Candy</a>&nbsp;or most recently as the principal in Nickeodeon's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gym-Teacher-The-Movie/dp/B001M0DOSW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gym Teacher: The Movie,</a>&nbsp;she plays it straight here. Fans of those shows will hardly recognize her.

Though PBS purists may not like the relative fast pace of the show, its briskness makes it hard to turn away from. My Amazon reviews usually take about 30 minutes to write. This one has taken three days! I try to type, but keep getting distracted!

By the way, this documentary has a companion book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Make-Em-Laugh-The-Funny-Business-of-America/dp/0446505315/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Make 'Em Laugh: The Funny Business of America.</a>",1231977600,28,6958,5.941

3681200,2,B001L4O4RE,"The good? This is a GREAT documentary (albeit incomplete) about people in the history of ""funny business"".

The bad? This is NOT funny. Granted, the clips shown would normally be funny in their own right, but having seen them 2 or more times makes them just not very funny anymore. And time doesn't allow COMPLETE skits to be shown.

If you want a good documentary of past comics, buy this one.

3681203,1,B001L4O4RE,"Living in Fji, we do not have much access to the latest TV shows and movies.
We were fortunate a couple of months ago to see the ""Make 'Em Laugh"" series on Pay TV here.  It was great to see the old comics and learn so much about their craft.  In particular, we enjoyed the ""Pilot"" sketch with Foster Brooks and Dean Martin.  We have always had a soft spot for Foster Brooks and bought the DVD to have a permanent record of the ""Pilot"".
We watched the series all the way through and it seems that the ""Pilot"" has already flown away!!!!
One wonders how many other scenes were cut from the original series in the making of the DVD.
We will definitley think twice about buying anything from Amazon in future.",1249862400,2,704,4.2781954887218046
3681204,2,B001L4O4RE,"Billy Crystal (who only appears for 60 seconds in the front of each episode) opens the first episode comparing this series to a Ken Burns documentary.  I only wish.

Everything is there- all those classic moments many of us can never forget by this or that favorite comedian.  But no bit or routine is complete.  ""Here's the best 23 frames of Harold Lloyd"", says Amy Sedaris, ""never mind the series of events which led up to this moment and thus are the REASON the bit is brilliant"".  For many, poor Harold Lloyd will be nothing more than a man hanging from a clock.  Amy's narration is excellent by the way.

This series succeeds to do what every examination of the nature of comedy does- Take the funny out.  It takes the funny out, holds it up to a magnifying glass, puts it in a test tube, performs an autopsy, and then forgets how to put the parts back where it found them.  And there you have the problem with the ""serious"" look at comedy.

There is gold to be mined here though.  Comedians being interviewed on their influences is always fascinating.  I sat up and took notice as Bill Marx showed us the secrets of his father's infamous coat.  Wow.  The special features of extended interviews almost outstrips the series.  There is also a joke button where the guests tell their favorite joke.  You'll have to hear the gamut these jokes (and joke tellers)run- from awful to hilarious.

Note to Ken Burns- Your job is safe.",1243900800,7,1430,4.5234375
3681205,1,B001L4O4RE,"Yes, it's nice to trot this material around one more time, and there are anecdotes here that may or may not be new to you.

But Buster Keaton said that comedy is in long shot, and these boneheaded producers chose to zoom in for widescreen and hack off the top and bottom in their clips of both movies and TV.

You can't show physical comedians cut off at the knees. These are full-body performers. You lose the feet, legs and often the hands, as well as the spatial information at the top of the screen. In the scene from ""Animal Crackers"" where policeman Basil Ruysdael pumps Harpo Marx's arm and several hundred knives fall out of his other sleeve, you can hardly see the knives appearing and the entire gag is killed stone dead.

To show the entire frame would have entailed black bars at the sides, but that would have been a lot better than destroying the visuals of Chaplin, Keaton, Lloyd, Fields, Caesar, Ball and just about everybody else who worked in standard format rather than widescreen.

An absolute waste of time. Don't bother.",1242864000,12,1042,4.586021505376344

3681209,5,B001L4O4RE,"I'll admit I was kind of angry that this wasn't on Blu-Ray after watching it on TV in HD.  BUT after ordering it, it still looks really great on regular DVD.  I was very surprised by the quality of clips they managed to get.  Are they missing comedians?  Of course...that's quite inevitable, but they do an excellent job of categorizing the comedians and not making it linear, which could have resulted in the end product being kind of boring.

I'm pursuing my Masters in Film Studies and it's great to have a resource like this at hand for the low price of 25$ (It's since gone up, I notice.  But still well worth the money.)

It comes in a solid box set that folds out to house three discs.  Really high quality product for the price.

It was originally broadcast by PBS and is the kind of light-weight but entertaining stuff that is shown during fund-raising. I didn't buy it; I checked it out of the local library, and am glad I didn't spend the money. It's worth watching once if you have nothing else to do.

My copy of this documentary is excellent as it contains not only the actual documentary, but lots of extra, and extended, interviews with the many comedy geniuses featured in the main program. There are three discs in this boxed set, and each one contains two episodes, plus extra interviews.

I really enjoyed this entire program as it documents a history of the progress of comedy performances in the video domain, from the early days of silent films, through to the early days of television, and on up to the present digital video world. There are explanations about how comedy ideas evolved, what worked, and what didn't work, what made the comedy stars unique in their particular presentations and styles, how certain characters were developed and how the popularity of those characters, both in film and on the tele endeared them to millions of viewers all around the world, and how the work of the earliest performers influenced those who followed and continues to this day.

It also gave me an opportunity to glimpse many performances that I was never able to see, as Australian TV only started in 1956, and didn't really get going properly until 1960. I was only born in 1960, so I missed lots of the stuff highlighted in this program. In fact even as a child of the 60's and seeing some of this material back then, I didn't even understand, or actually get the jokes until reruns! Now I get it and it is even funnier today.

So thank you to Rhino for making this documentary, and thanks to Amazon.com for making it available.",1320364800,,1795,4.670886075949367
