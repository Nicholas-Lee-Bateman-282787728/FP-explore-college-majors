1629471,5,B00005MNHA,"You WILL sweat with this one!  Minna does a great job at giving you a tough workout with out lots of fancy foot work.  Adding lots of plyometric jumps will increase your strength and over all muscle tone lots quicker than just doing step aerobics or weights alone.  You actually FEEL accomplished at the end of the workout!
Strenght and Grace is a nice alternative for a day you want to be challange but you don't want to work as hard.
You WILl see results with this one!",1022284800,3,471,4.329545454545454
1629472,4,B00005MNHA,"This is my first DVD workout and I can say Im not dissapointed.
I love the strength and grace portion cause it's not high impact but will give you a good sweat. Actually both segments will give u an excellent sweat. The only problem is with the fat eliminator, after doing it a couple of times my knee ached. But overall, highly recommended just be extra careful with your knees.",1019606400,5,379,4.428571428571429
1629473,5,B00005MNHA,"This DVD is great! Minna gives very good instructions but doesn't talk too much and is not too bubbly. The exerices are easy to follow but really work the muscles. I really like how it has alternating strength and cardio segments. The bonus section with weights targeting abs, legs, and arms is also good and only 15 minutes long. I have been looking for a good combination workout that gives me enough of a cardio workout but adds strenght training too and this is it.",1017187200,,469,4.529411764705882
1629474,5,B00005MNHA,"I highly recommend this exercise video to everyone and anyone who wants to get into shape.  I bought this along with her quick fix tape and I really love them.  I taught aerobics for 8 years, so I am not a beginner and I know what will work.  THIS WORKS.  Minna is one of the best instructors out there.  She doesn't get on your nerves and I thought at first that 30 minutes wouldn't be much of a workout, but ten minutes into it was enough to change that attitude.  What I really like is that it is customizeable.  So you won't get bored(which I do quite often with exercize tapes).  I strongly, highly recommend this tape along with her Quick fix tape.  That is all you will need to work out everything on your body effectively.  I have several workout dvd's and these are the only ones that I use.
Have a great workout.:)",1016755200,3,824,4.258064516129032
1629475,5,B00005MNHA,"I really like this DVD because it is divided into 2 separate workouts of 45 minutes each.  I wake up at 5am and workout for 45 minutes so this fits into my schedule perfectly.  The Fat Eliminator is AMAZING in that it is an intense cardio workout that not only gets the heart pumping, but it also gives you a great strength workout.  I used to belong to a gym for 5 years and did cardio for 2 hours, 4-5 days per week.  I now do my own workout using a treadmill, two of Kathy Smith's step aerobics tapes, Crunch--Total Yoga and now Minna's Fat Eliminator and Stength and Grace.  I have to say that if you are a beginner, the Strength and Grace portion is Ok as it combines ballet and yoga moves, but the Fat Eliminator section may be a little hard on you as my quads were hurting the next day and I am not a beginner.  Overall, I think this is a GREAT workout.",1014076800,13,860,4.089285714285714
1629476,5,B00005MNHA,"I really love this DVD because it is very well-rounded.  I like doing the aerobic ""Fat Eliminator"" in the morning because it is very energizing and not too lengthy (30 min.) The optional ""Blast the Fat"" segment is a great add-on to the previous workout (an additional 15 min.) or you can do it alone if you're in a real time crunch.  ""Strength and Grace"" is a yoga-based workout that focuses on strength exercises combined with deep breathing and stretching.  It is truly unique.  I enjoy doing this one before bed because it is very relaxing towards the end.  It is a great stress reliever and it will help you to look great too!  I started this program 1 month after abdominal surgery (with my doctor's permission, of course) so I was kind of out of shape when I started it.  It is about 3 weeks later and I can't tell you how much stronger I am and how much better I feel.  I almost didn't mention I'm looking better too!  I give this DVD an A+ !!!",1012521600,5,951,4.297752808988764
1629477,3,B00005MNHA,"I enjoyed the DVD, and I like the fact that you have an upper and lower body workout on one DVD.  But it was relatively easy, and I was looking for something more challenging.
The workout is in a nice setting and is in the form of an instructional class (Minna Lessig in front with around four individuals behind).  It's different and interesting, but I did not find it very challenging (I found the advanced buns of steel a much more intense leg/buns workout).
On a personal note, I found it really irritating that all of the class had permanent, fake smiles glued to their faces for the entire workout DVD...!",1003104000,12,611,4.495495495495495
1629518,5,B00005MNHA,"I just want to start by saying I love Minna! I bought this DVD at a second hand store for $1.99 & it has become a serious staple in my workout collection. I have to admit that I prefer the fat eliminator with the bonus 15 min. Strength & grace is good, however I prefer fat eliminator.

Minna talks you through the whole workout while she too, completes each move of the workout. She is calm & I enjoy listening to her. As with any other workout regimen, it is imperative for the viewer to focus on the muscles they are working & their form. If done properly, this workout is great!!!! I absolutely recommend this DVD!",1422057600,,618,4.282051282051282
1629519,4,B00005MNHA,"I absolutely love the fat burning workout along with the 15-minute toning bonus, but do not use the mixed yoga portion of the video. I'm not an exercise buff so it took me about a week and a half to get the fat burning workout down. I can do the complete workout without fumbling or having to stop. The yoga workout seems very difficult to follow, especially for someone as uncoordinated as myself. In my opinion, it is definitely worth the money for the other two workouts alone. I also recommend the emergency workout for the toning portion. If you like to run or walk, it is a perfect workout to use along with that.",1398643200,,619,4.391304347826087
1629520,5,B00005MNHA,"I first owned and worked out to both Strength & Grace and The Fat Eliminator after I gave birth to my son... almost 13 years ago. Now, all these years later I needed something to help get back into fighting form and was so happy to see both workouts on this one DVD (because I owned VHS tapes, it was that long ago!). I look forward to becoming reacquainted with the workouts since they were so good for me the first time (and I have a feeling history will repeat itself since I just finished The Fat Eliminator and want to lay on the floor and smile at the same time). I recommend these workouts for anyone who also is in a time crunch and looking for something that is pretty good to the joints as well. Also, Minna is a great instructor in her videos.",1387756800,3,754,4.171232876712328

1629524,5,B00005MNHA,In the last 10 years I have lost and gained and lost again. I always come back to this DVD. The 30 minute circuit workout combines strength and cardio. I love it. You get your heart racing and feel 'the burn' in you muscles. If you don't have access to a gym I highly recommend this DVD. Even if you do have a membership this DVD is a great at home option. You will sweat everytime!,1351036800,2,382,4.0394736842105265
1629525,5,B00005MNHA,I have looked everywhere for the Fat Eliminator Workout that i had on VHS- I love it -it went by quick and definately was a good workout- i always felt more toned after- it definately made a difference:) i'm glad i found it in dvd format on this duo -i look forward to trying out the other wkout that comes in this set:),1250467200,,320,4.095238095238095
1629526,4,B00005MNHA,"this CD came in excellent condition an is a great workout. There are 2 different workouts on it and one mini for days when you don't have a lot of time. Minna is a great instructor, exercises are easy to follow.",1249603200,,211,4.170731707317073
1629527,4,B00005MNHA,"The cardio/strength training portion of this DVD is very challenging.  For those of you like me that enjoy working out but aren't in peak physical condition, you will find this moderately difficult.  It is really good to grow with, however, if you can stick with it.

The yoga/stretching portion of the DVD is much more basic.  You can definitely feel results, but it's not nearly as intense as the cardio section.

The great thing about Minna's workouts is that she pays attention to every part of the body.  You're not just working one muscle group--you're bettering your whole body's tone, look, and feel.  Minna is an enjoyable instructor who is encouraging without being annoying.  Her backup participants are actually quite entertaining to watch as well.",1227571200,,760,5.024
1629557,5,B00005MNHA,This is one of the best exercise videos I've seen.  Tones the entire body with moves that are easy to learn yet challenging.  Great for the beginner or experienced.  Music is good and motivating.  Best of all you will see results after only a few days of exercising to this video.  That will keep you motivated.  Great product.  You will not regret buying it.,1207353600,2,359,4.515625
1629558,5,B00005MNHA,"This is a great cardio workout.  It reminds me of aerobic/kick boxing type class in the gym, but she has her own twist on exercise.  I own 4 of her DVDs and love all of them. This is the hardest workout of them all. If you do them on a regular basis, you will definitely see results that others notice and want!  The Yoga segment is definitely enjoyable to strengthen your core muscles.  A great contrast to the cardio workout.  I would definitely recommend!",1196035200,,458,4.404761904761905
1629559,5,B00005MNHA,"This is what got me hooked on Minna, and I absolutely love BOTH of the workouts on this video.  In VHS format, these are actually two different videos.  On DVD, they are on the one disc, but you still do them separately.  Or pair them - they compliment each other perfectly.

One (""Fat Elimnator"") is a very tough, but totally enjoyable, fat burner done in very quick-paced intervals of cardio and muscle shaping. very different from any other workout I own (and I own dozens and more!!)and therefore good to break up ""workout video"" boredom.  It is 30 minutes that is very intense and will have you gasping and sweating and totally satisfied in your 30 minute endeavor.  Time extremely well spent!
The other (""Strength and Grace"") is a really cool take on traditional yoga, taking those relaxing, stretching moves and mixing in strength moves like reverse lunges and squats to invoke a nice muscle burn too.  By the end (also 30 minutes)you feel strong, and ""worked out"" and yet relaxed and haooy with a different kind of progress in your health. In summary this one makes you feel that yoga relaxation for your MIND without making you wonder if it will actually do anything for your BODY (it sure will).
Bottom line: Minna rocks!  Buy it!",1187913600,,1240,4.682027649769585
1629560,5,B00005MNHA,"I thought at first this is a terrible workout. But, then I wanted to give it one more chance and then I noticed I was not putting forth the effort like I should have been. I worked out for approximately 1-1/2 months and lost 8 inches in my waist line and hips and lost 20lbs. Of course, this was on a meal plan as well. Like Minna says ""do this program on a regular basis and watch your body change"". It's the truth!!!!!
As far as the grace & strength- Excellent for strengthening the joints and ligaments within your body and allowing your body to relax. I have horrible knees and this program really digs deep.",1184544000,,612,4.2844827586206895
1629561,5,B00005MNHA,"A few years ago, when I was living in my parent's basement by myself, I bought my first workout DVD (a Quick Fix 10-minute workout) and liked it so much, I decided to check out the individual instructors and see if any of them had their own DVDs. I bought this double-workout disc and never regretted it for a second. I have a low tolerance for excessively peppy instructors and Minna exudes a nice balance between cheerful encouragement and remaining a real human being.

When I moved into an apartment and didn't feel comfortable jumping and squatting in the living room in front of my roommates, I joined a gym and stored my collection of DVDs. I recently started working out at home again, and have rediscovered this video. I think I love it even more now. I feel so good when I am done with either section, and sometimes I do parts or all of both back-to-back.

Highly recommended - for a great balance of toning, aerobic exercise and an interesting spin on yoga and pilates.",1171756800,2,980,4.531073446327683
1629562,5,B00005MNHA,"ORDER THIS!!  I was introduced to Minna after after seeing and doing a brief workout with the Fitness/Exercise On Demand Channel.  After doing this routine a few times, I soon ordered the DVD and haven't been disappointed.  It is an incredibly wonderful workout for fat burning.  The added Bonus 15 minute training for abs really hits the spot (ouch! in a good way).  I especially liked the Grace and Balance portion.  Minna is concise and uplifting in that she provides a different type of cardio workout.  The routine is not boring and very doable.  You can start out slower if you need to and work your way up to her speed (which is what I did).  I am very happy I ordered this DVD and you will too.",1166832000,2,702,4.421875
1629563,5,B00005MNHA,"This is a great DVD...Strength and Grace is challenging and restorative...it really strengthens, stretches and energizes my body. The aerobics section is fun and challenging...this is one of my favorite exercise DVDS",1155254400,2,216,5.78125
1629564,5,B00005MNHA,Minna is the best workout video I've bought in a long time. She's awesome to cue you and she's super hot. The moves go with the music and it's always a challenge. There's no cheating with Minna!,1148947200,3,194,4.27027027027027

1629566,5,B00005MNHA,"The back cover reads,(""The spicy Latin music will keep you moving all the way through!). The music is more along the lines of ""80's club techno music"".

1629598,5,B00005MNHA,"I am very picky about the type of workout DVDs I use, and this is by far my favorite.  Granted, I really only ever do the Fat Eliminator routine, but it is excellent.  Great mix of cardio and toning.  Minna Lessig really packs a lot into 30 minutes.  I always feel like I've had a great workout when I'm done.  I highly recommend!!",1106179200,2,331,4.190476190476191

1629600,5,B00005MNHA,"Two Words, LOVE IT

I've been doing as much of this video I can for about 4 weeks now and I've definitely noticed a more perkier butt and more toned thighs. Overall I just feel really good about myself and what i've acomplished with this video. In the beginning I had a hard time getting through to circuit 2 but I can proudly say that I can do the whole thing! (although it's not easy)My whole body looks more toned and my friends have noticed. I think that anyone who makes this video a commitment will do really well with it. I can't wait to see what Minna comes out with next!",1096848000,6,580,4.178571428571429
1629601,4,B00005MNHA,"This DVD will get you sweating in a hurry. I really like the interval training  in the Fat Eliminator segment. Alternating strength and cardio segments does make the workout go by quickly, which is a plus for this reluctant exerciser! Minna is excellent at cueing and I like her demeanor. The only thing I really don't like about it (and why it is not a 5-star video for me) is all of the jumping. It is definitely NOT low-impact. If you have knee problems, find another video!",1092614400,19,477,4.482758620689655
1629602,5,B00005MNHA,"Two great workouts from a wonderful instructor. In Strength & Grace (45 mins), you alternate classic calisthenics, like lunges and plie squats, with yoga postures. I love this workout b/c (1) You don't need sneakers or supportive gear; (2) You may not need a shower afterwards; and (3) You'll still really know that you've worked yourself out! I have Day Off workouts, like gentle mat work yoga/pilates--and this is a lot tougher! But, it's not all-out blitz, either. It's just right!

 Fat Eliminator is 35 mins. of challenge. You do intervals of 1.5 mins of strength moves with 2.5 mins of cardio. (Six intervals total.) Minna continually motivates, and the fact that you're quickly moving through the intervals is also motivating. Just when you think you can't take any more, she throws in a fairly easy interval, where you can catch your breath and gather steam for the finish. Afterwards, there's a 15-minute Blast the Fat toning workout for arms, butt, legs, and abs. Use light hand weights. You can also do this separately, but I always just append it onto Fat Burning.

 The students are cheerful, hardworking, and physically diverse. They're the best students I've seen! The set is bright, modern, and cheerful. I had never put much stock in students or sets, but you'll see in this DVD how they further enhance an already-great production. Highly recommend.",1091059200,10,1367,4.956331877729258
1629603,5,B00005MNHA,"This is definitely a must-have DVD. You are getting 30 mins of cardio/toning, 15 mins of toning and 45 mins of traditional yoga/toning.

This will really tone that lower body! I have noticed my thighs and rear end getting tighter and leaner. Minna is great on cueing and giving instructions on some moves before you do them. I sweat everytime with this video even though I feel like I'm not putting forth that much effort. The choreography is basic but you  can easily add intensity by exaggerating those power movements. I'm really pleased with this DVD and enjoy doing it 3x a week. I do my own upper body routine but like I said before, this is great for toning the lower body. I'm not very coordinated either but this one I can follow very easily. So, if you like interval aerobics, this is a surprisingly energetic routine. LOTS of plyometric moves so get your lungs ready. 2 1/2 min of cardio (plyo) interspersed with 1 1/2 min of toning (squats, side leg lifts). Minna's cueing is good, and has a pleasant personality.  Highly recommended!",1090627200,,1046,4.643243243243243
1629604,4,B00005MNHA,"I won't lie.  I hate this workout.  Why?  Because it is HARD.  But I still do it.  Why?  Because it works.  I have become stronger, more toned, pulled in and energized.
This is one video that after you learn the routine either put it on mute or turn your back to the television and just listen to her.  It simply takes up entirely too much of your energy to do both.  And believe me, you want to get through the workout.
If you don't like loads of leg work this isn't for you.  There is a lot of plyometric jumping.  Your quads will BURN like crazy (still worth it!) so beware.
The second portion is awful.  I never use it EVER.  There are so many other quality toning routine videos out there that do so much more for your body, are less confusing and make you want to come back and do it tomorrow.  The cover boasts Pilates.  If you're going to do pilates, go all the way.  For this I am an advocate of the Crunch Series and Jennifer Kries' pilates videos.",1086998400,2,958,4.1530054644808745
1629605,4,B00005MNHA,"These workouts are a part of my 14-day exercise rotation.  I realy enjoy the 15 minute blaster workout she puts at the end of the first workout.  The only reason why I gave the dvd four stars is because I really didn't feel the strength and grace workout working!  However the first workout is a killer!  I am at an intermediate/advanced level, and I had to take a breather.  Recommended.",1074384000,,388,4.485714285714286
1629606,5,B00005MNHA,"This is an excellent video for someone who wants to get fit and lean without fancy dance steps.  I bought this DVD because of the good reviews given to it by others and I was not dissapointed.  The music wasn't overpowering, the backup people weren't annoying, and Minna wasn't overly peppy.  I cannot stand it to watch super-perky instructors that stare at you like a frightened deer and give off this attitude like if you don't do the steps they'd shoot you in the feet.
My favorite workout on this DVD is the ""Fat Eliminator"" segment.  It combines strength moves and cardio for a balanced workout that you can really feel.  After over 2 months of doing this video at least 4 times a week, I still find myself sweaty but energized after doing it.  This segement has a lot of jumping, lunges, and squats, so if you have weak legs or knees then be careful and watch your form.  I am a totally un-coordinated clutz when it comes to dancing or any complicated moves, but these moves were straightforward and I picked them up right away.  I actually liked this DVD so much that I bought a copy of the ""Fat Eliminator"" video for my friend and now she does it every day.  I am 5'4"" and used to weigh 128 lbs and now weigh 124 lbs.  Yah, 4 pounds doesn't seem like much to most people, but I am a lot leaner and muscle weighs more than fat.  My waist was 29-30"" and flabby and it is now a tighter firmer 27.5""-28"".  My flabby but was 39"" and it is now a very firm 37"".  I started doing this video without a specific goal, and just wanted to see what I could do with my body if I did it 4 or 5 days a week.  I eat a well balanced diet (which I did before, but I still sat around too much), so I guess don't expect results if you still eat garbage.  I have so much energy now that I just want to tell everyone to go out and buy this video!  I can't wait for Minna to come up with a few more videos like this!
Oh I guess I should say a thing or two about the ""Strength and Grace"" portion of this.  I have only done this part a few times mostly because I find this segment to be a lot of yoga.  It does have some good pilates in it.  It almost feels like you're not doing a workout when you are doing it sometimes, but other times you can really feel the burn.  I almost find myself more tired after doing this portion because it really challenges the muscles.  If you are a fan of Pilates and Yoga, then you should like the ""Strength and Grace"" portion.
I also own Minna's Emergency Workout but I don't use that one quite so much because it is longer and the cardio requires that you do some salsa and mambos and I am a clutz.  I also recommend ""I want that Body"" by Tamilee Webb for some extra sculpting exercises if you want to really firm up.  I do that DVD almost as much as I do the Minna DVD.  This is a program that works.  Try it!",1066176000,30,2829,4.063176895306859
1629647,5,B00005MNHA,"I first became familiar with Minna from the Quick Fix Total Mix DVD - which I love as well - and thought I'd check out some of her other fitness DVD's. I bought this workout based on the great reviews it received here at Amazon. I wasn't disappointed!
The two segments that comprise this DVD are both 45 minutes long. The Fat Eliminator is 30 plus a 15 minute spot exercise/hand weight segment that follows. The Strength and Grace segment is a full 45 minutes. The Fat Eliminator segment is set up in several circuits designed to gradually build you up to a peak heart rate and then bring you down again - both within each individual circuit segment as well as all circuit segments combined as a whole. I like this quite a bit because although each circuit is challenging, you are given an opportunity to breathe and grab a swig of water in between each without feeling like you are going to fall over and die. The Strength and Grace segment of the DVD is non-cardio, but active enough and a lot of fun. There's also something special about this second segment that I've not experienced in other  workout and fitness tapes - it leaves you feeling peaceful and grounded even though you know you've just challenged yourself a bit.
You can do each 45 minute workout by itself but I've also done both back to back for a total hour and a half routine with no problem simply because the two workouts are so different in activity and focus in a way that is very complimentary - or, as the title clearly states: a balanced blend. Even after doing both workouts back to back, I didn't feel over-exerted or exhausted. In fact, you hardly feel like you've worked out at all... at frist. However, let me tell ya - you really feel the effects of what you did the next day! I'm an intermediate/advanced fitness level but this workout targeted muscles I clearly haven't used in a long time - and it felt great!
This is one of those rare programs that actually make you look forward to your daily workout because it's fun, challenging, has a calming and grounding effect and leaves you feeling peacefully energized but is also easy to do for all fitness levels. I can't recommend it enough!",1062892800,9,2174,4.50379746835443

1629650,4,B00005MNHA,Good beginners - intermediate workout ( in order to keep the intensity up I usually exercise with light dumbbells ). If you have knee problems you'll have to modify a couple of exercises in the fat burning section.,1056931200,3,214,4.657894736842105
1629651,3,B00005MNHA,"When I first got this video, I enjoyed it very much. It IS a great pair of workouts, and Minna is a very comfortable instructor -- warm and not at all grating. But I only give it 3 stars because, well, it's BORING. The music stinks (but that's true of most exercise tapes) and after doing it a few times I'd had enough. I never use it now. By contrast, my other tapes -- Tamilee Webb, Leslie Sansone and Kathy Smith -- get almost daily use. So to sum up, this one's like yukky medicine -- no fun, but very good for you.",1053388800,5,519,4.048543689320389
1629652,5,B00005MNHA,I love this DVD because there are two very different workouts. Both are moderate to difficult depending on you and your intensity. One workout is strength/aerobic while the other is strength/yoga. I love it!!,1046649600,,208,5.147058823529412
1629653,3,B00005MNHA,Minna does a relatively good workout but I was quite taken back by her attire.  Some shots it seems I can almost see her navel.  I just don't want to see that much of anyone but my husband.  I'm a bit embarrassed for her.,1043712000,3,221,3.977272727272727
1629654,4,B00005MNHA,"The way this workout is broken up really helps the time to go by. It works the muscles and gets the heart rate going. It's also a shorter workout for time conscientious exercisers. The only thing I don't like are the pasted on smiles in the background. Also, if you can't handle jumping jacks, you may have skip one circuit.",1038355200,,324,4.416666666666667
1629655,5,B00005MNHA,"I love this DVD.  The Fat Eliminator is extremely effective, and I love the bonus weight section.  The Stregth and Grace workout is intense and soothing all at once.  I have lost a dress size in about a month, gained a great amount of leg toning and core strength.
One note about the nay-sayers who think that this is not good for intermediate level and up--If you are watching and improving your form, this workout is very tough.  Just as I master it I return my focus to proper form, my own resistance and using my own energy, and it becomes very challenging and I'm sweating far more than before.  It gets more challenging as time goes on provided you are interested in doing the exercises properly, rather than blazing through it.  I've got the tone to prove it!
Though the smiles of her ""girls"" in the background are a little eerie if not unsettling to begin with, you'll learn to ignore it.  Far more important is the high quality, not irritating motivational instruction you get from Minna.  She is amazing!  Buy this DVD!",1034726400,6,1029,4.548913043478261
1629656,5,B00005MNHA,"I purchased this video to compliment my yoga/pilates work.  It was a little intense to begin with, but I have enjoyed great results.  The length is perfect, not too long, not too short.  In fact, I have dropped my personal trainer's workout as I have seen better results from just 6 weeks with Minna!  Strength and Grace is a great segment for days I don't have the energy for the Fat Blast.  I highly recommend this DVD!",1032566400,5,421,4.415584415584416
