345882,4,6301646053,"...the overall effect of the film overcomes its faults. To be blunt, you need a heart of stone not to be touched by it.  Bruce Willis can be a devastating actor when he wants to, and here, he clearly wants to. You would think there would be a surplus of films about war orphans, but this is one of the few.  The fact that it is a young girl adds to the poignancy and multi-layered dimensions. Got lumped in with the other Vietnam films of the time like Platoon, Full Metal Jacket and Hamburger Hill, when in fact it has only a few wartime scenes, and is in fact more like the brilliant Coming Home.",1044489600,16,598,4.191304347826087

345884,5,6301646053,Moving drama about 18 year old daughter(Emily Lloyd) of father who was killed in Vietnam. Outstanding performances with solid cast especially Willis. Film is a living testament also to the geographical differences during Vietnam War as there was more political support for the troops and the cause in the south and midwest as opposed to the East and West coasts. Final scene takes place on location at actual Vietnam Wall in Washington.,1014508800,3,436,5.069444444444445
345885,5,6301646053,"In the almost 30 years since returning from my second tour of duty in Vietnam, I've consciously avoided ""Vietnam flicks.""  Time and again, I was told by others that these were either hopelessly superficial or hopelessly biased -- and usually both.
Based on a tip, I bought ""In Country"" some time again and have finally gotten around to watching it.  My reaction is that, among films of the ""post-Vietnam"" genre, ""In Country"" is probably as good and true as anything that's likely to come out of Hollywood.  Both the sentimentalism and the GI-bashing are admirably minimized.  The plot is a little thin but still a good one, and the characters are likeable and reasonably credible.
Bruce Willis is superb.  As the Big Name, he could almost be forgiven for stealing every scene.  And yet, perhaps because of an empathy for Vets of the type he represents, he seems to understand that ""stealing scenes"" is the very last thing a troubled Vietnam veteran would typically do.
The casting of the English girl Emily Lloyd as Samantha was a stoke of genius.  I'm not sure if there are many real girls like ""Sam""; but if there are, they must be very like the Emily Lloyd character.  Lloyd convinced me that Sam cares deeply.  Moreover, I think that young Emily must be one of the prettiest girls ever to star in a film.
If you're a vet from 'Nam, convinced that Hollywood has nothing good to say about you, please give ""In Country"" a chance.  If you're not a vet, try the film anyway (and what a shame the movie isn't available on DVD!).  You'll see two fine actors at the top of their form.  Also, you just might learn something.",983923200,52,1619,4.583333333333333
345886,5,6301646053,"This highly underrated movie is a treasure.  I have watched it at least a dozen times.  Emily Lloyd is unforgettable as the daughter of a soldier who was killed in Vietnam before she was born.  Her post-high school search for  a post-death relationship with him makes this film is unbearably moving and  powerful.  It is inexplicable why it is so unknown.  Bruce Willis is at his  best as a subtly and irreparably damaged Viet vet.  The closing scene with  the Vietnam Memorial tears me apart every time.  This movie is the other  anthem to our Viet vets.

346008,5,6301646053,I have watched this film several times and frankly I do not understand  the criticism it has drawn. I knew men who had served in VietNam and they were very like the Bruce Willis character. Every man who served In Country came home changed in some way. A friend of mine told me about an experience when he was in a grocery store. In the next isle over he heard a woman speaking vietnamese. He immediately dropped to a crouch and reached for his sidearm which fortunately he no longer wore..... I live in Kentucky. I know little towns like the one shown in the film. I am neither embarassed or offended by the way these folks were portrayed. Such as they could probably be found in every small town in America. Take the film for what it is. A very moving portrayal about survivors from a horrible time and the people who loved them.,1372118400,,830,4.354838709677419

Parts of movies that I have seen - from the ""famous"" to the trash - have either brought up bad memories or were insulting to those who actually served there. ""In Country"" was different. It brought back memories (not good ones, but important ones) of how I felt on coming back to ""The World"" without making the vet look like a rabid dog or a complete basket case.

346047,5,6301646053,"""In Country"" was a contemporary film on initial release in 1989 but it has not dated one bit.  It depicts an important turning point in our country's history when we were trying to come to grips with the aftershocks of the Vietnam conflict.  The setting is small town Kentucky where the wounds inflicted by the war are still raw.  The townsfolk try to sweep the pain under the rug and even the returnees attempt in vain to forget about it.  Only Sam(Emily Lloyd) wants more light shed on the events everybody wants to vanish becuase she wants to know more about the father she never knew and what he did over there.  The film culminates in an emotional visit to the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington where the names etched in black granite say more than a thousand speeches.  Lloyd, a British actress who was excellent in ""Wish You Were Here"", acquits herself well here.  The key to the film's success in my mind is Bruce Willis who portrays her Uncle Emmitt, a psychically scarred veteran.  Willis' role here is smallish but no less important.  Emmitt suffers from post-traumatic stress syndrome but Willis' acoount of him is understated and honest.  His work here runs through the film's fabric and if it were misplayed the message here would have been undermined.  ""In Country"" is as important a film as more recognizable ones like ""Coming Home"" or ""The Deer Hunter"".",1273968000,,1371,4.718487394957983
346048,5,6301646053,"I have viewed the film,""In Country,"" and have read the book by Bobbie Ann Mason on which it is based. The film is an accurate and moving adaptation of the novel. The period of the Vietnamese War comes alive on screen as it was lived by the soldiers and as it affected the families on the homefront. Bruce Willis and Emily Lloyd are agonizingly effective as two Kentuckians caught up the war. The final episode at the Viet Nam Memorial in Washington is one of the most powerful and breath-taking scenes I have ever seen in a film.",1225152000,,529,4.408163265306122
346049,1,6301646053,"I had to write a research paper on the book, which was a decent read, so I thought I would watch the movie as well. The movie is one of the worst things I have ever seen. It takes the sterotypical representation of southerners and makes it ten times worse than ever imagined. Also, I really expected Bruce Willis to bring life to the character of Emmet, but that was not the case. His performance takes all of the life out of the character and turns him into a grouchy, sullen and jerk of a man. Emily Lloyd takes the character of Sam and turns her into a half-retarded hillbilly with no personality whatsoever. This movie took a decent book and turned it into a bland, boring and insulting movie. Dont waste your time watching this movie, read the book instead. The book brings Emmett to life as a quirky, humorous man who struggles with some very serious issues after returning from the war. His friends who have also been to Vietnam are also represented quite well in the book, yet the movie turns them into a bunch of tacky, illiterate fools with overplayed southern accents. Leave it to Hollywood to take a good book and turn it into a train wreck that is this movie.",1207526400,2,1172,4.430555555555555
346050,5,6301646053,"Amazon suggested I write a review on this beautifully done movie, one for which I think Bruce Willis and Emily Lloyd deserved Emmies for their performances.  That recent reviews have panned the movie are a testament to the failure of history--forget it, and you will repeat it.  And that is what is happening with America's new crop of discouraged veterans lost in the sea of a society that does not understand or care, and a federal institution (Veteran's Affairs) flooded with workers still trying to rid themselves of Viet Nam vets and fearful of the new vets.

Buy the movie, watch it with family and friends, read the book (which is a totally wonderful read), and try to find empathy for those struggling with the unseen losses of the wars.

Forget the reviews that pan the movie or the book; and most of all, remember it is fiction not history you are watching.  If you want to know the plot, read the other longer reviews; I am writing this to rebut the negative reviews only.

Again, this movie is too good to miss.

346052,3,6301646053,"While almost no adaptation is page-for-page from the novel, most follow the original story, removing sequences that can be removed. Some cinematic versions of original works, though, require a different story altogether. ""In Country"" is one of those, but we never see that other story.

The novel concerns Sam, who lives with her Vietnam vet uncle, is finishing high school and wondering about the next sixty years of her life. The action takes place in their small town, until Sam, Uncle and her maternal grandmother travel many hundreds of miles in a VW bug convertible to see The Wall in D.C., on which is inscribed the name of Sam's father and, of course, her grandmother's son.

In my opinion that journey is the cinematic story, but we never see it. At the end, which is quite beautiful, Grandma reaches out to touch the engraved letters of her son's name, but we really know nothing about her. Up until that point we see her only as a caricature of a farm wife. Had she been a main character we might have seen the further ripples of Vietnam, or any war, which is to say the ones that tend to be invisible.

This is not a bad movie, and is technically impressive. It would have been easier HAD it been bad, though, since watching a real clinker is less irritating than watching what could have been really something.",1094083200,3,1323,4.5974576271186445
346053,3,6301646053,"This is one of those movies best seen on a lazy Sunday afternoon with nothing else to do. It is a thoughtful character study that creeps up on you and really gets under the skin.
Bruce Willis wisely downplays all of his usual acting schtick (much like he did in Terry Gilliam's Twelve Monkeys). He delivers a truly heartfelt performance as an emotionally damaged Vietnam veteran. Pay close attention to what he does in this movie -- he uses his very expressive face to convey a wide spectrum of emotions that brings across the inner turmoil that is going on in his character.
In Country is told from the perspective of Emily Lloyd's character. She is a naive, young girl who wants to know more about the war that took her father away from her and can't understand why her father's friends are so unwilling to talk about their experiences. This is her best performance of her, so-far, short career.
But, let's be honest, this film belongs to Willis and deservedly so. He's the kind of actor who needs a strong director to reign him in and Norman Jewison is that kind of a filmmaker. He really gets a wonderful performance out of Willis that is wrenching, funny, sad and everything in between.
This an excellent character-driven film set in small-town America much like the equally underappreciated Robert De Niro-Ed Harris drama, Jacknife. In Country examines how war not only effects those who fought in it but also the people around them after they return home.
Sadly, the DVD has nothing in the way of extras (a commentary track by Jewison or the book's author, Bobbie Ann Mason, would have been nice) and is also presented in pan and scanned mode. Too bad.",1078272000,18,1659,4.665529010238908

Her veteran Uncle Emmit (Willis) is unwilling to help, but she continues searching, eventually talking to Emmit and his other veteran friends.

Hopewell,VA is two hours south of DC and the Wall which the daughter and family visit for close sure and that is the real reason to watch this great movie.
