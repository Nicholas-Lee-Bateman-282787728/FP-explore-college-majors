2691060,5,B000KGGOP4,"With three little ones in the house its hard to catch anything on tv that isn't a cartoon.  My husband and I are hooked on this reality show which is still on TLC.  Once you start watching it you want to see more. You can learn so much from the Roloff family.  I have been waiting for them to come out with these DVD's by season.  I'm excited to see they are putting out season one and hope that they continue release all of the seasons here on after.  I plan on introducing this program to my children as they get older (my oldest is 6).  You get a better understanding of what ""little people"" go through in our big world.  It's really neat watching all of the Roloff children grow up.  You won't regret it pre-order your DVD today!",1189036800,13,733,4.185714285714286
2691061,5,B000KGGOP4,"Season-1 is available in a packaged set, of 3 hours and 40 minutes of run-time, direct from The Learning Channel for $25.

Amazon has divided the ""Little People"" episodes, into sixteen half-episodes, and called them ""episodes"". Amazon is selling these half-episodes for $22 each. The Learning Channel offers selected, individual, full-episodes for $2 each. You have to buy two, half-episodes at Amazon for $22 each, to equal one full episode at TLC for $2. Amazon is charging you 22 times the price of TLC.

If you buy the 16 half-episodes of season-1, here at Amazon, at $22 each, that equals $352. The full season-1 is available at TLC for $25. Amazon is charging you $327 more, for the same thing.

If you bought a DVD from the series here, you should demand Amazon give you a refund, including shipping and handling both ways, because Amazon concealed the short run-time-length to mislead you, and Amazon misrepresented half-episodes as ""episodes"" to mislead you.

I emailed Amazon several times, saying I would like to buy this item, but the price is 22 times the normal price. Amazon ignored me.

Amazon's extreme price-gouging implies ""Little People"" fans are dummies, defames the ""Little People"" family, and snubs the American family and little people everywhere.

The TV show is excellent:
An excellent series if purchased at TLC. The everyday lives of a charming family, which are not so everyday. Matt, a little person, spent much of his childhood in the hospital enduring painful operations. He worked in the corporate world, writing computer programs, and then in software sales. His interesting story is in his book, ""Against Tall Odds"". Whether racing friends in wheelchairs down hospital hallways at record high speeds, or pulling pranks on the nurses; Matt was outgoing and adventurous, even at a young age; suggesting a song and playing the piano, he got the girls singing for several lines, until, with quizzical looks, they realized he could not play. Matt overcomes challenges and finds romance. How many wives have said, ""He made my dreams come true."" Matt has an exciting life of fun with his wife and kids on his Oregon farm. His faith and his wife, keep his grand plans practical and successful. Otherwise there would likely be a herd of pet elephants roaming the backyard. Matt and family are good people and the real thing.",1175731200,10,2350,4.966921119592875
2691062,1,B000KGGOP4,"What a letdown!  I, too, had hoped for a boxed set at a reasonable price.  The Roloffs are a marvelous family, and their adventures are such treats amid alternate programming riddled with sex and profanity.  To see what these people have made of their lives is truly inspirational, and the work that Matt does for the benefit of little people everywhere is nothing short of admirable.  For TLC to market their shows in this disgusting, capitalizing way is a real slap in their faces, a bold statement that their work is not considered important enough to market for any purpose other than greed, i.e. another blatant injustice thrown in their paths.",1173052800,9,649,4.81981981981982
2691063,3,B000KGGOP4,"I have enjoyed this show on TLC and have been waiting for the box set of season one to be released. Unfortunately, TLC has decided to release each 1/2 hour episode on individual DVDs and charge nearly $20 for each one! I wouldn't pay $40 for the entire first season and I LOVE this show. I have all of the episodes on my DVR and I guess that is the only way I will be watching them unless TLC rethinks their decision.",1172102400,9,417,4.097560975609756
2691084,5,B000KGGOP4,Love itt i plan to buy the whole series,1431993600,,39,3.4444444444444446
2691085,5,B000KGGOP4,"Appreciate the Roloff family allowing the tapings of the shows for many seasons. Their insight is refreshing. Although there are physical differences between little and average people, the Roloffs make you forget because they're always on the go, much more active than some average height people. Driving the big SUV and the vans, for example, with the pedal extensions is amazing. The scenery of the farm is just beautiful. They are very fortunate to have such a lovely place to call home.",1405296000,,490,4.987804878048781
2691086,5,B000KGGOP4,"Bought this for my wife since she loves the show.  Came in on time, brand new, works great, definitely a good buy.",1395446400,,114,4.181818181818182
2691087,4,B000KGGOP4,"My wife absolutely loves this show and it's next to impossible to find them all on DVD without paying an arm and a leg. Amazon had a great price, only 4 stare though because it came smashed, it's packaged in a cardboard set so packaging ruined but otherwise awesome.",1387238400,,266,4.448979591836735
2691088,5,B000KGGOP4,"I LOVE Little People, Big World. I've been watching it since it came out in 2005! Definitely recommend this DVD.",1369872000,,112,4.65
2691089,4,B000KGGOP4,Purchased this as a gag gift for my brother.  He watched it and said the quality was fine.  It arrived on time and in good condition.,1350950400,,133,4.076923076923077
2691090,2,B000KGGOP4,"i stream this show on netflix, its quite entertaining.  The Roloff parents seem like nice people, especially the mom who is a sweetheart, and volunteers to teach her kids soccer team.  you can tell even from watching a few episodes that the father is a hard working man who loves his family. the children live, for the most part, normal every day lives, and crave only acceptance for being different than most of society.  The basic premise of the show is to promote open mindedness and acceptance of others, regardless of their race, gender, height, or social status.

it is for this reason that i was so disappointed in reading about the controversy of this show and in particular, their 18 year old son jeremy (the non-little person) is a racist and bigot.  he made headline news in 2008 by writing public racist remarks online, calling people the N-word, bashing gays, and calling mexicans the B-word.

i didn't want to believe these accusations towards him, since, on the show, he seems like a good kid.  after reading many articles on the matter, i became disheartened.  hopefully he is the only one in the family to feel this way, but since he is so polite/nice on the show, i have no idea if its an isolated incident or if the whole family puts up a ""nice"" front for the camera.  as i enjoyed the first season greatly, its a shame that this family has gotten so rich ($$$) for being so hypocritical.",1286236800,2,1407,4.573705179282869
2691091,5,B000KGGOP4,"I've had a fascination with midgets for a while. Don't know why. They're funny little buggers running around like broken toys, with swollen heads and helium-induced voices. So I heard about this show and started watching, laughing myself week-after-week. Watching Amy create stools to climb on so she can reach stuff in the kitchen, or Matt burn rubber as he carts around in his scooter, and Zach running around in his Civil War hat with his little, crooked legs had me in tears!!

Now before you go bashing me as insensitive, know that I've learned a lot from this show. As Matt says in his opening monologue he hopes people can learn that they do everything other people do, but in a different way. This is your typical white family who live on a farm, argue over spending money they don't have on things they don't really need, raising kids who are getting ready to leave home (except for Jacob who's got a few years to go) and learn who they are, and Matt the dad, who's a control freak and must be in on every aspect of the business and household, monitoring the work while he swings on his crutches; I absolutely love when he does that!

The music for this show reminds me a lot of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sims/dp/B000O5DY0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sims</a>&nbsp;video game, especially during the part where you build or make additions to your house. It's very friendly, safe, and offers a warm background to what's happening onscreen (I'm talking about the music in the show, not on the game).

I've really come to love the Roloff family. I've come to learn much about midgets, the different forms of midgetism, and the struggles they go through just to lead a normal life. This show is great for anyone at any age. But especially great for kids to learn about differences in the world around them, that there are other people out there who might have to struggle a little more just to keep up with the rush of society.",1246406400,,1988,4.841176470588235
2691092,5,B000KGGOP4,"What a wonderful video! Makes you realize what ""little people"" have to go through just to perform what are normal everyday tasks for the average sized person. Such a delighful family. Many lessons are taught about family life and in raising children, regardless if they are dwarfs or normal sized. I would highly recommend it as a video that the entire family would want to enjoy together!",1243296000,2,389,4.82089552238806
2691093,5,B000KGGOP4,I bought this DVD set for my son who really likes this show.  He loved it - he watched all of the DVDs in a few days!  I could not find this in a store - next time I am looking I will shop on Amazon.com first!,1231200000,,209,3.425531914893617
2691104,5,B000KGGOP4,I love the Roloff's I think there a wonderful family. And really enjoy watching them. I think there show is also very educational in seeing the world though a little person's eyes.,1217894400,,180,4.65625
2691105,5,B000KGGOP4,"Surprisingly, I am enjoying the Little People Big World.  The show features a mixed stature family from Oregon, Matt and Amy Roloff, twins Zach and Jeremy; Molly and Jacob.  The parents and one child, the twin Zach, are born little people.

Since Matt spent much of his youth in hospitals, his dreams as a child have become real with his family.  Matt is entrepreneurial, a doer (or more like a supervisor of the doers) and inspirational and this little man is committed to his dreams, his challenge to life.  With health issues, his physical work is limited.

On the 34-acre farm, what child would not have enjoyed that magical and playful spread that includes a Pirate Ship, Tree House  and a Western Town.  The farm brings in money from corporate parties, tours, selling peaches, etc.,

Amy, more of a realist than Matt, works two jobs, one being a soccer coach.  The house is a mess and Zach can be a little pill with his lack of respect to his dad at times. Season one shows a camping trip with the boys and friends, driver's license, etc.

But you can enjoy life through the eyes of the Roloff family.  Although I never did see the TLC show, I enjoy having a first view through DVD....Rizzo",1213315200,6,1196,4.537383177570093
2691106,5,B000KGGOP4,"I enjoy the television show very much and am very pleased that I can re-watch each episode on my own time schedule.  This set includes some episodes that I was not able to see on television and were not available on the set that can be purchased from Discovery website.

If you want to see this family from the very beginning, this is the dvd set that you want to watch.

I look forward to getting the other seasons as they become available.",1198972800,,441,4.289156626506024
2691107,5,B000KGGOP4,i love this show it teaches you so much..it makes you want to settle down and have kids. AND LIVE ON A FARM..LOL..its a great reality show..the best you will ever watch..the roloffs are the BEST...A MUST HAVE BUY IT....,1197590400,,219,4.5
2691108,5,B000KGGOP4,"This is a fun show to watch. There is also an education that goes along with this show, at least for me it is an education. There are two dwarf parents, Amy and Mat. They are parenting four kids. 15/16 year old twins. One tall boy & one Dwarf boy. A 12/13 year old girl normal height and a 9/10 year old boy normal height. It is a chore when parenting the twins. Especially when the taller twin starts to talk back and the dwarf twin analyzes everything the father does in trying to get the taller twin to do the work needed. Mat really needs be married to Amy. She is the reason, the master mind behind the parenting. Matt is usually there to get things done, but there are times Amy needs to finesse the work her husband does.",1195689600,,728,4.170212765957447
2691109,5,B000KGGOP4,I love this dvd! The Roloffs are so cool. I watch this DVD a lot. It is well worth getting.,1194739200,,91,3.6
2691110,5,B000KGGOP4,"The lack of closed captions is unfortunate because there's so much value in this set. I agree with previous reviews regarding the cheap packaging, but my hope is that this was done in order to keep the price as low as possible to reach those who might not otherwise buy it.

""Living Little,"" the first episode, seems like it might be useful, if a little long for that, in an adolescent anti-bullying campaign, and I think it would be useful to make something similar for younger kids. I thought the parts where Matt was presenting at the school assembly were most excellent!!",1192492800,,575,4.637254901960785
2691111,5,B000KGGOP4,"The premise of this show is how people who are different assimilate into a world not made for them. Watching the Roloffs--a family of six, three of whom are dwarves and three of whom are of average size--will give you the answer: Very well, thank you.
This is the most realistic family show out there, and this family--despite having what some people may consider shortcomings (no pun intended)--are as genuine and typical as any family of six can be. I love watching them interact (sometimes politely, sometimes not so much so), deal with life's disappointments, revel in the good stuff, and just be themselves.
Everyone I've told about this show has become hooked, because it's so interesting to see how the Roloffs deal with what some of us average-height individuals take for granted, from shopping at the grocery store, to driving a car, to cleaning the house.  But what is really amazing is how much they are just typical people. This is the greatest appeal of ""Little People, Big World."" Size doesn't matter. As Matt said after returning from a business trip to see that his deck was finished: ""This is a GOOD thing!""",1191888000,6,1124,4.793814432989691
2691112,5,B000KGGOP4,"I love this show. It follows the members of the Roloff family and their daily activities. The parents, Matt and Amy are little people. One of there four children Zach is also a little person. The others are all average height. The best thing about this show is that you see just how ordinary they all are, but also see that they are extraordinary. They like all families have problems and disagreements but in the end they all come together as a family.",1191369600,,453,4.469879518072289
2691113,4,B000KGGOP4,"I'm going to let you in on a little secret...I hate reality television.  Come to think of it, television programming in general has been on a fast decline for awhile now.  It has become (at least for me) increasingly difficult to find something to watch without becoming bored.  Reality T.V. is laced with too much ham, sitcoms are unbearably lame, and action shows are just insulting to my intelligence.  With all this worthless debris cluttering the television waves it was a blessing to find Matt Roloff and his family.

Being a fan of the show and not wanting to spend $21.95 on the outrageously priced individual episode DVDs I found myself playing the waiting game for a full season DVD to grace the local department store shelves.  Today the wait was over...

Season One is a three disc DVD set, the only downside to this is the packaging.  It is made entirely of recycled cardboard with the DVDs having to be ""slipped"" in and out of place.  A nice improvement would have been a plastic backing for the discs to sit in...this way the DVDs wouldn't have to rub against the cardboard everytime the discs are removed and returned to the case.

I was also surprised to see that out of the 20 episodes included in this set the pilot episode, entitled ""Little People, Big Dreams"" was absent.  This is particularly important because this was the hour long episode that introduced us to the Roloff family back in March of 2005.  I don't understand why this episode is excluded from this set considering the significance it carried.

Little People, Big World (Season One) gets a well-deserved 4 stars.  Although the case was somewhat generic and the pilot epsiode missing I found the rest of the DVD set very well put together and the price very reasonable.
