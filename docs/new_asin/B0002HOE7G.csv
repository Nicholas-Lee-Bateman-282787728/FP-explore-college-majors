8028027,2,B0002HOE7G,This version really dissapointed. Ornella is wonderful but the lack of coherent editing and the horrendous English dubbing makes you wonder if it's worth 90 minutes of your life. Would like to know where to find the original Italian and the soundtrack which brings back memories of my childhood.,1236988800,4,295,5.040816326530612
8028028,1,B0002HOE7G,"I bought this DVD, fully expecting to see one of my favorites, the beautiful Ornella Muti in all her glory. However, I was very very dissapointed to see several of her nude scenes missing from this version, plus this is the terribly dubbed version. Look for the original version in Italian if you can find it.",1230768000,13,309,4.535714285714286
8028029,3,B0002HOE7G,"Summer Affair. I had never seen it before buying it, only on the basis that I'm a big fan of Ornella Muti.

The film was not bad, very early 70's, I didn't really expect the film to be fantastic, but I wasn't really disappointed either.

If your a fan of Ornella Muti then I suggest it's worth having in your collection, although the only thing I thought was ''what the hell'' was her voice is dubbed over, other than that, Ornella is just stunning as always.",1109376000,11,459,4.325581395348837
