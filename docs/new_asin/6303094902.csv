555371,3,6303094902,"I recently bought a copy of this movie for my eight year old son who has become a Gallifreyan convert and is working his way through my Dr. Who video collection.
The movie attempts to build on the unexpected success of the television series in a the same way that the series was constructed...on the cheap. Although this lends some charm to the proceedings it certainly undermines the basic idea of a Doctor Who movie. Similarly while Peter Cushing's screen nemesis Christopher Lee went on to appear as a solid character in Space 1999, he himself is cast in the role of a scientific buffoon, but then being a human that is probably not surprising. There are some parallels with the made for T.V. movie here.
The story is the same as that of the first Dalek television adventure writ large and whereas it could have been treated as serious science fiction and transcended the shoestring BBC budget version it degenerates into a comic attempt to get money from the punters pockets. No doubt the unexpected success of this venture led to a more competent attempt with the follow up, which as others have commented is of superior stock.
All in all Doctor Who suffered throughout it's life for being too low-brow for the BBC establishment. However, despite many assassination attempts by the Dalek (BBC) High Command, the series persisted and found many lifetime followers in the process.
P.S. I quite liked the coloured Daleks but not the lava lamps!",988675200,,1446,4.788
555372,2,6303094902,"As with a lot of remakes, this is more a parody than a an attempt to improve on the original.  The TV series version was a gripping and  involving story of a post-nuclear holocaust world in which the aggressors  had become peaceful humanoids and the victims had become paranoid creatures  dependant on machinery.
This film version however, is a toy-like movie  filled with multi-coloured Daleks armed with fire-extinguishers, a city of  lava-lamps and shower curtains, a fake-looking forest and Thals in comical  make-up.  Doctor Who (as he's known in this film, played by the usually  dependable Peter Cushing) has none of the charisma of Bill Hartnell's  Doctor, the Daleks barely manage to exterminate anyone but each other, the  Tardis interior looks like a junkyard and the attempts at humour are just  pathetic.
If you're a five-year-old who's never seen the TV Dr Who then  you'll probably love all the pretty colours and...uh, daring exploits.  If,  on the other hand, you're a fan a serious sci-fi, then this is one to  avoid.
Awarded two stars, but only because the soundtrack's nice.",967507200,2,1094,4.9944444444444445
555373,2,6303094902,"Peter Cushing disappoints as a ineffective, grandfatherly Dr. Who.  Disastrous attempt at comic relief by bumbling boyfriend fails miserably (think of an English Don Knotts with even less talent).  Weak script  (borrowing heavily from HG Wells' The Time Machine) features effiminate and  campy humans vs. Daleks.  On the plus side, the Daleks are amusing in a  robotic way (although we learn they are not robots).
The sequel, Dalek  Invasion, is somewhat better.
If you are in the market for low budget  British scifi, I'd suggest ""Quartermass and the Pit"" also known  as Five Million Years to Earth.
Note: I am not a special fan of Dr Who on  TV although I have seen it.",965001600,,671,4.807017543859649

From the opening scene-- where the good doctor is seen gasping over a DAN DARE comic-- this movie will hook any fan  of Sci-fi goofiness.  The story is actually pretty good-- in a cliffhanger  serial sort of way-- it just requires a sense of humor.  Peter Cushing?  Well... how MANY good things can I say?

555439,4,6303094902,"I love this film.  I bought this remastered release last year, I previously had the release of the two movies together with a poster & card set but sadly I mislaid it somewhere.

The new transfer of the film is very impressive.  There is still a bit of grain in the image but this is because of the use of Technoscope & isn't really cause for concern.  The image is clear & well detailed. The sound has not been tampered with but remains quite clear on the original mono track.

If anything was to detract from this release it would be the lack of any decent VAM.

It does have the Dalekmania documentary on it, but this was on the previous release I had & it is now a bit dated. They should've produced a new retrospective documentary.  The commentary on it is also the same from the previous release.

There is a short feature with Gareth Owen who discusses the production of the movie & I was astounded by some of the inaccuracies he came out with!

For instance he mentions a Bill Shawcraft! Shawcraft made the Dalek props for this movie & the original Doctor Who serial on which the movie is based.  It was owned & run by a man called Bill Roberts but Gareth Owen can't get this bit of information right, so I'm afraid I don't hold much stock in what he says after he get's this bit of information completely wrong!!  He also mentions somebody else as having made the Dalek props which again is completely wrong, the Dalek props were made by Shawcraft Models!

He also unfortunately trots out the well worn excuse that the BBC series suffers from wobbly scenery.  Well in my opinion his behind the scenes information on this movie is wobbly & inaccurate! They should've interviewed someone who actually knew what they were talking about, someone like Nicholas Briggs who is a self confessed Dalek nut!

The feature on the remastering is interesting but sparse which just about sums up this release. It seems this release was simply put out to cash in on the television shows Fiftieth Anniversary, and it shows, there is little in the way of any new VAM content on it which hasn't been released before.

However it is the film which most people will buy the DVD for, & the new remastered print is a joy to watch. So for the film transfer alone I recommend this release (the VAM is forgettable. Just who is Gareth Owen anyway!).",1488585600,,2331,4.464622641509434

555443,5,6303094902,"Now that I've seen the 1st Doctor  Who episodes, Peter Cushing's portrayal was a little off. Either the director or Cushing didn't want to use the tv portrayal or couldn't get it to come across as a curmudgeon (which william Hartnell seemed to be). The movie portrayal was a dottering old man. Both versions showed his insatiable curiosity. Susan (his granddaughter) in both tv & movie was a prodigy & Barbara was accurately done. The male companion, Nick, differed between tv & the movie. I didn't like the clumsy young man in the movie because that meant no one was able to point & check on the Doctor from doing something disastrous. Nick in the tv version was a much more confident and agile & was able to stand up to the Doctor with some biting criticism.  TV versions of the TARDIS's travelers to me were more believable. The movie version carried the suspense of,""will they make the trip home safely?"". That made the movie more entertaining than some of the tv episodes.  The daleks  were as evil, callous & totally unredeemable in tv & movie. I loved that so you could see both Doctor Who versions fight evil effectively!  Even with low budget on props & makeup in both tv & the movie without distracting from the plot, script & pacing. It had been a long time between viewings so  the movie was memorable that i wanted to buy it & see it again. My question is,""why didn't make another Doctor Who movie in all this time until 2004? What took them so long?"" It has the record of the longest continuous running sci-fi tv series, millions of fans in the English-speaking world  so go figure that out?

555534,5,6303094902,"as a fairly recent convert to whovianism i was turned from mildly interest to full on fan by this dvd collection. the main feature here are the more recent episodes of doctor who featuring doctors 9-12 in which the daleks are the main foe of the doctor. each of these incarnations are excellent and bring their own distinct flare to the classic character, as is the tradition. the stories are interesting and at their best provocative. don't expect any philip k dick stuff here but for sci-fi i think the doctor and the plots are more complex than most similar fare. if you have seen and enjoyed any of the new doctor who series i don't think you will be let down.

what really puts this over the top though and earns the 5th star is the complete 6 part serial featuring the 4th doctor: genesis of the daleks. the camp factor is ramped up a bit here, this IS 70's sci-fi don't forget. BUT the story is a great intro to the classic era and an interesting origin story for the doctor's most tenacious adversaries.

A dvd that will tell the story of the history of the Daleks and chronicle  their story lines throughout Doctor Who!"" I was mistaken. The ""Bonus Feature"" documentary ""Dalek Origins"" is just a perfunctory look at the different Dalek styles through the years. It dips it's plunger into Dalek lore enough to be able to say ""We have a Bonus Dalek documentary on this ""'NEW'"" dvd we've released!"" If you're a Whovian you'll want to buy this for completion sake but not for the ""Dalek Origins"" documentary. You'll buy it for ""Genesis of The Daleks"" a fourth Doctor 6 part adventure that you would pay $20 US and up if you bought it by itself. But that's not all! You'll also receive 5 other Dalek adventures: ""Dalek"" with the 9th Doctor, ""The Stolen Earth/Journey's End"" with the 10th Doctor, ""Asylum of The Daleks"" with the 11th Doctor and ""Into The Dalek"" with the 12th Doctor. The transfer quality of ""Genesis of The Daleks"" is very good as is the transfer of the other adventures. Dan Starkey who plays ""Straxx"" is the presenter of the ""bonus features"" and there is also a short bit with Nick Briggs, the voice of The Daleks in modern Who however, this bit exists elsewhere as a special feature on one of the recent season box sets.

Bottom line: Buy it for ""Genesis of The Daleks"" and enjoy the other Dalek episodes as the bonus features you should have received instead of the ""bonus feature documentary"" you did receive with this two-disc set. If you want a detailed history of The Daleks buy ""Doctor Who: The Dalek Handbook"" by Steve Tribe and James Goss. http://www.amazon.com/Doctor-Who-Dalek-Handbook-BBC/dp/1849902321/ This book details the history of The Daleks and their many appearances in Doctor Who.

However, about Just like any other TV Series where movies were made etc... there are people who like it, and people who don't.  There are always good episodes and horrible episodes to ANY TV/Movie Series. However, TRUE fans will ALWAYS watch every episode/movie released. You may like this, you may not.

This is a REGION B release of the Blu-ray. So check your Blu-ray player. REGION B is for Europe. Region B can NOT be played in most USA Blu-ray players. Unless your using a computer, or have a multi-region Blu-ray player.

The FILM conversion of this movie is decent considering that the original film was not physically stored and preserved in the manner it should have been. The extra features are a nice addition. If you have a decent upscaling Blu-ray player, or a other home entertainment equipment that provides good HD upscaling. The benefits of having the Blu-ray version verus the DVD version aren't much, Except currently as I write this. The Blu-ray version is cheaper than the DVD version.

So if you don't own a copy of this movie to complete your Doctor Who Collection, then grab the Blu-ray version. You will future proof yourself much better this way.

Directed by Gordon Flemyng and now fully restored, Dr. Who & The Daleks [1965] was the first big screen film adaptation of British TV's most iconic sci-fi hero, and was the first time Doctor Who was ever seen in colour!

British film legend Peter Cushing plays everyone's favourite Timelord, and having invented the TARDIS, a strange machine capable of travelling into other dimensions, the Doctor and his three young accomplices set forth on a quest through time and space. Their journey takes them into the dark, undiscovered depths of the universe and to the planet of Skaro. A primitive world devastated by nuclear war and populated by two warring species, a peaceful tribe known as Thals and a life form heavily mutated by radiation, encased in protective machines. A merciless force of destruction known as The Daleks!

FILM FACT: It is based on the second serial of the British science fiction Doctor Who television programme, The Daleks, produced by the BBC. Filmed in Technicolor, it is the first Doctor Who story to be made in colour and in a widescreen format. The television series continued to be made in black-and-white until 1969 and not in widescreen until the revival of the series in 2005.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: Dr. Who & The Daleks [1965] was the first Doctor Who film and the first colour appearance of the Doctor, has finally been released on Blu-ray by StudioCanal to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of this beloved sci-fi programme, which premiered on BBC Television in 1963. The release also coincides with the hundred year anniversary of famed actor Peter Cushing's birth, who stars here as the first non-canon Doctor. What does non-canon mean, in terms of the famous adventurer? Since the show first began with William Hartnell starring as the intelligent, if somewhat abrasive humanoid alien known as the Doctor, to date there have been eleven different actors appearing as the Doctor due to his ability to regenerate in different forms.

Peter Cushing is not considered part of that pantheon because his character, despite being known as Doctor Who, bears few things in common with the Doctor of the television show, such as his love of science, travel, and adventure. Specifically, Cushing's Doctor is a human, not an alien, whose surname just happens to be Who. Despite also featuring the Doctor's most infamous nemeses, Dr. Who and the Daleks is not an official Doctor Who film, but rather an attempt by British studio Amicus to continue competing with Hammer Studios. The two studios often ran neck to neck with horror films and adventure movies, and this film was Amicus's attempt to compete with Hammer's more family-friendly pirate and dinosaur-themed adventure films. Other than an intelligent, science-oriented character named Doctor Who, the villainous Daleks, and the Doctor's T.A.R.D.I.S. time vessel, Dr. Who and the Daleks bears almost no relationship to the Doctor Who Television Series.

The Film was Co-written by Amicus founder Milton Subotsky and Doctor Who scribe and Dalek creator Terry Nation, Doctor Who and the Daleks was an attempt to cash in on Dalekmania, the Dalek craze that swept Britain during the early 1960s following Doctor Who's establishment. A scientist named Doctor Who [Peter Cushing] invents a police box-shaped time machine known as the T.A.R.D.I.S. He shows the machine to his two granddaughters, Susan [Roberta Tovey] and Barbara [Jennie Linden], as well as to Barbara's clumsy boyfriend Ian [Roy Castle]. Ian trips and accidentally activates the machine, sending them light years away to a strange, hostile planet occupied by Daleks, militant robots determined to take over the world. Furthermore, the Daleks have enslaved a peaceful, humanoid race, the Thals. Doctor Who and his family work with the Thals to escape from the diabolical snare of the Daleks and potential radiation poisoning.

Audiences will find plenty to love here, as the film is fun, colourful, over the top, and packed with amazing, era-appropriate scenery. Amicus certainly spared no expense on the set, which was shot in Technicolor and looks simply incredible. From the Dalek city to the petrified jungle, the film seems to have had some influence on later sci-fi films. This is definitely a film for children and adults of all ages.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Released in a 1080p resolution and 2.35:1 aspect ratio, Dr. Who & The Daleks has been digitally re-mastered and presented in HD and on Blu-ray for the first time. The Technicolor looks wonderful and the otherworldly, fantasy elements of the set look fantastic here. The film was shot in Techniscope, a two-perforation, as opposed to the normal four, 35mm process in Techniscope was popular in the 1960s and early 1970s, often for lower- or medium-budget films, as it provided a widescreen image without the use of expensive-to-rent anamorphic lenses and as it exposed an area half the height of a normal 35mm frame one reel of film got twice as much use. Techniscope fell into disuse in the 1970s except for some special-effects work, though the name is sometimes used more recently as a synonym for two-perf Super 35. Films shot in the latter process include Shame and Silver Linings Playbook. One downside of the process, or a feature if you prefer, was increased grain, `Dr. Who & The Daleks' isn't hugely grainy, but the grain on this Blu-ray transfer does look film like. The colours do look true, with solid blacks and close shots are very detailed. Some of the longer shots look a little less detailed, though that may well be as per original.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  `Dr. Who & The Daleks' was made and released in mono, as was the case with almost every film of 1965 other than 70mm presentations. Thankfully, STUDIOCANAL have not remixed the soundtrack into fake 5.1 and have left it as the English 2.0 LPCM Mono Audio language track. It sounds fine, with dialogue, music and sound effects clear and well balanced, as befits a professional job of work by Amicus's sound department. Also thankfully, STUDIOCANAL have provided optional hard-of-hearing subtitles, which has not normally been their policy on English-language releases. This is presented in decent sounds and only has a slight hiss. Though some of the dialogue is a little low, everything sounds clear and the almost constant Dalek-related special effects sound great, are indeed beautifully mixed.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Roberta Tovey and Jenny Linden: Some of the extras are transported over from the film's DVD release from 2002. This includes a commentary, billed as featuring Jennie Linden and Roberta Tovey but in fact is moderated by Jonathan Southcote, author of The Cult Films of Peter Cushing. This is a pleasant chat, with both women clearly having clearly happy memories of the filming and of working with Peter Cushing in particular. They both remember Roy Castle taking opportunities to practise his trumpet playing and tap-dancing in his dressing room at every opportunity, distracting young Roberta Tovey and her chaperone, from her schoolwork. Gordon Flemyng struck a deal with Roberta Tovey that he would give her a shilling every time she did a shot in one take. He didn't repeat this deal for the sequel, presumably as he realised how much he would be out of pocket! This commentary is heavier on anecdote than anything else, so it may be light on the hard information some Doctor Who aficionados might wish for.

Special Feature: Dalekmania [1995] [58:00] This is a documentary that dates back to 1995 and the film's VHS release. It's presented in the aspect ratio 4:3, upscaled to 1080p, though film clips and some dramatized material at the beginning and end are letterboxed. (Who fans will note that the commissionaire in the opening scene is played by Michael Wisher, a regular Dalek voice on television and the first and definitive incarnation of the Daleks' creator Davros.) Roberta Tovey features here too, so inevitably this duplicates information from the commentary, though we do find out exactly how many shillings ""One-Take Tovey"" earned. However, we do get to hear from people who were alive then but aren't now, notably Terry Nation, who died in 1997 and has been inevitably sparsely represented on the range of Dr. Who DVDs of the television series. Stunt coordinator Eddie Powell, who died in 2000, also appears and he towers over the adult Roberta Tovey in one shot, so you can see why he was used as Christopher Lee's stunt double. Peter Cushing and Roy Castle had both passed away the previous year, and the documentary is dedicated to their memories. Sadly Gordon Flemyng who died in 1995 and is sadly missed. Given that it is now eighteen years old, it's unavoidably a little dated and one contributor is looking forward to seeing the Doctor Who films in colour and widescreen on video and younger viewers ask your parents what that was. It could also have been more detailed: Raymond Cusick, recently departed as I write this, certainly deserved some attention for coming up with the design of the Daleks. Meanwhile, you do get to find out how much Dalek memorabilia went for back in the day. We also see some very faded-to-pink and battered clips from the Italian and French dubbed versions of the film, so thank the Blu-ray gods that you aren't watching something with that lack of picture quality.

Special Feature: Restoring Dr. Who & The Daleks [1080p] [9:00] A look at how the film was digitally restored for this set. Film and television historian Marcus Hearn returns to provide some background to the shooting of the film in Techniscope and Technicolor and Milton Subotksy's adaptation of the original Terry Nation story. Jo Botting, BFI curator, explains the development and drawbacks of Techniscope as a widescreen format. We then pop over to Deluxe and gets an insight into how the restoration was achieved from a 35mm anamorphic interpositive dating back to 1969. Steve Bearman, Tom Barrett and Ian Pickford of Deluxe facility also discuss the grading of the film, the clean-up and stabilising of the image and the restoration of the optical soundtrack.

Special Feature: Interview with Gareth Owen [8:00] Gareth Owen, author of The Shepperton Story, tells us much about the making of the film but it's a shame he has to trot out the 'wobby scenery, wobbly acting' redundant fallacy about the television series. Apart from that, some interesting stories about Vegoda, Amicus, the formation of Aaru, the impact of 'Dalekmania' and how the Daleks were built for the film, which he attributes entirely to effects men Bert Luxford when the company Shawcraft built the eight 'hero' Daleks and Bert Luxford likely oversaw the making of the 'dummy' versions at Shepperton.

Special Feature: Stills Gallery [1080p] [3:00] Here you have a collection of promotional and production stills from Dr. Who & The Daleks.

Theatrical Trailer [4:00] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for Dr. Who & The Daleks. Enter the world of the Daleks, because now they're closer than ever before and so close you can feel their fire.

Finally, whilst the series relied on monochromatic obscurity for its uncanny terrors, the movie takes the Daleks into the world of spectacle and colour. From the glitzy title sequence to the colour coded Daleks; from its use of lava lamps to the perhaps ill-judged use of purple eyeshadow on the otherwise butch Thals, the film throws colour and 1960s glamour at the audience. This means the crisp digital restoration and the release on Blu-ray version considerably enhances the film. The film is well acted though the dialogue is stilted so the real two stars of the film are the Daleks themselves, and the impressive, almost Ken Adam-esque set design. I originally had the Two Doctor Who films of the The Dalek Collection, which was a Two Region 2 DVDs and was at the time the best way to view these films on ones Homes Cinema set up, but of course with this Blu-ray release, it is now in the ultimate collection version and if you're a true Doctor Who fan, then this will be your ultimate viewing enjoyment and give you endless hours of sci-fi enjoyment. If you are a fan of British adventure films and also love Peter Cushing, then it comes highly recommended for the sheer fun factor. Dr. Who & The Daleks was followed by a less successful sequel Daleks  Invasion Earth: 2150 A.D.' [which I also enjoyed] which also starred Peter Cushing and has also been released on Blu-ray simultaneously by STUDIOCANAL. Be forewarned that these are both Region B/2 disc releases and American fans can only watch them with a Multi-region Blu-ray player. Highly Recommended!

Whoever this Peter Cushing fellow is, he should be dragged out behind the theatre and horsewhipped for daring to make such an awful, awful film and but the title Dr Who on it.  Let's begin with the Doctor himself.  Worst acting ever.  And I do mean that with quite a bit of knowledge and experience as to what is bad, and what is truly awful.  Cushing is like no Doctor ever played.  Never before has anyone portrayed the Doctor as a bland, lifeless idiot.  That being said, Cushing is the star of this piece of tripe.  One would think that no one could be a worse actor or portray a character from the Doctor Who series in a more negative manner.  One would be wrong.  Look no further than the fellow cast members.  I'm not sure which is the most painful.  The bumbling, stumbling boyfriend, the Doctor's niece with her phony, out of context screaming at everything, or perhaps the Darleks....who can't seem to master the correct cadence of speech.  I could go on and on...but why bother.  Suffice it to say, the plot is.....stupid....and that is being generous.

I think thats what people have to remember, that it is 50 years old now but still looks good. Many British films were still
being made in black and white then. Its true it was produced and released in a matter of months and does not have quite
the same production values of the previous years ""First Men in the Moon"" also filmed at Shepperton but i can still enjoy it today.
There is a lot of critism of the doctor being portrayed as a grandfather inventor and not an alien but that is surely down
to the 82 minute running time. The tv series told the story in 6 25 minute episodes plus viewers had also got to know the characters
in 4 previous episodes, 3 of which were set in prehistoric times. Here was a film being made that was to be shown in other countries
that had no knowledge of the tv show. The producers only had minutes to establish the characters and then condense the dalek story.

555803,1,6303094902,"DOCTOR WHO is an indestructible legend...no thanks to the two theatrical releases which ostensibly starred Peter Cushing but were in fact shamelessly milking a '60s British fad. after all, ""Dalekmania"" is said to of been, in it's time, second only to Beatlemania!!
i believe i've stated that DOCTOR WHO is no less than my all-time favorite television series. (unless you feel that, being an American, i'm obliged to pick something from America, in which case it becomes GET SMART, but that's another issue.) that being said, the Daleks are easily my least favorite element of the series. they have GOT to be the silliest-looking villains in the history of all storytelling, and they always seem to fall back on pretty much the same strategy of blast everything in sight and shreik ""EXTERMINATE! EXTERMINATE!""
the basic creed of the Daleks is that no non-Dalek form of life deserves to exist. this isn't simply their opinion, you understand, it's their body of knowledge IN IT'S ENTIRETY! with characters that narrow, there's only one story there to tell.
so i've always felt that the overemphasis on Daleks was the series' Achilles heel. they just didn't have any SUBSTANCE until about a decade later, when the series introduced one of it's all-time greatest villains, Dalek creator Davros. Davros brought a much needed depth: once he arrived, what had basically felt like a gang of street rioters acquired a Nazis-like menace for his Hitler element. of course the film(s) are exempt from culpability because they predate Davros' arrival,  but what about the revived series? it's greatest mistake (indeed my only real greivance with it), is that while the Daleks continue to pop up here and there, their illustrious leader has (so far) been seen on the revamped DOCTOR WHO but once. what the hell was Russell T. Davies/is Steven Moffatt THINKING??
if anything it's the other way around: the series should shelve the damn Daleks and just have Davros for a spell. the Daleks without Davros are like Renfield without Dracula, or Luca Brasi without Don Corleone!!
another thing it suffers for predating is the series' phenomenon of ""regeneration."" so Cushing has to play a variation of the first Doctor. it's often said that it was the Daleks more than anything else that put the series on the map, and that's the mitigating circumstance which enabled them to do so: William Hartnell is the weakest Doctor there has ever been and, unless Bobcat Goldthwait gets the part at some point, the weakest Doctor there is ever likely to be. Peter Cushing was a fine actor: just think what he could've done if he'd had Jon Pertwee or Tom Baker or David Tennant to work from. granted, it would still be a carbon-copy, but at least it wouldn't be a carbon-copy of the low man on the totem pole.
(the more i think about it the surer i am that this is the very mitigating circumstance that made ""Dalekmania"" possible. if the series had started out with Tom Baker, Peter Davison, David Tennant, Matt Smith, or even Colin Baker, the Daleks would be a historical footnote today. Hartnell and Hartnell alone was a flimsy enough Doctor to be upstaged by a trashcan on a go-cart.)
call me anal-retentive (which i am), but what most irks me about this Doctor is another matter entirely. the Doctor suffers from an acute case of Frankenstein syndrome: the single most obnoxious misconception about the series is that ""Doctor Who"" is a person's name. it's NOT!! we're never told his name, and the title DOCTOR WHO is supposed to be a commentary to that effect. but somehow people keep missing this point. even the series itself took 20 years to hire a proofreader who thought to correct it's misleading habit of listing the character played by William Hartnell/Patrick Troughton/Jon Pertwee/Tom Baker as ""Doctor Who"" in it's closing credits. but in spite of that, tune in to any given episode and one of the first things you'll notice is that he is never, EVER addressed as ""Dr. Who.""
which is more than can be said for the movie(s). the Peter Cushing incarnation actually introduces himself as Dr. Who. just what are we supposed to infer from this? that he has an Oriental ancestry, or that he played first base on Abbott & Costello's baseball team?
and that's before we even get to the fact that the scripts for both films are rewrites of the series' first two Dalek stories. why couldn't they at the very least come up with their own tales? don't ask me because i have no idea.
i'm a fan of movies from just about every era, so no one knows better than i do that changing tastes and viewpoints can transmogrify a given production's effect. i can usually put myself in a frame of mind where i can enjoy a film that's older than myself in spite of (or perhaps because of) it's distance from what's ""cool"" that particular year in cinema. this isn't one of those times. the ""Dalek"" movies can admittedly be absolved of the charge of of trying to bastardise a continuity that followed rather than preceded them, but they're still awfully sterile when compared to any given post-Hartnell episode of DOCTOR WHO. he probably didn't set out to be and he certainly doesn't deserve to be, but Peter Cushing is the blacksheep of the Doctor family.",1344038400,6,5211,4.777161862527716

My biggest complaint is the way the character of the Doctor has been rewritten for the movie.  Instead of a Time Lord from another world, in the movie you get the impression that the Doctor is nothing more than an eccentric inventor.  He is not nearly as interesting a character.  Cushing plays the Doctor as a lovable, doddering old man.  It's a shame because this movie could have been quite good.

555880,5,6303094902,"_This is the film that introduced the American public to the world of Doctor Who way back in 1965. While it is generally ignored by purists, this is the Doctor that many of us fondly remember from childhood. While it is based on the original BBC television series, the producers decided to go with a ""name"" star that the American public would recognise (Peter Cushing) instead of the original Doctor, William Hartnell. While many have condemned the Cushing characterization as being an elderly inventor instead of a Time Lord, I disagree. What the character actually says is that he and his fellow scientists have been working on the TARDIS for some time- he says it to an uninitiated visitor- so that doesn't rule out his being a Time Lord.

_The story itself deals with the initial contact with the Daleks upon their home world. The Daleks are exactly the same as we have come to remember them. I will swear that these Daleks are the same ones that I just saw in the latest series on CBC. Even the voices are the same- EXTERMINATE, EXTERMINATE, EXTERMINATE!

_I suppose that the sets are low tech and low budget by today's standards, but I found that to be part of the charm and nostalgia of the film. It is about on the same level as that other low-budget time-travel film of the same era ""The Three Stooges Meet Hercules"" (also a favorite of mine.) You know that it is the 60's since the original ""lava lamps"" are used as props in one scene.

_Even though this is a budget tape from Goodtimes Home Video, I found the quality to be acceptable. I am curious why they chose to title it ""Dr. Who"" instead of the usual Doctor Who...",1126915200,6,1631,4.503378378378378
555881,1,6303094902,"Overall, this movie was not impressive.  The characters seemed to be too stereotypical for my tastes, with the eccentric inventor, the hapless but cute girls, and the clutsy but well-meaning guy.
Gone is the mystery of the Doctor and Susan's origins.  Gone is the darkness of the script.  I know, I know, the original series was a bit lame, but that's because of the budget.  The script by itself was suspenseful.  This recreation had none of that.
In fact, the only thing I find likable about this was the TARDIS' interior.  It was an interesting change.",1082592000,6,555,4.729166666666667
555882,5,6303094902,"""Dr. Who and the Daleks"" is a fine film version of the television classic! A great addition to anyone's science fiction film collection! Grade: A-",1080086400,4,146,4.88
555883,2,6303094902,"Dr WHO and the Daleks- It was altogether a good feature but the writers have changed the characters around from the original series, which really throws a Doctor Who fan off guard. It is obvious they did this to help those who had never seen Doctor Who before get in to the story. It was as if Disney had a hand in this retelling.
  For starters The Doctor is now the inventor of the tardis and seems to be from earth rather than Gallifrey. Susan has regressed in age and Barbara is not her teacher but rather her sister, while Ian (also supposed to be Susans' teacher) is Barbara's clumsy slapstick boyfriend.
  In my opinion the writer was either too lazy to think up an ingenious way to keep the storyline in tact, or was kept from doing so by executive types. We should all know how those guys get when profit is involved.
  Aside from the fact they butchered the relationships between the Doctor and his companions the story kept true to the first meeting of the Daleks as in the original series.
  After removing the thought of Barbara being the Doctors' granddaughter and constantly reminding my self that she and Ian were Susans' teachers; and Susan just looked extremely young for her age, it became quite enjoyable. However if you must see this story look for the William Hartnell, black and white version first, they are essentially the same story.
  In conclusion, maybe for the family; my seven year old son preferred the Peter Cushing version, so I am led to believe it may be more enjoyable for the whole family.",1057968000,6,1527,4.56043956043956
555884,4,6303094902,"This was the first of the two big-screen adaptions of Dr. Who - with bigger and better special effects than on the show, though taking a different course as to the Dr.'s character.  On the show, the Doctor is an alien - a member of an advanced race of humanoids who live extremely long lives, can regenerate their bodies under circumstances that would kill normal muggles like us, and have mastered the science of space-time travel.  Carousing through the cosmos, the Doctor's ship is incredibly huge on the inside (actually limitless) but on the outside can look like an object of any size - in the Doctor's case, a London Police call box.  Frequent travels brought the Doctor into conflict with the Daleks - machines housing horribly (and never seen) natives of the planet Skaro who descended from the mutated survivors of a global thermo-nuclear war.  The most popular of the Doctor's TV-foes, the Daleks were the natural choice to share his leap to the big screen.
While the Daleks' story is unchanged for the film (cold conquerors of a dying world), and though this flick otherwise follows the plot of the serial in which the Daleks were introduced, the flick otherwise changes the Doctor's story.  Now, instead of being a time-lord, the Doctor is a curmudgeonly human inventor (named ""Doctor Who"" - the characters who are his granddaughters are never mentioned by that name) who manages to construct a crude space-time machine which is bigger inside than out, and just happens to look like a Police call box on the outside.  Accidentally sending the time/space ship on its way - the Doctor and crew (his two granddaughters and the older one's date) - vanish from Earth and wind up on a blasted alien world.  The Doctor tricks his passengers into going out exploring - he's too much of an adventurer to pass the alien world up.  When a huge (and seemingly abandoned) city looms nearby, he goes to investigate, hoping - he tells the others - to find extra mercury for a critical fluid link.  Instead, when the city proves to be home to nasty sounding Daleks, they are all captured.  The Doctor is then forced to learn the nature of these mechanized creatures and find a way to escape and link up with the Thals - green-skinned descendants of the Daleks' ancient enemies.  Though the Thals are stubbornly peaceful, you know that the Doctor will lead them to rise up against the Daleks.
This was a great flick - not quite faithful to Who-lore, but confident in its own way.  Cushing is an unforgettable Who, though he could have done with the TV incarnation's more hard edged (here he's a kindly old guy with a child's sense of adventure).  Being a human inventor raises some questions, but none that get in the way of the fun, and anyway sticking to the TV-show's premise of the Doctor's being a time-lord would complicate things (the story would have to explain his origin AND the Daleks')  The Daleks, on the other hand, are faithfully translated to the big-screen - their huge city, their screeching voices and their fascist-style cruelty fit them to a tee (if anything, the movie Daleks are even louder here)  The flick ends on a climactic battle that won't dissappoint.",1040083200,9,3177,4.730072463768116
555885,2,6303094902,"Slo-o-o-o-o-o-owwwww moving, mildly campy feature film adapted from the beloved BBC-TV show.  Peter Cushing takes a turn as the semi-dotty Doctor, and the Daleks are appropriately awkward and mechanical.  You're better off getting your giggles from the original television episodes.",1039910400,,282,6.025
555886,3,6303094902,"I recently bought a copy of this movie for my eight year old son who has become a Gallifreyan convert and is working his way through my Dr. Who video collection.
The movie attempts to build on the unexpected success of the television series in a the same way that the series was constructed...on the cheap. Although this lends some charm to the proceedings it certainly undermines the basic idea of a Doctor Who movie. Similarly while Peter Cushing's screen nemesis Christopher Lee went on to appear as a solid character in Space 1999, he himself is cast in the role of a scientific buffoon, but then being a human that is probably not surprising. There are some parallels with the made for T.V. movie here.
The story is the same as that of the first Dalek television adventure writ large and whereas it could have been treated as serious science fiction and transcended the shoestring BBC budget version it degenerates into a comic attempt to get money from the punters pockets. No doubt the unexpected success of this venture led to a more competent attempt with the follow up, which as others have commented is of superior stock.
All in all Doctor Who suffered throughout it's life for being too low-brow for the BBC establishment. However, despite many assassination attempts by the Dalek (BBC) High Command, the series persisted and found many lifetime followers in the process.
P.S. I quite liked the coloured Daleks but not the lava lamps!",1016582400,3,1446,4.788
555887,4,6303094902,"The first Dr. Who movie tie-in, a remake of the second story in the TV series, is a worthy step in trying to duplicate the TV series to the big screen.  It was in colour, it had some well known names (Peter Cushing, Roy Castle, Barrie Ingham), and with a bigger budget.
Peter Cushing's the typical absent-minded professor, and a gentle fellow, compared to the irascible William Hartnell.
In contrast with Carole Anne Ford's portrayal, Roberta Tovey's Susan is more a person of action, brave, someone with more initiative.  She's the one who snatches the box of phials, beating an indecisive Ian to the punch, and she also walks out of the Daleks' cell in order to retrieve those phials.  Not bad for someone in her pre-teens.
The twin dynamics here are interesting as well.  Susan shares her grandfather's spirit of adventure, while Ian and Barbara are the cowardly lions.  As a result, Cushing and Tovey work together superbly and are the more watchable pair of the quartet.
Roy Castle's Ian is a far cry from William Russell's.  Ian here is a clumsy clod, nearly sitting on the chocolates he brings Barbara, who's his girlfriend in this story, and also hopelessly stupid.  The scene of him trying to get a pair of doors open in the Dalek city makes one think how hapless he is.  And talk about being a coward!  When the Thal party he is with says they must climb up a mountain, he exclaims, ""Climb?"" before quickly recovering with, ""I was only thinking about Barbara.""  Sure you were, sissy!
The interior of the Dalek city is impressive, with bright yellow-orange colours.  And they must have had some Earth influence--there are lava lamps visible when Susan writes her letter to Alydon.
This was more of a challenge, condensing a 175 minute serial (7 25-minute episodes) down to a mere 78 minutes!  True, the grimness of the story was toned down and it was a bit cutesy, but the core material came through, i.e. the trip to the city for more mercury, the travellers planning their escape from the Dalek cell, the Doctor convincing the Thals to help them, and the trip across the chasm.
Not bad, and it produced a sequel that outdid this one.",1009843200,10,2144,4.657824933687003
555888,4,6303094902,"No complaints here.
Good quality widescreen transfer of the movie and some interesting additions such as the original trailer, a slightly inaccurate history of Dr Who's various TV incarnations, a Peter Cushing bio and commentary by Roberta Toovey and Jennie Linden.
If you like Dr Who this DVD will be a good addition to your existing TV series collection. If you have never seen or heard of Dr Who (where HAVE you been !) you can still enjoy this colorful family adventure film which can be viewed with no knowledge of the TV series that inspired it.",1006732800,4,551,4.690721649484536
7836825,3,6303094902,"Doctor Who is predominantly a children's science fiction show designed to inspire young bight children into law abiding careers.  With that in mind one is hard pressed to take away much of that from this film, other than the fact that the much famed Dalek bad guys of both TV and feature film make an appearance in this movie.

This film has a bit more plot than its sequel, and shines for it on that point, but the larger story has little exposition, and the adventure scenes aren't all that adventurous.  It's a film meant for younger audiences of a few generations ago, so it has limitations.

In the larger scheme of things there's just little exposition of the TARDIS, what it's for, why it was built, and what the characters do with it.  In this sense you need to be a Doctor Who fan to begin with in order to enjoy this film.  Because on its own it's more or less a B-grade scifi movie with some action flourishes here and there.

Overall I don't mind it.  In fact I kind of like it, and in spite of watching Dr. Who for much of my life, I hadn't seen this particular installment of Dr. Who until either last year or the year before last.  I now have a copy of it, and intend to watch it again.

If you're a casual scifi fan, then this movie may disappoint.  If you're a Dr. Who fan, then this movie might prove interesting.",1526169600,,1331,4.2629482071713145
