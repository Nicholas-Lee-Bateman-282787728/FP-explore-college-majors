8122862,1,B000FICFEQ,Big disappointment. I wish I could get my money back. These DVDs show trained dogs doing tricks but if you have an untrained dog you would do much better with something like the Bow Wow series by Virginia Broitman and Sherri Lippman.,1282176000,,233,4.571428571428571
8122863,5,B000FICFEQ,"I purchased Volume 1 and 2 of the Dog Tricks DVD, and as I said about the first one, the Instruction is very clear and simple.  My Dog has pretty much mastered all the tricks in volume 2 and he loves the time we spend training for the tricks and the attention he gets when he completes them.",1273968000,,291,4.017241379310345
8122864,5,B000FICFEQ,"This video is best used in conjunction with other methods.  They are short clips on how to get a specific response from your dog.  It's not really a ""training"" video.  Assuming you already have some training experience or skills in place (and let's hope you do because this doesn't teach ""sit, stay or off"" which are needed immediately when you get home from the SPCA or breeder with your dog) this is an amazing video to get your dog to do some specific things very quickly.  For me, it has been a great supplement to training classes as well as books.  The training methods are kind and fun for both person and dog.  They are tricks, some useful, some just cute.",1208304000,2,664,4.446280991735537

Well, for the price you'd think it would be... easy to follow, but no. Instead of showing how it's done, it's narrated. The narrator's talking about what to do, but the video being shown is the dog chewing treats or something else that doesn't really help much. Most of the video were just short clips put together instead of showing the process of how it's done.

As for the narrated instructions, it would be like reading a book on how to teach tricks, so I'd suggest, just get a book. You can check out this one&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Everything-Dog-Training-and-Tricks-Book/dp/1580626661/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Everything Dog Training and Tricks Book</a>&nbsp;I also found a lot of free videos to watch on line that are more helpful.

Last thing, the video is soo short, maybe like 20 minutes or so, with 10 tricks!

To the trainer, if you ever read this comment, maybe you can put together a more step-by-step video, something like how they did the Train Your Dog video but on tricks. Thanks!",1205107200,2,1451,5.92822966507177
