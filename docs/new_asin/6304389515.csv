""Tramp, Tramp, Tramp"" is basically Harry Langdon's show.  He plays a young man named Harry whose dad (Alec B. Francis), owns a foundering shoe business that is way behind on its rent and so is about to be evicted.  To help his dad, he enters a cross-country walking contest with a prize of $25,000 sponsored by Burton Shoes, a big company that has no doubt taken some of his dad's business.  An additional incentive for him is Betty Burton (Crawford), whose photo graces the Burton Shoes billboards and who, not coincidentally, is the daughter of company owner John Burton (Edwards Davis).  Harry cannot pass a Burton Shoes billboard without stopping to admire Betty.  She sees him gazing at her photo and falls in love with him as well.  Harry's chief competition for the $25,000 prize is mean-spirited world champion walker Roger Caldwell, played by gruffly handsome John Murray.
During his trip across the country, Harry gets separated from his walking companions and encounters various perils.  At one point, he finds himself hanging from a fence overlooking a cliff; Harry played this scene himself on a real cliff with a several-hundred-foot drop.  Then he lands on a chain gang for stealing some food from a local farm, but breaks out with the other prisoners.  Finally, he faces a cyclone in Utah and protects his terrified rival Caldwell, the only other one left in the race by that point.  Back home, dad is following the race by means of the weekly newsreels at his local movie theater and gets to see Harry win the race at the last second, and Betty as well.
Nothing seems to faze Harry.  He's as nonchalant about the cyclone as he is about Caldwell's destroying various photos of Betty that he has apparently stolen from billboards around town and hung in his hotel room (never fear, he has others in reserve, one hidden in a perhaps-not-so-unexpected place).  And he isn't concerned about being detained on the chain gang, despite the fact that it could easily cost him the race.
Joan Crawford's role is relatively brief, but we do get to see plenty of her in the billboard shots.  She does establish more of a screen persona than I had expected, given the length of her role, but then again I shouldn't be too surprised, since she was destined for stardom.  And she looks beautiful in the styles of the period.
As filler to this 60-minute film, we get the two-reeler ""All Night Long"" from 1924.  In this short, told mostly in flashback, Harry plays a World War I soldier who steals charming Natalie Kingston from his sergeant, played by Vernon Dent, whose rough good looks recall John Murray's in the later film.  Harry's delicate, almost feminine, looks contrast sharply with those of his two rivals in these films, but nevertheless, in each case he wins both the day and the girl.
The picture quality of the films is excellent, especially ""Tramp, Tramp, Tramp"" which is also tinted.  A piano musical score accompanies each film.
Both films are certainly recommended for fans of silent comedies and fans of Harry Langdon, ""the fourth clown"" (after Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd).  And ""Tramp, Tramp, Tramp"" is, of course, required viewing for any Joan Crawford fan.",980208000,3,3461,4.806070826306914
7869557,5,6304389515,"Why Harry Langdon never reached the legenday status is way beyond me- these two movies showcase the baby Harry Langdon at his best.  Never a dull moment- watching the childlike clown try to save his father's failing  business is priceless.
I understand that Harry started directing his own  movies after his success with ""Tramp, Tramp, Tramp"" and went a  little overboard with pathos- what a shame...
These movies have the  absolute correct balance between pathos, comedy, melodrama and satire- a  perfect mix!  I highly, highly reccomend this.",954374400,3,544,5.183908045977011
