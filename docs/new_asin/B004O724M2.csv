4436728,2,B004O724M2,"""The Shining"" is a horrible film, just in terms of pure cinema, and in its interpretation of the novel. Nicholson is already crazy from the first frame, so there is no emotional investment by the audience as he sinks even further into madness. And I hate the substitution of an axe instead of a croquet mallet as the weapon at the end. But the most objectionable aspect of ""The Shining"" is its exuberant and calculated racism. The frequent gratuitous use of the ""N"" word, and the fact that the Scatman Crothers character, who is a hero in the book, is killed in the movie, is beyond insulting. It's as if Kubrick couldn't stomach an African-American hero, and it renders his character as completely superfluous. The other films in this set are good to great, and I will be buying most of them separately. I refuse to spend one cent on ""The Shining"", a great book turned into a disasterous film.",1306281600,5,894,4.59375

Really, what more can a guy ask for. I've been counting down the days since i found out about this in March. God, Kubrick's movies are so awesome.

1. The Shining
2. A Clockwork Orange (a very close second)
3. 2001: A Space Odyssey
4: Dr. Strangelove
5: Eyes Wide Shut
6: Full Metal Jacket (EWS and FMJ are not bad at all, in fact, they're both great. I just love the first four so much.)

I'm gonna come clean. I have yet to see Spartacus, Lolita, and Barry Lyndon. I know. Blasphemy. Poser. But all 6 of the movies I have seen by him, i've seen like 5-10 each. And i only just discovered who Stanley Kubrick was in February 2011 (cut me some slack, i'm only 15) and when i did, i caught the Kubrick fever. For everyone who is looking at this and have only seen a few of his movies, take a chance and buy the set, it's guaranteed not to let down.

I guess Criterion will wind up releasing ""The Killing"" on Blu-Ray at some point.

4436733,5,B004O724M2,"""Genius is the fire that lights itself."" That could very well describe the mystique of, and the body of work from, Stanley Kubrick, arguably one of the greatest filmakers of the 20th century. This collection represents 9 of his works, from 'Lolita' to 'Eyes wide Shut', released after his sudden death in March 1999. Although other directors have a larger number of films to their credit, it only took 13 directions to go in for Kubrick to cement his legacy in the annals of movie history. From my perspective, two flicks stand out to define his greatness: 'Spartacus' and '2001: a Space Odyssey'. To do something no one else has done before, and for everyone to pull from that influence since, is a testament to his courage and perfectionism. He once demanded an astonishing 75-plus takes for one scene in 'The Shining'. Needless to say, Shelley Duvall was not happy after that week of shooting in the cold. But the actors who were fortunate enough to work on one of his films became major stars because of their apearances, from James Earl Jones in 'Dr. Strangelove', to Malcolm McDowell in 'A Clockwork Orange', to R. Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio in 'Full Metal Jacket', and Lelee Sobieski in 'Eyes Wide Shut'. Kirk Douglas was so fond of his talent, he made sure he got to work with him twice. The bonus disc ""a Life In Pictures"" provides a great overview of his legacy.",1419552000,,1377,4.670781893004115

Two of these films are making their Blu-ray debut and everything except Full Metal Jacket has been remastered. This set comes loaded with extras for all the films (over 15 hours of total bonus content) except Lolita and Barry Lyndon. Fans will want to upgrade to this set if they can find a copy. Everything from the stand-alone BD releases of these films is included so if you don't own many Kubrick movies on Blu-ray then you will appreciate the royal treatment. The final disc in the Stanley Kubrick Limited Edition Collection is actually the second disc from the 40th Anniversary Edition release of A Clockwork Orange with two documentaries: Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures (SD, 142 minutes) and O Lucky Malcolm! (HD, 86 minutes). Four of Kubrick's earliest films are not included: Fear and Desire (1953), Killer's Kiss (1955), The Killing (1956), and Paths of Glory (1957). All are available for sale individually on Blu-ray except Killer's Kiss (DVD only).

Spartacus [25 minutes of extras.]
Dr. Strangelove [133 minutes of extras.]
2001 [221 minutes of extras.]
A Clockwork Orange [108 minutes of extras.]

Not worth the trouble of returning since the disks are intact.

These 9 films are among the most stylish, visually stunning, intelligent movies ever, and watching them is always a pleasure. This package contains newly restored copies of all of them, and they look great in DVD and/or Blu-Ray. I saw everything from 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY on in theaters when they were first released, so you have an idea of how long I've admired them. And the bonus documentary about the obsessive/compulsive, difficult-but-generous genius who made them is fascinating.

Other reviewers here quibble about the physical packaging of the discs, but I don't have a problem with it--if you're careful with them, you'll be fine. They also argue that some of the aspect ratios are wrong, but I wouldn't know about that--they all look fine to me. As for the films themselves--well, we're all going to have favorites and others we don't like so much, and that's true for me. But even my least favorite film here is better than most other movies.

Anyone who is seriously interested in the art of moviemaking must see these films. There's never been another director like him--he's one of the artists who caused critics to coin the word ""visionary"" to describe him. I really recommend this excellent boxed set.

It's the slip-case sort of deal where just pulling the blu-ray out of it will leave scratches.  Most of them were in so tight that it was near impossible to get them out without effort.  While I appreciate all of the pictures that went with each film, the slip cases were awful.

It's a MUST HAVE!

Let's look at the Kubrick Legacy...

The Films of Stanley Kubrick:

FEAR AND DESIRE (1953)
A little-known, rarely seen, very low budgeted, Military Adventure film.
Short, crudely edited, and with a crew of only 15 people, Fear and Desire is Stanley Kubrick getting to grips with his style. He later tried to prevent it from being screened, since he had little love for his debut.
Fear and Desire is not memorable. Only a true Kubrick fan would love it.
It's Kubrick...experimenting, learning, growing.

KILLER'S KISS (1955)
A film noir, typical of that day and age, with the tagline, ""Her Soft Mouth Was the Road to Sin-Smeared Violence!""
As a film noir, Killer's Kiss was not exceptionally memorable, it didn't break any new ground, or have any big name stars.

But the cinematography is excellent! Kubrick perfectly captured the seedy streets of New York, and the lighting and camerawork is testament to Kubrick's genius at an early age (26).
The story is tense, and actually quite exciting. The acting is great, too.
In the words of TV Guide:
""Killer's Kiss is no one's idea of a great film but it displays much evidence of future brilliance.""

THE KILLING (1956)
Another exciting film noir! As the tagline says, ""In all if's Fury and Violence...Like no other Picture since ""Scarface"" and ""Little Caesar""!
THIS is Stanley Kubrick's first great film, and the one that truly put him on the map as a director. Regarded as one of the greatest film noir's, The Killing is one of Quentin Tarantino's favorite films, borrowed heavily upon for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reservoir-Dogs/dp/B001DM1V52/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reservoir Dogs</a>.

The Killing has a stellar script, wonderful acting, and a convoluted plot. It's tense, clever, and is the first example of Kubrick's beautiful visual style, crammed with details, and wonderful cinematography.

Note: Many thanks to Joel Walden for editing this video.
Note 2: This review will be updated with the rest of Kubrick's films soon!",1351641600,3,2535,5.964187327823692

4436773,2,B004O724M2,"Damn near all of these films are low bitrate encodes from the HDDVD years, below 20Mbps FFS, and that is just not going to cut it with me on premium bluray releases. This format is easily capable of 35Mbps on 2 hours releases and there is just no damn reason not to do this.

I have never bought a Kubrick film on Bluray because inevitably these will be released in more definitive volumes at a later date. Without the higher bitrate the films simply are not going to look close to optimal on large screens although they are decent. I think most of these films speak for themselves. None are bad films. My favorites are 2001, The Shining, and EWS. Haven't seen Lolita in some time although that one might have had a decent transfer. It's funny because instead of pumping up the bitrate for Clockwork on the 40th release they clipped a doc and then added another doc and called it a day with the exact same transfer. For shame.

If these were state of the art transfers this set would be a 10 out of 5.

If you are going to charge a premium then for the love of the lord don't throw in your HDDVD transfers from half a decade ago.",1349222400,12,1129,4.266355140186916

4436776,5,B004O724M2,Stanley Kubrick is one of the greatest film directors of all time.  Every movie in this collection is a great film.  Each one looks fantastic on blu ray.  Although Lolita and Dr. Strangelove are in black and white so the quality isn't as obvious as the color films but it is still clear and crisp.  2001: A Space Odyssey still looks cutting edge.  It's hard to believe they were able to achieve such great special effects in 1968.  Nine years later they couldn't even make Star Wars special effects look as good.  If you are a Stanley Kubrick fan you have to have this collection.  It includes all but three of his films I believe.  I read some reviews about the discs being difficult to pull from the sleeves and how it might result in scratches to the discs.  I will say they are in the sleeves pretty good but I don't think it will result in scratching.  You have to grip the disc with your fingers to pull it out and that will result in some smudging but so far my discs have not been scratched.  I really don't see that as the deal breaker anyway.

There's no need to do a review for the films, because that's been done several times elsewhere, and if you are looking to but this package then you will already know how good these movies are. However, there's an issue with the packaging of the blu-ray discs. That is not a lie, be warned. I don't know if it is bad enough as to ""destroy"" the discs, as someone else said, but it might just damage them, because it makes it real hard to handle them, and it ends up scratching the discs. What I did was to just put the discs in separate cases and save the original box more as a souvenir than as a storing device for blu-ray discs.
Hope you find this review useful!",1335139200,2,834,4.21875
4436779,1,B004O724M2,"I've seen all the movies and already had some on DVD, so this Blu-Ray collection was just an upgrade for my collection. I bought this on sale so I got the nine movies for about six and a half dollars apiece. I haven't watched them yet, but I'd give just the movie set 5 stars if they came in any kind of useful packaging. Instead they are packed in a ""book"" with nine fat ""pages"" and the movies are slid in the side of each of those fat pages. If they slid in and out easily, that would be OK since the pages face into the book cover and can't fall out. Instead, the pages are really tight and the disks not only won't slide out, they won't even shake out.

The only way to get the disks out is to stick your finger in between the top of the disk and the thin cardboard cover and push down and slide it out a little. It only comes out a little since there is a bump inside the top and bottom of the inside of the page that prevents it from sliding easily more than about an inch out of the page. You then have to get a piece of Kleenex or toilet tissue or some other soft paper and fold it over the stuck out part of the disk and pull it out the rest of the way. I didn't have any scratches on my disks, but if you drag the disks in and out a lot, they'll be draging their playing surface back and forth across the cardboard which can't be good for their surface.

The ""book"" is a really pretty way to keep the disks, with pictures and text on each of the facing ""pages"" about that movie, but a horrible way to get to the disks if you actually want to play them a lot. A better solution would be to just keep the book on the shelf as a curio and put the movies into nine DVD slim cases and set them next to the book. Barring that, if you could find some of those old paper sleeves that DVDs and CDs use to come in, you might try putting the disks in them and trying to slide those in and out, tho it would probably be a tight fit unless you cut the top and bottom of the sleeve off, but at least it would protect the disk surface from sliding over the cardboard.

Neither of these is that big of deal to me, but in a perfect world, original aspect versions and all of his films would have been included.  The transfer quality to Blu-ray is exceptional and the packaging is great.  You have to pull pretty hard on each disc to get it out of its respective sleeve, but that's fine.  You don't want the discs falling out and you pretty much have to skate around on Blu-rays to damage them.

4436786,4,B004O724M2,"Overall, the appearance of these films befit the greatness of a director known for his stunning visual style: The transfers are crisp, bright but not saturated, revealing in terms of the nearly garish color schemes Stanley Kubrick chose for some films, especially ""A Clockwork Orange.""

I compared these transfers to my two previous Kubrick collections, both of which were issued on DVD. On those earlier sets, even Kubrick's later films could suffer terribly. Case in point: The print of ""Eyes Wide Shut"" used for the 2001-released box was truly wretched -- dark, smudgy, surprisingly grainy. And of course that version still included the infamous CGI figures in the orgy scenes, but my understanding was that was what Kubrick wanted at the time.

There isn't a brad transfer on this new blu-ray set. As for the continuing argument over Kubrick aspect ratios, I think it should be a non-issue by now. HD and widescreen TVs and playback devices were not common home-theater features at the time of Kubrick's death. They're ubiquitous now, and I am convinced Kubrick would be appreciative of the wider aspects. Even a moderately priced, properly calibrated home theater system now can approximate the cinema experience, thanks to blu-ray's superior visuals and sound quality.

Now the quibbles:

1. If you're going to put out a set that includes nine films from a director who only ever released 12 (not counting the withdrawn ""Fear and Desire""), why not just go ahead and do them all? Including ""Killer's Kiss,"" ""The Killing"" and ""Paths of Glory,"" along with the films here plus the included ""Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures"" bio would have made for a total of 13 movies, 12 of them stunning and one, the biopic, admirable. Fortunately, though, the re-releases of ""Paths of Glory"" and ""The Killing"" were given over to Criterion, which did a GREAT job -- Criterion even included a transfer of ""Killer's Kiss"" on the release of ""The Killing."" Thus, at this writing, all of Kubrick's films are available in high definition, which is as it should be.

2. I've read numerous comments here about the packaging, pro and con, and I am going to have to come down on the con side. The cardboard slots for the discs are simply too tight (the opposite of most box sets, where the discs can shift around during shipping). Getting each disc out required a great deal of care. For fear of scratching them over time, I took mine out permanently and stored them in individual aftermarket sleeves. It may look klunky on the shelves, but it protects this investment.

3. I found the ""O Lucky Malcolm"" documentary to be rather annoying and tiresome. Part of the problem is Malcolm McDowell himself. He's a great actor, no doubt, and Alex in ""A Clockwork Orange"" is his greatest role. I knew McDowell could be abrasive, and have no problem with that, but in this documentary he comes off as very self-aggrandizing. This was directed by Jan Harlan, Kubrick's brother-in-law and sometimes executive producer. Harlan also directed the ""Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures"" documentary, which remains part of this box set, and that film truly was moving and magical. Given a choice of a full-length actor bio for this box, I would have gone instead with the mysterious Keir Dullea from ""2001"" or the elegant James Mason from ""Lolita.""

Again, these are minor objections to this set. I believe Kubrick to be the greatest filmmaker of the cinema's first century. I find I can view his films over and over and over again, finding nuances I had not considered before. It takes greatness to make art to which we are compelled to return, time and again. This set is a document of the man's genius.",1334275200,,3670,4.843700159489633

It begins with BARRY LYNDON and says ""Widescreen Version presented in a format preserving the aspect ratio of its original camera negative"". Well, the ratio is 4x3 and NOT AT ALL a widescreen version. First lie.
About LOLITA, DR. STRANGELOVE and FULL METAL JACKET, the whole three presented in 4x3, the cover informs, once more erroneously, ""Widescreen version presented in a 'matted' widescreen format preserving the aspect ratio of their original theatrical exhibitions enhanced for widescreen TVS"". Second lie. Nothing is true. Only A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, THE SHINING and EYES WIDE SHUT are correctly presented in 16x9 ratio as it should be for all the others. Come on! At least since 1955 no pictures were made in the 4x3 ratio, but some in 1.66 and more of the times 1.85. How could somebody make a picture in the 4x3 ratio (or 1.33) knowing that all movie theatres around the world would not respect it and surely would chop the frame to 1.66 or 1.85?
The third lie is the worst. SPARTACUS and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, the only two of the lot filmed in 2.35 do not receive the same treatment. While 2001 is well presented in the correct aspect, SPARTACUS is a poor letterboxed version that ruins the scope and spectacle of this celebrated blockbuster. Absurd. How can we trust in the information of a DVD cover with such unaccuracies? I'll be much careful the next time.

4436794,3,B004O724M2,"Admittedly often gorgeous upgrades of titles I already had on dvd and laser. Beautiful transfers, but the packaging is subpar and makes me look at the entire package in a less than favorable light.  The actual disc packages that are available if one buys the titles separately are not here. They are replaced by a contraption in which the discs themselves are crammed into this super cheap album of seven sleeves with very narrow slits into which  the slivers are inserted . Very inconvenient, and probably, dangerous to the discs if you try to insert and reinsert them over time, fingerprints are inevitable and scratches lurk in the future, I'm sure. I hate this packaging. THE LAUREL AND HARDY ESSENTIAL COLLECTION sues the same type of apparatus for it's ten discs, but access to them is easier to handle, The slits are wider and one can get the discs out without fingering the actual media.

I really wanted this Kubrick set , the first instant it came out, but the price was way too steep to re-buy all the crap again. So, I bought BARRY LYNDON, separately, which was only available, at first, from Amazon. The original dvd wasn't even anamorphic, and this blu ray transfer promised to be superlative.  After that, I re-bought CLOCKWORK and was dazzled buy it. I even had the high def of it. Then, a month or so down the road, Amazon had one of those day- long sales for the whole pile for sixty bucks. I grabbed it.

All of the titles look pretty impressive, but it is just too irritating. Why did I have to rebuy all of this stuff? The improvements, most of the time, aren't all that impressive.

A clockwork Orange is systematic of how life was evolving in England at the period in which the movie was made.  Barry Lyndon is one of my favorites because it is a period piece and the Shining is successful because of Steven King.  Full Metal Jacket is over the top but very well directed.  Just ask Vietnam Veterans and Vietnamese Veterans about the real war, Eyes Wide Shut is very well done and there are people in New York City that acctually lived that life style as in (Plato's Retreat) Broadway and the Upper Westside, basement of the Ansonia Bldg.

I purchased it as part of a Gold Box Deal of the Day for nearly half off but I easily would have paid full price as well.  It's worth it.  This set collects 9 of Kubrick's most beloved films across 9 discs, plus another DVD of further special features.

I hardly think I need to review the films them selves as each is a classic in their own right.  This set includes Lolita, Sparticus, Dr. Strangelove: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange,  The Shining, Full Metal Jacket, and Eyes Wide Shut

(For those wondering I have not yet seen whether or not this set includes the American or International cut of Eyes Wide Shut.  In the American Theatrical version of the film, the studio digitally imposed several figures to block some of the more graphic imagery)

 Many of the Individual movies have special features as well, including commentaries from the star's of the films and film historians.  The transfer of the films to disc are some of the best I've seen on DVD and they look and sound terrific.

I have seen some voice concerns about the way 10 discs are packaged bus rest assured the design of the DVD case it quite elegant.  The discs are held in by the usual manner, with the clip going through the hole.  Two of the discs are attached to the insides of the case its self, one on each side. The other discs are clipped on to hinged plastic pieces, similar to many 2 disc DVD sets.  They are clipped 1 on each side of these turn-able plastic pages.  The way the discs are set and the plastic hinged ensures that the discs never hang each other up.  To remove each disc simply use you finger tips around the edge of the disc to lift.  This the way Discs are supposed to be picked up anyways and I have to question the basic motor functions of those who were infuriated and perplexed by this packaging.

Each disc is skinned with a solid color making for a sleek and easily discernible collection of movies.

Lastly, this set comes with a short but interesting booklet providing some context and history for each of the films as well as explaining the progression of the themes in Kubrick's work over the course of his career.

This is a great set to own if you simply enjoy Kubrick's films or if you want to pour over them for days.",1323648000,,2377,4.405963302752293

4436814,5,B004O724M2,"Stanley Kubrick is often regarded as one the greatest film maker of all time, and his films often share a similar title, as some of the greatest films of all time. Stanley Kubrick is a personal favorite of mine, and I've been waiting for a Blu-Ray collection of his best films for a long while. Here it is: Stanley Kubrick: Limited Edition Collection.

I'm not going to review every movie, but the presentation as a whole. This is a nice box set, and a lot of time was put into the making of it. The Blu-Ray disc are presented in cardboard pages in a huge book, along with a 40 page book with back stories, details, and summaries to all of the films included. This all very nice, and luckily I grabbed this as soon as they dropped it down to 60 dollars for one day only. Best 60 dollars I've spent without thinking yet!

Though my one negative comment is indeed on the packaging. The book is nice, and I like the flip book idea containing each movie on a separate page. However getting the movies out of these cases are a real pain, and an even more pain if you're a huge movie buff, and you take pride in the condition of things like this. They are packed in so tight, that you are bound to get a smudge on there trying to get out, and maybe even a scratch or two (though on Blu-Ray that doesn't really matter regardless).
It's still a pain, but I'm going to go out and buy a separate case for all these Blu-Rays.

This is well worth the money, and highly recommended for film buffs and artists.",1320969600,2,1496,4.242105263157895
4436815,5,B004O724M2,"If you were part of a film making company back in those days you just had to go see the newest Kubrick film.  Same today except you can see it as often as you need at home.  Kubrick always was food for thoughts.  Thinkers love the films,

In regard to 2001, I saw it when it opened in a big Century theater.  Most of the viewers back then didn't respect it very much.  I liked it as I had read and studied both ancient human species and space sciences. It was so unique, a thinkers film.

In regard to a previous post about a missing bathroom scene, it is on my blu-ray single release in the moon ship voyage from earth to the moon.  Not in the earth orbiting space station.

The single release is listed as 16x9 2.2:1 and it plays at 2.2:1 which was Super Panavision 70 back then.

The sound is splendid.

I must assume this collection contains exactly the same film as the single release.",1320883200,,890,4.207100591715976

4436817,5,B004O724M2,"My son wants to study film in college and asked for this collection for Christmas. We've gone through each movie in order and I'm continually amazed at Kubrick's scope of work throughout the decades. He runs the gambit of period pieces from ""Spartacus"" to ""Barry Lyndon"". Each film has it's own perspective and unique vision of the time--""A Clockwork Orange"" is a groovy trip to the '60's!! I had forgotten what a masterpiece ""2001"" was as well. Full Metal Jacket, Lolita,The Shining were all given the Kubrick treatment.  A MUST have for anyone interested in his work from the early '60's on up. The closed captioning works well for each film, as does the extras available. The digital restorations are magnificent. ""Barry Lyndon"" is a visual treat that jumps off the screen. The story might be dull but the scenery sure isn't!
Makes a great gift.",1313971200,4,848,4.808219178082192
4436818,4,B004O724M2,"While, as other noted reviewers have expressed, yes, most of the Blu-ray's in this set have been available previously. But altogether at once, including Dr. Strangelove, Spartacus, Lolita (first time on Blu), and Barry Lyndon (also first time on Blu), along with the new 40th anniversary edition of A Clockwork Orange? Yes, I'd say it's safe to venture that this set is worth the seemingly steep price. Because yes, at first glance, it seems like a lot of money until you realize the value at hand.

But value aside, the transfers are mostly fantastic, especially the transfer on my favorite of Kubrick's films, 2001: A Space Odyssey. The colors are crisp and the details are fantastic, especially the black and white on Lolita. I am so glad that this film had finally achieved a release on Blu Ray.

My only complaint is the lack of new features on the previously released discs and the lack of ANY FEATURES on Lolita and Barry Lyndon. Fans have been waiting years for these releases and we now only get half of a release (the other half should have contained a commentary by an expert AT LEAST). But the transfers are fantastic, making it a satisfying purchase.

Overall, I am especially happy with this release, save for the complaints that I have previously listed. I'd give the box set a four out of five.",1313798400,16,1310,4.6869565217391305

in the United States, rather than the ""Bible Belt"" version.  The most obvious omission in
the ""Bible Belt"" version is the scene in which a shuttle passenger is seen gnawing on his
knuckle through a window. We get inside and see that he is sitting down, and the focus
shifts so that the plaque he is reading becomes visible: ""Instructions for Operating Zero
Gravity Toilet.""  This was the funniest moment in the film, but is omitted from the ""Bible
Belt"" version, which I accidentally purchased. So, how do you get the good version?",1312156800,,621,4.486725663716814
4436821,5,B004O724M2,"12 years after his death, Kubrick still casts a massive shadow over popular cinema. His early works showed a mind itching to escape the constraints of formal Hollywood, and although Killer's Kiss is a frustrating exercise in limitation, The Killing is a great film and worth seeking out. His formal visual style and suspension of moral judgement began to hit their straps with Paths of Glory. Douglas, who starred in Paths, sought Kubrick out as a replacement director on Spartacus, the first and least interesting film in this box, very much a formula epic in which Kubrick's talents and interests were subjugated to the studio's requirements. As a reaction, Lolita and the subsequent seven films were shot in the UK under Kubrick's direct control and final cut. Lolita is often overlooked, but introduced his fascination with the banality of manners and society as a thin skin concealing far more unsavoury motivations and intentions. Humbert's folly is allowed to play out in pathetic, almost excruciating humiliation, a pattern revisited in Barry Lyndon and Eyes Wide Shut. Strangelove revels in its pitch black humour and looks pretty fantastic, glad that Sony and Warner could join forces to include it here. 2001 is a visual jewel, the high-def showing details I'd only seen in a 70mm viewing before, and the colours are perfectly rendered, enhancing the film's meditative effect. Clockwork Orange looks the best I've seen it, its garish madness and loopy satire brought to all-too-vivid life. Barry Lyndon benefits the most from high def I think - the previous DVD flatness and awkward aspect ratio are swept away by a vivid and detailed transfer which contrasts beautifully with the ugly banality and greed of Barry's failure, just as intended. The Shining is likewise beautiful, although the sweeping shots of the opening really pick up the 24p motion stagger for some reason. LIke all Kubrick's films, this is both a story laid out in meticulous detail, and a world to revisit - the director's austerity and lack of the crashingly obvious leave the film wide open to interpretation and discovery. Full Metal Jacket is a great film where the familiar structure and order of training is matched by tight editing and deft storytelling in the first half, only to unreel into chaos in the fact of actual combat. The director's insistence on exact lighting and set dressing is revealed by the beautiful tone of this also-excellent transfer. And last, the enigma of Eyes Wide Shut, a film made with the trappings and hallmarks of Hollywood cinema but a dark heart of paranoia and contempt (or acknowledgement) for our moral failings in the midst of wealth, comfort and education.
Blu-ray is great for Kubrick freaks like myself - it simply gets out of the way, presenting the films in superb transfers to allow the technical exactness of his presentation to come across. It's not an exaggeration to say that the quality of these discs actually allows the films to breathe, and to speak the director's mind directly without compromise. Since he used to care so much that he would have staff personally contact cinemas to check on projection equipment and the aspect ratio of masks, this is clearly not a trivial aspect of his art, and I am glad I've been able to own them in such outstanding quality.

The packaging is tight, but if you are careful you should have no trouble removing the discs without damage. Furthermore, Blu-ray discs are made to be resistant to damage (scratches included).

4436828,5,B004O724M2,"I won't review the films themselves.  I have done so elsewhere, and if you are reading this, you probably are a Kubrick fan, anyway.  My set arrived yesterday and I have spent some quality time with it, though I have obviously not had a chance to watch every disk all the way through, yet.

On one user's negative review with respect to the ""destructive"" packaging: all I can say is, if you stop and think about it before wailing on the disks trying to get them out of their sleeves, you'll be FINE.  The sleeves, are indeed, engineered to keep the disks in, so they don't fall on the floor if you tip the package the wrong way.  A moment's thought will tell you that a thumb on the label side of the disk, a forefinger on the edge, and some firm but gentle pulling while rotating a little is all you need to get the disks out without a hint of damage.  The sleeve will release its grip and all will be well.  Believe me, you'll be glad for the snugness of the fit when you realize how well it protects the disks when you're not watching them.

On the continuing Aspect Ratio controversy: I could be wrong about this, but I think the esteemed Mr. Kubrick would be fine with the 16x9 cropping of The Shining, Full Metal Jacket, and Eyes Wide Shut.  It's true that Kubrick initially only wanted videos of his films released ""full frame"", i.e. with the whole negative image showing unmasked, because he hated pan-scan, and thought letterboxing distracting.  After Barry Lyndon, he shot 35mm without a hard matte, but composed for 1.85:1 precisely because he knew some theaters would project it 1.85:1 while others would go for 1.66:1, and still others would have their own ""custom"" aspect ratio - i.e. funky screen size based more on the way larger theaters were being chopped up into multiplexes at the time, than on the needs of the films being shown.  But newer 16x9 HD TVs, which became popular after his death, largely obviated the need for near full-negative cropping, as far as video is concerned. Kubrick's visual compositions are just slightly roomy in 16x9, without the oddly empty quality of some of his shots when viewed in full-frame on a 4x3 TV.  There are purists who get almost violent when discussing the ""proper"" aspect ratios of Kubrick's *oeuvre* on video, and who insist we should be watching them in 4x3 even now, because ""that's what he intended.""  I am not among them.  His original reasoning made sense when TVs were all squarish, but I think he would have accommodated 16x9 home theatre TVs, had he lived into the Blu-ray era. Such TVs existed in his lifetime, but they were not the norm the way they are now. If you read his interviews carefully, he was a surprisingly practical guy, for being such a perfectionist.

The transfers appear, in most cases, to be the same ones used for the last  release of the collection, but in a format closer to their native 4k resolution.  They are - thank God - NOT over-enhanced the way so many mass-market ""popular"" films seem to be when released on Blu-ray, these days.  While they are sharp and detailed, they don't have those artificially ""cut out"" looking edges, either.  I'm not a videophile, but I like what I see and hear.",1307404800,200,3191,4.566666666666666

The packaging for the new Kubrick box set has slots for each disc with a point too narrow to remove the disc.  If you cut open any of the sleeves, you'll find that the cardboard on the top and bottom has a sort of nub on each side, making the pathway by which the disc would be removed slightly smaller than the disc itself.  In order to remove the disc, you have to grab a hold of it with your thumb on the info surface and yank very hard.  The close tight space the disc is in is just cardboard, some of the slots had debris which put gashes in the each disc removed.  The packaging literally destroys every disc removed from it as intended.  I managed to save a few of my own discs by cutting open the packaging (Hence how I saw the nub cuplrits) but this has rendered the set unreturnable, so I'm out a hundred bucks with the prospect of buying up separate discs.
