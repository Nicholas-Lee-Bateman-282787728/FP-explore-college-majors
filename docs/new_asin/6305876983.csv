7897279,5,6305876983,"A great choice for anyone revisiting their childhood or introducing someone new to the transformers. Great episodes are on this tape (in two episodes Decepticons work with Autobots for a common goal, pretty rare.) One two part story and the rest are individual episodes, and you see Galvatron in a humourous position where he is forced to go through theripy by his own guys.
  Great entertainment, probably even more for adults (very well thought out.) If you liked the early episodes check out the Ultimate Doom too.

7897281,3,6305876983,"I got these tapes awhile back, and enjoyed them when I first watched them.  The Return of Optimus Prime was THE best tape because it returned an icon to television in Optimus Prime.  The animation in that one was top notch too.  The story on the other hand, was of course for the kiddies, so I came to the realization that, I've grown up, and this is something I should leave behind for future generations to watch.  As good as it was when I was a kid, it's for kids.  Period.  The other two tapes, I'll avoid because (while they were good when I watched them as a kid) they were entirely storyless and meant for the kiddie group as well.  I'll keep my Transformers Movie to watch over and over, but for these, I'll let my future kids watch them.",991699200,,746,4.24822695035461
7897282,5,6305876983,"Why is this a very solid selection for a present, gift, or just to entertain yourself? It contains the return of Optimus Prime, who is hands-down, THE best and wisest leader in the history of the Autobots (Rodimus who?). That right there should be worth the price of purchase, but it also contains two very smartly-written Grimlock episodes on Volume 9. These episodes prove that even though Grimlock may not be the smartest cookie, he certainly was entertaining to listen to when he spoke. Plus, he knew more about what was happening in the modern world than the other Autobots would ever let on. Overall, this set of videos is a great gift idea for anybody who grew up in the 80s watching these cartoons(like me). I give it two thumbs up!",976924800,,740,4.613636363636363

7897284,5,6305876983,I can't believe how many episodes have been re-released in such a short time. This set is espically good! It has one of the rare TF episodes Return of Optimus Prime! The other episodes are all from season 3 and are good  too. I just hope Rhino releases more episodes from season 2 since there  were almost none released in the 80s.,961200000,2,331,4.32258064516129
7897285,4,6305876983,"We have here:  transformers, Vol. 7: Return of Optimus Prime,  -- 1) The Return of Optimus Prime Part 1 ( -- An evil scientist and his assistant decide it's time to rid Earth of Autobots and Decepticons. Their plan is to  use Optimus Prime's lifeless body to lure every robot to their lab, then  infect them with Sun Spores, an alien plague that instills a hatred so  overwhelming that Autobots and Decepticons will want to destroy one  another. It's too late to stop the madness when it's clear the Sun Spore  virus is deadly to all life. The universe's only hope is to revive Optimus  Prime.  -- 2) Return of Optimus Prime Part 2 ( -- Sky Lynx returns with the  only being able to repair Optimus Prime - a Quintesson. If Optimus  recovers, he and his Autobots will need to find a metal alloy that will  protect Prime from Sun Spores while he ventures inside a virtual world  containing the wisdom of the ages. Their destination lies deep inside  heavily guarded Decepticon territory. Now both Autobot and Decepticon must  put aside their differences and work together if either expects to survive.
Transformers, Vol. 8: Evil Experiment, -- 1) The Killing Jar ( -- An  evil Quintesson scientist assembling specimens from throughout the galaxy  has decided to complete his collection. Next on his list: Ultra Magnus,  Cyclonus, Wreck-Gar, and Marissa Faireborn(Flint(of G.I. Joe)'s daughter).  Using his superior intellect and advanced technology, he lures them aboard,  and once there, runs ghastly experiments. When an unforeseen incident  occurs, the Quintesson must turn to his specimens for help if any of them  expect to survive.  -- 2) Webworld ( -- When Galvatron's rage is turned  on his own troop, Cyclonus and his Decepticons lure Galvatron to Torkulon,  a hospice planet. There he's imprisoned and forced to undergo one radical  treatment after another. When all fail, only one last hope remains, a  radical procedure called Maximal Intervention. Even if cured, Galvatron may  end up a shell of his former self. The caretakers interface their patient  directly into planet Torkulon, and what happens next could spell doom for  everyone.
Transformers, Vol. 9: Grimlock the Hero,  -- 1) Madman's  Paradise ( -- Grimlock and the ambassador(Spike Witwicky)'s son, Daniel,  are accidentally transported to another dimension where magic rules supreme  on a planet called Minonia. Saved from a barbarous band of thugs, Daniel  and Grimlock dine alongside their savior in his castle and learn of The Red  Wizard and his plight against Minonia's tribal bands. Little do they know  their rescuer is not who he appears to be. Back on Cybertron, the Autobots  must decipher some ancient hieroglyphics in order to rescue Daniel and  Grimlock.  -- 2) Grimlock's New Brain ( -- Grimlock turns into a genius  after shutting down a power core gone critical. That intelligence will come  in handy when Galvatron gets his hands on some anti-electrons - a substance  capable of scrambling Autobot circuits. The last remaining source is within  Unicron's decapitated head floating in space. It's a race to Unicron, where  both Autobot and Decepticon alike will have more to deal with than just  battling one another.
Hope to give you all some good info with this.",958867200,25,3254,5.00936329588015
