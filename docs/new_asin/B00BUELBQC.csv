8574044,5,B00BUELBQC,"This show is hilarious! A young man is sent to Coolum Aus. to run the police caravan that takes calls from the crazy Coolum citizens. With help from Barry Crocker (who is amazingly wonderful), as the town's night watchman. This is a fresh and very funny show. It's a funny X Files meets Grimm like show with episodes dealing in a Pet Cemetery cat, a man who ate too much fast food chicken and a song that makes a couple of residents do damage to the small community and more. It's so sad that there are not more episodes because this is a seriously great show. I saw it on Netflix recently and looked it up on Amazon where you can buy the Australian DVD. I highly recommend watching what little there is of The Strange Calls-with its revival on Netflix, maybe they can make a few more! I was sorely disappointed when I realized there are only a few episodes of this wonderful show because I was prepared to watch as many as I could, but apparently they didn't continue it and there is only one short season. It's a real shame because this is one funny and great show-a rarity these days.",1474588800,7,1087,4.333333333333333
