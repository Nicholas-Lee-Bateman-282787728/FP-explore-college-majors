1367429,5,B00004XMSJ,"Definitely a keeper! I've never been to Ireland, but this story makes you want to know more of it and the folks in the movie. At the end, young Sean (I think that was the character's name) is setting out to see the world... what a great sequel that would make.

As soon as it's available on DVD, I'll buy it.",1130025600,4,308,4.049180327868853
1367430,5,B00004XMSJ,"What a gem!!  This movie has a little something for all.  Usually mom's movies are not watched by the teens, but this movie is the exception.  Not just once but several times.

The characters are charming enough to be endearing, yet exasperating enough to be believable.  A fine balance not to be seen in many films.

Put on the popcorn, sit back, relax, laugh and enjoy!",1129852800,6,371,4.545454545454546
1367431,5,B00004XMSJ,The Closer You Get- the harder it is to see the things that are staring you in the face- as the boys in this small Irish village find out.  No matter where you live- you can relate to what the people of this small village feel (and do). The humor in this movie is light and refreshing. The music is just as fun (I recommend the soundtrack as well). This movie ranks up in my top 10 of the year.,1004227200,12,394,3.925
1367432,4,B00004XMSJ,"This is a quaint and charming little comedy about life and love in rural northwestern Ireland.  The question remains, how many rural Irish comedies can we watch before the material starts to get stale.  The story begins with the single men of this little town complaining that the women are substandard and there are no marriage prospects.  After downing far too many pints, they decide to place an advertisement in the Miami Herald to see if they can induce some American women to come to Ireland to the big town dance.  When the townswomen get wind of the scheme, they invite some Spanish fishermen to the same dance.  The result is a succession of comical situations where everyone makes fools of themselves in anticipation of the big day.  The net result of all this is the lesson Dorothy learned when she left Kansas; that when you are looking for your heart's desire, you don't have to look any further than your own backyard.
Aileen Ritchie's directorial debut was marked by some nice photography of well-selected locations and an alluring portrayal of the local color and appeal.  The characters all seemed very genuine and unaffected; the way country folks generally are regardless of national origin.  The scenes leading up to the dance work well, but the film bogs down after the dance as the tone changes from mirthful to dramatic.
The acting was generally good with a couple of standouts.  Ian Hart stole the show as Kieran the headstrong town butcher.  He was simultaneously affable and obnoxious.  His character's complete obliviousness to how ridiculous he was gave Hart ample opportunity to become a laugh magnet.  Niahm Cusack was also enchanting as Kate, mixing mischievousness with romantic appeal to create a delightful character.
I rated this film a 7/10.  It is very light fare, silly enough that it will get a chuckle or two out of almost everyone.",970185600,,1872,4.886075949367089
1367433,4,B00004XMSJ,I thought this movie was cute and charming.  Worth renting or buying (once the price drops from 103.00!)  If you love all things Irish try this one.,967852800,,148,4.444444444444445

1367463,5,B00004XMSJ,"This Irish story is about a group of men, young and single up to older players, who live in a small seaside village. The men and women are so used to seeing each other on a daily basis that they no longer recognize how beautiful their own women are, so they place an add in an American newspaper for brides. The Irish women plot to wake up the men to what they already have and don't see. The touching moments are real. The funny Irish reasoning and tempers are so good that the watcher forgets about the American women on the way. A very good comedy with a lot of truth mixed in.",1417305600,6,580,4.1415929203539825

1367466,5,B00004XMSJ,"I searched for this movie without knowing the title for YEARS.  After seeing a preview in the theater the film never came to my area. I can't tell you how ecstatic I was to finally learn the title and get a copy of my own!  It's hilarious, well-acted, and the soundtrack is absolutely lovely. I've never been to Ireland, but someday I WILL go, and it will be because of this film.  (And my family roots.)",1388016000,,404,4.2894736842105265
1367467,5,B00004XMSJ,"Absolutely wonderful. Forget the awful cover - this is a clever and delightful movie.  The story of a group of men who decide that they should try to put an advertisement in an american paper to bring 'sporty and fit' women to town for possible matrimony is a mix of funny, sweet and even bitter.  It was quite well executed.",1385856000,2,325,4.4

This has never happened to me before and I order movies frequently. The question for you is, why would you be selling this version in the first place and then shipping it to someone living in Oklahoma?",1385683200,,330,4.171875

1367470,4,B00004XMSJ,"In a small village in Ireland, the single men of the town hit upon the idea of advertising in a Miami newspaper for ""sporty, fit American girls between 20 and 21"" to be their brides. Naturally, the women of the town look upon this scheme with a jaundiced and sarcastic eye. The film follows the fortunes of several of the men and women in vignettes both comical and poignant, culminating in a satisfying conclusion for all.

This amusing and heartfelt good-natured film is a small gem (and also uses the Proclaimers' rousing ""I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)"" to good advantage for one montage sequence).",1373846400,,596,4.730769230769231

It was quirky, funny, a little serious at times, not exactly as uproariously funny as we expected, but still well done.",1359072000,,279,4.490196078431373
1367484,1,B00004XMSJ,"This is a great movie and I'm so happy that I found it here and bought myself a copy. Unfortunately there was one big problem. No where in the description nor on the picture did it mention the zone it could be played in. I was excited to get it in the mail and was heavily disappointed that my DVD player rejected it. I'm all new to the Amazon thing, but this was a black eye for it. Anyways, if you are wondering if this DVD is right for you then take a look at where you live. If you reside in the United States, this movie WILL NOT play for you. Aside from that, this movie is a great comedy and I will keep on looking for it. Those are my two cents.",1352073600,3,653,3.8805970149253732

1367488,4,B00004XMSJ,"Reminiscent of The Matchmaker and Waking Ned Devine, this spirited Irish laugher directed by first-timer Aileen Ritchie takes moviegoers once again to rural Ireland for another round of the battle of the sexes. Placing a personal ad in the Miami Herald, our Irish homeboy heroes hatch a plan to lure American babes to scenic Donegal from scenic Florida, for mutual amorous benefit. The local Irish lasses don't take kindly to this possible turf infringement, and while the guys primp and try to figure out ways to make themselves more marketable, the lasses wrap themselves around some Spanish fishermen whose timely arrival offshore makes for some comedic interlude and jealousy.

Ian Hart ""Backbeat"" plays a butcher-turned-Brad Pitt, who after determining that blondes really do have more fun, waits patiently in pub and at bus stop for the avalanche of lovelies to materialize. What he and the other would-be hunks fail to see is, of course, what is staring them in the face.  For the closer you get, the more difficult it is to see what was there all the time. (I think we have a movie title somewhere in that line.)

The end is quite predictable. Bus after bus arrives in the sleepy seaside Irish burgh, departs, and fails to deposit the anticipated American beauties. Instead relationships slowly smoldering throughout the length of the movie suddenly burst into flame. Even a man whose only previous experience with the opposite sex came from porn magazines connects with a fortunate colleen.

Rated PG-13.
Starring Ian Hart, Ewan Stewart, Sean McGinley, Ruth McCabe, Sean McDonagh, Cathleen Bradley and Pat Shortt.",1239580800,,1622,5.086466165413534
