1992848,5,B0001DMW9S,"OUT OF THE ASHES was released last year as a film for television and fortunately it is now available on DVD for extended audience exposure. Directed by Joseph Sargent and based on the autobiography of Dr. Gisella Perl, this film is about the survival of a physician (Dr. Perl) so compassionate in her dedication to her fellow inmates at Auschwitz that, knowing pregnant Jews were among the first to be cremated in the Nazi ovens, knowingly performed numerous abortions and in doing so saved the lives of countless women. As if her rigors of survival in the concentration camps and her loss of her family to the Nazis weren't enough, she immigrated to the United States for refuge, served in menial medical tasks until she was able to take and pass her exams for medical licensure only to face a panel of folk who declare her a criminal for her role in the concentration camps and make every attempt to prevent her from practicing medicine in the USA. How she survives all of this constitutes the message of this powerful film, but to divulge the ending would diminish the impact for the new viewer. As Dr. Perl, Christine Lahti (one of our most underused and finest actresses) gives a wholly credible, sensitive portrayal: her character remains etched on our minds long after the film is finished. Also in this excellent cast are Richard Crenna, Bruce Davidson, and Beau Bridges among many others in small but pungent roles. Highly recommended.",1083196800,17,1444,4.803212851405623
1992849,5,B0001DMW9S,"This made-for-tv movie by Showtime is based on the autobiography of Dr. Gisella Perl, a Holocaust Survivor who lost her husband, her son, and along with her entire family when they were deported to Auschwitz from Hungary in 1944. Ms. Lahti give a powerful pand moving erformance portraying Dr. Perl who risked her life to secretly perform abortions on expectant mothers to save them from being sent to the gas chambers at Auschwitz only to have her actions questioned later on when she is attempting to gain citizenship and be able to practice medicine in America. Ms. Lahti turns in an outstanding performance and this is one movie not to be missed.",1077408000,8,650,4.8125
1992850,5,B0001DMW9S,"This is a gritty, realistic and, from an historical perspective, reasonably accurate presentation, in the overall sense. Without question:
  1) there was a female, Jewish, Romanian (not Hungarian, as portrayed, in this video) physician (MD), by the name of Gisella Perl, who was gynaecologist, as well as an inmate and survivor of Auschwitz; she was, also, an extensive abortionist, while there;
  2) Josef Mengele was a physician (MD), anthropologist (PhD) and German Army SS officer, at Birkenau and Gross-Rosen (neither camp was mentioned, in this video), as well as in Auschwitz, where he earned the sobriquets of butcher of Auschwitz and angel of death, having performed, ordered and/or overseen uncountable numbers of experiments, on living inmates, without anesthetics;
  3) the Holocaust did occur.

 There is overwhelming documentation of Mengeles atrocities. The Nazi staff kept exacting and highly detailed records of all of Mengeles and other concentration camp experiments.

 As to the specific details, regarding Dr. Perls actions and activities, as presented in this video, it would appear that many may have been dramatized, to fit the overall tone of the movie. Now, thats not suggesting that what is presented, about her, did not occur, in the general sense.

 Im merely suggesting that the sequence and many specifics are not confirmable, with any records, to support her, other than her memories, the memories of a few, other survivors and the documents Dr. Perl created, after she came to the US, seeking US citizenship and to practice medicine. Other details conflict with confirmed fact. For example, the point, at which she tries to poison herself, is depicted, in the video, as soon after arriving in Auschwitz and immediately after she realizes that Mengele is the animal she just unwittingly helped to gas a group of pregnant women. In reality, she did not attempt that suicide, until 1947, after she was released from Bergen-Belsen (she was transferred, there, after Auschwitz and before the Russian liberation of Auschwitz, another time-adjusted detail, in this video), when she became aware that her husband and son had died, in concentration camps. In this video, she is depicted as working in the wrong NYC hospital. She actually worked in Mount Sinai Hospital, after coming to the US, where she specialized in research on infertility treatments.",1491436800,5,2378,5.278514588859417

1992862,5,B0001DMW9S,"Upon meeting Dr Gisela Perl, I was struck by her smile.  It seemed tinged with sadness, reminiscent of that of the actress Maria Schell and what I called her laughing/crying eyes. I felt something really painful had occurred in her life, but I didn't know what until years later when a syndicated article appeared in the local paper, describing a prisoner/doctor who had survived Auschwitz.  It was she. Then I saw this movie on tv,  telling her brutal painful story.  Dr Perl saw me through some serious surgery, rejoiced in the birth of my daughter, and wrote me a letter years later, in which she said that she was closing her New York practice in order to spend the rest of her life delivering babies in Israel. I am so fortunate to have known her. The film is excellent, deeply moving, compelling. Christine Lahti is brilliant in the role.",1468886400,,844,4.644295302013423

Under my sheer impression, Dr. Perl was a gifted doctor who survived well in a concentration camp hospital with invalid prisoners with minimum medication.  She was called by a notorious SS doctor named Dr. Josef Mengele to deliver twin babies from a gypsy mother. This part disgusted me mostly as the mother was shot to death by Dr. Mengele after the delivery. This movie angered my emotions because the SS mistreated the Jews horribly.",1467936000,5,590,4.9393939393939394

Very good acting throughout the movie.  Christine Lahti was sensational. With the emotion she displayed throughout the movie, it was as if she was  Dr. Gisella Perl in real life. One has to believe that what was depicted in the movie is almost exactly what happened. But it is almost impossible to believe that  human beings could actually do what the Nazi leaders and concentration camp guards could do what they did to the victims. The cruelty and complete  apathy without any  compassion shown by the Nazis towards their victims is unfathomable.  One can watch this movie and easily believe it could have been he or she and his or her family as a victim,  if he or she had been from that era. Just imagine the victims' state of consciousness while they were alive in the concentration camps. What they experienced had to have truly  been hell on earth.

1992894,5,B0001DMW9S,"Simply an excellent movie! I've watched it several times. The movie is based on Dr. Gisella Perl's book, I Was A Doctor In Auschwitz. She was a Hungarian Jew who was sent to Auschwitz along wit her husband, father, mother, brother, and son. She was the only one who survived. I liked the cinematography, and the movie relied on flashbacks of Dr. Perl's life in Hungary and Auschwitz. In order to receive citizenship, she had to give testimony before the INS Review Board about her experience as a doctor and tried very hard to describe the indescribable. Questions about her collaborating with Nazi doctors had surfaced. That is, she had to provide testimony to what ""medical care she could give to fellow prisoners. Her most controversial actions included providing late-term abortions to pregnant women in order to save their lives. These pregnant women would otherwise have been killed immediately or subjected to the torture of horrific 'medical' experiments. She is accused of Auschwitz concentration camp 'colluding' with the Nazi doctor Josef Mengele who directed the experiments on the pregnant inmates."" The cinematography made you feel you part of her experience or portrayed the times to give the viewer a sense of the way things were for God's ancient people, the Jews. It was somewhat sad that Dr. Perl (Christine Lahti) later learned that America knew that Jews were being exterminated but did nothing about it. In fact, a number of nations as well as local citizens knew Jews were being exterminated by the Germans. But what the men standing I judgment of Dr. Perl's ability to gain citizenship in America were quite ignorant and obtuse about her experience in the death camp that the prisoners were subject to death every minute of their life in the Auschwitz.",1406764800,3,1776,4.983164983164984

Christine Lahti plays a Hungarian-Jewish gynecologist who worked at Auschwitz treating patients and performing late-term abortions on pregnant women who would've been killed, had their pregnancies been found out. She saved countless lives that way, as bitter-sweet as it is. But, it all comes full circle for a very happy ending.
Just make sure you're prepared for a feels-trip!",1401926400,,478,5.141025641025641
1992898,4,B0001DMW9S,"A very well plotted and convincingly acted movie that pits a heroic holocaust surviving doctor (Christine Lahti) against U.S. immigration and government officials asking some very personal questions about the doctor's activities at camp Auschwitz infirmary.  Because of the close proximity in past and current events, the flashbacks can be a bit confusing at first.  But eventually it becomes much clearer which time period is being shown as the doctor painfully relates her survival story to the officials. The story is based on the real life autobiography of Dr. Gisella Perl, a Hungarian gynecologist prior to the war.

Out of the Ashes is as much about America's ignorance of Nazi atrocities during WWII as it is about one doctor's struggle and sacrifice to not only survive, but to help others survive an inhuman holocaust.  Nazi doctor Josef Mengele is portrayed very convincingly.  Doctor Mengele was like a government sanctioned doctor Frankenstein with more specimens than he knew what to do with.  There are some very eerie moments in this film, moments that give the feeling of waking out of a nightmare but still hearing the whistling, shouting or unforgettable gunshots echoing from the assassins' German luger.

My most memorable scenes and moments, without spoiling it for those who haven't seen the movie yet, were two simple scenes, both showing a crying newborn.  It reminds me of how precious and powerful that savage scream of birth is.",1400976000,,1456,5.139830508474576

1992916,5,B0001DMW9S,"By Darrell Stoddard, darrellstoddard@gmail.com

""Out of the Ashes"" deserves 5 stars and more.

This is compelling, emotionally gripping motion picture about a true event in history wherein abortion saved the life of many Jewish women.

A large number of people who oppose abortion, accept abortion if it is to save the mothers life. A trusted gynecologist told me it is very very rare for an abortion to ever be better for a women's health than carrying the baby full term through to a normal birth.

There is one notable exception: Abortion most definitely saved the life of many pregnant Jewish women in the concentration camps of Nazi Germany. If it was discovered that a women was pregnant, they were sent immediately to the gas chambers because a women with a baby had no value to do the work the Nazis required them to do.

Whether you are pro life or pro abortion, this true, never to be forgotten, must see, heart rending motion picture is about the OB/gynecologist Dr. Gisella Perl (Christine Lahti) that performed abortions with her bare hands to save the life of Jewish women in the concentration camps. It will challenge everything you believe. You may never be the same after seeing it, but you will be a more loving and forgiving person.

I spent a good part of my life in motion pictures so when I say, ""The acting in ""Out of the Ashes"" is as good or better than you will see in any other motion picture,"" it is no idle comment.

See all of my Reviews. I write only about books, events, or motion pictures that have changed the course of history or unforgettable books or motion pictures that will totally change peoples lives.

Sorry, but I enjoyed (??) this film very much for the seemingly ""real"" depictions of what can only be imagined by anyone not interned in one of these hell-holes, i.e., concentration 'camps.'  I will not presume to judge Dr. Perl's actions other than to say that she will face a Judge one day that is beyond wiser than I am; however, simply in a logical manner, to me it was ""kill the fetus (baby) or let the Nazi's kill them both.""  The behavior, i.e., demeanor and tone of the interrogation by INS seemed so out of touch with what the concentration camp victims endured as to be nearly nonsensical at times but I did not live through those times, so.....

1992921,5,B0001DMW9S,"""Out of the Ashes"" is a memorable motion picture. The acting, especially by Christine Lahti, is extremely convincing; the choreography and the cinematography are excellent. The musical score enhances the film and the plot moves along at a good pace.

Dr. Gisella Perl (Christine Lahti) arrives in the United States after World War Two; she has seen nothing but horrific events during her imprisonment at Auschwitz, the Nazi death camp that very few people ever survived. She is met by good friend Didi Goldstein (Zoie Palmer); Gisella can't wait to begin practicing medicine again as she did when she lived in her native Hungary.

Gisella is initially relegated to doing lab work in a New York hospital until after she passes the American medical boards; and the INS hesitates to grant citizenship to Gisela because they suspect that she assisted Nazi doctors including the infamously evil Dr. Mengele at Auschwitz. Gisella is shocked; she is a Jew and she shows them the numbers Nazis tattooed on her arm to mark her as a prisoner. The INS people remain skeptical and it is through many flashbacks that we learn everything that Gisella Perl did during her imprisonment at Auschwitz.

Her story is incredibly painful and distressing indeed. We see how Nazis invaded the Perl residence in Hungary and sent the family to imprisonment or death in gas chambers. Despite hearing all this, the INS still can't stomach that Gisella performed abortions at Auschwitz; but she tells them that it saved the lives of pregnant Jewish women so that they might survive the war and have Jewish babies after the war is over. Some of Gisella's other actions were not always the most honorable; but she did what she had to do to survive.

Actually, there's more to the plot that I left out so as not to spoil it all for you; and I won't write much more so that you can experience this movie the same way that I did! You will be glued to your seat as you watch this dark drama based on true-life events; the acting and the storyline work so very well to create an unforgettable experience. Look for Jonathan Cake to portray the evil Dr. Mengele; Ingrid Veninger as Zozia; and Emma Wellbelove plays a very young Gisella very well. Beau Bridges, Richard Crenna and Bruce Davison portray the INS agents with panache.

The DVD comes with bonus features including interviews with cast members; and there is ""The Choices of Dr. Gisella Perl."" There is a map of Holocaust concentration and death camps and even more.

""Out of the Ashes"" tells the story of just how far people like Dr. Gisella Perl were pushed to survive World War Two; this story deserves to be told and never forgotten. I highly recommend this for anyone studying the Holocaust; and people who appreciate emotional dramas based on real life events will not be disappointed.

Let All The World Never Forget

In Germany one dark day
Evil became, because of one man
All the people had to salute
With hand held high
Every person who was in Hitler's life
Wore his Nazi slogan with pride

While, all the weak, sick and disabled
Mostly Jews, who were also German born
Were sent to concentration camps, because
This man Hitler sought a perfect race
And so began the Holocaust

Jews died by the hundreds each day
For Hitler wanted only blonde hair and blue eyes
He wanted only strong men and women
So many people had to hide
In fear of their lives
As the Secret Service hunted to find

The French underground
Helped some from being captured by the state
Other countries close to Germany
Assisted terrified people to escape

I remember those brave people who saved lives
But millions more still died
The Nazi put numbers on their arms
And set them to hard labour, with little food and drink
Where they became sick or weak
Then they were told to go the showers
They did not know, this was the Nazi gas chambers
Where they would die
After death they were put in the ovens
To hide from the world this genocide

Let us remember the heroes of German occupation
And though we may thank God it is over
We must never let this happen again
There must be peace on earth
Please let the war we are in
Never become another forgotten war
And let no fanatical man
Ever take our souls away
In America, The USA.

1992948,5,B0001DMW9S,"This film, based on the memoirs of Dr. Gisella Perl, is an incredibly powerful, moving, soul-searing, and unforgettable experience.  Some people feel that there are too many books and movies about the Shoah, or that after awhile they all start to seem the same because the tale of horror is all-too familiar, but this film is moving proof that that's not the case at all.  Every person's story was different and unique in some way.  How often have we got something from the perspective of a survivor who was a doctor, and a female doctor no less, at a time when men largely dominated the medical field?  Additionally, this story is told in the present day, with flashbacks inserted every so often, instead of told in a linear format or just starting in the present and then having the bulk of the movie be one long flashback before reverting back to the present.

Dr. Perl became the first female doctor, and the first female Jewish doctor at that, in her native village of Sighet in Hungary.  Even though her father initially disapproved, ever since she announced her plans as a young girl, she proved to him that she could be an observant Jew, a good doctor, a wife, and a mother.  Becoming a doctor didn't cancel out her faith or a more traditional female role, as her family had feared.  She was well-liked and trusted by her patients, and was doing very well for herself and for her family.  In addition to being an inspiration for having survived what she did, she was also living proof that women can have both a career and a family, instead of just one or the other.

In the present day (a few years after the war), Dr. Perl is being examined for American citizenship.  Though she passed all of her medical boards to be allowed to practise medicine in the United States, the question remains of her character and if she collaborated with the Nazis.  There's an ocean of misunderstanding between her and her three interrogators, men who were living comfortable lives while she and her family were being treated like sub-humans, while she lost her entire family and had to do the unthinkable to try to save her own life.  People who were in the camps often had to do things that many in the outside world would consider immoral, uncivilised, or unthinkable, but one must understand that this was another planet, with its own set of rules and morals.  No one should judge anyone else for having done something to preserve one's own life.  It's not as though these things were done willingly or voluntarily.  ""Dr."" Mengele seemed to have a great deal of liking and respect for Dr. Perl, and made her work in the excuse of an infirmary at Auschwitz, even once assisting with a Gypsy patient who was pregnant with her second set of twins, a woman who was later murdered after giving birth and taken to be dissected.  She was also once called upon to give the infamous sadistic Irma Grese an abortion.  However, Dr. Perl did far, far more good than harm, often risking her life to save her patients, doing things that she would have been shot for had she been discovered doing, such as hiding a sick woman during selections in the infirmary and using her and the other doctors' blood as the pretended blood sample of a woman who had typhus.  And since her specialty was in gynecology and obstetrics, she gave about a thousand women abortions, performed without any tools no less.  She knew that this would save these women's lives, and that if they survived, they could go on to bear another child someday, a child who would be born in freedom.  Her goal, her driving force for surviving, was to continue helping to bring life into the world, keeping these Jewish women alive so they would keep their people alive and produce children who would continue to propagate their people, replenishing their ranks after how many people the Nazis slaughtered, a million and a half of whom were just children.  It is this message that she is trying to get across to the men deciding her fate as an American citizen and as a doctor.

I'd highly recommend this film, both for its moving and gut-wrenching story and for its unique perspective and structure, quite different from what one usually expects from a film about the Shoah.  Christine Lahti as Dr. Perl gives an absolutely brilliant performance, and everything is brought to life so vividly that one can almost feel as though one is right there in that moment, place, and time.  I was even moved to tears a few times, something that rarely happens when I watch a film.  It's the kind of thing that stays with one for a long time afterward.",1161475200,92,4586,4.603194103194103

1992951,5,B0001DMW9S,"Intelligent, thought-provoking, and moving story of Gisella Perl, doctor, Holocaust survivor and author of the book ""I Was a Doctor in Auschwitz.""

 This made-for-television (Showtime) movie picks up Perl's story after the war.  She has emigrated to New York - her family, Hungarian Jews, were murdered at Auschwitz - and desperately wants, needs, to begin practicing medicine again.  The movie presents her as a gynecologist, a good one, as well as a strong and at times even vain woman.  Life is never simple, though.  First she must pass the medical boards, and then the immigration must give their approval for her to practice in this country.  And the panel of immigration officials have some tough questions to ask before that appoval is granted.

 Christine Lahti brings a full palette to her complex character and is pretty much the whole show.  The panel members (Beau Bridges, Bruce Davison and Richard Crenna in his last credited role) need to know if Perl collaborated with the German medical staff at Auschwitz, a staff headed by that arch-fiend, Joseph Mengele (Jonathan Cake.)  And, pre-Roe v. Wade, they're curious about the roughly one thousand abortions she reportedly performed while at Auschwitz.  It's the late forties, after all, and abortions were still illegal and almost universally reviled. These questions usher in flashbacks and, if not excuses, at least explanations for her actions.  Women came to Auschwitz pregnant, or were raped by the guards.  Pregnant women and women with infants were killed, and Perl made one of the many `choiceless choices' Lahti mentions in a short video interview on the dvd.

  I'm beginning to come to the conclusion that all the good stuff nowadays is produced by television.  OUT OF THE ASHES is a Showtime production from 2003.  It's not really another Holocaust movie, either.  Rather it's about the cost of survival and the `choiceless choices' one has to make along the way.",1143849600,7,1940,5.079113924050633
1992952,5,B0001DMW9S,"I still remember the resolution of ""The Man in the Glass Booth"" as being the moment when the idea that those who survived the Nazi concentration camps could be assailed by massive guilt for coming out alive.  Robert Shaw's play raised more issues than that, and there are certain dramatic twists and turns in that particular story, but the importance of guilt and what it can do to you came through.  However, ""The Man in the Glass Booth"" is a work of fiction, and this 2003 Showtime original film is based on a true story.

Out of the Ashes"" addresses more directly the idea that surviving Auschwitz could involve guilt in the particular case of Gisella Perl (Christine Lahti), a Jewish-Hungarian doctor who did just that.  She makes her way to America and wants to practice medicine again, but there are questions about what she did in the camps and to what degree she colluded with the Nazis.  Not just the Nazis, but with Dr. Joseph Mengele (Jonathan Cake).  When he discovered Perl was a doctor, he asked her to help him identify the pregnant women in the camp so that they could be taken to a special infirmary.  Of course, this is a lie, which Perl learns almost immediately.

Perl has to appear before three I.N.S. investigators.  Herman Prentiss (Beau Bridges) is the most accusatory, Jake Smith (Richard Crenna) seems sympathetic, and Peter Schuman (Bruce Davison) seems troubled, so the trio provide a variety of responses to the story Perl has to tell.  In telling her story, Perl goes back to not only her time in Auschwitz, but before the Nazis came to Hungary.  As that story unfolds it becomes clear that what she did is not as important to her inquisitors, herself, or her audience, as why.  I assume that anyone who watches ""Out of the Ashes"" will be familiar with the horrors of the Holocaust, but each story told in such settings always finds a way to evoke the horror anew and this one is no different.

My only real problem with ""Out of the Ashes"" is not its historical resolution but rather its dramatic.  There is a point where Perl comes to terms with her own actions, which is what allows her to go on and live her life.  We understand how it provides her with a sense of peace, but how it translates into what the decision reached by the tribunal is left unstated.  The fact that Mr. Prentiss delivers their verdict was not lost on me, but I found it hard to believe the words he speaks were written by him and I see him as the odd-man out on a split decision.  So that leaves a gap in the dramatic structure of the story, which matters because in adapting Perl's book ""I Was a Doctor in Auschwitz,"" Anne Meredith (""Bastard Out of Carolina"") has chosen for Perl's story to be revealed in the course of that inquiry. Meredith won the Writers Guild of America award for Adapted Long Form teleplay, so it is not that this is a flawed script, but that I really wanted a better sense of the judgment being offered and I found what was provided inadequate to that task.

Showtime's promotions for this movie keep asking the question, ""What would you do?""  But that is really a false issue, as is the specific way that Perl tried to help women in Auschwitz, which resonates in a polarized America in a completely different way.  In interview clips Lahti talks about what Perl did as ""choiceless choices,"" and I certainly endorse the idea that judging someone when you are incapable of standing in their shoes is a senseless intellectual game.  You can say what you would do if you were in the position of Gisella Perl or the title character in ""Sophie's Choice,"" but you are separated from such decisions by some quantum differences in time and place such musing are at least absurd if not insulting.

Final Note: Among the brief special features on this DVD is a map marking the location of the Nazi death camps in Eastern Europe.  The map makes a distinction between concentration camps, such as Buchenwald and Dachau, and the extermination camps such as Auschwitz-Birkenau.  It is not a distinction in nomenclature that I have followed previously, and it is hampered by an inadequate understanding of which camps fall into which categories, but it strikes me as making a valid point.",1124582400,9,4206,4.607238605898123
1992953,4,B0001DMW9S,"This movie is definately among my most favorite holocaust based films, and I've seen quite a few.  The movie continuously transitions between Dr. Perls childhood, her role in the holocaust, and the aftermath when she is a refugee.  Dr. Perl has passed the medical tests with flying colors and has proved her leadership and talent as a doctor.  However her license is being withheld because her morals are unknown. She worked side by side with nazi's and unknowingly sent women to their death.  Dr. Perl secretly performed hundreds of abortions with her barehands.  Jewish expectant mothers were the very first to be exterminated.  By taking life away from unborn babies, there was hope for life for the mother as well as future babies.  However, the hospital frowns that she took part in such evil, even though it was against her will.",1114473600,9,835,4.879432624113475
1992954,5,B0001DMW9S,"This film is heart-wrenching. Powerful perfomances bring the horrors of Dr. Mengele's medical experimentation at Auschwitz to light.

1992955,5,B0001DMW9S,"When we bought this, I thought, ""not another holocaust film!""  So there it sat for months, unopened.  Then last night, I finally got the courage to try watching it, and became utterly rivetted and deeply moved.

This is the true story of a remarkable survivor, a doctor from Auschwitz, who suffered the loss of her entire family and took many questionable actions to survive.  While saving many lives, she also dealt with Mengele and felt that she had violated her oath as a doctor.  She is not a simple good guy, but a full-blown character who acknowledges the necessity of her actions and yet feels terrible guilt.  Lahti delivers the best performance I have ever seen her give, not as the beautiful young woman she is but prematurely aged and worn.  She is totally believable and charismatic.

Though made for TV, this is a great film.  Warmly recommended.  You will be moved yet again by the one of greatest trajedies of the 20C.",1110585600,108,933,4.668711656441718
1992956,5,B0001DMW9S,"This is the story of Dr. Gisella Perl and her struggle to survive Auschwitz and become an American citizen.  Dr. Perl was born to a religious Jewish family in Sighet (the same town as Elie Wiesel) and struggled, against her father's wishes, to become a doctor.  Although a doctor of reknown in her town, she was transported to Auschwitz along with all the other Jews in Sighet.  There, she tried to save as many lives as she could.  Dr. Perl also prevented women from being killed and experminted upon (and their children experimented upon) by Dr. Mengele.  This sometimes required aborting the babies before Dr. Mengele could become aware that the women were pregnant.  Although no movie can fully depict the horror of Auschwitz, this one pulls no puches.

Dr. Perl manages to survive Auschwitz, but after arriving in America, must take menial jobs in hospitals.  Her story is told through an inquisition by INS officials, who question what she did in Auschwitz.  The suffering Dr. Perl endured, the things she saw, and the choices she had to make are extremely painful.  It is impossible to judge her actions without walking in her footsteps.  Who knows how any of us would act under the same circumstances?

This is a remarkable story.  Christine Lahti movingly and realistically portrays Dr. Perl.  I agree with the reviewer who says that we don't see Ms. Lahti in enough films -- she is an incredible actress.  This film is well beyond most made-for-TV movies.  It is a must see.",1108252800,7,1484,4.783464566929134
1992957,5,B0001DMW9S,"This biographical film relates the story of Auschwitz survivor, Dr. Gisella Perl, providing an important chapter into the lives of those poor souls tortured into unthinkable acts in order to survive during the Holocaust of WWII.

Dr. Gisella Perl (Christine Lahti) arrives in New York with tear filled eyes begging for a new life after WWII. Perl wanted to be a doctor from childhood; she studied hard and managed to open a very successful private practice in Hungary. Her only downfall ended up being her bloodlines and this very strong woman soon found herself carted off to Auschwitz. In a series of flashbacks Perl is examined by a committee of American INS men who are judging her character as a step towards her citizenship. Perl is seen as a survivor who at times may have saved her own life at the sake of others and she is accused of collaborating with the Nazi doctor like the retched Josef Mengele. In actuality Perl saved many women by sacrificing the unborn lives of their fetuses after being tricked by Mengele into submission and having to see what went on behind the walls of Auschwitz. Despite the horrors she witnessed Perl survived to flourish once again and her true story is one of an undying spirit.

Christina Lahti is phenomenal in her role as Gisella Perl. She manages to capture both the brokenness and the strength of this woman with equal determination. Many scenes in this film are absolutely gut-wrenching but entirely important. As stated in the film Auschwitz became its own country and the ""rules of humanity"" no longer applied. Under these circumstances many atrocities were committed by Nazi's and the Jewish prisoners alike...who is to say what depths a human being can reach under the horror of the Holocaust? In order to thrive in the conditions faced by the prisoners they were forced to either submit and then be burned alive or to calculate another way of living. Gisella Perl did just that. Despite how you feel about abortions this woman had to perform the procedures bare handed and under intolerable conditions in order to save the lives of women prisoners. She was forced under threat to assist in ""experiments"" beside Mengele and even went as far as saving a female Nazi guard from her own ""predicament"" without question. Placed in the same circumstances few of us would have ever survived so leave your moral judgments behind on this one. Instead allow this one woman's story to matter so that the ashes of Auschwitz and all of the other concentration camps never establish a foothold in our world again.",1107993600,247,2552,4.824200913242009

Once there, the doctor had to witness innumerable atrocities that would haunt her forever.  Only her will to survive, and her desire to help other women kept her alive.  And yet, even though she had courageously made it through the nightmare and ultimately found her freedom in America, she had to go through yet another ordeal when a government panel all but accused her of wrongdoing at Auschwitz and tried to ban her from practicing medicine in the United States.

The storyline seems to really focus on the main character being a woman and a doctor - a bit feministic for me.  I think it would have been a bit better if they had not done so much jumping back and forth in the present and her memories.  I don't think the movie's intent was to tell the story of a survivor, but to tell the story of a woman with a backbone of steel while all those around here seemed to be a bit on the fluffy side.",1522022400,,528,3.8518518518518516

Lahi gives a great performance as the aristocratic lady professional brought low - physically and morally - by the underworld of Nazidom.  In facing the forbidding panel of aging American actors who will judge her fitness for US citizenship, she educates them on horrors and degradations they can't begin to comprehend.  Yet this experience has only hardened her moral shell, first punctured when one of the panel shares his own loss, via a son left in Normandy.  They in turn cause her to self-breach her own defenses, to face the choices she made to survive in Auschwitz: but survival as what?  The catharsis was, in truth, worse than experiencing Mengele's lab.  Unlike most film happy endings, this one came at extreme price for its protagonist: Dr. Perl the OB-GYN emerged the victor and better person but only through her own rebirth in a new world.",1517529600,,983,4.821428571428571
