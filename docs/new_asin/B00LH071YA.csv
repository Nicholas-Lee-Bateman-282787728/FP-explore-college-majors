6486460,5,B00LH071YA,"I'll have to take exception to the two less than stellar reviews of this wonderful classical music disc.  Not to brag but I have a very formidable sound system attached to my old Mitsubisi  480 progressive big screen still running strong after many years.  The color and detail of this disc are excellent.  The sound is fantastic even though it was only transferred using  PCM stereo. I own the regular DVD not the Blue Ray. As far as the music is concerned, you really get your money's worth here (150 minutes) with all the great selections/renditions of Rachmaninoff, the last romantic.  The Schehrazade is magnificent.  While I am not a person who has the knowledge to critique the actual conductor and individual players, I am truly a person who loves classical music.  If you're like myself and love Rachmaninoff and Rimsky-Korsakov, do not hesitate to add this wonderful disc to your classical music library.  I have no regrets and am very happy to have purchased it.  Buy it and enjoy!",1409702400,4,992,4.7823529411764705
6486461,2,B00LH071YA,"Very disappointed in fact. This is a Blu-Ray disc, but the sound is in PCM stereo only. Hey, this is 2014...  I feel cheated, in particular because it should have been pointed somewhere that this recording  is ""Stereo Only"" before I bought it.
The performance is OK, but not the quality of sound I was expecting and I was willing to pay for.",1409011200,5,341,4.396825396825397
8665792,5,B00LH071YA,"This is an amazing performance. Denis Matsuev is an expressive and powerful pianist. I gave this as a gift to my father who is ""picky"" in the performances he will listen to.  He watched this performance 3 times in one day.  The quality of the recording is excellent.",1507420800,,266,4.520833333333333

8665795,1,B00LH071YA,"Very disappointing. Sound is O.K. but not surround---that's bad enough. Playing the opening of the Rachmaninoff
Symphonic Dances sums it all up in a nutshell: dead acoustics in the hall, strings sound like a High School
orchestra, and the bass is charitable described as woeful.  A check with the Oue Minnesota version on Reference
Recordings sounds great---a fair comparison through the same equipment.  It discouraging to see the bass plucked
in the video, but not hear anything in the audio. Who decides to issue this stuff?

The video is crystal clear, if unimaginative. And the works presented are certainly hard core romantic.  The
Rimsky-Korsakov fares a little better, but still those bad acoustics. Try the Jansons recordings of almost anything
if you want to know how to get great value for your money (except the Mahler 2nd, there are many defective
copies out there, including mine, and the ""replacement"" had the same problem: the last movement stops
abruptly about a minute before the end..)",1441497600,,1004,5.103658536585366
8665796,5,B00LH071YA,"I felt the recording range is a little bit narrow.
But  I enjoyed it very much. It is recomendable for any persons who wants to enjoy classical music.",1440892800,,150,4.357142857142857
8665797,5,B00LH071YA,"This DVD has two of my favorite Russian symphonic pieces.  I have CDs of them over 60 years old and just started getting video DVDs.  Even though my hearing competes with ringing ears, made worse from even moderately loud sounds, and high frequencies are about gone, I turn up the audio on these and pay the consequences.  I think this DVD is great, sound and video.  I don't know much about debates on this or that sound processing because I probably couldn't hear the differences, in spite of once being a TV station audio and transmitter engineer.",1433980800,3,550,4.639175257731959

8665800,3,B00LH071YA,"I had high hopes for this Blu-ray disc, of which I received a review copy. It's generously packed with about two-and-a-half hours of musical works that are among my favorites. Some believe Rachmaninov's Piano Concerto No. 2 and Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade are merely guilty pleasures due to their surface appeal and enduring popularity. I'm not in that camp. Each of these pieces is perfectly realized in its own way and a masterpiece for the composer. When played well and with emotional honesty, they are very moving.

Other reviewers here appear quite happy with the performances, so they're focusing their attention mainly on the sound quality issue. Although these performances were recorded only last year, the sound is in lossless PCM stereo rather than the now-standard 5.1 that makes full use of home theater surround-sound setups. I agree the lack of a 5.1 option is unfortunate, but the audio quality remains very good. My main issue is with the performances.

Rachmaninov's Piano Concerto No. 2 is played here by ""Siberian Bear"" Denis Matsuev, a well-established piano virtuoso whom I had not heard until this disc. Perhaps I'm not qualified to judge since I'm not a musician, but it seems to me that he can be quite imprecise in his fingering. Just when I'd start to enjoy a lyrical passage, a seemingly wrong note or blurred run would jar my ears. It's a frustrating and only occasionally satisfying performance.

After Matsuev's encores (an etude and a prelude), Temirkanov and the St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra perform the Symphonic Dances, a Rachmaninov work that hasn't had its full due in concert halls or recording studios. It is by far the best performance on the disc -- taut, exciting and full of yearning -- and perhaps even one the finest available of the piece.

And then, Scheherazade. In this, Temirkanov looks like he's enjoying a brisk stroll in the park with genial company. He smiles and winks at the players, and if I didn't know better I would swear he sneaks a peek at the clock a couple of times. In the last movement, his hurried approach doesn't allow the music to build to the rapturous heights it should. It's a perfectly adequate but uninspired performance.

For comparison's sake, I viewed two other versions available on disc:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lucerne-Festival-Beethoven-Rimsky-Korsakov-Blu-ray/dp/B007N0SW1O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lucerne Festival: Beethoven, Rimsky-Korsakov [Blu-ray</a>] and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sergiu-Celibidache-in-Rehearsal-Performance-DVD-Video/dp/B000NOIWNK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sergiu Celibidache in Rehearsal & Performance [DVD Video</a>]. The difference in approach between the conductors is striking, and the performances reflect this.

Nelsons (notably only 32 at the time) acts like a child excitedly opening his presents at Christmas. It's a lovely performance, but ultimately one that is skin deep, with a focus on the aural textures of individual sections. The Royal Concertgebouw is superior to the other two orchestras, and the picture and sound quality (DTS HD 5.1) could not be better.

Celibidache, unlike Temirkanov and Nelsons, takes Scheherazade very seriously. He's intensely in the moment and maintains a thread of suspense throughout, making it a cohesive, exciting whole with a spectacular finish. At times, it almost seems Wagnerian. It's by far the best performance of the work on video, despite a lesser orchestra (Stuttgart Radio Symphony) and the 1982 picture and audio limitations.

Curiously, Temirkanov follows Scheherazade with Elgar's Salut D'Amour in a gentle, sensitive performance.

The jam-packed disc ends with a bonus: After the titles comes the overture from Verdi's La Forza del Destino. This concert chestnut is well played but not terribly exciting.",1410912000,7,3892,5.719723183391004
8665801,5,B00LH071YA,"In a word, this disk is wonderful !

Temirkanov has expressed his great power that makes joyful atmosphere. His tact is wonderful and intetlectual. He is getting more skilfulness and charming.",1410220800,,192,5.193548387096774
