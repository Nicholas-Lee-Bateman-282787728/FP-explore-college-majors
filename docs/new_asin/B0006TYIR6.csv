2195475,5,B0006TYIR6,"A friend of mine passed me a copy of this movie (I think it is an advance copy because the DVD is white labeled) and I've got to say I was sceptical. We're film students and he said that the people who made it calling it the first sampling movie. They have taken clips from old movies and made a story out of them with new music and sound and stuff. I was afraid that this going to be totally disrespectful to some of the classic movies we'd studied but it turned out to be really funny and different than anything I've seen before. There's so many jokes going by (some a little lame) that you can't help but get caught up in it. We watched it a second time, together, and realized we'd missed some stuff... so we're going to watch it again. I don't know how but even it seems as though they like the movies they've cut up even though they use them totally differently. We've started trying to figure out where all of the scenes came from. This movie is good for a group of people to watch together.",1103068800,3,999,4.181347150259067
8043178,3,B0006TYIR6,... I could imagine. It seemed that the film makers decided to try and make people as mad and confused as possible... and they succeeded with me. I started out laughing but that soon turned to anger as the movie progressed. If this was their goal then they reached it. I have no clue what the other reviewers are prattling on about... did they see this? I'm giving this movie 3 stars because I liked the Bush bashing and a few other scenes and hated the whole section with the little people at the end. If this was only an hour instead of 80 minutes it would be a classic... (if they let me choose the scenes to cut out).,1120089600,,621,4.183333333333334
8043179,3,B0006TYIR6,"I thought this movie was pretty good and I got some good laughs out of it. As some have noted, the production values are not real high but that did not bother me as it was quite inventive for being such a low budget affair. Some of the criticism seems pretty harsh but I guess they just didn't get into it like I did or something.",1119830400,2,330,4.015151515151516
8043180,1,B0006TYIR6,"I brought this based on the fact that all the reviews listed were raving about it. BIG mistake! I found it difficult to find any humour at all, the movies sampled were poor video quality, and I found the narration difficult to relate to what I was looking at, although if I could be bothered to watch it a second time I may get the gist of it. But I am painting my house and would rather sit and watch that dry.

I find humour in most things, in fact looking at my DVD collection now I see Simpsons, Bad Santa, The Castle, Shaun of the Dead, Reefer Madness, Kenny Everett, Mr Jolly Lives Next Door, Sledge Hammer, Curb Your Enthusiasm, so I have a pretty varied comedy taste. The only laugh I got out of this movie was at myself for having a Homer Simpson impulse buying moment after reading the reviews.",1119830400,2,804,4.254901960784314
8043181,4,B0006TYIR6,"I dig MST 3000, but this movie takes the concept on a different spin.  Took me about 10 minutes to catch on, but as soon as I did, it was a fun flick.  I would have given 5 stars for being completely strange and making me laugh, but knocked one off because I thought the story line became hard to follow towards the end.",1115251200,3,320,3.984375
8043182,1,B0006TYIR6,"Lame. What a horrible waste of time. I kept waiting for it to get interesting. With a film of this type, it could be really funny and clever, but it falls flat. Too much nothing. Too much stupid. Really. I love ""Kids in the Hall"" humor, I totally love South Park, and Monty Python is engrained in the lifestyle where I live. This film, however, is painful. It could have been good, but it totally missed the mark. Ouch.",1113868800,2,419,4.3164556962025316
8043183,5,B0006TYIR6,"I was amazed at how well the format worked and would love to see more films of this kind. As others have noted, it's good movie to watch with friends and recite the hilarious dialog at opportune moments. Loved the monkey references and the hidden creatures included in certain frames.",1105574400,3,284,4.7
8043184,5,B0006TYIR6,"Hilarious! The other guys in my dorm can't stop repeating the dialogue from this movie!  Exceptional concept, I've never seen anything like it! Instead of sampling music, these guys created a new genre of film - movie sampling.  And they pulled it off by potentially offending everyone on the planet.  This movie is fun, warped, absurd...and has one of the best written love stories I've seen....really.  Sounds Hot!",1104969600,5,416,5.073529411764706
8043185,5,B0006TYIR6,Very original!  Very creative!  Very weird humor.  Can't wait for another one!  I liked it even better the second time- after I smoked the w**d!,1104883200,,144,4.64
8043186,4,B0006TYIR6,"There are a lot of funny parts in this movie but in the end it is a little scattered. Sometimes it seems a little mean spirited but after I thought about it, it wasn't that bad. I wasn't real happy that one of the charecters sounded like the president, but it was kind of funny. I laughed out loud a few times and I hope that they makes more of these cause it is a good idea. I gave it four stars because I hope they do.",1104105600,2,420,3.839080459770115
8043187,4,B0006TYIR6,"This film is... different. The directors took a bunch of clips from several well-known silent films (Nosferatu, Dr. Caligari, The Golem, Phantom of the Opera, etc.) and re-edited them into a single  narrative. It has a Monty Python-esque vibe running throughout; the story is at times a little hard to follow, and there are numerous asides that tie into the overall story. There are LOTS of jokes and sight gags, almost too many to take in in a single viewing. This film isn't for kids, as there is a fair amount of questionable content (hooray for questionable content!). I laughed out loud many times, and Nosferatu's remake into a Christopher Walken soundalike is definitely the high point of the film. This film won't be for everyone, but if you're into the ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" school of cinema, you should pick this one up.",1103500800,4,831,4.811188811188811
