7992273,5,B00009PBHX,"Max Steel has always been one of my favorite series.  To find it on DVD was AWESOME!  I only wish the entire series was available on DVD.  Unlike the newer version, this version gives Max more of a private life.  He is a real teenager with problems.  The new version is mainly fighting and tech.  I loved the approach where you got to know your character; not just the superhero part but his personal faults, demons and joys.  I WANT MORE!",1382486400,,439,4.345679012345679
