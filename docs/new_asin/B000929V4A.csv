8056716,2,B000929V4A,The picture looks as if it is being shown under water with waves crashing over it. Picture jerks and moves back and forth to the point it makes me sea sick.,1401926400,,156,4.064516129032258
8056717,5,B000929V4A,"I accidentally ran across this movie on a Spanish TV station here in Chicago many years ago, and was just recently able to find out its name. I ordered the DVD. Unfortunately, it has no English subtitles; however, the basic elements of the plot are fairly obvious, so, although I'm sure you might miss out on some subtleties and laughs in the dialogue (if you don't speak Spanish), you can still get your share of laughs out of the visuals. The dinosaurs are hilarious - they look like hand puppets. I'm not saying that in a mean way; I think they were intentionally done that way to fit into the humor of the story. There are many really funny sight gags and amusing musical numbers.",1391472000,,684,4.48
8056718,5,B000929V4A,"The sleeping beauty but in a reversal role.  Not a woman and not a princess either, the sleeping beauty is a man who wakes up to find his love in another time.  Yes, it is funny and ahead of its time or is it backwards in time with a leap to the future.  It brings memories of my childhood as I watched with my parents, brothers and sisters.  I recommend this movie to everyone who speaks spanish (I don't know yet if the DVD has subtitles or if it's dubbed).  A warning it is a classic and the special effects are not upto date but I'm glad it's part of my video collection.",1362009600,,575,4.053097345132743
