7785788,1,B01HDHAA9S,"Typical ""couple finds newly purchased home has evil history, haunted"", etc. type movie.  Neighbor tells them the house history, and even though he says the community doesn't want bad gossip getting into the public, he still seems to be nudging the husband into insanity.  I personally HATE clowns -- they just disgust me in general, but the makeup on this one is really evil and scary looking.  The main reason I rated the movie so low is the acting.  The female is really ""big-boned"" and always seems to be wearing too tight clothing.  Maybe this is her first main stream film after doing porno(???) because she's a horrible actress.  Their ""couple"" lines seem forced, they don't feel true.

I skipped through some of the talking and romantic scenes, just to finish faster.  I wanted to find out if the clown was really the neighbor, a hallucination or ??  Well, I didn't ever really get an answer. . .",1477180800,3,903,4.6645569620253164

7785791,1,B01HDHAA9S,"This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Please read my explanation before watching.

First off the film itself constantly has static and is interrupted often. The film unexpected stops at randoms points emitting a mostly blank screen and screeching noises.

This movie is done with one camera and no microphones. This means that any time the camera is positioned far from the the three ""actors"" that have lines they will be quiet, and when the camera is close it is much too loud.

The house they are filming in has a constant echo. This is present the entire film.

The actors not only come off as untrained but completely incompetent. It is often hard to watch for this and many other reasons. The story is absolutely unbelievable, and there are many scenes of the couple in bed for absolutely no reason. To be completely honest this is about the same quality as really low budget adult films.

If you were looking for an amateur - home made quality film then this is what you have been waiting for. it is a complete waste of time and i really wish i had never watched this.",1476835200,,1093,4.445

7785793,1,B01HDHAA9S,"It was an awful knockoff of a found footage, found footage movie that sucked worse then what it knocked off of.  They have the camera break down when anything good is going to happen well not to say anything really good happened. The story was worn out. The performers were something you would see at your local Wally World type park in some play projecting their voices loud and unrealistically with some emotion or another. The camera work ....well found footage. Lighting and sound not up to par. OK something nice um the actress was pretty. The house was really nice. Best I can do. The movie was a waste of time plain and simple.",1476662400,,634,4.51304347826087

I've seen pornos filmed on VHS in a back yard of a house that has better acting. Good grief, the only thing ""Insane"" about this, was I watched the entire train wreck, rather than the insides of my eyelids...like my wife opted.
Let me point out a few glaring and blatant mistakes I don't think are even taught in film school because they rank with: ""Make sure the camera is on"". If you have an actor standing at the stove ""cooking"", maybe actually have something in the pan and have the stove on, plates out, bags of food...ANYTHING to suggest the actor is actually making something, rather than have them pushing a spatula around an empty cold frying pan. Also if you're trying to show actors watching TV, how's about having a TV in front of them.....on. Really? REALLY?? Wow, this was bad. Was this supposed to be a frightening movie? Or an example of how to make terrible waste of hard drive space? The most terrifying thing about this film was the thought that you might be supporting a family on an income producing such magnificent bowel movements you call, film.

7785917,1,B01HDHAA9S,"Oh my gosh, this movie is so bad that it's epic.  Almost like one of those movies that becomes a cult classic (Troll 2, anyone?) because of how poorly done it is.  It's the acting that's so bad...it's so staged and it's like a high school drama class in which people are reading off of scripts.  The guy's reaction when he is watching the clown footage made me lol, and it's just the fact that he was trying so hard to look surprised.  It's painfully bad too....not like they were trying to make it bad, but that they were trying so hard to make it good that makes it painful to watch.  I really wanted to watch a good horror flick too, and I tried to get into it, but it was ""INSANELY"" bad.  Epic.",1472256000,3,698,4.133333333333334

Totally over or underacted at times but I was completely entertained.  I was squirming or laughing out loud. Vincent Rivera was totally believable as an guy just filming with his camera.  Refreshingly different take on the Paranormal Activity type film.  The ending was a little sudden, but could have been way worse.  A WELL endowed female lead and a killer clown.  What more could you want?  And no, I am not a paid reviewer.  I actually watched this movie on Prime and will be purchasing it as a thank you to the film makers.

7785951,1,B01HDHAA9S,"Never, ever have I seen such a poor excuse for a film!  I can only assume this was filmed by the pool mN and his girlfriend with a couple of friends while the homeowner was away. Perhaps we weren't expected to notice the fact that there was minimal furniture and virtually no household decorations-not even one personal item?  The female lead was easily the worst actress I've ever seen-she can't even realistically ""cook"" a meal! (It was probably due to the fact that there appeared to be only one single frying pan!  Not a plate or utensil in sight!  The acting was so bad it actually made me laugh in several spots!  The last 9 minutes were mildly amusing.

7785961,3,B01HDHAA9S,"Ok first off, What the hell was she cooking every time she was in the kitchen? Do you want scratched/chipped pans cause that's how you get them! Secondly, Who's shadow was that when they were playing with Ouija board? Why didn't they really show any footage outside (cameras) or call someone other then their neighbor/realtor when they noticed people running around. I know these are all questions that may be unanswered but it really would have helped the film rather then have some pretty horrible editing that looked like a school project and mismatched timelines. I give it an A for creativity but other then that it wasn't that great. I went 34 minutes until I said ""what the hell is going on?!"" which honestly is a lot longer then most ""B"" rated found footage films I would bare to watch, But beer and boredom get to you sometimes. So my take on the film, If you have an hour or so and just want to stare at a decent looking girl and some ok acting, grab a beer and watch this...

Michael loves to film everything and wires up the house when creepy things start following the discovery of a Jack-in-the-box and playing with a cool looking Ouija Board.

If you liked the ""Paranormal"" series, then this one wasn't far from the formula.  Marcella Rodriguez provided us with some nice eye-candy (if you are into legs, cleavage, and butts) but the over-all feature was typical of the found footage genre.

This movie is a painful slog with nothing occurring (beyond appalling acting) for the entire runtime. The only thing that could kinda-sorta pass for even ""horror content"" is an ten second off-camera bludgeoning.

Really, if not for some mild language, this would be PG, but even kids wouldn't want to watch it as NOTHING happens but expository dialogue and arguing between the lead couple. Oh, and yeah, occasionally a dude in a clown costume stands in some shots.",1470787200,4,552,4.989130434782608

Money was spent to make this. Actual dollars were spent to film, edit, and release this.  I assume the people in it were willing participants and I hope to god they were paid, but they all acted out their scenes like the director knew some horrible secret of theirs and would release it instantly if they refused.
