7839018,5,6303106870,"I got this video about 13yrs ago and lost about 15lbs, (my most overweight at 133lbs) for a 5' person.  I used to be in drill team & took ballet & modern dance in high school (class of 91) so I was used to exercising & looking well toned. Anyways, I got careless w/ my body after college so I definitely needed to get back & I was determined.  At first I was not able to finish this workout & would get too tired.  Then I learned to breathe & I was amazed at myself for being able to finish this video.  I like that it made me sweat unlike any other video so I worked out 3 times a week and I got results.  I was able to see the middle line of my stomach & the obliques.  My heartrate improved that I was able to hike up Half Dome & Mt Whitney & I thank this video for it.  For the past 5yrs I have been out of touch with exercising because I was busy having two kids, just this year in February I started again and this time I'm trying to workout at least 5days a week and I'm trying a variety of videos, TaeBo (cardio,extreme & bootcamp), Tony Horton's Power 90(I've worked my way to level 3&4), Jillian Michaels (6pack in 6wks) & this video from Karen Voight. I've picked high impact workouts and I like the variety I'm incorporating in my workouts but Karen Voight's power pack is still my favorite because it makes me sweat the most, even more than TaeBo which is another favorite. I've gotten so used to her moves after doing it for so long that I easily go into it and after trying it after 5yrs of rest it's as if I had never stopped working it. This video is dying of use and I really got to get another one because this is too good to lose.",1301616000,,1650,4.012195121951219
7839019,4,6303106870,"I first bought this video about 14 years ago and loved the fact that it is fast-paced and high energy. Sadly the video literaly wore out and I was really pleased to find a replacement copy.
This isn't a video for someone just starting out in exercise, it would be impossible to keep up. The choreography is quite complex and moves along at a cracking pace. It also looks quite dated, workout clothes, music etc. I still enjoy working out with karen though and love the old-style aerobics.
If you are an advanced exerciser and love jumping around you will enjoy this video but it does look very different to the modern style aerobics. If you are used to Christie Taylor or Cathe Friedrich be prepared for something very different. A blast from the past.",1280793600,,752,4.5777777777777775
7839020,4,6303106870,"This is a nonstop, fast-paced, invigorating workout.  The abs at the end are great, too.  The only problems: the moves are a little hard to follow and the warm-up is ridiculously long.  Doesn't stop me from doing the workout, though.  I do it a couple times a week, mixed in with my other exercise programs.",1253836800,,307,4.527272727272727
7839021,5,6303106870,"In contrast to other reviewers, let me say - I DON'T like Karen! But this workout is different (thank goodness!) and in my opinion her only one worth having. I'm an advanced exerciser and this high impact, fast-paced, old-style aerobics routine is nicely challenging. Karen is pleasant and natural (no implants yet - and looks great) and there is no problem with cueing. This is from 1990, so the music is older, club-style, but not boring. The 12 minute ab section is really good. I add ankle and wrist weights and it's very effective with modified exercises that keep me interested.",1245801600,,584,4.792079207920792
7839022,5,6303106870,"In a time when people swear to slow pilates (zzz), candle yoga, chakra spinning, ultra slow salsa low impact aerobics it's good to wake up the spirit and feel the joy of a proper fast full on high impact aerobics routine. Okay Karens cuing isn't the best in this video, but that doesn't bother me, because this video is a dying breed. Short routines, big movements and the music brings back all those sweaty memories from the aerobics studio back in the early 1990's! This video is challenging due to its intensity and impact, and that's just what I need. It finishes off with an abdominal workout and a stretch! Get this video if you love fast high impact aerobics and a good challenge. Enjoy",1230076800,,693,4.552
7839023,1,6303106870,"Let me start by saying ""I love Karen Voight.""  I have nearly everything she's done, and I like nearly all of it.  Except this.  What I like about most of her videos is that they are not super complicated, or super dancey, but you get a great workout from a very straightforward lady.  Well, I guess this is a great workout, since I couldn't do even half the foot moves, let alone the very complicated arms.  But it is super dancey.  And the styling and clothes?  Let's just say that Farrah Fawcet and the old Jane Fonda's have some real competition.  Give me the newer stuff any day.  Smooth moves and Energy Sprint are among the best.  And Karen, the hair?  Stay short, ok?",1076803200,,674,4.354838709677419
7839024,2,6303106870,"When you see this video, the outfits & exercise style all indicate it was produced over a decade ago. That's not a problem for me if I find it's an excellent workout. (I actually like some of the classic Firm videos). But this workout isn't excellent. Basically, it's a bunch of complex moves done at a fast pace for a long time. If you love dancing & learning complex choreography, then this is the tape for you. If you're just looking for a challenging workout that keeps your heart rate up, you don't need such complex choreography to achieve it. Try Kathy Smith's Functionally Fit Peak Fat Burning Workout instead. Also, some reviewers mentioned the Ab workout is one of the best. I'm an advanced exerciser (which is why I tried this tape) and didn't find the ab work challenging at all. Karen's current DVD - Sleek Physique contains a better ab workout. And if you want even more of a challenge, try Tamilee Webb's I Want Those Abs. There's a reason this video isn't being produced anymore and you can only get it used. There are plenty of better, current workouts available instead.",1072483200,2,1088,4.61340206185567
7839025,5,6303106870,"I used to run about 20 miles a week and this was one of the few cardio tapes that could really get my heart pumping! I just started using it again although I'm not in as great shape as I used to be.
People's main criticisms I've read are that the music and outfits are dated and the combinations are complex and very fast-paced. All of those things are true but none of them ever bothered me before. However, if you are at more of a beginner's or intermediate level - you may want to start with an easier video or only do part of the cardio not all on this one.",1056326400,,561,4.017857142857143
7839026,5,6303106870,"Karen Voight's Videos are excellent.  She doesn't talk through it, other then the instructions.  I have used other tapes where they talk about something other than doing the exercise and it bores you hearing it over and over again.  Karen is smart and just sticks with instruction and form.
As for the Power Packed video, it is a video I will be doing for a long time. It is extremely challenging.  I know I will not reach a plateau any time soon.  Every time I get past a point in the video without feeling winded, I know I have reached another goal.  The tape is 60 minutes.  10 minutes warm up, and 30 cardio and 12 stomach and  then cool down.  I use this tape 3x a week.  I do weights two to three times a week and I am starting to see results!!",1042761600,,750,4.145833333333333
7839027,2,6303106870,"Just a warning to anyone who is just starting, I work out every morning, this video was so discouraging. Karen does not ease into any moves.  You can't keep up because she is changing without saying where to go..I love to  sweat, but this was a turn off.  I want to have a little direction.  Not on  of her best, and I love Voight videos.",955929600,7,338,4.138461538461539
