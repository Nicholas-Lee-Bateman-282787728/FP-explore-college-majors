5926995,4,B00EL6NWB8,Would be 5 stars if you were there. But it's real tough to get a great sound or video in a venue this small. There's maybe 2 or 3 hundred people crammed into this place. A very small intimate setting. Sound is OK but nothing stellar like some of his other work. Playing is typical Joe. Real good. Rhodes and Fig put forth good performances too. Picture quality is fine. Hard not to capture everything here as the stage is probably 10 x 15 feet. They play tunes you don't hear on his other releases. It's just a couple of amps and a basic drum kit. But these guys whale and have a great time. 5.1 DTS HD is kinda lame cause there's nothing in the rears to record. Occasional audience noise is about it. But all in all for what this is supposed to be it's well worth having. It's all about the music.,1385337600,2,798,4.15483870967742
5926996,4,B00EL6NWB8,"I've enjoyed many excellent, innovative guitarists since 1960. Joe is one of my 5 favorites. But he is so prolific, I can't keep up with his work (nice problem to have). He will be a 5 star plus rating, only if I live to 100 with good hearing. His work is to be savored, like a $$$$$ bottle of wine not chugged like a mature Thunderbird.

As I think on it, perhaps when it comes to Joe's body of work, I'll practice less and listen more. He deserves a * * * * * + after all!",1385164800,,474,3.88659793814433
5926997,4,B00EL6NWB8,"First in the series, I enjoyed this quite a bit. I don't think it's quite as strong as the later shows, but still a must-have if you are a Joe Bonamassa fan. The small crowd was treated to a great show.",1384905600,2,202,3.951219512195122
5926998,5,B00EL6NWB8,"Joe Bonamassa what can you say! The gentleman rocks! He is truly gifted and a man of music ability. I would recommend these DVD to anyone who loves music especially the blues, rock and acoustic",1383609600,,193,4.542857142857143
5926999,4,B00EL6NWB8,"I'm still wondering about this one. Joe is a great performer but somehow this concert does not grab me with the energy of some of his other works. One reviewer wrote that this was every bit as good as his 'Rockplast' concert, but I actually liked that one better. I also think his Beacon Theater show was better than this. The stage on this London concert was small and the red curtain for the back ground looks cheap and boring. I also noticed the sound quality seemed better on the Beacon show. Don't get me wrong, JB, is one of the best players out there today, I just wish this concert was a little more Rock'in!",1383523200,6,616,4.318965517241379
5927000,5,B00EL6NWB8,"I'm putting basically the same review up for all 4 BR/DVDs and I hope you don't mind but they are consistently excellent and I'd be redundant anyway.

I just picked up all four BR sets and am so thrilled.  When I first saw these ""coming"" at my local record store (yes I'm lucky to have one near me Fingerprints in Long Beach CA) I thought, why bother putting out 4 videos from 4 shows on the same tour... and it struck me as overkill or as one review thought a runaway ego.  Yesterday I picked them all up and noted that they are 4 shows, 4 different bands, 4 venues and 4 concepts..

They are all great and for different reasons, but they all share things in common, great visuals, great sound, great playing and great value for money. All come with 28 page booklets full of excellent pictures and information and all come with bonus features about the shows that are consecutive in nature (4 part making of that ads about an hour to each BR/DVD!).

Favorite moments for me are Joe's treatment of the late Gary Moore's ""Midnight Blues"" both on his Blues night at Shepards Bush and his night at The Royal Albert Hall. Jeff Becks ""Spanish Boots"" from the trio/Borderline show is also worth the price on its own! From the first show which features his TRIO days sound to the blues w/horns at Shepards Bush to the Rock show at Hammersmith and the final big night at the Royal Albert Hall these shows (ranging from 1 hour and 40 minutes to over 2 hours each) are wonderful expressions of a love of music by one of this generations greatest guitarists and for me to have this much classic Les Paul guitar playing is heaven.

I'd caution folks who think its too much, what would you give to have the same treatment by Gary Moore? Eric Clapton? heck...instead of highlights from the CREAM Reunion , what about a BR disc for every night? Complete? Would you want this from Peter Green at his best? Of course. I think that an artist like Joe Bonamassa who is certainly at a creative peak and has music and ideas flying off his fingers should capture as much of this as possible before he's too darned tired or burned out!!!

You can view each individual show to see if there is a song or set list that has more appeal to you. Personally I am in the mood for rock sometimes, blues with horns other times, trio work others, so I'll return to these depending and I'm glad I have all 4.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1383004800,13,2393,4.373873873873874

5927016,5,B00EL6NWB8,"Well what can i say except it is Joe Bonamassa. I stumbled across his music
about 2.5 years ago. I decide to buy a CD and saw him 2 time in concert.
I really enjoy watching such a master guitarist. For those of you who have not
seen him live should put it on your bucket list. These Blu-ray's are just fantastic
I have ticket already to see him this fall.",1401667200,,355,4.014084507042254
5927017,5,B00EL6NWB8,"Best live show by JoBo since the Rockpalast DVD!!!! Joe is at his best and most sincere when playing in a smaller venue, much like many artists are. For the guitar nerds (like me) he plays prob 80% of the set list with a 60's model Strat. This is vintage JoBo! Does brilliant cover of Jimi Hendrix's ""Are you Experienced"" too",1397692800,3,325,4.344262295081967

5927019,5,B00EL6NWB8,I first heard Joe at work when someone was playing his CD Live at The Beacon Theater in NYC and was so excited to hear someone I hadn't heard before and to be so talented.  I immediately went on line to find more of his music and ended up getting all 4 of the Tour de Force DVD's and I honestly can't say which is the best.  They are all equally as good or more and hightly recommend them to any who enjoy good music and incredible talent.,1395964800,,439,3.977272727272727
5927020,5,B00EL6NWB8,"Another great set of discs from one of the most surprising and amazing guitar players of all time! Joe and his mates deliver such a  marvelous list of songs, played like the bands in the seventies used to do: with passion and perfection. It is really good to see that the blues rock genre has, finally, a true king! Buy all four; they're all sensational. One of my favourite tracks: ""Blues Deluxe"" (by Rod Stewart).",1394582400,,415,4.533333333333333
5927021,5,B00EL6NWB8,"We are relatively new to Joe Bonamassa. We saw him for the first time on PBS doing the Vienna concert.....had never heard of him and just din't know who he was. Spotted him again on Clapton's 2010 Crossroads DVD. We now have all four Bluray videos of the 2013 London ""Tour de Force"" performances. Does that tell you something about how much we enjoy his music and performances?",1394150400,2,377,4.5588235294117645
5927022,5,B00EL6NWB8,"I would have killed to see this show by Joe Bonamassa, as this was held in a very small club, and those kinds of venues usually provide the audience with the best opportunity to see their heroes up close and personal. This dvd is no exception as Joe and his drummer and bass player rip through a highly charged set of electric blues. My only personal gripe would be that they kind of drop the ball on the very last song, a cover of Jimi Hendrix' ""Have You Ever Been Experienced"", in which they come close,but no cigar, to capturing the feel of the original version. Of course, Jimi being Jimi, I don't know if ANYONE could really replicate the feel of that song. Don't get me wrong, it's not a deal-killer by any means, and everything else on this dvd is well worth the cost of admission. I would advise anyone wanting these Tour de Force dvds to get them individually,rather than in the 4-pack set I've seen advertised on many different sites. There are no differences in the content of the 4-pack and the one-offs, except that the 4-pack will cost you significantly more for putting all 4 dvds together in a simple cardboard box. Just a tip to the wise consumer.",1394064000,4,1164,4.44392523364486
5927023,5,B00EL6NWB8,One of the best buy's I've ever made.  Electric is the only way to describe watching Joe and the others,1393632000,,103,4.15
5927024,5,B00EL6NWB8,"Just an awesome setting for a JB concert.  He played his tail off in this one!  Great song selection, camera angles, and sound quality!  A great addition to a JB collection!",1392768000,,173,4.516129032258065
5927025,5,B00EL6NWB8,"Awesome blues-rock guitar show at The Borderline!
Brings me back to when I would see Joe at Mexicali Blues in Teaneck NJ about 10 years ago.
A great rythem section, but this show is all Joe - the ultimate power trio guitarist!
Fans of Hendrix, Cream, Robin Trower, SRV, and any power trio you can name, will eat up this DVD.
Turn it on and turn it up!",1391472000,,351,4.176470588235294
5927026,5,B00EL6NWB8,I think Joe is at his best with a three-piece band and this lineup certainly does not disappoint!  Definitely a must for Bonamassa fans.,1389052800,,136,4.666666666666667
5927027,5,B00EL6NWB8,Joe Bonamassa plays so many styles of music incredibly well. The set of Tour de Force DVD's is a perfect example of what Joe is and has been all about foe over a decade. If you are not a fan you will be after watching the set of 4.,1387497600,,231,3.7346938775510203
5927028,5,B00EL6NWB8,"The show felt like I was in the front row, watching 3 incredible musicians jam and play off each other. The sound is well mixed and the bare bones back drop makes an intimate setting. great show all around. Joe is playing better than ever and it was great to see him rip on the Fender strat again. Worth buying for repeated watchings",1386720000,,333,4.301587301587301
5927029,5,B00EL6NWB8,"Has to be one of the best recorded concert BD's out there, bar none. Picture quality is absolutely stunning, and the audio is even better. I could hear every single note being played by all 3 players at all times, Kevin Sheryl needs to be praised for his production and recording quality as much as JB's playing, and what more could be said there! I will defiantly complete the set.

I wish Amazon had a 3 Criteria rating system, that would make for a quicker and more accurate rating of Cd's DVD's and Blu-ray's.

1. Performance: ***** +
2. Quality of Audio: ***** +
3. Quality of Video (for DVD's and Blu-ray's): ***** +

Bands that wish to have there performances recognized and recorded should be held to a standard. Poor audio, no matter how good the performance, is still a bad product. Those who would still purchase sub-standard audio quality recordings and rank that product highly are not doing the industry, the band or others justice. Demand better and we will get it.",1385510400,,980,4.620689655172414
5927030,5,B00EL6NWB8,"In the spring of 2013 guitar wiz Joe Bonamassa set out to play 4 nights in London.  No big deal right?  Well this was 4 nights with 4 different sets of musicians playing 4 different play lists at 4 different venues.  His first night out was at a small (200 seats) club called The Borderline.  The stage was tiny, barely enough to hold Bonamassa, bass player Michael Rhodes and drummer Anton Fig.  Some may recognize Fig as the house drummer on Dave Letterman's Late Show.  I believe I'm correct in saying Bonamassa started out with a trio playing blues jams and that's what we get here.  And like everything I've seen Bonamassa do so far, he's as good as ever.

It took me a while to get settled in but the group really begins to click with ""Pain and Sorrow,"" ""Happier Times,"" and ""Steal Your Heart Away"" during the middle section.  I also have a fondness for ""Burning Hell,"" a John Lee Hooker song.  The trio wrap things up with the famous Jimi Hendrix number, ""Are You Experienced?""  Joe is an obvious follower of Hendrix.

This Blu ray package includes a killer DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track and you will want to turn it up...way up.  The video is top notch as well and must have been exceptionally difficult to film in this small setting.  Still director Philippe Klose and producer Kevin Shirley do a great job with the logistics and the set selection.  The concert itself runs 93 minutes and there is another hour or so of bonus features including ""No Man's Land"" (a behind the scenes look), ""The Making of Tour de Force"" (part 1) and ""All Access Pass"" (photo collection of The Borderline).",1385424000,11,1596,4.531468531468532
