this case as it adds to the story.  Chow Yun-fat and Brigitte Lin are superb
as an on-screen couple. Their acting range is great.

I saw this movie years ago and recently rediscovered it and had to have it in my
Chow Yun-fat collection.",1474761600,,319,4.3
7909714,5,B00000IBY5,"Great movie but talk about price gouging - 50 bucks for a dvd! That's totally ridiculous and without any extra features!  I'm going to pass on some valuable info to my fellow Hong Kong movie buffs. Do yourselves a favor and visit [...] - they are a terrific Canadian distributor of original HK version dvds. ""Dream Lovers"" is only about $7-$8 USD. Most of their HK titles fall within this price range. ""Hero"" now at theatres starring Jet Li, Maggie Cheung, Tony Leung is also available for this price. Their service is outstanding. You can pretty much find any title at their website with original Mandarin/Chinese audio and subtitled. Don't buy any American studio dubbed or edited versions. Boycott Disney and their subsidiaries such as Miramax/Dimension films until they show respect for Asian cinema. They are buying HK catalog titles and butchering by editing and English dubbing. Disney is also purchasing HK titles to keep in storage without release. By doing so, Disney can keep the original studios from releasing these titles and have a monopoly on the catalog. Talk about DisNazi tactics! Visit the Web Alliance for the Respectful Treatment of Asian Cinema to sign the petition to Miramax. Over 13,000 signatures have been collected.",1093910400,6,1244,5.038834951456311
7909715,4,B00000IBY5,"...but if you like an intelligent, artful, thoughtful, and  (unthinkable if this were to be re-made by Hollywood) profoundly rewarding cinematic romance, this is the film for you.  So what if the attire and sets are a bit 1980ish?  Unlike forgettable Hollywood knockoffs, Tony Au's background in costume and set design-- much like Zhang Yimou at his best-- reminds the viewer throughout the film just how powerful color, sound, and imagery can be.  The star-crossed lovers theme, echoed over 20 centuries, gives the film a transcendence seldom found in any ""romance.""  Aside from a rather pathetic attempt to mimic a young Leonard Bernstein on the podium, Yun-Fat Chow gives one of the most nuanced performances of his career (and demonstrates that he doesn't have to just pull a trigger and crack wise to convey screen persona).  Brigitte Lin is stunning as Yuet-Heung, Chow's centuries-lost lover reincarnated.  And Cher Yeung gives what I hope was an award-winning performance at *some* film festival *somewhere* as Chow's girlfriend of 8 years who suddenly finds herself supplanted by a 20 century-long ""dream"" of love.  Her visceral emotional pain is at the core of this film, and her final sequence is perhaps one of the most devastating portrayals captured on celluloid within this genre.  ""Eight years or two thousand...it's still love"": that line itself captures the simplicity as well as the uncompromising profundity of the film.  Well worth the price of your purchase, whatever that may be.",1066867200,,1502,5.169421487603306
7909716,5,B00000IBY5,"The legendary Chow Yuen Fatt is paired with Hong Kong's once beloved all-time actress Lin Ching Hsia.

This is a movie that tells us that love is love, regardless the time, the time span and the players involved. Love is hard, the first time and given a chance, harder the second round.

Chow plays a modern day concert conductor and Lin, the alluring artifact expert of sort. They both dreamed about each other. They eventually know they were tragic lovers from their past lives.

She, the obedient wife of a Qin dynasty architect (sentenced to death) in the previous life obeyed and died with her beloved husband.

Now they are reborned as mortals, as Chow's character from previous life wanted it to be ""I prefer flesh and blood"".  Starting over in a modern day presents a different problem that is equally tragic: there is another player in this love affair, Chow has a lover.

The questions put forth is simple: What you did for love once, would you do it again, had you the opportunity? Time has changed us, no two people can remain the same. Love transforms us, but it is time that eventually changes us. Chow and Lin portray sensitively the couple trying to understand and become the lovers they once were.

Dream Lovers asks what we should forsake for love, or might be love, or even a dream of what love could be, versus what we should hang on to, and at what price.

This is a layered movie, with visually stunning sets, although the artwork seemed a bit conscious and contrived.

Chow is flawless and Lin engaging, relentlessly stoic and vulnerable at the same time.

Don't miss this one. It goes straight for the heart.",1039910400,2,1632,4.615916955017301
7909717,5,B00000IBY5,"one of the main reasons I wanted to watch this movie was because brigitte lin and chow yun fat were in it together. something that you don't see much of. both of whom are excellent actress and actor. knowing this I expected nothing but the best. and this is what I bought.
this movie is about two lovers who lived 2000 years ago during the Qin Dynasty, and 2000 years later find each other again, being drawn to each other, by way of visions from their pasts.  this is a tragic love story that justs mesmerizes you to the screen. now i am not much of a love story person, I go for the high action movies. but this one movie, dream lovers, I would recommend to anyone, especially those who like a good love story movie.",984873600,,718,4.240875912408759
7909718,5,B00000IBY5,"Excellent movie plot between a man and a woman who have some unfinished business from the past.  They find themselves drawn to each other after not seeing one another for too many years [an understatement, to say the  least!].  Nevertheless, the years between them have not been enough to  break the bond that they once shared...  To say any more than that is to  give the rest away.  Just buy the DVD [which is what I am basing my review  on] or the VHS Tape and enjoy it as the story unfolds before your eyes!",953251200,2,511,4.3052631578947365
