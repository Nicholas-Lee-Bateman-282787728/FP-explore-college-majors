3455156,1,B001ANQY10,This film sucks.  The worse job of film editing I have seen.  Must have been made for someother continent.,1271721600,,106,4.526315789473684
3455157,4,B001ANQY10,"Not a half bad romantic comedy, always on the search for something new, this one has it's up and downs but overall bounces between laughs and sentiment effectively.

Mary(Lauren German) owns a struggling bakery; she needs money quick.  Her Mr. Always Do Right, allergic, rash-developing fiance(Gabriel Mann) is unable to accompany her to finally meet her family in Texas, where she hopes to hit up Grandpa for the needed 'dough' to save her business.  But Pappy is adamant about seeing the young stud before giving his blessing and his gift. Solution: get the fiance's ne'er-do-right twin brother(also Gabriel Mann)to temporarily play the part and fool the family.

What ensues is a love-hate relationship between the couple as they meet all the quirky but loving Texan relations and which follows the typical, romantic comedy genre. What we pay to see. Right?

Ms. German is actually good at playing the inexperienced, wishy-washy but lovely entrepreneur.  The actress shows great potential, certainly a refreshing change from her ""Chainsaw Massacre' and 'Hostel' movies.

Gabriel Mann portrays the polar opposite twins, Jake and Brent. Both are kind of annoying, e.g., there's a scene, like many classic, romantic comedies, where the heroine and fiance's brother must sleep Platonically in the same bed; however, he insists that he's not comfortable unless he sleeps in the nude.  Just wasn't funny. I know you need conflict between the love interests, but his character really didn't exude much endearment at least not until the finale.  I kept wondering if there was anyone else besides these brothers she could meet.

Overall, the funniest characters are her family, and this is where the movie rises to the occasion: eccentric, embarrassing parents, sexpot, Jessica Simpson-type, loo-loo, plastic wrap man and whom, I really like- Ben Gourley(Kirby), as her over the top brother and want to be hip singer.  He co-starred in two entertaining and really low budgeters: 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Moving McAllister'.

The movie flatlines in parts, but overall, it's shot well and definitely above the usual, run of the mill, B-movie.  It finishes nicely and provides all that's required for us diehard romantics who also want a few, painless, brainless laughs.  3-4 stars.",1226361600,2,2275,5.248618784530387
3455158,5,B001ANQY10,"I saw Love and Mary at the Los Angeles Film Festival and met the director Elizabeth Harrison after the viewing.  I was blown away by the small budget and time frame it took to produce this wonderful gem of a film!  Yes, it takes place in Texas, but it will remind you of any hometown, and everyone has relatives like this!  The audiance was laughing so hard during most of the film, I'm sure I missed several funny lines, so am looking forward to watching it again.  The two leads are great, but the ""lesser"" cast members steel the show.  I made my boyfriend go with me, begrudingly, and he laughed just as loud as everyone else and thanked me afterwards for making him go!  Don't miss this flick, it will brighten your day!",1219017600,4,724,4.365671641791045

Austin last year.

Houston must have had dazzling weather while this was being filmed.
It's a romantic comedy with a delicious plot that generates a tender sweetness.

Beautifully crafted and filmed, with seamless editing - hard
to believe this is an indie.",1219017600,2,311,4.849056603773585
