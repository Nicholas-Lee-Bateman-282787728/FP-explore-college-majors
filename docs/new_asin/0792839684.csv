But once this poorly made fish creature began appearing while devoring half the cast, the movie transformed into an exact clone of Alien and I lost interest. Peter Weller and Ernie Hudson are the bright spots in an otherwise routine monster film with an unbelievably stupid ending.",991612800,3,345,4.864406779661017
149961,4,0792839684,"I recently viewed this movie again.  I was surprised by how suspenseful I still found the movie.  Though the special effects are not what you could expect in today's films, they were adequate for it's time.  Aside from one corny line at the end by Peter Weller (which is strangely like a line from Jaws) the script was well written.  The story line, plot, and actors were all good.  The movie is well worth seeing and dwells in my memory as one of my favorites.",988329600,,461,4.376470588235295
149962,4,0792839684,Yeah so its a little like Alien and The thing. So. I liked Alien and The Thing(1982) and i Think this is almost as good. I mean if your looking for somithing simular to those alien movies who cares if its not original.,983664000,,218,4.093023255813954
149963,3,0792839684,"Leviathan isn't nearly as good as the movie it so obviously tries to be. Though it offers better creature effects and set-designs than ALIEN, as well as a larger cast, and an equally good score, that doesn't justify its total lack of imagination. If you're a fan of the horror genere, you'll likely enjoy this movie. Be warned however. This movie is basically Alien set underwater. So if you're looking for something fresh, look elsewhere, because you'll probably see where this movie is headed less than fifteen minutes into it. Though Leviathan lacks in the plot department, it still exceeds the quality of most monster movies released in the theaters, which is why I recommend it. But to enjoy this movie fully, you should really watch it on DVD. Leviathan was shot in a 2.35:1 widescreen format. And when a movie is shot with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, it means you'll only be seeing roughly half the image when you're watching it on t.v. or VHS, which are best to be avoided if you want to see this movie the way it was meant to be seen.",980208000,10,1038,4.55614973262032

149965,3,0792839684,"There is very little good to offer in Leviathan, Jerry Goldsmith contributes the usual excellent score, but that is about it - despite being trapped with a monster, which is a pretty unispired (and hardly seen) guy in a suit, the story never really catches fire. If you are like me and enjoy watching laughably silly cinematic misfires like this, then by all means check it out. If not, and you've seen both Alien and John Carpenter's The Thing, then skip it, you won't miss it at all.",959817600,,485,4.5227272727272725

150092,2,0792839684,"Decent monster movie is basically Alien under water and came out at roughly the same time as two other underwater thrillers, Deepstar Six and The Abyss.  This one falls squarely in the middle quality wise.  It has a good cast, especially star Peter Weller, and very 1980's creature effects by Stan Winston.  Unfortunately, director George P Cosmatos (Rambo; Tombstone) shows little flair for orchestrating horror mayhem so Leviathan is never really very scary or suspenseful.  Definitely not a classic like The Thing or Alien but if you're looking for a monster movie you could certainly do much worse.",1478649600,,602,5.112244897959184

It's showing it's age and the creature is a rip off of John Carpenter's The Thing but as previously mentioned Leviathan really does run of out of steam towards the end, I couldn't wait for it to finish.

 The end product creature at the end looks terrible and remains suspiciously out of shot when the camera is filming looking down at the helicopter.

I have a weakness for 80s monster movies and had a blast watching this when it came on cable one night.  I get what people mean when they say it is more like Alien underwater but it also had elements that were reminiscent of The Thing.  Some parts of it were pretty funny (the mutating, crawling leg, for example) but overall it still looks pretty good considering its age.  Yes, the ending was hilarious and the movie itself was pretty predictable, but it was good for late-night viewing over the weekend.

The Abyss is the best, but I watch Leviathan and DeepStarSix more often because they are fun scifi horror 80s B movies with cool creatures. Stan Winstson created the creature for this feature, which is basically Alien underwater on Earth. It's not perfect, but it's good for what it is. It has a great cast and cool morphing monster a la The Thing, but I wish there was more screen time with the uniquely designed monster. Leviathan and DeepStarSix make a great double feature Sunday. And if you want to add one more to your roster, here's two options- for big budget impressive effects and solid story go for The Abyss, if you want lowbudget cheesy gore filled fun (including some dubbing) go for The Rift aka Endless decent, both of which also released in 1989.",1425081600,3,903,4.65

LEVIATHAN: Three miles beneath the Atlantic, deep-sea miners extract precious metals from the ocean floor during an extremely hazardous 90-day shift. When they find a sunken Russian ship, Sixpack (Stern) confiscates the safe, which is filled with the personal effects of numerous crewmembers who died from some mysterious malady. He also filches a bottle of vodka, which makes him deathly illthen kills him. The Docs (Crenna) best guess is a virus causing genetic alteration. Good call: It transforms Sixpack into a slimy, gut-crunching monster, half human, half deep-sea creature. When the thing goes on a rampage looking for new meat and tearing up the station in the process, can any of the others escape? And why is The Company dragging its feet in sending in a rescue?

Discussion: Call it Alien from the Abyss; when first released, the comparisons were inevitable (and fair). And how could it measure up to either? As a pastiche, however, its entertaining enough for those who enjoyed the originals. So the scripts not original. So what? Its still a solid thriller, and the flicks main draw lies not in its oft-told story of sacrificed miners versus an alien killing machine and a corrupt corporation, but in its suitably detailed sets, its atmospheric photography, and its cast of second bananas with appeal. And its not as though the writers were trying to put one over on us; the fact that its a conscious homage to Alien is made perfectly clear with the inclusion of a slyly clever shot panning across a big bowl of popcorn just prior to the chest-chomping monsters first appearance.

The cinematography and direction is very well done. This film was panned by most because of the similarities to the aforementioned films. Though I believe people are quite harsh on this one. The 80's was filled with tons of 'terror in the water' type films. This one actually had a budget and was done nicely. It's not that scary but does capture the terror of being trapped underwater with a monster well. It's good for a late night watch and is filled with top 80's actors.

150283,3,0792839684,"Alien underwater.  That's really all that needs to be said about 1989's Leviathan.  Hell.  Some DVDs even throw that very quote right on the cover!  The producers even got Jerry Goldsmith (Alien) providing the orchestral score and Stan Winston (Aliens) doing the creature effects.

If you've seen Alien or John Carpenter's The Thing you've seen Leviathan.  Seriously, tell me if any of these things ring a bell:

A blue collar crew about to return home after a long job.
A monster than infests hosts and incorporates them into its biology
A doctor who has a magic conversation with his computer which tells him how dangerous the lifeform is.
A heartless corporation that is willing to let an entire crew die.
Metal corridors full of pipes and swinging chains
Flamethrowers are immediately available as a weapon of choice for crewmembers.

If you've seen Alien or The Thing you know this movie.  I don't want to be to hard on the film, because honestly, as far as knock offs go it's probably one of the better ones.

Aside from Peter Weller, Richard Crenna, and Ernie Hudson most of the cast and the characters they portray are uninteresting horror clichs.  There aren't any memorable character moments, or even death scenes for these people and what I think is an attempt at romantic chemistry between Weller and Amanda Pays completely misses the mark.

The creature itself is what happens when The Thing is mashed together with a deep sea fish.  It consumes and absorbs people into its body via an infection which can be transmitted in a variety of ways.  Several of these are fairly inconsistent.  First off, it was a Russian ailment put in Vodka.  Next it can leap out and straight up absorb you into a monstrous form within -what the film implies to be- a matter of minutes, if not seconds.  Then finally it can transmit simply by scratching/grabbing a person.  This last one makes the least sense as the heroes are probably grabbed by this thing multiple times without becoming infected.  Maybe Peter Weller's still got RoboCop's body under his t-shirt- I don't know!  I also don't understand how, when disposing of the first mutant, that it can be killed by ejecting it into the sea.  The film establishes that the mutation is a deep sea species (and, SPOILER: later on one has no problem what so ever being out in the ocean).

I could ignore lots of this if the movie featured a great monster design and effects, but it doesn't.  Stan Winston (Terminator, Aliens, Jurassic Park) is a miracle man in the realm of practical monster design and effects, but the mutant in Leviathan simply isn't scary!  It really does just come across a poor man's Thing with a fish head.  Now, in Stan's defense this may have more to do with poor editing and cinematography that the mutant looks so rubbery and fake, because looking at the animatronic and suit the thing isn't worse than other Winston projects.  Even then I'd still say it's one of his team's weakest creature designs.

Far and away the best component of Leviathan is Jerry Goldsmith's score.  Goldsmith's score is moody and helps establish the eerie atmosphere the film so desperately wishes it could achieve.  If everything lived up to this the movie would probably be a 4/5, Alien rip off and all!

So, in conclusion: while Leviathan certainly isn't a good movie I did enjoy watching it.  If you're interested in seeing a decent knock off of Alien or The Thing it's a pretty solid choice.  Leviathan is goofy, and not particularly scary, but if you're someone who knows all the horror tropes you'll undoubtedly have a fun time with it.",1380412800,4,3592,4.734299516908212

A review of their ship's data reveals that the Soviets were working on a deadly new biological weapon, and one that has begun to infect everyone on board! Of the many films to follow in ALIEN's footprint, LEVIATHAN comes closest to replicating the same level of fear and paranoia... At least in the first act. The film features an impressive cast led by Peter Weller and Richard Crenna, and also includes incredible production designs for both the interior and exterior sets of the underwater mining facility. It is most unfortunate that things quickly begin to fall apart in the over-indulgent ending, where the lackluster creature effects and laughable surprises drag an otherwise enjoyable film back into the depths. Regardless, LEVIATHAN comes as a welcomed addition to other Science Fiction horrors like THE THING, DEEPSTAR SIX, and the ALIEN series.

Yes, it borrows heavily from a lot of different movies and doesn't necessarily do anything new with the procured items.  What it does do is make these bits and pieces work as a whole.  So what if the plot is mostly cut and paste?  The point is its entertaining.  It doesn't pretend to be art.  It's just a nice unassuming Sci-Fi flick with a cut and paste monster.....literally!  Yes, some of the characters/actors are annoying (Daniel Stern), and a lot of the camaraderie is forced for story sake.  Still, there's a lot to be said for what Peter Weller and Ernie Hudson accomplish, seemingly effortlessly, while Richard Crenna and Hector Elizondo lend an experienced air to round out the less than sterling cast.  I also have to add that I love Meg Foster's automaton executive giving encouragement to the crew, and ""whatever they decide to do.""  Once the monster runs amuck, things really begin to roll.  I also appreciated that they kept most of this movie brightly lit so we could see what was going on.  There's nothing worse than indistinguishable mayhem.

150315,3,0792839684,"""Alien"" was a ground breaking film. It seamlessly managed to combine science fiction and Gothic horror. It thrilled fans of the genre and has kept its reputation over the decades. It was so new at the time, of course, devotees wanted more. The studios were happy to oblige.

""Leviathan"" merely takes the plot of ""Alien"" and moves it under water. Mining is still at the core. A soulless corporation still puts profit before people. You know this because Meg Foster, one of the most inherently scary looking women on the planet, is one of the corporate uppity ups. It's still a small crew in a hostile environment but here they're mining silver as opposed to iron ore. The producers sprinkle in a bit of John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" in that this crew comes across the menace after it already caused the decimation of a Russian crew, and also that the creature assimilates each crew member it devours. Rick Baker happened to be the effects guy in both projects. Like ""Alien,"" ""Leviathan"" has a strong female lead. Here, though, Peter Weller shares the survivor credits with her. I like Weller enough but he never really builds up a fire. Here, even in the thick of it, he remains surprisingly calm.

This movie sports a strong cast who all do a decent enough job. It IS a shameless rip-off but it's still fun to watch. I suppose I should be surprised it took them ten years to come up with this.

The scenes in which everybody on board is in danger should give us thrills, but it fails. The entire movie should have been a classic sci-fi thriller, but it failed to become one. Why?

""Deep Star Six"" was the B-movie of the bunch, with low budget special effects and b-list actors like ""BJ and the Bear"" star Greg Evigan and pop music one-hit wonder Nia Peebles thrown in for eye candy. The great thing about ""Deep Star Six"" was that despite it's minimal budget, it packed a ton of action and suspense into it's 90 minute running time.

""Leviathan"" was it's big studio counerpart. The film had a bigger budget, a better cast led by ""Robocop"" star Peter Weller and Richard Crenna fresh off the set from the latest ""Rambo"" flick. The effects are handled by Academy Award winner Stan Winston. Basically all of the pieces are in place for a fun action/horror flick. But for some reason it just doesn't come together as well as it should.

The basic premise behind ""Leviathan"" is that a deep sea mining operation discovers a sunken Russian ship. After reviewing the Russain captain's video log to try and decipher what happened, strange things being to happen in the mining crew's underwater habitat. Could the same thing which caused the death of the Russian crew be happening to the miners?

I'm not sure why ""Leviathan"" fails where ""Deep Star Six"" succeeds? Maybe it's because, while the cast is good, they really aren't given much to work with here. You get the same basic stereotypes found in almost every horror film, and it feels like a retread of ""Alien"". To top it off, the ""monster"" just isn't very frightening. The molten collection of body parts just doesn't seem terribly mobile. The turgid creature does little to inspire fear, and you get the feeling that if the characters used any intelligence at all, they would simply walk quickly away from the beastie, and close the door behind them to eliminate a majority of the threat. No matter what the cause, ""Leviathan"" while enjoyable, seems like a pale imitation of ""Deep Star Six"", when it clearly should have been the other way round.",1248652800,,2111,4.743869209809264

The producers of this film knew a good model when they found it and obviously allowed the audience to laugh at their copycat ways by creating aliens that alternately look like tongues with teeth and moving intestines. There's also a paean to the real ""Alien"" near the end that Peter Weller does away with by squishing it's head in an elevator shaft.

And, in the final scene, you won't believe how hokey and stupid this kind of movie could be just a few years before the advent on high tech and high gloss computerization became de riguer in this type of thing. It's worth it to sit through the whole thing just to see that unbelievably dumb final scene.

Weller ""starred"" in this vehicle two years after his biggest hit, 1987's ""RoboCop"". This didn't do much for his reputation even though the cast included some great eye candy in Amanda Pays and the steely blue eyes of Meg Foster. A solid supporting cast headed by the great Richard Crenna, Ernie Hudson and Hector Elizondo offer a high level of acting credibility.

Still, they can't make sense of this mishmash which, oddly and fantastically, still works as horror. Leonard Maltin says to, ""Skip it"" on this one but I'd disagree. I think there's enough humor, whether intentional or unintentional, eye candy, schlock horror and fine acting to give you your money's worth. It didn't work as a big release in the theater but it's pretty good entertainment on a Tuesday night on your home system.",1163548800,42,1691,4.780821917808219
150383,3,0792839684,"Plot synapsis: Underwater mining rig, day 87 of a 90 day tour, goof-off sexist jerk wanders off and finds a sunken Russian freighter.

The cast consists of Peter Weller as the geologist boss, Richard Crenna as the semi-doctor and crewed by Ernie Hudson (who gets some of the best lines and steals his scenes), Amanda Pays (and her annoyingly fake accent) Daniel Stern, Michael Carmine, an adorable Lisa Eilbacher, Meg Foster (what IS it about her eyes? And why was she trying so hard to do a crappy acting job?), and the wonderful Hector Elizondo.

After ALIEN did the haunted house in space so successfully there were a lot of immitators. Then we had a few underwater adventures which did fairly well in a vauge sort of way.  Think of this as a cheap way of combining both. Except for Pays and Foster, we have a group of really fine actors working in an underwater mining facility.

Personal note: Seriously, if this had been real and I was Pays' charactor I would have severly hurt the Stern character. His behavior was borish to the point of distracting from the movie and something no decent boss would have allowed.

Anyway, the movie cover said the magic words: GENETIC MUTATION!  I was hooked, as always. Pays and Stern are outside doing their job when Stern wanders off (why?) and falls off a cliff. Movie goers probably cheered at that point. Pays goes after him, wandering through fakey looking sea worms and finds the Russian freighter. I liked the scary fish that pops up in Pays' face. Stern shows up with a huge safe, carrying it like it weighs 20 pounds instead of several hundred and they head back.

The safe contains a lot of 'personal effects' from deceased crewmembers which should have triggered a lot more concern than it did. Sterns character slips out a flask of vodka and hides it. Eilbacher's character sees him do it, and later talks him into sharing it with her. Because of the extreme danger of the job, alcohol is not permitted there.

Eventually the Crenna figures out the Russians were doing GENETIC EXPERIMENTATION (I love this stuff) on it's own crew by doctoring their vodka. By the time Crenna comes up with that of course, Stern and Eilbacher are already infected. It hits Stern first, and hardest, then things begin getting out of control.

Up to this point the movie does quite well. It's best effects were, unfortunately, the ones you don't see, using shadow and noise. As good as the cast mostly was, the sets, the production, etc., the special effects were really substandard. Or to put it another way, they were just cheesy and bad, a jarring note to an otherwise interesting movie.

There was not a lot of new material here, nothing terribly original, but it is still not bad. Flawed by it's special effects, surely, but some good acting and a decent script saves it from being a B movie.",1148688000,16,2832,4.657314629258517
150384,4,0792839684,"ok this is like so many other sci-fi movies of the 80's(and the second of three underwater action movies that year)that you always feel like you have seen it before. the story is about miners on the ocean floor who find a sunken russian ship near them. after checking it out the find a video tape and a flask of booze.as two crew members drink from it they get very sick,and why not ,it has a drug that changes you into a blood craveing monster.

  not the greatest,but i had fun watching it and if gore and f/x's are your thing you'll love it.",1146787200,,544,4.211538461538462
150385,5,0792839684,"Leviathan was one of two ""what lies beneath the sea"" flicks in the 80's.  The other was Deep Star Six which had a more attractive cast, but the story was lacking.  Leviathan was pulled together by a great cast and a decent story.

I remember renting it several times when I was much younger and still enjoy watching it today.  I recommend it for fans of what happens when Russians add DNA altering substances to their already awesome vodka.",1142208000,3,440,4.531645569620253
150386,3,0792839684,leviathan is one of a wave(no pun intended) of underwater action movies that came out in the late 80's and while another alien rip-pff this is ok if you get into it. miners on the ocean floor find a sunken russian ship and it's safe. in that they find a flask of wiskey and drink from it. what they don't know it is some drug that changes you into a creature of some kind. not great but you may enjoy it in right frame of mind,1139270400,,426,3.9651162790697674
150387,3,0792839684,"I was watching tv not too long ago when my local UPN station decided to air an '80s relic ""Leviathan"". I almost forgot just how cheesy this film was. As a teenager, this was one of my favorite guilty pleasures. Even as a teen, I knew right away that this film was an Aliens gone underwater film with bad special effects. When I saw this film tonight, it was so badly dated and just so unintentionally funny.

The premise of the film has Robocop's Peter Weller leading a ragtag team of scientists at the bottom of the ocean. This alone just had ""Alien"" rip-off written all over it. And if you noticed the similiarities in the characters, you really know that the people behind this movie watched ""Alien"" way too many time. The crew discovers an old sunken Russian ship. They decided to bring up a safe from the ship. Inside the safe is an unfinished bottle of vodka which some of the crew makes the mistake of consuming. The results is this horrible-looking alien terrorizing the remaining crew mates.

I don't know what made this film horrendous is the acting, the writing, or the premise of the film. This Alien gone underwater plot was really lame. The special effects is even worse. Nevertheless ""Leviathan"" is still good for a few unintentional laughs. Yeah it is stupid but it is unintentionally funny with the bad acting and the blatant rip-off of a classic horror/sci-fi film like ""Alien"".",1125619200,2,1396,4.647773279352227
150388,3,0792839684,"Shack 7 is an underwater base manned by 8 men and a woman who have been submerged on a mining mission for 2 whole months .With barely a day or so remaining of their mission they discover a sunken Russian naval vessel ,Leviathan .Searching the ship's log they find its whole crew died of a mysterious disease before ithe ship  was scuppered by the crew .They discover vodka among the crew's affects and the company of Shack 7 look forward to a party until their leader Breck (Peter Weller ) sticking to the rule book ,confiscates the alcohol but not before one crew member , Six Pack ( Daniel Stern )manages to pocket a hip flask and organises a private party with Bowman ( Lisa Eilbacher).

Big mistake ! the  Russians had been experimenting with genetic mutations and the booze is the medium they used to carry a virus which changes people into monsters .

When Six Pack dies his body changes into something reptilian and before you know it he's alive again ,and the same fate befalls Bowman .The dead are evolving into something else and from here on in its a pitched battle between the remaining crew of Shack 7 and the constantly evolving and mutating monster .The monster is constantly evolving and changing, absorbing the memories of its victims and genetically fusing the faces of the victims with its own body .

Leviathan was compared with other underwater chillers like The Abyss but its true source is Alien with its crew versus monster scenario ,and there is even a monster in the stomach scene .As such there is little new about the picture and it is a rehash of ideas done better elsewhere .

Take it as a well shot and decently acted creature feature however and this is a solid little picture with some decent effects and well worth watching for these alone .Provided you do not set a premium on originality this is enjoyable escapist movie making",1111363200,3,1863,4.596385542168675
150389,3,0792839684,"Since the first two Alien films, there have been countless big budget and low budget thrillers that take the formula of the previously mentioned films and make it so contrived that there is hardly a shred of originality left in the idea.  Leviathan is close to being an example of this, and while it's hardly original in it's plot, the cast, effects, and set designs help it stand above other derivative drivel like Deep Star Six and other Alien rip off's to come out of the 80's.  Peter Weller, Ernie Hudson, the late Richard Crenna, and Daniel Stern are among the crew members of a salvage crew who find a submerged Russian ship.  After Stern's character treats himself to some vodka found on board, he is transmutated into a slimy and hungry creature that is soon picking the crew off one by one.  Not original in the least, but it has enough going for it to keep it from going overboard into complete absurdity.",1110067200,10,915,4.560975609756097
150390,4,0792839684,Leviathan unlike the Abyss was one of numerous underwater thrillers that had good special effects but needed more work on the script. Peter Weller played a good part but should've stuck to playing Robocop and Richard Crenna who played Doc has never been the same since First Blood in 1982. But all in all A great film.,1010620800,,318,4.5964912280701755
150391,2,0792839684,"This is a special effects movie from 1989. Considering its age, the special effects hold up very well. However that can not be said about the plot of this movie. There first half of the movie starts slowly and it attempts to build supsense until the monster arives. Unfortunately the monster itself is so preposterous that its arrival only brings a major let down in the plot. The extended chase sequence is straight out of 'Alien' but holds none of the emotional tension that 'Alien' succeeds in providing.
This is a movie that tried to replicate the success of 'Alien'. It is really just 'Alien' placed underwater with none of its suspense.",992044800,2,642,4.741071428571429
