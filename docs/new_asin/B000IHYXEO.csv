8145596,3,B000IHYXEO,"These newsreels histories are okay but all suffer from the same flaws.  The introduction is useless (Nazi Germany 101) and time-consuming, and pointless; obviously anybody buying original newsreel footage from Nazi Germany already knows who Hitler was.  They would have been better served to tell us something about the propaganda companies and how the newsreels were actually produced and shown (this information is completely lacking).  The film transfers are not great, varying from poor to good.  The English translation is laughable, as is often the case the producers seem to feel they have to choose between somebody who speaks German and somebody who knows a little about WW2, but cannot have both.  I rate it as highly as I have because it is a full set for a very reasonable price.",1443312000,,791,5.00763358778626

8145599,4,B000IHYXEO,"Vol. 5, 1941 Part 1. The soundtrack is annoying with its overwhelming loud band music. The English voice track overdubbing is awful; set the audio to the German language with English subtitles, and fast forward through the first several minutes of English language harangue to the first title screen (Part 1: 1941).

We see Dr. Ferdinand Porsche, acknowledged here as the inventor of the Volkswagen, receiving an award. We see 8-wheeled armored cars, PzKw III tanks, and VW Kubelwagens of the Afrika Corps, all on their way to the British garrison at Tobruk, passing abandoned British tanks and Spitfire airplanes, and a shot up Chevrolet truck. And hundreds of captured British and other Allied soldiers.

We do not see anything like this in Hollywood films on WW2. Hitler visits southeastern Austria (Styria) in an open car, passing within a few feet of many hundreds of people in the crowd, under more hundreds leaning out of windows of buildings bordering the street. The Luftwaffe assists the Navy in sinking British shipping. We see 4-engine bombers sinking Allied shipping. Do not believe that Germany had no 4-engine bombers! You can see them here.

The film claims that the Germans sank over 11 million tonnes of British shipping, and you will see a lot of that going down into the ocean in this film. It looks really bad for the British. We see lengthy footage of Generals Rommel and Garibaldi on their way to Tobruk. Many shots of German motorcycles and armored cars. And some odd Italian armored vehicles that look like WWI tanks.

The program ends with the invasions of Yugoslavia and Greece. The images near the end in Athens are striking. We see the German troops driving through the streets. Hundreds or thousands of people are watching them. Suddenly a woman runs to a vehicle full of soldiers and throws something in. Turns out to be a bouquet of flowers.

Occasional sublime music from Beethoven or Wagner amidst the forgettable band marches.",1368576000,,1961,4.912386706948641
8145600,5,B000IHYXEO,"If you are a nut over real history and real film footage of WWII, then this series is the way to go.  Yes, it was made for the German audience in the German theaters at the time. Because of that, there is some propaganda lines and phrases used by the narrator.  If you listen in German, this will not matter anyway.  Obviously, all of this film is from the German side of the war, what we Americans have seen very little, over the last 60 years.  It is all very interesting and takes you way back in history to the days of 1939 to 1945 in Europe and Russia.",1319155200,,557,4.08256880733945
8145601,4,B000IHYXEO,"To begin with, a caveat emptor for this and every other title in this series (save the first episode, which is pretty much a waste of time)---if you dislike having to read subtitles while you listen to a German-language soundtrack, don't bother buying this. The English-language soundtrack consists of a British narrator reading the subtitles and trying to sound like he thinks an English-speaking Propaganda Ministry announcer would sound; it's really bad and gets old after a minute. Sir Laurence Olivier this guy is not! You're much better off reading the subtitles and listening to it auf Deutsch, even if you don't understand German.  As has been pointed out elsewhere though, the subtitles are sometimes wildly off-base (you would think the makers of this series would've spent the money to get a professional translation done), so care needs to be taken with what you read as well.  Furthermore, the Germans made good use of sound in their newsreel footage---if they didn't have weapons firing, machines humming or boots marching there's a lot of music filling the sound between the German narration. If you listen to the English soundtrack to this episode, all of the sound is mixed down and the English narration laid atop it and the effect is completely lost.

Also, Part One of every episode except the first is a five-minute history of Hitler and the rise of the Nazis using a lot of still shots; there's nothing in it you don't already know if you're not a novice on twentieth-century Germany.

Volume One (Early Years to 1935):
This is easily the worst of the 20 episodes in this series; to begin with, it doesn't contain any newsreel footage as the name implies, and by ""early years"" it goes back to 1914. The first sections of this episode consist of footage of World War I with some sound dubbed in and a very boring and superficial commentary by the narrator of this series. We then get large chunks of a post-WW II documentary on the Nazis to explain the chaos of Weimar Germany and what led to Hitler's seizure of power. We then progress to edited sections of ""Triumph of the Will,"" and that's basically it. Even the edits from the latter film were chosen badly, as they could've selected some of those that showed the brutal force that lay at the heart of Nazism but didn't (the marchpast of the SS in Nuremberg at the end of the film, for example). I would only get this episode if you were buying this set of the first five episodes, it's not worth getting on its own.

Volume Two (1936-1939):
This episode features varied topics depicting the prewar Third Reich. It even includes several minutes of color footage (the only in this series) that was made of life in Berlin as an enticement to prospective foreign visitors for the 1936 Olympics. There's a lot of coverage of the Olympics, including the opening ceremonies, high-diving and track and field, taken from Leni Riefenstahl's 1938 film. The Party Rally in Nuremberg in '36 is shown, as is coverage of Mussolini's visit to Germany the following year.  The Anschluss of Austria in '38 is covered, and there's some footage of the mammoth military parade for Hitler's 50th birthday in April 1939.

The episode takes a darker turn when Hitler gives his New Year's 1939 speech before the Reichstag in Berlin, threatening the destruction of Europe's Jews should another war take place. This episode then depicts the Polish Army in menacing tones, and then the war begins, with Hitler announcing the opening of the war to the Reichstag and combat footage of the Polish campaign is included, culminating in the fall of Warsaw.

The film footage varies in quality, with that of the Rhineland reoccupation in 1936 looking decidedly second-generation and the color footage from the next year of very good quality. None of it is in HD quality, unfortunately.  If you've seen the first two episodes of the BBC's ""World At War"" you'll recognize much of the latter part of this episode---unfortunately, the footage on this disc doesn't have the clarity and quality the BBC included in their program. Still, it's a worthwhile episode to have and recommended to anyone interested.

Volume Three (1940 Part One):
Most of Part Two of this episode consists of edited pieces from the 1941 documentary ""Sieg Im Westen"" (Victory In The West). There's a brief bit at the beginning of Part Two of this episode on the takeovers of Denmark and Norway, and at the end we get some footage of Hitler's return to Berlin in July 1940 with flower-strewn streets and Heil Hitler ad infinitum. Since ""Sieg Im Westen"" was made under the auspices of the German Army High Command, the contributions of the Luftwaffe were given pretty short shrift, and the same holds true for this episode. There isn't as much on the Panzers storming across France as you might expect either, since ""Sieg Im Westen"" has a bias towards the traditional arms of the German Army, the infantry and artillery. The film quality is also noticeably uneven.

If you're interested in the April-June 1940 period of German military history and don't want to spend the money on ""Sieg Im Westen"" then this DVD is worth buying as part of this set of the first five episodes.  Alone, I wouldn't buy this episode but would suggest you skip this and buy ""Westen"" instead.

Volume Four (1940 Part Two):
This episode has a pretty wide mix of subjects, beginning with the Wehrmacht's victory parade in Berlin after the fall of France. There's some coverage of the Battle of Britain, but it doesn't give one the feeling that that contest was as epochal as it really was, which is to be expected since it was the first defeat Hitler experienced. You see more non-combat footage in this episode than you might expect, but after all, the German Army was taking a breather and only the Navy and Luftwaffe were in action.  The Reich Labor Service is shown hard at work in occupied Poland (the district of Wartheland is spelled in the subtitles as Wasteland!), you witness the embryo stage of the building of the Atlantic Wall, and there are parades and more parades. There's also footage from Italy's pathetic offensives in southern France and Egypt, the German Navy in action, and some of Europe's neutral states, such as Hungary, Bulgaria and Spain (although the subtitles destroy the name of Franco's Foreign Minister Serrano Suner not once but twice). Of the first four episodes of this series, this is easily the best and most varied, and heartily recommended.

Volume Five (1941 Part One):
This episode contains only a little non-combat footage or stuff from the home front; what there is begins Part Two with Hitler speaking to the Reichstag in January 1941 celebrating eight years of his rule. There's also a very ironic segment showing Rudolf Hess dispensing honors upon the Messerschmitt works in Bavaria with a Bf-110 as a backdrop; very soon thereafter Hess flew a 110 to Britain in a misguided attempt to get the British to come to terms with Hitler, whereupon he was labeled a lunatic by Hitler and Goebbels and vanished from the official German conciousness. The Afrika Korps make their debut in German newsreels in this episode---there's an obvious delight in showing their prowess, and they appear more than once (their Italian allies, who needed them to save their bacon, are virtually invisible). Hitler makes the last of his triumphal parades in this episode, shown in motorcades in southern Austria and then in northern Slovenia, greeting throngs in his Mercedes in Marburg (present-day Maribor). The Navy and Luftwaffe are shown in action against the British as well.

Much of the second half of Part Two of this episode consists of the Balkan campaign, including the conquest of Greece. Like the other episodes in this series, it is unfortunately marred by errors in the subtitles (reference to the Siberian campaign, for example, when Serbia is meant). The final segment of this episode covers the assault on Crete, and it even features the Luftwaffe going into action with Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" as the background music (Francis Ford Coppola, were you taking notes?). Again, the slipshod effort on the subtitles is shown when you read ""Stukas prepare to drop paratroopers."" This was Nazi Germany at its zenith in many ways---the British driven off the Continent, the U-Boat offensive raising steam in the Atlantic, the Reich and the USSR all buddy-buddy, but it would all begin to go downhill very soon. This episode ranks with the fourth in the series as the best up to this point, and if you can overlook its faults, it's highly recommended.",1304208000,8,8575,4.8469945355191255

8145603,3,B000IHYXEO,"I teach college-level German history, and have over time purchased all 20 DVDs in this series.  It's good to see that they are being offered in this more compact format.

The translations in the subtitles, unfortunately, are sometimes only approximate.  While they are mostly reliable, I did notice too many needless little errors which should have been caught.

* ""Marine"" for example, is often translated as ""marines"", when it should be ""naval"".  ""Verbrecher"" is ""criminal"" and not ""traitor"".  (Consequently, instead of being described as ""criminal"", British forces are described in the subtitles as ""traitorous"", which makes no sense at all.)

* The subtitles often refer to ""Balkan"", when clearly ""Baltic"" is meant.

* Germans in 1940 are engaged in reconstruction in a conquered Polish region known as the ""Warteland"", but in the subtitles it is referred to as the ""Wasteland"".  (This error, I'm sure was due to someone with good intentions correcting the copy without any knowledge of geography.)

* On another occasion the subtitles talk about ""Russian allies"" [!!!], while the German announcer talks about ""Rumanians"".

* D-Day invading troops are referred to as ""Scottish"", when in fact the film clearly depicts Canadians.  The translator heard something about Nova Scotia (""Neuschottland""), and carelessly wrote down ""Scottish"", instead.

* ""Estonian population"" (estnisch) is subtitled as ""ethnic minorities"" (ethnisch).  A small slip, perhaps - but the newsreel was showing evacuation scenes from Estonia, where Estonians are not a minority.

Goebbels talks of fighting on reel 19 ""to the last breath"", but the subtitles say ""to the bitter end"".  (Goebbels - the propaganda minister - is talking here about bravery, NOT about defeat, and the mistranslation misconveys his intent completely.)

The biggest howler, I think, refers to the Volkssturm in volume 19, which the announcers say is accepting everyone ""regardless of social status [""Stand"" in German] or class"".  The subtitles translate that as ""regardless of race [!!!] or class"".  ""Regardless of race""?  The Nazis?  Seriously, was anyone proofreading?

There are points where the subtitles merely summarize the audio, missing some interesting details which only German-speakers will catch.  Sometimes, though, meanings are missed.  Inexplicably, ""Bolshevik"" is translated throughout as ""Russian"" - not the same at all, and it matters very much that the newsreels refer to Soviet troops as Bolsheviks.  Mostly, the subtitles work, but the numerous errors should make any viewer cautious.

It would also have been helpful to date the newsreels more specifically, instead of simply listing them as in, say, ""1941, Part 4"".  Knowing exactly when in the year certain newsreels might have been shown to German audiences would be useful.  (One particular segment, on submarines in the Indian Ocean, is shown on BOTH disks 16 and 17.  Someone wasn't paying attention in the editing room!  So - is this footage from 1943 or 1944?)

The titling could use work.  One on ""Hitler's Tenth Anniversary"" has perhaps two minutes on the subject (out of 90), for example.  The chapter titles on each disk often don't usefully convey the chapter's content.

There are some omissions that definitely deserve explanation, too.  Why is there NO mention of Stalingrad on the 1943 newsreels, or of the American declaration of war in the late 1941 or early 1942 reels, for example?  Were these 21st-century editing decisions, or missing newsreels, or (much harder to believe!) the newsreels never mentioned these events, despite how much coverage they received in radio and the press?  Even just a little explanation of something like this would go a long way.

So: if you are watching them privately, caveat emptor.  If you are a teacher who can point out the errors, the series has potential for classroom use, if you are doing a course on World War II or the Third Reich, or on propaganda and communication.  Overall, this series could have been made much more reliable and useful, with less hurried translating and editing, and with more documentation.",1253059200,29,4100,5.257318952234207
