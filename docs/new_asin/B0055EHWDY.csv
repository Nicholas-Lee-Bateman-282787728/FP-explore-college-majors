4576035,5,B0055EHWDY,"My name is Jeffrey Griffith and I was the Director of Photography on Richards later film ""Sister Aimee"". At the time Richard was interested in interviewing several people who actually knew Aimee, Specifically Roberta Salter Aimee's daughter, Gemma Wenger, Billy Adams, Secretary Leita Mae Steward, and Neil McClaflin, I Think those are correct spellings of their names. These people give us a sense of who Aimee was and makes for us an historical reference that would not exist were it not for Richards' diligence and perseverance. The way the documentary is presented was meant to remind us of the 20s style music and is an artistic choice that perhaps others would not make but which none the less gives a sense of the era in which those people lived and thrived. After seeing his documentary I was inspired to begin my own film career and my first actual work on film was ""Sister Aimee"". I consider myself lucky to have been able to work on that project. I believe that our finished product has made a difference in peoples lives and that all started with ""Saving Sister Aimee"".",1309824000,7,1081,4.75531914893617
4576036,5,B0055EHWDY,"As the director of this film, I wanted to share that I was offered money to make a big budget film on Sister Aimee by rigid religious Aimee adherents and loyalists who wanted me to remove from this documentary as well as my later dramatic feature film ""Sister Aimee; The Aimee Semple McPherson Story"" (also on Amazon) anything that could be construed as negative: her overdose, breakdown, three marriages, and morals trial. I took a class in the history of the Foursquare Church through Aimee's LIFE Bible College and was stunned that her trials and many of the headline stories about her were ignored completely.  I couldn't live with myself if I made a propaganda piece. Jesus said the truth shall set us free, so I decided to turn down millions of dollars and make a truthful portrayal that Sister Aimee was a conduit for the Spirit, but also a very human person. We shot both ""Saving Sister Aimee"" and ""Sister Aimee;The Aimee Semple McPherson Story"" on a micro-budget of a few thousand dollars, but this brought out creativity in us. Thank you to all of you who purchased the film and have supported us. This was the first film I efver made and we finished it despite overwhelming odds, my paying the price of pouring all my time, money, and energy into finishing the film, & some powerful people threatening me if I finished & exhibited the film.  I was humbled that this movie was in the Academy Award competition for Best Short Documentary.  I believe in our film & in our fans. I loved the opportunity to meet and interview Sister Aimee's daughter and close compatriots for this film.  My editor Jaime Prater did an amazing job assembling this documentary so I vote five stars out of five *****.

4576052,1,B0055EHWDY,"I was hoping for an even treatment of the subject matter.  What this DVD presents is very one-sided testimony from some folks who are quite biased in a very favorable fashion towards 4 Square and its founder, Aimee Semple McPherson.  In addition, the few scenes of her preaching are overdubbed with audio that does not match what her lips are saying, although some recordings of her are played, but they seem rather disjointed with respect to the subject at hand - if indeed ""subject at hand"" is a phrase that can be used because, for the full 40 minutes of this DVD, I had very little idead what they were trying to convey.  The entire DVD was put together poorly with jarring transitions and little thematic development, unless psychopathic praise can be called ""thematic development"".  It seemed as if it was a rebuttal to information I do not yet possess rather than a documentary of any kind.  The interspersing of 1920's silent movie style paragraphs was laughable in this day and age when great movies can be made on your home computer.  Seriously, this looked like it was thrown together like a salad, tossed about, and then burned to DVD.  Another serious flaw is that there is a soundtrack behind some of the interviews.  I won't call it musical because it sounds like a tone-deaf nauseous frog playing a badly out-of-tune piano.  It set my teeth on edge, and it kept going away and coming back.  In short, I hope someday to find a good documentary on this topic, but this one fails in every way I can imagine.  Do not buy it, not even as a gag gift.  I'd give it zero stars if there was a way to do that.",1360713600,,1615,4.493150684931507
4576053,3,B0055EHWDY,The condition of the film was below average and the content did not say a lot about Aimee McPherson. It was more about the history of the temple and those that fought to retain its original architecture/purpose.,1359936000,,211,4.72972972972973

4576055,1,B0055EHWDY,"This video says nothing new.

If you want to read about Aimee (and decide for yourself) about her, you can read a self published book circa 1927 or there about, by a Methodist pastor named Bob Shuler who lived in LA at the same time as Aimee . Aimee's followers said other pastors were envious (same as Aimee's daughter said in this documentary). That's probably very true, perhaps many were, but definitely not all. You can read Bob's book by doing the following:

your local library will get this book for you, they did for me a few months ago. Ask the librarian to do an INTER-LIBRARY TRANSFER for the following book title (they charged me $1 and it took 2 weeks):

""McPhersonism"": Containing Summary of Facts as to the Disappearance and Re-appearance of Aimee McPherson

Tell the librarian it has no copyright but is circa 1927

I've read everything I could get my eyes on for the past four years, regarding Pentecostalism, the Charismatic movement, Reformed, their founder(s), history, etc and this book (which very few seem to know exists) is the best regarding a biblically based assessment of Aimee McPherson's ministry, doctrine and controversies.

In Matthew 24, not once or twice but FOUR times in that one sharing, Jesus says to be careful you are not deceived (verses 4,5,11,24).",1354752000,,1292,4.823529411764706
4576056,1,B0055EHWDY,"Aimee Semple McPherson is a complex person. She did many fine things, but there were inconsistencies in her personal life that cause many to doubt her as a genuine servant of God. I for one am undecided and do not intend to judge, but rather look at the facts. Aimee Semple McPherson and her daughter were not on speaking terms during the years before she died. Shortly before her death a few years ago, McPherson's daughter stepped forward and told her side of the story, which is not flattering. I thought that was what I was buying. Instead I got a very dull 30 minute documentary. If you are looking for information about the life of Aimee Semple McPherson this is not the place to get it. In short--I've been robbed.",1352592000,4,721,4.511450381679389
4576057,1,B0055EHWDY,"I am unable to understand what the filmmakers were attempting to convey in this very strange, disjointed, pointless documentary.  Anyone without extensive background knowledge of the history of Angelus Temple, and the Foursquare movement, will have no idea how to find a cohesive point within this film. Even armed with the aforementioned history, I'm not sure what the interviews are intended to do.

In between poignant, interesting commentary by Roberta Salter, and a few others who actually knew Aimee Semple McPherson, are clips of a contemporary woman ""faith-healer"", named Gemma Somebody, who is remarkably self-centered, and hadn't even heard of McPherson until recently.  My guess is that the filmmakers were attempting to expose this bland, shallow, somewhat ridiculous ""ministry"" that claims inheritance to Aimee's mission, and to hint that other current ""heirs"" are equally unworthy.

There are additional random clips, of gentlemen who were born ""into"" McPherson's church, married by McPherson, etc.  These men seem to be lovely people, and their devotion to their denomination's founder is evident. At the unusually massive (by California standards) monument over McPherson's grave at Forest Lawn, one of these men laments the removal of statues of angels from the monument, stating this was because the angels were deemed ""inappropriate"".  To whom they were ""inappropriate"", or why they were considered so, is never explained.

The contrast between the rantings of the dull, self-delusional Gemma Who-ever-she-is, and the magnetic, vibrant recordings of sermons by Aimee McPherson, is stunning.  This doesn't prove whether McPherson was ""guilty"" or not of being a duplicitous liar, of course.

The footage of Roberta Salter, McPherson's daughter, is absolutely horrible.  Her face is shown at an angle, either shadowed, or with light glaring off her glasses, so her eyes can't be seen.  The tinny piano accompaniment throughout the documentary is full of glaring mistakes, and the piano itself is terribly out of tune.  If this cacaphony is meant to cause viewers to sympathize with the architectural preservationists, it fails miserably.  Salter maintains McPherson's innocence in covering-up a month-long disappearance in 1926 with a concocted story of being kidnaped, (rather than admitting to indulging in activities that would be condemned by a court of ignorant public opinion). This is hardly surprising. What kind of person would turn on her own mother, 60+ years after her tragic death? And if Salter had revealed some unsavory information, would thousands of Foursquare churches suddenly cease to exist? Would all of McPherson's undeniable accomplishments through compassion and grace fail to have changed America's religious history?

There is no footage shown of the interior of Angelus Temple.  The interviewees occasionally refer to revisions of the decor of the sanctuary at Angelus Temple, but the seemingly sordid details of the impending changes are never revealed. The spokesperson for the National Register of Historic Places is clearly upset by proposed changes, but he never elaborates on what it is he's trying to preserve. Instead, we hear vague statements about plans to ""lower"" the dome, and to replace the proscenium and mural with ""huge video screens.""

The ""angels'"" temple had been decorated predominantly, (and thematically), with bells and...angels. Above a dramatic proscenium, a 40 feet long mural painting depicted, ""Jesus Christ accompanied by the hosts of heaven with their long, slender trumpets. Jesus appears in the center with outstretched hands."" (from Aimee: The Life Story of Aimee Semple McPherson by Aimee Semple McPherson). I have never seen the original interior, but I've heard wistful tales. As a lover of architecture and history, I would have liked to see the sanctuary before it was remodeled. However, I understand that the mural, etc. which were produced with good intentions and lots of flair, may not appeal to current seekers.

The sanctuary has indeed been ""modernized"" and the ornate ostentation of the original theme has been replaced with the feared ""multi-media"" objects.  The negativity toward this is presented entirely from points of view emphasizing either nostalgia, or a zealous desire to preserve historcial American architecture. The filmmakers juxtapose the issue of remodeling an unused, albeit historical, sanctuary with stories from the last known living family and friends defending the honor of Aimee Semple McPherson.  It's as though the sanctuary remodeling is a direct result of bad press in 1926, in spite of the fact that the temple, at the time of the interviews, was crumbling to the ground.

Maybe I'm wrong, but if Aimee Semple McPherson was half of the person she seemed to be, I believe she'd been reeling in delight if she could see the church she built as it functions today.  It's not as fancy, or flashy, but,she herself claimed that the ostentation was there for a reason: to bring in people.  The mural was there for a reason:  to comfort people. The cathedrals and basilicas of history rarely function much beyond being tourist attractions. Had ""multi-media"" been available to her, McPherson would, undoubtedly, have been designing websites, tweeting, blogging, and probably even programming media, with all the cleverness and zeal she put forth in all her illustrated sermons. I think she'd be filled with joy and delight if she could know the church she put her whole life into building, is, once again, a vibrant center of worship; that it's the church of the Dream Center. The revitalization of community in Echo Park (and all around the world), is due in part to the inexhaustible determination of Matthew Barnett, the current Senior Pastor at Angelus Temple. Lack of gilded seraphim embellishing the walls aside, Barnett has ""done Aimee proud"" through incredible outreach and ministry during some of the most difficult times America has seen (i.e. Hurricane Katrina).  With over 7,000 members, Angelus Temple is, once again, home to a growing congregation of people who need compassion, love, and a reason to live.

Depicting the refurbishing of Angelus Temple as some sort of sinister plot devised by rival evangelists is unfair. Insinuating that these ""rivals"" somehow tried to keep this nonsensical documentary censored is a rather pathetic attempt at a sales tactic.  This documentary is not about ""saving"" Sister Aimee. It's really about smearing the people attempting to keep Angelus Temple a vital part of people's lives, instead of preserving the building as a musuem; a curiosity.",1339113600,,6605,5.351351351351352
