7712120,5,B01DGN469I,"Wonderful collection of funny frog duo that bring back childhood memories. As others have mentioned, the frogs are Mexican which means it's only a matter of time before some lefty snowflake starts complaining about how racist it is and gets it banned. Get it while it's still available.",1473379200,5,286,4.979166666666667

7712124,5,B01DGN469I,"iHola, amigos! There's a big difference between being racist and stereotypical; racism involves recent church and cop shootings or massacres, and being stereotypical was the norm for theatrical shorts (or movies as recent as Zootopia, Disney's 55th animated feature), even in the 1970's with the Tijuana Toads, by lovingly poking fun at lazy Mexicans, in a similar manner to the WB's Mexicali Crows, Manuel and Jose, who'd also be seen as other animals and even people in other shorts! With DePatie-Freleng's Tijuana Toads, Don Diamond and Tom Holland reused their Jose and Manuel voices on the ""tontos"" (fools, or goofballs, in Spanish) El Toro and Pancho (renamed for TV as Fatso and Banjo, the Texas Toads), to hilarious effect in all 17 of their original unedited shorts, in this DVD & Blu-ray collection! There's a whole bunch of bonuses in this set; 2 documentaries that would also be in Roland and Rattfink's set, featuring even more history behind DePatie-Freleng, a bunch of commentaries by renowned toon historians like Jerry Beck, Mark Arnold, Greg Ford, and others, and an extra bonus of the short Go For Croak with its Texas Toads soundtrack for TV! All 17 shorts are unedited here, with no laugh tracks at all, and are in their original Fullscreen format! This series contained the debut of not one, but 2 other Pink Panther affiliates that would end up with their own series of shorts; those being CrazyLegs Crane and the Blue Racer, the little but speedy blue snake! The latter star's shorts have yet to be on DVD & Blu-ray, as of summer 2016! See you next time, amigos; time for a muy grande siesta (very big nap, in Spanish)!",1471478400,8,1643,4.829787234042553
