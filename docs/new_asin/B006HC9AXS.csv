8498293,5,B006HC9AXS,I have always loved Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony. It is a very beautiful symphony and Conductor Leinsdorf and the Boston Symphony Orchestra do it justice in all the movements. The Fourth movement is an especially moving piece in that the brass definitely are highlighted in the climax part of this piece. Beethoven's Egmont Overture is well done even though it is not as well known as the Tchaikovsky piece.,1449964800,,407,5.0
8498294,5,B006HC9AXS,As expected. Surprising performance from a non Russian Conductor and Symphony Orchestra. I will continue adding to my DVD collection.,1389916800,,133,5.7
8498295,3,B006HC9AXS,"The DVD contains standard performances of the minuet from the Posthorn serenade and Beethoven's Egmont overture.  If not for some miscalculations by Erich Leinsdorf, a very good conductor, this might have been definitive.  The slow movement is about average.  The waltz movement is good.  The outer movements sink this performance.  The finale is supremely exciting , but, until the coda, is played much too quickly.  Instead of a bracing sense of drama that launches into fire at the coda, the overall tempo ruins the effect of the coda (played at 100 instead of Tchaikovsky's 96).  Too bad.  The coda itself was magical.  The first movement was almost perfectly gauged and would have been definitive if not for the second subject.  Where Tchaikovsky asks for am almost imperceptible drop in tempo (handled ably by Markevitch and Cantelli), Leinsdorf drops the tempo from Tchaikovsky's 92 - all the way down to 60, ruining the dramatic affect.  After all this time, only Cantelli/NBC gets the entire symphony mostly right.  I am still awaiting a performance that fill follow Tchaikovsky completely.  The total timing of this performance is about 41 minutes, but exciting is not necessarily definitive -and this performance overall is only fair - for the reasons I have mentioned.",1373932800,3,1280,5.125603864734299
8498296,5,B006HC9AXS,"I received my copy from the UK last week, and I have been totally unable to get this performance of the Tchaikovsky 5th Symphony out of my head since. Oh just how on earth a performance of such calibre should go completely unnoticed, only to remain still and locked away for over four decades!?? I am really not able to contribute much of my my own review, since Mr. Christmas could not have expressed things any more on the money. Indeed, as Mr. Christmas states, this is the kind of performance that goes beyond the category of legendary. I have known and loved this Symphony for over fifty years, but last weeks viewing was like falling in love with the Tchaikovsky 5th for the very first time. From first bar to last, Leinsdorf leaves you under this mysterious, indescribable hypnotic spell - the electricity generated will leave one totally spellbound and mesmorized from beginning to end. And yet, not for one second does anything go over the top. Indeed again, as Mr. Christmas states, this is a performance which must be experinced by all who know and love this timeless war horse. I will probably not be returning to any of my CD's or LP's of the 5th for quite some time.",1329436800,4,1180,4.570754716981132
8498297,5,B006HC9AXS,"This positively stunning DVD is now available in Europe, and will hit US shores on Feb. 24. More detailed words I will probably disclose upon its domestic release, but for now, what we have here
is absolutely, positively the most ASTOUNDING Tchaikovsky 5th ever to have been issued to the public. This 1969 Erich Leinsdorf / Boston Symphony televised performance (in gorgeous color) has been most sadly locked away in the BSO + WGBH vaults since the early 1970's, neither to be seen nor heard in nearly 42 years. I urge anyone who enjoys this old war horse to reserve their copy now!!! This is a performance which goes beyond the category of legendary. It will be like hearing the work with a blazing vitality never yet experienced, yet all sounds so perfectly right. Though the commercially recorded performances by the likes of Szell, Mravinsky, and Paul Van Kempen do have their individual merits, no recorded performance has ever totally done it for me (all a direct result of my being totally blown away at the age of 12 when this Leinsdorf/BSO telecast first aired.) The experience has been a literal part of me since, and oh yes, the Beethoven ""Egmont"" Overture which opens this DVD (from the same 4/15/1969 concert) also abalzes with fire. It was interesting to read in Richard Dyer's liner notes that Leinsdorf allowed most of his principal players to rest for the first half of the concert, in order to keep them all fully rested for the demands of this truly astonishing Tchaik. 5. It's final glorious two and a quarter minutes can currently be viewed on youtube by simply keying in ""Leinsdorf Tchaikovsky 5"" in the youtube search engine. If you witness carefully, one of the first trombones could not have turned any more red in the face. We do see and hear more of the loud applause and curtain calls in the DVD, and it is obvious to everyone in Symphony Hall that the Tchaikovsky was just nailed!! Leinsdorf, the entire BSO, and all  standing from their seats glow with genuine heart felt delight and appreciation. It was rare to witness Erich Leinsdorf smile during his seven year (and often turbulent) tenure with the BSO. He does so here and even blows appreciative kisses to his orchestra, which he was to leave following the 1969 Tanglewood season. The minuet from Mozart's ""Posthorn"" Serenade, circa 1963 black and white from Harvard's Sanders Theatre, concludes the DVD.",1328832000,6,2391,4.803398058252427
