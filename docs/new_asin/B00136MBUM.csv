3102581,3,B00136MBUM,"This is an unresolved story and that will leave many unsatisfied if you like neatly tied up endings.

I think the movie tries to contrast the seperate worlds of different cultures and human responses to events, There are many emotional struggles going on among the characters, and that elicits a range of feelings in the viewer;  that's good.

However, some of the scenes indeed make little sense or even seem ""wrong"" or ""unbelievable"" such as Paul, holding a shotgun in one hand  up against an old man and having established a macho, self-actualized character, simply dropping to his knees to be shot, a woman sitting quietly and comfortably by while her friend is raped, a child who doesn't really seem to be anything.. just  a convenient prop.. lots of loose ends.. but it is one of those films that can take you on a theatrical journey.. one which you may or may not enjoy.

3102584,3,B00136MBUM,"""The Backwoods"" (original title ""Bosque de sombras"") follow the story of two married couples holidaying in Spain and their nightmarish experiences. One couple is played by Gary Oldman and Aitana Snchez-Gijn and the other by Paddy Considine and Virginie Ledoyen. I don't know why, but the time is set in the 1970s. Perhaps they wanted to call up the memories of two masterpieces made in the 70s: ""Straw Dogs"" and ""Deliverance.""

In fact, Paddy Considine's mild-mannered character Norman might remind us of Dustin Hoffmann's hero in the Sam Peckinpah classic. Two male characters Norman and Oldman's Paul, who has an assertive personality, travel to the ""backwoods"" in Spain with their wives for a summer holiday only to get involved with conflict with the locals after finding a little girl imprisoned in a shack.

If you look at the DVD jacket of the film, you will find the filmmakers are using the face and name of Gary Oldman to attract potential viewers. It is understandable. As you know, he is an excellent actor, whose charismatic performance alone is always worth the money you pay. But I must say that in ""The Backwoods"" the task of carrying the whole story to the end is not given to the character Oldman plays. You wish you could see more of his acting, which is not his best, it is certain, but surely his presence could have raised the tension of the film a little higher than it is.

In fact ""The Backwoods"" takes too much time to build up the tension it really needs. The film's pace gets faster in the second, but it never delivers the goods it promised at the beginning of the story. It tries to tell its story with a psychological depth, but female characters are bland, almost like ciphers, and as to the male ones the character development looks too sudden, which needs more insight.

""The Backwoods"" is directed by Spanish-born Koldo Serra. Like many recent Spanish-made thrillers, the cinematography is very atmospheric. Actually, each scene is shot professionally; violence erupts at times and ugliness of human nature is shown, but ""The Backwoods"" does not really thrill or surprise us with raw energy or depth that this kind of film needs.

It is not that ""The Backwoods"" is awful. It is just that the film needs some distinctive style that sets that apart from others.",1218758400,8,2294,4.782828282828283

Keep in mind that this film isn't meant to cater to the Euro art house cinema crowd.  This flick is a slice of pure, B-grade genre kettlecorn that would actually fit in quite nicely as part of a Tarantino Grindhouse double feature.

THE BACKWOODS takes place in Northern Spain in 1978. Two couples are vacationing together, each in different stages of their marriage. The realism between Norman and Lucy is raw, there are moments I wanted to look away, the intimacy, the pain felt so real. The characters are fleshed out excellently before the ""real"" pain begins.

Norman and Paul go on a misguided hunting trip in the woods and stumble on a seemingly abandoned house with a horrible secret. Locked away inside is a feral child chained and in rags. The child has deformities and has suffered tremendously, judging by her reaction to the men.

Rather than leave her there to possible starve, since there wasn't any food in the shack, Paul decides to take her back with them. He reasons with Norman that they can feed her, clean her up and then take her to the police.

And perhaps Paul's plan would have worked, except for the group of violent Spanish heathens who show up on his doorstep, determined to take back possession of their property. When the inevitable clash occurs, ill-fated choices are made, sad attempts at redemption and the grudging respect between two enemies.
But even more surprising is the character development of Norman, the layers that strip away till the naked core is bloody and bruised.

THE BACKWOODS won't be everyone's cup of tea. Everything isn't nice and neatly wrapped up at the end. I have to admit, the ending was a bit shocking for me, something I didn't see coming. But the film delivers. The atmosphere, the moodiness, the beautiful scenery, meaty characters that you can relate to, all this makes THE BACKWOODS a superior film experience.

3102589,4,B00136MBUM,"THE BACKWOODS

When I came across this movie I noticed that Gary Oldman was in it so I was interested, then after reading the back I knew I had to have it. The premise for this sounded really good although it reminded me [just from the synopsis] of another flick. In all fairness the other movie I was thinking of came out after this one, and it turned out to be different. I took this over to my grandparents house because it sounded like the type of crazy flick that they like. My brother joined as well, love them movie nights over there.

Two married couples are taking a nice little retreat to Spain at the house one of them recently purchased. The couple who now own the place have roots in Spain and speak the language, the other couple do not. That second couple is also having some very serious marital problems. All that seems to be the reasons for this little getaway. But after an unfriendly welcome from the locals the two men decide to go hunting the next day. It is during this time that they come across a house that a deformed little girl is being held at. After unchaining her they decide they need to get her to some help and want to find the police. Unfortunately they don't know the wooded area and the locals form before show up at the door looking for a lost girl.

This is a really good movie especially story wise, it was in fact that synopsis that got me to purchase this. Films like this are always so interesting to me because crazy things do happen in real life. Then of course we have the acting in the movie which was wonderful. The entire cast was great and played each part very believably. Director Koldo Serra who also co wrote with Jon Sagala admittedly did have the film move a bit slow but that didn't really bother me that much. To me that pace made it seem a little more realistic. There is violence and one scene in particular that some may not enjoy.

The thing that put me off a little with the film was the ending. I won't ruin for anyone reading this and maybe I missed something but I didn't really get it. That may have just been me though so judge for yourself. I really wish that the DVD had a commentary or something on it; maybe things could have been explained.

I wish at the end of this movie, they elaborate a little detail. I like Gary Oldman as one of the leading actor. I first saw his movie with Wynona (DRACULA) & the professional (he's a tough drug lord syndicate). However, story like this always happened. Those some who travelled overseas encountered problem with locals (resident of that town) and end up in captivity/kidnap/ played with & murdered because of discrimination (cultural background & rare physical appearances of caucasian feature & other ethnicity) which sometimes misunderstood by some. Ex. here in the US you could dress tight & skimpy going to the local grocery. But if you visited overseas country and dress the same way you dress as when you're in your country, some locals thinks that a bit offensive to women that are from to that country & seductive to men.",1425168000,,966,4.755952380952381

3102594,2,B00136MBUM,"I have to give it to the director and all of the staff that filmed The Backwoods; the film truly does have a feel of late-70s nostalgia. That being the case, while the setting feels genuine, the plot tends to meander and never really picks up much of a pace. The story is simple: two couples are going on a vacation to an old farmhouse in the Basque Mountains of Spain. They are British; the couple who own the farmhouse speak fluent Spanish, the other two do not. On their way to the getaway they stop at the ""last sign of civilization"" and grab a quick drink. Some Spaniards drinking at a table say some rude things about English tourists only knowing enough Spanish to get drunk, the fluent gentleman admonishes them, the wife of the first guy walks into the doorway of the pub with a wet shirt on and showing it off to the patrons, and off they go.

After this setup, you are waiting for the suspense to start. Couple #1 (who don't speak Spanish) are going through a difficult period on their marriage, with the wife being cold and almost rude to her husband, who lacks a spine. Couple #2 are much more worldly, the husband owns the farmhouse, is more of an outdoorsman, and is the de facto ""leader"" of the group. Everyone looks up to him for guidance, especially the husband from couple #1. With this setup, the two men go hunting and find a ""deformed"" girl locked up in a squalid cabin alone, filthy, feral, and with only a doll to keep her company.

Now, the plot summary already tells you that they attempt to rescue the girl and it irritates some of the villagers. At this point you would think that the action picks up a bit, maybe you would see some stalking or other aspects to raise the tension. Nope. Eventually those same guys from the bar in the first scene show up at the cabin, looking for the girl. Now, you're thinking, FINALLY! some action! Nope, not really. Granted, the actions taken in this film exhibit a more ""normalized"" response to a threat than a slasher movie, and yes, there is death, but the way that everything plays out is so expected and clich that I kept watching the movie just to see if my predictions were right.

In short, the story has the main plot: the mystery of a deformed girl being locked up in a squalid cabin: why, how, who. Then there are subplots: the marital issues of Couple #1, the indecisiveness of husband #1, the cold and rude way that wife #1 deals with him; all of these are introduced as the story drags along. The biggest problem is that you lack so much information about who is the bad guy/motive that a lot of what happens just seems random, with the differing plots and subtexts working their way into each scene without resolving anything. By the time the ending comes along, you really don't care anymore.

I am sure that this movie is meant to demonstrate the outdated and cruel thinking that happens in the more rural areas of Europe, something akin to the backwoods ""antics"" displayed in movies like ""Deliverance"". But, taken as a suspense title meant to shame the ""wrong"" thinking and dangers of discriminating against those born differently. Between the wandering dialogue and plot that never makes a stronger statement than ""hmm maybe that's bad and you shouldn't do that"", you will need a horror/suspense infusion, STAT! My antidote? ""The Exorcist"".",1398297600,4,3323,4.551839464882943
3102595,3,B00136MBUM,"A little girl is locked up in the woods.  She has fused fingers.  The family and the villager don''t kill her for her abnormality but they don't let her interact with the rest of them possibly from superstition/ignorance - that is never made clear.  Basque is obviously given no preferential government support to develop unlike Tibet.  It is perhaps similar to the Australian Outback.

According to Wikipedia, the Basque people have distinct dna.  This is also the case with the Tibetans.

""In 1920, H. G. Wells referred to the Mediterranean race as the Iberian race. He regarded it as a fourth subrace of the Caucasian race, along with the Aryan, Semitic, and Hamitic subraces. He stated that the main ethnic group that most purely represented the racial stock of the Iberian race was the Basques, and that the Basques were the descendants of the Cro-Magnons. In 1994, in his book The History and Geography of Human Genes, population geneticist L. Luca Cavalli-Sforza stated that ""there is support from many sides"" for the hypothesis that the Basques are the descendants of the original Cro-Magnons.""

This is a French Spanish coproduction which is appropriate because France and Spain both occupy native Basque territory where the inhabitants still speak their language and identify themselves as Basque.  Some of this story may be referring to the assimilation policy of aborginal children in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rabbit-Proof-Fence/dp/B009ZM76J2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rabbit-Proof Fence</a>&nbsp;but masked as a horror film.  All four of the stars are obviously non-native although Gary Oldman's character claims parial Basque ancestry like haoles who are part Hawaian or Johnny Depp who is given to reminding everyone of his Native American ancestry but in this film, the locals are having none of that.

I think by making this one of many in a wave of horror films, there is more of an audience for this film which basically just puts our eyeballs on the Basque region and doesn't really do much else.  Odo eventually returned to the Dominion at the end of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine so it's not a given that assimilation will hold even though it may be practically more beneficial.",1379289600,,2248,5.301408450704225

3102597,4,B00136MBUM,"With some solid acting performances, The Backwoods (2007) is a tense and edgy thriller with some dark undercurrents swirling beneath the surface, as newcomers to the Basque region in Spain, run afoul of some the locals.

The year is 1978, and Paul (Gary Oldham) has invited his friend Norman (Paddy Considine) and his wife Lucy (Virginie Ledoyen), who are having marital problems, to come to his home located deep in the woods for a visit.  Paul's family was originally from the area, and he has moved there to live with his wife Isabel (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon) who is Spanish.  Paul himself speaks fluent Spanish, and tries to be a hospitable host, though he often comes off as a condescending know-it-all, talking down to Norman.

While wandering through the woods hunting, Norman and Paul run across a cottage, break in, and discover a young girl with deformed hands, imprisoned inside.  Returning home with the girl, Paul decides to take her to the nearest village, and turn her over to the police.  While on the way, a distracted Paul slams his SUV into a tree, forcing the group to return to the cabin.

The following day, a group of men with guns arrive at the house.  Their leader Paco (Lluis Homar), says they are looking for a missing girl.  Paul joins the search party intending to lead them away, and tells Norman to take the girl to the police.  Norman however, decides to stay put, lying to the women about what Paul told him to do.  This is a decisive point, as from here Norman takes charge of the women and little girl, while Paul matches wits with Paco, who knows more about the situation than it seems.  Violence soon erupts, as Paul brutally drowns a man, while Norman employs his shotgun, and heads into the woods with the women in an attempt to reach help.

The film's ending is somewhat confusing and perhaps unsatisfying, as the child is saved, but things do not conclude in a neat and tidy manner, and there are jagged holes left for the viewer to fill in.  The situation between Lucy and Norman deteriorates under stress, and becomes one of the key elements.  It's a point of discussion, whether they have any future together.  Directed by Koldo Serra, Backwoods has some impressive cinematography, and some strong acting performances, particularly by Gary Oldman, Lluis Homar, and Paddy Considine.  The story while fairly credible, does unravel at the end, and the unconventional finish may be unsettling.  The action sequences are mostly very well done, and except for the terribly clichd standoff at the end, pretty realistic.  Rating: 3.5 stars)",1318809600,2,2573,4.806818181818182

Bunch of folks in the woods with shot guns trying to rescue a wild girl who was locked up by family members for some unknown reason--except noticeable hand deformity?  People get shot.  It rains.  End of story.

I wish at the end of this movie, they elaborate a little detail. I like Gary Oldman as one of the leading actor. I first saw his movie with Wynona (DRACULA) & the professional (he's a tough drug lord syndicate). However, story like this always happened. Those some who travelled overseas encountered problem with locals (resident of that town) and end up in captivity/kidnap/ played with & murdered because of discrimination (cultural background & rare physical appearances of caucasian feature & other ethnicity) which sometimes misunderstood by some. Ex. here in the US you could dress tight & skimpy going to the local grocery. But if you visited overseas country and dress the same way you dress as when you're in your country, some locals thinks that a bit offensive to women that are from to that country & seductive to men.",1425168000,,966,4.755952380952381

3337091,2,B00136MBUM,"I have to give it to the director and all of the staff that filmed The Backwoods; the film truly does have a feel of late-70s nostalgia. That being the case, while the setting feels genuine, the plot tends to meander and never really picks up much of a pace. The story is simple: two couples are going on a vacation to an old farmhouse in the Basque Mountains of Spain. They are British; the couple who own the farmhouse speak fluent Spanish, the other two do not. On their way to the getaway they stop at the ""last sign of civilization"" and grab a quick drink. Some Spaniards drinking at a table say some rude things about English tourists only knowing enough Spanish to get drunk, the fluent gentleman admonishes them, the wife of the first guy walks into the doorway of the pub with a wet shirt on and showing it off to the patrons, and off they go.

After this setup, you are waiting for the suspense to start. Couple #1 (who don't speak Spanish) are going through a difficult period on their marriage, with the wife being cold and almost rude to her husband, who lacks a spine. Couple #2 are much more worldly, the husband owns the farmhouse, is more of an outdoorsman, and is the de facto ""leader"" of the group. Everyone looks up to him for guidance, especially the husband from couple #1. With this setup, the two men go hunting and find a ""deformed"" girl locked up in a squalid cabin alone, filthy, feral, and with only a doll to keep her company.

Now, the plot summary already tells you that they attempt to rescue the girl and it irritates some of the villagers. At this point you would think that the action picks up a bit, maybe you would see some stalking or other aspects to raise the tension. Nope. Eventually those same guys from the bar in the first scene show up at the cabin, looking for the girl. Now, you're thinking, FINALLY! some action! Nope, not really. Granted, the actions taken in this film exhibit a more ""normalized"" response to a threat than a slasher movie, and yes, there is death, but the way that everything plays out is so expected and clich that I kept watching the movie just to see if my predictions were right.

In short, the story has the main plot: the mystery of a deformed girl being locked up in a squalid cabin: why, how, who. Then there are subplots: the marital issues of Couple #1, the indecisiveness of husband #1, the cold and rude way that wife #1 deals with him; all of these are introduced as the story drags along. The biggest problem is that you lack so much information about who is the bad guy/motive that a lot of what happens just seems random, with the differing plots and subtexts working their way into each scene without resolving anything. By the time the ending comes along, you really don't care anymore.

I am sure that this movie is meant to demonstrate the outdated and cruel thinking that happens in the more rural areas of Europe, something akin to the backwoods ""antics"" displayed in movies like ""Deliverance"". But, taken as a suspense title meant to shame the ""wrong"" thinking and dangers of discriminating against those born differently. Between the wandering dialogue and plot that never makes a stronger statement than ""hmm maybe that's bad and you shouldn't do that"", you will need a horror/suspense infusion, STAT! My antidote? ""The Exorcist"".",1398297600,4,3323,4.551839464882943
3337092,3,B00136MBUM,"A little girl is locked up in the woods.  She has fused fingers.  The family and the villager don''t kill her for her abnormality but they don't let her interact with the rest of them possibly from superstition/ignorance - that is never made clear.  Basque is obviously given no preferential government support to develop unlike Tibet.  It is perhaps similar to the Australian Outback.

According to Wikipedia, the Basque people have distinct dna.  This is also the case with the Tibetans.

""In 1920, H. G. Wells referred to the Mediterranean race as the Iberian race. He regarded it as a fourth subrace of the Caucasian race, along with the Aryan, Semitic, and Hamitic subraces. He stated that the main ethnic group that most purely represented the racial stock of the Iberian race was the Basques, and that the Basques were the descendants of the Cro-Magnons. In 1994, in his book The History and Geography of Human Genes, population geneticist L. Luca Cavalli-Sforza stated that ""there is support from many sides"" for the hypothesis that the Basques are the descendants of the original Cro-Magnons.""

This is a French Spanish coproduction which is appropriate because France and Spain both occupy native Basque territory where the inhabitants still speak their language and identify themselves as Basque.  Some of this story may be referring to the assimilation policy of aborginal children in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rabbit-Proof-Fence/dp/B009ZM76J2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rabbit-Proof Fence</a>&nbsp;but masked as a horror film.  All four of the stars are obviously non-native although Gary Oldman's character claims parial Basque ancestry like haoles who are part Hawaian or Johnny Depp who is given to reminding everyone of his Native American ancestry but in this film, the locals are having none of that.

I think by making this one of many in a wave of horror films, there is more of an audience for this film which basically just puts our eyeballs on the Basque region and doesn't really do much else.  Odo eventually returned to the Dominion at the end of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine so it's not a given that assimilation will hold even though it may be practically more beneficial.",1379289600,,2248,5.301408450704225

3337094,4,B00136MBUM,"With some solid acting performances, The Backwoods (2007) is a tense and edgy thriller with some dark undercurrents swirling beneath the surface, as newcomers to the Basque region in Spain, run afoul of some the locals.

The year is 1978, and Paul (Gary Oldham) has invited his friend Norman (Paddy Considine) and his wife Lucy (Virginie Ledoyen), who are having marital problems, to come to his home located deep in the woods for a visit.  Paul's family was originally from the area, and he has moved there to live with his wife Isabel (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon) who is Spanish.  Paul himself speaks fluent Spanish, and tries to be a hospitable host, though he often comes off as a condescending know-it-all, talking down to Norman.

While wandering through the woods hunting, Norman and Paul run across a cottage, break in, and discover a young girl with deformed hands, imprisoned inside.  Returning home with the girl, Paul decides to take her to the nearest village, and turn her over to the police.  While on the way, a distracted Paul slams his SUV into a tree, forcing the group to return to the cabin.

The following day, a group of men with guns arrive at the house.  Their leader Paco (Lluis Homar), says they are looking for a missing girl.  Paul joins the search party intending to lead them away, and tells Norman to take the girl to the police.  Norman however, decides to stay put, lying to the women about what Paul told him to do.  This is a decisive point, as from here Norman takes charge of the women and little girl, while Paul matches wits with Paco, who knows more about the situation than it seems.  Violence soon erupts, as Paul brutally drowns a man, while Norman employs his shotgun, and heads into the woods with the women in an attempt to reach help.

The film's ending is somewhat confusing and perhaps unsatisfying, as the child is saved, but things do not conclude in a neat and tidy manner, and there are jagged holes left for the viewer to fill in.  The situation between Lucy and Norman deteriorates under stress, and becomes one of the key elements.  It's a point of discussion, whether they have any future together.  Directed by Koldo Serra, Backwoods has some impressive cinematography, and some strong acting performances, particularly by Gary Oldman, Lluis Homar, and Paddy Considine.  The story while fairly credible, does unravel at the end, and the unconventional finish may be unsettling.  The action sequences are mostly very well done, and except for the terribly clichd standoff at the end, pretty realistic.  Rating: 3.5 stars)",1318809600,2,2573,4.806818181818182

8249337,4,B00136MBUM,"THE BACKWOODS (2006) stars Gary Oldman and Paddy Considine as British friends, Paul and Norman, who, along w/ their wives (Virginie Ledoyen and Aitana Sanchez-Gijon), head into the Spanish wilderness. Paul has purchased his grandmother's house, planning to ""get away from it all"". A stop at a rural bar, brings an encounter w/ the locals that proves to be a bit... tense. Upon arriving at the house, it's clear that the two marriages are quite different, w/ Norman's appearing to be near its end. Paul is also more of an ""outdoors-man"", as well as being more aggressive / fearless than Norman. While out hunting, the two men come across a seemingly abandoned structure. Inside, they make an unexpected discovery. There's a feral little girl, locked in a room, living in deplorable conditions. A rescue is made, followed by a mad rush to get back to civilization. Unfortunately, circumstances force them back to the house, where things begin to unravel, resulting in attempted rape and death. The rest is a struggle to stay alive. Comparisons to DELIVERANCE are not unwarranted. The whole ""fish out of water"" dynamic concerning the English outsiders, the dangerous hicks, the forest setting, etc., all bring that classic to mind. There's also the relationship between Paul and Norman, which is not unlike that of Lewis and Ed in DELIVERANCE. Still, there are enough differences to make this film stand on its own.

8249338,1,B00136MBUM,"This is a pretty bad movie!  There are none of the normal elements I rate a movie on that in my opinion even get as high as OK.  The concept was probably the brain flatulence from a demented nightmare of some urban fool who thinks anyone who lives more than 100 miles from a Starbucks is an inbred serial killer and that would be suspense and drama aplenty. Then, he wrote the script!  Completely unrealistic dialog which had the stilted presentation of a 6th grade class play when coupled with the dreadful acting/direction. The cinematography was just there with little to invoke drama with the forest which would have been something interesting anyway..
I usually dump a film like this after 15 min or so but I watched EVERY MINUTE of it in hope of finding why others rated it higher than dreadful.",1517788800,,801,4.5874125874125875
