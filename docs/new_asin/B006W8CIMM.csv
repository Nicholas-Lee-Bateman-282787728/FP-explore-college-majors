8505404,5,B006W8CIMM,Stella has easily become one of my top 3 favorite British TV shows.  It takes place in a quaint little Welsh town called Ponteberry and it is based on a 40-something gal and her 3 children and her love life (or lack thereof).  Stella is kinda your normal gal who is trying to make ends meat and as much as she loves her tiny town I think the fact that everyone knows her business drives her nuts.  I love the shenanigans and the town is a place I'd gladly visit (if it were real.),1441411200,,480,4.085106382978723
8505405,5,B006W8CIMM,Love this show! Ruth Jones is brilliant! I wish they'd release it on region 1 DVD.,1433462400,,82,4.1875
8505406,5,B006W8CIMM,"If you are a fan of Gavin & Stacey, you will love Stella. All the elements that made G&S a hit are here: funny Welsh characters, witty dialogue, scenic small town where everyone knows everyone else. Ruth Jones puts Nessa to rest and proves she can carry a sitcom all on her own.  She's funny, sweet and while she's meant to be a bit frumpy it is easy to see why guys tend to fall for her. It is a shame that the DVDs are not available in US format yet. America needs more well rounded real women like Stella.",1421625600,,508,4.08
8505407,5,B006W8CIMM,I have seen episodes online but I would really like to purchase the series DVD. Does anyone know when it will be released for Region 1 distribution?,1375056000,6,148,4.518518518518518
8505408,5,B006W8CIMM,"Absolutely loved this series.  Bought both series 1 and 2 and can't wait for series 3!  Ruth Jones is comic genius. I don't want to sell it short by just representing it as comedy, there is so much more than just comedy in her work.  If you liked Gavin and Stacey you will love Stella.",1368489600,4,285,4.1454545454545455
8505409,5,B006W8CIMM,"I love British comedies and bought this on a whim because I adored Ruth Jones in both Little Britain and Gavin & Stacey.  Definitely glad did.  It takes a minute to get into the show, but once you do it's so charming & funny.  Love love love her!",1365033600,3,246,4.083333333333333
8505410,5,B006W8CIMM,"Really enjoyed it and can't wait to watch the 2nd series coming out  on DVD at end of the year.
One of my friends was into it and lent me the DVD to watch.  Loved it! and bought it straight away
then lent it to my parents to watch who loved it too!",1363737600,3,248,3.660377358490566
8505411,5,B006W8CIMM,This is a comedy/drama with very likeable characters. Quirky and fun with light drama thrown in. Various story lines all enjoyable. The actors/actresses are all great. A very pleasant way to spend an hour. Reminds me of Doc Martin but not as eccentric. There should be more series like this.,1362787200,3,291,4.84
