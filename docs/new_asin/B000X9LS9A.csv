8227417,1,B000X9LS9A,"This video comes at the issue of occultism from a strictly Christian perspective.  While I will concede that the film makers mixed in some factual information with their profoundly biased critiques, I must warn viewers that the video is NOT an unbiased (or even terribly informative) documentary. You will find a few interesting comments and clips interspersed throughout, but nothing more.

Those of you who are fans of well made documentaries should know that the ethics of proper reporting were not maintained during the production of this video.  So, if you seek good, informative, information then you should look elsewhere.  If, on the other hand, you are a christian person who wants information on the occult from a strictly christian (and opinion based) perspective, then you have found a perfect match.",1317513600,8,812,5.175572519083969
8227418,5,B000X9LS9A,"Acording to the Bible anyone who practices the occult will not enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Wiccans practice the occult. According to the Bible,anything that has to do with the occult is satanic. Satan uses the occult to draw people away from the truth of God's word. So when Christians believe Wicca is sanatic,they are just believing the Bible.
  This DVD is highly recommended for Bible believing Christians.",1241049600,3,411,5.029411764705882
8227419,1,B000X9LS9A,"All lies!! First off Wicca is a recognized religion by our government, it's not some scary Satanic organization as lead to believe by Christians. Wiccans or Witches if you prefer are not Christian, nor claim to be, yet Christian dieties are attached to them by Christians. Satan is a Christian diety.

Second, Mike Warnke has been proven to be a liar, too bad people are still believing him. Have you read his book? It's a joke. Crazy thing is, Christians are that gullible. They've handed millions of dollars over if not to him, his publishers and his record company, because they bought into the lie.

Think for youselves people. Do some research.",1201564800,17,649,4.785714285714286
