8640777,4,B00IC13Q6O,"I purchased this mainly to relive the last time I saw GG in concert - at The RC Bridge Lounge in New Orleans, a little over a month before The Geeg banged his way off the face of the planet.  The shows included are pretty much what we've come to expect from a GG Allin concert - depravity, drunken violence, stalwart fans singing along in the face of not-at-all surprising attacks on the audience... the only thing that disappointed me was that the final New Orleans concert, despite no lighting other than the camera's, was the fact that the CD skipped and blanked out towards the 'climax' of the show (as was mentioned in another reviewer's summation) - other than that, the song line-up is pretty much the same at every show, and its only the response of the assembled crowd that changes things up a bit. Not essential, but if you weren't 'lucky' enough to see the circus live, you can get something of an idea of the anticipation, fear, and excitement of living the Dream...",1458432000,,978,4.52542372881356
8640778,5,B00IC13Q6O,"This Rules, Rules, Rules!!!!! All the shows are great on this DVD. So many choice GG moments. For the core fans that may not have this yet I am not going to say shit and spoil this for you except for this one call out- one of the shows GG is separated from the crowd by a fence about five feet in front of the stage, and then the crowd is held back by bouncers ten more feet in front of the fence, so essentially there is no way for GG to attack at will so he needs to work for it and work he does, getting some action in. GG's frustration is palpable and you feel like you are really on his team as the crowd is pretty reliant on the safety measures in place and they keep taunting from a far.... bunch of pussies. This set up makes for a super interesting watch, its almost like a real concert because of the stage and barrier set up but it's the man himself in this setting, so if you look at it that way its kinda like a bizzaro world type thing at least in GG's universe. It's almost like performance art. The Back cover photo of the DVD is worth the price alone. I think I may have it blown up and framed for my family room.",1453161600,,1130,3.938864628820961

This disc is another in a long line of GG Allin show collections. I think it ranks among his best, along with ""Raw, Brutal, Rough & Bloody"", and ""Savage South"". This particular disc contains:

- Chicago, IL 6/4/93 (32:36): Out of control! This is a great show hampered by bad sound, but I guess you can't have everything. Right out of the gate, GG gives himself an enema, s@!#s on a flag and bible, starts a rather large fire, and throws fireworks into the mix. GG is behind a giant wooden barricade (or should I say the audience is protected by a giant wooden barricade). There is active security, and they try to keep GG away from the audience, which kind of defeats the purpose of these shows. You can see that someone tried to prepare for this event. The mic stands are duct taped down, and the monitors are covered in plastic, as well.
- Detroit, MI 6/6/93 (31:32): In a real club, and a big one. GG compares his member with an audience member's member. They throw away the mics after these shows, right?
- Houston, TX 5/17/93 (26:17): Texas shows are usually chaotic, but everyone seems to want to stay away from GG at this one. Leave it to GG to stir it up himself. Love it when he molests the guy hiding behind the PA. No one is safe!
- New Orleans, LA 5/16/93 (22:20): Can I say ""out of control"" again?! There appears to be no lighting at this show, so the cameras provide the light. This definitely adds to the chaotic atmosphere. My disc skips a few times between 17:22 and 17:34. The disc surface looks perfectly clean, so I'm not sure if all the copies do this, or just mine.

GG died on 6/28/93, so these are amongst his final shows.",1401321600,10,1818,4.404761904761905
