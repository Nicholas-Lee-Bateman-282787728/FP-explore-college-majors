8354340,5,B0000D151R,"I purchased the ""Bagpipe Teacher"" DVD thinking it was reasonably priced for an entry level learner. I was pleased to find that it was a good resource to help a beginner.

Some history: My son began learning the Great Highland Bagpipes approximately four years ago using the John Cairns course. This course is the most detailed and helpful we have found to properly learn to play the pipes if no instructor is available in the area where you live. My son learned by using the Cairns course (books and CD's)...He had no other instruction.  He now plays well and skilled pipers that he has met at events have commented that he plays quite well, especially since he has had no formal instruction. So this experience is the basis that I will use to evaluate the DVD, ""Bagpipe Teacher"".
""Bagpipe Teacher"", is helpful and well done.  It is helpful to learn the ""basics"" of the practice chanter. This is the entry level instrument to begin piping. This video is will help you decide if you really want to put the effort into piping. If you get a practice chanter and use this video and like playing it, then you would need to find a tutor or purchase the John Cairns course to progress through the entire process. Then you will learn about following sheet music all the way to actually striking up the pipes! But it requires dedication and hours upon hours of practice and a good set of pipes (expect to pay $900 and up) to become proficient.

We recommend this DVD (Bagpipe Teacher) as it is reasonable for the good quality of instruction you get, plus some footage of professional piping.",1262044800,2,1582,4.599290780141844
8354341,5,B0000D151R,"This dvd is helpful for people who do not have an instructor available to them.  There are parts of the dvd that you have to play in slow motion to better see the finger placement.  The main screen or menu could have been helpful if it showed what is taught in the lesson, without me going to the lesson.",1184198400,8,304,4.135593220338983
