7872751,5,6304475454,I bought this because I was especially interested in how animals decompress after being in a stressful situation. We stay in PTSD because we don't know how to let go at the time of trauma and continue to carry it with us for the rest of days we have breath in our bodies.  Peter Levine's work shows more of this concept.  DG,1427932800,,324,4.209677419354839

7872753,5,6304475454,"I vividly remember this documentary when it first was broadcast in the States.  Churchill is perfectly placed to allow for human-bear interaction, if viewing from a safe distance qualifies as interaction!  The bears wait around (and sometimes in) Churchill, Manitoba waiting for the sea in Hudson Bay to freeze, so they can go north to feed.
Unfortunately, when bear meets man, the bear often suffers tremendously for it.  These days effective methods have been put into place to separate bears from people, ensuring the safety of the bears.

7872754,5,6304475454,"I first saw this program back in 1983 as a National Geographic special on PBS.  As a nature/travel enthuesist - I was captivated by the incredible opportunity a traveler had to view these great bears so close, and the shear isolation of the little town of Churchill, Manitoba (Canada).  Because of this video, and my desire to see the greatness and beauty before it was spoiled - I was forced to add ""polar bear watching"" to my list of ""Things I Want to do Before I Die"".
Well, my time has finally come (no, I'm not departing this world). I'M GOING TO CHURCHILL...! If it were not for this excellent program, I would never have known about this wonderful opportunity.  I can hardly wait.....Thank you, National Geographic!",969667200,3,722,4.669291338582677
