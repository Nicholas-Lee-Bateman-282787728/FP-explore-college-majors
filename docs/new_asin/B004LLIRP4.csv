4401482,4,B004LLIRP4,"What can I say!  Abbott and Costello are favorites and I was glad to find this enjoyable film.  There is music, their usual great dialogue, good supporting characters, and a sweet little story to interfere with their fun.  They work with a young girl, a young couple, and a myriad of others to defeat the bad guys and get a racehorse to the track so he can win the purse and save the show.
This is a lesser watched movie, but I can recommend it for the collection.",1318723200,,464,4.25

4401484,5,B004LLIRP4,"I haven't seen this movie since I was kid, when our local TV station would air an Abbott & Costello movie at least once every weekend. What a delight to see this film again on DVD! It's typically daffy A&C nonsense about a cabbie (Lou) who accidentally kills the beloved horse of a carriage rider & family. So he & his pal (Bud, naturally) wind up replacing the horse with racing horse Tea Biscuit---which, of course, gets them in hot water when the famous thoroughbred is reported missing. As with a Damon Runyon yarn, the story is populated with cops, grifters & racing enthusiasts (similar to some A&C movies). There's even an in-joke at the beginning when one mug asks the other: ""Why are you carrying an umbrella?"" The reply: ""Who knows? It's a Damon Runyon story!"" Naturally, the story is tailored to feature some great A&C bits. There's the ""mudder/fodder"" routine (later reprised in ""The Noose Hangs High"") and ""The Betting Parlor"" scene, which is hysterical to watch poor Lou go into exasperated fits (and Bud cleverly turns the tables on the grifters).
The team gets some fine comic support from familiar faces Eugene Palette (comic foil) & Shemp Howard (a few years before he re-joined The Three Stooges). And 1943 was the year that saw A&C only turn out two pictures (the other was ""Hit The Ice"") after a frantic schedule of FOUR pictures per year. The reason being that 1943 dealt two cruel blows to Costello: The tragic death of his two year-old son and being stricken with rheumatic fever, which greatly weakened him.
I'm not certain what the earlier reviewer was saying about a ""poor quality DVD"" (perhaps they just got a bad one off the assembly line); mine played perfectly, and the print is in excellent condition for its age. The only minor quibble is that Universal didn't even bother adding a menu page. Hmmm...
Nevertheless, it was great seeing this rare A&C comedy finally arrive on DVD!",1298937600,15,1911,4.741741741741742

The boys need to get a horse for an old man whom has lost his own, this being an isue as the old man is a 'taxi buggy' person that existed back when cars were becoming more of a thing.

  PLOT SUMMARY:

  Wilbur Hoolihan (Lou Costello) accidentally kills a hack horse owned by King O'Hara (Cecil Kellaway) and his daughter, Princess (Patsy O'Connor) by feeding it candy. In the hopes of raising enough money to replace it, he and his friend Grover Mockridge (Bud Abbott) visit a gambling parlor. They are successful in raising the money, but before they can purchase a new horse, a con man swindles Wilbur out of his cash.

  They are informed by some touts that an old horse is available for nothing at one of the tracks. They visit the track and mistakenly take the wrong horse, a champion by the name of Tea Biscuit. They present the horse to O'Hara as a replacement for his deceased horse.

  The horse's real owner, Colonel Brainard (Samuel Hinds) offers a reward for Tea Biscuit. By this time O'Hara has taken a fare up to Saratoga. Wilbur and Grover, realizing their error, drive to Saratoga. The three touts also realize that Wilbur and Grover took Tea Biscuit, and trail them hoping to recover the horse and collect the reward. Wilbur and Grover manage to find O'Hara and hide Tea Biscuit in their hotel room. But they are hounded by the house detective, Warner, who was tipped off by the touts. Wilbur and Grover head to the race track in time for a big race. Grover makes a deal with Warner: for $100 he will give him the horse Wilbur rides. Grover then uses that money to bet on Tea Biscuit. Before the race, Wilbur is thrown off Tea Biscuit and lands on Rhubarb. Tea Biscuit, with a real jockey aboard, wins the race. Wilbur rides Rhubarb and loses. Warner and the touts take Wilbur's horse, which they believe is Tea Biscuit, to Colonel Brainard for the reward, but it is the wrong horse. Grover holds the only winning ticket on Tea Biscuit, and uses their winnings to buy O'Hara a real replacement horse.

  TRIVIA:
 (1) There is a scene that breaks the fourth wall: Wilbur and Grover are in their apartment when someone knocks at the door. Grover says, ""Go answer the door, it might be Warner."" Wilbur answers, ""It won't do no good, we're signed up with Universal."" Abbott and Costello had a long term contract with Universal Studios at the time.
(2) It Ain't Hay is based upon the Damon Runyon story, Princess O'Hara, which Universal first made into a film in 1935 with Chester Morris.
(3) Filming of this picture began on September 28, 1942, and lasted until November 11. Lou's brother Pat was used as his stunt-double in the 'headless horseman' sequence.
(4) It was during production, on November 6, that Lou's wife, Anne, gave birth to their son, Lou 'Butch' Costello, Jr.
(5) It Ain't Hay was released on DVD on October 28, 2008 as part of Abbott and Costello: The Complete Universal Pictures Collection. The film's studio-authorized DVD release had been delayed for many years due to legal issues with the estate of Damon Runyon.",1364083200,,4221,4.745179063360881

8434486,5,B004LLIRP4,I have a weakness for movies that have any kind of horse racing in them and It Ain't Hay doesn't disappoint. It is one the best A&C movies. A early musical number goes on too long but that is the film's most significant flaw.,1520985600,,225,4.136363636363637
8434487,5,B004LLIRP4,"Great movie.  Sadly, not pressed, or burned on M-DISC

I completely understand that obscure movies like this may not economically justify pressing a disc.  However, I would have gladly paid a dollar or two more for a disc that would last forever.  Instead, they burned the movie on the old-fashioned, purple dye type disc that are only good for around 5 - 7 years. M-Disc last 100s of years.

This review is for the actual item I received from Amazon. If you are after a, ""pure movie review"", I suggest you look at the International Movie Database. There you will find many reviews without regard to the delivery mechanism.
