8181027,5,B000NQQ4FQ,This movie will forever be considered a cinematic masterpiece. It spawned a very successful franchise which still runs to this day. I couldn't regard this movie any higher than I do right now. This IS the missing piece of your collection.,1522886400,,238,4.829268292682927
8181028,5,B000NQQ4FQ,"Girl In Gold Boots is among the best MST3K episodes along with Incredible Mixed Up Zombies, Manos, Touch of Satan and Overdrawn At The Memory Bank.
Like the other movies mentioned, it doesn't matter what mood I'm in when I watch Gold Boots because the MST3K crew  always crack me up with their riffs on this lame, awful film.",1459468800,,325,4.508474576271187

8181031,3,B000NQQ4FQ,"Girl in Gold Boots(1967) is so bad, it's good. I first saw the film on Mystery Science Theater 3000 during the late 1990's Sci-Fi Channel era. The sweet, sexy Leslie McRay plays a waitress who wants to be a famous Go Go Dancer in Los Angeles! Jody Daniels and ""Regis Philbin doppelganger"" Tom Pace co-star. Girl in Gold Boots is a counterculture film that chickens out and becomes right winged during the climax! There's hammy attempts at melodrama! A female dancer high on drugs wishes she ""had her pretty mind back"". Director Ted V. Mikels churned out a lot of low budget grindhouse movies. He seems like a nice guy. There's an interview with him on the English TV show The Incredibly Strange Film Show. Mikels also gave us the silly ""nudie cutie"" Dr. Sex(1964)! Girl in Gold Boots delivers 1960's rock and roll and plenty of sexy, female Go Go Dancers. In the MST3K version, Mike Nelson claims the dancers' silver bikinis look like ""oven bags""! The film also has ""guest stars"" from 1960's pop culture. The guy who played the Sheik in Head(1968) played a nightclub bouncer in this film. Girl in Gold Boots is a ""classic bad movie"" and a 1960's time capsule.",1364774400,5,1159,4.631067961165049
8181032,5,B000NQQ4FQ,"Formerly available on the out of print MST3k vol 4, this episode is now available on a stand alone disc from Shout Factory, which is great, becuase this episode is fantastic.

From Ted V. Mikels of ""Astro-Zombies"" fame, ""Girl In Gold Boots"" is a 60's drama that chronicles the rise of Michelle, an aspiring Go Go dancer and her eventual entanglement in the world of drug dealing that everyone in these ""rise to fame"" movies falls into. I remember this being an ""okay"" episode when I first saw it, but now having watched it a few times again its become one of my top 10 favorite episodes. I think this is actually a really great ""first episode"" to show to people who haven't seen the show before.

The movie has some really wacky characters, the plot is cliched but moves quickly enough, and everything they do to accomplish those set plot points they do in just the stupidest way possible (the arythmic dancing, pouring beer on a motorcycle seat, robbing a jail by having ONE trustee exit, then having TWO come back in while being completely unnoticed by the sheriff they JUST WALKED PAST), making all the riffing just as easy as can be. Really a great episode, even the host segments are funny (Mike ""Taliban"" Nelson). Like I said, one of my top 10 favorites.  Buy it, if you don't have it.",1364601600,,1291,4.532188841201717
8181033,5,B000NQQ4FQ,"Mystery Science Theater 3000 is something new to me.  But it is fun.  It is a movie, a bad one with a couple of guys riffing it.  If you do not know what that is, well you know how when you watch a bad movie with your friends and you make fun of it through out the movie... well there you go.  That is what a riff is.  They say funny things about the mistakes in the movie, and bad acting and whatever else they find that is funny.",1362182400,,431,3.797752808988764
8181034,1,B000NQQ4FQ,"Twenty three bucks for the non-MST3K version?  You've got to be kidding me.  This should be in the dollar bin with Bela Legosi's Devil Bat.  Multiple editing botches, drunken father abuse, old guys dealing in drugs, awful dancing choreography, a protagonist named Critter, and you expect someone to shell out twenty-three bucks to see it?  Forget that.  I paid ten bucks for the non-MST3K version of Werewolf and that was a horrible decision on my part.

Girl in Gold Boots is a worthless movie, but it shines as an MST3K episode.  That's the only way this piece of refuse can ever be worth twenty-three bucks.  Get the MST3K version.  You won't regret it.",1155772800,4,656,4.734513274336283
8181035,3,B000NQQ4FQ,"This is one of Ted V. Mikels most ridiculous films ever (and that's saying something.) The film was one of the last satirized on MST3K, and I am grateful they took it on, though realize this is the original version. An interesting side note is observing what footage MST3K trimmed to make it fit their time requirements.

The plot concerns a girl, Michele Casey, with dreams of being a dancer who works in a roadside cafe with her abusive father, and who crosses paths with two men, the execrably adorable Finley Jones, who goes by the moniker ""Critter,"" and Buz Nichols, a small time hood who is clearly not good for Michele to be around.

Eventually they all wind up in Los Angeles at a ridiculous go-go joint complete with wretched band and fire breathing dragon motif, where Michele (of course) becomes the lead dancer because of her huge talent. Also in the talent department, Critter is an amateur singer-songwriter who pleasures us with a few tunes, leading to the question: who is worse at their chosen art form, Michele or Critter? I vote for Michele, but it's a close race. Along the way there are subplots about desertion from the Army, go-cart racing, and the obligatory brawl between Critter and Buz. One guess as to who ends up with Michele.

There are many holes in the plot, and even more continuity gaffes, but this is not a film for serious contemplation at any rate. The film is more enjoyable with the MST3K treatment, but it is still a gem for bad movie buffs in its original state.

Don't miss the commentary by Ted V. Mikels. I am fairly sure that most viewers will find reason to disagree with him on certain points. One thing is for sure, though: as I write this ""Girl in Gold Boots"" is number 81 on the Internet Movie Database list of the 100 worst films of all time. There is a reason for that, and it is a very compelling one. See for yourself.",1142121600,7,1872,4.497058823529412
