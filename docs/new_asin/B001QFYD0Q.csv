8335656,1,B001QFYD0Q,This piece portrays the Israelis in the Gaza conflict as unfeeling war mongers destined to destroy the Palestinians.  Balanced reporting?  I think not.  The segment was replete with editorializing-not reporting.  The carefully chosen words to describe the Israeli's actions were nothing more than dressed up anti-semitism.  I would have expected 60 Minutes to provide viewers with an unbiased accounting of the conflict.  It was sickening.  Save your money--because if you watch this trash--and pay for the privilege your intelligence is as questionable as those who pitched and produced the show.,1234310400,,597,5.566666666666666
8335657,5,B001QFYD0Q,"This is a powerful and thoughtful report by CBS's 60 minutes on the danger that Israeli settlements pose to the chances for Israeli-Palestinian peace. It is not very often to see this kind of reporting on the Israeli Palestinian conflict. Most of the news reports are biased toward the Israeli position. Many American news channels like CNN, have even started referring to the Israeli settlements as neighborhoods rather than Settlements. Bob Simon does a great job explaining the issue in a fair manner, while presenting the humiliating condition that the Palestinians have to live every day.",1233273600,3,593,5.1875
