I think it is the imagination and magic that makes it rise above the rest.  Each time I have seen it, I couldn't help but cry towards the end.  This is  one of my favorite movies, and I highly recommend it for anyone.",914716800,,360,4.014084507042254

96585,5,0790725657,I love this movie. I first saw it back in the 90's and it has Liam Cunningham from game of thrones as the girls father!,1510272000,,119,3.8
96586,4,0790725657,"Sara (Liesel Matthews) is the daughter of a single father and soldier, Captain Crewe (Game of Thrones' Liam Cunningham). After enlisting for World War I, the captain sends Sara to a boarding school in New York. Sara's generosity and storytelling talents make school life more bearable, but they also put her in poor standing with Miss Minchin (Eleanor Bron), the school's strict headmistress. It all amounts to a fun and whimsical family movie for the way it equates kindness and imagination with magic. Family movies about the immense power of a childhood's imagination are common, but this one stands out for being charming without being mawkish and for how it maturely transitions from fun to serious and back. If anyone should check this out, it should be fans of director Alfonso Cuaron and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. They were just as good then as they are today.",1508889600,,876,5.006849315068493

96602,2,0790725657,"Much better than the original Shirley Temple version, but it's too bad that no one can make a movie that actually follows the plot of the original book- which is soooo much better.  All the implausible elements of this movie arise from trying to twist the plot line and have Sara's father come back to life in the end - amid a ridiculous police chase that also never happens in the book.  As a child, I LIKED the idea that Sara was really an orphan, and its a perfect ending to have her find happiness at the end with Becky, Ram Dass, the Indian gentlemen, and of course, her fortune from the diamond mines.  Also neither of the movies really capture Sara's personality -  it's her courage, her intelligence, and her incredible maturity and strength that make her one of the most amazing heroines in children's literature.  The screenplays never seem to get this.  Shirley temple was the antithesis of Sara.  This version comes a little closer, but still misses the mark.",1503532800,2,971,4.6104651162790695

96650,1,0790725657,"I love the book A Little Princess, as well as the 1986 Wonderworks version which aired on PBS.  However this version ruined the heart of the original story.  In the book, Sara treats everyone as though she was a princess (that is, with dignity and respect)--even those who were hateful and abusive to her.  In this version, Sara insists she's a princess because ""all girls are.""  If everyone's a princess, then no one is.  Also, this version changed the original location from London to New York.  The movie tries hard to be funny with off the wall slapstick humor which falls flat.  The ending was ridiculous.  The casting was poor--I did not care for the actresses who played Sara or Becky.  Overall, this movie was a tremendous disappointment and would probably disappoint any die hard fan of the original book.",1484006400,,814,4.757142857142857

96707,5,0790725657,"This was Alfonso Cuarons debut, if memory serves. And the studio just didn't know what to do with it. Sorta like other wonderful stories that don't fit (The Wonder Boys, Brooklyn, etc.), it didn't get anything like a wide release, but they tried. It was simply beautiful at the theatre, though I admit to bringing a niece along, not being the ""target audience"".
The tale is common enough. The daughter of a rich English gentleman is left at a boarding school in New York while he goes off to war. In the place of the wicked stepmother we have a wicked schoolmarm. The beloved father is lost track of, the estate is taken and things are looking pretty dark. The little princess never loses what she learned. That every one is valuable.
It's not only a lovely story, it's simply beautiful. Every shot was carefully planned. The colours of India transposed against the grays of New York during WWII almost tell us their own tale.
It was a masterful debut. Of course, I tend to imagine it speaks more to a female audience, but the father goes to quite incredible lengths trying to get back to his daughter and is eventually saved by hearing her voice, so who can say?",1472688000,3,1163,4.542857142857143

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!

Maybe its because I watched it as a child but one day I felt a hankering to watch this movie again and I truly truly enjoyed it.  Its a beautiful film about taking what life has given you and never losing hope even when things look like they couldn't be any worse.  Its very well acted, Leisel Matthews is wonderful in this movie as Sara, a young girl whose imagination and kindness enchant just about everyone she comes in contact with.  Even if Sara is just a child she is truly a wonderful role model for anyone to follow: she may be young but she is smart, caring, and strong well beyond her years.  Even when the going gets tough Sara sticks by her principles and beliefs and refused to let life keep her down and empowers others around her to do the same.  I'd really recommend this movie for both children and adults its just a great film.",1461283200,,913,4.218390804597701

The movie is almost like seeing the pictures in my own head come true... some are a little more hollywood than I pictured but so beautifully imagined and filmed. I think it carries the message very nicely- one that every child can hold onto inside the treacherous jowls of societies puppet masters that have become bars to block our creative spirits. This book told me that there are an infinite number of princes and princesses challenged to hold their heart as central station. I will hold this dear to my soul as a light when darkness nears. :) Thank you to all who made this message a truth in our everyday lives.- Colleen Black",1461283200,4,733,4.477611940298507

I won't give any spoilers.  I'm sure a lot of people know what the movie is about as the original been out since the 1930s and this version was made in 1995. In a nutshell it's about a little girl who seems to have everything and then her life is changed in a minute.  Even though her circumstances have changed, her great attitude hasn't.

I love that with all the big action movies out there (which I love )  that this is a quiet sweet little movie with a good message ; ALL girls are princesses.  I actually WATCHED my little girl watch this and she just kept smiling ear to ear.",1458950400,,778,4.244897959183674

96846,4,0790725657,"I purchased this movie back in 2013 and for some reason I saw this yesterday which was 01.23.2016
I like the director Alfonso Cuarn pretty much. I like his movie CHILDREN OF MEN very much and that movie is on my top 20 list.
This movie is his second best for me. It is not just a movie for children.
It has fantasy, dream, and hope.
And most of all the art was done by BO WELCH who did some of the TIM BURTON'S work such as <EDWARD SCISSORHANDS><BEETLE JUICE>. The story told by the main charactor to her friends in the school has a lot of insert images and that was done by  BO WELCH's marvelous imagination. It was a little bit childish but had potential to become a cult film.
The movie somehow reminded me of his other work <Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban>. because both are happening in school,
If you liked <Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban>, you will enjoy this movie as well.",1453420800,,901,4.269005847953216

One interesting fact, the actress of this movie is Liesel Matthews.  Her born name is Liesel Anne Pritzker.  She is a member of the wealthy Pritzker family.  Liesel Anne Pritzker was born in Chicago, Illinois, into the wealthy Pritzker family, of Ukrainian Jewish origin on her father's side. Her parents are Irene (ne Dryburgh) and Robert Pritzker.

The child actors are well chosen. The cinematographic rendering of descriptive segments (I assume they come from the book) is outstanding. At times the story jumps from point A to point B like it's an executive summary (I hope the book does a better job). At times the story feels superficial but it makes sense for a young audience, this may be just the as much tragedy they can handle. The silly Disney-esque ending does not take away from an overall good movie.",1401494400,,636,4.264462809917355

97167,4,0790725657,"I'd read a lot of good reviews from adults so I wanted to see it just for myself, but when my friend and her two children visited recently  (age 4 and 8) it seemed like the perfect time to watch it.  Indeed, we all enjoyed it.  Very cute and sweet.

Admittedly there were a few times when certain scenes were mighty far fetched and left a lot to be explained, but given it was based on a book we decided to allow that those particular scenes were probably the result of an attempt to convey something that took 4 chapters to fill out in the book and as often happens, the audience is left perplexed unless they read the book, where it all made perfect sense.

I'm not sure I'd go so far as to read the book to find out, but suffice to say this is a delightful movie.  I may watch the original with Shirley Temple though.",1398297600,2,820,4.1257861635220126

The changes were so unnecessary and ended up ruining the story completely... I guess it's a ""okay enough"" movie without having read the book... but even then... there are better....very sad...",1395792000,,352,4.515625

There are so many 'princess characters' in videos that I didn't want her to misunderstand. She will soon be 7 years old and recognizes the difference between 'make believe' and 'reality.' To have an 'imagination' can be a wonderful gift that can help us to endure what might be the complexities of our reality . . . a way to grow emotionally and help one understand.

97209,2,0790725657,"In the last few days, I have read the book, saw the Shirley Temple movie and saw this movie.

Taken on its own with no reference to the book or ST movie, this movie is a good sappy movie, but perhaps only worthy of Lifetime.  The characters are incompletely developed and not believable and the sets and costumes are also unbelievable as well.  I find Sara the least believable.  For example, even as a servant in the school, her hair always looks beautiful and even and her clothes, although ripped they are not ragged.

Now when compared to the book and the ST movie, it's as if this movie took a bit of the book, a bit of the movie and its own artistic license and made a Twilight Zone version of them all combined.  It kept a lot of the ST movie's book unfaithfulness such as Sara's father really being alive, a love interest of the teacher, Sara's father being at war, etc.  It added its own things from left field, like Becky being black and well spoken, taking place in New York, having the many of the pupils sneak to the attic, having the house not being rowhouses and not adjoining, the locket, etc. It was more faithful to the book than the ST movie in that there was Miss Amelia and no Mr. Bertie or Miss Rose, the next door neighbor had a connection to Sara's father, that Lottie and Ermergarde were actual recognizable characters who would sneak to the attic, etc.

I found the moral climate of the movie less than the book or the ST movie.  The book and even the ST movie to a lesser degree, make a very good point of showing how Sara's spirit was never broken.  In spite of her change in fortune, she is a true princess.  She is kind and generous to all, she does not lie, show her anger or speak ill of anyone.  A major moral lesson of the book is that in spite of this all, Sara still remained true to her values.  I just didn't see that here.  She resorted to mock sorcery to stop Lavina from harassing her.  Her friends stole her locket and were sneaky about it.  Becky lied to Miss Minchin about seeing a mouse, etc.

My advice is that
1. If you want a TV movie quality flick that taken on its own is alright and nothing more, go for this movie.
2. If you want a good movie that is actually a good classic movie, although perhaps not true to the book, go for the Shirley Temple movie.
3. If you want an actual good story, with good character development and good moral lessons, just read the book.

Cuaron's brilliance is all over this one.  The story itself is absolutely amazing, and the cinematography is superb.  I was driven to tears many times during the movie as I have a little girl that age myself.  The beauty and humanity of the story and the ideals it portrays are heartwarming.

I really enjoyed this retelling of the classic Shirley Temple film The Little Princess, I first saw this remake many years ago & I really enjoyed it. this retelling seemed a bit more rich & layered in terms of the story & cinematography I appreciated Liesel Matthews character Sara Crewe using her imagination to get through the tough times at the school for girl's by telling beautiful story's to the other children

I also liked seeing the friendship develop between the servant girl Becky & Sara It was fascinating the way the movie cut into Sarah Crewes story telling her story's were almost like a separate movie within a movie

This movie is well worth watching remakes are usually bad but not in this instance, though the Original movie will always stand on it's own, this retelling is well done.",1393977600,,855,4.763513513513513

A little tidbit regarding this child star Liesel Matthews (Pritzky) she is now all grown up and is an heiress to the Hyatt Hotel chain family.  She donates her time and money to children in Ghana and other third world countries so that they may one day have clean drinking water and sanitation.  She has personally donated $50 million or more to different charities which she or her mother are personally involved in.  Her latest venture is taking the human waste from that country, drying it and re-selling it as fuel to other countries. Her husband is also a blue blood and donates his time and money as well!

97371,5,0790725657,"A wonderful movie for the family. There are some war scenes and other scary/intense scenes in the film. I don't think those scenes are for very young children. That's just my opinion. The movie has some wonderful lessons for children and adults.  I think this film was very under appreciated. Excellent acting, the film is just beautiful to watch. From the green school, with it's beautiful wood floors, to the adorable girls in their green school uniforms, and gorgeous yellow roses. I'm glad Amazon has it available on Instant video. I hope Amazon Instant Video continues adding even more great movies and miniseries in the future.",1389657600,,633,4.971698113207547

Our brother is 9 and she was looking fwd to showing him the move but was disappointed that they could not enjoy it because of how bad it skipped. We ended up having to watch something else because the anticipation of wanting to see a childhood classic gave us no patience so sit through the buffering.",1389571200,,473,4.325842696629214

97378,5,0790725657,Great movie for the entire family. All of our daughters are a Princess and this story shows us this. You never know what life will present you with.

97379,4,0790725657,"It is just a good story for little girls. The original is good too, bit this one is a little more updated with special effects.

97392,3,0790725657,"First of all, I always think that if the movie is based on a book, the book is better. If the book is good enough and has sold enough to have a movie made about it, no movie can do it justice. In fact, now that I've watched the movie, I'm going to read the book and check out the BBC version that everybody's been talking about just to see how this movie compares with them.
Anyway, I found that whichever actress played Sara (I was too lazy to look) didn't really seem real. I felt like she was a little slow to catch on with the emotions she was supposed to be portraying. Also, who giggles uncontrollably when butting on a robe?
Anyway, this movie is worth watching if you have nothing better to do.",1388880000,2,702,4.169117647058823

97407,2,0790725657,"""A Little Princess"" is a classic children's story.

97442,5,0790725657,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies for little girls. I love that this sweet little girl (Sara) never gives up and always retains that hope that her father will return for her. She recalls the special message that he taught her, that she is a princess (even if just his princess). Although she is abandoned to the care of a less than generous schoolmaster who treats little Sara as the lowliest of servants, Sara maintains her principles and treats others with unconditional love. One of my favorite scenes is when she and her friend (other little servant girl) wake up to a beautiful dream compliments of their generous neighbor benefactor. Alfonso Cuaron, who also directed a couple of the Harry Potter films, is a creative genius and did well with this one. Worth the time to watch.",1382745600,,792,4.705035971223022

It's a classic story of joy and wonder as the backdrop for loss and hardship.  Under the guidance of an expert story-telling director, the characters are protrayed with sublty and depth, the scenery is engaging, the music is lovely, the cinematorgraphy is just  the right mix of expertise and inunendo.  What shines through is a story rich in depth and gratifying for everybody from 3 to 103.

If your kids are studying world culture, or you're interested in it, this movie is also a good jumping off point for discussions of British colonialism, segregation of all sorts, child labor law development, WWI, Indian (as in India) culture & religions, technology and society.",1381968000,,788,4.843283582089552

This movie is one of my favorites of all time. I think, this movie is one of most under-rated movie there is. I have seen this movie when I was a young boy and this movie inspired me ever since. What inspired me is not the movie itself but the main character's (Sarah) characteristics. She has a wild imagination and is very creative, she dreams big, she is positive and caring, willing to stand her ground and best of all, she had a great personality. I always try to be like Sarah especially having wild imagination and being positive.",1381795200,,673,4.349206349206349

97529,5,0790725657,"I have long felt that actors seldom ruin a movie, it is usual the script, editing or directing that makes or breaks the movie, and it is always the actors who get the blame.
o
When you watch the Harry Potter movies, you can tell kid-like acting for what it is, and the lack of concern of the movie's makers in making the movie more of what it could be.

In this version of ""A Little Princess"" you see what quality workmanship in movies can do... here you have a child actress who does not come off as some rank ameture like the Harry Potter child actors did. True there were qirky moments (like in the enactment of the story that Sara tells) but they fit the movie, providing complementations rather than breaking the story. The script was simplistic and even a little sappy but the acting was supperb even then on all performer's parts. Thus the performances were fantasitc, and the editing was on the mark.

All in all, what I thought would be a ""girl-child"" movie turned out to be a movie that ALL audiences could get into, and stay with from the beginning to the end. That is what makes this a movie worth watching, because getting such a well done movie to watch is so rare out of Hollywood these days.",1379808000,,1207,4.36

97689,5,0790725657,"""A Little Princess"" is a hidden gem ostensibly geared for the little girl audience, but which parents will find joyously entertaining as well. It's takes place in a boarding school in WWI-era New York City  not something you'd expect for a children's movie but the kids won't care and adults will find the period settings wonderfully lush down to the smallest details. (If green is your favorite color you've come to the right place). You can find plot descriptions elsewhere, but the great strength of the story  and it's all about the story, isn't it?  is the main character's (Sara Crewe) spirit, kindness and creativity. This is one plucky kid. She's an inspiration to the other girls at the school as well as those viewing this rich, wonderfully shot film. I bought the DVD to watch on Thanksgiving day with my three small nieces, ages 8, 6 and 3, and all but the little one were totally enthralled by it. This is a different type of ""princess"" movie, one that focuses on character rather than crowns and gowns. My nieces were talking about it long after the final credits rolled. Exceptional movies about the trials, tribulations and emotional bonding of young boys (""Stand By Me,"" ""Sandlot"") are more common. Similar movies for girls  not so much. ""A Little Princess"" is one of those rare films that will thrill young girls as well as stand up from all angles simply as an exceptional movie experience.",1355184000,,1409,4.762295081967213

I was a big fan of the Shirley Temple movie as a child, but thought I would try the more modern movie.  This movie lacked heart.  It did not hold true to the book regarding Sarah's interaction and behovior (mainly in her treatment of others.  the book emphasized ""treating others as a princess would treat them"" i.e. being gracious even to those who are not gracious to us). The many vain uses of ""God"" and ""Lord"" were not appreciated either as I highly doubt that language would have been used so loosely in the early 1900's.  I suppose that the movie might have had redeeming elements (I did enjoy the actress who portrayed Miss Minchim), but I thought that the casting of the lead girl was awful.  There were a few moments where she was tolerable, but mostly her lines were said slowly and the same way as the line before it.  I will be renting the old Shirley Temple version soon!",1348876800,7,983,4.315217391304348
97695,5,0790725657,"Yes, I know they changed the ending from the book, making it more like the Shirley Temple version than the Masterpiece Theatre one, but this is still an excellent movie. As a child I loved the novels of Frances Hodgson Burnett and I certainly enjoyed the early movie versions of the novels--especially Margaret O'Brien's 1949 The Secret Garden which also starred a young Dean Stockwell as Colin and a british actor named Brian Roper who will ALWAYS be the best Dickon (in my opinion.) When this film version came out in 1995 I had an 11 and 8 year old and wanted them to feel the magic that these books (and movies) conveyed.

And I think this film does an excellent job of conveying the magic--capturing the audience.  The scenes from India that are laced throughout the film add a beautiful exotic touch. The casting is also excellent. Vanessa Lee Chester as Becky has such an expressive face. The villianess is perfect. But this movie is carried by Liesel Matthews. It was YEARS after my first viewing of this movie that I saw it again and became interested in learning a little more about the actors.  Lo and behold--I discover that Ms. Matthews is, in fact, a REAL princess (one of the heirs of the  Hyatt Hotels founder I believe?) A cool piece of background trivia, but it doesn't change the fact that she nails the portrayal of this character--her deep sadness at her father's departure, her stoic response to her change in fortune, her ability to still find joy in the little things--the snow scene is particularly memorable--her twirling made me want to learn how to spin like that even though I know I'd puke before I made six rotations. I remember reading somewhere that the director said Ms. Matthews brought an inner life to the character and that because she wasn't so ambitious about her career she was ready to have fun with the role. All I know is that she makes an impression--and fifteen years later I enjoyed watching the movie all over again.",1343260800,,1964,4.651296829971182

97712,4,0790725657,"This is from Warner Brothers Family Entertainment, and from what I can tell, I'm not certain it was ever in the theaters. There are no famous actors or actresses in it, although Eleanor Bron, who plays the evil headmistress Miss Minchin, looks familiar. This is a beautifully produced adaptation of the original book, which I remember rather better than many others in this cycle of books made into movies. And like the Shirley Temple version, it ends with Sara reunited with the father who was presumed dead in World War I. In the book, as I recall, the kindly old man next door, or rather his son, adopts Sara. But in modern times, unfortunately, this would be taken as too suggestive of child abuse or at least exploitation.

So it goes. Literature suffers for the sins of man.

Anyway, the stories of India which Sara tells to the other girls are illustrated by the movie, including a ""Prince Rama"" who has blue skin. So we are to imply that he is not merely magical, but a god. Sara, of course, knows little of such details. She is relating the stories her nurse told her in India and embellishing them with her fertile imagination.

It's a story celebrating imagination, but at one point poor Becky says, ""This time I think you have gone too far."" When you see the movie, you may be inclined to agree with Becky, although nominally there is a material-world explanation for what clearly seems to be some very powerful conjure magic.

97718,1,0790725657,"The book is my very favorite ever. It touched me deeply as a child, and even as an adult I dust off my old hardcover and reread it every few years. The movie was a profound disappointment--a cotton candy-like ball of Hollywood fluff more worthy of the Olsen sisters than an adaptation of one of the best novels ever written.

Many details of the story were changed, an overhaul I would endorse if the new stuff were compelling. I personally do not feel movies need to slavishly follow books, as a great director can bring a fresh eye to a classic story, making it his own. But here, every addition or change was pointless and served only to diminish the power of the story. As just one example, in the original story--where hunger was a major theme--Sara gives a starving illiterate scullery maid a meat pie to eat. In this movie, it seems to be about lack of luxury footwear: Sarah gives the servant a pair of Mae West style fur-trimmed slippers with a note that says, ""Let's be friends.""

But it's not the minor details that result in this movie becoming a tragic dumbing down of a great classic, it's the big ones. The main message of the movie is a jawdroppingly meaningless platitude:""every girl is a princess."" The original, by contrast, was about one exceptional girl whose beautiful soul and empathy for others continued even as she was transformed overnight from a rich, pampered elite boarder to a pauper. In the book, her self-control and nobility of spirit made her a princess, no matter her circumstances. Lesson to little girls: It's what's inside that matters.

For those who love the book, I highly recommend the BBC version starring Amelia Shankley. This beautiful, realistic and haunting version brought tears to my eyes. I watched it for the first time last night on YouTube simply because I had to cleanse myself from the insipid Cuar&oacute;n version. I recommend that anyone reading this skip the intermediate step and pass right to the BBC version, which is also available through Amazon on DVD:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Little-Princess/dp/B001T46T8I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Little Princess</a>.",1323993600,16,2169,5.087078651685394

97735,5,0790725657,"I'm in my 20s and it amazes me how much I still love this movie!  It's a sham they don't make movies like this anymore.  I identify with Sara so much, from spending time in India as a child to having a close relationship with my father.

This movie is based off the 1905 British novel of the same name but that's all the two have in common.  I haven't read the book but I know enough to know the movie stands on its own.  The story begins in 1914, the beginning of WWI in British India.  Sara Crewe, the daughter of the wealthy Captain Crewe live there until the war begins and Sara's father enrolls her in the prestigious academy her late mother attended in NYC.  The school is headed by the evil Miss Minchin who is clearly jealous of Sara's relationship with her father.  Sara quickly becomes the most popular student and even makes friends with Becky, the servant girl.  Sara brings joy to everyone she comes across with her imagination and belief that all girls are princesses instilled by her father.  Sara's optimism is tested when she learns her father is killed in battle and the British government controls his assets, leaving Sara penniless and forced to become a servant.

The symbolism and imagery is amazing in this movie.  I love how Sara's telling of the ancient story of the divine Hindu couple Rama and Sita is juxtaposed with the fate of Sara's father and the development of the story.

This movie is a children's movie but people of all ages will love it.  Liesel Matthews shines as Sara, you almost forget she's acting.  The other major roles such as Miss Minchin, Captain Crewe and Becky are played well also.

If you've read the book don't watch this movie expecting it to tell the same story.  This is a story all unto itself.",1300320000,,1750,4.487341772151899
97736,5,0790725657,"This adaptation of A Little Princess is refreshing and beautifully-filmed. Based upon the beloved children's classic, this adaptation begins with Sara Crewe (Liesel Matthews) regaling her Indian friend and Indian nanny with a mythological tale in Simla, India in 1914. Sara's father decides to send her to New York to study at the same boarding school attended by Sara's late mother. Given Sara's wealth, she is given a warm welcome by the haughty and greedy headmistress (Eleanor Bron) whilst Sara's father goes off to fight in the first world war.

Sara's free-spiritedness is stifled by the domineering headmistress, and when tragedy strikes, Sara finds herself being kept on at the school in the capacity of a housemaid where she is treated abominably. Her only happiness comes from her flights of imagination, until Sara is finally able to find true happiness.

The ending diverges from the book, but I felt this was ok given that the audience for such movies are usually young children. My kindergartner was satisfied with the happy ending, though we also know how the book ends (we read it prior to viewing the movie). The lead actress who plays Sara Crewe, Liesel Matthews credibly captures the strong will and determination of the spunky heroine.

The movie apparently teaches that make-believe can transform your world and make it wonderful, though the teaching is undercut by the slapstick ending of a comic romance and elopement.

Fantasy stories can help us see clearly and prepare us for real life, but I don't think this one does so.  After one viewing, the effect was not unlike a large helping of strawberry ice cream in a bowl of beef stew.

97743,4,0790725657,"A Little Princess is based on the 19th century novel entitled ""Sara Crewe: Or, What Happened at Miss Minchin's boarding school."" The story and most film versions are similar but have some intriguing differences including a happier ending which I prefer. This story is so popular that it has inspired several remakes. While this remake is by no means the /best/ I have seen, it is definitely quite entertaining and solid, and visually stunning, if a bit `kidified.'

Sara Crewe (Liesel Matthews)is a likeable young girl raised in India whose father is rich and leaves her at a boarding school in NYC to pursue a career in the army. Her unconventional outlook is quite different than the other girls her age who are all somewhat cowed by the two headmistresses.  Sara befriends several girls, and alienates Lavinia, Miss Minchin senior's favorite. After her father's assets are seized, Miss Minchin does the unthinkable- she forces Sara to become a servant. Sara's hard work and perseverance are not dampened by Miss Minchin's cruel treatment and endear even her worse enemies in the end.

I felt the actress who played the young girls Sarah and Becky were quite well done, as well as Lavinia and Hermengarde. Miss Minchin's senior and junior were well portrayed. I felt the father's acting was rather weak, and did not like the change from London to New York which dampened the `Dickensian feel' that the original possesses.

The school is a beautiful building, though, all shades of rich bottle green, and simply must be seen for the setting alone.

*****Spoiler Section *******

There were things I preferred that they do better
.
Miss Minchin's cruelty to Sara was never explained. I think they should've fleshed out this character a bit, to explain why she was so threatened by Sara and why she was so hard. Likely, she herself had been abandoned and left in a boarding school and had all her dreams and hopes dashed.

The turnabout from Lavina at the end was also sort of `tacked on' and unbelievable. Bullies can and do change. But not without some reason. No reason is given.

I felt the ending was silly with Miss Minchin becoming a chimney sweep.  That probably appeals to the small kids to see the `villain' punished, but I found it silly.

The `princess mantra' got a bit much. I realize Disney made being a princess popular amongst kids, however I think it stereotypes girls and tells them they are `special no matter what' is simply not true. Everyone deserves life, love and happiness and you do not have to be anyone but yourself to get that.

97749,5,0790725657,"I don't care if the 1995 film adaption had major changes that didn't resemble the original book written many years ago. Honestly, this is the best film I've ever watched in my lifetime being that it was my first film I watched on TV after its theatrical release.

Recently watching it on TV, the English-language version of the film is extremely well done. I loved Liesel Matthews' portrayal of Sara Crewe. She had a very sweet and gentle tone and attitude throughout the film, not to mention brave too. In my opinion, I hated how much Minchin treated Sara just because of her imaginations and fantasy, as well as abusing her powers. She's just a 10 year old! Plus, she's a contradictory witch because she is a thief herself by claiming all of Sara's possessions without consent. If she suffered ""financial losses"",she shouldn't go after her wealth. She has to earn it, not steal it, but whatever.

I know what is a real brat and I see one, and its certainly not Sara. Go watch the Spanish dub of 1998's The Parent Trap and you'll see the real definition of a bratty girl. I will always love and enjoy this film no matter what. All of the drama is the reason why I truly enjoy the movie, as well as the sadness present. And btw,

""I am a Princess. ALL girls are. Even if they live in tiny old attics... Even if they live in rags... Even if they aren't pretty, OR young, OR smart, they're STILL princesses. ALL of us. Didn't your father ever tell you that? DIDN'T he?""

I consider this line as a memorable quote. Stand up for yourself if you're in a terrible situation. Don't ever let someone dominate over you.",1246924800,,1610,4.447457627118644

I don't really have much to say in addition to what others have said, but I figured I'd weigh in with some stars to counter the 1 star people.  They may be more devoted to the text of the book than the rest of us.  I come to the film simply as appreciating whether it's a good movie as a movie, and it is.  Much preferable to the other A Little Princess movie (although my wife disagrees).",1221091200,2,428,4.182926829268292
97771,1,0790725657,"Don't waste your money on this mess.  Perhaps someday someone will make a version of 'A Little Princess' that's worthy of the name, but this isn't it.  The only resemblance between this production and Frances Hodgson Burnett's 'A Little Princess', aside from the title, is the fact that it has characters named Sara, Ram Das, and Miss Minchin, and the only reason this gets any star at all is because Amazon will not let me give it no stars.  All the artful camera work in the world cannot make this dreck into proper telling of 'A Little Princess'.  It hasn't the magic.

What was Cuar&oacute;n thinking?  Did he even read the book?  If so, he didn't understand it.  No dead father?  No London setting?  No Cockney Beckey?  No money-grubbing, toading from Miss Minchin?  No fabulous clothes and furs at the front of the line?  No suffering prisoners in the Bastille and no fortuitous finding of the four-pence?  Wrong, wrong, wrong!

Instead of mysterious diamond mines we are given crackers!  Seriously.  Crackers!  Instead Mr. Carrisford's dramatic recovery and Ram Das confessing how he created 'magic', we're given a tawdry police pursuit in the rain and a soap-opera amnesia plot point.  Instead of kind, wise, insightful, introspective and thoughtful Princess Sara, we have foisted on us a prank playing, spiteful retorting, 'curse' slinging pretender to the throne who would never care enough for the general populace to make arrangements to give bread (or even crackers) to the poor.

And we have thrust down our throats repeatedly the mantra that, ""every girl is a princess"", apparently no matter how spiteful, unkind, or common her behavior.  Sarah's princess-like nature was supposed to be what set her apart from the common girls, no matter her material circumstances.  Talk about missing the point.",1219536000,20,1812,5.03030303030303

Being a huge fan of the book, which is my all-time favorite children's book, I was extremely disappointed with this film. If you haven't read the book, you will probably enjoy this rendition very much, but if you love the story, you will feel ripped off. It is a terrific story that does not need the massive amount of tweaking that it endured in this film. In fact, the original tale is all but unrecognizable here.

97774,3,0790725657,"I remember loving Frances Hodgson Burnett's books as a child. Secret Garden was always my favourite, and I own the DVD, and the sequel, Back To The Secret Garden. I found this on DVD ages ago, but it's taken me quite a while to get around to being in the right mood to watch this.

I don't ever remember seeing A Little Princess before. Some scenes seem very familiar, but I don't remember seeing it. I know my mum owns the Shirley Temple version & I definitely haven't seen that one!

I was shocked to discover that Liesel Matthews that was quite a good little actress, and even more shocked to discover that she hasn't done anything since this, apart from Air Force One and something called Blast.

Everyone should know the story, but if not I'll give you a quick recap. It's centres around Sara in 1914, living with her father in India, until he gets called up for the war. She gets sent to a very posh boarding school, where she initially causes some trouble with her daydreaming, and vivid imagination. Gradually she makes friends, until the worst news comes - her dad has been killed.

Look out for the late great Vincent Schiavelli, the lawyer who comes to inform the boarding school headteacher that Sara's father has been killed.

Sara gets kept on as a servant and is made to do some awful work. But she gets through it, quite successfully. Who won't shed a tear as she tackles everything that is put in her way?

A Little Princess is one of those movies that will make any female, no matter what age, feel like a little girl again, believing you're a princess and having everything you could ever want. Not as great as the Secret Garden, but still worth a quick look. Just to know that inside every girl is a princess.",1205107200,4,1729,4.455696202531645

This spiritual and mythological tale, in the novel of the same name, was intended to parallel the events unfolding around Sara and her father.  The point of the great legend of Lord Ram and his beloved was about how no two who love eachother can ever truly be seperated... the mystical blends seamlessly with the emotional in this lush, lovely story on film.

97779,5,0790725657,"I have absolutely adored this film since I first saw it at the age of 8, and it thus holds that special place in my mind, as a sort of magical and daydreamy tale. Upon renting it again recently, I was pleased to find that the cinematography still remained impressive and the stylization and story still highly engaging. Though it may be a tad overacted,I think the general message of the story still shines through. I imagine that it's not solely about deserving to be a ""bratty princess"", but more about building a sense of personal self-worth and realising that everyone is entitled to be treated as, well, a human being, regardless of form or status.

I personally would not listen to the naysayers, whom are namely book purists, and unable to appreciate the film in and of itself, as opposed to just a ""butchered"" extension of the book; as if simply reading a novel entitles you to suddenly become an expert on anything whatsoever.

Lisel Matthews renders a stirring performance as the only daughter of a wealthy military officer.

How Sarah manages, while keeping her humor and her dignity is what makes this revised version so enjoyable. I actually enjoyed it more than the original, starring Shirley Temple(1939).

This one surely does for its as enchanting as it is engrossing, and with a very talented cast of youngsters it stands out as a very well acted children's film.

As Sara, Liesel Matthews does a wonderful job portraying a young sense of maturity as she gets left in a private boarding school while her father is away at war.  The school is run with an iron fist by Miss Minchen (Eleanor Bron), in fact such an iron fist that it had me wondering if anyone could really be that cruel to a child.  Sara bucks Minchen authority, but it's not till ill gotten word arrives regarding Sara's father that Minchen pulls out all the tricks, taking everything Sara owns and putting her in the attic with the servant girl Becky (Vanessa Lee Chester).

The story is sad at times, even downright depressing, but it all works out in the end as all children's movies generally do, and it's one that you can enjoy as a family, not one you suffer through for the sake of your kids.",1167696000,,1208,4.351111111111111
97832,4,0790725657,"Unless you're a die-hard Shirley Temple fan, it would be hard to deny that this was the best version of THE LITTLE PRINCESS ever. Leslie Matthews is superb as Sara, and Liam Cunningham is excellent doubling as both her father, Captain Crewe, and as Prince Rama. The entire cast is wonderful. I love the scenes in the beginning set in India. They set just the right magical mood for the story. I also love the scenes in the attic at Miss Minchin's. They are fun and imaginative. The escape across the rooftops is actually suspenseful in this version - it wasn't in the Shirley Temple film. Most everything is more effective. The Temple version was carrying so much political baggage at the time that it weighed the story down. Thankfully, this one is free to fly. And the ending is far, far more satisfying.

The theme, ""every girl is a princess,"" is universal and timeless, and one that every little girl should hear and believe. And what better way than in this classic tale presented so well by filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron. This is a film for the whole family, and one that I would highly recommend.

97836,5,0790725657,"I read the book when I was a little girl and was enraptured with the world of both Sara Crewe and the stories she would tell of far-away lands and princesses. As always, I heed great caution in books-turned-movie, but in this case it's not needed-- the movie is, I dare say, better than the book.

The first thing that draws the attention of the viewer is the use of color-- vibrant hues engulf the screen and one remembers (if only for a few seconds) what their childhood imagination was like so many years ago. For children who are seeing the movie, the lens of the camera mirrors that of a child's: brilliant and luminous. In fact, the color and lighting throughout the movie is one way this film retains its magic over the years. When seeing the lighting and colors for the film 'Harry Potter III' it's not surprising that the two films have the same great director.

As for the score of the film, the exotic music provides a great juxtaposition to the traditional and sometimes harsh background of England circa 1900's. India's culture is portrayed with its best foot forward (which considering Britain's imperialist attitude towards the nation at the time, isn't such a bad lesson for kids in multiculturalism and diversity).

Both the music and colors of the film make it a good addition to the already-strong theme of the book, which is also enhanced in the movie.

As for the theme, every little kid should heed the lesson of this movie well. While Millennials were raised with the assumption that they are indeed special snowflakes, this book reinforces the notion in beautiful, rich cinematography. All girls are, after all, a little princess.

Aside from promoting self-esteem and individuality, the movie also encourages tolerance, questioning authority, loving one's parents, following your heart, determination, and standing up for your beliefs.

The premise of the movie is simple enough: a young, affluent British girl raised in India is sent to boarding school. Though at odds with the strict, embittered headmistress, she makes friends with the other pupils through telling her elaborate fairy tails. Her life changes immediately when her father, still in India, is injured and presumed dead. Immediately impoverished, Sara must face her new fate as a child servant to the boarding school. It's only when she meets, unexpectedly, an old family friend that she pieces her life back together. Though the movie ends with a more Spielberg-esque ending than the book, the conclusion still left me in tears.

Sara is a young girl who speaks her mind, and shows great compassion to others.  She is a strong little girl.  It is a beautifully filmed movie, with a captivating soundtrack.  It does, as other reviewers have pointed out, stray significantly from the book. But, the ending of this movie is so satisfying!  I think that a PG rating might have been more appropriate, given the two brief (but visually intense) WWI scenes.  It's not a movie for preschoolers (in part because of the thematic elements).  However, I don't think the intensity of this movie is any greater than some Disney films.

The story is about young Sarah, who has been brought up in British India.  She and her widowed father are each other's world.  Sarah thrives in the mystical tropical environment, learning tales of Rama and his consort from her Indian governess.  When WWI breaks out, her father is sent to the front lines.  Before he ships out, he enrolls Sarah in an exclusive American girls' finishing school, run by Mrs. Minch.

When Sarah's father is killed in action, and the cheques stop coming, Mrs. Minch makes the independent girl a servant.  Sarah survives only with the help of a mysterious Indian manservant who takes care of the elderly man across the street.

The plot of the movie is not new -- riches to rags to riches again. Director Alfonso Cuarn and writers Richard LaGravenese and Elizabeth Chandler, however, infuse this traditional story with an overlay of female bonding that pushes Frances Burnett's message further than it could have gone in her day.

This Little Princess for our time is as plucky as Buffy the Vampire Slayer without losing Shirley Temple's innocence. Burnett had the right idea but was restrained to the values of her day. Act like a princess and you will be one. Cuarn must have had a strong mother or sister because his heroine shows her ""princessness"" with strength, honor and courage.

Recently, I was assigned to read a classic novel for school, and by some ironic choice, I picked 'A Little Princess' by Francis Hodgson Burnett. The book awakened the memory of my favorite childhood movie, along with the release of Alfonso Cuaron's direction of the third Harry Potter film.

This movie will never be as good as the original book, and rather than say 'based' upon the novel, it was more 'inspired with many similar portions as the novel.' However, by itself, 'A Little Princess' is one of my favorite movies of all time, and I highly recommend it to any sentimentalist out there who wants to see a very well put together movie.

If only I could put four and a half stars, because while it should be degraded for not staying true to the classic novel, it still is something to always treasure.",1116720000,4,1070,4.34

I was ten when I first saw this movie, and I really enjoyed it.  I'm nineteen now, and I recently came across it playing on tv...and I'm convinced it's one of the finest children's films ever made.  Very few films nowadays are of such quality--there is no stupid humor or gimmicky (not to mention annoying) animal characters, and there is no decline in artistry because this film is aimed at a younger audience.

I believe this is a film families can enjoy together.  It is full of imagination and is visually and musically stunning.  It is also moving...I found myself in tears of joy at the end (I do not cry often in movies, and only a few times in my life have I cried tears of joy).  I believe that this movie can reach both children and adults.

This movie, though perhaps unloyal to the book, is still a classic.  It is full of wonderful messages (for anyone looking to enrich as well as entertain the minds of youngsters--you don't often find films that do both).  It is sweet, hopeful, and fun.

If you read the book you would be amazed at how far they strayed.  1.  The story is supposed to take place in England, not New York.  2.  The story is supposed to take place in Victorian times, not during WW1! 3.  The father really dies, he doesn't come back, and he dies from a fever, not on a battlefield.  4.  There is absolutely no locket in the entire book, yet it is one of the biggest storylines in the movie.  5.  The whole idea of the movie is to examine the riches to rags theme, how people treat you, how you behave like a princess no matter what condition you are in, and treat others the same way, and is a sound portrayal of the lowerclass life in Victorian England; cook, skivies, maids of all work, etc.  And the many homeless children on the street.  We don't even get to see Carrisford and his legal advisors searching for Sarah, all over the world, only to find out she is living in the attic one house over.  In other words, you are your neighbour's keeper.  If you want to see an accurate portrayal of this treasured novel, please watch the 1986 BBC production starring Amelia Shankely.  This movie, cute as it is, shouldn't even bear the title.  Oh, and completely forget her walking a plank to get to the neighbour's house.  That doesn't happen in the book, either.  Nor does the reading and stories at night, nor the attempt to get a necklace back, nor the sister escaping with the milkman, nor the spell on Lavinia's hair.

97905,5,0790725657,"Although not quite as great and visually stunning as the previous Frances Hodgson Burnett film adaptation, The Secret Garden, ""A Little Princess"" is a delightful film to watch any time, anywhere.
The story centers around Sara Crewe, a young girl brought from India by her father to be left under the care of Miss Minchin at her institution for girls in New York.  Sara has all she could ever want at the school, the most delightful riches and confort and a bunch of new friends, however, when Miss Minchin informs Sara that her father has been killed in war, Sara is then turned into a servant.  She is now required to work for the school in order for Miss Minchin to recover the financial losses caused by Captain Crewe's tragic death.

This Warner Brothers film is wonderfully done.  Very detailed surroundings give the movie a believable air that it is set in a more old-fashioned New York.  Liesel Matthews does a magnificent job of portraying the main character, Sara Crewe as well as all the other actors and actrices portraying their own characters.  I have never read the original F. H. Burnett book, although I have a copy and I plan on reading it soon, so I can't really compare the movie to the book.  Either way, the movie is definitely an inspiration to reading the novel, which I expect to be quite different based on other viewers' reviews.  I almost forgot to mention that the movie has beautiful music, nice soft ballads that are a combination of a classical rhythm and an indian-like chorus, as well as the repeated addition of the lovely song, ""Kindle My Heart.""

Sara Crewe, played by Leisel Matthews, is more real than the Sara of the book - she has a mischievious side that makes the movie more fun to watch. The movie is very family friendly...for example, the fact that the school has a young black servant is glossed over, and the adults and girls show no racial prejudice. A few details, including Miss Minchin's final, comic, fate, Amelia's elopement, and the fact that sara is strong enough to pull herself up onto a ledge with only her finger tips to detract from the movie, but other parts more than make up for these. The visual imagery in the movie is beautiful, if somewhat unrealistic in cases, and the soundtrack, especially the song ""Kindle My Heart"" suits the movie exactly. The plot is enhanced with sara's telling of the story of rama and sita- a detail that is not in the book but makes the movie more poignant by paralleling the events in sara's own life.

This movie is based more on the classic Shirley Temple version than it is on the book, which means that it takes some creative liberties.

Sara is a rich girl who lives in India with her father. Her mother was dead. As her father is called to Europe for World War One, Sara is sent to a prestigious boarding school in New York City.

When news comes that her father died in war, Miss Minchin takes everything of Sara's and makes her a servant in the school.

After Sara is locked away, Miss Minchin wipes away a tear, and we see that her father never loved her. It's nice that a villain has more than one layer for a change. When Sara dances in the snow, I think that's one of the most beautiful moments in the movie. And finally, when her father gets his memory back and they hug in the rain.

The school is run by the hard-nosed Miss Minchin (expertly played by Eleanor Bron), who, upon learning that Sarah's father is presumed dead, turns Sarah into an impoverished servant. Like most of Burnett's great stories, this one pits one optimistic, winning child against the overwhelming odds of a harsh world. Sarah's ability to bring joy to the other girls she meets builds her a powerful support network, and in the end her triumph is tremendously moving.

But this didn't stop Warner Brothers' from creating ""A Little Princess"" and I for one am glad they did. Wonderful casting, beautiful visuals and a tearful ending make this a family classic.
Sara Crewe is the daughter of an adoring father; Captain Crewe, a high-ranking army officer stationed in exotic India. Raised under the belief that she and every other woman in the world is naturally a princess, she knows of no hardships in her life. But the year is 1914, and war is on the horizon. With her father called away to fight, Sara is taken to a New York boarding school for girls under the control of the stately Miss Minchin. It is with this matriarch that Sara goes head-to-head with, as their philosophies on life are so utterly opposite. Harbouring resentment and jealously toward the little princess, it is as much cruelty as it is kindess when Miss Minchin employs Sara as a servant girl after news of her father's death.
Suddenly Sara has gone from the girl who has everything to the girl who has nothing. Her faith in magic and storytelling shattered, she refuses to acknowledge the good she has already done in befriending several classmates, and it is up to the very real presence of magic in her life to intervene: watch how one ""coincidental"" gust of wind blows her shawl into the feet of someone who can change her fortunes once more, setting off a chain reaction that just might lead her once more to her father...
Liesel Matthews begins her debut as Sara Crewe, and creates her wonderfully - youthful innocence and wisdom beyond her years combine to create this wonderful character who brings joy to the life of so many, from the distraught Lottie to the servant girl Becky, with whom all contact is strictly forbidden. Her fall from grace to her gradual renewal of faith is just beautiful to watch in a performance not matched until Rachel Hurd-Wood played Wendy in 2003's ""Peter Pan"". Likewise, Liam Cunningham as Captain Crewe plays a devoted father, and I loved how his scenes of war coincided with Sara's storytelling: the magic poison of the demon Ravana becomes mustard-gas in the trenches, and Ravana's roars become the scream of war-planes overhead.
Eleanor Bron excellently plays the aristocratic Miss Minchin, with her exterior of charisma, grace and culture underlying her inner spite and nastiness. However, Bron does not play her simply as the one-dimensional bad guy, and neither is she without her moments of humanity: she obviously finds it difficult in telling Sara that her father has died, and when Sara finally confronts her head-on, Minchin's hastily wiped-away tears tell us better than any words that she never had a father as loving as Sara's was.
Alfonso Cuaron directs ""A Little Princess"" and does so beautifully, from the povery-stricken streets of New York, where a single yellow rose is the only splash of colour, to the bright and exotic worlds of India that appear at intervals as Sara tells the mythological tale of Rama and Sita throughout the movie(and it's interesting to note that the actors that play these two lovers are the same that play Sara's own mother and father!) There are some sublime moments of imagery and beauty captured here, including the flower-sellers in the streets, Sara threading the dew-covered rose in the handle of the door, the black-clad lawyer watching the laughing girls, Sara spinning in the snow storm at her window...I could go on. And as all these scenes are coupled with appropriate music, be it strains of exotic India or a sorrowful choir, they remain in your mind for a very long time. In the simplist possible terms, this is a beautiful movie.
There are some things I didn't particulary like, such as the amnesia plot device that they use on Captain Crewe (though I admit there wasn't really a way around this), the fact that Sara has the upper body strength of a grown man when she manages to hoist herself up on the windowsill by her fingertips, and the completely un-neccessary love story between Minchin's sister and the milkman. However, worst for me was the last scene in which Miss Minchin appears: beforehand we had witnessed the depths of her her wickedness when she lies about Sara's parentage even though Captain Crewe is standing right before her. After the father and daughter's tearful reunion, we see her standing in the rain and turning away, alone with her hate. Her story should have ended here with this powerful scene, but instead we get a truly awful continuation where she is working as a chimney-sweep - a conclusion as implausible as it is silly. I close my eyes and fast-forward every time I see it.
Although ultimately I think I liked ""The Secret Garden"" more, ""A Little Princess"" is its more than worthy follow-up, with almost every particular magnificently created (though incredibly different from the original novel!) See it - it's a thousand times better than any of the rubbish aimed at kids these days (""The Cat in the Hat"" anyone?) and I look forward to seeing more of Alfonso Cuaron's work in the next ""Harry Potter""!",1078444800,3,5507,4.865814696485623

97959,5,0790725657,"Both this movie and the book are very enjoyable, but they are also VERY different, so if you love the book you should probably enjoy the movie as an independent masterpiece.
In the book Sara is a strong-minded girl who believes that she should behave like a real princess, kind and calm and polite, even when facing severe adversities and insufferable people.  She also loves to pretend that things are better than they looks like, which gives her strength in the most desolate circumstances.  Overall the Sara in the book has a very distinct character that makes the book very intriguing and helpful, but she appears so much older than her real age that she doesn't look very realistic (but that does not make the novel less enjoyable).
In the movie, Sara is closer to girls in real life.  She is still as soothing and kind as in the novel, but she does lose her strength and calmness momentarily, even does some mischief, just like an ordinary child.  The prevailing message in the movie is rather ""all girls are princesses, whether they are ... or ..."", which roughly means the same as ""all people are born equal"", as portrayed by Sara's friendship with not-so-clever Ermengarde, not-so-young Amelia, black servant Becky, Indian servant Ram Dass, poor people in the streets, the rats in the attic, and even the not-so-friendly Lavinia at the end.  This theme is very different from the one in the book, but it stands on its own.  In the movie Sara also pretends or ""make believes"", but the portrayal of these things seems to be a bit weak --- anyway it is hard to make these things believable in a movie.  The scene where Sara hugs Lavinia for their reconcilation at the end is really touching, but I don't particular like that end for Miss Minchin.  Making such an old woman do such drudgery is a bit less than humane, and she really isn't THAT bad anyway, just rather snobbish and cold-hearted like many other businssmen.  I prefer that she gets some other job that doesn't involve dealing with other people, such as accounting or typewriting, where the wickedness in her character won't do any harm.
Enough for the movie's plot and you can see that I have mixed feelings about that.  However, as far as picture and sound quality is concerned this movie is really a masterpiece.  The colors are vivid, the music rememberable, and the snow dance scene is beautiful beyond imagination.  These make the movie worthy just for its ""loveliness"".
Note that this review is based on the translated Video CD version of the movie, which is the only version available in mainland China, but I think everything in this review should also be relevent for the original DVD version.",1060214400,,2671,4.720430107526882

Liesel Matthews gives one of the absolute best child performances in film history as Sara Crewe. She looks very striking and attractive, and her voice is so soothing and natural. My favorite scene is the snow dance in the middle of the film. It reminds me of Winona Ryder in the ice dance scene in ""Edward Scissorhands"".

97963,3,0790725657,"I liked this film alot. The scenery and costumes were beautiful, and the acting was brilliant. I especially enjoyed the presence of Ermengarde and Lottie, two wonderful characters from the book who were not in the previous Shirely Temple version. However, I've noticed that the filmmakers borrowed some scenes from Shirley's film, especially toward the end. The climax of the film is very similar to Shirley's: The Indian servant sneaks into their room at night, decorates it all up nicely, and then later Miss Minchin comes in and blames the girls for stealing the stuff. She locks them in their rooms and calls the police. The girls attempt escape by going out on the ledge and into the window of the house next door. Sara makes it but Becky gets caught. Sara hides in the house (in the ST version she manages to get to the hospital) and, while still on the run, happens to find her father, who doesn't remember her. Just as she's about to be caught by the police, her father remembers her and comes to her rescue -- and all is happily ever after.
The original story ends differently. In the book, the Indian servant comes back night after night with new additions and good food, and the girls' newly decorated attic room is never discovered by anyone else. The old man who lives next door is actually a very kindhearted gentleman, as opposed to the bitter, cold man in the film who hardly gives Sara a second glance. He secretly sends Sara some fine, new clothing and Miss Minchin, who believes Sara has some wealthy, distant relative, allows her to wear them and begins treating her more decently, even allowing her to resume her lessons in the classroom. One night, the Indian servant's monkey escapes into Sara's room. She goes over to the house next door to return it, and starts a conversation with the old man. Upon telling him her name, she finds that he is a friend of her father's who has been looking for her for two years. Although Sara's father really does die in the book, the ending is still very happy. While I enjoyed this film, I think the directors should have stuck closer to the original story than the previous film version. Otherwise, great movie.",1051833600,6,2172,4.629533678756476
97964,5,0790725657,"I felt this was a great adapation of a much loved children's book. I enjoyed it much more than the older Shirley Temple version. The acting is good, the costumes and set believable and the interweaving of Hindu mythology that parallels the plot of the movie is nicely done. The one thing I did not like was the portrayal of Indians in the film, but this is also a fault of the book. They fell into the old stereotypes of Indians and India as exotic, mysterious, and mystical. The Indian servant of Mr. Randolph, though central to the plot, reminded me so much of portrayals of black servants and slaves in earlier movies, as servile, loyal, always smiling, wise beyond their station and years, and mysterious. Yet, I liked the racial reconcilliation portrayed in the friendship between Sarah and Becky and like how Becky is adopted by Sarah's father at the end. This is one part where I really loved this version much more than Shirley Temple's version in which so much was left unresolved.",1051747200,,990,4.662857142857143
97975,3,0790725657,"This is a classic children's book that is definitely more appealing to girls since they are the focus of the story, but that has a worthwhile message for anyone. There have been several film versions of this movie made but so far the best one that I have seen is the BBC version. The Warner Bros. version is notable for its dramatization of Sara's stories which are very stylized and lavish and focus on the folktales of Krishna, Vishnu and the like. That is the one aspect of this movie which makes it special besides a brief scene of Sara's childhood in India. However, I felt that changing the nationality of Sara, the oversimplification of Miss Minchin as a classic Hollywood bad guy with no redeeming qualities, and the pathetic slapstick romance of her sister Amelia detracted greatly from the overall story.
Most importantly of all, the focus of this movie on the supposition that ""All girls are really princesses."" undermined what I have always felt was this story's greatest strength. Sara treated everyone as equals and rose above her difficulties because of her belief in herself. She voiced this belief in terms  of being a princess but the basis was really that if someone is special and has advantages then they have a responsibility to those around them to treat them fairly and to share those advantages whenever possible. Someone who is truly special does not need to belittle others and can trust themselves to handle whatever life may give them. Saying that ""All girls are really princesses."" is something which, in my opinion, hands worth to people on the basis of merely being female and thus removes the necessary value of the need to earn that privilege. It is a syrupy sentiment that says that females are special because they are female, a supposition which has been a part of the whole ""project self-esteem"" debacle and its feminist counterpart. A more useful idea, I believe, is that all people are capable of being special and have special qualities within them which, if they develop them and work to make the best use of them, will naturally help them to create the person they want to be. I think that the BBC version of this movie handles that aspect of the story much better than this one does.",1050364800,9,2227,4.724935732647815

In the history of film, a handful of pictures stand out for the jaw-dropping, revolutionary power of the vision that their directors brought to the screen.  Think of ""Napoleon"", ""The Scarlet Empress"", ""Citizen Kane"", ""Breathless"", ""2001"".  Alfonso Cuaron brings the same intensity to bear in his production of ""A Little Princess"", creating a masterpiece whose stampeding procession of set pieces knocks the viewer to the floor .  Awash in blazing light, burnished golds, and vernal greens, the film's mystical India and menacingly enchanted New York create an intoxicating atmosphere for the Blakean story of a little girl horribly lost in an unforgiving world once she is bereft of her beloved father.  Young Sara's gifts for imagination and compassion war against Miss Minchon's brutish system of materialism and grinding practicality in a story that is accessible to children but offers higher truths for the adult.  The screenplay, awash in references to the ""Ramayana"" and with hints of pantheistic intuition, compliments the Shelleyan Romanticism of the visuals.  Cuaron and his cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki achieve a kind of pictorial radiance matched only by the Bertolucci of ""Little Buddha"" and ""Beseiged"".  The incisive editing, the soaring cranes, create an exhilarating sense of wonder:  the unbelievable audacity of the scene in which Sara consoles a little girl hurls us over any objection to the sentimentality  by sheer creative authority-- the swooning poetry of the images and words forces our belief.  Long before the famous Snow Scene, the viewer is wheeling over with  intoxication at the beauty of this film.

97981,5,0790725657,"I saw this movie on TV maybe a year or two after it came out in 1995. I remember enjoying it back then but I had since forgotten much about it. Thankfully, it's now available on DVD from Warner Brothers and it should be your very next movie purchase.
If you haven't seen this movie yet order this DVD asap and when you watch it take the phone off the hook to make sure there are no interruptions, then gather the whole family around the TV and enjoy a truly family movie masterpiece. However, this is not a kids movie, there are many mature themes presented, in a gentle way though. And there is a scary monster briefly in a fantasy scene. Probably best for kids 8+ (but others will have different opinions on this).
At the end of the movie mom will be crying but this is no cause for alarm- these will be very happy tears. Don't be surprised if Dad is holding back tears too.

The credits at the beginning have the style of being for a children's movie. I was wondering if this was for children only. Then, the opening scene looks like something from a stage play and I thought if this is the way the whole movie looks I wasted my money. But that first scene was a fantasy scene (as you realize later). What happens next is the movie itself starts and within moments stunning beautiful cinematography of a river or lake in India with a huge Buddha head in the water and two children sitting happily on top of it! When a stunning scene like this is early in a film, you know you're watching something special.
In brief, the movie is set in 1914 and little girl, Sarah, is sent to a boarding school in New York, New York (after spending all her life in India) when her father must fight for Britain in the First World War. The girl is played by the beautiful and radiant newcomer Liesel Matthews. DVD notes say that thousands of girls were auditioned for the part of Sarah.
The whole movie is told from Sarah's point of view and there are very few movies that have true cinematic magic, but this one does. For example, the scene where she parts with her father is one of the most tender and touching moments I've ever seen in all cinema. Several other scenes are spell-bindingly magical too.
Sarah becomes friends with most of the other 20 or so girls in the boarding home and soon teaches them how to awaken their sense of imagination, tells them wondrous stories of mythical India, and that ""all little girls are princesses"". However, the wicked and stern headmistress, played to perfection by Eleanor Bron, will have none of this imagination stuff from the girls. In fact, they can't even talk during dinner!
As scenes unfold, so does the cinematic magic. The music score is also wonderful and is brilliantly effective in the movie climax- which I now consider one of the greatest moments in all movies.
The cast is perfect. Several of the girls seen in the movie went on to other movies and TV shows. Although they are seen very briefly, take a close look and you'll see:
-Camilla Belle (only 9 years old here). She appeared in Jurassic Park: The Lost World and you've seen her in other movies and TV shows too.  Too bad she's only seen very breifly in this movie.
- Kaitlin Cullum (9 years old here too). She played the part of Elizabeth in TV show Grace under Fire (1993) and was Katelyn in Galaxy Quest movie. She was also played the part of Eve Plumb/Jan Brady in TV movie ""Growing Up Brady"" (2000). She also won Best Young Actress Under 10 in the Television 1994-1995 17th Young Artists Awards.
-Heather DeLoach (as Ermingarde) is the ""Bee Girl"" from the Blind Melon music video
The DVD is double sided- TV format on one side, wide-screen on the other. You get three theatrical trailers- the one for this movie and two from Secret Garden (1993 and the black & white trailer from the 1949 movie). You also get production notes and brief bios with still pics.

Well no. My Dad didn't call me a princess, and that's because I'm a guy. But after seeing this movie, I was really beginning to wish I was. ""A Little Princess"" is quite simply amazing. It is the most magical family movie there is. I just can't recommend it high enough. I saw this at the movie theater, 7 times and it is quite easily my favorite film of all time.
Set in 1914, ""A Little Princess"" tells the story of a girl called Sara who goes to a strict boarding school while her father from England goes to fight the War. The school is run by a mean spirited head teacher called Miss Minchin. From the start, Miss Minchin is jealous of Sara who considers herself to be a princess. After all, her Papa has told her that she will always be his little princess. Despite the harshness of Miss Minchin, Sara continues to fill those around her with magic as she tells stories to them of a beautiful princess and her prince.
The emotion begins early in this movie, firstly being when Sara and her Papa say goodbye as he goes into war. Midway through the movie Sara hears that her Papa has been killed in battle. I have to say, when I watched this I was gone. Ok I wasn't gone yet, but I was holding the tears in. Actress Liesel Matthews who plays Sara is so genuine, and director Alfonso Cuaron definitely brings out the best in her. It is at the end which is complimented by the music of Patrick Doyle, that I really did feel a few tears going by my face. It happened just after Sara realized she may truly have lost her father forever.
The DVD itself just has a trailer and it would be great if it had more extras, but the moie is just so wonderful that you have to buy this DVD. In addition, the subtle Dolby Digital 5.1 is just right for a movie such as this.

They both live together in India. Then her father is called to battle, and Sarah is sent to a boarding school in New York, where her mother used to attend as a girl. When her father is killed in battle and there's no one to pay for Sarah's school fees, the cruel headmistress forces Sarah into a life of poverty.

A child watching this movie sees Sara practicing all these attributes and is treated to lush and artful cinematography that, during a few of the scenes, nearly takes your breath away.  It reminded me of some of the Latin American literature classified as ""magical realism"".  I am grateful that Alfonso Cuaron has directed a family movie that I, the parent, will enjoy watching again and again.  I think that the children watching this film will also benefit on many different levels.  The film may be different from the written version but it illustrates an important topic with its treatment of the classic story; how it is possible for people/children to face adversity.",1023667200,,844,5.1838235294117645

All of the elements are flawless - it has great tech stuff like music, production design, & editing as well as an excellent script, a heart-warming/breaking story and amazing performances (Liesel Matthews makes the best debut for a pre-teen actress this side of Natale Portman in 'Leon').
  I know many people have pointed this out, but the imagery in this film is incredibly, incredibly gorgeous.  Every scene is glorious to look at, esp. Sarah's b-day party and the 'breakfast' surprise, as well as all the 'India' sequences...  Cuaron has a great eye and I'm dying to see his next film, Y Tu Mama Tambien, as well as his Great Expectations.

Leisel Matthews is a very good actress, and she does a great job at portraying young Sara Crewe, the little girl who is sent to a strict boarding school by her gentle and loving father, who must go serve in the war. When Captain Crewe (Sara's father) is believed to have been killed in battle, Sara is devastated, but she decides to have as much optimism as she can. Though the coldhearted mistress of the school, Miss Minchin, forces Sara to become a servant, Sara's spirit does not die. Miss Minchin takes away all of Sara's pretty things and attempts to take her ""princess"" title away, but Sara will never give up belief that she and all other girls are princesses, mainly because her beloved father has told her so. Sara develops a close bond with Becky, who is also a servant at the school. Throughout the movie, Sara's strength and her kind nature will enchant everyone who watches the film. It is truly an uplifting story. It's my favorite version of ""the little princess,"" and it definitely deserves 5 stars. I'd give it 10 if I could.",1011139200,16,1107,4.567839195979899

What I wanted most to say about the movie is that it is a good one for children who have experienced the loss of a parent in their lives.  There is a scene where Sara seems to have lost almost everything, and has no one left in the world to care about her.

When she is left at a boarding school while her father is fighting for the British, she charms everyone with her character. But when she has false word that her father is dead, she is forced to work as a servant or be thrown in the streets. I absolutely love the way she is reunited again with her supposedly deceased father at the end of the movie.

98029,3,0790725657,"This was one of my favourite books when I was a little girl. The movie is well done, but I was disappointed at the ""Hollywood ending"" that replaced the original ending of the book; it's unnecessary and it doesn't ring true.  In the book, although Sara is adopted by the wealthy man next door, who turns out to be her father's business partner and who restores her fortune, her father doesn't return. She becomes comfortable and secure again, and her efforts to be good and brave during hard times have made her a better person, but things will never be as they were before. To pretty this up with a dramatic last-minute reappearance, as was done in this film, is an injustice both to the book and to the audience; the best children's books don't avoid the question of irretrievable loss, but face it squarely and so help young readers to learn that although great losses will occur, we can survive them.  Sara's father doesn't return; Beth March dies; Sykes kills Nancy; these leave us saddened but not destroyed. Too bad that this film ditched this sombre but true ending for an over-dramatised, all-but-incredible, sugar-plum ending; it's a good film, but it could have been a great one.",999734400,121,1189,4.711538461538462

98054,1,0790725657,"I had such high hopes for this film when I heard that it was being 'defended' against major changes (such as the introduction of a love interest). Alas, instead it merely underlined what ""Little Women"" had already shown me: be wary of movies based on books you love. -A few of the changes made- the transposition of the setting from England to America, the recasting of Becky the scullery maid as a Black slave girl- were merely interesting differences; but the damage done to character and story by other 'revisions' was enormous.

This movie took one of my very favorite characters and destroyed her. The whimsical, Hans Christian Anderson-type fairy tales which she tells in the book are changed, in the movie, to stories that are darker, brooding, and rather scary, styled after Hindu myths. All the imaginative ideas which, in the book, she comes up with herself, are spoon-fed to her by her father in the movie. Sara Crewe of the book is a heroine's heroine; the girl portrayed in the movie is obnoxious, bratty and rude; plus, they changed the entire story by changing the ending. Lastly (and, for me, worst) the movie completely redefines the whole meaning of being a princess: in the book it's what gives Sara the strength to continue being kind, courteous, loyal, caring, and generous to others, even when those others are nasty to her. In the movie, we are told, EVERY girl is a princess- no matter how much like a common street beggar she behaves.

I also like the variety of the adult characters. Too often in children's films, there are two kinds of adults: Oblivious parents and Mean Old Authority Figures. This movie has an attentive father, a wistful pushover, a kindly mystery man, a milkman lover ... even the ""evil schoolmistress"" has a human side that she denies.
This is really an intelligent movie that doesn't talk down to the audience. I was absorbed into Sara's world. Every time I watch it I cry, and I feel very good about life.",991008000,3,763,4.496402877697841

The movie opens with some stunningly beautiful scenes from India and all too suddenly Sara Crewe must leave with her father who is being called away for military duties. Sara has to go live in a New York boarding school. Through her experiences she learns to survive in the world and takes each day as it comes. Her vivid imagination is a pure delight and when she tells her magical stories, they are played out in a fairy tale like way onscreen. This contrasts with her real life at the school.

Sara's fun-loving spirit does get her into trouble from time to time. Overall, she is just used to living with her father and being free to do mostly what she likes. In her new school she has to follow many rules. She draws strength from her father's words to help her believe in herself. He tells her that she will always be his little princess.

A wonderful movie which shows that if we make the best of our circumstances, we will be blessed in the end. Five stars for storytelling magic!

As was written on the VHS, ""this movie is magic and stunningly beautiful!"" and it is. Although I am not Indian, nor am I aware of any of the Hindu tales, Sara Crewe was very aware of the tales in the film.

The disc comes in widescreen and full screen versions, as well as 3 trailers.  So, I put the disc into my machine and enjoyed this beautiful film.  The sound was remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1, and although this is not your shoot-em-up, explosive film that really takes advantage of 5.1, this film uses its surround elements quite nicely.  Sometimes the vocals sound a little too tinny (too much treble), but overal the stereo separation and ambiance is soothing and pleasant.

Liesel Mathews reknews my faith in child actors-  she does an excellent job of making Sarah a sympathetic, sorrowful, and yet  cheerful fully three-dimensional character. The scenery is lovely- the  protrayl of India as being a lush, beautiful place is such a relief form  another movie ''The Secret Garden's'' protrayl of India as being a dark,  dirty place. Sarah comes alive with imagination and insight- and her  selflessness shines through despite her rich upbringing. But what I really  liked about this film was it's telling of the Hindu epic ''Ramayana''- in  scenes parallel to the plot of the movie. The story is symbolic both of  Sarah's Indian influence, and her struggle to free herself from evil. Truly  a ''story girl'', Sarah spark and quiet wisdom are shown throughout the  film. Lottie is also portrayed well, the actress does a wonderfl job of  showing a spoiled though well-meaing young girl. Emengarde, the ''stupid''  girl also comes alive with quiet pain, and selflessness. Lavinia is  portrayed as a spoiled, selfish, but also quite sympathetic character. But  what the film does, is shed light on the cruel Miss Minchin, and her  abusive upbringing. The world inside the Boarding School is well-portrayed  as closed off, privelleged, and yet following a ''tradition'' of duty and  not imagination. In scenes both heartbreaking and hilarious, the movie  springs to life- and shines with true friendship, curiosity, and love.  Worth seeing, and definately family-oriented.",962323200,2,1668,5.0625

As an adaptation of Frances Hodgson Burnett's beloved classic,  however, this film doesn't come very close. As the 1939 Shirley Temple  version, this ""LP"" simply appropriates the characters' names and  the vague situation. Most of the action in the second half of the  film--including the discovery of the attic room, the ashes incident, the  wild chase and the ending--are from the Temple picture, not the  book.
Similarly, the characters deviate significantly from those  described in the book. Liesel Matthews is excellent, but she does not have  the personality of Burnett's Sara Crewe. Amelia Minchin and Lavinia are  both given more sympathetic portrayals, and so forth.
