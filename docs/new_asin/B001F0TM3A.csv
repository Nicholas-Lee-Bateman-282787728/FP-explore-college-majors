3558790,4,B001F0TM3A,"A nice psycho-thriller of Hong Kong cops fighting the drugs, stretching, a reviewer could say, into Thailand and different bedrooms of characters' involved.

A touching story of opportunities FREE people supposed to have.",1275782400,,221,5.696969696969697
3558791,1,B001F0TM3A,"this movie was not what i expected, in other words, it kinda sucked there was absolutely no action whatsoever",1271203200,,109,4.7894736842105265
3558792,3,B001F0TM3A,"The front cover said 'nominated for best action choreography' but there was no action to choregraph! There was one five minute action scene and can hardly be considered a shootout unlike what one reviewer said. There was good drama pertaining to hard drug use, but it's hard to fully appreciate the acting in a foreign movie because of the language. I buy these Hong Kong movies, especially Dragon Dynasty releases, for the action, so I was disappointed.

I've been spoiled by Hard Boiled, The Killer, A Better Tomorrow I and II, Tragic Hero, Fist of Legend, and others. Check those out for some action.",1248134400,6,603,4.798076923076923
3558793,4,B001F0TM3A,"This is a deep look into the insidious perversion of drugs, from the gangsters who supply them, to the cops who work to catch them, and to the lowest rung of the ladder, the users. At first I was let down expecting another HK action extravaganza, but eventually got drawn into the story. The nightmare seems more real when it isn't varnished over with fights, chases and shootouts. Recommended.",1247097600,6,394,4.72463768115942
3558794,3,B001F0TM3A,"A good movie overall, but if you want to buy this movie for its action, don't.  I did because I thought there would be intense shootouts and gun battles, but there wasn't any.",1244851200,,175,4.303030303030303
3558795,5,B001F0TM3A,"Andy Lau, who's always good, works his way up as an undercover cop until he is so good the boss wants him to take over the gang's heroin trade! Intrigue, double crosses, and lots of soul-satisfying shootouts ensue. There's really no way to know whether Lau will pull out his badge and take down the enterprise, or whether he will turn over a new leaf and take on the gangland leadership role he's been offered. (Of course, you can guess...) Wildly creative cinematography and well-choreographed fights put this film right up there on the top of Hong Kong crime flicks.",1242604800,4,568,4.69
8300185,3,B001F0TM3A,"If you are looking for martial arts, this is not a movie to buy. I saw Danial Wu in ""Into the Badlands"" and i thought this would be a cool movie with him. I guess it was okay in terms of story, it is more of a cop drama than a martial arts move by way of that there is no martial arts in this movie. Half the scenes shown on the cover did not happen in the movie, if might look martial arts-like but its not.",1510272000,,408,3.7011494252873565

8300190,4,B001F0TM3A,"If you buy this film based on its being a Dragon Dynasty title, you may think you're getting a Chinese martial arts film. I did. But that's not what Protege is. This is a gritty, violent, powerful, bloody crime saga, following an undercover Hong Kong cop placed deep in a heroin-distribution organization. Not only are there no real martial arts scenes, there are very few action scenes at all. The only one that comes to mind is the attack on a heroin lab--nothing sexy here, just brutal, stomach-churning violence.

This film gets at the agony of being deep undercover, of seeing people dying from addiction, and at coping with the self-conflict that comes of betraying people whom you've become close to. The bad guys here are bad guys, no doubt. But they have dimension and emotion and are not purely evil. You almost feel sorry for them.

So, if you're willing for forgo the chop-socky action, and want something with real depth and power, be sure to give Protege a try.",1427414400,,975,4.695906432748538

8300192,5,B001F0TM3A,"24 hours after viewing ""Protege"" I already found myself comparing my favorite characters in the film to people which I had, & do know.  My mind would wander back to scenes & images that would reappear. I would remember a line here & there. Sort of a movie 'haunting'.
The story may not be new, but the characters are indeed very different. Amazingly human, low-keyed in a way that I never would have recognised was lost in many Hollywood films. They simply don't choose to tell a story like this in such a manner, instead condemning them to a type of Mothergoose fairly tale world where everything is bigger than real life.
Clearly there are times when real life is exactly what a story needs.  The story,  the conflicts,  the characters are enough.  Less is more.
Some would call it under-acting. Maybe the problem is that we are so accustomed to over-acting which is what we want at times. Meanwhile there is enough sumptuosness to watching dealers riding elephant-back through poppy fields  carefully photographed & fine sound mastering to satisfy your estoteric whims,  but like the rest of the film, none of this is allowed to get in the way of the basics. And this story about people, undercover relationships (thus the title ""Protege"") is enough. Recommended.",1378425600,,1266,4.806451612903226
8300193,5,B001F0TM3A,It was good to know that America isn't the only people that can write and produce great movies like this one. Thanks another great movie added to my collection.,1370563200,,160,4.551724137931035
8300194,5,B001F0TM3A,"I thought this was an excellent Hong Kong drama that tells the tale of an undercover cop, Nick, played by Daniel Wu who is working for the best heroin boss in Hong Kong named Kwan played by Andy Lau.  Kwan is in failing health suffering from diabetes and in need of a new kidney so he must find a protege to take over his business and he turns to Nick to teach all aspects of the business to. It has some thrilling moments but also explores the darker, evil side of heroin abuse for what it is, a descent into hell and eventually an untimely death.  There are some interesting scenes shot in Thailand of the boss and his protege riding elephants through the poppy fields with the Thai women working the fields for a pittance. So you are shown all aspects of heroin addiction, from the addicts to the scarey life of an undercover cop trying to stop the swelling tide of addiction and arrest the various big players including his own boss, all the way back to the growers of the poppies and producers of the heroin. The acting was very good and the plot was exciting and yet easy to follow. I did not even recognize Louis Koo in his part as a drug addicted boyfried of Nick's neighbor. Andy Lau's drug boss part is somewhat subdued and you feel a certain amount of sympathy for his character as it is not the typical harsh, cruel drug boss.  If you are looking for non stop action then you best look to other films but if you want an engaging, somewhat gritty drama on all aspects of the heroin trade then this is your movie. Highly Recommended.",1341273600,,1543,4.3321799307958475
