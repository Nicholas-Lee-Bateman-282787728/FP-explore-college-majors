2876112,2,B000RXZILG,"It does have its funny moments, but it's not laugh-out-loud funny like Little Britain (which I recommend).

It's kind of boring.",1208044800,2,128,5.095238095238095
2876113,5,B000RXZILG,"Catherine Tate is a rare gem. Incredibly talented and intelligent in real life, her ability to transcend class and educational boundaries enables her to create such sharp satire. She is truly amazing! As much as I think that an American audience will be able to appreciate and enjoy the impressionistic humour, only Brits will really be able to understand the reflection of pure, classic and complex British humour. Thank Goodness for Catherine Tate; all is not lost!",1202169600,2,467,5.077922077922078
2876114,5,B000RXZILG,"Feeling down? Can't seem to smile about anything? Then watch this hysterically funny, bodacious series. Where has she been all my life? I was introduced to this show on BBC America and now just must see every show. In my worst of times, I cannot help but laugh my socks off, roll around on the floor holding my belly in uncontrollable laughter. Catherine Tate is a brilliant one-woman dynamo. The entire ensemble is perfection. It must be brutal trying to get through a skit. They surely have the most fun of anyone on film. Please do not deny yourself this joy. If you are a fan of The Thin Blue Line then your funny bone will be tickled again.",1200009600,,645,4.428571428571429
2876115,5,B000RXZILG,This DVD was given as a Christmas gift and the person was delighted with it.,1198972800,,76,4.133333333333334
2876116,5,B000RXZILG,"Catherine Tate is a completely transformational performer. In this collection she brings us sad-sack Elaine Figgis, the line-dancing Brit baker whose e-courting of a death-row Texan is at once pathetic and hilarious; Nan Taylor, the outrageous Granny with a foul mouth and a keen wit; and the apotheosis of high school apathy, Lauren, who is perpetually ""bovvered"" by any kind of authority. Treat yourself, and check out this extraordinarily sharp, insightful and funny collection.",1197763200,5,481,5.513513513513513
2876117,5,B000RXZILG,"Ever since I found Ms. Tate, it was love at first sight.  She is extremely funny and talented and I thoughly enjoyed this DVD.  So worth getting.",1194048000,6,145,4.333333333333333
2876118,5,B000RXZILG,"This has got to be one of the funniest shows on television. The British know how to do good series, you just don't get that from American television. nan is the best television character in the history of television. BUY THIS DVD!!!!",1190505600,7,233,4.571428571428571
2876119,5,B000RXZILG,"Our friends in the UK have been going on and on about Catherine Tate for ages so we were delighted when the show debuted on BBC America just recently.  We were not disappointed!

Catherine Tate is a very talented comedian who is convincing as the foul-mouthed Nan, the typical teenager who wants to know if she is being disrespected, and the posh ""too much time on her hands"" mother and house wife ""Horrors - down to the last 4 litres of extra virgin olive oil"".  The funny thing is that I can identify with each of these characters as either family members or someone I know.

We are so glad that the boxed set is to be released in days.  Looking forward to seeing the shows without all the American adverts!  For those who aren't familar with the various British accents, you may have to ""cheat"" and use your closed captioning option.  The humour won't be lost though.. Cheers!",1190160000,8,879,4.490566037735849
2876120,5,B000RXZILG,"Catherine Tate may be one of the newest talents to arrive from England. Her show is not yet broadcasted in America as it should have. Regardless, it is one of the funniest shows that I have seen in a long time and Catherine Tate is becoming one of my television favorites. She can transform herself from a young flygirl teenager to an annoying old woman.

 In between, she plays the woman who is frightened of her own shadow; the mall information lady who is useless, haven't we met one of them; the woman who can't get drunk enough to have sex with her boyfriend; the drunk real estate agent who makes crude remarks, and others. Anyway, the six episodes are really wonderful to watch over and over again. As somebody who got the first season of the show, I hope other American anglophiles will take a chance on Catherine Tate. She's one of Britain's funniest leading ladies.

If you can't watch it on your DVD player, I was stunned years later to watch it on my Apple laptop if you change the Region set up. Still a great show. I can't understand why Catherine Tate hasn't made the Queen's Honours List for her services to comedy and entertainment.",1187049600,22,1149,4.514423076923077

2876125,5,B000RXZILG,"This show is so freakin'  funny! I laughed through just the entire DVD.My husband thinks it is hilarious too. We both really like Ab Fab and Katherine Tate kind of reminds me of Jennifer Saunders except she is even funnier! We bought all three seasons and were bummed when we popped season 3 into the DvD player and it was region 2 but we will just hook a laptop up to the tv and watch it that way I guess. Wish this series had been on alot longer. I have a
So enjoyed Katherine Tate in Doctor Who and Much Ado About Nothing.",1407024000,3,525,4.097087378640777
2876126,5,B000RXZILG,"I enjoyed the show, can't wait for #3 to be in the correct format for the USA
Love the show",1384646400,,91,3.6
2876127,5,B000RXZILG,"I have recently finished watching ""The Catherine Tate Show"" on Netflix, and I was hooked from episode one.  Each character is different from the last, and they all have their signature catchphrases.  Some people say that they grow tired of some of the catchphrases, but I love them!  I always ask people ""am I bovvered, though?"" or ""Who dear? Me dear? Gay dear? No dear.""  I cannot wait for my item to arrive!  I highly recommend that everyone purchase these dvds!  The only thing I wish that was offered was a completed series box set for region 1.",1365120000,,549,4.551020408163265
2876128,5,B000RXZILG,"I received it right before I was expecting it!! Its a great show and I highly recommend it! Was never opened, nor damaged at all, it was shipped nicely!",1363478400,,152,4.275862068965517
2876129,3,B000RXZILG,This one was ok. We did not like it as much. So it was just OK.This is not fun. This was not to our liking.,1361318400,2,107,3.32
2876130,4,B000RXZILG,"I got The Catherine Tate Show full collection series DVD set, but season 1 blew me away. It's hilarious! My favorites are AGA SAGA WOMAN and PAUL AND SAM. After having watched a whole series of Tate starring as quick-mouthed and sassy Donna Noble in Doctor Who, I had to check out why she was so funny. Her LAUREN skit is also iconic. I am not so much a fan of NAN for some reason, but there are some other quick one-off characters that round out the DVD for Series One. Tate's strong suit is getting into her different characters and completely becoming them. If you do like physical, dress-up costume, over-the-top comedy, then I suggest you try this DVD to get a flavor of the humor.",1354320000,,686,4.409448818897638
2876131,5,B000RXZILG,"Glad we are able to purchase Stateside!  If you enjoy British comedy such as Absolutely Fabulous, Little Britian or French & Saunders, then get this DVD!",1353628800,,153,4.884615384615385
2876132,5,B000RXZILG,This show is absolutely hilarious if you enjoy British humor. :) I bought it because I loved Catherine in Doctor Who and I'm glad I did!,1336003200,,136,4.269230769230769
2876133,4,B000RXZILG,"If you enjoy ""Little Britain"" and "" French and Saunders"", you will appreciate this comedy show. Catherine Tate is very versatile in her characters, and you will really appreciate her sense of humor.",1294704000,,198,5.03030303030303
2876134,5,B000RXZILG,I really purchased this as a gift for a good friend that obtains this from the library because of cost. He was astonished and I made his Christmas.....he is well traveled/sophisticated and adores this series (east coast) - not obtainable that I'm aware of on west coast. Thanks for letting me share.,1261785600,,299,4.769230769230769
2876135,5,B000RXZILG,Catherine Tate has very little presence in the US but her humor certainly transcends any national boundaries.  Not only is she funny but her acting abilities far surpass most other comics.,1246320000,2,188,5.064516129032258
2876136,1,B000RXZILG,"I'm not writing this review trying to insult this show or any of it's viewers. People are entitled to like what they want.

However I must say this is the most dissapointed I have ever been in a comedy/sketch comedy series. The opening joke in this show was the only funny one in the entire series.

Sitting through sketch after sketch of the same characters telling the exact same ""jokes"" over and over each episode was painful.

Catherine Tate doesn't seem to realise that a joke is only funny once, twice, maybe three times. She grinds her jokes into the ground. She makes one sketch for each character and then just writes that same sketch again with a few words changed, then she does it again, and again, and again.. Until the series is finished.

It's uninspired, unfunny and downright painful insult to anyone who wants to be surprised or amused by fresh, original comedy.",1239667200,5,880,4.658064516129032
2876137,5,B000RXZILG,"I am a Catherine Tate Fan so I cannot say enough ""good"" about her comedy.  I laugh from my gut with her show.  Amazing actress who can get into character and make her skits so real.  Highly recommend if you were someone who enjoyed Carol Burnett type skits.",1239321600,,257,4.3125
2876138,4,B000RXZILG,"Catherine Tate is very talented. Her characters are hilarious, and her ability to do such different types is amazing. Her supporting cast members are also quite good.

Americans may have some difficulty understanding the accent(s), but for the most part her scenes translate well. It seemed to me that there were sketches that had been cut from television so it was nice to see some new things. However, I was puzzled as to why there were no extras included on the dvd. I would have loved to have seen interviews, bloopers, etc.",1231027200,,528,4.739130434782608
2876139,5,B000RXZILG,Catherine Tate is simply hilarious and the DVD of the first season is a perfect oppurtunity to see this genius invent a host of characters. She can be shocking but that's most of the fun; waiting for something just crazy. Watching this with Close Captioning might be helpful.,1216944000,,275,4.75
2876140,5,B000RXZILG,"At my local convenience store, I tried to convince them that this DVD was valid as American currency.  It turns out I was wrong.",1215734400,2,128,4.333333333333333
8202961,1,B000RXZILG,Im not sure if they are all like this or just the one I received but it wasn't marked that it wasn't in the US format,1523664000,,117,3.5384615384615383
8202962,4,B000RXZILG,"For me, Series One is somewhat uneven although generally I like it. I much favor certain skits like those involving posh people over others which can border on the tiresome. Catherine Tate is undoubtedly very talented, and I'm amazed at the talent of the children who appear in skits.",1516406400,,284,4.816326530612245
8202963,5,B000RXZILG,She is hysterical.  Happy to have this.,1512604800,,39,4.571428571428571

8202965,5,B000RXZILG,"So many gems, just great shows and great characters. Funnier than the tracy ullman show, sorry if that is blaspemous to some. And she was so nice at Awesomecon!",1507334400,,160,4.551724137931035
8202966,5,B000RXZILG,Make this series for regional 1,1486512000,,31,4.333333333333333
8202967,5,B000RXZILG,"I loved this show more than most anything I had seen in a while. It's quite unassuming at first but Katherine Tate is a comedy genius. I would compare this to the Tracy Ullman show but R rated. And if you are too young to remember The Tracy Ullman show then maybe you could possibly compare this to Amy Shumer, if Amy was smart and funny and didn't only rely on dick and vagina jokes to make people laugh.",1476576000,,405,4.139240506329114
8202968,5,B000RXZILG,"Catherine Tate RULES!! One solid laugh. Some of the best ""oddball"" characters I've seen. Is Series 3 EVER going to be released for Region 1?",1475452800,,140,4.64
8202969,5,B000RXZILG,Good show,1440806400,,9,4.0
8202970,5,B000RXZILG,"Here's a sample of British humor! Indeed, Catherine Tate, subject to any role. In this humorous show, she skillfully transforms into different characters. And it's worth noting that she does it so skillfully that I often could not recognize her. Very funny and interesting to follow her roles. Catherine is able to show an independent teenager. This teen always gets into a verbal argument with the teachers. Here are my likes are often on the side of her heroine. But so much interest and laughter causes her role in the image of an old woman. Catherine really talented and professional actress. I looked all the seasons of her own show and I still continue to laugh.",1435708800,,668,4.767241379310345
