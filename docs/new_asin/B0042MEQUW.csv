4251902,5,B0042MEQUW,"So maybe I'm totally dating myself, but I'm from a generation that used to watch MTV for music videos.  Nowadays, I feel like the only way that I can appreciate an artist's audio/visual interpretation of a song is by searching on the internet for a music video.  (Even worse, is that there are so many impostor ""home-made"" videos that aren't the real thing!)

I love this idea of a music video soundtrack DVD.  This release guarantees you a balanced Twilight Saga mix of AUTHENTIC music videos and live performances from some of the AMAZING artists from of all three soundtracks - this is a purchase that I will play over and over.

This DVD starts out big with the 3 lead singles from Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse: Muse ""Neutron Star Collision (Love Is Forever)"" (Eclipse), Paramore ""Decode"" (Twilight), Death Cab For Cutie ""Meet Me On The Equinox"" (New Moon).  Cee Lo's ""What Part of Forever"" (Eclipse) is next and then shifts gears to Anya Marina ""Satellite Heart"" (New Moon).  MUTEMATH ""Spotlight"" (Twilight) is always a fun video to watch (how did they do that?).  Lupe Fiasco's ""Solar Midnite"" (this was an iTunes only version of the New Moon Soundtrack) is super catchy and don't miss the flashes of werewolves. :) Editors ""No Sound But The Wind"" (New Moon) is the first live performance on the DVD and it is AWESOME.  The performance is from the Rock Werchter 2010 festival in Belgium.  The live version has a tempo that is a little slower than the soundtrack and very well done.  The Magic Numbers and Amadou & Mariam ""All I Believe In"" (another iTunes New Moon Soundtrack bonus track) has a chill vibe and was filmed at the recording studio *Never-been-seen-before!*.  More Never-Been-Seen-Before videos with Collective Soul ""Tremble For My Beloved"" (Twilight) and Eastern Conference Champions ""A Million Miles An Hour"" (Eclipse).  Love it! Emily Haines is stunning and channels her inner Bella in the video Metric ""Eclipse (All Yours)"" (Eclipse)! <3  Fanfarlo ""Atlas"" (Eclipse) is another *N.B.S.B.*!  Iron & Wine ""Flightless Bird, American Mouth"" (Twilight) is a live performance but gives off an intimate concert feel. Sia ""My Love"" (Eclipse) is a N.B.S.B. with a cool, ""Sia's performing for me via video-chat"" vibe.  Bon Iver & St. Vincent ""Rosyln"" (New Moon) is a N.B.S.B. live performance from MusicNOW 2010.  Sea Wolf ""The Violet Hour"" (New Moon) N.B.S.B. video has a 1950's sock hop theme that reminds me of the Forks High School prom. :)  I love The Black Ghosts ""Full Moon"" (Twilight) video - I feel like I'm watching short film.  So I read that Hurricane Bells ""Monsters"" (New Moon) is having a contest for fans to recreate their music video - fun!  O.A.R. ""Love Is Worth The Fall"" (Twilight Deluxe Edition CD/DVD) is another Never-Been-Seen-Before live performance and a great finale to the DVD.

There are two classical bonus features - Clair De Lune and La Traviata - set to beautiful nature scenes and a lunar eclipse, respectively.

Overall review - Buy It!  I highly recommend it, especially if you are a fan of the Twilight Saga Soundtracks - You won't be disappointed.  Can't wait for Volume 2!",1291680000,32,3126,4.86578449905482
4251903,5,B0042MEQUW,"I SING THE BODY ELECTRIC was Ray Bradbury's sole contribution to the ""Twilight Zone."" One of the more subtle episodes, this story is strong on characterization and reaches out on an emotional level rather than to any notion of scientific curiosity of the introduction of a robot grandmother, beautifully played by Josephine Hutchinson, into a family (including Veronica Cartwright). This is a very good episode and is one of my favorites.  LONG DISTANCE CALL written by Charles Beaumont and William Idelson is one of the six episodes recorded directly to videotape instead of being photographed on film. The story concerns a little boy played by Billy Mumy who communicates with his dead grandmother over his toy phone. It examines our attachment to those we love and what emotional price we sometimes must pay for that love.",1020729600,2,825,5.0661764705882355
4251904,3,B0042MEQUW,"Don't get me wrong, the Twilight Zone is fantastic, but the episodes contained on this particular volume are hard to enjoy for some people.  The first episode, ""Long Distance Call"", stars little Billy Mumy as a young boy (appropriately named ""Billy"") who finds a way to communicate with his dead grandmother on a toy telephone. At first, it sounds like he's just pretending, but when Billy tries to commit suicide, it seems this may be for real, and maybe his grandma is trying to take Billy away to the great beyond. This episode is powerful, but drips in sentimentality (not something I enjoy in a TZ episode) About average; may satisfy some. But the second episode, ""I Sing the Body Electric"" is TERRIBLE. It's about a family who orders a mechanical ""Grandmother"" to their specifications, but one girl named Anne (played by Veronica Cartwright) rejects her. This episode is not worth seeing. The story is lousy, The episode is too sentimental, and the acting is poor. All in all, this volume of the Twilght Zone Collection is not as good as others, so buyer, beware.",980985600,5,1069,4.778378378378378

4251907,5,B0042MEQUW,"It's really exciting to see the people behind the great music of Twilight. I love all the songs on here, and when I watch the dvd, I can actually see in my head what part of the movie it goes to. I think that says I've watched Twilight too many times! Oh well! I don't know if they've made DVD's for the other movies? I need to check that out and see.",1365292800,,351,3.888888888888889

4251912,5,B0042MEQUW,"I bought the very first DVD, Twilight, as a gift for one of my friends son's 30th birthdays thinking it was an updated version of a scary movie like Halloween.  I bought myself one too to keep abreast of the younger generations genre.  Low and behold, I feel in love with the characters, read all the books (who reads a book after seeing the movie), took my daughter and daughter-in-law to Vancouver to watch the filming of Eclipse.  So of course, you see, this 64 year old grandmother had to have the music.  Too bad these bands weren't around in the 1970's and 1980's when I was attending concerts regularly!",1357344000,,610,4.5181818181818185
4251913,5,B0042MEQUW,"Perfect addition to the Twiligh Saga collection. The videos are great addition for the songs list.
Only changed I would have loved is to see some cuts video of the file in the video songs.",1355443200,,188,4.4
4251914,5,B0042MEQUW,"Twi-hards will love this soundtrack, put it on and just enjoy the videos of all the music of Twilight! All the videos all enjoyable to watch and get you and dancing! The only proble was the last two videos, the classical videos, maybe they need to re-do these. But other than that, Twilight fans, and anybody else will truly enjoy this video! Purchased this video through Amazon music department.",1352764800,,396,4.753623188405797
4251915,5,B0042MEQUW,A good mix of music from the movies we love so well.  It had all my favorites on it as well as a few I didn't recognize.  I liked being able to see the musicians as well.,1352332800,,170,3.5675675675675675
4251916,5,B0042MEQUW,loved this DVD! brilliant songs and some good videos. I have all the cds of the movies but seeing them play is a bit more special. Really wish they would have included Rob Pattinson's songs though.  looking forward to the next volume which I hope is soon and maybe there will be a wee bonus on it!,1349308800,,297,4.2105263157894735
4251917,2,B0042MEQUW,"I love Twilight but this video was a disappointment. I didn't even know some of the songs and even

The music invites to read the novels again.
The order of the topics is adapted.",1328832000,,136,4.48
4251920,5,B0042MEQUW,"I have set and watched these videos over and over I simply love them as much as I love the movies. If you are a diehard twilight fan like me you should purchase this dvd of the music videos. There are some songs on this dvd that I had not paid any attention to on the sound track but after seeing the video it just makes them a little more special. I can't wait to see if they put out another dvd for the music videos from the other twilight movies because I will probably purchase that one too.

4251921,5,B0042MEQUW,"THIS WAS GREAT.....A DVD OF MUSIC VIDEOS FROM THE MUSIC OF THE TWILIGHT MOVIES.

I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THEY MAKE VOLUMES 2...3...4...5 ETC!!!!",1300579200,4,139,5.043478260869565
4251922,5,B0042MEQUW,"I realized the other day that I have never really seen the music videos from the Twilight films.

I realized that because I was watching the videos on a full-screen TV with excellent sound, and the videos that I thought I had seen many (many) times before -- in comparatively tiny, blurry, washed-out, muddy-sounding, online videos* -- were very little like the real thing.

The Music Videos and Performances from The Twilight Saga Soundtracks, Vol. 1
offers twenty-two music videos and performances of the artists who contributed music to the first three Twilight Saga movies.

The richness, vividness, and detail made the videos entirely new to me again (that, and since  several of them aren't available anywhere else). And the sound... well, you'd have to hear these DVD or Blu-Ray versions to know just how wonderful this music really is.

As for the individual videos themselves, they are in turns romantic, beautiful, intense, moving, dramatic, funny, frenetic, and lovely. Something for everyone.

Plus, some genius thought to add Clair De Lune (performed beautifully on the harp!?!), accompanied by striking Northwest scenery, as well as La Traviata with scenes of the (new?) moon.

Plus, the packaging design is really cool, and will look very nice in your own little Twilight shrine of joy.

But I have to say that the coolest thing about Music Videos and Performances from The Twilight Saga Soundtracks, Vol. 1 - and the reason it is a must-have for Twilight fans -- is it will recapture and enrich the passion you felt from the very beginning of your Twilight love.

Enjoy.

* Note: I'm not trying to be rude about YouTube or something.  To make a video small enough to download quickly online, they:  reduce the frame size, greatly reduce the number of colors, reduce the vibrancy of the colors, reduce the visual detail especially during motion, reduce the number of frames per second, and reduce the sound quality dramatically.  Just image what you've seen on YouTube, but with 100 times more stuff -- and that's what you will be seeing  on Music Videos and Performances from The Twilight Saga Soundtracks, Vol. 1.",1297987200,3,2130,4.946629213483146
4251923,5,B0042MEQUW,"This is an incredible DVD.  I love the music of all the movies and I always want to get the music videos off and combine them because I just love them.

Unfortunately, as another reviewer noticed, the clips from the movie have been removed except for the wolves.  I noticed that at least 4 of them had been altered to remove the clips and any twihard music fan will notice and it seems odd, like it's skipping.  After looking up each video I found that a total of 6 had been edited.  The blurring was truly the most bizarre and disrupting to the video.  The only reason I could think of was that they did not want to pay royalties to the movie actors for another twilight product.  I have to say, they have surely made enough on the franchise to include the movie images, they are being cheap.

Overall, I loved this, I have watched it a couple times and enjoy it a lot.  If you love the music of Twilight, buy this product!  I wish more movies with incredible music would release a video soundtrack.  Don't buy this if all you want is to see more images of Rob, Taylor, or Kristen, you will be very disappointed.",1295481600,6,1113,4.277511961722488
4251924,4,B0042MEQUW,"My reason reason for purchasing this Blu-Ray (aside from loving the music included on it) was to hear the songs I love mixed in 5.1 lossless audio. The 5.1 mix ranges from good to great depending on the song. However, two songs have some serious problems: 'Decode' and 'What Part of Forever' (sadly two of my favorite tracks from the saga). Somebody must have fallen asleep on the mixing board during the 5.1 mixing of these two tracks, because the LFE borders on obscene. It is completely overbearing and bloated, making the 5.1 versions of these two tracks nearly painful to listen to at high volume. Aside from these two songs, everything else sounds pretty darn good in 16 bit Dolby TrueHD 5.1.

One more oddity caught my eye in the form of footage from the films (or rather the lack thereof). The music videos that originally had clips from one of the movies spliced into them have had these removed and have been re-edited to include only the band ('Neutron Star Collision' and 'Eclipse (All Yours)'). I had assumed it was an artistic choice to make the collection strictly about the music, and that's fine. The weird part is that in scenes where the band/artist have movie footage around or behind them ('All Yours' where the TV behind Emily Haines shows Bella/Edward from Eclipse), the footage has actually been blurred out - what the heck?? I find this very strange considering this is an officially licensed Twilight/Summit product - it's just kind of a weird choice. It's very minor, but hey, I noticed it.

Still, these little nitpicks aside (well, I don't consider the audio issue a nitpick - THAT really bugs me), this is a great collection and I eagerly anticipate Volume 2 after Breaking Dawn is released. Recommended!",1292025600,14,1734,4.7574750830564785
