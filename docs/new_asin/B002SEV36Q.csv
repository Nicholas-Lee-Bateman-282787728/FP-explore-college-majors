8379385,5,B002SEV36Q,Fabulous collection! It would be good if more Aussie movies were put out in this style package. Why do I need to put so many words in? This makes it a pain to have to do this. Reconsider what you actually need for a review.,1389571200,,223,3.977777777777778
8379386,1,B002SEV36Q,This is in the PAL format (Australia) and it would not play on our DVD.  It was returned to the business with a letter explain the problem and a requesting a refund or a credit toward another purchase.  No response from the business as yet.  Several weeks have gone by.  They should have known.  My wife purchased this for my Christmas present and did not read the info and did not pick up on the PAL.  Great idea that didn't work.  We did purchase Malcom as a single DVD since it is now available.  EJH,1360022400,,503,4.221052631578948
