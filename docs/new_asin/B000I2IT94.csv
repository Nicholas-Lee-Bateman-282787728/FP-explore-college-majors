""Oktoberfest!! The Defenitive Guide to German Beer"" and ""The Official German Beer Guide"" are the same DVD, so avoid purchasing both like I did.
In fact, I wish I had bought neither!

The first 30 mins of the DVD is great; a concise history, followed by an excellent presentation on how beer is made.

The section that follows is in black and white, it is basically shot from the same angle and the subject is a group of friends tasting beers. Their comments aren't particularly insightful ... it is really boring.
The final section is a cooking segment which is charming in its authenticity but not very visually appealing.

Oktoberfest is barely even mentioned on the whole DVD.",1206316800,4,1063,6.851851851851852
