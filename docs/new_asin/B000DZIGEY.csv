2475836,5,B000DZIGEY,"This was a great show to watch. I would have to agree with other people, this is way better(for many reasons) then shows like nip tuck, or fear factor. Shows these days are just getting more dumb, especially the comedy ones, Just plain stupid. This was very good and mostly stuck with the book, Little House On The Prairie, There is one question tho, Wheres Baby Carrie? She was in the first book. I wonder of they are going to do more of these, I hope so. The stations out there need to get rid of the retarded ""new"" shows.",1139529600,3,524,4.25
2475837,4,B000DZIGEY,"I'm a huge fan of the Little House on the Prairie books by Laura Ingalls Wilder, having even visited most of Laura's home sites.  Her books truly created a new genre in children's literature and greatly advanced what children's lit could be.

Though the original Michael Landon Little House on the Prairie movie was fairly faithful to the books, the television series strayed quite far from them.  However, fans loved the warmth, character, and humor of the series, giving it about a decade on the air.

While this new Disney / ABC mini-series stayed much closer to the book (isn't that a FIRST for Disney?!?), it lacked a fair amount of the aforementioned warmth, character, and humor of the original series.  However, this can be largely excused, as these things take time to develop - the original Landon movie was also not as strong on these as the ensuing series would be, though it was much more faithful to the book.

But my own personal pet peeve with this mini-series was the ""MTV syndrome"" - the director's perceived necessity for ""artistic"" camera angles, and the need to change these angles every second of two in several of the ""adrenaline rush"" scenes.  During the crossing of the Mississippi (Lake Pepin) and the other river (where they lose Jack), the camera switches angles at the rate of what seems to be milli-seconds.  When the Ingallses (the correct pluralization of Ingalls, despite William Anderson's book, The Story of the Ingalls) are on the way down a steep river bank with their wagon, not only do the camera angles jump all over, but the camera shakes, and the film even goes in fast-motion at times - very fake looking and annoying.  Once in awhile, this ""artistic"" camera work actually succeeds fairly well, like when we look up at Laura through a basin of water, but most of the time, it takes away greatly from the story, like the camera circling round and round the dining table or practically looking up the noses of characters at times.  I guess I'm too old-fashioned of a viewer to appreciate this newer avant garde artistic filming style.  The sets and cinematic background are engaging enough on their own that the MTV-like camera work is certainly not the least bit necessary to keep the viewers' attention.

Another minor flaw was the music in the first hour, during the trip to the Prairie - not a big problem, but it seemed a bit too modern for the setting instead of having a more timeless quality.  Okay music - just not quite right for this movie.

Despite these flaws, I greatly enjoyed what I saw of the mini-series (the first 4 of the 6 total hours), and I really hoped that the ratings would justify a new television series for ABC, which I believe was proposed, depending on the ratings.  It would have been far superior to most of the inane and culturally-destructive drivel that passes for television entertainment these days.  Alas, the ratings were surprisingly quite poor.  Has our culture truly lost its appetite for intelligent and positive entertainment in favor of programming like the ultra-disgusting Fear Factor, ultra-risque Will and Grace, and many ultra-violent shows currently on tv?  How sad!

As far as someone else's comment about the mini-series (and book) being true, that's not totally accurate.  The Little House books are classified as fiction, and most people's belief that this label is strictly a formality have been duped, especially with the earlier books in the series.  If you read Donald Zochert's excellent (and well-researched) book, assuming that he's not making up his findings, you will find large elements of the earlier Little House books debunked, largely because Laura was not old enough to remember most of the events and relied on family stories about these events when she started writing the books in her 60s - the Ingalls family did NOT settle in Oklahoma (""Indian Territory"") as Laura later believed, but rather much closer to Independence, Kansas; the area was MUCH more settled than the books depict (according to the 1870 census); Charles bought the land after the area had been platted (and, I believe, roads surveyed and built); and he moved off the land because of money problems rather than being kicked off of Indian land by the government - the buyer of the Big Woods property reneged on their land contract purchase, so the Ingallses moved back to Wisconsin.  Laura was only 2-3 years old during the events in Little House on the Prairie, rather than somewhat older, as she is depicted in the book.  There is also scholarly conjecture in other books about Laura and her daughter Rose, that Rose, already a famous author herself, may have extensively edited / rewritten large amounts of some of the Little House books, to make the story work better.  Though I would place much more creedence in Laura's later books in the series, I doubt that Little House on the Prairie is ""history, as it happened.""",1138492800,51,4906,4.826968973747016
2475838,5,B000DZIGEY,"This production of Little House was absolutely superb!  Well shot, well thought out, wonderfully acted, and (most important) stayed true to the Laura Ingalls Wilder books.  NOT the sugar-coated TV series of the 70's, this mini-series gave an inspiring chronicle of what life was like back then.  The reality of this family's adventure, challenge, and eventual joy on the prairie was unbelievable.  An amazing true story executed by extremely talented performers.  Bravo!",1137715200,5,470,5.472222222222222
2475839,5,B000DZIGEY,"When I found out that (I think it was ABC) they're making a Little House on the Prairie movie, I was thrilled. When I found out that they're going to follow the books exactly, I was even more thrilled. As the most of us, I grew up with the series with Michael Landon and I still consider this to be the best family series in television history. The 5-part mini-series was excellent and I consider this to be highly reccomended.

I really hope that ABC continues making more of these movies by continuing on faithfully by the books as Laura gets older and her meeting Almanzo. I'm such a sucker for romance. :) This is reccomended for all ages and it's completely family-safe. :)",1136160000,69,678,4.467741935483871
2475840,5,B000DZIGEY,"This is the special that aired on TV (I don't remember the network) earlier this year in 5 parts.  It starts when the Ingalls left the Big Woods of Wisconsin and the dramatic crossing of the Mississippi river.  Their wagon got stuck and they traded their two old, tired horses for the young mustangs, Pet and Patty.  They arrived in Kansas and Pa stopped and said this was home and he began building their log house.  This is where we meet Mr. Edwards who helps Pa build the house after Ma was hurt from a falling log.

The rest of the shows showed their life on the prairie, the indians, the danger and the happiness (and glass windows and white sugar).  We even see Mr. Edwards make the daring trip through the Verdigris River to bring the Ingalls girls their gifts from Santa, who couldn't cross the river.  We see a prairie fire (that they suspect the indians of setting to scare them off their land) and how the family came down with Malaria and were saved by a black doctor.

As the show ends, we hear the indian shouts and drums.  The Ingalls and Mr. Edwards move in with Mr. and Mrs. Smith (?) for safety until the indian chants stop.  The indians dispersed.  Finally, Pa hears that they'd crossed just 2-3 miles too far into indian territory and they must leave or be forcibly removed by the soldiers.  They pack up their wagon and leave.  The only thing I wish were different were if they had used a bringle bull dog to play Jack instead.

As an avid Little House fan, this show was more accurate portraying the Ingalls' life than the TV series, for obvious reasons.  I loved this when it aired on TV and I definitely plan on purchasing it as soon as it's released on DVD!",1135641600,17,1682,4.363344051446945

2475842,3,B000DZIGEY,"This is not Laura Ingalls Wilder's story, this is a heavily edited and changed version and also nearly every reference to God is missing.  If you think of this as just a generic pioneer story then it's okay but don't think of this as the official story.

2475845,3,B000DZIGEY,"Most of the reviews I read before purchasing praised this version for being close to the book, but it takes a LOT of liberties.  Baby Carrie is missing, Jack is the wrong kind of dog entirely, they almost fall into the ice on Lake Peppin (in the book they heard in breaking up in the night), Pa has to shoot one of the horses, Pa is attacked by a wolf (and if you look carefully you can see it is chained to a peg in the ground.  Poor editing.), Laura keeps seeing a little Native American boy, Edwards goes down in the well without lighting the candle first instead of Mr. Scott.  I could go on, and that is only the first half!  My daughter is enjoying watching it, but it irritates me that they thought they had to change so much.  I understand making it a bit more exciting, but for every event?",1482796800,3,799,4.162337662337662

When I discovered it was so affordable I couldn't pass up the chance.  My girls love it.  They don't care about the camera angles, what it is missing.  They see themselves in the characters and we have great discussions about if we could live in their situation.  They have already decided they want to dress up like Laura and Mary for their school book character day.  I will say that the chapter selections on the main menu are a little confusing if you don't watch it all the way through.",1474934400,,626,4.391304347826087

Killing off a horse to make things more dramatic, dumping the lions share of the overt racism onto one annoying character, etc. but its not the ""close to the book"" story that I read about. For everything that's similar, there are two things that are completely different. We used it as an educational tool by playing ""spot the differences"", which my 4 year old was into.

2475854,5,B000DZIGEY,"Absolutely LOVE this version! Stayed close to the book. I only wish they would have continued on and made the rest of the books into movies with the same actors. They all did a fantastic job. I was afraid I'd have trouble 'adapting' to these characters, as I love the Michael Landon version as well, but within the first ten minutes, it felt right. Also, some complained about the camera angles. There were a few quick/odd angels, but they FIT. One scene (involving wolves) flashes quickly, but it fits because that's basically what you'd see if you were actually there and were involved - fast, unexpected, and tense. It just works. Also, there is a magnificent under water scene where the camera angles up and through the ice above as they're crossing the Mississippi (I think?) River. Makes you feel as if you're there and partaking of the angst of crossing on thinning ice. Wonderful, LONG, multi-part movie. My family and I would give it more stars, if possible. If you love all things Little House, I don't think you'll be disappointed. Just remove all preconceived notions and expectations and you'll really enjoy it.",1464825600,2,1124,4.798969072164948
2475855,4,B000DZIGEY,I recently finished reading the first 5 books in the Little House series with my 7 year old daughter and she was super excited to be able to watch her favorite characters on TV. She devoured the books and she seems to really enjoy the DVD as well. The characters were not as I expected: Pa seems to be a little meaner than portrayed in the books and everyone comes across as younger than I imagined in my mind. It does move quick and cannot possibly contain all of the detail of a book but that can be said about most book to movie productions. I am sure we will enjoy this one for a while!,1462838400,2,590,4.094827586206897

There was so much action and excitement full of suspense too without too much drama like the first series on TV. I have watched it over and over.  It was good that the movie focused on the poor treatment that the white man gave to the indians. Watching the indians leave was an eye opener. I particularly enjoyed Mr. Edwards.

2475908,1,B000DZIGEY,"I am an avid Little House on the Prairie fan.  I have enjoyed the books and the Little House tv series for 30+ years.  I was absolutely astonished that this POOR tribute to Laura's life was produced by Disney.  The plot was slow moving, the acting VERY bad, and the lines NOT TRUE to Laura's books.  It was so bad, I had a hard time sitting through the whole thing.  I can honestly say that I never intend on watching this movie again.  ---  Even if I just took this movie at face value as a pioneer story, I would still say the plot was slow moving and the acting VERY bad.

The music, acting and scenery was just breathtakingly great, however I did not like how the character of Carrie was not written in. The movie was nearly identical to the books, which was refreshing and exciting to see, but the fact that Carrie was not in the script made me upset. In this movie, Jack is not a bulldog, which was minor, but annoying since they seemed to be trying to copy the books as much as possible.

I wish they would finish the series, and maybe go on to create a mini-series on the Rose books (Laura's daughter Roses stories after they move to Missouri).

2475920,1,B000DZIGEY,"My 8-year-old daughter and I love all things Little House. I wasn't sure if we'd like this LH version, as I grew up with and loved the 70s TV show, but was excited to give it a try. Fortunately, I got it from the library, so didn't even spend the $5 on it. In case you care, there are spoiler alerts in this review.
I'll say upfront that I know the books well, but I can understand certain changes being made to bring the stories to the screen. However, the changes this mini-series made are frankly unforgivable. The casting is horrible. Pa looks like the hottie from a romance, not ""Pa"" like at all. Laura has blonde hair, although slightly darker blonde than Mary's. Jack is an Australian sheperd. I don't expect him to be a bulldog, but an Australian sheperd?
Let's move on. Ma is opposed to moving west until a man tells Pa (in front of the entire family) that he won't pay Pa for building a fence because it wasn't done correctly. The grandma gives rag doll Charlotte to Laura when they're leaving to go west. Shortly after starting their journey they pass Pepin, Wisconsin (we know it's Pepin because words flash on the screen to tell us so). Pepin is right next to the Mississippi River, and it's where they crossed the river. However, the family talks for days about crossing the Mississippi River. Then they finally cross it. Are we to believe they went farther south before crossing the river? No wonder it gave way while they were crossing. Shortly after crossing, the horse gets bit by a rattlesnake (would it have been out and about that early in the late winter/spring? I'm no snake expert, but I don't think so). Pa shoots the horse. (Might he have waited to see if the horse would recover?). They pass through beautiful country and landscapes. However, it looks like the southwest, not at all like Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, or Kansas that they actually traveled through.
At this point, I stopped watching, but my daughter still watched, and I popped my head in every once in a while. The log house they built was huge, and had enormous windows. The Indians actually looked very authentic. Neighbor Mrs. Scott babbled a lot. Laura went on the cattle drive with Pa. My daughter didn't put the second disc in, so we can only guess what happens then. Since they'd do anything to make the story more exciting, probably space aliens came down to tell the Ingalls that they'd built on Native American land, and would have to move on.",1393891200,2,2444,4.569476082004556

2475923,1,B000DZIGEY,"I am confused by reviewers who feel this is true to the books. I have been reading the books with my child, and watching this was confusing to him. Yes, it is closer to the books than the TV series was, but I am not sure why they bothered deviating in the myriad ways that they did. It was so close, why not just follow the books? It is like the made a parallel story with events that were almost just like the story, so that if you haven't read the books recently you wouldn't really notice. Like they are saying goodbye to Caroline's family when it should have been Charles's, and a white settler trades horses with them instead of the Native Americans in the book. And Baby Carrie is just missing. When we returned to the books the night after watching it, my child was so happy that Baby Carrie was back:).",1392681600,3,810,4.266233766233766

2475933,5,B000DZIGEY,"I loved this mini-series when it was on TV. It's a far more serious treatment of Ingalls-Wilder's books than the series from the 70's and early 80's. This mini-series does a good job at portraying what it would be like for a family to live isolated in a remote and (assumed) hostile land. The way it portrays Native Americans is refreshing. The wayward families and Native Americans  regard each other with cautious tolerance - we won't bother them if they don't bother us. Of course, it wouldn't be a pioneer/western story if outside interests didn't change that dynamic...at least for a little while.

All-in-all, I loved this mini-series.",1384732800,,641,4.925925925925926
2475934,3,B000DZIGEY,I liked it but I am so addicted to the original Little House cast it was hard to not compare the two. I would still recommend it just try not to compare. Also I am a big Michael Landon fan so that didn't help.,1381795200,,209,3.772727272727273
2475935,5,B000DZIGEY,The movie came in great shape and the kids enjoyed watching it. It was a close depiction of the books.,1380672000,,102,4.15
2475936,3,B000DZIGEY,"I expect adaptation to take some license, but this fails on several big ways:

-- Ma would never have her hair loose all the time.
-- No one wears bonnets. Or braids.
-- The girls are sometimes disrespectful to their elders.
-- Laura would not be so forward. Or smirky. Or lispy. Or shrieky. OR BLONDE. I don't care that they include the ""blondes are pretty"" argument, the girl who plays Laura looks pretty blonde to me.

There are other changes and made-up scenarios (Mrs. Scott is built up for comedic effect, for example, and there's very little attention paid to their schooling), but those are the ones that are the most off-putting, because they are such major parts of the characters and conflicts in the story that to change them was inexcusable. Many of the ""danger"" scenes are also dragged out for dramatic effect.

Points in its favor, however:

-- gorgeous scenery.
-- a good feel for the creaky dangers of traveling by wagon.
-- a fine Charles Ingalls and sweet Mary, and an appropriate Ma (performance-wise, anyway, she couldn't help the decisions to change her character)
-- a few imagined scenes between Ma and Pa which offered some hint into their relationship, particularly in acknowledging her putting up with his determination to settle in the west.
-- not enough attention paid to housekeeping, cooking, everyday anecdotes, or personal growth

Watch this one to see the lovely prairie setting and get a feel for the isolation and danger. If you're a somewhat obsessive fan of the books, though, just be forewarned that some details will drive you crazy. The really maddening thing is that they would have been so easy to fix! While I know that any adaptation of the Little House books would be difficult because so much of their charm is in their simplicity and their quiet, everyday stories, it's disappointing that so little attempt has been made to pay attention to the details that make the books so wonderful. I'd like to see an adaptation sometime that shows the involvement of a true Little House fan.

But it's not a bad miniseries if you try to think of it in terms of being a tv film for kids. But as a truly good Laura adaptation? No. It misses the mark.",1375401600,3,2186,4.6796875

2475944,5,B000DZIGEY,"This particular ""Little House on the Prairie"" mini series is nothing short of amazingly spectacular!!! This mini series will greatly appeal to those who already appreciate the book and television series, as well as persons who have never yet been familiarized with the story. This mini series illustrates a very vivid and detailed account of the early adventure and hardship encountered by the Ingalls family, prior to the ""Walnut Grove"" era. While this rendition offers an accurate portrayal of the early undertakings of the Ingalls family, this mini series truly stands upon its own merit, not needing to be harshly compared to either the books or previous long running TV series. Having mentioned that, I will say that the actresses chosen to play Laura and Mary offer strikingly familiar features and mannerisms to that of which most of us are already accustomed. The chosen cast for the remaining characters, including Charles, Caroline, and Mr. Edwards, could not have been better. Not only is the story offered to us in a grippingly realistic and detailed manner, but the overall production quality is on par with larger budget feature films. The filming locations, cinematography techniques, editing direction, wardrobe costumes, set props, etc, are all nothing short of perfection.

Regarding the DVD set, . . . NICE!!! The discs are of high quality, and include very functional chapter menus. The total runtime is approximately four and a half hours in length. The DVD discs offer a pristine 16:9 format print transfer, with intensely dynamic contrast, vivid colors, and razor sharp clarity. When played using a nice upscaling player, and viewed on a decent quality HDTV, the picture display is genuinely ""HD-Like"". Overall, I would have to suggest, that the picture quality is a solid ""9.7"" out of 10, just ever so slightly shy of a truly high definition sourced image (such as Blu-Ray, or 1080P HD satellite/cable movie). I've not witnessed a ""DVD"" disc(s) with an image having this type of finite resolution clarity in quite some time. The soundtrack offered is just as brilliant as the picture image, with crystal clear dynamic audio, and without any concerns (plenty of volume range, also). JUST GREAT!!!

This mini series plays out with swift pacing, extremely detailed story illustration, and modern style cinematography showing scenic images which are truly astounding. This DVD set will appeal to most persons who enjoy high quality entertainment production, not just fans of the ""Little House on the Prairie"" story arc. Definitely, more than worthy of your time!!!

This ""Little House on the Prairie"" mini series happens to be virtually ""perfect"".

It combined several stories into one and changed some characters a bit. I loved this version of Edwards. Mrs. Scott was delightfully revolting! I read a review about ""MTV"" style camera filming...I saw that as showing that their were very real dangers and they had energy and happened suddenly...life was very real on the trip to live on another people's land...which is what settlers were doing. It showed them at a loss to explain away or justify the uprooting of the people that already occupied the land. But, that's our history...it happened...and they showed it. It was sad.

2475956,5,B000DZIGEY,"I've enjoyed the tv series but the fact that it veered to far from the truth has always bothered me and kept me from really falling in love with it. The true story of the Ingalls was one that was perfect as it was. Therefore I've never understood why the series strayed so far from the books. They really didn't need to add all these sappy feel good stories in order to have a classic tv series. The true story of a family coming together in order to survive as pioneers in the untamed american Midwest provided plenty of lessons on love, family, and perseverance in the face of adversity. Just the way the books were written.
So I was thrilled when  I was this movie for the first time and realized how right they actually got. My only complaint it simply that when it ended it left me wishing that they would have continued it from there as the weekly series LHOP should have been to begin with.
If you are a fan of  movies set in the pre 20th century era. Or are looking for a classic your whole family will love..... Don't hesitate to buy this movie. Its well worth every penny.",1303084800,3,1082,4.273170731707317

Carrie was left out, Ma's hair was always down, and none of the females wore bonnets. There is no way Ma would have ridden on the wagon next to Pa all that way with no sun protection.  I thought the casting of Mary and Laura was okay, although Laura's hair should have been a bit darker, but I did not find the casting of Ma or Pa well done at all.  I didn't think either one was believable, though Pa was a better actor than Ma.  The music was obnoxious and some of the story was hard to take seriously. Laura would not have been allowed to go on a cattle drive with Pa. I also disliked the scene where Pa rode with Laura in front of him and jumped off his horse and sent her on while he fought a wolf (emerging unscathed with Laura looking back and smiling).

observation thow is this WHERE  WAS CARRIE. when it started and carrie was not there i thought oh ok thier going by real life. If you do historical research on the real Ingalls family and their time in Kansas you will find out that despite the order of the books they moved to kansas when laura was around 3 and carrie was born there.they later moved back to the big woods briefly after leaving Kansas when laura was about six.(if you tryed to write a book about such a early time in your life it would be a little off to.)but anyway i got to the end of the movie and still no carrie.last and finel of the things i found wrong with the film is in the books pa acts a whole lot more gracefull when they tell him he has to leave kansas. he did not go to the claims office and throw a fitt like he did in the movie.the real one found out about his house being on indian territory and said he was not going to give them the honner of kicking him off and left before they did. that might seem like a lot but it was muuuuuuuuuch closser to the books then anything on the tv show. it was a very good  movie.",1282262400,3,1327,4.061068702290076

2475965,5,B000DZIGEY,"Long review - for a long mini-series (4+ hours)

Finally, a more accurate account of Laura Ingalls Wilder's books.

As an adult, I sat and read the series to my daughters and we thoroughly enjoyed them.  I then came across the Pilot movie or premiere of the Little house on the Prairie with Michael Landon.  But recently, I have come across this new Disney version of Little House on the Prairie and wanted to see it as well.  Myself, my seven year old daughter and my nine year old daughter love this new version over the premiere movie of the Little house on the Prairie with Michael Landon.  This Disney version fits more closely to the book.  The Pa from the Disney version (Cameron Bancroft) was more like Pa which had a beard.

I must add that I did not let them watch Episode 5 on the DVD, though.  This episode added that the Indians burned down Mr. Edwards house and drug him out of his house.  Then the Ingalls' and Mr. Edwards went to the Scott's house to fortify themselves in to protect themselves against the Indians as they thought they were going to attack.  This never happened in the book and I think it may be too scary for my daughters, especially the seven year old who gets scared easily.  I don't know why they added this.

First, back to the good things about this mini-series/movie.

The movie goes along with the books from the end of ""Little House in the Big Woods"" through ""Little House on the Prairie"". I was delighted to see the books come to life in this new version!  I went back and reread the book Little house on the Prairie and every chapter from the Little House on the Prairie was covered in this movie.  Some parts are not in the exact order, but the story is still well put together.  It is a lot more detailed in the 255 minutes (4 hours +) compared to the 1974 premiere movie with 120 minutes (2 hours).  They could not include every story in the book, but a good chunk of them are included.

The movie was well shot and very realistic.  There was footage of wildlife as Laura would describe in her book like gophers, rabbits, snakes, deer, and bison etc.  The movie made the prairie come to life so that you could experience what it was like during that time period and what pioneer families had to go through.  I watched some parts again to watch what they were doing while talking.  Ma and the girls are canning fruit, Ma is forming stuffing balls and stuffing them inside the turkey for Christmas, they are cooking the blackberries after picking them.  There is a lot of detail of their everyday life.  Ma is helping Pa lift the logs when building the house, the log slips and lands on Ma's foot.  Her foot is shown bruised.  It looks really bad.  This follows the book.

It may seem that the traveling part from Wisconsin to Kansas seemed long and drawn out, but it took the pioneers a long time in traveling and was a trying experience.  I am glad that they showed so much of their travels and the struggles they endured.  Instead of very quickly just arriving in Kansas.  The details they included were fantastic.  My favorite detail, yet sad, was when they left at the end and it shows Pa's plow sitting in the field as he had to leave it because they didn't have room for it.

Characters:  The girls' playing Laura and Mary were great, as well as Pa and Mr. Edwards.  Laura's hair in the movie was brown, but probably not as brown as we would have liked it.  When close up shots are done, you can see her freckles on her face.  I liked Pa with a beard in this movie as this mimicked Pa in real life.  Mr. Edwards was lean and lanky as described in the book.  I like how he said that he was a wildcat from Tennessee, just as it stated in the book.  I noticed that a lot of the wording in the movie were the exact words they took from the book ""Little House on the Prairie"".  Mr. and Mrs. Scott, I thought were too old.  In the book I think they were a little younger.  Mrs. Scott's character in the movie was okay in some parts, like talking about the Indians, but they could have done a better job.  They made Mrs. Scott to seem very strange with Mary and Laura thinking that she was odd.  In the book, Mrs. Scott was very friendly and nursed the Ingalls back to health after fever n' ague.  They did a great job with the foreign accents for Mr. and Mrs. Scott, though.

Changes:  There were a few changes in the movie, such as when Pa dug the well, it was Mr. Edwards that helped and not Mr. Scott.  In the book, Mr. Scott helped Pa with the well.  Most were minor, though.  Except, in the movie Laura went with Pa on the cattle drive.  This did not follow the book as Pa went by himself.  There were two additions to the movie that weren't in the book.  Laura went over to the Indian camp to play with the Indian children.  The Ingalls' went to the Scott's house to protect themselves against the Indians as I mentioned above about Episode #5.

Cons:  Baby Carrie was left out of the movie.  Historically, she was born in Kansas; but to follow the ""Little House"" books, she came with them to Indian territory.  I don't understand why they left her out.  Ma has her hair down the entire movie.  I don't imagine it that way, but I can't pinpoint in the book where she wore it up all the time.  Maybe it was in the later books, as I thought the girls should have been wearing their bonnets more as Ma was always telling Laura to put hers on.  Although, I didn't find the bonnets mentioned in the ""Little house on the Prairie"" book itself.  I had to go back and watch the movie to catch some things, like Ma's blouse being too low.  In a couple of scenes she is in a low cut blouse.  But, I didn't pick up on this the first time I watched it as the story is so great.  No, they didn't wear blouses like that in the 1870's.  Their blouses went up to their necks and their skirts to the floor.  So those blouses did not fit the time period.

I read one comment in these reviews from a writer that said that this movie was too slow.  They said that there was too much time on Laura walking barefoot in the leaves, etc.  I thought that it was wonderful that they included this footage.  In the Little House books, Laura wrote details about walking on the prairie, seeing the rabbits, picking flowers, etc.  I think this gave the movie the feeling of Laura's books.  It made me feel like this little girl was Laura and she was living the life as described in her books.

My next favorite books in the series is ""On the banks of Plum Creek"" and then ""On the Shores of Silver Lake"".  I wish they would make a movie or mini-series based on these books.  Overall, this is a wonderful rendition of Laura Ingalls Wilder book ""Little House on the Prairie"".  We are adding it to our collection and will be watching it over and over again!  We have already watched it several times.  If you are a stickler for the movie following closely to the book, this version is the closest fit.",1269216000,3,6918,4.271395528141865

2475968,5,B000DZIGEY,"I thought this was a really well done movie version of Laura Ingalls Wilder's Books.  It really showcased the hardships faced by settlers in a realistic and believable way.  I found myself unable to turn the movie off and while I had intended to watch in segments, I ended up watching the entire thing in a marathon viewing - it was just that good!

I only wish they had redone more of the books into this movie format with these actors/movie crew - it would have been refreshing to see a new take on what was done in the old tv series.

I love that to find unspoiled wildnerness this ""American"" story had to filmed in Canada.",1259625600,,626,4.3247863247863245
2475969,5,B000DZIGEY,The TV series was ok for the kids and my girlfriend but this tells more of a real tale.,1258675200,,87,3.6315789473684212
2475970,4,B000DZIGEY,"How closely does this follow the books? I don't know. My sister had all the books when we were kids but I never read them. Now I will.

What did I like about this? Why will I read the books? Whereas the tv show was very shiny happy people, Waltonsy in its own way, this 6 hour (at least on tv) mini-series isn't. What I like about this is that in some ways, more than most other tv shows and movies, this shows the hardships of living through this era. Sure, the wolf scene is stupid, but it's also 2 minutes out of a 6 hour movie. Whereas the tv show was often the televised equivalent of a Hallmark card, this movie is not. Usually if you want to get a sense of the suffering, brutal conditions, weird politics and social interactions (ie. whites and Indians) you have to read a book. You can watch this movie and deeply respect them just for surviving, just as you can the... other side.

That will be the line of demarcation for whether or not you like this movie, I suspect. If you want a new version of the tv show, or something that strictly follows the books (like I said, I don't know if this does) you may be disappointed. If you want more of a character study... a contextual study... the texture of their lives and a look into what it took to Go West by wagon (whether you agree with all their motivations, ideals and rationales or not), you'll like this.

Also, strictly for entertainment value, I loved Mr. Edwards. This guy played the role so that Mr. Edwards was a really nice guy who just may have been a little touched in the head.

With less feel-good schmaltz than the tv series, more of the American Truth comes through. The title of my review comes from one of the deepest scenes in the movie. You can feel the dominant, mainstream American consciousness  already in place. Based on the context of the question and who asks it, America's answer is (and remains) ""yes"". By Disney standards, this is a heck of a movie.",1257724800,,1938,4.327823691460055
2475971,4,B000DZIGEY,"I watched this on the Hallmark channel with my 9yr old daughter last night.  We have read all the books together and I was looking forward to this version because I had read it was so true to the actual second book in the LIW series.  While it was a good movie, I was disappointed because in many ways it was not true to the book at all.  First of all, Jack is mentioned many times in the book to be a 'brindle bulldog'.  The movie dog was most definitely not a bulldog!  I also thought that for mentioning that Laura's hair was brown (something definitely in the books, because the girls did argue about what was prettier, brown or blonde) they could have actually used an actress with brown hair, not reddish blonde!  The worst was Pa fighting off wolves and a the mountain lion.  I recall from the books Pa being chased while on his horse, but if he had ended up on the ground with the animals attacking him, he would have been seriously hurt!  I think this movie accurately portrayed the terror of hearing the Indians, there is at least one chapter in the book that refers to hearing all the war chants all night long, but never in the book do the Ingalls family have to stay with the Scotts, that was purely fictional and very disappointing.  Laura did not go to Independence with Pa to the land office, either, that is not something Ma and Pa would have ever allowed.  The real stories in the books were interesting enough, it's sad that the movie makers thought they needed to add more drama to make a good movie.",1257638400,,1520,4.339222614840989

Hours later I was still glued to the TV - what a wonderful and entertaining suprise! As a history fan I especially enjoyed the more authentic portrayal of the times.

2475976,4,B000DZIGEY,"Having grown up reading and loving the books, and having been HORRIFIED by the terrible TV series (did they even READ the books? and it took her performance in Babylon 5 for Melissa Gilbert to redeem herself with me), I watched this on Hallmark Channel with some dread.  And I was pleasantly surprised.  As a museum professional and living historian, I found the props, costuming, and sets to be more than passable, if slightly ""Disneyfied"" at times.  The story was much truer to the books than the television series, and in some ways was closer to Laura Ingalls's true life (such as postponing the birth of baby Carrie, acknowledging that LHitBW actually should follow LHotP chronologically.)  And from a historical perspective, the portrayal of the dangers of pioneer life and the separation (Caroline's realization that going west may mean never seeing her family again) is effective and affecting.

The review loses a star for anachronisms like the use of ""okay"" and other modernist dialogue, and for the Dances-With-Wolves-like fetishization of the American Indians and new age weidness with the ""spirit dog"".  Though the portrayal of the terror of the raid gets points for accuracy, as does the depiction of Indian-pioneer interactions from the books (the skunk-wearing hunters stealing cornmeal, Soldat Duchene with the peace pipe.)  Also loss of points for bizarre use of wildlife, such as the thoroughly un-wolf-like wolf pack attack, and for the fact that if Charles really were attacked by a puma as depicted he would not likely survive without serious, life-threatening injuries.",1240790400,3,1591,5.19140625

I recently reread the books with my two children and was struck by how amazingly difficult pioneer life was, how resilient and ingenuitive these men and women were, and how much we owe to them.  And this mini-series does a wonderful job of showing these realities of pioneer life.  Many of the memorable stories from the book were included in the movie.  Obviously they couldn't include all of them, but did a great job with the ones they chose.  I particularly liked how they handled the very real situation the Ingalls faced with the Native American and what a very sad chapter of American history it was.  I like that everyone didn't fall into the typical stereotypes, but that the situation was portrayed in a more realistic manner. Like many of the reviewers, I watched the Michael Landon TV series growing up and loved it, but was always bothered by how many differences there were between the book and the TV show.

Show is Ma and Pa Ingalls with Laura and Mary - no Carrie or Grace. BORING especially compared to the original series. You have been warned!",1223510400,6,486,4.597701149425287

Little House has been my favorite book series,and tv series for ever since i was a kid,amd it still is. Little House captures all of the emotions,feelings,and way to treat your fellow man. I enjoy the tv series of Little House On The Prairie alot,and when i saw that they were coming out with a new version of Little House On The Prairie i didn't know if it would be as good as the tv series. I bought this watched it,and i loved it right away. It did capture the feeling of the pioneer life,the lands looked really good as prairie land,the indians were amazing,and looked like i was watching real indians. I think it really kept faithful to the feeling of the book,and the works of Laura Ingalls Wilder,and the feeling of how her life was. I also like the Pilot of the NBC Little House,which is based off the Little House On The Prairie book,but in this version they added more,and had more of the characters from the book. It was well shot,and it got the feeling on video of the prairie. I really think Kyla Chavarria was perfect as Laura and Laura to a t,and Danielle Chuchran was Mary to a T,and she looked like how i pictured Mary in my head when i read the books. I don't think the actors/actresses who played Pa,Ma,and Mr. Edwards were that good as them. I think Michael Landon,Karen Grassle,and Victor French were better. But i do think that Kyle and Melissa Gilbert are the same as Half-Pint they did  really good jobs playing her,and were really believeable as Laura. I also think that Danielle and Melissa Sue Anderson were both perfect as Mary,and both did wonderful jobs playing her. I give it five stars for capturing the pioneer time period on the prairie that Laura lived through,and that the actresses who played Laura and Mary were spot on perfect,and cute as them.

The music didn't fit at all and the books, themselves are full enough of thrilling stories to fill a movie. Nothing needs to be added, but of course they always do. They portrayed Laura in too much a ""Girl Power"" way instead of the sweet and determined girl that she was. Danielle Chuchran (Mary Ingalls and a former neighbor of mine) was not the right choice for her role either. Just read the books.",1205798400,8,540,4.303921568627451

The outdoor scenes are very realistic in portraying what the rugged woodlands and prairies of the late 1800's were probably like.  However, many reviews have claimed that this miniseries was closer to following the events in Laura Ingalls Wilder's book series than any other television series or movie has ever been, and after watching it we were very disappointed that it does not follow the books more closely at all.  If anything there are even more differences than those described in Laura's books.

I thought that this movie was much more thorough on the Ingall's trip out west.  I found it to have a different style then Micheal Landon's version but it was still very good.  The actors/actresses did an excellent job.  Even my 8 year old son enjoyed this.

2475985,1,B000DZIGEY,"We didn't like this version at all.  First of all, the claim to be ""closer to the books"" is not true.  It is also not closer to Laura Ingalls' actual life either.  A few examples:  the fact that Ma constantly has her hair down and blowing all over the place with her shirt unbuttoned to show cleavage; the fact that Laura is BLONDE (horrors) when the book goes out of its way several times to talk about Laura's brown hair and how she didn't like it; the fact that Carrie is completely absent when, in actuality, she was born in Kansas (she is present in the book, but it was a fact that Laura altered when she wrote the books.)  In this film, she is completely written out.

Not to mention the fact that poor Mrs. Scott is portrayed as a psycopathic nut - (poor woman; in the book she nurses them during their malaria!)  And what's with Pa fighting a whole pack of wolves barehanded without so much as a scratch with Laura with him?  Ma would never have allowed Laura to go on any kind of cattle drive with Pa - Mary is disrespectful and outspoken to Mrs. Scott, etc etc.  Laura is way too bold and outspoken -she was actually quite a shy person in real life and mentions several times in the books about being afraid of strangers and afraid to speak to people.

This might have been a cute movie if it were just the story of pioneers, but to actually call it ""Laura's"" story and pretend that it's closer to the books than Michael Landon's original premiere movie in 1974 is inaccurate.",1202169600,43,1487,4.316546762589928

The acting is fresh, and much of the cinematography is first-class (although the camera became a little too shaky during some of the high-danger scenes in my opinion).  You really get a feel for what it must have been like travelling out to the plains and then living in that wild land for a period of time.  Simple sets, but beautifully depicted.

Super characterizations; I especially liked the way the Scot woman and Edwards were depicted.  And the comaraderie and dialogue between the 2 sisters, Laura and Mary was realistic and, at times, funny.  The director did a great job working with the little ones.

Very good casting overall.  I've seen the actress who played Caroline in another movie and didn't like her in the other role.  But she played Caroline to a tee in my opinion.  And the actor who played Charles is somewhat of a refreshing and more sober change from Michael Landon, even though the previous series a couple of decades ago was great for kids.

Thoroughly enjoyable.  Hope for more of this from Disney.",1193616000,4,1119,4.826315789473684
2475987,5,B000DZIGEY,"Is this really a Disney production? Seriously! Really? For the first time in many, many years you did ol' Walt justice!
This is a fine example of how to do a period TV series correctly. If you are a fan of the original ""Little House"" series (and a very good series at that!), you will notice a distinct difference between this version and the Michael Landon version. This newer one is, from what I have read, very close to Mrs. Wilder's original stories. It's this version of ""Little House on the Prairie"" that you will find a very realistic account of pioneer life in the latter part of the 19th century,  accurately portraying what it was like to leave a comfortable setting with family and friends about, to traveling to begin life anew hundreds of miles away. Cut off from all they knew as well as having their nearest neighbors quite a distance away, the Ingalls family learn to survive on their wits and skills, coming across the local (angry) Indians, meeting a life-loving free spirit, as well as a rather curt couple from Scotland.
Traveling by wagon was a trying experience, and this series shows that very well. Through cold weather, crossing a frozen river, rainstorms, the family made it after two months to their land in Kansas. You will find realistic portrayals of continued hardships and illnesses.
The Indians are seen from three different angles: the Scott's hate the savages and want them all dead; The Ingalls' feel that all people - no matter what race - have good and bad in them, and that the Indians are NOT savages and should receive the respect deserved to all folks; and Mr. Edwards is somewhere in between. Not PC, but not far right, either. It also hints of the atrocities that the American government did to the Indians, and also shows that the government screwed the white folks as well.
Except for Charles' extremely white teeth, all of the actors fit the time portrayed very well, including dirty and unkempt hair for the women, burly men who, you can just tell, smelled like they haven't showered in years, and even folks with foreign accents - something rarely seen in film versions of our earlier American history.
Fear of the unknown, concern over food (or lack thereof), the sounds on the prairie at night, the solitude of pioneer life, the fact that one had to be of a tough stock to handle all that came, hopes and dreams - this version of Little House actually puts meat on the bones of not just the Ingalls family, but of all American Pioneers.
I only wish the ratings were higher when originally shown on ABC TV back in 2005 so it could have been made into a weekly series. But then, it probably would have gone down hill after a few more episodes like so many others have. Better that we have the best.

Having just completed reading the entire Little House series of books to my kids, I would say they were much better off using thier own imaginations to envision what Laura Ingalls shared with us about this period her life. As a child, I loved the Michael Landon TV series and my children love it as well. It doesn't bother me that the episodes rarely accurately follow the story lines of the books, as it is instead like a continuation of the stories, depicting things that could easily have happened to the family. I find these shows much more suitable for my young children than the Disney movie.",1171670400,5,838,4.4480519480519485

2475990,3,B000DZIGEY,"Though i enjoyed this mini series (i HATED the old one in the 70's)

it generaly stayed on the ball with what was happening in laura's life

i missed a few scenes and the small bull dog discribed in the book

BUT

the BIGGEST flaw (wich i'm surprised no one has mentioned before me)

IT'S MISSING A CHARATER!!! LAURA'S LITTLE SISTER CARRIE!!!

i don't understand why the producers excluded her but right away i felt something was amiss and wheni figured out what it was it bothered me the rest of the time.

over all a good movie thogh",1164844800,4,535,4.343434343434343
2475991,4,B000DZIGEY,This is a great film when your in the mood for it. I like that it has been made to be close to the actual book. It is long if you try to watch it at once but it is broken up well to watch it in sections. When I watched it seemed as though it was exactly as I had imagined when I was reading the book. The parents parts were played really well. The end of the story was a bit flat. I would've liked to see further.,1162598400,3,413,3.6
2475992,5,B000DZIGEY,"I just watched this series!  It was really good.  I have read, re-read, and re-read too many times to count the entire series and this DVD was so true to the book.  I was really happy to see that, as I really can't stand the Michael Landon television series.  It was nothing like the book.  In some parts of this movie the scenes are made to look like the Garth Williams illustrations in the series.  (At least it looked that way to me.)  Anyway, I can't wait to show it to my kids tomorrow!",1161388800,,491,4.159574468085107
2475993,5,B000DZIGEY,"Finally, FINALLY, a faithful, honest return to Laura Ingalls Wilder's books. While I loved the series with Michael Landon, it really wasn't true to the books, especially after Season 4. He invented characters that never existed in the Ingalls lives; also, the Ingalls family settled in Walnut Grove, MN for a few years. Their main place of residence was in De Smet, South Dakota. So yes, the original series used some of the actual names and some actual parts from the books, but it wasn't what the real Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote. Maybe the writers should have wrote ""loosely based on the books by Laura Ingalls Wilder.""

However, Disney's version showed a more realistic, moving portrayal of what pioneer life and families were all about, how much they had to go through every day of their lives. It stayed true to the series, and to Laura Ingalls and her family. Who would have thought that a simple family would turn out to be one of the most celebrated American families in history? Excellent job, Disney!",1158192000,6,1010,4.771428571428571
2475994,4,B000DZIGEY,"I was never a big fan of the original T.V. series. And I picked this off the shelf at our library on a lark. But I enjoyed it very much. Indeed, I watched it several times before I had to return it.

Two things stood out. First, I think the series gave an excellent depiction of the heartache and risks of pioneer life. And I was very impressed with the young actress who played Laura, Lyle Chavarria. She was excellent as the plucky tomboy and also adorable with her lisp.",1153180800,4,473,4.2555555555555555
2475995,5,B000DZIGEY,This 4 hour miniseries is a delight to watch. it is way better than the show and all the actors give good performances. but the reason to watch it is it's beautifull scenery and it's good cineamatograpy.,1151539200,,203,4.513513513513513
2475996,5,B000DZIGEY,"As many, I have grown up on Michael Landon's ""Little House"" and have read all of the ""Little House"" books written by Laura Inagalls Wilder.

The original television series of the 1970s and 1980s was good, with a homey and warmth of family feeling to it, but strayed more and more from the actual writings of the LIW books as time went on.

This ABC/Disney version of ""Little House On The Prairie"" is much more closer to the actual books than any of the previous TV shows of the past. However, this 6 hours mini-series was not all completely accurate, and some of the camera shots could have filmed been better. But all in all, it is a very good program and well worth adding to your collection.

The acting by Kyle Chavarria and Danielle Ryan Chuchran was excellent, along with several of the other cast members. No, it is not Michael Landon with his Hollywood looking Charles Ingalls, but alot closer to the real Charles Ingalls as played by Cameron Bancroft in this version. This DVD gives you a more realistic insight as to how the pioneers actually lived back in those times, and the hardships and the family values that are rare to find in modern day time.

Get this DVD, you will enjoy it!!!!",1146009600,38,1198,4.506912442396313

Picture quality is superb, the story is as the original in many ways. Acting is excellent, if your a ""Little House"" fan you'll love this set. I would like to see more episodes made. This DVD set makes you feel good about life.",1145491200,7,352,4.348484848484849
2475998,3,B000DZIGEY,"I've just watched Disney's new release: Little House on The Praire, because I have been reading the books to them.

 I was very happy that Disney put a series out, because you are usually guaranteed a well directed and powerful acting if Disney is behind it.

 However I was very disappointed in a few things. First of all they did not ""stick"" the actual story that Laura Ingals wrote, and I think that is an insult to Laura Ingal's herself!! She was a wonderful woman and pioneer, who took the time and huge effort to make these stories available to our children of today. We could at least keep to the story.

 Also, I must say that some of the acting was very poor. Erin Cotrell needs to learn how to act. You can TELL she is acting, and it doesn't look genuine.

 PLEASE!!! Stick to the real story that Miss Laura wrote!!! I believe it's important to teach our children History of little girls in our past!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My children were also disappointed. After reading the books, the movie was a bit of a let down for them.",1143763200,4,1033,4.457446808510638

2476000,5,B000DZIGEY,"As a true ""Little House"" fan for my entire life, I always knew that the TV show, while wonderfully entertaining, was never really close to the true story of the Ingalls family adventures as depicted in the Little House books by Laura Ingalls Wilder.  I was aprehensive at first when this version took to air.  All of my anxiety melted away as I was taken back to my childhood days sitting during the cold winter reading the Little House books.  I was, at 33, re-inspired to re-read them all after viewing this mini-series! This was simply a wonderful treat.  I will definately encourage my daughters to view this mini-series after they are old enough to read the books. Michael Landon was wonderful, but this Little House, I feel, is closer to the real Laura Ingalls Wilder spirit.",1141430400,35,781,4.678832116788321
