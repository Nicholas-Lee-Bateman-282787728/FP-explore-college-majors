737603,2,6303941648,"No-no. Apart from the sketch in the laundry, this tape is simply not funny. The minigolf sketch contains ONE joke... which is repeated 20 times, and the hospital and Queen's guard sketches are below mediocre. Goodbye, Mr Bean.",979776000,2,226,4.973684210526316
737604,3,6303941648,"On the sixth Mr Bean tape, our 'hero' visits the open doors' day of an evening school, and he puts every single subject in embarrassment! He annoys people, yet he's pretty creative too... but, er, who laughs last laughs best, as you know... A quite OK Mr Bean sketch.
In the other sketch, Bean gets tired of waiting for the hairdresser to get ready, so he puts on the uniform himself. Not exactly to the benefit of the costumers. Another OK sketch, but decreasing in quality.
This is not the best Mr Bean tape but it's not the worst one either.",979776000,2,544,4.396039603960396
737605,4,6303941648,"This tape is among the better in the Mr Bean collection. The Exam and The Church are in fact really brilliant, while the other sketches are more mediocre. The short bonussketch in The Library is pretty good, though. Main drawback is that they've only put one single hour of entertainment on one entire video tape which makes it expensive and takes up space on your video shelf!",975196800,7,377,4.641791044776119

7856649,3,6303941648,"If you like Mr. Bean, I'm sure you'll like this one.

If you don't know who Mr. Bean is, and you're American, think Kramer or Steve Martin in The Jerk, but with more British issues. Those issues seem to be a fear of looking stupid, a need to be ""proper"" but still satisfy your own needs...

I like these two American actors, but I'm sorry to say I couldn't stand Mr. Bean.  I was held hostage during this video, honest.  That is the only excuse I can offer.",1185840000,,457,4.159090909090909

7856651,4,6303941648,Mr Bean?  Either you like this kind of humor or you don't.  My family likes to watch Mr. Bean on occasion.  We have several Mr. Bean VHS tapes.  Some skits are funnier than others.  You'll just have to give it a try and discover if you like Bean and pick your own fav skits.,1025481600,,274,4.0
7856652,5,6303941648,"This, and the Christmas tape, signify the pinnacle of the Mr. Bean series.  Every sketch on this tape is a winner - the day at Herrods, changing at the beach, and the classic Exam episode.  Don't forget the sermon snooze, a sketch so popular that when Rowan Atkinson did a college tour of his one-man show, he included it as the only Mr. Bean sketch in the entire 90 program (the rest was closer - generally speaking - to the verbal wit of his Blackadder persona).
Lots of laughs - echoes from when Mr Bean was fresh and funny.  Also, one might note that here we have the first appearence of Mr Bean's nemesis - the three wheeled car.",1013299200,7,634,4.310924369747899
7856653,3,6303941648,"This tape has its moments.  I liked seeing Christopher Ryan (of The Young Ones and AbFab fame) fear for his very virtue in the bathroom stall, for example.  But really, there are two fundamental problems with the final two episodes of Mr. Bean.  The first is forgivable - the Bean concept is stale, and thus not very funny.  This was inevitable, no doubt, so I won't blame Rowan Atkinson or Robin Driscoll on that.  In fact, they should be credited for stopping after this point - many (typically American) shows continue on long after the series has worn out.
The second problem is a big one - they've changed Mr. Bean's character a bit, at least to my mind.  I always thought that Mr Bean represents primarily childlike innocence and impishness.  Based on the opening credits, the literal interpretation I gave it was that Bean was either (a) the only man who was ""born yesterday""; or (b) an alien trying to figure out our world and culture.  Mind you, none of this bears much scrutiny, but these theories sort of explain the way he operates... simply, selfishly, innocently, naively... again, like a grown up child.  Here, in these last episodes, Mr. Bean takes a turn for the worse.  Instead of an innocent, he is spiteful; he is deliberately mean - doing things in order to tick people off rather than ticking them off simply by doing what comes naturally.
Rowan Atkinson is a brilliant comedian, with the rare gifts of both physical and verbal wit (witness Blackadder or Not The Nine O'Clock News for verbal humor).  This video is worth having - especially at the price offered. - for that if nothing else.",1013299200,2,1612,4.660777385159011
7856654,3,6303941648,"The laundrette sketch is pretty funny, as is the hospital skit.  But the Queen's Guard bit is just NOT funny.  The mini-golf bit is ok, but really goes beyond its limit.  This and the ""Unseen Bean"" (the actual final tape in the series) tape prove that the Mr. Bean concept was running dry in its latter days.
Still, since they are currently charging only about $.. for this video, it is worth getting.  The weak bits make up half the tape, but the other half is good enough to justify the price.",1013299200,,495,4.3478260869565215
