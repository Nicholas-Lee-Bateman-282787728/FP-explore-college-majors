8343810,4,B001UIE5NY,"Silly Spanish-language, Mexican-made (no subtitles) late 60's horror film with John Carradine as the requisite mad scientist.  Now mad doesn't necessarily mean evil but this guy is EEEVILLE.  The movie starts with a married couple very much in love.  The husband kicks off from who knows what and the wife takes him to the mad doc in the hopes that hubby can be brought back.  Doc promises just that if wifey will go out, kill young women, and bring back their blood.  Naturally he's full of bull.  As an added incentive he disfigures her face which can only be restored when she commits mayhem.  She goes to work with a gusto.  There is also a sub-mental mad doctor's assistant that at one point tries to sexually attack wifey.  Later as an apology and a token of his lust he brings her what appears to be a gallon of his own blood to give to the doc.  The cops, naturally, don't have a clue as to what's going on and are running around like headless chickens.  What a trip.  The DVD is excellent quality.  Recommended for fans of this type of craziness.",1414540800,,1055,4.460732984293194
8343811,3,B001UIE5NY,"""La Seora Muerte"" (evidently released in English in 1969 as ""Madame Death"") is a hammy 1967 combination monster movie and detective drama made in Mexico and starring B-movie king John Carradine as (what else?) a mad scientist trying to revive the dead. To get to the movie you have to endure numerous short trailers that cannot be fast forwarded through from films much worse than this one. Then Carradine (starring as Dr. Fadel) comes out to give a stand up lecture about what's about to happen (think it of as Criswell's part in an Ed Wood movie,) and the hokey credits begin to wryly amuse immediately. The plot is set in motion very quickly: Andrs (Victor Junco) dies of cancer, and his wife Marlene (Regina Torn) is willing to do anything to have him back. Desperate times call for desperate measures, and before you know it, Andrs is under a plastic bubble contraption in Carradine's typically hilarious lab, where he stays for the rest of the movie. Carradine and his hunchback assistant (it's a Mexican monster movie: every stereotype must appear to make a holistic whole) Laor (Carlos Ancira) come up with the plan to revivify Andrs: he must make Marlene into a half monster (her face makeup is the scariest effect in the whole movie) who will get the blood of young women by nefarious means. Fadel does this with what appears to be a heat lamp, but never mind, Marlene is now a monster. Sort of. She kills women when the ghostly apparition of John Carradine's disembodied head yells at her (which is a real distraction while driving.)

The film is noteworthy on many levels, and will be enjoyed by any Carradine fan regardless of their Spanish fluency (I had three years of Spanish in high school and college, but am embarrassed about how much I have forgotten.) Carradine is way over the top here, and his scenery chewing in the lab and as a disembodied head makes the movie worth it by itself. Never has as much grimace filled the screen in such a stunning way. Other features make this film enjoyable as a time capsule of 1960s Mexican cinema: the sets are laughable (the lab in particular is as cheesy as can be imagined, with lots of electronics surplus stuff all over the place, spinning things on the walls, pointless flashing lights, etc.), and the costuming is just wonderful, highlighted by the ethereal fashion shows. The designs on display particularly at the poolside fashion show must be seen to be believed: please note the comically excessive hats. I'm not singling out Mexico here: fashion was wretched throughout the entire world in the 1960s, of course, though few countries could pull off sombreros with swimwear with such panache. Beyond the ugly clothes, funny sets, and odd locations, another praiseworthy element is the music which harkens back to the infamous ""Manos: The Hands of Fate,"" which was being made around the same time right across the border in El Paso.

After Marlene starts her mission, she begins by interrupting a romantic tryst which she disapproves of. Returning to her bedroom, she finds her adorable lion cub (!) on her bed and a garrote in her dresser. I'm sure I don't have to fill in the blanks for you there, but I did have one question: she kills for the blood of young women, but why did she only take about a pint after death? That's just wasteful. When she gets the blood back to the lab the unlikeliest of romance plots rears its extremely ugly head when Laor reveals his feelings for Marlene, resulting in the glass bottle of blood breaking and Fadel whipping Laor for his misdeed. Talk about unsavory. (At least it's also unconvincing.) This will, obviously, require further killing, so back to the modeling agency Marlene goes, with the police closing in. I am sorry to report that Marlene even stalks a potential victim in a wax museum of monsters (that seems a likely place for a woman to wander into by herself alone at night doesn't it?) This is one of the unintentionally funniest bits of the whole movie: the scene involving accidentally falling into the arms of the Frankenstein monster is a hoot, and the mangiest Wolfman I've ever seen seals the deal.

As the movie concludes, Marlene once again gets strapped to Fadel's gurney in a procedure that I am not sure exactly how was supposed to work even if it went correctly, but thanks to Laor tampering with the ""Alto Voltaje"" lever, it goes horribly awry, leading to an exciting finale when Fadel throws the fateful switch, causing explosions and earthquakes, mostly seemingly created with sparklers and a few shovels of potting soil. Laor rescues Marlene, but is it too late for their love? You watch the intentionally ambiguous ending and find out!

This is the first time ""La Seora Muerte"" has been on DVD, and after seeing it you might wonder how it ever came to be rescued from obscurity. The print is not very good, and while no aspect ratio is listed, it is clearly not representative of the framing the audience is supposed to see, as vast swaths are trimmed from either side of the screen (this is especially noticeable during the credits, which are frequently impossible to read.) Having said that, it is a wondrous discovery for B-movie fans and especially fans of John Carradine's more obscure work (of which there is a lot out there.) I had only heard of this movie before, and I had always wanted to see it because of the legendary overacting of Carradine, and to a lesser extent by Torn (I especially appreciated their scene together near the end when Torn literally growled at Carradine!) I was not disappointed in the jamn department here, as every word about the over the top performances in this film that you may have heard is true. The colors look muddy in dim light (of which there is an abundance,) but the scenes filmed outdoors in the day look better than you might expect, particularly the garish costumes in the poolside fashion parade. An obvious disadvantage for English speakers is that there is no English audio track or subtitles, but don't let this frighten you away: although a few nonessential nuances might pass you by, the gist of the story is quite clear and requires no language skills to interpret (if I misinterpreted anything, I apologize,) though it does require the skillset of B-movie fans everywhere, which is to say, the ability to be entertained by wacky and off-kilter plotpoints, acting, and scenery in ways the filmmakers may or may not have intended.

""La Seora Muerte"" gets three stars for being a fun and entertaining John Carradine lost classic. It may not be the most suspense-filled or scariest monster movie ever made (quite the opposite, actually) but it's paced well, features lots of weird twists, and is something new for the Carradine completist.",1336521600,3,6734,4.761986301369863
