750909,5,6303968163,"This restored 1920 German film is a masterpiece in filmmaking. The sets may look cheap and unrealistic compared to today but that is the point. This is German Expressionism at its best. It creates a wild mood that is particularly effective and shocking. And unlike most old films that end in a tidy happy way, this film leaves you wondering and even more terrified. Brilliantly acted and directed. An alternate more modern score is also included as are trailers, restoration comparisons, and an informative German documentary about the history that led up to these types of films, the golden age of Germanic filmmaking.",1504742400,,619,5.019417475728155

750912,5,6303968163,"I enjoyed this German horror film because of the story itself but especially because of the unusual way it is presented, totally different than any other film that I saw. It is a 1920 75-minute silent film, slightly longer than other films of the time, that has been restored so that everything is clear, as if it were a new film. It made a huge impact upon people when it appeared because of the story and how it is told. It has the heavy-handed acting, often bulging eyes, and gestures typical of early silent films. But it is a German expressionistic film with German and English subtitles. Many people are familiar with expressionistic paintings. In this film, it is used in the strange designs of everything, doors, boxes, walls, streets, houses, drawings on walls, portrayal of the city from a distance, some strange clothes, and some strange makeup - there are no straight lines. The film has been given some colors: black, white, yellow, brown, and sometimes green and pink.
 The film is presented in six acts and is about murders apparently committed by a man calling himself Dr. Caligari who has a man in a box and claims that the man is 23-years-old, has been asleep for 23 years, and is able to be awoken and foretell the future. Caligari appears before an audience in a side show at a fair. A murder is committed on the first night of his appearance and on the second night.
The film has a surprise ending prompting us to rethink what we saw.",1494547200,,1455,4.574712643678161

751104,5,6303968163,"This wonderful film is one that every serious fan of horror and general cinema should own, and the Kino Classics blu ray is the definitive version.

The movie is packaged in a standard blu ray case with a high quality vertical slip cover and an insert with an essay about the making and influence of the film. All in all its nothing special but it gets the job done and the slip case is nice.

Visually this is as close to perfect as I can imagine a nearly 100 year old film could ever be. Damage leftover is minimal, everything is crystal clear down to fibers in clothing and brush strokes on the sets, and the tinting is absolutely striking. This is one of the best restorations of a silent era film I have ever seen.

As far as the audio, there are two tracks, a more ""traditional"" chamber score and a far more modern, experimental score by Paul D. Miller. The chamber score is phenomenal and feels inseparable from the film, like it should have always accompanied it. The music always perfectly conveys what's happening on the screen and succeeds in creating an unsettling atmosphere. There are also quite a few moments that are surprisingly and wonderfully unconventional, especially the scene where Dr. Caligari is being assaulted by the words ""Du musst Caligari werden!""
The Paul D. Miller score, while it doesn't feel difinitive like the chamber score, is mostly fantastic; an eclectic mix of music box like twinkling, ominous sub bass, jazz drums, organ, 80's horror soundtracks, and hip-hop beats. Most of the time, it works extremely well, but sometimes it suffers from sounding a bit too upbeat and it never really reaches the heights it does in the first two acts.
Both scores sound crystal clear, and the chamber score in particular sometimes feels like the orchestra is right there in the room.

The special features are somewhat sparse, but they're quality. The 52 minute documentary ""Caligari: How Horror Came to Cinema"" is very interesting and contains a lot of great footage and insight into the state of German society and cinema at the height of expressionism.
The image gallery is nice, and the restoration demonstrations, while brief, are truly eye-opening.

I cannot express enough how great this blu-ray is. This restoration is exraordinary and should be seen by everyone.",1473292800,9,2297,4.8346055979643765
751105,5,6303968163,"This review is for the Kino restoration of ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari""; it comes with 2 soundtracks, and I watched it with the score by the University of Music, Freiburg (rather than with the score by Paul D. Miller aka DJ Spooky).
This 1920 German silent horror film can be interpreted in so many ways as having any number of meanings. Watching it is like being in an avant garde Expressionist painting come to life. It's almost 100 years old, and still superior to the vast majority of films churned out by Hollywood in the past century.",1472515200,7,541,4.530612244897959

751107,5,6303968163,"This is piece is a testament to classic German Expressionism. This silent horror film from the 20s creates a surreal disturbing environment through expressions and imagery alone, making it an excellent work of art. I think this film is seriously underrated and was years ahead of it's time.

A seminal work in the history of cinema, this is generally believed to be the first horror film.  Its slanted, angular set designs are the real star, distinctive enough to set the tone for horror movies and thrillers right up until the present day.  It cannot have the same impact for modern audiences that it must have had at the time of its release, but it remains a satisfying experience, both for its engaging story and as an important artifact from the history of film.

751190,4,6303968163,"Tonights film is a classic, and by that I mean it was released in 1920, and is considered by Roger Ebert to be the first true Horror film, beating Nosferatu by two years. It has also been called the quintessential work of the German Expressinist movement.
The plot is a simple one. Dr. Caligari is an evil hypnotist who uses Cesare, a sleepwalker, as a prop in a sideshow act during the day, but at night, he uses him to commit murders. What makes this film as good as it is, is the weird tilted camera angles, and the very surreal sets, which looks like they could be the inspiration for most Tim Burton films. Come to mention it, Dr. Caligari looks kinda like Danny Devitos Penguin. With these simple tricks, the film gains a haunting, nightmarish feel to it.
What isn't simple is the metaphorical meaning behind the film. Dr. Caligari represents the German War Government, and Cesare, who is being conditioned, like the German soldiers to kill. This is especially important considering Hitler started the Nazi party a year later, and the films writers were both pacifists who distrusted the government after the war efforts of WWI. Since the Foreign Film Industry had relaxed it's
 restrictions on importing German films, the movie was released internationally, so maybe this was their way of warning the world about what was coming. Either way, it's a very important film, and a good way to spend an hour.
Scare Factor 2/10 It's a 96 year old silent film, so it's not exactly going to keep anyone up at night, but it does have its sinister qualities. The makeup on both Dr. Caligari and Cesare works wonderfully, giving them both a very ghoulish look, and the restored soundtrack is very subtle and creepy.
Gore 0/10 Not a drop of blood in this one, but once again, it's 96 years old.
Acting 8/10 You get very little of the over zealousness that usually accompanies the pantomime in silent films, and the Dr
is able to look completely evil using only his facial expressions, so you avoid the usually signs of corruption like rubbing the hands together in an evil way. It's higher quality acting than in many of the films of this era.
Recommended 6/10 In a perfect world, everyone should watch this film. However, I know once you say subtitles, you lose half of your audience, and when you add in silent film, you lose half of who's left, so I have a hard time recommending this to anyone except die hard film lovers. The good news is that if anyone is interested in seeing it, there has never been a better time. The 4k restoration gives the movie a clear, beautiful picture, and the sound is pristine. As of right now, it's available on Netflix, so if this interests you at all, I urge you to give it a chance.",1457049600,5,2715,4.563524590163935
751191,5,6303968163,A classic.,1455926400,,10,4.5
751192,5,6303968163,"Unique.  Not exactly a conventional horror film (murders happen off screen and are announced in writing, after the fact).  Everything is artfully handled.  The story is limited in scope.  Two men sit in what appears to be a garden, while one of them relates his tale of woe in a very long flashback.
He and his friend are vying for the attention of the same woman.  They visit a fair and witness Dr. Caligaris act.  He has a somnambulist named Cesare who tells fortunes.  Cesare tells his friend that hes going to die before dawn.  Lo and behold, hes murdered that very night!  Hmmm, is that a coincidence?  The friend thinks not and turns to his girlfriend (now that his only competition is dead) and her doctor dad.  They investigate their suspicions.......and discover that Dr. Caligari is the director of an asylum!!!

Loaded with symbolism and themes galore (Authority and Conformity, Abstractions of Social Fears, The Destabilization of Insanity and Sanity, Tyranny and Chaos).  Duality is used throughout, people leading double lives, mental stability and instability.  Not to mention the filmmakers thoughts on post-war Germany after WWI.

And then there are all those pesky sets, where all thought of perspective is abandoned for a hodge-podge of weird angles and shapes.  Sunlight and shadows are painted on the backgrounds in direct conflict with the actors populating this strange environment.  Its bizarre but artistic!  In 1920, this film was shocking to some audiences.  Today, its a curiosity that is compelling because it is so strange.  A glimpse into the mind of the insane.  Utterly fascinating.",1454803200,2,1615,5.064638783269962

751293,5,6303968163,A classic,1451347200,,9,4.0
751294,4,6303968163,"Upon watching this film the viewer must try to figure in when it was made. Given the limited resources available to the film industry in 1920 this is a remarkable effort.

Here's the scoop. In a small German town a fair is taking place. Dr. Caligari wants to be one of the attractions. He has with him a man who he claims has been asleep for some 26 years. But all of the sudden local folk are being murdered. Can they find the perpetrator of these dastardly deeds? Could it be Dr. Caligari?

At the time this was made it must have really been something. As part of the German Expressionist movement all the visuals are exaggerated. I doubt there is a 90 degree angle in the entire film and all the light and shadow aspects are equally exaggerated. Even the makeup is over the top. The viewer is thrown into a sinister world where evil people look evil. The story itself isn't all that spectacular given level of sophistication today's viewers are used to seeing. But, at the time, the movie-going experience was so new audiences must have been wowed.

This version is supposed to be the most complete available and it sports a pretty cool sound track. Many of the pieces sound like what one would expect from a German composer of the time, but the had enough discordant quality to further the sinister nature of the proceedings.

I'm not going to tell you this is the best movie you'll ever see, but it needs to be seen by true film buffs for the importance it played in film history.",1447891200,2,1485,4.448529411764706

Second, part of the richness in any film, this one in particular, is the painstaking detail put into the scenery and composition of each frame. Both of these aspects are completely lost in this version of the film, which is so blurry and of low resolution that you do well just to understand what is going on at all.

Several full versions of this film are available online in the public domain which have a much better quality.

751389,5,6303968163,"I love it for what it is ... it isn't Shakespeare, it's an old classic black & white horror movie.

This movie should be on everyone's watch list. You can see it's influence throughout modern horror films to this day. Yeah, it's black and white, and silent. Deal with it.

The first time I saw this movie I did not think much of it. I had to watch it for a college art class some (mumble mumble) 45 years ago. Luckily, I decided to give it another try as with old age, I have learned to love a lot of things I hated when I was young (bluegrass music being one of them) There are many things that place this film in your ""see before you die"" category. This movie is amazingly good and stunningly beautiful. A work of art as well as a movie! In the silent era there was no color but they made up for it with stunning sets. The design, the shadows, the warped artificial reality - The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari is both a classic in horror cinema. Over the years we've been blessed with restored presentations of the film, featuring excellent musical scores, and the movie is once again able to shine in its proper context, as it always deserved.

There is a truly profound eeriness to this movie and the silence actually adds to this. Here is a movie considered to be a German Expressionist classic. The Visual style had an influence on Tim Burton films (and that is clear) as well as it being one of the first movies to have a twist ending. The visual style is something to comment on because at this point in time, film was in it's very early stages. The visual style to this movie is wonderful. It suitably looks as if this entire movie is crazy (which it is). I also read somewhere the backgrounds were made entirely out of paper, which if that is the case only makes me further compliment it. I might be wrong on that though.

Set in a small German town called Altona, a young student, Francis, finds his closest friend, Alan, killed the night after a visit to an amusement park. The film focuses on our hero and his search for Caligari, Caligari and how he protects himself and his somnambulist, Cesare, from the suspicions of the police, and the police's suspicion of an innocent man. Not only does this work as a horror film but also as a psychological thriller. The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari was one of the most unusual movies that twists the mind of who is the hero and who is the fiend. The main character (Cesare) trying to help the damsel in distress would be more recognizable in Casablanca as Conrad Veidt (he played the lead German trying to trap Victor and Ilsa Laszo).

The story of the film is classic as of today, but in 1920 the movie was quite unique. The most unique feature of the film being that it was the first ever with a surprise ending. It's not one of those endings where clues pop up that give you an answer. It is actually one that also fits in with the story.

The film can be seen in at least two ways: as a well layered and effective thriller/horror film, or as an advanced piece of art. The sceneries in the film are unlike anything I've ever seen before or after, with Tim Burton's artsy sceneries in some of this more Gothic movies as the closest you'll get, style-wise. The director amazes with his use of shapes and lighting to emphasize the plot and enhance the effectiveness of it. It's a risky endeavor, but he perfectly balances the risks of the sets either becoming too unrealistic and unsettling on the one hand, or of being too much style over substance on the other. But the sets fits the story perfectly, in their own unique way. It's unlike anything you've ever seen anywhere else, but you certainly wouldn't want it looking any different either. It is hard to imagine the film looking different than what we're served here. Some people may not watch black and white movies, some people may not watch silent movies. Hell, some people may not watch movies from any country other than their own. Nevertheless, they should give this one a watch. It's got great atmosphere, fantastic visuals, a slim story that manages to grip you as it unfolds and just everything in the right amount that makes it a very deserving classic staying on the lists of many horror fans.

This was Robert Weine's masterpiece, and pretty much his sole claim of fame. All his attempts before and after this film to achieve something similar failed completely.

The actors in the film make good performances. Few of us have probably heard of most of the actors today, but many will probably remember Conrad Veidt (Cesare) from Casablanca or The Thief of Bagdad. This is a German expressionist film, a type of film that emphasize on the gestures of the actors to make its point, rather than sound. This is done in a very good way in this film. Conrad Veidt is particularly good in his part of the somnambulist, with a very artistic and elegant take on the role. Take special notice of the scene where he tries to kill Jane; perfection, worth every penny of the movie alone!

I will not say much more than that about the film, it has to be experienced! All in all, a truly unique and timeless film, as effective today as it was in 1920. So if you want to see a very interesting silent film about insanity, one of the first twist endings or want to see an influence on Tim Burton's visual style then this is for you. A true classic!

SPOILER ALERT
Francis (Friedrich Feher) and an older man are sitting in a garden, telling stories. A girl (Lil Dagover) walks past, unresponsive, as in a daze. Francis says she is his fiance Jane and that the story of how she got that way will be amazing.

It all started when a carnival came to his hometown of Hostenwall . . . (we go into flashback) . . .

Francis and his best friend Alan (Hans Heinrich von Twardowski) together with Jane go to the carnival for fun. They are enticed by an older mountebank (Werner Krauss) calling himself Dr. Caligari to enter his tent to see his amazing somnambulist Cesare (Conrad Veidt) who has been asleep for 25 years and, under Dr. Caligari's command, is about to awaken.

After some people enter the tent and sit down, Dr. Caligari opens a vertical cabinet shaped like a mummys sarcophagus, and we see Cesare is a gaunt young man who wakes and steps forward in extreme slow motion. Supposedly he spends his life sleeping in the cabinet and is able to predict the future when awake. Caligari brags that Cesare can answer any question whatsoever.

When Alan asks Cesare how long he has to live, the answer is that Alan will die before dawn tomorrow. This unsettling prediction cuts their fun short, so Alan, Francis, and Jane go home. Jane is particularly affected, since, at that time, she was Alans girl friend although she knew that Francis was also in love with her.

After night comes, we see, inside Alan's rooms, the shadows of Alan and his killer fighting on his bedroom wall.

Alan is found murdered the next morning. Francis goes to tell the police after he realizes the somnambulist's prophecy has come true. Suspicion turns to the eerie somnambulist and his strange handler.

Before police do anything, an attempted murder of an old woman takes place, throwing the town into panic.

Back at Dr. Caligari's wagon, we see him feeding gruel to Cesare as he sits in a coffin. When police knock at the wagon asking questions, they are shown Cesare inside the coffin, and Caligari protests that he doesnt ever leave the coffin without his permission.

At some point a common criminal confesses to the attempted murder of the old lady, so the police are back to investigating Alans murder only. Francis, along with Jane, keep investigating Caligari and Cesare. Caligari orders Cesare to kill Jane. Cesare creeps into Jane's bedroom and as he lifts a knife to kill her, she screams and faints. He carries Jane out of her house, leading the townsfolk on a lengthy chase. Cesare falls from a height to his death to end the pursuit.

The townsfolk discover a dummy in Cesare's cabinet, and that Caligari has fled.

Francis goes to a nearby insane asylum to inquire whether the fled Dr. Caligari might be a patient there. The worker he speaks with tells him he must go see the director of the institute for patient information, as he's not allowed to discuss any of that.

Francis goes to the director's office and it turns out the director and Dr. Caligari are one and the same person.

Francis gets the police over there and after looking through books and notebooks in the office, they discover a historical book about a mythical Caligari, who did just what Dr. Caligari is doing now, back in 1793 in northern Italy. The XIth century Caligari used a hypnotized somnambulist to murder people. The director has notes to suggest he is trying to recreate the XIth Century events.

When the director arrives, after being confronted with the dead Cesare, he goes nuts, saying he must become the new Caligari, so staff in the institute put him in a straight jacket. His mania is manifest, and he is confined in his own asylum.

At this point the flashback is over. The expressionist look of buildings is gone. Francis and the man who was told the story wander back from the garden to the institute patio. Cesare is standing in the corner and Francis warns the older man not to accept one of his prophecies, for he would surely die.

Jane is there also, and when Francis asks her to marry him, she says she cannot marry someone not of royal blood.

Then down the stairs comes Dr. Caligari (the director), and Francis quickly gets in a scuffle with him. Francis is grabbed by the staff and taken upstairs.

Dr. Caligari comes to the conclusion that Francis is a maniac and that his mania is caused by his delusion that Dr. Caligari is in fact the mythic Caligari who would wander from town to town with Cesare killing townsfolk.

The twist ending reveals that all of the flashback is actually Francis delusion, symbolized in the film by the distorted buildings and landscapes. Francis, Jane and Cesare are all inmates of the insane asylum, and the man he calls Caligari is the asylum director. The director, after this revelation of the sources of his patient's delusion, says that now he should be able to cure Francis.",1443571200,,10202,4.5353645266594125

751475,5,6303968163,"The 1920 German silent classic The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is incontrovertibly one of the most important films in cinema history, but controversy rages when it comes down to details. Seen by many as representing the essence of German Expressionism it is possibly the very first art film, demonstrating that cinema could be much more than a mere fairground attraction. The emphasis of production design (groundbreaking work from Hermann Warm, Walter Reimann and Walter Rhrig) and psychologically complex writing (a masterful script by Hans Janowitz and Carl Mayer) over photography (static nondescript work from Willy Hameister), minimal editing and even bland direction (Robert Wiene never did anything else worthy of note and was in any case producer Erich Pommers second choice after Fritz Lang pulled out) makes it radically different from the narrative-driven American films of D. W. Griffith on the one hand and the Russian propagandistic montage of Sergei Eisenstein on the other. The film ushered in the now famous claustrophobic angst-ridden paranoia-inflected studio-bound style of Weimar Republic cinema which stretched through the 20s most successfully in the films of Lang and F. W. Murnau. Here production designers assumed great importance for perhaps the first time in cinema history with famous names such as Hans Dreier, Rochus Gliese, Albin Grau, Otto Hunte, Alfred Junge, Erich Kettelhut and Paul Leni all making their reputations. With the rise of Nazism many of them along with writers, cinematographers, directors and actors were forced into emigration and their work had an incalculable influence on mainstream Hollywood cinema especially in the genres of horror and film noir. Indeed, many consider The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari to be cinemas first horror film  Universal Studios pioneering horror films of the 1930s (eg; Frankenstein [1931], The Mummy [1932], The Black Cat [1934] and The Bride of Frankenstein [1935]) are unthinkable without it. The film also impacted on future art cinema as the work of Ingmar Bergman, Luis Buuel, Roman Polanski, David Lynch and others all attest to even if many deny it.

History is one thing, but debate hangs over The Cabinet of Dr. Caligaris central meaning. The film blatantly does not make sense no matter how we choose to read it. It is neither a radical attack on authority (Janowski) nor a conformist endorsement of the same (Kracauer), even if elements of both are there. To call it a portrayal of madness is closer to the truth, though clearly we must try to see the method in the madness to do this film justice. Jungians will find acres of meaning in the many dualities which pepper the script while art historians will note that madness (coming originally out of early 19th century Romanticism) is a central ingredient of the Modernist project including of course Expressionism. But people like David Robinson question if the film is a bona fide Expressionist work of art at all. Some see it as a mere exercise in commercial exploitation. Many have noted that the heyday of German Expressionism had long gone even by 1919 and the assumption of entirely spurious Expressionist style at this late stage was no more than a commercial gimmick from the German film industry to win back international audiences lost to Hollywood during WWI. Contrary to Expressionism the traditional linear narrative does attempt logical cause and effect progression with the sharply angled deliberately abstract sets seeming to be mere decoration. The films other producer Rudolf Meinert is even on record telling the design team to make the sets as crazy and eccentric as possible merely because Expressionism was fashionable and was bound to turn a profit. The lack of any authorial voice and conflicting accounts of the films making given by those involved make it impossible to assess finally whether the film was meant by its makers as art or as popular entertainment. This questions the need for us to read the film at all  why search for depth when everything exists on the surface? I would venture to say that the film works both as art and as commercial entertainment. As Mike Budd says in his commentary on this DVD the film is essentially about how one informs the other  how art (Expressionism) is introduced into popular entertainment and how popular entertainment feeds into art. This is rendered obvious in the films dichotomy between the story (told in the traditional linear continuity of popular entertainment) and the mise-en-scne (constructed in the aggressive discontinuity of abstract Expressionist style). The framing story where our narrator is proven unreliable (he is mad) suggests that contrary to appearances the opposite is actually the case. It is the linear narrative which is mad and the abstract sets which are normal. Art and popular entertainment are therefore welded seamlessly into one where subjectivity is rendered objective and objectivity is rendered subjective.

I would argue that the rationale behind this dichotomy which suggests that what is sane is actually insane and vice versa lies in the films reflection of the realities of Weimar Republic Germany just after the war. All art and popular culture cannot help reflecting the prevailing socio-economic and political conditions and there is no doubt that Germany was mired in chaos (madness) caused by a huge vacuum at the center of the power structure with far left Communist groups like the Spartacists doing bloody battle with far right groups like the Freicorps on the streets of Berlin and Munich. It is with this in mind that Siegfried Kracauer (writing in 1947) sort to interpret Weimar cinema as reflecting Germanys need for a strong leader (a tyrant) to fill this vacuum. As the title of his book From Caligari to Hitler suggests, for Kracauer Dr. Caligari is the first of a series of tyrants (two others are Mabuse and Haghi) who function as premonitions of Hitler. For me this view is too retrospective (satisfying a knee-jerk immediate post-war necessity to explain Nazism with the aid of convenient hindsight which exaggerates the importance of some films at the expense of others) and fundamentally flawed given the film fails to endorse authoritarian control. I would link Caligari less with speculations into the future and more with Germanys past going back to the Enlightenment and the birth of the Modernist impulse in Romanticism. If we must search for authoritarian leaders that connect with Caligari then Hegels world-historical figures (Napoleon or Julius Caesar  Caligaris insomniac is named Cesare after all) are much more apposite with the volksgeist bowing to the weltgeist in the belief that the State is the highest form Man can aspire to. The general thinking is that Modernism (and Expressionism in particular) grew out of the madness of WWI, but I think it important to see that conflict did not just happen out of the blue. It was the culmination of over a century of furious socio-economic and political transformation in Europe wherein countries and societies were destroyed and created with the Industrial Revolution affecting everyones daily lives. Beginning in the 18th century, this transformation which is paralleled with a corresponding move away from Deism to Atheism (from belief in the achievements of God to belief in the achievements of man) was celebrated as a positive in Romantic art, but from the beginning there was doubt and an acknowledgment that something mad was lurking in the human condition. This is expressed most obviously in the legend of Faust as rendered most influentially by Goethe in the quintessential Romantic work which punishes a man with madness for selling his soul to achieve self-expression. The second half of the 19th century saw Darwin, Marx, Nietzsche and Freud throwing away all the old certainties  of belief in God, in class, in fellow man, even in one's self. Mirrored by the emergence of new industrial centers and the breakdown within societies across Europe (especially within the Austro-Hungarian Empire), it is no surprise that madness became an ever-present theme in art and is in fact synonymous with the whole Modernist project. Freuds The Interpretation of Dreams (1899-1900), Totem and Taboo (1913) and Civilization and its Discontents (1929); Thomas Manns Death in Venice (1911) and The Magic Mountain (1924): Franz Kafkas The Trial and The Castle; Joseph Conrads Heart of Darkness (1902); T. S. Eliots The Wasteland (1922); James Joyces Ulysses (1914-1922) and Finnegans Wake  these are all key Modernist works which deal with the madness of the Modern Age. All the arts saw a breakdown from realism to abstraction, in music most especially with Schoenberg and the Second Viennese School and in painting from Impressionism through Post-Impressionism, Expressionism, Futurism, Dada and Surrealism on to ever greater abstraction.

Seen like this, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is simply another vision of contemporary insanity, but not one tied just to WWI and the Weimar Republic, but bedded within the established Modernist tradition that stretches back a long time before it. Carl Janowitz may have based his script on his own experiences at the hands of a psychiatrist during the war  he avoided the draft and had to undergo rigorous tests. Pacifists as both he and Carl Meyer were, they both clearly meant the film as a radical attack on authority. Caligari (an extraordinarily sinister Werner Krauss) represents an autocratic leader who forces his people represented by the somnambulist Cesare (Conrad Veidt scary yet strangely sympathetic) into killing against their will. Francis (Friedrich Fehr) is the hero of the narrative (the good German) who attempts to unmask the killer of his friend Alan (Hans Heinrich von Twardowski). The film depicts a series of authority figures (the town clerk, two policemen and finally Caligari himself) who all exist up stairs ('on high') which Francis has to negotiate in his investigation. He finally discovers the truth and follows Caligari to his home which proves to be a lunatic asylum. Further to that Caligari is not an inmate  he is in charge of the institution. If Caligari is the leader and the people are Cesares all doing what they are told then the asylum is Weimar Republic Germany or even perhaps the prevailing societies of all Europe c. 1919. The film as Janowitz and Meyer originally had it ends with Caligari found out and institutionalized, Francis winning the day. Unfortunately for them, the producers (on the suggestion of Fritz Lang which Wiene in turn endorsed) added a framing story wherein the narrator of the story is specifically identified as Francis at the beginning and at the end he is seen to be mad, making the whole film a vision of madness. This contradicts Janowitz and Mayers attack on authoritarianism, turning it into a vindication of authoritarianism instead. This is what Kracauer leapt on to make his point that the film reveals the collective subconscious German impulse to embrace a tyrant. Following on from this the main narrative of the film shows Holstenwall to represent Germany, a manic depressive place where people have a choice between organized leadership (a tyrant) or chaos as represented by the fairground. Of course, this doesnt stand up either especially when we learn something that Kracauer wasn't privy to. The framing story had been in place in the original script from the beginning albeit in altered form  the film starting with Francis and Jane (Lil Dagover) telling the story to a party of guests on the terrace of their house, but finishing on Caligaris institutionalization in a fulfillment of Janowitz/Mayer's original intentions.

The framing story as we have it really fractures any consistent meaning in the work and we are left to fall back on the films central depiction of madness which comments on the effects of WWI and the Weimar Republic, but actually has its roots in pre-war German Expressionism that was most powerful in the years 1905-1913 (the Dresden-based Die Brcke group comprising of Kirchner, Bleyl, Heckel, Schmidt-Rottluff, Nolde and Pechstein) and 1911-14 (the Munich-based Der Blaue Reiter group including Kandinsky, Jawlenski, Werefkin, Macke, Marc, Mnter, Feininger, Bloch and Klee). Warm, Reimann and Rhrig were all part of the Der Sturm circle of Expressionist artists and one look at the famous painters of the these groups show an affinity with Die Brcke and with the fierce angularity of Ludwig Kirchner in particular. Of course Expressionism is all about the subjective visual depiction of psychological states of mind and in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari we have to decide whose mind is deciding the way everything is shown. Francis is posited by the framing story as the overall narrator and the abstracted sets may depict his mentality  we notice how angular the houses, trees, walls and windows are when he is in a threatened state, but how rounded the dcor becomes when he is around Jane and her house and is more relaxed. This is undercut however by the fact that the final scene after he is unmasked as mad is also abstract. This raises the possibility of Caligaris perception dictating the whole mise-en-scne. It is significant perhaps that only he and Cesare seem to feel at home in the crazily abstracted world that surrounds them. Everyone else around them look ill at ease and out of place as if they are awaiting corruption from the pair of them. Note especially the fierce angular lines on Jane's dress as she approaches Caligari and Cesare's tent at the fair. Contrasting with the circular designs of her house which seem to indicate Francis' relaxed frame of mind, the dress here seems to indicate Caligari and Cesare's newly awakened erotic interest in their next victim. Undoubtedly it suits Janowitz/Mayers attack on authority more if everything is seen through Caligaris perspective  his final institutionalization is a powerful image of authority being indicted, as is possibly the very last shot of the film which has Caligari seeming to care for his patient, but actually staring into the camera and leaving us with a very unsure sensation as the film seems to vindicate authoritarianism after all. Of course a third possibility exists, that the film attempts to visualize from the point of view of a third person omniscient narrator how 1919 audiences would see the story of authority being attacked and then vindicated in a madmans vision. Like all great modernist art of the time weren't the films creators trying to get audiences to look at themselves and question the madness of the world that surrounded them, not just as a result of the war, but as an end result of over a century of social transition? Whichever way we look at the film it is obviously of far more than just historical value. We don't have to tie ourselves up in knots trying to analyze in order to appreciate this film as it works as a purely visceral experience as does many a horror film in the future. Never again will this extraordinary 'Expressionist' mise-en-scene be repeated however, and never will we have such effective central performances as those given by Krauss and Veidt here. Watch Caligari silently manipulate Cesare from beside his coffin at the fair or Cesare materialize out of a wall to enter Jane's room. Certain scenes such as Cesare's rooftop escape with Jane, or his death as his body takes up the angular shapes of the surrounding trees take their place among the very greatest, the most iconic shots of all cinema.

This is a review of the old 2000 release on Eureka before Masters of Cinema came along. It has an outstanding commentary by Mike Budd and also a 5 minute clip from Robert Weine's 1920 feature Genuine. Reading reviews of the new MoC version I would suggest that is the version to go for rather than this one. The packaging is more substantial and there's a new commentary by David Kalat. More important, that print has been given the usual remastering treatment that comes from MoC and should be better than the quality here. This one isn't bad, but there is a thick line which runs across the top of many scenes as well as obvious wear and tear on the print. Other reviews here praise the immaculate quality of the newer transfer and that should be the one to get.",1436054400,4,16290,5.06371087928465

All except one reel is from the original negatives, and the missing reel is remade from a mix of the best remaining print versions available.  The monochromatic colorization process chose colors based on the earliest remaining print versions (from South America of all places for a German film).

At 77 minutes, this was a long movie for the time, and despite some imperfections remaining in the film quality none are ever too distracting, even on 50"" modern TV screens.  The clarity is very good, and reveals details in both faces and set pieces I had never picked up on before in older versions. Given this was a visual work, it almost seemed like I was watching it for the first time. The monochrome colorized acts, some where everything is blue, sometimes everything yellow, sometimes pink based on time of day, location, etc. look great.

I'll let others describe the details of the plot, but basically this was the first ""German expressionism"" film and came out around 1920, with a spooky, carnival side-show vibe. The set was very intricate for the time and highly stylistic, with odd angled buildings, lots of shadow, and various disjointed features that look like something Tim Burton would have done if he was alive then.  The movie is subtitled and has options for two different musical scores, one from the time period and one new. Starts a little slow but with a great ending, one which seems surprisingly sophisticated for the time but just probably means we are a little snobbish in how we think about the past today.

Bonus features are awesome.  The booklet is not to Criterion standards, but is still very nice.  Includes a still gallery that has some original movie posters, and most impressive is a 52 minute German (english subtitles) documentary that while highlighting the film also touches on a dozen others and is chiefly about the post World War I impact on German film making.

751785,5,6303968163,"Finally there is a version of THE CABINET OF DR CALIGARI that shows it in such a way that it is now possible to understand the impact that the film must have had on audiences in 1920. Of course in order to fully achieve that effect it is necessary to try and view CALIGARI as a product of its time and realize that it is more an example of Expressionist art than a traditional movie yet its influence was profound. This new Blu-ray incarnation featuring the latest digital restoration techniques really brings out the artistic design of the sets with their harsh painted images and distorted angles. Never has the movie more resembled a work of art than it does here. In addition to the stylized sets, the remarkably theatrical make-up worn by Caligari (Werner Krauss) and Cesare (Conrad Veidt) has never been more available for study. Freeze a frame or two during their first appearance together and see how flamboyant and intense it is.

Although the immediate horror impact of CALIGARI has long been diminished by the more explicit movies that have followed in the nearly 100 years since it was made, it still remains the stuff of nightmares as its images seep into your subconcious mind and will linger long afterwards even if you aren't fully aware of it. That is something that CALIGARI's creators were striving for. For those who aren't familiar with the story, it's a relatively simple one. A series of horrific murders in a small town can be traced to a mysterious doctor at the local fair and the sleepwalker he exhibits. The allegorical nature of the symbolic figures of the film with what happened to Germany as a result of World War I are easy to see and show how it is possible for the power of genuine art to transcend time and space and remain valid although in a different way than when it was first created.

In addition to the quality of the restored images, what makes this release so valuable is the 52 minute documentary on the making of the film and an overview of German silent cinema. The restoration comparisons between now and 30 years ago shows just how far film preservation has come and how it is possible for these movies from another time and place and from a completely different mindset to still have the power to enthrall, move, and enlighten us. Of the many fine efforts from the F.W. Murnau foundation which has brought us quality versions of METROPOLIS and NOSFERATU and the DOCTOR MABUSE films, this version of THE CABINET OF DR CALIGARI now takes top honors. An absolute essential to anyone interested not only in the cinema of the Weimar Republic but in the history and the power of the movies themselves.",1417737600,19,2646,4.651709401709402
751786,3,6303968163,"The scenery in this movie is quite surreal, something I did not expect in a silent film. The story of the movie is fine, the way they put it together is jarring, it jumps from one scene to the next and sometimes there seems to be no connection to the scenes. But you should be able to follow the plot even with the disjointed jumps. The one thing that I really liked about the Kino version was the Avant-garde jazz soundtrack, of which I am not a fan, but it seemed to suit this movie quite well, It is worth a watch.",1417392000,2,517,4.078431372549019
751787,5,6303968163,"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,"" the 1920 German silent classic, is available in a new restoration on Blu-ray. Since its release, the film has been hailed as a masterwork of world cinema and a cornerstone of screen horror that influenced the genre for years to come. Universals Dracula and Murders in the Rue Morgue, in particular, owe their look in large part to Caligari.

Director Robert Wiene and a team of production designers crafted an eerie realm in which light, shadow, and substance are abstracted  a world in which a demented doctor (Werner Krauss) and a carnival sleepwalker, Cesare (Conrad Veidt), perpetrate a series of ghastly murders in the small community of Holstenwall. The stylized sets, many two-dimensional, provide an expressionistic, dreamlike feel to the atmosphere-heavy film that takes the viewer into a world of insanity and nightmare.

The new, color-tinted edition contains an orchestral score, the 52-minute documentary Caligari: How Horror Came to the Cinema, image gallery, and booklet containing a critical essay.",1416787200,5,1044,5.353658536585366
751788,2,6303968163,"This is a well done restoration with good resolution. However there are numerous scenes where black areas show pixilation and digital tiling. This happens in several instances when the camera irises in/out during a closeup or scene change. It is also visible on the backs of the silhouetted audience during Caligari's show. It can be scene as small clusters of slightly brighter blocks which are constantly moving in the black areas. Some scenes look fine, but there are several with the problem. This is due to compression errors during mastering, not the film itself. Kino mastered the film brighter than it should be, which is part of the problem because it makes these issues more noticeable. The European version of this title uses the same master, but it is darker, so the artifacts are less obvious. Many people won't notice it or will assume it is part of an old movie, but it is really the result of sloppy mastering. It's a shame because it is a nicely done restoration otherwise. Hopefully Kino will release a corrected version with a higher bitrate, which should fix the problem. I will be returning my disc until then.",1416787200,10,1131,4.805128205128205

The extras are typical, the case is gorgeous along with the front cover artwork. Also, you get a choice of two music scores and both are good in their own right. The running time comes in at 77 Minutes, which is longer than the running times of other versions. I ended up preordering it because I love the classics and it was well worth it. The movie itself is a masterpiece especially artistically. I liken this film to watching people live within a German expressionist painting. The film has a sense of a murder mystery and a slasher film. The ending can be taken any number of ways making it have its own unique symbolism. I would say its like a nightmare or a vivid dream. Even though, this film was originally released as a black and white film...this one comes in color-tinting which is how some theaters showed it in its heyday. Nonetheless, good film for classic lovers(be warned this film has no spoken dialogue). For under 20 dollars, this is the definitive Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and it looks better than ever!

Conrad Veidt, always a very fine actor, didn't have to act at all. He just had to do a zombie impression through the entire film. Personally, I was not very impressed with this highly revered film.

As his story begins we are subjected to a weird world of light and twisted shadows. A strange Dr. (Caligari played by Werner Krauss) brings a somnambulist (sleeping man played by Conrad Veidt) to a local fair. The somnambulist knows all things and can predict the future; he prophesizes correctly Allan's (friend of Francis and rival for Jane's hand) murder and pilfers Jane from her bed chamber. But how can this be; as Francis has been keeping an eye on the doc and the snoozer all night and they have not moved?

HD digital generation. Metropolis, White Zombie, Nosferatu, and now Das Gud Herr Doktor Professor Caligari
are reborn and restored to their former glory thanks to the efforts of Kino. They deserve a special

and has a percussion issue: there is entirely too much of it and I hate it. The other is far more period appropriate

Isn't it technically possible to remove all the title cards and put that same text on the film as subtitling? I am sure the filmmakers would approve of that change, and would have done it themselves if they could have.

The ""twist"" ending is famous, but I didn't quite catch it, as I was also reading the newspaper, having become frustrated at the ever-so-slow pacing, and only figured it all out after reading the excellent Wikipedia article on the film.",1369526400,,1111,4.517412935323383
752060,5,6303968163,"Upon it's initial release the film was called vulgar, juvenile, and disgusting. Well, I have some good news for you... it still is!

The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari has an attitude problem. The film wants nothing more than to punch you right in the face. Visually extraordinary, stylistically legendary, and thematically revolutionary, The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari is one of the best and one of the very first horror films ever produced. And the film is psychologically insane. Modern storytelling isn't nearly this good.

Robert Weine was an interesting figure in the history of film. Though he would never make something as triumphant as The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari ever again, he would still have moments of genius periodically throughout his later career. Most notably with The Hands Of Orlac in 1924, another picture starring Conrad Veidt, and though it is incredibly slow paced, The Hands Of Orlac is ultimately satisfying and rewarding. But it's The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari that I am here to appreciate. It is the performances of Werner Krauss and Conrad Veidt that I am here to remember and happily lull.

Visually, The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari might be the most influential film ever made. I honestly doubt whether German Expressionism would have hit the western world the way that it did had it not been for Caligari. Metropolis certainly wouldn't have existed, Film Noir would not have developed in quite the same way, and modern filmmakers like Tim Burton and Guillermo Del Toro would be visionaries without a vision had it not been for Caligari.

It is an incredible film, and I highly recommend it. Modern psych-thrillers don't even come close to matching Caligari's complex and completely absorbing tale of murder, insanity, and possession. The dynamic of substance and style are equally matched throughout the film. Cheers, Weine, for a film that will live forever!",1369008000,4,1875,5.038709677419355

The music is excellent and hauntingly obscure and perfectly suited. The costumes, makeup and photography are perfectly rendered to add this remake of the original macabre story beautifully. I am still sort of torn about the way the actors approached this. In one way it seems to be stylized acting that fits the subject matter in a rather soap opera-ish style. Sometimes it works perfectly, and other moments seem too ordinarily current american personality wise. The acting is more in line with that of a stage play, but its actually pretty good over all. I have to say this production is a notable and gallant effort that pays memorable honor to the original. Im not sure why some members here didn't get the gist of this.

752144,5,6303968163,"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari - 1920

I've just experienced, quite possibly, one of the most beautiful films I have ever, ever seen.

The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is considered one of the best horror films of the silent era.  Filmed in the dark and twisted film movement of German Expressionism, falling into the storyline is akin to falling into a dream/nightmare abstraction of light & shadow combined with distorted shape & size that lasts an unbelievably short 75 minutes.  Not too far into the film, it becomes beautifully obvious that Tim Burton must be a fan of the movie, if not the director himself.

Th Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is the very first movie *of all time* to employ the use of a twist-ending.  Not only that, it was also one of the very first movies to be non-linear.  It begins with the telling of a memory; a re-tellling of the past bringing it to the present *with some extra memories thrown-in* and beyond.

Basically it's about a crazed doctor (Dr. Caligari) paired with a somnambulist who have a carnival show and go about commiting 'ghastly murders' at night in a German town.  The cabinet referred to in the title is the box (that looks like a coffin) the somnambulist sleeps in.  The word 'somnabulist' is used quite frequently in the film.

The film is surprisingly in color in that it was filmed in different sepia tones; brown and blue most predominately.  This adds to the general creepiness of the film but the acting can't be overlooked either; it's simply brilliant.  The sets are a tribute to a mind on mushrooms ... they're beautifully distorted in the way realism truly is.

Definitely, definitely a must watch for those who truly enjoy good film.  It's a horror film, to be sure, but this truly ranks as one of the best movies I've ever watched.  Incredibly artsy-fartsy, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligary is a trip into the imagination of the director and one I'll be tripping into again very, very soon ...

*Somnambulist - look it up ...

*After you watch the film, share with me where  you see ""Jack"" from Tim Burton's ""Nightmare Before Christmas"".
So wonderful to see the hand of a past director pressed in a firm handshake against the palm of a present one.",1354924800,5,2193,4.62015503875969
752145,5,6303968163,This is a great German silent film.  I really liked seeing the German actors of that time.  It's very clever and magical and truly ahead of its time.  Easy to see why this is one of Tim Burton's favorite movies.,1345161600,,211,4.225
752146,5,6303968163,"""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" fascinated me and gave me chills every step of the way! This is a brilliant film that deserves its place on the short list of just about any fan of horror films and especially early silent-era horror films. Some people even consider this to be the first true horror film; not a single earlier shocking film could match this one! The acting is flawless in every respect; the use of make-up reflects great forethought. The use of color tinted film, the English intertitles with the original artwork and the musical score help set the atmospheric tone for the film as the movie employs both realist and stylized expressionist techniques and settings. The sets, some of which were primarily made of paper, have nightmarish, slanted and distorted views of streets and more to frighten the audience and suggest madness.

We first see two men talking in a courtyard one night; one of them, Francis (Friedrich Feher), tells a shocking tale to the other. Francis speaks of an elderly man, Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss), who wandered into the town of Holstenwall where a fair was about to begin. We see Caligari get a permit for his ""exhibit,"" a somnambulist named Cesare who responds to his commands--and the questions of others when they ask him their future. While Caligari gets his permit, the town clerk, in a very bad mood, gives him a hard time and Caligari doesn't like that one bit.

Meanwhile, two friends Francis and Alan (Hans Heinrich von Twardowski) go to the town fair for amusement. But things change quickly; indeed, the rest of their day is anything but fun. Francis and Alan attend Dr. Caligari's exhibition of Cesare the somnambulist; but Alan becomes quite fearful when Cesare predicts that Alan will only live until the dawn of the very next day! Moreover, Alan and Francis are both in love with the beautiful Jane Olsen (Lil Dagover); they agree to let Jane decide which of them she will marry but each one fears a bitter disappointment if she chooses the other.

Tragedy comes as things quickly go from bad to worse. First the town clerk is found dead; and then the next day Alan is found dead just as Cesare predicted! Francis suspects that Cesare might have committed the murders although he has no real evidence to go on. A third murder almost takes place although this time a man is apprehended before he can commit the crime--and all of them, including the police, must wonder if this man, Cesare--or perhaps even someone else--is perpetrating and attempting these terrible crimes.

Naturally, there's much, much more than this to the plot; but I will leave out the rest so as not to spoil it for you! You'll be glued to the screen as you watch this amazing film. Pay close attention to the ending which has a most shocking, completely unexpected finale.

""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" will appeal to anyone interested in well done, classic horror films especially if they are from the silent movie era. The use of both realist and stylized expressionist techniques and settings along with a wealth of creativity make this picture a remarkable work of art as well.",1344297600,,3112,4.776951672862453

Crazy old Dr. Caligari finds himself a ""somnambulist"" finally, a guy who never wakes up, and uses him to commit murders as he travels around in traveling circuses.  He keeps him in a coffin like box.

Finally we see the straighjackets appear at the end when the Dr. gets put in one and thrown in a cell at the asylum.  This was interesting as an old German film.  No one does gloom like the Germans.

I found the sets interesting, as it clearly is done the way plays are done, each scene looking like a stage play with backdrops and sets.  Nothing but jagged sharp shapes throughout.

752208,4,6303968163,"I've read everybody else's review of the movie and can't add much more about that -- however, I would like to review the extra, GENUINE.  It says it's about a vampire, but if you think it refers to the blood-sucking kind, you'll be very disappointed.  Back when the film was made, ""vampire"" also meant what we'd call a ""vamp"" today:  a definite bad girl with a hypnotic power over men, used to ultimately destroy men.  When seeing this film, I recommend that you try to keep in mind that this was before the sound era and that the acting style which we'd nowadays consider campy was necessary back then to spell out for the audience what was supposed to be going on.

GENUINE starts out as a high priestess of a (presumably) peaceful tribe which gets invaded and defeated by an obviously Arab tribe.  Mistreated after her capture, she ends up in a slave market beside a couple of downright lethargic women.  Then she attracts the attention of an elderly (presumably German) guy who gets warned that she's been made savage -- which she displays by biting the hand of the slave seller's henchman (the only scene of blood drawing in the entire short, by the way).  The old man, obviously attracted to crazed, savage women, purchases her on the spot, brings her back to his country and installs her in a secret chamber that would be perfectly at home in any Dr. Seuss cartoon.  She spends most of her time languid on the chaise(?) of her quarters.  But once a week, the old guy summons the town barber to maintain the hair he has left, and this gets the town talking so much that the barber has to be interrogated about it -- which, of course, means he has to get his son to sub for him with the old man.  The son, with the most ridiculous hairdo outside of a Coen brothers movie, quickly discovers GENUINE, which leads to murder, attempted murder, the arrival of the old man's grandson (GENUINE's next victim), another attempted murder, all of it culminating in the outraged townspeople storming the mansion to kill GENUINE, only to end in her dropping dead for reasons I still can't figure out.

Dr. Caligari runs a side show attraction that features a somnambulist named Caesar. A somnambulist is a sleepwalker. Supposedly Caesar has been asleep for 23 years and only wakes up for the show. When Caesar awakes for the show he can answer anyone's question about anything. The scene gets real sketchy when Caesar predicts a murder a few hours before it happens. This prediction spawns a murder mystery that leads directly to the madhouse. This is a classic film that literary plunges into the depths of madness.

CALIGARI is an incredible visual experience that rose out of the Expressionist movement in post-World War I Germany. Drawing from the art movement of the same name, the set designs and backdrops are riddled with awkward, uneven lines that protrude at acute angles and in twisted forms. This creates an unnerving and nightmarish world in which the characters dwell. The artful framing and dissolves are shrouded in a dark fog that further enhances the dream like quality of the picture. Each of the actors create striking characters through their exaggerated performances, the most memorable of which has to be Conrad Veidt's ghastly portrayal of Cesare, the sinuous and frightening somnambulist. The brilliantly scripted reveal following Francis' framed story delivery of the plot introduces an unexpected twist in a chilling grand finale. THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI is regarded as one of the finest achievements in the genre, and currently ranks within the Top Ten Horror Films of all time on The Internet Movie Database.

752276,5,6303968163,"Since there are a lot of reviews on here of people are extremely familiar with this film, I figure I may as well write one since I only vaguely knew of this movie and was not expecting much, I love classic cinema and am surprised I had not heard of this until I got it as a recommendation for Instant Watch on Netflix, which is where I watched it so I cannot comment on extras or things of that nature, sorry.  :(  I wrote this review while watching it and after, it left a deep impression on me, and I can see how heavily it influenced everything after it, and for good reason, it is undoubtedly more than a great silent film, it IS a great film period!

The power of suggestion is an amazing thing, I have watched silent films before, but none so effective as ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"".  The tension is so thick and the atmosphere so foreboding, I don't think anyone could have prepared me for the creeping terror of this film.  The look on the Somnambulist when he first wakes up, with his eyes, that genuinely scared me in a way I don't think any other movie has, it felt like he was staring in to my soul.  Dr. Caligari himself is very frightening, and at one point when the police were passing by and they said they had found the murderer, I genuinely thought that I heard him cackling!

For all of our modern notions of what is truly creepy and scary we have completely blown off tension and true suspence and horror for endless body counts and gratuitious horror.  I can no longer watch such movies as they give me terrible nightmares, but movies like this, that are not so much horror as high tension are really the kind of horror I think most horror movie goers want, but lack the patience to really watch and enjoy a silent film or even earlier talkies.

In fact the very thing that makes this film so effective is the fact that it is silent and relies on your imagination, it does not rely on someone explaining everything, much is left to the imagination in terms of explanaintion, the rest is shown visually.  The expressions on the actors faces are wonderful, how well they express everything, it really reminded me how great silent movies can be, and just because a new technology is developed, it does not necessarily mean its better, just different.  In a way, the introduction of talkies really dumbed cinema down in a way, I am glad to have sound and I am not saying I want films to all be silent, no, rather it would just be wonderful to see movies that take great care with mood, tone, and tenstion.  Often times, people rely on script and such to set the tone rather than using the camera to tell the story.  There must be a balance between style and substance, and sometimes in an effort to ""capture"" the way a silent film could evoke mood when done well, people may eschew the a well-written script in favor of mood and neglect making us care about the characters (many film niiors are guilty of this, and I am a film noir fan.  ""Diobalique"", which I enjoy despite that though it defintiely leaves me feeling hollow, comes to mind as prime example of the style over substance in film noir), and although this movie does not have a lot of character background, it gives us just enough to make you care, and even despite is creepy sets and mood, it never left me feeling cold like most films that aspired to these hieghts after this film did.

So while this might not be a perfect movie (there is no such thing, its all in the eye of the beholder really), it does do some things more right then I have ever seen any other movie of this nature do:  the sets, the actors, the lighting, the make-up, the cinematography and music all work together to create a very chilling tale unlike anything I have ever seen (it was really the first of its kind in terms of a wide released movie),  this film is a complete masterpiece and deserves a patient veiwing.  Once you get past the ""Oh, this is a silent moive and I actually have to pay attention.""  You will not regret it, it is worth actually watching closely as the film relies so heavilty on visuals because it is a silent film.

I do genuinely wonder though, if the film would have been more or less affective with its original ending...  Who knows, only God I guess, but I wish they filmed both endings, I would have loved to see th original ending on film as well.  :)

Yet, with all this strength, the film isn't without its flaws. The brevity means quick segments, underdeveloped plot, and a twist that seems to come from left field. Watched within the availability of a group, there was decidedly a mixed feel about this film. Many enjoyed, and applauded, the German Expressionism used to create the world, as it has been eerily used time and time again in modern cinema (i.e. Tim Burton's ""Batman""), yet others seemed to mock the unknown. They followed the film throughout the course, confused as to when it was going to wrap up, and when it did - the ending seemed more rushed than surprising. While there were both applause and nays within the group, the one element that stood out - which demonstrates the cinematic power of ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"""" - is that they all wanted to see it again.

""Caligari"" introduces a new viewer to the world of German Expressionism, and the creativity doesn't stop there. With bold, ""Pee-Wee's Playhouse""-like doors, Burton-esque buildings, and a dream-like town, director Robert Wiene (along with his set designer and cinematographer) was well beyond the 1900s. Their vision proved that dark can be fun, that the unknown will still scare, and the mind, well, it is a terrible thing to waste. Imagine watching this film in 1920, when the cinema was still an infant. The sheer horror that audiences would have felt ooze from the screen, it is dark, it is disturbing, and - even with standards today - it is scary. Audiences beware, this is no ""Saw"" or ""Hostel"", but the creativity behind this feature is stronger than these modern ""classics"". The argument could even be presented that if it weren't for this film, the horror genre wouldn't exist today. ""Caligari"" is that impressive. For those that haven't seen, be prepared.

This film worked because of what our group was considerably mixed on, the unknown. For me, the uniqueness of the story allowed for depth and the macabre to soak through. Couple this with the visuals, and ""Caligari"" transforms into more than just pioneering cinema - it becomes a grandiose story that requires several viewings in darkened rooms. The cerebral nature keeps conversation flowing and that ""unknown"" that I have spoken of, strong. Yet, there is a fault with this film. While I praise the story, cinematography, and the twist; the development was a bit slow at times. Perhaps it is the fast-paced nature of today's movies, but the center of this film seemed to drag and push nowhere. The pacing begins strong, with an introduction into two stranded unknowns, but as the reveal occurs, one can find themselves dozing off - questioning the reason for one scene over the other (i.e. the entire wrong murder suspect). Yes, the value of those scenes do semi-make sense, but for a 70-ish minute long film, there were moments that were difficult to enjoy. Also, perhaps it is just this special edition, but the flash-card dialogue seemed a bit too uplifting for this film. Yes, they were easy to read, yes, the first couple were fun to see, but overall, the choice of these over your typical ones created a missing sense of dread. The dark elements seemed lighter, while the light elements seemed more positive than they should have been. If there were a fault with this film, it would be these small issues. I believe that the KINO edition perhaps does a stronger job with the flash-card issues.

Due to the brevity of this film, I don't want to sound repetitive with the elements that I loved vs. those that I could have done without, so - to wrap this review up - here are two breathtaking, and innovative, scenes from this film that will go down in cinematic infamy. The use of ""special effects"" to show the insanity of the word ""Caligari"" thus into a surprising transformation. Unique for its time, it also showed that this film not only was bold visually, but also technically. The second scene that was favored was when our suspected murder walks away with our quintessential damsel in distress.  The camera work, the artwork, the way the body looks real, but obviously isn't was planned precisely.  These are two strong scenes from an already great film.

VIDEO:  Watched via streaming, the quality and excitement was par to that of a DVD.  Lacking the exciting special features, this gave a small glimpse into a larger world.  Eagerly I look forward to the KINO edition of this film with it's ""restored authorized edition"".

VISUAL:  Watching this was like watching a projector film, it was too dark in some places, not light enough in others.  Yet, that is what worked.  This film survives on its twisted images and haunting characters, and both come across clear as bells.  Watching this film, one cannot laugh at the work created by Hollywood today, completely borrowing that of this film.

SOUND:  This is where it gets tricky.  Watching only one version from the streaming source, I wasn't able to fully recognize the music, that is where an actual DVD will come in handy.  I plan on updating this segment as I watch from either KINO or IMAGE to see which provides the better, stronger score.  Needless to say, I wasn't unimpressed with the music here - it added to the already freaky ambiance of the film.

EXTRAS:  Lacking, but not by fault.  Once I acquire the DVD version, I will update this.  Streaming had no special features to add to the surrounding history of this film.

Overall, despite my minor setbacks when watching this, I loved ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"".  The visuals (again) were stunning, the story was breathtaking, and the originality of everyone involved far surpasses that of which is released today.  The closest I could come to would be Terry Gilliam, old Tim Burton, or Fritz Lang (who was originally asked to direct this film).  I suggest this to everyone, horror fanatics or not - this is just a great film and a strong piece of cinematic history.

752279,4,6303968163,"One of the first silent films I ever saw (and still a personal favorite) this film proved to me that silents can have as much visual presence and atmosphere as more recent films.  I've been a big fan of German expressionism ever since.  The odd angular sets and liberal use of shadows create a world that correspondingly odd characters live in: a killer Somnambulist, a madman of the fairgrounds, not to mention the inhabitants of an insane asylum.  The plot is by no means straightforward.  The players have such skewed psyches, a fact which only becomes more obvious during the progression of the film.  It's also important to note that the horror element has not been lost with age.  The ever creepy somnambulist (played to chilling effect by Conrad Veidt) admittedly unnerved me upon initial viewing.

My only criticism is the rather confusing ending which results from a jarring change of tone.  In the interest of keeping this review spoiler free, I will not divulge any more.",1266105600,,982,4.838323353293413

752281,5,6303968163,"One of the first horror films in history, although not the very first (1896's two-minute silent film ""La Manoir Du Diablo"" and 1910's absolute original ""Frankenstein"" both beat this movie), ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" is, to say the least, a landmark film in horror movies. Being that I watched it through the eyes of a younger horror fan, I noticed some interesting aspects. For one thing, this movie is way ahead of its time. The scenery and the use of it, something that I'll get to in a minute, is something that's rarely touched upon even nowadays, well over 80 years after the movie was made.

The scenery is really what makes this movie such a masterpiece and a film far beyond its contemporary time-frame. The settings in this movie make it like a film version of a Salvador Dali painting. All the buildings seem crooked and surreal, and the fact that whatever appears onscreen is surrounded by black even gives it the appearance of the classic ""dream bubble"" sort of imagery. The entire movie has a very dreamlike, actually more like nightmarish, quality to it, that takes you to another place and is, even today, unlike many many other horror films.

Another thing I find great about this movie is the acting. Silent films are usually considered movies where overacting is almost a given. However, I really didn't think there were any moments here where the acting was way too over the top. For a silent film, the acting was quite good, and the dialogue (for a silent film, which would be the words that appear on screen to read, of course) is quite poetic at times.

Bringing this review to a smooth ending, I'm glad that I was able to rewind far back in cinema time to an early and landmark horror film. Avid horror fans will hopefully be able to appreciate ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"", with is both simplistic and extravagant at the same time. Although I haven't seen too many silent films, I definitely think this is a great one, and is recommended for horror fans, especially those that want to watch a piece of horror history! Thanks for the time, and peace.",1256256000,,2078,4.626016260162602
752282,5,6303968163,"The DVD that I watched is the Kino version.  I must say that I found the intensity of the blue highlights around the figures in the very first scene in the garden very exaggerated, but did not dislike it, rather I thought it was painterly way of representing the scene. I read in the reviews here that this is a distortion that does NOT appear in the Image version of the film, so I will make a point of getting that one for comparison purposes.

The musical score feature offers two choices. Go for the traditional, the modern version does not work as well and eventually becomes very annoying.

The film is an excellent example of how the artistic currents and tendencies of the time were affecting film and each media was influencing the other. The images in the movie most certainly reminded me of paintings that I have admired by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, particularly 4 paintings that show urban landscapes and figures, all done before the movie when the artist lived in Berlin: Nollendorfplatz, 1912 Berlin Street Scene, 1913  Potsdamer Platz, 1914  Brandenburger Tor, 1915  also the angularity of the architecture reminded me of the style of Franz Marc and August Macke's workks, both of them were great Expressionist painters that died very young and are even less well known than Kirchner. All of them portrayed the anxiety,dehumanization, and sheer horror that 'modern' life was providing for the regular urban dweller of those difficult  times in Germany, but that eventually became emblematic of the phenomenon worldwide. There is a famous coloured woodcut by another Expressionsit artist, Erich Heckel, Portrait of a Man, from 1919 that is the very face of Cesare, (played by Conrad Veit) the character that plays the murderous somnambulist in the film, it is tempting to think that the could have been the model. The makeup worn by Lil Dagover who plays Jane is very similar to the women portrayed by expressionistic artist Karl Schmidt-Rottluff.

Also do note that the shadow projected on to the wall as Cesare approaches, then murders his first victim, is a device that we are going to see again, with similar horrific implications in ""Nosferatu"" just two years later.
The device of using a story within a story, whereby at the very end we are led to believe that the whole thing has been an invention of Francis' deranged mind as we see that he, along with Jane and Cesare are patients of Caligari at a real-life assylum is straight from Kafka in sensibility.

This is a must see movie for all interested in the German Expressionist movement, but also for horror/thriller fans, as this movieis the parent of the genre. Aside from the historical or artistic merits, it is still a very interesting, fascinating movie and not at all a museum relic. We get drawn into the weird, fantastical and claustrophobic world of Dr. Caligari and can not wait for the next scene to advance the plot. It benefits immensely from the absence of dialogue, as the intensity of the characters, and the effectiveness of the decor are more than well suited to convey all the significance we need. It truly is a perfect example of why silent movies are still important and relevant as independent works of art .

One of the extra features is a 'condensed' 43 minute long version of  ""Genuine the tale of a Vampire"", which I also enjoyed watching. It has similar sets and backdrops to Caligari. The plot revolves around a femme fatale (played by Fern Andra to the hilt and 'edge' of what was then known as vampism) called Genuine who is not a vampire as the title may suggest, but actually  had been the high priestess of some cult.

She ends up in a slave market featuring surprising revealing nudity, and is eventually bought by an eccentric old man who is prone to  doze off while being shaved daily, and who keeps the girl as a decorative souvenir in his mansion, as one can not possibly imagine his senility could be aroused to more action than admiring looks of worship. Whether the priestess arrived from a past life or the 'exotic' Middle East of 19th Century literature, is not clear.

The first time we see Genuine she steps-off a portrait in the sitting-room, wearing an outrageous costume more pertaining to Hollywood High Drama than any epoch of antiquity, while gesturing an walking in an uncannily similar way to  Gloria Swanson descending the staricase in the very last scene of ""Sunset Boulevard"" where she believes she is Salom in a De Mile epic. As an added feasture to the convoluted plot, the elderly gentleman has an Afro- Arabian servant, with painted bare chest, which looks like an unemployed extra from Diaghelev's Ballet Russe.

The barber and another young man, a nephew? of the elder gentleman, are somehow driven mad with sudden-first-sight catastrophic passion for this creature. She appears with each one in such fantastical, bizarre costumes one would assume they both had a fetish for circus performers, while we also understand why some birds surely went extinct at this time with such lavish use of feathers. The barber cuts the older man's throat because she suggests it as a sacrifice to their love and then wants him to commit suicide as another proof of love... the details aren't very clear - particularly with respect to the old man's nephew or her relationship to the servant, that can be controlled with a 'magical' ring. At some point one of them rouses the populace against her in a frenzy by calling her a witch. They rush in a fury and attack and trample the Nubian at the doorstep of the mansion,  and in a scene which basically duplicates Cesare's fate from Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, she dies in the ensuing fracas after what looks like a short interpretative dance sequence.

I would have preferred a burning at the stake myself as a happier ending. However the movie would probably make more sense in the full version. The costume changes that Genuine undergoes for every single scene are worth every second of watching this oddity. Ms. Andra gave camp lovers (and drag queens)  a solid and fertile basis for future developments with her showmanship, and at some moments in her performance she very much reminded me of the late Charles Busch in his Ridiculous Theater's production and interpretation of  Gustave Flaubert's ""Salamb"", where he played the priestess to perfection in one of the most enchanting and absolute comical masterpieces of Contemporary theater that I was lucky enough to have seen, and remember always for its artistic and hilarious brilliance.",1248307200,5,6506,4.827493261455525
752283,4,6303968163,"The Expressionist sets in this movie really surprised me. Their off-kilter angles and surreal geometries create a suitably dream-like environment for the somnambulist nightmare to take place in. Those wild shapes certainly set the stage appropriately for this unusual movie, but figuratively set the stage for many later innovations in scenery design, as well. The ending, too, has an ambiguity that I didn't expect.

The version of Caligari that I saw wasn't the best restored. That, however, worked to my advantage this time. Between uncertain contrast in places and varying light levels, I suddenly realized why actors in the silent classics tended toward stark styles of makeup - it helped keep their facial expressions legible despite the erratic photography of the time.

Too many of its descendants have done too much more with movie-making for me to appreciate Caligari as its original audiences did, ninety years ago. In fact, many later movies surpassed Caligari by learning from it. Instead, I watched this as an historical artifact, the originator of ideas that have been developed since. That I found very enjoyable, and I'm grateful that this remarkable movie has survived to the current day.

752366,5,6303968163,"This is an eerie movie which tells the story of doctor and his charge...a somnambulist named Cesare who mostly sleeps but sometimes wakes up to tell scary fortunes (like you're going to die tomorrow) or kill people.  Cesare is of course played by the immortal Conrad Veidt (who not only basically was the star of silent Weimar cinema but also later went on to become Casablanca's Major Strasser) with Veidt's usual supreme skill.

Though I think Cesare ranks much lower on the scare-o-meter than say his contemporary Nosferatu, he's nonetheless significant for having helped inaugurate an era when movies could be REALLY scary.  By that I reference that great golden era of frightening silent film classics of 1919 to 1931 which includes numerous classics...Nosferatu (which I already mentioned), Waxworks (which features Veidt in one of its three stories), The Hands of Orlac (which also stars Veidt), Student of Prague (again featuring Veidt), Der Mud Tod (the first BIG Fritz Lang movie, co written by his then wife Thea von Harbou), and of course any other Weimar movie you will no doubt accuse me of forgetting in the comments section.

Though there are those who feel confident that the doctor and Cesare were reality (along with their bad deeds), part of the weirdness of this movie for me came from the idea that maybe the dividing line between reality and nightmare wasn't so strong. And maybe it doesn't have to be either because even though we know we've just woken up from a nightmare, it's still a scary experience...like this movie...because of the inherent terror that exists even in frightening possibilities.

Maybe Weimar producers -- creating their horror right on the eve of Hitler's Nazi Germany -- were unique in the power of their horror because of their ""privileged"" position as all too soon to be witnesses of it.

The characters, the enigmatic Dr. Caligari and his sinister somnambulist Cesare, are both creatures of dark corners of the imagination, and could happily hold court with Count Dracula, The Phantom of the Opera and other famous monsters of filmland.

752369,3,6303968163,"I'd like to add my two cent's worth here.  Not going in to the film itself, I just want to discuss the 2 main versions out there, the Image ""Special Collector's Edition"" disc from about 10 years ago and the new Kino ""Restored Authorized Edition"".  I watched both side to side (2 TVs & 2 DVD players)

Despite some raves about the Kino version (which I can't really understand), the Image version wins hands down.  Kino, which normally puts out a superior product whatever movie they are releasing, I believe really dropped the ball with this one.  For one, they went totally overboard with tinting...most scenes now appear to be a deep, dark blue, and the black areas have a weird, mottled, speckley, ""wavy"" look, like TV reception that isn't quite coming in.  Granted, this is mostly only really bad during the first reel, in the opening garden scene, improving slightly as the film goes on, but it's still annoying.

The Image disc, by comparision, is brightly lit, scenes being either a ""regular"" grey like you see on the usual b/w silent film, or an amberish tint that still shows up fine.  The entire Kino version just seems too dark & murky.  The intertitles of both are in that funky, abstract font, but each has slightly different wording for the same scenes (and I don't know which is actually more accurate to the original, but both convey basically the same information).  For example, one may say ""Listen while I tell you a story"" while the other says ""I will now tell you a story"" (I made both those up, but it was to get the idea across!).  However, the intertitles on the Kino version are, again, much darker than the Image disc.  Also, the Image print in general just seems much sharper & clearer than the Kino, and the musical score is much better & more fitting.  Kino gives you a choice of 2 musical scorings & both are atrocious and do not seem to fit the ""mood"" of the story.

On the other hand, Kino does have more extras, particularly a much longer segment of GENUINE: THE TALE OF A VAMPIRE (43 minutes) while Image gives you about a 3-minute snippet.  Also, and most important, that annoying horizontal line that cuts across the top of certain scenes on nearly every version out there (including the one shown on TCM) has been removed on the Kino disc.  Long considered to be a flaw in the original film, it's most likely a goof in the converting process somewhere, and this shows that we DO have the technology to remove it, which we did not have back when the Image disc was made.  Quite frankly, this was the ONLY main advantage I could find in the Kino print, and it does not make up for a blue, murky, dark movie.  I'd much rather have a clean, crisp, clear, brightly lit film & deal with the line (it's not in every scene in the movie, just certain ones anyway).

I guess the best of both worlds would be if Image put out a new version, using it's same print but removing the line as Kino did.  THAT would really be the ""Ultimate Edition"" in my opinion.",1204243200,52,2983,4.458563535911602

Just to be sure, I put in the Alpha Video release, and then the Kino release again, comparing them shot-by-shot.

There is absolutely no doubt that the Alpha Video version is MUCH clearer.  While it lacks the original color tinting that the Kino version offers, there are no blurs, dark spots, or contrast issues when viewing the Alpha version.  The picture is entirely clear.

The Kino release seems to sacrifice everything else for the sake of providing a cut that contains the original color tinting, but the picture is far worse.  Additionally, the Kino release contains just as many jumps and scratches as (if not more than) The Alpha Video release.  And, while the Alpha soundtrack doesn't always match the action of the film, the modernized brass ensemble soundtrack on the Kino restoration just feels wholly inappropriate.

752440,5,6303968163,"Dr. Caligari presents the viewer with a frightening vision of the world through the lens of German Expressionism.

I cannot recommend this film highly enough. It's truly fascinating. And, it really (really) is an art film, since it purposefully and strikingly exhibits the new art of the German inter-war milieu. So, be prepared for an other-worldly excursion into the ""total work of art,"" or Gesamtkunstwerk, of this monumental and influential film.

This film is best seen at night, alone, and with the modern soundtrack which is available on the fully restored version. If the DVD you're watching does not have (a) choice of two soundtracks (traditional music and much-scarier modern track), (b) tinted inter-titles set in a surrealistic (actually expressionistic) font, and (3) is fairly high quality, then send it back and get the restored version. The quality and completeness of silent films are a major factor in experiencing the art form as it was meant to be experienced. The modern sound track in Dr. Caligari makes the film much more accessible for modern audiences (the eerie effects in the modern track heighten the feel of the film for the modern viewer) - try both tracks, you'll see.

It's surprising how frightening and impactful this film can be. You will have dreams about it, I promise. These between-the-wars German films are riddled with creepy foreshadowing for us in the present, who know what was about to happen in Germany.

Anyway, I think the film is best viewed with NO NOTICE. You don't really want to know the plot (the meaning of the end of the film can be interpreted in radically different ways - keep that in mind when it happens). Only one note - artistically the German Expressionist movement is worth reading about after you see the film - you'll notice the theme of ""death and the maiden"" woven into this artwork. Also, this film is the direct ancestor of films like ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" and a lot more - you'll recognize the Expressionist look in many presentations in television and film.

WARNING - I would NOT show this film to children. It's very subtly and psychologically undermining - you'll be thinking and freaking about this thing for months to come - such a thing shouldn't be experienced by children - it's an adult, art film (no, not that kind) made for adults.",1183248000,5,2323,4.885786802030457
752441,5,6303968163,"One of the finest achievements of the silent era and in some ways an allegory of Weimar Germany's decadent demise, Wiene's ""Caligari"" is an eerie, heavily stylized horror film. With its distorted angles, chiaroscuro lighting, and jarring German expressionist sets, the film is a striking precursor not only to Lang's ""Metropolis,"" but to the look and atmospheric feel of 1940s American noir. And its tale of a crazed doctor and his zombie-like proxy introduced a basic template for many later horror features. Still creepy and lurid after eighty-five years, ""Caligari"" will cast a spell on you.",1182297600,,594,5.197916666666667

Show, don't tell. That said, I must respond to the Amazon reviewer's off-handed condemnation of the film as a museum piece. On the contrary! It'll make you shudder, if anything can. Artistic interest aside, one really should remember that at the moment of ""Caligari""'s conception cinema Expressionism was in its infancy. It practically began with this. The movie was, at the time, a bold attempt at creating something new AND that new thing was meant to be a horror film. ""Caligari"" was meant to terrify with visuals and atmosphere. More than some ""statement,"" it remains a little world unto itself, hinting at something horrid, short, venal, coherent of purpose. Let's be creeped out and not miss the forest for the trees.",1174780800,9,892,4.836601307189542
752443,5,6303968163,"Not many films can classified as both artistically seminal and an expression of a national (or societal) self, but this particular movie is just that. Not only is Caligari the first really great horror movie, it is also one of the first to make its horrific point clearly and logically. In this way it is the precursor of all horror films since-- or should I say all good horror films. Moreover the mise-en-scene is so radically conceived and consistently followed through that there is not a moment in it that does not repay close study. Glib comments about German Expression do this film no harm, but they don't get anywhere near the finely wrought complexity of the characters and their circumstances. The film is dated 1920, the very beginning of the Weimar Republic and furious outburst of artistic activity that occurred during that troubled 12-13 year period which ended with the take-over of Hitler and his NADSP. Caligari is an expression of Expressionism all right, but it is also a declaration of who and what Weimar was to be. In other words this movie is as much a political statement of artistic and intellectual freedom as it is a simple horror flick. See this film and enjoy it: that's the first requisite of any artistic work. But don't see it once. See it many times. Have fun with it: try to find a right angle for instance. In the end, you will come to the conclusion that not one frame is carelessly placed, not one character miscast, and not one moment of sheer horror is left to stand on its own. This is great filmaking. It is also a great expression of freedom. No film of this sort could have been made anywhere other than Germany at this moment; it is a unique expression of an optimism that died with the Nazis.",1169510400,5,1739,4.576923076923077
752444,5,6303968163,"I've seen this movie from time to time since about 1970, but, with Image Entertainment's DVD, I feel like I'm seeing it for the first time -- it's that good!

The picture on my public domain DVD (which I just threw out) basically looked like a few light areas (faces, lamps, etc.) surrounded by large black areas with no details - actually, I should say large dark gray areas with no details. It was often hard to see where the characters were and what they were doing.

The picture on Image's DVD has a much-closer-to-normal gray scale and shows much finer detail. You can see things in the shadows. The gray scale still isn't quite up to modern standards, but I'm sure that's not Image's fault. You're watching an 85-year-old movie. They used the best print they could find, and it's a vast improvement over anything else I've seen.

There's a string quartet score which works very well with the movie. If you didn't know better, you'd think it was the original score.

They recreated the expressionist style of the original intertitles, and even added some ""digi-dirt"" to make them better match the rest of the film. The translation doesn't use obscure words like ""mountebank"" and ""fakir,"" like my public domain copy did. (Yes, of course you can look them up, but who wants to run to the dictionary while they're watching a movie?)

Plus, it has been tinted to match the original. That helps this movie a lot, because with its odd sets, it's often hard to tell if a scene is set indoors or out, or if it's day or night.

As picky as I am, I didn't find the frame line to be too distracting! It's not in that many scenes. I'm glad they allowed us to see the whole picture, rather than cropping the shots.

I haven't seen Kino's version, so I can't compare the two, but I can recommend this version without reservations.",1161475200,20,1821,4.533536585365853

What I think could be far more useful (as this is an area where I have been burned) is some comparison between the two DVD editions I know of.

I have copies of both the Kino Video edition and the Image Entertainment edition.  My preference is for Image Entertainment for the following reasons:

(1) The print seems slightly cleaner (and most helpfully, the DVD packaging warns you about the horizontal line across the top of some scenes which is a defect on the original film)

(2) The intertitles on Image use the correct expressionistic style as per the 1920 release.  from what I recall, Kino's are the 'normalised' printed intertitles from 1923.

(3) The Kino version has possibly the most insensitive layer transition location I have ever come across.  For reasons of their own Kino put an intertitle before the final sequence in the asylum, and it would have been a natural place for a layer transition.  Instead they put it a few seconds into the final sequence (and only a couple of minutes before the end of the film!).  Image has no layer transition.

(4) Both scores on the Kino version are dreadful.  One consists of strange electronic noises, while the 'orchestral' one is pretty inappropriate.  Instead Image chose a very nice specially composed score by Timothy Brock which is a remarkably effective pastiche in the style of Alban Berg (very appropriate for an expressionist film).

(5) Image has a commentary track; it's not clear that Kino does (I can't remember, but certainly it isn't mentioned in the blurb on the back).

Just about the only plus of Kino is that there is considerably more bonus material (43 minutes from 'Genuine: the tale of a vampire' as compared to about 3 on Image).  However, if the price for that is the awful layer transition, then I know which I prefer.

So that's why I prefer the Image version and wish I hadn't bought the Kino version.",1137024000,231,2032,4.67887323943662
752530,5,6303968163,"This film, as is understood by anybody who takes even a second to research it, is basically the height of German Expressionism.  It is the base of the psyche, an insanity so removed one begins to wonder if the movie is about insanity or if the makers were just insane.

A man tells his friend about the story of Dr. Caligari, a demented stranger who enters his town during a carnival with a somnambulist who can divinate the future.  The story traces a murder mystery that treads down contemporarily familiar paths, but the sheer audacity of the sets, costuming, music, and acting makes every moment unpredictable and confusing.

The only problem with this German silent great is that a few of the absolutely astounding sets are obviously stages.  Otherwise this movie is perfect.

And creepy.  Boy is it creepy.  The characters don't even look real in their shapes and contortions sometimes, more like ventriloquist dummies or marionettes, though who would ever make such marionettes would probably need to be hospitalized.  The music itself is so creepy it could honestly stand alone without the image and some wouldn't even tell the difference.  Actually, it's mostly through the music that we're able to even comprehend what's going on, such is the twisted reality of the world we see.

This movie is right on the edge, and it seems any more added to it would have made it topple over.  It's its own fine line between the abyss and security.  A must for fans of the absyrd.

752531,4,6303968163,"""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" (1919), directed by Robert Wiene, is one of the best examples of German Expressionism. This film has the distinctive mise-en-scne of that movement, with a scenography characterized by geometrical lines and sharp angles that along with a good use of light and darkness give the spectator the feeling of being immersed in a nightmare. Even though this is a silent movie, the viewer is never bored, but rather feels like part of what is happening, due to the fact that the story isn't slow, and also because the music helps to build the tension in the different scenes.

The story is told from the point of view of a young man who saw his life almost destroyed by the main character, Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss). Caligari visited his town and brought death with him, in the form of a somnambulist who predicted the future , Cesare (Conrad Veidt). Dr. Caligari was intent on studying the effects of somnambulism, because he wanted to know how far a sleepwalker would go if persuaded to do some things that would be contrary to his nature while awake, for example murdering someone. Of course, the whole thing was nothing else than a experiment for Caligari, a mad doctor that would have done anything in his pursuit of knowledge.

All in all, I think that this is a fairly entertaining film. It is short, but has an interesting plot and a twist at the end that you will never guess. ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" isn't likely to be similar to other films you have previously seen, and even if you are familiar with German Expressionism, I sincerely believe you will enjoy it.

 CABINET demands a bit of adjustment from its 21st century audience.  We don't make silent movies much anymore, nor do we wrap Conrad Veidt in leotards and black eye makeup, tell him to creep about the sets like Baryshnikov, call him the Sonambulist and hail him as the first horror creature in cinematic history (or one of the first, anyway).  We don't dress our sets in wild and weird angles, have characters walk through rhomboid doors and peer through windows that seem to have started as square before lying on their sides and taking a nap.  If time has robbed CABINET of its ability to horrify, it has fully retained its ability to creep out.  The cumulative effect of watching this movie is a definite feeling of unease, of a sane world violated and displaced.

Beyond its place in cinematic history (it sits at the first table) and artistic merit, CABINET remains an eminently watchable movie.  Of course it's silent, the sets are outrageous and the acting is highly stylized, but it all works to a rewarding end.  I watched this one twice in the span of three days - once without and the next time with the commentary track, and I will probably put it into the rotation of movies that I watch again simply for the pleasure of it.

752533,5,6303968163,"World War One sent a shockwave through the arts and one of the results was expressionism.  The term is difficult to define; in a general sense, however, it refers to a type of art that makes a statement about internal emotion and psychology.  Often linked to surrealism and cubism, in the 1920s expressionism became one of the dominate styles in visual and performing arts and was particularly associated with Germany.

The 1919 THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI is perhaps the only film made in a purely expressionist style.  As directed by Robert Wiene and designed by Herman Warm, Walter Reimann, and Walter Rohrig, everything about the film is exaggerated, off-center, and disorienting. The sets are strange, deliberately artificial constructions of flat surfaces in odd angles and broad strokes of paint; the make-up and costumes are equally exaggerated.  The result is a unique look that has the paranoid essence of nightmare, and the story links with the visuals to remarkable effect.

A carnival has come to a small German town, and among its attractions is Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss) and ""sonambulist"" Cesare (Conrad Veidt).  When awakened from his sleep, Cesarea makes predictions of the future--predictions of death!  And through his power over the sleepwalker, Caligari ensures that the predictions come true.  It is frequently described as the first true horror film.  But while the story was shocking by 1919 standards, it was really the visual style of the film that outraged critics and the public alike; many described it as ""degenerate,"" and it proved extremely controversial where ever shown.

It also proved incredibly influential--so much so that it is virtually impossible for any one serious about film as art to avoid it.  But there are quite a few releases that you should avoid: the film is in public domain, and the result has been a series of DVD and VHS ""budget"" releases that are dire to the nth degree.  It is a matter of getting what you pay for, and while the KINO release is the most expensive print available, it is also the only one worth having.  The picture quality is as good as it can be short of digital restoration and the film has been restored to its original tints as well.

The KINO release offers a choice of soundtracks, a 43 minute version of director Robert Wiene's GENUINE: THE TALE OF A VAMPIRE, and archival footage of Wiene on the set of I.N.R.I.  While these are interesting, it is a pity that KINO did delve a little deeper; this is a film truly worthy of a double disk treatment crammed to overflowing with additional information.  But the film itself is the important thing, and where that is concerned you have the best possible.  Strongly recommended.

Invest in the more expensive version if you want to purchase this; the cheap ones are murky and somewhat trying to watch.

752538,2,6303968163,"Before beginning to write this review I read a couple of the previous reviews, and one person said something that summed up my thoughts quite well. You Tim Burton fans will see stuff here that was obviously a large influence on him. Specifically, the sets. You can imagine movie-goers of that era feeling as if they were seeing an alternate world as they watched this movie.

I think my thoughts on this movie will differ from those of most of the reviewers, though. I think the sets and the look of the characters are the most interesting things about this movie. Is it actually from 1921, though? On the VHS I have, it says ""released in 1919"" right on the box. Beyond that, the camerawork and production values seem to be quite a bit less than the those of many other films from the early '20s.

This movie has its moments, but if you really want to see a movie from the early '20s that is psychotic and strange even by many of today's standards, try Haxan, from 1922. For those of you who think Dr. Caligari or the flying monkeys scene from Wizard of Oz are creepy or scary, you will be utterly horrified by Haxan. Haxan is a movie that couldn't have been made by American studios until probably the late '60s... and lots of people still would have been outraged even then, I'm sure.

Haxan has better cinematography and production values, and every aspect of it is more twisted and evil than anything in Caligari. Plus the acting is alot better. Caligari is worthy as an historical artifact and for its influence, but Haxan is better in every single way. There are things in Caligari that are laughably bad or just boring. Haxan is a twisted masterpiece of evil and perversion, and worthy of many more viewings.

Having said this, if you are really into Dr. Caligari, Mark Dresser (incredible bassist, improvisor, composer) released a music cd of the same name. His The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is available on this website in the music section.",1097280000,6,1948,4.573065902578796
752637,4,6303968163,"""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" remains possibly the most watchable of the silent films, even to those who are not silent film aficionados.  Werner Krauss's use of a landscape of obtuse angles and hand-painted shadows creates a dream-like/nightmare-like reality that is heightened by the distance and the crackling of the ancient cameras.  The characters, the enigmatic Dr. Caligari and his sinister somnambulist Cesare, are both creatures of dark corners of the imagination, and could happily hold court with Count Dracula, The Phantom of the Opera and other famous monsters of filmland.

The storyline is equally gripping, with plot twists and turns to rival any modern film.  The innate fear of the carnival is played for all of its creepy value, as the strangers who inhabit this strange world must by their very nature carry some dark secret.  It truly is a masterpiece of any age.

The downfall of ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" is its presentation.  As equally deserving of restoration and a ""special edition"" format as ""Nosferatu"" and ""Metropolis,"" there has yet to be a definitive version of this classic film.  Also dampening its effect is the soundtrack.  On the version I have, there is a sort of light jazz piano playing in the background.  If composer Philip Glass would work his magic on Caligari, the way he did on Tod Browning's ""Dracula,"" then this would be a powerhouse of a film.

Kino International is releasing a new DVD of ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.""

The world evidently was in another mood , but this warning call from a bizarre film concerned to a few people. Today we are capable after eighty five years , of feel the message.
Robert Wiene established a real pattern around the new possibilities of expression for the movies. He made The hands of Orlac also with Conrad Viet a legendary actor , and won too with that.

And what an incredible movie. One of my favourite silents so far! An eye-opening experience. If you haven't seen much silent cinema, you'll be shocked at how involving a silent can be. Caligari takes you to another place. The world of Caligari has a feel all its own, where houses are wonky, doorways triangular, people ghoulish, and everything like something out of a nightmare. One of the best pieces of what they call german expressionism. See it!",1079654400,2,829,4.845070422535211
752642,5,6303968163,"I don't know why this film is criticised for its storyline. Maybe it is because of the persistent (but only possibly true) rumours that the ""twist"" at the end is the result of political pressures; or that it is a cop-out.
I think ""The Cabine t of Doctor Caligari"" has been underrated. The plot of the film is no less amazing than the distorted sets for which it is famous. No matter where the final twist came from, it somehow fits perfectly into the fabric of the film, making it a journey into the ultimate ""cabine t"", the mind of a madman.
This disc (which is the same as the Force Videos/Eureka disc available in Australia"" is definitely worth the money. Reviewers who criticise this disc are often ignorant of the condition of the negative for this film. Yes, there is ""supposed"" to be a black line across the top of the screen; it was on the original negative (thank the original German company which screwed up when trying to find out where the top of the frame should end). Yes, there was tinting on the original film (most silent films had tinting; this restoration of the print is based on a tinted negative).
There is, in fact, much to recommend about this restoration. The image, for a film that is eighty-five years old, is magnificent. The frame rate (a perilously low 16 frames per second) has been maintained; which, given my recent irritation with Abel Gance's ""Napoleon"", is a real bonus.
The soundtrack, by a certain Mr Brock, is about the best soundtrack for a silent film that I have heard. The string music in the expressionist-serialist style of Schoeberg and other composers of the period, drips with suitably expressionistic atmosphere.
The alternative sountrack is a pretty good (though often dry) commentary by a film scholar. It is very interesting to hear his comments; such as, for instance, recent evidence casting doubt on the original oft-told story about why there is a twist at the end.
On the extras there are some (startlingly modern) original advertising posters from America in 1920-1. Film advertising hasn't changed much - these posters, with some modifications, could have been used to promote ""Crouching Tiger"", for instance.
There are also photos of the original cinema where the film had its premiere - again, startlingly modern; I didn't know cinemas back then could be so plush.
If I had anything bad to say about this disc, it would be that the intertitles, even though they are based on the original intertitles in German, are almost unbearably ugly. That, and the fact that the cover art in the Australian release is also unbearably ugly, with a typesetting error on the back...
I heartily recommend this disc for anyone with even a passing interest in silent film or expressionism.",1077062400,5,2732,4.790254237288136
752643,4,6303968163,"When we talk about the history of the ""movies"" it is ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" (""Das Kabinett des Doktor Caligari"") that has almost always represented the first prime example of the ""cinema,"" where we treat films as art. This is the best example of German Expressionism with angular sets and exaggerated performances by the actors that represented the dementia of the title character. Werner Krauss is the mad doctor, who uses his somnambulist Ceasar (Conrad Veidt) from his carnival sideshow to do his evil deeds, with Lil Dagover is the damsel in distress.  The film is framed by a rather clever plot device that turns the narrative upside down in the end, as a young man (Friedrich Feher) tells the story of Dr. Caligari's visit to the small German town of Holstenwall to an older one, as they sit together on a park bench.  There is also a strong sense of how the film serves as a metaphor for the destruction of post-war Germany.
Whatever the films shortcomings, the classic status of this 1919 film directed by Robert Wiene is assured by the striking art direction. The abstract, expressionists designs provide severely angled corners, crooked lines, and objects highlighted by decorative stripes.  If ""Then Battleship Potemkin"" opens us up as students of cinema to the possibilities about montage, then ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" does the same for mise-en-scene.  The film also establishes many of the conventions of the horror film (e.g., the mad scientist, beauty and the beast), although, surprisingly enough, the basic storyline has never been remade.",1076112000,,1569,5.023076923076923
752644,3,6303968163,"Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari (Robert Weine, 1920)
It has occurred to me many times over the years since I read my first book about monster movies how Germany dominated world cinema before World War II, and how that's changed since. Depressing. The Germans could do almost as good a job as the Japanese at expressing postwar angst, one thinks. One wonders why the Japanese have a whole industry of extreme horror and the Germans have, well, Jorg Buttgereit.
The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is widely considered the world's first horror film. It really isn't (both Fritz Lang and Robert Weine were both making horror movies for years before Caligari came out, along with Lang's stable of directors who did the films his fevered brain turned out he didn't have time to direct), but it may be the first still widely available. It's also a masterpiece of expressionist cinema, and really should be seen by all serious students of film.
The story centers around Francis (Friedrich Fehler, who spent much more time behind the camera than before it), who relates the story of his odd past few days to a man he meets while out on a walk. He, his best friend Alan (Hans Heinrich von Twardowski, who made a slew of anti-Hitler films during World War II after leaving Weine's stable), and the woman they both love, Jane (Lil Dagover, one of Germany's most celebrated actresses right up to her 1980 death), encountered an odd sideshow at the town fair. Run by one Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss), it's an exhibition of a somnambulist named Cesare (Conrad Veidt, best known for Casablanca) who has supposedly been asleep for a quarter century, and now can be awakened for short periods by Caligari. The day the fair comes to town, a series of murders begins, and Francis becomes convinced that Caligari is using Cesaire to commit the murders. The truth, however, is far more complex...
Modern viewers who aren't used to silent film will probably be bored, or at least annoyed; depending on which version you get, the background music can be horribly inappropriate for the material, and let's face it, a lot of moviegoers today don't have the patience for subtitles, much less the cards used for dialogue in the silent days. (One longs for someone to do an ambient/gothic soundtrack for this film, as has been done for Metropolis, Nosferatu, and earlier versions of The Phantom of the Opera.) Also, in the silent film days, and especially in expressionist film, facial expressions and gestures are always exaggerated. Caveat viewer, as it were. Those who have gotten used to such things, however (repeated screenings of Shadow of the Vampire should at least give you the idea), will find much to enjoy here.
The main thing to point out is the set design. A thousand-word review cannot even begin to say enough good things about the wonderful sets put together by Herrmann Warm and his colleagues from Die Sturm. Everything in this movie, from the windows to the trees, is completely off-kilter. It's a cubist's worst nightmare; there's not a single right angle to be found anywhere on the set (except, arguably, in Conrad Veidt's lower jaw). The acting gives enough that Weine cold keep the between-scene cards to a minimum and the average Joe can still figure out what's going on, so the film's sixty-seven minutes are far more action than words. Weine weaves together subplot after subplot, and while he could be charged with initiating the idea that love triangles cannot end well in film, it works in the context here.
Yes, there is a great deal to like about The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. It's not as chilling as Nosferatu, but it's certainly capable of grabbing hold and not letting go. *** ",1072051200,7,3674,4.804107424960505
752645,5,6303968163,"Filmed way back in 1921, ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" is perhaps one of the oldest horror films ever made. As a viewer, I see this film as a macabre, magnificent work of art. It was probably intended to be that way, since director Robert Wiene was heavily inspired by the German Expressionist movement. With its skewed and handpainted scenery, crooked angles, looming shadows, and ghostly aura, this feature film is an Edvard Munch painting brought to life. More importantly, its simple yet terrifying plotline helped give birth to early cinematic horror, which would forever place Lon Chaney, Bela Legosi, and Boris Karloff on pedestals.
Here is the synopsis: A young man named Francis (Friedrich Feher) plays the narrator, opening his story at a carnival sideshow that opened in the town of Holstenwall. Francis and his best friend Alan (Hans Heinrich Von Twardowski) attended the show to witness a truly strange attraction: An aging scientist named Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss) unveils to an astounded audience a ghoulish sleepwalker named Cesare (Conrad Veidt), who the Doctor solely commands through the power of hypnotism. Under his control, Cesare awakens from his coffin-like box to prophesise people's fates. When an excited Alan asks Cesare, ""How long shall I live?"" he grimly utters, ""The time is short. You die at dawn!"" Meanwhile, the town police investigate a string of bizarre murders. Not surprisingly, Alan would end up becoming the killer's next victim!
Devastated by the sudden loss of his friend, Francis seeks aid from the town police. Together, they find clues linking the cold-blooded killings with Dr. Caligari's priceless freak of nature. In the film's latter half, Francis and the authorities read through the Doctor's notes and discover his most fiendish, insane ambition: The old man gleefully named himself after an 11th century monk who once toured across Northern Italy with a somnanbulist at his side. Dr. Caligari's studies reveal how he recruited poor Cesare from an insane asylum and forced him to commit acts of murder and terrorize innocent people! After the awful truth is exposed, justice prevails as the wicked Doctor is bound in a straitjacket and dragged away. Or is he?
I really love how Conrad Veidt's Cesare character is both terrifying and sympathetic. Although he basically wears a black bodysuit, his figure somehow provides the illusion of inhuman strength, like he was carved out of stone. However, that changes later on when Cesare breaks into the bedroom of Francis's betrothed Jane (Lil Dagover). In a state of torment, he raises the knife over his head and stops himself from stabbing the sleeping woman. In that instance, a viewer can realize that Cesare is only human, and that the Doctor is the true monster. The way actor Werner Krauss portrays him, by the way, is quite marvelous. He's clearly the manipulator of the story; a dangerously clever individual who tries desperately not to get caught. Finally, Friedrich Feher's Francis is a not a typical hero, but rather a traumatized young man seeking the truth; it's obvious that he's overcome with grief and driven almost mad. Did I say almost? As a participant in the movie's main action, Francis is both horrified and curious about the Doctor's motives.
This is a movie I definitely recommend to the openly artistic. The DVD is the perfect gift for Tim Burton fans!",1071360000,6,3377,5.064631956912029
752646,5,6303968163,"A young man, Francis, relates to others this bizarre and amazing tale: Francis and his friend, Alan, visit a fair that happens to be in a small German town where some brutal murders have taken place.  Dr. Caligari is the proprietor of an exhibit that features a chronic sleepwalker named Cesare who supposedly can make accurate prognostications. Francis and Alan are amused by this particular spectacle, but when they ask for a demonstration, they are a bit unnerved when Cesare predicts that Alan will be dead by morning.
When Alan is, in fact, murdered during the night, Francis suspects that Caligari and Cesare were involved in making Cesare's ""prediction"" come true, and he goes to the police with his suspicions.  Unfortunately, the police have arrested another man for Alan's murder, and they give Francis the brush-off.  Undeterred, Francis follows Caligari in hopes of obtaining proof of his suspicions.  When they ultimately wind up at an insane asylum, Francis is shocked to learn that Caligari is the director of the institution.  But with the help of Francis, it is soon revealed that Caligari has himself gone mad, and the good Doctor is subsequently hospitalized in his own institution.  Or is he?...
THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI (1920; 1921 for the U.S. version) is one of the masterpieces of the silent era and, along with Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS (1927), is one of the best examples of German Expressionist cinema.  Though the story is entertaining, the real genius lies not so much in the narrative as in the bizarre and surrealistic mise-en-scne.  The sets do not reflect nature or reality but are instead highly stylized--using an expressionist form that reflects both cubist and fauvist influence--and are meant to project to the audience the psychological discordance of Caligari and other characters in the film.  And the physical appearance of the characters, especially the principals, are also expressionistic exaggerations, making them more caricatures than characters and serving to heighten the sense of uneasiness and mental disharmony.  So to put it succinctly, the film conveys its underlying theme of ubiquitous psychosis as much through visuals as through narrative--an especially good quality in the era of silent films--and this fact elevates it above mere entertainment to the summit of high art.
Any film student, cinema aficionado, or collector of old classics will definitely want to add this movie to their collections. But some contemporary viewers may find it difficult to appreciate THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI.  Indeed, in this age of color ""talkies,"" it is sometimes hard for even ardent film students and aficionados to catch all of the nuances in the narrative and visuals of a silent film, and sometimes two or more viewings may therefore be required.  The wonderful collector's edition DVD from Image Entertainment offers a feature commentary by film historian Mike Budd, and a SECOND viewing with this commentary turned on will certainly help to clarify some of the more subtle aspects of this historical film.  (For the first time through, don't watch the film with the commentary, as Mr. Budd does early on reveal some facts about the ending.)",1070496000,,3195,5.156673114119923
752708,5,6303968163,"In the little German town of Holstenwall, performers have come from far and wide to set up exhibitions at the town's fair. Among them is a man named Dr. Caligari (Werner Krauss) who has brought a Somnambulist named Cesare (Conrad Veidt) to entertain the townsfolk. Cesare has slept for 23 years and, through his morbid trance, has acquired knowledge of the past and future. But shortly after Dr. Caligari and Cesare arrive, a series of grisly murders take place in the town. Francis (Friedrich Feher), whose best friend was a victim, vows to track down the person responsible for these hideous crimes.

""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" is a stunning example of both German expressionism and effective commercial entertainment. Directed by Robert Wiene in 1919, with extraordinary expressionist set design by Hermann Warm and a haunting modern musical score by Timothy Brock, ""Caligari"" is no less sophisticated in its themes or story-telling technique than modern films. In fact, it reminds me a lot of Alfred Hitchcock's work, in particular his television program. Oddly, the film isn't black-and-white. It's color -or ""colored"" actually. The film is toned. Scenes that take place at night have a bluish cast. Daytime -or indoor light- has a sepia tone. And a few scenes are actually purple, which I assume was intended to communicate a melancholy mood. (The film was originally hand-tinted, but later prints may not have been. The Image Entertainment DVD is tinted, but I don't know if the other DVD versions are.) The blue and purple casts are interesting, but seem garish at times. Most of the scenes are sepia, which is pleasing to the eye and gives the film a warmth that wouldn't be possible in neutral black&white. The story is told in flashback, and there are flashbacks inside of that one. I was surprised to see real visual effects in such an antique film. And there is a surprise ending no less startling than the ending of M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense"". In fact, the film's blurring of the boundaries between reality and fantasy, sanity and insanity, can be pretty unsettling. This is a rare horror film that succeeds in creating a true sense of horror at least once. ""Caligari""'s fanciful expressionist sets are absolutely fabulous. The sets alone would make the film worth watching. Add great writing and technique, and ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" is a wonderfully entertaining example of early cinema that really stands the test of time. Highly recommended. Intertitles are in English only.

The DVD (This refers to the Image Entertainment DVD only.): This is one of those DVDs that starts to play the film as soon as you put the disc into the machine, so be quick on the remote. Bonus features include excerpts from a film called ""Genuine: A Tale of a Vampire"", which director Robert Wiene made in 1920, and a excellent audio commentary by film historian Mike Budd. I highly recommend the commentary, but don't be tempted to listen to it the first time you view the film. The film suffers without its musical score, and the audio commentary gives away the ending early in the film. It's very worthwhile on your second viewing, though. Mike Budd talks about  the artistry of ""Caligari""  as well as the state of commercial film and expressionist art in Germany at the time. The film's speed is correct on this DVD, but the condition of the print leaves something to be desired. There is noticeable white noise (scratches) in much of the film, and there is a conspicuous dark band across the top of the screen in many of the scenes. Maybe the film was originally like that. This print certainly is. It would be nice if it were cleaned up. These flaws don't detract too much from the enjoyment of the film, but that dark band is especially obtrusive. On the other hand, I appreciate that this DVD was made from a print which has the original color tinting.",1068854400,4,3877,4.825563909774436
752709,5,6303968163,"I have owned a video copy of this film for years.  I first saw Das Kabinet des Dr. Caligari, and Nosferatu Eine Symphonie des Grauns when I was 12.  About the same time I saw the second Golem movie of the early 1920's by Paul Wegener.  I really enjoy the Dr Caligari movie, and prefer to think of the ending not as being a happy one, that the sick Francis would be cured by the kindly Dr. Caligari, but that he had been captured, and probably tortured in sequences after the film ends.  One could imagine something like Orlac's Hande. Conrad Veidt's, Ceasar, supposedly influnced the 1930's Frankenstein films by Universal, and certainly started that so common scene of the monster kidnapping the heroine.  But I think that influence was overstated.  Veidt was more influential, I think, in the scenes in the Cabinet.  That was a prototype for similar vampire scenes that would come in the future.  This and the silent movie The Man Who Laughs put him in the running to play Dracula after Lon Chaney died, but before the stage Dracula--Bela Lugosi--was hired.  Of course Veidt makes the most polished Nazi ever in Casablanca with Humphrey Bogart, Claude Reins, and Ingrid Bergman.  The figure of Cesare was even aped by Peter Murphey on his first solo album.

True, the film quality may leave something to be desired, but, as a student, I simply don't have much money to spend at the moment and I felt this version was a lifesaver. The film's cinematography is stunning; I can think of few others that place the audience so well in a confusing, murky, dreamlike environment. The costumes and makeup are outstanding as well. The lack of overblown special effects actually adds much to the film-- Cesare's stark makeup makes him five times more frightening than today's movie monsters. The high contrast between light and dark (in the setting and the costuming) only heightens the fear factor. In terms of plot, _Dr. Caligari_ keeps the audience engaged. The conclusion is open to interpretation. I have my own favorite theory of course, but I'll refrain from sharing it so that I don't spoil the film for any first time viewers. The film's influence is evident though I, like others, am surprised that no direct remake has been produced. One reviewer noted that Anthony Hopkins would make a good Dr. Caligari.

752791,5,6303968163,"A madman's fantasy, 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' is a still-unsettling mixture of the archaic and the avant-garde.  The celebrated sets, all grotesquely distorted, perspectively impossible, architecturally collapsed buildings and streets, strange angles and enigmatic geometric motifs, are like a demented revision of those medieval Central European villages that are usually the settings for these kind of stories; but they also echo (in monochrome) the folk-modernist paintings of Chagall, particularly those depicting Jewish shtetls with fantastic and dream imagery.
The mood and atmosphere, the world of carnies and somnambulists, of Town Clerks, bell-ringers and lunatic asylums, even of nocturnal serial killers, all suggest periods of time from the late-19th century backwards; but the oneiric filming of Cesare's unmotivated night wandering, his zombie face blanching a tight black bodystocking, is reminiscent of Feuillade's crime serials (such as 'Les Vampires'); also anticipating Surrealism is the strangely seeping texture of the imagery, with fragments of bodies on the brink of dematerialising.
The film is heavily influenced by Freud (from the homosexuality implicit in the central love triangle to the introduction of a phallic sleepwalker in a box by Caligari to Jane to the inability of Cesare to murder a virgin), but another 20th century giant is arguably more important: Kafka (one of the Prague-born screenwriters wrote for Kafka's friend, Max Brod).  From the comedy of bureaucracy (the aggressively officious Town Clerk; the gormless police) to the location of chaos, madness and murder in the ravings of paternal/patriarchal authority, the film's movement is one of remorseless anxiety - 'Caligari''s look is flooded with the dread paranoia of its narrator.
Even the mix of ancient documents and mystery plot is modern, looking forward to the stories of Borges.
It is easy to mock 'Caligari' in retrospect - the cop-out of the framing narrative (which I humbly think only deepens the film's themes, and produces an amazing asylum tableau); the reliance on theatrical (sets, acting) rather than cinematic expression; the absurd hamming of the actors (a truly haunted Conrad Veidt excepted).  But 'Caligari' has a lingering evocative power, a profound and phantasmagoric imagery that unfailingly penetrates those deepest and least admissable desires and fears supposedly 'better' films can't access.  No wonder critics for nearly a century have attributed all sorts of nonsense to it.
(Be warned: like 'Metropolis', the success of 'Caligari' depends on the quality of the score (the Redemption print I saw had a horrible Hollywood-horror, sub-Wagnerian over-emphasis) and the right speed (mine was played too fast, and was over in less than 50 minutes, making the story look like a daft pantomime)",1008115200,6,2822,5.571095571095571

Indeed, it is not the division between sane and insane that matters. What does matter is the use of Expressionism on screen. The visual texture of the film is evocative and startling, although to explain the Expressionism used as simply the example of a madman's vision is to undervalue the Expressionist movement as a whole.
 The entire film is shot in a studio, ensuring absolute directorial control, and the sets are beautifully and laboriously created and set the entire mood for the film. It is perhaps useful to see the film as a tone poem where the style transcends the content. The oddness of the streets, with the strongly rectangular zigzag shapes, suggests violence and instability. Even light in the film is shaped, as is shown by the streaks of white paint on the wall of the prisoner's cell. The film scorns the natural world for a more indicative one; absolutely everything the viewer is presented is constructed. In this way, the viewer is guided towards a feeling, an inner world of meaning. The living room of Jane's house is one of the most memorable sets of the film. It shares the tranquillity of Franz Marc's Expressionist painting 'The Large Blue Horses' by its use of round shapes and soft colours. The room exudes health and well being. There are even flowers in the room, in the very middle of the frame.
The camera angles remain largely normal and level, although the film does frequently use the extreme close up to suggest inner violence and the fear of confinement. Nonetheless, the camera is intended to be unshocking and a thing the viewer can relate to: an assumed normal person looking at an extraordinary Holstenwall.
The acting is rather melodramatic, as in most silent films, and the heavy make-up on Dr. Caligari and Cesare render them as much Expressionistic models as the sets. In the case of Cesare, it seems the paint on the sets has been smudged onto his face. He is almost literally part of the set, which is indicated when he sets out for Jane's house, sliding along the walls and corridors.
The film is very valuable to watch for its desire to be different and it is perhaps just as well that the story is not more original, as it would distract the viewer from the wealth of visual distinction available.",1004572800,5,2411,4.65962441314554

752797,4,6303968163,"I agree with many of the comments by previous reviewers.  The film is something of a museum piece, but continues to fascinate largely due to its strange, painted sets and other visual elements.  Those interested in this film, either as an important work of German cinema, or as a curiousity, may like to know the rest of Caligari's story...
The original screenwriters wrote a story of an insane doctor controlling a sleepwalker and using him to do his evil bidding. This could be considered a warning to the Germans not to ""sleepwalk"" into the control of an evil Caligari-like dictator. But then, the film was turned over to another German filmmaker who added a ""framing story"" that places the story of mad Caligari as a fantasy in the head of a patient in an asylum.  Intentional or not, this frame reverses the meaning of the film.  Instead of a warning against following authoritarian leaders blindly, the finished film positions Caligari as a compassionate doctor who can cure the patient now that the meaning of his insanity has been revealed.
A curious bit of film trivia, given where the world was heading.",973036800,18,1113,4.81151832460733
752798,4,6303968163,"This is basically the author of the horror films.  The first horror film was actually done by Thomas Edison; it was a movie short of Frankenstein.
Anyway, This movie is one of the greatest treasures in the history of film as well as of course the world of the horror films.  This is an eerie film that sticks to your mind and you cannot easily forget.  It is a must for cinema fans.
It has not only been called as the first horror film, but it is the first zombie film.  Its plot is an original one that has been modeled after since its release in '26.
First offered to Fritz Lang, he declined it to shoot Der Mud Tod (Destiny, another great).  One of the lead actors in this, Conrad Veite (the zombie), was listed down as one of the replacements for Dracula after Lon Chaney died.
There is so much history to this: one of the great German films beside that of Metropolis.
P.S.: I gave it a four only because of the poor D.V.D. transfer: they show a bar on the top of the screen in several frames throughout the film.  I understand they did this because they would have had to crop out part of the movie if they didn't.  Especially in parts where they show dialogue over the set, I agree with this method.

 REVIEW REVISED NOV-18-2014
****************************

I'm lumping several editions of this film in a single review so it would appear on all Amazon product pages of this film.  The editions I'm reviewing are:

2014 Kino Region-A Blu-ray (ASIN: B00N5ND6PU) and Region-1 DVD (ASIN: B00N5ND88U)
2014 Eureka Region-B Blu-ray/DVD combo (Amazon UK ASIN: B00KT67Q0W)
2002 Kino all-region NTSC DVD (ASIN: B00006JMQG)
1997 Image all-region NTSC DVD (ASIN: 6305075492)

""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" is a visually stunning German silent film that tells the story of a mad doctor who trains a sleepwalker to commit evil deeds.  It was a groundbreaking film in many ways, such as its use of an unreliable narrator as a framing device, and its expressionistic images resembling one's nightmare (or the mind state of a mentally-ill person) -- distorted views, deformed spaces, bizarre lights and shadows.  This film, in 1920, ushered in a new era of German Expressionism on film, a period that produced such classics as The Last Laugh, Nosferatu, Metropolis, and others.

There have been many public domain copies of ""Caligari"" sold in stores and online, or available free to view online.  Many of them use plain, static intertitles and have running times as short as 51 minutes.  The only versions worth seeing are the four I'm reviewing here due to their completeness of footage used (with running time over 70 minutes), the use of stylized intertitles, and, of course, improved picture quality.

Currently, the best edition for North America is the 2014 Region-A Blu-ray from Kino (ASIN: B00N5ND6PU).  A corresponding Region-B Blu-ray is also available from Eureka for European customers (Amazon UK ASIN: B00KT67Q0W).  These two editions are the result of a restoration, conducted by Germany's F.W. Murnau Foundation, that used the original camera negative for the first time.  Hence, the picture quality is exceedingly good here.  Even though the film's first act is missing from the camera negative (thus inferior footage had to be used in its place), the result as shown on the Blu-ray is still pretty good-looking, as attested by the screen captures at DVDBeaver.  The running time for both discs is 75 minutes, excluding restoration credits at the beginning and end.  This is the longest running time of all the editions reviewed here, possibly due to a slightly slower frame rate.  I noticed more footage as well: early in the film, for instance, the title card ""The annual fair"" is preceded by a shot of the protagonist not found in earlier DVD editions.  The stylized intertitles are in German only (supported by English subtitles), since they are from the camera negative's original flash titles.  As bonus features, both the Kino and Eureka discs contain an excellent 53-minute documentary on the history and significance of ""Caligari"".  The Eureka disc also includes a comprehensive full-length audio commentary by David Kalat, as well as a Region-2 DVD copy with the same content.  Kino's edition also comes in DVD, but it is sold separately (ASIN: B00N5ND88U).  Both the Kino and Eureka editions offer two music accompaniments: an original score composed and performed by Freiburg Conservatory of Music in Germany, and a more modern-sounding score by American hip hop musician Paul D. Miller.

The 2002 Kino DVD edition (ASIN: B00006JMQG) was based on a restoration by Bundesarchiv-Filmarchiv.  It runs 73 minutes, excluding restoration credits.  Stylized intertitles were recreated in English, but the DVD picture quality is not as good, with more noticeable print damages, especially near the beginning.  Two synthesizer music scores are included, by Donald Sosin and by Rainer Viertblck.  One noteworthy extra on this disc is a 44-minute version of the 1920 silent film ""Genuine: the Tale of a Vampire"", an expressionistic fantasy film that was director Robert Wiene's less successful followup to ""Caligari"".  The full-length, 88-minute version of this film is not available on home video.

In 1997, restorer David Shepard produced the first worthwhile DVD edition, released by Image Entertainment (ASIN: 6305075492).  It runs 71 minutes, excluding restoration credits.  Like the Kino 2002 disc, it uses stylized, recreated English intertitles.  But unlike the other three editions mentioned above, there are no title cards indicating the film's different acts.  Although the print quality seems to be quite good, the DVD is a ""port"" from the Image laserdisc edition, thus resulting in all kinds of video artifacts inherited from that outdated video format.  Also, due to an error made when the print was struck, there is a horizontal line near the top of the picture for much of the film's duration.  The DVD's picture is also window-boxed, which has now become a useless mode of presentation for modern TV sets.  Even with a nice chamber orchestra score by Timothy Brock and Mike Budd's insightful full-length audio commentary, this DVD is the least desirable edition among the four reviewed here due to the shortcomings mentioned above.",965952000,144,5077,5.285536159600998
752895,5,6303968163,"This silent film from 1921 has got such an eerie and ominous feel to it that it's almost physical.  Slowly crawling into the viewers minds are the haunting images of acid-trippy set design, the furtive, meaningful glances  of Dr. Caligari, and many, many dark things implied.  Much of the story is  pushed along not through the visual spectrum but by what the viewer is  forced to conjure as happening.  When the screen proclaims there have been  murders, the viewer sees them in bright, bloody detail.  They hear the  screams, feel the stabs, and know the maddness of the killer.  Keep in mind  this is a silent film!  The bizarre set design, flawless performances, and  the final scene with its seriously twisted ending make this essential  viewing for any film connosieur, especially those of you that stray toward  the genre of horror.  Come and take a look inside The Cabinet of Dr.  Caligari!",963619200,5,898,4.802631578947368
752896,5,6303968163,"This is an incredible film! For many years I was under the impression that silent films were all jerky, funny looking and boring. Then I saw Fritz Lang's Metropolis and all that changed. I was introduced to the world of  the German Impressionist film...and this is the Granddaddy of them all. A  great transfer of the film to start helps in viewing. A lot of the problems  with the old silent films are that the light levels keep fluctuating. But  when a company takes the time and expense to clean up and restore a film  the results are wonderful. The film is color tinted. (Not colored ...it's  like the siepa opening to the Wizard of Oz kind of thing) to make the  contrast level pop. The tiles are very cool to look at, as they were  recreations of the originals used. The commentary track is extra  interesting to point out the wonderful bits that can be over looked by the  average Joe. (Like the reasons some sets have angles and some have curves,  The light patterns following the footpaths..etc..) A wonderful piece of  filmmaking is a must for all film buffs to see the origins of a bunch of  toady's more artistic shots in cinema.",958694400,9,1141,4.507317073170731
752897,5,6303968163,"""Das Cabinet des Doktor Caligari"" ia an extraordinary silent film. Its experimentalism is perfectly coherent with this artistic movements (un)laws. Distorted settings, horror superimposed upon them and  an astonishing use of photography and art direction. Conrad Veidt as Cesar  is beyond all superlatives. The plot (as far as there is one) suffers from  the fact that the hospice scenes (at the very beginning & and at the  very ending) offer a logic and proper explanation for the rest of the  action - Lunacy In this way, ""normality"" (or normalicy?) is  half-restored, authority put in its place, and the whole thimg dismissed as  a madman's ravings. A pity that, really. Still, this is superb film making,  superb set decor and superb acting. Only 5 stars can truly do it justice.",948412800,2,784,5.023255813953488
752898,5,6303968163,"Although for the modern viewer the abstract stage sets and frenetic overacting will take some getting used to, this film is well worth the trouble.
Grandparent of all of the modern horror films (from the 1930's  Dracula and Frankenstien films up to modern works such as Halloween and  Spawn), this is the classic story of the Dark Outsider; here personified by  the Somnambulist Cesare and his evil master Caligari.  There is of course  the primal rape scene of the nightgown-clad woman menaced by the stealthy  killer, as well as the more baroque elements of Original Sin and Gypsy  Curses.  The ending will be a surprise to most who are not familiar with  the film, and begs a second viewing.
Much of the dreamlike,  halucinatory photography is effective, as is the peformance by the actor  playing Cesare (uncredited in my copy).
If you can suspend your  disbelief (and your urge to laugh at the campier moments) you will be  rewarded with some truly distubing images which you will not soon  forget.....",948067200,3,1007,4.847058823529411

The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is over 80 years old but the  plot, concept and characters, still work today.
I'm looking forward to  owning this film, it's an inspiration to me as a budding horror novelist  and should be an inspiration to film makers.

752900,5,6303968163,"To simply say that Weine's film represented a fork in the road of cinema would be as much an understatement as it would be a cop-out to coin here. The latter statement is all-too true, though: 'Das Kabinett von Dr.  Caligari' has been so often accredited as being the parent of pre-modern  film-making that the cliche can sadly never be defeated without daring to  challenge the veracity of the claim. At 52 minutes in length (6 reels), the  movie is a veritable carousel ride of thrills, chills and stark surprises,  all presented in a chilling set of surreal art, made even more chilling by  the early Expressionists' love of shadows. The plot is convoluted but not  so much so as to be confusing and a turn-off. A sideshow act comes with a  fair to the German town of Holstenwall. The act is a mountebank (later  revealed to be the head of the local asylum) and his somnambulist prophet  (later revealed to be one of the patients at said institution). No sooner  have they begun to work their concession than a string of murders occur.  The protagonist's friend's is one of them and soon a detective story  unwinds within the parameters of the main story. Behind the killings is  none other than the thinly-masked mountebank, Dr. Caligari, proving for  scientific purposes that he can make his sleepwalker kill upon suggestion.  Director Robert Weine inserts a sharp twist in the story at the end,  rendering the plotline as unreal as any of the scenery in the film. Loaded  with imagery that challenges the sanity but which delights the soul, 'The  Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' is streets ahead of being classifiable just as  being a horror movie ancestor. This is high art - the sets being hard  evidence of Weine and co.'s ardent desires to make a break with cinematic  dogma and go three steps beyond recreating realism for the lens. Here, in a  film shot eighty years ago, can be found suspense of such intensity that it  makes the picture seem more sinister than it really is. Conrad Veidt's  sleepwalker is terrifying and demonic: the viewer knows intuitively that  this type of killer cannot and will not listen to reason or mercy pleas.  Werner Krauss's portrayal of the bad doctor is splendidly done and is more  demonic-looking at times than his zombie-tool. The protagonists - a  student, his would-be girlfriend, her father and the police in Holstenwall  have to go to great pains to try and smoke Caligari out as the villain. The  crags and jagged diagonals of the set augment the fear factor and lend a  soporific heaviness to the characters and their doings. Even so, the actors  merely lie on the periphery of the film's power. The axis here is formed by  the silent, evil lucidity in the movie which serves to remind the viewer  that not only do the actors appear to be dead and otherworldly, they would  have to be dead and otherworldly by now. If I was allowed to watch but one  picture for the rest of my life, this would be it.",944870400,17,2948,4.6434108527131785
