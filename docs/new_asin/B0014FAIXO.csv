3131329,5,B0014FAIXO,"Here's a tip of the hat to Jack Klugman and Tony Randall.  They had a chemistry going that does not come along often.  I back-up that statement by asking this question; had one or the other left the series could another actor step in?
Randall sets it up and Klugman knocks it down - the result; laughter all around!
Thank you Jack!
Thank you Tony!",1206662400,10,347,4.323076923076923

3131341,5,B0014FAIXO,"So, ""The Odd Couple"" concludes its four seasons, in grand style.  Jack and Tony were always amazing together.  They loved each other as much as Oscar and Felix did.  I wish they'd been able to squeeze out just one more season, but I think both of them were ready to start doing other films and stage again, independently.  I have to give a ton of kudos to Garry and Tony Marshall (and I won't leave you out, Penny!) and Jerry Belson, who created and shaped the show into what it was.  They did it right.  Way right.  Basically, I have nothing to criticize.  This was one of the last comedies on TV that was above criticism.  It was consistently great, every week.  All the episodes were good.  Mind you, I was not alive when it was on TV originally.

It was in reruns forever before finally making it onto DVD.  I remember filling out a questionnaire from Columbia House, asking ""What shows would you like to see in our video Collectors Edition?"" and I suggested ""The Odd Couple.""  Anyhow, it will always be a favorite show.  As for this DVD - no special features to speak of but the episodes are crystal clear.  Not sure if they remastered the prints or anything?  I think Season 1 is the only one of the four with any special features.",1436832000,,1237,4.378854625550661

3131343,5,B0014FAIXO,"This was wonderful. I never did see why some panned this DVD set. The editing did not disrupt my enjoyment in any way. No singing ? I heard singing.
Anyway....they just don't make TV like this anymore, with good natured humor and class. I especially enjoyed Penny Marshall's contribution as Myrna and Al Molinaro as Murray. The most memorable episodes for me were....""That Was No lady"",  ""Odd Holiday"" , ""The New Car"" , ""This is The Army Mrs Madison"", ""Maid For Each Other"" ( Oscar gets a babysitter), ""The Exorcist"" ,  ""Cleanliness Is Next To Impossible"" ( Oscar becomes a neat-freak), "" The Flying Felix "" ( Felix in an airplane are some of the funniest scenes ever) , ""Shuffling Off To Buffalo"" ( Felix goes to work in his brother's bubble gum factory), "" New York's Oddest "" ( they become cops), and  ""One For The Bunny"" ( Gloria Unger poses naked for Playboy).

P'mount will find a whole new audience waiting to purchase these, so it would be worth their while to do so.

3131369,1,B0014FAIXO,"First of all, let me say that I LOVE the Odd Couple. I am complaining about the editing. It seems that someone at Paramount became terrorized at the idea of a lawsuit by some music company. They they then proceeded to edit out every musical reference in the entire series. For example, in the classic episode where Felix is afraid to fly, Penny Marshall pretends to be a stewardess and briefly sings "" I'm Myrna, Fly Me!"". It's cut. That's just 1 example, there are many many more. Really Paramount? Do you really feel someone will sue because of those few musical bars? I think your copryright lawyers are wacky, but if that's the case, go pay the holders of those songs so you can use them. You're Paramount, for heaven sakes!",1333843200,6,728,4.5227272727272725

3131373,1,B0014FAIXO,"""The Odd Couple"" is my all-time, number one favorite TV show.  And not being able to own the complete series on DVD is one of the saddest things ever to happen.  I bought the first two seasons.  They were great.  Season three onward were butchered beyond belief.  I honestly don't know what, if anything, Paramount was thinking to allow such an atrocious release.  I used to watch The Odd Couple on TV Land years ago.  The cuts on this DVD are even worse than in syndication!  Further more, I used to own (back when I still had a working VCR) the complete Columbia House VHS set.  I really wish I had hung on to those, because every episode they released (although they only released half the series) was uncut, with all the original music intact.  These DVDs are not even worth the plastic used to make them.",1286928000,26,809,4.442176870748299
3131374,1,B0014FAIXO,"I appreciate these reviews.  Saved me some money.  I can't buy these without the full episodes.  My husband is a HUGE ""Odd Couple"" fan and knows them by heart. I was going to get these for his 50th birthday as a big surprise.  But I won't spend this kind of money if things are cut out, not worth it.  Especially when all he would be saying is ""What happened to that scene they cut it ou or why did they leave the singing part out""  Love the show but not worth the price, won't buy until they correct it.

3131377,1,B0014FAIXO,"Every season of this classic show has been slapped together with no thought given to the presentation. Even one edit is unacceptable but these releases are sliced and diced and it is evident even to people unacquainted with the original episodes let alone the true fans. It is just this type of slap in the face to fans that makes people turn to bootlegs. I support the legitimate releases and this is what I get for it? Thanks for nothing.

Add to this the fact that there is nothing in the way of extras, not even so much as a single outtake, an interview or a trailer. You can be sure that I won't buy any future Paramount DVD products until I've read a couple dozen reviews.",1230249600,11,678,4.338582677165355

WHY??  a few words here, a phrase there... it makes NO sense.  it really hurts.  i have to say, i know almost all the episodes by heart. and i have old vhs tapes; i have old mass-market columbia house VHSs (my bf is constantly asking me if we need to really keep these 25+ vhs cases around our small nyc apartment) and i was SO excited when it was revealed the greatest show ever would be available on DVD. as many others did, i expected these to be the COMPLETE episodes.  if not, why bother?  i agree that ""extras"" would have been nice (i actually have the originally-released first season in the big, fold-out cardboard case, and there are some Gary Marshall, Jack Klugman commentaries, some intros and extras -- The Mike Douglas show is nice) but what these releases are really about are the excellent episodes. they deserve to be preserved in their entirety. (i give a star for the color restoration and a star for the show's untaintable genius.) but now this DVD goes down as the canonical version, and many little hilarious touches and phrases will be lost forever.

3131379,5,B0014FAIXO,"This is a wonderful show even WITH cuts.  I think it is awful to give such a wonderful show one star because of the cuts.  Where we are reviewing a product overall, it is difficult to know where to land with the star reviews.  Granted the cuts are an assault to the show, but the show itself is still wonderful.

I may not be getting any kudos for this review...but wanted to at least try to even out the star ratings.  I think this is a wonderful show and I liked it the first time around when it first aired on TV.  It is funny, entertaining and creative :)",1224288000,7,559,4.08256880733945
3131380,1,B0014FAIXO,"I,too, am very disappointed with the obvious deletion of just about every song in Season 4.  I absolutely LOVE this show and couldn't wait until all seasons were released. Now I'll have to pay closer attention to seasons 1-3 and 5. Only true Odd Couple fans will catch the obvious substitutions. For example, in the episode, ""This is the Army, Mrs. Madison, Felix and Murray serenade Oscar and Blanche with ""I Love You Truly""....deleted on DVD and dubbed with Murray playing ""Birmingham Jail"" on the harmonica...you hear the audience laugh at Felix singing, but on this release, he's NOT singing, so you're not quiet sure why the audience is laughing. The purpose of purchasing DVDs is to watch the episodes in their entirety, the way they were originally aired on TV. CBS/Paramount should never have released the Odd Couple if there was a problem with  Hopefully they will re-release all 5 seasons again, without cutting a single minute. I just wanted to give a heads up to other Odd Couple fans, that they, too, will be disappointed with the editing.",1222992000,13,1052,4.838888888888889
3131381,4,B0014FAIXO,"I watched this show endlessly on WPIX in New York, growing up in the 1970's and 1980's. I have all 4 seasons so far, and I will pick up season 5. I was showing an episode, ""Odd Holiday"", to my kids, who, by the way, love the show. It's a flashback episode, and before going into the flashback, Murray asks Oscar if the picture was going to go all wavy.  The flashback, I can remember from WPIX, had Felix singing ""gotta get going, gotta get going..."", and hitting his knee with a magazine. On the DVD, there was no ""wavy"" going into the flashback, just a jump cut to the past. It jumps straight over Felix and the magazine, and goes straight to Gloria picking up the magazine and tapping her knee - Felix says that's annoying. Without Felix's tapping, there is no joke - the irony that Felix is annoyed at what he was doing before her. I don't know if anybody caught that, but that little snippet missing (for no apparent reason), ruined the joke.

On the plus side, every episode in this set (plus the previous 3) had about 3-4 minutes of footage that I have never seen before, so that is a good thing. I just don't know why little snippets like the one above was cut. I don't think it was a music issue.

The show gets 5 stars, but it loses a star for the nonsense editing. Overall, it's still better than syndication.",1220400000,8,1320,4.293172690763052

3131383,3,B0014FAIXO,"I am also disappointed in the music edits, however, I would blame the music owners that are charging excessive amounts of money to use a few bars of a song in most instances.  If I owned the music, I would rather get some money then have them edit it out and get nothing.  They had no problem licensing the music when the show was originally produced, so I don't know why they would want to ruin the show on dvd and end up with nothing.  By accepting a reasonable amount for its use, people may hear it in the episode and actually go out and purchase the cd and make them more money.  That is what I don't understand.",1218758400,4,617,4.159663865546219

I did get seasons 1 - 3 and was pretty let down by the edits. (season 1 actually don't think there were any) And it seems, judging by your reviews, they only got worse in season 4. I must agree with all of you especially the ones who said, even as a diehard fan we just couldn't watch, because when a favorite part came up that made you laugh, it wasn't there. Yep, these corporate dimwits really screwed up one of the best shows on TV. So there will be no purchasing of seasons 4 & 5 for me.

3131385,1,B0014FAIXO,"Shameful and disgusting!...

As much as I love the TV show ""THE ODD COUPLE"", I will give Paramount a one star rating (and that is a lot!) just because of their DVD episode butchering that is so evident throughout all of their Odd Couple DVD season box set releases.

Personally,  and I am 100% certain this is true for all Odd Couple fans, I would have paid twice as much and even more if necessary just to have the complete episodes as they were intended to be.

The Odd Couple is a classic American TV show and a part of American television's evolution, heritage and history. They do not make television shows like this anymore. The Odd Couple should not have been butchered at all! A lot of love and care should have been given to every single one of the Odd Couple episode releases. Apparently, there was not the slightest consideration given to the artistic devotion and integrity of everyone involved in this great TV show.

3131386,4,B0014FAIXO,"I came across these reviews since I was looking for Season 5. Having just finished Season 4, I HAD to read why this got the lowest review of any Odd Couple release. I really think people are over-reacting when they comment on missing songs. While some of these are inexcusable, is it really productive to give it only 1 star? Believe me, the corporations in question are not reading these and saying ""Oh, we better give them what they want"". These episodes are for the most part better than anything else on Television, past and present. I did notice that one Episode obviously began in the middle (A Different Drummer) but really, is it that big a deal? Does that missing 1 minute take away from the other 24 minutes of quality? I don't think so. I have downgraded a review for omission of material that should have been included - (Genesis box set 1983-1997) but that was because of different reasons. I can see knocking off stars because people don't like all the cameos but not for a few seconds of music.
FYI, in my opinion, this is not the best of the 4 seasons so far but I felt obligated to give it a higher rating to offset the 1's that are complaining about ""lack of content"" compared to ""content""",1217808000,8,1207,4.441441441441442

All they are trying to do is get more money out of people and that is such a shame. This is a show that we have waited so long to come out on DVD and the people at Paramount have butchered it so badly. To the reviewer who thinks this is no big deal I have this to say: We waited for these to come out on DVD so we could AVOID those cuts on TV. That is the whole idea behind releasing it.

Listen, money is tight with gas & food prices soaring, the mere fact that we buy these DVDs shows that we really love this show and for them to edit, cut &/or change it is incomprehensible & inexcusable. This does NOT surprise me about Paramount. As a Blu-Ray owner, it disgusts me how cheap they are with the extras & bonus materials on their BD discs. The more I think about it, another example of Paramount's contempt for a classic show and it's fanbase, Star Trek.

I have purchased the first four seasons of one of my all-time favorite series, The Odd Couple, but I refuse to buy Season 5.  It's simply too painful to pay hard-earned money, then see how something I've waited 30+ years to view has been butchered due to the cheapskates at CBS.

I am so sick of being sold short by corruptorate fat cats.  Until I can be assured that all five seasons have been restored and re-released, I will be boycotting everything CBS and/or Paramount releases.  Everything.

I feel thoroughly cheated.  It seems that in the case of The Odd Couple, F.U. does not stand for Felix Unger.  It's what CBS is saying to its customers by cheating us. :-/",1215388800,30,741,4.518796992481203

Would it have been good if we could get all uncut episodes, yes but then again not even on tv -here in NY they run at 2:00am - can  you watch an uncut episode. I used to watch this show as a kid on channel 11 and frankly there is not that much that has been cut off that I can remember.  So if you love the Odd Couple and want to see them again, please buy these dvd's. The edits are in my opinion a minor inconvenience.  I have bought all four seasons and I hope to buy the fifth when it comes out. Season four is probably the best season of the Odd Couple the great comedic timing of Klugman and Randall should not be missed and I hope that these dvd's create a new generation of fans. The Odd Couple was one of my favorite shows as a kid and it is great to see them again.

3131396,1,B0014FAIXO,"It breaks my heart to have to give 1 star to my all-time favorite show, but this is just another brutal job of artistic butchery by the empty suits at CBS/Paramount.

If you're familiar with the CBS/Paramount debacle on removing ALL music from The Fugitive (see the horrible reviews here on Amazon), then you know that CBS/Paramount has taken an exteremely lame tact: instead of even TRYING to settle music clearance issues, they have instead opted to avoid any POSSIBLE payments by simply cutting out ALL music on the show.  Whoever their counsel is that advised them to do this, he should be out of a job.

The cuts are just ridiculous, and have been well documented by others here.  I mean, isn't there such a thing as Fair Use?  Felx sings ONE LINE of The Banana Boat song (Day-O) to wake up Oscar.  Gone.  Oscar is offered $500 to be in Felix's movie.  His response: ""I'm Gonna Be in Pictures"" - ONE LINE. Gone.

I can see a few popular songs having to go due to expensive royalties, but it seems that Paramount is now taking an overly cautious and downright lazy approach and instead of dealing with the issue at all, they have decided to just cut the whole damn thing out, fans be damned.

I will NEVER, NEVER buy another CBS/Paramount product unless they rectify this.  Put out a deluxe set for hradcore fans with all of the music put back in.  I'd buy it, regardless of cost.",1214438400,38,1384,4.47011952191235

It's a shame that such an amazing show that took so long to come out on DVD has been butchered so badly. I'm so fed up with Paramount's awful editing that I've reedited the episodes putting back some of the funniest scenes they took out. I can't imagine that it's so expensive to put 3 seconds of Oscar humming ""Dance Ballerina, Dance"" into an episode.  Paramount, don't be so greedy.

And there is NO WAY to get UNCUT episodes off TV..because Paramount-sends out PRECUT 're-cut"" episodes to Tv stations wtih 5 minutes ALREADY edited out for time.

 Does anyone know exactly what is cut out in the 3rd & 4th season DVD's (which episode and where the cuts are ?) Can you make a list here on AMAZON?

I have figured out a FEW myself from MEMORY--such as the beginning of the SOPHISTOCATOS (Monty Hall ) episode and the GREAT missing line by OSCAR in the great FELIX DIRECTS episode ""I'm Gonna  Be In Pictures"". And as I have read--they have CUT MYRNA's great lines and FELIX's great ""FUSILAGE"" lines  out of one of the series funniest episodes THE FLYING FELIX is BLASPHOMY--that must be 100% uncut,. That's a true classic!!!

 Maybe I can spend my ENTIRE SUMMER constructing a set of UNCUT DVD's using the Paramount dvds for Season 3 and 4 and ALL my old VHS tapes..and maybe have complete episodes...if i PRAY LOL

I assume the 5th Season will also be a disaster due to the MUSIC in the episode with ROY CLARK, PERNELL ROBERTS, PAUL WILLIAMS and other bits and pieces paramount will be TOO CHeap TO INCLUDE!!!",1214006400,12,1254,4.668181818181818

I am very disappointed in the edits as well. In the ""Flying Felix""
episode there is a classic moment that has been edited out.
When Myrna sings ""I'm Myrna fly me to the friendly skies..."" then she
tries to do it in German and Oscar tells her ""this is a domestic flight""
CLASSIC!!! How in the world do you cut one of the best scenes from the episode?
All in all though, it's still The Odd Couple and I will continue to watch.
I would love to complain to Paramount but not sure how -- does anyone know? We fans should stand together and complain! How dare they butcher one of the best shows ever!!! Really, what was the point? Did they run out of room on the cd?  I doubt it!!",1213920000,4,737,4.0479452054794525
3131401,1,B0014FAIXO,"I am really getting sick of the missing scenes all throughout each season. As noted before by previous customers, there are several, blaring edits in just about every episode. This is a rip off!! One of my favorite scenes in ""Odd Holiday"" is the part where Gloria, Felix and Blanche are waiting for Oscar to come home and Felix is tapping the rolled up magazine and singing ""Gotta get going, gotta get going, what are we gonna do? We're on our way to somewhere, the three of us and Oscar."" Of course, they cut it out. This is like buying The Godfather and having the entire horse scene cut.",1213660800,9,590,4.422018348623853
3131402,4,B0014FAIXO,"In my opinion season 4 of The Odd Couple was their last great season. This is the season where they hit their peak. Season 5 still had some great episodes but you could tell the end was near. Season 4 also contains my most favorite episode ""The Flying Felix"". This histerical episodes showcases Tony Randall's and Jack Klugman's absolute perfect chemistry together. Now concerning the edits in this edition, there are quite a few, but because this is my all time favorite TV show I am willing to make concessions on this. Don't know why Paramount is doing the edits but hopefully in the future the episodes will be complete and unedited in other dvd editions. I know these episodes backwards and forwards and I noticed a few more edits in addition to the ones listed here by other reviewers. In ""Felix Directs"" there is a scene where a director agrees to pay Oscar $500 to appear in his and Felix's new film. Oscar gets so excited about the offer that he start's to sing ""I'm gonna be in pictures!"". That scene has been edited out. In ""The Insomniacs"" episode Felix has not been able to sleep for unknown reasons. There is a scene where Oscar, Murry, and Myrna try to sing ""Dream when your feeling blue"" softly to Felix. Felix almost falls asleep after the song is done until Murry shouts out ""ONE MORE TIME!"" and wakes him up. A hilarious scene that was edited out. Shame on Paramount. The episodes have been remastered and overall look fantastic. Some grain is present though. Overall however I'm still happy that all 5 seasons will be available even with the edits. I also wish there were some bonus features. Still recommended though.",1213488000,5,1638,4.632302405498282
3131403,3,B0014FAIXO,"As with Season 3, it's mixed feelings and three stars for Season 4 of the Odd Couple on DVD. I just got through the set and I laughed plenty. But once again, the arbitary edits occasionally turn enjoyment into annoyance. As a previous reviewer notes, the Sophisticados opening song is missing from ""A Different Drummer."" And a song Myrna sings is dropped from ""The Flying Felix"" (I have to admit I wouldn't have caught that one). But there are also sloppy short cuts. For example, in the first episode, ""Gloria Moves In"", Felix shows up to spoil the poker game and at one point says to Oscar, ""You know, I used to sing the blues for Gloria."" Then, ZAP! A quick cut in the film and the audience is laughing at some bit of singing we've missed. There are a few similarly noticeable cuts.

The good news, ""A Different Drummer"" does include all the singing of ""Stumbling All Around"" -- so that bodes well for next season's classic ""Laugh Clown Laugh"" episode.

Season 4 might be slightly weaker than 2 and 3. There's some formula creeping in: more wacky one-shot characters with ""Dracula"" accents ... another episode with Felix needing Oscar's help to get the performer he wants ... another instance (the show's third, at least) of Felix humiliating Oscar on the stand in court.... Still lots of laughs though, and some of the series' best episodes: NY's Oddest, The Odd Decathlon, Felix Directs and more. And Tony Randall and Jack Klugman get funnier in their performances each season.

Here's the list of this DVD's episodes, and their lengths. I couldn't spot every cut, but the lengths should give some idea of where to look for edits.

3131405,5,B0014FAIXO,"Jeez, I am already reading reviews crying ""foul!"" about possible missing music or edits, and this DVD hasn't even been released yet as of these writings!! Don't necessarily be alarmed when the packaging says ""Some Material May Be Edited For This Video Version"" -- because this has been a standard practice which the studio has used in the past ""just to cover themselves in case"". In actual fact, there have been times when episodes of a show have been intact even though this disclaimer is added as a matter of routine. See my comments on SEASON THREE for more of this in detail... I'm just a fan but am wondering if Paramount may be saving their money for Seasons 4 and 5, since these shows are much more reliant on music-driven stories, and they need the songs in many cases to keep them comprehensible (which was not always the case with SEASON THREE). So let's give them the benefit of the doubt and wait and see before complaining.

EDITED IN JUNE 2008:
--well, my optimism was short-lived, because Volume 4 has been released and there have been more music edits. As a huge fan of this show I certainly think this sucks, but yet I've still bought this season anyway and I hope to get Season 5 as well. Consider:

The facts are, Paramount just feels the fees are too expensive to pay to music rights holders, especially for a show like THE ODD COUPLE, which wouldn't sell big enough numbers on DVD for them to justify the cost. Fans should realize that these episodes have never looked or sounded better, and even though some episodes (not all) are trimmed for music issues, you're still getting 95% or more of each show... sometimes 100%, when there are no music concerns. As a diehard fan I'd still rather have these DVDs than settle for old VHS broadcasts which are EVEN MORE EDITED TO MAKE SPACE FOR COMMERCIALS, and are probably missing 7 or 8 minutes each!

If I thought that not buying these DVDs would ensure that Paramount would go back and re-release them with ALL th emusic cues intact, then I woud wait. But I don't realistically think this is ever going ot happen, and so 95% is better than only 75% - or nothing at all.",1208390400,23,2137,4.516795865633075
3365825,2,B0014FAIXO,"Have seen a picture of the rear box art and the infamous Paramount disclamer (Edited content, music changes) is listed on it.

3365826,5,B0014FAIXO,"Here's a tip of the hat to Jack Klugman and Tony Randall.  They had a chemistry going that does not come along often.  I back-up that statement by asking this question; had one or the other left the series could another actor step in?

Thank you Jack!
Thank you Tony!",1206662400,10,347,4.323076923076923
3365834,5,B0014FAIXO,"love it -- brings back fond memories of my life in NYC. I feel as if I've been transformed to the old days every time I watch the Odd Couple. I have the complete season, now, and I am happy!",1451865600,,190,3.775

3365838,5,B0014FAIXO,"So, ""The Odd Couple"" concludes its four seasons, in grand style.  Jack and Tony were always amazing together.  They loved each other as much as Oscar and Felix did.  I wish they'd been able to squeeze out just one more season, but I think both of them were ready to start doing other films and stage again, independently.  I have to give a ton of kudos to Garry and Tony Marshall (and I won't leave you out, Penny!) and Jerry Belson, who created and shaped the show into what it was.  They did it right.  Way right.  Basically, I have nothing to criticize.  This was one of the last comedies on TV that was above criticism.  It was consistently great, every week.  All the episodes were good.  Mind you, I was not alive when it was on TV originally.

It was in reruns forever before finally making it onto DVD.  I remember filling out a questionnaire from Columbia House, asking ""What shows would you like to see in our video Collectors Edition?"" and I suggested ""The Odd Couple.""  Anyhow, it will always be a favorite show.  As for this DVD - no special features to speak of but the episodes are crystal clear.  Not sure if they remastered the prints or anything?  I think Season 1 is the only one of the four with any special features.",1436832000,,1237,4.378854625550661

3365840,5,B0014FAIXO,"This was wonderful. I never did see why some panned this DVD set. The editing did not disrupt my enjoyment in any way. No singing ? I heard singing.
Anyway....they just don't make TV like this anymore, with good natured humor and class. I especially enjoyed Penny Marshall's contribution as Myrna and Al Molinaro as Murray. The most memorable episodes for me were....""That Was No lady"",  ""Odd Holiday"" , ""The New Car"" , ""This is The Army Mrs Madison"", ""Maid For Each Other"" ( Oscar gets a babysitter), ""The Exorcist"" ,  ""Cleanliness Is Next To Impossible"" ( Oscar becomes a neat-freak), "" The Flying Felix "" ( Felix in an airplane are some of the funniest scenes ever) , ""Shuffling Off To Buffalo"" ( Felix goes to work in his brother's bubble gum factory), "" New York's Oddest "" ( they become cops), and  ""One For The Bunny"" ( Gloria Unger poses naked for Playboy).

I was showing an episode, ""Odd Holiday"", to my kids, who, by the way, love the show. It's a flashback episode, and before going into the flashback, Murray asks Oscar if the picture was going to go all wavy.  The flashback, I can remember from WPIX, had Felix singing ""gotta get going, gotta get going..."", and hitting his knee with a magazine. On the DVD, there was no ""wavy"" going into the flashback, just a jump cut to the past. It jumps straight over Felix and the magazine, and goes straight to Gloria picking up the magazine and tapping her knee - Felix says that's annoying. Without Felix's tapping, there is no joke - the irony that Felix is annoyed at what he was doing before her. I don't know if anybody caught that, but that little snippet missing (for no apparent reason), ruined the joke.

On the plus side, every episode in this set (plus the previous 3) had about 3-4 minutes of footage that I have never seen before, so that is a good thing. I just don't know why little snippets like the one above was cut. I don't think it was a music issue.

They had no problem licensing the music when the show was originally produced, so I don't know why they would want to ruin the show on dvd and end up with nothing.

As much as I love the TV show ""THE ODD COUPLE"", I will give Paramount a one star rating (and that is a lot!) just because of their DVD episode butchering that is so evident throughout all of their Odd Couple DVD season box set releases.

Personally,  and I am 100% certain this is true for all Odd Couple fans, I would have paid twice as much and even more if necessary just to have the complete episodes as they were intended to be.

The Odd Couple is a classic American TV show and a part of American television's evolution, heritage and history. They do not make television shows like this anymore. The Odd Couple should not have been butchered at all! A lot of love and care should have been given to every single one of the Odd Couple episode releases. Apparently, there was not the slightest consideration given to the artistic devotion and integrity of everyone involved in this great TV show.

I really think people are over-reacting when they comment on missing songs. While some of these are inexcusable, is it really productive to give it only 1 star? Believe me, the corporations in question are not reading these and saying ""Oh, we better give them what they want"". These episodes are for the most part better than anything else on Television, past and present. I did notice that one Episode obviously began in the middle (A Different Drummer) but really, is it that big a deal? Does that missing 1 minute take away from the other 24 minutes of quality? I don't think so. I have downgraded a review for omission of material that should have been included - (Genesis box set 1983-1997) but that was because of different reasons. I can see knocking off stars because people don't like all the cameos but not for a few seconds of music.
FYI, in my opinion, this is not the best of the 4 seasons so far but I felt obligated to give it a higher rating to offset the 1's that are complaining about ""lack of content"" compared to ""content""",1217808000,8,1207,4.441441441441442

To the reviewer who thinks this is no big deal I have this to say: We waited for these to come out on DVD so we could AVOID those cuts on TV. That is the whole idea behind releasing it.

This does NOT surprise me about Paramount. As a Blu-Ray owner, it disgusts me how cheap they are with the extras & bonus materials on their BD discs. The more I think about it, another example of Paramount's contempt for a classic show and it's fanbase, Star Trek.

If you're familiar with the CBS/Paramount debacle on removing ALL music from The Fugitive (see the horrible reviews here on Amazon), then you know that CBS/Paramount has taken an exteremely lame tact: instead of even TRYING to settle music clearance issues, they have instead opted to avoid any POSSIBLE payments by simply cutting out ALL music on the show.  Whoever their counsel is that advised them to do this, he should be out of a job.

The cuts are just ridiculous, and have been well documented by others here.  I mean, isn't there such a thing as Fair Use?  Felx sings ONE LINE of The Banana Boat song (Day-O) to wake up Oscar.  Gone.  Oscar is offered $500 to be in Felix's movie.  His response: ""I'm Gonna Be in Pictures"" - ONE LINE. Gone.

I can see a few popular songs having to go due to expensive royalties, but it seems that Paramount is now taking an overly cautious and downright lazy approach and instead of dealing with the issue at all, they have decided to just cut the whole damn thing out, fans be damned.

I will NEVER, NEVER buy another CBS/Paramount product unless they rectify this.  Put out a deluxe set for hradcore fans with all of the music put back in.  I'd buy it, regardless of cost.",1214438400,38,1384,4.47011952191235

 Does anyone know exactly what is cut out in the 3rd & 4th season DVD's (which episode and where the cuts are ?) Can you make a list here on AMAZON?

tries to do it in German and Oscar tells her ""this is a domestic flight""
CLASSIC!!! How in the world do you cut one of the best scenes from the episode?

Season 5 still had some great episodes but you could tell the end was near. Season 4 also contains my most favorite episode ""The Flying Felix"". This histerical episodes showcases Tony Randall's and Jack Klugman's absolute perfect chemistry together. Now concerning the edits in this edition, there are quite a few, but because this is my all time favorite TV show I am willing to make concessions on this. Don't know why Paramount is doing the edits but hopefully in the future the episodes will be complete and unedited in other dvd editions. I know these episodes backwards and forwards and I noticed a few more edits in addition to the ones listed here by other reviewers. In ""Felix Directs"" there is a scene where a director agrees to pay Oscar $500 to appear in his and Felix's new film. Oscar gets so excited about the offer that he start's to sing ""I'm gonna be in pictures!"". That scene has been edited out. In ""The Insomniacs"" episode Felix has not been able to sleep for unknown reasons. There is a scene where Oscar, Murry, and Myrna try to sing ""Dream when your feeling blue"" softly to Felix. Felix almost falls asleep after the song is done until Murry shouts out ""ONE MORE TIME!"" and wakes him up. A hilarious scene that was edited out. Shame on Paramount. The episodes have been remastered and overall look fantastic. Some grain is present though. Overall however I'm still happy that all 5 seasons will be available even with the edits. I also wish there were some bonus features. Still recommended though.",1213488000,5,1638,4.632302405498282
3365900,3,B0014FAIXO,"As with Season 3, it's mixed feelings and three stars for Season 4 of the Odd Couple on DVD. I just got through the set and I laughed plenty. But once again, the arbitary edits occasionally turn enjoyment into annoyance. As a previous reviewer notes, the Sophisticados opening song is missing from ""A Different Drummer."" And a song Myrna sings is dropped from ""The Flying Felix"" (I have to admit I wouldn't have caught that one). But there are also sloppy short cuts. For example, in the first episode, ""Gloria Moves In"", Felix shows up to spoil the poker game and at one point says to Oscar, ""You know, I used to sing the blues for Gloria."" Then, ZAP! A quick cut in the film and the audience is laughing at some bit of singing we've missed. There are a few similarly noticeable cuts.

The good news, ""A Different Drummer"" does include all the singing of ""Stumbling All Around"" -- so that bodes well for next season's classic ""Laugh Clown Laugh"" episode.

Season 4 might be slightly weaker than 2 and 3. There's some formula creeping in: more wacky one-shot characters with ""Dracula"" accents ... another episode with Felix needing Oscar's help to get the performer he wants ... another instance (the show's third, at least) of Felix humiliating Oscar on the stand in court.... Still lots of laughs though, and some of the series' best episodes: NY's Oddest, The Odd Decathlon, Felix Directs and more. And Tony Randall and Jack Klugman get funnier in their performances each season.

Here's the list of this DVD's episodes, and their lengths. I couldn't spot every cut, but the lengths should give some idea of where to look for edits.

3365902,5,B0014FAIXO,"Jeez, I am already reading reviews crying ""foul!"" about possible missing music or edits, and this DVD hasn't even been released yet as of these writings!! Don't necessarily be alarmed when the packaging says ""Some Material May Be Edited For This Video Version"" -- because this has been a standard practice which the studio has used in the past ""just to cover themselves in case"". In actual fact, there have been times when episodes of a show have been intact even though this disclaimer is added as a matter of routine. See my comments on SEASON THREE for more of this in detail... I'm just a fan but am wondering if Paramount may be saving their money for Seasons 4 and 5, since these shows are much more reliant on music-driven stories, and they need the songs in many cases to keep them comprehensible (which was not always the case with SEASON THREE). So let's give them the benefit of the doubt and wait and see before complaining.

EDITED IN JUNE 2008:
--well, my optimism was short-lived, because Volume 4 has been released and there have been more music edits. As a huge fan of this show I certainly think this sucks, but yet I've still bought this season anyway and I hope to get Season 5 as well. Consider:

The facts are, Paramount just feels the fees are too expensive to pay to music rights holders, especially for a show like THE ODD COUPLE, which wouldn't sell big enough numbers on DVD for them to justify the cost. Fans should realize that these episodes have never looked or sounded better, and even though some episodes (not all) are trimmed for music issues, you're still getting 95% or more of each show... sometimes 100%, when there are no music concerns. As a diehard fan I'd still rather have these DVDs than settle for old VHS broadcasts which are EVEN MORE EDITED TO MAKE SPACE FOR COMMERCIALS, and are probably missing 7 or 8 minutes each!

If I thought that not buying these DVDs would ensure that Paramount would go back and re-release them with ALL th emusic cues intact, then I woud wait. But I don't realistically think this is ever going ot happen, and so 95% is better than only 75% - or nothing at all.",1208390400,23,2137,4.516795865633075

This is the season where the intro changed, no more voice-over, but looking at the episode list some well-remembered shows on there (also observed sound a little louder than season 3).",1504569600,,328,4.576271186440678

8255453,5,B0014FAIXO,"I feel I have to voice- especially for the sake of any interested customers who've never seen the show or this season- the opinion that the musical cues/performance cuts have rarely spoiled or impacted negatively on the viewing experience for me. And I watched these during their original, run, yes, pre-syndication, AND in syndication and I've got a very good memory for details. When you take what you DO get here and set it aside what's missing, I'm sorry, to not get and watch and enjoy this item based on that amount of loss is like throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Two instances are jarring, I'll admit, an abrupt cut at the start of an episode and one which is the punch line at the end, but, when you've got the natural and remarkable fluidity and chemistry of Randall and Klugman's performances... well, I was carried along right past the minor ""speed bumps"". I'll admit, the geek in me got a bit annoyed with the way the show's writers would honor continuity one minute and jettison it the next. By this point, ANYTHING having to do with the characters prior to the first season can be seen more as an ensemble comedy group in various comedic situations. (like the army story) And references to their childhoods vary, but are saved by the delivery of the lines, ESPECIALLY Tony Randall when describing aspects of his childhood. (while I prefer his previous, perfectly-delivered ""I slept with a sponge"" anecdote about not having stuffed animals, the bit with the cellophane-wrapped teddy bear is touching and funny) What really strikes me about these stories is the ""adult"" aspect of them. These are people who- while not shown- are in and out of physical relationships and ""affairs"" (Felix listing his is a particularly frank highlight for me) and who are not defined solely by one paragraph of character description (unlike many of today's sitcoms). Felix can be remarkably open-minded, enthusiastic and spur-of-the-moment without in any way being inconsistent. Oscar is incredibly believable as being charming and fun to be around despite his sloppiness, limited appetite, gambling weakness, etc.. The redeeming qualities make it believable, to me at least,",1484611200,2,2178,4.96986301369863
