3701217,5,B001MVWM7K,If your kids like the wonder Pets and you don't want cable... get these dvd's. Had about all you would want and plenty to keep the kids from getting bored.,1262995200,3,155,4.2
3701218,5,B001MVWM7K,"Dear viewers,
I'm 22 years old and have been watching the wonder pets almost since the day it first came out on tv. I think the wonder pets is a show for people of all ages. By watching the wonder pets you get to learn a lot about all different kinds of animals,friendship, and the importance of teamwork through the creative minds of 3 classroom pets. If you like animals and singing you should watch the wonder pets at least once and see if you like it. My favorite wonder pet is the leader Linny the guinea pig. Thanks for reading my review i hope you enjoy the wonder pets as much as i do.",1259193600,7,593,4.165217391304348

I like the singing and I love, ""This is se-wious!""  The first song my grandson ever sang was the one about teamwork.  His father is going to be so sorry I found this!

3701235,5,B001MVWM7K,My 19 month old daughter LOVES the Wonder Pets.  We recently downgraded to basic cable so we bought this for her in an effort to satisfy her Wonder Pets withdrawals when we got rid of our digital box.  There are hours upon hours of Wonder Pets episodes in this set so she doesn't get bored.  She's allowed to watch 3 episodes per day so we get several days out of the set before having to do a rerun.,1303776000,,400,4.102564102564102

Overall, the show is great and this set is a great showcase of them!!!!",1302566400,,323,4.4
3701237,5,B001MVWM7K,"This set is wonderful! You have 3 separte DVD's with multiple episodes per DVD, each with their own case.  We love this so we can put one in each vehicle and one to keep at home and then we switch them up.  My two year old never gets tired of the Wonder Pets and these DVDs are an absolute fit stopper!  I highly recommend this produce, it's well worth the price as you get tons of episodes in separate cases.  Note: most of the episodes are ones that appear on the CD soundtrack so my little guys sings along with his favorite songs we hear in the car on the tv.  Great price and super product.  Also, my two year old has played hard with the case that all three come in and it's still in pretty good shape after 2 months.  A must have for a little Wonder Pets fan!",1294185600,6,766,4.033112582781457
