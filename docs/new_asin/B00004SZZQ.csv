7922163,5,B00004SZZQ,"I have been using this video for several years with high school design students. They respond well to it, and it is a good springboard for class discussions. I follow this in the next class period with a slide lecture on Goya's life and the purposes his art served at different stages, including: sports reporting (for example, ""Unfortunate Incident in the First Row""); decorative and practical (the tapestry cartoons); social criticism with Enlightenment values (The Caprices); Political power and criticism (Portrait of King Carlos IV and family); Portraiture--and veiled love note (Duchess of Alba); Propaganda--in a GOOD sense (The Third of May, 1808); a personal thank-you note (Dr. Arietta); psychological self-examination and catharsis (The Black Paintings); even sexual excitation (both the Clothed and Nude Majas).

I believe the students respond better to my slide lecture because they have first gotten to know Goya as a flesh and blood human being through this excellent film. I must have watched it at least twenty times in the last seven years, and can find no significant fault with it.

This year I used it as the beginning of a unit on drawing from observation, and Goya's advice to Rosarita was exactly what I want the students to get: (slightly paraphrased) ""You've drawn what you think a tree is like; you must learn to see, and to draw a tree it as it really is.""

I just wish it was available on DVD!",1175990400,,1422,4.941422594142259
