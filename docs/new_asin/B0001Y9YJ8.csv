2043247,1,B0001Y9YJ8,Selling a dvd in a PAL SYSTEM to the USA is stupid.... Hardly any dvd can play it. So now I have to go to Europe to watch the video.. haha or re sell it on line to an idiot like myself,1371686400,2,184,3.4047619047619047

2043250,5,B0001Y9YJ8,"I am a huge fan of Inspector Clouseau but here Sellers takes on a different character and I laughed out loud through most of it. Admittedly, the ending is a little weak and drawn out but most of the movie is excellent and loads of fun!",1365811200,3,235,4.130434782608695

2043254,5,B0001Y9YJ8,"I saw this movie first long ago with my brother.  Now that my grandchildren are teenagers, I thought they would enjoy watching one of my favorite actors, Peter Sellers, outside of his well-known character in the ""Pink Panther"".  We invited a few of their young friends and played ""The Party"", now in dvd.  They laughed so hard, we actually dedicated a weekend to watching other Peter Sellers' movies.  This Blake Edwards movie is hilarious!  They couldn't have found a better actor to play the part of the not-supposed-to-be-there guest.",1316649600,4,537,4.98876404494382

2043257,1,B0001Y9YJ8,ordered the dvd but didn't realize that it was for different country so can't use it. Should have paid attention to format of dvd when ordering it. Won't make that mistake again.,1400630400,,178,4.59375

2043259,5,B0001Y9YJ8,"Like the movie, it's really good, however there was some kind of reason it wouldn't play on anything , I owned. Must  be that region thing, so I fixed it.

2043261,1,B0001Y9YJ8,"Here I am buying a DVD in the USA and this seller, who lives in the UK, sends me a DVD that is formatted for use in the UK. How the heck am I supposed to watch the movie when it does not work in the US????  Then when I contact the seller, I am told that I should've read the fine print. Go figure!!!!!  I would've returned the DVD in a second but too much hasstle sending overseas. I could not watch the DVD but am out of pocket ~$14.00.  Really sucks!!!!!",1391299200,,456,3.881720430107527

2043263,4,B0001Y9YJ8,"From what I saw of the original on TCM, I wanted to purchase the movie instantly, but sadly I bought the version from Amazon that was ""region 2"" and I am unable to play it on my DVD player.  I really don't know why they sell these movies that are close to impossible to play on American DVD players.  I just rated this a 4 as the movie is very funny.  I really wish there was someplace that I could purchase a ""region 1"" version of this movie without mortgaging my house for the price.",1387065600,,485,4.08421052631579
2043264,5,B0001Y9YJ8,"One of my favourite films, laugh out loud funny, I think of scenes from this movie all the time.

Not enough people in my generation are aware of Peter Seller's genius - he was a one of a kind. Everyone should see this movie and Peter Seller's 'greats'.",1384387200,3,253,4.270833333333333

8018309,4,B0001Y9YJ8,"I saw this movie on TV a few weeks before I ordered it from Amazon. Of you are a Pink Panther fan, this movie is for you. Peter Sellers @ his best!! Instead of bungling thru a murder
Investigation he is scene trying to fit in as an uninvited guest @ a swanky Hollywood party. A must see...",1477612800,,289,4.0
8018310,5,B0001Y9YJ8,"Not politically correct but still just as funny, subtle & laugh out loud moments, in a 1960's piece worth seeing for the clothes and interior design alone.",1444867200,,155,4.777777777777778
8018311,5,B0001Y9YJ8,"It's a bit difficult to grasp the direction of this movie at the start because it evolves into what seems like one of today's ""reality"" shows. The viewer feels as if one is simply moving from room to room, socializing group to socializing group at this out-of-control Hollywood party soaking in whatever hilarious encounter is going on. The viewer feels ""Where should I go next? This is nuts!"" Hrundi Bakshi (Peter Sellers) is, well, his usual comedic genius in the lead role, and his female heartthrob, played by Claudine Longet (who never looked better....for 1968), is irresistible. If you are looking for far-out groovy laughs, then look no further. Sellers is at his best in this blow-your-mind farce about an incompetent Indian actor who wreaks havoc wherever he goes. Seller's films are becoming harder and harder to find, so it would be worthwhile to grab this gem while you can. For those not familiar with Seller's work, this would be a hilarious initiation.

""The Party"" is supposed to be a spoof of a conglomerate of past Hollywood forays and it hits the mark for all 159 minutes.",1431129600,,1092,4.839572192513369
