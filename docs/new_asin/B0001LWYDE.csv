2012793,5,B0001LWYDE,Fast and fun! A quick way to stay in shape. I found it to be effective for cardiovascular and toning,1324598400,6,100,4.05
2012794,5,B0001LWYDE,"I love this tape! I have purchased it 3 times because I wear it out! I wish it  was on DVD. This is a fun tape, easy to follow, with  a warm up, cool down and over 40 minutes of dance routines set to great Broadway tunes. Some of the Simmons tapes are hard to follow, but this one presents patterns that are easy to pick up and perfect with practice. It is one I like to do every day. You really see results from using it, too.",1324512000,3,427,3.840909090909091
2012795,5,B0001LWYDE,The video was in great condition.  It was quick shipping.  No problems.  I definitely would purchase again with the same seller.,1287360000,2,128,5.0
2012796,4,B0001LWYDE,"It's a great workout, and super silly and fun. I have six videos from his ""Oldies"" and ""Broadway"" series, and I like this one because it's a full hour. (It should be pointed out that the other ""Broadway"" videos are much shorter at 20 and 30 minutes.)

Richard has all different types of folks working out with him, so it's nice to see folks at all weights and levels doing it alongside him. Makes you feel a lot less stupid when you can't do one of the steps. It's fun, there's room to develop, and honestly, the hour workout really flies by. I was pleased to see that it's not just a simple ""step and touch"" video - While some of it is easy to pick up, other sections take more time to get the steps down.",1231200000,,706,4.153284671532846
2012797,2,B0001LWYDE,I happen to like the other Broadway tapes from Richard Simmons much better!  I enjoy the music and workout in the others much more.  I really like the Broadway Blast Off and Tone Up on Broadway (uses the  Richard Simmon's chest/arm stretch cord)tapes.  I just did not enjoy this one.,1201737600,,283,4.6
8014214,5,B0001LWYDE,"This workout is so much fun!  I actually WANT to do this workout, instead of just feeling obligated to do it. :)",1521504000,,112,4.090909090909091
8014215,5,B0001LWYDE,"This workout tape got me going because I was bored and needed something to do. I really love Richard Simmons and his line of workout programs. If you are bored and got nothing to work out to, I recommend this workout program for any one even fans of Broadway.",1506643200,,259,4.3061224489795915
8014216,5,B0001LWYDE,I love his exercise videos!,1491436800,,27,4.6
8014217,5,B0001LWYDE,"This is the second time that I purchased this tape. I bought it back years ago when it was new and have no idea what happened to it. I am purchasing again because it was one of only two workouts, (the other being Taebo), that I saw real results from. I love this tape. The routine set to Oklahoma is my favorite. It should arrive to my home tomorrow and I cant wait to get started again.",1470268800,,387,4.038961038961039
8014218,3,B0001LWYDE,"Outside of the fact that the format was VHS, I am enjoying the Richard Simmons:  Broadway Sweat program.",1449878400,,104,4.777777777777778

8014220,3,B0001LWYDE,It's Ok,1415232000,,7,3.0
8014221,5,B0001LWYDE,yes it is fine but do wish he would do a DVD of it,1405987200,,50,2.642857142857143
8014222,5,B0001LWYDE,"This is so much fun! I have just about all of the Richard Simmons workouts and this is my favorite. Unfortunately it's only available on VHS, but it is still worth it -- If you have a VCR and you love Broadway and Richard Simmons, this is a no-brainer purchase.

Richard, please get these transferred to DVD!",1397347200,,308,4.4035087719298245
8014223,5,B0001LWYDE,"Suffice it to say that this is the second copy of this workout that I have purchased...I wore out my first tape after having used it daily for at least four years.  I do regret that it is not available in DVD format.  For anyone who loves Broadway, this is loads of fun.  The routines are not difficult to learn, even for someone like me, a non-dancer who always wanted to be able to dance.  Even after doing it for years, I still find Broadway Sweat to be my favorite of Mr. Simmons' workouts.",1381363200,2,494,4.223404255319149
