727732,5,6303917569,"Out of all the TV shows I've seen, Little House on the Prairie grasps the concept of family values better than any other. Prairie life was obviously hard, but the Ingalls family masterfully tranforms it and uses family love and togetherness to make life on the frontier seem worth living. In this two-episode set, you get two memorable shows: ""Premiere Movie"" and ""Remember Me."" In the premiere show, the Ingalls leave the Big Woods in Wisconsin to make a better life for themselves. They settle on the Indian Territory in Kansas and struggle to triumph over encounters with Indians, fires, births, and new beginnings. An overall effective movie which shows how well these young actors and actresses clicked as the Ingalls family. They set the tone for a wonderful TV series with good, strong actors portraying this extraordinary frontier family.
Of the two shows in this set, ""Remember Me"" is my favorite. In fact, it is one of my favorites in the whole series. It's very heartrending and emotional, but it is absolutely wonderful. Now the Ingalls family is living in the friendly town of Walnut Grove. There, a young widow named Julia finds out that she is going to die. Knowing that her time left to live is very limited, she asks Charles Ingalls to help her find a home for her three children. Julia passes away before this task is completed, leaving Charles responsible for finding these three newly-orphaned children a place to live. As Charles realizes how difficult it is to find a family who will take on all three little ones, he is forced to make one of the most difficult decisions of his life. I won't give away the ending, but I will say that it is a wonderful ending that will leave you in tears.
Don't wait any longer to experience ""Little House on the Prairie"" if you have not already. There is a little something for everyone in it. It's the story of a young, hard-working family with more love than you can ask for. Michael Landon is outstanding and Patricia Neal is incredible as Widow Sanderson in the ""Remember Me"" episode.
""Remember me with smiles and laughter, for that is how I will remember you all. If you can only remember me with tears, then don't remember me at all""--This quote from ""Remember Me"" includes some of the most effective words I have ever seen on television or in life. Sometimes it only takes a few words to say it all, and this is one of those times. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone. Two great episodes with a good, moral message to give. ""Little House"" has a story to tell--a story you don't want to miss hearing.",1021075200,11,2571,4.62800875273523
727733,5,6303917569,"This is the movie that started it all. A young pioneer family heads out of their home in the ""big woods"" not quite knowing what to expect. They settle on the Indian territory, make a home for themselves, and remain close as a family. Despite a few fearful encounters with Indians, wolves, and a fire upon their house, the Ingalls family remains tight in love. They celebrate their first Christmas in the territory, befriend the loving yet gruff Mr. Edwards, and experience many births, both in their hearts and in their horses. If you want to see a good movie on love and persistence, then by all means buy this one.",1009411200,21,616,4.558558558558558
727734,5,6303917569,The chemestry on LHOTP was evident in this first show. Was great to see this classic again. The dvd doesn't have any extras.,998784000,3,124,4.434782608695652
727735,4,6303917569,"I grew up watching the reruns of Little House on the Prairie every day when I got home from kindergarten. My mom taped them, so my family owns 170 of the 200 episodes, from Episode 1, ""Harvest of Friends,"" to the final episode, ""Hello and Goodbye."" Somehow, however, we missed taping ""Premiere,"" so when I bought this DVD, I had never seen it. Well, I was a bit disappointed that in two hours the Ingalls family never reaches Walnut Grove (I was looking forward to seeing introductions of our favorite characters!), but I'm still very glad to own this gem. I know from experience that VHS tapes degrade with time and many viewings, but DVD will last forever. The pilot introduces Mr. Edwards (with a much thinner beard!) as well as the Ingalls family and includes some memorable moments between Pa and Laura. Probably the best scene of all is the classic ""Errand for Santa,"" featuring a snow-caked Victor French who braves a blizzard to get his Christmas gifts to their recipients on time. Overall, a beautiful beginning to an endearing show.",998611200,45,1042,4.730769230769231
727736,5,6303917569,"Great video set.  The first is the orginial movie that started the series and the second is one of the all time great LHP shows.
It is good for families and all the women will cry during the Remember Me video.
I highly recommend it for a good family video evening.

727819,4,6303917569,"Little House - Premiere Movie, 1974 film

The Ingalls' family left the big woods of Wisconsin because of a scarcity of game to hunt. They said goodbye to Laura's grandparents, and sold what they couldn't carry in their wagon. [The Panic of 1873 created another economic depression.] It is cold, they gather wood for cooking. Pa checks the shoes of their horses, Patty and Pat. They cross a wide but shallow river of fast moving water, then make camp. Where is their dog Jack? Charles is looking for a 160-acre homestead. Jack returns. Charles plays the violin at night. [People believed this sound kept wolves away.] Charles sees the land he wants. They work on building a cabin. [No neighbors to help.] Mr. Edwards visits to help out. Is he a church-goer? Their house is built of logs with a canvas roof. Rabbit stew and dumplings for supper. Alone on the prairie?

At night they hear the howl of a wolf. They must build a stable for the horses soon. Carolyn boils lye to make soap. On the way to town Charles is chased by a pack of wolves! He drops his shot rabbits to distract the wolves and escapes. At night they see wolves outside. [No repeating rifle handy.] Pa rides off to hunt for food. Two Indians enter their house and are given gifts by Carolyn. Charles returns and learns what happened. Laura must always obey orders. Charles gets a job herding cattle; money and fresh beef, plus a cow and a calf. They will have milk and butter now. Thick fur on animals foretells a cold winter. Carolyn sees two Indians on horseback outside. Nothing happens. The next day they return; they are Osage. One gives a bear claw amulet to Laura for good luck. The Government will make them move away because of a new Treaty. ""It's not fair"" says Laura. Snow falls outside. Carolyn plucks turkey feathers. Mr. Edwards crosses a stream in winter to arrive at their cabin.

Edwards met Santa Claus in Independence Missouri and brought Christmas presents: a tin cup for each girl, a cookie, and red mittens too. Sweet potatoes are a rare treat. Pa traded rabbit skins in town for a plow and seeds. Smoke on the horizon announces a prairie fire. They throw water on their canvas roof. Fire threatens their cows in the barn. Then the rains come to extinguish the fires. Small animals escaped to the creek. At night they hear drums. Then hoofbeats outside. ""You have nothing to fear"" says one Indian. They ride away. ""It's over."" Charles plows and seeds. Their corn grows tall. Two soldiers ride up and give Charles a notice. Its bad news. They must vacate their land, it belongs to the Indians because of a Treaty. Mr. Edwards helps them load their wagon (he gets the cow and calf which can't be moved). They say goodbye. Laura will never forget him.

This TV movie is the adaption of Laura Ingalls Wilder's ""Little House on the Prairie"", the first in a series of books that tells about life on the frontier in the late 19th century. These books were written for adults but seem to be favored by young adults today. You can learn from these memoirs, which are presented from the viewpoint of a teenager. ""The Long Winter"" had the most serious situations for their family. Fans of the book identified most of the locations mentioned in these books. Some of the people in these books were composite characters or had new names because of privacy and legal concerns. The Ingalls family went from self-employed farmers to wage earners over a few decades. You should read these books to better understand life in those times.",1348704000,,3507,4.615384615384615
