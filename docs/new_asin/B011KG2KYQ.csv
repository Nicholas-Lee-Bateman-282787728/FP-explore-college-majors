7333521,5,B011KG2KYQ,"This is the Bond I grew up with, so these semi-parodies were my first exposure to the world of 007. I have no problem being in the minority, because these movies were escapist FUN. Hey, he must have been doing something right, as producers utilized him for SEVEN films. Roger Moore has perfect wit and impeccable comedic timing, just right for dealing with the absurdity surrounding him. Yes, he plays it for laughs overall. He is, however, able to take it into a dramatic direction when necessary. 'For Your Eyes Only' is far and away the best of the set, being less cartoonish as the others, while retaining the quips and gadgets the franchise had become known for. Yes, he was looking way too old by the time 'A View to a Kill' rolled around, and reportedly wanted to hang up the tux before this one, but was convinced to stay. Hey, money talks.
These films look great on blu-ray, with nice detail and color that appears true to the original prints.",1447718400,22,952,4.540697674418604

7333524,5,B011KG2KYQ,"Roger Moore was the best Bond Ever. Some people say that Daniel Craig is the best Bond, but I beg to differ. Roger Moore had the English accent, all the Gadgets, Cars, Girls, Guns. What else can you say about Roger Moore? He was the only actor that could play 007. Nobody else could came close to Roger Moore. I love all of Roger Moore's movies as Bond. James Bond. Long Live Roger Moore!  Daniel Craig is not that good as James Bond. I have seen all of the James Bond Movies, and my favorite are all the Roger Moore movies.

I plan on buying the rest of the Roger Moore Movies on Blu ray. I wouldn't even waist my money on Daniel Craig's movies.",1509062400,,646,4.16

7333537,4,B011KG2KYQ,"The Roger Moore 007 collection is a four movie set that I got for ten dollars which is an amazing price for four movies.  Moonraker, For Your Eyes Only, Octopussy, and A View To A Kill are the four movies in this Roger Moore Volume two.  As for myself I personally enjoy three out of four Bond movies, I didn't care for Moonraker to me it was a bad plot line but a good performance from Roger Moore and the actor who played Jaws.  The other three movies great car cash scenes, good stunts, and multiple how many times Bond can cheat death from the bad guys, if you like the old school  James Bond movies then pick this set up and enjoy the movies as much as I did watching them well worth the ten dollars.",1467072000,12,705,4.124087591240876

7333550,5,B011KG2KYQ,The blu ray copies are the best way to watch these movies. I debated about if I wanted to upgrade and glad I did. This set is not the best of B007nd but you are gettting four films for the price of one.  Bonus is the uv copies that allow you to watch online.  I am still looking over some of the extras on the disc but they seem a little dry.,1452470400,2,342,3.736111111111111

a comedic edge.",1532131200,,108,3.9545454545454546
8724441,5,B011KG2KYQ,"This set is definitely the way to go to upgrade your Bond films. It has bonus extras as well as a well transferred set of 007 film classics. Roger Moore is not my personal favorite but he did keep the franchise alive through the 70's and  into the 80's. Moore brought a lighter touch to Bond and made him more of a light comedy with  the means and ways of 007 the assassin. There is some really great action in each movie such as the fight with a killer at the concert in Moonraker. Moore has more than his share of great Bond moments which make for great movie watching. The movie in this set are: Moonraker, For Your Eyes Only, Octopussy, and View to a Kill. All now classic Bond with the late Sir Roger Moore makin his stamp on the character.",1530230400,,745,4.2027972027972025
