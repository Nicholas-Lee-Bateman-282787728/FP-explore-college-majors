8383747,5,B002XJDV34,"Lots of people remember the Co-Main Event of UFC 59, when Tito Ortiz first squared off. And many people were pissed off when the split decision was announced that Tito Ortiz took that victory! There were boos all over place. And Tito made the statement, ""I'm Tito Ortiz, and I'm staying here for a long time!"" And he did, until UFC 84 where he lost a unanimous decision to Lyoto Machida. Tito and Dana White didn't like each other too well, until they decided to squash the feud they had. Dana White declared that Tito began his career and needs to end his career in the UFC, and he's welcomed back to face Forrest Griffin in a rematch that needed to happen. That is the Main Event of UFC 106. Will Forrest get redemption, or will Tito take it to the original TUF Winner once again?

And Josh Koscheck and Anthony Johnson are set to go at it as well. Johnson didn't make weight for his last fight, but knocked out Yoshiyuki Yoshida in less than a minute. He has some great highlight reel KO's in the UFC. Josh Koscheck has proved lately that he's more than just a wrestler. He's knocked people out as well, as a well rounded fighter, he's ready for a challenge. Both of these guys want to take each other out!

There's a total of 10 fights on this card. I enjoyed them, and I'll list them below.

Disk 2: Preliminary Fights

George Sotiropoulos vs. Jason Dent: Dent finally got his first UFC win, and looks to continue. But the well rounded Aussie has been on a role himself. This ends with a great submission in the 2nd round!

Caol Uno vs. Fabricio Camoes: A man who has a great ground game taking on a legend who's been in a few wars himself. With an unfortunate point deducted, this contest ends in a MAJORITY DRAW. Better luck next time, fellas. Still a good scrap.

Brock Larson vs. Brian Foster: Larson is always a force to be reckoned with, and Brian Foster hit like a truck, and despite a losing effort in UFC 103, shared FIGHT OF THE NIGHT. This shows one man losing 2 points in the 1st round, and eventually a shocking TKO in the 2nd round is the result. WOW!

Kendall Grove vs. Jake Rosholt: So you can take out Chris Leben? Think you can do the same thing with Da Spyder? A submission in the 1st round answers that question!

Marcus Davis vs. Ben Saunders: Davis still has a chip on his shoulder since getting whooped by Dan Hardy. He probably should've focused a little more on Ben Saunders, who he was fighting that night, and who is dangerous no matter what. This is a 1st round KO that I'm more than happy to watch for a good long while!

Main Card

Amir Sadollah vs. Phil Baroni: Amir got screwed in his last fight, and he's looking make things right. The NEW YORK BAD ASS is anxious to make his return to the UFC, and make a statement of this TUF 7 Winner. A unanimous decision is dominant, and well deserved!

Luiz Cane vs. Antonio Rogerio Nogueira: Welcome to the UFC, Lil Nog! Luiz Cane has fought most of his fights without too many bumps and bruises. But somebody gets KO'd pretty quickly in a little over 2 minutes. WOW!

Paulo Thiago vs. Jacob Volkman: As his nickname suggests, does CHRISTMAS come early for Volkman? Or is Thiago going to take a little gift of his own? A unanimous decision answers that after a great fight!

Josh Koscheck vs. Anthony Johnson: Both came ready to bang, but one came away with a submission in the 2nd round!

Tito Ortiz vs. Forrest Griffin: I think most people were happy in the end. A split decision was once again awarded. But in the end, this time, what goes around, comes around.

I was happy with the rematch. And I was happy with what this DVD offered. ALL pre-fight interviews were included as well. I enjoyed this, and hope you do as well!",1266883200,5,3706,4.366279069767442
