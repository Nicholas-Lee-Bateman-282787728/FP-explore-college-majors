1077688,5,6305814627,"I must say that this is one of the best comedies that I have seen. The personalities portrayed in the film are a perfect mixture for a rather dry, laid back humor. This film also achieves a nice balance between serious scenes and comical ones. Even during the very touching scene when Henry gives his clip board to his daughter, the filmakers are true to his character. He checks a picture frame for dust on his way out.",1019174400,2,420,4.397435897435898
1077689,5,6305814627,"A side-splitting comedy about four mental patients:  Michael Keaton as a habitual liar who has violent tendencies, Christopher Lloyd as an obsessive-compulsive who thinks he runs the hospital, Peter Boyle as a former advertising executive with a messiah complex who likes to take his clothes off, and Stephen Furst as catatonic couch potato.  Against the wishes of the hospital administration, their compassionate doctor takes the four patients to New York City to watch a major league baseball game.  When the van reaches the city, the doctor has to exit the van - with patients still inside - only to witness a murder committed by two corrupt cops.  The doctor is attacked by the cops, leaving him hospitalized and unable to help his patients.  The patients then find themselves framed for the murder.  Now the patients have to not only act ""sane"" to prove their innocence, they also have to save the life of their doctor who is still a target of the two cops.
What makes this movie work is the relationship of the patients.  It is so much fun watching Keaton, Lloyd, and Boyle bicker all the time about the littlest things.  Boyle has a really funny scene in which he leaves the van while Lloyd tries to block him.  Boyle then muscles his way past Lloyd, tells him that He shall have no false gods before Him, and finally he tells Lloyd to get out his way before calling him a seven-letter word.  There might only be so much you can do with a catatonic character, but Furst is quite memorable.  Even though the doctor must have the patience of a saint when dealing with them, he probably has a harder time suppressing a laugh.  Quite simply, this is a movie that gets better every time you watch it.",996969600,33,1702,4.617940199335548
1077690,5,6305814627,"This is one of my all time favorite Modern Comedies. This is a quick  moving inner city adventure. Michael Keaton reminds me of Jim Carrey in  this flick, hes so unpredictable, so ludicrous, that it tickles you with  laughter. The interesting part of this movie is that I can see how close  some people in todays society are not far from being committed to the funny  farm, some just hide it better than others. I think all the characters  mixed well, they didn't play off of each other. Howard Zieff the Director is  a genious, and I would like to thank him and would encourage him to make  more of these type of movies.",962668800,3,621,4.385964912280702
1077691,5,6305814627,"This is the sort of movie you can see a hundred times without getting bored. Four 'lunatics' try to track down their psychiatrist after he has been mugged. Hampered by their own mental problems and a society which is  less than understanding they manage to find him and protect him from two  corrupt policemen. A good script is further enhanced by excellent team-work  from the actors includig Michael Keaton, Christopher Loyd, Stephen Furst  and Peter Boyle. At theend of the movie you truly begin to wonder who is  really crazy: the four nutcases, or the society around them.",952646400,13,577,4.846938775510204

1077816,5,6305814627,We view this classic every year as part of a set worthy to see over and over.  Keaton was at the break out part of his life and did a job worthy of it.  Also the message of the film is timeless:  Things are not always what they seem to be.  Amazon is the perfect place to purchase films of this great stature.,1517184000,,309,3.857142857142857
1077817,5,6305814627,"Has to be one of the funniest takes on behavioral mental dysfunction right up there with What About Bob? (Richard Dreyfus and Bill Murray).

1077818,5,6305814627,"This remains a family favorite. Its almost magical how well and persistently everything works  right down to Dennis Boutsikaris amiable psychiatrist and Lorraine Bracco (New York as all get-out) as Billy Caufield's ex-girlfriend.

Oddly enough, it wasn't that well-regarded on its release, but Ive always found the film charming, Coming off Beetlejuice, Keaton is the ostensible star, and his characters tethered violence gives the story a mild edge (which it badly needs). He gets the cruder gags and he's just as effective as you would expect.

And yet the real treasure here is Christopher Lloyd, who gives a complex, layered performance that is sometimes sad, sometimes carefully annoying but more often very, very funny.

To be sure, there are cliched elements and its going to feel a touch dated in spots  especially toward the end.

But forgive its age. Just give yourself to it for an hour and a half and I think youll have a wonderful time.",1515110400,2,949,4.974683544303797

1078407,1,6305814627,"I don't know why this Michael Keaton film was selected for blu-ray release when so many other better Michael Keaton films are still waiting to be released on to Blu-Ray.

It's hard to find a really good comedy that will stay with you for many years, but as for this film, I was certainly not impressed.

Here we have four psychotics from a mental ward, Michael Keaton, Christopher Lloyd, Peter Boyle, and Stephen Furth, who get the opportunity to leave the hospital for a day to go to a ball game with their trusted mental doctor handling their care, but their doctor that took them to the city actually got hurt, and hauled off away to a hospital and so the mental patients are left alone in their van, somewhere in the midst of New York City.  As a comedy, this could have been great if better situations were written for the story.  But, I still found it rather weak.

Now, Michael Keaton and Peter Boyle worked together in ""Johnny Dangerously"" which is a classic that I'm sure many of us are still waiting for on Blu-ray.  Maybe when Olive Films releases ""Hoodlum"" (which is a more serious film about gangs in the 1930's), maybe then people will want to watch ""Johnny Dangerously"" again, just for some comedy relief.

And then also, Micheal Keaton and Christopher Lloyd worked together in ""Mr. Mom"", which is a great classic comedy that the whole family would love to watch in High Definition Blu-ray. Teri Garr truly steals the show in that movie.  ""Mr. Mom"" is definitely one of the greatest comedy classics ever from the 1980's.

""The Dream Team"" had the potential to be something fabulous, but I was greatly disappointed.

So, like many experimental purchases I have made, this one will end up in ""used Blu-ray"" section of our local Rasputin Records store. This would be one of about 12 copies for sale as ""nearly new"", but selling for about $2.00.",1464652800,,1856,4.613981762917933

1078558,3,6305814627,"After their doctor disappears on them during a trip to Yankee Stadium, a group of mental patients venture out to find him. A promising but uneventful comedy. One thinks he is a Doctor, another is a basket case, one a guy who thinks he is Jesus, and another is a rebellious loner with anger issues. A lot like an 80's TV comedy and a bit of Donahue. What follows is a serial comedy styled in the vein of Saturday Night Live mixed with Dr. Phil. It all leads to a fun filled comedy in which they all overcome their trust issues and learn a lesson. It is funny but misses at crucial moments, and even though it has a feel good feeling, it still is missing something. Not bad but never great, featuring Michael Keaton, Christopher Lloyd, Peter Boyle and Stephen Furst. Could've been a contender.",1448150400,,791,4.424657534246576

Michael Keaton's performance was outstanding, partly because it's the ""juiciest"" a real opportunity to show his many strengths as an actor. I found myself drifting away a few times as the flow of the story began to drag somewhat. I think I would say this is a humorous character study, with a bit of suspense included.

Some of my favorite movie scenes of all time are in this film, and the acting is spot on for each of the characters; I particularly love Christopher Lloyd's character, and he even provides the audience with a really touching scene in counter the non-stop humor.

1079628,1,6305814627,"Part of my decision to go ahead and purchase this ""comedy"" was based on the reviews of 39 people who gave this movie either a 5 or 4 star rating.  How it is that 39 people could give this absolutely stupid movie a five or four star rating is beyond me.  These folks either identify too closely with the characters in the movie or are related to the producers of this inept, implausible, poorly written & acted piece of movie crap.

  The Dream Team is the story of four Trenton, N.J. asylum patients with varying degrees of mental disorders who are treated by their Patch Adams wanabe therapist to a day at the ball park to watch the New York Yankees.  This means driving to Yankee Stadium in the borough of  The Bronx.  The therapist takes a route through the Holland Tunnel into lower Manhattan - yah right, that's the best route to Yankee Stadium from New Jersey.  One patient needs to ""wee wee"" so doc takes him into a lower Manhattan alleyway where our meandering doc witnesses two men commit a murder while our mental patient relieves himself.  Doc is assaulted and seriously injured by one of the bad boys and is rushed off to the hospital.

  Now we have four mental patients wondering the streets of Manhattan.  So now we have a chance to see some funny situations and antics.  What do we get?  We get a pathetic, petty, inept, implausible and sadly immature script that simply falls flat on its face.  The acting is equally pathetic and totally beneath the abilities of the late Peter Boyle.  This is one of those movies that is so bad you keep watching it just to see if there's anyway that it could get better and have a funny ending.  It doesn't!

  Avoid this movie at all cost - unless your intellectual capacity levels off around the third grade.",1248825600,,1762,4.4748427672955975

1079634,5,6305814627,"""The Dream Team"" to me is one of those overlooked classics. The plot of this movie is funny from the start.  A psychiatist takes 4 mental patients on a trip to New York where he gets attacked and they are left on there own.  Micheal Keaton is such a good actor anyway, but the four together play off of each other so well.  It is just a great comedy in the old fashioned way.

1079675,5,6305814627,"In case you have not seen this movie, the line above comes from Ianuzzi, the Phil Rizutto want a be.  Okay, you have four patience coming from the Trenton hospital for the clinically insane who are on a 'field trip' to a Yankee game.

You start off with a few neat surprises at the beginning while they are in the hospital.  Then you get to see them for the first time out of the hospital, driving along the NJ Turnpike, viewing the twin towers.  Billy says:  Hey what the heck, we're already here, let's throw up the other one. claiming he was one of the architects.  The banter back and forth between the patients sounds a lot like lockeroom banter.

When they finally make it to a stop in NY, things get ugly for the Doc and very difficult for them.  Seemingly, the message subtlely being given is that there is very little difference between those who are institutionalized and some on the 'outside.'  Witness the professionals hitting on the waitress in the restauarant, the guys at the bar, Jack getting a witness.  What a hoot, even a man dressed up like a chicken, think about it, it is crazy.

You will get to really like Jack - the religious psychotic, Henry - the clean freak, Ianuzzi - the catatonic and Billy - the one with the tendency toward violence.

Although some may say this is too much poking fun at those with limitations, the story is actually a touching one with a hint of hope.  Here you have four individuals who see that they may, if given a chance, get another shot at life as it could be.

But they don't make it.  Happening upon a crime their counselor is knocked out and taken to the hospital leaving the 4 on their own.  Keaton is a compulsive over aggressive liar.  Peter Boyle believes he is Jesus.  Stephen Furst just watches TV and talks like a sport announcer, when he does talk.

What they really have is english subtitles with a few sounds identified. The subtitles are large, block the screen and jump all over the place. Worst of all, they do not identify who is speaking, making me have to guess who is saying what.

This is a movie about a Group of 4 men that are inpatients at a state hospital that are in the same therapy group.  Their young doctor has been trying to blaze a new trail in their treatment, stopping all of their drugs and doing strickly therapy.  Unfortunatly, its been going slow. As a booster, he has plans to take the group to a Yankees Game on a supervised pass.  And yes, they get aproval.  Unfortunately, the plan didn't go as expected.  The Doctor disappears while taking his patient to find a restroom. Unfortunatley, the patient is a semi-cataonic schizophrenic that only speaks as a TV brodcast or in baseball terms.  He is the only witness to where the doctor went.  So we are left with 4 psych patient in the big city, and no supervision. Well, I don't want to wreck the movie if you haven't seen it, although this was a staple of TBS, WGN and other cable channels, but let say that they stuggle through many different challenges, including police conspiracy and murder charges and some how come out clean.  They all even get to face their past demons and gain theraputic insight as well.  A classic movie, and a unique one as well. Highly recommend this movie.",1155427200,4,1309,4.439330543933054

The comedy is just great, but the leaps of, well, sanity, are the most touching parts of this movie. You pull for the crazies, that's always a bonus. Enjoy a good laugh and tell more people about this movie, so they can enjoy it too.",1143072000,9,631,4.478260869565218

1079797,5,6305814627,"this movie is awesome,but borrowed heavily from one flew over the cuckoos nest. 4 mental patients are taken on an outing and thier doc gets mugeed.they wander about new york for the next few days.the 4 are:michael keaton with a low frustration tolerance-he beats people up a lot over anything,2-the crazy doc from back to the future as guy who is convinced hes a dr. 3-a guy who thinks hes jesus christ and finaly,a chubby little man who only communicates in baseball terminology.children won't understand this but its pretty harmless.it is the second best movie starring mental patients ive ever seen.it is sad in one spot but it goes past quickly.keatons girlfriend is not all that sexy.but i guess you cant be picky when you're an escaped schizo.the guy who acts like a dr is obnoxious with his by the book attitude.michael keaton however does an excellent job in this one.its his best performance.there is a mess up in the film.at the hospital,the real dr has aq cast on a foot of his.later yet,he is helped out of a van with the cast on the other foot.a great film.",1089849600,2,1070,4.666666666666667
1079798,5,6305814627,"This story is a creative, hilarious story about 4 insane men loose in NYC, trying to solve a crime.  They find that they can behave in a relitively sane manner and they learn how to work as a group.  It is extremely funny.  A must see!",1087689600,12,235,4.065217391304348
1079799,5,6305814627,"The Dream Team is just another one of those killer comedies that no one went to see when it was originally released, but has now found a nice following on home video.  I actually saw the film in theaters and thought it was hands down the funniest movie of the year!
First you have a great comedy ensemble who also can play drama just as effectively.  Michael Keaton is Billy Caufield (""I'm an escaped mental patient with a history of violence""), Christopher Lloyd is Henry Sikorsky, an overly organized person (""Why don't we bring this up in group?  Or maybe we should just hug?""), Peter Boyle is Jack McDermott who has a Messiah complex  (""Arise and walk, my son""), & Stephen Furst is Albert Ianuzzi, who only speaks in TV ads and baseball jargon (""Nobody doesn't like Sara Lee"").
If you don't already know by now, these guys are four mental patients, whose doctor, played by Dennis Boutsikaris (""One more afternoon in the rec room and I'm gonna have to go on Thorazine myself""), decides to take them to a baseball game in New York.  Only things don't go as planned, as the good doctor ends up getting knocked unconscious and whisked away to a hospital, leaving his patients all alone on the streets of New York City.  And the comedy ensues!  As the gang tries to figure out a way to find their doctor, they end up finding ""themselves"" in the process.  Add Lorraine Bracco (of ""Goodfellas"" and ""The Sopranos"" fame) as Keaton's girlfriend (""So am I walking home with an escaped mental patient or what?"") and you know you're set to have a good time.
What makes the film memorable is that it has the perfect blend of laugh outloud humor (""We're a special combat unit with the United States Marine Corps and we've been tracking some Libyan terrorists.  In fact I think we've got 'em trailed to a bagel shop around the corner."") combined with some tender dramatic moments, that work together seamlessly.
The DVD is your typical standard DVD.  No extras, other than the original theatrical trailer.  Happily the film is presented in Anamorphic Widescreen in its original aspect ratio of 1.85:1, which looks pretty good.  A little dark in some spots, but not too much to complain about.

So if you're looking for a comedy that's full of great laughs as well as a good story with some dramatic moments thrown in for good measure, pick up The Dream Team today.  It's the sanest choice to make!
The Dream Team - a very funny movie.
Henry - ""We're directly under the Hudson River now"".
Billy - ""Yeah.  You guys see those tiles up there, all those individual tiles?  Doc, isn't true that if even one of those tiles were to come loose, like millions and millions of gallons of water would come pouring down on us and crush us like tiny little bugs?  (pauses) Is that a leak up there?  You see those tiles?  They're leakin' water!  Oh, my God!""
Jack - ""I will hold back the waters"".
Billy - ""Thanks, Jack"".",1078617600,43,2893,4.55899419729207

1079801,5,6305814627,"This movie is hilarious.  Michael Keaton, Peter Boyle, and Christopher Lloyd all give career comedy perfomances.  The whole idea of four totally crazy psychiatric patients roaming the streets of New York looking for their doctor is great.  Michael Keaton is perfect as the leader of the group who's view of reality is way off.  Peter Boyle is great as the former executive Jesus Christ messiah.  Christopher Lloyd's character (the patient who thinks he's a doctor) adds the perfect spice to the movie to make a great two hour film.  I can't wait until the DVD comes out.",1036454400,7,570,4.824742268041237
