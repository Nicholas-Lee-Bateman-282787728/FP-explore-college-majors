8111749,4,B000ENWSXA,"God Help Me is an awesome movie. You need to watch this DVD if you want to experience a very refreshing time of laughter and learning. Why is this a refreshing movie? Simple! There isn't any foul language, sex scenes, or violence. In addition to the lack of immorality, the movie contained a great comedy/satire plot. God Help Me will keep you laughing as it teaches a very important lesson in life. I highly recommend it to everyone, well, everyone who has a sense of humor!",1148342400,,475,4.534883720930233
