8415181,3,B0043QQHJU,"Good performances to have in 7.1 sound, but on my system it sounds a bit bright and lacking low end. My 7.1 Denon and Energy speaker set up has been tuned to perfection (to my ears) and as a comparison to this B-R, I played Abbado's Mahler 1 on EuroArts and that sound is full and has no issue in the low end.  Anyone else?  This is my second Dimension of Sound Blu-Ray and I thought the same of the other recording bright with little low end.",1295654400,,443,4.080459770114943
