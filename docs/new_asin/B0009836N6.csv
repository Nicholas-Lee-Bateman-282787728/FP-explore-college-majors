There are a lot of inner stories and you must remember who is who or you'll get lost & lose interest. The pace begins sluggish but does picks up. Dialogue was pleasantly well written; ensemble cast seemed to work well together. Honorable mention for actress, Mitch Roberson, (a star is on the rise) -- she has flavor & passion of the likes of Vanessa L. Williams & Alfre Woodward. Writer `Alix Jean-Francious' founder of Black Phoenix Rising Productions has true heart and I commend him for following his passion. Kudos to: Director David Wright who came into the project after another director left. He did a very fine job with what he was given.  Though, it has been over a year since I've seen this film, the title & film score are the only things that stick out in my mind. Much success: to all who participated on the project.

Stay Driven & to quote the Compton Rapper,""Game""... Dream!

Sincerely,

MARLENA MARTIN/CEO of SUPERNOVA FILMS [...]

At first the story starts out kind of all over the place and is a little hard to follow the myriad of characters, but midway through it really picks up and the intensity of the director shines bright.  I truly enjoyed this film.  If you are looking for a nice little rainy day flick to watch at home, i'd suggest this.",1112832000,,401,4.32
