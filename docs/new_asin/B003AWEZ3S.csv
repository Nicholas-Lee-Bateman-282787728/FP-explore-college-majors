4104753,2,B003AWEZ3S,The two movies are the same even though the covers are different.  We were disappointed as were our sons when we gave them each a movie.  One had a snowplow on the front and the other has a snowmobile.  It was disheartening.,1291248000,13,224,4.285714285714286
4104754,5,B003AWEZ3S,"This video is perfect for my 3 year old son! He loves watching how they clear snow from the streets and where it goes afterward. The commentary is not only entertaining but also educational! He is into big trucks or any big vehicle so the sections on the ski hill and the forest are fun, too!",1290643200,,292,4.232142857142857
4104755,5,B003AWEZ3S,I bought this for my 3 yr. old grandson in another state and my daughter says he just loves it.  He is very interested in large machinery and how they work.  He asks to watch it everyday.  It works for me.,1289952000,,205,3.951219512195122

4104764,5,B003AWEZ3S,"I bought this for my 6 year old son.  He was very excited  to see that it was from, ""Mighty  Machines "" , he loves watching and learning about  trucks  and heavy machinery. I love to listen  when he ""teaches "" me how  certain trucks or heavy machinery  work and what they were  intended for. I  would recommend this to anyone  who has a  love of trucks!",1423267200,,353,4.104477611940299

4104767,3,B003AWEZ3S,"We have several of the Mighty Machines series, but this one is the least interesting.  My 6 year old watches the other ones over and over, but just can't seem to get into this one.  I guess watching plows clear the streets and sidewalks on tv just isn't that interesting when you live in an area where you see it outside all winter long.",1420243200,,337,4.25
4104768,5,B003AWEZ3S,Amazing for my son he loves them,1419897600,,32,3.7142857142857144
4104769,5,B003AWEZ3S,My grandson LOVES this. He likes the songs and watching the trucks. He has his favorites. He watches it in the car on a portable DVD player. I can probably sing the songs too. ( He just turned 4- care to wager how many times I've heard them in a couple of weeks -  LOL  ),1419033600,,271,3.8214285714285716
4104770,5,B003AWEZ3S,"My son lovvveesssss Might Machines!!! He has almost every edition. These are very educational and also great for young boys (or girls) who love machines- trucks, planes, autos, etc.",1418774400,,181,5.275862068965517

4104772,5,B003AWEZ3S,My boys love it!,1405123200,,16,3.25
4104773,5,B003AWEZ3S,"He hasn't seen a MM DVD that he doesn't like yet, but he especially loves this one. Living in Florida he has never seen real snow, so the Winter Blast MM keeps him entertained. He would sit and watch it for hours if I let him. And he will sing the song even when he isn't watching it.",1402876800,,284,3.913793103448276

4104776,5,B003AWEZ3S,"I bought this video for my eight year old nephew to watch when he came to visit.  He is enamored with trucks of all shapes, sizes, and functions.  He sat and watched all three episodes on the disc without stopping and then asked to see it again.  Each episode shows the mighty machines that are used in different situations.  I must admit that I never realized there are so many different mighty machines.  I learned quite a bit.  It's well worth the price!",1392336000,,457,4.445783132530121
4104777,5,B003AWEZ3S,Hours and hours of great entertainment and vehicle education for my 4 year-old grandson.  I definitely recommend this pack for any child.,1391126400,,137,5.2272727272727275
4104778,4,B003AWEZ3S,"My young son has loved the 'Lights and Ladders' edition of the MM DVDs, and since he always loves to see the snow plows around town, we thought this would be a good addition.

Overall, that has been the case. The snow-clearing episode is good and informative, though a little more repetitious than it needs to be - some parts of the snow-removal process are heavily emphasized (that is, shown repeatedly without any real change) while others are rushed through a bit. Still a good and interesting one.

The second episode, about ski hills/resorts, is a good one as well. Pretty interesting to see all that goes into maintaining those slopes and half-pipes. Also some time spent on the lifts, including the enclosed cars and open-air seats. Some of the voiceovers get pretty silly in this one, but the imagery is good.

The third segment is about logging. Not my preferred choice for my son's entertainment, but the MM makers seem to do everything well.

One thing I really like about this is how obviously Canadian it is - all of the MM episodes we've seen so far are clearly Canadian in setting and in delivery, which means free of the excessive, pandering goofiness of most American kids' shows, and edited at a gentle, patient pace - so no five-cuts-per-second with blaring hyperactive music and constantly-tilting camera angles. They allow you to take in what you're seeing, and they focus your interest on what's actually happening, instead of doing cartwheels to try to make it entertaining for you. In other words, they assume you're interested in the topic, and they present the topic as though it is inherently interesting. This is one quality that I love about these videos. So, American parents - think of these more as classic PBS shows than the junk you see on commercial TV.",1388707200,6,1788,4.776699029126213
4104779,5,B003AWEZ3S,The children love it. They like anything outdoor and messy on my shirt like earth movers. I would definitelly recommmend this for children.,1363219200,,139,5.086956521739131
4104780,5,B003AWEZ3S,"First of all, you can't beat the price. Second of all, my 20-month old LOVES the Mighty Machine series, and he absorbs so much for them. My husband and I even find ourselves watching too, and actually enjoying them! I've learned quite a bit. Educational and fun when you need a break from Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. :)",1362614400,,315,4.543859649122807
4104781,5,B003AWEZ3S,"Purchased for my nephew and he loves the DVD.  The purchase came quickly and communication excellent.

4104786,5,B003AWEZ3S,"My boys are mesmorized by this video.  I had bought a few other videos from John Deere and some other Mighty Machines.  This one is by far their favorite.  The snow storm bit is their favorite hands down.  I highly recommend this.  Between the bobcats, tractors, snow blowers and dump trucks, this one has it all.",1340064000,,313,4.517857142857143
4104787,5,B003AWEZ3S,"My son is a huge fan of the Mighty Machines series.  We'd purchased two of the 4-packs for the cross-country move in the car.  Now that we are settled in, we looked for a few more to mix it up a bit for him; this particular disc has three episodes on it. Anyone in the 4 and under set that is fascinated by trucks, tractors and other vehicles will enjoy the Mighty Machines shows.",1336435200,,380,4.121621621621622

4104789,5,B003AWEZ3S,"My three-year-old LOVES this video and asks for it more often than most of the others in the series. He has the 4 dvd super pack along with the train, mega machines and machines on the job videos.  He saw this video in the video rental machine at our supermarket but it was never available, so I purchased it along with three others for his birthday.  He was so excited!  He can watch these videos over and over if I'd let him.  The best part is that they are educational, not just total action.",1300924800,,495,4.23404255319149
4104790,5,B003AWEZ3S,"Both my boys 3 & 6 have been huge fans of the Mighty Machines series but this is one of their favorites.  Satisfies the snowplow addict in your family.  Note:  They also love TRAIN YARD, LIGHTS & LADDERS, DIGGERS & DOZERS & TREMENDOUS TOOLS.  Also check out the ""ALL ABOUT-BIG MACHINES"" series.",1298505600,,294,4.596153846153846
4104791,5,B003AWEZ3S,"My 3 1/2 year old son, who loves all trucks, and things with wheels, just loves this series.  We got winter blast for Christmas along with a logging truck.  Awesome.  We can all sing the opening song.",1295308800,,200,4.351351351351352
4104792,4,B003AWEZ3S,"I am slowly collecting this whole series for my toddler grandson.  It is his battle cry every morning, ""Trucks!""  We live in Maine so he actually gets to see the trucks featured in the Winter Blast.

As the adult, I find the cutesy voices of the vehicles annoying.  But, it's not a video for me.",1294876800,7,295,4.3090909090909095
4104793,5,B003AWEZ3S,My son loves videos like this where he can see real people and trucks in action.  This one does not dissapoint.

4104794,5,B003AWEZ3S,"Our boys LOVE all the Mighty Machines DVD's and this one is no different!

4104795,2,B003AWEZ3S,This is the exact same movie as the 2008 version with the snowmobiler on the front.  Just with a new cover.  Confusing and misleading if you already have the older one.,1291248000,21,168,4.387096774193548
