This could end up becoming a cult classic film to Indie music fans or American foreign film enthusiasts.",1333238400,,264,4.888888888888889
8478562,5,B005LTDXPO,"I thought this movie was amazing for what it is. Its an art film - a low budget art film; so you have to go into it with a certain mind frame. Its almost therapeutic to watch and has a dreamy pace with great music. I am a fan of french new wave cinema and this movie delivers something to audiences that most Hollywood-Obsessed America misses. You won't find spoon feeding and a by-the-books plot, but you will actually have to use your imagination and hunt for its grand theme. It is a theme which is often overlooked in our everyday lives, but lurks in every corner of this well directed film.

The characters are quirky and at times and the acting a bit amateur, but while watching I couldn't help but be brought back to my Sgt. Peppers days when a good joint and a piece of art or LP would remind me what is truly ground breaking and what is just a big commercial.

If you want to see a unique film made by real filmmakers that are not driven by the whip of commercialism and advertising money, this is the real deal! I am so glad to find that truly original indie films are still being made. If you want 10 million dollar, studio packaged movies falsely labeled as ""indie"" films, go watch Sundance fodder.",1325721600,,1210,4.302631578947368
8478563,1,B005LTDXPO,"Kiosk rental is the graveyard filler for many movies that couldn't make it anywhere else. Cast of three with no previous acting experience supported by very brief half dozen others with zero experience in their resumes. No subtitles with poor audio and enunciation making it difficult to follow the dialogue. Not that it mattered since lines seldom exceeded five words with interminably long pauses between each line as if people were either reading an off screen teleprompter or couldn't memorize beyond five words. Lines consists of lots of pop science terms like ""equation""; space time; dark matter and energy - latter ideas not present in the 60s.

Setting and props consists of a contemporary rural home filled with 60s era science equipment e.g. ohmmeter, oscilloscope, circuit boards, cathode tube monitor. Computers gave off beeping sounds as lines of code scrolled resembling 60s B grade scifi. Add cheap prop of flasks & beakers filled with colored water; lots of yellow cable and tubes running in and around the house that do nothing but look yellow. Intent was to represent electronic monitoring and hydroponic feeding of plants & trees. Lots of scenes of an oscilloscope test signal - means nothing, but looks cool. The hooking of a single alligator clip between plant root and ohmmeter doesn't work. Bizarrely, a Swarovski glass prop ball was added so that 90s era popular feng shui and qi would add a mystical element. Fits with the lawn pyramids.

Storyline had something to do with two psuedo-scientists who find a girl sitting in the woods who claims to telepathically communicate with space beings so they hire her to sew burlap bags for their plants? We briefly, thank goodness, see her anti-science boyfriend who likes to cut the yellow cables and disrupt science. Final scene is of a really bad Photoshop style CGI of floating white sphere covering girl supported by plastic covering the lens. Girl and scientist ride off on their bicycles.

Final thought, bad script and a storyline that made no sense and equally bad acting and equally bad props but it has a nice photo on the DVD cover - caught me!",1325116800,2,2123,4.9411764705882355
