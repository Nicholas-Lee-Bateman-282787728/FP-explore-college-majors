1990431,2,B0001DA4RK,"A racist, dreadful, artless piece of crap. Van Dyke is banal, and hapless, but we expect nothing more. However the portrayal of natives and ignorant, gibberish slurring savages is disgusting. It's one of the worst movies i've ever seen.",1434412800,,236,5.076923076923077
1990432,5,B0001DA4RK,Saw it when I was a kid and it was just as funny as an adult.,1434240000,,61,2.875
1990433,4,B0001DA4RK,"are you an admirer of Dick Van Dyke, but a bigger fan of some of his works than others? do you, for instance, relish the unprecedented suburban sophistication of The Dick Van Dyke Show - still hands-down the greatest ""real life"" sitcom in television history - but cringe to think of his slushier cinematic efforts, like Mary Poppins and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang? (personally, i quite liked everything else about Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, but the diabetes inducing musical numbers killed my enthusiasm.) if you're looking for amicable middle-ground, seek no farther than Lt. Robin Crusoe U.S.N. for my money, this is the all-time most underrated Walt Disney production.
it's a fitting as well as charming showcase for both Disney's amicable brand of good-natured fun and Van Dyke's agile ""everyman"" slapstick. it admittedly borrows only the basics from it's literary blueprint, but that's all it needs. Robinson Crusoe, like Moby Dick or Romeo & Juliet, is one of those books that somehow conjures a feeling for us even if we haven't read 'em.
the protagonist was named Robinson by a father who yearned but never managed to go to sea. (""why couldn't Dad've named me Dwight or Lyndon""?) a navy pilot forced to evacuate his overheated jet, he manages to find a vacant but habitable island and undertakes the rigors of self-sufficiency. (one wonders if the popularity of Gilligan's Island had something to do with the film's existence. maybe ""Uncle Walt"" should've done a movie starring Bob Denver as a tv comedy writer to even things out.) along the way he befriends a similarly lost ""astro-chimp"" and Nancy Kwan, who becomes his ""girl Wednesday."" ultimately he must confront her dictatorial father, the Chief, and bring Woman's Lib to the tribe.
it's a semi-bummer that such Van Dyke Show cronies as Rose Marie and Morey Amsterdam couldn't make it, but we do at least get a delightful cameo by (the voice of) Richard Deacon. his early narration for Crusoe's survival-at-sea manual gleefully reflects the button-down pomposity Deacon had flaunted as Alan Brady's brother-in-law/producer. Van Dyke's muffling of the obsequious instructor's narrative by burying the manual in damp sand is a rebut worthy of Buddy Sorrell.
only one thing about it particularly bugs me, in fact downright pisses me off: the sight the famously left-handed Van Dyke writing with the other hand. the same thing frequently happens on his sitcom, even though his left-handedness was a punchline more than once. for decades my fellow lefties were forced to use the wrong hand on film, and i realize there are activities where it's practical to resist one's southpawness, such as fencing. but the fact is, 99.99% of it was sheer bigotry!! when it comes to as mundane an activity as writing, how is this any different from telling Denzel Washington that he can't have a part unless he bleaches his skin?
another oddity is the credit ""story by Retlaw Yensid."" the joke is that it's Uncle Walt's name backwards, only it's not quite. technically, the mirror image of ""Walter Disney"" would be ""Yensid Retlaw."" if there's one thing more perplexing than why they didn't go all the way, it would be why i've seen others attempting the same gag making the same mistake. oh, well.
like any movie fanatic, i've been asked once or twice if i had any ""guilty pleasures."" to be honest, i'm not sure i grasp the concept. i mean, you just sort of turn out to be whatever it is you are, y'know? you can't really choose your taste in movies anymore than you can your singing voice or how tall you are. so if a friend doesn't care for one of your favorites, well, there's certainly letdown potential, but it's not really anybody's fault. (unless you wanna blame God or Nature.) so as i interpret it, what you're being asked to feel guilty about is pretty much being who you are.
and anyway, i tend to favor the other extreme. faced with the denigration of something i enjoyed (and sometimes the praise of something i couldn't stand), i'm more the righteous indignation type. (again, not really quite fair in light of the nobody's-fault syndrome, but i haven't quite convinced my gut yet.)
still, i have gotten some idea what whoever's in charge wants to make us feel guilty about enjoying. from what i've gleaned i get the feeling that some would say Lt. Robin Crusoe U.S.N. should be listed as one of mine (if i had any), but i refute the very idea. maybe it's not particularly profound or revolutionary, but it's charming and fun, so who the hell cares? i repeat, it's a sterling (however prosaic) example of both Walt Disney and Dick Van Dyke doing what they did best.",1433980800,2,4619,4.825977301387137

He finds a wreck of a old Japanese submarine and then finds Floyd, one of our early space chimps that was never recovered.

Comes to that, he might just as well have left his name off as a redundancy (considering it was his studio after all).  At any rate, it's odd that Mr. Disney would seek story credit in the first place when clearly the plot was taken from Daniel Defoe's novel.

I saw this movie in 1966 when it was first released.  Decades have passed since then and yet I still recall much of it with great fondness.  Love the NASA astrochimp Floyd (Dinky), the real star of this movie.

1990598,5,B0001DA4RK,"I saw this movie, currently rated G, when in first came out back in the days when we kids went alone and safely to the movies for 50 cent matinees on Saturdays.  I also read the book later.  It's a funny movie with a socio-political message for women's liberation, back in the 1960s when women's rights often meant the right to go to college to become a nurse, a secretary, or a school teacher.

This movie is clean.  Even the ""violence"" has no blood.  We let our baby watch the DVD!  The language is clean.  There's no ""real"" offensive violence, sex in any form, attacks on religion, foul language, or any of the other junk pushed by modern Hollywood.  There's fighting, yes, but think Three Stooges, not Terminator.

SPOILER ALERT: Now for what happens.  Stop here if you want it to be a complete surprise.

The movie, like the book, starts out in medias res, or at least something very close to that.  Dick van Dyke is writing his fiance from sick bay on a Navy ship.  Going back chronologically, van Dyke, an engaged Navy pilot, finds himself marooned after his jet catches fire, stuck on an uninhabited South Pacific Island.  His companions include an astrochimp named Floyd, who, although quite intelligent, nearly killed the marooned pilot at their first meeting.  They're soon joined by a strong-willed young lady from a different island, sent there by her polygamous match-making throw-them-to-the-sharks chief-father to die for the crime of refusing a marriage he arranged for her.  Survival and trick-them ""weaponry"" are aided by the finding of a grounded Japanese submarine left over from WWII with lots of workable gear--""a Japanese supermarket"", exclaims Crusoe.  A bevy of young island ladies soon joins them, sisters and cousins of the girl sent to die.  Battle plans are drawn to take on the inevitable clash when the chief, the girl's father, comes with his contingent to see if she's still alive.

There are enough bloopers to fill a page.  Islanders have to speak English for an audience too young to read subtitles.  And there are blond jokes here as these dark-haired ""native"" girls learn what explosives and the like can do.  The message of the movie is that women have rights, and can choose their mates.  Ironically, the movie makes these young ladies out to be a bunch of, dare we say, dumb girls?  These are real Pacific islanders used in the filming, no doubt, not the dark-haired whites used for Indians in modern westerns,  and these Islanders are clothed well enough for an audience of children in the 1960s.

The movie is all comedy.  The ending is a surprise, but before that, we see the inevitable battle scene, a lovers triangle (again, nothing any kid couldn't view) as the young island lady starts falling in love with this engaged man, and enough Dick van Dyke comedy to keep the movie, like Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, from getting boring, even after several viewings.  And of course there's the fact that the Navy is more interested in the chimp than the pilot, a fact brought out at the beginning of the movie and even more clearly at the beginning of the book and at the end of the movie.",1353283200,2,3127,4.719557195571956

1990613,5,B0001DA4RK,"Another Disney all-time favorite. And interestingly, before the DVD and download streaming release became available, was a pricing favorite among video extortionists - with copies selling for ridiculous amounts. I can recall dupes of this film, as little as five years ago, going for as much as $75 on the gray market. Dupes, not even original tapes.

If you doubt what I say, try looking up the theatrical version of Disney's 'Dr. Syn Alias The Scarecrow' with Patrick McGoohan and see what you find.

In this production, the always enjoyable and elastic Dick Van Dyke plays Lt. Robinson Crusoe, naval aviator. Amusingly, he mentions his own discouragement with his dad, a city bus driver in Cleveland, having named him after so infamous a character of fiction.

And sure enough, having tempted fate, Lt. Crusoe suffers a massive engine failure during a patrol flight in the far western Pacific. He's going down hundreds of miles away from his home carrier. Mind you, this was the 1960s - there was no such thing as GPS or a satellite that would be capable of searching the open seas. Pilots overflying open water had to best guess their positions, if they even had a chance to do so, before bailing out. Open water recovery was a crapshoot at best and the Navy lost many aviators who went down that way in real life.

But this is Disney. And Lt. Crusoe is headed for a year-long adventure that includes a derelict Japanese submarine, a lost space chimp, wisecracking myna bird, a tribe of wacky headhunters, and a bevy of beautiful women who have just discovered female independence.

And speaking of women. I can't imagine a sexier 'Friday' than played by Nancy Kwan as Wednesday. Wow, she was quite something back then.

The usual Disney hijinks (gotta love that ridiculous bamboo sextant) and typical fun-house plot interweaving with Van Dyke's amazing timing and self-deprecating humor produced an incredibly funny and infinitely enjoyable film.

Let me tell you about Amazon's Instant Video.

I did the download and watch it while it downloaded. Then I watch it again for about a dozen times. The picture was digital quality and in letterbox. So I decided to go ahead and buy the DVD. The reviews about it were true. The full screen version that Disney released for sale looks like a poor, grainly quality VHS transfer to DVD.

I can't understand why they can offer something so nice under Instant Video for rent and this piece of crap for sale.

Lt. Robin Crusoe, USN was the film I remember seeing in the theater and wondering who that funny man was.  This was before I had seen reruns of the Dick Van Dyke Show.  Now, decades later, I have come to see that Dick was indeed a very funny man and his physical humor is what drives his most successful projects.
Seeing Robin Crusoe be stranded on an island and adapting over time to it is funny and still stands up almost 45 years later.  Enjoy!",1294617600,,755,4.251748251748252

Where to list all the things wrong with this? It is a cheaply made, cheesy, limp, insulting, vaguely racist and stupid film, with so many qualities lacking and so few going for it. And though my grandson pronounced it good, he barely laughed. Dick Van Dyke's bumbling and stumbling got tiring in about 3 minutes. Could this knucklehead have been a Navy pilot? I sure hope not!

VanDyke plays a naval aviator who bails out over the South Pacific after an engine fire. He goes into survival mode on a deserted island. He is aided by an abandoned WWII Japanese sub which serves as his ""Wal Mart"", a marooned chimpanzee who found the same island after a space shot and an Island girl fleeing her tyrannical, head hunting father. The film is full of Rube Goldberg type gadgets to make life easier and the sub is always handy to provide for every need. The fight against the head hunters is lame and the hero does not get or want the girl but treats her badly. She doesn't take it too well either. The chimp is the only decent character.

Watching it after so many years was wonderful and I found myself laughing aloud once again. The DVD does not have any special features, but don't let that stop you from trying it out.

1990700,3,B0001DA4RK,"When I was a little girl, my father (whom I don't know well) told me on the phone that he was in this movie. He said to me: I met Walt Disney when he was filming Lt. Robinson Crusoe, U.S.N. and he asked me to do a small bit for the opening of the film. See, apparently my father was one of the sailors on the naval air carrier that they film a small bit of the movie on. I'm not sure of the real reason for Walt Disney's decision to use my father, but, my dad proclaimed that the reason was this: They're both short men. My father can't be more than 5 ft 4.

At any rate the scene is one where Dick Van Dyke and the monkey are landing on the carrier and the sailors are all lined up at attention. One sailor is gaping, open mouthed like a fish at the scene. My father is the one who elbows him, to make him stand back at attention.

But it wasn't because of this personal bit from a family member which made me like this film, it is the amusement factor. Dick Van Dyke is a funny guy, and this film is a bunch of laughs. I'm disappointed that there is no widescreen format or digital restoration or anything like that, but I may buy this film anyhow due to the fact that my father plays a tiny bit part in it.",1122336000,4,1209,3.9306122448979592
1990701,5,B0001DA4RK,"I recalled seeing this movie during Saturday afternoon showings at the post theater.  As I was a military brat and this film had a military bend, I was hooked; and it has remained one of my most favorite children's movies ever since.  Now my 4 and 2-year-old daughters are enjoying it immensely and it has become their favorite movie to watch with dad.  In fact, this is the first movie my oldest will watch from start to finish without asking me to skip or repeat a scene over and over again.  She'd just rather watch the whole movie over and over again.  As her some of her other favorites are ""Mary Poppins"" and ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,"" it seems Dick Van Dyke's ability to mesmerize children is timeless.",1116806400,6,709,4.5078125
1990702,2,B0001DA4RK,"It's been a long time since I've seen this film, and I remember it to be an engaging slapstick farce with Dick Van Dyke in top form as the title character, a descendant of the original Robinson Crusoe who, while on training mission, crash-lands on a tropical island.  He must fend for himself while awaiting rescue, with only fellow castaway Floyd the astrochimp and a native girl he names Wednesday to keep him company.  It's a funny and fast-paced lark, and very typical of '60's Disney product.

Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this version of the film for purchase at this time.  Here are five reasons why:

1.  Like ""Million Dollar Duck"" and ""Barefoot Executive"", ""Lt. Robin Crusoe, U.S.N."" is being released to DVD in a lazy, fullscreen version instead of the family-friendly 1:66:1 aspect ratio it was originally filmed in.  As a film purist, I simply refuse to buy anything that isn't presented in the format it was originally filmed in.  That Disney is dumping old films on DVD in the old fullscreen VHS format shows a total lack of respect for the filmmakers and the consumer alike.

2.  I see no indication on the packaging that this film has been digitally restored.  Therefore, I must conclude the DVD contains the same tired old print of the film that was originally released on VHS.  Even more galling is the fact that the sound hasn't been upgraded to stereo, but according to the packaging is presented in ""mono.""  I ask consumers everywhere:  why bother replacing old VHS films with DVDs that are of no better quality than what you already have?

3.  There are absolutely no extras presented with this film.  No ""making of"" documentary, no commentary with Mr. Van Dyke, no original theatrical trailer, nothing.  That Disney released this film with no extras makes the lack of a widescreen print even more annoying, since there is more than enough room on a DVD to present both fullscreen and widescreen versions of the film.  Other companies, especially MGM/UA, do it all this time.  Why can't Disney?  It's simple:  laziness and lack of respect for the consumer.

4.  This DVD is ridiculously expensive, expecially at the original retail price of $19.95, which is a full $10 more than most bare-bones DVDs are priced by other companies.  Disney has always been known for gouging its fans at the cash register, but this is ridiculous.

5.  1+2+3+4=ONE BIG RIPOFF.  Once again, Disney rips-off its consumers, and they'll continue to laugh all the way to the bank unless we take a stand.  Therefore, I ask fans everywhere:

BOYCOTT ANY DISNEY DVD THAT IS NOT RESTORED AND PRESENTED IN WIDESCREEN FORMAT.  That's the only way we'll ever get through to these greedy corporate pinheads.

1990705,4,B0001DA4RK,"We've been waiting for a long time for this one to hit. If you've never seen it, and you like either the classic Disney movies or Dick Van Dyke, you'll like this one. I saw this as a 6 year old at the drive in, and got a lousy recording years ago on VHS off of the TV. My kids watch this again and again even though it's ""old fashioned"".

Funny, clean, smart, and thoroughly enjoyable. I truly think this would be a Disney classic on par with more famous flicks if only they would have changed the ending.

I've contacted Disney in the past and their response was always the same, ""This movie doen't have a demand enough to be released so SORRY"". Trust me , this movie is so much funnier than those stupid Love Bug movies.",1111708800,2,412,4.098765432098766
1990707,5,B0001DA4RK,"I've been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD so I can replace my well-worn VHS copy.  I used to watch this film a lot as a teenager because I've always had an interest in ""deserted south pacific islands"" (""Gilligan's Island"" was one of my favourite childhood shows, I loved ""Swiss Family Robinson"", I dreamed of visiting Tahiti and Fiji when a 4th grade teacher spoke about such islands existing, and a part of me still fantasizes about the Peace Corps).

This film is a Disney classic which still holds up well today.  I'm not sure if savvy modern-day children will like this kind of film, but I imagine they will.  The humor is timeless and Dick Van Dyke is the sort of actor that children gravitate to (perhaps ""the Mary Poppins effect"").  I like this retelling of the ""Robinson Crusoe"" story, modernizing it and adding much humor as well.  The chimp as sidekick is great.

My favorite part of the movie is when Lt Crusoe meets the island ladies and they speak pidgin to comedic effect (like using ""cow-cow"").  There were so many lines in this film that my sister and I loved to quote to one another, such as ""Kabuna say 'women got rights!'""  Just the word ""Kabuna"" sounds funny when you say it.  I love how Lt Crusoe plays with the natives' superstitious belief in idols, by making Kabuna (an Easter Island looking tiki rock carving that the island natives worship) speak with a booming voice.  Ah, to be stranded on an island full of beautiful native women!  This film is kind of a parody about the women's liberation movement, as Lt Crusoe changes the women to be less submissive and more independent, which has an unintended consequence for him...as they chase after him and he's still dreaming about his girl in the U.S.

This one is a classic and will definitely be a part of my collection.  I could watch it over and over and still laugh myself silly.  Unfortunately, Disney doesn't make movies like this anymore, but I hope they won't even attempt to remake it (as they did with other classics like ""The Parent Trap"" and ""Freaky Friday"").  This one is timeless and a perfect Disney comedy of the bygone era.",1109289600,64,2125,4.567282321899736
