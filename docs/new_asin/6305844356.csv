I only bought it for Lorenzo Lamas, but he didn't do any martial arts, plays a nerdy printer who goes through much angst with his father's accident. He gets involved in a nefarious deal knowing he's getting ripped off. Why not go to the cops? No, he's got to do it all himself. Dumb ending. Thanks.",1496793600,,371,4.23943661971831
