7992316,5,B00009PJPX,"This storyline only runs thirteen episodes.  I wish there had been a second season. I wonder what problems Macus ran into dealing with Serge.  Who were they going to fight. The virus was supposed to be dead.

 I liked this one.  It had enough elements to track to keep me wondering at the end of the show.  I like shows I can't figure out all the details before the end of the show.",1209686400,,382,4.164383561643835
7992317,3,B00009PJPX,"I have watched volumes one through three now.  It wasn't that it was a poor story.  To the contrary, it was fair.  The character design was good and quite provocative.  The Mecha design was fairly routine.  The backgrounds were good.  All in all, the anime was quite good.

I guess what turned me off was the horrible dubbing of the voices.  It reminded me of old martial arts movies from China.  But not funny.  The dubbing was so bad, I don't think there was any effort by the script author to match words to mouth movements of the characters.  For me it ruined the continuity.  I found myself paying more attention to how far off the adr was than the story by the third volume.

If adr script writing and engineering is not important to to you in an anime series, then you may enjoy this one.  I might suggest that you may like ""Tokyo Warriors"" also.",1195516800,,853,4.350318471337579
