7830085,1,6302641772,"The film was not comical at all. The aging Laurel and Hardy are not funny and the script is predictable. You see this happening with so many aging comic stars, they are not funny as they get older. The timing is no longer there and what use to be amusing now looks silly. I found it difficult to watch this film and yearned for the younger Laurel and Hardy films.",1386460800,,363,4.2
7830086,5,6302641772,"Some books and movies from WWII haven't aged too well, not because they weren't good, but rather because the material or humor is so topical, and doesn't make a modern audience laugh or relate because they weren't there and can never understand these jokes, get subtle references, or just understand the frame of mind in which this was made and with which audiences of the time came to it.  There's no doubt this film was made during and about WWII, but even though a lot of the situations and jokes are the products of the specific time, they're quite funny and easy to understand.  Perhaps it's not quite as technically fine-tuned or tailor-made just for them as earlier movie masterpieces like 'A Chump at Oxford' and 'Pack Up Your Troubles' were, but there are a lot of funny moments in this.  It seems like so many people have said L&H's post-1940 films are unfunny/embarrassing/pathetic/etc. that people begin to believe it and never question it.  Yes, they're lacking that special magic that was present at Hal Roach Studios, but that doesn't take away from the fact that they were still quite funny and always did a great job with the material.  Some of the funniest moments include when they're ""helping"" pretend-victim Edgar Kennedy (wonderful to see him playing their slow burn foil again!), when they go into the city hall to receive their assignments, and when they're in Mr. Kennedy's house later on and get into a scuffle with him (the scuffle that leads them to be dismissed as air raid wardens).  I also immensely enjoyed the subplot about the Nazi spies who were planning to blow up the factory, and how the boys had to alert the townspeople somehow, even though they'd been dismissed as air raid wardens, and save the day in the end.  Sure it smacks of having been made during WWII, but I love books and movies about WWII.

Still, there are little things in this movie that make my rating more like a 4.5 than a full 5, like how dumb Stan and Ollie are made out to be.  They've always been kinda dumb, and that's a large part of their appeal, but they were dumb in a sweet endearing way, like two overgrown little kids who didn't know any better, not dumb as in practically borderline retarded.  One of the jokes is supposed to be Stan struggling to write the four letters of his name on his air raid warden ID card; this is WAY stupider than they're supposed to be, and almost cruel to laugh over, like being asked to laugh at someone who's retarded and barely able to write one's name.  Ollie even says at one point, ""I guess we're not smart like other people.""  I'd strongly recommend this as one of their best post-1940 features and for someone who's into WWII, but not for someone who isn't familiar with the boys already.",1122768000,4,2746,4.581632653061225
7830087,3,6302641772,"I have seen all of Laurel & Hardy's short subjects in the 1930s. I have all seen nearly every single one of their feature films except for two; ""A Haunting-We-Will-Go"" and ""Jitterbugs"". Of their later efforts in the 40s I have always enjoyed them despite public opinion. ""Nothing But Trouble"", ""The Bullfighters"", the sadly condemned ""Utopia"" have all pleased me. But here with ""Air Raid Wardens"" I think ""the boys"" are working with the best material they had only for the first time I am able to say, I don't think the chemistry between the team was as strong as usual is and the film's pacing seems awkward.

 If ""Air Raid Wardens"" has been made merely five years earlier I think this could have much better.

 When I watch the later Laurel & Hardy films I miss certain things that were no longer available after they left Hal Roach. I miss the music, the supporting players were perfectly cast, even they had good chemistry with ""the boys"" the little touches really worked.

 After Hal Roach though we would never hear their famous theme song. I can't remember Hardy giving Stanley his famous, ""Well, here's another nice mess you've gotten me into"" line.

 But here with ""Air Raid Wardens"" it seemed the team was going to make up for things. The beginning is entertaining. Check out the town hall meeting with the dog. Their entrance reminded me of ""Sons of the Desert"" (When they walk in late) and the bit with the dog made me think of ""Laughing Gravy"".

 I also like their ""rescue"" seen where they have a fake victim they are suppose to help and end up turning him into a real victim.

 The film does make one mistake though. It presents Laurel & Hardy as simple-minded and ""the boys"" themselves acknowledge that. Never have Laurel & Hardy felt sorry for themselves. Even if everyone goes against them they always fought back.

 And although it's not really a mistake the plot is a little too light. There's not much there, but that can be forgiven. Here's the team that made a comedy masterpiece out of the simple idea of carrying a piano up stairs. None of their films were heavy on plot.

 Say what you will about Laurel & Hardy's later work, but I enjoy them, and ""Air Raid Wardens"" might have been their best of the decade.

 Bottom-line: Much better Laurel & Hardy film of the 40s, perehaps their best material after leaving Hal Roach. Has its problems but the film does its best to overcome them.",1093046400,2,2408,4.573426573426573
7830088,3,6302641772,"Laurel & Hardy down on their luck and bumbling failures throughout this entire film until they finally are able to prove themselves worthy by thwarting a plot to destroy their towns most valuable war asset.  Although the movie does not feature the popular background music we are used to in the previous Laurel & Hardy features and has a way too large Hardy they still have great timing and provide laughs.  Not nearly as bad as the horrific to watch ""Atoll K(Utopia)"" in which their timing was horrible and they both looked incredibly unhealthy.  This one was a pleasant watch.  I think the kids would enjoy this.",1071878400,,614,4.710280373831775
7830089,3,6302641772,Laurel & Hardy towards the end of their moviemaking days.  This is a so-so effort.  Not as funny as previous efforts and lacking the background music that fans were so accustomed to in earlier movies.  Oliver Hardy looks rather unhealthy...in the past he was quite heavy but at this point you could say he was a little too heavy.  Although the comedy team seemed to have good timing in this one as opposed to their final comedy Atoll K(Utopia) in which was just a horror to watch.  This is basically an entire movie about Stan & Ollie's failures until they stumble upon a secret Nazi headquarters and help thwart an effort to destroy the towns most valuable war asset.  It isn't great but it's not terrible either...the kids probably would get some laughs out of it.,1071878400,,766,4.595588235294118
7830090,3,6302641772,"In this 1943 feature film directed by Edward Sedwick, Laurel & Hardy are air raid wardens who foil a Nazi plot to sabotage a plant involved in the war effort.  Although ""Air Raid Wardens"" was made for the boys' old studio MGM with a couple of their old writers working on the script, the humor is pretty much old hat.  This film is perhaps a shade better than their previous efforts for Fox.  The story is that real Civil Defense workers serving as advisors on the film insisted any gags that made their real world counterparts look bad had to be taken out.  That is as good an explanation as any for what we have here.",990489600,3,619,4.310344827586207
7830091,1,6302641772,"Most L & H fans know that the boys made a long series of MGM/FOX pictures which reflected the big studio ""assembly line"" film-making approach and the wartime atmosphere. Students of film comedy  understand how the ""traditional"" Stan & Ollie would be  somewhat suppressed in that regard. However, it's very sad to watch a  decent premise with great performers go COMPLETELY to waste, as it does in  AAW - the presence of Edgar Kennedy should lift th proceedings; instead it  reinforces the melancholia. I found the drunken scene most distasteful.  Still, L & H followers might want to place it somewhere on their video  carousel for an occasional peep into what could have been.",958780800,4,677,4.885964912280702
7830092,2,6302641772,"Some comedies come to life with an audience. ""Air Raid Wardens"" is a real ""audience"" picture, with Stan and Ollie bumbling their way through air-raid duty, first-aid practice, and spy-catching. As usual  with Laurel & Hardy, you can see the jokes coming. Audiences loved this  underrated film in '43. It's got some good scenes, but you'll either admire  or hate the ""sad"" episodes where the boys have to play it  straight.",923443200,2,422,4.901408450704225
