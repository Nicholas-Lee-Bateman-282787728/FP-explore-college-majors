1986122,5,B0001BKBGQ,"Season 4 begins with MacLeod returning to his Scottish Highland roots after he discovers that someone has been digging up the graves in his ""hometown"". He faces the Immortal who killed his adoptive father and finally kills him (when they first met, MacLeod didn't know that he had to behead fellow Immortals to kill them for good). He also meets Rachel MacLeod, a ""relative"" (MacLeod is not biologically related to his clan) who initiates a brief romance with him before realizing that living with MacLeod means putting yourself in harm's way most of the time.
Season 4 ends with The Watchers putting Joe Dawson on trial for ""crossing the line"". He took an oath to observe and not to interfere with what the Immortals were doing. However, his close friendship with MacLeod has apparently led to the deaths of many Watchers, and a new war seems to be brewing...
The video transfers for Season 4 are very, very good. The transfers are clean and free of scratches,
The Dolby Digital 5.1 English re-mixes, audio tracks are well-done for the most part
The subwoofer is constantly booming or pumping, and there's an enjoyably wide spread across the rear sound field.
Each episode's original stereo mix can be selected (encoded as DD 2.0 stereo English tracks). Optional English closed captions support the audio.
Each episode comes with its own selection of extras. Clicking on the ""slate"" icon will access brief video interviews with various behind-the-scenes personnel who offer anecdotes about the production. Clicking on the ""Watcher"" icon will access ""The Watcher Chronicles""--text pages of biographical and historical information (as well as trivia notes) about each episode's Mortals, Immortals, swords, and the Watchers themselves. Some episodes also have a ""reel"" icon that accesses footage from rehearsals as well as bloopers.
Several episodes have audio and video commentaries. The commentaries feature various cast and crew members
There is a stills gallery on Disc 1. Disc 8 also has about twenty minutes of bonus footage for ""Deliverance"".
BUY SEASON 4 NOW ITS WORTH THE MONEY.",1081209600,6,2085,5.135294117647059
1986123,4,B0001BKBGQ,"Season Four is a terrific place to start if you have never seen the Highlander series before or if you are only familiar with the movies. Each episode is self contained and can be watched in any order.  For fans there are a lot of old faces and for newbies those characters are well introduced using flashbacks, which this show does masterfully.  Definitely worth checking out but, don't blame me if you get addicted.",1081123200,,417,4.621621621621622
1986124,5,B0001BKBGQ,"The Highlander TV Show debuted well over a decade ago, and since then it has been embraced by fans across the world.  The audience views the wicked world of Immortals through the eyes of Duncan MacLeod, who is played by Adrian Paul.  Many of us have read stories about mortal and Immortal in schools, but never really contemplated on the issue of life vs. death and staying vs. continuing.  These are the themes depicted in Highlander and they are what caught my attention when I first started watching the show.
Season 4 once again builds upon these themes and uses the concepts to develop the characters even more.  One of my favorite episodes has to be ""Promise"" because it is filled with action, passion, and emotion.  The story line is basically about Duncan having made a promise back in 1755 in order to save the life of a young friend named Kassim.  However, that promise takes a tragic turn when Kassim asks Duncan to assassinate the amazingly cruel dictator ruling in a part of Mid East.  Ironically, Duncan denies that request and carries on with his own missions.  Later, it would appear clear that he made a mistake as Rachel's life is put in danger and Duncan is faced with a difficult decision.  He has to decide to whether honor his promise or do what he believes is right.  Now, don't we all go through that in our lives?
Season 4 DVDs contain all these great episodes:
Disc 1:  ""Homeland"" + ""Brothers in Arms"" + ""The Innocent""
Disc 2:  ""Leader of the Pack"" + ""Double Eagle"" + ""Reunion""
Disc 3:  ""The Colonel"" + ""Reluctant Heroes"" + ""The Wrath of Kali""

Audio and Video commentaries featuring various cast and crew members.  Like many Behind-the-Scenes, you will get a chance to see the real making of the show.
Beautiful Gallery of Season 4.
Bonus footage for Deliverance.
Trivia game and so much more!!!
Overall, this season was exciting because of all the evolutions in the plot and characters.  I recommend anyone fans of the show or interested audience to explore this DVD Box Set and I'm sure you will not be disappointed.",1081123200,2,2412,4.684085510688836
1986125,5,B0001BKBGQ,"Season four of Highlander is one of the best seasons television has ever had. This show was so well written, and the acting is right on par with the scripts.

1986127,5,B0001BKBGQ,"This is more or less the best season of Highlander. This is the only season that really compares to the quality of the first film. Nearly every episode in this season is great. This season begins in Scotland as Duncan attempts to bury a old relic that was stolen from his village and it (the season) ends in a exciting episode where Jim Dawson is captured and nearly killed by the watchers council. This season (unlike the previous seasons) takes place primarily in Europe and it (the season) is filmed in beautiful locations in England, Scotland and France. Duncan is finally given some interesting stories and we finally get to see his dark side after he briefly becomes evil in the two-part episode that takes him to Europe for the rest of the season. Methos is also given some better stories and we see him start to form a deeper bond with Duncan. We also get a resolution to the whole Duncan/Charlie storyline as we learn how Joe Dawson lost his legs. You will see the best episodes in the series if you buy this DVD set.",1075248000,36,1026,4.491978609625669
1986128,5,B0001BKBGQ,"Highlander is a wonderful series and season 4 is one of my favorites. Adrian Paul is magnificent as always but really puts in one of his best performances aa the Evil Duncan MacLeod.
Homeland is the first episode that was also directed by Adrian Paul and is set amongst the magnificent scenery of the Highlands of Scotland and shows what a great talent Adrian has not only as an actor but as a director.
Methos is also featured in several episodes along with Joe Dawson, with Amanda also making an appearence there is something for everyone.
Highlander is a great fantasy concept with lots of action and romance. I would recommend this series to anyone who likes action, fantasy and a little romance.",1036195200,,700,4.699186991869919

MacLeod renovates a house for a very special purpose.  Amanda and Methos make a few appearances throughout the season.  Duncan has a ""dark"" quickening and turns evil and nearly kills Richie.

I thought back in the 90s when I was watching Highlander ""certainly looks like he has real world training, that it's not all just choreographed"" when I read about the training Adrian has had I decided I have gotta see if I can own the series. I have stayed up & got very little sleep because I can't stop watching. Takes  me back... but it's amazing how the passing of time affects how you remember things. Its been awesome to revisit the series. Better yet, I own it. Now if I could buy that incredible sword. And get the series on Blu-ray would be even better. Thanks Adrian.

Also, if you haven't watched the Christopher Lambert films, you are usually left wondering, why must there be only one?

I am not happy.  I am sure they do this because many people would pay to watch the rest of the shows...not me I can't afford to buy 2 1/2 season worth of shows.

1986161,4,B0001BKBGQ,"This show is one of my favorites!  Although I do not usually watch fantasy shows, I enjoy this one.  The characters are real, if flawed, and  each episode is laced with humor.  The actors are not hard to look at either!!

Essentially, there is little graphic violence.  Thankfully, buildings don't blow up and I don't recall a single car chase.  If these characteristics are not unique, I don't know what is!  Intelligent writing perhaps?  Yes, I think so.",1407196800,,456,4.743589743589744

1986166,5,B0001BKBGQ,"Another great season of sword fighting and highlander mythology here.  For big fans it is no spoiler to say that the show jumps the shark before it ends. But that shouldn't deter anyone from diving straight into this season where you get full on action and great storytelling.  Duncon MacLeod is at his finest. His personal history is drawn out and the audience can relive his loves and his battles and the endless agony of an existence that just won't quit.

Episode 1: ""Homeland"" - The episode was the only one that was filmed in the highlands of Scotland. He returns to the grave of his first love, meets the immortal who killed his (adopted) father and tries to put together the pieces of his earliest days on Earth. For fans of Highlander lore, it will be a can't miss episode.
Episode 2: ""Brothers in Arms"" - Charlie DeSalvor returns.  Dawson was a young soldier in Vietnam when he lost his legs and re-found a purpose in life as a watcher.  MacLeod is forced to choose loyalty between two friends and it does not end well for anyone. It is a dark episode that lets the audience into the pain of a man who must watch everyone he knows die sooner or later.
Episode 3: ""The Innocent"" - Immortality is hard enough for Mac and Richie.  They were fortunate enough to be born with a good head on their shoulders.  But the introduction of a mentally retarded immortal teaches Richie a hard lesson about the pain and the great burden of living forever. Another dark episode that makes the viewer happy to be mortal.
Episode 4: ""Leader of the Pack"" - The Dogs of War were sent loose centuries ago but now MacLeod is about to turn the tables on Kanis, an Immortal whose Rottweilers hunt his opponents.  this is a bad guy of the week episode but a worthy one.  The bad guy is bad. The good guy is Mac.  They fight and ... not to spoil it but it isn't the last episode.
Episode 5: ""Double Eagle"" - Amanda is back. She is hot. (Actually, of all the people President Clinton slept with, she is easily the hottest.) And there are some immortals that want to chop her head off.  Kit O' Brady, a decent fellow has an old gambling grudge against her and plans to collect.
Episode 6: ""Reunion"" - That f-ing brat Kenny is back and Mac is quite comfortable to take his head but Kenny is being chased by a bad guy that MacLeod left on a deserted island alone without food or water for a hundred years.  After a century of waking up, starving to death and waking up again (due to failure to learn to fish???) Kenny's chaser realizes he can get revenge on Mac. It is another great story about ""Who wants to live forever?""
Episode 7: ""The Colonel"" -  After WW1 Mac testified that an immortal was insane. He was.  But he spent the next 70 years in nut houses in England and never quite forgave Mac. There is some good Watcher story here too.
Episode 8: ""Reluctant Heroes"" -Queen Anne made Mac swear an oath that Mac would not seek revenge on a man in her court.  He swore not to do so as long as she lived.  But she is no longer alive.  The othe guy is.
Episode 9: ""The Wrath of Kali"" - India is an interesting country.  They have immortals.  Richie sort of falls under the spell of a preacher type-dude from India, Kamir. Basically, the one fault with this episode/season/series is the failure to develop Richie.  The show is called ""Highlander,"" so I get it but had this show aired 10 years later the minor characters would have been fully developed, complicated and central to the story. We can't make the series go back in time and get some Buffy, Lost or Walking Dead type writing.  But this episode makes it obvious that this is a 90's show and not a 21st century series.
Episode 10: ""Chivalry"" - Methos is in the new world.  Allegedly he is here to protect Richie from a naughty immortal girl but maybe he just wants to get back in the game after a few centuries on the sideline.
Episode 11: ""Timeless"" - Mac dressed up like a girl.
Episode 12: ""The Blitz"" -  That chick that Mac bedded between a bunch of other chicks, Anne Lindsey got caught in a collapsed subway. The London blitz was another cool time in his life where he banged a chick who died in a subway /  bomb shelter.
Episode 13: ""Something Wicked"" - Living forever is not a prize. It basically sucks. Probably the worst would be to be a fetus who gets the coat hanger then just keeps being reborn as a pre-viable fetus.  But something else that would suck is being born as an immortal that can take the evil out of the world.  After a while it just overwhelms you....
Episode 14: ""Deliverance"" - ... then Duncon takes your head and becomes evil.
Episode 15: ""Promises"" - Muslim people have been killing each other for centuries (or so I hear on Fox News).  This time Macleod is all messed up in it.
Episode 16: ""Methuselah's Gift"" - Methos has lived for 5000 years. Not messing with Amanda had greatly aided his life span. But now Amanda's pendant might be able to save Methos' mortal girlfriend.
Episode 17: ""The Immortal Cimoli"" - This is a bad guy of the week episode.  there are clowns and jugglers and Amanda and someone loses a head.
Episode 18: ""Through a Glass, Darkly"" - MacLeod aided and defended Bonnie Prince Charlie who tried to unite Scotland.  But it didn't end well, nevertheless there is an immortal out there who thinks it could have ended better.
Episode 19 - ""Double Jeapordy"" -Xavier St. Cloud is back, if only in memory. So is that bond haired fluzey from season one or tow or whatever, who you forgot about. Anyway Mac must protect her from some one and maybe toss her around for a few romps in the sack.
Episode 20 - ""Till Death"" -Methos is clearly not the best choice for a marriage counselor. He was married 68 times to mortals because he knew better than to commit to an immortal.
Episode 21 - ""Judgment Day"" - OK.  This is where s*** gets real.  Dawson is called to Paris by the wathcers because Mac is dead-dead.  It pretty much gets worse from there.
Episode 22 - ""One Minute to Midnight"" - Well not quite dead-dead. But Horton's mess is outliving Horton and watchers are killing immortals.

I didn't see any of the extras. Basically, Netflix dropped Highlander in June 2014 but it is still on Amazon. So I watched the rest.  It is a cool show and I highly recommend it.",1405641600,,6250,4.387348353552859

1986187,5,B0001BKBGQ,My wife and I used to watch Highlander when it was on TV in the 1990's. We loved watching it then and still enjoy it today. It's a nice mixture of fantasy and sci-fi. There's always new characters being introduced each episode  which adds something new and different and keeps you coming back for more. A very good show from a different era in television.,1360454400,,355,4.461538461538462
1986188,5,B0001BKBGQ,"Highlander is one of those shows that has a profound influence on the viewer's character and outlook on life even thoughin the endit is just a show. Season 4 starts off with one of the most beautifully shot episodes of the series (although the dialogue is a bit too...well, it's a bit off), entitled 'Homeland,' which was directed by the Highlander himself, Adrian Paul.

As typical with multiple season shows, the middle seasons (primarily 3 and 4, but also part of 2...and maybe part of 5) are the best of the bunch. The first season, the show is trying to find it's feet and build it's audiencebut still incredibly good. Then by 3, it's off and running. And by 4, it's in a full-on sprint. One of the things that has always impressed me the most with Highlander is the damned near perfect consistency and continuity of Duncan MacLeod's back story. Season 4 does not disappoint in this tradition.

I highly recommend season 4, but then again...I recommend the whole show and I would urge you to start at the beginning and work your way through the WHOLE series. It is completely worth it!",1360454400,,1090,4.61340206185567

1986194,5,B0001BKBGQ,"The quality of the Box Set is outstanding, the Bonus Material provided is great. I ordered the Box from Germany via Expedited Intl. Shipping, delivery time was aprox. 3 Weeks due to tax procedures.

If you are willing to spend a little bit more money i suggest you buy this one and not the EU Version (=non anchor bay Boxes). The EU Version sucks hardcore and is by no way a match for this Box.

There is less Bonus Stuff,.... less Box quality,..... just less everything, but instead you get Stereo Sound a horrible DVD Menu and hey they even included mastering errors !! (If thats not bonus i don't know what bonus stuff is !!)

So do yourself a favour and buy this one..... and do not forget that you need a ""yank compatible"" DVD Player ;).

It has a few stand out episodes like The Wrath of Kali and Chivalry, but it is mostly good because of where it allows the show to go in season five. It is a middle season and it is in the middle. The character Duncan is finally over the death of his latest love but not yet sick of the show as he becomes in season six. If you like the show it's worth owning.",1199232000,,421,3.8505747126436782

1986199,5,B0001BKBGQ,"This DVD set is excellent value. Overall the stories are clever, literate and thrilling with two of them Homeland and Through a Glass Darkly being set in Scotland. The latter a reworking of the Rashomon idea - the same event seen in a totally different way by eyewitnesses - is cleverly done with an interesting portrayal of a not so Bonnie Prince Charlie as he was later to become, a drunken, incapable sot. Homeland is my favourite Highlander story and is to me what the myth is all about - nobility, honour, tradition, loyalty. It is excellent and the fact that Adrian Paul directed it and much of it was filmed in Scotland just makes it more enjoyable. The insights from the cast and others are informative, funny and interesting. Suprisingly David Abramowitz, the story editor for the series is rather uncomplimentary about both these episodes and all the commentators on the Homeland episode seemed to have missed the significance of the raven in the Viking connection to the tale. Watch it for yourself and see what you think. All in all this disc set is superb and a must for any Highlander fan.",1153699200,,1103,4.690721649484536
1986200,5,B0001BKBGQ,"It is great to finally watch the fourth season again,and for the very first time watch them in English and with Eurominutes both. I have been a Highlander Fan since the first (and only acceptable) movie 1985, and I was a fan of the series since it came to German in 1993 (I think). But I always could only see it in German dubbing. Until now. And the fourth season is the best one - dramatically, and for the quality of the show. The fifth is a close runner-up, because it has unforgettable episodes like Comes a Horseman, Revelations and Forgive Us Our Tresspasses; but the overall development of Duncan in the fourth Season is breathtaking to watch again, and than there are episodes like Timeless, Something Wicked and Deliverance, with a breathtaking Dark Duncan MacLeod who seems still a bit too harmless to be really an irredeemable bad guy, but also shows all the necessary Horseman-material. And in the end: Judgement Day! With it's first thrilling hints about hos it would look if it ever came to war between watchers and Immortals! WOW!

I loved this season when I watched it in TV, and now I love to see it on Video again. It has much depth and is a fascinating explore of the Highlander universe. Great stuff!!!

Highest Recommendation",1085961600,53,6040,5.018090452261307
1986203,5,B0001BKBGQ,"By its fourth season, Highlander was a worldwide phenomenon.  This season picks up where season three left off and improves the show even more, going back to the season two feel where nothing is as it should be, and yet everything is fate.
Yeah.  Whatever.
THE SERIES
Highlander season four includes some of the best episodes in the entire show, including two directed by Adrian Paul, the excellent ""Homeland"" and the wonderfully mysterious ""Methuselah's Gift"".  It also includes the two-part Methos episodes, ""Chivalry"", and what is arguably the greatest episode of the show, ""Timeless"" (easily my favorite).
This season features more violence, sex (including some Adrian Paul rear nudity for you ladies), and is much more grim than the other seasons.  All in all, though, it's one of the best and most important seasons in the show.  [9/10]
THE VIDEO
Season four has some nice video, although in ""Homeland"" some grain is very apparent and the picture is quite dark.  All the episodes are, once again, presented in their original full frame format.  [8/10]
THE AUDIO
Season four has the same problems as the other seasons as far as audio goes.  The remixes sound great, but at many times the music is blaring (although during the opening sequence, I can't say this is bad).  It would be nice if Anchor Bay could fix this problem.  [9/10]
THE EXTRAS
Highlander season four, like the previous two seasons, is loaded with special features.  Watcher Chronicles, interviews, some neat deleted scenes and even some bloopers.  There's enough here to keep any Highlander fan entertained for months.  Outstanding.  [10/10]
Overall, Highlander season four is another great Anchor Bay DVD.  They have no rival, no company can be their equal, take me to the future of their work ...

1986204,5,B0001BKBGQ,"Highlander Season 4 contains many episodes that fans should not miss.  It has a great deal of extra DVD features and that is what makes this collection special.  There are a total of 22 episodes on eight discs and each one is action-packed.  The audio commentaries from cast and crew are the highlight of the bonus features because they really take you behind-the-scenes of the story and its production.  It is always interesting to hear what the cast and crew have to say.
This season is one centered around identity formation and the ultimate facing of death.  The friendship between Joe and MacLeod is very interesting too and it certainly put a great twist to the plot.  As far as how the story developed, you will have to buy the DVD and find out then.  All I have to say is that this season was more than I expected and it is a perfect lead up to season 5!!!",1083283200,,864,4.39622641509434

1986206,5,B0001BKBGQ,"The Highlander TV Show debuted well over a decade ago, and since then it has been embraced by fans across the world.  The audience views the wicked world of Immortals through the eyes of Duncan MacLeod, who is played by Adrian Paul.  Many of us have read stories about mortal and Immortal in schools, but never really contemplated on the issue of life vs. death and staying vs. continuing.  These are the themes depicted in Highlander and they are what caught my attention when I first started watching the show.
Season 4 once again builds upon these themes and uses the concepts to develop the characters even more.  One of my favorite episodes has to be ""Promise"" because it is filled with action, passion, and emotion.  The story line is basically about Duncan having made a promise back in 1755 in order to save the life of a young friend named Kassim.  However, that promise takes a tragic turn when Kassim asks Duncan to assassinate the amazingly cruel dictator ruling in a part of Mid East.  Ironically, Duncan denies that request and carries on with his own missions.  Later, it would appear clear that he made a mistake as Rachel's life is put in danger and Duncan is faced with a difficult decision.  He has to decide to whether honor his promise or do what he believes is right.  Now, don't we all go through that in our lives?
Season 4 DVDs contain all these great episodes:
Disc 1:  ""Homeland"" + ""Brothers in Arms"" + ""The Innocent""
Disc 2:  ""Leader of the Pack"" + ""Double Eagle"" + ""Reunion""
Disc 3:  ""The Colonel"" + ""Reluctant Heroes"" + ""The Wrath of Kali""
Disc 4:  ""Chivalry"" + ""Timeless"" + ""The Blitz""
Disc 5:  ""Something Wicked"" + ""Deliverance"" + ""Promises""
Disc 6:  ""Methuselah's Gift"" + ""The Immortal Cimoli"" + ""Through a Glass, Darkly""
Disc 7:  ""Double Jeopardy"" + ""Til Death"" + ""Judgement Day""
Disc 8:  ""One Minute to Midnight""
The Box Set includes some awesome bonus features and they add so much to this collection:
Audio and Video commentaries featuring various cast and crew members.  Like many Behind-the-Scenes, you will get a chance to see the real making of the show.
Beautiful Gallery of Season 4.
