3005333,5,B000XRZO1K,Its Terry Jones what more can be said.,1417737600,,38,3.875
3005334,5,B000XRZO1K,"Terry takes history and makes it personal. We get an insight as to real history and the common people from various times. After watching tarry in the different personas of the common folk, you can see that that must have been the way it was.

He covers such items as Ancient Inventions that were reinvented in our time, The Surprising History of Sex & Love including objects you will want to get your hands on, The Hidden History of Egypt which rivals The Surprising History of Sex & Love, and The Hidden History of Rome. In The Hidden History of Rome I think Terry did not like those folks much.

Any way it is hard not to be surprised once or twice. You may also long for the good old times.",1412726400,,693,4.282442748091603
3005335,5,B000XRZO1K,"I think I have watched this 5 or more times. It's very informative, entertaining and engrossing. and while I bought it for the humor I knew terry Jones would bring to it, I learned so much of the lives of real people.",1375747200,,217,4.190476190476191
3005336,4,B000XRZO1K,Not my favorite Terry Jones special but still worth a watch.  Don't get me wrong in this multi part series a couple of them are good while i believe it was the first one that was excellent...,1366588800,,191,4.162162162162162
3005337,4,B000XRZO1K,"Be aware that ""The Terry Jones Collection"" is also being sold as ""The Ancient World according to Terry Jones"". It has a completely different name for the DVD and a completely different cover.  I was fooled into believing that these were 2 different DVD's.  Unfortunately I had already bought ""The Ancient World according to Terry Jones"". Then, instead of sending me ""The Terry Jones Collection"", as I had ordered, Amazon sent me  another copy of ""The Ancient World according to Terry Jones"".  Because of this I have to rate the contents of this disc 4 stars and rate Amazon's clarity of presentation 1 star.",1324339200,6,607,4.8076923076923075

3005339,5,B000XRZO1K,I first found out about Terry Jones and his history films when I saw his film on the Crusades. Frankly that was an excellent piece of work. As it was funny and packed full of interesting facts that were well presented. This collection is in the same league. I especially like his series on Ancient Egypt and the life of the average Egyptians. Ditto for the series on the Romans. As I do not want to give away too much but I found this series to be very refreshing & informative to say the least.,1287100800,11,495,4.221052631578948
3005340,5,B000XRZO1K,".........this is what I would have liked my history classes to be like when I was at school.  The historical eras covered by Terry Jones in these DVDs is not to everyone's liking but the presentation and discussion of the history is very engaging and is very watchable. The visual imagery of Terry Jones in various historical costumes to help explain a point is perhaps not what everyone wants their history to be reduced to, but he does this with style that few other more formal presenters could match.  This does make the program more lighthearted that some weightier programs but in many respects the result is much more memorable this way.",1264809600,11,644,4.741071428571429
3005341,4,B000XRZO1K,"Long have I searched for Terry Jones' ""Ancient Inventions"" series (well, at least since 1998 when it briefly aired).  For those of you who remember James Burke's brilliant ""Connections"" series, you would also like Jones' short series about the unexpected, serendipidous paths taken towards humanity's most noteworthy inventions.  Given that Jones is a Monty Python alum, it shouldn't be surprising that this program is more heavily weighted towards humor than Burke's was.  It doesn't trivialize its subject matter however; its ultimate thesis actually goes grimly further than James Burke's program did.  According to Jones, every innovation has brought vexing new problems.  Human history is not a march of progress, but rather a vicious circle carved by a species forever trying to overtake challenges of its own making. Moreover, he adds that inventions don't simply enter use when they are devised, but can rot away, unappreciated, until political and social circumstances are ripe.

As an educator, I've found that ""Ancient Inventions"" is highly accessible to cynical teenagers.  Its tongue-in-cheek discussion of many inventions slips deftly into young minds.  As wonderfully appropriate as ""Ancient Inventions"" is, the next installment in this series - ""The History of Sex"" - while similar in tone and interest, is not. So park the latter at home, folks.",1225584000,19,1362,5.421800947867299

8229326,5,B000XRZO1K,"Terry Jones brings his Monty Python humor to all his historical videos. Most people don't realize that he is an historian and medievalist, and he explains ancient events and realities with light hearted expertise. The result is effective, amusing education. This one is particularly informative, delivered with his unique perspective. For those who share an interest in the distant past, this video is highly recommended.",1495065600,,421,5.492307692307692
8229327,5,B000XRZO1K,"These episodes really have a fun, high-school history/did-you-know-that feel to them.  Sure some of the facts are a little glossed over and/or highly summarized, and there is one episode about sex that kinda winds up being about 60% early Christian church bashing based on some incredibly poor interpretation of the Bible, but for the most part it's a really fun learning experience.  Bonus points for the narrator/historian being Monty Python alumnus Terry Jones.  He really does a good job of bringing some fun and excitement to the history he's presenting.  Definitely recommended for the history buff or documentary fan.",1491523200,,624,5.2727272727272725

8229333,5,B000XRZO1K,Very interesting,1424131200,,16,7.5
8229334,5,B000XRZO1K,"Terry Jones presents us with another another well-done social history in his quirky, tongue-in-cheek style, but with some surprisingly thoughtful and poignant moments.  The run-time is lengthy, as there are six episodes, but, of course, the material that could be covered in such a project might encompass time three times as long, so some viewers might be disappointed that their favorite point of interest is not covered.
  I originally bought the set because I finally was able to get the programs the Secrets of Ancient Egypt and the Secrets of Ancient Rome on DVD.  Both programs are informative and enjoyable for my middle school students.  I was overjoyed to see that the English versions were actually from an hour program while their American versions had been clipped to a mere 25 minutes.
  The episode on ancient inventions was interesting and Mr. Jones was able to deal with a broad variety of inventions from weapons to the steam engine.  The episode regarding ancient cities was a little cursory for my taste, but with such a broad range of possible topics, I cannot see how one program had a chance to deal with the subject in enough detail.
  The two episodes dealing with sex and love were interesting, but I found a little salacious. However, even American TV allows itself to indulge in these matters from time to time.  However, there were some interesting tidbits here and there (i.e., the gradual expunging of all things sexual from the Judeo-Christian traditions).  Although treated with seriousness, the subject matter and accompanying illustrations and statuary are not suitable for American classroom use.",1417996800,4,1632,5.071161048689139
