6105718,4,B00GS08YJA,"The opening scene consists of Duke (Mark Burnham) a Tom Arnold looking cop selling pot to a kid packaged inside a dead rat. The kid objects, but Duke chastises him into thinking it is normal...as does all his other customers. The film focuses on the antics of 3-5 cops. There is no character introduction, just connected bits. There is a bizarre story line to the film.

As despicable and crazy of a character as Duke, he is the closest thing to a protagonist and voice of reason.

Eric Wareheim plays a cop who misuses his authority for his breast fetish.

Steve Little is a desk cop who is still in the closet and doesn't want his family to know.

Shirley (Arden Myrin) is Eric's partner and is all about herself.

Marilyn Manson and Eric Roberts have minor roles.

I would say the film wasn't great, but it was fun to watch with popcorn. If you read the by-line it claims the film was about attempting to dispose of a body (Daniel Quinn) one of them accidentally shot. That was indeed part of it, but the film had some more stuff going for it. And BTW, the body they want to dispose of is not dead yet.

6105721,5,B00GS08YJA,"If your idea of choice comedy is the mainstream ""people fall down and fart and get bodily fluids on them and say bad words a lot while screaming"" sort of thing, you'll probably think this movie is pretty boring.  If, on the other hand, you like surrealism and just plain goofy weirdness without much of a plot, you'll adore this masterpiece.",1388102400,5,341,4.590163934426229
6105722,4,B00GS08YJA,"Chances are if you liked RUBBER, you'll like this.  It's basically about corrupt cops, doing questionable things.  It's abstractly-grindhousely ridiculous in an amusing way.  Not trying to be anything but what it is.

I'd give it 7/10.  It's not for anyone, but for those who open to more unusual approaches and weird/quirky comedy would enjoy it.",1387929600,,347,5.125
6105723,1,B00GS08YJA,Rented this because the other two reviews gave it five stars. This is not funny at all. They want to be funny but they aren't. Don't waste your money on this one. We couldn't even watch the whole thing.,1387929600,2,202,4.205128205128205
6105724,5,B00GS08YJA,"This is a hard one to review seriously. You can't do it without making the movie sound as terrible as it is. Dupieux/Mr. Oizo knows how to make a movie and his music is awesome, he's a great editor with a killer sense of humor, unafraid to take risks and experiment with media... but he's also really super weird.

This is the exact kind of movie where the best way to recommend it is to ask first ""have you seen Rubber or Wrong?"" If the answer is no, you tell that person ""well, you probably should know about those first..."" If the answer is yes, your next question should be ""did you like it/them?"" If they liked it, they'll probably admit to loving them. Wrong Cops is for them. If they didn't, they'll complain about how insipid and annoying they were and that they couldn't finish them. Wrong Cops is not for them. Truly, you can't just ""like"" Quentin Dupieux - you either love this guy and the grief he puts on people who take the art-form of film too seriously or you despise him for having bad taste and too much time on his hands.

I give this movie a 5 partially because it'll help to offset the inevitable wave of 1's from everyone else but mostly because I laughed so uncomfortably throughout the whole 80 minutes of cops just being d cks to eachother the whole time. That's the story, by the way. It's cops being d cks to eachother. I'm sure there are things I could say to spoil the movie and I could try to summarize the plot for you but that's (a) what the synopsis is for and (b) it's not at all what this movie's really about. There's no moral, no message, no plan to get the viewer to believe or agree with or ponder one thing. It's a movie about cops being d cks.",1387843200,,1684,4.242990654205608
6105725,5,B00GS08YJA,"I am a big fan of Quentin Dupieux since ""Rubber"" and ""Wrong"" are just two of my favorite movies of his so far. I hope Dupieux never changes because there is truly no other director like him that makes wonderfully bizarre movies. Now if you are some type of movie watcher that sticks with big budget movies with big name actors then you might want to stay away from this movie because you will not understand the whole humor and weirdness behind this ""Wrong Cops"" movie. However if you have seen ""Rubber"" or ""Wrong"" on Netflix and somehow enjoyed them because of how original it is because you never know what is going to happen next, then you need to see ""Wrong Cops.""  Also, tons of other actors that appeared in Dupieux past movies like ""Rubber"" or ""Wrong"" appear in ""Wrong Cops"" as well. Oh and the music is amazing in this movie which does not surprise me since Dupieux is a music composer in real life as well. Now if you are a Tim & Eric tv show fan or whatever since Eric Wareheim is in this movie as well and he does a fantastic job as well but he is not in the entire movie, just small parts. Anyways, this movie is for Quentin Dupieux fans!!! Support and Enjoy this wonderfully weird movie!",1387756800,4,1200,4.333333333333333
6105726,5,B00GS08YJA,A great dark cult film with twisted humor and eccentric characters. Not for squares! If you like Tim and Eric or David Lynch you'll dig this. If you're looking for Super Troopers look elsewhere,1447113600,,193,4.705882352941177
6105727,5,B00GS08YJA,You need a certain personality to like this movie.  I'll loved it.  I bought it for a family member and they didn't like it.  It is funny.  Some parts you can't get out of your head and just keep laughing inside every time you think about it.,1446336000,,242,4.085106382978723

6105729,4,B00GS08YJA,"Rubber, Wrong and then Wrong Cops. This director is absolutely crazy. My kind of film maker. If you like dark humor or want to see Marilyn Manson play a shy Emo/Techno nerd (and who wouldn't) then this is the film for you.",1431043200,,222,4.309523809523809

6105735,5,B00GS08YJA,"I can't remember the last time I was so thoroughly satisfied by a movie  WRONG COPS is reckless and sophisticated at once. Its main character Officer Duke is our age's Ubu  his speech near the film's end transcends the genre of comedy. And the music (by Mr Oizo, alias of the film's director Quentin Dupieux) is so entrancing that it lures me to watch the movie again & again  after seeing it more than 30 times now, I keep loving it more with each new viewing.",1409356800,,461,4.337209302325581

6105738,4,B00GS08YJA,Haven't watched the whole thing. I only wanted to see this movie for Marilyn Manson so I watched it on you tube and Manson was so funny! I loved his part!

6105739,4,B00GS08YJA,"I help make films locally. I feel a number of low budget directors I've worked with have a cool comic sensibility... Frank Stamm's stuff can be seen on Youtube for free, some of the others are in limited release or listed here on Amazon... but there are FEW major league directors that capture what's cool/quirky about low budget comedy. Jared Hess pulled it off with Napoleon Dynamite, lost the groove on Nacho Libre, got it back for Gentlemen Broncos. Quentin Dupieux, if nothing else, is a guy to keep your eye on. Does he nail it on this film? In terms of comedy not quite (I agree with the sentiments in the review titled, ""A Comedy That'll Likely Offend More Than It'll Ever Endear"")... but the film is good if not great, and another interesting entry in the director's catalog.",1400716800,,784,4.607142857142857
6105740,1,B00GS08YJA,"I don't usually write reviews, but I thought I may write this review (warning actually). So, when you want to call something a ""movie"", it must have an original a story, or anything that grabs your attention from the first scene to the last scene. Well, this so-called movie does not really have that.

Ideas were repeated at least once to the point that I was able to anticipate many scenes. For instance, When that guy went into the store to steal a shovel and pointed the gun at the check-out girl, I was 100% sure that she was going to act normally. How did I know ? Because in the scene just before it, the same thing happened (when the cop pointed a gun at yoga girl and she wasn't threatened at all).

I started writing this review halfway through. But then I said ""Nooo, that is not fair. I should watch it all and THEN write a review"". I wish I never continued watching it. It is a WASTE of time and money. Honestly, I do not expect anyone with a good taste in movies to like this movie. If I could rate it lower than one star, I would.

One piece of advice: If you have extra 6.99$ laying around and planning to watch this movie, DON'T!! Just take those 6.99$ and get matches for 1$ and burn the rest. You would probably have much more fun watching your money burn than watching this movie.",1391904000,3,1300,4.233870967741935
6105741,2,B00GS08YJA,"This had such potential and it was such a very clever idea. It seemed they were trying to do ""East Bound and Down"" but with cops, and it failed....terribly!",1391558400,,156,4.413793103448276
6105742,1,B00GS08YJA,"Quirky cops do bad things in this God-awful film by writer/director Quentin Dupieux, who made the cult followed 'Rubber', about a tire with telepathic powers, and the wonderfully offbeat 'Wrong'.  This one, however, is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  There's not even an accidental moment of value in this horrible, horrible movie.  It's a 2013 release and now gets the honor to be added to the very top of my Worst Films of 2013 blog.  Now, if only I could get that $6.99 and 82 minutes of my life back ...

'Wrong Cops' is now available on Video on Demand should you choose to make a very poor decision.  But don't say I didn't warn you.

Grade: F

Who is this movie for?  Complete idiots.  And those who loved the awful Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie (which also features Eric Wareheim) and don't mind seeing something even worse!

Its not a knee jerk comedy more of a wtf comedy....if you love Mr. Oizo then youll probably love this movie because it feels like the visual approximation of his music in many ways....YEAH MR. OIZO!!!  if you are here for eric from tim and eric you probably won't like this movie btw hes really funny but its not at all like tim and eric. You for sure get french vibes from the movie, which means its slow and all about building up the moment rather than getting you to laugh as soon as possible like tim and eric but in many ways its the same kind of humor which is probably why he agreed to work on it with Oizo. I really love how Mr. Oizo seems uncompromising in his artistic vision and unafraid to take risks not sure those risks always pan out but i'm such a fan boy I can't help but give his film five stars.",1506124800,,955,4.026315789473684
