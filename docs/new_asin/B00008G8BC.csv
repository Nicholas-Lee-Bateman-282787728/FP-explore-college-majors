Funny, but the DVD was billed as a Mark Harmon movie---he is in it more than Joe, but is not in it much more than that.  Overall, despite being REALLY disappointed that Joe was not really in it, it was an okay movie about friendships and romantic relationships sometimes affecting long time friends.",1428883200,,386,4.565217391304348
7983444,5,B00008G8BC,"I enjoyed the role of Laurel Holloman in this wonderful movie.  She has that innocence about her and the wit of a very intelligent woman.  In this role, she expected the four buddies had something up their sleeves and she appropriately handled it well.  I tremendously enjoyed this movie and the other characters.  Although, I do not like people being evil or mean spirited in movies; this movie ended up exactly the way it should have.  Thank you for a well made movie!",1392076800,,470,4.614457831325301
7983445,4,B00008G8BC,"Laurel Holloman was wonderful in this 1997 movie.  There are great shots of her playing tennis (she's pretty good at it)  and  going in and out of the ocean in a bikini.  The five guys in this movie, whose close comradeship was threatened by her engagement to one of them and her arrival at one of their good old  boys' weekends, were pretty pathetic IMO.  Even though it was a slight romantic comedy, it showcased the talent of an  incredibly talented actress in her mid=twenties.",1246233600,,481,4.588235294117647
7983446,3,B00008G8BC,"Even though this movie is predictable and contains one of the worst lines ever written for a film, ""cab service on this island leaves something to be desired"" it's fun to watch and has some funny moments.  Laurel Holloman fans will enjoy it.",1157846400,2,241,4.604651162790698
7983447,5,B00008G8BC,"A witty charming hilarious romantic farce.  (it could have been the story of my life).  You really ought to check it out.  Great cast.  While she is planning the wedding,  his buddies are planning the divorce.... get it when it comes down in price.",981072000,2,248,4.545454545454546
