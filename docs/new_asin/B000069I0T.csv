8629123,5,B000069I0T,"This is the only DVD I am aware of that archives previous flash animations.  It is hard to give the DVD a conclusive rating, because the animations range the gamut from silly and crudely drawn to inspired and really pushing the medium.  That means that it has something for everyone due to its being an overview.  I never was very partial to the potty humor cartoons that proliferated on the web in the late 90s, but I do appreciate the kinds that either riff on classic visual motifs or filmmaking techniques or the ones that really are exorbitant and flashy, just like the term implies.  Both styles are here.  An example of the latter would be the flash-music video pieces here done for the group The Supreme Beings of Leisure.  I had never seen these and they are fine pieces of eye candy that merit more than a single viewing.  Since almost all of these many clips (some are just 10 second advertising clips) will be or already are in the dustbins of history soon, having them on a DVD archive may be quite desirable for the flash and graphic design type who likes having reference and viewing materials around.  There are some interviews included, about a half of which was interesting enough to listen to, the rest like listening to a brilliant actor who is not so compelling when asked to talk about their craft.  All in all, an interesting find and worth checking out.",1044144000,7,1377,4.565040650406504
