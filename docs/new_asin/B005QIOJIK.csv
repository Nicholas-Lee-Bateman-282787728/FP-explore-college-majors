4858530,1,B005QIOJIK,"I saw the concert on the first night...thoroughly enjoyed it and was so anxious to get the DVD. Was very disappointed in this DVD. Some of the actual performances were not even in the movie...""Single Ladies"" for one. I believe the performances I saw on the first night were ALOT better than some that were in the movie. If a Glee fan wants to see it, and couldn't see it live, YouTube is better than this DVD.",1324512000,15,409,4.324675324675325
4858531,3,B005QIOJIK,"First off, the cast did a great job performing at the concert (not that I actually went to a concert). It's just the way it's on the DVD that I'm not thrilled with.

To begin with, it's labeled as a ""documentary"" concert film. Meaning they do interviews with fans throughout the movie. I wouldn't mind a little bit of ""my favorite character is..."" at the beginning before the concert starts, but the constant back and forth throughout the movie is distracting from the concert, imo. The interviews with the cast should stay, but the ones with the fans should go (or at least go on the special features).

Another thing I found annoying is the fact that most of the songs on the DVD are not in the order they sang in the concert. Also, while Dog Days Are Over and Friday are on the DVD, they are only in the special features part, not in the actual movie. If the songs were good enough to be performed in concert, why were they not good enough to be on the live in concert DVD?

Also, somehow I had expected the Jane Lynch scenes to be in the movie, but no, they're just in the special features.

Basically, I would have given this an A had it been more like the Taylor Swift live in concert DVD.",1324512000,38,1195,4.274336283185841
4858532,3,B005QIOJIK,"Flew out-of-state to see the concert on opening night, and wasn't impressed.

As much as I love the cast and songs, I'm VERY disappointed they did not perform the full songs, and just snippets of it.

A part from that, THIS DVD is awful. I want to see the concert, not all these kids saying how meaningful Glee is to them. I don't care about them, and didn't pay $13 at the movies to hear their stories. I wanted to see the ACTUAL concert, without any dumb interruptions.

What bothered me the most was they overlapped these kids videos over performances in the concert, most noticeably in ""Happy Days/ Are Here Again"" (when they cut out the best part of the song - Chris Colfer singing) and in ""Lucky"" with Dianna and Chord.

Moreover, I can't believe they didn't include Chris Colfer's ""Single Ladies"" dance! I thought the least they could do is include it on the DVD but nope! They didn't. Which was by the way, the BEST part of the concert (a part from the Warblers performance)

It's weird how they asked Jane Lynch to go to the NY show and they put her in the trailer but never show her in the movie. Granted, she is in the special features section but it bothers me that I can't play her scenes with the rest of the concert

Lastly, I hate how fake this concert is to the people who went to the shows. They made the cast perform the songs in a different order (not sure why, doesn't make any sense) which threw me off. Moreover, just knowing they filmed this concert in 2 days with fake audiences really puts me off.",1324512000,7,1523,4.326315789473684
4858533,1,B005QIOJIK,this was the worst movie ever.  nobody should ever buy it.  awful just plain awful.  I should never have bought if i knew it was this bad.  i like the show but the concert should never have happened.  this was my worts purchase ever,1324512000,3,232,4.181818181818182

This is fairy recent too becsuse all their latest hits including gwyneth singing forget you
It appears it's a mixture of footage from staples center and the Izod center in new jersey is it ?
Loved the backstage interviews while cast in wardrobe
I thoroughly enjoyed this concert and I've just seen the 3d portion

4858535,5,B005QIOJIK,"I was sitting in an aeroplane at 35,000FT and decided to see what Glee was all about (it was showing on the in-flight video service). Until then, Glee was just the name of an American show I kept on hearing but had never seen.
So, I started watching and soon I was hooked. The voices and songs are great, the strory is fun and emotional and sweet all mixed into one. I loved the part when the girl with short stature (sorry if that is not the correct term) went to the dance with the guy from the football team.
Gwynneth Paltrow is great in it too. She sings CeLo Green's hit 'Forget You'.

This kind of entertainemnt makes a welcome change from violence, sex and fighting.",1323907200,2,673,4.299212598425197
4858536,5,B005QIOJIK,"If there's one thing Glee has taught me, even at 23, is to be who you are and don't ever change that for anyone. 'Glee Live! In Concert' was the 2nd tour by the memebers of the hit Fox show&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Glee-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B0032JTV6U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Glee: The Complete First Season</a>. They perform the best of the best from the show. There are cute little vignettes in between songs talking about Janae, a dwarf, and how she deals with her ""handicap"" and Trenton, a gay kid who was outed unwillingly by his classmates; they share their stories. The staging is simple but the lighting and video screens make up the theatrics.

Although it's evident that the majority of the show is dubbed, that does not take away from the magic that is Glee. The members performed as a cast as well as solos- THE WARBLERS AND GWYNETH PALTROW MAKE APPEARANCES!!

The setlist is as follows:

1.""Don't Stop Believin'"" - Full cast
2.""Dog Days Are Over"" - Full cast
3.""Sing"" - Full cast
4.""I'm a Slave 4 U"" - Heather Morris
5.""Fat Bottomed Girls"" - Mark Salling
6.""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" - Chris Colfer
7.""Ain't No Way"" - Amber Riley
8.""P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)"" - Kevin McHale
9.""Born This Way"" - Full cast
10.""Firework"" - Lea Michele
11.""Teenage Dream"" - The Warblers
12.""Silly Love Songs"" - The Warblers
13.""Raise Your Glass"" - The Warblers
14.""Happy Days Are Here Again / Get Happy"" - Lea Michele and Chris ColfeR

17.""Don't Rain on My Parade"" - Lea Michele
18.""Jessie's Girl"" - Cory Monteith
19.""Valerie"" - Naya Rivera

21.""Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)"" - Chris Colfer, Jenna Ushkowitz, and Heather Morris
22.""Friday"" - Chord Overstreet, Mark Salling, Kevin McHale, Darren Criss, and Harry Shum, Jr.
23.""The Safety Dance"" - Kevin McHale
24.""Empire State of Mind"" - Full cast
25.""Somebody to Love"" - Full cast

Highlights of the show for me include Santana and Mercedes' rendition of RDMH, the Cast's rendition of BTW, and Kurt's IWHYH.

This is the perfect gift for any Gleek this holiday season!!!",1322179200,92,2218,5.049180327868853
4858537,3,B005QIOJIK,"It's important to understand up front that Glee: The 3D Concert Movie is really just for fans of the TV show. Anyone else will either find it just mildly entertaining or else be left wondering what the fuss is all about. A good example of this can be seen in interviews with various fans waiting to get into the concert. A number of them are wearing white T-shirts with different words and phrases printed on them in block letters. Anyone who hasn't seen the ""Born This Way"" episode of the TV show isn't going to get the context. Particularly of the shirts bearing the word ""Lebanese"".

The best parts of the show are in fact the ones dealing with the fans, both in the brief interviews with the fans waiting to get into the concert and with the in-depth interviews of four fans in particular: Janae, a high school cheerleader who's also a ""little person""; Trenton, a gay teen who was outed in the 8th grade; Josey, a girl who's the ultimate Glee fan who also has mild Asperger's; and Kellen Sarmiento, a pint-sized 5-year-old Filipino boy in a Warbler uniform who mimics Blaine's music moves. All of these people are fascinating to listen to, or in the case of ""the Mini-Warbler"" as he's now generally referred to, cute to watch.

But this is a concert film, and I'm afraid here even fans of the show may be somewhat disappointed. As my wife remarked afterwards, most of the numbers in the concert weren't done as well as they were in the TV show. The actual music numbers are a mixed bag. Most, like ""Don't Stop Believin'"", ""The Safety Dance"" and ""Somebody to Love"", are ones already familiar to fans from the TV show, but unfortunately not done as well as they were in the TV show (which admittedly is always a challenge in a concert film where you can't do multiple takes). A few numbers do stand out though. Brittany (Heather Morris) definitely turns up the heat a notch in ""I'm a Slave 4 U"", and Puck (Mark Salling) really revs up the crowd with his guitar-accompanied rendition of ""Fat Bottomed Girls"". I'm sure everyone will have their own favorites - already had one comment from a Santana (Naya Rivera) fan who really liked Santana's ""Valerie"" - but these were the ones that stood out for me.

Mercedes (Amber Riley) comes through with her usual gusto and clarity but her numbers unfortunately aren't that memorable. The same for Rachel (Lea Michele) who almost makes it with her rendition of ""Don't Rain on my Parade"" but the arrangement fails to make the best use of her marvelous voice. She did however have one of the funnier backstage bits where, before she goes on, someone tells her that Barbra Streisand is in the audience and she proceeds to panic and gush about how she always knew this day would come! Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr) has a nice bit where he does his ""Robot Chang"" routine, but otherwise it's clear that he's really a dancer (a really good dancer, to be fair) and not a singer.

The rest of the cast are there and most have numbers but don't really make much of an impact. Artie (Kevin McHale) spends a lot of his backstage time apparently trying to do a Justin Bieber impression. The Warblers numbers seemed uninspired and went on way too long. But the biggest (and strangest) disappointment was Kurt (Chris Colfer) who seemed more comfortable in the background singing back-up than when he was doing a duet or solo number, where he seemed almost detached and lacking his usual flamboyance and panache. He also seemed to have the least to say in the parts where the camera goes backstage. I've been told though that the DVD/Blu-ray release will include a couple of numbers and scenes with him that were left out of the movie itself as extras.

I think the key problem is that what Glee fans love about the TV show are the characters, and most of the songs in the TV show take on a special meaning because of the context they appear in, relating to the events in each episode's storyline and the lives and feelings of the characters we have gotten to know. But in the concert, all of that context is largely missing. There's no real story (other than the conceit that we're seeing the characters in concert and not the actors who play them) and little if any interaction between the characters, and so the songs lose the context they had in the TV episodes.

As for the 3D part, as it is with most 3D movies of the last few years, there was _no_ reason to make this a 3D movie. The only part of the film where the 3D has anything to offer is during the credits when the screen is bombarded with CGI slushies. It's definitely a nice touch, but doesn't justify the use of 3D for the entire film.

Strangely, Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), who can be seen snarling in a couple of remarkably funny bits in the movie trailers, was not in the concert film itself. She will however be showing up on the DVD/Blu-ray when it comes out. Also strangely, occasional substitute teacher Holly Holiday (Gwyneth Paltrow) makes an appearance in the film but series regular Will Shuester (Matthew Morrison) does not. I particularly missed Mr. Shue as Morrison puts enormous energy and feeling into his performances in the TV show and is just a lot of fun to watch.

Recommended mainly for for Glee fans, particularly those who like to hear other Glee fans tell their stories, and for fans of Brittany and Puck in particular for their stand-out numbers.",1318723200,20,5364,4.5570539419087135

4858614,4,B005QIOJIK,"As a Gleek, I had high hopes for this movie. I was excited that I was going to be able to see some live performances from my favorite characters because I didn't have the opportunity to see it in person. I had a friend who saw them live, and she told me it was great.

I was very impressed with the performances of the cast. They're a very talented group of people, and the fact they stayed in character made it better. The downfall of the performances is the fact that they aren't all the complete songs. It would've been nice to see that, but besides that, they were very good. Including the warblers in this was a great touch, and it was cute when Blaine came over to New Directions.

The worst part of this DVD, besides the incomplete songs, is the fact that it is basically only concert footage and three kids talking about how Glee has impacted them. It was a nice touch to the movie, but it took up too much time, in my opinion. There was nothing I'd consider to be ""behind-the-scenes."" Sure, they talked to Brittany (Heather Morris) and Rachel (Lea Michele) a few times, and there was the little goofing of Blaine and the Warblers, but besides those instances, that aspect of the movie was lacking and poorly done. I would've liked to hear from other characters. Another thing they could've added is people backstage practicing and messing around. Maybe even a little bit of preparation for the show, but nothing of the sort was included.

The bonus features were good for what was included. Some (maybe two?) full performances, but the entire movie should've been like that. They were cute little transitions for songs.

Something that annoyed me was the fact it was pretty obvious the songs weren't in order. While it wasn't that big of a deal, it made me think of how they could've just included the entire concert and not skimped on the performances and the seemingly cute interaction of the characters during song transitions.

In my opinion, they could've gone so many ways with this movie that could've made it much better than it was. I'm a little disappointed in how it was done. If they weren't going to do any behind-the-scenes clips (like I've seen in many other concert DVDs), at least they could've put out the entire concert.

All things considered, I did enjoy what I was given; that's why I gave it four stars. The missing star symbolizes what I thought was missing (either the behind-the-scenes or the full concert). I just wish there was more of the characters and more music, but what was included wasn't half bad. It's what's missing that bothers the crap out of me.

If you are a Gleek, this is probably a good addition to your collection. If you're looking to get into Glee, you should probably just start with season one episode one and perhaps eventually look into watching this when you get to know the characters and the stories behind why the songs are on the show.",1435017600,3,2901,4.5673076923076925

4858664,3,B005QIOJIK,"I wanted a real concert blu ray.  But instead you get this.  SOme songs and lots of other stuff.  The show is now going to have one final season for a total of five.  But back in 2011 it was a new show basically.  And a huge hit. The lead actor had yet to die from drugs either.  (drugs suck). This show is a lot of fun and worth the watch.  The concert blu ray does have very good 3d in it and I only saw it around briefly then it vanished.  I had to order it off amazon.com to get one.  IN 3d the show shines better , but as others have said < I wanted a concert video. Much like the scorpions live in 3d. (that one is totally great rock shot live in 3d).  I wasn't expecting hard rock here though, just fun glee club tunes.  If you are a fan get the 3d version,  or at least the blu ray.  If you are a casual fan you may not be as happy with it.  Kudos for the cast and crew for making a great tv show. which could live on if they maybe got a new cast?  For a season six.  But that won't happen.  But this concert 3d video is for fans more than casual listeners.  Unlike the scorpions 3d, or guns and roses 3d, or joe satriani 3d , all of those can be enjoyed on a the 3d level as well as the music level as they are just concerts.",1416182400,,1234,3.735408560311284

They think this is a statement on present. Culture , yet aren't they all . Is statements in culture always cliche ? Is there any other way . Originality is basically nonexistent , change is the most fitting term . This makes no attempt to hide its point of lecture on early 21st century culture , but has it fooled the audience ? Has the point been blown past into celebration , so to speak . Are the crew that's complaining about liberalism even watched it ? Which side is more clueless ? And this is really the center point for the political fire of the Christian Right that the 700 club has started . Is it missed the point entirely .",1406332800,,808,4.088050314465409

Why did they cut the numbers?  It is a concert, not a long trailer.  There is so much that the Glee cast gives the audience,  Why shouldn't the people that edited and produced the DVD allow the fans to have that experience?  Sound quality is terrible.

Well my wife watched it once and said sell it, give it away, trash it.  According to her the songs were no big deal.  The performers did not have many solos.  It was shot as a stage show, but with too many distant views.  Buy the DVDs of the TV series instead.",1394582400,,390,3.8125

All I wanted is a record of their concerts and does not really care about the fans stuff that were inserted in between the shows. The title Glee:  The Concert Movie is deceiving.

4858722,3,B005QIOJIK,"I love Glee. I think some of their covers are better than even the original artist's rendition. But this movie just didn't live up to their TV standards. First, half the movie is fans talking about why they like Glee. Personally, I don't care why they like Glee, and I'm not sure who thought this made for good TV. Second, the audio quality is appalling. They actors are all miked. I shouldn't have to listen to the loud white noise of the crowd masking the songs. I'm not suggesting overdubbing, but I have plenty of other concert DVD's where the crowd is simply background noise.

If you love Glee and are dying to see this concert, buy used or borrow a copy from someone. It really isn't worth more than a few bucks.",1376352000,,719,4.406015037593985

I was also disappointed in the music itself.  Several of the songs, you can see all of the cast singing, but you can only hear Rachel.  Not what I was looking for.  The music on the regular season show is better than the concert. :(",1373414400,3,479,4.042553191489362

4858739,5,B005QIOJIK,"I would have enjoyed it more without all the interviews with school kids tossed in, but I'm a concert purist.  I like how the glee kids stayed in character throughout the movie.  Gwyneth Paltrow makes an appearance as well as Jane Lynch.  This DVD is definitely geared toward kids, but all glee fans would love it.",1368489600,2,314,4.571428571428571

4858741,3,B005QIOJIK,"Although you get the highlights from the concert, it's not as good as actually attending.  They could have cut out all of the side stories with the kids touched by Glee and left more of the concert storyline or added more backstage stuff.  I'd also have preferred for the actors to be themselves and not in character.",1366675200,,317,4.543859649122807
4858742,5,B005QIOJIK,Always great to hear the team from glee perform. Somehow they jus manage to do the covers so well I'm glued to them.,1365033600,,116,4.086956521739131
4858743,4,B005QIOJIK,"I started watching ""Glee"" in probably the second season.  After I watched a couple of episodes, I believe that I went back and saw the episodes from Season One that I missed.  While I'm surely not the target audience for this teeny-bopper-targeted material, I still really like the show.  Sue Sylvester kills me.  And Brittany S. Pears is hilarious, reminding me of Lisa Kudrow on ""Friends.""  And of course, Lea Michelle is an awesome singer, giving Barbara Streisand a run for her money.  And the rest of the cast is very good as well.

While this film's a little ""weepy"" -- they bring in fans between songs for real-life interviews, where some of those fans have been treated poorly and overcome it, a general theme of ""Glee"" -- it didn't water the movie down much for me.  I wasn't crying like the little girls up front, the girls who wanted to be the next Lea Michelle, but it was still touching without being over-the-top sappy.  There is one scene that was memorable:  a little Warbler wannabe -- he is no more than four years old tops -- is all dressed up in the Warbler gear, he's singing and he's dancing in front of his TV while the Warblers are performing behind him.  I was howling, and I'm sure that Blaine got a kick out of it as well.

With regards to the music, if you've watched the television series, you've heard most of the songs.  Most of them are recycled from various episodes, spiced up a bit with some nice choreography, particularly great dancing by Ms. Pears.  But even still, it's nice to see that the singers on the show are really good, as you're never quite sure how good they are while watching on TV.  ""How much overdubbing did they do?"" is what I usually think.  Well here, while there's surely mixing going on, it's pretty much them singing live.

More like really a 3, but I'll round up to a 4 today since I'm in a good mood.  ""Glee"" the movie will do that to you.",1364688000,,1900,4.410919540229885

Well, the device was already updated, though I checked again today for any new updates (none needed), and this BR disc simply won't play.

Others on the internet claim that Samsung players have a problem with this BR movie, and they blame the player manufacturer, as some others blame Sony. Me, I blame FOX for putting out a disc that won't play on current BR machines even though 300 other Blu-rays I own ALL play fine. The problem is this disc, not the machines.

Luckily, the DVD plays. La dee da. I bought this item to view in high definition. Ah, well. Thanks, Fox.",1509494400,,726,4.492424242424242
