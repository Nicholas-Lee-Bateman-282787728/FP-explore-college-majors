When the lead character picks up the bimbo on the beach, then reads her his poetry while she is taking a dump...that's gotta be one of the classic scenes in movie history.
My other favorite is when the nerdy kid tries to bribe Porky  by offering him a handful of turds...that one had me laughing so hard that I was in tears.
This movie was way ahead of its time, real sick.",978825600,,469,4.086956521739131
747473,5,6303957269,"What a geek film, but I love geeks and this one has the geek to beat all geeks.  You gotta love a geek who is obsessed with finding his long lost daddy.
My favorite scene is the one where the videogame hustler Nash is boffing his girlfriend and he farts and climaxes at the same time, that's a classic, kinda reminds me of an old boyfriend.
The stuff with the nun at the end is off the wall.",972259200,2,391,4.012820512820513
747474,5,6303957269,"A bunch of us guys saw this film at a buds house the other night an had to pass the word.  My bud once worked for a film editor and stole this movie, said its almost impossible to find in any store.  Its a Troma film an  usually I find them sick corny but this one is way cool.
Film is weird  but a real laugh in a dry kind of way. Surprised to see it made back in  86.
You get strange philosophy about society mixed in with lots of unreal  fartjokes an every weirdo in LA is in film.
Wonder if Stern or Tom Green  saw this film before they went gross?",963532800,2,552,3.789473684210526
7857789,4,6303957269,"Got this joint just to see little Tony work his thing.  He was off the hook in the Santa film with Billy Bob Thornton.

You gotta love watching za little black man in the face of the big stinker, Nash.

I only wish Tony had messed him up even more, maybe pushed his face into a toilet.  Now that woulda been a bigger laugh.

This is a joint you want to see with your boo when you needing a real haha.",1143849600,,400,3.888888888888889
7857790,2,6303957269,"this is a descent flick but in no ways like what people on amazon say it is

for one a lot of people were offended by this movie yeah its offensive but its not anywere near as offensive as southpark

or even saturday night live  and also no were near as funny

i bought this movie because the reviewers said it was very offensive and evil  man was i disappointed it was not zany or funny or evil let alone offensive although it is entertaining at points it was worth the 3 dollars i spent on it",1118275200,,494,4.051546391752577
7857791,1,6303957269,"thank jesus i didn't pay for this movie and seen it for free at the school i go to.

this sick film makes fun of cathlics and fat people  and mexicans and all kinds of good people.  the only thing funny bout it is how it makes fun of queers.

this film made around 20 years ago and probably caused the decaddence and perversons sweeping all across country today.  this kind of film is like a cancer that should have been stopped long time ago.

maybe someday jesus will forgive the jerk who made this bad film but but i never will.",1107561600,3,531,4.1568627450980395
7857792,1,6303957269,"i was forced to see this bad film the other night and it made me so mad i had to warn everybody at amazon to avoid avoid avoid.

this stinker is getting played during midnight cult movie nights at a college near here and it should be burned in a big fire at midnight instead.

since when is it funny to have stories about main characters suffering from diahrreas and fat people sticking tongues in ears and nerds writing bad poems to topless girls????????

stay away for sake of your mental health",1105920000,2,497,4.380434782608695
7857793,5,6303957269,"still laughing over some of those wild fart jokes.

the old guy who farts when he comes HOHOHOHO that's a classic!

and the nerd was so buggy it made me want to beat him up",1104796800,,172,3.8857142857142857
7857794,4,6303957269,"That question is asked over and over again in this wacked out movie and thats why I love it.
It's the same question my boyfriend makes me ask him every time we do it.  Kinky.
My other favorite line:  ""I call it my punk pounder""
Well any film that's got a punk pounder inside it is OK with me.",1015113600,,292,3.9322033898305087
7857795,5,6303957269,"I really used to love the old oddball films like ""Harold and Maude"" or Polanski's ""The Tenant"" or ""How to Get Ahead in Advertising"" etc etc etc.  Now it seems most movies today are so mainstream.  Snore.
Zap is one of the better oddball films I've seen in a long time.  Somehow I missed seeing this little gem until my company included it as part of a ""Strange Films Weekend.""
There is one scene in this film that had everybody on the floor.  I won't give it away except to say that it involves a nerd, his car, and a hitchhiker who has the worst case of diarhea.
ROFLMAO
Yeah they sure don't make movies like this anymore.",1008633600,,623,4.254237288135593
7857796,3,6303957269,"This old movie is been showing up at the college, getting passed around at all the parties.  I finally got a look at it over at some girl's dorm
It's got some real funny stuff but I don't think it's as good as Rocky Horror show.
Only reason I thinks its getting popular with everybody is its story showing this nerd searching for his dad all over L.A.  Everywhere he goes, people dump on him big time like the hitchiker who [has a bowel movement] inside his car and he's always depressed cause he can never find his dad.  He kinda figures if he finds his dad thats gonna make everything OK.
That's just like it is today with young Americans like me, we is always looking for somebody who can make us happy.  You know,  like an honest president or supporting family or a girlfriend who don't cheat or a banker who [cares] about your money and on and on.  We think if we find these people we gonna be happy.  Who knows?
Its kind of bizare how this movie gets people laughing big time but also they get so heavy serious during some intense scenes.
For me I wanna see a lot more sex in a film, there should be more naked girls.  Otherwise it's good there's nothing like it out there I've seen.",998006400,4,1189,4.230088495575221
7857797,1,6303957269,"The scariest thing bout this film is how many good reviews it got on this forum.  Makes me sick.  Its no small wonder America is falling into a gutter of gross stupidty and moral decay.
 If you like long winded intelectual discussions of bowel movements, if you love a film that babbles endlessly bout all the cruel ""daddies"" in the world,  if you have a thing for films with an endless parade of fat people and fat jokes, if you enjoy a lead character who is a butt ugly nerd and NEVER changes his clothes through the entire film, well then this one is for you.
On the other hand if you want to see movies that praise mankind and raise the spirit, then run away from this gutter rot as fast as you can!!",997574400,4,704,4.192592592592592
7857798,5,6303957269,"This zap film had me rolling on the floor.
I didn't want to view it at first, Troma films aren't my thing, but my sis insisted I should turn it on.
Starts off kinda slow then just builds an builds, its black dry humor at its finest.
Definitely not a typical Troma film because behind the farts, the T & A., and the weirdos, it's got an intellectual feel about it, there's a real mind behind this trip into the bizarre.
Make sure you see this with a bunch of friends, it adds to all the fun.",982972800,3,490,4.061855670103093
