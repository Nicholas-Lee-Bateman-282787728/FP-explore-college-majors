8451890,5,B0050UEVOQ,"It's just as great as the other season sets. Jam-packed with parodies and references to other media (Anime, Manga, Games, TV) and never stops being funny. It's a little bit less raunchy than the prior seasons, but a great set nevertheless. Some mild fanservice here and there, science fiction violence and heavy innuendo, it's a perfect set for Anime fans from teens and up! With 352+ episodes, it's almost just as popular as ""The Simpsons"" is around the rest of the world.

8451891,5,B0050UEVOQ,Looks silly and somewhat dumb...but Sgt. Frog is a great anime,1425686400,,62,4.7272727272727275
8451892,5,B0050UEVOQ,"I am always amazed at the quality of the Funimation dub actors. Sgt. Frog is no different, it has the voice acting performances one would only expect to come from Bang Zoom or the Ocean Group. The comedy translates well into English, which if often difficult when the subject matter is Japanese popular culture but much like shin chan they do a great job of using references Americans will understand without altering the original content too much.",1355011200,,448,4.8311688311688314
8451893,5,B0050UEVOQ,one of the funniest shows that i had seen for a long time. Sgt. Frog is one of those shows that you cant get enough of.,1325980800,,119,3.6153846153846154
8451894,5,B0050UEVOQ,"My son got me hooked on mangas and Sgt Frog & crew are just the funniest thing.  We googled & saw that Japan is years ahead of us and can't wait for them to be translated into English.  Not only are the ARMPIT crew funny, they are addicting.  So PLEASE hurry and translate the rest of the series.  My son has all the books, but the show make it all come to life. Plus we get to see life in other ways.  I've recommended this series to both kids & adults.",1317772800,2,454,3.9450549450549453
8451895,3,B0050UEVOQ,"I love SGT Frog.

Part 1 made me LOL, pretty much the whole way through.  Party two had a few good lines to make me laugh, but the laughs weren't as often, the pacing of the series was slower...  It just felt boring compared to Part 1, it's like Part 2 was filler...  I can't really explain it.  I hope the show rebounds, what a disappointment.  It's still better then the last part of Season 2.  Just not the epic success that part 1 was.",1315612800,,439,4.094117647058823
8451896,5,B0050UEVOQ,"Sgt. Frog Season 3 part 2 is a great addition to any anime fans collection ecspecially if you love comedy. In my opinion, Sgt. Frog is more than just a comedy, it is a cultural achievement. Never before has Japanese comedy and American comedy been blended together so well. Because of this hilarious mix, not only will hardcore anime fans get a kick out it but really anyone with a sense of humor will find this anime appealing. And if english dub just is not your thing, diehard anime fans will be glad to know that all the Japanese audio has been kept and can be watched with english subtitles. As for me, I am fully confident that Funimation is going in the right direction with this dub. There is no doubt in my mind now that there are some comedy geniuses working at Funimation. The english writers have done an amazing job filling much of the show's dialouge with comedy gold and every American voice actor involved has delivered a spectacular comedic preformance. As of now, Sgt. Frog has shown no signs of becoming dull unlike many comedies I have seen on T.V. Even after 78 episodes, it appears to still be going strong and I am truly proud of everyone who has worked so hard on Sgt. Frog in both Japan and America. I hope season 4 comes out soon because I simply cannot wait to watch more.",1314576000,6,1299,4.416666666666667
