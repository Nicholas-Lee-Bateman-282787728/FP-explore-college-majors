3122,5,0739040375,"I've worn out this video over the years cause I got it on VHS,now its on DVD! My few comments on Paul Gilbert is that through his playing,he show's alot of discipline and passion on the way he play's. but most of all, he's passionate about music thats why he got to the level of where he's at. I've meet him couple of times at a NAMM show and it was like talking to the next door neighbor. no rocks star attitude just plain Paul Gilbert DOWN TO EARTH...If your like me who's alway's practicing to get better all the time and to learn more, GET THIS DVD and apply the skills you learn from Paul in a band situation when its called for. I happen to be fortunate that growin up in the 80's doing this stuff called shred playing was the NORM back then, so I caught up to this GIT style real quick and for the most part,this was the ticket to be in a band back then.
if you've never done this kinda stuff then be prepared for some seriouse learning curve adjustments. Dont give up keep up on practicing and discipline,some things don't come easy but when you get there, its personaly an awesome accomplishment,convidence builder. but most of all one's you can master 2 or 3 of Paul's licks it comes easier cause it builds on top of each other. happy picking and have some good laughter on Paul's humor...",1183161600,7,1299,4.284552845528455
3123,5,0739040375,"This was produced going on 20 years ago, (the 1st half anyway) but is still relevant today.  After the post-grunge backlash of the early to mid 90's it is good to see this style of playing coming back.  Paul is an unassuming character whose delivery & instruction of his style & technique is very helpful & down to earth.  The 1st half of the DVD was done in his early Racer X days & really reflects the licks from that era, as the 2nd half naturally exposes the Mr. Big pop oriented offerings.  This DVD will either inspire you to attempt to reach his level of technique, or really discourage you.  But again, I believe his good nature will inspire most.  I was able to meet Mr. Gilbert at a clinic shortly after ""To be with you"" was a hit for Mr. Big years ago & he was still really down to Earth.  A whole new generation have the opportunity to learn from him & really should make this DVD part of their library.  Just do your best to ignore the 80's-90's ""production"" :)  Also the addition of the .PDF files for Vol. 2 is a nice touch!",1182816000,3,1039,4.207070707070707

3125,5,0739040375,"Paul Gilbert got my attention in a tiny article from Guitar World, maybe Guitar Player, back in I'd say 87? maybe even earlier. he had just won a guitar gun slinger contest in the LA area and was heaed to GIT.  ayway, I kept an eye out for him along the way, and sho nuff, he is a technical monster. he may not send quite the emotional chills of say, I don't know, Eddie Van Halen (78-84 that is)? but the cat definitely sings some soul with his axe too, don't get me wrong.  I'd say, get his chops down, maybe some DiMeola master's level stuff too if you are into fast, clean, alternate picking as I try to be, then fuse your own soul with it--put some Clapton, SRV, Jimi, and Eddie in there--don't forget to bend it and shake it! you may come out with some really fresh, really good stylistic new frontiers--At least, that's what I'm after. just don't forget to make it YOUR OWN! balance in all things.  this video is all you need to get started on the Gilbert part of this equation.  its full, complete, and well done. His work with Mr Big is seriously good too, if a litte poppy, particularly their first two (I never got to hear too much of the later work.  enjoy, work the technque down to perfection, cleanly and slowly, then rip it up full speed when you're ready.  keep this vital part of intense rock alive and then, lift your goblets of rock!",1174608000,5,1353,4.265625
3126,5,0739040375,"I just got this dvd a few weeks back and I can already feel a noticable improvement in my technique.  In the first section, he goes over picking, 3-note per string scales, chromatic and harmonic minor licks, hammer - ons and pull - offs and different arpeggio techniques, including sweep picking and string skipping.  In the second section, he gives more practical applications of the techniques and offers insight on how to improve phrasing and how to practice soloing.  Paul is a great teacher and he will keep you interested both with his playing and his sense of humor.",1173744000,23,573,4.767676767676767
3127,5,0739040375,"I own every Paul Gilbert video that I am aware of.  These two volumes have dramatically improved my technique, speed, phrasing, picking, etc.  Paul is an amazing teacher.  He explains everything in depth so that even the novice guitarist will understand most everything covered.  I own many other videos including Yngwie, Vinnie Moore, Richie Kotzen etc.  None of the other videos can compete with the Paul Gilbert videos. I often watch Intense rock 1 and 2 as refresher courses or just for plain entertainment.  If shred is your game, then look no further.  Learn from the best!",1173398400,20,579,4.907216494845361
3128,5,0739040375,"This is the best purchase anyone can make if you want to shred being that finding a good teacher that can teach this skill is not easy. Paul besides being an incredible player covers all bases of Alternate Picking and String Skipping like he was in front of you. This is worth every singe penny. Now you have both instructionals on one DVD for the price of one!!!!

I own a vast array of instructionals, and if you only had 17 dollars to spend on a dvd, this is the best money you'll ever spent. Paul teaches shred like he was in front of you and believe me, no one posseses that skill. I also recommend his other instructionals after you are ready to move forward from this one Terryfying Guitar Trip, Get Out Of My Yard and his latest, Silence Followed By a Deafening Roar.

The video is very entertaining and packed with info that will help any guitarist no matter your skill set; the problem is, you won't be able to play the examples up to speed.

3142,2,0739040375,"Part 1 of this DVD is crammed with standard shred licks...but not much in the way of how, when and where to use them. In that respect, it's one of the more disorganized guitar instructional videos I've seen. Despite Paul's youth and enthusiasm,, the material gets relatively advanced rather quickly (and he can play the licks so fast and perfect, it's just as discouraging as inspirational).

In Part 2, he sporadically mentions things that would be aimed at relative beginners...which definitely doesn't belong on these videos.  On the other hand, Example #7 is so much more intricate/difficult than anything else on this disk, it seems out of place.  The best thing on the whole disk are the 2-note per string/string skipping arpeggios (wish I woulda started practicing those 10 years ago). There are a couple of other cool licks, but the video ends up a mess of a lot of talking...my mind wandered.

Before attempting to play along, you should already know all the major scale modes and the melodic minor scale.  Your alternate picking should already be very controlled/synchronized and you should be experienced with string skipping.  It also contains some extreme finger stretches/intervals that a lot of people might never be able to do (a shorter scale neck or extraordinary long fingers will come in handy here).

If you don't already have the skills mentioned above, I highly recommend Don Latarski's ""Guitar Theory Basics"" and Frank Gambale's ""Chopbuilder"" be bought first.  Sequentially, they'll introduce you to all the basic mode fingerings and get your alternate picking, control and speed somewhat closer to Paul's level.",1283126400,3,1636,5.12406015037594
3143,4,0739040375,"I've been playing guitar for years and years. Have many books, CD's, etc. This is my first on ""shred"" techniques... holy cow! It's like I'm back to square one.. but that's good.. basic techniques are well presented in logical format. I was able to move through some of this fairly quickly, in theory, but still working on speed speed speed! Wish there was TAB for Vol. 1, but I found that online. Vol. 2 tab is included in PDF on disk. Would be nice if there was something to paly along with, it's presented and you're off on your own to practice. All that said, it's a good bang for the buck... plenty of good techniques and lessons to work on for a long long time.",1267660800,2,666,4.2936507936507935
3144,5,0739040375,"Within a month I have already notice some serious improvements in my playing.  Particularly my picking is much cleaner.  Also, it's nice to add some more licks to my library...I was getting pretty bored with my playing for a while, but this video has revived my playing once again!",1267488000,2,281,4.714285714285714
3145,5,0739040375,"This video guitar lesson is for those who want to get a bit more technical into their repertoire. Intense Rock 1 has old school Paul (good old Racer X days) teaching us the basics of soloing, scaling and just good guitar playing overall. I like how he also incorporates funny skits in between sessions which is great cos learning guitar is meant to be a fun experience too (in his case anyways). Intense Rock 2 kinda builds on the first, introducing a few more patterns and sequences. Paul continues his humorous presentation keeping the audience awake and laughing. I play with a whammy bar so it's a bit of a shame PG doesn't like it too much but that's his playing style I guess.

Overall PG is a cool and fun down-too-Earth guitar teacher you won't be disappointed. Oh and did I mention he's the world's 4th fastest guitar player?",1258502400,,834,4.56

3147,3,0739040375,"I have been playing forms of rock/metal for a few years, but never really tried my hand at leads so I figured I would give this vid a shot.  I watched the video through a few times and obviously Paul is very good at what he teaches, but I got left in the dust right off the bat.  I eventually decided to focus on some of the easier patterns, memorize them and run though them everytime i pick up my guitar.  I am a lot faster now than before I started, but still nothing close to paul---even on the simple ones.  I would say this video is more for someone that can already play fairly fast and is either looking for more licks or wants to play faster.  Don't get me wrong it is a good vid, i just wish I were more up to speed when i bought it.",1223856000,4,743,3.9266666666666667
3148,3,0739040375,"I read good reviews about this guy and this video. I even saw some clips of him on youtube and that convinced me to buy this. However when I got it and watched it, I noticed he went too fast in his instruction for me to keep up. My biggest gripe is that he does not teach you the rudimentary techniques such as how to hold the pick so that you can pick as fast as he is. I found myself pausing the video a lot just to get the lick. The DVD comes with a printable PDF booklet (13 pgs). This is def not for beginners. It would have been better if he started out showing you how to use a metronome in shredding and subdividing notes. The included sample vid with John Petrucci (he shows you shredding with a metronome) was what this video should have been.",1216512000,2,753,4.060402684563758
3149,5,0739040375,"I'd already seen a few of the lessons online and there was no doubt on what I was in for.

A detailed shred of shredding. And Paul Gilbert is a fantastic teacher. And a great artist. He really rips apart his own technique and shows you the light... the rest is up to you. Whether you have the motivation to DO and practice consistently and accurately.

If playing fast is the real thing on your mind. Just pick up this DVD and hear your self transform in a matter of months.

I used to have this fear of speed. Thanks Paul for dispelling completely. And making it accessible for mere mortals. While I still am not sure I can ever get to the clarity levels that he has on his fast ones... I am definitely not scared anymore to attempt to play fast...

Thank you very much Paul Gilbert.",1213315200,3,784,4.241610738255034
3150,5,0739040375,"There'd be a lot more amazing guitarists in the world.  Intense Rock I is mainly directed at improving technique providing a lot of different 3-note-per-string, string skipping and sweep arpeggios sequences.  Paul does a great job at breaking these things down while giving us a taste of his goofy sense of humor, but for my money Intense Rock II is king.  Among other things Paul covers dynamics and control, and the last segment on practicing alone is worth the money.  Do yourself a favor and pick this up, your guitar will thank you.",1208736000,2,537,4.741935483870968
3151,5,0739040375,"Paul Gilbert is one of the best guitarists in the world. Lucky for us, he's also a really down to earth guy and is a great teacher. While all of Paul's DVDs are great, Intense Rock helps you lay the groundwork to play shred metal.
From the first simple exercise to the last terror lick, Intense Rock is an exercise in the development of shred technique. Paul is a great teacher who actually slows down the licks and explains how he plays them. He certainly isn't too haughty to forget what it was once like to be a student. Pair this up with Troy Stetina's shred masterpiece, ""Speed Mechanics for the Lead Guitar,"" spend most of your free time practicing, and you'll be able to shred. (There's no great secret to technique! It takes time, drive, patience, and belief in one self.)

John Petrucci's Rock Discipline is highly recommended as well, since Petrucci, while less wacky and attention-grabbing than Gilbert, is a great teacher as well. Although, I would say it's better for those who've already bettered there technique, and have, thus, seen some concrete rewards for their playing. The Intense Rock ( and Speed Mechanics, for that matter) exercises are very musical, and are therefore easier for the beginning shredder to practice for an extended period of time, than Rock Discipline which has a lot of (valuable) atonal exercises.",1206230400,5,1339,4.821739130434783
3152,5,0739040375,"Gilbert is a master player and instructor - and I think we all know that those two things don't necessarily go together.  His technique on this DVD is jaw dropping.  I really don't think it would be possible to alternate pick faster with the clarity Mr. Gilbert brings to the instrument.  Paul seems to have both sides of his brain fully developed - the artistic left side that rocks out with gut searing intensity and emotion, and the geeky analytical right side that can perfectly explain and break down why it all works.  I own literally thousands of guitar instructional materials that I've purchased over the last thirty years, and can honestly say that this DVD ranks in the top three.  If you are at all interested in shred guitar, you simply have to buy this.  Many of us paid $40 or more per VHS tape for the original videos (parts I and II), so this DVD is an amazing bargain at this price.  Thanks, Paul!",1204848000,4,915,4.475903614457831

For 20 years now he has been and continues to keep things easily understood that are essential in taking your technique to a new level.  As a player whom has been playing for 30 years now myself, Paul's breakdown of left and right-hand technique finally got me over the ""hump"" I had not been able to overcome most of my guitar playing days as I finally overcame a plateau and quickly saw noticable improvment in speed and accuracy as I finally got the metronome setting to click higher than ever and still growing.",1196899200,4,582,4.576923076923077

Couple this DVD with a book like Speed Mechanics by Stetina and you have all you need to start shredding. Paul is such a virtuoso shred player, he will blow you away with licks played at the speed of light!! He however slows  all these licks down and even shows every small detail in achieving these licks from alternate picking, sweeping, sequences, sweep-tap, legato and more!!You will also need a metronome and LOTS of practice time to learn these techniques. When you master them you won't regret it since you will playing with terrifying technique. If you want to play like Paul Gilbert and other master shredders out there, this is the DVD to start with.

As a guitar teacher and someone with 20 plus years playing experience, I can say that this is the best video on shred guitar technique. Volume 1 alone is well worth the price. My only issue(a VERY minor one) is that he doesn't talk about the metronome and its usage. But any good teacher can explane that in about 2 minutes.
 Volume 2 while not quite as shred heavy is still a great dvd to have(and just as important content). It concetrates more on phrasing, dynamics, rythmic ways of building phrases, etc. Don't worry, there is still plenty of shredding as well.
 These volumes are the best investments I ever made as a guitar player,teacher and student. Anyone who wants to learn how to shred, get this dvd package, and a book on music theory(or instruction by a teacher) and a good chord book and you'll have everything you ever need.
 Keep in mind, no matter what, you still have to practice(alot!!!!). No book, Dvd, or anything is going to MAKE you play well. If you are a beginner(or even advanced), you still have to work hard. However, this is a big help.",1187827200,31,1180,4.4036697247706424
7788305,5,0739040375,"I've been playing about 9 years myself and this DVD has improved my lead skills tremendously and I only finished intense rock 1! As stated in the title, I really don't recommend this for someone just starting out or even a few years into guitar. Everyone is different of course but the one thing you absolutely need to be able to do these licks at a fast speed is to know how to increase your speed. Yes you can learn the licks, but the point is to play them fast so they sound cool. My goal tempo for all the exercises were 16th notes at a minimum of 160bpm and sextuplets at 120bpm and I can say most of these exercises I did that and some even faster. My point is if you don't already know how to increase your speed or at least have an idea then the majority of the lesson might be dissapointing. Your time would be better spent learning how to play first like say the troy stetina methods. Speed mechanics is the best book I've ever seen on guitar and I've seen em all (hint hint) but if your just figuring out how to shred, these videos give you some great licks to practice and work up to speed.",1502409600,,1102,4.154205607476635
