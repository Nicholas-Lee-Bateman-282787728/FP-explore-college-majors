4483678,1,B004VPURWG,"This was the dumbest horror movie ever!  The fan club must be very young. The acting was bad the actors where lame, What else needs to be said.",1348099200,,143,4.107142857142857
4483679,4,B004VPURWG,"The Director's focused vision and interior understanding of her characters make this one of those movies which  repeated viewing reveals more and more.  Uneven in parts but the twins were luminous and I would love to see other directors draw out their obvious talent.  Angela Berliner was touched by Vivian Leigh and other worldly while Jordana Berliner played her more fully psychopathic character so well  and yet in such a feminine way that I wanted to see her same character reappear in other movies.  I'd like to see both work with various directors to bring out obvious depths.  One got the sense of the old time actresses.  Angela Berliner also had a small, amusing part in  Gonzo;  Life and Work of Thomas S. Hunter as the Taco stand girl in the middle of the movie. Historical pieces and comedy are also perfect for these young women.  A first promise film acting debut for two long time stage actresses that needs to be mentored and brought to viewing audience more fully.  Audiences loved them.",1344211200,2,1005,4.7514450867052025
4483680,4,B004VPURWG,"They were the best of psychos, they were the worst of psychos. Some holes in the story but, for the most part, a good movie about two slightly out of sorts young ladies.",1344124800,3,169,4.151515151515151
4483681,5,B004VPURWG,"I had no idea what to expect from this, and I think the opening credits scene set the stage pretty well for the type of film. I really didn't know where the movie was leading to. It was definitely a psychological horror. You see such different angles of the twins, you're not quite sure how they'll act in each situation. Or what will happen next, for that matter. This was very much worth watching. I don't think I'll ever see another movie quite like this.",1315094400,,458,4.4
4483682,5,B004VPURWG,"This film presents and delivers on so many levels, it DEMANDS to be watched again and again.  Want to watch a slasher film?  SG has it.  Want a coming-of-age story about juggling your heart and your dreams?  SG has it.  Want a twisted tale of sibling domination and conflict?  SG has it.  Love to bursting into laughter one moment, only to find yourself drenched in tears the next?  SG is for you.  Without revealing too much of this delightfully twisting and turning narrative about twin sisters who just cant' seem to see that assimilation isn't the death of the self, I CAN say that, no matter what you're into, Strange Girls will deliver in droves!

Do yourself a favor, buy this film.  Your brain will thank you with candy.",1315094400,,728,4.565891472868217
4483683,5,B004VPURWG,"I just watched this movie tonight, and my mind was blown!  I wasn't sure what to expect, but what I got was a fast paced, enthralling, twisted film about two very f'ed up sisters.  There's gore in it, but it's not gratuitous, it fits with the sisters ruined psyche's, and it's done creatively enough to not feel like your average slasher flick.  For me, this movie was more of a psychological horror though, because you get to see into their minds and how they view the world.

I don't want to give away spoilers, so I won't go into details, but I thought this was a refreshingly interesting horror flick that actually sucked me into the characters rather than the gory scenarios.",1311984000,3,680,4.549180327868853
4483684,5,B004VPURWG,Creative and disturbing!  I loved watching this movie at the film festival and now I'm excited to get a copy for myself.  The twins did a wonderful job with their characters as well as the directors and producers making sure to keep the audience on the edge of their seats!  Don't mess with the twins!,1311638400,5,301,4.4363636363636365
4483685,5,B004VPURWG,"This is most disturbing film and like all great slasher films filled with humor.  A perfect, old fashioned summer movie to take your date to.  I loved this movie - a film not like any other and a film type that they no longer make.  Filled with clever humor and subtle homages to Pittsburg and the horror film genre.  This is a cult classic for smart people who like the slasher genre.",1311638400,3,385,4.305555555555555
4483686,5,B004VPURWG,"I caught this little gem at the Hoboken Film Festival last year!  It's a gritty lo-fi twisted story about murderous twin sisters struggling in their relationship with the world and with each other.  The backdrop is the decaying industrial town of Pittsburgh.  If you're a campy horror fan, then this should definitely be in your library!  I can't wait to see it again!",1309910400,2,368,4.7936507936507935
4483687,5,B004VPURWG,varry intring it was good. these are some crazy twingdings,1438387200,,58,4.9
4483688,3,B004VPURWG,Interesting and strange.,1431820800,,24,7.333333333333333
4483689,2,B004VPURWG,"The writer of this movie has obviously borrowed from the story of the true-life Gibbons twins. This movie had its moments, but it went too much into the realm of sensationalism and gore. The premise is outstanding, the execution is poor. It could have been so much better.",1428278400,2,272,4.6875
4483690,4,B004VPURWG,Clever and offbeat. Well executed keeping my attention. Actors are great even though I don't know them and the plot is hilarious.,1427328000,,129,4.909090909090909
4483691,2,B004VPURWG,"I lasted 23 minutes wanted to give up after 5 but convinced myself to give it a chance.  I can't believe anyone rated this higher than two stars.  Horrible acting, storyline even the effects.",1424563200,,191,4.588235294117647
4483692,4,B004VPURWG,"Well...that was just weird but still good in a campy sort of way. The twins they chose were perfect for the parts, and the storyline kept me interested. I would put this one on my low-budget likable list and watch it again.",1422489600,,223,4.333333333333333
4483693,1,B004VPURWG,"I love twin movies. But the only thing that I liked about this movie was that it used real twins. I hate it when a movie uses one actress to play twins.

This movie looked really cheap, really poor quality, it was like watching old home movies. The background music was terrible and annoying. The acting was terrible. The plot was pathetic, boring, and slow. I kept feeling like, even though it was a horror movie, that it was supposed to be funny, but it wasn't funny or scary, and it made no sense at all. I watched the entire movie only because I love identical twins and I kept waiting for it to get better. The ending just left me hanging.

If you want to see an amazing horror movie with real twins, watch ""The Other"" which is about identical twin boys played by real identical twins, with a really good twist ending.",1420329600,3,823,4.337662337662338
4483694,5,B004VPURWG,"Low budget but, I LOVED IT!!!!  Nice and creepy.  Lots of fun getting weirded out.  The two twin actresses were great in their roles.  The landlady broke my heart when her daughter called.  I need to call mom more often!",1419552000,,220,4.4
4483695,5,B004VPURWG,"Worth every star...
Give it a chance,after the first 15 minutes, you won""t be able to turn away...",1416441600,,98,4.5
4483696,5,B004VPURWG,Compelling story that is told with strong visual appeal. The girls deliver. I was truly creeped out by the twins.,1405296000,,113,4.7
4483697,2,B004VPURWG,I don't like horror.  Friend thought it was original.  I did not see it myself...it was viewed through my Amazon account.,1400198400,,121,4.714285714285714
4483698,4,B004VPURWG,"Love movies like this! Weird, offbeat and fun to watch! These girls did a great job! Ignore the one and two stars...this is a gem and a keeper!",1396915200,,143,4.142857142857143
4483699,5,B004VPURWG,"After a doctor at the Mayfield Psychiatric Hospital hangs himself, his replacement arrives. Dr. Jessica Karp is introduced to the staff, and to the Gruczechy twins (Angeline and Jordana Berliner), Georgia and Virginia. They haven't spoken a word to anyone, except each other, for fourteen years. Dr. Karp takes on their cases w/ gusto. She reads up on their history, and their bizarre childhood together. Uh oh! After a sudden, tragic event puts an end to the good doctor, the twins are discharged and get their own place. The two find life outside to be... different. Many people are downright mean, especially their new landlady, who proceeds to piss the sisters off. She quickly realizes what a huge mistake she's made by doing so! When Virginia falls in love w/ a neighbor, Georgia is shut out, and becomes even more unhinged -and dangerous- than usual. STRANGE GIRLS certainly lives up to its title! The Berliners are incredible in their creepy, nutty roles. Unique in plot and subtly comical, STRANGE GIRLS is a classic of insane, off-kilter movie-making! Ya gotta love those twins!...",1390176000,6,1091,5.0

4483701,3,B004VPURWG,"WoW. What a couple of truly gifted, whacked  out set of twins.
That's all I can say without spoilers.
It's funny, yet so twisted.
Passed on it several times, had nothing else to watch, so, Strange Girls won.",1379116800,,207,4.447368421052632
4483702,2,B004VPURWG,Movie about two crazy girls which was poorly created. It was a disaster. Not worth watching if you value your time.,1373846400,,115,4.523809523809524
4483703,4,B004VPURWG,I love the actresses portraying the title roles.  I absolutely enjoyed the disparity in expressions and dialogues between their world and the outside world.,1360022400,,156,5.5
4483704,5,B004VPURWG,Fantastic! I kept thinking of the twins in the Shinning or the twins in The Great Outdoors. Grown up and finally killing lol!!! Well written campy cult movie.,1358553600,,158,4.678571428571429
4483705,5,B004VPURWG,The acting was pretty good and the storyline held my attention throughout. I was pleasantly surprised by this movie! I can see it becoming a cult classic.,1355011200,3,154,4.7407407407407405
4483706,3,B004VPURWG,"This is the type of quirky ""Young Psychos in Love"" type slasher film I normally fall in love with. However, that was not the case with this one. In this tale twins who are part time mutes get discharged from a mental institution and end up killing a bunch of people. Angela and Jordana Berliner star as Virginia and Georgia, our two psychopaths. While the acting was fine, their being mute lacked continuity. The script involving their love interest was weak and lacked good entertainment value.  Maybe I have just seen too many of these things as this appears to be a ""me too"" quirky slasher.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Angela and Jordana Berliner).",1352678400,,661,4.739130434782608

8443741,5,B004VPURWG,If you like out of the box disturbed realities than look no further. Being a twin myself I especially liked the darker aspect of this film. The twins have a dark compulsion that binds them to disturbing realities. Care to peak inside? Vanilla's beware this isn't the movie for you!,1468368000,,281,4.64
