180191,5,155783699X,"BEING NEW TO ACTING, THE DVD WAS EXTREMELY INFORMATIVE. IT WAS AS IF MICHAEL CAINE WAS PROVIDING AN INDIVIDUAL LESSON IN MY OWN LIVINGROOM. HE IS A LEGEND IN THE ACTING FIELD; HOWEVER, HIS INSIGHT/INSTRUCTION IS VERY VALUABLE; HIS PRESENTATION SIMPLE AND HE IS EXTREMELY PATIENT AND PRECISE. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!

180194,5,155783699X,This is one of the best film acting videos I've ever seen. It's a must see for aspiring actors. Michael Caine is a master.,1355184000,,122,4.125
180195,4,155783699X,"For a student of film acting, this DVD is a rare chance to get good, solid, practical advice from a successful working actor.  Mr. Caine presents information in a down to earth and entertaining way to both a panel of students and a studio audience.

My only complaint is that it should have run longer than 1 hour.  I realize that the production was bound by the restraints of the television series, but as a DVD release more could have been included.

Highly recommended as is Mr. Caine's companion book 'Acting In Film'.",1275350400,12,522,4.580645161290323
180196,5,155783699X,"I'm an actress - always on the lookout for fabulous things to inspire or teach me in my work.  Mr. Caine does both!  I love it so much, I have the book AND the DVD.  It's brilliant.",1231286400,6,181,3.8378378378378377
180197,5,155783699X,a terrific tape for student and teacher alike taught by a master actor who knows film acting,1176249600,4,92,4.470588235294118
7795905,4,155783699X,"A very informative -- and entertaining -- course in film acting, which shouldn't be surprising, since Michael Caine isn't just a great actor, he's also a great storyteller and teacher. It's at its best when he shows how little things -- a flicker of the eyes, a slight tilt of the head, a twitch here or there -- can say volumes.
I would have given this a five-star review, but my one complaint is it's much too short. It's only an hour long, and feels abbreviated; I could have gone all afternoon watching Mr. Caine showing the subtleties and nuance involved in acting for the camera. I still recommend this video very highly; I'd also recommend you buy the companion book. It goes into more detail about different aspects of a film actor's life, without the time constraints of the video. But the video captures little things that the book cannot. Put them together, and you have a solid five star review, well worth seeking out.",1505692800,,931,4.614457831325301
