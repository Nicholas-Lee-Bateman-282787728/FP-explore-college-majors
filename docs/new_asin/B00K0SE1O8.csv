8654975,3,B00K0SE1O8,"This ppv I have mixed feelings on no matter how many times I watch it.

Ultimate X - While I don't understand why TNA took 4 of their best wrestlers and former champions and used them for a 10-minute opening match, The match in itself is not bad, but just feels very under-welming.

Tag Team Title - This match was shockingly awesome. I didn't think it would but it turned into a great match! One of the best of this show.

Knockouts Title - Not bad, but nothing special

Roode vs. Angle - Angle refusing the HOF induction to me is just perplexing. Match that up with the weird finish of Angle being KOed after delivering an Angle slam only for Roode to win and the match is just weird. It's not bad, but the HOF thing before it and the end really kills it.

EC3 - Basically a weird squash match

Sting vs. Magnus - Unfortunately this match is not very good

World Title Match - This match is just awesome. While most of this show is just weird to watch, the main event is great. Very different from what you see in a TNA main event. 450 splashes through tables, the ring gets torn apart, and works towards a good storyline.

The Tag Title and World title matches are great, but the rest of the show is just odd to watch.",1404432000,,1221,4.210300429184549
8654976,4,B00K0SE1O8,"The 5 way Ultimate X for the X-Divison title(Manik vs Chris Sabin vs Austin Aries vs Jeff Hardy vs Samoa Joe) while still a decent high-spot fun-fest,the use of the ladder was disrespectful to the bout. The World Tag Team title match between GunStorm(Gunner & ""Cowboy"" James Storm) against The Bro-Mans(Robbie E & Jesse Godderz) was a pretty good & competitive bout. The 3 way bout for the Women's title(ODB vs Brooke vs Gail Kim) was mediocre with only the debut of Led'i Tapa being the only memorable thing about this match. The Kurt Angle-Robert Roode match was a good reminder of Kurt's bouts against Chris Beniot back in the WWE even with the odd finish. The Ethan Carter The Third-Norm Fernum match was just a filler bout to make EC3 look good even though Norm put up a better fight then we thought. The Sting-Magnus match was solid but could have better. The NO-DQ match for the Worlds title between Bully Ray & AJ Styles was a hardcore,smash-mouth,personal brawl. I give this PPV a 7 out of 10.",1399075200,,1002,4.603351955307263
8654977,4,B00K0SE1O8,"It should be noted that they showed various TNA career highlights of A.J. Styles throughout the night due to the fact that this was possibly his final TNA appearance.

Ultimate X Match: X Division Champion Manik vs. Austin Aries vs. Chris Sabin vs. Jeff Hardy vs Samoa Joe - This was Hardy's first Ultimate X Match (along with the debut of his new theme song) that featured such highlights as a suicide dive forearm that almost knocked one man over the announce table, a top rope head scissors into an over the top takeover, one man yanked off the cables into an inverted atomic drop, a race between climbing the cables & the ladder.  This was built as an ""All-Star"" match with all the names involved but for a match designed to be a ""daredevil spotfest"" & Hardy hyping up this as his first time ever in this match only to not do much during the match itself, it's disappointing.

Right around here was a segment where Bad Influence came out to protest their loss in the pre-show tag team gauntlet early only for Eric Young to come out & warn them that they ""created a monster"" leading to the dominate return of Abyss.

Tag Team Champions James Storm & Gunner vs. Bro-Mans - The Bro-Mans won the gauntlet on the pre-show to earn a tag title shot here while they had the 2013 Mr. Olympia bodybuilding champion Phil Heath in their corner that started with Storm & Gunner in control before Bro-Mans were able to take back control with a distraction working over one man keeping him away from his partner while also working behind the referees back as both teams traded momentum with Storm somehow having a big bleeding cut on his leg.  This was a solid encounter that more competitive than you would ever expect involving Jessie & Robbie E.

Right around here was another segment where Kurt Angle declined the TNA Hall Of Fame induction due to his professional & personal actions over the past year but promised to set a new standard before accepting it.

Knockouts Champion O.D.B. vs. Brooke Tessmacher vs. Gail Kim - Brooke & O.D.B. faced off against each other with each girl on the receiving end of either a stinkface or bronco buster as Gail was the odd woman out as she kept getting knocked out of the ring by each woman before Gail was able to force herself in control with her figure four around the ring post as both women all tried to ""kill two birds with one stone"" at one point with one woman delivering a top rope dropkick only to be hit by a top rope elbow when she landed & one knockout being samoan dropped onto the other.  This was a very good match with all three women working very hard but the bigger picture was the a knockout who made a her strong presence known in the match...literally.

Kurt Angle vs. Bobby Roode - A rematch from the Bound For Glory main event two years earlier that started out with Roode targeting Angle's neck early with a crossface submission attempt only for Angle to comeback at Roode later on with the anklelock only for Roode to roll out of it sending Kurt to the outside as Roode was able to stay one step ahead before Angle was able to finally gain control taking the match briefly to the outside only for Roode to once again work over the neck using the ring ropes & apron along with moves such as a strong clothesline & spinning neckbreaker as both men traded momentum with executing their own signature moves & submissions & tactics while also countering their opponents as well.  This was the most physical match of the night telling a great story in regards to Angle's neck & both men beating each other until one man just couldn't get up.

Norm Fernum vs. Ethan Carter III (EC3) - For those who don't already know, EC3 is the former Derrick Bateman from season 4 of WWE NXT while Fernum is Championship Wrestling From Hollywood's ""Pretty"" Peter Avalon who got one of the biggest pops of the night due to his long term history in southern California independent wrestling.  This was designed to be Dixie Carter's nephew making his debut on a grand stage (i.e. Fandango at WrestleMania) while being handed a jobber opponent to make himself look good which did the job it was designed to do as Fernum only got a small amount of offense in while Carter showcased himself along with his arrogant attitude but I always say these type of things should be saved for free TV & not an event people are paying for.

Sting vs. Magnus - Sting came into this match playing a small mind game wearing his UK-inspired t-shirt as both men started off having a gentleman's contest with Sting knocking Magnus out of the ring & holding the ropes open for him to come in with Magnus returning the favor when Sting was knocked out of the ring followed by clothesling Sting & turn out the intensity doing Sting's own pose & stinger splash with Sting returning it & telling him to ""BRING IT!""  They attempted to tell the story similar to what Sting had with Ric Flair back in 1988 where it was the veteran making a new star & in that sense it did it's job but this match was missing ""it"" to make it come off as that memorable moment.

No Disqualification/No Count Out Match: TNA Champion Bully Ray vs. A.J. Styles - Bully started out working over Styles' arm only for Styles to go for the calf killer early with a distraction allowing Bully to heavily beat him down chops only for Styles to once again get another advantage as the match got taken out to the floor with Bully delivering one hell of a knockout punch & Styles going for a 450 splash through a ringside table before Bully resorted to the tactics that helped him at Slammiversary exposing the boards underneath the ring mat along & getting some help that wasn't expected along with weapons such a chair coming into play.  This was a hard hitting match that took advantage of the stipulations & the environment around them.

Since this event is being released now over 6 months after it happened & seeing how much has changed since this show with top long term names like Sting & A.J. Styles leaving while Hogan left the company weeks earlier, elevation of other superstars like Magnus & Eric Young becoming World Champion, Joseph Park & Abyss finally realizing they're same person, end of Aces & Eights, Dixie Carter's heel turn, old & new faces returning...this marked the beginning of the end of an era in TNA.  In the end, this event does have some faults but had way more positives than negatives so it's one I would check out.",1398902400,,6424,4.504295532646048
