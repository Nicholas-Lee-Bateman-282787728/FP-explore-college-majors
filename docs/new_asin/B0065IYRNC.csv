8493413,5,B0065IYRNC,"This is one of those rare occasions where Amazon hasn't combined all the different versions of this film into the one rating and put all the reviews together.  You can find the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/download/dp/B0017L0GSM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">download</a>&nbsp;version and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/VHS-video/dp/6303234453/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">VHS video</a>&nbsp;page and their accompanying reviews by clicking on those links.  It's interesting how the video has higher ratings which of course was bought and reviewed closer to when this film came out (which was 1994).  The one on this page is the Australian release which obviously won't play on American DVD players if they aren't mutlizone capable.  Seems a few reviewers have voted the one on this page down because it's someone else's fault they didn't take the time to read the product page.

The Paperboy is part of the budget range of DVDs released to be sold in stores for a couple of dollars that aren't known for being DVD retailers such as chemists, discount stores (we generalise these various outlet sort of stores and call them $2 stores) and those types of retailers, where you see the DVD, read the case and think, well that's cheaper than renting a DVD so why not give it a go. There's no extras with these DVDs, it's just the film and is often the case with these old films the picture on the screen looks a bit squashed to try and fit a letterbox type original look into modern widescreen TV format. There's still some black bars down both sides though. These movies are usually a couple of decades old ones that weren't that successful their first time round but have a former TV star who is forced to be in whatever work they can get, or has a more successful movie star who did the movie in their younger days before they had choices.  This actor isn't necessarily the main character (actor) in the film but their name goes on the DVD cover.  In the case of The Paperboy, that actor is Alexandra Paul, she wasn't the reason you watched Baywatch every week, but she was in the show.  She plays the daughter of an old woman murdered in her home by the next door neighbour, who wanted a reason to bring her back to town.  That neighbour is Johnny, and he's just a little kid.  Johnny is brilliantly played by a kid actor named Marc Marut.  This kid knew how to play a creepy not mentally all there kid, who could put on a pleasant I'm your best friend or feel sorry for me demina at the same time. He looks like your wholesome kid from decades long before this and can put on that Ferris Bueller type smirk to get away with all sorts of things.  I think if this film had somehow got a wider audience this actor would have gone on to become a star, but its seems other than a Goosebumps episode and a few other things around the mid nineties he didn't get to be in much.  That is a real shame, as I've never seen any better creepy kid in a movie than this one.  There's also a creepy old lady in the film played by Frances Bay who you'll recognise as the ""give it to me you old hag"" woman Jerry wrestles and steals the bread from before running down the street in Seinfeld.

Basically Johnny wants a new mum and sees Alexandra Paul's character as the ideal replacement.  She also has a daughter younger than Johnny who Johnny accepts straight away as his sister.  This is his family and anyone who does anything to ruin it, will be dealt with!

This is well and truly worth the price of a dollar or two if you've come across it amongst the budget DVDs.  Even Alexandra Paul doesn't do that bad a job in this one, in fact the acting by everyone in the film is above the usual standard you'll find in this range.  The script isn't that bad, sure it's predictable in parts, there's aspects like surely they would notice the baby monitor as it's pretty clearly visible and things like that, but if you want a good creepy kid thriller, The Paperboy is the way to go.",1451865600,2,4049,4.7001414427157

8493417,4,B0065IYRNC,With dogged determination (a phrase that should be used in this context) the film slugs on and on and on overdoing all the way to its overdone conclusion. If the lead boy had any talent or future this film would surely have assassinated both.,1397952000,,242,4.5227272727272725
8493418,1,B0065IYRNC,This movie showed dark. Sound was not really clear. Background sound like waves or static. Don't look like an original copy. DVD constantly stopped  and doesn't start back all the time. Only got through 30 minutes of movie. Will be requesting refund!!!!,1397520000,,253,5.023809523809524
