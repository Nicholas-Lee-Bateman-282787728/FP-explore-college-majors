5958254,5,B00EZAIPE4,It was a gift to someone who wants to visit all 50 states and only has a few left to do.  Idaho is a gorgeous state and making choices about where to go are difficult because of the variety.  I am sure this will 'confuse' the issue and bring to the fore so many lovely spots that it will end up being one of the longest trips of the 50!,1404432000,,336,3.7857142857142856
