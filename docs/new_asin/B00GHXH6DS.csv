6077257,3,B00GHXH6DS,"A bit disappointing as it comes across as more of a Neil Oliver travelogue than a coherent historical analysis of the Vikings.  The historical background is somewhat superficial and the camera focuses more on Oliver than any of the potentially fascinating evidence of this great culture.  I would say the box illustration and title do not help as they merely perpetuate the ridiculous stereotype of the Vikings that Oliver does little here to dispel.  I have a great interest in this subject and was expecting a much better effort than what I see here.  A poor follow up to Oliver's ""History of Scotland"".",1419638400,8,605,4.844660194174757
6077258,5,B00GHXH6DS,"Informative and well done, the best documentary I have seen on the Vikings.  Neil Oliver does not disappoint, a must see for all interested in learning more about the Norse and their culture. If you like this, check out Neil Oliver's books as well.",1419638400,8,248,4.636363636363637
6077259,5,B00GHXH6DS,"Excellent show about the Vikings. the cover though is silly as Vikings never wore horned helmets. The narrator really goes into depth about the Vikings who were great adventurers and traders. They even founded Russia. But he doesn't forget that they were also monstrous when raiding and killing people. Often whole towns would be butchered.  The real wealth though was with slaves and that's what a smart Viking would go for.  This show has three high budget episodes where our narrator travels to all the locations he's talking about. And he gives us the story of the Vikings from the pre Viking days to their 300 years as rampaging warriors, traders, and explorers, and settlers.  This is a big story but it's handled well. This does NOT recreate the stories and  history that is being talked about though. This is a GREAT informative history show that gives you a lot of info that is interesting and well done.",1406246400,17,913,4.7594936708860756
6077260,5,B00GHXH6DS,this dvd was very informative and opened my eyes to the contributions of the Vikings and the discoveries and creations.,1403568000,7,119,5.0
6077261,2,B00GHXH6DS,"I looked at the other reviews and ordered this DVD, but was let down by what I received. There is some Scottish guy, with shoulder length hair and natty clothing doing almost all the narration and his narration is pretty much all of the show. He doesn't look right for the part. His schtick is that he travels from England to Bergen, Norway to illustrate a major point that he is narrating. After that he might travel to the Shetland Islands or the Orkneys or to Iceland or to Denmark or to Gotland or to Oslo or to York. Sometimes the scenery is somewhat interesting, most of the time it is ho-hum. The maps used to illustrate his travels are laughably simplistic and sometimes the red lines used to show his destinations overshoot the actual target by a noticeable amount.
  There are lots and lots of shots of today's people walking around, usually in a shop, mall, street, market, train station or beach. Usually  some of them have red or blond (i.e. Viking-coloured?) hair. This is not very informative or to the point. A couple of times the Scottish gypsy dude makes purchases in markets and pays cash. Big deal and again, this has what? to do with Vikings?? Don't buy this garbage - a few dug-up skeletons and a scene of him eating rotten shark can't save this boring, tepid dribble. This is the the dullest BBC DVD I have purchased - you would be better served buying a well-written book about the Vikings, so look around for one.",1402444800,6,1438,4.523076923076923
6077262,5,B00GHXH6DS,"Item just as described, I have nothing bad to say about it since it follows the book and does a good job",1400112000,,104,3.772727272727273
6077263,5,B00GHXH6DS,"WOW!  I'm so glad I bought this DVD.  I'll be watching it many times.  The presenter is very good, full of personality, and has a knack for explaining his knowledge.  The sites are authentic, the museum pieces are beautifully presented and explained, even the habitat and diet of the Vikings, their religion, burial practice...nothing left out.  I can't say enough about this fascinating video.",1399766400,11,394,5.09375
6077264,5,B00GHXH6DS,A great documentary on the Vikings. Was very educational and interesting. I would recommend it for anyone interesting in history.,1397779200,,129,5.5
6077265,5,B00GHXH6DS,"Received this DVD in the mail a couple days ago. It was way better than I expected. Extremely well done by the BBC. High budget documentary. Takes you on locations in Denmark, Norway, Iceland, and Sweden. The Narrator is excellent. The production with any other narrator would be good because it is a high quality film with a lot of detail. But the narrator puts this documentary over the top because he is extremely good. This is a documentary that I will watch many times to catch all the details. Very glad that I bought this BBC production. The best Viking documentary that I have ever seen. And I have seen most of them. Tom in San Diego.",1394928000,32,643,4.4576271186440675

8623422,5,B00GHXH6DS,"On this DVD you will find three shows hosted by Neil Oliver who seems very knowledgeable about history and the life of the Vikings. I found the three shows to be educational and entertaining.

You will see footage from Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Britian, Iceland and Greenland. It was also very interesting to learn about trade routes and how even a Buddha statue and silk ends up in the possession of the Vikings.

Mostly we get to see treasures that were buried with Vikings and there is a lot of analysis of skeletons which was surprisingly intriguing. Neil Oliver is after all a archeologist at heart. He takes you around to various archeological sites and explains everything in a manner that is intellectually entertaining.

What fascinated me the most was the Viking ships. You'd be terrified if you saw one heading towards your village. So a lot of time is spent either in the countryside or in museums. There are beautiful crowns and other jeweled items to be seen as well.

I felt like my time was well spent as I learned so much about history that no one else has ever taught me before. I didn't realize that Vikings made a transition from pagans to Christians in just a few hundred years.
