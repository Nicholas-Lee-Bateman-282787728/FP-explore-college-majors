If you were an old fan, this is a great introduction to the new stuff.  If you are just seeing the new episodes on comedy central (which are better than ever) this should be what you watch next. Bonus points if you are familiar with D&D, there are a few great references in there (but you don't have to know that game at all to love this movie).  Buy it.

Bender flips out as he exercises his imagination playing a Dungeons & Dragons board game, and has a difficult time reconnecting with reality.  Leela has problems with her temper.  Fry continues to be himself, which is not saying very much.

Add a dash of Lord of the Rings satire, and you've got a movie length version of Futurama.  Fans will rejoice.  Futurama detractors will feel the curse of dark matter, which disappears as a fuel source following this movie (is this good or bad for Nibbler?).

With Bender hooked on the popular role-playing game, Fry and the rest of the gang try to get to the bottom of a dark matter shortage. What they find on the way is surely going to rock their world! A tribute to Gary Gygax, the late creator of Dungeons and Dragons, the movie also makes references to Star Wars and Star Trek, the latter with a guest appearance by George Takei!
All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the animation does come alive)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.
The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all excellent!
Following the cancellation of the show (I wonder what ""genius"" came up with that idea???) life was pretty hard without these amazing characters. The comic books are good, but nothing beats the actual show, so it's so good to have everybody back.
Strongly recommended along with the other three Futurama films: Bender's Big Score, The Beast with a Billion Backs, and Into the Wild Green Yonder.

This movie was entertaining.

Pros:  New jokes, fun adventures, reflects contemporary mentality/social behaviors/politics.

Cons: plot holes and overlapping back stories.

The thing about the plot holes and back stories, only a fanboy would care, thus the reason why include it in my review.

Aside from that, Bender's Game is by far the best Futurama movie.

Key notes for why I liked the movie:
1.  Roberto is in it and says one of his best lines
2.  Mom's youngest son has the best re-occurring one-liner in the first half of the movie.
3.  Plenty of VERY NERDY references.

UPDATE 12/10:
Rewatching the movies, love them all.  How did any of you let me get away with saying anything bad about this movie?!?!  5 Stars!",1235347200,,778,4.7593984962406015
3543844,4,B001DZOC46,"""Bender's Game was a pleasant surprise.  Although a huge fan of Futurama, I found the previous movies lacking in the quality that the series managed to maintain throughout it's 4 year run, but Bender's game proves that the crew is up to the task of producing more episodes comparable to their previous run.  Futurama was really cancelled before it had ron its course and I look forward to more movies and/or episodes.",1234742400,,417,4.777777777777778
3543845,2,B001DZOC46,"I'm a huge Futurama nerd so it pains me to give this movie only two stars. I really wish I would have liked it more. I tried... the first time I was confused. ""The first two were so good, there has to be some sort of mistake or something"" I thought. I thought maybe I was missing something. I watched it again. UGH - still not funny. A third time... pretty much decided I could never watch it again.

The problem with ""Bender's Game"" seems to be the fact that they wanted to include as many nerdy references to nerdy things as they possibly could, but in doing so they left out the original formula that made the show so good. The plot of this movie is strange and follows and A & B sort of thing... two separate story lines happening at the same time. The main problem is when they try and join the two together... it just gets confusing and weird.

I like Lords of The Rings and all, but I don't think that and Dungeons and Dragons should make up 50% of a plot of a Futurama movie. Throw a few good jokes in there but let's keep it at that. And not only that there were a few strange moments in the movie that they seemed to include for all the DIY Futurama porn perverts out there. It was a funny joke to have a nude plan in the first one but having Amy and Leela make out seems pathetic.

I have hope for the next film because I found the first two to be brilliant, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was another let down. I hope they go out with a bang though, because it's their last chance.",1234569600,,1496,4.047297297297297

3543847,3,B001DZOC46,"I was ready for Bender's Game to be over about 40 to 45 minutes in.  There just isn't enough comedy, certainly not enough laugh out loud comedy, in the DVD for me.  The production value of Bender's Game is great as the film looks and sounds wonderful.  But looks and sound just aren't enough to carry a Futurama movie 80+ minutes without substantial jokes.

Overall, Bender's Game isn't something that I'll need to watch again.  Mind you, I'm not saying it was bad, rather that it is more forgettable and didn't grab my attention like the first movie did.",1233792000,,555,4.565656565656566

I am sitting around enjoying this movie then they decide to dump all the characters into a Lord of the Rings spoof with a paper thin explanation.  Last time I checked, this was a Science Fiction series.  The worst part is the first 20 minutes of the show is probably some of the best pacing and writing out of the 3 DVD releases so far.  If you watched the first 20 minutes of this movie then skipped to the last 5 minutes to complete the storyline; it would probably be one of the best episodes of Futurama.  Instead, we are stuck with a Lord of the Rings parody that no one asked for or wanted to see.",1233792000,2,697,4.133333333333334

Indeed, I actually laughed out loud several times during this movie which is more than I can say for ""Beast."" However, the plot here is flimsy, especially when transitioning from one dimension to another without any type of realistic explanation. True, it is a comedy show and we can suspend some disbelief, but the beauty of Futurama lies in the solid strings it still attaches to science, which makes the science fiction all the more fun. While this film was worth a couple of laughs, it had me pining for the series to return with tighter writing, less filler, and memorable episodes that keep us clamoring for anything Futurama. As a feature length film it just isn't working. Since I own all the episodes and films to this point, of course I will order the upcoming last film in the series. But I feel already that it is going to be a relief to be finished with this phase of Futurama. I earnestly hope that someway, somehow, the series can land once again rather than resorting to another failed experiment like these feature length films.",1233705600,,1147,4.655172413793103

It seems like the writers have given up on many of the things that made the show so great, namely the overarching plot and the pseudo science. The long-running themes are once again shattered, this time mostly concerning the Nibblonians. And the pseudo science that the writers usually attempt seems to be lazy in this movie, especially when they are trying to tie in why the entire cast turns into a Lord of the Rings parody for half the film. But if you ignore the plot holes and the lack of continuity to the rest of the series, the movie is not half bad. Like I said, its quite funny, but maybe they are still trying to figure out how to combine the storytelling and the humor into one package still. Some would say the movie format just does not work as well for Futurama, but I tend to believe the show will just never be the same as it was before it got pre-maturely cancelled. I just have to live with a lesser, but entertaining, Futurama world.",1232496000,,1067,4.366834170854271

*Spoilers*

Oh, man, what happened here? I'm a huge Futurama fan, but it was a struggle to finish this latest installment. Someone needs to tell the Futurama folks that just because something is a movie, that doesn't mean it absolutely must be ninety minutes long.

It feels like there were a couple of decent ideas here, one involving Dark Matter and a Mom Monopoly (two standard favorite Futurama topics) and a second one involving a D&D style storyline. It's somewhat telling that the D&D aspect of the movie, which was featured so heavily in the previews because - let's face it - D&D is awesome, only occurs in the last half of the film and feels like a forced overlay of ""D&D plus whatever else the movie was about"" rather than a natural progression of the plot.

I think that bears repeating: If you are hyped about this movie for the D&D aspects, be aware that they don't occur until the last half of the movie, at which point you will be drowsy from boredom, and even then the D&D aspects fail to inject the excitement necessary to save this movie from itself. So if you really want to see Futurama D&D, skip directly to the relevant chapter and save yourself a headache.

I love Futurama, but I'm wondering if we've jumped the shark at this point. Maybe I've just watched too much, but the plot twists were too predictable, and the ""twist"" at the end was obvious from the first twenty minutes of the movie. There is also WAY too much verbal mugging at the camera, such as when Nibbler wonders why no one is surprised that he can talk, and the characters inform him that he forgot to blank their minds after the last Nibbler episode. This aside takes the casual watcher out of the movie (""What are they talking about?"") and makes the non-casual watcher wince at the overly rabid fan-boy aspect of it - we didn't really NEED a wink-and-a-nudge that the writers forgot to do the mind-blank last time, so now we're cleaning up our mistake to satisfy the pedantic viewers.

This version provides a closed caption option for the hard of hearing. I do not own this movie - I rented this through my Blockbuster Online account.",1232409600,6,2165,4.56701030927835
3543875,2,B001DZOC46,"what a huge shame.  i actually didn't really rate the first movie that highly but quite enjoyed the second.  this latest one, however, has about 20 minutes of great material followed by what seems like endless boredom and bad, family guy style, 'running the joke in to the ground' jokes.

hopefully the 4th installment isn't like this because this one, apart from the start is just plain BAD",1232323200,,391,4.720588235294118
3543876,4,B001DZOC46,"As far as the recent Futurama movies go, I think this is the best. It has the feeling of an episode more than the previous two did. I love the original series and am glad that it hasn't disappeared all together, but I also think that they should just quit messing around and start making episodes again.
 Anyway, Bender's Game is funny and worth the buy if you like Futurama. I also bought Bender's Big Score, which I recommend as well, but Beast with a Billion Backs was just not good; in my opinion, not worth the buy. Bender's Game showcases alot of my favorite characters and the Dungeons and Dragon's aspect of it cracked me up. Pretty good, overall.",1231977600,,655,4.458333333333333
3543877,4,B001DZOC46,"The Futurama crew is back, and boy are they odd.  This adventure tries not to wreck your mind too much with all the fancy plot and character development and gets right to the funny.  I rather enjoy this return to style that they have missed from the previous movies.

Futurama movies have always had a problem, not enough plot for a movie, thusly leaving a gaping plot hole, down which is crammed seemingly arbitrarily side-plots that somehow morph into the main story through some turn of events.  This movie is no different in that respect.  However, it does manage to make you laugh, and that is what this is all about, isn't it?

I always enjoy Futurama and I hope beyond hope that some large company somewhere decides to front these folks the money to keep making these episodes for years to come.  Also, don't forget to try the Genetics Lab on the DVD, it's a short but fun time-waster.",1231718400,,892,4.5375
3543888,2,B001DZOC46,"I love the Futurama series, but after the first season the quality and frequency of the jokes seemed to fluctuate a lot, and this trend has continued in the movies. While I usually take the good with the bad, with Bender's Game there just wasn't enough good to make the taking worthwhile.

The basic problem is the subject matter. ""Role-playing geeks are lame"" seems to be the rallying cry, and do we really need anyone to tell us that? I don't see the point in satirizing something that's already been so thoroughly mocked. You might as well make a comedy about fat people or mothers-in-law. And yes, I realize that both those things HAVE been done, and recently, but that doesn't make it okay.

D&D-related material aside, the jokes are few and far between. I laughed a couple of times (hence the second star), but I spent an awful lot of time wincing too. At one point, Fry (transformed into a dragon) confronts Mom (also a dragon) with the challenge ""You're no match for me"" (or words to that effect). Mom then breathes fire at him which singes his wings off. What does he say next? ""Whoa. Maybe you are a match for me."" I'm sorry, but even the Cosby kids couldn't get away with a line that lame.

Finally, there's the plot, or lack thereof. One of the things I most liked in Bender's Big Score (my favorite of the movies so far) was the way the writers kept careful track of all the time-travel paradoxes and used them to create a story that made perfect sense (sort of). They took no such care in Bender's Game: their explanation for the gang's journey through a medieval fantasy land was feeble even by Futurama standards. And yes, I know that flimsy explanations are supposed to be part of the fun, but I think in this case it would have been nice to have some sensible reason why the whole movie happened.

Finally, to make matters worse, they don't tie anything up at the end. Is Bender still insane? And if he is, doesn't that sound like something viewers would care about? It's not a cliffhanger in the ""to be continued"" sense; more like the ""we hope to hell you don't remember how the movie started"" sense. From a comedy team that usually manages to be smart and funny at the same time, it's disappointing to see a movie which is neither.",1231632000,2,2251,4.469586374695864
3543889,4,B001DZOC46,"If you like Futurama and Lord of the Rings, you will probably like the latest movie.

3543890,2,B001DZOC46,"I like that it is high-def, but the movie it's self was really lame. There wasn't any of the sparkle of any of the other Futurama straight to dvd movies. It felt like them mentioning imagination was enough to not have any in the movie. If you like Dungeons and Dragons a lot, you might like it more. Maybe I missed some of the inside jokes or something.

3543894,1,B001DZOC46,I thought the first Futurama movie was excellent and the second was pretty good so I went ahead and bought the third before renting it.  I regret that.  It just wasn't funny.  At all.,1231027200,4,183,4.323529411764706
3543895,4,B001DZOC46,"Futurama was under-appreciated in its time, and I'm glad that it's experiencing a rebirth of sorts.  I didn't watch it when it was on the air - it was at the same time too much like The Simpsons, and yet not enough like The Simpsons.  In the past four years, however, I've purchased all four seasons of Futurama on DVD, and love each and every episode.  The show was GENIUS.  The stories are hilarious, irreverent, cynical, hopeful, and even sentimental.  The characters are wonderful, and the concepts mind-blowing.  I think I enjoy it especially now, in a world where the Simpsons have fallen so low, to such a terrible show, it's nice to remember the genius of the creators, and what once was.

I was ecstatic when I heard that Futurama was coming back, in four movies, to be staggered over a few years.  The first two movies were okay.  They both started out strong, then lagged in the middle, but were able to pull it out in the end.  They seemed too long, as though it was the extra time that made the story lag - as though it would have been perfect for a 30-minute episode, but that the writers just stretched it out to fill time.  Why is that?  Is Futurama somehow better geared towards a 30-minute time slot?  Is that the perfect amount of time - neither too much, nor too little?

It's possible.  All I know is that the first two movies were a little too long, and they left too much space in the middle for the view to become confused and/or bored.  But, as I said, each movie managed to pull itself together in the end.  Because of that, I guess I can say that I liked them.  I enjoyed them, because they're a beautiful reminder of Futurama, but I didn't love them.  And there's a difference.

""Bender's Game"" was a little different than the first two movies.  It was held together better, it was tighter, and more fluid.  Unfortunately, it too lagged a bit in the middle, but far less than the first two movies.  I hope that this is a sign that the Futurama writers are getting their act together again after so many years off.  You know how it is, it takes a TV show a season or so to get its bearings, to find it's sense of self.  Just think about Seinfeld, Friends, or Sex and the City, and even The Simpsons - when you re-watch the first seasons, it's a little weird.  The characters aren't full formed yet.  It's conceptual, but not yet real.  That's what I'm hoping is going on with the Futurama movies.  Hopefully these first few ones are just for the writers to get back in the game, (Bender's game?), and to flex their writing muscles to produce something even greater.  Hopefully the final movie will be as wonderful as the series was, and will ensure that more movies are made.",1230595200,2,2702,4.389112903225806
3543896,2,B001DZOC46,"I've been a long-time fan of futurama. The TV series has always been great. I'm also a big fan of blu-ray, so my expectations were high.
The movie disappointed me greatly. It has quite a few funny bits, and the great small and easy-to-miss anecdotes and gags that I've come to expect from Futurama are there as well. But the movie as a whole is just.. boring.. not very funny.. not even original in any way..
I've come to expect more. At most - rent this thing and see I was right. Not worth the money.",1230508800,,502,4.239583333333333

3543908,1,B001DZOC46,"The transition from show to film after a two year break, was not seamless. 'Bender's Big Score' felt like a never ending story, with nowhere to end.'The Beast With a Billion Backs', whilst not being flawless, managed to rekindle the Futurama style of humour and fun. This movie, however, was unlike either of the two.

'Bender's Game' gets off to a brilliant start, and a satisfactory (if somewhat unfinished) ending. However, after the firtst 20 minutes, the jokes grow scarce, and an uncharacteristic level of blood and violence is introduced. To make matters worse, 'potty humour' was too, something far below what Futurama has acheived in the past. The simplistic plot (following the Planet Express Crew to the fantasy realm of Cornwood) should have made matters simple. However, there a several points where the movie seems as though its lost, such as when the professor and Nibbler give a long flashback, which adds nothing to the story.

It was obvious the writer(s) had something special,after their superb opening. Yet the following script, crammed on shelves in time for Christmas, proves that Matt Groening and his team don't know what made this funny, and are lost. I loved Futurama, but this isn't it. They've had three chances, and a heck of my money. Their next adventure is one I won't take on, before my memory of Futurama is entirely tarnished.",1230336000,5,1362,4.943231441048035

3543912,5,B001DZOC46,"I'm with the crowd on this one: Bender's Game is definitely the best of the Futurama films so far, and a great breath of fresh air after Beast With a Billion Backs. On this one, the random unexpected jokes (like the Swamp Hag) come fast and frequently, and it's definitely the ""Futurama"" humor that was missing last time (though it could do with about a half-dozen fewer vomit jokes). I'm not a Dungeons & Dragons fan, and I was pleasantly surprised it's a very small part of the plot, less than I would have guessed from the preview in ""Beast."" And none of the jokes are obscure references for game-nerds only (though I imagine some have more depth for people who know D&D). Best of all: No musical number in this one. The ""Bender's Piracy Warning"" special feature is funny too -- it's only about a minute long but tops any of the features on the last DVD.",1229558400,,857,4.430379746835443

3543914,3,B001DZOC46,"I'm the target audience for Bender's Game.  A lifelong gamer of over two decades (yeeck, I'm getting old), I also know and love the book by Orson Scott Card, Ender's Game.  With the title alone, the Futurama writing staff is clearly letting me know this is the movie for me.

Bender's Game starts promising, with jokes about the rising cost of fuel prices. There's also a sly joke about Leela's anger issues, which are controlled by a shock collar.  A shock collar Leela starts to find ... titillating.  Just when things get interesting and this plot point could turn into something awkward and funny, it's dropped.

Bender discovers that he has no imagination and, aggravated that he can't participate in a game of Dungeons & Dragons, flips out Mazes & Monsters-style, renaming himself Titanius and wandering the sewers.  He then gets sent to the HAL institute, Arkham Asylum for robots.  This plot point is pursued to a point and then dropped.

Meanwhile, Mom (that's her name) has been controlling dark matter prices for years, but there is a means of invalidating her stranglehold on fuel prices.  Professor Farnsworth accidentally invented ""anti-backwards matter"" which, should it ever encounter dark matter, would render dark matter useless.  It just so happens that this anti-backwards matter is a 12-sided die.  Hilarious, right?

As our lovable misfits build towards a confrontation with Mom and her Killbot goons, reality shifts and suddenly everyone's in a parallel fantasy dimension.  And then we get, in descending order of comedic value: D&D jokes, Greek myth jokes, Lord of the Rings jokes, Star Wars jokes, Call of Cthulhu jokes, and did I mention the Lord of the Rings jokes?

There's actually more interesting material on the extras, covering all the allusions to D&D that have appeared in Futurama and confirming that the guys who write the show are hopeless geeks themselves.  Unfortunately, they're not really boosting their own geek cred with this movie.

Look, I love Futurama and I love D&D.  But this movie is all over the place, using tired, easy jokes for fantasy.  I always identified Futurama as a series of in-jokes for sci-fi and tech geeks, which is a much broader category than fantasy gamers.  The bizarre diversion into the fantasy realm isn't well thought out, isn't particularly funny, and not all that interesting.

To describe Bender's Game without spoiling it for anyone, you could think of this as a Futurama's ""Anthology of Interest"" which featured some of the best of Futurama. Also, Bender's Game reminded me of the one Roswell episode. Overall the movie was very pleasing and this time around they hit the Futurama formula right on the head.

BBS, while perhaps not having that many of the laugh out loud moments, was concise and well put together and I loved it, it's actually my favorite of the movie releases so far.  BwaBB was just plain funny with a few parts that made me want to pee myself.  I think Bender's Game misses on both of those aspects.  It has some funny moments, but really feels like a jumble of episode ideas that never made it previously and it doesn't flow well at all.

Aside from problems with cohesion, the funny moments are pretty few and far between.  Fry had a very minimal part in this movie, and his little stupid one-liners are one of my favorite parts of the show/movies.  I almost don't remember what he even did in this one.  Most of the story revolves around Bender, which wouldn't normally be a bad thing, but in this case his part of the ""story"" just felt out of place and wasn't very funny at all.  His foray into Dungeons and Dragons and the inevitable fantasy parallel universe side plot just weren't funny and took up too much of the movie's time.  The plot about the dark matter shortage was kind of funny and it explained a big part of Futurama continuity (even tying in some of the past episodes, as this show commonly does so well) but the fantasy segment had absolutely nothing to do with it, and when that part was done, the original plot thread just continued almost as if nothing had changed.  So basically it was like there was a 30 or so minute interruption in a movie that was only mildly funny to begin with.  Also, another con about Bender's Game is the definite lack of Zapp Brannigan.

So it is with regret that I give this only three stars, and the extra star is just because it's Futurama.  Now here's where I become a little hypocrytical: do I recommend getting this?  Yes!  Why?  Because it's Futurama! Give them your money so they will continue making more! I'll let them have a dud as long as what they continue to bring us later will be up to my usual standard for the show.  The preview for Into The Wild Green Yonder definitely looks like it'll be back on track.

So while this one might have some lost opportunity, it's still Futurama and this is still one of my favorite TV shows of all time.",1228262400,,2317,4.346511627906977
3543932,4,B001DZOC46,"Of the three Futurama ""movies"" currently available, this one is by far the superior product.  Biting sarcasm (thanks, Bender), an actual plot line, and a pop-culture skewering satire of ""Lord of the Rings"" make this Futurama at its best.  Hermes as a hermaphroditic centaur? Why not? Keep 'em coming lads, and remember that Dungeons and Dragons is Bad for You!",1228176000,,360,4.983333333333333
3543933,2,B001DZOC46,"Okay, this was not what I expected.

Everything was just fine in the beginning. It had funny jokes such as the Robot Nut House, and the Demelition Derby. It was all good...until they got into the fantasy part of the movie.

That part got weird and gross and they just repeated the same things. When they explained how the Prof. created Dark matter, or Ignor's ""Big shocking"" (not really) secret, they would explain it in the 1st act, then when they got into the fantasy world, they would explain it again.

I just felt like it was just dragging on. What happened to the episodes of Futurama that are humorous, get to the point, and have a bit of emotion.

Do not buy this. It's worth a rent if you're real curious, but not a buy.",1228176000,3,729,4.338235294117647
3543934,1,B001DZOC46,"With the exception of the first movie Bender's Big Score, the Futurama movie formula has shown (sadly) that it just doesn't work. Both Bender's Game and the even worse Beast with a Billion Backs feel like exercises in padding out an episode to make it reach that magic 90 minute running time. When do we get to the plot??!! - I kept asking myself as I watched these last two installments, as pointless diversion built upon pointless diversion. The simple and sad fact is that these movies feel like a Futurama episode with all the deleted scenes left in. And there are other writing problems too - where is the character development, or humor that comes from the characters? Bender's Game has an interesting message about fuel shortages, but that just gets buried in all the padding - the entire dungeons and dragons fantasy bit is a complete detour from the plot. And unlike the first film, which delved into Leela and Fry's relationship, Bender's Game gives us zilch, while the previous movie just undermines the first one by having Fry forget all about his love for Leela. In Bender's Game, even Bender goes off on some pointless detour in search of his imagination - somewhat ironic considering the quality of writing here. Futurama fans, Fox simply isn't going to commission more of this, or a feature-film - not after seeing the last two films. The only way to save Futurama is to campaign for a fresh season of episodes - that is where Futurama belongs and that is where it shines. If they wanted to stick to this formula, they could release DVD sets of four episodes at a time. These movies are making me turn against a show I have loved for so long, and that is sad. Episodes, not movies!!!!",1228089600,9,1700,4.6138613861386135
3543935,4,B001DZOC46,"I am a huge Futurama fan so this was a must have. I only watched this one once so far and it wasn't my favorite of the three. There was no hint at a possible end to Fry's love for Leela. The whole plot was very far fetched. There were some good parts and it made funny references to another hit movie, but I would say that this is by far not the funniest of three movies. I also didn't notice many scientific or mathmatical references for us nerds.",1228089600,,448,4.044943820224719

The plot is disjointed and makes no sense.  There's a noble tradition of that in Futurama, though, so that's not really a strong criticism of the movie.  The real problem is that it's just not funny.  It's not even particularly interesting.  If you condensed the best parts of this movie into a single 22 minute episode, it would still be one of the worst Futurama episodes made.  Any real fan is going to buy it anyway, no doubt, but I really don't think they'll be watching it as often as they watch the others.",1227916800,3,663,4.429752066115703

I was looking forward to the return of new Futurama and, as such, really enjoyed ""Bender's Big Score"" but found it a bit lacking.  I was disappointed with ""The Beast With a Billion Backs"" and found it watchable but not up to the high standards I was expecting from Futurama.

When I watched ""Bender's Game"" I was blown away!  As a D&D and Tolkien fan as well as a Futurama fan, this DVD spoke directly to me.  The Futurama team has nailed everything that I enjoyed in the series with this DVD release.

While there are times when the storyline drags, there are lots of funny ""bits,"" with nods to numerous SF and fantasy movies/shows, along with moments that hark back to episodes in the Futurama TV series. The quality of the artwork is noticeably better than it was in the original series, and the DVD includes a good selection of extras. Overall, Bender's Game is a worthy addition to the series. (BTW: While the movie's title is a play on Ender's Game, it has nothing to do with that classic science fiction novel.)",1227484800,2,632,4.592920353982301
3543961,4,B001DZOC46,"Well, that's much more like what I want from Futurama!

The last two direct-to-DVD releases, Bender's Big Score and The Beast With a Billion Backs were both ok, but nothing great. But this movie is much more like what I expect from the show.

The story centers around Mom and her efforts at controlling the market in dark matter. Dark matter is what powers all the starships and provides energy in 3008, so the parallels between dark matter and our current situation with oil are blatant and obvious.

The story's sub-plot centers around Bender learning how to play Dungeons and Dragons, and how to develop his imagination. Unfortunately he quickly finds himself unable to separate fantasy from reality and is sent to the HAL Institute for Insane Robots.

Eventually the stories intersect and our heroes end up in Bender's fantasy world, where Lela is a centaur, Zoidberg is a big monster and Fry starts turning into Gollum, lusting after a twelve-sided dice of power.

Along with the usual science fiction references (including a nice bit of fun where George Takei is shouting at Scott Bakula, ""Way to kill the franchise, Bakula!""), there's plenty of references to D&D and to ""The Lord of The Rings"". Fans of both should be very amused.

The format of these direct-to-DVD releases is still something of a problem. The show works best in half-hour installments, not in one long story. I hope after the next one, Into the Wild Green Yonder, they go back to making standard episodes.

One last note: I really hope they stop using these awful cardboard packages! These things are terrible! I understand the desire to ""be green"" and all that, but most people who buy DVDs don't toss the cases into landfills; they keep them and use them. These cases are a joke, and I'll complain about them every time Fox, or any other studio, uses them. In the future, it might be a deciding point for me when debating a purchase.",1227312000,,1911,4.7379518072289155
3543962,3,B001DZOC46,"This release is okay. It has all the funny you would expect from Futurama but the way it is put together is not very good. Its like you will get a good funny story arc going and then it would end very abruptly and a whole new story arc  would begin and end again. This happens for the entir length of the movie. The funny in all the story arcs is there but they never really finish the thought or end the punch line in all the random story arcs. This is very much like several episodes put together to make one move and it fails miserably at continuity with the regular series in many instances. Worth a buy if you can find it at half the price of its retail list price of $20-25. Full price, hell no, especially when you can get the one of the four volumes for the price of this one very random DVD. And one volume has an entire season of different episodes.",1227312000,2,859,4.0828402366863905
3543963,4,B001DZOC46,"Well, the first 2 movies were pretty bad.  Movie 1 decided to throw all cannon out the window and make previous episode connections meaningless.  Movie 2 was a very long drawn out episode that left me confused and empty on the laughter.

However, this 3rd movie felt more like the show.  The caracters were familiar in their personalities again and answered a few questions I had from the series.  I don't play D & D, but I got the cultural references just fine.  Let's just hope that the 4th movie only improves what the 3rd one has tried to fix.",1227139200,,547,4.42

-""Benders big score"" felt like Futurama well seasoned.
-""The Beast with a billion Backs"" felt like a really long episode.

3543966,4,B001DZOC46,"The main cast of Futurama: The Professor (Billy West), Hermes (Phil LaMarr), Leela (Katey Sagal), Bender (John DiMaggio), Amy (Lauren Tom), Zoigberg (Billy West), Nibbler (Frank Welker), Fry (Billy West) as well as Mom (Tress MacNeille) and her three bumbling sons return in this 80-minute special. Futurama: Bender's Game is unlike Futurama: Bender's Big Score and Futurama: The Beast With A Billion Backs due to this instalment not having a movie feel at all to it. Futurama: Bender's Game is designed to be aired in four-parts when it premires on television and it feels like a four-part episodic.

In the beginning of the film you are first introduced to a Futurama version on ""Yellow Submarine"". I believe this is just symbolic of how crazy the upcoming scenes get. Whilst driving about in the Planet Express Ship, Leela, Fry and Bender run out of fuel and luckily Nibbler had one ball of dark matter, which was enough to get the ship to a petrol station. The same guy Sal (John DiMaggio) that always seems to be at one of these stations makes fun of the crew's ship. Sal states even though his ship is beat up, he won the Space Destruction Derby five times. Due to Leela's unrelenting anger issues, she decides to enter the derby and later returns the ship severely damaged.

Later, Dwight Conrad (Hermes Son voiced by Phil LaMarr) and Cubert Farnsworth (the Professor's son voiced by Kath Soucie) are playing a game of ""Dungeons and Dragons"". Bender thinking that it is a form of gambling, wants to join in, only to find out that it is nothing like that. Dwight and Conrad tell Bender that it is the kind of game that you have to use your imagination and anything will be possible. Bender is finally able to use his imagination, but causes him to go mad, believing everything that happens in real life is happening in ""Cornwood"" (fictitious Dungeons and Dragons land).

The Professor annoyed with Leela's anger issues, has a shock collar put around Leela's neck, so anytime she has any thoughts or act of violence, thoughts of sexual perversion and/or lies, she will be electrically shocked. Mom appears in an interview with Morbo discussing the ""problems"" of dark matter and that she hopes to take care of them soon. The Professor perturbed at the interview explains how he created dark matter as a usable energy source. He further explains that Mom has the positive crystal and he has a negative crystal that he cannot find. He says that if the two crystals come together, that it will make dark matter useless. Mom tries to avoid the destruction of dark matter by sending her sons as ""Owl Exterminators"" to retrieve the crystal.

The Professor sees past the boys ruse and finds out that his anti-matter crystal was being used as a die in the Dungeons and Dragons game. Bender having completely gone mad is submitted to the HAL Institute which cannot help his problem. The crew heads over to Mom's base to destroy her crystal. While, the professor is able to get the two crystals to come in close contact, which causes the dark matter to glow, it somehow amplifies Bender's imagination to send everyone to Cornwood.

From this point on the crew are each changed into a Dungeons and Dragon character or a ""Lord of the Rings"" character. Cornwood is essentially Lord of the Rings with Dungeons and Dragons theme to it. The rest of Futurama: Bender's Game tries to wrap up the convoluted story as much as possible. Overall Futurama: Bender's Game is very silly. This is a good thing as they brought back much of the Futurama humour and have many jokes about things you may have forgotten from the 1990's. I felt that this adventure is a big step in the right direction from Futurama: The Beast with A Billion Backs as this was actually funny. Futurama fans should enjoy this as long as they just relax and enjoy it as it is without preconceived notions and realise it is very silly.

Sound:

The sound is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The sound was very well done throughout, but since they decided to make this like the television series, you do not get much in terms of cinematic sound. The voice actors voices were always clearly audible in the centre speaker during the talking scenes, which for some films can sometimes be problematic.
4/5

Special Features:

The special features are rather dull. There are not too many special features and even when you think you find something good such as a deleted scene, it is just a story board with sound. The team that assembled this DVD got rather lazy as far as extra features go.

*Superb video/sound quality.  It is practically perfect on Blu-Ray; the details are sharp, clear, vivid.  The color is great and the picture has no defects that I can see.
*Includes some good special features; commentaries, animatics, a thing that lets you genetically mutate the Futurama characters, featurettes, deleted scenes, outtakes (one of which is an easter egg), and a trailer for the next Futurama film.
*Excellent animation quality.
*Has some great hilarious dialogue and funny scenes (without relying too heavily on catch phrases or old gags). Also has plenty of action.
*A few funny parodies throughout (including ""LOTR"").
*One or two funny puns.
*Also makes good fun of modern-day issues, like rising fuel prices and kids' obsession with ""Dungeons and Dragons.""
*A few of nostalgic homages to older Futurama episodes (expect to see some familiar characters and references). Everything is accurate to what the show was.
*The storyline is surprisingly good.  I expected a fantasy-themed story to be stupid and weird, but it actually made some sense (in Futurama terms anyway).
*Characters are still great and funny.
*Good music.
*Don't know if it is intentional or not, but isn't the title ""Bender's Game"" a little like ""Ender's Game"" with a B in front of it?

The Bad Things
*Contains a surprising amount of bloody violence.  It's not too overwhelming, but it's probably not good for kids to watch.

The Questionable Things
*The characters don't seem to have as many major issues to work out in this story.  It is kind of good, because it cuts through the sappy drama and romance and tells the story in a manner similar to classic Futurama episodes.  However, it also has less character development, and what issues the movie does have seem contrived.

Given that ""The Beast With a Billion Backs"" had such a weird story, I expected this new movie to be equally strange and inferior.  I still think that ""Bender's Big Score"" was better.  But, this new story is not bad and it has a lot of cool and funny moments.  Futurama fans will be pleased; casual viewers may need to rent it first to make up their own mind (or roll that 12-sided dice, whatever you prefer).",1226707200,,2199,4.9135135135135135

I pre-ordered this movie and I am so glad that I did.  When I saw that movie on my doorstep, my husband wanted us to wait until we moved into our new home to watch it - we saw it that very same day.

Of the three, I loved BBS the best. There were a lot of funny jokes and I love how they complexly interwove time travel into the movie. Couldn't watch the whole Hypnotoad episode. Zzzzzz. 5 stars.

The Beast of a Billion Backs was an interesting story but I personally didn't think it was that funny. 3 and half stars.

Bender's Game was funnier than BBB but I'm not crazy about parodies because if you've missed the parodied movie.... In this case, it was the whole Lord of the Rings trilogy. 4 stars.

3543987,2,B001DZOC46,"My review will be brief, as I mainly wished to add to the overall rating of the DVD.  I'm a very dedicated fan of Futurama, but I found this movie to be mostly unsatisfying.  While others have noted the various parodies, including a send-up of the Lord of the Rings, I found most of the movie's humor to be fairly flat.

Perhaps it's the movie format that doesn't allow for the fast, scattershot humor that marked the series, but many of the gags in Bender's Game are dragged out to the point that they lose their humor value.  Jokes dead-end (Leela's pain collar is a good example) or are just plain flat (A QVC reference...does anyone WATCH QVC anymore?) for my tastes.

There were some humorous bits, and I did find myself chuckling once or twice, but so far the movies have never approached the incredible entertainment value of old episodes like The Why of Fry, The Sting, and the all-time classic Roswell that Ends Well.  I'm hoping that they renew the franchise so that they can return to the 22-minute format and maybe the Futurama humor will properly return.",1226361600,2,1067,4.589473684210526

OK, so why would I ever bother buying a Futurama DVD?  To *deliberately* try and bring that lemon back to TV?  Almost every episode of Futurama that I've ever seen has been a dud; why would anyone want it back?  I've never bought, and will never buy, a Futurama movie.  The mind that stopped creating creative Simpsons episodes decided that he could fix himself by creating uncreative Futurama episodes, and he was wrong.  He ran out of material, so he should have just stopped.  Futurama has, like, 3 jokes.  And they're funny the first time.  ONLY the first time.  3 thumbs down.",1226275200,,744,4.5606060606060606

3543991,3,B001DZOC46,"Let me just say this - I've never played D&D, but big deal, that shouldn't matter. It's not like I don't get what's happening when they roll dice and things happen. It's not like I can't see an orc-ish monster and draw a comparison to something of the D&D universe. So the reviews I've been reading by D&D fans who loved it, and the one I read saying that they didn't play as well and thought there was too many ""inside jokes"" to the game, I don't think that's very relevant. You might get a few more laughs as a fan, but altogether it shouldn't really help or hurt.

What is important is if you love alternate universe plotline scenarios... which I always find as an excuse to parody and lampoon things the fans have been dying to seen, yet aren't entirely funny nor relevant to anything else in the show.

Let me be real here though on the other DVD movie releases:
Bender's Big Score - Thought it was entertaining, not the greatest, but it felt good to have Futurama back, and the bonus features on that DVD were insanely interesting. I'm not much of a math nerd, just a fan of the show, but hearing them have discussions about the mathematical references althroughout the series run on that disc was surprisingly captivating.
Beast With a Billion Backs - I keep seeing this movie get panned, but honestly - it's my favorite so far. BWABB is what I think of when I think of Futurama, as the whole show has always had the feel of a campy 60s Sci-Fi movie of what the future will be, down to the design of the ship. BWABB felt like an old invasion movies, but with a slightly more [adult swim]-like vein of humor, which in my opinion was refreshing to see in Futurama. The bonus features were pretty good, but the movie was what made that purchase for me.

Bender's Game is a bit of a disappointment for me. The movie is funny, and is good for a few watchings, but the story is a bit weak, and all ends with possibly the worst ending of all the current Futurama movies. Then, to chock it up further on my S-List, there's the half of this movie that takes place in an alternate Dungeons and Dragons reality where the jokes are cheap and the plot is cheaper. It feels like it's pandering more towards the show's fanbase rather then people who like the show for what it is, and becomes as cheesy and predictable as any Saturday Morning Disney Channel cartoon. I'm not going to give away any twists, but the ""big one"" near the end I called the minute they brought it even slightly to light, and it made me feel as if the show's creator were dumbing down the rest of its mystery to confuse me.

As I said before however, the movie isn't completely skipable. Fans of the show and maybe even a foreign audience to its charm should at least crack a smile if not pass out from laughing at times. I merely found that as a movie itself and as an addition to the recent line of movies and an extension to the series, this one was very weak and more of a cheap gag that was bound to show itself eventually, but would've worked better as a question in Professor Farnsworth's ""What If"" Machine.

The bonus features are also pretty subpar, with the exception of the commentary at which I think I laughed at more than the movie itself. I'd highly recommend watching it with the commentary to those with the DVD purchased who haven't done so already. The other special features, such as the D&D and how to draw featurette aren't as interesting as the other DVDs. The Genetics Lab is only fun until you've exhausted all your options, and any deleted scenes or animatics are pretty much best left unseen.

The good thing about the special features - the sneak preview of the next Futurama movie installment, Into The Wild Green Yonder, which from the looks of it should be truer to the show and a much better movie than this one. After being let down by the film, seeing the commercial for the next one is the only thing that gave me hope that Futurama hasn't gone the way of Family Guy and become more of a tragedy trapped inside of its own cliches, dooming it to never be completely enjoyable again or worth more than a few smirks every ten minutes or so.

So if you're a die-hard Futurama fanatic and you also happen to love D&D, then you will no doubt soil yourself while watching this as you laugh maniacally at all the jokes none of your friends seem to understand. If you're a fan of the series, but not really the fantasy realm or direct theme parodies, or if you're even new to Futurama and this is your plan onto entering the 30th century, then I'd advise you rent this before you plan on purchasing. The disc has very little replay value to me, and I don't think I'll be watching it again anytime soon.

Let's just hope I'm right about Into The Wild Green Yonder being excellent.",1226188800,15,4771,4.370913190529876
3543992,3,B001DZOC46,"It's Futurama so it has its moments but compared to the other two movies this one is the worst of the batch.  It felt like the story was written hastily and instead of finding cleaver ways to make potential plot holes make sense it opted to instead make jokes about the fact that it doesn't make any sense.  Which is funny the first time but not when it happens again and again.

The central theme of Dungeons and Dragons was lost on me a non-player and truthfully I was surprised that the producers let such a massively narrow idea get out of the writers room.  Even if all Futurama viewers are nerds not all of us play D&D, in fact most of us don't.

If you are a die hard Futurama fan and like D&D this one is for you.  But if your just someone who enjoys Futurama I say save your money and just get this one through Netflix, it's not worth owning.",1226102400,3,851,4.158536585365853
3543993,4,B001DZOC46,"We've said it before and we'll say it again - it's great to see Futurama back among the living with this series of (almost) movie-length features. ""Bender's Game"" bounces back strongly from the disappointing last installment, ""The Beast with a Billion Backs."" That last flick sacrificed plot construction for awkward non-sequiturs and forced gross-out jokes, not to mention a pile of discontinuities with the old first-run episodes. With ""Bender's Game"" the team has recovered with an intelligent and intricate storyline that ties in nicely with the compelling subplots and mysteries from the first-run episodes, plus a return to some seriously brain-draining theories from mathematics and science (catch the nerdy commentary feature!). A very well-constructed mix of sci-fi and fantasy also draws out some of best comedy moments delivered by the Futurama team in ages.

This flick, while a clear improvement over the last one, still suffers from the effects of stretching out the formerly leaner and meaner 22-minute plots into the 88-minute format. This story's reverential satire of Lord of the Rings (plus a bit of Star Wars and a few other geek classics) goes on too long and ultimately feels like a bit of a time-killer, and there are a lot of awkward cuts among the subplots. Oldtimers may also remain dissatisfied with the inconsistencies in Leela's character - she's just not a steady presence in this movie series.

But here we do get great appearances from some of the best recurring characters from the series, especially Mom and her bumbling sons, the Nibblonians, and (my personal favorite) Roberto. This installment also delivers the most laugh-out-loud moments of any of the three flicks so far - the Morcs being a hysterical example. But there's one mind-boggler at the end - a complete overhaul of most of what makes the Futurama universe tick. Will the writing team make effective use of this showstopper in the fourth and final flick? [~doomsdayre520~]",1226102400,,1972,5.159375

""Bender's Game"" is the third Futurama film and the first to veer away from the outer-space setting and bring us into the realm of fantasy.  The story begins with alcoholic cigar-smoking cleptomaniacal robot Bender heckling a group of nerds playing ""Dungeons and Dragons"" before realizing that he as a robot has never used his imagination before.  Leela has developed anger-management issues and winds up entering the crew's spaceship in an intergalactic demolition derby after being insulted by space-rednecks.  Meanwhile, the monolithic corporate entity posing as a down-home granny known simply as ""Mom"" has engineered a fuel shortage to boost profits (political relevance alert!) after taking control of the universe's supply of dark matter -which all spaceships run on.  By the way, in Futurama dark matter comes in the form of cute alien poop.  Professor Farnsworth possesses a powerful crystal that can potentially nullify all of the universe's dark matter, thus breaking Mom's control, but can't remember where the hell he hid it.

Okay, you've got your references to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" in the form of the HAL Institute for Criminally Insane Robots.  Turns out Rosie from ""The Jetsons"" malfunctioned and slaughtered the whole family (nasty business, that).  Now that's space comedy.  You've got the genre of humor all it's own that is Doctor Zoidberg (why did you think Leela's so mad all the time?) along with brief cameos from various other characters from Futurama history.  Plus, Bender: funny, yes?  And anybody who has ever wondered to themselves ""gee, I wonder what it would look like if Leela and Amy totally made out"" can count that curiosity as fulfilled.  They're not lesbians if one of them is a centaur, so it's cool.  Gotta love college girl logic.  Basically, if you are a Futurama fan, this is exactly what you are looking for.  I feel the series would be better served as...well, a series but the transition to feature-length is not an uncomfortable one.  There are some moments of pure comedic genius, loads of references and gags that only nerds will get, and the same old cast of characters you love, but the length of the feature does spread the laughs out more than in the weekly 20 minute episodes we loved so much.  Still, it is Futurama and if you're a fan, you've got to see it.

A with the previous films, there are a lot of special features on the disc.  There is a featurette chronicling past references to D&D in the show's history and paying homage to its late creator while the Futurama creators goof around, hit each other with blunt objects, and joke about the 80's scare that RPG's were satanic and would drive American children to madness.  I remember it well; I was forbidden from playing.  There's also a gene-spicing machine that lets you put any two characters together to make a hybrid of them.  Amusing, but only for a short time.  There's the usual commentary and preview, a rough version of a deleted scene, a ""how-to-draw"" art video, outtakes, and a very funny parody of those embarrassing anti-piracy ads.  Personally, I'm waiting for the boxed set of all four movies to buy, but if you've already gotten the series and the other two movies then you've already bought this so I don't have to tell you to do so.  It will be a sad day when ""Wild Green Yonder"" is released and the world will once again be sans-Futurama.  With any luck, ""Everybody Loves Hypnotoad"" will get picked up.

""Bender's Game"" is the best of the three released movies and just as funny and entertaining as the TV show.  Mom and her three bungling sons (of Mom Corp.) serve as the foils to Fry, Bender, Leela, and friends as they attempt to break the Mom Corp. monopoly on dark matter (the petroleum of the 31st century).  The movie steals a lot from Dungeons & Dragons and many scenes are parodies of the Lord of the Rings movies, so it has a fantasy feel as well as the normal Futurama sci-fi universe.

3543997,5,B001DZOC46,"To recap the Futurama movie DVDs so far:

Futurama: Bender's Big Score -- Completely complex, somewhat nerdy, completely enthralling and funny.  Thought the preview for ""Billion Backs"" was decent...

Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs -- felt like the Futurama characters in a sub-par ""Family Guy"" episode, in terms of both inane story banality and jokes...  only twice as thrice as long.  The preview for ""Game"" was also very disappointing and leaving me uncertain...

And now onto something completely relevant:

Futurama: Bender's Game:  Well, I'm happy to say my fears and uncertainty were completely unfounded.

This third installment isn't quite as complex plot-wise as ""Big Score"", seems to explain previous situations that occurred in the show's time line (some of which made even more weird by later events) and I must say, technically, this explains some loose ends (e.g. why Nibbler was alone on Vergon 6) with aplomb.  These did not feel forced or fanwanky; they worked.  Given that revisiting old scenes is a sign of ""jumping the shark"", this feature-length episode does not feel worn out at all.  To compare, I recall a season 4 episode where Fry meets up with the Brain creatures again, entitled ""The Why of Fry"" -- THAT felt like juicy, tender shark bait.  Indeed, given how ""The Why of Fry"" also involves Nibbler, it's amazing how well everything pieces together...

While ""Big Score"" wins on sheer complexity with Time, ""Game"" is complex in character motivations and resolving various character circumstances and mysteries.  If there were any continuity flaws, they're well hidden -- or directly lampooned on screen in typical Futurama fashion (the self-lampooning scene stands out and for all the right reasons; trust me, it works.)

""Game"" has the task of not only parodying Dungeons and Dragons (D&D), but also remaining true to being Futurama.  I was expecting to dislike this as I never cared for D&D.  It's presented in such a way you don't need to be a die-hard fan - or even knowing the game - to appreciate it.

Yes, the movie has its crude moments - all of Futurama has, but its sci-fi-with-aliens setting allows even the most crude of crude to be given a funny side that ""real life"" based TV couldn't even begin to get away with.  Not even ""Family Guy"".  Indeed, the worst of them goes back to, you guessed it, Nibbler, and sick as it was I was rolling.

And, yes, there is a cameo from a certain Star Trek cast member - and may I say that alone, if for no other reason and trust me there are many, makes this DVD worth buying.  Best. Zinger.  Ever.  :)

And the Dixie Chicks (in name only) make an unexpected cameo too...  that also had me rolling.

As usual, DVD video and sound quality are tops, though the Dolby 5.1 made the opening credits sound like they were a tad muffled.

And, as usual, the packaging is not Earth-friendly as we are all going out to buy proper boxes so we don't get our discs scratched and have to re-purchase them 80 times...  Again, FOX is just cutting costs and hoping we all re-purchase due to excessive scratches after the third playback...

Oh, I didn't mention the preview for the finale - due in 2009 and we all want it now, dagnabbit!  All I can say is that it is pretty much unassuming, except for one giveaway scene which means it's not going to happen that way, which is for the best because it's clear ""Futurama"" has NOT run out of steam just yet.

To close, ""Futurama"" is back on form!  Looking forward to the hopefully-not-final installment in the-earlier-of-2009-the-better.  :)",1225929600,,3556,4.745513866231648

3544000,4,B001DZOC46,"Carol Burnett used to do pretty funny movie spoofs. (Her version of GWTW has one of the great comic moments in the history of American TV.) They were so popular she decided to an entire show dedicated to do a take-off on ""The Dolly Sisters"", a biopic about two Hungarian sisters and their success in American show business (""The Doily Sisters""). It was okay, but at nearly 50 minutes, not anywhere nearly as funny as a 10-minute sketch.

I think the same thing is happening here. Given a story spread over four episodes, the plot starts to swamp the jokes. And that's what we watch ""Futurama"" for, isn't it, the brilliant humor?

In the first three ""movies"", there hasn't been a single joke even close to the (admittedly high) level of ""St. Pauli Exclusion Principle Girl"", or ""They changed the outcome of the race by measuring it!"".

Not in any way bad, but simply not up to the single-episode quality level. They should have produced 16 single episodes, not four ""movies"".

By the way, ""Bender's Game"" (a reference to Orson Scott Card's novel ""Ender's Game"") ends with a major change to the Futurama universe that (at the moment) makes it look as if Planet Express will no longer be able to flit from star to star. The movie also throws into sharp relief the unanswered question of how Nibbler ""just happened"" to be in the right place at the right time to intercept Fry's time line (or perhaps it doesn't matter at all).",1225843200,2,1422,4.608695652173913
3544001,4,B001DZOC46,"This entry into the Futurama universe was a fun romp.  I think the more episodic writing helped a lot, making this movie more like the show.  The characters stayed true to themselves, keeping them likable.  I was initially apprehensive about the D&D storyline, but it was pulled off quite well, especially with Mom as the big baddie.  And, in true Futurama fashion, the story was also rooted in current events, via the ""shortage"" of dark matter.",1225843200,2,445,4.815789473684211
3544002,5,B001DZOC46,"The first two Futurama movies were ok (well, to be honest, Beast with a Billion Backs was terrible), but this third installment is a winner.  It has all the sly humor from the classic Futurama seasons that you've missed, and then some.  I enjoyed the greater inclusion of Dr. Zoidberg.

The premise is quite true to life; the Planet Express crew must deal with the increase in dark matter fuel prices.  This somehow segues into a Lord of the Rings plot which I won't spoil, but it actually works out quite well.  We have an interesting tie-in between Mom and Professor Farnsworth.

All the old favorite characters are here too, including Morbo the Annihilator, Nibbler, Sal, Scruffy the Janitor, and George Takei.  I didn't see Zapp Brannigan or Kif, but they weren't missed, and would've detracted from the story, or rather, the semblance of a story.

In conclusion, I think it's the unmistakable stench of dwarf urine that makes this Futurama movie a winner!",1225756800,2,960,4.810975609756097

3544004,5,B001DZOC46,"The third of the four Futurama films is the best one so far. it is set in a fantasy world, reminiscent of the Lord of the Rings and Dungeons and Dragons worlds. The main plot takes a while to get going, but when it does, it really takes off. I cannot recommend this enough for Futurama fans, they will not be disappointed.",1225756800,2,322,4.209677419354839

3544006,5,B001DZOC46,"This movie is completely independent from the other two films, with everything back to normal at the beginning of it from when the last ended.  It's pretty easy to follow along for thsoe who haven't seen the other two, or even the rest of the series.  As others have mentioned, this movie takes on a D&D / Lord of the Rings feel to it as it explores the fantasy realm, but it's nicely explained as to why it happens that way.  Everything seems to blend together well in this movie (the various subplots set up at the beginning join together).  The movie also refers back to the original series and explains various things: a possibile origin between the Farnesworth-Wordstrom rivalry, more on the Mom-Farnesworth relationship, Nibbler being picked up off Vergon 6 as it implodes (and why it does implode), and a few other things.  I think all of these add to what's known in the Futurama universe without taking away from anything, and fits very well in to what is already established.

I really enjoyed the movie, probably more than the other two movies.  The one thing I didn't like so much about the DVD were the features.  I didn't find them all that exciting.  I enjoyed seeing how to draw the characters, and the genetics lab was somewhat interesting (but limiting).  Everything else wasn't bad, but just seemed a bit short.

Features:
-Movie Commentary
-Storyboard Animatic for part one (~ 20 minutes)
-Futurama Genetics lab (you can choose two characters and see what they look like merged- but only for a small number of characters)
-Dungeons & Dragons & Futurama (~ 7 minutes, explains D&D references in the show)
-How to draw Fry, Bender/Flexo, Leela, & Zoidberg (~ 8 minutes)
-3-D modeling of various ships in the series (~ 5 minutes)
-Deleted scene (only one)
-""Blooperama,"" outtakes from the movie (~ 2 minutes)
-Bender's Anti-Piracy Warning
-Trailer for the fourth movie: ""Into the Wild Green Yonder""

The packaging I got my DVD in was the cardboard ""carbon neutral"" packaging, in which the disc is put into a cardboard slit.  I went out and bought a CD envelope to put in my box instead of using the slit.

The box did contain 4 Futurama postcards: giant Bender and Zoidberg (from the Anthology of Interest), Fry and Leela running away from aliens attacking, an ad to ""Keep your robot clean"" and a generic ""The future is today, worry about it tomorrow.""  Even though these were mostly put in to advertise that these images were for sale in paintings, I kind of like the extra of having postcard-sized art (""One 'art' please"").",1225756800,33,2542,4.732426303854876
3544007,5,B001DZOC46,"Futurama was a series canceled far before its time, but thankfully its back and unlike the Simpsons seems to get better as it goes. I was thrilled when the new series of direct to DVD movies was announce. I believe that Bender's Game to be the best of the three new releases. The story isn't that deep or politically nuanced as some of the older episodes, but it does manage to play a good deal of homage to class Dungeons and Dragons, Lord of the Rings, and even a touch of Star Wars. The animation is clean and well done as usual, and the dialog is classic Futurama. The I thought it was great and I look forward to the next round.",1225411200,3,633,4.19672131147541
