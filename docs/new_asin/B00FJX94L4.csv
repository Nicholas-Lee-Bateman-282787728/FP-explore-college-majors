8616186,5,B00FJX94L4,This anime was good. It had action all throughout the show. The end was a twist as well.,1462838400,,88,3.9444444444444446
8616187,5,B00FJX94L4,"Really good second season, be nice if there was a 3rd planned. Follows the manga really well atleast. Worth watching.",1436227200,,117,4.9
8616188,4,B00FJX94L4,"A pretty good follow up to the 1st season of Medaka Box. Unlike the 1st season, there's more action/fighting in Medaka Box Abnormal while the 1st season is more of a comedy and introduces you to the main characters throughout it so you might feel like you're watching a different anime with Abnormal which kind of deals with the effects the events of the 1st season's ending has had on Medaka and her friends.

I really like the anime, and I would encourage people to buy/watch it, but there's one problem with it that I'm sure many anime fans hate- THE LAST EPISODE ENDS AS A CLIFFHANGER. Worst part about the cliffhanger is a new deadly enemy is introduced to the group in the last minute of the final episode.",1430265600,2,712,4.476923076923077
8616189,5,B00FJX94L4,great for fans of the anime or manga. the quality was improved alot from what was shown on crunchyroll and it shipped fast,1422230400,,122,4.3478260869565215
8616190,5,B00FJX94L4,It is an awesome series I really wish they would continue and make a 3rd season but I don't think they are same goes for sekeri. I believe it or not these are some of the most powerful charaters in anime history in this show Kumagawa and medaka and 2 others are most definitely the strongest in all time. Can't be mad at this DvD even though the series ended.,1420588800,3,359,4.142857142857143
8616191,4,B00FJX94L4,i like it,1411430400,,9,2.3333333333333335
8616192,5,B00FJX94L4,BEWARE the season end on a cliffhanger and there are no plans for a 3rd season so if you want to see the end of the series you have to see the manga. Also the final episode fake final episode is just bad has nothing to do with the storyline and non of the characters are in it. A waste of time best to skip it. It still gets a 5 because is just amazing BUT if you don't like those anime series with out an ending best to skip it. I do love Medaka and the series but had I been told it would not have and ending I would have passed and not gotten my self invested as I did.,1407024000,7,572,3.69672131147541
8616193,5,B00FJX94L4,It's was a very nice addition to my collection,1405382400,,46,4.222222222222222
8616194,5,B00FJX94L4,It is a really good anime to watch and I would tell my good friends about it so they will buy it,1393718400,,96,3.409090909090909
