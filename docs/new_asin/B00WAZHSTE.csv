7129886,4,B00WAZHSTE,"This was a really good movie. I would have gave five stars but I don't care for all the unnecessary cursing in the movie but the story line was super cute. Besides, who does not like Columbus short. He has always been an awesome actor and regardless of whatever, you can't take that one aspect from him. The leading actress was really good as well... I would even watch again...oh and men, my husband liked it as well.",1439251200,,418,4.371794871794871

7129914,5,B00WAZHSTE,I really enjoy plays and/or low budget films. I watch a lot of urban films and this was one of my favorite films. I enjoyed the chemistry between the two main characters.,1469664000,,170,4.34375
7129915,5,B00WAZHSTE,This was a very good movie.  I had taped the movie on cable but for some reason it cut off before the end.  i was able to find it on Amazon Prime and purchased it just so I could see the end.  I really enjoyed this movie.,1469059200,,221,3.6595744680851063
7129916,5,B00WAZHSTE,Love Story with a twist! Hilarious and Heartfelt!,1467331200,,49,5.25
7129917,3,B00WAZHSTE,"I thought it was ok, only because Columbus and the leading lady really had no real chemistry between them. He was lively and she was rather boring, real flat and uninteresting. I am also surprised they chose a brown skin woman as the lead..kudos to them for that. Other than that, the movie was light hearted and it did not leave me with the feeling that I've wasted my time.",1461456000,,375,4.371428571428571

7129938,4,B00WAZHSTE,I saw this movie on TV and thought it soooo cute!!  However the movie on DVD is fantastic..no commercials & couple scenes that were cut on regular TV.  I enjoyed Erica Tazel as U.S. Marshall on FX Justified,1444262400,,206,4.394736842105263

7129964,5,B00WAZHSTE,Columbus Short is suchhhhh a talent! I really hope he gets it together. I want him to flourish. He acts circles around the main but it's such a cute story. I love it.,1441238400,,166,4.0606060606060606

7129969,3,B00WAZHSTE,"Lisa (Erica Tazel) believes Mr. Right is a fantasy and doesn't exist. Her friend Norma (Dawn Halfkenny) fixes her up with Michael (Columbus Short) from the Mr. Right dating service. Sparks fly and Michael becomes a liability to the company where only hot rich women use the service.

The story is unrealistic and has a large ""ugh"" appear for men. However for the female fantasy (the ones who have seen ""An Officer and Gentleman"" seven times and still cry at the end) this romance just might be right for you. The film has limited action and drama (except that one thing) and is mostly a love story where both the girl and the guy talk about their feelings, a film where the man comes running after the woman through hell-fire to pledge his never dying love, while Mila Kunis makes fun of this in another film.

In the early kitchen scene, if you look close, you can see a stage hand's reflection in the door window.

Go on ladies, you know you want to see it. No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Your Mr. Right should have the lawn done about the time it is over.",1439596800,,1055,4.4
7129970,4,B00WAZHSTE,I love a love story! Two gorgeous people falling in love but wait! ......He is not quite the perfect catch he seems to be? Drama ensues and then...yayyyyyyyy a happy ending.,1439596800,,173,4.612903225806452

8712769,5,B00WAZHSTE,"Downright hilarious! Even though Columbus Short is questionable, he was great in this one and made me forget I was watching his problematic behind.",1499472000,,147,5.166666666666667
8712770,5,B00WAZHSTE,I liked this movie.  Was shocked to see Columbus Short in it. Will watch again.,1496448000,,79,4.266666666666667
8712771,2,B00WAZHSTE,Ewwww. Colombus Short's acting in this film... smh. Spare me. smh,1490400000,,65,5.0
8712772,3,B00WAZHSTE,This is a funny romantic comedy. Many women have a hard time finding the right man. The two main stars have chemistry and the situations are not too silly. There are a few laughs. This is recommended for people looking for a clean romantic comedy.,1484697600,,247,4.511111111111111
