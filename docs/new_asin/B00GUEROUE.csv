8627598,5,B00GUEROUE,"i own a copy of this film via dark entertainment, this troma version according to amazon runs only 1 hr 22 min= 82 min. the original length of this film is 2 hr 7 min(troma apparently butchers another foreign horror film) in it's native german language with english subtitles and a much different cover-art. this is NOT directed by the claiment listed here on amazon it is directed by marc and lars rohnstock. this is also NOT their first film but probably their third or fourth. 1. dungeon of evil 2. necronos: the tower of doom 3. the curse of Dr. wolfenstein coming soon.

the only reason why i am giving this film a 5 star rating is for my version. when concerning german, swedish, polish, english(england),
most of these countries horror films get the scissors here in the states(domestication).

the more wise i get concerning the censors, the more i think i need to speak up!

if this is, however, a lloyd kaufman re-make...i opinionate...""shame on you, troma!"".",1392854400,14,969,4.72189349112426
