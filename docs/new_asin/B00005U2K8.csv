1663277,5,B00005U2K8,TRULY OUTSTANDING...HAVE SEEN THIS DVD MORE TIMES THAN I CAN COUNT.  A COMPELLING AND PASSIONATE PERFORMER.,1074038400,2,107,5.6875
1663278,5,B00005U2K8,"Simply one of the most gifted singers of our modern era, Puerto Rican singer Marc Anthony has become the bonafide star he rightfully deserves to be. Every artist's dream is to play an arena as big and famous as New York City's Madison Square Garden, and just like a wish granted, this New York bred singer got his wish.
The former RMM recording star (now signed with Sony Discos) is amazing as he captivates his audience in this special that was televised live on HBO in 2000. Singing some of his classics in Spanish and new hits in English, Marc truly is a glowing presence on stage as his fans, both male and female, are energized and moved by his gift of song.
This DVD captures the intensity that Marc Anthony can only provide onstage. Whether you're a fan or an avid listener to salsa music and/or Spanish ballads, ""Marc Anthony - The Concert from Madison Square Garden"" is a must see. Gifted, blessed, and talented are the words I can use to describe this artist and this performance.",1038528000,34,990,4.5363128491620115

He deserves to be where he's now and has earned to be mentioned amongst the greatest Salsa singers. He will take my kind of music well into the future. Keep up the good work Marc and God bless.",1008633600,8,343,3.9855072463768115

1663314,5,B00005U2K8,"This was an amazing concert. Marc mixes his spanish hits with english hits. It's a good mix of english pop songs, salsa, and beautiful ballads. His voice is beyond amazing. So passionate, powerful and beautiful! Simply put the man can sing! And it's nice to see a true, old school type of talent. No theatrics, pyrotechnics, unnecessary backup dancers, and hundreds of outfit changes. Just his amazing live bad and his amazing voice singing completely live. That's true, natural talent. Marc doesnt need playback. His voice comes across nice and clear. Love every song he chose to sing for the HBO concert. Marc has so many great songs its a shame he cant sing them all. My favorites were Y Hubo Alguien, Hasta Ayer, When I Dream at Night, My Baby You, That's Okay and Preciosa (what a powerhouse when he sings that song!). This dvd also includes the music video for the song When I Dream At Night which featured his first wife the beautiful Dayanara Torres, and the video is great too.",1455580800,,986,4.672413793103448

1663388,4,B00005U2K8,"Antes de comprar este DVD le comentarios muy dispares acerca de l, algunos decan que era maravilloso y otro que muy malo y por eso me gustara dar mi opinin. En cuanto a lo tcnico, la imagen es excelente, el trabajo de cmaras y edicin y la nitidez de la imagen todas merecen ese calificativo. La calidad del sonido es el punto bajo del DVD. Algunas crticas la defienden argumentando que uno no puede esperar un gran sonido si tiene un mal equipo y que el sonido grabado en vivo no tiene la misma calidad. Puedo garantizar que mi equipo es de magnfica calidad y no sera un factor limitante jams y he odo otras grabaciones hechas en vivo de mucho mejor calidad de tal modo que esas defensas no me parecen vlidas. El sonido hay que calificarlo como aceptable. En cuanto a lo artstico, la orquesta es muy buena con individualidades destacadas que incluyen una presentacin de Tito Puente. No necesito hablar de los indiscutibles mritos de Marc Anthony como artista y en esta presentacin l se esmera. La seleccin de temas es excelente combinando con acierto sus tradicionales salsas con temas en ingls y otros ritmos en espaol. En conclusin, aunque el sonido deja qu desear, es suficientemente bueno como para no ser un obstculo para disfrutar de este DVD. Si Ud. es fan de Marc Anthony, no dude en comprarlo.",1218326400,,1302,4.592274678111588

Listen to group playing as one, as only one, compact, Listen Preciosa version, wonderful, emotional song. Cameras, public, group, even Julia Roberts and Ruben Blades are fantastic.

Ce concert assure sa conscration, surtout auprs des femmes qui semblent l'apprcier plus qu'il n'est ncessaire. La voix n'est pas particulirement envotante, mais le chanteur a du charisme, et du temprament, c'est dj a. Au fait, qu'est-il devenu, depuis qu'il a pous J-Lo?",1191974400,,412,5.073529411764706

1663399,4,B00005U2K8,"While watching this DVD, I was brought back to that latter part of the '90s when Ricky Martin boomed on the English pop charts with ""Livin La Vida Loca"" and ""The Cup of Life"" along with Elvis Crespo's ""Suavemente"".

  Overall, Marc put out some fine artistic ability to entertain his audience by showing his true belief in what he was singing about. He performed a majority of the best tracks on his pop album and some of his classic salsa hits from three of his other albums.

  However, one disappointment: Marc excluded an entire album that started him on his way in the salsa realm of Puerto Rico during the early '90s. The Latin album ""Otra Nota"" reveals Marc during his prime and youthful years when he sings the rhythmic ballad ""Palabras Del Alma"". Moving along, women were, and still are, hypnotized by the smooth lyrics of ""El Ultimo Beso"". Finally, the one song that he could've at least included was his version of ""Hasta Que Te Conoci"". A lot of people did not even know of Juan Gabriel until they heard Marc's version.

  Anyways, this was an excellent concert. Some of the salsa legands such as Tito Puente and Ruben Blades made an appearance.",1170547200,,1157,4.6048780487804875

I've only seen one music video of Marc previously on TV here and that was the Theme music of the Mask of Zorro.

At the end of the day I was glad I bought this DVD as it contains 2 hours although he is not much of a dancer but a great singer.",1135900800,3,441,3.6315789473684212

1663427,5,B00005U2K8,"It was truly a pleasure to watch this concert on DVD, Mark Anthony ""live"" at Madison Square Gardens. Not knowing what to expect from one of the most popular modern day salsa artists, I can truly say that Mark A is an excellent live performer. His performance was lively, charismatic, emotional at times, sincere, and just a downright pleasure to watch. If you are familiar with Mark Anthony's exceptional music repertoire you can imagine the calibre of this performance. Mark Anthony, not a real dancer per se but definitely compensates with his mobility across the stage, his tantalizing chants to the audience and his unique self expression. Some of his most cherished songs were sung: Te conozco bien, Nadie como ella, Y Hubo alguien and Hasta ayer among others. The audio and lighting is superb as well as the DVD itself renders a crystal clear picture. No doubt Mark Anthony is a great salsero and he's here to stay. He is definitely the pride of Puerto Rico and all los boricuas en el planeta. Awesome show!",1101772800,10,1013,4.761363636363637
1663428,5,B00005U2K8,"A live broadcast for HBO from Madison Square Garden in 2000, this 2 hour show is energy filled and a winner for salsa lovers; the camera work and editing are excellent, and it must have been challenging to follow Marc Anthony as he dances his way across the stage. He is super-charged and looks great in all black, with a knee-length jacket and his trademark sunglasses.
The musicians are incredible, and keep up with Marc every step of the way, and the audience reaction is like an ocean of applause and cheers, that clearly overwhelms Marc with emotion at times.
The DVD ""Extras"" include the video of ""When I Dream at Night"".
As Marc is fond of saying, ""check it out, baby !""

The songs:
1: ""Y Hubo Alguien"", a wild salsa number to start the show with.
2: ""Contra la Corriente"", the title song to his terrific 1997 CD.
3: ""You Sang to Me""
4: ""When I Dream at Night""
5: ""Hasta Ayer"". My favorite song of the show ! the concert is worth viewing for this number alone; guitarist Nelson Gonzales does a marvelous solo on this one.
6: ""Si Te Vas"". more wild salsa.
7: ""Nadie Como Ella"". Tito Puente does a drum solo on this one.
At this point in the concert Marc Anthony does some introductions: Ruben Blades, and Julia Roberts and Benjamin Bratt who are in the audience.
8: ""Don't Let Me Leave"". Aaron McLain does a nifty electric guitar solo on this song.
9: ""Remember Me"". A lovely, poignant ballad.
10: ""My Baby You"". An emotional ballad dedicated to Marc's daughter Arianna, which moves Marc to tears after singing it.
11: ""Te Conosco Bien"". Back to the salsa.
12: ""Da la Vuelta"". Mas salsa !
13: ""Preciosa"". An ode to beautiful Puerto Rico.
14: ""That's Okay"". Great dance number.
15: ""I Need to Know"". I love this tune ! Wonderful melody and rhythm, impossible to refrain from dancing when this is playing.",1101254400,73,1809,4.498480243161095
1663429,5,B00005U2K8,"It's concerts like this that make you wish you had HBO just so you didn't miss anymore of them.  This was really my introduction to the Marc's firey presence and solid connection with the audience, his warm sense of humor and his electrifying stage presence.  Marc has obviously received some excellent vocal training.  I could see Marc Anthony take on the heavyweights of opera with those lungs.  He blew me away.  His upper range is gorgeous, and the lower end of his register is soulful, expressive and very romantic.  This concert presented a great cross section of Mr. Anthony's work over the years.  This consisted of songs from Contra La Corriente, A Todo Su Tiempo, Desde El Principio and his self-titled cross over album.  I really prefer his Spanish language music a lot more.  Marc's approach to salsa is like Matisse's approach to art: generous, voluptuous, alive and gloriously expressive.  Also, we must give props to his extraordinary band that consists of percussionists, great background vocalists and the guest musicians who appeared with him as well.  (The legendary Tito Puente and Jimmy Bosch, among others.)

Please, take the time to watch this DVD and get to know the man and the wonderful music we are fortunate to hear from his great set of pipes.",1099958400,7,1272,4.892523364485982

Yeah who cares about Rosie O'Donnel and Julia Roberts. We see Tito Puente perform on stage!! Marc had to announce these people as a part of the HBO gig, I'm sure. The English songs don't anyway take over or lessen teh effect of his salsa classics performed.
If your a Marc fan, you won't be disappointed I promise! At a good price too!",1085788800,6,561,4.155963302752293

1663443,5,B00005U2K8,"Finally, the long-awaited Madison Square Garden concert.  Marc plays all the tunes from his earlier CDs (which were the best Salsa and English Pop CDs, in my opinion).  His band is top-notch, the production is one of the best I've seen (HBO productions, what do you expect?), the musicians include salsa greats like Tito Puente and Jimmy Bosch on trombone, and a whole host of other New York heavyweights.  The sound is spectacular, although on the bassy side (so put up the treble on your sound system).
All in all, my second favorite Salsa DVD, after Bobby Valentin's 35th Anniversary DVD in the Oso Blanco Prison in Puerto Rico.
This is Marc Anthony at his best!  Get it!",1083542400,2,674,4.686440677966102
1663444,4,B00005U2K8,"This concert got so much attention because of the HBO telecast as well as his English album. It's well deserved.
I'm not a fan of his English music, but it worked well in this concert. Marc Anthony really jams with his salsa music, which he is primarily known for. He exudes so much energy into his performances that you really have the feeling that you're there.
I took off a star because of the time he spends in between songs. He pretty much talks nonsense and at one point praises Tito Puente and Ruben Blades way too much as well as Julia Roberts and her ex-beau. He's also a bit over dramatic. It's a little annoying.  That's just a personal gripe. It's no reflection on his music or his amazing voice.
Highly recommended.",1081468800,,728,4.473684210526316

1663446,5,B00005U2K8,"Great voice.  Great performance.  Great production.  You should buy this DVD because it's cheaper than some of his CDs and it has 16 of his best songs, including the video ""When I Dream at Night.""  I don't know how this guy does it - he runs from one side of the stage to the other, singing away full blast, never missing a note, barely breaking a sweat -- yet in the beginning of the video he is smoking cigarettes!  The song ""Preciosa,"" I think was my favorite.  It will make you want to go to Puerto Rico.  ""My Baby You"" was kind of embarrassing.  He said he would never do the song in concert again, which is a shame because it's a very good song.  Man, this guy can really sing.  This DVD is an excellent value, a very nice mix of his salsa and crossover.",1081036800,,760,4.1438356164383565

I LOVE Marc Anthony. I think he's a wonderful performer who's not afraid to express how he feels, even if he gets a little goofy(that just makes him more human).  That's one of the qualities that I find make him so sexy. He's not afraid to be himself. My favorite songs by far is ""Y Hubo Alguien"" & ""Te Conozco Bien"" but I can not get over his performance of ""Preciosa"" and ""Nadie Como Ella"" with the AMAZING Tito Puente (I still have goosebumps).  All in all, a SPECTACULAR job. And of course, from his english album my favorites are ""When I Dream At Night"" and ""That's O.K."". I love you Marc.

There were 2 performances at the Garden, 1 of which was filmed to be telecast on HBO.  I love Marc's voice so much that my wife & I purchased tickets for both concerts.  Marc's voice & onstage presence cannot be overlooked.  He is the # 1 Salsero & is as some people have called him the ""Latin Frank Sinatra"" of our time.  Any true music lover can and will appreciate his talent and the Sensuality in his voice.  I've watched this performance numerous times ( on V.H.S. & now finally I can watch it on DVD ) and I never get tired of watching it.  Marc's voice is a la natural and nothing is needed to enchance this mans voice.  My standout moments in this performance is when he sings ""My Baby You"" a song which he dedicated to his daughter Arianna who was in the audience.  A very touching song.  I also enjoyed the special surprise guest appearance by El Rey ""Tito Puente"" who played the timbales during Marc's performance of ""Nadie Como Ella"".  Marc is a superb talent in both the Spanish & English music market.  He has the best of both worlds.  He will be around for a very LONG time.  Pick this D.V.D. up and you'll get more than your moneys worth.  Marc, all I have to say is "" Valla BORICUA "" ! Sigue Palante !  La musica tuya es ""PRECIOSA' !",1080172800,25,1360,4.25
