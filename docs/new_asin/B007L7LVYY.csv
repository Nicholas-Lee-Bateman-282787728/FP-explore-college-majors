I can now say that this is probably one of the best Polish films I have seen in the modern era, and I have seen quite a few.  I won't be pretentious, knowing myself for the philistine that I am, and won't provide a profound critique about the artistry of the thing. What I will say is that it was 3 weeks since I have seen it, and yet its dark message still lingers in my mind.

Essentially, post communist Poland seems to have an emerging class of 'haves' and 'have nots'.  In the film the 'haves' are depicted as self obessed individuals unhappy with their lot, while the 'have nots' are depicted as menacing 'boguns' (an Australian term for a class of people I believe the Americans refer to as 'caravan trash').  As for the plot, the interaction between the 'haves' and the deeply envious 'have nots' gets darker and darker, and has an ending which Alfred Hitchcock would approve of.

If this is where modern Polish cinema is heading, I say, keep it up!",1336521600,,1079,4.41919191919192
