3098858,5,B0012V4WSW,"Like many fans out there, you're probably wondering what in the world the 1.11 rebuild of Evangelion is considering the 1.01 release is barely four months old.  While FUNimation has confirmed that 1.01 was the beginning of four rebuilt feature film releases, 1.11 isn't the second one but rather 1.01 again with some of its lighting (lack thereof) issues addressed, the addition of 2-minutes of new scenes and a second disc including a bunch of extra material.

Hard facts first: The release is comprised of a two-disc set, with the feature presentation now coming in at comes in at 100-minutes with an appropriate PG-13 rating due to animated action, violence and some ambiguous nudity.

Language options are standard sub & dub fair, which means the viewer is given the option of running the original Japanese dialog track or an English dub, either of which is presented in Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound. The option to turn on English subtitles exists for either language choice as well.

Extras are quite robust and occupy the entire second disc.  Included: Rebuild of Evangelion: 1.01 (Shiro Sagisu Version, Joseph-Maurice Ravel Version), ""Angel of Doom"" Promotional Music Video, News Flashes, Movie Previews: Preview 1 - Color-corrected version, Beautiful World Version 2, Beautiful World Version 2A, and Beautiful World Version 2B.

The story, while straightforward enough in presentation, has been the source of case studies, web-site devotion, even college thesis throughout the years and hence could never be summarized accurately (with dignity) here. However, to reduce it all down to its most basic levels, a young boy by the name of Shinji is thrust into a world beyond comprehension once an attacking ""Angel"" comes to town. It turns out that Shinji is one of few individuals in the world who possesses the rare ability to pilot the massive synthetic beings/ weapons known as Evangelions.

Reluctantly he allows himself to submit to the whirlwind of life-changing experiences associated with becoming an Evangelion pilot and makes some new friends and discovers more about his own past in the process. Working for a top-secret, underground (literally) organization known as NERV, Shingi's life as an average 14-year-old is forever lost to the reality that his destiny is to be the one to save all of mankind from imminent doom.

So here it is precisely twelve years since this very material graced Japanese movie screens, you may rightfully be wondering what it is that FUNimation is releasing here. The answer is a bit complex, but I'll do my best to set it straight.

Way back in October of 1995, the animated television series Neon Genesis Evangelion made its television debut in Japan. Two years later the work was ""rebuilt"" into a theatrical release that essentially spliced together the key moments of the tale into a larger, single effort. The mission was a success but kind of like what George Lucas has done with his Star Wars franchise, the creators behind the property always felt as though the technology available at the time wasn't quite where they would have liked it to be to accurately present the tale visually. Hence in 2007, the material was revisited once more, this time not simply remastering from the original film stock, but rather breaking the material down into its raw form so as to correct and readjust even the smallest imperfections such as animation density and errant particles as a result of using film. It was not so much an exercise of splicing new CGI effects and eye-candy into the original material as it was about using modern animation methods to perfect the look and feel of the original material. As an added bonus the CG elements allow for visual flair that was, at the time, quite impossible to achieve.

Hence that brings us back to this, the 1.11 release, which is the second official North American release of this rebuilt movie series (it is scheduled to be presented in 4 parts total, with the third and fourth parts being released together). Obviously, part 1.11 represents the introduction to the story.

If the timeline appears confusing, rest assured that sorting it all out is by no means a prerequisite to enjoying the film. It starts quickly with very little time spent establishing back-story and sweeps the viewer into a truly unique world where the precision and color pallet of modern computer generated animation melds seamlessly with the unique look of hand-drawn cells of yesteryear.

Plot wise, the tale is brisk and wonderfully entertaining with battle sequence on the absolute grandest scale broken up by moments of genuine character-development and emotional attachment. Perhaps the greatest of these being the sexual tension that exists between the lead characters or the appearances of the enigmatic father of young Shinji.

Fans, detractors, and scholars alike have gone to great lengths in drawing parallels and comparisons to Evangelion's symbolism throughout the years and yet agreement to or even knowledge of these theories is by no means necessary to come away from the film with satisfaction.

In fact, it has actually surprised me in revisiting this film (which is actually made up of the first six episodes of the original television series) at how much of an influence Evangelion has had over subsequent Giant Robot anime franchises like RahXephon and Aquarion. The show is rife with familiar archetypes such as the young boy being thrust into the role of humanity's savior, the biomechanical weaponry/ interfaces, the enigmatic villains that refuse to reveal their intentions, the impassive corporation behind it all, and the dysfunctional family structure that makes the antagonist question his very purpose of existence. Evnagelion is essentially the framework from which all others have followed.

The direction is simply wonderful with the structure of the film being more an endless succession of perfectly framed scenes than a random display of visuals. The voice acting is also quite notable whether you choose to enjoy the original Japanese dialog track (which is spectacular by the way) or the freshly dubbed English track featuring the talents of some of FUNimation's finest performers. Either option represents the perfect accompaniment to the impeccable visual work.

In all this release marks the beginning of a franchise that has been deserving of revalidation for quite some time. The approach taken with rebuilding the film from the basic elements must surely have been quite an undertaking for all involved but I can attest that the finished product simply oozes with hints of the level of perfectionism sought out in the process. Amazing things are truly possible when such a revered and definitive property receives the loving caress of modern technology's capabilities. Considering the asking price of the new build isn't much higher than the extra-feature-less 1.01 release, this is the recommended choice.",1267574400,444,6915,5.144256455921639
3098859,5,B0012V4WSW,"This remake is one of the best, if not the best one I've ever seen. The artwork, sound, everything is simply GRRRRRRRRREAT! THE BEST PURCHASE I'VE MADE THIS YEAR! The original was cool but all the extra relationship and character building was really unnecessary especially after viewing the remake. Don't even hesitate to make this a prime part of your anime collection. I can't tell you the number of times I've watched it and still enjoy it every time. Hurry up with the next volume will ya! gotta see more of the amazing CG as well! Only a fool would pass on this one!",1265932800,,571,4.5
3098860,5,B0012V4WSW,"As it is with most EVA fans if you've seen the original series all the way through then you'll know pretty much how the story is meant to play out. However, with 1.01 and the following three movies Anno has remade the orginal series. In this reteling he has stated that ""this is how EVA should have been. this is what i wanted it to be."" instead of the original 18 angels there is only 12-13 due to the short timespan in these movies.

In this first installment the movie covers roughly the first 6 episodes of the series. Very few things are changed about the story line itself. In fact this movie is nearly indentical to those episodes, just merely compacted. Some of the major changes inlcude the EVA's looking different. Different in the sense that they are now more relative in shape. Not really scale wise simply that the EVA's forms seem to look more real. The torso's aren't as thin and look more realistic in a sense. Also the two EVA's seen in this first film have some minor chaonges in coloration also. Unit 01 now has a bright green section on its Torso and Unit 00 has been divided between a white lower body and a yellow upper body.

The characters and names have remained the same of course. the only real changes in story line is at the end of the film. During the ecounter with the 5th angel (Ramiel). Orignally this angel was just a floating octahedron capable of firing a bowerful beam and using a mechanical seeming drill to bore through the armor over the Geofront. Now its able to shift its form to some fairly dazziling displays and capable of far more destruction in the movie. Instead of the drill from the OVA it now is able to twist its shape and use its own body/power to drill down to the GeoFront. Along with the changes in this final batal of the movie, the means by which they destroy the angel has been upgraded and looks far better, to me, then it did in the OVA.

For those of us who have seen the entire series these first six episodes of course end with the destruction of the first three angels. however in the retelling the what was once the third angle (the first angel seen in the movie Sachiel) is now the fourth. there is no mention of course of the missing third angel. For new viewers of the series who instead purchased this version might be confused simply becase there is only mention of two other angels. those being Adam and Lilith. Lilith is actually shown and has had one minor change, that being its mask is no longer that of Seele. Its now just a plan tan mask.

In regard to the end of the actual movie. The scene with Kowaru on the moon speaking to the Seele monolith labeled 01. this is a very new and alltoghether never before seen clip for the series. I own the enitre OVA including the two DVD's released to retell the last two episodes of the OVA. Upon watching this movie i couldn't wait to see the remaining three. There are some changes seen in the preview of the second movie. Those being the introduction of Unit 02 and its pilot. there are some minor changes seen to Unit 02 as well in the short preview. There is even a glimpse of the Mark .06 EVA being constructed on the moon.

For those who never watched the series and are new to it i highly suggest watching the OVA first. In 1.01 there is very little description of NERV or Seele. let alone anything else. its all very cryptic and leaves you with alot of questions. It does make for an amazing story none the less. Along the lines of content, this movie has stuck fairly true to the series as i have said before. So for anyone who has seen the OVA i strongly suggest you buy this and even to those new to the series i reccomend you do the same.",1265587200,,3669,4.303907380607815
3098861,5,B0012V4WSW,"I've been a big fan of Neon Genesis Evangelion for many years. I've watched all the original series (and barely made it out alive from 25-26) and absolutely love&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-End-of-Evangelion/dp/B000068OJ1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The End of Evangelion</a>. When I found out they were remaking the series, I was both excited and concerned, but it turns out my fears were alleviated when I finally got to see Evangelion: You Are (Not) Alone.

Gainax took the first few episodes of the series, cleaned up the story, and redrew all the art, amazingly integrated CGI (especially compared to its poor modern usage in anime) and used a movie budget to make something that looks GOOD to watch in 1080p. If you're as big an Eva fan as I am, or even if you just liked some of the series, I'd definitely recommend Evangelion 1.11. They've changed enough of it to flow better in a straight 110 minutes of run time and I didn't want to stop watching for a second.

Now, the real question begins: When will 2.11 escape to the United States?",1265068800,52,1096,5.151685393258427
3098862,5,B0012V4WSW,"This movie, like my title stated, is probability the best remake of anything I have ever seen. Looks awesome, sounds awesome, and feels awesome. What they have done with the story is really good, although you would have to already be an Evangelion fan to really grasp what is going on. I don't know why Amazon is saying the release date is later this year, I have had my copy for 4 months now. I highly recommend getting this and is a must have for any Neon Genesis Evangelion fan boy/girl.",1263772800,8,490,4.395604395604396
3098863,5,B0012V4WSW,"This movie is very good and true to the the original series! There are a few deference from the series, but that the point of the rebuild movies. It has the original voice actors(in Japanese) which that alone is very cool and lets you get a true feelings of Neon Genesis Evangelion.
The Video and Sound Quality are great its has the Dolby TureHD 6.1 Audio sound track. The Visuals are good and the video quality is great.
I would highly recommend Evangelion: 1.11 You Are (Not) Alone to any anime fan!",1263254400,10,501,4.456521739130435
3098864,5,B0012V4WSW,"When it comes to Evangelion I am a sucker, or feel like it. I own almost every (English) DVD release and when it came to the Platinum addition I started a love/hate cycle. I liked what I saw, it had some enhancements, but to say it really justified a full new release... ""Noaye"" :-)

So when I first learned about this release I had my bias opinion ready. The search for even more money had begun. When I saw the first scenes I was convinced that this was nothing more but a remake in a darker tone (where the Platinum edition seems oversaturated this one almost seems too dark) where seemingly nothing had changed set for some new digital animations and a slightly different (sometimes annoying) soundtrack.  Big deal.

I was wrong. And believe me: after buying the Platinum edition and /still/ wondering if I did the right thing this is not something I'll say easily.

And why?  The original series was very enjoyable and pretty awesome but in many ways it was severly limited in what could be done and displayed. Every die-hard Eva fan knows about the extremely brutal (and highly emotional) episodes ""Introjection"" and ""Ambivilence"" (Unit 4 going berserk and the most deadly Angel ever entering Nerv HQ) which almost got Eva pulled from the air. Well, if you thought that was something then you have another thing coming. The beginning of the real EVA.

Now, what would make me say these things?  Simple, its extremely enhanced realism, the extremely crisp looking animation, and the much more mature approach. Lets quickly dive into these topics; Realism... It starts to show during the fight with the second angel. Tokyo 3 was said to be a fortress to proect mankind from the Angels. But isn't it funny how the city could basically only retreat and restore the buildings without any means of active defenses? Heck; does it make sense to face an enemy while having its attention solely focussed on yourself? No it doesn't. And so the new Tokyo 3 has online defenses, and many of them! Resulting in attacking Angels who are also being distracted by these defenses.

Another thing; Shinji attacking the 2nd angel, getting his body virtually pierced and going in for the kill after only a quick ""auch"" and more screaming? No, not logical. Here we get to see how he basically picks himself up to go for the kill in the final stroke. Piloting an Eva is stressfull, and now it shows!

The 3rd Angel (the diamond) shows the second (added to the first) item; good animation and more realism. Instead of pushing some metal drill (powered by energy) into the ground it now basically twists its own body in. And a laserbeam which can level an armored train, blow up half a mountain, and it only shakes an Eva (with inexperienced pilot) and simply shatters a glass window (Nerv mobile HQ)? I don't think so.. And NOW we really get to see the kind of mental stress which piloting an Eva inflicts. After that ordeal you don't just stand up and pick up where you left off. No sirree.

And finally, the more mature approach. The series always had some nudity here and there, but cleverly covered or darkened enough. Not anymore. The children wear no clothes when putting on the plugsuit and thus that is showing, among other things. Enough details to make the story more realistic because its not forcefully covered up while keeping it to such a minimum that it doesn't make you wonder to have picked up some Evangelion hentai-like release. It simply looks and feels more realistic, and that is all.

This release is worth every penny in my opinion. Personally I'm waiting for the English (probably ADV) release but I'm not anxious for the English dubs anymore. I think now is also a good time to watch this in its original language with English subtitles. Thumbs up for me, 5 star rating. My advice; keep an open mind and try watching pieces before forming your opinion on it. This is different!",1229385600,2,3885,4.665204678362573
3098865,4,B0012V4WSW,"This is going to be a hard review to write.  You see, ""Evangelion 1.0: You are (Not) Alone"", the first in a four part ""Rebuild of Evangelion"" series of films, is an almost exact duplication of the first several episodes of one of the greatest science fiction series of all time.  So, having seen the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Neon-Genesis-Evangelion/dp/B000767QTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a>&nbsp;several times do I rate this remake as a standalone for people who aren't familiar with the show or for the hardcore Eva faithful who are going to watch this anyway?  I'll try my best to do both.  Since I already reviewed the series I won't get into why I love it as much as I do (see the NGE link above, mine's the one with the goofy video on it), but I'll tell you what did and didn't work for me this time around.

For the Eva curious, here's a quick synopsis.  ""Evangelion"" focuses on a sort of special forces organization known as NERV, who specialize in making giant robots (Evangelions) who are able to battle strange gigantic beings known as Angels.  These Angels attack the city of Tokyo 3 and conventional weapons are completely ineffective against them.  Thus, the Japanese government is forced to rely on NERV to prevent the Angels from destroying mankind.  Shinji Ikari and Rei Ayanami are two of the only children who are able to pilot the Evas and the story picks up on Shinji's first day on the job where he is forced to sub for an injured Rei and is rushed straight into battle where his Eva promptly falls on it's face and gets pummeled.  His strained relationship with his father (the director of NERV), tendency to wallow in self pity, and inability to connect with his coworkers make for an uncomfortable work environment.  Colonel Misato Katsuragi attempts to take Shinji under her wing and into her house while Rei rejects meaningful contact with him altogether.  The story about self-worth, interpersonal relationships, and the things that drive us to be who we are will play out in the minds of the protagonists, in the halls of NERV headquarters, and on the battlefield facing impossible odds as mankind's last hope.  This is just the beginning of one of the deepest and most epic science fiction stories ever told.

The differences between this film and the early episodes of the television series are annoyingly few. I realize that a similar thing was done with the first two volumes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hellsing-Ultimate/dp/B000H5V8O0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hellsing Ultimate</a>, but there were still enough differences in art, animation, flair, and story to warrant the remake.  This borders on tricking Eva fans into buying the same thing twice. The first hour or so appears to be literal reanimation of the storyboards from the original work, dialogue and all.  The character models are all identical to the show, the score is largely unchanged, even the first two battles play out almost exactly the same as before.  Of the things that were cut, the most annoying was the explanation of Tokyo 3's government: the Magi.  The concept of government by multiple artificial intelligences is a very interesting idea, but one only mentioned in passing in this first film.  Newcomers won't even have a clue what they are talking about.  There is also a shortage of quality character development.  There are just too many characters to introduce and not enough time to sort them out here. Eva simply seems to translate better to a continuous series than to the film medium.  A first movie -even those that are part of a larger story- should be largely self-contained and open to all comers.  This format makes Eva come off as a victim of lazy storytelling and bad pacing.  Maybe once all of the films are released the new big picture will make up for it, but I don't really see this movie converting many new fans.  For now, I'm not impressed with ""Rebuild of Evangelion"" as a new Eva brand.

If you do pick this up, there are some good points. There is some great-looking CG spliced into the film, usually mechanical stuff, weapons, and computer systems, but it looks very cool.  This iteration is also making a conscious effort to foreshadow, which raises my curiosity of what's to come.  The third Angel encounter is a beauty; easily the highlight of the film.  Ramiel (the 5th Angel) is the third battle and the most impressive.  Appearing again as a massive floating octahedron crystal, this time around it morphs into a number of visually dazzling forms and puts out some insane destruction.  The visuals are top-notch and the scenes manage an intensity not even found in the series at this point in spite of the fact that I already knew exactly how it ended.  If only they had put this amount of creativity and work into the preceding hour.  The movie ends on an intriguing and unexpected note that will be meaningless to those new to the series, but may well rock Eva fans.

I was tempted to rate this lower because of the fact that hardly anything important has changed in this retelling of the Neon Genesis Evangelion tale.  But the fact of the matter is I can hardly fault something too much for being too close to one the greatest anime properties ever.  After all, this is better than yet another&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/unnecessary-boxed-set-release/dp/B000VLL0O8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">unnecessary boxed-set release</a>&nbsp;and there is the promise of a new ending to the saga, which few fans will be able to resist.  So we're stuck with re-re-re-re-rewatching Evangelion, this time in a movie format with a little bit of extra here and there for the time being.  It had better be worth it.",1219276800,11,5830,5.0850840336134455
3098866,4,B0012V4WSW,"I watched most of the original TV series of Evangelion and found it to be rather haphazard. Having learned it was made on the cheap, dealt with constant censor issues due to it's time slot, and a director/writer who was using it to explore his own depression issues, it makes slightly more sense. It's an interesting blend of giant robots, navel gazing, fan service (minimal clothing), religious appropriation, self examination of depression, and straight up absurdist storytelling in some cases. It's even more interesting in that they seem to constantly go in and re-edit / remake the story constantly like George Lucas and Steven Speilberg monkeying with their old movies or Ridley Scott's 500 versions of Blade Runner.

Evangelion 1.11 is the newest version. So far, it's my favorite version of it. It's got most of the same beats but it moves quickly and doesn't ever slow down long enough to frustrate you with the waiting for something new that often happens on any TV show, they have a season to fill. None of that fat is here and the story barrels forward not giving you enough time to realize how goofy it all is really. The animation is well done. It looks great. I like the way they subtle updated the looks of characters with the way they handle proportions and the extra frames animation that the movie process and budget affords them.  They have more resources essentially in some cases to add body language that involves motion that the TV series wouldn't allow. You have to use poses when you're missing access to the money to show lots of movement.

It's not all roses as the movie still makes minimal sense. They're interesting in that they use Christian, full disclosure I love Jesus, imagery and prophecies from the book of Revelation but seem utterly uninterested in it. A lot of it feels something like a put on designed to fight the current adopted culture in the way some of the older samurai novels like Tale of The Genji do with Buddhism. It's not so much like they care about the religion itself, which they have blasphemy in ways they aren't expecting but fail in others where it's more obviously intended, but use it at times incorrectly to the detriment of the narrative to stick it to their distaste of current Japanese society. The funnier bit of course is that they have nothing to really replace it with but more of the same if you look at what the series promotes.

It's a fun enough watch. You don't have to be unhappy sitting through filler episodes. Plus, it looks good. I wouldn't recommend it people who'd never seen the original series and fans of the old stuff will find interesting story quirks.",1504137600,3,2639,4.693304535637149

3098910,5,B0012V4WSW,"I watched Evangelion 1.01 : You Are (Not) Alone both because of Interest In the series as well as the chief director of these 3 films Hideaki Anno Is also directing Shin Gojira and I wanted to get a feel of his style and It's safe to say I beyond Impressed. All my friends who watch Anime on the regular have always told me to check out the Evangelion series with high recommends since I'm big on giant beings beating the crap out of each-other. Holy crap this movie Is just.. PERFECT.. where do I begin?

Well for one thing, the animation Is absolutely PERFECT. I loved the mixture of traditional animation and 3D animation! The blending of the two really brought out the best In Anno's directing style and shows he's down to do something different and to do It right! Sound Design wise, the soundtrack Is just awesome & the Inclusion of the Utada Hikaru track Beautiful World at the end was a lovely choice and It honestly made me re-wind the movie a few times. The sounds of the mechanics and the Eva Units were realistic and even while animated, the sound design really brought out the believability In both weight and maintenance, the angels though.. holy crap.. Angel 6 Is without a doubt one of the most beautiful yet scary as hell designs ever! The way this thing would shift to attack was breathtaking and how It's charging sounds were basically a screaming woman In a higher pitch not only stunned me but also made me question the angels and their true nature, that coming from an animated movie just shows the ferocity behind the film's team. I watched the dubbed version of the film and I personally loved everyone's performances, everyone came off well fit to their characters and played them perfectly. No one felt out of place or out of character and they all gave a believable show.
The movie's story Is what I wasn't expecting to like as much as I did. Normally with giant anything In the story, main character backstories are kinda here nor there.. but Attack On Titan proved me wrong and.. so did Evangelion. I cared about Shinji, Rei, Misato & everyone In-between the mix, no one felt just THERE, the backstories & character personal galore made me connect with the main characters and they all felt real! One of the things I really loved with the film was the well balanced out drama and action, the film didn't pull a ""John Carter"" and each bit was just as engaging as the last!

Speaking of which, the drama In the film Is superb as Is the action. Watching Shinji go through the film doubting himself and not being able to accept that he's a good pilot with that emotional struggle was INTERESTING and left me cheering for him until the very end of the movie. Rei was left with some mystery towards her, but she still gave off a strong & cold performance until the end where she begins to break down a few walls. Misato from the beginning I saw as the big sister type, she was funny, unpredictable & In some ways the perfect teacher for Shinji! In the end It's her words that finally end the inner turmoil Inside Shinji's mind, she makes him realize this Is a one size fits all deal, everyone Is at risk. Couldn't give enough praises for the drama! Now, the action. When action hits the screen you feel every bit of It right In the center of your chest, the stakes are high the energy Is catastrophically addicting to watch and no matter your setting, you're cheering, gasping & crying al the way through each fight Is an emotional rollercoaster. I found It rather refreshing how well the drama and action were balanced out & how the team mixed at times was astounding! While the classic trope of ""talking while fighting"" was there, but It didn't feel like a burden and It helped that what was being talked about was Interesting!
Evangelion 1.01 : You Are (Not) Alone was one hell of a ride, I loved every minute! I became Invested In almost every character, I cared about their turmoil and well being, the action sucked me In and delivered an awesome experience In and of Itself. Can't get enough of It!

I was surprised to see this movie was made In 2007 no less, so It's almost on It's way to 10 years old, but you'd never guess that watching the movie. The movie has aged beautifully and I cannot wait to see the next two!

I give Evangelion 1.01 : You Are (Not) Alone a 5/5
and a HIGH recommend!",1466035200,2,4323,4.454545454545454

From the music, to the animation, to the dark and psychotic twists and turns followed by awkward comedic relief, all parts of the show come together perfectly. I can not think of another anime as deep and profound as NGE, nor can I think of one that has sparked so many theories and caused so many heated debates and meme's. Regardless, the Rebuild continuity is a departure from the original series for new fans to get into. If you have never seen the original NGE you will like this as it is very well done and has a tendency to simplify many aspects of the original. If your and NGE buff, you will like this too, but you have to keep an open mind. This was not made for the die hard NGE lover who has read all the manga's, seen every episode of the original (multiple times), watched all Death/Rebirth and EOE, posted in every anime forum, etc. It was made for a new breed of fan to enjoy with new graphics, new music, and additional explanations and twists. It may not be as deep and thought provoking as the original, but as a die hard NGE fan, I must say it's a refreshing take on an somewhat underrated cult anime icon.",1462406400,3,1181,4.300448430493273

Do you like drunken sexy captains of the guard who have a penguin that lives in their refrigerator (with the beer)?

Then this is DEFINITELY the movie for you.

Seriously, it's Evangelion, only... y'know, re-assembled.

In all seriousness, EVA was a hot mess on DVD and this is a sincere attempt to fix it. The transfer from VHS was NOT good, the people doing the frame-by-frame had a bad case of the caffeine shakes and a lot of the subtitling was just dreadful. This is a complete rebuild, so it's not only got cleaned up (redrawn?) animation but all the subs are perfect, the signage works. All the creepy religious symbolism is preserved, it just looks cleaner.

I still prefer the original, but hey. This is still great.

3098919,4,B0012V4WSW,"As a fan of the original series I was excited to finally get into the Rebuild movie series. I was really shocked at how true the film was to the first part of the series. There were some differences toward the end which is a part of the retelling and re-imagination. I suspect this was due to the time constraints of the film. Other areas they went into greater detail than the series originally did. It's a great watch for newcomers and long time fans of the franchise. The only down mark I can give is some parts of the story, such as when Toji punches Shinji, was rushed and hurried with no lead up to why he did it, seemed oddly rushed and de-emphasized as these were big moments for Shinji's growth as a pilot and person. Otherwise, very well done and worth the watch.",1458432000,3,773,4.301369863013699

I hate to say it but this is (visually) really nothing like the original anime was a huge disappointment fresh out the gate. The original artwork was beautifully done with so much depth, deeper colors, gritty and haunting details, but still somehow had a warmth to it with every scene of animation and artwork. This one... (Shaking head sadly) is so ""over done"" with bright, solid, overly cartoon-ish colors that it now reminds me of a children's cartoon like Pokmon or Sailor Moon Crystal. So much of the detail has been lost for sake of a ""rebooted cash cow"" edition.
Now I'm not saying it's ALL bad. Some scenes have extra computerized moments that smoothly enhance the action and the brighter colors really make the Evas pop against the backdrop.
All in all, it really just bums me out to have removed so much of what made this anime a work of art. It truly feels like they painted over a masterpiece just to re-release the series for a quick buck.",1456617600,,1089,4.561224489795919

3098937,4,B0012V4WSW,"So I'm a fan of the original series and have it in the platinum edition. If you haven't, skip a few paragraphs down to hear about only the movie itself.

I kept seeing this item, and then eventually I saw the sequel, and I had no idea what it was. For a long time, I thought it was just a digitally remastered version of the originals, since I know DBZ got it's own make over. And honestly, I hated those new dubs for the characters, and it was a shock that some of those iconic scenes that I associated with my childhood were cut. So seeing these new Evangelion cases on the shelf made me really leery, and I really did not have an interest in indulging what I viewed as a way for the creators to make some more money by polishing off an already established series.

This is not that. At least not entirely. To explain, in case you are in the dark like I was when I finally did cave to my curiosity; this is sort of a reboot, but it is cast in full length movie format and the first half is almost a shot for shot remake. However, after the first Angel, the story begins to deviate a little, splicing in new stuff while peppering in some familiar scenes. Then it completely goes in it's own direction. It's a retelling of the Evangelion saga going more in to the internal dogma and backstory of the Angels and Gendo Ikari, while removing so much focus on Shinji and his angst. While the ending has a moon base and a final reveal of a character that was not present until the end of the original series.

There is a lot of familiar, and there is a lot of difference, and it's not bad. The first iconic battle in particular shook me a bit because it sounded familiar, but some of the musical timing was off from what I remember. It seems like a familiar place, but almost like someone has gone in while you were gone and shifted things 2 inches to the left just to see if you would notice. It's a weird feeling. Maybe it's the nostalgia I *feel* for the original that made me notice. The original saga felt like a classic anime in its style and atmosphere, plus more focus on the characters. So it's difficult to say which I like better. If it's possible, they enhance one another when juxtaposed. The each did something better than the other.

[ Item Review ]
The original aside, this movie was entertaining, action packed, and removed a lot of Shinji's kicking and screaming (which I think is a plus). The film focuses on the young teenager named Shinji Ikari, who is asked to pilot a giant mech known as ""Evangelion Unit-01"" to protect NERV, the organization, from the giant creatures known as ""Angels."" The plot is largely a point-for-point adaptation of episode 01 up to episode 06 of the original anime. While most scenes and events are replications of the original series, some unfold differently with new or omitted scenes.

Visually an impressive feat as everything is polished and crisp. The detail is intricate and color palette is vivid. This movie retelling feels shiny and new, and puts more work into the visuals especially where the Angels are concerned. The Sixth Angel, Ramiel, in particular received a beautiful make over.

If you haven't seen the series, this is well made condensed version of that story, which was already a phenomenal tale of human origins and the human condition. Interwoven into the mecha battles are deep themes as to what it is to be human, and what does it cost to continue to exist, what is existing. It is dialed down a smidge when compared to the shows, but this is the ""condensed"" version. The action is coordinated well and paces itself with the story expertly. I would still suggest seeing the original just because of it's cult classic status, but this movie does an excellent stand-in job if you can't get a hold of the show.",1435276800,,3776,4.457308248914616

For me, this looks amazing, in comparison to the platinum box collection released in 2007 - not by much, but there is a noticeable difference. However, for me, all that gave the series episodes depth and interest has gone. To use a mate-desirability analogy, this release is a bit like a supermodel that looks stunning but is superficial in character and acts like someone you have no desire to spend any time with, to put it politely.

Yes, this release looks great, but all the interaction between characters has been cut out and we don't really get to know the characters or gain any understanding of their personalities - possibly because there is not time for them to shine. What we get is one ""bot attack"" after another. I think this was done just to squeeze as many episodes as possible in to a single film. These fights look great, but what we have is fight after fight with very little discernible story. I couldn't empathise with any of the characters, consequently, I didn't care much for what little story there was. At the end, I really wasn't bothered about seeing the subsequent films.

What lets this film down even more is the time between subsequent films. This is one of three, but the time between each release is >1yr.

I was not impressed with this release. Let's hope that the long awaited ""live action"" version, if it ever actually happens, is more true to the original episodes of the series. In summary, I'd say avoid this and go for the aforementioned 2007 platinum box set.",1421452800,,1546,4.631386861313868

3098985,2,B0012V4WSW,"I'm reviewing 1.11 and 2.22 together.

These remakes of Evangelion are pretty, but they really mishandle the best parts of the original series;  The original show is flawed, but what makes it brilliant in my opinion is the gradual realization of what's really going on, which makes you suddenly wonder towards the end if you've been rooting for the wrong side the whole time.  I was also genuinely shocked and horrified at the revelation of Rei's true nature.  In these remakes, however, that's all either explained right up front and then expanded on or heavily hinted at to the point of being obvious.  It turns out what comes across as sinister and disturbing when it's left mostly mysterious is just a bunch of kooky nonsense when you explain it all.

It's sort of like if someone remade the original Star Wars trilogy to begin with Obi-wan explaining to Luke, ""Darth Vader is your father, but he's a real jerk now, and you have the power of the Force because of these microscopic organisms called midichlorians in your blood,"" and then the plots proceed mostly like you remember, but with subplots thrown in about Darth Vader having an ugly custody battle with Aunt Beru and how all the Force users need this special energy drink to keep their midichlorian counts up.  It doesn't solve any of the original's problems and somehow manages to create new ones.

Also, they add a new glasses girl character in the second installment who seems either like a Mary Sue insert or a throwaway to the erotic fan art crowd. She's better at piloting an eva than anyone else, and she knows all about the back story of what's going on, so she just makes it all the weirder that the show and the other characters are all focused on Shinji, who's still just as annoying as ever.",1410566400,,1766,4.637820512820513

With 1.11, they edit a lot of those out, so it seems faster paced and gets to the action pieces quicker.

Anyhow, when I heard about the Rebuild movies, I couldn't wait to get more Eva, and this gorgeous little movie didn't fail to sate my obsession.

Animation was beautiful (even the CG animation looked fine, and I usually loathe CG), Shinji and Misato's original VAs came back to voice, and overall this is one great anime film. Think of it as the first 6 episodes, but with the budget we wished it had.

My only two complaints are Ritsuko's VA Colleen Clickenbeard, who's usually pretty good, coming off as flat, and not getting to hear Cruel Angel's Thesis, but that's just nitpicking.

It also is easier on people who are new to the series since it is more digestible (to put it some way).

To those that don't know Evangelion: this is not for those with strict religious beliefs and are easily offended, this is not for children, this is violent and has a lot of adult content.

Also a warning to the fans, I hated the third movie and think this reboot is only good until Evangelion 2.22 (although I haven't watched the 4th one yet).",1390348800,,701,4.343511450381679

Shinji goes through this and other ordeals in a lonely manner, feeling unwanted and unloved and is only able to go through it as he grows attached to Rei, the first pilot of an EVA (00) who has been injured before his arrival and whom also seems to attract the attention and affection of his father.",1390262400,,663,4.533333333333333

3099043,4,B0012V4WSW,Evangelion 1.11 basically gathers the first part of the anime series into a movie. The action is great and the characters are good too. Shinji struggles a lot with teen angst. But that's okay. Evangelion is a great series that many people should enjoy!,1388620800,,252,4.75
3099044,5,B0012V4WSW,Simply put if you were a fan of the original series than you are going to love these movies. They do a great job of holding true to the series when needed and adding new elements also. If you've never seen the original Neon Genesis Evangelion than I recommend giving this a try first. The show had some issues with dragging on and having spots that just became boring. These movies on the other hand skip that part but keep the story and characters 100% intact and they add new things that improve the whole show. This is a must have for any anime fan.,1388188800,,552,4.266666666666667

3099051,4,B0012V4WSW,"This review is a little late, as I got this about a week ago. I tried to cope with not writing one about the shipping and packaging, but it finally got to me.

I love the Rebuild series much more than the original Neon Genesis Evangelion show much more, mainly because both the original ending and End of Evangelion, in my opinion, were terrible. The rebuild gives much more satisfaction on how the story progresses with renewed animations and (for the most part) a new plot.

The shipping time was amazing. Bought the standard of 3-5 business days and received it in 2 days, much quicker than anticipated.

Unfortunately, I had to give this a 4/5 star rating. If I were rating the movie alone, I would have definitely rated it 5 stars in a heartbeat, but...

How the DVD was shipped was disappointing. The box used was quite larger than the DVD cases themselves, which is normal and fine. What wasn't fine was they used a really terrible form of packaging / wrapping. There were 3 small pouches of bubble wrap on top, one which was already popped. There was no type of bubble wrap protecting the sides and corners of the cases. (IE: The case didn't lunge forward or backwards, but slid all around the box. I confirmed this by putting in Finding Nemo. The case is the same measurement and I re-wrapped it using the same methods, shook the box for about 10 seconds, and got the same results as when I first opened the package.) The case came dented on all corners of the case, the clear wrap around the box was partially torn open (very small, but still). One of the corners of the DVD case when i pulled out of the shipping box was also torn.

To most people, this isn't a big deal. They'll probably even argue with me that I should get over it, it's not that big of a deal, etc. I'm not one of those people and these types of things bug me greatly. I believe that if you're going to ship out a product, it should be done properly. I'm happy the DVDs themselves are in perfect condition, but having the case like this makes me quite angry. Please use better packaging in the future.",1386028800,,2082,4.383419689119171
3099052,2,B0012V4WSW,"Do not waste you time if you have not seen and loved the originals.
If you never saw the originals, you need to be prepared to have no idea what is going on, while you're constantly being forced to sit through a boy's sniveling teenage emo angst.

Honestly, I wanted to like this incredibly drawn, highly acclaimed anime but couldn't, because it was terrible.
My memories of the original show were that it started as a great mech anime, with a bit too much Catcher in the Rye complaining, that devolved into a pseudo-intellectual waste of time.  My hopes for this re-cut were high, with the original being visually impressive, and this being an improvedment, but it had two huge flaws.
First, they threw you into the world with almost no context at all.  If I had not seen the originals, I would have had no idea what was going on for the first 45 minutes.  I was trying to show this to a friend in first sitting, and didn't stop asking questions.
Second, they kept all of Shinji's whining nonsense.

The handful of minutes spent on the amazing fight scenes was not enough to make up for the rest of the show.

Maybe 2.22 and 3.33 were done better, but I'll never know unless they show up on Netflix.  I'm not wasting another dime on boring teenage angst.",1385596800,3,1255,4.454148471615721

I swear I am looking at the same animation sometimes because they are so similar to my VHS tapes but they aren't.  Every frame is super sharp and detailed.  It just looks super amazing in HD.

All our favorite characters are here, and even the American voice dub of Shinji is annoying like before.  I just wish he wasn't so annoying, but I guess that is his character.

If you are a fan of Evangelion, you need to pick this up.",1385424000,,603,4.182608695652174

I highly recommend it, though be sure you know what you are getting into before you dive headfirst into it.",1383609600,,397,4.5

I would reccomend it to fans of Evangelion, mecha anime, or animation in general. The blu-ray clarity is awesome and makes every detail visible.

I was a bit bummed that the film didn't have an audio commentary, however, the other features and the film itself more than  make up for it.

Check out the second film, Evangelion 2.22, as well!

3099061,3,B0012V4WSW,"Ever since the release of Rebuild 3.33 my opinions on this film are very mixed and kind of undecided. For one thing, seeing Evangelion with updated animation is very nice, and the re-telling of the first 6 episodes is handled competently, albeit lacking a few very important details I would have loved to see updated. The huge problem is how this first film feel so disconnected from the other two movies of the franchise. 2.22 did a decent job of balancing the old and the new, while 3.33 went off-the-rails bonkers trying to do a new ""thing"" while at the same time being an unoriginal rehash of episodes 23-24. So, in the wake of the second and third films, the first one feels disjointed and abandoned given that Studio Khara decided that they weren't simply gonna do a rehash... even though they did just that with the third film. I suppose I still enjoy it, even though my opinion of the Rebuild series has reached an all-time low. Eva fans will have no choice but to see it, but to non-fans I don't recommend it. I also wish it could have been a little longer, it's not like it wasn't gonna rake in some revenue.",1382918400,4,1118,4.458536585365854

3099072,5,B0012V4WSW,"Overall, this is an excellent film. I couldn't have been happier with how it was portrayed to a modern audience. For those unfamiliar with the Evangelion series: it was a very popular anime created in the late 90's that undermined the mech-anime genre. The series has maintained a faithful audience after it's show's end. It focuses on pilot Shinji Ikari as he struggles with the responsibility of being a pilot as well as the psychological damning associated with his father. The original series is incredibly complex and occasionally outright perplexing, but seriously rewarding to watch. This ""rebuild,"" as the show's creator describes it, is a great way to test the waters. For newcomers to the show you will be given an altered version of the original storyline with updated graphics and a more linear story progression. While this may be upsetting for die-hard fans of the original, I found it refreshing to see the story take on a new perspective, and some of the changed (more clearly explained) material helped me better understand the original series.

While I would recommend the original series as a superior story, you can't go wrong with the ""rebuild,"" especially when you consider the price of the original series is incredibly expensive due to its discontinued printing. The original series is great, but I am equally captivated by the changes done to the four movie interpretation. With the next two movies releasing in the following years, I am eagerly anticipating their release to see how Evangelion Rebuild concludes the quadrilogy.",1378684800,,1553,5.090196078431372
3099073,1,B0012V4WSW,"I avoided this series for a long time because I thought it would be nothing but giant robots fighting monsters, which is cool and all, but I could never commit to a whole series based on that alone. But when I heard that it's actually more about character development, I became hopeful, and decided to check out the movie at least.

And... it was pretty much giant robots fighting monsters. It is real clear that this was the driving force of the film, as these scenes were beautiful. But the characters that I were promised were amazing... They fell completely flat. There is no depth to them at all, and any development seemed extremely forced. I could not get invested in them at all, and did not care if they lived or died. It was a chore to finish this film, and I do not think I shall be watching the others.

Now, to be fair, I STILL haven't watched the series. This review is for the film itself. For all I know, the characters in the show are GREAT, but if they are anything like they are here, then I will surely be avoiding that as well.",1378425600,2,1048,4.287878787878788

The artwork/animation is fine, English dub is very good (I'm yet to be anywhere near competent in Japanese) Voice actors reprise their roles throughout multiple versions of this ""juggernaut"" of the anime world, which is a good thing.

3099145,5,B0012V4WSW,"The Rebuild of Evangelion kicks off with this movie, the first of a four-movie epic that is still in the making.

To be clear, you don't need to see a single thing of Eva to be comfortable watching this movie. But, fans of the movie won't be left with another Death & Rebirth. The first Evangelion movie was a bit of a snore-fest for fans, as it was basically a compilation of scenes from all the past TV episodes of the series, leading up to the final movie and episodes 25-26.

Instead, Eva 1.11 represents a retelling of the series that will both welcome new fans, and leave old fans scratching their heads.

Part of the mystique around Eva 1.0/1.11 (1.11 is simply 1.0 with some minor improvements, you're watching Eva 1.0 if you get this movie), is the lingering question of what Eva 1.0 represents.

It is difficult to answer the question of if Eva 1.0 is a remake or not, even watching the movie completely through. Bottom line, if you enjoyed Eva in the 1990s, you will enjoy Eva 1.11. It isn't simply 1990s footage rendered/upscaled in HD. The movie has been hand-crafted for viewing in theaters, and the light use of computer generated animation only benefits the all-new, all-HD hand-drawn scenes.

But please, watch it in Japanese with English Subtitles. It's the only proper way to enjoy Eva (and I'm saying that as a fan of the English dubbed voice actors).",1355616000,,1371,4.602459016393443

3099148,5,B0012V4WSW,"Just so you know, this is the definitive version. There was a previous DVD/bluray release that came out too dark, so they fixed it, and re-released it.

Now on to the real review...

The original Eva was a landmark series, and I am a great big fan of Evangelion (I own the series, the movies, the Manga, etc). I don't believe in trying to sell people on my fandom, but I want to give my honest review of this movie.

What should be made clear is this is not a good starting point. The movie is an abridged version of the first six episodes of the series, so the pacing feels off. The movie assumes you're already familiar with the characters, so it tries to get to the interesting parts quicker.

Some of the most ardent Eva fans might say they dumbed it down. Made more action-y. Things that were only hinted at before get boldly explained. The truth is, there will be no time to talk about it later.

I was tempted to give it a 4, because it's not friendly to new viewers, but I was thoroughly impressed by the movie's visuals. This is not a simple HD up-scaling of the TV series. They went back to the drawing board and remade the series.

-All new animation.
-Digital Ink.
-Widescreen.
-HD Quality.

Oh, my god, it looks FREAKING BEAUTIFUL! You have to get it on Bluray, and the bigger screen, the better. Don't settle for DVD.

This is the first time seeing anything to do with the series, so I was unsure what to expect.  I read all of the other reviews that gave the title 5/5 and raved about it, so I decided to buy it and see for myself.  All I really knew about the series is that it had to do with gigantic mechs, but I had no idea about anything else in the movie plot.  I found myself pretty confused in the beginning, since I had no idea what the ""Angels"" were, where they came from, and what was going on.  By the end of the movie, I had a slightly better idea, but I think the movie could have explained a little more and given a little more of the back-story.

Technical Aspects

From the packaging, down to the art style of the animation, everything is top-notch.  The Blu-ray packaging is really cool; the interior case has this kind of purplish-iridescent plastic (doesn't really impact anything, but was a really unique addition.  Really cool.).  It also comes with a small art-book (I haven't really looked at the whole thing yet).

The surround sound is really awesome.  I was really impressed with how well the sound and animation is.  I have the Blu-ray edition of ""Ponyo,"" and this movie has some really awesome surround sound, so I kind of use this as my benchmark.  Evangelion 1.11 stacks up very well with ""Ponyo,"" as far as surround-sound goes (excellent).

The animation, and the intricate detail of the machinery of the city are really awesome.

Story/summary

The main character is a whiny, emasculated male, and that was pretty annoying to watch.  I cared more about the other protagonist, the girl Rei, than I did the main protagonist (she was much more of a likable character, and showed real bravery).  Regardless, I give the movie a 4/5, because, even though the back-story isn't as fleshed out as it could be, and the main character isn't very likable (and annoying, actually), I still think the movie as a whole is very good.  Also, part of the one star that I took away from a perfect score was because of my personal taste--I really did not think the mechs were as cool as I expected.

I've also purchased Evangelion 2.22, and after I watch that, I will have more time to reflect on the first movie (I suspect if you watch both together, it will improve the overall experience).",1352419200,2,2492,4.85781990521327
3099151,5,B0012V4WSW,"The series was great! This movie is the first four episodes together, but it is easier to tell what the characters are thinking. I suppose there was some added character development scene that way someone new to the series could understand what kind of people they are dealing with. I was... 14 when I first saw the series and would recommend it to anyone who likes to watch characters grow, giant robots (evas) battle, or even just jam out to the music. The only problem with the series I had was the fanservice, but I got used to it after a while. This is a legendary anime brought to the big screen with beautiful animation. You are missing out if you haven't seen this or at least the series. WATCH IT!!!

This movie got me into the Evangelion fanbase, and I love it even more now.  The animation is several notches above the original by successfully merging CGI and pencil-drawn animation together, and it really shines during the action scenes (which are spectacular).  The characters are far more likeable this time around, seeing as how this is the beginning of a four-film remake of the original series, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and the voice acting is far superior to the series (like everything else is).  I have almost nothing but good things to say about this product.
The battle against the sixth angel at the end is when this movie REALLY gets good, although it was already good, the whole second half of the movie when this angel comes in is when things REALLY get going.  That, and the developing relationships of the characters, made this movie AMAZING.
The bad:
When I opened it, the first disc was loose, but nothing was broken or scratched and the DVDs were in perfect condition still.  Another minor complaint is that the beautiful packaging can get smudged by fingerprints all too easily.
But overrall, FIVE OUT OF FIVE (though I may be biased, since I'm a huge fan).  This movie hooked me from beginning to end.",1350345600,,1520,4.7272727272727275

3099159,3,B0012V4WSW,"While I can say that Rebuild is definitely not a waste of your time if you are an Eva fan, this particular installment will probably not leave you particularly satisfied. Whereas the next movie in the Rebuild continuity effortlessly goes into new territory that at times surpasses the original series, Rebuild of Evangelion: You Are (Not) Alone will mostly feel like feature length recap of the first six episodes of the series, from when Shinji Ikari first fights the Angel Sachiel to the climactic Yashima Operation.

The main problem is the fact that the six episodes were written to be episodic, obviously,  which doesn't exactly translate well to being stitched together into a two hour movie. Some content has also been cut, as well - notably, the scene after the battle with Sachiel when Eva 01's headpiece falls off to reveal its true nature has been cut out, though, unless you are new to the Evangelion universe, you probably already know all about what the Evas really are. Ultimately, both those that are new to Evangelion as well as the existing fanbase will probably feel as if this is simply setup for what is to come.

It isn't all for nothing, though, especially if you are new to Evangelion and weren't able to make it through the TV series' laborious, monster-of-the-week first ten episodes. There is some new content, as well - towards the climax of the movie, we are shown the reason why the angels are attacking NERV (spoiler: NERV has a giant alien monster in their basement),and there's a scene at the end involving the mysterious Kaworu Nagisa that brings with it some unexpected twists.

Overall, this may be a good starting point for those new to the series, and I can guarantee you that sitting through this is worth it for the second Rebuild movie. Those who have seen the original series, however, should probably best just skip right to 2.0, unless, like myself, you are a diehard Eva fan.",1334102400,,1920,4.756756756756757
3099160,5,B0012V4WSW,"I am by no means a hardcore Anime fan but I enjoy and appreciate the art of the animation medium. I had seen the original EVANGELION TV series on DVD back in the late `90s and enjoyed the series. When I saw this remake and it's second part (2.2 You Can (Not) Advance), I was blown away by the quality of direction, story and technical achievement. This is a fresh, complicated, original and highly moving storyline that bears multiple viewings and maybe even some research online to really drill down and understand the complexities of the story's characters and actions.

I was also very impressed with the marriage of traditional and digital animation by this director and crew of artists. I've seen a lot in the world of animation storyboarding and direction over the decades but this film had me re-winding to see some amazing action sequences again and again. This is a film series that many artists learning the trade today should study.

I cannot possibly top the well written and detailed reviews of others here in describing plot or other important details of this film series production. Just wanted to toss in my two-cents and recommend this volume and it's follow up, 2.2, to fans of the genre or students of animation in general.

EVANGELION is not for children nor those who have no tolerance for the sci-fi or Anime genres in general. But judging by how my daughter reacted to seeing it for the first time, this series should please a great many teens and young adults looking for more depth and complexity in their characters than just young heroes who venture off in giant robots to defend humanity from strange creatures",1332028800,,1638,4.7403508771929825
3099161,4,B0012V4WSW,"Evangelion 1.11 is basically a retelling of the Neon Genesis Evangelion TV series ep1-6 with very few deviations from the original. Of course, this is a decade newer with a much larger budget, so the animation quality itself is vastly superior, spectacular by every sense of the word. If I have any complaints they are that this new version simplifies the characters and their faults (in my opinion, the crowning achievement of the original show) and instead focuses more on action and intense battle scenes. However, this directorial decision also makes the whole thing more streamlined and accessible for the average anime fan. Finally, the English dub of this film is fantastic, practically as good as the original Japanese audio and that's saying something!

Here's a list of everything you get with this DVD purchase:

-A 16 page booklet which includes official artwork, character profiles, etc.
-A short making of feature ""Rebuild of Evangelion 1.01"" which shows a bit of the animation process, there is no dialogue and there are two versions featuring different musical pieces
-Previews, news flashes, and trailers
-""Angel of Doom"" music video (wonderful new musical composition by Shio Sagisu)
-English and Japanese audio and subs

3099162,4,B0012V4WSW,"A few years back, I heard the Evangelion anime series described as ""the Watchmen of anime.""  I rented the first disc (episodes 1-4 of the original edition) and thought ""Eh, it's okay.""  A couple of months ago, I decided to give the series another shot by buying 1.11.  Wow.  The story is pretty much the same as before (of episodes 1-6, I gather), but the animation quality is so much better.  I would call it ""state of the art"" if I knew what the state of the art is, but the CGI and painted animation blend together beautifully.  The Sixth Angel in particular...but I suppose I should describe the story.

In the near future, the Earth has been under attack by giant beings called ""Angels.""  During an event called ""The Second Impact,"" half of the population of the world was destroyed.  The NERV organization has built an enormous base underground in Japan from which they operate the Evangelions (Evas for short), which are apparently gigantic mechanical-organic robots.  These Evas can only be piloted by certain teenagers (for reasons which may be explained later).  Most of the plot of this first film deals with Shinji Ikari (pilot of Eva unit 01) as he fights the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Angels.

If the series were nothing but giant robots (or mechas) fighting giant monsters, it wouldn't be as interesting as it is.  Some people complain about ""whiney Shinji,"" but how would you feel if all of a sudden you were required to pilot a giant robot, having had no training of any kind, and if you fail the human race will end?  And the man who created the Evas is your father and your mother died when you were a baby and now you're living with a hot 29 female year old Lt Colonel and this kid at school puched you in the face and there's this other Eva pilot who you kinda like, but she has blue hair and she's so spaced out she seems inhuman and...well.  Also, behind NERV is a secret society called Seele, whose members speak of ""Lilith"" and ""the Human Instrumentality Project.""  What are they up to?  Well, you'll have to continue with the series to find out.

Ratings-wise, I suppose it would be PG-13 due to violence and a few moments of fanservice.

I suppose if someone told me Watchmen was the best comic of all time and then handed me issue #1, I would have thought, ""Eh, it's okay.""

I have seen this over and over again I was attempting to figure out what the hype was all about and Well in my Opnion (IMO) They should not have ""Remade"" This series.  The orginal you have to take alot in it had some great action and awesome grapgics for its time, The orginal story jumped around alot and it seemed that the ending was done to quickly, the orginal did not take ""IMO"" enough time to explain the main Charaters and made them either realy Winny, Exstreamly tempermental or Emotionaly blank...The orginal I would of given 3 perhaps 4 stars b/c even with some of the flaws you still had a awesome Scf-fi anime but in all that was the Orginal series.

However this is a remake of the orginal series and I do see that they cut alot out to add some eye candy to this generation of Anime viewers. Personaly I think they did a poor job of it and should not of messed with something that had flaws to begin with.

But on a side note it's still a Sci-fi anime with loads of action but b/c of the cuts and the trimming they made I do think they made it much much worse.",1324080000,3,1132,4.131818181818182

3099171,2,B0012V4WSW,"This is a review of the DVD edition.  This is basically a retelling of episodes 1 through 6 of the original series.  Actually, let me correct that, it is essentially the original series, only condensed into two hours.  All the highlights from the original are here, essentially without change -- except to exaggerate them in unwelcome ways.  And in the process of condensing the story and attempting to intensify certain dramatic highlights, a lot of what made the original series worth watching has been lost.  The animation is essentially identical (save for the Angels, which are markedly improved).  The depth and nuance that made the original so surprising, has been lost in the translation.  The epic battles with the Angels, which kept you on edge throughout the original, lose most of their impact from being condensed to two minute vignettes, over and done with before you can start to care.  And the worst, the musical score is like something from a James Cameron movie.  Knowing where the original series was headed, in hindsight, the whole point behind Hideaki Anno's original project appears lost in the attempt to make everything bigger, brighter, and more marketable.  I hear the second is much better, and I can only hope so, having already purchased it.  If you're thinking of purchasing this, do yourself a big favor and purchase Neon Genesis: Evangelion discs 0:1 and 0:2 of the original anime series instead.",1319846400,4,1428,4.9831223628691985
3099172,5,B0012V4WSW,"Well, I thourghly enjoyed this version of Evangelion.  The graphics were movie quality.  The Engilsh dub is on par with the original.  Story and plot were chillingly excellent.

However, I could tell there were changes in their voices.  They are older now, so that is understandable, but I their original voices fit better.  Another thing I noticed is that there isn't that same emotional spirit in 1.11 compared to the English dubbing of the original series.  Just compare the emotional joy you can hear out of Ritsuko when she says, ""He's walking!"" in the first episode of the original, versus Ritsuko exclamation in 1.11.  You could tell that the voice actors had a lot of fun doing the original.  But, they still do a stellar job of the English dub in 1.11.

Another thing that fans may or may not like, is that 1.11 is more condensed.  There is no filler at all.  This is good because the story progesses quickly and is more condusive to action and a sense of urgency.  However, the character developement is reduced.  But not reduced so much that the characters lose their emotion, their feelings, their reason for being.  The difference in character developement between the series and 1.11 is that the series had more time.  In the first 5-8 episodes of the series where we see Ayanami's life is completely desolate; in 1.11 her life is empty.  In the series Ayanami's life cuts our soul, in 1.11 her life hurts us deeply.  This is pretty much the same for most of the other characters.  Character developement is absolutely great.  But its hard to compare with the series that had 3-4 times more time to develope their characters.

You'll be relieved to know that the plot, pacing, timing, etc, etc, ... still retains its Hitchcockishness.  The complexity and mood wrenching is completely intact.

For those who have seen the OVA, this is basically a turbo-charged retelling of it meaning that nearly everything's redone with today's computer technologies giving it a mega budget feel.

You Are Not Alone encompasses about a third of the original OVA with new material that sheds more light on the relationship between Shinji and his father including a funeral scene. Unlike the OVA, this feature is easier to get into, which, depending on what you thought of the denseness of the OVAs can be good or bad. Not to say that this feature isn't ""deep"" its that this feature backs off of some of that so  that you can appreciate the main justification for its existence, its visuals, and here they are nothing short of extraordinary augmented with the cgi elements they've added. And the EVAs in this one are even brighter and more deeply colored and truly neon.

This remake project, beginning with 1.11, promises to take the Evangelion mythos in directions both eerily similar, yet drastically different from its previous incarnation.

This first installment covers the expository story arc from episodes 1-6 of the orgiginal TV series. Its subtle changes in plot, tightening of the script and scores of visual enhancements were refreshing. All of the original animation has been scrubbed and polished and has never looked better.

From a visual and audio standpoint, the blu-ray version of 1.11 is fantastic. At the bargain price for which this blu-ray disc can be had, it's a must buy. Don't even waste your time with the standard DVD version. Sadly, there isn't a lot of substantial bonus material on the disc, but there's no arguing that Funimation's presentation is first-rate.

As soon as the feature starts you can see what's familiar and what's not. The image quality is outstanding for starters and the addition of CGI does wonders to the story without getting in the way, thankfully. What starts as subtle differences soon become the real points that give you a sense of the actual, new direction the filmmakers are taking. This is good. I'm glad it's not just a frame by frame rebuild but rather a re-adaptation. Some scenes you don't get anymore, and to be honest some of them I missed them.

The score is different too and I wonder why they changed it since at most of it to me sounds as good as the original. I'm not very impressed by changes being done just for the sake of change, you're going to take out something, make sure you replace it with something better.

Still, what you get once the credits start rolling is a different sensation. The feature length changes the pace of the original, this one you don't have to absorve it 20 or so minutes at a time, and that's good too.

3099187,4,B0012V4WSW,"This is a review for the Blu-Ray version of Evangelion 1.11 You Are Not Alone.  First off there is very little I can say that hasn't already been said.  Be that as it may I would offer a few cents of my own.

First the image quality looks awesome on my 1080P LCD tv.  Evangelion has never looked better.  Second while I only have a 2.1 sound system, the 6.1 HD audio track sounds impressive.  I am especially impressed at the work done on the US english dub.  The US audio engineer didn't lay the english voice track on top of the sound but blended all sound tracks together.  The end result is a sound track resembling a summer action block buster theatric release.  While the japanese audio emphasizes the dialog track over all other sounds as usual.

On the other hand this disc appears to be lacking in extras considering the storage capacity of a blu-ray disc.  The slick container and information booklet don't quite makeup for the lack of on disc extras.

As for the story itself, I consider this version to be an alternate universe.  While it appears to be the first six tv episodes, with better graphics, there are subtle differences from the very beginning.  Keep this in mind and you most likely won't have a fit.",1307491200,,1224,4.479638009049774
3099188,5,B0012V4WSW,"The series reboot of Evangelion is the best thing to happen since the reboot of Fullmetal Alchemist. In this, you'll find that the retelling of the story is (not) the same as it was before. You don't meet any new characters in 1.11, but you'll find that the characters are brought up better, and the story goes pretty fast (because of it being a feature film). For Neon Genesis fans, you'll find that Shinji isn't so whiny anymore (take note that I said ""isn't so"") and he actually has ""dropped one"". The visuals in 1.11 are amazing to say the least. If you have a Blu-Ray player, get it so you can watch it in HD (Again, for previous fans of the show: Ramiel looks so cool). It's fun to look at, and there's plenty of action in this to keep an Otaku and a person new to anime excited.

Pros: Story retelling, new characters and improvements to the previous characters.
  Stunning visuals, especially in HD.
  Action-packed.
  Not episodic.
  Lots of Extras.

Cons: The story does go pretty fast, so those of you who didn't watch Neon Genesis Evangelion might get a little lost.

On a side note for Parents: It is boarderline PG-13 - R. It is mildly graphic in violence. There is mild language, but no F-Bombs for those of you that care.

Rating 5/5. Good job Funimation, and you too Hideki Anno. Also, the Japanese track is available. I recommend you watch it both ways. I love the english cast, and the japanese cast is amazing too. (Whoo for Spike Spencer!!!)",1306713600,,1462,4.496212121212121

The film itself however just didn't really grab me.  It wasn't bad at all, and I am mildly interested in seeing the second one.  It seemed like you could definitely see that it was a very truncated form of it's original self.  At least that's how it came across to me.  It seemed to move forward fairly quickly without much explanation of anything that was going on and then it just ended.

Still, if you are a fan of this, then I would highly recommend the blu-ray as the price is good and the quality of the release is high.",1306454400,4,678,4.333333333333333

If you're wondering if you should upgrade to this from previous releases, you need only know this is hands down better than all previous Evangelion releases! So much so, in fact, that this is worth the fee for the upgrade if you ""already have it"". As you can tell by the product description all the video (now 1080p) and audio (now Dolby TrueHD 6.1 for both EN and JA) has been redone. The result with regards to that is not just everything looking and sounding better, but it also packing more of a punch every step of the way throughout. Another nice improvement here is that it is much more seamless than it was originally. The disks are running at about 100 minutes in length - and it isn't butchered into 20 minute episodes padded with superfluous openings and endings - instead it's presented in one fluid piece of anime goodness.",1306195200,,975,4.577142857142857

The redone scenes are phenomenal, and the content of the original show is truncated down to a pace that suits a single-sitting movie's timeframe.

Watching this movie first will be an enjoyable experience, but in the long-run you'll be left feeling a bit confused, as the full experience manages to do that to first time viewers despite its full content.

3099193,5,B0012V4WSW,"I have heard about Evangelion, the manga and the TV series, from friends who are clear mecha-anime fans and they gave it their full support.  But I was bit unsure of getting into the series, which meant spending loads of money to buy box sets of DVDs and spending time to get emotionally involved.  Fast forward to today, and I see these rebuilds of the original series for sale, which are films that combine the material essences of the franchise with updated touches, shades, 3D CGI support, animation sequences, and new elements to flesh out the original creator's desires with new tools of animation at his team's disposal.

I have never watched a Neon Genesis Evangelion episode, so I was treated to an instant classic even though I was never exposed to its storyline one bit.  An intense storyline combined with imagination that is timeless, I see why Evangelion is the prime series where other mecha draw instant inspirations.  The animation and the art of this re-boot is simply fantastic, bringing modern Tokyo-3 looking like today's Tokyo but with the futuristic mold of the not too distant future with mechs and more mechanized buildings.  The action sequences are intense, but never go beyond overload; the climatic scene when facing the 6th Angel is stupendous.

Though a cliche anime story of a young boy who is pulled out of nowhere to save mankind from certain doom and follows his angst and struggles along the way, its nonetheless a timeless tale that really shows why it pushed the world of anime into a new realm staring in 95'.  A new fan myself was treated to see why that is...",1305244800,,1600,4.750902527075812

3099195,3,B0012V4WSW,"As a diehard Evangelion fan, 1.11 is hard to explain. It is neither a remake nor a re-imagining... it falls somewhere in between. 95% of the original is still intact, but the 5% cut out is what bothers me.

PROS
- The animation is completely redone, but uses most of the original animation cells as reference so it's almost identical.
- Much improved visual effects and audio over the original.
- Added scenes, re-imagined scenes.
- Altered English script makes the plot a little more understandable.

CONS
- English script slightly altered from original. There are many ""special"" lines that were altered for no apparent reason. And some of the humor is gone, like the ""toothpicks"" censor when Shinji is naked in Misato's apartment.
- Scenes have been cut or rearranged.
- Pacing is altered.

CONCLUSION
I see 1.11 as a ""supplement"" to the original series. The two combined really complete the vision of Evangelion. But if you watch 1.11 first, you're really missing out on some stuff. Likewise, 1.11 includes lots of great scenes not included in the original. So watch the original first, then watch this.",1304985600,,1106,4.872340425531915

3099197,5,B0012V4WSW,"Many fans of the original series might feel conflicted about what to think of an Evangelion reboot. I had my own trepidations, too, since I loved the Neon Genesis series so much for what it was: a cerebral twist of the mech genre. Rest assured, the reboot delivers a deliciously visual new breath of life into an old story. Fans and new viewers, alike, will enjoy 1.11 and the volumes to follow. The characters, beloved and hated, appear with more personality and understanding.  The reboot is much more direct in that aspect; in the original, it was hard to sympathize with some of the characters because their personalities (or lack thereof) develop over the length of the series, and some of them never have a chance to redeem themselves or resolve their problems. A little of that issue was taken care of in the final movie, which was good, but felt like a footnote on the end of a 26 episode series--a series which sorely needed a resolution to wrap up the story and give the viewer a feeling of closure.

The new Evangelion is going to be much more straightforward. It explains things as they're happening rather than recounting the whats and whys in later episodes, while still leaving some mystery as to the purpose of some characters and their motives. It's definitely a series to buy because it's worth owning and re-watching. It is not a re-hash of the old series; it is Evangelion re-imagined--Eva in another dimension. Not to mention, the animation is fantastic.",1304467200,,1475,4.735408560311284

 This re-imaging manages to do both, while retaning the basic plot certain elements have been changed which make the characters more human and less doom leaden, several sub plots have been ether changed or omited, again it would seem to appeal to both fans, old and new, and a more general audience.

It introduces us to some crucial characters and sets up the main premise of angels battling Evas in an already decimated world. (Do the angels only attack Japan though? ;) ) The movie has some good action and great animation.  Most importantly it left me wanting to see the next installment in the series. As a stand alone movie, Evangelion 1.11 isn't a new favorite, but I have high hopes for the series as a whole and can't wait for Evangelion 2.22 to be delivered!",1302048000,,723,4.519083969465649
3099210,5,B0012V4WSW,"The original Neon Genesis Evangelion series was one of the first anime I ever watched, and it blew my mind! There isn't one dull moment throughout the entire series. The animation is amazing, the action is awesome, the characters are incredibly life-like, and the whole story is pervaded with mystery. Each episode left me wanting more.

Evangelion 1.11 You Are (Not) Alone is a retelling of the first six episodes of the original series, and everything has been improved on. The animation interwoven with CGI is spectacular. The action seems to move with a slightly quicker pace than in the original. The characters from the original are all so great that it's hard to imagine they could be improved, yet this film has succeeded in doing so to some extent. There were a few instances in the original series where characters did or said things that seemed to me to be slightly out of place or character, and it seems the creator of Evangelion, Hideaki Anno, shared this sentiment. In all these instances subtle changes have been made to harmonize the behavior of the characters. Though Evangelion 1.11 doesn't diverge that much from the original series, there are a few new mysterious and very crucial plot twists that promise to turn the world of the original series upside down and inside out in the following films.

All in all, Evangelion 1.11 You Are (Not) Alone is among the best anime ever produced. It's definitely worth checking out.",1302048000,,1442,4.834008097165992
3099211,5,B0012V4WSW,"Neon Genesis Evangelion made its first television appearance in Japan in 1995, and with it followed an abundance of critical acclaim and various films that catapulted it into the pantheons of Japanese animation. The release of Evangelion 1.0 (1.11) only solidified just how important Evangelion is, by redefining and re-visualizing some of the most important scenes between episodes 1 through 6 of the original series, this film knocks it out of the ball park.

Not much can be said about the plot if one has seen the original series, as it is pretty much a copy and paste job; take a couple of angel fights and character dialogue. For those that have not experienced the series before in their life, basically a 14 year old boy by the name of Shinji Ikari is called upon to pilot one of the biological mecha known as Evangelion (Eva) in order to take down the mysterious destructive lifeforms known as Angels. Throughout the film, Shinji searches deep within for the meaning behind his actions and his existence, often breaking down and exploring the psychology of his mind in attempts to unravel what is true to him. Along with a complex set of supporting characters, the film never leaves the audience disinterested.

The film looks absolutely stunning, especially in 1080p; which is one of the main reasons why an Evangelion fan should purchase the blu-ray edition of the film. Every scene in the film has been re-worked from the ground up to give Evangelion the look it was always meant to have.

When it comes to the audio, once again the film excels in respect to any of the older material. Support for Dolby TrueHD 6.1 for both the English and Japanese dub means that everyone will be happy. In terms of dialogue (English dub), the film certainly has less dialogue than the original first six episodes, but that is to be expected with an hour and forty minutes to cover the said episodes. What one gets is a re-dubbing of the original dialogue that makes the character dialogue seem much more natural and clear than in the original dub. The soundtrack remains the same Shirou Sagisu composed tracks that defined most if not all of the prominent scenes in the original series, either enhanced or re-done to sound better than ever.

In conclusion, Evangelion 1.11 is a must buy for any Evangelion fan and newcomer alike. It is a prominent piece of art that continues to define what Anime can be expected to accomplish.",1301961600,,2424,4.750593824228028

After watching You Are (Not) Alone, I cannot say the same thing.  It WAS a little boring to watch the fights between Sachiel and Shamshel -- other than the huge minigun that Shinji used against the latter and the way the progressive knife was deployed, little had changed.  The battle with Ramiel, however, was mind-blowing.  I had to watch Operation Yashima several times to catch all the nuances of Ramiel's new features.  In summation, the story up to Ramiel is pretty much the same, but there are differences in animation techniques, content, and even character behavior (just look at how Shinji acted in the original, and the little changes he's gone through in the Rebuild).

3099215,3,B0012V4WSW,"I am not such a faithful fan of Evangelion, so excuse me if some of the words of my review offend anyone. I can't also consider myself an otaku because I only count with a year of my teens of anime exposure, and Evangelion was something I knew I needed to see but couldn't, until three years ago during a time of changes and depression, when I found it therapeutic (I know, I'm weird). So, anyway, I only had the chance to get to half the total of episodes, but I thought it had great characters, and strong material to be used for a good movie. People told me about the mess with the alternative end and stuff and I thought maybe it was too much, so when word came to me about a rebuild of the series in the form of a movie, I knew I had to watch it.

As I said before, perhaps I'm not the best qualified for a review of this product, but I must say that my expectations for this movie, in fact for the DVD as a whole, were higher.
Yes, it has a nifty package, but I still can't explain the existence of the second disc. Being as recognized as Evangelion is, I hoped to get more info about this release, interviews with creators (perhaps I'm asking much), or the choice of leaving and cutting things from the original episodes.
Instead what we get on Disc 2 are trailers, and trailers, and a ""music video"" that is really a trailer that could have been fan-made.
As for the movie itself, it looks great, but it bothers me that not even here Evangelion could be treated as a cinematic experience. Maybe it's because it is the same director as in the series, but I found myself trying to escape from the reality that it was a rushed summary of the first episodes, with some enhancements. Only in the climax and final fight could I be aloud to feel some atmosphere. I was hoping this movie could make Evangelion something deeper than it was in visually and emotional terms, but somehow... I didn't felt the story as with the episodes. Too much character development was took out, too much frame-by-frame of the episodes remains, and I couldn't see where was the existence of this rebuild justified.
Anyway, it's Evangelion amigos, and if you have more patience for movies than for series (like me), probably this is for you. As for me, I'm planning on giving Evangelion 2.22 a chance to convince me. This 2-disc edition comes with a booklet where it briefly explains the characters and the reason the movie exists. Disc 2 is nonsense. The movie sounds great and looks great. I hope all this project evolves as something great too.",1299456000,4,2527,4.39957264957265

I scratched up the black covering of mind so I'm a little upset about that, but with a booklet, its a great set, though the extras leave much to be desired. The music for the credits is Beautiful World by Utada is gorgeous and fitting for the mood.

There is NO ASUKA in this first one. It covers roughly up to Rei and Shinji's first battle together; their first time really bonding.

For diehard fans, it felt a bit abrupt when they changed from scene to scene because things in the anime (had to be) were cut to fit a movie experience. Still they hit the important parts.

3099218,4,B0012V4WSW,"Neon Genesis Evangelion is needless to say one of the most controversial anime franchises of ALL TIME as well as one of the most amazing animes of all time. The original series came out in 1995 which composed of 26 episodes which combined great elements of any anime series with a nice blend of action and comedy; however, the series is overall depressing and moody. Those original 26 episodes were classic needless to say however, episodes 25 and 26 were one of the most confusing and complex endings of any anime series. What the Evangelion series is famous for is the connection with religion and human emotions, it is one of the most depressing anime series because it goes deep into the mental state of human emotions and purpose and life. Life and Death is the overall content of the series. The last 2 episodes was confusing and basically one big mind f***. 2 years later the director Hideaki Anno decided to redue the ending and make a whole theatrical movie entitled The End of Evangleion and that ending was much much better, and the overall result was aclaimed and critically accecpted by all viewers. Over a decade later Hideaki Anno decides to revamp the ENTIRE series into a 4-Part movie and create a whole new plot and ending to the series.

This movie is a retelling of the first original 6 episodes of the original series. Alhought the whole Rebuild of Evangelion is a retelling of the original series, this first movie is basically the same exact story from the original series but with new animation and condensed into a 2 hour movie. The overall result is fantastic, the new animation is silky smooth combined with new CGI animations and colorful textures to make the film more modern and tolerable comapared to the 90's adaption. The story in this movie remains the same, a new Eva pilot Shinji Ikari is called upon by his father to pilot the Evangelion and kill off the upcoming angels. Nothings new here except for the new animated sequences. The music is very familiar from the original series and the dialogue has remained basically the same as well. Although the general material has been altered, its just nice to see a more modern Evangelion and really gets you hyped up for the next movies coming in the near future.

This DVD Evangleion 1.11 contains the same material from the original release 1.01 except for an additional second included with a couple of extras. The movie also contains an additional scenes added to the movie, nothing crucially important but it is a nice feature. The second disc contains a the original 1.01 feature film release (minus the added scenes) as well as couple of previews for the next film. The DVD also contains a 20 page booklet with notes and other great stuff on it. The movie is great, but the only reason why I give the film 4 stars is because of the English dub. I was a fan of the original series, and I found the english dub in the original series to be well done and can't imagine any other voice actors to do those characters. However, in the Rebuild series only two voice actors reprise their roles from the original series which are Spike Spencer (Shinkji Ikari) and Allison Keith (Misato Katsuragi). I am very glad at LEAST these two came back but I am a little dissapointed the original english voice actors from the NERV members didn't come back especially the voice for Gendo and Ritsuko. Hopefully the voice for Asuka will come back for the next film, and if she doesn't then I am watching the next film in japanese. This disc is a must buy for me. Great Movie but the special features fall short. I cannot wait till the next movie comes out.",1298332800,2,3624,4.608359133126935
3099219,5,B0012V4WSW,"A lot of people think that this is regular old Evangelion all over again. No, no. This is the foundation for something new and godly. If you watched this and have already seen Eva, you will notice the differences.

(Spoiler!) As we notice, many scenes have been altered, and it even shows that Kaoru, the fifth child, comes from the moon to face Shinji? Hm- and being as he was in contact with Seele, we can tell that this story is going an alternate route. Also! In the preview for 2.22 we see Minami, a character who's never been in Eva before this. So, there's that to consider.
(Spoiler ends!)

Ahem, with that out of the way, we can now move on to the actual product! A lovely and shining slip cover that dons a fold out box- both being covered in amazing artwork. Within that we have 2 DVDs and a booklet. The book is filled with random factoids and whatnot, nothing spectacular. The main DVD is the movie, of course, and the second is all special features. The special features are rather... lackluster? Though, it's nice to just add in stuff for no real extra price.

The main thing to concern yourself with is 1.01. Do not buy that. For about the same price you can have the newer, better looking, and more jam-packed version with a slightly uglier box. Hah. (I prefer the art on the 1.01 box. No matter as I have both.)

The movie is great, same old storytelling as always. A good bit of re-cap if you have already seen Eva, with the added twist of some new story. Eva feels brand new when watching 1.11, to me. Fresh visuals, amazing story and whatnot, action, drama- regardless of how many times I see Eva, it still remains timeless. There are many scenes which have gone complete overhauls where new graphic were added, 3D rendering is utilized and even fresh vocals and amazing sound to boot!

So, to sum it all up; this version looks great (Better than 1.01), sounds amazing, has some extras, is a slightly altered re-telling of some of the Eva story which is in part of a seemingly new plot, and dons a shiny box.",1298246400,2,2029,4.4144385026737964
3099220,3,B0012V4WSW,"So I bought this for my brother who's in his late 20's and loves Anime. Apparently Evangelion is a really big deal as far as Anime goes. We even visited a small Museum in Japan that was entirely dedicated to the show. He had already seen the movie but wanted it on blue ray anyways. I'm personally not into anime that much but felt the movie was about decent. I did however get tired of the main character very quickly. He's suppose to be the hero of the story but wines and cries like a little girl way too much.

The presentation of the blu-ray is great, a digipak package, it comes also with a good booklet that is indeed worth reading.

The movie is presented here in one of the best transfers i've ever seen for an animation, everything is amazing and full of detail, color balance is also very good, i'd ive 5/5 for this amazing image.

The problem with the edition is really the extras, there's almost nothing for the fans, just a 15 minute slideshow with production evolution of the movie with music, the rest is just trailers and a music video, very disappointing, sometives i feel that the producers held back the extras for another relaese, which is a thing many do and that have been done with Evangelion in the past. Well if they do this after the fourth movie, then i'm ok since will be watching this blu-ray many times.

This is truly an anime that can take advantage of bluray quality as well.  While this movie encapsulates the original episodes 1-6, you'll see small divergences that really make me wonder whether this is a remake or some kind of sequel.  I'll leave that discussion to otaku forums though.  In short, if you were a fan of the original series, you owe it to yourself to see this.  If you were turned off from evangelion before because of all the Shinji head case stuff...it's still there!  However, I feel it works a lot better in this format and overall comes out a lot more balanced and enjoyable!  Casual anime fans should not miss this movie.  Once you see it, you'll be chomping at the bit for the next ones to come out!

Once again I bought this based on reviewers elsewhere mentioning the similarity to Appleseed, and honestly there is no comparison.  The storyline is boring, really boring, and it was quite a tough watch!  It's like watching a video game of the same repeated mission against 6 or 7 progressively tougher bosses.  The same scene occurs over and over again, with the evildoers mech being just too tough for the latest incarnation of the goody-two-shoes mech, and gets beaten again, and again.

Animation is not great and the CGI is ok, but Ex Machina it is NOT!",1294444800,3,642,4.646017699115045
3099228,5,B0012V4WSW,"I recently bought this when I saw that it had a lower price; I'm a fan of the series but I've never really watched it all the way through...I mainly jumped around and watched it where I could. But I understand the main plot and have seen most of it to understand the series as a whole.

This movie is a wonderful addition to any Evangelion fan. The visuals are absolutely stunning with full 1080p support, the run time is approximately 100 minutes and it is definitely worth watching. The story itself follows the original episodes but adds in several scenes that help the story move along better. Like when the first episode in the original TV releases would end and in the next episode Shinji would awake in a hospital room instead the movie continues and shows the fight between EVA 01 and the 4th Angel. The movie covers episodes 1-6 in the TV series. There's some jumping around between the hospital scene and when Shinji goes to school but from what I've watched it simply stream lines the story and keeps it moving forward towards the action. I personally liked the differences between the original and the movie. It helped to better clarify parts such as when you see Lilith the 2nd Angel which is the origin of the human race and this explains why Tokyo 3 is under attack from the Angels to begin with. Also there's scenes that elude to the hidden agenda of Shinji's father and what his plans for Rei and Shinji are, this is also reflected and emphasized in several scenes.

Those are the main differences I saw from my first watch through of the movie itself. And overall I was absolutely blown away by the amazing artwork and quality of the movie itself. If anyone is interested in this product whether a long time fan of the series or someone new to the Evangelion universe I would definitely recommend a buy. And for the price it is this Blu ray DVD is completely worth...let's just say I can wait for Evangelion 2.22.",1294444800,,1931,4.514285714285714
3099229,5,B0012V4WSW,"Let me first put it out there that, of course, I'm a big fan of the original Evangelion series, like millions are. The faithful day I saw a small, Japanese trailer for this was around late 2007. I got extremely excited about it, but totally forget about it because it tended to stay of the U.S. radar for anime. Not only that, but either FUNimation sat on it for so long or had some form of an issue, it took forever to get licensed and dubbed.

I see for some odd reason people seem to think this title was unnecessary, and probably a way to just let some companies make money off of Evangelion's name. I wonder to myself why people seem to think Evangelion 1.11 is gonna just be a stand-alone movie, and have no sequel come off it, and ultimately, not get any further than the original. This is indeed a 4-film tetralogy. The point of this whole project is for it come to fruition like Hideaki Anno first wanted it to, and now he has the chance to make it happen.

I'm just gonna make this a short winded, simple review, now. I got Evangelion 1.01 over Christmas of '09 and I couldn't wait to watch it. I popped it in around mid-January, and I was blown away. Beautiful, crisp animation. While I'm not a fan of CG, they did incorporate it well. Stuck mostly to it's OST, which is grand, because it's wonderful. I gotta say, though, there is NO WAY FUNimation didn't know anything about the darkness issue before releasing it. Were they just trying to make money by re-releasing it as this title? I don't know. Anywho, if you're a loyal fan and you were upset about the direction this movie took, what did you expect? Why stray away from the very roots that made this series what it was AND is? And while I'll agree that the changes in this film were few, they were major. So, if you're expecting to dive head first into this movie expecting every single detail to be different, you'll be dissapointed. All I can say is: this was my movie experience of 2010, and honestly, the best movie I've seen in a long time. While I'm glad the changes in here were minor, we'll see what the 2nd film has in store plot-wise. I recommend this to any Evangelion fan or anime fan in general.

Not-so-brief Review: if you're not an Evangelion fan, but a fan of anime in general, this movie will rock your socks off. If you're an Evangelion fan, this has probably been a wet dream at some point in your life. A completely redrawn and reimagined version of the series you already know and love, with enough twists and turns to make it a wholly new and yet familiar experience. The real changes come in Evangelion 2.22, but it seems you'll have to wait a bit for that one.

The Blu-Ray comes with 1080p FullHD image, a 6.1 TruHD and 6.1 Dolby Digital Japanese track and an English track which I haven't tried so I can't really say anything. Sound is superb, animation is one of the best out there and story is... well... Evangelion, so you can expect it to be AWESOME. Package is gorgeous, with an outer cover featuring an original EVA-01 image, and the inner cover is glossy black with an image of Rei on one side and an image of Shinji on the other. It also features a booklet with a sort-of-artbook with a couple of images, but that's just a small bonus.

If you're a fan of the series, this is a dream come true. If you're not, then it's a really good place to start. Evangelion hasn't stayed a cult series for so long because of nothing, trust me.",1287446400,,1306,4.3884297520661155

3099239,5,B0012V4WSW,"I'm a long-time fan of Evangelion; I own both the original DVD run and the Platinum DVDs, and it's one of my favorite anime series of all time.  When the new movies began production, I was completely psyched, and let me tell you,they do not disappoint.  This first movie is a fairly faithful re-telling of the first 7 episodes of the series (everything before Asuka shows up).  There are a few changes in the events, the characters have all undergone subtle personality changes (Shinji isn't as whiny!  Rei isn't as dull!), and a lot of things have undergone design changes.  There is a lot of animation recycled from the series, but it's been gone over and improved, and now looks smooth and gorgeous, especially on blu-ray. They use a lot of CG now, which I am still on the fence about.. I'm a little bit of a 2D purist, but having done some animation, I understand the efficiency of the CG.  Other than polishing it up tremendously, this movie doesn't add much to the experience of the series, but it does set up for the second movie, which is a *huge* departure from the series... I can't wait for *that* on blu-ray!

As for the blu-ray itself, the picture is phenomenal, of course, as well as the sound.  I don't crank up the sound on many of my movies, but in this case I was blasting it. I was also impressed with the special features included. From what I've researched, they included all of the special features that were included in the Japanese DVD release.  The disc also comes with a small program booklet with character and setting information, like the kind they give out at Japanese movie premieres.  I thought that was very cool, because the only other way to get those programs is to try and nab one on an auction site, and then they're expensive and un-translated. The translation of the movie itself is also very good, although I can't speak for the dub as I've only viewed it in Japanese with English subtitles.  Funimation isn't always known for its stellar translations (they actually list their translations as ""reversioning"" in the majority of their releases), but this one is, thankfully, up-to-par with the ADV and Manga Evangelion releases.

These new Evangelion movies were meant to be a way to introduce the series to a new generation of viewers, and they can stand very well on their own, especially with this first movie as a foundation.  But they are also extremely enjoyable for us die-hard fans of the series, adding a new dimension and yet another interpretation of the events leading up to the Third Impact.",1284336000,,2544,4.651785714285714

But I was pleasantly surprised when my boyfriend asked me to order this for him so we could watch it together. I realized quickly that Evangelion wasn't just about a giant robot (and actually, I don't think the Evangelion suits are robots...), it was a personal story about this boy who is put into an extraordinary situation and expected to ""man up"" and be a hero, when he feels like everything but a hero. This re-version of Evangelion is beautifully atmospheric and has texture to it. I can't wait to see the other parts to this series.

3099243,1,B0012V4WSW,"This review is from someone who knows nothing about the series and has never seen it.

Yes, the movie is visually stunning and that's where it stops.

I enjoy anime and every now and then purchase something new I have never heard of, in hopes to find a great new series.  Well this isn't it.  This movie is purely for people that are long time fans and have watched the entire series.

First off, I thought it was a stand alone movie.  Apparently I was wrong and this is merely an introduction.  An introduction filled with NO back history, annoying characters and plot holes.  There are these things called Angles and they are attacking the Earth.  You don't know why they are attacking, what they are exactly, where they came from or anything!  Then the ""hero"" of the series is a whiny 14yr old boy who pilots a giant ""cyborg"" type robot.  Do we know anything about the boy?  Why he was selected to pilot, how he had the ability to pilot without ever training or ANYTHING besides the fact that he cries the entire movie.....NOPE.  Plus there is no need for the nudity.  Its not that it ""bothers"" me, it just seems completely irrelevant and out of place.  Not to mention it usually occurs between a brother and sister, that are 14yrs old.  Does anyone else get the feeling that this is the culmination of some perverts fantasy?  14yr old incest....yeah I think I'll pass.

After watching this and now knowing its an introduction, I still have no interest in watching the series.  I'm just going to go over to Wikipedia and read up on it to fill in all the plot gaps.

However, if you find a 14yr old whiny character, who want to bone his sister, cry about piloting a giant robot and suffers from neglect and daddy issues then this is YOUR movie.",1280620800,10,1746,4.44794952681388

While the animation is much better, and the new CG fits in perfectly, you're not going to find much here that's new as far as the plot goes. The little bit it does add, though, is a great set up for the next three movies, which are completely different from the rest of the series.

I've found that this serves as a good introduction to the series, and in fact you could almost watch this, ignore the very very last part (as it's basically MASSIVE spoilers for the original series), and then continue the series from episode 7. However, by doing this you would miss out on a lot of the more subtle parts of the first six episodes that couldn't be fit into a movie, as well as a lot of character development. To each his own, though.

I would definitely recommend watching the original series first before watching the movie; this merely serves as the set-up to something greater with the next three movies.",1278460800,2,985,4.4972067039106145

I don't even own a single soundtrack compilation. But, I will say that I am an artist, and an animation student at the moment, and that I have basically purchased the entire series twice before (starting on my third time with 1.11, huh?). I have both the ""Perfect Collection"" DVD boxset, and the ""Platinum Collection"", as well as for ""Death of Evangelion."" During the years that I've owned these, I have watched the series from start to finish at least 20 times (I was going to say 200, but that wouldn't be too realistic!) and have basically taken in as much as I could possibly have taken in from it.

With all of that said, I feel that 1.11 is nothing short of Amazing! The improvements made to the art and animation are many and noticeable (Not like a certain other anime I know that's getting similar treatment. I'm looking at you, DBZ!) and I don't believe you need the eye of an artist to notice.

For those who have never watched the anime series (I've personally never finished it, only seen the first few episodes), this is a great way to be introduced to one of the most interesting plots in science fiction. Though if you have watched this anime series, you'd notice several interesting...easter eggs throughout this ""remake"".

3099260,3,B0012V4WSW,"Evangelion 1.11 is without a doubt the best looking anime yet released on blu-ray.  In the box is one 50gb blu-ray disc with the main feature (with dual audio tracks for English and Japanese of course), and several special features.  Included is a booklet detailing the impetus behind the ""rebuild"" project, which also details a few scene by scene comparisons (original to rebuild) and character profiles.  The main feature is, for me, the main attraction, and funimation doesn't disappoint.  Eva looks great.  In fact it's never looked better, the team behind rebuild (no longer Gainax for those who want to know), have gone back to the drawing board, literally, to recreate the show in a 16:9 theatrical format.  Original key animation was used as a jumping off point for the entire project, which means that while there are many shots that look identical to the original series, there is not in fact any reused material.  The end result is a pristine picture that is free from the blemishes that plagued the older Evangelion dvds you may have seen. In short, this is the best looking Evangelion available.

The story itself though, that's a different matter.  To those people who haven't watched Evangelion, and just plain don't get what all the fuss is about; welcome!  Evangelion 1.11 you are (not) alone is a wonderful place for you to start.  To diehard fans of the series I say this; this is not the Evangelion you remember.  While all the major events in the first 6 episodes are presented here in the first entry of rebuild, the pace is decidedly faster than the original series.  This is probably rebuild's biggest asset and greatest liability at the same time.  New fans will probably appreciate the snappy pace of the series, but if you're like me you might find the pace somewhat jarring.  The original series was very ... deliberate in its pacing.  While I appreciate the fact that Shinji's decision to pilot the Eva came so quickly this go 'round, I miss the flashback sequence detailing his first confrontation with an angel.  Originally the viewer is kept in the dark about what happened, in the middle of the first battle Shinji awakens in a hospital in the episode titled ""unfamiliar ceiling"".  A good deal of time goes by before it's revealed exactly what happened with unit 01 and the fourth angel, and the audience reacts with the same shock that Shinji experiences when he begins to remember the outcome of the battle.  That moment of revelation is both more powerful and more subtle because it's more removed, in terms of time, from the event.  This is the sort of thing that happens throughout the entire disc.  Like I said earlier, all the big moments are there, but to me they seem rushed.  A lot of the subtlety of the series seems to be getting swept under the rug for the sake of brevity.  I still like rebuild 1.11, but I don't yet love it.  It's going to be difficult for the rebuild to dislodge my love of the original series, warts and all.",1272499200,52,2975,4.687861271676301
3099261,5,B0012V4WSW,"In this time we are living in, remakes are coming in theaters literally every 5 seconds. Texas Chainsaw massacre,the karate kid, batman, and so on. But what makes this movie different from other crappy movie remakes? Why remake Neon Genesis Evangelion when it's already perfect the way it is (ignore eps. 25-26). To be honest, I can't give a good reason why I love this remake movie of the franchise but I can easily say that it is DAMN IMPRESSIVE! Probably the best 30 bucks I spent on a blue ray disk. ALMOST everything is PERFECT about this new version of Eva. The art is perfect, that voice acting is perfect, the plot, even the music kicks ass. Basically this and the other 3 movies coming out is a remake of the whole tv series (and supposedly a remake ending of The End of Evangelion film as well) but without all the plot fillers in it. I highly recomend it to anyone but I Will have to warn you to watch the original tv series before watching this movie. And for good reasons

SPOILER ALERTS!!!!!!!!!!!!

1. Many symbols are changed in nerv. Instead of a leaf it's an apple. Probably a symbol for ""adam's"" apple. And you don't see Nerv's higher command face to face like in the show at the begining. They start off with the weird obilisks things.

2. Misato is very aware of lilith's location at Nerv HQ. She even shows it to Shinji.

3. Kawrou makes an appearance at the end, and I'm guessing there is a space station on the moon with supposedly another Lillith creature.

4. At the ending credits, Mari the newest Evangelion character ever made is briefly shown. Making her first appearance in Eva 2.0 movie.

I love this movie. I can talk about this thing for hours on end. If you love Eva, THEN BUY IT! NO REGRETS!!!!!!!",1272240000,,1733,4.451104100946372
3099262,5,B0012V4WSW,"When I was younger I had just begun to explore anime, and I remember a friend of mine telling me, ""Whatever else you may watch, you MUST see Neon Genesis Evangelion"". And he was right, it really was (and is) a must-see series. as many other reviewers have stated, it explores large scale concepts that you usually don't see too much in any kind of series, anime or not. In the original 26-part series, I was captivated by the basic story and exciting visuals/music, but more than that the ideas really hooked me and stuck with me. With the framework of giant robot battles, there is a wealth of symbolism and especially parallelism - between Shinji and Rei, between the Evas and Angels, between NERV and the city, you name it. Death and rebirth, even the purpose of life and death, are issues central to the story. The plot ostensibly is about giant killing machines, called Angels, that attack Japan, and about a boy named Shinji who arrives to pilot one of the counterweapons, EVAs, created by his father. However Shinji's journey is much more complicated then it first appears and what he expects it to be; he remains an angst-driven, reluctant and petulant hero but learns a great deal about the nature of humanity along the way.

I'm glad to report that the Rebuild of Evangelion retains much of the power, structure and philosophical impact of the original series while souping it up visually and aurally like never before. This updated version of the first of four films, title ""You Are (Not) Alone"", is absolutely fantastic and rectifies some of the previous lighting issues in the first release. The image quality and clarity is absolutely stunning, definitely a reference-level movie. The 4th Angel attack alone is mind-blowing, with it morphing into all sorts of digital wonderments with a glassy, reflective look - all the while blowing stuff up like crazy. Shinji's training sequence and all of the Eva arming/dispatch sequences along with the attacks really shine in the rebuild. And the quality of the lighting is amazing in scene after scene, whether it be liquid blood drops splattering everywhere or an almost angelic, soft palette as Shinji and Rei try to connect. All the digital effects look almost photorealistic in 1080p, and the blending with the traditional art look and style is seamless. In terms of story there is pretty much every key moment re-conceptualized in some form so if you aren't familiar with the series then you really aren't missing too much information. While I do advise finding the original first, this release is strongly recommended and I for one cannot wait for the rest to come over stateside. If only they had retained the original theme song or referenced it somewhere!",1271980800,,2720,4.862068965517241
3099263,5,B0012V4WSW,"There are already a couple of lengthy reviews so I'll keep this brief.

If you are new to Evangelion:

I suggest watching the original series first (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Neon-Genesis-Evangelion-Platinum-Perfect-Collection/dp/B000VLL0O8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Neon Genesis Evangelion Platinum: Perfect Collection</a>), substituting ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Neon-Genesis-Evangelion-The-End-Of-Evangelion/dp/B000068OJ1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Neon Genesis Evangelion - The End Of Evangelion</a>"" for the final two episodes. Evangelion 1.11 is essentially taking the first 6 episodes of NGE (150+ minutes of storytelling) and fitting it into slightly over an hour and a half. To the new viewer, the story in Evangelion 1.11 may seem rushed. To me it seems to focus more on how bad-ass it is when giant, bio-engineered cyborg/beings fight against giant, celestial beings whilst smashing to pieces the surrounding cityscape ... because it is really, really cool.

If you are already an Evangelion fan:

Why haven't you already bought this!? Even though this focuses more on action, there are several spots (plot-wise) where I like what is done in Evangelion 1:11 more than the series. There are even a couple of 'a-ha!' moments as well. The story is pretty faithful to the first 6 episodes of the series with the exception of the end (no spoilers!) when we are left believing the story will start varying more from the original. For the English dub, the voices of Misato and Shinji seem exactly the same; Rei sounds the same except not quite as 'whispery' and sad; Ritsuko is slightly different but familiar; Gendo is completely different. Gendo's ""new voice"" is a lot less cold. I almost feel like it makes his character a little more complex because he doesn't come across as such a complete ass*. That being said... I kinda miss the ""old voice"". Kensuke and Toji sound different as well. As far as visual presentation goes, Evangelion 1.11 is an ocular orgasm. I had this cheesy otaku grin on my face the whole way through - you know the one I'm talking about! Maybe some slight drooling as well. Eh, let's face it; the drooling started as soon as I picked this up at the store. My girlfriend can attest to this since she had to drive home from the mall so I could flip through the included booklet. Speaking of the booklet, special features are plentiful, though not completely amazing. The packaging is pretty damn cool, however... Oooo, shiny!

For those who are new to this series, its best if you start off with the t.v. series because you will be lost trying to understand this one.  This is meant for the fans that know whats going on with the whole angels, eve, son of adam and so fourth.  A lot of the scenes were cut in order to squeeze in the important parts of the show.  For example, they focused on the main characters and their personalities rather than his classmates or co-workers at nerv who all have a little backround of their own, but you won't see that in 1.11.  Other than that lets get to the good stuff.  This movie puts 4 or 5 episodes into one so far.  The whole thing is redrawn with extended and new scenes added and extra features for the angels as well as the eva's.  The eva's now have a new disturbing roar when going berserk, and the angels have halos over them now (just some cool little features if you observe closely).  1.11 is the way to go, the difference with 1.0 is like night and day.  1.0 is poorly converted to dvd quality, the scene when shinji first pilot his eva is so dark all you can see is the green glowing from the eva and thats the first fight scene.  1.11 fixed that right up, its crisp and clear in the blu ray, I haven't seen the dvd version of 1.11 but im sure its the same.  Fans of Evangelion need to pick this one up wether for you collection or to refresh your memory either way you won't be disappointed.  Just remember this is a movie series.

3099270,5,B0012V4WSW,"The movie: 4.5/5
Basically this is the first in a series of theatrical adaptations of the original Evangelion anime TV series. Some of the filler content of the TV series was trimmed off and the pacing was adapted to a theatrical release. For newcomers as well as Evangelion fans, this is a must-watch anime: newcomers won't have any trouble following the story due to the strong rewriting and newcomers will find the pacing fresh and not too slow but also not too fast.

Video quality: 5/5
Simply put, I was unable to discern any flaw in this beautiful transfer. Even banding, the enemy of every animated feature, is absent. Colors are spot-on, detail is clear and crisp, and the animation of the original series was completely reworked for this theatrical release. The Blu-ray is a faithful reproduction of what was shown in theaters.

Audio quality: 5/5
Simply stunning. This disc sports a powerful Japanese TrueHD 5.1 track that envelops you into a realistic listening area. Sound effects are clear and precise and dialog is well-balanced and clearly audible.
Moreover, it's a very, VERY welcome change to for once be able to listen to the original language track in high quality on a US released anime feature. Funimation, take note!

Extras: 2/5
Not a whole lot of extras but what is on the discs discusses how the team brought the original animation of the Evangelion TV series anime to the big screen and it shows clearly that a lot of love and work went into making this feature.

Overall: 4.5/5
Anime fans, fans of Evangelion and purists like me who like quality audio on the original language should add this to their basket post haste. The production values are astonishing for an anime feature and I was unable to detect any technical faults on this disc's transfer. The story was nicely condensed, trimming out superfluous material to leave only the core story and it's moving along at a steady pace. This one ranks at the top of my anime Blu-ray list as far as US releases are concerned! Media companies like Funimation who churn out series after series with mediocre quality (most of the time) and little to no regard for the original language track should take a few lessons from Bandai Visual.

Some of the original voice cast is back (Shinji, Misato, word is out on Asuka since she's not in this one) and the replacements are all quite good, they just take a little getting used to (Kensuke and Gendo in particular).

Anyway, if you're a fan of Eva, buy this. Buy this now. Don't bother with rebuild 1.01, it's on disc 2 of 1.11. Enjoy the high definition defeat of the first three angels and ponder at the changes to Tokyo 3.",1270080000,3,610,4.398230088495575

Evangelion 1.11 is the final version of the first film in what looks to be 4 films covering the entirety of the original ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" anime.

It's a great film that will entertain anyone who has enjoyed anime in the past. You *don't* need to be a mecha fan to enjoy this stuff because it has a much broader storyline than that.. at least from what I can tell.

Thats the only flaw of this film.. lack of solid story. It's hard to say its a particularly bad point because theres no doubt we'll be filled in with ""Evangelion 2.22"", the preview for it at the end of the film indicates plenty of things will happen - whereas Evangelion 1.11 just gets you started, introduces the characters, the base concepts and situation of the story. It's extremely hard to tell how much plot there is behind it.. but I can say I'll be pre-ordering Evangelion 2.22 as soon as it becomes available because at the end of this film you're left wanting more. A lot more.

The animation is fantastic, flawless on this BluRay. Audio is also brilliant (I watched with the original Japanese audio) and subtitles are clear - much nicer than subtitles ever were on DVD.

I think my mouth was agape from start to finish.  I was excited when I heard about the Evangelion rebuild project and was pleased with what they managed to accomplish with 1.01 but after seeing 1.11, you will either a) immediately sell or b) never ever watch the 1.01 version again.

STUNNNING, absolutely STUNNING bluray visuals, sound and possibly even beter than those two points, the build and edit of 1.11 is far superior to that of 1.01 and as a result the viewer is compltely sucked in and enthralled throughout the entire motion picture experience and as exagerrated as some of this review may seem it is hard to fuly express how solid of a movie Evangelion 1.11 is without gushing... some. ;)

Regarded as one of the more notable franchises in anime, Neon Genesis Evangelion is something of an oddity. It's essentially a shounen (as in geared towards a young demographic, check Wikipedia for a more thorough definition) and mecha (giant robot) series, but at the same time possesses a plethora of other complexities: Freudian psychoanalysis, a heck of a lotta' melodrama, fan service (again, check Wiki if you're unfamiliar with the term), allusions to Christianity, bits of comedy, and a lot of convoluted plot twists. And with that said, it can be difficult to stomach for those who don't know the series or just aren't used to the over-exaggerated nature of anime in general. Evangelion 1.11 is basically part 1 of a quadrilogy that's a ""rebuild"" of the series that initially aired in 1995. It took the original story (in this case, condensing the first 6 episodes) and key animation, made a bunch of tweaks with cleanup and CG, and ultimately gave us this first chunk of the overall revision. From my own experience with the series (albeit 7 or 8 years ago), I actually enjoyed it quite a bit. Having spent such a long hiatus from this franchise and from anime in general the last couple of years it was a pleasant surprise for me to rediscover part of what made anime so enjoyable in the first place (being all those complexities I mentioned above), not to mention comparing the astounding amount of new art and animation quality to my old DVDs of the series. The only drawback I would say 1.11 has, though, is a lack of character development, which I believe will make it extremely difficult for newcomers to understand, at least until all 4 movies can be viewed consecutively. But aside from that, the pacing is much, much faster with a good majority of it being in the Eva battles, and beautifully animated to boot.

Video - 5.0

Presented by FUNimation using the MPEG-4 AVC codec at an original aspect of 1.85:1 (framed at 1.78), I'm glad to see FUNi finally jumped off their recent trend of upscaling all their anime and actually getting their hands on an HD master. Evangelion 1.11 looks absolutely stunning, not just in comparison to its serial counterpart, but as a standalone piece of animation. The cleanup effort they made on the original art and new integration of CG and cel animation meld together perfectly. Colors are rich and vibrant from the cityscape of Tokyo-3 and its green mountains to the inside of NERV headquarters and all the black murkiness that accompanies one of the underlying themes of the franchise. Line detail never looked sharper, giving a great amount of dimensionality to the characters, Evas, Angels, and backgrounds. Contrast is also never too bright, resulting in a very pleasing look to the overall picture. There may have been just a tiny bit of color banding on a few quick scenes, but I'm just too happy they got off their butts and actually made a real transfer with a real HD master in the first place. Fans of the series will be pleased.

Audio - 5.0

Also of great notoriety is the fact of FUNi adding a lossless Japanese track to their package, breaking the other recent trend of lossless dub / lossy JP presentations. The TrueHD 6.1 track sounds fantastic with lots of separation and immersion from the front, side, and rear speakers. I have a 7.1 setup, but was amazed at the clarity and directionality of the com announcements during the action sequences. You'd literally see the person on-screen talking, and then hear someone else in the back corner of your room, and then another person on the opposite side, and then hear several other voices simultaneously. Side surrounds get a good workout as well, even in the most subtle of moments like traveling down an elevator, hearing a railway train pass by, or the infamous sound of summer cicadas. LFE output is also very potent, though never too overwhelming, and compliments the action very nicely. The only thing that may detract viewers is the ""tinny-ness"" of the voice acting. When things get dead quiet, it tends to reveal that digital ringing or whatever that results from recorded voicing, but it's only a problem if the volume's too high (like I had mine...). Dialogue and music are also very well-channeled through their respective speakers and suffer no levels of dropout or distortion. This is reference material if you ever want to showcase anime.

Extras - 3.0

1.11 comes with a graphics progression bit, a bunch of theatrical trailers for the movie, and a bunch of other trailers for FUNi's upcoming releases. None of these are too great, aside from the Darker Than Black trailer, which I really hope will get just treatment for its eventual BD release. But what really got me was the little booklet that came with the movie. Not only does it textually fill in the gaps of the graphics progression feature, it also explains a lot of the general terminology used in the animation process and gives a little insight on how and why they did so. If anything, I'm just severely disappointed that there weren't any interviews with the creators and producers explaining the changes they made or their intentions with doing this rebuild in the first place. Perhaps they'll include them in spurts on future releases of the other movies?

Overall 4.5

As much acclaim as the Evangelion franchise has received or as much hype people have given it in the last 15 years, it's probably safe to say it still remains a title of much [whatever] you wanna' push on it. Fans who know and applaud all the subtleties and complexities of the series will enjoy this a great deal, if not for a second round of storytelling, then at least for the rebuild effort in the overall art and animation quality. FUNimation presents Evangelion 1.11 with an admirable effort (finally) giving consumers an actual HD experience in both video and audio quality. While the extras are a bit sparse, don't let that stop you from at least checking this out. If you're not really into anime or don't know the series too well, then you may want to just give it a rent until all 4 films are available to watch at the same time. Highly recommended for fans, though.",1268956800,,6161,4.7504672897196265
3099279,5,B0012V4WSW,"Originally, I had rented Evangelion 1.0 on Netflix, so when this new version came up for pre-order, I decided to jump upon it.  I'm happy to say that this new version is a vast improvement on the first version, as it added some new scenes that 1.0 omitted.

If there was any negative complaints about the film, it is that some of the humor that the early part of Neon Genesis Evangelion was omitted, and it jumped into the psychological drama early on.  I was relieved that a few of the humorous scenes of the original series was kept (Shinji's first night at Misato's apartment and his meeting with Pen Pen).

The action scenes were greatly improved, particularly the combat scenes with Ramiel (the 6th Angel).  This film is definitely a must-have!",1268784000,,749,4.643939393939394

3099282,5,B0012V4WSW,"Well after all this time, Evangelion 1.11 came out last Tuesday. I have been waiting for this movie ever since October when I first discovered it and then I found out that the November Evangelion 1.01 release was a bad dvd release with problems, so I had to wait until Evangelion 1.11 came out so I waited about 5 months for this movie. During that time however I watched the whole original Neon Genesis Evangelion series, all the way till the end of End of Evangelion. I will not give anything away at the end but the ending to the Original Series was not what I hoped for but I was glad that Anno made End of Evangelion instead of leaving it to the even worse ending that the original TV series left off at.

  Ok, now moving back to Evangelion 1.11 release. Well I was so excited about this release that I pre-ordered my blu-ray copy in January and I received it this Wednesday and just watched it today which is Saturday. After watching it I was glad. This movie met with my expectations and was a faithful remake and it was just as I expected. It did not exceed my expectations because I knew what was coming from the movie and I did not see how they would be able to make the first 6 episodes of Neon Genesis Evangelion any more interesting because this movie was meant to introduce the characters so I knew they would not change anything major from the start. So the story is about the same as the original TV series except that they cut out what was unnecessary to the main plot like all of Shinji's classmates knowing that he was an Eva pilot or when Shinji camped out with Kensuke when he was returning home after he was trying to run away. So the story is very faithful to the first 6 episodes

  The animation is wonderful and looks really clean and the CG is the best that I have ever seen in an animated movie, especially the Evas and Angels look a lot better than they did in the original anime series. I played this movie off my Playstation 3 and I was watching it through my 13 year old TV that only projects movies and games in 480i but it still looked really good and in the future when I get an HDTV, it will probably look way better. The dub is really great too but I cannot comment on the audio yet because I do not have a stereo system and that one of the speakers on my TV is dead so I had to put my TV volume high while listening to the movie in mono.

  The only thing that I have to complain about this blu-ray is the packaging. I am not saying the packaging looks bad however, I actually really liked how the packaging looks, it is just physical how the case was. The case is pure cardboard and I though it would have a blu-ray case like all of my other blu-rays but everything about the case is made out of cardboard so that is my only complaint.

  So it is a good movie for Neon Genesis Evangelion fans like myself, but for people who did not watch the original anime may think there was not enough action in it and that it was too short. Well just wait until the other 3 movies to come out because this movie is not like Final Fantasy 7 Advent of Children, because it is rebuilding a story that actually makes sense instead of pointless action sequences. So this is a must have for Neon Genesis Evangelion fans and people new to the series, just watch this movie and wait for the rest because this is just an introduction to an epic story, just like the first Lord of the Rings movie.",1268438400,,3416,4.198473282442748
3099283,5,B0012V4WSW,"This is the definitive Anime Blu-Ray. Series creator Anno Hideaki's attempt to retell his critically acclaimed Neon Genesis Evangelion has received the 1080p treatment it so certainly deserved. In so doing it has now set the bar for HD Anime. Sony's SBMV (Super Bit Mapping for Video) Technology allows for much smoother colour gradients as compared to its 1.01 counterpart. As such the animation comes across as being extremely polished. The anime features some of the best 2D-3D integration I've ever seen in anime. However the true star of this release is the 6.1ch Japanese and English audio tracks. Every screech, stomp, blast and cicada chirp is crystal clear and should satisfy even the most demanding audiophile. The packaging borrowed from the Japanese version in terms of form but with a completely different art style.

3099286,5,B0012V4WSW,"In 2006, Japanese fans and anime fans of ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" received exciting news that in the Summer of 2007, the first of four Evangelion films based on the anime television series would be released in theaters.  According to news reports, Evangelion creator Hideaki Anno watched the series from beginning to end and wanted to fix up a lot of questions and debates that fans had over the television series and most importantly, incorporate today's new CG technology for the film versions.  Even furthering the excitement is that the original crew and cast have signed on to work on the new film.

So, with mass promotion in Japan, ""Evangelion 1.01 - You Are (Not) Alone"" became the #1 film in Japan making over $14.6 million (US), surpassing ""The End of Evangelion"" which brought in $14.5 million (US).  A limited edition DVD was released in Japan in 2008 which came with a script, music videos and an ""Explanation of Evangelion"" feature and needless to say, fans paid dearly for this limited edition DVD release (only 300,000 were made).  A Blu-ray and DVD release titled ""Evangelion 1.11' which included a re-transfer of the film plus three additional minutes was released in May 2009 and is currently the best selling Blu-ray release in Japan and now the Blu-ray and DVD release of ""Evangelion 1.11 - You Are (Not) Alone"" has been released in the US.

With many Americans waiting for ""Evangelion 1.11' Blu-ray release, suffice to say, the film was released with a very short run at limited theaters and made over $100,000 and was screened at the anime convention Anime Expo in 2009 with great fanfare.

""Evangelion: 1.11 - You Are (Not) Alone"" is a film that takes the first six episodes of the TV series and features new animation and CG and a few different storyline details of certain characters but for the most part, creator Hideaki Anno made sure the film was faithful to the anime series.  The major difference between ""Evangelion 1.01' and ""Evangelion 1.11' is that the latter includes three minutes of extra footage (spread out during the first 15 minutes of the film) and scenes that were darker can now be seen much better.  Also, the Blu-ray edition boasts video and audio in HD and also comes with special features which 1.01 on DVD was barebones.

VIDEO:

""Evangelion 1.11 - You Are (Not) Alone"" is featured in 1080p High Definition.  I had the opportunity to compare the Blu-ray to the 1.01 DVD release from FUNimation Entertainment from last fall and I can tell you right now that this Blu-ray looks fantastic.  Detail is much more apparent and the vibrancy of the colors of the film literally pop onscreen.  The CG animation is top notch and overall, Gainax definitely went all out in creating a fantastic anime full of detail, vibrant colors and staying faithful to the anime series but making sure everything is updated and looks amazing.

The DVD looks good but the main difference was that 1.01 was taken from a 35mm film transfer while the Blu-ray release was taken from the original High Definition digital file.  Not to say that the two look like night and day but there is a significant difference in terms of how vibrant and sharper the animation looks on Blu-ray.  ""Evangelion 1.11 - You Are (Not) Alone"" looks absolutely beautiful!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

As for audio, I know how I was appreciative of the Dolby Digital 5.1 for  ""Evangelion 1.01 - You Are (Not) Alone"" but for ""Evangelion 1.11 - You Are (Not) Alone"", you get a Dolby TrueHD 6.1 English and Japanese lossless soundtrack and there are MAJOR differences between the lossless soundtrack and its DVD counterpart.  On lossless, there is good use of the various channels for this film.  From hearing the music and main character vocal coming from the center and front channels, you will then hear the loudspeakers through the surround channels and then the rear surround channels carry audio that is different.  For example, in one scene in which Shinji is asking out of his mecha, you hear the main characters and vocals through the center and front channels, loud speakers and musical instruments on the surround and on the rear surround channel, you hear Shinji screaming in agony behind you.

There is a huge difference between the lossless audio track and the Dolby Digital 5.1 track from the DVD.  Personally, the lossless audio is just phenomenal, how it is so immersive and envelops the soundscape from all directions was fantastic.  And I am so happy to find out that the Japanese audio track is lossless as well. Something that fans have wanted from anime on Blu-ray!

As for the dubbing, personally, I have never listened to the original ADV Films English dubs, so I can't comment on how the newer voice dubs are with the original but from what I hear from friends and have read, fans were more than grateful for the English voice dubbing for ""Evangelion 1.01'.  As for the Japanese voice acting, I've always felt the voice acting was solid.  Both tracks are similar for the most part in terms of audio featured on a certain channel but I did notice that the Japanese lossless track took advantage of the space.  For example, in the beginning you will see Shinji, his father and the scientist in a large open space.  In the Japanese lossless audio track, the sense of emptiness in that area and the echoing can be heard quite well on the lossless Japanese audio track.  But I also feel that the English dub was a slight more louder than its Japanese counterpart.  So overall, both lossless audio soundtracks are well-done.

As for subtitles, the subtitles on the Blu-ray are in English only.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Evangelion: 1.11 - You Are (Not) Alone"" contains the following special features:

  * Rebuild of Evangelion 1.01 - (15:14) This segment features two versions of the pre-rendered 3D compared to the final cut.  The two versions are the Shiro Sagisu Version and the Joseph-Maurice Ravel Version and both music are different from one another but the segment is the same.
  * Angel of Doom Promotion - (2:20) A music montage video from scenes taken from the film.
  * News Flasher - (:55) Text teasers for ""Evangelion 1.11 - You Are (Not) Alone).
  * Movie Previews - The movie previews contain the Preview 1 (Color Corrected Version), three versions of the ""Fly Me to the Moon"" and three versions of the ""Beautiful World"" themes (sung by Hikaru Utada).
  * FUNimation Entertainment Trailers

JUDGMENT CALL:

When I first heard that the rebuild of ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" would take place and that these new films would be based on the television series, I wasn't so surprised because the series is so popular that it would definitely generate an extreme amount of money for GAINAX.  But one thing that I was not looking forward and what drove me crazy about the TV series was the character of Shinji Ikari.  Back in the mid-90's, I can easily remember how his whining really tested my patience and looking back, he was such an anti-hero, mainly because he was ""emo"" most of the time.  Always negative, always in a bit of depression and funk as he always felt people didn't care about him (and yes, I know that Hideaki Anno was clinically depressed when he was creating this film and parts of show was based on his depression) but it did get on my nerves at the time.

But here we are nearly 15 years later and watching ""Evangelion 1.11 - You Are (Not) Alone"" and after it was all done, I was excited and hoping the second film would come out stateside very soon.  Yes, Shinji still whines and is still depressed but the fact is the film is structured a bit differently from the anime TV series and somehow, the pacing is much easier to take for the viewer with the film version and felt that the screenplay for the first film, the quality of the animation and artistic backgrounds and the music all worked together fantastically.

In a way, some part of me wants to rewatch first six episodes of the television series to find out the key differences (it's been 14 years and I can't recall too much from the television series except certain key scenes and the final episodes) were but personally, I found myself happy and content with this film that I look forward to seeing how Anno and the GAINAX crew tweak the next three films (and I can't wait until the final film).  But for the most part, I felt that the film, the voice acting, the animation, the art and everything else about the film was well done and fantastic.

As for the Blu-ray release, this release was just fantastic.  I felt the Eva 1.01 DVD release was good but after watching this Blu-ray release, ""Evangelion: 1.11 - You Are (Not) Alone"" is just fantastic and just an overall exciting release.  Fantastic picture quality, as well as phenomenal lossless Japanese audio.

As for the PG-13 rating, yes, ""Evangelion 1.11' has its share of violence and nudity, so this is not a series that you want to have your little kids around watching at all.  But overall, in the end, it was great to see Evangelion again but this time with the much improved reboot.  Nearly 15-years-later, it was definitely great to see Evangelion again but this time in a film sporting newer animation, CG, artwork and a solid screenplay and soundtrack.  But most importantly,  done in the way that the director Hideaki Anno had wanted but also what the fans have wanted as well.  And after I watched the film,  I can tell you that I loved it! The action, the drama is still intact.  Things may be a little different but still, fans of the original series will definitely enjoy this film release.

""Evangelion: 1.11 - You Are (Not) Alone"" is in the top 3 for best anime release on Blu-ray.  This release is absolutely fantastic and I definitely recommend this film in HD!",1268179200,72,9731,4.710401891252955

3333355,5,B0012V4WSW,"Like many fans out there, you're probably wondering what in the world the 1.11 rebuild of Evangelion is considering the 1.01 release is barely four months old.  While FUNimation has confirmed that 1.01 was the beginning of four rebuilt feature film releases, 1.11 isn't the second one but rather 1.01 again with some of its lighting (lack thereof) issues addressed, the addition of 2-minutes of new scenes and a second disc including a bunch of extra material.

Hard facts first: The release is comprised of a two-disc set, with the feature presentation now coming in at comes in at 100-minutes with an appropriate PG-13 rating due to animated action, violence and some ambiguous nudity.

Language options are standard sub & dub fair, which means the viewer is given the option of running the original Japanese dialog track or an English dub, either of which is presented in Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound. The option to turn on English subtitles exists for either language choice as well.

Extras are quite robust and occupy the entire second disc.  Included: Rebuild of Evangelion: 1.01 (Shiro Sagisu Version, Joseph-Maurice Ravel Version), ""Angel of Doom"" Promotional Music Video, News Flashes, Movie Previews: Preview 1 - Color-corrected version, Beautiful World Version 2, Beautiful World Version 2A, and Beautiful World Version 2B.

The story, while straightforward enough in presentation, has been the source of case studies, web-site devotion, even college thesis throughout the years and hence could never be summarized accurately (with dignity) here. However, to reduce it all down to its most basic levels, a young boy by the name of Shinji is thrust into a world beyond comprehension once an attacking ""Angel"" comes to town. It turns out that Shinji is one of few individuals in the world who possesses the rare ability to pilot the massive synthetic beings/ weapons known as Evangelions.

Reluctantly he allows himself to submit to the whirlwind of life-changing experiences associated with becoming an Evangelion pilot and makes some new friends and discovers more about his own past in the process. Working for a top-secret, underground (literally) organization known as NERV, Shingi's life as an average 14-year-old is forever lost to the reality that his destiny is to be the one to save all of mankind from imminent doom.

So here it is precisely twelve years since this very material graced Japanese movie screens, you may rightfully be wondering what it is that FUNimation is releasing here. The answer is a bit complex, but I'll do my best to set it straight.

Way back in October of 1995, the animated television series Neon Genesis Evangelion made its television debut in Japan. Two years later the work was ""rebuilt"" into a theatrical release that essentially spliced together the key moments of the tale into a larger, single effort. The mission was a success but kind of like what George Lucas has done with his Star Wars franchise, the creators behind the property always felt as though the technology available at the time wasn't quite where they would have liked it to be to accurately present the tale visually. Hence in 2007, the material was revisited once more, this time not simply remastering from the original film stock, but rather breaking the material down into its raw form so as to correct and readjust even the smallest imperfections such as animation density and errant particles as a result of using film. It was not so much an exercise of splicing new CGI effects and eye-candy into the original material as it was about using modern animation methods to perfect the look and feel of the original material. As an added bonus the CG elements allow for visual flair that was, at the time, quite impossible to achieve.

Hence that brings us back to this, the 1.11 release, which is the second official North American release of this rebuilt movie series (it is scheduled to be presented in 4 parts total, with the third and fourth parts being released together). Obviously, part 1.11 represents the introduction to the story.

If the timeline appears confusing, rest assured that sorting it all out is by no means a prerequisite to enjoying the film. It starts quickly with very little time spent establishing back-story and sweeps the viewer into a truly unique world where the precision and color pallet of modern computer generated animation melds seamlessly with the unique look of hand-drawn cells of yesteryear.

Plot wise, the tale is brisk and wonderfully entertaining with battle sequence on the absolute grandest scale broken up by moments of genuine character-development and emotional attachment. Perhaps the greatest of these being the sexual tension that exists between the lead characters or the appearances of the enigmatic father of young Shinji.

Fans, detractors, and scholars alike have gone to great lengths in drawing parallels and comparisons to Evangelion's symbolism throughout the years and yet agreement to or even knowledge of these theories is by no means necessary to come away from the film with satisfaction.

In fact, it has actually surprised me in revisiting this film (which is actually made up of the first six episodes of the original television series) at how much of an influence Evangelion has had over subsequent Giant Robot anime franchises like RahXephon and Aquarion. The show is rife with familiar archetypes such as the young boy being thrust into the role of humanity's savior, the biomechanical weaponry/ interfaces, the enigmatic villains that refuse to reveal their intentions, the impassive corporation behind it all, and the dysfunctional family structure that makes the antagonist question his very purpose of existence. Evnagelion is essentially the framework from which all others have followed.

The direction is simply wonderful with the structure of the film being more an endless succession of perfectly framed scenes than a random display of visuals. The voice acting is also quite notable whether you choose to enjoy the original Japanese dialog track (which is spectacular by the way) or the freshly dubbed English track featuring the talents of some of FUNimation's finest performers. Either option represents the perfect accompaniment to the impeccable visual work.

In all this release marks the beginning of a franchise that has been deserving of revalidation for quite some time. The approach taken with rebuilding the film from the basic elements must surely have been quite an undertaking for all involved but I can attest that the finished product simply oozes with hints of the level of perfectionism sought out in the process. Amazing things are truly possible when such a revered and definitive property receives the loving caress of modern technology's capabilities. Considering the asking price of the new build isn't much higher than the extra-feature-less 1.01 release, this is the recommended choice.",1267574400,444,6915,5.144256455921639

3333357,5,B0012V4WSW,"As it is with most EVA fans if you've seen the original series all the way through then you'll know pretty much how the story is meant to play out. However, with 1.01 and the following three movies Anno has remade the orginal series. In this reteling he has stated that ""this is how EVA should have been. this is what i wanted it to be."" instead of the original 18 angels there is only 12-13 due to the short timespan in these movies.

In this first installment the movie covers roughly the first 6 episodes of the series. Very few things are changed about the story line itself. In fact this movie is nearly indentical to those episodes, just merely compacted. Some of the major changes inlcude the EVA's looking different. Different in the sense that they are now more relative in shape. Not really scale wise simply that the EVA's forms seem to look more real. The torso's aren't as thin and look more realistic in a sense. Also the two EVA's seen in this first film have some minor chaonges in coloration also. Unit 01 now has a bright green section on its Torso and Unit 00 has been divided between a white lower body and a yellow upper body.

The characters and names have remained the same of course. the only real changes in story line is at the end of the film. During the ecounter with the 5th angel (Ramiel). Orignally this angel was just a floating octahedron capable of firing a bowerful beam and using a mechanical seeming drill to bore through the armor over the Geofront. Now its able to shift its form to some fairly dazziling displays and capable of far more destruction in the movie. Instead of the drill from the OVA it now is able to twist its shape and use its own body/power to drill down to the GeoFront. Along with the changes in this final batal of the movie, the means by which they destroy the angel has been upgraded and looks far better, to me, then it did in the OVA.

For those of us who have seen the entire series these first six episodes of course end with the destruction of the first three angels. however in the retelling the what was once the third angle (the first angel seen in the movie Sachiel) is now the fourth. there is no mention of course of the missing third angel. For new viewers of the series who instead purchased this version might be confused simply becase there is only mention of two other angels. those being Adam and Lilith. Lilith is actually shown and has had one minor change, that being its mask is no longer that of Seele. Its now just a plan tan mask.

In regard to the end of the actual movie. The scene with Kowaru on the moon speaking to the Seele monolith labeled 01. this is a very new and alltoghether never before seen clip for the series. I own the enitre OVA including the two DVD's released to retell the last two episodes of the OVA. Upon watching this movie i couldn't wait to see the remaining three. There are some changes seen in the preview of the second movie. Those being the introduction of Unit 02 and its pilot. there are some minor changes seen to Unit 02 as well in the short preview. There is even a glimpse of the Mark .06 EVA being constructed on the moon.

For those who never watched the series and are new to it i highly suggest watching the OVA first. In 1.01 there is very little description of NERV or Seele. let alone anything else. its all very cryptic and leaves you with alot of questions. It does make for an amazing story none the less. Along the lines of content, this movie has stuck fairly true to the series as i have said before.

I've watched all the original series (and barely made it out alive from 25-26) and absolutely love&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-End-of-Evangelion/dp/B000068OJ1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The End of Evangelion</a>. When I found out they were remaking the series, I was both excited and concerned, but it turns out my fears were alleviated when I finally got to see Evangelion: You Are (Not) Alone.

Gainax took the first few episodes of the series, cleaned up the story, and redrew all the art, amazingly integrated CGI (especially compared to its poor modern usage in anime) and used a movie budget to make something that looks GOOD to watch in 1080p. If you're as big an Eva fan as I am, or even if you just liked some of the series, I'd definitely recommend Evangelion 1.11. They've changed enough of it to flow better in a straight 110 minutes of run time and I didn't want to stop watching for a second.

Now, the real question begins: When will 2.11 escape to the United States?",1265068800,52,1096,5.151685393258427
3333359,5,B0012V4WSW,"This movie, like my title stated, is probability the best remake of anything I have ever seen. Looks awesome, sounds awesome, and feels awesome. What they have done with the story is really good, although you would have to already be an Evangelion fan to really grasp what is going on. I don't know why Amazon is saying the release date is later this year, I have had my copy for 4 months now. I highly recommend getting this and is a must have for any Neon Genesis Evangelion fan boy/girl.",1263772800,8,490,4.395604395604396
3333360,5,B0012V4WSW,"This movie is very good and true to the the original series! There are a few deference from the series, but that the point of the rebuild movies. It has the original voice actors(in Japanese) which that alone is very cool and lets you get a true feelings of Neon Genesis Evangelion.
The Video and Sound Quality are great its has the Dolby TureHD 6.1 Audio sound track. The Visuals are good and the video quality is great.
I would highly recommend Evangelion: 1.11 You Are (Not) Alone to any anime fan!",1263254400,10,501,4.456521739130435
3333361,5,B0012V4WSW,"When it comes to Evangelion I am a sucker, or feel like it. I own almost every (English) DVD release and when it came to the Platinum addition I started a love/hate cycle. I liked what I saw, it had some enhancements, but to say it really justified a full new release... ""Noaye"" :-)

So when I first learned about this release I had my bias opinion ready. The search for even more money had begun. When I saw the first scenes I was convinced that this was nothing more but a remake in a darker tone (where the Platinum edition seems oversaturated this one almost seems too dark) where seemingly nothing had changed set for some new digital animations and a slightly different (sometimes annoying) soundtrack.  Big deal.

I was wrong. And believe me: after buying the Platinum edition and /still/ wondering if I did the right thing this is not something I'll say easily.

And why?  The original series was very enjoyable and pretty awesome but in many ways it was severly limited in what could be done and displayed. Every die-hard Eva fan knows about the extremely brutal (and highly emotional) episodes ""Introjection"" and ""Ambivilence"" (Unit 4 going berserk and the most deadly Angel ever entering Nerv HQ) which almost got Eva pulled from the air. Well, if you thought that was something then you have another thing coming. The beginning of the real EVA.

Now, what would make me say these things?  Simple, its extremely enhanced realism, the extremely crisp looking animation, and the much more mature approach. Lets quickly dive into these topics; Realism... It starts to show during the fight with the second angel. Tokyo 3 was said to be a fortress to proect mankind from the Angels. But isn't it funny how the city could basically only retreat and restore the buildings without any means of active defenses? Heck; does it make sense to face an enemy while having its attention solely focussed on yourself? No it doesn't. And so the new Tokyo 3 has online defenses, and many of them! Resulting in attacking Angels who are also being distracted by these defenses.

Another thing; Shinji attacking the 2nd angel, getting his body virtually pierced and going in for the kill after only a quick ""auch"" and more screaming? No, not logical. Here we get to see how he basically picks himself up to go for the kill in the final stroke. Piloting an Eva is stressfull, and now it shows!

The 3rd Angel (the diamond) shows the second (added to the first) item; good animation and more realism. Instead of pushing some metal drill (powered by energy) into the ground it now basically twists its own body in. And a laserbeam which can level an armored train, blow up half a mountain, and it only shakes an Eva (with inexperienced pilot) and simply shatters a glass window (Nerv mobile HQ)? I don't think so.. And NOW we really get to see the kind of mental stress which piloting an Eva inflicts. After that ordeal you don't just stand up and pick up where you left off. No sirree.

And finally, the more mature approach. The series always had some nudity here and there, but cleverly covered or darkened enough. Not anymore. The children wear no clothes when putting on the plugsuit and thus that is showing, among other things. Enough details to make the story more realistic because its not forcefully covered up while keeping it to such a minimum that it doesn't make you wonder to have picked up some Evangelion hentai-like release. It simply looks and feels more realistic, and that is all.

This release is worth every penny in my opinion. Personally I'm waiting for the English (probably ADV) release but I'm not anxious for the English dubs anymore. I think now is also a good time to watch this in its original language with English subtitles. Thumbs up for me, 5 star rating. My advice; keep an open mind and try watching pieces before forming your opinion on it. This is different!",1229385600,2,3885,4.665204678362573
3333362,4,B0012V4WSW,"This is going to be a hard review to write.  You see, ""Evangelion 1.0: You are (Not) Alone"", the first in a four part ""Rebuild of Evangelion"" series of films, is an almost exact duplication of the first several episodes of one of the greatest science fiction series of all time.  So, having seen the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Neon-Genesis-Evangelion/dp/B000767QTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a>&nbsp;several times do I rate this remake as a standalone for people who aren't familiar with the show or for the hardcore Eva faithful who are going to watch this anyway?  I'll try my best to do both.  Since I already reviewed the series I won't get into why I love it as much as I do (see the NGE link above, mine's the one with the goofy video on it), but I'll tell you what did and didn't work for me this time around.

For the Eva curious, here's a quick synopsis.  ""Evangelion"" focuses on a sort of special forces organization known as NERV, who specialize in making giant robots (Evangelions) who are able to battle strange gigantic beings known as Angels.  These Angels attack the city of Tokyo 3 and conventional weapons are completely ineffective against them.  Thus, the Japanese government is forced to rely on NERV to prevent the Angels from destroying mankind.  Shinji Ikari and Rei Ayanami are two of the only children who are able to pilot the Evas and the story picks up on Shinji's first day on the job where he is forced to sub for an injured Rei and is rushed straight into battle where his Eva promptly falls on it's face and gets pummeled.  His strained relationship with his father (the director of NERV), tendency to wallow in self pity, and inability to connect with his coworkers make for an uncomfortable work environment.  Colonel Misato Katsuragi attempts to take Shinji under her wing and into her house while Rei rejects meaningful contact with him altogether.  The story about self-worth, interpersonal relationships, and the things that drive us to be who we are will play out in the minds of the protagonists, in the halls of NERV headquarters, and on the battlefield facing impossible odds as mankind's last hope.  This is just the beginning of one of the deepest and most epic science fiction stories ever told.

The differences between this film and the early episodes of the television series are annoyingly few. I realize that a similar thing was done with the first two volumes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hellsing-Ultimate/dp/B000H5V8O0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hellsing Ultimate</a>, but there were still enough differences in art, animation, flair, and story to warrant the remake.  This borders on tricking Eva fans into buying the same thing twice. The first hour or so appears to be literal reanimation of the storyboards from the original work, dialogue and all.  The character models are all identical to the show, the score is largely unchanged, even the first two battles play out almost exactly the same as before.  Of the things that were cut, the most annoying was the explanation of Tokyo 3's government: the Magi.  The concept of government by multiple artificial intelligences is a very interesting idea, but one only mentioned in passing in this first film.  Newcomers won't even have a clue what they are talking about.  There is also a shortage of quality character development.  There are just too many characters to introduce and not enough time to sort them out here. Eva simply seems to translate better to a continuous series than to the film medium.  A first movie -even those that are part of a larger story- should be largely self-contained and open to all comers.  This format makes Eva come off as a victim of lazy storytelling and bad pacing.  Maybe once all of the films are released the new big picture will make up for it, but I don't really see this movie converting many new fans.  For now, I'm not impressed with ""Rebuild of Evangelion"" as a new Eva brand.

If you do pick this up, there are some good points. There is some great-looking CG spliced into the film, usually mechanical stuff, weapons, and computer systems, but it looks very cool.  This iteration is also making a conscious effort to foreshadow, which raises my curiosity of what's to come.  The third Angel encounter is a beauty; easily the highlight of the film.  Ramiel (the 5th Angel) is the third battle and the most impressive.  Appearing again as a massive floating octahedron crystal, this time around it morphs into a number of visually dazzling forms and puts out some insane destruction.  The visuals are top-notch and the scenes manage an intensity not even found in the series at this point in spite of the fact that I already knew exactly how it ended.  If only they had put this amount of creativity and work into the preceding hour.  The movie ends on an intriguing and unexpected note that will be meaningless to those new to the series, but may well rock Eva fans.

I was tempted to rate this lower because of the fact that hardly anything important has changed in this retelling of the Neon Genesis Evangelion tale.  But the fact of the matter is I can hardly fault something too much for being too close to one the greatest anime properties ever.  After all, this is better than yet another&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/unnecessary-boxed-set-release/dp/B000VLL0O8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">unnecessary boxed-set release</a>&nbsp;and there is the promise of a new ending to the saga, which few fans will be able to resist.  So we're stuck with re-re-re-re-rewatching Evangelion, this time in a movie format with a little bit of extra here and there for the time being.  It had better be worth it.",1219276800,11,5830,5.0850840336134455
3333363,4,B0012V4WSW,"I watched most of the original TV series of Evangelion and found it to be rather haphazard. Having learned it was made on the cheap, dealt with constant censor issues due to it's time slot, and a director/writer who was using it to explore his own depression issues, it makes slightly more sense. It's an interesting blend of giant robots, navel gazing, fan service (minimal clothing), religious appropriation, self examination of depression, and straight up absurdist storytelling in some cases. It's even more interesting in that they seem to constantly go in and re-edit / remake the story constantly like George Lucas and Steven Speilberg monkeying with their old movies or Ridley Scott's 500 versions of Blade Runner.

Evangelion 1.11 is the newest version. So far, it's my favorite version of it. It's got most of the same beats but it moves quickly and doesn't ever slow down long enough to frustrate you with the waiting for something new that often happens on any TV show, they have a season to fill. None of that fat is here and the story barrels forward not giving you enough time to realize how goofy it all is really. The animation is well done. It looks great. I like the way they subtle updated the looks of characters with the way they handle proportions and the extra frames animation that the movie process and budget affords them.  They have more resources essentially in some cases to add body language that involves motion that the TV series wouldn't allow. You have to use poses when you're missing access to the money to show lots of movement.

It's not all roses as the movie still makes minimal sense. They're interesting in that they use Christian, full disclosure I love Jesus, imagery and prophecies from the book of Revelation but seem utterly uninterested in it. A lot of it feels something like a put on designed to fight the current adopted culture in the way some of the older samurai novels like Tale of The Genji do with Buddhism. It's not so much like they care about the religion itself, which they have blasphemy in ways they aren't expecting but fail in others where it's more obviously intended, but use it at times incorrectly to the detriment of the narrative to stick it to their distaste of current Japanese society. The funnier bit of course is that they have nothing to really replace it with but more of the same if you look at what the series promotes.

It's a fun enough watch. You don't have to be unhappy sitting through filler episodes. Plus, it looks good. I wouldn't recommend it people who'd never seen the original series and fans of the old stuff will find interesting story quirks.",1504137600,3,2639,4.693304535637149

3333407,5,B0012V4WSW,"I watched Evangelion 1.01 : You Are (Not) Alone both because of Interest In the series as well as the chief director of these 3 films Hideaki Anno Is also directing Shin Gojira and I wanted to get a feel of his style and It's safe to say I beyond Impressed. All my friends who watch Anime on the regular have always told me to check out the Evangelion series with high recommends since I'm big on giant beings beating the crap out of each-other. Holy crap this movie Is just.. PERFECT.. where do I begin?

Well for one thing, the animation Is absolutely PERFECT. I loved the mixture of traditional animation and 3D animation! The blending of the two really brought out the best In Anno's directing style and shows he's down to do something different and to do It right! Sound Design wise, the soundtrack Is just awesome & the Inclusion of the Utada Hikaru track Beautiful World at the end was a lovely choice and It honestly made me re-wind the movie a few times. The sounds of the mechanics and the Eva Units were realistic and even while animated, the sound design really brought out the believability In both weight and maintenance, the angels though.. holy crap.. Angel 6 Is without a doubt one of the most beautiful yet scary as hell designs ever! The way this thing would shift to attack was breathtaking and how It's charging sounds were basically a screaming woman In a higher pitch not only stunned me but also made me question the angels and their true nature, that coming from an animated movie just shows the ferocity behind the film's team. I watched the dubbed version of the film and I personally loved everyone's performances, everyone came off well fit to their characters and played them perfectly. No one felt out of place or out of character and they all gave a believable show.
The movie's story Is what I wasn't expecting to like as much as I did. Normally with giant anything In the story, main character backstories are kinda here nor there.. but Attack On Titan proved me wrong and.. so did Evangelion. I cared about Shinji, Rei, Misato & everyone In-between the mix, no one felt just THERE, the backstories & character personal galore made me connect with the main characters and they all felt real! One of the things I really loved with the film was the well balanced out drama and action, the film didn't pull a ""John Carter"" and each bit was just as engaging as the last!

Speaking of which, the drama In the film Is superb as Is the action. Watching Shinji go through the film doubting himself and not being able to accept that he's a good pilot with that emotional struggle was INTERESTING and left me cheering for him until the very end of the movie. Rei was left with some mystery towards her, but she still gave off a strong & cold performance until the end where she begins to break down a few walls. Misato from the beginning I saw as the big sister type, she was funny, unpredictable & In some ways the perfect teacher for Shinji! In the end It's her words that finally end the inner turmoil Inside Shinji's mind, she makes him realize this Is a one size fits all deal, everyone Is at risk. Couldn't give enough praises for the drama! Now, the action. When action hits the screen you feel every bit of It right In the center of your chest, the stakes are high the energy Is catastrophically addicting to watch and no matter your setting, you're cheering, gasping & crying al the way through each fight Is an emotional rollercoaster. I found It rather refreshing how well the drama and action were balanced out & how the team mixed at times was astounding! While the classic trope of ""talking while fighting"" was there, but It didn't feel like a burden and It helped that what was being talked about was Interesting!
Evangelion 1.01 : You Are (Not) Alone was one hell of a ride, I loved every minute! I became Invested In almost every character, I cared about their turmoil and well being, the action sucked me In and delivered an awesome experience In and of Itself. Can't get enough of It!

I was surprised to see this movie was made In 2007 no less, so It's almost on It's way to 10 years old, but you'd never guess that watching the movie. The movie has aged beautifully and I cannot wait to see the next two!

I give Evangelion 1.01 : You Are (Not) Alone a 5/5
and a HIGH recommend!",1466035200,2,4323,4.454545454545454

From the music, to the animation, to the dark and psychotic twists and turns followed by awkward comedic relief, all parts of the show come together perfectly. I can not think of another anime as deep and profound as NGE, nor can I think of one that has sparked so many theories and caused so many heated debates and meme's. Regardless, the Rebuild continuity is a departure from the original series for new fans to get into. If you have never seen the original NGE you will like this as it is very well done and has a tendency to simplify many aspects of the original. If your and NGE buff, you will like this too, but you have to keep an open mind. This was not made for the die hard NGE lover who has read all the manga's, seen every episode of the original (multiple times), watched all Death/Rebirth and EOE, posted in every anime forum, etc. It was made for a new breed of fan to enjoy with new graphics, new music, and additional explanations and twists. It may not be as deep and thought provoking as the original, but as a die hard NGE fan, I must say it's a refreshing take on an somewhat underrated cult anime icon.",1462406400,3,1181,4.300448430493273

Do you like drunken sexy captains of the guard who have a penguin that lives in their refrigerator (with the beer)?

Then this is DEFINITELY the movie for you.

Seriously, it's Evangelion, only... y'know, re-assembled.

In all seriousness, EVA was a hot mess on DVD and this is a sincere attempt to fix it. The transfer from VHS was NOT good, the people doing the frame-by-frame had a bad case of the caffeine shakes and a lot of the subtitling was just dreadful. This is a complete rebuild, so it's not only got cleaned up (redrawn?) animation but all the subs are perfect, the signage works. All the creepy religious symbolism is preserved, it just looks cleaner.

I still prefer the original, but hey. This is still great.

There were some differences toward the end which is a part of the retelling and re-imagination. I suspect this was due to the time constraints of the film. Other areas they went into greater detail than the series originally did. It's a great watch for newcomers and long time fans of the franchise. The only down mark I can give is some parts of the story, such as when Toji punches Shinji, was rushed and hurried with no lead up to why he did it, seemed oddly rushed and de-emphasized as these were big moments for Shinji's growth as a pilot and person. Otherwise, very well done and worth the watch.",1458432000,3,773,4.301369863013699

The original artwork was beautifully done with so much depth, deeper colors, gritty and haunting details, but still somehow had a warmth to it with every scene of animation and artwork. This one... (Shaking head sadly) is so ""over done"" with bright, solid, overly cartoon-ish colors that it now reminds me of a children's cartoon like Pokmon or Sailor Moon Crystal. So much of the detail has been lost for sake of a ""rebooted cash cow"" edition.
Now I'm not saying it's ALL bad. Some scenes have extra computerized moments that smoothly enhance the action and the brighter colors really make the Evas pop against the backdrop.

3333434,4,B0012V4WSW,"So I'm a fan of the original series and have it in the platinum edition. If you haven't, skip a few paragraphs down to hear about only the movie itself.

I kept seeing this item, and then eventually I saw the sequel, and I had no idea what it was. For a long time, I thought it was just a digitally remastered version of the originals, since I know DBZ got it's own make over. And honestly, I hated those new dubs for the characters, and it was a shock that some of those iconic scenes that I associated with my childhood were cut. So seeing these new Evangelion cases on the shelf made me really leery, and I really did not have an interest in indulging what I viewed as a way for the creators to make some more money by polishing off an already established series.

This is not that. At least not entirely. To explain, in case you are in the dark like I was when I finally did cave to my curiosity; this is sort of a reboot, but it is cast in full length movie format and the first half is almost a shot for shot remake. However, after the first Angel, the story begins to deviate a little, splicing in new stuff while peppering in some familiar scenes. Then it completely goes in it's own direction. It's a retelling of the Evangelion saga going more in to the internal dogma and backstory of the Angels and Gendo Ikari, while removing so much focus on Shinji and his angst. While the ending has a moon base and a final reveal of a character that was not present until the end of the original series.

There is a lot of familiar, and there is a lot of difference, and it's not bad. The first iconic battle in particular shook me a bit because it sounded familiar, but some of the musical timing was off from what I remember. It seems like a familiar place, but almost like someone has gone in while you were gone and shifted things 2 inches to the left just to see if you would notice. It's a weird feeling. Maybe it's the nostalgia I *feel* for the original that made me notice. The original saga felt like a classic anime in its style and atmosphere, plus more focus on the characters. So it's difficult to say which I like better. If it's possible, they enhance one another when juxtaposed. The each did something better than the other.

[ Item Review ]
The original aside, this movie was entertaining, action packed, and removed a lot of Shinji's kicking and screaming (which I think is a plus). The film focuses on the young teenager named Shinji Ikari, who is asked to pilot a giant mech known as ""Evangelion Unit-01"" to protect NERV, the organization, from the giant creatures known as ""Angels."" The plot is largely a point-for-point adaptation of episode 01 up to episode 06 of the original anime. While most scenes and events are replications of the original series, some unfold differently with new or omitted scenes.

Visually an impressive feat as everything is polished and crisp. The detail is intricate and color palette is vivid. This movie retelling feels shiny and new, and puts more work into the visuals especially where the Angels are concerned. The Sixth Angel, Ramiel, in particular received a beautiful make over.

If you haven't seen the series, this is well made condensed version of that story, which was already a phenomenal tale of human origins and the human condition. Interwoven into the mecha battles are deep themes as to what it is to be human, and what does it cost to continue to exist, what is existing. It is dialed down a smidge when compared to the shows, but this is the ""condensed"" version. The action is coordinated well and paces itself with the story expertly. I would still suggest seeing the original just because of it's cult classic status, but this movie does an excellent stand-in job if you can't get a hold of the show.",1435276800,,3776,4.457308248914616

For me, this looks amazing, in comparison to the platinum box collection released in 2007 - not by much, but there is a noticeable difference. However, for me, all that gave the series episodes depth and interest has gone. To use a mate-desirability analogy, this release is a bit like a supermodel that looks stunning but is superficial in character and acts like someone you have no desire to spend any time with, to put it politely.

Yes, this release looks great, but all the interaction between characters has been cut out and we don't really get to know the characters or gain any understanding of their personalities - possibly because there is not time for them to shine. What we get is one ""bot attack"" after another. I think this was done just to squeeze as many episodes as possible in to a single film. These fights look great, but what we have is fight after fight with very little discernible story. I couldn't empathise with any of the characters, consequently, I didn't care much for what little story there was. At the end, I really wasn't bothered about seeing the subsequent films.

What lets this film down even more is the time between subsequent films. This is one of three, but the time between each release is >1yr.

I was not impressed with this release. Let's hope that the long awaited ""live action"" version, if it ever actually happens, is more true to the original episodes of the series. In summary, I'd say avoid this and go for the aforementioned 2007 platinum box set.",1421452800,,1546,4.631386861313868

3333482,2,B0012V4WSW,"I'm reviewing 1.11 and 2.22 together.

These remakes of Evangelion are pretty, but they really mishandle the best parts of the original series;  The original show is flawed, but what makes it brilliant in my opinion is the gradual realization of what's really going on, which makes you suddenly wonder towards the end if you've been rooting for the wrong side the whole time.  I was also genuinely shocked and horrified at the revelation of Rei's true nature.  In these remakes, however, that's all either explained right up front and then expanded on or heavily hinted at to the point of being obvious.  It turns out what comes across as sinister and disturbing when it's left mostly mysterious is just a bunch of kooky nonsense when you explain it all.

It's sort of like if someone remade the original Star Wars trilogy to begin with Obi-wan explaining to Luke, ""Darth Vader is your father, but he's a real jerk now, and you have the power of the Force because of these microscopic organisms called midichlorians in your blood,"" and then the plots proceed mostly like you remember, but with subplots thrown in about Darth Vader having an ugly custody battle with Aunt Beru and how all the Force users need this special energy drink to keep their midichlorian counts up.  It doesn't solve any of the original's problems and somehow manages to create new ones.

Also, they add a new glasses girl character in the second installment who seems either like a Mary Sue insert or a throwaway to the erotic fan art crowd. She's better at piloting an eva than anyone else, and she knows all about the back story of what's going on, so she just makes it all the weirder that the show and the other characters are all focused on Shinji, who's still just as annoying as ever.",1410566400,,1766,4.637820512820513

Never liked the Shinji character development, just wanted to see robots fighting monsters.

With 1.11, they edit a lot of those out, so it seems faster paced and gets to the action pieces quicker.  I like the interspersed CGI, and look forward to how the story will further deviate from the original.

Even though many people say that the entire series is difficult to understand i found it to be incredible engaging, easy to relate to the characters and most of all one of the best stories i have ever read.

Anyhow, when I heard about the Rebuild movies, I couldn't wait to get more Eva, and this gorgeous little movie didn't fail to sate my obsession.

Animation was beautiful (even the CG animation looked fine, and I usually loathe CG), Shinji and Misato's original VAs came back to voice, and overall this is one great anime film. Think of it as the first 6 episodes, but with the budget we wished it had.

My only two complaints are Ritsuko's VA Colleen Clickenbeard, who's usually pretty good, coming off as flat, and not getting to hear Cruel Angel's Thesis, but that's just nitpicking.

This isn't just a remake with beautiful visuals and a revamped soundtrack, this is the very best way to tell the story of Neon Genesis Evangelion in my opinion. It also is easier on people who are new to the series since it is more digestible (to put it some way).

To those that don't know Evangelion: this is not for those with strict religious beliefs and are easily offended, this is not for children, this is violent and has a lot of adult content.

Also a warning to the fans, I hated the third movie and think this reboot is only good until Evangelion 2.22 (although I haven't watched the 4th one yet).",1390348800,,701,4.343511450381679

Shinji goes through this and other ordeals in a lonely manner, feeling unwanted and unloved and is only able to go through it as he grows attached to Rei, the first pilot of an EVA (00) who has been injured before his arrival and whom also seems to attract the attention and affection of his father.",1390262400,,663,4.533333333333333

3333548,4,B0012V4WSW,"This review is a little late, as I got this about a week ago. I tried to cope with not writing one about the shipping and packaging, but it finally got to me.

I love the Rebuild series much more than the original Neon Genesis Evangelion show much more, mainly because both the original ending and End of Evangelion, in my opinion, were terrible. The rebuild gives much more satisfaction on how the story progresses with renewed animations and (for the most part) a new plot.

The shipping time was amazing. Bought the standard of 3-5 business days and received it in 2 days, much quicker than anticipated.

Unfortunately, I had to give this a 4/5 star rating. If I were rating the movie alone, I would have definitely rated it 5 stars in a heartbeat, but...

How the DVD was shipped was disappointing. The box used was quite larger than the DVD cases themselves, which is normal and fine. What wasn't fine was they used a really terrible form of packaging / wrapping. There were 3 small pouches of bubble wrap on top, one which was already popped. There was no type of bubble wrap protecting the sides and corners of the cases. (IE: The case didn't lunge forward or backwards, but slid all around the box. I confirmed this by putting in Finding Nemo. The case is the same measurement and I re-wrapped it using the same methods, shook the box for about 10 seconds, and got the same results as when I first opened the package.) The case came dented on all corners of the case, the clear wrap around the box was partially torn open (very small, but still). One of the corners of the DVD case when i pulled out of the shipping box was also torn.

To most people, this isn't a big deal. They'll probably even argue with me that I should get over it, it's not that big of a deal, etc. I'm not one of those people and these types of things bug me greatly. I believe that if you're going to ship out a product, it should be done properly. I'm happy the DVDs themselves are in perfect condition, but having the case like this makes me quite angry. Please use better packaging in the future.",1386028800,,2082,4.383419689119171

If you never saw the originals, you need to be prepared to have no idea what is going on, while you're constantly being forced to sit through a boy's sniveling teenage emo angst.

Honestly, I wanted to like this incredibly drawn, highly acclaimed anime but couldn't, because it was terrible.
My memories of the original show were that it started as a great mech anime, with a bit too much Catcher in the Rye complaining, that devolved into a pseudo-intellectual waste of time.  My hopes for this re-cut were high, with the original being visually impressive, and this being an improvedment, but it had two huge flaws.
First, they threw you into the world with almost no context at all.  If I had not seen the originals, I would have had no idea what was going on for the first 45 minutes.  I was trying to show this to a friend in first sitting, and didn't stop asking questions.
Second, they kept all of Shinji's whining nonsense.

The handful of minutes spent on the amazing fight scenes was not enough to make up for the rest of the show.

Maybe 2.22 and 3.33 were done better, but I'll never know unless they show up on Netflix.  I'm not wasting another dime on boring teenage angst.",1385596800,3,1255,4.454148471615721

I swear I am looking at the same animation sometimes because they are so similar to my VHS tapes but they aren't.  Every frame is super sharp and detailed.  It just looks super amazing in HD.

All our favorite characters are here, and even the American voice dub of Shinji is annoying like before.  I just wish he wasn't so annoying, but I guess that is his character.

I would reccomend it to fans of Evangelion, mecha anime, or animation in general. The blu-ray clarity is awesome and makes every detail visible.

I was a bit bummed that the film didn't have an audio commentary, however, the other features and the film itself more than  make up for it.

For one thing, seeing Evangelion with updated animation is very nice, and the re-telling of the first 6 episodes is handled competently, albeit lacking a few very important details I would have loved to see updated. The huge problem is how this first film feel so disconnected from the other two movies of the franchise. 2.22 did a decent job of balancing the old and the new, while 3.33 went off-the-rails bonkers trying to do a new ""thing"" while at the same time being an unoriginal rehash of episodes 23-24. So, in the wake of the second and third films, the first one feels disjointed and abandoned given that Studio Khara decided that they weren't simply gonna do a rehash... even though they did just that with the third film. I suppose I still enjoy it, even though my opinion of the Rebuild series has reached an all-time low. Eva fans will have no choice but to see it, but to non-fans I don't recommend it.

3333569,5,B0012V4WSW,"Overall, this is an excellent film. I couldn't have been happier with how it was portrayed to a modern audience. For those unfamiliar with the Evangelion series: it was a very popular anime created in the late 90's that undermined the mech-anime genre. The series has maintained a faithful audience after it's show's end. It focuses on pilot Shinji Ikari as he struggles with the responsibility of being a pilot as well as the psychological damning associated with his father. The original series is incredibly complex and occasionally outright perplexing, but seriously rewarding to watch. This ""rebuild,"" as the show's creator describes it, is a great way to test the waters. For newcomers to the show you will be given an altered version of the original storyline with updated graphics and a more linear story progression. While this may be upsetting for die-hard fans of the original, I found it refreshing to see the story take on a new perspective, and some of the changed (more clearly explained) material helped me better understand the original series.

While I would recommend the original series as a superior story, you can't go wrong with the ""rebuild,"" especially when you consider the price of the original series is incredibly expensive due to its discontinued printing. The original series is great, but I am equally captivated by the changes done to the four movie interpretation. With the next two movies releasing in the following years, I am eagerly anticipating their release to see how Evangelion Rebuild concludes the quadrilogy.",1378684800,,1553,5.090196078431372
3333570,1,B0012V4WSW,"I avoided this series for a long time because I thought it would be nothing but giant robots fighting monsters, which is cool and all, but I could never commit to a whole series based on that alone. But when I heard that it's actually more about character development, I became hopeful, and decided to check out the movie at least.

And... it was pretty much giant robots fighting monsters. It is real clear that this was the driving force of the film, as these scenes were beautiful. But the characters that I were promised were amazing... They fell completely flat. There is no depth to them at all, and any development seemed extremely forced. I could not get invested in them at all, and did not care if they lived or died. It was a chore to finish this film, and I do not think I shall be watching the others.

Now, to be fair, I STILL haven't watched the series. This review is for the film itself. For all I know, the characters in the show are GREAT, but if they are anything like they are here, then I will surely be avoiding that as well.",1378425600,2,1048,4.287878787878788

Have not seen the original tv anime series so these films are an amalgamation of several episodes from what I gather.

The artwork/animation is fine, English dub is very good (I'm yet to be anywhere near competent in Japanese) Voice actors reprise their roles throughout multiple versions of this ""juggernaut"" of the anime world, which is a good thing.

I do have two warning to those who are buying this release: First, the box art says that there is a 20 page guidebook that comes with the movie. M first copy did not have it and when amazon gave me an exchange, it didn't have it in that one either. It's not too big of a deal for me, I just have a ""thing"" for having a complete package.

3333642,5,B0012V4WSW,"The Rebuild of Evangelion kicks off with this movie, the first of a four-movie epic that is still in the making.

To be clear, you don't need to see a single thing of Eva to be comfortable watching this movie. But, fans of the movie won't be left with another Death & Rebirth. The first Evangelion movie was a bit of a snore-fest for fans, as it was basically a compilation of scenes from all the past TV episodes of the series, leading up to the final movie and episodes 25-26.

Instead, Eva 1.11 represents a retelling of the series that will both welcome new fans, and leave old fans scratching their heads.

Part of the mystique around Eva 1.0/1.11 (1.11 is simply 1.0 with some minor improvements, you're watching Eva 1.0 if you get this movie), is the lingering question of what Eva 1.0 represents.

It is difficult to answer the question of if Eva 1.0 is a remake or not, even watching the movie completely through. Bottom line, if you enjoyed Eva in the 1990s, you will enjoy Eva 1.11. It isn't simply 1990s footage rendered/upscaled in HD. The movie has been hand-crafted for viewing in theaters, and the light use of computer generated animation only benefits the all-new, all-HD hand-drawn scenes.

But please, watch it in Japanese with English Subtitles. It's the only proper way to enjoy Eva (and I'm saying that as a fan of the English dubbed voice actors).",1355616000,,1371,4.602459016393443

3333645,5,B0012V4WSW,"Just so you know, this is the definitive version. There was a previous DVD/bluray release that came out too dark, so they fixed it, and re-released it.

Now on to the real review...

The original Eva was a landmark series, and I am a great big fan of Evangelion (I own the series, the movies, the Manga, etc). I don't believe in trying to sell people on my fandom, but I want to give my honest review of this movie.

What should be made clear is this is not a good starting point. The movie is an abridged version of the first six episodes of the series, so the pacing feels off. The movie assumes you're already familiar with the characters, so it tries to get to the interesting parts quicker.

Some of the most ardent Eva fans might say they dumbed it down. Made more action-y. Things that were only hinted at before get boldly explained. The truth is, there will be no time to talk about it later.

I was tempted to give it a 4, because it's not friendly to new viewers, but I was thoroughly impressed by the movie's visuals. This is not a simple HD up-scaling of the TV series. They went back to the drawing board and remade the series.

-All new animation.
-Digital Ink.
-Widescreen.
-HD Quality.

Oh, my god, it looks FREAKING BEAUTIFUL! You have to get it on Bluray, and the bigger screen, the better. Don't settle for DVD.

This is the first time seeing anything to do with the series, so I was unsure what to expect.  I read all of the other reviews that gave the title 5/5 and raved about it, so I decided to buy it and see for myself.  All I really knew about the series is that it had to do with gigantic mechs, but I had no idea about anything else in the movie plot.  I found myself pretty confused in the beginning, since I had no idea what the ""Angels"" were, where they came from, and what was going on.  By the end of the movie, I had a slightly better idea, but I think the movie could have explained a little more and given a little more of the back-story.

Technical Aspects

From the packaging, down to the art style of the animation, everything is top-notch.  The Blu-ray packaging is really cool; the interior case has this kind of purplish-iridescent plastic (doesn't really impact anything, but was a really unique addition.  Really cool.).  It also comes with a small art-book (I haven't really looked at the whole thing yet).

The surround sound is really awesome.  I was really impressed with how well the sound and animation is.  I have the Blu-ray edition of ""Ponyo,"" and this movie has some really awesome surround sound, so I kind of use this as my benchmark.  Evangelion 1.11 stacks up very well with ""Ponyo,"" as far as surround-sound goes (excellent).

The animation, and the intricate detail of the machinery of the city are really awesome.

Story/summary

The main character is a whiny, emasculated male, and that was pretty annoying to watch.  I cared more about the other protagonist, the girl Rei, than I did the main protagonist (she was much more of a likable character, and showed real bravery).  Regardless, I give the movie a 4/5, because, even though the back-story isn't as fleshed out as it could be, and the main character isn't very likable (and annoying, actually), I still think the movie as a whole is very good.  Also, part of the one star that I took away from a perfect score was because of my personal taste--I really did not think the mechs were as cool as I expected.

I've also purchased Evangelion 2.22, and after I watch that, I will have more time to reflect on the first movie (I suspect if you watch both together, it will improve the overall experience).",1352419200,2,2492,4.85781990521327
3333648,5,B0012V4WSW,"The series was great! This movie is the first four episodes together, but it is easier to tell what the characters are thinking. I suppose there was some added character development scene that way someone new to the series could understand what kind of people they are dealing with. I was... 14 when I first saw the series and would recommend it to anyone who likes to watch characters grow, giant robots (evas) battle, or even just jam out to the music. The only problem with the series I had was the fanservice, but I got used to it after a while. This is a legendary anime brought to the big screen with beautiful animation. You are missing out if you haven't seen this or at least the series. WATCH IT!!!

The good:
The packaging is awesome and shiny.  The movie's quality has been turned up a notch from 1.01, even though they're both DVD and NOT Blu-Ray.  This movie got me into the Evangelion fanbase, and I love it even more now.  The animation is several notches above the original by successfully merging CGI and pencil-drawn animation together, and it really shines during the action scenes (which are spectacular).  The characters are far more likeable this time around, seeing as how this is the beginning of a four-film remake of the original series, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and the voice acting is far superior to the series (like everything else is).  I have almost nothing but good things to say about this product.
The battle against the sixth angel at the end is when this movie REALLY gets good, although it was already good, the whole second half of the movie when this angel comes in is when things REALLY get going.  That, and the developing relationships of the characters, made this movie AMAZING.
The bad:
When I opened it, the first disc was loose, but nothing was broken or scratched and the DVDs were in perfect condition still.  Another minor complaint is that the beautiful packaging can get smudged by fingerprints all too easily.
But overrall, FIVE OUT OF FIVE (though I may be biased, since I'm a huge fan).  This movie hooked me from beginning to end.",1350345600,,1520,4.7272727272727275

3333656,3,B0012V4WSW,"While I can say that Rebuild is definitely not a waste of your time if you are an Eva fan, this particular installment will probably not leave you particularly satisfied. Whereas the next movie in the Rebuild continuity effortlessly goes into new territory that at times surpasses the original series, Rebuild of Evangelion: You Are (Not) Alone will mostly feel like feature length recap of the first six episodes of the series, from when Shinji Ikari first fights the Angel Sachiel to the climactic Yashima Operation.

The main problem is the fact that the six episodes were written to be episodic, obviously,  which doesn't exactly translate well to being stitched together into a two hour movie. Some content has also been cut, as well - notably, the scene after the battle with Sachiel when Eva 01's headpiece falls off to reveal its true nature has been cut out, though, unless you are new to the Evangelion universe, you probably already know all about what the Evas really are. Ultimately, both those that are new to Evangelion as well as the existing fanbase will probably feel as if this is simply setup for what is to come.

It isn't all for nothing, though, especially if you are new to Evangelion and weren't able to make it through the TV series' laborious, monster-of-the-week first ten episodes. There is some new content, as well - towards the climax of the movie, we are shown the reason why the angels are attacking NERV (spoiler: NERV has a giant alien monster in their basement),and there's a scene at the end involving the mysterious Kaworu Nagisa that brings with it some unexpected twists.

Overall, this may be a good starting point for those new to the series, and I can guarantee you that sitting through this is worth it for the second Rebuild movie. Those who have seen the original series, however, should probably best just skip right to 2.0, unless, like myself, you are a diehard Eva fan.",1334102400,,1920,4.756756756756757
3333657,5,B0012V4WSW,"I am by no means a hardcore Anime fan but I enjoy and appreciate the art of the animation medium. I had seen the original EVANGELION TV series on DVD back in the late `90s and enjoyed the series. When I saw this remake and it's second part (2.2 You Can (Not) Advance), I was blown away by the quality of direction, story and technical achievement. This is a fresh, complicated, original and highly moving storyline that bears multiple viewings and maybe even some research online to really drill down and understand the complexities of the story's characters and actions.

I was also very impressed with the marriage of traditional and digital animation by this director and crew of artists. I've seen a lot in the world of animation storyboarding and direction over the decades but this film had me re-winding to see some amazing action sequences again and again. This is a film series that many artists learning the trade today should study.

I cannot possibly top the well written and detailed reviews of others here in describing plot or other important details of this film series production. Just wanted to toss in my two-cents and recommend this volume and it's follow up, 2.2, to fans of the genre or students of animation in general.

EVANGELION is not for children nor those who have no tolerance for the sci-fi or Anime genres in general. But judging by how my daughter reacted to seeing it for the first time, this series should please a great many teens and young adults looking for more depth and complexity in their characters than just young heroes who venture off in giant robots to defend humanity from strange creatures",1332028800,,1638,4.7403508771929825
3333658,4,B0012V4WSW,"Evangelion 1.11 is basically a retelling of the Neon Genesis Evangelion TV series ep1-6 with very few deviations from the original. Of course, this is a decade newer with a much larger budget, so the animation quality itself is vastly superior, spectacular by every sense of the word. If I have any complaints they are that this new version simplifies the characters and their faults (in my opinion, the crowning achievement of the original show) and instead focuses more on action and intense battle scenes. However, this directorial decision also makes the whole thing more streamlined and accessible for the average anime fan. Finally, the English dub of this film is fantastic, practically as good as the original Japanese audio and that's saying something!

Here's a list of everything you get with this DVD purchase:

-A 16 page booklet which includes official artwork, character profiles, etc.
-A short making of feature ""Rebuild of Evangelion 1.01"" which shows a bit of the animation process, there is no dialogue and there are two versions featuring different musical pieces
-Previews, news flashes, and trailers
-""Angel of Doom"" music video (wonderful new musical composition by Shio Sagisu)
-English and Japanese audio and subs

3333659,4,B0012V4WSW,"A few years back, I heard the Evangelion anime series described as ""the Watchmen of anime.""  I rented the first disc (episodes 1-4 of the original edition) and thought ""Eh, it's okay.""  A couple of months ago, I decided to give the series another shot by buying 1.11.  Wow.  The story is pretty much the same as before (of episodes 1-6, I gather), but the animation quality is so much better.  I would call it ""state of the art"" if I knew what the state of the art is, but the CGI and painted animation blend together beautifully.  The Sixth Angel in particular...but I suppose I should describe the story.

In the near future, the Earth has been under attack by giant beings called ""Angels.""  During an event called ""The Second Impact,"" half of the population of the world was destroyed.  The NERV organization has built an enormous base underground in Japan from which they operate the Evangelions (Evas for short), which are apparently gigantic mechanical-organic robots.  These Evas can only be piloted by certain teenagers (for reasons which may be explained later).  Most of the plot of this first film deals with Shinji Ikari (pilot of Eva unit 01) as he fights the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Angels.

If the series were nothing but giant robots (or mechas) fighting giant monsters, it wouldn't be as interesting as it is.  Some people complain about ""whiney Shinji,"" but how would you feel if all of a sudden you were required to pilot a giant robot, having had no training of any kind, and if you fail the human race will end?  And the man who created the Evas is your father and your mother died when you were a baby and now you're living with a hot 29 female year old Lt Colonel and this kid at school puched you in the face and there's this other Eva pilot who you kinda like, but she has blue hair and she's so spaced out she seems inhuman and...well.  Also, behind NERV is a secret society called Seele, whose members speak of ""Lilith"" and ""the Human Instrumentality Project.""  What are they up to?  Well, you'll have to continue with the series to find out.

Ratings-wise, I suppose it would be PG-13 due to violence and a few moments of fanservice.

I suppose if someone told me Watchmen was the best comic of all time and then handed me issue #1, I would have thought, ""Eh, it's okay.""

I have seen this over and over again I was attempting to figure out what the hype was all about and Well in my Opnion (IMO) They should not have ""Remade"" This series.  The orginal you have to take alot in it had some great action and awesome grapgics for its time, The orginal story jumped around alot and it seemed that the ending was done to quickly, the orginal did not take ""IMO"" enough time to explain the main Charaters and made them either realy Winny, Exstreamly tempermental or Emotionaly blank...The orginal I would of given 3 perhaps 4 stars b/c even with some of the flaws you still had a awesome Scf-fi anime but in all that was the Orginal series.

However this is a remake of the orginal series and I do see that they cut alot out to add some eye candy to this generation of Anime viewers. Personaly I think they did a poor job of it and should not of messed with something that had flaws to begin with.

But on a side note it's still a Sci-fi anime with loads of action but b/c of the cuts and the trimming they made I do think they made it much much worse.",1324080000,3,1132,4.131818181818182

Actually, let me correct that, it is essentially the original series, only condensed into two hours.  All the highlights from the original are here, essentially without change -- except to exaggerate them in unwelcome ways.  And in the process of condensing the story and attempting to intensify certain dramatic highlights, a lot of what made the original series worth watching has been lost.  The animation is essentially identical (save for the Angels, which are markedly improved).  The depth and nuance that made the original so surprising, has been lost in the translation.  The epic battles with the Angels, which kept you on edge throughout the original, lose most of their impact from being condensed to two minute vignettes, over and done with before you can start to care.  And the worst, the musical score is like something from a James Cameron movie.  Knowing where the original series was headed, in hindsight, the whole point behind Hideaki Anno's original project appears lost in the attempt to make everything bigger, brighter, and more marketable.  I hear the second is much better, and I can only hope so, having already purchased it.  If you're thinking of purchasing this, do yourself a big favor and purchase Neon Genesis: Evangelion discs 0:1 and 0:2 of the original anime series instead.",1319846400,4,1428,4.9831223628691985
3333669,5,B0012V4WSW,"Well, I thourghly enjoyed this version of Evangelion.  The graphics were movie quality.  The Engilsh dub is on par with the original.  Story and plot were chillingly excellent.

However, I could tell there were changes in their voices.  They are older now, so that is understandable, but I their original voices fit better.  Another thing I noticed is that there isn't that same emotional spirit in 1.11 compared to the English dubbing of the original series.  Just compare the emotional joy you can hear out of Ritsuko when she says, ""He's walking!"" in the first episode of the original, versus Ritsuko exclamation in 1.11.  You could tell that the voice actors had a lot of fun doing the original.  But, they still do a stellar job of the English dub in 1.11.

Another thing that fans may or may not like, is that 1.11 is more condensed.  There is no filler at all.  This is good because the story progesses quickly and is more condusive to action and a sense of urgency.  However, the character developement is reduced.  But not reduced so much that the characters lose their emotion, their feelings, their reason for being.  The difference in character developement between the series and 1.11 is that the series had more time.  In the first 5-8 episodes of the series where we see Ayanami's life is completely desolate; in 1.11 her life is empty.  In the series Ayanami's life cuts our soul, in 1.11 her life hurts us deeply.  This is pretty much the same for most of the other characters.  Character developement is absolutely great.  But its hard to compare with the series that had 3-4 times more time to develope their characters.

You'll be relieved to know that the plot, pacing, timing, etc, etc, ... still retains its Hitchcockishness.  The complexity and mood wrenching is completely intact.

For those who have seen the OVA, this is basically a turbo-charged retelling of it meaning that nearly everything's redone with today's computer technologies giving it a mega budget feel.

You Are Not Alone encompasses about a third of the original OVA with new material that sheds more light on the relationship between Shinji and his father including a funeral scene. Unlike the OVA, this feature is easier to get into, which, depending on what you thought of the denseness of the OVAs can be good or bad. Not to say that this feature isn't ""deep"" its that this feature backs off of some of that so  that you can appreciate the main justification for its existence, its visuals, and here they are nothing short of extraordinary augmented with the cgi elements they've added. And the EVAs in this one are even brighter and more deeply colored and truly neon.

This remake project, beginning with 1.11, promises to take the Evangelion mythos in directions both eerily similar, yet drastically different from its previous incarnation.

This first installment covers the expository story arc from episodes 1-6 of the orgiginal TV series. Its subtle changes in plot, tightening of the script and scores of visual enhancements were refreshing. All of the original animation has been scrubbed and polished and has never looked better.

From a visual and audio standpoint, the blu-ray version of 1.11 is fantastic. At the bargain price for which this blu-ray disc can be had, it's a must buy. Don't even waste your time with the standard DVD version. Sadly, there isn't a lot of substantial bonus material on the disc, but there's no arguing that Funimation's presentation is first-rate.

Plus, what more can I say about Hikaru Utada? The J-pop star delivers in a major way with ""Beautiful World,"" a song that rocks the closing credits from start to finish.

As soon as the feature starts you can see what's familiar and what's not. The image quality is outstanding for starters and the addition of CGI does wonders to the story without getting in the way, thankfully. What starts as subtle differences soon become the real points that give you a sense of the actual, new direction the filmmakers are taking. This is good. I'm glad it's not just a frame by frame rebuild but rather a re-adaptation. Some scenes you don't get anymore, and to be honest some of them I missed them.

The score is different too and I wonder why they changed it since at most of it to me sounds as good as the original. I'm not very impressed by changes being done just for the sake of change, you're going to take out something, make sure you replace it with something better.

Still, what you get once the credits start rolling is a different sensation. The feature length changes the pace of the original, this one you don't have to absorve it 20 or so minutes at a time, and that's good too.

-  story backdrop/synopsis

I've seen the compiled movie versions and have rented/borrowed the first original 10 episodes. The animation in this DVD (and v 2.22)

First the image quality looks awesome on my 1080P LCD tv.  Evangelion has never looked better.  Second while I only have a 2.1 sound system, the 6.1 HD audio track sounds impressive.  I am especially impressed at the work done on the US english dub.  The US audio engineer didn't lay the english voice track on top of the sound but blended all sound tracks together.  The end result is a sound track resembling a summer action block buster theatric release.  While the japanese audio emphasizes the dialog track over all other sounds as usual.

On the other hand this disc appears to be lacking in extras considering the storage capacity of a blu-ray disc.  The slick container and information booklet don't quite makeup for the lack of on disc extras.

As for the story itself, I consider this version to be an alternate universe.  While it appears to be the first six tv episodes, with better graphics, there are subtle differences from the very beginning.  Keep this in mind and you most likely won't have a fit.",1307491200,,1224,4.479638009049774

You don't meet any new characters in 1.11, but you'll find that the characters are brought up better, and the story goes pretty fast (because of it being a feature film). For Neon Genesis fans, you'll find that Shinji isn't so whiny anymore (take note that I said ""isn't so"") and he actually has ""dropped one"". The visuals in 1.11 are amazing to say the least. If you have a Blu-Ray player, get it so you can watch it in HD (Again, for previous fans of the show: Ramiel looks so cool). It's fun to look at, and there's plenty of action in this to keep an Otaku and a person new to anime excited.

Pros: Story retelling, new characters and improvements to the previous characters.
  Stunning visuals, especially in HD.
  Action-packed.
  Not episodic.
  Lots of Extras.

Cons: The story does go pretty fast, so those of you who didn't watch Neon Genesis Evangelion might get a little lost.

On a side note for Parents: It is boarderline PG-13 - R. It is mildly graphic in violence. There is mild language, but no F-Bombs for those of you that care.

But I was bit unsure of getting into the series, which meant spending loads of money to buy box sets of DVDs and spending time to get emotionally involved.  Fast forward to today, and I see these rebuilds of the original series for sale, which are films that combine the material essences of the franchise with updated touches, shades, 3D CGI support, animation sequences, and new elements to flesh out the original creator's desires with new tools of animation at his team's disposal.

I have never watched a Neon Genesis Evangelion episode, so I was treated to an instant classic even though I was never exposed to its storyline one bit.  An intense storyline combined with imagination that is timeless, I see why Evangelion is the prime series where other mecha draw instant inspirations.  The animation and the art of this re-boot is simply fantastic, bringing modern Tokyo-3 looking like today's Tokyo but with the futuristic mold of the not too distant future with mechs and more mechanized buildings.  The action sequences are intense, but never go beyond overload; the climatic scene when facing the 6th Angel is stupendous.

Though a cliche anime story of a young boy who is pulled out of nowhere to save mankind from certain doom and follows his angst and struggles along the way, its nonetheless a timeless tale that really shows why it pushed the world of anime into a new realm staring in 95'.

PROS
- The animation is completely redone, but uses most of the original animation cells as reference so it's almost identical.
- Much improved visual effects and audio over the original.
- Added scenes, re-imagined scenes.
- Altered English script makes the plot a little more understandable.

CONS
- English script slightly altered from original. There are many ""special"" lines that were altered for no apparent reason. And some of the humor is gone, like the ""toothpicks"" censor when Shinji is naked in Misato's apartment.
- Scenes have been cut or rearranged.
- Pacing is altered.

CONCLUSION
I see 1.11 as a ""supplement"" to the original series. The two combined really complete the vision of Evangelion. But if you watch 1.11 first, you're really missing out on some stuff.

The reboot is much more direct in that aspect; in the original, it was hard to sympathize with some of the characters because their personalities (or lack thereof) develop over the length of the series, and some of them never have a chance to redeem themselves or resolve their problems. A little of that issue was taken care of in the final movie, which was good, but felt like a footnote on the end of a 26 episode series--a series which sorely needed a resolution to wrap up the story and give the viewer a feeling of closure.

The new Evangelion is going to be much more straightforward. It explains things as they're happening rather than recounting the whats and whys in later episodes, while still leaving some mystery as to the purpose of some characters and their motives. It's definitely a series to buy because it's worth owning and re-watching. It is not a re-hash of the old series; it is Evangelion re-imagined--Eva in another dimension. Not to mention, the animation is fantastic.",1304467200,,1475,4.735408560311284

It's common knowledge that the creator of the series essentially went crazy towards the end of the series and thus the imagery and story towards the end of the series got really wacky. So far, this newer version stays true to the essence of the original story but does it in a less extreme fashion, as well as introduces a new character, adding something new to long time followers of the series.

The animation is without a doubt some of, if not the most beautiful I have seen in an anime. The use of computer animation to enhance the film is done very seamlessly. This is truly a Blu Ray worthy animated film.",1303776000,,690,4.476190476190476

Since its original release there have been attempts, in manga and two previous cinematic releases, to bring alternative versions of the story to its many fans and try to both clarify the deeper meanings of the original and lighten the overall somber tone of the anime.
 This re-imaging manages to do both, while retaning the basic plot certain elements have been changed which make the characters more human and less doom leaden, several sub plots have been ether changed or omited, again it would seem to appeal to both fans, old and new, and a more general audience.

My impression of Evangelion 1.11 is that it is mostly a setup for the future movies. It introduces us to some crucial characters and sets up the main premise of angels battling Evas in an already decimated world. (Do the angels only attack Japan though? ;) ) The movie has some good action and great animation.  Most importantly it left me wanting to see the next installment in the series. As a stand alone movie, Evangelion 1.11 isn't a new favorite, but I have high hopes for the series as a whole and can't wait for Evangelion 2.22 to be delivered!",1302048000,,723,4.519083969465649
3333707,5,B0012V4WSW,"The original Neon Genesis Evangelion series was one of the first anime I ever watched, and it blew my mind! There isn't one dull moment throughout the entire series. The animation is amazing, the action is awesome, the characters are incredibly life-like, and the whole story is pervaded with mystery. Each episode left me wanting more.

Evangelion 1.11 You Are (Not) Alone is a retelling of the first six episodes of the original series, and everything has been improved on. The animation interwoven with CGI is spectacular. The action seems to move with a slightly quicker pace than in the original. The characters from the original are all so great that it's hard to imagine they could be improved, yet this film has succeeded in doing so to some extent. There were a few instances in the original series where characters did or said things that seemed to me to be slightly out of place or character, and it seems the creator of Evangelion, Hideaki Anno, shared this sentiment. In all these instances subtle changes have been made to harmonize the behavior of the characters. Though Evangelion 1.11 doesn't diverge that much from the original series, there are a few new mysterious and very crucial plot twists that promise to turn the world of the original series upside down and inside out in the following films.

All in all, Evangelion 1.11 You Are (Not) Alone is among the best anime ever produced. It's definitely worth checking out.",1302048000,,1442,4.834008097165992
3333708,5,B0012V4WSW,"Neon Genesis Evangelion made its first television appearance in Japan in 1995, and with it followed an abundance of critical acclaim and various films that catapulted it into the pantheons of Japanese animation. The release of Evangelion 1.0 (1.11) only solidified just how important Evangelion is, by redefining and re-visualizing some of the most important scenes between episodes 1 through 6 of the original series, this film knocks it out of the ball park.

Not much can be said about the plot if one has seen the original series, as it is pretty much a copy and paste job; take a couple of angel fights and character dialogue. For those that have not experienced the series before in their life, basically a 14 year old boy by the name of Shinji Ikari is called upon to pilot one of the biological mecha known as Evangelion (Eva) in order to take down the mysterious destructive lifeforms known as Angels. Throughout the film, Shinji searches deep within for the meaning behind his actions and his existence, often breaking down and exploring the psychology of his mind in attempts to unravel what is true to him. Along with a complex set of supporting characters, the film never leaves the audience disinterested.

The film looks absolutely stunning, especially in 1080p; which is one of the main reasons why an Evangelion fan should purchase the blu-ray edition of the film. Every scene in the film has been re-worked from the ground up to give Evangelion the look it was always meant to have.

When it comes to the audio, once again the film excels in respect to any of the older material. Support for Dolby TrueHD 6.1 for both the English and Japanese dub means that everyone will be happy. In terms of dialogue (English dub), the film certainly has less dialogue than the original first six episodes, but that is to be expected with an hour and forty minutes to cover the said episodes. What one gets is a re-dubbing of the original dialogue that makes the character dialogue seem much more natural and clear than in the original dub. The soundtrack remains the same Shirou Sagisu composed tracks that defined most if not all of the prominent scenes in the original series, either enhanced or re-done to sound better than ever.

In conclusion, Evangelion 1.11 is a must buy for any Evangelion fan and newcomer alike. It is a prominent piece of art that continues to define what Anime can be expected to accomplish.",1301961600,,2424,4.750593824228028
3333709,4,B0012V4WSW,"This movie is good but not all that good and didn't had that much action scenes. ""EVANGELION 1.11: You are (not) alone"" on blu ray is a good addition to you collection/library. The story is solid (even though I had no idea what sense the story is trying to say, probably because I didn't watch the original series). The animation is far-by outstanding in High definition. But sometimes, I feel that the main character isn't that well developed until the end of movie. Overall: This is a movie that I recommend to any fan of the original series, Blu ray fan, or anime fan. thats why I'm giving ""EVANGELION 1.11: You are (not) alone"" a B+.

I was wrong however ^_^ Evangelion 1.11 is a breathtaking, beautiful, visually stunning retake of the series and now I'm hooked. I will be getting Evangelion 2.22 and anymore they come out with in the future on blu-ray and for die hard fans I'll say get this blu-ray/ dvd.

3333711,4,B0012V4WSW,"So, when I first watched the first four episodes of Neon Genesis Evangelion, I was pretty impressed with the story, but no so much with the art and animation itself.  After watching You Are (Not) Alone, I cannot say the same thing.  It WAS a little boring to watch the fights between Sachiel and Shamshel -- other than the huge minigun that Shinji used against the latter and the way the progressive knife was deployed, little had changed.  The battle with Ramiel, however, was mind-blowing.  I had to watch Operation Yashima several times to catch all the nuances of Ramiel's new features.  In summation, the story up to Ramiel is pretty much the same, but there are differences in animation techniques, content, and even character behavior (just look at how Shinji acted in the original, and the little changes he's gone through in the Rebuild).  I eagerly await the deployment of You Can (Not) Advance.",1299715200,,905,4.806451612903226
3333712,3,B0012V4WSW,"I am not such a faithful fan of Evangelion, so excuse me if some of the words of my review offend anyone. I can't also consider myself an otaku because I only count with a year of my teens of anime exposure, and Evangelion was something I knew I needed to see but couldn't, until three years ago during a time of changes and depression, when I found it therapeutic (I know, I'm weird). So, anyway, I only had the chance to get to half the total of episodes, but I thought it had great characters, and strong material to be used for a good movie. People told me about the mess with the alternative end and stuff and I thought maybe it was too much, so when word came to me about a rebuild of the series in the form of a movie, I knew I had to watch it.

As I said before, perhaps I'm not the best qualified for a review of this product, but I must say that my expectations for this movie, in fact for the DVD as a whole, were higher.
Yes, it has a nifty package, but I still can't explain the existence of the second disc. Being as recognized as Evangelion is, I hoped to get more info about this release, interviews with creators (perhaps I'm asking much), or the choice of leaving and cutting things from the original episodes.
Instead what we get on Disc 2 are trailers, and trailers, and a ""music video"" that is really a trailer that could have been fan-made.
As for the movie itself, it looks great, but it bothers me that not even here Evangelion could be treated as a cinematic experience. Maybe it's because it is the same director as in the series, but I found myself trying to escape from the reality that it was a rushed summary of the first episodes, with some enhancements. Only in the climax and final fight could I be aloud to feel some atmosphere. I was hoping this movie could make Evangelion something deeper than it was in visually and emotional terms, but somehow... I didn't felt the story as with the episodes. Too much character development was took out, too much frame-by-frame of the episodes remains, and I couldn't see where was the existence of this rebuild justified.
Anyway, it's Evangelion amigos, and if you have more patience for movies than for series (like me), probably this is for you. As for me, I'm planning on giving Evangelion 2.22 a chance to convince me. This 2-disc edition comes with a booklet where it briefly explains the characters and the reason the movie exists. Disc 2 is nonsense. The movie sounds great and looks great. I hope all this project evolves as something great too.",1299456000,4,2527,4.39957264957265
3333713,5,B0012V4WSW,"Holy crap was this a beast of a movie! I had seen some episodes of the anime but I was too young to understand. After watching this, I've begun to understand a bit more (apparently the movies are trying to make things more clear) and I've had an awesome time enjoying the movie itself.  Evangelion 1.11 You Are [Not] Alone has a perfect blend of action, humor, and drama! Not to mention the animation is excellent, everything looks so clear! A definite must for fans of the original series, those who weren't that familiar with the anime series (me) or for anyone who just wants to watch a very good anime.",1299024000,4,606,4.45945945945946
3333714,5,B0012V4WSW,"Though much of this one, as oppose to the next, is pretty much just higher definition shots of the original anime, it is still great to see Evangelion making a comeback. And deservedly so. Many anime are forgotten over the years, but I was glad to watch this, though I'm looking forward to the next even more.

I scratched up the black covering of mind so I'm a little upset about that, but with a booklet, its a great set, though the extras leave much to be desired. The music for the credits is Beautiful World by Utada is gorgeous and fitting for the mood.

There is NO ASUKA in this first one. It covers roughly up to Rei and Shinji's first battle together; their first time really bonding.

For diehard fans, it felt a bit abrupt when they changed from scene to scene because things in the anime (had to be) were cut to fit a movie experience. Still they hit the important parts.

Overall a great product and series. Nothing worth scoffing at.",1298419200,,948,4.4
3333715,4,B0012V4WSW,"Neon Genesis Evangelion is needless to say one of the most controversial anime franchises of ALL TIME as well as one of the most amazing animes of all time. The original series came out in 1995 which composed of 26 episodes which combined great elements of any anime series with a nice blend of action and comedy; however, the series is overall depressing and moody. Those original 26 episodes were classic needless to say however, episodes 25 and 26 were one of the most confusing and complex endings of any anime series. What the Evangelion series is famous for is the connection with religion and human emotions, it is one of the most depressing anime series because it goes deep into the mental state of human emotions and purpose and life. Life and Death is the overall content of the series. The last 2 episodes was confusing and basically one big mind f***. 2 years later the director Hideaki Anno decided to redue the ending and make a whole theatrical movie entitled The End of Evangleion and that ending was much much better, and the overall result was aclaimed and critically accecpted by all viewers. Over a decade later Hideaki Anno decides to revamp the ENTIRE series into a 4-Part movie and create a whole new plot and ending to the series.

This movie is a retelling of the first original 6 episodes of the original series. Alhought the whole Rebuild of Evangelion is a retelling of the original series, this first movie is basically the same exact story from the original series but with new animation and condensed into a 2 hour movie. The overall result is fantastic, the new animation is silky smooth combined with new CGI animations and colorful textures to make the film more modern and tolerable comapared to the 90's adaption. The story in this movie remains the same, a new Eva pilot Shinji Ikari is called upon by his father to pilot the Evangelion and kill off the upcoming angels. Nothings new here except for the new animated sequences. The music is very familiar from the original series and the dialogue has remained basically the same as well. Although the general material has been altered, its just nice to see a more modern Evangelion and really gets you hyped up for the next movies coming in the near future.

This DVD Evangleion 1.11 contains the same material from the original release 1.01 except for an additional second included with a couple of extras. The movie also contains an additional scenes added to the movie, nothing crucially important but it is a nice feature. The second disc contains a the original 1.01 feature film release (minus the added scenes) as well as couple of previews for the next film. The DVD also contains a 20 page booklet with notes and other great stuff on it. The movie is great, but the only reason why I give the film 4 stars is because of the English dub. I was a fan of the original series, and I found the english dub in the original series to be well done and can't imagine any other voice actors to do those characters. However, in the Rebuild series only two voice actors reprise their roles from the original series which are Spike Spencer (Shinkji Ikari) and Allison Keith (Misato Katsuragi). I am very glad at LEAST these two came back but I am a little dissapointed the original english voice actors from the NERV members didn't come back especially the voice for Gendo and Ritsuko. Hopefully the voice for Asuka will come back for the next film, and if she doesn't then I am watching the next film in japanese. This disc is a must buy for me. Great Movie but the special features fall short. I cannot wait till the next movie comes out.",1298332800,2,3624,4.608359133126935
3333716,5,B0012V4WSW,"A lot of people think that this is regular old Evangelion all over again. No, no. This is the foundation for something new and godly. If you watched this and have already seen Eva, you will notice the differences.

(Spoiler!) As we notice, many scenes have been altered, and it even shows that Kaoru, the fifth child, comes from the moon to face Shinji? Hm- and being as he was in contact with Seele, we can tell that this story is going an alternate route. Also! In the preview for 2.22 we see Minami, a character who's never been in Eva before this. So, there's that to consider.
(Spoiler ends!)

Ahem, with that out of the way, we can now move on to the actual product! A lovely and shining slip cover that dons a fold out box- both being covered in amazing artwork. Within that we have 2 DVDs and a booklet. The book is filled with random factoids and whatnot, nothing spectacular. The main DVD is the movie, of course, and the second is all special features. The special features are rather... lackluster? Though, it's nice to just add in stuff for no real extra price.

The main thing to concern yourself with is 1.01. Do not buy that. For about the same price you can have the newer, better looking, and more jam-packed version with a slightly uglier box. Hah. (I prefer the art on the 1.01 box. No matter as I have both.)

The movie is great, same old storytelling as always. A good bit of re-cap if you have already seen Eva, with the added twist of some new story. Eva feels brand new when watching 1.11, to me. Fresh visuals, amazing story and whatnot, action, drama- regardless of how many times I see Eva, it still remains timeless. There are many scenes which have gone complete overhauls where new graphic were added, 3D rendering is utilized and even fresh vocals and amazing sound to boot!

So, to sum it all up; this version looks great (Better than 1.01), sounds amazing, has some extras, is a slightly altered re-telling of some of the Eva story which is in part of a seemingly new plot, and dons a shiny box.",1298246400,2,2029,4.4144385026737964

I'm personally not into anime that much but felt the movie was about decent. I did however get tired of the main character very quickly.

The presentation of the blu-ray is great, a digipak package, it comes also with a good booklet that is indeed worth reading.

The movie is presented here in one of the best transfers i've ever seen for an animation, everything is amazing and full of detail, color balance is also very good, i'd ive 5/5 for this amazing image.

The problem with the edition is really the extras, there's almost nothing for the fans, just a 15 minute slideshow with production evolution of the movie with music, the rest is just trailers and a music video, very disappointing, sometives i feel that the producers held back the extras for another relaese, which is a thing many do and that have been done with Evangelion in the past. Well if they do this after the fourth movie, then i'm ok since will be watching this blu-ray many times.

While this movie encapsulates the original episodes 1-6, you'll see small divergences that really make me wonder whether this is a remake or some kind of sequel.  I'll leave that discussion to otaku forums though.  In short, if you were a fan of the original series, you owe it to yourself to see this.  If you were turned off from evangelion before because of all the Shinji head case stuff...it's still there!  However, I feel it works a lot better in this format and overall comes out a lot more balanced and enjoyable!  Casual anime fans should not miss this movie.  Once you see it, you'll be chomping at the bit for the next ones to come out!

Once again I bought this based on reviewers elsewhere mentioning the similarity to Appleseed, and honestly there is no comparison.  The storyline is boring, really boring, and it was quite a tough watch!  It's like watching a video game of the same repeated mission against 6 or 7 progressively tougher bosses.  The same scene occurs over and over again, with the evildoers mech being just too tough for the latest incarnation of the goody-two-shoes mech, and gets beaten again, and again.

3333725,5,B0012V4WSW,"I recently bought this when I saw that it had a lower price; I'm a fan of the series but I've never really watched it all the way through...I mainly jumped around and watched it where I could. But I understand the main plot and have seen most of it to understand the series as a whole.

This movie is a wonderful addition to any Evangelion fan. The visuals are absolutely stunning with full 1080p support, the run time is approximately 100 minutes and it is definitely worth watching. The story itself follows the original episodes but adds in several scenes that help the story move along better. Like when the first episode in the original TV releases would end and in the next episode Shinji would awake in a hospital room instead the movie continues and shows the fight between EVA 01 and the 4th Angel. The movie covers episodes 1-6 in the TV series. There's some jumping around between the hospital scene and when Shinji goes to school but from what I've watched it simply stream lines the story and keeps it moving forward towards the action. I personally liked the differences between the original and the movie. It helped to better clarify parts such as when you see Lilith the 2nd Angel which is the origin of the human race and this explains why Tokyo 3 is under attack from the Angels to begin with. Also there's scenes that elude to the hidden agenda of Shinji's father and what his plans for Rei and Shinji are, this is also reflected and emphasized in several scenes.

Those are the main differences I saw from my first watch through of the movie itself. And overall I was absolutely blown away by the amazing artwork and quality of the movie itself. If anyone is interested in this product whether a long time fan of the series or someone new to the Evangelion universe I would definitely recommend a buy. And for the price it is this Blu ray DVD is completely worth...let's just say I can wait for Evangelion 2.22.",1294444800,,1931,4.514285714285714
3333726,5,B0012V4WSW,"Let me first put it out there that, of course, I'm a big fan of the original Evangelion series, like millions are. The faithful day I saw a small, Japanese trailer for this was around late 2007. I got extremely excited about it, but totally forget about it because it tended to stay of the U.S. radar for anime. Not only that, but either FUNimation sat on it for so long or had some form of an issue, it took forever to get licensed and dubbed.

I see for some odd reason people seem to think this title was unnecessary, and probably a way to just let some companies make money off of Evangelion's name. I wonder to myself why people seem to think Evangelion 1.11 is gonna just be a stand-alone movie, and have no sequel come off it, and ultimately, not get any further than the original. This is indeed a 4-film tetralogy. The point of this whole project is for it come to fruition like Hideaki Anno first wanted it to, and now he has the chance to make it happen.

I'm just gonna make this a short winded, simple review, now. I got Evangelion 1.01 over Christmas of '09 and I couldn't wait to watch it. I popped it in around mid-January, and I was blown away. Beautiful, crisp animation. While I'm not a fan of CG, they did incorporate it well. Stuck mostly to it's OST, which is grand, because it's wonderful. I gotta say, though, there is NO WAY FUNimation didn't know anything about the darkness issue before releasing it. Were they just trying to make money by re-releasing it as this title? I don't know. Anywho, if you're a loyal fan and you were upset about the direction this movie took, what did you expect? Why stray away from the very roots that made this series what it was AND is? And while I'll agree that the changes in this film were few, they were major. So, if you're expecting to dive head first into this movie expecting every single detail to be different, you'll be dissapointed. All I can say is: this was my movie experience of 2010, and honestly, the best movie I've seen in a long time. While I'm glad the changes in here were minor, we'll see what the 2nd film has in store plot-wise. I recommend this to any Evangelion fan or anime fan in general.

3333731,5,B0012V4WSW,"Brief Review: any Evangelion fan should own this.

Not-so-brief Review: if you're not an Evangelion fan, but a fan of anime in general, this movie will rock your socks off. If you're an Evangelion fan, this has probably been a wet dream at some point in your life. A completely redrawn and reimagined version of the series you already know and love, with enough twists and turns to make it a wholly new and yet familiar experience. The real changes come in Evangelion 2.22, but it seems you'll have to wait a bit for that one.

The Blu-Ray comes with 1080p FullHD image, a 6.1 TruHD and 6.1 Dolby Digital Japanese track and an English track which I haven't tried so I can't really say anything. Sound is superb, animation is one of the best out there and story is... well... Evangelion, so you can expect it to be AWESOME. Package is gorgeous, with an outer cover featuring an original EVA-01 image, and the inner cover is glossy black with an image of Rei on one side and an image of Shinji on the other. It also features a booklet with a sort-of-artbook with a couple of images, but that's just a small bonus.

If you're a fan of the series, this is a dream come true. If you're not, then it's a really good place to start. Evangelion hasn't stayed a cult series for so long because of nothing, trust me.",1287446400,,1306,4.3884297520661155
3333732,5,B0012V4WSW,"If you are over 20, and seen any animations from Japan, go ahead and watch this. Also it would be of much help is you go through the TV series alongside. Gives you quite a few ""a-ha~!"" moments.",1287100800,,193,4.105263157894737

So I'll put it out there plain and simple: If you love Evangelion, this movie is legit, and I've already seen the second one, and it just gets better.  If you're new to Evangelion, this movie might seem slow, but it's worth the build to the second one, which only God knows when the hell it'll come to SlowMerica.",1286668800,,391,4.27027027027027

3333736,5,B0012V4WSW,"I'm a long-time fan of Evangelion; I own both the original DVD run and the Platinum DVDs, and it's one of my favorite anime series of all time.  When the new movies began production, I was completely psyched, and let me tell you,they do not disappoint.  This first movie is a fairly faithful re-telling of the first 7 episodes of the series (everything before Asuka shows up).  There are a few changes in the events, the characters have all undergone subtle personality changes (Shinji isn't as whiny!  Rei isn't as dull!), and a lot of things have undergone design changes.  There is a lot of animation recycled from the series, but it's been gone over and improved, and now looks smooth and gorgeous, especially on blu-ray. They use a lot of CG now, which I am still on the fence about.. I'm a little bit of a 2D purist, but having done some animation, I understand the efficiency of the CG.  Other than polishing it up tremendously, this movie doesn't add much to the experience of the series, but it does set up for the second movie, which is a *huge* departure from the series... I can't wait for *that* on blu-ray!

As for the blu-ray itself, the picture is phenomenal, of course, as well as the sound.  I don't crank up the sound on many of my movies, but in this case I was blasting it. I was also impressed with the special features included. From what I've researched, they included all of the special features that were included in the Japanese DVD release.  The disc also comes with a small program booklet with character and setting information, like the kind they give out at Japanese movie premieres.  I thought that was very cool, because the only other way to get those programs is to try and nab one on an auction site, and then they're expensive and un-translated. The translation of the movie itself is also very good, although I can't speak for the dub as I've only viewed it in Japanese with English subtitles.  Funimation isn't always known for its stellar translations (they actually list their translations as ""reversioning"" in the majority of their releases), but this one is, thankfully, up-to-par with the ADV and Manga Evangelion releases.

These new Evangelion movies were meant to be a way to introduce the series to a new generation of viewers, and they can stand very well on their own, especially with this first movie as a foundation.  But they are also extremely enjoyable for us die-hard fans of the series, adding a new dimension and yet another interpretation of the events leading up to the Third Impact.",1284336000,,2544,4.651785714285714

3333738,4,B0012V4WSW,"I love anime, but I'm sketchy on the world of Mecha anime. I've never really liked it, since I thought it was giant robots and junk like that. But I was pleasantly surprised when my boyfriend asked me to order this for him so we could watch it together. I realized quickly that Evangelion wasn't just about a giant robot (and actually, I don't think the Evangelion suits are robots...), it was a personal story about this boy who is put into an extraordinary situation and expected to ""man up"" and be a hero, when he feels like everything but a hero. This re-version of Evangelion is beautifully atmospheric and has texture to it. I can't wait to see the other parts to this series. If you are like I was, close-minded to Mecha, then this is a good anime to watch to get yourself acquainted to it...and maybe even enjoy it.",1281312000,3,823,4.421052631578948

3333740,1,B0012V4WSW,"This review is from someone who knows nothing about the series and has never seen it.

Yes, the movie is visually stunning and that's where it stops.

I enjoy anime and every now and then purchase something new I have never heard of, in hopes to find a great new series.  Well this isn't it.  This movie is purely for people that are long time fans and have watched the entire series.

First off, I thought it was a stand alone movie.  Apparently I was wrong and this is merely an introduction.  An introduction filled with NO back history, annoying characters and plot holes.  There are these things called Angles and they are attacking the Earth.  You don't know why they are attacking, what they are exactly, where they came from or anything!  Then the ""hero"" of the series is a whiny 14yr old boy who pilots a giant ""cyborg"" type robot.  Do we know anything about the boy?  Why he was selected to pilot, how he had the ability to pilot without ever training or ANYTHING besides the fact that he cries the entire movie.....NOPE.  Plus there is no need for the nudity.  Its not that it ""bothers"" me, it just seems completely irrelevant and out of place.  Not to mention it usually occurs between a brother and sister, that are 14yrs old.  Does anyone else get the feeling that this is the culmination of some perverts fantasy?  14yr old incest....yeah I think I'll pass.

After watching this and now knowing its an introduction, I still have no interest in watching the series.  I'm just going to go over to Wikipedia and read up on it to fill in all the plot gaps.

However, if you find a 14yr old whiny character, who want to bone his sister, cry about piloting a giant robot and suffers from neglect and daddy issues then this is YOUR movie.",1280620800,10,1746,4.44794952681388

3333744,4,B0012V4WSW,"Evangelion 1.11 is an updated, movie version of the series first six episodes. While the animation is much better, and the new CG fits in perfectly, you're not going to find much here that's new as far as the plot goes. The little bit it does add, though, is a great set up for the next three movies, which are completely different from the rest of the series.

I've found that this serves as a good introduction to the series, and in fact you could almost watch this, ignore the very very last part (as it's basically MASSIVE spoilers for the original series), and then continue the series from episode 7. However, by doing this you would miss out on a lot of the more subtle parts of the first six episodes that couldn't be fit into a movie, as well as a lot of character development. To each his own, though.

I would definitely recommend watching the original series first before watching the movie; this merely serves as the set-up to something greater with the next three movies.",1278460800,2,985,4.4972067039106145

I don't even own a single soundtrack compilation. But, I will say that I am an artist, and an animation student at the moment, and that I have basically purchased the entire series twice before (starting on my third time with 1.11, huh?). I have both the ""Perfect Collection"" DVD boxset, and the ""Platinum Collection"", as well as for ""Death of Evangelion."" During the years that I've owned these, I have watched the series from start to finish at least 20 times (I was going to say 200, but that wouldn't be too realistic!) and have basically taken in as much as I could possibly have taken in from it.

With all of that said, I feel that 1.11 is nothing short of Amazing! The improvements made to the art and animation are many and noticeable (Not like a certain other anime I know that's getting similar treatment. I'm looking at you, DBZ!) and I don't believe you need the eye of an artist to notice.

3333757,3,B0012V4WSW,"Evangelion 1.11 is without a doubt the best looking anime yet released on blu-ray.  In the box is one 50gb blu-ray disc with the main feature (with dual audio tracks for English and Japanese of course), and several special features.  Included is a booklet detailing the impetus behind the ""rebuild"" project, which also details a few scene by scene comparisons (original to rebuild) and character profiles.  The main feature is, for me, the main attraction, and funimation doesn't disappoint.  Eva looks great.  In fact it's never looked better, the team behind rebuild (no longer Gainax for those who want to know), have gone back to the drawing board, literally, to recreate the show in a 16:9 theatrical format.  Original key animation was used as a jumping off point for the entire project, which means that while there are many shots that look identical to the original series, there is not in fact any reused material.  The end result is a pristine picture that is free from the blemishes that plagued the older Evangelion dvds you may have seen. In short, this is the best looking Evangelion available.

The story itself though, that's a different matter.  To those people who haven't watched Evangelion, and just plain don't get what all the fuss is about; welcome!  Evangelion 1.11 you are (not) alone is a wonderful place for you to start.  To diehard fans of the series I say this; this is not the Evangelion you remember.  While all the major events in the first 6 episodes are presented here in the first entry of rebuild, the pace is decidedly faster than the original series.  This is probably rebuild's biggest asset and greatest liability at the same time.  New fans will probably appreciate the snappy pace of the series, but if you're like me you might find the pace somewhat jarring.  The original series was very ... deliberate in its pacing.  While I appreciate the fact that Shinji's decision to pilot the Eva came so quickly this go 'round, I miss the flashback sequence detailing his first confrontation with an angel.  Originally the viewer is kept in the dark about what happened, in the middle of the first battle Shinji awakens in a hospital in the episode titled ""unfamiliar ceiling"".  A good deal of time goes by before it's revealed exactly what happened with unit 01 and the fourth angel, and the audience reacts with the same shock that Shinji experiences when he begins to remember the outcome of the battle.  That moment of revelation is both more powerful and more subtle because it's more removed, in terms of time, from the event.  This is the sort of thing that happens throughout the entire disc.  Like I said earlier, all the big moments are there, but to me they seem rushed.  A lot of the subtlety of the series seems to be getting swept under the rug for the sake of brevity.  I still like rebuild 1.11, but I don't yet love it.  It's going to be difficult for the rebuild to dislodge my love of the original series, warts and all.",1272499200,52,2975,4.687861271676301

But what makes this movie different from other crappy movie remakes? Why remake Neon Genesis Evangelion when it's already perfect the way it is (ignore eps. 25-26). To be honest, I can't give a good reason why I love this remake movie of the franchise but I can easily say that it is DAMN IMPRESSIVE! Probably the best 30 bucks I spent on a blue ray disk. ALMOST everything is PERFECT about this new version of Eva. The art is perfect, that voice acting is perfect, the plot, even the music kicks ass. Basically this and the other 3 movies coming out is a remake of the whole tv series (and supposedly a remake ending of The End of Evangelion film as well) but without all the plot fillers in it. I highly recomend it to anyone but I Will have to warn you to watch the original tv series before watching this movie. And for good reasons

SPOILER ALERTS!!!!!!!!!!!!

1. Many symbols are changed in nerv. Instead of a leaf it's an apple. Probably a symbol for ""adam's"" apple. And you don't see Nerv's higher command face to face like in the show at the begining. They start off with the weird obilisks things.

2. Misato is very aware of lilith's location at Nerv HQ. She even shows it to Shinji.

3. Kawrou makes an appearance at the end, and I'm guessing there is a space station on the moon with supposedly another Lillith creature.

4. At the ending credits, Mari the newest Evangelion character ever made is briefly shown. Making her first appearance in Eva 2.0 movie.

I love this movie. I can talk about this thing for hours on end. If you love Eva, THEN BUY IT! NO REGRETS!!!!!!!",1272240000,,1733,4.451104100946372
3333759,5,B0012V4WSW,"When I was younger I had just begun to explore anime, and I remember a friend of mine telling me, ""Whatever else you may watch, you MUST see Neon Genesis Evangelion"". And he was right, it really was (and is) a must-see series. as many other reviewers have stated, it explores large scale concepts that you usually don't see too much in any kind of series, anime or not. In the original 26-part series, I was captivated by the basic story and exciting visuals/music, but more than that the ideas really hooked me and stuck with me. With the framework of giant robot battles, there is a wealth of symbolism and especially parallelism - between Shinji and Rei, between the Evas and Angels, between NERV and the city, you name it. Death and rebirth, even the purpose of life and death, are issues central to the story. The plot ostensibly is about giant killing machines, called Angels, that attack Japan, and about a boy named Shinji who arrives to pilot one of the counterweapons, EVAs, created by his father. However Shinji's journey is much more complicated then it first appears and what he expects it to be; he remains an angst-driven, reluctant and petulant hero but learns a great deal about the nature of humanity along the way.

I'm glad to report that the Rebuild of Evangelion retains much of the power, structure and philosophical impact of the original series while souping it up visually and aurally like never before. This updated version of the first of four films, title ""You Are (Not) Alone"", is absolutely fantastic and rectifies some of the previous lighting issues in the first release. The image quality and clarity is absolutely stunning, definitely a reference-level movie. The 4th Angel attack alone is mind-blowing, with it morphing into all sorts of digital wonderments with a glassy, reflective look - all the while blowing stuff up like crazy. Shinji's training sequence and all of the Eva arming/dispatch sequences along with the attacks really shine in the rebuild. And the quality of the lighting is amazing in scene after scene, whether it be liquid blood drops splattering everywhere or an almost angelic, soft palette as Shinji and Rei try to connect. All the digital effects look almost photorealistic in 1080p, and the blending with the traditional art look and style is seamless. In terms of story there is pretty much every key moment re-conceptualized in some form so if you aren't familiar with the series then you really aren't missing too much information. While I do advise finding the original first, this release is strongly recommended and I for one cannot wait for the rest to come over stateside. If only they had retained the original theme song or referenced it somewhere!",1271980800,,2720,4.862068965517241

If you are new to Evangelion:

I suggest watching the original series first (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Neon-Genesis-Evangelion-Platinum-Perfect-Collection/dp/B000VLL0O8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Neon Genesis Evangelion Platinum: Perfect Collection</a>), substituting ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Neon-Genesis-Evangelion-The-End-Of-Evangelion/dp/B000068OJ1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Neon Genesis Evangelion - The End Of Evangelion</a>"" for the final two episodes. Evangelion 1.11 is essentially taking the first 6 episodes of NGE (150+ minutes of storytelling) and fitting it into slightly over an hour and a half. To the new viewer, the story in Evangelion 1.11 may seem rushed. To me it seems to focus more on how bad-ass it is when giant, bio-engineered cyborg/beings fight against giant, celestial beings whilst smashing to pieces the surrounding cityscape ... because it is really, really cool.

If you are already an Evangelion fan:

Why haven't you already bought this!? Even though this focuses more on action, there are several spots (plot-wise) where I like what is done in Evangelion 1:11 more than the series. There are even a couple of 'a-ha!' moments as well. The story is pretty faithful to the first 6 episodes of the series with the exception of the end (no spoilers!) when we are left believing the story will start varying more from the original. For the English dub, the voices of Misato and Shinji seem exactly the same; Rei sounds the same except not quite as 'whispery' and sad; Ritsuko is slightly different but familiar; Gendo is completely different. Gendo's ""new voice"" is a lot less cold. I almost feel like it makes his character a little more complex because he doesn't come across as such a complete ass*. That being said... I kinda miss the ""old voice"". Kensuke and Toji sound different as well. As far as visual presentation goes, Evangelion 1.11 is an ocular orgasm. I had this cheesy otaku grin on my face the whole way through - you know the one I'm talking about! Maybe some slight drooling as well. Eh, let's face it; the drooling started as soon as I picked this up at the store. My girlfriend can attest to this since she had to drive home from the mall so I could flip through the included booklet. Speaking of the booklet, special features are plentiful, though not completely amazing. The packaging is pretty damn cool, however... Oooo, shiny!

For those who are new to this series, its best if you start off with the t.v. series because you will be lost trying to understand this one.  This is meant for the fans that know whats going on with the whole angels, eve, son of adam and so fourth.  A lot of the scenes were cut in order to squeeze in the important parts of the show.  For example, they focused on the main characters and their personalities rather than his classmates or co-workers at nerv who all have a little backround of their own, but you won't see that in 1.11.  Other than that lets get to the good stuff.  This movie puts 4 or 5 episodes into one so far.  The whole thing is redrawn with extended and new scenes added and extra features for the angels as well as the eva's.  The eva's now have a new disturbing roar when going berserk, and the angels have halos over them now (just some cool little features if you observe closely).  1.11 is the way to go, the difference with 1.0 is like night and day.  1.0 is poorly converted to dvd quality, the scene when shinji first pilot his eva is so dark all you can see is the green glowing from the eva and thats the first fight scene.  1.11 fixed that right up, its crisp and clear in the blu ray, I haven't seen the dvd version of 1.11 but im sure its the same.  Fans of Evangelion need to pick this one up wether for you collection or to refresh your memory either way you won't be disappointed.  Just remember this is a movie series.

3333767,5,B0012V4WSW,"The movie: 4.5/5
Basically this is the first in a series of theatrical adaptations of the original Evangelion anime TV series. Some of the filler content of the TV series was trimmed off and the pacing was adapted to a theatrical release. For newcomers as well as Evangelion fans, this is a must-watch anime: newcomers won't have any trouble following the story due to the strong rewriting and newcomers will find the pacing fresh and not too slow but also not too fast.

Video quality: 5/5
Simply put, I was unable to discern any flaw in this beautiful transfer. Even banding, the enemy of every animated feature, is absent. Colors are spot-on, detail is clear and crisp, and the animation of the original series was completely reworked for this theatrical release. The Blu-ray is a faithful reproduction of what was shown in theaters.

Audio quality: 5/5
Simply stunning. This disc sports a powerful Japanese TrueHD 5.1 track that envelops you into a realistic listening area. Sound effects are clear and precise and dialog is well-balanced and clearly audible.
Moreover, it's a very, VERY welcome change to for once be able to listen to the original language track in high quality on a US released anime feature. Funimation, take note!

Extras: 2/5
Not a whole lot of extras but what is on the discs discusses how the team brought the original animation of the Evangelion TV series anime to the big screen and it shows clearly that a lot of love and work went into making this feature.

Overall: 4.5/5
Anime fans, fans of Evangelion and purists like me who like quality audio on the original language should add this to their basket post haste. The production values are astonishing for an anime feature and I was unable to detect any technical faults on this disc's transfer. The story was nicely condensed, trimming out superfluous material to leave only the core story and it's moving along at a steady pace. This one ranks at the top of my anime Blu-ray list as far as US releases are concerned! Media companies like Funimation who churn out series after series with mediocre quality (most of the time) and little to no regard for the original language track should take a few lessons from Bandai Visual. Don't let the rather high price tag scare you away ... this one is worth it!",1270598400,,2288,4.741206030150754

Some of the original voice cast is back (Shinji, Misato, word is out on Asuka since she's not in this one) and the replacements are all quite good, they just take a little getting used to (Kensuke and Gendo in particular).

Anyway, if you're a fan of Eva, buy this. Buy this now. Don't bother with rebuild 1.01, it's on disc 2 of 1.11. Enjoy the high definition defeat of the first three angels and ponder at the changes to Tokyo 3.",1270080000,3,610,4.398230088495575

Evangelion 1.11 is the final version of the first film in what looks to be 4 films covering the entirety of the original ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" anime.

It's a great film that will entertain anyone who has enjoyed anime in the past. You *don't* need to be a mecha fan to enjoy this stuff because it has a much broader storyline than that.. at least from what I can tell.

Thats the only flaw of this film.. lack of solid story. It's hard to say its a particularly bad point because theres no doubt we'll be filled in with ""Evangelion 2.22"", the preview for it at the end of the film indicates plenty of things will happen - whereas Evangelion 1.11 just gets you started, introduces the characters, the base concepts and situation of the story. It's extremely hard to tell how much plot there is behind it.. but I can say I'll be pre-ordering Evangelion 2.22 as soon as it becomes available because at the end of this film you're left wanting more. A lot more.

The animation is fantastic, flawless on this BluRay. Audio is also brilliant (I watched with the original Japanese audio) and subtitles are clear - much nicer than subtitles ever were on DVD.

I think my mouth was agape from start to finish.  I was excited when I heard about the Evangelion rebuild project and was pleased with what they managed to accomplish with 1.01 but after seeing 1.11, you will either a) immediately sell or b) never ever watch the 1.01 version again.

STUNNNING, absolutely STUNNING bluray visuals, sound and possibly even beter than those two points, the build and edit of 1.11 is far superior to that of 1.01 and as a result the viewer is compltely sucked in and enthralled throughout the entire motion picture experience and as exagerrated as some of this review may seem it is hard to fuly express how solid of a movie Evangelion 1.11 is without gushing... some. ;)

Regarded as one of the more notable franchises in anime, Neon Genesis Evangelion is something of an oddity. It's essentially a shounen (as in geared towards a young demographic, check Wikipedia for a more thorough definition) and mecha (giant robot) series, but at the same time possesses a plethora of other complexities: Freudian psychoanalysis, a heck of a lotta' melodrama, fan service (again, check Wiki if you're unfamiliar with the term), allusions to Christianity, bits of comedy, and a lot of convoluted plot twists. And with that said, it can be difficult to stomach for those who don't know the series or just aren't used to the over-exaggerated nature of anime in general. Evangelion 1.11 is basically part 1 of a quadrilogy that's a ""rebuild"" of the series that initially aired in 1995. It took the original story (in this case, condensing the first 6 episodes) and key animation, made a bunch of tweaks with cleanup and CG, and ultimately gave us this first chunk of the overall revision. From my own experience with the series (albeit 7 or 8 years ago), I actually enjoyed it quite a bit. Having spent such a long hiatus from this franchise and from anime in general the last couple of years it was a pleasant surprise for me to rediscover part of what made anime so enjoyable in the first place (being all those complexities I mentioned above), not to mention comparing the astounding amount of new art and animation quality to my old DVDs of the series. The only drawback I would say 1.11 has, though, is a lack of character development, which I believe will make it extremely difficult for newcomers to understand, at least until all 4 movies can be viewed consecutively. But aside from that, the pacing is much, much faster with a good majority of it being in the Eva battles, and beautifully animated to boot.

Video - 5.0

Presented by FUNimation using the MPEG-4 AVC codec at an original aspect of 1.85:1 (framed at 1.78), I'm glad to see FUNi finally jumped off their recent trend of upscaling all their anime and actually getting their hands on an HD master. Evangelion 1.11 looks absolutely stunning, not just in comparison to its serial counterpart, but as a standalone piece of animation. The cleanup effort they made on the original art and new integration of CG and cel animation meld together perfectly. Colors are rich and vibrant from the cityscape of Tokyo-3 and its green mountains to the inside of NERV headquarters and all the black murkiness that accompanies one of the underlying themes of the franchise. Line detail never looked sharper, giving a great amount of dimensionality to the characters, Evas, Angels, and backgrounds. Contrast is also never too bright, resulting in a very pleasing look to the overall picture. There may have been just a tiny bit of color banding on a few quick scenes, but I'm just too happy they got off their butts and actually made a real transfer with a real HD master in the first place. Fans of the series will be pleased.

Audio - 5.0

Also of great notoriety is the fact of FUNi adding a lossless Japanese track to their package, breaking the other recent trend of lossless dub / lossy JP presentations. The TrueHD 6.1 track sounds fantastic with lots of separation and immersion from the front, side, and rear speakers. I have a 7.1 setup, but was amazed at the clarity and directionality of the com announcements during the action sequences. You'd literally see the person on-screen talking, and then hear someone else in the back corner of your room, and then another person on the opposite side, and then hear several other voices simultaneously. Side surrounds get a good workout as well, even in the most subtle of moments like traveling down an elevator, hearing a railway train pass by, or the infamous sound of summer cicadas. LFE output is also very potent, though never too overwhelming, and compliments the action very nicely. The only thing that may detract viewers is the ""tinny-ness"" of the voice acting. When things get dead quiet, it tends to reveal that digital ringing or whatever that results from recorded voicing, but it's only a problem if the volume's too high (like I had mine...). Dialogue and music are also very well-channeled through their respective speakers and suffer no levels of dropout or distortion. This is reference material if you ever want to showcase anime.

Extras - 3.0

1.11 comes with a graphics progression bit, a bunch of theatrical trailers for the movie, and a bunch of other trailers for FUNi's upcoming releases. None of these are too great, aside from the Darker Than Black trailer, which I really hope will get just treatment for its eventual BD release. But what really got me was the little booklet that came with the movie. Not only does it textually fill in the gaps of the graphics progression feature, it also explains a lot of the general terminology used in the animation process and gives a little insight on how and why they did so. If anything, I'm just severely disappointed that there weren't any interviews with the creators and producers explaining the changes they made or their intentions with doing this rebuild in the first place. Perhaps they'll include them in spurts on future releases of the other movies?

Overall 4.5

As much acclaim as the Evangelion franchise has received or as much hype people have given it in the last 15 years, it's probably safe to say it still remains a title of much [whatever] you wanna' push on it. Fans who know and applaud all the subtleties and complexities of the series will enjoy this a great deal, if not for a second round of storytelling, then at least for the rebuild effort in the overall art and animation quality. FUNimation presents Evangelion 1.11 with an admirable effort (finally) giving consumers an actual HD experience in both video and audio quality. While the extras are a bit sparse, don't let that stop you from at least checking this out. If you're not really into anime or don't know the series too well, then you may want to just give it a rent until all 4 films are available to watch at the same time. Highly recommended for fans, though.",1268956800,,6161,4.7504672897196265

If there was any negative complaints about the film, it is that some of the humor that the early part of Neon Genesis Evangelion was omitted, and it jumped into the psychological drama early on.  I was relieved that a few of the humorous scenes of the original series was kept (Shinji's first night at Misato's apartment and his meeting with Pen Pen).

3333779,5,B0012V4WSW,"Well after all this time, Evangelion 1.11 came out last Tuesday. I have been waiting for this movie ever since October when I first discovered it and then I found out that the November Evangelion 1.01 release was a bad dvd release with problems, so I had to wait until Evangelion 1.11 came out so I waited about 5 months for this movie. During that time however I watched the whole original Neon Genesis Evangelion series, all the way till the end of End of Evangelion. I will not give anything away at the end but the ending to the Original Series was not what I hoped for but I was glad that Anno made End of Evangelion instead of leaving it to the even worse ending that the original TV series left off at.

  Ok, now moving back to Evangelion 1.11 release. Well I was so excited about this release that I pre-ordered my blu-ray copy in January and I received it this Wednesday and just watched it today which is Saturday. After watching it I was glad. This movie met with my expectations and was a faithful remake and it was just as I expected. It did not exceed my expectations because I knew what was coming from the movie and I did not see how they would be able to make the first 6 episodes of Neon Genesis Evangelion any more interesting because this movie was meant to introduce the characters so I knew they would not change anything major from the start. So the story is about the same as the original TV series except that they cut out what was unnecessary to the main plot like all of Shinji's classmates knowing that he was an Eva pilot or when Shinji camped out with Kensuke when he was returning home after he was trying to run away. So the story is very faithful to the first 6 episodes

  The animation is wonderful and looks really clean and the CG is the best that I have ever seen in an animated movie, especially the Evas and Angels look a lot better than they did in the original anime series. I played this movie off my Playstation 3 and I was watching it through my 13 year old TV that only projects movies and games in 480i but it still looked really good and in the future when I get an HDTV, it will probably look way better. The dub is really great too but I cannot comment on the audio yet because I do not have a stereo system and that one of the speakers on my TV is dead so I had to put my TV volume high while listening to the movie in mono.

  The only thing that I have to complain about this blu-ray is the packaging. I am not saying the packaging looks bad however, I actually really liked how the packaging looks, it is just physical how the case was. The case is pure cardboard and I though it would have a blu-ray case like all of my other blu-rays but everything about the case is made out of cardboard so that is my only complaint.

  So it is a good movie for Neon Genesis Evangelion fans like myself, but for people who did not watch the original anime may think there was not enough action in it and that it was too short. Well just wait until the other 3 movies to come out because this movie is not like Final Fantasy 7 Advent of Children, because it is rebuilding a story that actually makes sense instead of pointless action sequences. So this is a must have for Neon Genesis Evangelion fans and people new to the series, just watch this movie and wait for the rest because this is just an introduction to an epic story, just like the first Lord of the Rings movie.",1268438400,,3416,4.198473282442748

3333783,5,B0012V4WSW,"In 2006, Japanese fans and anime fans of ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" received exciting news that in the Summer of 2007, the first of four Evangelion films based on the anime television series would be released in theaters.  According to news reports, Evangelion creator Hideaki Anno watched the series from beginning to end and wanted to fix up a lot of questions and debates that fans had over the television series and most importantly, incorporate today's new CG technology for the film versions.  Even furthering the excitement is that the original crew and cast have signed on to work on the new film.

So, with mass promotion in Japan, ""Evangelion 1.01 - You Are (Not) Alone"" became the #1 film in Japan making over $14.6 million (US), surpassing ""The End of Evangelion"" which brought in $14.5 million (US).  A limited edition DVD was released in Japan in 2008 which came with a script, music videos and an ""Explanation of Evangelion"" feature and needless to say, fans paid dearly for this limited edition DVD release (only 300,000 were made).  A Blu-ray and DVD release titled ""Evangelion 1.11' which included a re-transfer of the film plus three additional minutes was released in May 2009 and is currently the best selling Blu-ray release in Japan and now the Blu-ray and DVD release of ""Evangelion 1.11 - You Are (Not) Alone"" has been released in the US.

With many Americans waiting for ""Evangelion 1.11' Blu-ray release, suffice to say, the film was released with a very short run at limited theaters and made over $100,000 and was screened at the anime convention Anime Expo in 2009 with great fanfare.

""Evangelion: 1.11 - You Are (Not) Alone"" is a film that takes the first six episodes of the TV series and features new animation and CG and a few different storyline details of certain characters but for the most part, creator Hideaki Anno made sure the film was faithful to the anime series.  The major difference between ""Evangelion 1.01' and ""Evangelion 1.11' is that the latter includes three minutes of extra footage (spread out during the first 15 minutes of the film) and scenes that were darker can now be seen much better.  Also, the Blu-ray edition boasts video and audio in HD and also comes with special features which 1.01 on DVD was barebones.

VIDEO:

""Evangelion 1.11 - You Are (Not) Alone"" is featured in 1080p High Definition.  I had the opportunity to compare the Blu-ray to the 1.01 DVD release from FUNimation Entertainment from last fall and I can tell you right now that this Blu-ray looks fantastic.  Detail is much more apparent and the vibrancy of the colors of the film literally pop onscreen.  The CG animation is top notch and overall, Gainax definitely went all out in creating a fantastic anime full of detail, vibrant colors and staying faithful to the anime series but making sure everything is updated and looks amazing.

The DVD looks good but the main difference was that 1.01 was taken from a 35mm film transfer while the Blu-ray release was taken from the original High Definition digital file.  Not to say that the two look like night and day but there is a significant difference in terms of how vibrant and sharper the animation looks on Blu-ray.  ""Evangelion 1.11 - You Are (Not) Alone"" looks absolutely beautiful!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

As for audio, I know how I was appreciative of the Dolby Digital 5.1 for  ""Evangelion 1.01 - You Are (Not) Alone"" but for ""Evangelion 1.11 - You Are (Not) Alone"", you get a Dolby TrueHD 6.1 English and Japanese lossless soundtrack and there are MAJOR differences between the lossless soundtrack and its DVD counterpart.  On lossless, there is good use of the various channels for this film.  From hearing the music and main character vocal coming from the center and front channels, you will then hear the loudspeakers through the surround channels and then the rear surround channels carry audio that is different.  For example, in one scene in which Shinji is asking out of his mecha, you hear the main characters and vocals through the center and front channels, loud speakers and musical instruments on the surround and on the rear surround channel, you hear Shinji screaming in agony behind you.

There is a huge difference between the lossless audio track and the Dolby Digital 5.1 track from the DVD.  Personally, the lossless audio is just phenomenal, how it is so immersive and envelops the soundscape from all directions was fantastic.  And I am so happy to find out that the Japanese audio track is lossless as well. Something that fans have wanted from anime on Blu-ray!

As for the dubbing, personally, I have never listened to the original ADV Films English dubs, so I can't comment on how the newer voice dubs are with the original but from what I hear from friends and have read, fans were more than grateful for the English voice dubbing for ""Evangelion 1.01'.  As for the Japanese voice acting, I've always felt the voice acting was solid.  Both tracks are similar for the most part in terms of audio featured on a certain channel but I did notice that the Japanese lossless track took advantage of the space.  For example, in the beginning you will see Shinji, his father and the scientist in a large open space.  In the Japanese lossless audio track, the sense of emptiness in that area and the echoing can be heard quite well on the lossless Japanese audio track.  But I also feel that the English dub was a slight more louder than its Japanese counterpart.  So overall, both lossless audio soundtracks are well-done.

As for subtitles, the subtitles on the Blu-ray are in English only.

""Evangelion: 1.11 - You Are (Not) Alone"" contains the following special features:

JUDGMENT CALL:

When I first heard that the rebuild of ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" would take place and that these new films would be based on the television series, I wasn't so surprised because the series is so popular that it would definitely generate an extreme amount of money for GAINAX.  But one thing that I was not looking forward and what drove me crazy about the TV series was the character of Shinji Ikari.  Back in the mid-90's, I can easily remember how his whining really tested my patience and looking back, he was such an anti-hero, mainly because he was ""emo"" most of the time.  Always negative, always in a bit of depression and funk as he always felt people didn't care about him (and yes, I know that Hideaki Anno was clinically depressed when he was creating this film and parts of show was based on his depression) but it did get on my nerves at the time.

But here we are nearly 15 years later and watching ""Evangelion 1.11 - You Are (Not) Alone"" and after it was all done, I was excited and hoping the second film would come out stateside very soon.  Yes, Shinji still whines and is still depressed but the fact is the film is structured a bit differently from the anime TV series and somehow, the pacing is much easier to take for the viewer with the film version and felt that the screenplay for the first film, the quality of the animation and artistic backgrounds and the music all worked together fantastically.

In a way, some part of me wants to rewatch first six episodes of the television series to find out the key differences (it's been 14 years and I can't recall too much from the television series except certain key scenes and the final episodes) were but personally, I found myself happy and content with this film that I look forward to seeing how Anno and the GAINAX crew tweak the next three films (and I can't wait until the final film).  But for the most part, I felt that the film, the voice acting, the animation, the art and everything else about the film was well done and fantastic.

As for the Blu-ray release, this release was just fantastic.  I felt the Eva 1.01 DVD release was good but after watching this Blu-ray release, ""Evangelion: 1.11 - You Are (Not) Alone"" is just fantastic and just an overall exciting release.  Fantastic picture quality, as well as phenomenal lossless Japanese audio.

As for the PG-13 rating, yes, ""Evangelion 1.11' has its share of violence and nudity, so this is not a series that you want to have your little kids around watching at all.  But overall, in the end, it was great to see Evangelion again but this time with the much improved reboot.  Nearly 15-years-later, it was definitely great to see Evangelion again but this time in a film sporting newer animation, CG, artwork and a solid screenplay and soundtrack.  But most importantly,  done in the way that the director Hideaki Anno had wanted but also what the fans have wanted as well.  And after I watched the film,  I can tell you that I loved it! The action, the drama is still intact.  Things may be a little different but still, fans of the original series will definitely enjoy this film release.

""Evangelion: 1.11 - You Are (Not) Alone"" is in the top 3 for best anime release on Blu-ray.  This release is absolutely fantastic and I definitely recommend this film in HD!",1268179200,72,9731,4.710401891252955
3333784,1,B0012V4WSW,"This is nothing more than a repackaging of Evangelion: 1.01 made to look like the next in the series. While this version is special edition of 1.01 and has features that 1.01 didn't. Every part of the dressing of this version is meant to imply that it is the next chapter.

  If special editions are your thing, then this is a good series to collect special editions of. They did a great job of remaking Evangelion, but that fact can be enjoyed by watching Evangelion 1.01 if you already have that version.

This is just a warning because the dressing on this set is very deceptive.",1268092800,9,582,4.462264150943396

8247954,4,B0012V4WSW,"So you're new to Evangelion, or even anime? Unaure what order to watch things? While the TV series, Neon Genesis, is a classic and one of my favorite shows, it can be slow just to draw out the episodes at some points. And it also looks very dated, especially on the ""perfect"" DVD set. 1.11 is essentially episodes 1-6 with updated animation and great pacing. In the time it would take to watch one episode, you'll already be hooked after finishing watching the first action scene.

After that, I'd recommend watching Neon Genesis episodes 7-24, then End of Evangelion. When you're done, THEN watch 2.22 and 3.33, which break off from Neon genesis continuity.

Have fun and get ready for the fourth movie!",1510272000,9,704,4.715447154471545
