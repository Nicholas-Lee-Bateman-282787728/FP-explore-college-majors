8674045,3,B00MQLQLO0,"Good movies but only ""Act Of Valor"" & ""Machine Gun Preacher"" are action movies. The other two are thriller movies. I don't know why they put thriller movies on a item that was supposed to have four action movies. But instead it has two action movies and two thriller movies. If they wanted all four of these movies to be on this, why didn't they name the product ""2 Action Film Favorites and 2 Thriller Film Favorites"", or ""4 Film Favorites""? They name products like this "" 4 Film Favorites"".",1437868800,3,492,4.477777777777778
