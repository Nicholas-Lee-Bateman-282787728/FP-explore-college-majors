2303141,5,B0009NZ2W4,"In My opinion, fourth season is by far the best season yet.  The characters have never been so real.  Anyone who ever had a troubled relationship with family/lovers can rely on this show. Because it feels so real, I think that makes of SFU, one of the best TV shows ever made.  This is strong, funny, sad, full of hopes, full of despair, just like life is...

Too bad it's almost over for the Fisher family.  Without givin' away plots for those who haven't watched it yet, all I can say about my favourite episodes is that...

""Falling Into Pieces"" almost made me cry. Peter Krause has never been better!

""That's My Dog"" proves that Michael C. Hall is really an amazing actor and the plot is so twisted I could not believe I was actually watching a SFU episode.

""The Dare"" is one of the most ""relationship-based"" episode and has a really fine storyline with almost every couple running on a very thin line...

""Untitled"" has the nicest and most shoking twist of the season. Also kind of let you think that it's time for Claire to get herself together.

Arrrf... Now we just have to wait...

Unfortunatly: ""Everything. Everyone. Everywhere. Ends.""  :'-(",1116374400,40,1154,4.602941176470588
2303142,5,B0009NZ2W4,"Just when you thought this series couldn't get better...it does!

This is one of the few TV series that I quite happily watch over & over again.

Series 4 develops each of the complex, engaging & believable characters with some amazing twists & turns along the way. Episodes 44, ""That's my dog"", & 51, ""Untitled"" spring to mind as being particularly amazing/devastating.

If you haven't come across ""Six Feet Under"" before (Is that possible?!!), start watching it from the beginning of the 1st series...you'll be addicted, like me, before you know it!

Roll on August 23, 2005! This DVD box set will definitely be added to my collection.

Waiting patiently, here in Australia, for Series 5 (sob!) the last one!",1116201600,12,710,4.883333333333334

2303150,1,B0009NZ2W4,Writing got real weak after third season.  There is boring redundant sex scenes that I fast forwarded here.  The writers couldn't come up with a decent idea.  When sex is in most of the scenes it really proves that the writers were at a loss here.  There isn't much of a plot that makes me want to be interested in any of the characters.  Horrible season.,1497657600,,355,4.318181818181818

2303153,5,B0009NZ2W4,BEST television series EVER made! I was so sad to see it end after 5 seasons. Each character is so fantastic and the dark humor that comes along with such raw emotional subject matter like death makes it perfectly balanced to where you can't take too much of it...it's more like can't get enough! Definitely binge-worthy!,1486684800,,321,4.75

2303156,3,B0009NZ2W4,"I guess the best way to describe the show is, that we live in a different generational world today. It's shocking at times that these behaviors exist. It's an eyeopener to

I don't know whether the writers changed or what happened but season 4 is a real drag.  I understand this was first released in the early 2000s but the ridiculous story lines that started in season 4 are more than I can be bothered to watch.  It's almost like it's written by people who have never met a gay person or a teenager or -- really -- anyone.  It would be less annoying if the first three seasons hadn't been so good.",1485216000,,553,4.238095238095238

I would have given up after the first season if not for my wife continuing to watch, although she doesn't even like any of the characters. And I've never seen a show where they force the ""F"" word into almost every conversation, it must make them think they're cool I guess. I'm not against colorful language if it fits as in a show like The Wire where the language was ""colorful "" but it fit and was an excellent series. This show just sucks!

Some of the relentless relationship drama is taxingwhy can't David and Keith just stop arguing all the time?? And I can NOT stand Brenda. I should have a ton of empathy for her, but I don't. At this point, Maya is my favorite character. She's endearing, predictable, and wise beyond her year. *wink, wink :) Good show if you like early twenty-first-century urban drama.

Me like most people are afraid of death, or the unknown. Six feet under examines the human condition when faced with death and dying, and puts a comforting spin on the grim subject.

It was groundbreaking for its time and still feels that way. I was surprised by quantum physics references I thought were based on more recent knowledge. I was amazed by the depiction of human relationships of every description. I was moved by the frailty and strength, the pettiness and depth, of the humanity it portrayed. There were some cracks in the acting--a few scenes where disbelief declined to be suspended. But overall, a well-realized family saga with important messages on life and death. It doesn't get more basic than that, right?",1476403200,,667,4.808695652173913

Gay sex, straight sex and with as many different partners as possible. I don't consider this entertaining if that is the only story line. Will not watch the remainder of season four or any of the offered seasons remaining. This seems to be the pattern with these TV series. Either the writers change or they are no longer creative after the third or fourth season. Disappointing as they start out with good plots and the acting is usually very good.",1470096000,2,604,4.601851851851852

Saw it offered on Amazon, and needed a TV show for 'me' time while exercising. Wow! Was I pleasantly surprised by the acting and writing.

Sex scenes in my opinion go too far, I'm not into watching other people. As married woman with three kids, I get it. The show should start with kissing, grabbing, and fade away, jeez who really needs to see the whole thing? That's a different genre.",1468627200,2,515,4.354166666666667

It's so well acted and written and takes me along a journey of life through its best and worst realities.

2304219,4,B0009NZ2W4,"It made me care and made me cry. Fine writing, acting, and directing. They've lost the needed comic relief, though. It's overwhelmingly dark and heavy, unlike the early seasons. I love that the show takes on important issues -- not the least of which is the way western culture deals with death. They say so much that needs to be said about so many things. I number one complaint about this series, from beginning to end, is the overuse of profanity. When a scene truly calls for profanity, it has little punch because the viewer has always heard that language in every scene leading up to it. I realize there are some in our culture who can't utter a sentence without a bleep in it, but media needn't support and encourage that. People are far more interesting when they express themselves without profanity. In fact, the profanity is the reason I gave this four stars instead of the five it otherwise deserves.",1456531200,,912,4.635802469135802

Each show is different from the others, but begin with the death of somebody and their last experience in The first person in most episodes.  There is an ongoing storyline for each of the characters which grows with passing times which is why I recommend you purchase beginning with the first season since all episodes can be independent of each other, but the character development and background really adds to this amazing and strange series.

2305263,3,B0009NZ2W4,"The earlier seasons were very good with character development and the relationship dynamics, but Season-4 shifted into being fixated on the sexual behavior of the characters as the main theme. All good in moderation, but this comes off as if the writers got lazy and decided to fixate on the sexual confusion theme that quickly becomes boring and even tedious to watch.",1433721600,,369,4.967741935483871

2305285,2,B0009NZ2W4,"While the story-line is somewhat compelling, the characters are extremely depraved and dysfunctional. To call this a dark comedy is an understatement. The most troubling element, however, is Hollywood's continual endorsement and sales of harmful drug, alcohol and tobacco use. In addition, not a single character portrayed in this series has any redeeming features. Watching this series is enough to depress the viewer. The series ends with one of the best wrap-ups of any television series. Unfortunately, it is not enough to lift the series off the garbage heap.",1433721600,2,564,5.348314606741573

2305349,3,B0009NZ2W4,"After a superlative three seasons, this season jumped the shark a bit - everyone is having sex with strangers (except Brenda, who despite being engaged to a nice guy continues to have sex with Nate), making bad decisions, etc.  I lost sympathy for all characters except Ruth this year.  It was like watching a series of train wrecks.  On the other hand, we get some surprising resolution to the Lisa situation, and the David and Keith relationship is growing (when they're not out banging strangers, that is). I know they pull it out in Season Five.",1431388800,,549,4.697916666666667

2305379,4,B0009NZ2W4,"The terrific acting continues in season four. The content gets darker and sometimes painful to watch. David's assailant is one of the most evil characters I can remember ever viewing and his ability to haunt David is very well portrayed. Clare and Ruth both descend into darker places and the only rays of hope in the story are Maya and perhaps Keith. Rico and Vanessa's marriage fell apart in such a painful and typical way. Brenda's Mom and her newfound boyfriend, Olivier, are a bit of comic relief because they are still so fun to loathe. And there continues to be no lack of imagination when it comes to the opening bizarre and gruesome fatal accidents to provide the Fisher/Diaz home with customers.",1431043200,,705,4.739837398373984

2305437,5,B0009NZ2W4,Fantastic--The show examines various personal issues in detail and builds strong characters.  The actors portray  those characters extremely well.

I can grow weary of a series as it ""develops"". New writers come in or the producers want it to be ""fresh"".  And the show changes to the point that it's core attraction has changed and I never watch again.  This series does change and adapt from season to season but it holds the core.

The next 3 seasons got into very inappropriate areas and even though I know that there are these types of behaviors; example three guys having sex and condemning the Lord, a lot of drug usage within the family and other examples I don't have time to mention; they are not the norm as much as what was presented in the show. At the end of Season 5, they finally started to add some belief and prayer. I believe there is actually more people who would rather be encouraged  by what they watch. So all and all, after watching the whole series I deleted it off of my devise and prayed that if any doors for the enemy were opened that they would  be closed and sealed...AMEN  I also feel that it was a waste of time from season 3 on.

Multiple partner gay sex.
 Abortion without any sorrow or looking into alternatives.  The father was never notified in case he would like to raise the child.
 Multiple partner heterosexual sex is ""normal"" ....just bounce from lover to lover.
I just couldn't take it anymore.  I thought maybe somewhere along the way they would learn from their promiscuity....maybe have some guilt or life changing events.  But it's just a sleazy smut show with a splash of comedy now and then.",1426636800,,531,4.855555555555555

Having said that, it is a tremendous series.  Very compelling - great story telling, great production values, great acting, etc., etc..  I'd have to say it is one of the best dramas I've ever seen be it in movies, theater, or TV.  Before watching the series I read that many critics have said it has one of the very best series finales ever and after watching I thoroughly agree.

Everyone on the show a drama queen who can't deal with ANYTHING without falling apart. Is this America? I feel no connection to any of these melodramatic, soft, weak, mean, selfish, sex-driven, disloyal, perpetually bad decision making characters.  I am not a hater.

However despite a few good episodes, the season dealt primarily with whining couples unable to get their acts together. Even Frances Conroy couldn't do anything to overcome the character written for her. I persevered, hoping that somehow the original energy would return but the episode ""That's My Dog"" where David is ""car-jacked"" and taken on a wild ride by a psychopath was just too overworked and unbelievable - even for wimpy David - that I just gave hope and got through the season. I'm not sure I'll bother with season 5. At least Nate might get rid of the totally stupid haircut he affected after his surgery and marriage to Lisa who, thankfully appears only occasionally as a ghost now.",1414368000,,866,4.773333333333333

Corruption is a way of life.

The problem is, all the characters are so screwed up that my wife and I are just can't take the depression any more. Story after story of death, betrayal, drugs, and mixed and broken gender relationships. Last night we both looked at each other after watching the last episode of season 4 and said, that's enough.

2306566,5,B0009NZ2W4,If you like quirky programs and/or are a Dexter fan you will love this series.

It has a liberal attitude toward life. Cheating in a comitted relation ,gay sex,drugs,abortions and anything to have fun. And at the end when they could get out of a job they hate they still stayed with the funeral home because it was a family generathion business. And Clar goes to N Y C .What a lousy city to live in. It was amazing how they showed a soldier who lost 2 legs and an arm and comitted suicide and blaming republicans and not even mentioning the almost 3000 people who lost their lives on 9/11/2001 in the worse terrorist attack in out history. That brought on the war.",1404777600,,736,4.340579710144928

I love the fire tv when it works but I am beginning to think I may have to return it and not get Prime since I can't hear the movies.  I will keep trying.,1402012800,,388,3.6951219512195124

2306624,5,B0009NZ2W4,"Yes, Six Feet Under is a bit of a soap opera, but not annoyingly so. The acting is terrific, especially Michael C Hall's performance in Episode 5, ""That's My Dog,"" which takes his character on a horrendous journey.",1397174400,,214,4.657894736842105

2306643,5,B0009NZ2W4,"A quirky, less than boring family played by extremely watchable actors. The neurotic mother (Frances Conroy) has appeared on all three seasons of American Horror Story and the gay son (Michael C. Hall) went on to become the serial killer Dexter. They are both brilliant here and you can see a whole different side to Mr. Hall which highlights his amazing range as an actor.
  The entire cast is brilliantly cohesive and, like your own family, you will love them one episode, hate them another and find yourself throwing advice (Get over it! Forgive yourself! Stop being so stubborn!) at the TV. Great scripts, enough funny to keep you from getting bogged down in the challenges the characters navigate and some interestingly real scenes occur in the midst of an ongoing string of slightly surreal situations. You'll keep tuning in just to see how the latest 'client' won his/her Darwin Award! We are really enjoying this series!!!",1390176000,,930,4.917197452229299

If you think your Job sucks and you have a hard day at work and with family imagine that your family is your business and you own and run a funeral home. Imagine you may have to bury your own family members or you lose friends and loved ones and your family is riding you back that its still a business yet while personal secrets are showing up during the funeral with the ridiculous requests that are made. Now throw in all the other troubles with life and your personal life this makes for the best entertaining series that HBO has ever done in my opinion.

I ordered all seasons of six feet under and only one of the five boxes was in mint condition all other four boxes were broken, cracked and ripped. The box they came in was in good condition so it seemed like the products was already damaged at the Amazon facility.

The first episode of Season 4 is one of the best of the entire series and could almost be another finale to Season 3.  Season 4's biggest problem is that it is a transition season.  It starts off right where 3 left us, with Nate at Brenda's door.  Half of the season is Nate getting over what happened in Season 3.  I found that the Season struggled to find a place for Claire and for David.  The big event in David's life in Season 4 is not needed in the show.  It's really only important near the end of Season 5.  Claire is off rebelling against her terrible choices with men by making more mistakes with art school crazies.  With all this being said, the reason to watch Season 4 is for the first episode and so you know what's going on at the beginning of Season 5.  I love the show so I loved Season 4 but I think it was struggling to move on to what became Season 5.  My least favorite of the 5 seasons.",1228780800,,986,4.005128205128205

2306696,5,B0009NZ2W4,"I disagree that this season wasn't as good as the others.  In most shows I notice it takes several episodes to really get the season going...almost as if they're easing into it.  So once that is out of the way, it's a little more exciting from there.  I really enjoyed the craziness of George, and the evolvement and experimentation of Claire.  Nate and Brenda, I'd been waiting for that.  And the whole Lisa story I was on the edge of my seat just waiting to see what was going on.  And not to forget the stand-out episode with David getting car jacked.  WOW, here this cast and the story writers really shined.

Overall I just want to say that SFU is maybe my all time favorite TV show, or damn near close to it (I do love tv).  So this is a show you just can't miss.  A show about something that we all have to deal with, death, family, loss, love, metamorphasis.....well, you can't turn away.

From the first season to the last episode I've seen (""Untitled,"" the finale of the fourth season) each episode kept me entertained, many of them making me weep and even more of them making me laugh.  The simple fact is that Alan Ball and the staff of this show simply know how to make brilliant television that explores the nature of death and what it means to be in a relationship.

That being said, I think this season was certainly the weakest of the bunch.  Don't get me wrong, as I said before, each of the episodes worked well and the overall season was great.  There were even some brilliant standouts that would rival the best of Ball's work, such as ""That's My Dog"" (an evocative, shocking hour of television that I'd compare to Joss Whedon's masterpiece&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Body/dp/B000EHSVM8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Body</a>) and ""Untitled.""  I also feel that fans of the first three seasons of 6FU will like this quite a lot.  What the season doesn't do, however, is step it up a notch like previous seasons did.

""Six Feet Under"" has always been a show that defied my expectations, always carrying through with new, crazy, and poignant plots and keeping the drama at a consistently increasing level.  While there are moments here and there in the plot that wowed me, but the rest of it seemed to be static and slightly predictable.  The times when the narrative did ""go there,"" especially in the instances of the George/Ruth relationship, it seemed a bit too out there to grasp.  There were a few plots that fell off or were never developed enough--the character of George's son is the clearest example.  In the beginning of the season, he only existed as a plot device to rationalize the hilarious scenes of excrement being found in the Fisher's mailbox, and later in the season, when they had the chance to re-introduce him as an actual character, all he does is act as a trigger to George's growing paranoia concerning conspiracy theories.

Overall, while this doesn't take the drama to the next level the way previous ""Six Feet Under"" seasons have in the past, it's still some of the best television out there.  While a lot of it feels like set-up for the next season, it's still twelve episodes of television well worth watching.

2306706,2,B0009NZ2W4,"The first season of Six Feet Under featured astonishing acting/writing/directing, and was a truly and amazing new show. However, the show began to lag part way into the second season. It lost its witty death related humor, and began to lose the format of the original shows. The decline of the second season culminated in a clich cliff hanger, typical of shows that don't know how to maintain interest. Season three starts with a confusing premier which includes a massive jump in time that ejects the viewer out of the show, and further illustrates the writers' budding ability NOT to deal with tough issues. By season four the show has fully declined into a rather lame and incongruent night time soap, with the standard love triangles, mystery deaths, and psychics. They have also managed to fully lose their format, that of the beginning death dictating the tone of the show. One of the episodes starts with a death based on an anti-LSD agenda, and after the first scene they completely ignore the issues and the kid who died. I'm pretty sure Fisher Sons and Diaz didn't even embalm the guy. At some point the massive amount of useless sex they have added to the show, and the extended kidnapping episodes become nothing more than unpredictable and uninteresting. If you enjoy the first season of Six Feet Under, quit while you are ahead. However, if you enjoy shows like Alias, Lost, and Days of Our Lives, with their cliff hangers, disjointed action, and love octagons, then i would advise you to PARTY ON!, and enjoy the last few seasons.

BOTTOM LINE: If you are looking for good TV, the kind where pain, humor, and love dance in a similar fashion to life, watch the first season and don't waist time on the rest. If you just love characters no matter how strange they are written, continue by all means; the plot doesn't get worse, just the writing acting and directing.

PORN FACTOR: By season four people are just having random sex, and the story lines seem to be a little better then bottom of the barrel porn. So, i guess, good soft core porn for the win!",1167782400,7,2068,4.647540983606557

2306709,5,B0009NZ2W4,"Marathon-watching the fourth season again in several months, what strikes me most is that it's not as dark as I remembered it was. It has many moments of a subtle humor, not exactly a ""dark humor,"" more of a ""joco-serious"" kind readers of Joyce find in his works. For instance, in ""Terror Starts at Home"" episode. Claire and two other friends from the art school make graffiti/art on a wall, when Claire says ""How many evil-doers do you have to kill before you become one yourself?"" and Edie (Mena Suvari) replies, ""Totally."" I remembered this scene to be darker. A giggle at the absurdity perhaps, but essentially a painful glimpse into Claire's growing pains, her wondering why she has to hate everyone and everything so. Watching it this time, it felt much more light-hearted. And I had more than a giggle, especially at the way Edie says ""Totally.""

Another such ""joco-serious"" moment comes during David's birthday party in the same episode. Claire is completely stoned at the table, making everyone uncomfortable. Finally Ruth asks her to help her ""clear the table,"" to which Vanessa stands up to help, and Claire sarcastic-in-a-stoned way says, ""Only women are clearing."" Hearing this, Rico and Keith stand up to help, and Claire goes: ""Only women and people of color are clearing."" SFU fans would see why these moments are so funny and funny in a--I don't know, American culture's self-reflective, self-deprecating way? I don't know how to put this, but one reason I just love SFU is that, in it, even really small moments in the mundane life of the Fisher family can be taken as wider, American, cultural moments. Maybe this is an over-reaction on my part, as a student of American literature and culture.

If the viewer has been ruminating why Brenda keeps being self-destructive, one definite answer is to be found in this season, which is in the triangle she forms with Joe and Nate. While in a relationship with Joe, she repeats what she did when she was with Nate and sleeps with him. To Brenda who insists that her behavior is partly Joe's fault, Nate retorts: ""No, it's you. I of all people should know that. I used be Joe."" When Joe finally walks in and see the two about to have sex, he memorably sums up what makes Brenda so essentially an insecure person: ""What do you call a person without integrity, without honesty, without loyalty? I call it a f**king waste of my time."" To Brenda's excuse that it is all about sex, his answer: ""It's not sex, it's betrayal. That is your f**king addiction.""

The show has become a never-ending rant against American culture (patriarchism, conventional morality, pursuit of happiness) peopled by soulless zombies who stumble from wreck to wreck in search of who knows what. Happiness is never depicted, never aspired to and honored only in the breach.

2306723,4,B0009NZ2W4,"Season 4 of ""Six Feet Under"" retains its stranglehold on viewers' attention, pulling its audience into watching episode after episode.  Even if the material is profoundly disturbing and markedly uncomfortable to watch at times, this show remains unafraid and unapologetic in the way it tackles some of life's big questions.

Particularly well-handled this season is how Claire experiences a creative epiphany as an artist and ""breaks open"" her eye to see anew.  The tricky nature of images - where truths lie half-hidden beneath seemingly ordinary surfaces - also plays a pivotal role in the season finale in the reveal about what happened to Lisa.

However, a certain something seems to be missing from Season 4 when compared to Seasons 1-3: the large institutional backdrops that served as such terrific foils in earlier years are gone.

Seasons 1 and 2, for example, had fun exploring the ins and outs of the funeral home industry, which provided ample grist for season-long tension and humor that complemented (and in some ways balanced out) the turmoil occurring in the personal relationships of the main characters.  Other institutional backdrops that provided lots of ""play"" in the first three seasons included high school, the LAPD, local Protestant churches, art college, and a gay men's chorus.  These highly organized social environments helped to reveal different aspects of characters' personalities and identities by exerting pressure on them and exploring how they responded.

Another notable difference in Season 4 is that the ""opening death"" at the beginning of each episode no longer resonates  throughout that episode's storyline in any meaningful way.

Without the balancing effects of institutional backdrops or ""opening death"" storylines, Season 4 focuses intently (even relentlessly) on the issues of personal identity, relationships, and family.  Some may feel this crosses over into soap opera territory, but Season 4 remains compelling viewing.

NOTE:  Season 4 may offend some viewers with scenes of graphic violence and fairly explicit sex.",1125273600,8,2068,5.425
2306724,1,B0009NZ2W4,"I obsessively rented all of the first three seasons of SFU on DVD (I don't watch HBO), and loved them, though I got a bit bored with Nate's shenanigans at the end of season three.  Season four is absolutely, unapologetically, awful.  And it seems to be the fault of the writers and creator far more than the cast (which I loved, mostly, for their hardy and realistic personalities, and because they aren't all hollywood beautiful).  The writers have destroyed this cast, turning them all into one single plot device:  sex.  Apparently they got bored, or lazy, because the primary character struggle for all the characters other than Ruth pertains to sex in general and, usually, infidelity in particular.

This might have made sense for one character arc.  Say Nate, even.  His wife is dead, and he doesn't know what to do, so he grieves by being destructive.  But Brenda's ""problem"" is mostly completely overwritten, and the writers have turned almost every character into some hypersexualalized idiot whose perpetual thoughts pertain only to whom they are sleeping with and when.  And we understanding almost NOTHING of their motivations:  aside from Claire, whose aside with her girlfriend is fairly believable and well-written, I seriously can't figure out the basic tenets of the show.  Why is David being unfaithful?  Why is Rico being unfaithful?  Why is Keith being unfaithful?  Why is Brenda (a previously delighftully awful, funny, complex character who expressed herself well) pretending to want to get pregnant when she doesn't, and why does she want to study psychology when the first and second seasons show her life-long mockery of the profession?

The problem is that this show has turned into a soap opera, and we get very little data on the motivations of the characters.  By the end, they cease to become characters at all, really, and are mostly just sex objects.  Maybe that interests some people, but I watched this show for different reasons.  I won't watch season five.",1125100800,29,1993,5.003039513677812
2306725,4,B0009NZ2W4,"This show has to be one of the best written in so, so long. I don't have cable so I had to wait a long time to see this show all the way from season one. Everything form the amazingly beautiful and quirky opening credits, to the richness and sophistication of the DVD menus themselves, everything about this show is top notch.

This season is a little muddy. I found it frustrating that sex was the one hard (no pun meant) foundation of all of the crises in the show from EVERY character, except Ruth. I also find it a cop out that if some of the characters (main and supporting) are in a pinch relationship wise, they switch to gay lovin' (which seems to be a common thread with all the seasons). There's no problem with that, if it were believable, but Claire's relationship seemed forced to me.

I also for the life of me cannot for one second believe David and Keith's relationship. That is the most contrived relationship in the show. These characters have nothing in common, they don't even seem to be on the same page, and this season thus far seems to highlight that loophole more and more. They bounce off of what one wants to hear, and then when they hear it, they don't want it anymore. The actors are doing their best to make it feel genuine, but it is not, nor has it ever worked. Why are they together?

All in all this show is so well crafted, that this ""darker"" season is just a low period for the characters in the whole of the timeline of the show. I love going in and not really knowing what is going to happen next. Its delicious.",1125014400,3,1550,4.283276450511946
2306726,2,B0009NZ2W4,"It has come to my disappointment that the season 4 of SFD has been the least interesting, dramatic but most disappointing so far. When I was watching, I had a feeling that the plot was hauled deliberately in order to save up enough dynamites for a huge dramatic explosion in the coming final season.

Nothing much happens in season 4. Or I should say everything that should happen has happened already. In this season, following Lisa's death, Nate has been struggling for settlement among different women, including, of course, Brenda Chenowith. Yet, the plot is not clear in explaining why he needs settlement. There are times that Nate may seem to want independence for a refreshing life. In the next minute, he will hit on another woman. I believe the audience are already tired of seeing Brenda as a third-person when Nate is married with Lisa; and even more bored seeing Nate miss Lisa when he has decided to get back with Brenda. Why does he, or should I say the plot, keep coming back and forth? It just seems to me that the characters, Nate, Lisa and Brenda have reached their limits. The space for further expansion seems remote. Indeed, the mystery of Lisa's death is revealed in episode 12.  I don't find it convincing or suggestive at all.

As for Claire Fisher, she is always my favorite character in SFD because of her cynicism and rebellious attitude. I am glad that she has comes to a successful level by being an artist. Yet, she is also another character whose space for expansion is very limited. She finally goes back to Billy Chenowith, all the way back to season 2. The point of making her a lesbian for 2 minutes and befriend with a bunch drug-addicts is unrevealing to her growth. That Russel still drags a long is another irritating part in the whole season.

Every troubled character goes back to normal in season 4: Brenda's mother, Ruth Fisher's sister, Sarah, Brend and Billy. Ruth Fisher remains as the outfast of the family whose kitchen becomes the only place she can situate herself and has a little more dominance over the family routines or abnormalities. Her marriage with George is interrupted in season 4 as George turns out to be a bit indifferent of the womanly needs, yet Ruth becomes more and more anxious and knowing the background of the mysterious geologist. George is hinted with a sense of sickness in the end of the whole season. He has retreated to a bomb shelter and claims that it is where he will start living. Ruth has caught him talking into the air when there's no one nearby. Kyle and Maggie, George's children, also appeared, but nothing much happen on them. I believe if George's 'sickness' has been put much earlier in the season, the drama will become more successful in grabbing the hearts of the audience.

What I don't like in season 4 is that David Fisher is portrayed as a drama queen since the carjack. He has been excessively attention-seeking and over-demanding to Keith. This falls into the stereotype of homosexual representation in TV dramas that gays are dramatic. The reappearance of Sarge is absurd and bringing back Jennifer to season 4 is also pointless. The most ridiculous point is that Keith sleeps with the female boss (who is a super star). At the end of season 4, Keith is also hired as a bodyguard of a gay film maker in order to settle down a lawsuit for David. This may be interesting, but don't you see? All the potential plots are now outside the original Fisher family: Is George sick? Keith will become a slut and become a money boy? What can the 4 Fishers still do in season 5? Are we still interested in seeing Nate and Brenda break up again? Or Claire is hurt again by Billy? David and Keith talking about their openness of their open relationship? These questions seem a bit vexing to the screenwriters indeed.

Still, I think Kathy Bates and Patricia Clarkson are being under-used in the whole drama. Bettina and Ruth Fisher could have become a pair of female good friends, or even lovers. Sarah could have had more interaction with the Fisher family. Yet, the two interesting characters are just strictly staying in the domain of Ruth Fisher.",1124928000,19,4137,4.668038408779149

2306728,3,B0009NZ2W4,"I am a big fan of Six Feet Under - this season was fantastic. My only complaint is in the DVD release of this season. Before each season aired on HBO, there was a promo created and aired to showcase the upcoming season. These promos were set to music, and were a mini movie in themselves: Season 3 featured an ""in the clouds"" promo set to Coldplay's ""A Cold Rush Of Blood To The Head"". Season 4 featured a very well done supermarket promo set to Nina Simone's ""Feeling Good"" and it was a little different in that each week the promo changed a little bit - new scenes were added - until finally revealing one complete promo. Season 5 featured a very cool driving sequence set to Sia's ""Breathe.""

The season 3 DVD set featured the promo with a behind the scenes interview with the creators of the show who talked about how making these promos were great not only artistically but were better than airing clips of the upcoming season. I bought the 4th Season Six Feet Under set the day it was released and was upset that the promo was not on there, instead only lackluster special features.

I am a big fan of continuity on DVD box sets, so I am left wondering why put the promo for the 3rd season on the box set if they aren't going to include the other 2? I hope with the 5th season's eventual DVD release that they at least put lots of special features on it to make it worthwhile for the fans, and I'm keeping my fingers crossed that they will include not only the promo for season 5 but also throw in the season 4 promo as well.

I've tried to comment on this on the hbo website to give them feedback for their DVD release of season 5, but as with my experience in the past, they praise feedback of any kind, but never comment or email me back.",1124841600,4,1747,4.224550898203593

2306730,1,B0009NZ2W4,"I was an absolute LOVER of this show and couldn't get enough of it the first couple of seasons.  But unfortunately, somewhere along the way (and I think this started in season 3) this show became just another television soap albeit a classy, much more sophisticated one.  But that is still not enough to justify this putrid season.  The 3rd season is really when SFU started to deteriorate, but at least that season had some quality moments and ended with a knockout punch in 3 quality episodes.  But the 4th season is when the show really took a nose dive.  I don't care what any of these other ""sheep"" say, but the 4th was definitely the worst.  The ""That's My Dog"" debacle confirmed it, but the show was actually headed in that tired direction for a while.  I suspect many of the people who LOVED the 4th season don't get much quality entertainment outside of HBO or Showtime if they liked this season so much.  If you really LOVED SFU, I cannot recommend this season although HBO has conveniently front-loaded the set with all the extras the other seasons should have had.  Which leads me to believe they feel the same way and want to make sure the set sells well enough.  I bought the 1st 2 seasons with few extras at all and may buy the 3rd one of these days but that's where it ends for me.  My romance with this show died completely with season 4, but I will always cherish my memories of when this show was at its peak.

2306731,3,B0009NZ2W4,"The first three seasons of Six Feet Under provided a fresh, rebellious drama that was not afraid to take chances.  The show had it's own sense of humor and well developed characters that would otherwise not be seen on television.  Lisa dying was a bit unbelievable, but we all turned a passive eye knowing that she was the worst Six Feet Under character ever and there was no other alternative.  At the end of the Season 3 finale, Six Feet Under was one of the best shows to ever grace the television.  Then Season 4 began, and so did Six Feet Under's descent into crazy soap opera land.  Nate, instead of being the compassionate idealist, became a moppy, depressed, and a little crazy.  Sure, I expect him to feel this way after Lisa's death for a few episodes...but not the whole season.  When he buried Lisa and screamed, I laughed at how ridiculous it was.  David stopped being Alan Ball's gay right activist and became crazy after the best episode of the Season in which he is kidnapped.  When he bites that guy's ear off, it ruins the episode.  Keith was entertaining, but he's only a minor character.  Claire became a supporting character, always seen doing drugs or being as pretentious as the writers of this show (very stereotypical art school things).  The scene in which she told Justin that she had an abortion was the worst writing and acting I've seen on the show.  Ruth provided the only bearable storyline of the family members, but then George went crazy.  That's right, two chracters in one season going completely insane.  Frederico became the best character of the season with the fued between his wife and the stripper.  His storyline actually had some light moments and felt like the previous seasons.  Brenda was the worst.  So right after she recovers from being a sexaholic, she gets together with a sex fiend?  How dramatically conveinent.  The writers ran out of ideas so fast that they had to cut this and Season 5 by one episode and end the series after only 5 seasons.  OK, now put all of these storylines together, and I must say there is not much of a difference between Season 4 of Six Feet Under and Season whatever of The O.C. or Desperate Housewives.  Maybe T.V. viewers eat this stuff up, but I need something a little less predictable, a little less improbable, and something with a little more humor.

The guest actor of this episode, Michael Weston, should have no trouble finding future work, as his performance warrants nomination for an Emmy Award.  I will not spoil you with the details of this episode, other than to say it breaks ranks with the format of other episodes of the series, the entire final half an hour focuses on a series of events that will leave the viewer drained by the conclusion of the episode.

Personal highlights: When David finds unrelenting terror in ""That's My Dog,"" Claire and her high antics with her artsy friends in ""Terror Starts at Home,"" and the sinister atmosphere in most of the season finale ""Untitled.""

*  *  *

In four seasons, I've come to love these characters like they're my dear friends.  When a season ends, it's as if I've finished a really long, really fantastic novel that I wish never ended, and hate that I have to wait untold months until the next season.  I subscribed to HBO in time to watch Season 5, and I'm very sad now that 6FU is now gone forever.

I'm very pleased to tell you that Season 4 is quite a bit happier than Season 3.  Oh, bad stuff happens, people hurt, people suffer, just like in life.  But you don't have to worry about Nate going through another downward spiral like in Season 3.  Season 4 brings more of the dark, quirky, off-beat humor that seemed almost absent from Season 3 (look for the helium-inflated life-sized bimbo dolls!!).

Season 4 picks up immediately where Season 3 left off, with Nate, all beat up and bloody, at Brenda's door.  Over the next 4-5 episodes, Nate is working through the grieving process, dealing with his pain, his loss, and his complicated feelings about Lisa and their relationship.  His path to healing is uneven and rough, and he never quite gets over the loss (no one would).  But Nate does get it together, and once again becomes the old Nate that we all knew and loved so much before the tragic events of Season 3.

Brenda is working through her own issues; her regret of mistakes she made in Season 2 influences her behavior in a new relationship; she wants desperately to have a simple, ""normal"" relationship.  But she finds that leaving the past is not so easy.

David and Keith are still together.  Unusual for 6FU, there's an episode that focuses almost completely on David and something rather intense that happens to him, that will have implications for the rest of Season 4 (and even Season 5).  This episode is visceral - it really gets under your skin, and not completely in a good way.

The newlyweds Ruth and George eventually discover each other's warts, which the initial infatuation hid so well (as it often does in real life).  Kathy Bates shows up again for a few episodes, providing a pleasant distraction for Ruth at a time when she really needs it.

Claire, on the other hand, is still suffering from the betrayals she endured in Season 3.  One of my favorite characters in Seasons 1-3, Claire becomes much less likable by the end of Season 4.

Season 4 has a few notable guest stars.  Kathy Bates returns for a few episodes.  Mena Suarve (from American Beauty and American Pie - a very patriotic actress judging by the titles of movies she's in) appears for about 5 episodes as Claire's friend, influence, and maybe something more....  Nicole Richie even does a self-deprecating cameo as herself.

Most 6FU fans are not squeamish.  Yet, I feel compelled to warn you:  Season 4 contains images and scenes that are more explicit than anything I've ever seen on TV.  Some of the bodies on Rico's table make CSI look like Sesame Street.  There's also a scene where someone puts a gun in their mouth, pulls the trigger, and we see EVERYTHING.  There's a scene where someone picks up a freshly used condom off the floor, holds it up for himself - and us - to see.  And the most explicit man-on-man sex scenes 6FU has ever shown.

If you can stomach these kinds of things, and if you're even a casual fan of Six Feet Under, I highly recommend Season 4.",1122336000,42,3506,4.518282988871224

Each are on their own journey. Ruth is now married to George who has more secrets than she had expected. David and Keith are looking for ways to start over. Nate is experiencing what it is like to be a widower and a single parent. Claire begins experimenting with her sexuality during her sophomore year at high school. And Federico begins a secret affair unknown to his wife.

The only person not linked to the Fishers during this time, who has her own secret storyline would have to be Brenda Chenowith played by the fabulous Rachel Griffiths. Brenda now separated from Nate and her brother, tries to build a better life for herself by studying to become a therapist and seeing her neighbor Joe, played by Justin Theroux.

This 5 disc set, includes all 12 episodes from the fantastic fourth season which include:

*Falling Into Place

*In Case of Rapture

*Parallel Play

*Can I Come Up Now?

*That's My Dog

*Terror Starts at Home

*The Dare

*Coming and Going

*Grinding the Corn

*The Black Forest

*Bomb Shelter

*Untitled- Season finale directed by Alan Ball

The box set contains 7 audio commentaries with Alan Ball, writers & directors on episodes 1,3,5,6,7,11 and 12.

*Cut by Cut: Editing Six Feet Under, a featurette on how a Six Feet Under episode is made.

*Costas + The Cast of Six Feet Under- an interview with the cast of Six Feet Under with interviewer, Bob Costas.

Seasons 4-5 gets 2.5 stars. Too depressing. No humor. You end up disliking main characters.
Series just plummets after the 2nd season and continues its death spiral, no pun intended.

For a series that began with so much promise, it ultimately ends up not being worth the time to finally...FINALLY...get to the conclusion. And we waited 50+ episodes for the LAZIEST ending ever?! Did they run out of money or did the producers intentionally choose to copy Al Pacino's death in Godfather 3 multiple times? Each character gets a 10 second send off that creates all kinds of questions.

Ole timeless George, twenty years in the future and he hadn't aged a day...do we assume his mental illness was just a temporary condition? Are the producers that big a proponent of electric shock treatment? Really unlikely that Ruth would have still been with George. Baffling.

Do we assume that Keith and David couldn't make it work after all? Keith owns an armored car (his name's on it) and is making a delivery to the First Back of India. Did he move there? David would be 60 when this happens so do we assume he closed the business and moved out of the country leaving their two adopted sons behind? So the big love story is just a bust after all? 14 years later David keels over just before seeing Keith again? Huh?

Our group applauds the comic genius around Brenda's death...Billy finally bores her to death...literally...hahah...Billy really was that boring though. Everyone watching this episode was literally on the floor laughing at Brenda's death and we watched her final eye roll at least ten times...was it supposed to be THAT funny?

By the time Clare dies I guess the family's forgotten all about her? No one there to welcome her into the next realm? Really? What a blown opportunity to show that the family, all young, healthy, and happy, were right there awaiting her arrival. But no, she dies completely terrified and alone...or was she just severely constipated? Our group was mixed on this. Love the pic on the wall of the old David and the young Keith...uh...that makes no sense whatsoever.

What about Miya? Guess she lived forever?

So, I've been hearing about this show for many, many years, but never got around to watching it.  I got a subscription to HBO, and figured it was time to experience it myself.  I'm almost at the end of the show.  Only a few more left to go in Season 5, and I'll be done.

My final conclusion about this show is that it a great show.  Great acting, and well written.

I only have two complaints about the show.

First, the gay angle is forced in a few episodes, mainly Season 4 I think it is.  It isn't the David & Keith relationship.  Their relationship is fine, and well acted.  I'm referring to the whole gay exploration of David's sister, Claire.  The blond ""friend of Claire's"" - who is supposed to be a lesbian - ends up hooking up with Claire, and it was not believable at all.  The actress that plays Claire, usually does a good job, but her scenes with the blond are not that good at all.  The blond girl is even worse, which was probably the root of the problem.  Her scenes were simply not believable.  When I watched her, the blond, she literally came across to me as a young girl, pretending to be a lesbian.  Acting how she thinks a lesbian would act.  It was pathetic.  None of this has anything to do with being gay or not being gay , ... it was just bad acting.

I'm a little sick of forced gay scenes.  It was probably a little more an issue still, back when this show was made, but we're so far passed all of that, I'm just sick of writers forcing it into a show, when it isn't relevant and clearly is only being added to make some kind of socio-political statement and/or impact.  It's like, if it's part of the flow of the story, fine, but when the writers and/or directors/producers decide that, out of the blue, they want to show the American public that there is a bi-sexual in each and every one of us, and then randomly pick a character in a story that is already established and just slap in their and force on an already established character, how could it come across as anything but forced?

Then, when you add, on top of that, poor acting ... well, it's just a great way to ruin an otherwise good show.

Second, my other complaint is that sometimes I just want to smack every single one of the characters in this show.  MY GOD, WHAT A BUNCH OF COMPLAINING SELF-ABSORBED A-HOLES!!  Every single one of them ... my god!!  They are just NEVER HAPPY!!  EVER!!  Every single one of the characters in the ""Fisher"" family, spend their lives pursing what they want, and then - when they get it - all they every do is complain about it.  Sometimes it's just too much. Complain, complain, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN!!!!!  IT'S SUCH A DOWNER AFTER A WHILE!!  Nate, never stops complaining.  HE NEVER WANTS WHAT HE HAS, AND THEN HE SELF-RIGHTEOUSLY JUSTIFIES HIS EVERY ACTION.  But the problem is, they all do it.  The mother is even worse.  She decides she wants to get married again, so she FIGHTS AND BATTLES WITH THE ENTIRE FAMILY, SNAPPING AND YELLING AT ALL OF THEM THAT SHE IS GOING TO GET MARRIED.  THEN ONCE SHE'S MARRIED, AND GOTTEN WHAT SHE WANTED, SHE NEVER STOPS SCREAMING AND YELLING AND SNAPPING AT HER HUSBAND!!

Seriously, I'm at a point, with this show, that I just want to find all of them, and smack them in their complaining faces.  It's a good thing I'm at the end, because I wouldn't make it through another season.  I've had all I can take of them.  Every single one of them.  Nate, Claire, the Mother, Vanessa ... I just want to track down the actors and actresses that play them, and smack them all across the faces!!!!!  The only one that I'm even rooting for, at this point, is David.  The gay one!  He's the only one I can take, because the rest are all a bunch of DRAMA QUEENS!! HOW IRONIC!!

So, yeah, by all means watch the show.  It's great.  Just be ready for a bunch of complainers that all-in-all are a real DOWNER to watch, by the end of the show.  Still, it's a great show, and worth watching.  Just be sure to take some Prozac, or it might cause you to slip into a depression.",1501113600,,4082,4.306578947368421
