8313691,4,B0011TN70Y,"This is EXACTLY like Vista Point NEPAL (DVD - 2007)
Except this one is like 20 minutes longers. But its in the same order and same scenery. They just stay in Kathmandu a little longer in this dvd.
I wish I could return vista point and keep this one. I don't need 2 of the same thing.",1203379200,2,283,3.982456140350877
