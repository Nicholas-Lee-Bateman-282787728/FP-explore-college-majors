8433625,4,B004KZH5L8,"You get two movies and the second it's a total bonus!

First: Texas Cowboy. Plot...'take advantage of the widow...get rid of the brat'. Once again...don't read the box if you don't want the story entire plot to be given away before you watch the movie. The pacing is slow and almost comically so. It has a real air of campy silent and overall the movie as a production is kinda bad, but fun. The villains do things just because that's what Villains do and there's little (Villain) logic or method to their actions.  I have to think this did terribly at the box office because it was such a late silent (1929), and so old school even for then. The acting takes itself seriously so even that lends some unintended humour to the movie. The film quality is soft grainy but not distractingly so...in fact it's almost endearing. The good guy wins of course. But the fact that we have a young minor overcoming the two bad guys stretches credibility too. There are times when there is conversation going on and yet no dialogue cards, yet it doesn't hurt the story. This is comical in it's production, and for the time probably a lame movie, but I quite enjoyed it. The filming is crystal clear, no guessing at what is going on. In some scenes you can almost visualize them coming on and off stage. It's a funny movie for all the wrong reasons, yet I still enjoyed it. and the music? just recycled from others dvd's which seldom fits the action.

The Bonus...You get two. One: the box says the total running time is 75 minutes...NOT EVEN CLOSE! both movies add up to around 2 hours and ten minutes!!!(that's 130 minutes!)
The second bonus is you get a second full movie. The movie (With Sitting Bull at the Spirit Lake Massacre) is almost the same in pacing as the first... Yet this one is four years earlier(1925) and directed by someone completely different.and again comical for reasons not intended. and somewhat stereotypical in it's portrayal of the people and sides.  It's apparently a true story of a Spirit Lake Massacre. I was surprised it was a massacre based on the number of Indians used and the layout of the town and the foreknowledge the people had of it coming, so maybe something was lost from the history to the film. The film was Crisp, clear visuals and dialogue cards which all seemed original. The music was sometimes so Off as to be ludicrous, with even salvation army band music, and big band music, completely out of place. Again lots of screen chat that had no accompanying dialogue cards, but once again the story doesn't suffer.  This may seem like an odd thing to key in on, but there was one scene near the end, where I thought the gun-smoke effects was actually pretty cool and I watched that part twice. The Violinist plays a part and the expression on his face (seen on the box) I thought was priceless.",1392768000,,2828,4.537254901960784
