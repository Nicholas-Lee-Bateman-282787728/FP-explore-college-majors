8334251,5,B001PQBU2K,"I watched this 2004 Canadian nature movie on YouTube and found it one of the most beautifully filmed nature films I've ever seen! Bears, Moose, Cariboo, Salmon, Trout, Snow Hare, Snow Lynx, Timber Wolves, Alaskan Huskies, Hunting, Fishing, Log Cabin Building, Canoeing,Snow Sledding, Bighorn Sheep - did I miss anything - spectacular photography and cinematography! And the overarching theme is the harmony of man with nature. All of the people live in harmony with each other and with nature. Even the sled dogs get along with each other - so yes, some of it is phony, but what a cool vibe!",1465171200,,591,4.861386138613861
8334252,5,B001PQBU2K,"Living in the Wilds. Excellent movie if you like a story about real a couple living in the wilds. They live far from civilization and must survive as in the old days. They depend on each other and on animals to survive. There are no neighbors for many miles. --Roger Weston, author of The Golden Catch",1456531200,,301,4.392857142857143

8334255,5,B001PQBU2K,This is a movie about a trappers story.  He lives in the wild and has to find ways to survive and earn his living.  His partner shares lots of his struggle.  She is very commited to her life with him.  His dogs have to be a pack that looks after him in the wild.  This man is a hunter but not a slaughterer like many food gathering nations have become.  He has to use skill to catch or trap animals and takes no more than he needs.  AND uses all the animal.  This is a lovely tale of man in nature and survivings its challenges.,1332374400,3,528,3.961904761904762
