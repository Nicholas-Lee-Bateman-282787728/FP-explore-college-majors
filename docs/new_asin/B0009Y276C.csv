8070071,1,B0009Y276C,"The product itself came in perfect condition but the content is terrible for children. My ten years old asked for this for Christmas. The title ""Happy Tree Friends"" is very misleading. We popped this DVD in on Xmas day for the whole family to watch together...we watched in horror. The whole thing consists of morbid death scenes. Ren and Stimpy have nothing on this group of 'happy friends'. I don't reccomend this video. I will never buy this again. The seller, I do recommend.",1452211200,,479,4.714285714285714

8070073,4,B0009Y276C,"Happy Tree Friends is a cartoon series I bought for my college-aged daughter. Honestly, it's hilarious, but in a completely strange and gruesome way. If you like Itchy & Scratchy from the Simpsons, or Ren & Stempy, you'll like this. Not recommended for young kids!",1391558400,,264,4.888888888888889
