Richard Conrad, who helped put together Dorothea's last exhibit was one of my photography teachers at the San Francisco Art Institute, and introduced me to Dorothea's work. I recommend this documentary to all my own students now that I'm teaching photography.",1412121600,2,307,5.16

6453212,5,B00KX44PTK,"I saw this documentary on PBS.  I generally don't pay much attention to documentaries, preferring books, but this video caught my attention.  Most people are familiar with only one of Dorothea Lange's pictures, that of the Migrant Mother, an itinerant pea-picker whom she met in 1936 while working as a photographer for the Resettlement Administration (a federal agency created during the Depression to assist farmers who had been displaced).  Migrant Mother was only one of many photographs Lange took to document the suffering of people around her during the Great Depression and World War II.  She not only photographed migrant workers, but also ordinary Americans suddenly made destitute by the Depression, others displaced by the Dust Bowl or the various government infrastructure projects designed to provide labor or irrigate land, the disruption of the lives of Japanese Americans during World War II, and the inequalities suffered by both poor whites and blacks under the sharecropping system in the South.  In her private life, Dorothea struggled to balance her drive for excellence in photography and need to help others with the demands of being a wife, mother and stepmother.  This film showcases her professional and private life through the eyes of her children and grandchildren who serve as the narrators of the film.  Dyanna Taylor is Dorothea's granddaughter and follows in her footstep as a documentary film-maker.",1409443200,5,1434,5.31858407079646

6453214,5,B00KX44PTK,Was a great addition to this year's lesson on the FSA photographers. Wonderfully narrated by Dorothea herself in addition to a narrator. I even learned a few new things while watching it with my students.,1462147200,,204,4.857142857142857

6453217,5,B00KX44PTK,"i originally seen this documentary throuugh my history of photography, it really touched something deep in me and had to restrain my self as some parts actually had tears forming especially when the part of the japanese americans being put in a camp , but truely a true prisoner of war. thank you for showing it and showing me the true photographer",1460332800,,348,4.629032258064516

6453219,5,B00KX44PTK,"I just finished watching this; I rented it from the library. I think the only time I've ever felt so emotionally affected by photography was by old family photos.

The video shows, through narration, Lange's photography, and B&W movie film clips from the 60s, what this remarkable woman used photography for. At one point, she said: ""I don't care about photography, I just want to use it to show things."" There is no doubt she was an absolute master.

She used photography to document difficult times for people. The Dust Bowl, The Great Depression, Japanese internment, the flooding of a foremerly inhabited valley. All of it is just amazing.

It is hard to put into words how much I enjoyed this DVD. Let me just say that I will be buying the companion book, and will think about buying the DVD as well. If you are a photographer who enjoys people pictures, documentary photography, or street photography, you should watch this film. You will enjoy it immensely.",1457827200,,964,4.7604790419161676

6453241,5,B00KX44PTK,"I recommend this documentary to every aspiring photographer. It reveals the heart and mind of one of the most influential photographers of the twentieth century, and from a photographer's point of view, too.

6453242,5,B00KX44PTK,"I saw this documentary about photographer Dorothea Lange on PBSs American Masters series and decided to buy a copy to view again and share with others. Langes b/w photography is framed beautifully in this video about her life and work and legacy. I was a little surprised that the presentation of her photos in this documentary had a more powerful effect on me than my last viewing of them in a book. Its largely due to the filmmakers skill in setting the context of Langes life and struggles and placing them alongside the struggles of the many Americans she photographed. I sure wish we had more photographers of Langes caliber and social conscience working today. This is a slow-moving documentary that builds in power and ably captures a great artist at work. I recommend it to all viewers although I think lovers of photography, American history and women artists will find it most resonant.",1429920000,6,896,4.824675324675325

6453254,5,B00KX44PTK,A fascinating look at 1930's America through the lens (no pun intended) of a very interesting woman.

6453262,5,B00KX44PTK,It was so good to see and hear about Dorothea Lange's personal life.  Several times she talked about getting lost in the work - becoming selfless.

6453263,5,B00KX44PTK,"This is a stunning documentary! Directed by Lange's granddaughter, a filmmaker, the documentary digs more deeply into the photographer's life and work than any other film has to date. What the documentary also shows us, what many aren't familiar with, is the work that Lange did after her famous WPA project. The post-WPA work was on a smaller scale, but no less important, and it shows us that Lange was an artist whose passion for social justice spanned the whole of her life.",1419984000,7,478,4.771084337349397

6453266,5,B00KX44PTK,"A Beautifully Done Documentary

The footage in this film is breathtaking. You feel as you are there with Dorothea today, and yet the footage of her planning her exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) was taken in the 1960's. Such contemporary views, I was fascinated to learn of her personal journey through the Great Depression, the Japanese American internment and the death of Monticello, California. To learn about her husbands work and how very committed they were to their causes, was a testament to true dedication and the human spirit. I was intrigued and hypnotized by this film and it's slow and yet strong sense of purpose and presence. She is the woman responsible for the photograph entitled  ""Migrant Mother"". Arguably the most iconic photo of the Depression, and one of the most familiar images of the 20th century.",1416441600,10,834,4.907801418439717

What this doesn't do is focus on her most famous migrant mother  photograph or any of her other well known photographs. It focuses on Dorothea Lange and her art. It focuses on her life and her work. It talks about her work during the depression but it also delves into her life after and some of her activism etc.

I truly enjoyed hearing her words and those words which she collected from the people that she immortalized. There is a very strong bond between the visual and the verbal and she knew how to combine the two to give true depth and humanity for which the viewer benefits.,1515283200,,440,4.653846153846154
