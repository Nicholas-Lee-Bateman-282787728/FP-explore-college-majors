3548733,5,B001EBP3WY,"This is beautiful, tender, sad, funny, heartbreaking and with tension that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Multiple layers of humanity expressed in relationships, in and out of family. Complicated intricacies rare in commercial movies. See it !",1321228800,,252,5.170731707317073
3548734,5,B001EBP3WY,I saw this movie on IFC and loved it. I plan on owning it in the future. It is a heartfelt story of a family trying to run a family restaurant amidst family problems. At times it almost feels like a documentary. It held my interest and has some interesting sub-plots. It is a movie you have to pay attention to in order to connect with the roles. Not a superficial movie. Great film - surpised there are not more positive reviews. I don't know how the Criterion Collection would be since I saw it on tv but I have yet to be disappointed in other Criterion Collection DVD's I have in my collection.,1320278400,,597,4.245614035087719
3548735,5,B001EBP3WY,"What an engaging, amusing and realistic film - from the pacing of conversations, the arguments, the histrionics, the flirting, the gossip, the Sunday dinner - just overall fantastic and delightful. I like the idea of letting the girlfriend & her daughter save the day, having a 61 year old who is pretty fit and has worked 35 years as a shipbreaker/careener collapse after some running around is not realistic... but thoroughly enjoyable and fun overall - loved it!",1316563200,,465,4.9743589743589745
3548736,5,B001EBP3WY,"Abdel Kechiche built a supreme story, pregnant of crude realism and powerful narrative force about the epic efforts of an inmigrant (61) who suddenly i fired from his workplace. He is strong too and really wants to be part of the support of his broken family.

He is divorced and lives well apart, additionally he has a love affair with another woman. So when he is forced to renounce, he won't give up just like that and will undertake a brilliant idea.

But along this interesting proposal, he will have to face with multiple obstacles of all sort: affective, emotional, bureaucratic and existential in order to pave the way until his project can be true.

Powerful, intriguing, desperate and anguish portrait who will engage you from the very beginning of the plot.

Please, don't let it go and go for it.",1306972800,,808,4.709219858156028
3548737,3,B001EBP3WY,"THE SECRET OF THE GRAIN (LA GRAINE ET LE MULET) as written and directed by Abdellatif Kechiche offers the viewer a different version of the importance of family and the need to bond for survival.  Kechiche is known for casting his films with unknown actors (or even fist time actors) and while some may view this as self-indulgent exercise in proving that a film can be made without the aid of a talented cast, others will appreciate the fine performances he is able to draw from both unknowns (Habib Boufares) and stars on the rise (Hafsia Herzi).

The story is fairly straightforward (despite the fact that it takes 2 1/2 hours to tell!): in the Southern France port city of Ste, populated with many French-speaking Arab immigrants who eke out a living repairing boats and fishing, lives senior citizen Slimane Beiji (Habib Boufares) and his friends and family - an ex-wife chronically angry about missed alimony payments, an adulterer son, and girlfriend who satisfies him and also has a daughter Rym (Hafsia Herzl) who adores him.  Slimane struggles with his job, has his hours cut back severely, and together with his friends who also are suffering economically, bond more strongly.  Eventually Slimane comes upon the idea of establishing a restaurant  housed in a deserted old ship that he purchases and with the help from his family and his friends (especially supported by Rym) he opens his restaurant that features the fish with couscous recipe of his ex-wife.

The reason this too-long film ultimately satisfies is the completely spontaneous atmosphere created by director Kechiche: the dialogue feels completely improvised, as though we happen to be passing by  Ste and overheard a colony of down and out immigrants from North Africa transform their fates.  It may take a lot of patience to sit through the first half of the film, but the end result is rewarding.  Grady Harp, September 10",1283990400,7,1900,4.949685534591195
3548738,3,B001EBP3WY,"Enter the immigrant world of Tunisians living in France.  Sometimes, life can be hard for no clear reason.  But this excellent film also makes clear the common ground of human beings no matter the family or origin. Our hopes and concerns are pretty much the same.  This exuberant and bittersweet movie almost reads as a documentary.  I liked the carefully observed interplay between the cultures and a very different angle of being Muslim.  Religion is not the story but an element.

The story centers on the large, loud, belligerent family of Slimane (Habib Boufares), his ex-wife, and their assorted children and grandchildren.  They all live in a ramshackle high-raise housing project.  Slimane lives with his lover and her amazing 20-year-old daughter (Hafsia Herzi), upon whom he dotes.

Slimane works in the shipyards of Ste, a tough French seaport on the Mediterranean.  After decades of toil, he decides to turn an abandoned boat into a dockside restaurant.  It is a quixotic dream at best.  He seems tough, but is fragile.  He thinks his family depends on him and although the reality is opposite, they maintain the deception and dignity of his feelings.
Food abounds in this celebration of family, couscous and fish.  It is messy, despairing, poignant, exhilarating and a feast for the eye and heart.
I loved the explosion of family issues in this engrossing drama and was held in suspense through the climax

Winner of four Csar awards, including best picture and director.  Abdellatif Kechiche's film is a magnificent drama about the everyday joys and hardships of a spirited French-Arab family and a celebration of the role food plays in the immigrant experience.",1283731200,,1676,5.062043795620438

8297513,3,B001EBP3WY,"Film director Abdel Kechiche  became so involved with the footage for the picture  La Graine et le Mulet (The Secret of the Grain)  which tells the story of a big dysfunctional family of Tunisian immigrants in the southern French port town of Sete that he could not part with a smallest parts of it.  He dedicated the film to his father, and I would not be surprised  to find out that  the film characters  with their traditions, everyday problems,  struggles, hopes, and losses  were written by Abdel Kechiche from his own family, and the story he tells was inspired by his own growing up.  The Secret of the Grain is compelling and personal  movie but Kechiche  either should have taken another editor or let them use the scissors without reservation. The movie is long with many  scenes practically begging  of being significantly trimmed. It does not apply to all scenes. Some are amazingly acted, and I would not miss a second of the scene where young  Rym (Hafsia Herzi)  is trying to convince  her mother Lilia to go to the big party in the final part of the film. A newcomer Hafsia Herzi is a born actress, and a good one. She is without a doubt a very promising talent with huge potential but her endless belly-dancing in the final was just that - endless and boring. I get the purpose of the scene but its length and the camera peering at Hafsia's belly for what seems hours, totally kills it.

Kechiche shot the film in Cinma vrit style, and while it works  and lets us actually get to know the characters, overlong monologues and conversations often made me feel like watching a reality talk show which  is a completely different genre altogether. The emotional and powerful monologue of Julia, the long-suffering wife of one of a male characters, would have been  ten times more powerful had it been twice or even trice shorter. Yes, perhaps in reality the neglected young wife and mother would cry and complain even longer than the scene in the film lasts but we the viewers are grownups, we understand, we get it - don't hit us over the head.

The film is a recipient of many Awards including four Csar Awards (Best Film, Best Directing, Best Writing, and Most Promising Actress for Herzi) and it was nominated for Best Editing which really surprised me. I think Kechiche deserved to be recognized and rewarded but I hope that he will be more critical with  his future films. The film creator  should not be afraid of cutting of  all unnecessary parts of his work to let  a hidden  masterpiece inside it breathe freely.",1422576000,,2534,4.610738255033557
