7867105,1,6304242344,"I tried this video on Netflix thinking that I could get a little hot yoga routine in my very own apartment, rather than paying to go to the local studio.  What a mistake!
Yes, the three guys in the video are nice looking and are wearing tiny (I mean micro small!) white thong swimsuits, but the yoga is also barely there.  The monotonous music and dull voice over is a snore fest.
Might be fun to play in the background with the sound off at a bachelorette party, but for yoga instruction, not a good option.",1315612800,,508,4.28125
7867106,1,6304242344,It should be labeled for males with alternative life styles...good thing i don't have little kids..I wish i had checked into this video before I bought it..,1199145600,,156,4.814814814814815
7867107,1,6304242344,"I guess I ""misunderstood"" the ""hot yoga"" thing.  This DVD is totally worthless.",1156723200,6,79,5.076923076923077
7867108,5,6304242344,"Well, it doesn't take a genius to figure out some of these reviews below appear to be written by the competition, or friends of the competition of this product.  I bought ""Better Sex Through Yoga,"" and being honestly frank it is totally boring, and the guys are boring!  This DVD is what it says it is, a very basic yoga program.  However, THESE GUYS ARE HOT!!!  I'm a beginner, this DVD did it for me in more ways than one.  It relaxed me, and the sensuality was HOT!  I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to learn the basics, in a very interesting and non threatening way.  And three gorgeous hunks in athletic jock straps, with many close up's, sure makes it fun. I highly recommend, and have told my friends, and they highly agree.  Great for a party also, it heats up the crowd!",1135814400,6,783,4.3517241379310345
7867109,1,6304242344,"I purchase many yoga tapes and DVDs, and can usually find something of value in all of them. This particular DVD, however, found me challenged to list anything it had going for it -- other than the very good looking male yogis. Still, once you get beyond the buff bods and glistening sweat, there is absolutely no substance to this DVD. If Amazon allowed you to return DVDs after opening them, I'd definitely be returning this one. It is brief beyond belief, with nothing new -- no interesting posture variations, no instructions beyond the most rudimentary and no reason to add it to your collection. A wiser purchase would be ""Better Sex Through Yoga for Gay Men."" It provides a good workout, with yogis that may not be as good looking but inspire you nevertheless.",1097971200,10,767,4.688888888888889
7867110,2,6304242344,"OK, should I be professional about this review?  Were they professional about their ""yoga""?  No.  This is shameless eye candy with little to no educational value.  Still, it doesn't exactly suck to look at it.  The new age soundtrack and ""instructions"" that accompany the scantily-clad muscle boys in their alluring poses is too painful to endure.
If you live in the Seattle area, try accompanying this DVD's visuals with 91.3FM's Friday night blues program.  The yogawannabies and the old skool blues go together alarmingly well!",1082678400,9,530,5.176470588235294
