The dancers are limited in the stage they are on. They are on a raised platform only about nine feet round. The dancers range from expert to master level. There are some great moves in this video. I mean some of the moves I said,""O, my God"". Overall the standard of Tango dancers is highest in this video.  Solo singers, solo dancers, couples, small group dances.  Well worth buying. 50 minutes.",985737600,4,561,4.480392156862745
8174896,5,B00004STEI,"I was skeptical at first about ordering this video because no famous tango dancers or dance companies were mentioned in its production. However, after one viewing I was convinced that this was a true gem among the informative and entertaining dance videos in the market.  The fact that the video was filmed in Argentine allows the viewer to experience the art of tango dancing its true form where it originated. Many of the scenes are designed to allow the viewer to enjoy this graceful dance at its fullest. From the point of view of someone who knows how to tango this video gives the viewer a new perspective on what can be be done, and how far can tango be taken.
I especially recommend this video for those who are searching for a well balanced, artful and dazzling tango dance.",984441600,3,783,4.5928571428571425
