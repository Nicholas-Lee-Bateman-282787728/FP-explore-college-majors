5886661,2,B00E2037DG,It is great having the entire Goodebumps series but the picture quality of the DVDs is extremely poor. I will try returning and replacing...hopefully the picture quality will improve.,1511308800,,183,5.344827586206897
5886662,1,B00E2037DG,To all the reviewers who warned that this was not region free thank you I thought this was region free and had it on my wishlist for years.  I was planning to buy it at some point in time.  Good thing I haven't yet.  Anyway I do have a lot of the DVDs already on the single episode sets and the series is on Netflix which I also have so Ill survive.  It would be nice to have a full complete series box set for the USA though.,1510444800,2,426,3.8068181818181817

5886665,5,B00E2037DG,"It's always a good feeling to relive something amazing from our childhood. For some of us, that instant gratification of nostalgia kicking in - is from shows like Goosebumps! This, and Eerie Indiana always came on, on Saturday mornings! And for those of us with kids, we probably told them that we purchased this dvd set ""for them"". But it wasn't. Not at all, not by a landslide. It's for us children of the 80's & 90's!! :)",1501718400,,424,4.448717948717949
5886666,5,B00E2037DG,the box set covers every episode in the series and cuts down on shelf space,1497225600,3,75,4.066666666666666
5886667,5,B00E2037DG,My grandson just loves to watch this series. It's boy's night treat for us both.,1496880000,,80,4.4
5886668,5,B00E2037DG,Very satisfied with this set. This really brings me back in time to when I watched this show in the 90s on fox kids. I grew up reading the goosebumps books and they were just as fun and creepy as the episodes were. My only rant is that the episodes are not labeled on the discs to where you can see which episode is on which disc. For those of you who love goosebumps don't miss out on buying this DVD set. Too bad kids don't get to see shows like this come on tv these days. Buyer beware you're in for a scare!,1486684800,2,511,3.923076923076923

5886671,5,B00E2037DG,My favorite television series and children's novels. Can't wait to watch it all over again. Such nostalgia. A great classic is finally available at a great low price. One of those 90's shows a child must see and own.,1483747200,,216,4.564102564102564

5886685,4,B00E2037DG,"I'm a potential buyer for this series, my only concern with this set that I've noticed is that Amazon is selling this ""complete"" set with only 4 seasons when Netflix has all 5 seasons. This set is missing 12 episodes including tower of terror 1&2, welcome to the dead house 1&2, etc. unless it's included on the others discs. Wish there was a description on the episodes so I'd know for sure if I'd be getting my money's worth...just saying. Anyone who has the set please snapshot an episode list, I'd appreciate it. Thank you",1473724800,10,526,4.5473684210526315
