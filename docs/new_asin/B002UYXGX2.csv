8381630,4,B002UYXGX2,"I picked up Volume 1 of this show for my 3 year old son a while back in a department store bargain bin and it quickly became his favorite Iron Man. I also enjoy watching the show with him and find the story lines entertaining in both volumes (still need to get the second season, but I think I may wait and buy the whole thing together).

This show features a high school age genius Tony and his friends, so for sticklers to the comics, it may not be a favorite, but it is a lot more kid friendly than some of the other versions.",1364515200,,529,4.038095238095238
8381631,5,B002UYXGX2,My Grandson loves the Ironman cartoon on tv and this follows them and so he can watch wherever he is on his dvd player.,1336780800,,119,4.0
8381632,5,B002UYXGX2,I bought this item for my 5 year old son and he absolutely loves it. I was under the impression that there was 2 volumes of this series and that would complete the season. There's actually 4 volumes so I would recommend buying the complete series in one set as apposed to purchasing the volumes seperatley.,1295222400,2,306,4.482142857142857
8381633,5,B002UYXGX2,"I can't count the number of times my grandson and I have watched these dvds...Vol 1 and Vol 2.  He loves Iron Man and I like the story line of these dvds better than another dvd he has about Iron Man.  Tony, Rhodey and Pepper are kids and it's just fun to watch.  I can't wait to see what's to come in this series.",1291420800,,314,3.875
8381634,3,B002UYXGX2,Tony Stark is a teenager in High School...My son enjoyed that whole concept and it was a good intro to the adult Tony Stark.  Not bad if you're a kid:),1273536000,,151,4.033333333333333
8381635,4,B002UYXGX2,First things first. It's hard to get past that these characters are portrayed as TEENS and NOT adults. If you can get passed it like I have - this is a well done series that is inoffensive and exciting. The animation is very cool and I like that the DVD has so many episodes.,1271808000,,275,4.111111111111111
8381636,5,B002UYXGX2,"Thank you so much.  I pre-ordered this item, and couldn't wait to get it! I have the first Volume and my grandson and husband just love it!  Ironman is a household word here and it's a great gift for the Grandbaby!  Pawpaw is just as excited when Ironman makes a visit!

Thank you Amazon.  I have never been disappointed with your service!
