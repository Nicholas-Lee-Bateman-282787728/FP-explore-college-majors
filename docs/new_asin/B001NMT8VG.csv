8327382,5,B001NMT8VG,"Profiles Featuring Pat Cooper was a good interview. My only nitpick was on the Amazon listing it implies Connie Francis would be featured. She wasn't. On the cover of the DVD she was even mentioned. Actually Pat Cooper must have Opened for her at one time, but on the program it wasn't referred to. Fans of Pat Cooper will like this the most.",1468368000,,342,4.444444444444445
