7470676,5,B016CXWOIY,"I read some where that russell wasn't entirely pleased with how he was portrayed in this and I can understand that. I think it attempts to be honest in its assessment of him, but doesn't fully appreciate the need for his message. It shows everyone fighting his opinions in a way around him. In a lot of ways it makes it look as though his friends don't take him very seriously and then cuts to clips of him defending his views. It skims, how ever, talking about some of the great thing he's actually actually done, such as the trew era cafe and defending the residents of the neighborhood that he helped with saving themselves from losing their homes. I wish it would show more of the reasons he actually can be taken seriously (which he can) than just show casing what he does then running a few clips of people saying oh don't follow him, he's a crazy megalomaniac. He might be a narcissist, but that doesn't mean he isn't right.",1449273600,5,931,4.4186046511627906

7470678,5,B016CXWOIY,Such an interesting human being. Great documentary about our inate capacity for change.,1449100800,,87,5.769230769230769
7470679,5,B016CXWOIY,I love Russell brand and his story and honesty and vision. He is a shining example that everyone has the opportunity to wake up.,1449100800,2,128,4.375
7470680,5,B016CXWOIY,"This film is honest, sweet, funny, and touching.  Russell proves that you can change your life through will power, determination, and talent.  He is also sharing a very important truth.  Your happiness won't come from outside you.  You cannot appease a spiritual need with sex, drugs, or Hollywood.  You have to be brave enough to face what is causing your anxiety and empty feeling.  There is nothing wrong with goals, but at some point you must realize that life is about connection and relationships and not just endless pursuit of goals. Those that are more blessed materially can help others.  Those whose voices are more listened to can speak up for truth and positive change. Maybe we can change the world, even if it is one person at a time.  Even if we just start with ourselves.  It takes courage, but it is possible.",1448755200,11,827,4.6875
7470681,5,B016CXWOIY,"Very earnest effort; Brand is willing to go out on a limb for what he believes in. He's also very honest about his struggles with his personal demons. Though he may be slightly mad, he also gets it on a much higher level. Definitely a must-see.",1448668800,8,244,4.326086956521739
7470682,5,B016CXWOIY,"Whether you love Brand or hate him this is an incredible character piece that gives a deep look into the mind and journey of a comedian, writer and performer that has impacted a generation. Shining light on his strengths and weaknesses. If you enjoy a good documentary this is well worth a watch.",1448668800,8,296,4.60377358490566
7470683,4,B016CXWOIY,"This is an interesting look at an insane man who is trying to do good on this planet.  His lifeless conformity and empty obligations within a marriage to Katy Perry.  His deep anguish at seeing the horrors of poverty in Africa set against his own ""celebrity"" world of riches and waste.  His conveyor belt of addictions and mistakes on display for all.  And his spiritual search / escape route.  Very inspiring.

Brand is honest and out of his mind, but he's on our side.  He is incredibly straightforward about his flaws and his dreams.  Like a Rock n Roll pervert Peter Pan, Russell walks through life bringing levity to serious issues.  And his personal ""brand"" of magic to the stuck-up, rigid, hateful establishment in media and politics.

Here on display for you is a frighteningly flawed man with a deeply loving soul.  He just may change the world.  One viewer at a time.

Lots of food for thought in this movie.  Watch it.",1464739200,6,929,4.619631901840491

7470688,1,B016CXWOIY,"I bought two different Blu-ray and neither would play in the player. The first one had finger prints all over it straight out of the package. Played a different blu-ray and that movie played right away, so I know it's not the Blu-ray. Would not buy again.",1460937600,2,255,4.446808510638298
7470689,5,B016CXWOIY,An excellent look into the life and mind of a brillant man. His takes on materialism and spirituality are definitely worth sharing and spreading.,1459382400,2,145,5.083333333333333

7470698,4,B016CXWOIY,"Russell Brand is so fascinating to listen to. His almost poetic like full-bodied dialog seriously turns my brain right up. He's usually on 10 (I suspect ADHD) an has such a wake the hell up and listen to what he has to say way with linking words together, and the chap is quite funny on top of it, and sexy no doubt too, and is trying to stand up for a few things he believes in. I would really like to see more of him.",1452211200,4,419,3.9411764705882355

7470700,5,B016CXWOIY,"Truly insightful. I did not appreciate how much work Brand has put into his idea of Revolution before watching this. Funny, inpirational, and sad at times. Worth a rental.",1451433600,4,171,4.931034482758621
7470701,3,B016CXWOIY,"It was just ok. I'm a big Russel Brand fan and most of this you can just watch on youtube.

Go check out his new documentary the emperor's new clothes. That's a better use of your time.",1451001600,2,185,4.0

8736319,4,B016CXWOIY,"This is not what I was looking for.  The last thing I wanted to see is a biopic about Brand.  I wanted to see a stand-up show and i couldn't get Messiah Complex streaming, anywhere.  So my mistake.  Alright.  Rolls eyes.  Meh.  Eh.  Okay, it's cute.  He's clever.  He's got good energy.  He's self-effacing. Turns out it was enjoyable.  I'm glad I watched it.",1516060800,,359,4.4375

8736325,5,B016CXWOIY,"It's a pity she had to edit out so much personal content to spare his emotional response, but it is still a really good documentary.
The parts he did not want people to see make him so much more credible and awesome.",1472256000,2,216,4.166666666666667
8736326,5,B016CXWOIY,"Nice portrait of a very atypical celebrity personality. He's no Messiah and I don't think he's going to start a revolution but a good percentage of what he says is very intelligent and good for people to hear, especially if you're young or not too set in your ways.",1468627200,,265,4.428571428571429
