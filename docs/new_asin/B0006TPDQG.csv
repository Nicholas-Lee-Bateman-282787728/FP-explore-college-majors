2194827,3,B0006TPDQG,"Crossplot is a modestly entertaining diversion that didn't make much noise back in 1969 but did, in a roundabout way, inspire The Persuaders when co-producers Roger Moore and Robert S. Baker decided to go back to television. It's another wrong man comedy thriller that sees Moore's womanising advertising exec tricked into tracing model Claudie Lange for a group of assassins (Martha Hyer, Francis Matthews and Dudley Sutton among them) and then framed for murder in case he stumbles onto their latest plot himself. Offering vintage cars, stately homes, assassination plots, Roger Moore's famously awkward run and some of the very worst backprojection and backdrops ever seen in a colour film, it's undemanding comfort viewing, though in its favour it does have one neat frameup and chopper chase, a good supporting turn from Alexis Kanner and the sight of Roger Moore briefing Bernard Lee in one scene a few years before Lee would spend the last years of his career briefing Moore. The kind of film that probably works better on TV than it did on the big screen it's nothing you need to seek out but a decent enough timewaster if you do stumble across it.

MGM/UA's NTSC DVD offers a decent non-anamorphic widescreen transfer with the original trailer.",1351555200,,1253,4.9952153110047846
2194828,5,B0006TPDQG,Such a great British movie from a future James Bond actor (before his roles in 007). Roger Moore is great in this action and thriller type movie. Claudie Lange is great and beautiful in this movie starring alongside with Roger. This is a must have for a fan of Roger Moore.,1316044800,,273,4.372549019607843
2194829,1,B0006TPDQG,"Ten years after Alfred Hitchcock's 1959 classic ""North By Northwest,"" these British theives think they can steal that movie's famous auction scene? How stupid do they think their audience is.  Let's recap Hitchcock's scene:  Cary Grant is being pursued by thugs and gets cornered in an auction house during a live auction.  To save himself and get out of this bad situation, he starts to mock the setting and the people in it, including the people around him and the auctioneer.  The police are called, and Cary gets away safely.  So what do the ""Crossplot"" writers do ten years later?  Why, they decide to steal that idea and scene.  Oh, but so cleverly, like all plagiarists WHO ARE THIEVES, they ""change"" the setting.  Instead of Hitchcock's auction house, Crossplot's PLAGIARISTS use a church.  Instead of a live auction, Crossplots PLAGIARISTS use a wedding.  Moore becomes Grant, and the same routine is pulled.  This is just plain theft, nothing else.  Here I am 41 years later and STILL I can see the blatant plagiarism.  Plagiarists always think they'll fool people, but it never works because there will always be someone out there that is able to catch them at it.  By they way, this stolen scene gives a chance for the viewer to compare directly Grant Vs. Moore...and there is just no comparison.  Moore loses that matchup.  It ain't even close, folks.  We learn Cary Grant was the far superior actor.  Moore doesn't even come close to pulling it off like Grant did.  I might add that before this scene, I started getting ""North By Northwest"" connections from this THIEVERY OF A MOVIE...such as the camera angles looking down a building (just like Hitchcock's brilliant camera work from the top of the UN building in NYC, and also the positioning of the girl and camera angles when she is being pushed off a building - just like Hitchcock's camera shots and angles of Eva Marie Saint at the edge of Mt. Rushmore about to fall).  If you want to support plagiarism then by this movie.  Oh, and let's look at some more flaws.  That chase scene in the old car by the helicopter....the MOST CHEESIEST I have ever seen in all of movies, and I've seen some doosies.  What a joke.  Stupid.  And does anybody know or even think that a helicopter is capable of hovering motionless mid-air?  It doesn't have to make pass after pass by target on the ground like an airplane does.  But yet here we have it:  a thug in the copter with an automatic weapon can't manage to hit an unarmed silly little 1920 car because the helo can't manage to just hover still in mid-air and let him take the shot?  Oh, no, the helo must ""fly past"" each time.  Stupid.  This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  A complete joke.  Sorry I wasted my money on it.  Don't fall for the other reviews here.  Don't waste your money on this one.",1291852800,,2825,4.570858283433134
2194830,3,B0006TPDQG,"Not a particularly good movie, but not particularly awful either.  It has some delightfully silly/cheesy moments, and if you are a Roger Moore fan you will definitely get a kick out of it.",1245628800,2,188,4.696969696969697
2194831,5,B0006TPDQG,"Recently, we read Roger Moore's book ""My Word is my Bond"" and thanks to this excellent biography of all the work accomplished by Roger Moore, we became familiar with movies we had never seen by our favorite... Bond, James Bond. So, we are trying to see all his films.

In Crossplot, Roger Moore stars with Claudie Lange, who plays the part of a model by the name of Marla Kugash, in what is a prelude to a Bond movie.

The movie is filmed in London, providing wonderful scenery from that lovely city as the stars encounter all sorts of troubles. Roger Moore plays the part of a Marketing executive who is always after the ladies. He tries to get one of his ladies into an ad campaign but finds himself involved with Marla Kugash, whose picture is planted in his portfolio by total strangers who want him to find this model for them because they fear she overheard a plot they have concocted to eliminate a high ranking official.

As with Bond films, the action is packed, the suspenseful plot is riveting and the filming is gorgeous as we travel through the manicured country side of England. Seeing Bernard Lee play a part in this movie was rather fun for he was the character ""M"" from 1962 through 1979, playing in many of the films during Roger Moore's time as James Bond.

Thanks to Roger Moore's book, My Word is my bond; we have found this movie which we did not know existed. Reading Roger Moore's book has opened the door to a new way to enjoy these films because we know the tid-bits of information that would otherwise go unnoticed, making the film more interesting and enjoyable.

If you enjoy film history, read the book and keep a list of the movies mentioned by Moore. See these through the eyes of the actor, sometimes director, and you will find yourselves immersed in a world of fun travel opportunities. Don't miss it!",1234569600,19,1836,4.518072289156627
2194832,3,B0006TPDQG,"This 1969 feature was Sir Roger Moore's first film after finishing his long running role as Simon Templar on the television series `The Saint'.  Crossplot, has many `Saintly' influences as producer Robert S. Baker, director Alvin Rakoff, and writers Leigh Vance and John Kruse, were all involved in the series.  Filmed at Elstree Studios, with Moore as a co-producer, the film very much has the look and flavor of a Saint adventure, only without Simon Templar.

Roger Moore is Gary Fenn, a good natured and fun loving London advertising executive.  Due to some deception, Fenn is bent on locating a missing Hungarian model, one Marla Kugash (Claudie Lange), for an advertising campaign.  Without knowing it, the lovely Miss Kugash is a key figure in a criminal conspiracy, and there are those who would like very much to find her, and keep her from revealing what she may know.

The story has twists and turns that lead to unexpected places, and though the journey may not always make sense, it's fun to follow along with Fenn and Kugash.  The action highlight features a helicopter chasing a vintage roadster across the countryside, with predictable results.  Claudie Lange's comic ability, charm, and chemistry with her leading man, make the film worth watching.  Marla's Aunt, a television director, is played by Martha Hyer.  Bernard Lee, `M' in the James Bond films, appears with Sir Roger, the future Bond to be, for the first time.

Not a great film by any means, but worth a look if you like Roger Moore, or British light adventure comedies.  The double-sided disc contains both letterbox and fullscreen versions.  Crossplot is subtitled, scored by composer Stanley Black, and the title credits song `I'll Find My Love' is sung by John Rowles.",1220054400,11,1751,4.955479452054795
2194833,5,B0006TPDQG,"This is a wonderful, over-looked film made by star Moore between The Saint and The Persuaders. Actually, the technical credits are similar to both these series, and it seems at times like a longer episode of either of them at times, but that's no bad thing. The plot is standard ""39 Steps"" territory -- innocent man on the run from cops and villians. However, it's done in a great 60s style, reminiscent of ""Charade"" and ""Arabesque"". OK, it's not quite in that class (it does look as if it was shot for TV), and some of the back projection is decidedly ropey, but it's a thrilling ride back through the sort of adventure series and films the British used to make well in the past and sadly don't make any more. If you liked the old ITC series of the 60s, or Moore in his prime, then this is a great reminder of how good they could be at their best. And don't forget to watch out for the helicopter chase -- it's a corker that would grace a film with a much bigger budget. The UK cast is great, too. Watch out particularly for Francis Matthews (the voice of the original Captain Scarlet and Paul Temple on TV).",1114128000,37,1109,4.311004784688995
8043065,4,B0006TPDQG,"Roger Moore delivers another appealing performance. One of so many. Whether it is drama or comedy, he does it so well. This movie offers both. There are a lot of appealing characters in this movie, but the one that stood out the most, for me, was the one played by the beautiful actress, Claudie Lange. This is a very enjoyable movie.",1523750400,,334,4.491803278688525

8043067,2,B0006TPDQG,"Misfired blend of comedy, romance and thriller wants to be something along the lines of Charade or Arabesque but fails pretty miserably, never really generating much in the way of suspense or amusement.  The plot has something to do with a playboy advertising executive (Roger Moore) who is tricked into making a wannabe model (Claudie Lange) the centerpiece of an important campaign.  You see nefarious forces want to kill this woman and are using Roger Moore to find her.  We assume this has something to do with the opening sequence in which a friend of hers is murdered and she is given a newspaper to pass on to somebody else.

In one of the script's most head scratching miscalculations, this woman apparently has no idea that her friend was murdered, which would seem to be impossible considering that she was there just before it happened and narrowly escaped herself.  She doesn't even seem to have the slightest clue that her life is in danger, which makes her a completely oblivious idiot and causes the thriller elements in Crossplot to take way too long to kick in.

Lead actress Claudie Lange feels like a poor man's Sophia Loren, which is probably appropriate considering that Crossplot feels like a poor man's Charade or Arabesque.  She has no onscreen chemistry with Roger Moore at all, barely seems to be able to act, but still seems an appropriate fit for the subpar material.  Roger Moore's character isn't much of a stretch from the one he played on The Saint, but he does have enough screen presence to keep Crossplot more or less watchable, even though it's never actually good.

If you are a fan of the comedy-thrillers this might be a passable enough diversion, although it's mediocre enough to make something like Foul Play feel like a masterpiece by comparison.  Curious Roger Moore fans who haven't already seen this one will also surely want to give it a look--but Crossplot is far from one of his better efforts.  Based on this film if he hadn't lucked into the James Bond role four years later (Timothy Dalton who is a far more skilled actor was offered the part first but turned it down) Roger Moore would very likely be a largely forgotten TV actor today.  He even had a failed TV program (The Persuaders!) between this film and Live and Let Die.",1496275200,,2279,4.712846347607053
