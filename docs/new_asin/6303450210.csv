652947,5,6303450210,"I have worked with children in three different day-cares where the wee sing tapes were used.  The children all seem glued to the t.v.  I have seen all of the wee sing videos and I think Sillyville out ranks them all. The  day-care I currently work at does not have this particular one.  They have  The Big Rock Candy Mountain and the children all love it.  I am going to  buy Sillyville for my own son and try to get the day-care to purchase it as  well.  I have been trying to find this video for the past three years.  My  mom had a copy that she loaned to someone and she never got it back.  We  also had at one time The Wee Sing Train, this one was a big hit with the  children too.  Eventually I hope to own all of the Wee Sing videos.",930096000,12,740,3.938775510204082
653040,5,6303450210,"I used to LOVE watching Wee Sing in Sillyville!!  I happened to come across this online, and one of the songs popped into my head.  I probably haven't watched it in ten years, but somehow I still remember the songs.  And the kids from the movie seemed so cool back then!  But Sillyville was a huge part of my movie-watching as a kid, and I recommend it to anyone with little kids, or even little siblings.",1104969600,,405,4.2894736842105265
653041,5,6303450210,"As a child, Wee Sing in Sillyville was my favorite movie. I would watch it very often and I loved the music. I can remember most of the songs, even now. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone for their children because it left an impact on me as a child.",1087257600,,265,4.115384615384615
653042,5,6303450210,I think that wee sing in sillyville is the greatest kids movie because it is up beat and a good way to learn how to treat people that are not exsactly like you or me. I have seen this movie maybe 25 times. (...) I think every kids should see this movie.,1080345600,,253,3.8846153846153846
653043,5,6303450210,"I watched this movie all the time because it was so interesting and it felt like a whole nother world.  It really did teach me the lesson that color and other things don't matter.  It is the best movie for all kids, I still watch it (lol).  The songs are catchy and will stick with you forever.  The video is also great for family to watch and sing together.  If ever I had to pick my all time favorite movie I would surely pick Wee Sing In Sillyville.  So if you are doughtfull about getting this video for a kid you know, just take my word for it and get this video.  It is an expierience for a youngster like no other.",1078012800,,621,4.040983606557377
653044,5,6303450210,"I ABSOLUTELY love this video!!  I first saw it when I was a mother's helper for two little boys and could not get the songs out of my head from the first day that I heard it.  Years later, I became a teacher in a daycare center, and decided to purchase the video to show to my toddler-aged class.  To my amazement, the ENTIRE class sat still for the entire movie, even my hyperactive student!!  Even after watching it many times, whenever they heard that the video was coming on, they all would gather around the tv and sit quietly.  It is a must have if you have children of any age.",1068508800,5,584,4.178571428571429
653045,5,6303450210,"I have a two year old son and a three year old daughter this movie has saved my sanity more than once. It has also testsed it a few times also.  I think the prices are alittle to steep for a 30 minute movie,but if if saves you all like it dose me me then by all means.",1060041600,,268,3.6206896551724137
653046,5,6303450210,"It all started when my older cousin was little and she got Wee Sing in Sillyville.  Then it went to my other cousin, and then I got it.  I loved it when I was little! All my relatives couldn't take it, but I used to watch it a million times.  Now the tape is about 20 years old, and we dug it out of the closet for my 2 year old sister.  Just today my 12yearold cousin and I, 15, were watching it with my little sister, and we found ouselves singing along to old and almost forgotten songs. It's practically a tradition in my family to watch a video about two kids, Lori and Scott, who are transported into a magical world and meet almost-too-loony Sillywhim. I don't know how I'll ever get those songs out of my head now!",1059955200,5,722,4.099290780141844
653107,5,6303450210,"I love this video! I wish they would make more videos about Sillyville and the characters featured in this video! I know that is not practical, since it was made in 1998 and kids grow up too fast, but I love the video! Buy it for your kids, they will love it too!",1057968000,,263,3.981132075471698

I thought I had forgotten the words by now.... it's a great tape for any age (if they're a kid at heart) and it will take the viewer through an amazing world of imagination and fun. ^_^",1055808000,,325,4.015384615384615
653109,5,6303450210,I was so happy when i had found this sing a long. I have a daughter getting ready to turn a year old and when i was a kid I had this sing a long and thought it was the best one that i remember that i had to have it for my daughter. I must say my husband thought i was nuts when i was looking for it then when he found out what the name was but i know my daughter will love it.,1054598400,,376,3.383720930232558
653110,5,6303450210,"My son, who is 9 now, used to watch this video all day. I recently heard a song from the video and instantly remembered many of the catchy tunes.

Great fun and a good message for the kids in your life. Warning: you'll be singing John Jacob Jingleheimer Scmidt in the shower!

653112,5,6303450210,"My daughter and I have enjoyed ""Sillyville"" for many years.  We started watching it when she was three.  We shared it with our daycare and now the outside cover is so warn that there isn't enough left of it to cover the tape.  The daycare has had it for over 7 years and only lets US borrow our tape once in a while as it is so popular with the children.  We have decided to buy another tape and let the daycare keep enjoying our old one!  My daughter is 10 now and still says that ""Sillyville"" is one of her all time favorites!!

7847680,5,6303450210,"Wee Sing Sillyville is on of the best children's video's I have ever seen.  It has a good lesson while being entertaining and fast moving. My 3 children had watched it so often that we are on our third tape.  At 12, my daughter will still sometimes put it on while she is working on a project for the background music!",1274745600,,318,4.19672131147541
7847681,5,6303450210,I have used this video in my music classroom for more than 20 years in my 30 year teaching career and needed to find a replacement in case of the unthinkable break in the tape. It is perfect and I will be able to continue to show it til I retire and then give it to someone else who can use it for another 20 years! The children love it and sing along with all the songs. It teaches more in 60 minutes than I can in a whole year!,1244937600,,429,3.7777777777777777

7847683,5,6303450210,"i had this movie as a kid. the first time i saw it i was 5 years old, and i was home sick from school with the stomach flu. i was bored and found this tape on the shelf. i watched it. i loved it up until the wump-that thing scared me half to death. well, not really, but i was very scared of that thing. i did not watch this movie again until i was 8. by then i had gotten over my fear of the wump. but i was OBSESSED with the jingleheimers. i used to run around pretending i was a jingleheimer, and insisting that my friends and i played leapfrog at recess. it was cute...until one of my friends got hurt. then this tape got sold in a yard sale when i was 12. i was in tears. now i'm 14 and i'm seeing a whole new meaning in this movie. teenagers can benefit from this movie as well, because the message in it is important in saying that prejudice and racism is wrong. i recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys silliness mixed with an important message.",1139788800,,956,3.984375
7847684,5,6303450210,"I used to LOVE this movie when I was younger.  My friends and I watched this and Grandpa's Magical Toys, another highly recommended Wee Sing movie, repeatedly.
