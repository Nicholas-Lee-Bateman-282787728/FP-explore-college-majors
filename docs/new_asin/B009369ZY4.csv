I was hoping for more 'actual' real life stories, not just documentation about Angels. I have a lot of respect for those who appeared in Angel Stories there are awesome people of God in Angel Stories. Nothing against any of the speakers at all. However, I would recommend Angel Stories to anyone, who has questions about Angels.",1366502400,,454,4.536585365853658

8535076,5,B009369ZY4,"My husband and I had purchased this DVD to see what it was all about.
We were blown away of all the true experiences these reputable people
have encountered with angels. It definately raised our faith level
after viewing this DVD. We love how Jon Nixon has put this film together.
We highly reccomend this DVD to everyone.",1355011200,9,322,4.568965517241379
