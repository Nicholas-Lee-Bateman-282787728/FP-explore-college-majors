7796414,1,1563881357,"Save your money.  This videotape is not worth the shipping cost let alone the money paid for it.  It is only a half hour long, and out of that, there is very little location information.  There are a lot of random shots with no audio.  So much for the sounds in the title of this tape.  Most of the video has no explanation of where the scene is.  The many shots of people have no explanation of who they are. There is no continuity of locations. The production quality is worse than amateurish.  We know no more about South America now than before we watched the tape.  Do not buy it.",1136332800,8,585,4.207207207207207
