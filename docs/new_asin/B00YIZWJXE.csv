8718439,5,B00YIZWJXE,"The best part about this film is Jacqui Holland & Sarah Hunter! Jacqui is so cute in everything she does, such a takented (and sexy:) actress. Really hope to see more of her in the future. And Sarah as the Vampire Slayer is right on point. Still fantasizing about her in lingerie to this day. Those two alone make this movie worth ordering and enjoying over & over again!",1440633600,9,371,4.391304347826087
