6491218,2,B00LMBUS4O,"Please, please, please, advertise this film correctly... IT'S A FOREIGN FILM WITH HORRIBLE MOMENTS!!! My review: WAITING, WAITING, WAITING... fizzled out! The Trailer does not have dialogue so we buy and ""Shoot!!!"" it's subtitle mania... Which if I had known wouldn't have deterred me from getting this film, but...",1414800000,9,315,5.448979591836735

8666591,3,B00LMBUS4O,ordered this by pure curiousity. This was filmed in Spanish. Interesting movie.,1512950400,,79,5.666666666666667
8666592,1,B00LMBUS4O,"The squad moves at a snail's pace.  Although that doesn't really matter because it never gets anywhere.  It's awful and boring.  After the first few times where the music crescendos with ominous intent but then nothing happens, the viewer will realize that there is nothing going on of any interest in this movie and there will not be for its duration.  The setting is one of the few positive aspects of the film.  In mountains where there is often heavy fog cover, there is a palpable feeling of dread conveyed to the viewer.  The problem is that The Squad never takes advantage of this somber and mysterious setting.  It's wasted.  The movie is boring and you'll be bored.  Do not bother.",1507161600,,690,4.636363636363637

8666594,5,B00LMBUS4O,"scream factory does it again with another quality release, plenty of extra goodies. (I'm not going to review the movie, as we have all seen it before) this is definitely a collectors edition Blu Ray with nice packaging and lots of extras... If your going to collect movies and you love horror then you cant go wrong with Scream Factory",1486771200,,335,4.6
8666595,4,B00LMBUS4O,As other reviewers have pointed out this is actually a foreign language film with English subtitle. The film seems to be a low budget affair but is well done. The story is a military themed with a mystery narrative. Overall I enjoyed it.,1461283200,,237,4.534883720930233
8666596,1,B00LMBUS4O,I can't even find words to really express how bad this was. I'm embarrassed to be admitting to people I don't even know that I spent money to actually watch this. Believe me....$1.00 would be spending too much.,1448323200,,210,4.552631578947368

8666599,1,B00LMBUS4O,"look guys when you review a movie. give a little info so we can decide if we wanna watch it. the trailer doesn't say what its about, none of you say what its about is it a ghost movie, a zombie flick, about hallucinations. is the acting good is it scary. is it actually a drama. that's mislabeled. cause of you guys I'm just gonna download it somewhere else. if it is good you just lost the makers of it money. next time give some useful info. and the makers of the trailer should have been clearer. they cost the movie money also.",1418601600,9,531,4.165048543689321
