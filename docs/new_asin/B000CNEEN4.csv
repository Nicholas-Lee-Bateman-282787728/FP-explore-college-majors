8099423,4,B000CNEEN4,"The opening 3 way bout was not great but pretty good. The tag team match between Rockin Rebel & Jack Victory against Blue Meanie & Roadkill was slow but had a nice twist at the end. The Sabu-Jerry Lynn match was great,back-and-forth bout and a good reminder of thier ECW match. The Joey Matthews-Raven-3PW title match was a hard-hitting brawl. The Matt Striker-Rob Eckos match was dumb as Surf Ninjas and slow as snails. The CJ O'Doyle-""Pit Bull"" Gary Wolfe-TLC match was ok but nothing special. AJ Styles-Christtopher Daniels match was a high-tech,hard-hitting,back-and-forth showstealer. The DVD Bonus match between Kid Kash & Syxx Pac was solid but not great. I give this dvd a 7 out of 10",1303344000,,692,4.872881355932203
8099424,4,B000CNEEN4,"This is the 2nd time I have seen a 3PW event. I remember the first time I was expecting a hardcore DVD, but instead got a stiff hitting, and high flying matches. The announcers are good. However when they give the wrestlers a mike, its impossible to hear them.

Mike Kruel vs Damian Adams vs Ruckus- Not bad action but it was a very short match. Nice high spot at the end of the match. Grade C+

Rockin Rebel & Jack Victory- Blue Meanie & Roadkill- Ok match, slow moving Meanie trying to be funny. The match was starting to get good and then a suprising turn ended the match. Grade C

Sabu vs. Jerry Lynn- Great match, both of these guys traded hold for hold. It reminded me of a classic ECW match. Sabu had a sick landing through a table. Grade A-

Joey Matthews vs. Raven ( 3PW Championship)- This was another very good match. It was a very hard hitting affair with both men pulling off all the stops to try to win. I loved how Raven sold his leg injury the whole match. The finish could have been better. Grade B+

Matt Striker vs Rob Eckos- Striker has a ""Eugene"" gimmick where he is imitating other wwe super stars. This didn't work for Eugene it doesn't seem to be working for Striker. The match is ok but then it gets interrupted. Grade C

CJ O'Doyle vs. Gary Wolfe (TLC Match)- O'Doyle reminded me of a Mikey Whipwreck, that wasn't supposed to win. He took a huge beating but showed his toughness and stayed alive. It was an ok match but nothing too spectacular. Grade C+

AJ Styles vs. Christopher Daniels (No Time Limit)- Just a spectacular wrestling match. These are 2 of the best in the business and this match shows why. It was a great combo of technical wrestling, hard hitting power moves, and high flying. Grade A

Kid Kash vs. Syxx Pac- Solid match, both wrestlers went at it. It seemed like Syxx was hurting because he was limping a lot and coming up lame. Still he put on a decent show. Grade B

The DVD had some of the jobbers in quick matches. It was nice to see some of the best matches to last a majority of the time. This was another enjoyable DVD, and I would recommend getting it. Overall Grade B",1190073600,,2122,4.271820448877805
