8374963,5,B002NDEE2C,Cruising gay sex in backrooms and alleyways. Just like the good old gays in Griffith Park,1506556800,,89,4.625
8374964,1,B002NDEE2C,"I'm not sure I could make a worse movie if I tried. I don't understand why anyone would actually finance this garbage. Clearly, the producers, director, cinematographer, writers, and actors need to choose a different hobby because they are wasting their time with movie-making. What's that you say, they want to be professional movie makers? I would actually pay them not to make movies. And the last question is this; why on Earth is Amazon Prime wasting time with this dog poo?",1504915200,,479,4.853658536585366
8374965,4,B002NDEE2C,"It's a fun romp through 3 stories about coping with desire.  There's a bit of humor, but it's mostly just hot and dark.  If that's your thing, you'll like it.",1357689600,,158,4.233333333333333
8374966,1,B002NDEE2C,"The actors and story line were poor and uninteresting,beforyou buy this DVD you need to know its not a sex moive.",1338854400,,113,4.428571428571429
8374967,2,B002NDEE2C,"I did not find the film enjoyable or worthwhile. It had no redeeming values. The actors and story line were poor and uninteresting,.",1276646400,2,132,4.782608695652174
8374968,1,B002NDEE2C,"uggg - how do these movies get produced??? OK Lots of Hot Naked Male Eye Candy to ogle at and plenty of full frontal and soft porn sex scenes, but the film making, scripts and acting are terrible!!! These soft porn ""movies"" are always so disappointing; I mean if you're going to make a terrible ""sex movie"", make a porno - at least with porn you don't have to produce an academy award winning story, as most people just jump to the sex scenes anyways, but at least with porn you're getting ""hard core"" sex scenes with a money shot - these movies you sit through an unbelievably bad film and there is no prize for your effort. I will be leery of anything produced by Hornbill productions...",1271289600,5,689,4.390625
8374969,5,B002NDEE2C,"Before I get pummeled with random produce, I'll get it out of the way and say that yes, I am in the movie. I play the killer in the segment ""In Deep."" I had a good time working with Toby Ross and think the movie, as a whole, came out as he had intended being well-geared for his audience and a very enjoyable watch for those that may be new to his work. Each segment has its own unique tone and gauges the mind for different reasons. Ross has been working in the business for a long time and this title shows why he is very good at what he does.",1263513600,6,545,3.918918918918919
8374970,1,B002NDEE2C,"Boring, stupid and a waste of money.  Do not be fooled by the trailer, this collection of three stories is neither erotic or suspenseful. They are just stupid.  The first story would have been much more interesting if the people involved could actually act.  The second and third stories are just junk, with even worse acting.  Don't spend your money on this this.",1261872000,4,364,4.73015873015873
