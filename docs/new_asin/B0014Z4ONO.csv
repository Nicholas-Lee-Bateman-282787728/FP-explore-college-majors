8256636,5,B0014Z4ONO,"The Bleach anime series is very popular in the US, Europe, and Asia. It teaches valuable lessons to youth and adults, e.g., loyalty to friends, overcoming evil, healing, and a sense of camaraderie, as well as forgiving and becoming friends with people we fight with, in real life. I recommend this series to youth and adults who come to me for counseling. Kubo Tite who writes it is a true modern genius, and for those who cannot afford the dvd prices, it is available each week on the web, up to episode 179, and further. Highly recommended, for all ages.",1215388800,,556,4.57
8256637,4,B0014Z4ONO,"The Soul Reaper captains really haven't done much yet except have meetings, and break up fights between hysterical lieutenants.

Fortunately, ""Bleach Volume 10"" finally breaks that trend, and we find out why people are supposed to be so scared of the captains. And as Ichigo and his friends encounter some terrifying new obstacles, we're treated to plenty of blood-soaked battles and a shocking new revelation about Rukia Kuchiki.

Chad makes it to a gateway near Rukia's cell, where he encounters the floral-coated, sake-chugging Captain Shunsui. But when Shunsui refuses to let Chad pass, the powerful teenager finds out how dangerous this captain really is. As they clash explosively, Chad thinks back on his past -- on his grandfather's shaping influence on his life, how he met Ichigo, and the two promises that have changed his life forever...

But Ichigo is battling an even more deadly opponent -- and when he tries to finish the fight quickly, Zaraki stabs him and breaks his sword Zangetsu. Facing death and failure, Ichigo goes into his inner world with Zangetsu's spirit -- and fights his own inner darkness. To defeat Zaraki, he will have to rely on his closest ally -- his own sword.

Things aren't going too well for Ganju and Hanataro either -- they manage to make it to Rukia's cell, only to have Ganju reveal a horrifying secret from Rukia's past. Even worse, Byakuya arrives uses his lethal powers on Ganju, and is only narrowly stopped from killing him. But no one expected another rescuer to come flying in to help his friends....

If the last ""Bleach"" DVD didn't have much forward momentum till the end, the tenth DVD more than makes up for that, because it hardly slows down anywhere. The first couple episodes are filled with bloody sword fights, explosive violence (Chad destroys a whole building with his super fist), and the desperate feeling that our heroes are just being toyed with by far more powerful warriors.

And things don't get much lighter after that, with Ichigo battling his inner Hollow, and Ganju being getting half shredded by Byakuya. Even the flashbacks tend to be rather dark. But the writers do sprinkle in some lighter moments, such as Shunsui's attempt to make a dramatic entrance in a shower of cherry blossoms (""Let's drink, like friends""), or Ichigo and Rukia's bombastic argument. (""Why don't you just go sit down and tremble in fear and cry out, 'Save me, save me!' like you're supposed to?"")

Since his friends have all had their pasts revealed and dealt with, Chad gets most of the character development in this particular volume -- through flashbacks we get to see how he became the gentle giant he is now, and how he and Ichigo became friends. And we discover Yoruichi's true identity near the end -- and boy is it a shock for poor Ichigo. Just look at his face after Yoruichi transforms.

We also get to know a bit more about the Soul Reaper captains -- Zaraki's rough, deadly past is revealed, as well as how he adopted that creepy little pink-haired girl. Shunsui proves to be a nice guy with a very buttoned-up lieutenant. And we're introduced to Rukia's former captain as well -- a sickly hottie named Ukitake, who seems like the closest thing that our heroes have to a Soul Reaper ally.

The tenth ""Bleach"" volume really revs things up, and it promises to only get better in the episodes to come. Definitely a must-see.",1204934400,13,3383,4.789022298456261
