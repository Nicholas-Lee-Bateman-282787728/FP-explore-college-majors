426200,3,6302132894,"Any fans of campy movies like ""Army of Darkness"" and ""Wing Commander"" and TV series like Voltron and Transformers should love it. Similar fans of computer games like Mech Warrior should also appreciate this movie. Decent special effects, casting, directing, and music make it better than many B movies like those previewed before the movie. The best parts of the movie are the robot fight scenes, but even the storyline isn't bad.

We find our hero surrounded by ""tubies"", young men and women that have been created in test tubes for the express purpose of being robot jocks. He witnesses the ninth member loss of the Market team which he represents, to their nemesis the Confederation. The Confederation team led by a baddy with a Russian accent that kills people indiscriminately. It seems the Markets secret weapons are being sold to the Confederation by a spy.

The finale shows the spy exposed and a battle royale of the two mechs of the Confederation and Market. One can only hope this comes out on DVD since it is far more fun to watch than many of the others I have seen released. Let's hope Columbia Pictures makes it available soon.",1073865600,,1142,4.733668341708543
426201,4,6302132894,"I'd have to start with a contraction since that's what I'm reminded of seems to be a movie spin off of some 70's and 80's cartoon legends such as Voltron and Robotech (Macross, for the new generation). Over all Great fights, good fxs for early 90's release, a couple familar faces and good story line to run with. Hope you like it as much as I.",1058918400,7,344,4.2272727272727275
426202,4,6302132894,"""War has been outlawed"" are the first words you hear as the camera slowly makes it's way through a snow covered battlefield. Meanwhile anyone past the age of 15 is thinking, ""How the heck do you enforce that?"" If you take this movie seriously, I fear for your children. This is a perfect example of a guilty pleasure movie if I ever saw one. Stop motion special effects, glossy form fitting spandex jumpsuits and over the top characters. It's all here!!! Adults will be howling and kids will be entertained. The stand out is Paul Koslo as the evil Russian, Alexander. He won me over with the furrowed brow, dead stare and exclamations such as ""All right!! Now I Kill You!!""
This is definite Genre fun. If you liked Spacehunter, Ice Pirates, Battle Beyond the Stars and Mega Force then you know what I'm talking about. I recommend the said above as well. ""Crash and Burn"" Baby! Enjoy.",1046304000,29,883,4.594936708860759
426203,4,6302132894,"This movie is good to me on a more personal level. It may not be the most popular movie ever made, but it's one of those movies that has been with me since I was a kid and will stay with me until I die, or at least until I can't remember I liked it. As for everyobyd reading this, view the movie for yourself and see how you like it. It is not a masterpiece , just a feel good movie. Forget about how fancy the effects are or how simple the story may be, and just enjoy it. Just enjoy....",1013904000,4,488,3.7941176470588234
426204,1,6302132894,"I recall reading an article about the director's vision for this movie.  He (the director) recalled a model kit from his youth.  Mostly he recalled the painting on the box, a painting of giant building-sized robots being tended to by seemingly tiny humans...it's a shame he didn't forget this image...
There is nothing redeeming about this inane waste of mortal effort.  The special effects stink, the story is lost early on, and any semblence of acting is glossed over by directing so childlike that we assume that the robots argued with cast over screen time, and won.
This move actually makes the Sci-Fi Channel's Battle Star Galact-a-thon seem like a good idea.  Unlike the original Dune, which I rerent periodically to reassure myself it is still terrible, I will never need to check back to be sure this movie is a disaster.",1003363200,5,830,4.823943661971831

Giant robots, memorable villain with his cheesy faux Russian accent, cheap sci-fi oozing down the walls... and did I mention the fantastic stop-motion Giant Robots?!

426400,5,6302132894,"Set in a post-apocalyptic world where war is outlawed, 20 pregnancies are expected of a single family unit, hotdogs is prime choice meat, genetically engineered athletes are the newest fad, and the Old Boy's Club is dying out like the Ottoman Empire in WW1, robo-Rocky goes toe-to-toe with robo-Ivan to duke it out in giant robots over natural resources we would have probably long-since tapped out before hand.

The acting is as over-the-top-B-movie as you can expect and model-mation is absolutely superb. Despite how bad it is, I love this movie from the bottom of my heart and have since I was 8 (when I finally bugged my dad to let me watch it). You have to remember when it was made, but despite all the sexism, lewd jokes, and general machoism, the movie stands out in a lot of ways: the perfect genetic athlete isn't white, the rest of the cast is fairly diverse (surprisingly), and the aesthetics were the best of the era of late 80s science fiction.

I would aggressively insist that everyone who loves giant robots watch this movie, even if it is only once. You won't be (completely) disappointed.",1456876800,,1108,4.706185567010309

426596,4,6302132894,"BOTTOM LINE: Stuart Gordon's 1989 sci-fi action adventure spectacle ROBOT JOX is harmless fluff entertainment from producer Charles Band & Empire Pictures. Never heard of ROBOT JOX before? Well, if you love Voltron, Transformers, old school mecha anime or if you ever played Rock'em Sock'em Robots as a kid then you're all set to love this movie. It's not deep stuff by any means but it is a fun way to blow 85 minutes on a rainy weekend. The film itself is a 5 STAR blast. The older MGM DVD release of ROBOT JOX nets a 3 STAR rating, while the new Blu-ray edition rates a slightly higher 4 STARS.

THE STORY (contains spoilers): In the not too distant future, (unspecified, but at least 50 years or more), our world has been ravaged by nuclear war. The future looks pretty bleak & ugly. The atmosphere is heavily-polluted by radiation fallout, requiring people to don air filtration masks whenever they go outside. Because of the heavy loss of human life and planet-wide devastation, war has been outlawed. All political disputes are now settled using massive fighting machines controlled by onboard human pilots. Director Stuart Gordon, (credited with the original story concept), throws in a few thought-provoking ideas about this future world for us to chew on whenever the big 'bots aren't on screen punching each other out, along with some thinly-veiled ironic commentary about our current state. For instance, the global animal population was apparently equally hard hit by the atomic war and its after effects, since a meal with ""real meat"" (a lone hot dog floating in a watery pot of gruel), is a rare occasion and cause for joyous celebration. (Yuck!) Gambling & drinking seem to be the only forms of recreation left now that the great outdoors ain't all that great anymore. Our educational system also appears to have broken down, but apparently that's not too important. (Nationally-celebrated hero Achilles can't even read, whereas his brother holds down an unglamorous, menial job that involves editing and/or writing!) All citizens are encouraged to breed as many children as possible in order to re-populate the decimated populace, and apparently the more kids you have the better your government-subsidized standard of living is. Defect-free births are stressed using heavy media saturation about proper prenatal care for mothers-to-be. Achilles, champion for The Market, (a presumed stand-in for the USA & her allies), is scheduled to complete the last of 10 compulsory fights against the villainous Alexander, hero of the Confederation (those naughty Russians!). The outcome of the match will decide possession of Alaska and all her precious natural resources. Each previous match has been tipped in favor of the Confederation thru treacherous industrial espionage. Who is selling the robot's weaponry secrets? Ferreting out the identity of the spy may be the deciding factor in whether Achilles wins or loses. What's more, the next generation of robot pilots (the genetically-bred GenJox) are eagerly waiting in the wings, should Achilles fail. Further muddying the waters is Achilles' affection for the beautiful but icy Athena, the first and only female GenJox in contention to pilot the massive battle 'bots.

THOUGHTS: I recall reading everything I could get my hands on about this movie during it's production. Starlog magazine (remember that?) had some fairly good coverage of it, including all the legal wrangling over the original name: RoboJox, which the creators of RoboCop apparently weren't too thrilled with. LOL. It was eventually released with a slight name tweak, and I was lucky enough to actually catch it during its limited theatrical run back in 1989. Director Stuart Gordon was a collector of the then-new Transformer toys, along with being a fan of Japanese mecha-based anime shows such as Macross. He wondered when and/or if Hollywood would take a stab at a live-action big robot movie. Instead of waiting, (and about 20 or so years ahead of his time), Gordon took his ideas to Charles Band & Empire Pictures and did it first himself. I love this quirky little film. It's a highly entertaining rock'em sock'em popcorn movie. (Parental Advisory: there are a couple of gratuitous butt shots, 1 male & 1 female, along with some occasional coarse language so please be advised if you have younger ones.) The robot fights themselves are  a lot of fun but pretty restrained due to the film's small (six million) budget, as with all Full Moon/Empire Pictures movies. Unsung indie F/X hero David Allen & Co. do an admirable job using a clever combination of stop-motion and rod & cable-actuated puppetry to bring the big robots to life. There are some fairly ambitious F/X shots to keep things interesting, including a brief but cool sequence where the two robos take to the skies and battle high above the Earth. The robot piloted by Achilles has some neat Transformer-ish abilities that add to the fun. Surprisingly enough for such a low budget movie there are some cool, full-scale robot sets (HUGE feet & the human interface cockpits) for the people to interact with. Certainly Empire really embraced Stu Gordon's ideas and went as big as they could with this fun film. Gary Graham, (shortly before landing his memorable role as Det. Sikes on Fox TV's criminally short-lived series ""Alien Nation""), makes a suitably confident & cocky action lead as Achilles. Anne-Marie Johnson shows surprising strength & intensity in her role as Athena, the first genetically-bred combat pilot, (and the feisty love interest for Graham's macho Achilles). But it's Paul Koslo who steals the show with his over-the-top, scene-chewing performance as the baddest of bad guys, Alexander. His hokey ""Russian"" accent is equal parts Mikael Baryshnikov & Bela Lugosi, and he appears to be having an absolute blast throughout. Character actors Robert Sampson, Danny Kamekona & Michael Alldredge all add their sturdy talents to the diverse cast.

(Watching this again really makes me wonder if Guillermo Del Toro saw this when he was younger. As a self-confessed hardcore sci-fi/monster movie geek he almost certainly MUST have. I mean so much of ROBOT JOX seems to have informed his human-operated Jaeger robots in ""PACIFIC RIM."" The cockpit interaction in PacRim is especially reminiscent of this film. OK, so Del Toro's robots used two pilots instead of one and his cockpit sets were bigger & more detailed, but he also had a LOT more money to play with than Stu Gordon did. Actually, the only thing missing from ROBOT JOX that would make PacRim an almost by-the-numbers remake are big, slimy monsters for the 'bots to battle. That's not a fault nor an insinuation. Just an observation. They're both very different movies due to age, budgets & F/X technology differences and each is fun in its own way.)

THE DVD: The MGM DVD release is barebones affair. No remastering or restoration of ANY kind was done. The condition of the print for ROBOT JOX looks pretty rough. I observed several instances of dust, dirt & film scratches. The video portion of the film does look better than, say, a factory VHS tape - but not by much. Box artwork is yet another example of the hastily slapped together photoshop junk that we sadly see used far too often for older films nowadays. Lame. All-in-all, MGM's DVD is a disappointing release on home video, and is only marginally recommended for desperate fans of the film who haven't yet upgraded to Blu-ray.

>>> UPDATE! THE BLU-RAY: Shout! Factory (God bless you boys!) has now released a high-def Blu-ray remaster of ROBOT JOX! The picture is noticeably sharper than the DVD release from MGM. Film grain is evident, along with occasional noise due to the transfer technicians cranking up the sharpness for maximum clarity. The audio is solid & strong. My only gripe is that towards the end of the movie the source print contains considerable staining of some kind; brownish dots pepper the screen for a few minutes and it kills what would otherwise be a full five star re-master. Other than that this is a 100% out of the park home run from Shout! Factory. A plethora of excellent bonus material has been stuffed onto the release which should delight fans of the film. A new on camera interview with actor Paul Koslo starts things off, in which he shares his memories & thoughts on the making of the film. Not one, but TWO full-length audio commentary tracks can be accessed on the AUDIO options sub-screen. The first is an insightful offering with director Stu Gordon, the other features several visual effects technicians discussing the film's creation from their perspective. Both commentaries are interesting, fun and well worth a listen. The Blu-ray also includes a wealth of archival interview segments with director Gordon and various F/X crew members. These are older interviews apparently done sometime after 2000, perhaps as supplemental material produced for a fancier DVD edition that never saw the light of day? I don't know, but they are chock full of insightful, amusing stories & trivia, and are very entertaining. The new Blu-ray rounds out the bonus goodies with an obligatory copy of the film's theatrical trailer, plus a TV ad AND two still image galleries: the first of behind-the-scenes photos taken during filming, the second showcasing beautiful concept artwork of the various robots & tech bits from visionary production designer Ron Cobb. Lastly, the Blu-ray slipcase insert features beautiful reversible artwork, as with many recent Shout! Factory releases. Rather than some shoddy photoshop job, two original promotional posters for the film are reproduced for the covers. Pick your favorite! (A very classy touch.)",1404518400,11,9696,5.053091817613991

426602,4,6302132894,"Let's be very clear here...this movie is VERY DEFINITELY a child of the '80s.

It also happens to be the best ""Mech"" movie (humans in giant robots) I've ever seen, possibly the best ever made.

The story is set in the future, after a nuclear holocaust that wiped out most of the world.  The two remaining alliances agree that all remaining disputes will be settled through combat via these giant Mechs (this line of reasoning is  not deeply explored, nor does it need to be for the movie).  The best good guy Mech driver and the bad guy Mech driver go to battle over the territory of Alaska.  There's an accident that results in the match being called a draw, a subplot involving a bad guy spy, a batch of test tube Mech pilots who have been engineered for combat, and a few shots of life outside the arena.

But the best parts ARE, of course, the Mech battles and they ARE indeed pretty neat.  They look to have been shot in stop-motion and this was apparently such an expensive process that the original production company actually went bankrupt before the movie was finished, delaying it by two years.  There are all kinds of nifty Mech weapons---flare guns and rockets and flying detachable fists and enormous chainsaws--it's awesomely good fun.  Any fan of the game Mechwarrior will know exactly what I'm talking about.

I've seen giant Mechs in a few other movies (most recently Pacific Rim), but frankly these battles are better done, better lit, and seem closer to the ""source material"" (if one can refer to Mechwarrior that way).  HIGHLY recommended for any fan of campy action movies and/or giant Mechs.",1388188800,,1613,4.680851063829787

The stop motion on the robots is still pretty good and I love the way they control them. Every giant robot show or movie I've ever watched has people sitting in front of a joystick and fiddling with buttons, but this film has the pilots (or jox) stand and actually mime the movements of the robot.

426663,4,6302132894,"I thought I wrote a review of this back when it first came out on dvd, which wasn't that long ago, but I must have forgot to do that.

Anyway, I picked this up the second it came out on DVD and played it.  You know that feeling, when you first open something up from your childhood...you are reclaiming something or maybe you just want to re-experience what you once thought was pretty entertaining.

I don't remember ever thinking this movie was ""good"", but I probably rented it 15-20 times back when it was in the B movie area for VHS.  I used to have a really good video rental place that kept a solid stock of b movies, and this one was a gem.

Basically, this movie is about giant robots going toe to toe against each other. But it isn't just the technical specifications of the robots that make them dangerous and effective, it's the pilot as well.

Something that struck me as very funny when re-watching this is how absolutely ridiculous the stereotypes are.  I mean, they are 100% stereotypical.  I won't ruin the movie, but see if you can pick out the nationality of a few people, and then start making a list of each stereotypical thing they do.  It's an excellent side game!

Anyway, this is probably one of the few movies where they have a significant amount of video time focused on giant mecha combat. For a low budget movie, they did quite well.  Back in the 80's you can imagine how even more powerful it must have seemed then.  The sets are decent and the uniforms/props aren't too shabby.

The acting is pretty cheesy, so if you are into that kind of thing, this is worth a pickup.

4/5 stars.  It could have had more robot combat and a little more rated R action, and then it would have got another star!

On a side note, COMPLETELY IGNORE THE SEQUEL ROBOT JOX 2 / CRASH AND BURN!  It barely even mentions giant robots, and you barely even get to see one.",1355356800,,1875,4.341954022988506

It is cheesy but it is a good start to the robotic revolution in movies just like Sledgehammer by Peter Gabriel(?) was for music videos.

Everything in the film, from the acting and costume design to the script and special effects, carries over a ridiculous 80's panache, an over-ambitious attempt at a movie that desperately needed improvements in every possible department yet turned a blind eye and marched onward.

Despite being secondary characters, my two favorites from the film are Danny Kamekona and the late, great Michael Aldrige.  Kamekona's subdued performance hilariously underscores his full throttle apex during Karate Kid II, and Alldredge, whose IMDB page - excluding About last night - reads like the most awesome list of appearances in Hollywood history  (incredible run from 1976 to 1986), is the quintessential ""1980s Texan thrust centuries into the future"" (if there were such a thing).  About a fourth of the way through, during the first epic battle, Alldredge unabashedly breaks the fourth wall, and it's just as epic as you'd imagine.

There are countless reasons why some may disparage this film.  Truth be told, the acting from stars is not great; the antagonist is atrocious.  The special effects are beyond dated.  The dystopian aspect falls less than short.  Despite all this, however, it's wonderful.

426788,5,6302132894,"Robot Jox is a horrible movie. The plot stinks, the actors and actresses are just horrible, and the animation, even for the time, was just horrible. So what makes this movie so great? The one liners. This movie has some the the best one liners I've heard in a while.

To start with the plot, which is corny, the world is destroyed and then war was outlawed, which I don't see how is possible, but let's just assume everyone agrees with it. So how are debates settled? By giant robots that fight each other. It's a spectator's sport equivalent to football or any other sport. The thing I don't get is who determines the winners of the matches? The scary part is that the refs appear to have more power than either side as they can determine who is the winner as they see fit, so it appears that they are a self-regulating body that neither side can control which always lead to corruption, but the movie never dives into this.

The movie features some of the worst cast of characters I've ever seen in a movie. The movie's main characters are Achilles and his love interest Athena. Then we get to his side kicks Tex and the professor. Tex is as the name states a cowboy with a Texan accent. The professor is a stereotypical Japanese robotic expert who makes all sorts of fancy weapons. Then there is the main enemy, Alexander who appears to be Russian, but I don't think it was ever fully mentioned.

To start off with the first ridiculous thing is the relationship between Tex, the professor and Achilles. I have never laughed so hard at this stuff. The entire time of the movie, they had a ""spy"" on the base who would tell the other side secret weapons and so fort. No one knows who it is, but Tex suspect it is the Japanese guy, but then later on the Japanese guy finds out it's really Tex but ends up getting killed. What Tex didn't know is that the Japanese professor recorded the whole thing and then Achilles and co found out. To escape death the movie's famous, one-liner responses play out. The first thing Tex says is, ""I'll see you in hell,"" followed by busting out and running and then for no apparent reason screams, ""geronimo"" out the window to his death. It was so hilarious I nearly died.

As for the main characters and enemy, Achilles and Alexander fight it off with many one-liners. For example, in the ""tough talks"" segment where they talk tough to each other like a boxing match on TV, Alexander came on TV and said, ""I already killed you,"" and points to his head going, ""in here."" Then starts to laugh and I began to laugh. Achilles has many come backs but the most famous one is near the end when he said, ""I'm going to get in this thing and kick your ***!!"" Which was hilarious and silly.

The final battle between Achilles and Alexander made about as much sense as seeing a paraplegic do ice skating. The first part is that Alexander and Achilles for no apparent reason blasts off into space. Then when they came back down to earth, Achilles transformed his mech into some sort of turtle where he then for no apparent reason tried to stomp into Alexander's robot. At the end, everything was in pieces and they shook hands, then credit rolls.

To say the least, the movie was just horrible, but the one liners are so hilarious that you have to watch it. The movie is unintentionally hilarious to the point where you'll be laughing out loud.",1262044800,2,3363,4.4424635332252835

426847,4,6302132894,"That's what this film is.  Very much something along the lines of modern professional wrestling, complete with the ""behind the scenes"" conflicts and romances, the gym/training sequences, and the interviews, trash-talking, and the ""sports commentary"" that goes along with it, as well as the relatively ineffectual referees.

This is the mindset, and for the story (which isn't supposed to be taken seriously), it actually works.  But because they use Giant Robots, there are matters of technological advances and industrial espionage to deal with, along with some nice touches that flesh out this future world where meat is scarce, childbirth encouraged, new jocks are disintered from test-tubes, and pollution is rampant.  However, the final scene was both poignant and ironic at the same time, as we see just how little Man has advanced from the time he was fighting with rocks and sticks.

This movie was made before the ready availability of CGI, so remote controlled marionettes, and stop-motion puppets are used for the giant robots with good effect and actually offers up a good look at the old art of SPFX before the advent of the modern CGI-effects factory.  The SPFX are adequate for the film albeit you can tell that this was done on a budget; but the script by Joe Haldeman (author of the award winning FOREVER WAR) is very much written tongue-in-cheek and you can tell he is having fun coming up with the world and storyline that would feature the Ron Cobb (CONAN and ALIEN) designed machines. In short, decent effects, good acting, and a fun script makes this an above average B-Movie to watch when you just want some dumb fun.

The sets used to simulate the piloting of a giant robot are well done, a credit to years of giant robot anime from Japan.

426913,1,6302132894,"i was really looking foward to watching this one as i have seen the box and looked at the reviews here,so i was upset when i watched this sad movie. gary graham(t.v.'s alien nation) is a robot jox,which means he pilots a large voltron like machine which are used as fighting weapons in a future where war is no longer fought! the f/x are not very good and the story is paper thin,only the acting is good,but it can't save this one from being just a let down. skip it!",1151020800,3,467,4.2
426914,3,6302132894,"For most of us awkward GenY kids, this movie was great when we were children. Watching it again is excellent, but only because the movie is awful. You'll quickly come to terms with your childhood and just as quickly realize how the end to this movie is the most disapointing scene in all of film. There are jokes you pick up for the first time and wonder how this movie made any sense to you when you were a ten year old.

The DVD is fine, though it lacks any extra material that you would find interesting. It's fun, it plays, but let's face it... Robot movies from the past are the bottom of the quality screenplay pool.",1140739200,10,622,4.271186440677966
426915,5,6302132894,"When I was six I loved this film  I used to watch it all the time when I was younger now I can't find the video cassette tape of Robot Jox I've decided to get the DVD. finally it came out on dvd it takes them forever to release a dvd sometimes. The only thing I'm bummed about is no special features no behind the scenes or not even a theatrical trailer oh well at least they released the movie on dvd, Can't wait to get it in the mail. I might be 19 years old now but I love my childhood favorites.",1138320000,2,499,3.8446601941747574

426917,5,6302132894,"I watched a screening of this at a convention where SF writer Joe Haldeman, who did the screenplay, sat in back with a something eating grin on his face.
What's not to like?  In celebration of their son's visit, the family has meat--a lone weiner floating in a tureen of soup.  The female pilot makes all the men nonplussed, then has the tables turned on her when an enemy robot unleashes a giant crotch chainsaw in the midst of a duel, for the obvious Freudian tie-ins (at which point Joe was grinning mercilessly.)
All the jokes and innuendos are way over the top.  As Joe put it:  ""I was writing a movie for adults that kids could enjoy, and the director was writing a movie for kids that adults could enjoy.""
Add in a Slim Pickens performance invoking Dr. Strangelove, and it's a twisted, unsubtle romp through political incorrectness, poking fun at (among others) environmentalists, capitalists, global politics and sports fanatics (the spectators who get squashed under a falling robot).
Oh yeah, and it has these kick butt robot warriors, too.  Grab your friends, grab the kids, grab a pizza and a couple of beers for the adults and laugh until you choke.",1087344000,42,1162,4.704433497536946
426918,5,6302132894,"Anyone who knows me is familiar with my philosophy that there are only three genres of movies worth watching:
First, there's the miniature robot movies (see Batteries not Included), that feature robots much smaller than people.  These movies get a little sappy but they still make me hope for a day when I can have a conversation with my toaster.  Second, there are the human size robot movies (see RoboCop parts 1-3), distinguished by robots that are roughly the size of the actors playing them.  Third, there is the giant robot movie (like Robot Jox!).  I'd take this genre any day of the week.  I would recommend this movie.  You've gotta see these robots bash each other into submission!  I don't know if they used models or built real robots but the special effects make them look like robots.  The acting glistens with reality.
The worst part about the movie is the opening credits-everyone knows the title of the movie they're seeing either from buying the ticket or from the box the tape was in so why do they have to waste valuable movie time by showing it on the screen?  Unless you want to read a title you already know and a bunch of names I would fast forward that part.
I used to watch this movie almost every day in my basement and my dad would yell at me ""quit watching that movie and eating peanut butter and get a job!""  I also love the soundtrack but I don't listen to it anymore because it reminds me of my ex-girlfriend.",1086480000,11,1441,4.465648854961832
