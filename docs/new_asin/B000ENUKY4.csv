2524480,5,B000ENUKY4,"I don't like how they changed the covers and names. It was changed to Vegeta Saga now too, but I still konw it as the sayian saga. I saw a preview for this saga and the sound was what got me thinking inhanceed and uncut, I gotta get it. When are they doing the namek saga? does anyone know? why did they redo the movie dead zone and they diddn't redo tree of might and the worlds strongest?",1156291200,,390,4.012820512820513
2524481,4,B000ENUKY4,"Let's see. What's not to love here? It's DragonBall Z. Uncut. Episodes 1-39 on 5 discs. English and Japanese audio. Steve J. Simmons' wonderfully translated subtitles.

The only reason I gave this a 4 instead of a 5 is because Funimation should've released the ""Vegeta Saga"" in this format first, instead of the outdated 3-episodes-of-a-hugely-long-series-for-$30-a-DVD plan.

In short? If you haven't collected any of the Saiyan/Namek episodes or want to jump into DBZ without spending a huge amount of cash, get these ""season"" sets. For those who were collecting the ""Ultimate Uncut"" editions (like me), you got screwed. BIG TIME. Especially since they've stopped releasing them after Vol. 9.",1151452800,19,694,5.3577981651376145

2524496,3,B000ENUKY4,"3 stars only because (yes I know it doesn't say it) this is completely edited in terms of scenes..
E.G.
Because when goku turns super saiyan for the first time it takes over a min but yet in the Dvd series it takes like 20secs WAY TO INSTANT..
Another was when gohan turns SS2 Takes him over a min as well cause hes trying not to, but again in the Dvd Series its just Almost Instant..

I love the series been watching since I was diapers but 3 stars due to edited content in terms of scenes..Above is just an example
there are more scenes that aren't there.. Voices are uncut
This review goes for all the Dvd Series..",1507248000,,617,4.184873949579832

2524500,3,B000ENUKY4,"I have no complaints with the quality of the video or the music or framing or anything (and of course Dragonball Z is just epic), but I was really disappointed about this glitch that seems to affect about 30% of the episodes. So on about every third episode or so, when it gets to around the last five minutes of the episode, it will suddenly freeze, then go to the end credits. There is no way to rewind back through it. There's no way around it. If it wasn't for the style of Dragonball Z to recap each previous episode at the beginning of each new episode, I'd never know what had happened.

Now, in case you're wondering, ""I bet it might be defective discs"", I returned my discs and got a brand new boxed set sent to me. Unwrapped it, popped it in, and it did the same thing on the exact same episodes.",1502496000,4,806,4.2

To see it remastered, and at the original aspect was really nice for me, and I assume for others as well. I thought the clarity and colors were pretty good. I have to say though, I don't have the best eye for detail, but nonetheless, it was a significant upgrade on what i was watching at the moment (online streams).

2524583,5,B000ENUKY4,"My favorite thing about these collections is the 'marathon feature'. The intro and the recap get redundant when you're watching them back to back. Ended up buying the series when I discovered that Hulu only had parts of the season available to watch. I mention this because the original Japanese mono sound quality is worse on DVD than on Hulu- I'm not sure why.

Overall good series- wasn't expecting the Namek intro after the Saiyans but made me excited to continue watching. I had forgotten how annoying Gohan is in the beginning- thankfully only lasts for a short while.

Bought this set used from goHastings.com. They usually have good deals/ coupons on their used inventory. The last episode on the last disk didn't play well rendering it unwatchable. Cleaned with a glass rag= good as new. Shipping fast. Product in good shape. Good purchase.",1451952000,,849,4.888888888888889

EVERY single season I have purchased of this series has come with a razor blade slice through the DVD box cover.

I ended up not bothering to return/replace my copies, but it was a little astonishing that the seller had a low quality of shipping.",1448409600,,541,4.252427184466019

The cropping is horrible.
You get a lot removed from bottom and top which is clear in the first 5 seconds of watching any episode, and get extra picture on the sides, which is useless.
Who made this decision must never seen the result of what he did.

2524688,4,B000ENUKY4,"I bought this because I heard it was the best option available for DBZ fans to re-watch the show and I am satisfied with my purchase. The only issue I have, along with everyone else, is that it's in widescreen and to get it in widescreen they cut 20% of the picture so the cropping was rather annoying to deal with. Does it completely ruin the quality of the Orange Brick set? No.

I would still recommend buying the Orange Bricks because it reminds me of the classic DBZ when it originally aired, The show that I absolutely loved to watch and still do, and I easily found myself watching multiple episodes in one sitting. So yes the Orange Bricks are the best and cheapest way to re-watch this classic show.

If you want top notch visual quality though then the Blu-Rays are for you, Keep in mind though that the cropping issue is still there and you will have to wait a while for all the seasons because they only have seasons 1 through 3 out.",1394496000,,945,4.333333333333333

We have been working our way through the seasons, and we thoroughly enjoy them. However, most of these remasters feature bonus episodes and filler scenes that were not originally aired in the US and can sort of stray from the story line (Like drawing out the battle between Goku and Frieza) but also adds more back story. Yeah, it is cropped, but how can you complain with digitally remastered DBZ??!!(It looks great by the way, even on Smart TVs that are 70"")",1392163200,,588,4.5046728971962615

When i was younger I couldn't wait to get home from school to turn on Toonami and catch the latest episode of DBZ! My only reason for not giving this a 5 star rating is because these dvds have the cropped image. Not a big deal but a turn off for some hardcore fans. It would be nice to see DBZ presented in its original screen format. Sadly the level Blu rays that had the original aspect ratio were discontinued and are being replaced with new cropped Blu-rays versions. I usually always upgrade to blu-ray but if you have these orange bricks then theres no need to rush out and get the new blu-rays. But you cant go wrong with either choice because hey, its DBZ!!!",1390348800,2,826,4.234177215189874

2524706,5,B000ENUKY4,"This season is what started it all in the world of DBZ. Now that I (as well as you while they're still here) have a chance in acquiring this great anime, these box sets have everything you need. Uncut, digitally re-mastered, what more can you ask for?

It may not be HD but really who needs this show to be in HD when it already looks great on your TV with component cables or S-video.

To keep this short and sweet I covers all the episodes up to the beginning of the namekian saga. Since I mentioned that this looks great re-mastered, scenes from, like the power struggle between Goku and Vegeta truly shine it never looked so good on screen.

I can keep on talking about this but there's too much in this box set alone to explain. Although some may argue about the cropping it doesn't bother me (personally) at all since chances are when they began preparing this for the original broadcast it was probably already cropped for the 4:9 airing. The only bad thing I have to say about this is that since it is one large series, you have a lot of dvds to go through. Great box set nonetheless.",1382918400,,1092,4.317073170731708

2524710,4,B000ENUKY4,"It looks like plenty of people have already left detailed reviews but I thought I'd add my 2 cents in case anyone is still wondering about these orange bricks.

I got this season all by itself because I wanted to make sure that it was of a decent quality before I bought the whole series for $180-190. The good thing about these DVDs in my opinion is that they include every last episode (all 291) and are uncut. You can choose from Japanese music and dialogue with English subtitles, English dub with Japanese music, or English dub with the American music (which is what I grew up on). These are positives in my opinion.

The drawbacks have been mentioned by many people. There is part of the screen missing and it is evident in some shots due to the reformatting of the series to fit widescreen TVs. Is it noticeable if you look for it? Yes, absolutely. Does it really affect your overall viewing experience of DBZ to the point that you won't enjoy it? To me, not at all unless you are super high maintenance person about this kind of thing (and I realize many anime fans are). Honestly I may not have even noticed except people were raging about it so when I bought it I was looking for it. The other drawback is that as many others have also complained, I did not get an episode guide. (I feel that it would not have really informed me of very much, but it is more the principle of the thing. When you pay for something, you should get it!) I have read that Amazon quit including these to ""go green"" which is patently ridiculous (if it is true). If they really wanted to ""Go green"" they would not include a paper-based sleeve for these orange bricks, and stop using everything available to the modern world since the industrial revolution. To not include the episode guides in the name of going green is tantamount to not smoking in the name of health while never exercising, eating Big Macs, and drinking a 5 gallon drum of Coke everyday, followed by a few sleeves of Oreos. It doesn't really make too much of a difference and is stupid. But anyways I'll move on..

To me, a DBZ Kai uncut version with the music and episode titles from this orange brick version (heaven knows the music and titles from DBZKai suck horribly) would make for a good way to own the series as well. I used to be on board with the belief that Kai was an abomination to all of mankind, but I can appreciate the idea behind what they were doing with Kai now.  Unfortunately I don't think any one set of DBZ is perfect (Dragon box, Orange Bricks, or Kai Seasons/parts). But if you are looking to own the series as it aired in the US back in the late 90s early 2000s then this is a good route. Lots of people dog the orange bricks but to me those people probably are the same ones who haven't eaten in 2 weeks because they are leveling up their characters on WOW constantly (i.e. they may not have a life). I recommend this to anyone who wants to own the series and not shell out over $1,000 to do it. An even cheaper route than the orange bricks is the DBZKai seasons but then you miss out on the filler and have to keep in mind that the final season of Kai is yet to be out (but I think it is coming soon).",1379376000,2,3186,4.2698675496688745
2524711,5,B000ENUKY4,"DBZ is a must have! The series is great and it's a great anime for anime fans to have in their collection. If you haven't already seen it, some advice, for some eps have patience, give it a chance because it's amazing. The characters, action, and story ties in and makes it great. This anime was the root of anime of today, it had so much impact and still does.",1378684800,,361,4.171428571428572

2524716,3,B000ENUKY4,"I have been a long time fan of DBZ. In fact, I want to collect all versions of DBZ. I thought that these Orange Brick box sets is the first thing I should buy first. They are inexpensive, and $20 bucks seems like a great deal, right? But sadly, you get what you pay for.

There has been a lot of controversy over the Orange Brick box sets. The reason why this is, is because people are misinformed, and I can only imagine why. I'll have a list of the pros and cons of this product down below

Pros:

. $20, inexpensive, cheap
. Bruce Faulconer soundtrack for english dub fans.
. Original Japanese Mono and soundtrack.
. Simple title screen.
. All 39 episodes.

Cons:
. Horribly Remastered
. In some cases, there is Grain Removal to the point where almost all details, and sometimes faces, have  disappeared
. NOT HD. DVD's CAN NOT BE IN ANYWAY, HAVE A RESOLUTION OF 720p AND 1080p. On a Blu-Ray player, it may have HD like quality, BUT IT IS NOT HD.
. Cropped to a 16:9 Aspect Ratio(Widescreen)to fit your TV. That may sound good, but it's not. If you didn't know, DBZ originally aired in a 4:3 aspect ratio(Normal screen.) Meaning that it fitted most TV's in the early 90's and late 80's. So what happens when you crop a video meant for 4:3 to 16:9. Well, I'll let you take a guess.

  Overall, if your looking for a version DBZ, buy Kai or the Dragon Box's. Sure they might be more expensive, but because of that you get a nicer, cleaner, better quality product then the Orange Bricks.

  But if you want to collect all 3 versions, I recommend all 3. Simply because there basically the same show, just different versions. This has been my first review on a product, so I know I probably could do better, but I hope this review helps you.",1377648000,3,1739,4.303680981595092

2524732,5,B000ENUKY4,"To start, I'm going to just say that this is the best anime out there! Most people would agree. I like this box set sooo much. The order got here pretty fast, too. I'm not the best at giving reviews, but I just had to say something about DBZ! This is one of my favorite seasons because Vegeta is one of my favorite antagonists in the series (him, Frieza and Perfect Cell). This season leads up to the Planet Namek Saga, which is pretty good itself. From Radditz to Nappa to Vegeta, this season has some good bad guys. And the famous ""It's over 9,000"" phrase is included (even though it's said a little different). It's okay, though. I still like this season, but the real good action happens in the later seasons. I've been watching DBZ Kai lately, but the Majin Vegeta and Majin Buu Sagas are left out. Oh well. I can always get all 9 seasons Of Dragonball Z. I would recommend this to any hardcore anime fan. You won't be disappointed.",1368489600,,937,4.36

But that doesnt matter to me, I didn't buy the box set for the book. All of the DVDs are in exceptional condition as well. And I've been hearing things about the size of the screen? Personally, I think it's perfect, you're not missing anything. It seems they cut off a very small portion. But not enough to notice. 10/10 would buy again.",1366934400,,453,4.536585365853658
2524736,5,B000ENUKY4,"I have no complaints!

I've loved Dragon Ball Z since I was in middle school. I recently decided to begin collecting the entire series, and started with Amazon. What is there to say? The product was at least $10 cheaper than many retail stores. Even though the shipping said I would be receiving it within 3-5 days, I received it in two. It was still in the plastic, nothing was out of place, and I've already watched it. I already went ahead and bought Season Two, and look forward to re-watching the series!

If you're looking to collect the Funimation Dubbed series, Amazon is the go-to place, hands down.",1366329600,,608,4.568807339449541
2524737,5,B000ENUKY4,"Disks arrived is perfect working order and were fun to watch.  Reminded me of when I was kid, waiting eagerly for the next episode, except now their all right here!  Its hard to stop watching and is extremely entertaining.  The characters are lovable and the story is constantly involving and moving forward.  I'm no anime fan, but I love Dragon Ball Z.  Not to mention the price was extremely reasonable!  If you like Dragon Ball Z or anime in general, Amazon is the place to go!",1365638400,,480,4.523255813953488
2524738,5,B000ENUKY4,gotta love all the dragon ball action. reminds me of when I watched it years ago. just had to own it.,1365292800,,101,3.857142857142857
2524739,4,B000ENUKY4,"I really like this anime. It's got good characters (though annoying at times), the drawing is charming, and the story is pretty interesting. However, I am weary of recommending it because it takes SO LONG to get to the point. You will watch full episodes where there is nothing, literally nothing, that happens. It moves so slow, I find myself moaning for it to get on with it. I can't even imagine how kids felt when they had to watch only 1 episode a week on TV, since it always ends with some kind of cliffhanger. I bet it drove them nuts!
Speaking of kids, this anime is surprising bloody for what's considered as a children's show. It's nothing major, but it may be an issue for younger kids. Also speaking of kids, the main character's kids, who is in the show a lot, is constantly crying and complaining for a lot of the season. So be prepared for some annoying time.
However, in general, this show is a classic, and is worth watching. However, if the idea of watching near 40 episodes for a storyline that honestly could have been shaped in around 16, you may want to pass. I have heard of an abridged edition, but I have not seen it, so I can not comment on it.",1365206400,,1170,4.322727272727272
2524740,5,B000ENUKY4,"I love all the DBZ and DBGT episodes and movies.  These were cheap, at least when I bought them so I don't know what the price is now, and they arrived promptly.",1365033600,,161,4.03125
2524741,1,B000ENUKY4,"The product in and of itself was fine, but when I opened it up and put it in, I managed to watch the first view episodes and then was having disc read errors. I checked to make sure it wasn't my player, and when I took the disc out I realized that the film on the disk was raised, preventing me from viewing the rest of the episodes on the disc. The other discs had the same problem. It was also missing an information pamphlet, which came with my season two collection. If only I'd seen any of this before the return window was closed.",1364428800,,536,4.114285714285714
2524742,2,B000ENUKY4,Well I will start off by saying if you plan on buying this boxset you might wanna get Bardock father of goku dbz movie special and the entire orginal dragonball seasons before buying dbz season 1 to understand Dragonball Z completly. Now about this boxset season 1 the good things and bad things about it. The good is its way better finacially buying the seasons than having to get them all seperate like years before this came out when funimation first put them on v.h.s. and dvd orginally however don't think these boxets are exactly like those versions because as similar as they are they are def not the same and I'm not talking about the quality either even though this boxset has been remastered in high definition and digital restored in widescreen from orginal japense film and newly revised english dialogue and my least favorite orginal japense audio and music which funimation put in every season including the newly restored dbz movies! This is something that should have been optional the widescreen and the japenese audio and music should had been optional considering dbz was orginally intended to be seen in fullscreen! But it seems all you nerds outthere and funimation loved the mary popins sounding jap music so much they left it on every dvd you have to go to the menu options just to hear the u.s. funimation dub that all the orginal dbz fans grew up with! Everytime you swich discs! Another thing they've changed is the orginal voice dubs from the orginal funimation versions which means most of the dialouge has changed in these boxset versions and these vocies are alright..they just don't have the same emotion as the orginal funimation dubs did I don't know why funimation thought that would be a good idea cuz it wasn't! Why couldn't they just leave it all alone and just ONLY digital remaster the orginal U.S. funimation dub versions that mostly all dbz fans grew up with its like they didn't want you having the pleasure of viewing the orginal v.h.s. or older dvd versions they first made that cost nearly 20 dollars a copy when they first came out so they made these versions that they changed on purpose so you can still enjoy the orginal dbz seasons but NOT the same versions that were made years back that's for sure and that's my point if you love high def and quliaty and widescreen dbz and crappy japense music so much than this is the right boxsets for you but if you really want to see the orginal dbz as intended that we dbz fans grew up and fell in love with I highly reccomend buying the orginal seperate funimation u.s. versions of dragonball z made years ago they're a lot cheaper now on amazon and ebay this is all just my personal opinion however thank you and take care.,1364169600,,2716,4.613636363636363

2524763,5,B000ENUKY4,"I am a big fan of Dragon Ball Z and recently ordered all nine Box Sets. The only thing I disliked was that none of them came with the 24 page booklet with episode summaries and timelines like in the description. A lot of people said that they didn't like the transfer from 4:3 to 16:9. It wasn't as bad as they made it out to be, but then again my TV is 16:9. I really liked that option of being able to watch it with Bruce Faulconer's music, like on Toonami. The first time I saw Dragon Ball Z was on Toonami (Cartoon Network), so maybe that's why I like the US music so much; but I like the original music too.

I enjoyed this product because it has the original funimation voice actors in it with improved graphics. The quality of the DVDs on a bluray player make the quality even better. One thing that may defer fans in the United States is that it does not contain the original music that was added when they dubbed over the Japanese in English.

When I have purchased these remastered sets in the past from other retailers, I have received an episode guide booklet. I am disappointed with Amazon for not including these in my order. They can be very helpful to those who are deeply into the Dragon Ball Z series just as I am.

The video and audio quality is also very good in this collection. It is presented in 5.1 dolby digital. The dialogue has also been revised.

Super cheap ($13.17)
Great show
Still had booklet
Cons:
Missing sleeve
Disc one very scratched and hard for DVD player to read but I was able to eventually watch the whole disc.",1344470400,,183,4.575757575757576
2524779,4,B000ENUKY4,"After watching 30 minutes of this, I couldn't wait to write and share what I found! I got this not to have anything to do with the English version. After checking out clips and English episodes I decided the Japanese audio was easily the best, and with the reason I'm learning Japanese I decided I was going to make it work for me as a big practice project. I was committed that if I EVER got these I would NEVER have anything to do with the English version. It is in every way an improvement. Even though I find Goku more entertaining and interesting in Japanese, his English voice actor is still the one good thing in the English form. But let me be totally clear, between the two Japanese Goku wins. Others are even further superior in Japanese.

I was, and still at times, critical of the show mostly for the ""not quite real Earth"". I have no problem with dinosaurs scattered in the wild, but what really bugged me was the random animal-people citizens and the unreal style of cities using ""Bubble building. I used to think this show was half brilliant and half awful. So I spent some long time undecided, and the preference for the Japanese version put it over the top! I'm more comfortable considering a clearly alternate ""Earth"". I've heard it called Dragon world at times. I tend to like that.

After what I had heard about the ""Orange bricks"" I hoped for a picture I was happy with. As I thought, my TV and player gave the picture a boost absolutely! Picture mode set to vivid for animated stuff, blu ray player to enhance the movie and I was impressed, at one point I realized the picture reminded me of what I knew about the dragon boxes. Vivid mode almost always was best. I tried sports mode but after a second I thought it was a bit dark. In all the modes the colors lean a little dark. Browns and medium blues become not quite blackish shades. The blues on Goku are a good example, and I have no issue with those being more to the darker side. If I remember, the orange is a great shade. No one should be surprised a good TV and player will bring out more. Most video looks truly great. Some I can understand how it might be improved. Sound is a little less sharp on Japanese audio. Typical of other funimation stuff these DVDs don't recognize my settings to automatically use the Japanese. But it seems I was right, this will be good for practice. I grabbed 4 sets on sale so I would have lots of episodes to practice and study.

The Wide screen fit is only even really noticeable at times. I was afraid of something far more extreme from what I had heard. If the specs change, I might go ahead with reviews of other seasons (Only getting 6 and some movies). I want to cut out the Majin Buu stuff. With the negatives other people talk about, you shouldn't be afraid to get these. Some people and their electronics might get more or less benefit. That's what it comes down to. I'll assume you know there are other releases too.",1342656000,,2942,4.364963503649635
2524780,4,B000ENUKY4,"To start this out I must say that these season sets are not for a Hard Core collector. For those hardcore fans that want all the bells and whistles I would recommend purchasing the Dragon Boxes, but for those of you that enjoyed this show back in it's cartoon network days and just want to own the show to watch and enjoy this release is perfect for you.

First I must get into what all is included in these releases. For the first time ever you can own all 219 episodes uncut at an amazing price. Each set has anywhere between 20-40 episodes on it (rough estimate). Three audio options are offered: Original Japanese, and also for the first time ever an English dubbed version with the original Japanese Soundtrack. The other audio option is somewhat special to fans of the cartoon network version. These sets contain an audio track labeled U.S. broadcast version, this track contains the English dub with the music used on Toonami/Cartoon network. The broadcast version audio has a soundtrack composed by Nathan Johnson for the first 2 seasons and then switches to Bruce Faulconer's soundtrack for the rest of the series starting at season 3, In this aspect these releases are superior to the Dragon Boxes because the Dragon Boxes only contain the Japanese Soundtrack. Each season Includes 6 disk and a small booklet contain episode and character information.

As I mentioned before this collection is more for the casual fan, not for people wanting a perfect Japanese release. This is mostly because the video is not as great as It could be. The original Dragon Ball Z series was Broadcast in a Full 4:3 aspect ration (This is how It would be seen on the Dragon Boxes), But these seasons sets have the video cropped down to a 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio causing some loss of Detail at the top and bottom of the screen. That however does not ruin the viewing and sometimes even adds to it. However the remastering process Funimation put the episodes through is where the trouble begins. The remastering process was done by a grain removing machine, this cleaned up dirt and other marks on the original film and it does look nice at times, but there is a downside. The Dragon Ball Z film is really old and at some points the removal process would remove lines and details from characters, this does look awkward but It's not horrible. Colors look off every now and then, but overall the video looks decent and the quality is still better than the video on the Funimation singles releases.

Overall I give this release a 7.5 out of 10

The Good:
-Low Price
-Uncut
-3 Audio Tracks
-Information Booklet

The Not So Good:
-Cropped Video
-Off Colors
-Loss of Detail

*Perfect to just watch and enjoy, I've already purchased 8 seasons and I plan on purchasing the ninth.",1340323200,,2766,4.669404517453799
2524781,5,B000ENUKY4,"excellent price for a timeless classic and still my fave tv/kid series. was a bit different regarding how i remember but that's obviously due to being digitally remastered.

an awesome buy.",1339372800,,189,5.096774193548387
2524782,5,B000ENUKY4,"This DVD set is fantastic. Some people are complaining about the cropping, but to be honest I don't even notice while watching it. Plus you technically get extra footage on the right and left to make up for some of the top and bottom being removed. The video quality and color is amazing, this is absolutely the best way to watch DBZ, I love this show. A must buy for any fan.",1338076800,,376,4.236111111111111
2524783,5,B000ENUKY4,The first season is great if you want a small story of what the premis is about here you go.. After five peaceful years a new enemy has arrived earth could be in trouble.... I highly recommend everything dbz except ultimate tenkiaichi,1337990400,,234,4.595238095238095
2524784,5,B000ENUKY4,"I remember when toonami was still on and fat tom was hosting (back in the day) they would show DBZ, DB, Big-O, Gundam, and so much more. This is the original uncut unedited, filler and all version of DBZ (Dragon Ball Z) I prefer this over the dumb Dragon Ball Z Kai simply because I like the filler in this anime. If you remember watching this on toonmai then you know why I love this version and not the Z Kai version. The Z Kai is good as far as the fight scenes go but its not the same people who know the series from back in the day understand.

If you don't know this anime then this is a great start for a great anime. The packaging isn't the greatest and by that I mean that the dvds are in a sleeve and its a little hard to put them back in the sleeve and it kinda ruins the edges because of this, I would've preferred one big solid container and for that I give the packaging 3 stars because if your careful enough you can avoid the dents and nicks and bending of the edges.",1325289600,,983,3.989847715736041
2524785,4,B000ENUKY4,"UPDATE: I just figure out a few weeks ago that the original that is the best version of season one of DBZ is called the Ocean dub done but a group in Canada. That version was the way season one should be but unfortunately you can only find it on Ebay VHS and the dvd version is very rare I couldn't find it.

Dragon Ball Z was great when I watched it many years ago. The episodes that I watched before it arrived had a totally different english voice cast and the music was also spot on.  I know everyone wants Vegeta to sound like he does in all the other dragon boxes but I really think the acting done before merits attention.  I listened to the music in this dragon box and it really doesn't make sense compared to the original 28 episodes.

Thats another thing there are 39 episodes in this box somehow they figured out a way to add in 11 episodes worth of filler or pausing a freezed scene when they are talking to add more dialouge to the original 28 episodes and yes both original and this dub are 20 minutes each episode. (28th episode of the original being the part where bulma and Mr popo are freaking out about the namekian ship and the end of the season now its episode 39)
The last two episodes go over from what is apparently in the original 28 episode 37 would be around the time bulm and popo are in the namekian ship as it was in episode 28. So instead of 39 - 28 its 37-28 = 9 x 20 minutes= 180 minutes of added useless scenes and dialouge.  Theres even one scene in snake's palace where a girl commits suicide its really weird and useless I mean ok i get they are trying to keep goku from escaping and tricking him into that but c'mon that wasn't in the original and stupid.

And theres the other thing the dialogue is changed from the original. Radditz's dialouge and voice were great in the original.  All that is changed his laugh is a bit over the top now call me crazy.  Also they really killed some of the key parts with the music lol and some of the dialouge they changed make no sense.  I know some may not know the difference but for me I couldn't believe it and loss of one star most people will enjoy it just the same I'm like a freak when it comes to this stuff.

I got this season along with season 2 in one box so maybe there is a difference from getting just season one.  Shouldn't affect people seeing this for the first time I guess but the original was a cleaner to the point season with 28 episodes instead of 39 with less unadded stuff.",1324857600,,2476,4.148225469728601
2524786,4,B000ENUKY4,THIS IS NOT THE VERSION SEEN ON TV. Not the same quality. I used to watch Goku myself and now my sons are watching DBZ on TV. I got these for them today(X-Mas) but the picture quality is pretty...bad. I can tell and so can my kids the drawings/cartoons looks out dated if it make sense! Still it's one of those DVD series you just have to own.,1324771200,,343,4.0588235294117645
2524787,5,B000ENUKY4,This is a must have for any DBZ fan!  Season 1 is the beginning of the Z series.  What a great storyline with funny and plenty of action!,1324425600,,137,3.857142857142857
2524788,4,B000ENUKY4,"To start off, this is a great season and it's worth the price of $11. The only complaint is the freezing issues I get on about a few episodes. But that doesn't stop it from being an awesome buy!",1324252800,,194,4.0
2524789,3,B000ENUKY4,"I was really hoping to hear the ""Rock The Dragon"" theme at the beginning of these episodes. But they all have the Japanese intro music. All the reviews I had read said that the English dub had the US music, but they meant the music during the episodes, not the intro. I remember watching DBZ on Cartoon Network, and the main reason I bought the season 1 orange box was for the intro I remember, but I was sadly surprised.

As for the widescreen, I don't mind it. So many are screaming that it cuts out a lot of the picture, and there are parts that you can tell are cut off (people's foreheads, feet, etc) but I don't mind. The sound is good, also.

My main gripe is the lack of the intro I remembered from Cartoon Network. That is basically the only reason I gave it such a low review score. Other than that, the episodes bring back a lot of memories and I'm having a great time watching them!",1322870400,,894,4.191860465116279
2524790,5,B000ENUKY4,DBZ is the first anime I ever watched. I remember coming home from my Christian school (trust me I'm not very religious at all) and stumbling across it one day and from that very moment on I was hooked. I would come home ever day and watch the new episodes on TV. (I actually thought Cell was real lol) I didn't discover this series until the very end of the Frieza saga heading into the Android series so when I bought this I knew I was gonna get to see everything that I had missed. The discs are great and I intend to get season 2 soon. IMO this is the greatest anime series ever created. It's what got me into anime and manga. Did you know the creator of the series wanted to end with the Frieza saga but he went all the way up to Buu cause the fans wanted more? Now that's dedication. I remember crying when the series ended because that is how sad I was AND I'M AN ADULT!!! ALL HAIL DBZ!!!,1318809600,,895,4.062146892655368
2524791,5,B000ENUKY4,"Definitely worth all the money its worth and more. Dragon Ball Z Season One (Vegeta Saga) brings a definite source of entertainment. this set brings a great introduction to one of the greatest animes/tv shows of all time. the set includes (--SPOILER--)

the every episode from the beginning (raditz arrival?) to the aftermath of Vegeta's departure.

(--SPOILER--)

After watching season one of dragon ball z, it definitely brought me back to the DBZ craze. when i was younger DBZ used to be my life, now this set resparked my love for the show, Thank you Akira Toriyama, and Thank You Amazon.",1314403200,,592,4.841584158415841

I checked out all the discs to make sure they were clean and the first disc was incredibly scratched so I played it and twice my DVD player said could not read disc. Sometimes it's skippy as well, how annoying! The other discs were pretty much okay looking but who knows. Gunna be pretty hard to watch the whole season if you can't get past the first disc.",1313107200,,550,4.19811320754717
2524793,5,B000ENUKY4,"I read every negative review on this product before ordering, and I have to say they were all wrong. I got mine in and have watched all episodes on the first 5 discs. People always claim it is no good to watch because they cut the film down. So it is zoomed in more than the original. Honestly I barely noticed even the slightest difference. Looked better than it did 10 years ago for sure. I absolutely loved being able to watch one of my favorite shows from my childhood in HD. If you are a fan of the series, or a newcomer debating on buying DO NOT TRUST THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS! Only thing I can recommend id to buy and watch Dragonball first as you will get the story from Dragonball Z better. It has been a long time since I saw Dragonball, so when I first started watching this I was a little lost. My favorite seasons overall have to be 3 and I think 6(it might be season 5 or 7). 3 is the Frieza saga and 6 is the Cell saga. Best ones ever. I'm not going to get into detail like some reviewers do, if you want to know more about the show my best suggestion is buy it.",1313107200,,1073,4.018691588785047

I have the whole series on VHS Uncut, the DVD sets Uncut, and now I am beginning my collection on these. So far I have seasons 1-4 and this one along with the others are all great! 5 star material all the way! My only complaint with these new sets are that they are not using the music I grew up with! Perfect cell theme, Hell's Bells, etc. Other than that though these are great quality! With excellent sound effects and visual unseen in the series before! And c'mon its centered around the coolest race of Humanoids....THE SAIYANS! Radditz, Vegeta, Nappa, you just cant go wrong their!",1310947200,,688,4.425196850393701
2524796,5,B000ENUKY4,"The Dragon Ball Z Series is an anime that a lot of people hold dear to their hearts, if your reading this then chances are you grew up watching DBZ as well. I myself watched DBZ for about 4 years. I stopped watching it right at the end of the Cell games (when Goku gave up fighting Cell) I always regretted not finishing the series off. I found these on Amazon (seasons 5-9 on here and 1-4 at wal-mart) and decided it was time I finished the series off.

What you get here is truly amazing, the box art is fantastic and well done, everything is in high quality, if you collect all the ""orange"" boxes it forms ""Dragon Ball Z"" on the spine. The back of the boxes will also form the Japanese lettering you always see (I assume it also means DBZ). The question is though, is the Dragon Box better quality? Unfortunately that answer is yes, the packaging is of collector quality and each disc has a different art on it (unlike this set which is a mirror image of the boxes) the only reason I got these instead was because I already purchased 4 of these and was committed to buying the rest. Although from what I can tell the video is all the same. As many of you know, the DBZ series was completely remastered It's been lightened and has been through a noise reduction machine. The image was cropped, but in all honesty, unless you are the hardest of the hardcore DBZ fan this will not bother you, I've been watching the series on my 60"" Plasma and its looks fantastic. The pictures you see on Amazon show that details were left out, but those are still pictures, while watching episodes you will not notice that kind of stuff.
In this box set you have a few different audio options, the first is a re-translated English dub with Japanese music (the re-translation is only slightly different) original TV broadcast English dub (this one is my favorite as it has all the American music in it) or Original Japanese mono audio (this is of poor quality, it is from the late 80's) there really isn't anything in the special features, and you get a few trailers to watch in the last disc of each episode. There are a few things missing from these box sets the first is the ""next time, on DBZ"" video they show, and the American opening was dropped (you get the Japanese opening).  Again nothing that's a deal breaker unless you're hardcore.
The amazing thing about these box sets is the price, you can't go wrong for $25-$40 a set, in their original form FUNimation released the original broadcast episodes (usually containing 3 episodes per DVD) for $10, there were 87 of these DVD's.
Well that was fairly long (as a side note my future reviews of the DBZ set's will be much shorter) I hope this helps you in making a decision! Overall though I do recommend the Dragon boxes, they work out to the same price as all nine of these seasons (plus you get almost 100min more of DBZ on each Dragon Box! You just have to wait a little while for the last 2 boxes to come out though, so if you MUST have all the DBZ season now, then the orange boxes are your best bet)",1309910400,,3048,4.34561403508772

At times it may be a little slow, but the off beat humor keeps u going. And after this the show only gets better. I do think the season should've ended at episode 36, and left us on a cliffhanger, by the next episode they r already on another mission and it just doesn't fit.

After i purchased them i read online about the whole cropping issue. I was saddened because i already ordered 3 of them. When i watched it however I found out that even on a regular television, the cropping doesn't really affect it that much.

Yes it does cut of some but if  you are really that upset that you can't see Vegeta's  top spike, maybe you should stop watching DBZ and possible think of a new hobby. But all-in-all good deal.",1303948800,,385,3.871794871794872
2524801,4,B000ENUKY4,"I bought this off Amazon to watch in New Zealand.  The DVDs are multi-regional (1, 2, 4) so this is very convenient for us Southern Hemespherians (is that a word?) at an unbeatable price!

>>First off, this box set kicks butt.
If you don't know much about the DBZ DVD releases, this set is referred to as ""orange box"".  It's a remastered copy of the japanese episodes.  Yes, there's real fighting.  The days of seeing a raised fist and then someone flying off, are over!  This is how Toriyama wanted viewers to see his anime.  No more PG editing scrubbing out all the good stuff.

>>Ok so the technical aspects.
The footage has been cropped down to 16x9 (widescreen) from 4x3.  This effectively means there is image at the top and bottom missing.  This can be noticeable but never so bad that someones head is cut off during an important dialogue so don't worry.  To compensate, there is some additional image on the sides (but only a percent or two).  So why this cropped version instead of the 4x3 ""dragon (yellow) box""?  The audio.  DBZ is the one and only anime where the english dub is better than the japanese.  My preferred audio option is the English 2.0 With Music.  It just suits better with some electronic/rocky music in a fight scene than japanese triangles and flutes.  Dragon box does not have this audio option.  Watch this on a widescreen tv.  My preferable setup is running off a laptop with media player classic so you can remove the blackbars.  Don't zoom on your TV remote to remove the blackbars or you'll miss out on a lot of picture.

>>The DVDs and boxset
For all those collectors out there, the DVDs come in a ""photobook"" of sorts, all nicely packed with an information booklet (containing some art, character bios and episode summaries).  The photobook comes inside printed cardboard sleevebox.  This is wrapped up in plastic.  Each DVD has around 7 episodes, watcheable as seperate episodes or in ""marathon mode"" (with the opening and ending cut)

>>The episodes
This boxset effectively covers the saiyan saga from episode 1 to 39.  The broadcast version most people watched as kids were only 28 episodes so do the math and thats 10 episodes of content you missed out on!  Each episode is around 25 mins and includes an opening, intermission and closing.  If these irritate you, just go ""marathon"".

>>The verdict
I give this orange box set a 4/5.  Four and not five because of the cropping.  However I'd rate the dragon box 4/5 too because of the missing audio track.  So orange box or dragon box?  I say orange.  DBZ Kai has also been released and is coming down to some decent prices.  It's re-done the footage and re-dubbed the audio to ""cut all filler content"" and moves at around 3 times the speed!  Maybe a bit too quick.",1303344000,5,2756,4.610309278350515

Personally i think the first three sagas were the best. don't get me wrong i like the cell and buu sagas. but i am a fan of these. DBZ is set 5 years after Goku defeated the son of King Piccolo at the world tournament. since then goku has been living home with his wife ChiChi and they have a son named Gohan. One day Goku and Gohan go to Master Roshi's house for a reunion. but then a mysterious person arrives whose name is Raditz. Raditz explains that goku is a saiyan who was born on the Planet Vegeta which his birth name is Kakarot. Raditz also explains that Goku was sent to earth to kill all the civilians and take the planet over. but then a mysterious old man named Grandpa Gohan who finds goku in the woods and takes care of him. one day goku hits his head badly on a rock making him losing his memory of conquering the earth. it is also told that the reason why goku has been transforming into an ape is because of his tail. when saiyan see the full moon they see it and turn into a giant ape. Raditz then attacks goku and kidnaps Gohan. Piccolo then arrives and says that he knows of raditzs power and says they should team up and kill raditz once they do piccolo and goku will have another fight. so they defeat raditz. but before dying raditz says there are two more saiyans arriving on earth in one year to take the dragon balls, he says that they are much powerful than he is. so piccolo kills raditz but goku is also killed too. sacrificing his life to save the earth. goku then goes on to train in other world to search for king kai. piccolo trains with gohan and the z fighters train themselfs.

2524804,1,B000ENUKY4,"We purchased Season one of Dragon Ball Z for our 12 yr. old.  He was so excited when it arrived.  A few days later, he made me aware of some very inappropriate scenes.  Needless to say, he was embarrassed to show them to me, and even left the room.  I was shocked when I saw the following:  One scene was of a boy getting out of a bathtub, fully nude, showing the front of the boy in detail.  Next was a scene of an old man telling a teen aged girl that he wanted to see her panties.  She finally gave in and when she pulled the bottom of her dress up, she wasn't wearing anything under it.  Her bare bottom was shown.  Then, a man arrived at the door of another girl (or maybe it was the same girl - not sure), and she was wearing a form-fitting shirt which revealed the outline of her breasts.  The man began to fantasize groping her.  We returned the set and Amazon was great to work with us on the matter.  I realize a lot of people don't care what their kids watch on t.v. or at the movies.  I also realize this is probably an adult cartoon.  However, there are some people (like me) who believe this is inappropriate material for kids.  My son was disturbed about it too so that says a lot.  I was not going to give it any stars on this review, but it wouldn't allow me to publish without doing so.",1297468800,2,1304,4.0549019607843135

For a quick overview it is a series about Goku a warrior that is the savior of Earth from the first Dragon Ball series.  He has to team up to defeat several aliens called Saiyans to protect Earth.  It is really full of action in all but a few episodes.  It is also a really funny series with great characters, both good guys and enemies.

For this DVD, it boasts that it includes the original US Audio, US Audio with Japanese music, and Japanese audio but that's not entirely accurate.  Both English versions feature an alternate intro song.  Neither include the original Japanese intro song or the US intro.  In order to hear the Japanese intro song it has to be on the Japanese language track.  But that is really my ONLY complaint about the series or the DVD.",1296691200,,832,4.421052631578948

2524809,5,B000ENUKY4,"The first season of Dragon Ball Z, the beginning of the series, is in this reviewer's humble opinion, the best the show has to offer.  Now, yes, this is saying quite a lot considering the show goes on for another 10 seasons or so, I'm not sure to be honest, but this is the first of many a story-line to follow and yet is to sum it up, more solid and believe it or not, realistic than all the seasons to follow.
  The beginning of DBZ had a definite carry-over from the creators previous series, Dragonball, which is essentially a part of the same story and plot.  The carry-over includes characters, style, pacing and references to Dragonball's storylines.  For instance, the character Launch, or the Indians at the bottom of Kurin's Tower.  If you watch Dragonball and then Dragonball Z afterwards, it will add a lot to the viewing experience because you'll understand what the characters had to go through to get to where they are at the beginning of DBZ.  You'll also understand the relationships between the characters and why certain things in the story are shocking to the characters - for instance, Goku having a reunion with his friends and bringing his son.
  Sadly, as Dragonball Z progresses, much of the initial style and emphasis is left in the dust.  DBZ slowly becomes more of a show about energy levels and who is the strongest warrior in the universe, but that isn't really a part of Season 1 here and that's what makes this season one of the best.  It has that great beauty and style that Dragonball had; there's still a respect from the characters towards martial arts, technique, mastery, concentration, etc., there's much more Japanese culture embedded in the story, and we're still in this future civilization or perhaps alternate universe where there are anthropomorphic animals in society and air-ships conveniently stored in pocket-able capsules that can be brought out in a jiff.  There's even an appreciation for nature that's really evident in these episodes and sadly, once the show progresses into the 2nd and 3rd seasons, this style of story-telling is abandoned, which changes the show considerably.
  But to truly capture what I'm talking about, you have to watch the show subtitled so as to capture the original Japanese writing.  It amazes me how much the American dubbing changed the meanings.  It ruins it, to be blunt.
  So if you're interested in watching a show from the late 80's, early 90's, from a wonderfully creative mind that gives a Japanese perspective of a wild, dangerous world that can be overcome by warrior virtues - vision, courage, determination, confidence, discipline, etc... - that mixes humor, action and the drama of kill or be killed, then pick up a copy - and you gotta get it uncut.  DBZ, seasons 1 and 2 are definitely two of the best Anime's ever made.",1289520000,3,2818,4.785123966942149

2524812,4,B000ENUKY4,"DBZ is one of the best anime series ever. I have all nine season sets and I love them. Of course some fans are not too happy with them because of the footage was cropped into wide screen and colours alterd to make it look more modern. I'm refering to Hard Core fans, Fans of the original japanese version and the original footage. Of course the cropping doesnt really bother me since it was only a little bit and I don't care about perfect footage. As long as I am able to watch the series in a decent way thats good enough for me. Now about the audio. You can watch the series in 3 diffirent ways on these discs. The original japanese version, English dub with japanese music, and english dub with funimation music , which in my opinion is a more accurate music. I watched the series in both musics and I found the funimation music to be better, of course if you prefer japanese music then thats your descion but I will always support the funimtion music. Now about the diffirence between the dragonbox. The Dragonbox was not intended to be released in other regons but funimation insisted. The Dagonbox has the original full screen footage and the coulors remain unaltered. This is a good thing espeacilly if you prefer it that way but there is a downside. The Dragonbox is mostly aimed at japanese fans so all the names of characters episodes and techniqes relate to the original japanese. Now this probobly wouldnt bother dub fans since you are able to watch it in English dub but there is no funimation dub music. So if your a dub fan you might be a bit dissapointed with it. Also the Dragonbox is not completed yet so it will be while before you have all of them. How you prefer to watch the series is your decision and so is which collection you buy. However I recommend the season sets, ignore the fact that it was cropped a little, you can still see it clearerly and you can watch it in 3 diffirent ways it makes it good for dub fans and japanese fans. If you have any other questions I'd be happy to answer.",1285200000,,2017,4.352785145888594

2524818,3,B000ENUKY4,"Ever since it was released back in 1989, Dragon Ball Z has become one of the most popular anime shows to have ever come out of Japan. A majority of its fans praise it for its story, characters, and action. But I'm not a part of the majority. I don't see it as a classic. The story wasn't compelling enough for me to actually care about it. The fight scenes are surprisingly mediocre (but then again, this WAS made about twenty years ago). The music is cheesy and never listenable. The biggest disappointment, at least in my eyes, are the characters. And I'm not talking about their personalities, I'm talking about their designs. Their appearances are ridiculously over-the-top: I mean, take a look at the muscles, the hair, the awkward shape of their eyes (I know it's Japanese, but still...). There is basically nothing I can engage with. It's all just fighting, flying, fighting, talking, making jokes, more fighting, more flying, more talking, more fighting...you get the idea. I will say, however, that the fight scenes ARE pretty intense, even if some of them are a bit predictable and repetitive. Some of the jokes work, and the animation is pretty decent.

In the end, I have to say that I'm really unimpressed with Dragon Ball Z. It's not the worst that I have ever seen, but it does have its flaws.

I didn't grow up on DBZ like the purists out on the net (you know who you are). I'm not gonna talk about the contents of this release (episodes and story info). I like this set in widescreen personally. For me it feels more episodic like other shows in widescreen.

On the plus side you get to watch the entire Saiyans story that was originally intended for the Ultimate Uncut Editions, but instead ended up on Cartoon Network (which I personally recorded). And on less discs than said edition. My only complaint is that you can't view the original credits for the intro (opening) as well as the opening song for the revised dub/japanese bgm selection. So what?

I've grown to like anime in widescreen, because I like the bars at the top and bottom of my screen. This was FUNi's decision to widescreen DragonBall Z and it's worked out pretty darn well. The purists need to get over it.",1265587200,,1029,4.468085106382978

2524830,5,B000ENUKY4,"Dragon Ball Z, the series that got many fans, like myself, into Anime to begin with. After Funimation frustrated a lot of fans by cutting off their redubbing and re-releasing of the first saga in the series (originally called the Saiyan Saga, now the Vegeta Saga) the company finally starts to do the series proper. Released in an uncut format with restored video clarity, reformatted for widescreen display, and with new audio treatment we finally get the series proper, and it looks good.

The Audio comes in three tracks, Japanese in Mono, English with the Television broadcast music in Stereo, and English with the Japanese music in surround sound. There are separate caption sets for English and Japanese dialog, so you can literally watch the dub while reading the sub to see what differences there are. Overall the sound is good no matter which track your using. Since this set features the complete and uncut saga, it is also the first release of Funimation's redubb of the early episodes. When dragon ball z was first imported to the US it was heavily edited for network television and featured voice talent from a Canadian company called the Ocean group, working under Pioneer. It wasn't until halfway through the Namek/Ginyu force saga that the series was cancelled on television and dubbing stopped. Years later DBZ appeared again on Cartoon Network's Toonami program, and eventually was picked up by the then very small Funimation. Funi picked up where Pioneer left off, and was forced to change the cast of voice actors completely. Years later, after completing all three shows that make up the series, Funi decided to return to the early episodes of DBZ so they could release them uncut and with consistent voice actors. While much of this newly dubbed version was released on regular DVD, funimation cancelled it just before the fight between Goku and Vegeta got started (I'm sure I wasn't the only unhappy fan at that point) and much later finally gave us this box set with the complete saga.

The Video of the season set has been cleaned up and restored considerable. As many have mentioned this process wasn't perfect, but it looks a lot better then previous releases of these episodes. The new colors make the images look a lot sharper and the restored framerate makes all the animations look a lot smoother. The difference is definitely noticeable. The transfer is also reformatted into widescreen, standard 16x9 ratio. There's no black bars. While many fans do complain about the cropping, you're actually not missing anything in the space that is lost. Moreso every version of the series released so far has been cropped, including the standard 4:3 ratio display. Again, no matter which format you watch the image is slightly cropped and it is very minor.

There aren't any features worth mentioning. Funimation included some trailers for other DBZ related merchandise as well as for other DVD releases. There is a marathon feature that allows you to play consecutive episodes without the extra opening and ending credits and the episode previews. This is an excellent feature for fans.

As for the story, the Saiyan/Vegeta saga is my favorite across all three shows. The struggle against the Saiyan's is so desperate, and even Goku gets killed very early in this new series. The good guys really get their rear ends handed to them and even in the end they had to pull everything out of the bad to barely scrape away a win. It cost them most of their friends' lives and even the dragon balls themselves were lost. Few times have Earth's heroes ever faced a situation so dire. The action was top notch in this series. Nappa, Vegeta, and Raditz didn't use cheap gimmick attacks to get wins over the fighters, or absorb other beings for unfound power. They were just that strong. And the fight near the end between Goku and Vegeta is my favorite fight in the entire series.

All in all this set is a great economical buy for any fan! For the price point you just can't go wrong!",1261872000,,3998,4.813682678311499

2524833,5,B000ENUKY4,"Back in my elementary and middle school days, I use to watch Dragonball Z about every day. I waited patiently for each new episode with great anticipation. Unfortunately, if you missed one episode, you missed it for good until the season was over.  I hated that aspect of it all. Finally, years later, the most popular anime ever created hits the DVD shelves. I admitt I'm not really an anime fan but DBZ has always captivated me with it's interesting characters and incredible detail and action sequences. Now fans can own the complete series uncut, fully remastered both audio and visual wise. Excellent!! ALso included is the original Japanese dialouge and music, a interesting option to enjoy DBZ in its original form.  If you're a die-hard fan this is a great way to start off your collection with the season that started it all, the Saiyan or Vegeta saga. Starring in my opinion the most thrilling and greatest character ever, Vegeta!!!!!!!!!!!!",1248739200,,951,4.900621118012422
2524834,5,B000ENUKY4,"Dragon Ball Z, in my mind it's just awesome. I used to watch it when I was a kid and loved the all the action in it. Then when I discovered these season boxsets that were out, I bought them as quickly as possilbe. Then I sat back and renewed all my memories of this show. The Vegeta Saga was a great way to start this series off in my mind. The characters from Dragon Ball are re-established and some new ones are introduced, like Gohan, King Kai and Vegeta. New story lines are brought in, but the comedy is still there and makes this show very entertaining to watch. You get 39 episodes for this first season and I can't complain. So if you haven't seen this show in a long time, I recommend you start buying this series since all the seasons are out on DVD boxsets and just enjoy an awesome show.

2524835,5,B000ENUKY4,"I just started digging into this new remastered uncut series.
I am just blown away.
The quality is outstanding.
Since I am a big Dragonball fan. With the dubs by Funimation.
Going from there to the awful dubs of Ocean group had been a huge disappointment.
I got used to the gang all sounding a certain way, & hearing them through the ocean dubs sounded bad & cheesy.

What makes this set essential is that it actually ties together much of the story that was missing from the cut series.
There are important subtleties within the storyline that are neatly tied together, where I had always disliked Z for just jumping around too much, without any explanation.
You can actually see here the development of the relationship between Piccolo & Gohan.

Episodes 36-38 actually become essential in this series instead of just filler episodes in the bad cut ocean version.
You connect with the loss of the z fighters & the aftermath before they head out to Namek.
Episode 30 you actually see Launch again, in her last scene ever which was cool for me because they all but forgot about her after DB.

I am excited to see how the Frieza & Trunks saga's are handled.
The Frieza series with ocean dub was Bleech!!
Took way too long & 5 minutes became half of a saga.
Also want to see if the DR. Gero storyline problems are better dealt with in the Trunks Saga.

I would highly recommend getting this series.
I am actually looking at Z now with a fresh outlook.
I am hoping that the quality remains throughout.",1244160000,,1498,4.516605166051661
2524836,5,B000ENUKY4,"Let me start off by saying this...If you are worried about buying this set because of the well known ""cropping-issue"" don't be.  It's not nearly as bad as most people make it out to be.  I finished watching it and there was not one instance where I could point out that it had in fact been cropped from the original episodes.  I had to go online and find the comparisons to even notice.  So yes there is cropping but in my opinion it in no way took away from the amazing experience of watching DBZ.

I think what I like about this the most is that they have redone the voice acting.  You can now watch the entire Dragon Ball Z series start to finish with the same voice actors.  That and the fact that you can get most of these sets for $24.99 makes this a steal of a deal.",1242691200,3,773,4.079470198675497
2524837,4,B000ENUKY4,I about 20 years old and have been watching Dragon Ball Z as well as other Anime TV show and movies. I bought the first season because I wanted to see some Dragon Ball Z but it was it on the TV. So I went looking for some and I found the first season with 39 in a box set. I really enjoyed watching all of the show. The show were better then I expected. Which is to say that I didn't expect a whole lot of a change from the TV shows but they were the best I had very seen of Dragon Ball Z. The shows were so good that I came back and got the second and third seasons. I'm planning right now to buy the rest of the seasons but need so money to do so.,1241654400,,649,3.642857142857143
2524838,5,B000ENUKY4,"I've been watching Dragon Ball Z since I was a child, and it's great to see the series come to season form. Definitely recommend it.",1240272000,,132,4.32
2524839,4,B000ENUKY4,"Dragonball Z Season 1

It is called the Vegeta Saga but it really should be called the Saiyan Saga because Goku learns his origins from his past from his older brother, Raditz and King Kai. Another reason is that two Saiyans, Nappa and Vegeta, come to Earth to take it over which results in an epic battle.
The one thing I just can't understand is how Raditz can have power level of 1,200. It is just so small even for a Saiyan! Like all Saiyans, they grow up and train on Planet Vegeta, which has 10 times Earth's gravity plus all the work that Freiza gave to the Saiyan race. Looking at Raditz he would probably be in his early 30s. I would understand if he had a power level of maybe 6 or 7 thousand.
This is the largest season of all with 39 episodes. It has a lot of different things happening leading up to the Saiyan battle. There are quite a few boring episodes, like `The Strangest Robot', `Plight of the Children', `A New Friend'.
The `Terror On Arlia' was a good episode and it showed what Saiyans are truly capable of.
In the booklet, it says that Vegeta and Nappa first appeared in Episode 11 `Terror On Arlia' but they actually appeared in episode 5 `Gohan's Rage' just after Raditz is defeated, Vegeta & Nappa are on a distant planet making plans to travel to Earth to wish for eternal life.

The Piccolo cover shot for Season 7 should be on Season 1 because it fits into what happened during Season 1.
The other Z Fighters who take part in the Saiyan battle could have won the battle even without Goku. Yamcha, Tien, Chiaotzu & Krillin train in the Pendulum Room and out on top of the Lookout, which would explain their power levels being equal or just stronger to that of a Saibamen. As Kami says `These men are full of fire but it's still not enough'. Kami should know that the Hyperbolic Time chamber is still there on the Lookout.

Also, this is the last season that Launch appears in.

It is a pity that all the people that Nappa killed (East City, the reporters & journalists and the people in the military and the other city) weren't brought back to life through the dragonballs. Nappa was fierce and I felt he could of turned up the intensity and gone completely berserk,which Brolly excels at, and when Vegeta kills Nappa, I did feel a little sorry for Nappa but then again he kill thousands of people on Earth. I think, Piccolo had to die because it would have given Goku, Krillin, Gohan and Bulma a reason to travel to Planet Namek. Also letting Vegeta go was also a right thing to do because he killed Qui, Dodoria, Zarbon, 4 Ginyu Force members and lots of Freiza's guards. If Krillin killed Vegeta with the sword back on Earth, Goku would have came and only fought Cui, Dodoria, Zarbon, 4 Ginyu Force members but not killed them. Thanks to Vegeta's ruthless side, he destroyed those henchmen who would have been responsible for killing thousands of innocent people from other planets. Having them gone just meant they couldn't kill any more people.

The fight between Goku and Vegeta was great! Goku's Kaioken Attack made for good watching. And having Vegeta transform into the Giant Ape was an added bonus. Looking at what Vegeta did to Goku in the Giant Ape state meant that Goku could of died a second time. Goku's body was crushed when Vegeta stamped on his legs, squeezed his body and crushed his body with his hands and Goku over exerted himself with the Kaioken Attack.
The other thing I can't understand is that battle went on for 2 days. Goku tells Master Roshi that he will arrive a day later. It should have been 2 days for Goku to get back to the Check In station in Other World since the trip on Snake Way is 10,000 miles long and he is in another dimension. On Earth, the fighting should have gone for the entire day starting about 8am and finishing around 6:30 to 7pm.

Overall this is a good season. Just a few episodes before the Saiyan battle can be boring. I rate it 4 out of 5.",1239580800,,3927,4.402203856749312

dragon ball z was like every boys favorite show back in the day casue the had never been anything like it before up until then. i remeamber waching it on Tonnami when i was like 11 or 12. anywho when i found out that they where brining back the old episodes on seessaon box sets i was totaly pumped up. the first thing i noticed about the box set was that it was in HD ""very nice"" plus you could hear the original japanese music over the english dialuge ""very very nice"" or you could hear the whole show straigh up in japanese or english. the characters looks like they where back in that season ""Goku's head likes kind of thin"" and Piccolo is a darker shade of green"" now there is one thing that steams my noddles about this and that is why it dosn't get 5 starts. for some reason they decied to NOT use the original voces for some ""if not all"" the characters like when you hear vageta he sounds like he does in the cell/majin buu sagas. that is not cool. also some of the dialoge has been changed which i think is very very stupid. well you be the judge but i thank we can all agree tha dbz rocks its only comparasion is naruto believe it",1223856000,2,1528,4.179661016949153

2524871,3,B000ENUKY4,"This set contains the 39 episodes that made up the first season, and they span six discs.  The first five discs each contain seven episodes, while the last disc contains four episodes and extras.

One thing I really liked about this set was the marathon feature.  This allows you to watch the episodes back-to-back, but only have to see the opening credits once (and the ending credits never show up in this feature).  I wish more DVD sets would include this feature.  The only drawback to the marathon feature, however, is the fact that it reinforces how much the story in the first season was stretched out.

Overall, the special features aren't much to get excited about.  The featurette, ""Dragon Ball Z: Rebirth -- Part 1"" has one of the colorists working on the restoration project talking about various aspects of the remastering project.  ""A New Look"" is essentially a three minute long commercial for the Dragon Ball Z remastered DVD box sets.  You can also see the opening and closing credits without the text covering the images.  There are also trailers included in the special features menu.

i cant enjoy the show anymore.

be careful if you are looking into buying this and are used to the old disks they are not the same at all.
and yes there is a lot of sceens that was not on the old disks.
that part i don't mind.
so if you think the music change will not bother you then yes it is a great set but if your like me and use to the old disks you will likey hate it. so i hope this help people like me that don't take change easy.
if you want to give it a try don't sell your old disks yet like i did till you tryed it. if i could get my disks back i would.
thats how bad the music made it for me.
dont feel the same at all.
but as i said other then that it could of been a great set.
oh well thats what i get for selling my disks too soon.
will i ever learn?

This particular season, was re-released by Funimation, the voices were re-done to be that of the Frieza Saga and beyond (all of you may know that Vegeta and Goku's voices sounded kind of wimpy when Pioneer did them). There are episodes that were NOT released to DVD originally by Pioneer, and these are all un-cut. Now lots of people are saying that this is ""cropped"", I have yet to notice them, yes, you did lose some screen on the top and bottom, but have you ever tried watching the 4:3 format of DBZ on a HDTV? It looks awful, it is very pixel lated, and blurry and whenever they do a Energy blast, you can see freckles around it.

2524892,3,B000ENUKY4,"When I was younger I remember watching Dragon Ball Z every weekend on some local television station. My brother and I would wake up early (or stay up really late) just to watch one highly edited episode, then we had to wait another week to watch where it left off.

One unfortunate weekend, we were waiting to see the final conclusion of an episode where Goku finally returns home after training to only find to our dismay that the television station had restarted the entire series. I had never bothered to watch Dragon Ball Z after that until now.

Now after watching it again it's exactly that same feeling, you watch about 10 episodes of Goku traveling to get trained, and then another 10 episodes returning from training just for a fight scene that doesn't reach a satisfying climax what so ever. Every 2 punches they throw is then filled in with 5 minutes of talking, and then someone charging up their energy to perform an even ""stronger"" move then the last...rinse, repeat.

If you're looking for pure unadulterated fighting violence I highly suggest looking at the Grappler Baki series and leave Dragon Ball Z to the elementary school kids.",1200614400,,1149,4.735

2524907,4,B000ENUKY4,"As a DBZ fan all throughout college and wasted somewhere between 2000-3000 dollars on videos. Funimation (the real English team behind DBZ) finally decided to bring the series of DBZ to DVD ha!(DBZDVD!). But it is much more than just seaons.

For those who need a little history the first two sagas of DBZ were own by Pioneer entrertainment and they edited the crap out of them. Also the voice acting was poor the background music stunk and the stories just weren't well put together you knew something was missing. Funimation took the series and created two versions for vhs and it was the first time you were able to see DBZ uncut in all its bloody glory. Also a brand new voice staff was brought in with voice talents of Sonny Strait, Christopher Sabbat etc.

The first season which introduces Goku and his friends from the preceeding series Dragon Ball and opens the story in a whole new way. Goku now learns he is from outter space and one of the last of his race called Saiyans. He also learned that Saiyans are not very nice especially when the first one he meets is his own older brother Raditz who tries to kill him. Now there are two more coming in search for the infamous Dragon Balls. It is up to Goku's sworn enemy Picollo to train Goku's 4 year old son Gohan that he has a power deep within and might just be more powerful than he knows.

This DVD set is worth it because now that Anime is so far beyond mainstreem on the western side of the world. It was time for Dragon Ball Z to be removed of its guenia pig status and finally be revieled that this was not a kids show! Even though it is cropped for wide screen format it really doesn't seem to bother me. But now the first seaons is uncut so the violence his not cleaned up there is plenty of cuts blood and bruses and most importantly there is more story and the voices from all the funimation owned sagas are doing what they do best for this first season. If you like DBZ this is a worthy set for your collection.",1191974400,,1983,4.2967914438502675

2524914,4,B000ENUKY4,"Quick Facts: I'm 27, been a fan of Dragon Ball Z since 1999, and a fan of anime since 1992. I'm very picky about uncut anime, and I always prefer the original aspect ratio. I dislike English dubs as most any anime fan does. This is my first review of a DVD.

Video: FUNimations claims this is a widescreen transfer from the original video. Dragonball Z fans are screaming the original video was cropped to make it widescreen. I've spent the last 2 days with WinDVD and Photoshop to confirm or disprove this. Anyone who does image editing knows that cropping a 4:3 image to 16:9 can be really dramatic. After watching 67 episodes of this new release from FUNimation, I wasn't completely convinced about the transfer being cropped from it's original 4:3 aspect ratio. Dragonball Z fans are correct to say the widescreen transfer is cropped, but they also would need to admit to that the 4:3 broadcast we fans know and love was also cropped! The widescreen transfer has extended video on the left and right that was cropped for the original 4:3 TV broadcast some 18 years ago. A time when 4:3 televisions were standard. In recent times, 16:9 televisions have taken over, and we're much more widescreen oriented. The original animation aspect ration I got when I was done sizing and layering the images over each other from the 4:3 and 16:9 gave me a 16:11 aspect ratio. This my Dragon Ball Z fans... Seems to be the ORIGINAL size. 16:11 though won't look all that great on any TV set. Also makes sense though since animators make the original larger so when transferring the animation to video, there's room to play with so you don't have random spots missing on the sides, top and bottom. So if you have to ask yourself if this is a legitmate 16:9 transfer or some 4:3 cropped (cut/edited) video, the real answer is... It's a legimate 16:9 transfer. Both the 4:3 and the 16:9 are cropped from the original... In the end, it depends on personal preference.

The video was supposedly cleaned up, and the colors remastered. Personally, For the most part, I see an increased brightness on the video, which actually does look better. They did clean up the video and removed grain and video noise. All in all, the remastered picture looks better compared to the original DVDs that FUNimation released.

Audio: I can't say much about the sound quality since I'm using my computer for the time being. Just moved, and have yet to hook up my home theater again. FUNimation is releasing this with 3 settings. The original Japanese language and music. Nothing seems to have changed between the original DVDs and this release. For those who watch DBZ subbed only, I see no change at all. The second option is the English dub with the Japanese music. This is actually quite interesting, and I give credit for this addition! In this rare instance, I have always like the dubs for Dragon Ball Z, so having the option to watch it with the original music is great. If that isn't enough though, this new way to watch the series is in Dolby Digital 5.1. Then there's the third option which is the English dub with the US music done by Bruce Faulconer in stereo. I guess doing this in 5.1 would have taken too much time.

The dub was also redone for whatever reason. After comparing the original DVDs vs the new ones, the older ones sometimes seem a bit more consistent with what was originally being said. One quick example would be this...

Japanese Audio: Vegeta ""I suppose""
Original English Dub: Vegeta ""I guess so""
New English Dub: Vegeta ""Shut up!""

Why FUNimation went out of the way to do a whole new dub, I have no idea... This seems to be wasteful of production time, or maybe they can't use the original dub anymore. Why FUNimation does anything at times is beyond my understanding. They have time to redub the series, but they can't make the English dub with the US music in 5.1...

The menus on these discs are light years ahead of the original DVDs FUNimation released, with much more chapter points, and the MARATHON option which allows you to watch all the episodes on a disc straight through without the opening/closing between the episodes. More like watching a movie than episode after episode, having to skip after each one.

The packaging of the discs in the case is rather nice. Seems upon collection the series, you can line them up for a large ""DRAGONBALL Z"" title! Each season comes with a small booklet with character information, episode information, etc.

Also want to note that according to FUNimation, this video was remastered on HD 1080/24p. This doesn't mean the discs are HD and can optimize the new HDMI 1.3, but it does show that 1080/24p mastering is being done, and we're probably not far off from seeing this much more commonly done and seeing HDDVDs with actual 1080/24p video as TVs are now coming out with HDMI 1.3.

I hope this information helps people looking to possibly buy this series or in the case I'm in, buy it again for the remastered video and widescreen version. Also much more compact compared to dozens of standard DVD cases!

Giving this 4 stars. Why not 5? Because there is still room for improvement. The new dub doesn't always seem to fit, and in comparison to the actual translation of what was being said, it's like comparing black and white. FUNimation was always lousy about the dub translation, and there's little excuse for rebubbing the series and making it just as poor as the first time around. Making the English Dub with Japanese music 5.1, but the US music in 2.0 is another point away from me. While this doesn't change anything for me, if they had the time to redub and upscale to 5.1 for the Japanese music, it seems to me they should have taken the time to upscale the US music track too. Lazy? Additionally, they should have some slight explanation of the widescreen transfer included. The extras on the discs are meaningless.

For the price these new box sets go for... It's an unbeatable deal for the series and Dragon Ball Z fans.",1188172800,132,5987,4.621825023518344
2524915,3,B000ENUKY4,"Being a big fan of anime I love watching all my favourite shows in the original Japanese language with the English subtitles. At first glance watching DBZ in Japanese was great however I was disappointed that Goku's Saiyan name is Kakkarot (The U.S. name) and not Kakkarotto (The Japanese name) also in Japanese they are known as Saiya-jin and ever though you hear it the subtitle reads Saiyan. Is this really the Japanese version of my favourite anime or is this Funimation's version of what the Japanese episodes should be? You might think I'm being foolish by making a big issue over minor things but I ask you if someone took your favourite book and reprinted it with errors, your favourite movie and remade it with differences, wouldn't you make an issue of it?",1186790400,,766,4.723880597014926

Honestly there was only 2 spots throughout all 6 discs that made me think that there was something cut off, and I only remember 1 of them, and it lasted a total of 2 seconds (tops!).

I held off on buying Season Two along with this one because of the talk of the cropping. However, there is nothing to worry about.

I'd never seen this saga before (nor most of DBZ except the Buu saga on up til the end, and some filler after the Frieza saga until Goku returned). Perhaps this is why nothing looks strange to me.

Juicier extras would've been nice. Oh well. It doesn't take away from the end product.",1186531200,,629,4.1735537190082646

upon my first viewing i noticed that often, too often, characters were partially or completely offscreen.  odd since i didn't remember this at all from the early days of dragonball viewing.  with a little zoom experimentation i soon realised that the dvds are indeed cropped generate the appearance of widescreen.  luckily for me my hd set also has it's own set of zoom features.  so if you're lucky all you have to do is zoom out on your dvd player, the first setting should do it, and zoom in on your television.  playing around with some of the aspect ratio settings on both your dvd player and tv may help too.  for about 15 minutes i was really angry with this boxed set, definitive indeed, but once i solved the cropping problem i couldn't be happier.  if you're really into dragonball, or like me just grew up on it, then you don't have much of a choice.  buy it.",1186272000,,1200,4.409090909090909

However, a portion of the picture is missing, as many have stated. So if you can buy this and accept the fact that a portion of the intended picture is missing, then you will enjoy it. If you are upset that the picture is cropped, then you probably should buy the ""3 episode"" uncut DVDs. And I highly recommend the original Japanese language with subtitles, because once you hear it without the terrible American voice overs, you will really appreciate it.

For those of us who were unable to get the (now out-of-print) Dragon Boxes, the adage ""better than nothing at all""  sums this box set up nicely.

As for the content itself - anyone buying this set probably knows what they're in for: lots of fighting, bizzare anime-only fillers, Gohan's incessant whining - and some VERY good payoff; the final Goku-versus-Vegeta fight is amazing.

The dub is HORRIFIC; Vegeta sounds like he smokes three packs a day and Christopher R. Sabat voices three of the main characters? No, thank you.

Also its not like any of the action is cut off by this I mean a piece of hair is occasionally cut off and in a couple of frames there is slight imperfections but that's just a small price that we have to pay to bring this show into the 21 century and also who doesn't want to pay $750 to a $1000 less to own all the episodes I mean come-on people this is a no brainer FUNimation got this one right and we the fans get to reap the rewards.,1180310400,4,943,4.048128342245989

2524923,4,B000ENUKY4,"I've watched both the anime and read the manga.  I probably prefer the books over the shows (back to front reading aside) because there is a lot less filler in the books.  Case in point, the episode ""plight of the children"" where Gohan escapes from his training regime with Piccolo so he can hang out with orphans until he decides to go back and continue his training with Piccolo.  The first episode is a yawner as well, with Gohan aimlessly wandering through the woods.  (Gohan's constant whining can be quite annoying)  The only thing that saves the episode from being the most boring waste of time ever is seeing Raditz show up and take out a farmer that shoots at him by plucking the bullet out of the air and throwing it and then casually flicking it back at him.

  Oh well, even though there may be some weak shows in the set it's still a good deal because the set is cheap enough it's worth the money just for the episodes that aren't crap.  Discs 1, 4, and 5 are probably the best, since they have all the battles with the Saiyans, Raditz, Nappa and Vegeta, the dude on the cover.

  The special features aren't all that great, although I liked the booklet with information on the characters and plot synopsis of the episodes.  As to the widescreen issue I was generally satisfied.  I did notice a fair amount of cropping.  Top's of certain character's heads getting cut off on the screen but in general I didn't notice until I read about it and started paying attention.  Still, it didn't affect my enjoyment of the show too much.  It's still easily worth the money and a good buy.",1180137600,3,1592,4.453287197231834

2524940,2,B000ENUKY4,"I had high hopes for this boxset, but I'm pretty disappointed.  Mostly my disappointment has to do with two things: the music and the ""widescreen"" presentation.  There is no arguing with the Japanese soundtrack, but the English music has to be some of the most boring and lazy work I've ever heard.  Poor and boring are the words that come to mind when I hear it.  I actually enjoyed some of the work Funimation did with the soundtrack previously, but here it just seems like practically no work was put into this soundtrack.  It's unacceptable for an action series.  My second gripe is with the widescreen or letterbox formatting of the video.  It was totally unneccessary and done badly.  The video seemed more cropped then augmented for the widescreen format.  The series is over 20 years old.  The original format would have suited me just fine.  As for the voice work, it's up to par and I can enjoy it in English or Japanese.  And the extras, even the little booklet with some of the DBZ history, is welcome and appreciated.  But Funimation has disappointed me with some critical mistakes on this project.",1178323200,,1111,4.694300518134715
2524941,2,B000ENUKY4,"I love the idea of remastering the DBZ seasons and releasing them on DVDs. The drawings are definitely better, and making the episodes uncut is a sweet idea. I used to watch the show frequently when cartoon showed them on a regular basis, and I bought this set hoping to relive those days somewhat.

I bought this set with high hopes that those complaining about the cropping were being too nit-picky. Unfortunately after viewing a few of the episodes I can see that they are 100% in the right. It is sometimes excruciating to watch as the camera zooms in and cuts off the heads of some important characters. This show was definitely made in the full-screen format, and should probably be kept that way.

If that was my only reservation I wouldn't be writing this review, but there are two other things that irk me. The first is the drawn out intros and theme music that funimation put at the beginning of each episode. They took out the sweet guitar theme that Americans know and love and replaced it with the cheesy music the Japanese versions used. Furthermore, they replaced the short intros with drawn out ones that are annoying to sit through by the 4th or 5th disc.

Finally, the voice acting is horrendous. Plain and simple. I used to think the DBZ episodes from the cartoon network were kinda bad, but this makes me appreciate those episodes dearly. The voices from this release sound as if Funimation ran out of money and hired one guy to do the voices for every character. Vegeta's and Goku's are exceptionally bad. I wish I could put sound clips to prove my point, but Amazon won't let me.

This season left a bitter taste in my mouth, and I will certainly not be buying any of the other releases. Instead I will dl the old episodes; sure they are edited and the drawings aren't retouched, but it certainly beats sitting through the horrible music, cropped scenes and horrendous voice acting.",1176422400,8,1904,4.607669616519174

This Episodes wich are newly remastered have a completely new feeling and IT IS a completely new experience, and in my Opinion it is a lot more fun to watch the remastered episodes ! And even the widescreen cropping is giving a new look to the Episodes, all is new !

Because the colors look more realistic and its just beautifull.

AND YES the automatic noise reduction sometimes looks disturbing but it looks perfekt 99% of the time.

So do not grumble about funimation they did a good job !

That widescreen feature is, obviously, not a good idea. But it's not as bad as it has been described here and on many anime forums. Sure, a 1.33 aspect ratio would have better. But everyone here should consider that getting 39 episodes for 30 bucks is a blast ! Sure the Dragon Boxes rocks, but they are very expensive and not subtitled.

The remastering: It is good, but it could have been better. There are still some picture problems out there. I hope funimation will make a better job in the futre.

I'm a foreigner. More precisely, I'm from France, and I can tell you, this show has been butchered here in a way that really make true anime fans puke ! Dragon Ball Z has been heavily censored, Heavily cut, no original version available, disastrous image quality etc...)

So that's is why I'm buying R1 DBZ DVDS...

I do own all the previous DBZ funimations releases, so I bought this set and I will probably buy the next one as well. The widescreen feature? I think I will live with it. I hope Funimation will re-release this set in a 1.33 format.

2524972,5,B000ENUKY4,"I just finished watching this box set with a friend who purchased it for he and his son.  Honestly, I don't know why everyone's complaining.  You can spend the outrageous amouont of money and purchase each individual disc (which has only 3 episodes), or you can buy this box set.  I read a review on Amazon's Season Two page (which I'd like to add a little asteric her, how can you review something that hasn't come out yet?) and was shocked at how someone could bludgen this incredible deal!  This reviewer said many things about lies form FUNimation and how all DBZ Fans have been dishonored and disgraced, but if you really stop and think about it, have we?  We now have a true Season 1, with a Season 2 on the way, and FUNimation has done away with the SAGA names, which for a non DBZ Fan can get confusing, which was a great step.  He also talked about how FUNimation cropped the original film when they digitally REMASTERED the series, I say again, DIGITALLY REMASTERED the series.  What it all boils down to is that I'm not going to sit down and watch both the Japanese and American versions and look for differences, because now you're just getting way too anal about a TV Show.  I've watched every season as released on Cartoon Network's Toonami (RIP), and it has been a while since I've seen the show, but after viewing the entire Season 1 most recently released by FUNimation, I can't complain.  Maybe there were small differences, but change isn't always a bad thing.  I think that people need to stop worrying about the little things and just be thankful for what they get.  Whether you're a Hardcore DBZ Fan, or never even heard of the series, this item is a great buy.  There are many viewers who may complain, but just remember that they are the ones who can't except anything good.  Outstanding job, FUNimation, it's just what we've been waiting for.",1174089600,3,1867,4.537313432835821
2524973,3,B000ENUKY4,"Cleaner picture, more episodes for a cheaper price, the Japanese BGM in the dubbed version... the list goes on for the positive (or at least assumed to be positive) things about this set. But all of these things are nulled out by one thing: WIDESCREEN.

The series was originally filmed in 4:3 (aka Fullscreen), so the excuse of gaining more on both sides is a fuzzy issue. Since the series was made in the '80s, it was animated using cels, which basically work like a flipbook. However, because the positioning of the camera taking the picture of each cel can be slightly off, animators took a precaution and put slightly more picture outside of the 4:3 reach. These parts are what FUNimation is referring to as the ""gained footage"" on both sides.

But they've completely avoided what they had to do to make the series widescreen. They actually had to cut off parts of the top and bottom screen. If you refer to the actual screenshots put up in this guide, you'll see that a good number of shots have been ruined thanks to this cropping.

What really ticks me off about this set is that their special features on the final disc try to justify their reasoning for making the entire series widescreene-ed. What they do is focus solely on how you're getting more footage on the sides than normal. What they fail to mention is how they had to crop the footage on the top and bottom to do so. And to think that FUNimation takes the liberty to refer to this set as ""the way it was meant to be seen""...

For the most part, this doesn't effect your viewing experience, but there are still a handful of instances where the camera view pans up for a character and completely misses the person's head because it was out of the widescreen perspective's reach. It's just really annoying to know that you're missing what's actually meant to be viewed.

As you watch these episodes, you WILL notice that FUNimation has at least brightened up the colors. This isn't that big of a problem with me, but some fans still aren't content with these colors, since they're not necessarily what was originally intended. What I do find wrong with the ""re-mastering"" that FUNimation has done is how some solid lines have actually been broken down, probably because they automatically cleaned off the minor dirt specks on the film and actually thought some of the lines were dirt.

As for the Japanese background music as an option for watching the dub, I found that it actually made the dub sound worse. Sure, the Dragon Ball (as in without the Z) episodes sounded fine, but that was because they were dubbed with the intention of having the JP background music. This dub was done with the intent of having the American background music alongside it, thus having some of the script not match the music altogether. I think this is mostly due to the fact that some background music was actually taken out completely and replaced with utter silence. But at least those songs were kept in the Japanese audio version (as always, the option of the Japanese audio track is available).

The only real purchasing point for me here is that you get so many episodes for such a low price. That and this is the only way to get ALL of the Saiyan Saga episodes, without importing, since FUNimation cancelled their Ultimate Uncut Releases. In conclusion, I highly recommend buying FUNimation's 4:3 releases and only get this (and the next set) because those episodes have never been released Uncut in America before. But if you don't even care about the dub (and have a good amount of money), then I suggest merely importing the Japanese DVDs and playing them on a region-free DVD player.",1174089600,8,3646,4.6434108527131785

I'm a huge DBZ fan, and chose to purchase the set in lieu of all the widescreen controversy.  Like Darth, I'm still hoping that FUNi will release a full screen edition of these boxed sets to appease the mass amounts of their fanbase who are unsatisfied with the widescreen ""upgrade.""  But for now, this set will have to do, and at least FUNi has made some large improvements to the franchise already with regards to the picture quality and pricing.

One other complaint I have with this set that has yet to be discussed, is that the U.S. TV Broadcast version does not have the broadcast opening or closing.  While I appreciate the effort FUNi took in releasing an English dub track with the Japanese audio in addition to the U.S. broadcast track, if you're going to include all U.S. Broadcast music throughout the series, then you should be consistent with the opening and closing as well.  The U.S. DBZ opening is one of the most memorable and nostalgic moments from it's U.S. TV run.",1173657600,,1105,4.607142857142857
2524978,5,B000ENUKY4,"the fact they include 39 episodes of this series in a affordable package makes this worth it alone... the original releases never really came with much extras other than 2 versions of the show to watch, one being the english and the other being the japenese languages... this one containing a 3rd viewing version with the original japanese music and redubbed english tracks...

As for remastering the dvd set, this set sparkles with bright, vivid colors that were once before a little washed out... I think they shown alot of love towards this series by taking the time to clean the animation up and trying to reduce the flawed stock footage... I personally love the widescreen addition because im a widescreen pureist... i hate when movies get chopped on the sides and spread out to cover everything...

This may crop a little of what was once before, but it adds a better thematical viewing ... Giving the show a more epic feel, which it deserves... I personally find the 2nd audio option the best because its more contemporary music to these times and dramatic...

I for the longest time never fully understood the series or what the big deal was partially from never seeing the first episodes that explain everthing, and partially from being niave... But i am hooked now, and excited about the May 07 release of Season 2...

I hope Funimation considers releasing the Orginal ~(DragonBall)~ in Season Boxsets aswell, and then Release (Dragonball GT) by Season box... we will see what happens, but at least Funimation understands now that anime is mainstream enough now to cut the price to more reasonable and affordable sets and giving us full dvds with several episodes, instead of the usual 3 episodes given before...

Thank you Funimation for thinking of the consumer first this time! we will show our appreciation by buying up all the Season sets you bring to us =)",1173657600,2,1872,4.8193146417445485
2524979,4,B000ENUKY4,"Finally, the first season of Dragonball Z is released, and in its uncut form, not the horrible Saban dub.

I know there are issues with the move to widescreen, so I'll address this first. Yes, some of the picture from the top and bottom on the screen is cropped. That being said, it doesn't take away from what you're watching. Sure, there are some moments where it looks odd, but all in all I enjoyed watching this set too much to notice other, more insignificant instances. Even though parts of the picture are cropped, you never really lose sight of what's going on. The purists speak out against widescreen and I understand that. But the finished product is not as bad as some would have you believe.

The sound quality is pretty good, especially if you go with the original Japanese version with their original opening and endings. In terms of English voice acting, it's one of Funimation's better works.

DVD menus are easy to navigate, although there are some issues. There is no chapter select within the episode selection, and marathon mode (leaving out opening and ending credits) is a little useless in my opinion. That sort of thing might be your cup of tea however. The extras are not all that plentiful, but then again you're not picking this up for the extras.

All in all, this is a good set. I was a DBZ fanboy back in the day, and the release of this season has reawakened the fanboy within. Widescreen does crop out some of the picture, but not enough to make a huge difference. Those who already own this season might not want to spend the extra money. But those who haven't had the opportunity to own the first season of one of the best and most influential animes ever, it is well worth it.

Pros

This box set inculdes the first 39 Episodes.(Basicly the ""Vegeta Saga"")All of which have been cleaned up and presented in a 16'x9' widescreen presentation. Also fixed is the audio which not only appears in not just the original japenese and the U.S. tv version but also the made just for this set a 5.1 audio english track with japenese music. The final disc bonus features include Dragon ball Z: rebirth part 1 which basically explains how the clean up was done other than that there is ""A New Look"" the trailer that is show on amazon.com

Cons

The Only con I see with this set is that because of the frame rate being increased to 24 frames per second, the audio tracks for the tv english will lag a little but not by much.

All in all if your a big fan of the series and you don't want to spend an arm and a leg, start your D.B.Z series with this.",1173398400,,1059,4.248756218905473

2524995,1,B000ENUKY4,"FUNimation's latest release acts as a slap in the face to fans of the series. After 6 years of DVD releases, which consisted of 79 discs at approximately $2,000 retail, FUNimation has pulled the rug out from underneath the very fans that helped them establish their position as a respected anime company. Now, fans who had 251 episodes out of 291 will never be able to complete their collections legally.

The release itself consists of 39 episodes which have been cropped, losing 20% of their original vertical resolution. While this is often minor details such as hair and so forth, during high-octane fight scenes entire characters can lose the majority of their bodies and half of their heads. This is most definitely NOT the way the series was intended to be seen.

As DragonBall/Z/GT is being mastered from 16mm film, it is essentially a 4:3 presentation (it is slightly larger, but nowhere near a widescreen aspect ratio). FUNimation, in conjunction with Video Post & Transfer, have destroyed the original framing of the series by carelessly cropping it to widescreen. While people seem to mock those who are angry about this, proclaiming the details lost to be only ""hair and feet,"" in truth the detail gained is usually even less (5% which tends to consist of rocks, clouds, etc.). In addition, the cropping makes the action scenes very claustrophobic.

In addition to the above, FUNimation and VP&T have destroyed a great deal of detail in the digital print by applying Digital Video Noise Reduction (DVNR) by way of an automated process. This results in the series looking like a pastel painting and even causes some lines in the animation to disappear completely in certain scenes (such as Nappa's teeth, Goku's face and more). This completely eliminates the point in doing an HD transfer, as the purpose is to capture more detail not to destroy it. Add to this the obvious changes to contrast and color balance, which cause humorous problems such as Gohan flashing blue when bursting out of Raditz's spacepod, and you have a release that is truly worthy of laughter.

The worst part, however, is FUNimation's advertising techniques and the very documentary on this disc. FUNimation has tried desperately to sell this set on lies and insults, such as trying to insinuate that overscan has anything to do with why the show should be cropped. In truth, my television (which is a Pioneer Elite PRO-910HD widescreen plasma) has 2.5% overscan on all sides, meaning I lose 25% of the vertical picture and gain *nothing* horizontally. My television is also fairly high end, as you can verify by looking online. Also, the fact that FUNimation and VP&T felt the need to fabricate the scenes with grain (the framerates of the 'clean' footage and the grain don't match, see for yourself) serves only to insult our intelligence more.

This release embarasses me and it should embarass FUNimation. I've been a fan of the series for 12 years now. I own all the DragonBoxes from Japan because I wanted the series *truly* remastered and not just automatically filtered. I truly had hope that FUNimation would produce a set that was worthy of those who helped them become a force in the world of anime production, however after 7 years FUNimation still hasn't learned.

This release is insulting to the original animators of DragonBall Z, the fans of DragonBall Z and to FUNimation themselves, who have proven they are capable of much more than this. If you want to be respected as a fan and as a consumer, don't buy this set. Don't send FUNimation the message that we like being lied to and will accept whatever they toss us. Just remember, whatever they may say, numbers don't lie. We're losing a net 15% of DBZ. And seriously, who wants that?",1173312000,51,3740,4.85423197492163

2525002,5,B000ENUKY4,This is a great series. I feel it's the best series since it's the one that got the ball rolling for the rest of the series. Great stuff.,1172188800,,137,3.9285714285714284
2525003,4,B000ENUKY4,"Funimation discontinued the ""Uncut"" releases of Season 1 and 2 to work on these new Season Sets. I have to say that Funimation has finally outdone themselves with a DBZ release. I haven't watched the Dragonball series in a while, but this is, by far, the best US DBZ release ever. The redub of the first series is much better than the original Ocean one where half of it was cut out for syndication time. When they did the reasonably priced season set releases for the original Dragonball a few years back, I was hoping eventually they'd release DBZ this way as well. The original DBZ releases were very mediocre. Their best selling point was the fact that they included the uncut Japanese version which was unavailable in America until then. Ironically, this is also the best priced DBZ release as well. For about the same price as one of the original DVDs which typically had 3-4 episodes we get 39. This is probably helped by the much lower cost of television DVDs nowadays than when they were first around.

VIDEO - Tremendous restore of the picture. I wish they hadn't used the widescreen, but its not the end of the world. I've have never seen these episodes looking better than this. The entire track is almost identical in both English and Japanese (it just uses the Japanese opening and commercial sequences) except for the end title sequence which has two different angles depending on the language. Both angles are the original Japanese end sequence except that in the English tracks it displays Funimation's credits and in the Japanese one the original untranslated Toei credits are shown.

AUDIO - There are three options here. One option is for the 2.0 English ""Broadcast"" track. This is basically the Stereo version of the English tracks on the original ""Uncut"" DVDs. The main audio track is a first for Dragonball Z. It is the English dub with the Japanese music. Previously, FUnimation did not have access to the Japanese soundtracks for the DBZ episodes (they did for DB which is why that dub was all the Japanese music.) This is a nice addition to fans who have been waiting for that. The third option is the original Japanese track. This has been a standard and essential inclusion on most anime DVDs. This is the same Japanese track that was on the uncut DVDs. It would have been nice if they had remixed this in Stereo, as for many old school DBZ fans this will be the track of choice, but I'm not going to make a huge complaint about this. The important thing is that the track is available.

REDUB - If you watched Season 1 and 2 on Cartoon Network back in the day, this is not the same dub. It's a redub using the Season 3 and later actors. The actual script and dub actors performances isn't always the greatest, but it is far superior to the original dub of this season because it is at least uncut. The original dub has several episodes worth of material cut out for lack of syndication time.

It's not perfect, thus not 5 stars, but it is the best we'll for DBZ in America, and it is still excellent.",1172016000,9,3029,4.552293577981652

I am enjoying every minute of it. I agree this is a better release

for the Show, you a have whole series to watch. I don't really care for the U.S. T.V. version with the Music. But I enjoy the English Dub with

the Japanese music and the Japanese language with the Japanese music.

I don't really want to collect all of the sets, just a few. That's just how I am and would like to do things. I am counting down to Frezia, Androids, Cell and Kid BUU. I can't wait to get these. Hope to write more reviews soon,

2525005,4,B000ENUKY4,"If you like DBZ this is the DVD set to buy.  It's far better than all the previous sets and is a nearly perfect release.

High Points:

It's completely unedited.

The video has been cleaned up and the color significantly improved.  Everything looks really good.

The sound has been tweaked and improved and the DVDs include English and Japanese dubs with the ability to play the English dub with the Japanese music if you prefer.

Nifty marathon feature lets you watch an entire disc like one long episode.

It's very reasonably priced, 39 episodes for only $30-40 depending where you get it.

Minor Problems:

The ""Next Time on Dragon Ball Z"" bits were left off.

The English dub with Japanese music setting incorrectly plays the English version of the opening theme (however the original theme plays just fine on the full Japanese track).

The move to wide screen, while adding a little footage on the sides, cuts some stuff off of the top and bottom of image.  I know a lot of people have been throwing a fit about this but unless you're determined to be bothered by it, you'll rarely notice the loss while watching the show.  There's a few really bad frames but as long as you don't pause the DVD and stare at those frames for a while you won't be seeing much of them.  Really, it looks perfectly fine 99% of the time.

Overall, this is the best US DBZ release by far and a must for all fans who are mature enough not to throw a fit because of the widescreen.",1171843200,,1463,4.443609022556391
2525006,3,B000ENUKY4,"I've watched the every episode on TV and have been collecting DBZ videos and DVD's since Funimation started releasing the series. So you might say I've got a good perspective to share with other people interested in buying this series.

PROS

 - Price. Very fair for what you get in this set. I hated paying for the individual discs in the Ultimate Uncut series so creating this compilation was the right thing to do for the price conscience fans...but Funimation should have still finished the Ultimate series so fans could have a completed set.

 - Remastering. The color correction is very good...I loved the rich colors. Bravo Funimation!

 - Dubbing. Very good! I hated when the voice actors changed later in the series. The Funimation actors are much better so I'm very pleased to have the series from the beginning with the same character voices.

 - Packaging. I'm very thankful that Funimation decided to offer the complete saga in one high quality set. The packaging is good, although some people may not like having to remove the front discs to get access to the back discs.

CONS

 - Widescreen Cropping. Everything you've read from the other comments about the poor cropping is true. In some scenes the widescreen crop doesn't really matter but in other scenes it's really obvious...in a bad way. Several times I noticed the characters heads cropped out right at the eyes. Most first time watchers won't notice but those who have seen the series before will notice, especially in the opening title where you can immediately see the character's heads cropped out on top...a sign of things to come.

 - Sound. Sorry but unlike other comments here, I hate the Japanese music with the English dubs. If you were introduced to the series in North America then you will immediately notice something sounds weird when you select the Dolby 5.1 sound option and start playing. My biggest complaint is that the English version with English music only comes in 2.0 stereo...what's up with that? I'd rather watch the series in 2.0 with good music than suffer through that weird 5.1 Japanese music. In my opinion, the Japanese music doesn't even fit the mood of the action on screen...for example, you'll hear silly, light-hearted music while Nappa is beating the poop out of the DBZ heroes...that's not right.

BOTTOMLINE

This set could have been perfect with a little more attention given to the cropping and sound issues. But to be fair, neither of these issues should keep you from collecting this series. After reading this review, you'll at least know better what you're getting.

My hope is that this first attempt was a good learning experience for the Funimation crew and they will get it right with the Season 2 set.",1171756800,5,2726,4.8405172413793105
2525007,5,B000ENUKY4,"I was very happy when it came in the mail, but unfortunately the boxset got really, really badly damaged. The side and almost everywhere on the box looks like somebody hammer the boxset really hard like they were mad, there were these weird brain stains on the box (that i can't even taped over), the interior was bad too. The thing that holds onto the disc were crack!! I was thinking since the box was damaged, maybe I don't need to exchange it,but no the inside were really bad too. So I decided to return it and I just did that today, and hopefully the boxset don't arrive in bad condition. I hope they arrive in very good condition. T-T And I got excited about watching the dvd set today too.

So, I advise you when buying this set, but another item or two with it because they will have those air bubbles protector. If you just buy one item, you will get this cardboard that it is not even going to protect the item inside.",1171670400,3,929,4.278409090909091

Then they stopped releasing them after episode 26 to dump the rest of the episodes in one release of the entire season one!

Which means I bought 1-26 for nothing!  I'm buying this Funimation because I love DBZ, but I don't love YOU.  This, Funimation, is the last dime you are getting out of me EVER.  I've already sent an extremely rude email to Funimation (and I'm not a bit sorry for the rudeness) telling them, I am officially their ex-customer.  Maybe next time, they will consider whether ripping off their customers is the best way to keep customer loyalty.",1171584000,4,720,4.409090909090909
2525009,5,B000ENUKY4,"I got the Season One set last week and I love it! This is how DBZ should've been released years ago. But oh well, better late than never.

On to the review:

I'm amazed at how beautiful this show looks. The person/s behind the restoration process did a tremendous job on revamping the first season. While watching it, I didn't see any grain or dirt. I think I saw some glue or something on one of the frames but I could overlook that since I hardly noticed it.

The colors were very vibrant from such an old show. The restoration was astounding as this show was originally done back in the 80s, yet this set makes it look like brand new.

Including three different audio tracks was good as well. I strongly prefer the English dub over the original Japanese (Sean Schemmel and Chris Sabat rule as Goku and Vegeta). I can't stand the original Japanese as the voices seem a little annoying and the music is corny by today's standards (No offense to anyone who likes the original Japanese, but it's just not my bag). But there's also the option of having the English dub with the Japanese music, kinda like they did with Dragon Ball. That should please some of those out there who don't like the English techno/rock soundtrack. So that's squared away.

Now the big issue at hand: widescreen. Personally, I'm not bothered by it at all. If anything, it makes it more cinematic. Granted, they did crop the picture but hardly anything is missing because of this. By going with widescreen, FUNImation had two choices: either crop it or stretch and distort the picture. They chose the first one.

Now I enjoy this set for a number of other reasons:

1) It's compact (about the size of two DVDs together), which allows for more space on my DVD rack.

2) It's 39 episodes for about the same price as it was for 3 episodes.

3) I can sell back my individual Vegeta Saga DVDs and get some money back for them.

4) It's freakin' Dragon Ball Z!!!!!!

So I personally enjoy this set and recommend to any other DBZ fan out there. Season Two comes out in May, which is an improvement since it took damn near forever to complete one saga with the individual DVDs. So from what I can presume, we'll probably be up to the end of the Cell Games by year's end.

So will I continue to buy these season sets? Oh hell yeah!",1171238400,9,2296,4.401891252955083
2525010,4,B000ENUKY4,"I became a Dragonball fan as a teenager when the show was moved to Cartoon Network.  Before I had been aware of the show's existence but it never had a very good timeslot on the the WB and wasn't something I had enough time for.  Naturally, once I found the time for it I was hooked by the action and artistic style.  I had always had a small interest in anime (mostly the over-the-top violent stuff as a kid because that was just something not present in American cartoons) so DBZ wasn't foreign to me.  Once I had viewed all that was available at the time of the Pioneer Dub, I went to the internet and learned what I could about the show, watched some terrible subbed bootlegs, and anxiously awaited the day the rest of the show would be dubbed.  Of course it, and the rest is history.

As fans, we've seen a lot of versions of DBZ over the years and this is really the one I think most people have been waiting for.  Paying 25 bucks a DVD for 3 episodes was nothing short of a rip-off.  Finally, FUNimation has released an entire season at an affordable price.  And while I've avoided the internet DBZ community for a few years, I am almost positive there are countless numbers of people out there griping about this release.

Back when the series was first dubbed, if it wasn't the voices people were complaining about it was the lack of the original Japanese soundtrack.  DBZ has been so hallowed by the hardcore fans over the years someone new to the series would think it's going to be some sort of a mindblowing experience.  Well, it's not.  Dragonball Z, at it's heart, is a very simple show that utilizes the same tricks and gimmicks over and over.  The characters are flat, the plotlines simple and predictable, and sometimes the pacing is downright horrible (it's almost impossible to watch some of the later portions of the series one episode at a time because so little happens).  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the show for what it is, but let's be serious, there's nothing incredible about this show.  It is what it is.

This first season though is Dragonball Z at it's best.  Yes there are some slow, filler episodes but at least here they feel like they accomplish something (the only truely bad episode is when the characters decide to sit down for an entire episode and wait for Goku, the hero of the series, to arrive).  The fight scenes are some of the best in the series.  The first confrontation between Goku and Vegeta captured on this set remains my favorite fight scene for the whole series.

Dragonball Z has also never looked better.  The picture is so crisp and clear one would think this is a Blu Ray disc or HD DVD.  Bare in mind, I've only viewed this on a plasma set but I assume it looks great on any set.  Hats off to the editors for getting this old show to look this great.  I've read some complaints about the show only being displayed in widescreen but as someone who is watching this on a plasma set I must say I much prefer the series in widescreen.  Nothing of significance has been lost in making the screen fit a 16:9 format and nothing has really been gained either, but I find it more aesthetically pleasing to view a program that takes up most of my screen.

For those who have wanted to see this portion of the series with the original soundtrack rest assured it is here, for the most part.  The opening song is strangely absent and in it's place an instrumental guitar piece that works well.  I'll say this, I've never cared for the Japanese soundtrack.  It's very corny sounding and outdated, I just don't feel a lot of it accurately fits the spirit of the show.  I'm not saying the English dub's techno stuff fit any better, but there were some scenes that were better in the dub.  I absolutely despise the song played during the ending credits on these discs but thankfully FUNimation included a marathon feature that cuts out all of that stuff so the action never stops.  Also, the show can be viewed subbed with the original voice cast.  Honestly, unless Japanese is your native language I don't know why you would want to do that.  The English dub sounds as good as any anime or cartoon one is going to find and Sean Schemmel's Goku is absolutely perfect.  There was a time when the English dub was not so good (like the Frieza saga) but it has really come a long way.

In the end, this is the definitive version of Dragonball Z's Vegeta saga.  The picture quality is fantastic, both language tracks are included, and most of the original soundtrack is present for the purists.  This is also DBZ at it's finest.  There are a lot of lighthearted moments that capture the spirit of the original Dragonball series.  Some of this humor and charm is lost later on in Dragonball Z (though recaptured for the Buu saga when characters like Mr Satan, Trunks, and Goten play a larger part) which is kind of a shame.  Dragonball Z is not a groundbreaking anime, but it is fun, charming, and there are a lot of great action scenes.  This set is how I would introduce someone to the series and I really hope that FUNimation plans on giving us more sets like this so that it is actually affordable to own a high quality version of the entire series.  If you're a DBZ fan on the fence on this one because you already own three different releases of this saga I'd suggest you ditch the old ones and pick this up.  This is something every fan should own.",1171238400,,5391,4.417426545086119
2525011,3,B000ENUKY4,"I've been a DBZ fan for around 8 years, since they were airing the Pioneer dub of the Vegeta Saga on Cartoon Network! Shortly there after, I started my own DBZ fan site which I operated for a few years before I went to college. [...]
I bought this new version of the first 39 episodes of DBZ about a week ago. First off, I would like to compliment FUNimation on a few things. Overall, the dub is great! I personal interviewed Sean Schemmel when I used to run DB3K and think he is a wonderful voice actor. The first couple episodes done by FUNimation (beginning with the Ginyu episodes) were kind of shaky, but the dub improved rather quickly throughout the further episodes. Though I don't find much of a difference, if any, between this new set and the original uncut DVD's. Regardless, the voice actors and script writers have done a superb job on the english dub for this version.

Second, I would like to compliment their job cleaning and correcting the color. I've done several side by side comparisons and I never really realized just how overexposed looking the original DVD's were. This new set has perfected the color to its original glory! It is truly amazing how big of a difference this has made.

Another small side compliment: it is really nice to have the new english dub with the original japanese music. I hope this will help later in the series, especially during Gohan's SSJ 2 transformation in the Cell Saga. FUNimation really ruined that the first go around. Watching the uncut episodes in their entirety has also been a nice bonus! I'm so glad that FUNimation went back and re-did all of Pioneer's terrible work.

Now, to the bad... The wide screen is extremely annoying. As I mentioned earlier, I've done several side by side comparisons and the difference is baffling. FUNimation has cropped an enormous amount from the top and bottom. I don't care about the miniscule 3% gained on each side. I can tell in every single scene that a huge amount has been taken off the top and bottom. Hopefully with fan complaints, a newer version will eventually be re-released with a full screen option. This is my biggest complaint with these new DVD's. It seriously almost brings me to tears. However, this will be beneficial when re-relasing the movies, because like all movies, they were originall wide screen. As far as the episodes go, it really really bugs me looking at how much has been cropped off.

My second complaint is the advertised HD 1080P. I have searched through the settings of the DVD and find nothing about 1080P or even 1080i. These DVD's really aren't any higher resolution than the normal DVD's. I've even decrypted the files on to my computer to analyze them. They are simply NOT HD. The resolution is normal 720x480, which is what every DVD is. This is blatent false advertising by FUNimation and is very misleading. I was wondering how they could fit so many HD episodes on one DVD, which should normally require a HD-DVD or Blu-Ray disc... apparently I was right. It can't fit on a normal DVD, and thus, these DVD's are NOT HD! This was on of my biggest selling points in purchasing this set, but in this regard has left me very disapointed.

Whether this review helps in your decision to buy this set is up to you. I've given a very fair and unbiased review, inluding the positives and negatives of these discs. I do hope the FUNimation continues in their quest to perfect their rendition of Dragon Ball Z. The versions they release are progressively getting better. They just need to listen to the fans and eventually they will get it right.",1171152000,8,3581,4.633070866141733
2525022,4,B000ENUKY4,"I feel that Funi did a crap job with this. Yes you get a lot of episodes for your money, and maybe better picture quality, but come on!! If it was so expensive to do this, how come there are so many defects?? If they had the means to re-master it all, how come they didn't think of giving you an option of fullscreen or wide?? I think if they gave you the option, this set would be perfect and satisfy every DBZ fan ever.

Please feel free to yell at me or agree...",1170979200,5,465,3.9468085106382977
2525023,5,B000ENUKY4,no more grainy pictures/excellent overall improvement/and only 29 bucks for the whole 39 episodes im not gonna complain.,1170892800,4,120,5.722222222222222
2525024,4,B000ENUKY4,"I recently purchased and watched this set, and thus feel like typing up this review. I will try to remain relatively objective throughout the review, but if you feel as though I am being to subjective, I urge you to not continue (wherever you feel as though I may be biased).

First, let me say that I rather like this release. I've never seen all the episodes of the Vegeta saga before (I did see a good number of episodes on CN though, of the Ultimate Uncut Edition), so this is a pretty new experience for me. I watched this one my 32"" Panasonic TC-32LX60 LCD HDTV, though I watched it in 480i playing on my Panasonic DVDS52S DVD Player, in proper 16x9 Widescreen, so as the black bars would not appear. I liked the visuals and the audio. I rather prefer the English Dub cast over the Japanese Dub cast, and the English Dub seems even better with the Japanese music. Once again, let me say that I am rather pleased with this set.

Now, there are some flaws with the set. Many of you may have heard this before, so skipping over it might save you some time. Seeing as Dragonball Z was originally broadcast as 4x3 show, with no 16x9 version ever available before, FUNimation had either 2 options: to either stretch the picture or crop it. They went with the latter. Do not be deceived, you are losing picture from the top and bottom. About 20% of each initial frame is lost You do get some added to the sides of each frame, but it is rather minimal in comparison. A stark 3-4% is the picture that appears on the sides, and it is rather unnecessary. Overall, you are losing more picture than you gain. There are also a number of shots where you may notice some dirt and glue running over. If you intended to see the show as it was ORIGINALLY intended to be seen, you will not.

Now after that, do I consider this release bad? No, I do not. I admit, it could have been better. A better set would have been the footage FUNimation cropped dubbed into English, along with the other options of the Japanese Dub with Japanese music, and English Dub with previously used English music presented in a 4x3 format. The ideal set would have been the Dragonbox masters, with the same audio and langauage options ins this set, with the OPTION of Widescreen (for those that would have wanted to see it as such), all at the price this set is being sold for. But we must make due with what we have. And what we have is, in my opinion, a good release.

Though not much of an actual ""remastering"" process has been done with this set, FUNimation did spruce it up a bit from their previous releases (keep in mind, everything in this paragraph is my opinion, your opinion may very well differ). FUNimation has changed the colors up a bit, making it a lot better. The audio is absolutely wonderful, sounds very nice, and is by far the best I've heard in any Dragonball related release (note that I only saw the English Dub with Japanese music). Overall, I would rate it as FUNimation's best release of these episodes though. When comparing to the episodes I have seen the Ultimate Uncut Edition of the Vegeta saga episodes that aired on CN about 1-2 years earlier, I prefer this by a large margin.

Now this set isn't for everybody. If you insist on watching it as it was ORIGINALLY inteded to be seen, then you may not want to purchase it. I do urge everyone that is reading this to at least check it out, but hey, if you feel you do not wish, that is your choice, and I hope no one forces you to watch it against your will. For those that wish to see these episodes in its English Dub format with the Japanese music, this may be a nice little option, and I find it rather enjoyable.

Now if FUNimation decided to reuse the footage that's present in this iteration, but maintain it in its 4x3 format and re-released it, would I purchase it? No, I would not. If FUNimation licensed the Dragonbox masters and released those, would I purchase it? Most likely, assuming the price isn't too high. Will I continue to purchase these 16x9 season sets if FUNimation keeps pumping them out? Yes, I will support this until the end, and I do hope FUNimation releases the series in its entirety in this format, since they've already started it.

Well, thanks for reading my review (whoever's left). I hope that I've helped in your ultimate decision on the importance of purchasing this set yourself.",1170892800,24,4365,4.414906832298136
2525025,4,B000ENUKY4,"Hopefully, this will help others like myself make a choice. I have been on too many forums in the last few days reading lots of negativity from super-picky ultrahardcore fans. I have even read admissions that many of those fans have purposely tried to very negatively skew these reviews. Shame on you guys. That said, here is my review of the set, which I do own, and have viewed: It's not bad!

I have been a Dragonball Z fan dating all the way back to it's first running in American syndication. I was revolted, like many others, at the edits and butchering of the series by Saban and Pioneer for the American TV market.

You won't run into that garbage here. It's all here, uncut (yes blood, beer, cigarettes, and Roshi trying to grab a handful of Bulma!) The one thing missing is the ""Next time on DBZ"" preview of the next show, but you're watching the next show right after it on a DVD, so who cares? Speaking of that, these DVD's have an excellent feature where you can watch a whole disc straight through without seeing the opening or ending themes between shows. makes it like each disc is an extended movie, and keeps you in the action. It's all been re-voiced so as you collect the Dragonball Z DVD Season sets, the voices will be consistent. The ability to hear the english dialogue over the Japanese BGM is a great pleasure. They did goof and make some instrumental music the default opening theme, hopefully this will be corrected in future sets, and we'll hear ""Head Cha La"" as the default. This is a minor issue, no biggie.

Now to address the most controversial portion of the set: the widescreen cropping. I'm a realist. I'm going to admit to you, adding a little on the side does pretty much next to nothing. You are *not* seeing some amazing lost detail you have always missed. It's usually just an extension of the horizon, foliage, etc. Just extra backgound. It absolutely *IS* cropped on top and bottom. However, speaking to you as a realist that is a fan of Dragonball Z, it just isn't that big of a deal. I rarely encountered any scene that I thought was negatively impacted by the cropping. It just didn't bother me as I was afraid it might. I spent a *whole day* reading forum posts, reviews, etc, afraid to even open the set, thinking I might just return it because honestly, FUNimation is being dishonest with how they are marketing it. It is HARD to even tell it's a widescreen set if you pick up the package in a store. The screencaps on the box back are 4:3, the only mention of widescreen is VERY tiny on the lower back of the package. They DON'T seem to want you to know that the set has been cropped down. The whole technical short in the special features tries to convince you that overscan is important, it isn't. You are getting a cropped product, and the tiny bit of new view on the sides is unimportant and uninteresting.

All that being said, I liked it just fine. I did not miss what was cropped. Once I get a widescreen TV (soon) I expect I am going to appreciate this set even more, since it will fill the whole screen. It is anamorphic, for those of you that care. The picture is clear, crisp, and very colorful. It's the clearest and most vivid I have ever seen the show. The voice acting is pretty good. For the price espescially, you cannot beat this set. if you have always wanted compact, full season sets of DBZ, this is what you have been waiting for. It's even formatted for the future. Go ahead and go for it, this coming from a VERY picky DVD collector. It was so nice to return to a series I had not watched in a few years, and see it even more vibrant and alive than when I first viewed it.",1170892800,9,3646,4.373156342182891
2525026,5,B000ENUKY4,"I have been waiting for FUNimation to release DVD sets of DBZ for years, and finally my prayers have been answered.  But WOW, this set was WAY more then I was hoping for.  English voice track with the orignal Japanese music (though I have to switch the audio to hear ""CHA-LA-HEAD CHA-LA"" as the opener in that mode.  It also contains for those who are more used to and prefer the FUNimation music (which for once I am not against on an anime as it made it edgey, actiony, and darker) there is an audio option for that as well to get the music from the original US Uncut Airings on Cartoon Network of these episodes.  FUNimation said they had newly done voice tracks, but it sounds no different by word, acting, or such then it did in the previous uncut version, I think that may have not been true, unless it meant those tracks as new as those uncut episodes were not too old either, infact they were fairly new.  Plus of all the DBZ DVDS, I have never seen such picture in high quality, I am really impressed.  Yes it's widescreen, So what? it's not made that way from the videos, it's made that way from the original film footage that had more picture in it that never got onto the FullScreen version that originally aired.  Yes we lose some parts from top to bottom, but they mater very little, not at all important as I read someone say, it's no different then the footage we get at the sides pretty much.  Infact, while we do not get all the original footage of the FullScreen, we get some to the left and right as well that were in the original film as well, .  besides, not all Widescreen DVD releases capture all the footage that was originally in theaters either. As you gain some additional footage from the sides as well that was in the original film, I'm open to trying it to experence a little more as well, even if it's not much.

And if you are going to whine at me for liking it then do me a favor and go jump off a bridge, seriously, I rated it 5 stars because of most of the stuff, I don't mind the cropping that much, yes, it too annoys me at times in some areas but I don't care, it's NOT THAT BAD!  I did checking myself, on such, I do agree it's not perfect but it's better then nothing and it's better then a edited version that does not keep the original storyline.  If you hate it so much, buy an import set in fullscreen or download episodes, extract the sound from this set, and use a movie maker program to merge them together.  I saw other things in the fullscreen version we could have gotten that were just as bad or annoying, so we get one or the other with one flaw or the other, to me both are equally annoying.  So shut up.  I mean, I rather just get this show uncut and enjoy it, same would go if a fullscreen version of a movie was all that was made on DVD, and that has been the case many times, but if it's all I can get of an uncut release as long as the picture quality is good and enough of the imaging shows then that is good enough for me.  Don't try and change my opinion, because you won't.  And I just said the downsides as well.  If you don't want it in this format, fine, I won't argue with you, but leave me out of it, I DID compare, yes it's not perfect and it's annoying to long time fans of the show in Japanese, as I did say, it's annoying to me at times as well.  But here is another reason I am okay with this.

Getting sets with 39 episodes at 30 bucks a pieces then spending 15 dollars on a single dvd at a time that only has about 3 or 4 episodes each that will take up about 3 shelves of space, this ways it's less expencive to see the entire show.  and saves you room for more shows on DVD for your shelves.

And one thing that annoyed me about the previous fullscreen releases, the picture quality was very blocky, especially in high motion and flashing parts of the show, and to me that is was just as annoying as this widescreen thing, I dispise bad picture quality, so for me, it's an upside on this as this set does not have that.  I bought the previous DVDs as well and compared, it's a win-win, lose-lose situation.  This is no better or worse.  I will admit, they could have made it a little LESS wide and still do wide screen to show more of the footage, so they did not transfer it perfectly, I know because my computer is widescreen and I still see blackbars.  So yes, they did not do it perfectly either for the footage, but I still stand by what I said, if you don;t want to buy it, fine, but I enjoyed it and that's all I care about, I just wanted it uncut and true to the story, that's why I called this completely true, because's it's not the previous edited for TV versions and it stays more true to the characters as well, and to me, that's what is really important, if it had BOTH bad quality like the last DVDs and widescreen, then I probably would not buy this, but it only has ONE. and as I said, I like picture quality more, it's indifferent enough for me to rate it 5 stars.  Just respect that.",1170892800,4,4979,4.122026887280248
2525027,5,B000ENUKY4,"First, this is one of the best sets that FUNimation has released. Second, and most prominent in every review I've read, the screen cropping. There is some missing, obviously, from the picture, but this does not cause a big problem. The reviews are biased and people spend way too much time watching a perfectly good show frame by frame to pick out flaws in 20 year old film. I think this is a good set, especially for the money. If you want a good story, amazingly revised animation and color from an old show, and pure all out good fun, buy this set, but please, please don't complain because you cannot see the left side of Yajirobe's cheek or Gohan's dragonball on his hat. That is too picky, especially after all the work that went into the revision of this wonderful and miraculous show.",1170892800,5,792,4.506944444444445
2525028,5,B000ENUKY4,"This box set of Dragon Ball Z contains the entire Vegeta Saga.  The Vegeta Saga makes up the first 39 episodes of Dragon Ball Z.  The story of Goku and his friends from the classic show Dragon Ball continues with Goku finding out he comes from an alien race of fighters known as saiyans.  Now his past has caught up with him and he and his friends must defeat these powerful foes or the people of Earth will face certain doom.  This box is crucial for any collector of Dragon Ball Z as it introduces Vegeta, one of the most popular characters in Dragon Ball Z history.

Specifically, the set has 6 discs and very little extra features, but any real fan of Dragon Ball Z will not buy this for extras.  They will buy this for the excellent story, the great dialogue, the economic value, and of course the action.  The way the discs are packaged is annoying, but you get used to it.  I have heard much hype about how this set will ruin Dragon Ball Z because it is in Widescreen, but to be honest this is just not the case.  Now I consider myself a true fan of Dragon Ball Z, and I am sad that you do lose some of the picture due to this, but most real fans will easily overlook the loss.  I thought the Widescreen would cut much more picture than it actually did. By the second episode, I actually got used to the new look of the screen.

The sound and picture are great, and you can hear the English dialogue with either Japanese or American music behind it, or you can hear the original Japanese version of the show.  I enjoy listening in English, but with the Japanese subtitles on to spot where the dialogues differ, I find this to be very interesting. The English music for this set isn't as good as in others such as the Buu and Cell DVDs, but I still think it is better than the Japanese music, though I know my opinion on this matter is probably with the minority.

One thing this set adds that I wish previous ones would have is the Marathon Mode.  You can watch every episode on one disc one after another and see them as if they were one gigantic episode.  You skip the opening and ending themes and the ""Last time on Dragon Ball Z..."" part. Of course, you can still watch these parts for every episode if you want. Another great thing about this set is the value.  You get at least seven episodes on each DVD but the last, and to get the first 39 episodes of Dragon Ball Z for around $30.00, a price you could easily pay for 3 episodes(and I have), is just incredible.

The key to buying this set is the show itself.  Many of the other versions of this saga cut so much footage that they pack the entire saga down to only 25 episodes. This is a tragedy which has finally been fixed. A specific example is the episode called, ""The Strangest Robot"".  This episode was never in the old translation, well most of it.  This Saga has many wonderful and tragic moments including the first death of Goku, the first appearance of King Kai(and Vegeta as mentioned above), the awesome battle of Goku versus Vegeta, Gohan's training with Piccolo, and of course Piccolo's sacrifice.

As mentioned above, another good thing about this set is the improved voices.  When this show originally aired, I noticed the voices changed between the Namek and Freiza Sagas, but they have finally re-dubbed the first two sagas.  Of course this is also the set's only down side to me.  I already own many DBZ sets including the Cell Games, Majin Buu, and Fusion Sagas.  If they re-release them with new dialogue, better sound, better picture, or for a better value or something I will feel like a fool and a bit annoyed.  Personally, I hope they re-release upto and including the Frieza Saga, but my frustration only proves I am a true fan.

This set is a great value, contains 39 episodes of what I consider to be the greatest action cartoon and anime of all time, and is for any true fan of Dragon Ball Z, or even someone who enjoys anime.",1170806400,7,3922,4.336986301369863
2525029,4,B000ENUKY4,"ok, here is what I believe of this box set. I have been buying the dbz box sets since 2001. This was such a good buy. I cant believe the amount of people complaining about the widescreen image. I just started watching the episodes last night, and I was astounished with the video and sound quality of this box set. I got the set for 25 dollars, and it was such a fantastic deal. The special features lack a lot, but i don't really care for that kind of stuff anyway. Basically, the wide screen format takes away extra clouds and the top of people's hair which is fine considering you get to see more of the horizontal picture. To sum up my review, I would say this

If you are extremely picky with video, then this set is not for you.

If you are looking to get DBZ this is a perfect box set.",1170806400,5,792,4.103225806451613
2525030,5,B000ENUKY4,"ok, its awesome that 40 eps. are this cheap, first and foremost. This is the DBZ they should have released in the first place.

However, you don't really lose much image on widescreen. Here is an example or an actual DBZ production cell, and the way it is cropped for full 4:3, 16:9, as well as 4:3 compensating for the overscan your SDTV would cut off: [...] thats straight from funimation.

IMO, you get a better picture with the 16:9 cropping, a must-buy if you have a big WS set.

uncut, original music, cheap, get it!",1170806400,,522,4.416666666666667
2525031,4,B000ENUKY4,"First and foremost: if you don't already own ""Dragon Ball Z"" in some form or fashion myself and/or passed on the now-discontinued ""Ultimate Uncut"" DVDs (I fall into both of these categories), then this repackaging of the series (in this volume, $35 for 39 episodes) is a godsend, especially considering how incredibly long the show is. Personally, I'd rather FUNimation hurry up and put out a respectable release of the original ""Dragon Ball"" on DVD, but that's for another day.

Yes, I know that the top and bottom of the picture have been lopped off, no matter how desperately FUNimation tries to spin you otherwise. For someone who is a staunch advocate of preserving the original aspect ratio of any show or film--4:3, 16:9 or otherwise--this steams my broccoli indeed, and I'm ashamed that ""the house that Goku built"" insisted on taking the cheap route of cropping the image.

Unfortunately, it doesn't seem that any amount of petitioning will convince them otherwise. But at the end of the day, I can think of very few people who would shell out a whopping $20-$25 on a 3-episode DVD for a show that is nearly 300 episodes in length. Taking the MSRP of each ""Ultimate Uncut"" DVD into account, buying this 39-episode box set saves approximately $290 from what it would cost to buy this number of episodes in 3-episode volumes. Comparatively, losing part of the picture seems like a small price to pay for this convenience.

As for the episodes themselves? Well, this set spans the entire ""Vegeta"" saga. Goku's all grown up and has a little son named Gohan, but then a strange guy named Raditz shows up, claiming to be Goku's brother and admonishing him for failing to destroy humanity. By teaming up with his nemesis, the demon Piccolo, Goku is able to kill Raditz--but at the cost of his own life. Raditz sends for his comrades Nappa and Vegeta, who will arrive at Earth in a year's time. In the afterlife, Goku makes a journey to train with the eccentric but wise god Kaiou (as Goku's pals search for the Dragon Balls to revive him), while Piccolo takes it upon himself to foster Gohan's emerging power.

This is my first time being exposed to the original Japanese version after growing up with the atrocious editing job given to this show in its first American broadcast, and as such, I have little interest in the English track (and zero in the version which edits out the original music for louder synthesized crap). For the money, though, it's an entertaining way to kill time and experience, for better or worse, a show which helped shape the face of Japanese animation in America.",1170720000,7,2594,4.732300884955753
2525042,1,B000ENUKY4,"Please look at the other detailed reviews on the cropping issue. The set has oversaturated colors, various spots of damage in the film, and the fact that it's been cropped to widescreen, which causes massive picture loss.

Bad things about this release:

2. Video is horribly cropped.  It was a TV show, like any TV show you would have seen on the tube here in america.  It was intended to be seen in the 4:3 aspect ratio.  Not 16:9... not the ""Vista Size"" that some OVA's produced during that time used.  This is NOT how the show was supposed to be presented.

3. Noise reduction/Edge Enhancement.. blurs every bit of texture out of the backgrounds and characters.  Terrible.

2525044,3,B000ENUKY4,"""Dragon Ball Z"" is the most controversial anime ever made. Not for reasons because of questionable content in the vein of ""Evangelion,"" ""Cowboy Bebop,"" and ""Koi Kaze"" (though the show is very violent), but just in various different arguments. Some people feel that ""Dragon Ball Z"" represents the best anime has to offer, while other people believe that ""Dragon Ball Z"" represents the worst anime has to offer. Add into the fact that ""Dragon Ball Z"" has had one of the most questionable dubs of all time, and (along with ""Sailor Moon"") helped make anime popular in the USA (before ""Pokemon"" and ""Yu-Gi-Oh!"" painted anime as thirty minute toy commercials). With a reputation like that, ""Dragon Ball Z"" is certainly one of the most important animes ever made, but the show has been a hassle to buy if you were a fan of the show. Released in overpriced DVD's that retailed for $25 each and contained three episodes a piece, one had to buy at least SEVENTY DVD's before they could get all of ""Dragon Ball Z"" on DVD!

Add in the fact that the episodes were released out of order, and you'll see that buying ""Dragon Ball Z"" on DVD has certainly been one frustrating experience for many people (myself included). Now FUNimation is re-releasing ""Dragon Ball Z"" one more time in season box sets. These sets are supposed to be the ultimate release of the show, and the release hardcore fans have been waiting for. In some ways they are correct in this statement, and in some ways they are dead wrong. Like everything ""Dragon Ball Z"" related, the release of ""Dragon Ball Z: Season One"" is such a mixed blessing/curse that there is no way to be straightforward about the release. These DVD's are supposed to represent ""Dragon Ball Z"" as restored from a master print, with three sound options (Japanese mono, English surround, and English with original Japanese score), and remastered in high definition widescreen.

I'll talk about the widescreen remastering first since this aspect of the DVD is the most controversial (and with good reason). In case you didn't know, ""Dragon Ball Z"" was first aired in 1984. The show was animated in full screen, as widescreen TV shows didn't really exist back then. To achieve the widescreen scope this DVD presents, the image has been cropped at the top and the bottom, therefore losing about 20% of the image. This has caused the biggest problem with the release as a good portion of the show either looks cropped, poorly photographed, and sometimes silly and/or odd. The show almost never obtains the ""cinematic look"" FUNimation claims it's supposed to look with the new widescreen transfer, and even the most casual fan will find several shots in the show that look at the very least strange. Granted, it's not like you always feel like your missing something, but enough of the image is lost where you defiantly notice something is off.

The sound is fine. If you're watching the show in English FUNimation has given the show a brand new 5.1 surround sound mix, which sounds excellent on a surround sound system. If you're like me though, and prefer to watch the show in it's original Japanese language track, you'll find the same mono track that was presented on all the other single disk releases of the show. With (what surely sounds like) a fatal flaw when it comes to the viewing of the show, many of you may be wondering why you'd want to bother with the show at all. Well, two things: Picture and price. Yes, the display of the show may be the biggest problem for this show, but the restoration is also one of the brightest things about the DVD. While not perfect, ""Dragon Ball Z"" has never looked this good before on DVD. The colors are mostly perfect, and the tone is very consistent, with only some grain to be found in certain spots. Regardless what you think of the widescreen presentation, the look of the picture is excellent.

Then there's the fact that this DVD set retails for $50 and contains the first 39 episodes. I remember spending $20 on a ""Dragon Ball Z"" DVD with three episodes on it. If you bought the single disk releases on sale for $16 each (and this is being generous, as most single disk ""Dragon Ball Z"" DVD's will cost you $20 easily), then you'd spend around $250 by the time you got up to episode 39. Considering you can get ""Dragon Ball Z: Season One"" on sale for $30-$35 at most places, this is the cheapest ""Dragon Ball Z"" has ever been on DVD. At this rate, $250 will get you the whole show. All 291 episodes for what you would originally pay for the privilege to own 39 episodes. Despite the issues with the widescreen, it's hard to argue when the savings are that huge. Whether or not the widescreen issue is enough to scare you away from this DVD is entirely up to you.

Re-watching the show again after I hadn't seen it for several years has made me see it in an entirely different light. It no longer seems to be the greatest action show I remember it to be. Some of the fights are rather silly looking, there are stretches of time that contain way too much filler, and several episodes early on in the show seem to wasting time while they are waiting for the story to come around. That said, when the show is good it's very good. Character development in these early episodes is excellent, there are many heartbreaking moments, and to actually go back to when Goku wasn't a Super Saiyan is a revelation as it shows me that it was more interesting to see these characters grow stronger then it was to watch them...well, BE stronger! It's not a perfect show, but a good portion of the episodes on this set do hold up quite well, and there's a reason we'll still be watching ""Dragon Ball Z"" several years from now. Maybe in ten years the show will be revisited in a much better HD-DVD or Blu-Ray set. For now though,  I think I can live with these sets.  On that note though, why is Vegeta on the cover for Season One while Goku gets banished to being on the cover of Season Two?",1170374400,112,5948,4.548085901027077
2525045,1,B000ENUKY4,"Plenty of the reviewers here don't know a thing about film or the telecine process, so let me fill everyone here on a few key points:

1) Pretty much every animated TV series made before the digital age was shot on 1.48:1 silent 16 mm film, which is usually made less wide by the inclusion of a magnetic audio strip that takes up the right side of the film and makes the ratio 1.33:1, the same as a 4:3 ""fullscreen"" TV set. Dragonball Z was no exception, and the original film masters have a natural ratio of 1.48:1.

2) Animators who worked in TV knew this would be the case, and framed everything they wanted to keep in the horizontal center of the frame. The extra 10% or so of the 1.48:1 frame was considered ""dead space"", and would be lost when the show was converted to D2 master tapes for TV broadcast framed at 1.33:1.

3) Every telecine ever made loses the edge of the frame, since that's where the camera arpeture (the rounded edge of the inside of the camera's image) and splice marks would otherwise be more visible. If you're seeing rounded edges on the outside of the frame, you're seeing more of them film than any film maker wanted you to see.

4) 1.48:1 isn't as wide as 1.78:1, which is the same as 16:9 and is the current HD standard, so FUNimation had to cut 20% of the top and bottom of the original film frame to make the 1.48:1 film master 1.78:1 on DVD. They did restore the 10% of the image on the sides of the film that the animators consider dead space, but at twice the cost of image the animators were expecting the audience to see.

In short, FUNimation's new Season Box Sets are cropped by 20%, and the remastering segment is nothing short of a lie. Anyone with one of the Ultimate Uncut Edition DVD's could compare any scene with the Season One box set and see footage missing on the top and bottom of the frame.

Don't support this butchering. Write to FUNimation and tell them you'll buy Dragonball Z when you can get all of it in the original and intended 4:3 aspect ratio.",1170288000,54,2008,4.327127659574468
2525046,5,B000ENUKY4,"I used to hate funimation for fouling up a great show as Dragon Ball and it many incarnations are, but I think they are beginning to make up for it. I paid for these same episodes eight years ago in a box set for 150 bucks, and these were edited and on tape. And they were missing a few episodes. So to buy the same episodes (my personal favorite part of dragon ball as a whole) for 30 bucks, uncut, with the option of japanese/subtitles, is freaking unbelieveable, and to tell a fan of the series up to ten years ago that you could get them the same episodes in crystal clear widescreen format dvd for a quarter of the price of less episodes on VHS, they'd soil themselves to some degree. I already have the set, bought it and so on, and for those worried about the widescreen thing, the episodes look good, and for people with widescreen TVs, prepare to be a-freakin-mazed.

2525049,1,B000ENUKY4,Dispite what other some people might say Dragonball Z was NEVER meant to be seen in widescreen.  I've seen enough screencaps from this release to see what a terrible thing they've done to an awesome show.  Way too much important stuff has been lost on the top and bottom of the screens and a whole  lot of nothing was added to the sides of the screens.  Most definitly not recommended at all.

2525050,1,B000ENUKY4,"This set was perfect - price, episode count, uncut, remastered, nice packaging...

But it was ruined by the decision to cut the top and bottom of the frame off to make it widescreen.

Funimation has put out all sorts of propaganda saying that nothing important would be cut and that we'd get a bunch of new footage on the sides, but in reality widescreen is not what DBZ was made for and it shows.

Characters whose heads are anywhere near the top or bottom of the frame now have half of their heads missing in many cases. In one case a close-up shot of a character's face shows only the top of the mouth to the bottom of the eyes... one pupil is partially visible. In another case a character is just eyebrows and a scalp at the bottom of the screen. In the majority of cases the much-vaunted added footage is merely more blank floor or wall in the background, or perhaps a character's elbow.

In my opinion, this change has made the set unwatchable and I'm very disappointed. I would have bought the entire Dragon Ball franchise in sets like this had the original aspect ratio been retained, but if the series is released like this I won't be buying any of it.",1169683200,34,1162,4.390697674418605

All there cutting out is a small bit of hair or buildings at the top and dirt on the bottom.

2525052,3,B000ENUKY4,"Like someone here has suggested, this being a widescreen release means that portions of the pictures (notably, the top and bottom of the frame) are cut off.

I have studied film, and while a full screen aspect ratio usually means, for modern day movies, that the Wide image has been cropped to the 1.33:1 frame, such is not the case for Dragon Ball Z.

Dragon Ball Z was intended and created for television - the original aspect ratio is 1.33:1. To go from full screen to wide, means that you must loose some of the top and bottom image - meaning, you're actually getting less of the image in this transfer.

It should be noted though, that because it is mastered in WS, when viewing on a WS television, though parts of the picture are missing, the image will not be distorted (stretched) to fit the screen. Had they left it in full screen, that would have been the case if you were watching it on a WS television using the whole screen.

Personally, I would have preferred them leaving the whole image intact, and simply formatting my tv to remove the distortions, knowing that I could have always just watched it on a full screen tv to see the whole image.",1169251200,12,1158,4.44811320754717

I want everyone to know that I own this set and I have watched it for myself and let me tell you its completely awesome!
The screen quality is beyond perfect, and the sound is great. Some people have been saying that this set is crap, but most of those people have never watched it for themselves. Funimation did a great job remastering this set, and by the way the widescreen isn't bad at all. In fact, when you watch it in widescreen, it's a lot more theatrical. And the added picture on the sides is not just pointless crap, the stuff on the side makes the picture look more complete. All you lose on the top and bottom of the screen is pointless stuff (example: top of hair, pointless background imagery, and the bottom of someone's face, which by the way the face is not to anyone important,and you only lose that for a second) The widescreen does not cause you to lose anything important. To sum it all up: The set is amazing and well worth the money. So I would say that if you're a fan of DBZ, you should definitely buy this set!",1167955200,4,1042,4.267676767676767
2525057,2,B000ENUKY4,"This version of DBZ season one has been re-mastered and has the unprecedented option of listening to the Japanese music with the English voice cast. However I would recommend NOT purchasing this title. It is in a wide-screen version which cuts off the top and bottom of the original picture, and adds in incidental footage on the sides. I suggest waiting for a proper full-screen release.",1167523200,18,388,4.893939393939394
2525058,3,B000ENUKY4,"I am a great lover of dragon ball, z, and gt. But they are putting this box set out in widescreen. Which is ruining the show. I've seen screen shots of the way its suppose to be and the new widescreen screen shot. You are losing alot of the picture from the top and bottom. Roughly about 20%. Its suppose to be seen in 4:3 ratio. I would buy it if it was showed in the original way, the way it is suppose to be.",1166486400,15,411,3.847058823529412
2525059,5,B000ENUKY4,"Starting Feb. 2006, all 291 episodes of The Dragon Ball Z series was digitally transferred from the original Japanese film frame by frame at 1080p. FUNimation worked with Dallas-based Video Post & Transfer (VPT), a

restoration. The Dragon Ball Z series was digitally transferred from the original Japanese film frame by frame at 1080p. During the process, VPT utilized state-of-the-art digital noise reduction units to remove film grain and thousands of instances of dirt, scratches and debris.
