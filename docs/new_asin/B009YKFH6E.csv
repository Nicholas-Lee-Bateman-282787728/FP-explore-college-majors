5372216,4,B009YKFH6E,I liked the actors and the plot.  A rich man finds the true meaning of life through losing his money and finding himself.,1358553600,4,121,4.260869565217392

5372224,4,B009YKFH6E,"I thought the show was very predictable, but it works and that is why the theme is used again and again in movies.  I only gave the movie 4 stars instead of 5 because as both of these ""families"" were Catholic, I didn't like the sex before marriage in the film.  Am I nieve enough to think that Catholics don't have sex before marriage...no I am not, but a standard has to be set and if everyone says it is okay instead of a sin, then everyone keeps sinning.  So, it would have gotten 5 stars if they hadn't messed that message up.",1417305600,,530,4.12621359223301

5372241,5,B009YKFH6E,Well I have to disagree with many reviews about poor acting and bad storyline.  The actor was very good looking and did the role justice.  He was credible the whole way.  The lead actress never overreacted and the storyline progressed well.  The events in NY were realistic and could have happened and I do not think it was too bland at all.  It was a pleasant watchable movie and it warmed my heart.,1415491200,,400,4.424657534246576

5372244,1,B009YKFH6E,"This was a great idea for a movie, but they totally messed it up along the way!  The billionaire man, who takes a break from his wealth & fame for a month in response to his dying father's request, did NOT actually learn the lesson is father was hoping he'd learn.  But they move forward with the movie as if he experiences some fantastic epiphany!  One bit that absolutely ruined this movie for me (spoiler warning) was when the ""sweet girl"" he is falling in love with tells off her boss, using the ""F"" word!  Not so sweet after all, but it seems to endear him to her!  It went downhill from there!  Very ridiculous events that would never, could never happen!  That's an hour and half I will never get back again!  Should have spent that time washing my cat!",1415145600,,760,4.340425531914893

The way he originally met the girl was kind of stupid- I couldn't sleep so I thought I would go out to the living room and wake up a total stranger sleeping on the couch to talk.  Really?  Having him eat voraciously ONCE would have been enough.  And what happened to his promise to his dad of going 30 days [SPOILER ALERT!] when he ends up revealing himself to save his company?  He ended up sacrificing NOTHING for trying to keep the promise, which he broke with impunity.  And why exactly was he in such a hurry go back to California?",1413936000,2,711,4.268656716417911

also, pretty unrealistic that a widow would partner with a complete stranger/chauffeur driver and start a business with him.

5372338,5,B009YKFH6E,"Our hero, a billionaire, when his father is dieing, promises him that he will spend one month, 30 days, far away, with practically nothing, and with nobody knowing who he is. Along the way, he learns a lot about himself.

When he is treated badly by one employer, he learns to be generous with his employees back home, secretly.

When strangers are compassionate to him, he learns compassion.

When he treats a woman as his equal, he learns that it is possible to never treat women as objects again.

The production quality appears to have been a made for TV movie - like Lifetime or Hallmark type movies.  If you expect that kind of production to be equal to a romantic screen movie, well then you might not like it as much.  However, within in the genre of Hallmark/Lifetime, I really liked the story, I think the characters were well done, and I could see it having a pretty loyal/cult following.  If, however, you are romantic cynic, then ... you probably won't like it.  Hope that helps you determine whether you want to spend the time.",1396828800,,673,4.566666666666666

5372533,4,B009YKFH6E,"A sweet movie. Read the one long sentence Product Description, and then realized its a simple charming movie.  Not an epic adventure. And enjoy watching an attractive leading man.",1390953600,,179,5.172413793103448
5372534,2,B009YKFH6E,"You know how even when you watch a cheesy movie, you can work with it because somehow, even with the poor acting and poor lines, the senario and the handsome guy make you enjoy it when he finally takes her in his arms? At least there is that toe curling kiss right? Yeah this doesn't even have that. In fact, this show was all build up with no delivery. It COULD have been  good. It starts out ok but then completely unravels into nonsense. It vacillates from too light to too dark with no rhyme or reason. She meets a guy who comes across as a total loser and just attaches herself to him without any commitment from him. He is a billionaire who can't afford a razor and she is a damaged woman (her history is TOO dark for a rom-com) with an annoying lisp.

We never see any real catalyst for change in either of them so much as we see things like ""weeks later"" on the screen and we're supposed to understand that means the relationship has progressed, even though he claims from the beginning that he is leaving and gives her little more than a there there when she clings to him ""I hate to think of you leaving. I love you"". By the time this thing ended I felt so robbed of romance. I have never felt more apathetic towards a couple. can't recommend this one",1390780800,32,1261,4.228215767634855
5372535,3,B009YKFH6E,An interesting movie. The movie was a bit predictable but okay to watch. It a one time kind of movie.,1388880000,,101,4.1
5372536,4,B009YKFH6E,I thought this was pretty good.  I liked the male lead and thought he did an excellent job. The story line was good.  It wasn't in the league of Ever After but it was an enjoyable movie.,1388620800,,186,4.0

5372540,1,B009YKFH6E,Don't waiste your time.  Dialogue was juvenile.  Acting was mediocre at best.  No chemistry between leading couple.  It wasn't worth the time or money.,1379116800,13,151,5.166666666666667
5372541,2,B009YKFH6E,"Cheesy and ridiculous playing into every stereotype about love and romance that could be exhausted out of this tired plot.  The protagonist, with his stilted delivery, along with the lady so faire, acting technique everywhere but no real ""play"", as well as the entire supporting cast to which the lead alternately plays Santa Claus or just confuses, lays everything out on the table predictably and immediately.  The premise comes right out of a Harlequin play book, the death bed desires of a father concerned for his son's moral compass.  His ""cute meet"" is too cute via an accidental bar night.  The woman falls too easily, too quickly without enough of a relationship to fill a peanut before she is in love.  Get real.  Or is it fantastical?  Either way, this film stinks as a fable or as false possibility promising no insight into love, romance or life.  At least a fairy tale has more meaning than a trumped up happy ending.",1378944000,4,931,4.739130434782608
5372542,2,B009YKFH6E,"It had a good premise but the story had too many holes and made me not care for either of the main characters.  There was not enough development or depth.  This movie seemed to be something a group of aspiring writers, directors and actors who have recently learned the business of movie making and story telling but did not take the full courses.  Please pass go on this and move on to the next one.",1378080000,,400,4.306666666666667
5372543,5,B009YKFH6E,"I've always liked ""Cinderella"" type stories on film...you know, where a regular girl ends up with the grand prize or the marital blue ribbon. In this story, the son learns what his dying father hoped he would learn, rewarded those who helped him along the way when he was down, and ended up with a great young woman who truly loved him for himself, rather than his fortune.",1377302400,,373,4.5
5372544,4,B009YKFH6E,"The film was predictable without being tiresome, and the characters were convincing.  Naturally, I anticipated a happy ending, but liked some of the embellishments which made the individuals ""people"" one could like or dislike thoroughly.  There were some cute bits that I won't spoil for other viewers by revealing.  It is fun to see beauty and beautiful people and places, too.",1376956800,7,378,5.163934426229508
5372545,4,B009YKFH6E,This was a really nice romantic movie. The acting and story was really good and the lead male actor was very good looking and had a nice speaking voice.

My dad made me do this on his death bed... Please don't be angry angry at me for not telling you - and I am in LOVE with you!"" that's the movie. Worth watching? If you like romance - it's for you. Nice Italian spin on the romance. The character carries it off well - accent, etc...  He should have been from Italy - not California... I was very confused at the end... It could have been better. I would have loved to see him sweep the gal off her feet and take her in his private jet (Jetsetter type) to a fantastic Italian villa - in ""ITALY,""  perhaps Venice - definitely not Napa Valley!",1376179200,,871,4.1726190476190474

What I found funny at the end of the movie us that all the ""genuine"" people that didn't care about money were happy as pigs in excrement over the financial rewards rich boy gave them. This is a very small part of the movie, but I'm thinking...oh boy cynical writer.

I enjoyed looking at the actor, he's one HOT man.  I think they should have picked an equally attractive actress (or more attractive) if possible.  For such a traditional story line they missed the part where the woman is more attractive than the man.",1374710400,,708,4.5

5372554,3,B009YKFH6E,"The premise of this film is that a very rich Italian businessman promises his dying father he will spend one month away from home with no money. During the month, the former playboy meets the widow of an Army veteran and falls in love. The story is a fairly standard rich boy meets poor girl who doesn't know he's rich. There are a number of interesting characters in the movie and most of the scenes are fairly family-friendly. That being said, there is very poor character and plot development. Most of the things you would hope to see develop over the course of the movie are sort of simply taken for granted and a number of story lines either end up having nothing to do with the story in the end or sort of fall apart. I felt like I could see the chemistry between the main characters but there was little in the actual story to suggest how they could have ended up together as they did. They were in love after two hours of their first date and were soul mates within a week or two. As nice as the movie is, it could have been so much more. It's a watchable, if not memorable movie, but with a little better character development, it could have been a real gem.",1365206400,18,1167,4.261261261261262
