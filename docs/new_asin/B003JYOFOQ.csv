4131492,4,B003JYOFOQ,"The easy-going lives of a family living right next to an unused motorway are thrown into turmoil when it unexpectedly opens. Their efforts to cope with the sudden noise, intrusion, and pollution become increasingly desperate as, during the heat of summer, they descend into madness. There are definite Ballardian overtones in Meier's touching movie. It's a captivating examination of how modern existence can tip even the most equanimous over the edge given the right circumstances. The performances are uniformly excellent and the script avoids melodrama, keeping its feet firmly on the ground even when the family falls apart. Captivating, thoughtful and ultimately redemptive.",1290297600,5,679,5.601941747572815
4131493,2,B003JYOFOQ,"There is some sort of moral tale at the heart here about a weird, but happy, family living absurdly close to the end of a rural highway in France. Suddenly, the road is extended and reopened, and the family is surrounded by a mounting number of noisy speeding vehicles. The commentary is about man's destruction of natural beauty and quiet, I suppose. The radio reports of the freeway's opening are funny as the announcer absurdly extols the virtues of the new highway. The teenage daughter appears to do nothing but lay around and suntan all day while listening to heavy metal music. What the father does for a living is hard to say. The mother seems to be a bit bonkers and cannot bear the idea of ever leaving their rather squalid house, filled with dirty clutter. I half expected someone to get run over by a speeding car any minute. You won't come away with much from this little film.",1289692800,3,890,4.53416149068323
4131494,4,B003JYOFOQ,"A family's isolated idyllic existence along the edge of an abandoned highway is interrupted when it is unexpectedly opened for traffic.  Ursula Meier, in a potent directorial debut, depicts from the outset and directly without any need for explanation the effortless and carefree life of a family whose relative isolation enables them to live as they will, to escape from the expectations and judgments of others and live simply.  We are gradually made aware that their stability as a family depends upon this separation from the outside world.  This is especially true of the mother, played fearlessly by Isabelle Huppert, whose ability to manage the home and to cope with her situation begins to break down as the world intrudes.  There are hints that this is not the first time, and that they had come to this place in hopes of achieving some kind of stability.

The cinematography is rich, the performances uniformly strong, the story manages to work both as drama and as allegory.  I loved the soundtrack, and Nina Simone over the credits was a perfect ending.  I just finished seeing it the second time and it managed to both fascinate and frighten.  At some level this is, effectively, a highly restrained ecological horror film, where the monster is just the world encroaching in, in the form of increasing traffic and incessant noise and pollution, and that triggers desperation.  In many ways the film reminded me of a more subtle and smaller scale version of something like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mosquito-Coast/dp/B001DJLD08/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mosquito Coast</a>, and it works with the same issues: the idea of the need to escape into a carefree wilderness, the idea that a man should somehow protect his family at all costs from the risks of the outside world.

On the one hand, the drama that accompanies the gradual breakdown of their comfortable rituals is fascinating to watch.  Hints that the highway will be opening are met at first with disbelief, then curiosity and eventually despair.  On the other hand, as it develops there is a clear sense that something more is at stake here than the merely personal lives of this family.  There are hints of something more than just a realistic story of familial breakdown, and I couldn't help but think of Ballard's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Concrete-Island/dp/031242034X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Concrete Island</a>&nbsp;and of Bu&ntilde;uel's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Discreet-Charm-Of-The-Bourgeoisie/dp/B00004Z1FM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Discreet Charm Of The Bourgeoisie</a>, or even the much darker,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dogtooth/dp/B0044GAQ1O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dogtooth</a>.  After all the life they manage to lead is a kind of bourgeois fantasy - with a rugged male father figure who goes off into the unknown every day in order to bring back the supplies that will sustain his family, and of the beautiful wife who is keeper of the home, who greets each child as they come home from school with a ready-made snack, of the carefree innocence with which siblings bathe together nude - it is this fantasy they have managed to achieve apart, that inevitably won't last, but it's fascinating how far they are willing to go in an effort to maintain it.  The final shot, that depicts what is left of their efforts, from the perspective of an intrigued traveler on the highway, manages to say a great deal about general carelessness regarding the impact of the endless suburbanization of everyday life.  From the perspective of ""progress"" it's a good thing that everyone is connected and nobody can ever be away from the gaze of their neighbors.  I'm not so sure that's a good thing, but as the film makes clear it's not an easy thing to escape.",1286496000,22,3951,5.63575042158516

Have you ever found yourself wondering about those people who live right alongside the freeway - the anonymous folk whose lives we peer into for mere nano-seconds as we hurtle our way past their apartments and houses en route to our destinations?  Well, the artists who made ""Home"" certainly have, and the answer they've come up with makes for a fascinating, one-of-a-kind cinematic experience that, even more than most movies, has to be seen to be fully appreciated.

The family in ""Home"" leads a relatively carefree and decidedly unconventional lifestyle.  Their house stands adjacent to an abandoned freeway, which they use as their own private recreation area.  They also view bath time as a communal experience (this being Switzerland and all).

All is going reasonably well (despite some mild familial tension here and there), until one day and without any warning, the roadway is reopened to traffic, shattering the family's once-peaceful existence with the sounds of whooshing cars and honking horns, the penetrating odor of exhaust fumes and fossil fuels, a diminution of privacy (especially during traffic jams), and a nonstop assault on the senses.  Even getting to the other side of the road - to school or to work - becomes a daily, death-defying game of chicken with speeding vehicles whose drivers have no intention of slowing down for bothersome and unwelcome pedestrians.

This tremendously odd little film is obviously intended as a parable about the oppressiveness and chaos of modern life as it encroaches ever more forcefully onto the peace and tranquility of a rural existence.  The family members become increasingly ill-tempered, paranoid, neurotic, even violent as the outside world inexorably presses its way into their once-placid lives.

But far more than the characters and themes, it is the astonishing mise-en-scene that ultimately works its way into the viewer's psyche and that makes it hard not only to avert one's eyes during the course of the movie but to get back to one's own ""reality"" once it's over.  Director Ursula Meier's work here is reminiscent of Luis Bunuel in one of his less playful moods, as she focuses on a group of everyday people trapped in a surrealistic nightmare from which they are unable to awaken.  It is definitely a case in which the scene becomes an integral reflection of the psychological states of the characters.

Isabelle Hupert and Olivier Gourmet play the parents; Madeleine Budd and Kacey Mottet Klein their two children; and Adelaide Leroux, Gourmet's nubile daughter from a previous marriage who spends most of her time sunbathing for the highly appreciative motorists and truckers who keep whizzing on by.

Unique and unforgettable.",1285545600,47,2715,5.168949771689498
4131497,4,B003JYOFOQ,"Well after reading this high and mighty review, im buying it just so i can see just how ""special"" you are. lol.. Ok I got this film last night and watched it. expecting lots and lots a nudity based on the previous persons review. Geez what a prude.............. ok took a week to get the dvd,  the movie does start out with a bathroom seen  in which you see the whole family in there talking, and the 2 children are in the tub, you see her breasts for a few sec, and are only able to see the boy nude for another few sec as he gets out of the tub, then at the end of the film you see him nude from the rear for about 3 sec as he gets dressed.

4131498,1,B003JYOFOQ,"let's make this brief. i found this film tedious, irritating, nonsensical, hystrionic, bogus, contrived and self indulgent. do you allow your 19 year old daughter to take naked baths with your 10 year old son, while you sit by the tub chain smoking and chatting about ... whatever? are you willing to live by a freeway, and wall up your windows and doors to block out the noise, because the mother of the household ""can't live anywhere else?"" well then, fire up this dvd, it'll be just like home for y'all.

for those of us who don't marry our cousins, the murky mixture of symbolism, fantasy, eroticism and je-m'en-foutisme stewed up as a plot is unmotivated by character, circumstance or thematic coherence. yes, i get it, the freeway is the symbol of encroaching technology, the family a symbol of the simple(ton) life, their travails the struggle of the common man ... but the ending, with the family breaking out of their walled up home and wandering dazed and drained along the freeway is both opaque and infuriatingly empty. you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll pound your head on the pavement, screaming ""why the hell did i watch that thing?""",1282953600,15,1146,4.787878787878788

4131508,4,B003JYOFOQ,"First of all, the description does not include the darker aspects of this film.  Yes, it's in French, but the director is Swiss.  There is a quality to this film that is definitely not French, and the director's background may explain it.  Also, it was not filmed in France or Switzerland, but Bulgaria, so don't try to place the scenery into France.  It looks a lot like southern California in a drought.  I kept thinking, ""This isn't France,"" and it was a little distracting to me but finally the action was even more distracting so I let that go.

The nudity that many of the reviews mention is fairly normal for a European family (although less so over time).  The young son is sharing a bath with his older stepsister.  It is not sexual, and one gets the feeling that the whole family treats him as younger than he is chronologically.  But this family has loose boundaries when it comes to bathing and sleeping together.  Again this movie is very European and you need to understand that they are not Puritan about their bodies for the most part.

I felt the opening scenes put us in a post-apocalyptic frame of mind.  Where in the world are they?  A deserted road?  House in the middle of fields?  No one else around?  Yet the father does go to work, in a town somewhere (he wears a shirt with a name badge on it, so not a professional), and the 2 young kids go to school via a school bus, so there must be a life somewhere else.  That science-fiction feeling never left, the whole movie has something strange and unpleasant throughout it.  We kept waiting for a huge tragedy which never really arrived - even the sudden departure of the oldest daughter was not really treated as a tragedy but merely a puzzling event, more along the lines of ""the postman didn't come today.""

Isabelle Huppert seems to like to play women with some quality of madness or dysfunction about them.  She carries this role very well.  The other actors are also solid in their roles.  I cannot complain about the acting, although again, the script is bizarre in many places and this is NOT a realistic film.  The characters do the best they can under the circumstances, trying to find solutions once the highway opens up, but their lives are increasingly limited until walling themselves into the house seems like a good idea.  Won't spoil the ending but it won't stop you thinking about this family and their ""home"" once the credits roll.

p.s.  I changed my rating fron 3 stars to 4, because I can't get this movie out of my head.  That, to me, means that it reached me on a deeper level than just an ordinary Hollywood-type of movie, and the more I think about it, the more questions I have.  The acting was solid so I think it does merit 4 stars, although it was strange.  I like strange films even if I struggle with them. YMMV.",1463270400,,2816,4.466666666666667

4131634,4,B003JYOFOQ,"Other reviews call this family ""bizarre."" I guess you could say that, but most often we refer to others as bizarre just because they are different from us. This family did live differently than most of us do. But different is OK. The thing that stood out to me at first was they are different because they are a very happy family, close knit. Most of us are busy with our routines and daily life and struggle to bond with those living in our home. (Spoiler alert). Though communal nudity is not my thing, I have known other families in my life where they believed being naked in front of other family members was normal to them, natural. I am personally not comfortable with that, but if that's their thing, OK.
There was so much more going on in this movie than meets the eye. I think many viewers could not watch the movie simply because they could not connect to the situation. What I saw was a happy family, living in a peaceful place. The mother had previously struggled emotionally and had found her home in this out of the way location, an old motel by an old highway it looked like. The kids could live freely and not worry about dangers and influences, Then the worst happens. The highway reopens. Being a shortcut to two locations, traffic went nuts. Now, instead of being out away from everything, the world was literally in their lap. As others have pointed out, this illustrates how intrusive reality can be in our lives. It is difficult to find and maintain a peaceful existence in this life. The movie delves into how these changes have a profound affect on, not just our lives, but our minds.
As things progress, you see what it is like to live in a home where there is mental illness and how that affects every member of the home. Watching this should give us empathy for the real life families who struggle with this debilitating health issue.
And on a deeper level, there was the analogy that could be drawn by most any of us. When we are happy, life tends to not allow us to stay that way. We are bombarded on every side by things that steal our joy. And when something hurts us, we build walls around us to protect us and shut us safely away from those hurts. But as you can see through this film, that is not a healthy way to respond. And at some point, you need to break free of those walls, to move forward and find your way to a new life. We need to overcome or get away from the things that hurt us, but shutting ourselves away only harms us more.
Overall, I really enjoyed the movie because I saw so many levels of things in the story. It was about far more than what you see at face value. It was deeper. It was about life's realities. About living with mental illness in the family. About emotional health. And about finding your happy place. Yes, having subtitles was inconvenient, but the story line allowed you to keep up. Yes, the family was different than many of us. But please remember it's OK to be different.",1427932800,16,2946,4.367941712204007

The love in this atypical, off-the-grid family -- wanted to shake the older adolescent and wondered about the indulgence, also wondered about everyone's doting on Michel, the young boy -- was love. It was pure, different than most of us experience, and you'd think it unshakeable but it can crack. Wished for more outcome, but I suppose that's left in our heads to imagine.

4131699,5,B003JYOFOQ,"Huppert holds the whole darn thing together with a combination of bohemian charm and austere maternity,as well as a whole lot of mental health issues like agrophobia. This is the story of a family who live next to a soon-to-be-finished highway,almost very close to the guard-rail,sunbathing don't you know,and hanging their washing out in front of it. They never explore their hinterland perpendicularly,theyre obsessed with crossing the rails,playing on the macadam,or strolling merrily along it or the son Julien cycles frenetically up and down it. Are the family owners or squatters,its never clear,only that the mother(Huppert)doesnt want to move again,and prior to the road opening,likes the bucolic charm of the open countryside. The family are reasonably eccentric, disinhibited physically(daughters go barebreasted in front of their father and their brother),Huppert is the dippy matron of this small circus.

This is like a cartoon,the comedy is in the fact that the tenants observe the motorway, rather than become observed by the passing traffic. They also seem obsessed about getting across the motorway,when its full of traffic. The family make a lot of communal bathing, smoking cigarettes indoors,a radio,which is on all day and have a car that they use to get out of the place,to purchase all their necessary foodstuffs, the father to go to work,the children to go to school. One wonders why the house was not compulsorily purchased, when the motorway was in the process of being built. The family live a reasonably settled existence-minus the odd teenage rebellion-prior to the motorway opening. Dad(Olivier Gourmet) is brotherly to his children and loving to his wife, all tuned in to the same wavelength of humour.

Then all hell breaks loose.the shattering of this tranquil space by whooshing cars, honking horns,car fumes,exhaust pollutants, despoiling their vegetable patch, their washing and their skin with the stain of fossil fuels. Even crossing the road becomes a death-defying game of chicken,with the traffic making no effort to slow down. You realise that the mise-en-scene is a state of mind defying the remorseless odds of modern existence. The family become increasingly neurotic,cranky,stubborn,perverse,ill-tempered, paranoid and violent. We go from a movie by Hulot to one by Haneke. Huppert holds them hostage to this existence,as she refuses to even contemplate moving,so they batten down the hatches,but the elder precocious daughter leaves, the noise and loss of privacy leads the father to walling up windows and doors,placing insulation material against the walls,their sleep and health affected by airless heat.

This part of the movie is very dark as the father(Gourmet) wants them to leave and the children live in fear as they are driven to huddle up to their mother,he has attempted to put them all to sleep with sleeping pills. We get to a stage of deep anxiety,where this family seem unable to cope. Huppert as ever seem to contain the pain and the elegance together,Gourmet is great support,the son Julien puts in a superbly energetic and affecting performance,and the cat is ubiquitously entertaining. Such a film of surreal madness,partly written by the director,shows enormous talent. Reality or parable this subject taps into our modern fears,spinning with originality.",1397692800,4,3323,5.3865384615384615

4131704,3,B003JYOFOQ,"This french, film attracted my interest for its indie festival rounds.  I also love french indie drama films with subtitles.  This story is peculiar in that it is set in modern time, but in the french country side, where a ten year old, unfinished highway is resting 30 feet from their front door.  The picturesque view in every direction is made of wheat and rolling hills, besides this ribbon of blacktop.  The family is uber happy being together, laughing and playingoften times naked.  One gets the feeling that they are conservationist, hippy types as they share bathroom time together.  Teenage breast and a six year olds penis are visible during bath time.  But, it's French.  The 18ish year old daughter suns each day in a bikini in the front yard beside the highway.  The abandoned highway is an ever-present fixture in their lives as they utilize the nearest lanes as a patio where their inflatable pool rest along with various scooters, bbq, and chairs.

But then one day the roadway eventually opens and this is where the idealistic, utopia of their environment turns grey.  At this point, the family is driven through unsettling depths and challenges that give a deeper meaning to the movie.  Environmental negative pressures of societal togetherness at the end of the movie are now juxtaposed against the families happy togetherness throughout the first three quarters of the movie.  Now the increasing traffic is heavy, the penetrating sound is unbearable, the family cat can't wonder off, and it's no longer safe to drop the garbage on the other side of the road.  What happens to their happy life, their togetherness, their sanity?

Odd story.  But, I want to watch it again to gain more insight into the turmoil and suspicious, psych issues presented at the end of the film.",1392854400,,1792,4.8841059602649

This movie celebrates the ups and downs of life, and It's very human -- very real. It's a European Art film. It has a simple plot and a great deal of character development. The acting is superb. You really get to understand this family.  Without spoiling it, it is bittersweet in some ways, but the level of family commitment by the mom and dad is something that few of us have experienced in our lives, and that's the point -- life is a journey, not a destination.  This is a wonderful film about family and how the bonds of love can overcome extreme challenges.

This artwork is in French, so if you are in North America and speak no French, you'll need to get the DVD for Region 1 players that comes with English subtitles.

Enjoy!

-- Here's some official info on the flick:

Switzerland's official entry for Best Foreign Language Film at the 82nd Academy Awards, HOME is a mesmerizing fable of modern family life starring internationally renowned actress Isabelle Huppert (The Piano Teacher).

Huppert plays Marthe, a happy-go-lucky mother whose family enjoys an idyllic existence in their isolated, ramshackle home, which edges onto an abandoned highway. Almost entirely cut off from society at large, they forge their own utopia. Everything changes when city trucks roll in to complete the road's construction, allowing rush hour traffic to start rumbling by. Refusing to give up their solitude, Marthe, her husband Michael (Olivier Gourmet), and their three children resort to increasingly desperate measures to insulate themselves from the pollution creeping inside their windows.

With her debut feature, director Ursula Meier has created ""a bewitching dream of a film"" (London Telegraph), a funny, moving, and thought-provoking drama that tackles issues of environmental anxiety, familial strife, and the essential pleasure of a quiet night inside. With ""terrific performances and superb cinematography"" (Time Out NY) by Agnes Godard (Beau Travail), HOME exhibits a unique force and beauty that is an announcement of a major filmmaking talent.

4131714,4,B003JYOFOQ,"I live on a very busy road with all manner of heavy traffic whipping by every couple of seconds, so it was interesting to see this family struggle with the change from isolation to no privacy at all.

Unlike other reviewers, I didn't think there was any deep hidden message here about technology or nature- I thought it was all about how people's behavious changes with their environment, privacy or the lack of it, and how they adapt to cope.

Not for everyone, maybe, especially if you need action and messages rammed down your throat, but I found it believable, different and very watchable.",1343865600,,594,4.701923076923077
4131715,4,B003JYOFOQ,"I was browsing for a good movie in the foreign movie section of my local public library here in Blue Ash, and when I noticed this one, I had to pick it up right away, if not else since this stars Isabelle Huppert, a legend in French cinema.

""Home"" (98 min.; originally released in 2008) brings the tale of a family of five living in splendid isolation in a house along an incomplete highway. We learn they have lived like this for 10 years, and quite happily and care-free. The opening scene of the family playing street-hockey is a perfect introduction. Alas, disaster strikes when the news comes that the highway is being completed and opened. What initially is a trickle of cars becomes a wave of cars and trucks, and the family's entire existence as they knew it comes to an end. Isabelle Huppert's character does not want to move at any cost, and to battle the never-ending noice, the family shuts all windows and doors and layers the house with tons of sound-proofing material. This time, the resulting isolation is not so splendid.

""Home"" is the original title of the movie, which is a bit curious since this is a French-speaking movie. That aside, this was Switzerland's official entry for the Foreign Movie Oscars for 2008 and it's easy to see why. This is a dark movie, for sure, but one that is definitely worth seeking out. Isabelle Huppert, 56 years old when this was filmed, looks as beautiful as ever, and her acting skills are tops. But the other family members are quite good as well, in particular the little boy. Highly recommended!",1310169600,4,1553,4.6231884057971016
4131716,2,B003JYOFOQ,"Home Ursula Meier, Switzerland/France/Belgium 2009.

  Euro trailer trash (OK,not literally) Marthe, Michael and 3 kids live by an uncompleted highway. Marthe is kind of cuckoo, unable to think of leaving, Michael goes off to a real job, albeit one where his name is embroidered on the shirt, older daughter Judith spends her time sunbathing to heavy metal soundtrack, younger children Marion and Julien commute to school,  It's a ramshackle existence, but not without gaiety.

 Their life is upset when the road is completed, walling off their enclave and subjecting them to increasing noise and pollution.  They cope for a while, but things reach a climax, and Michael closes up the house with cinder blocks to the point of suffocation.  I won't give away the denouement, although other reviewers already have, but it seems strained and ""symbolic"".

 And that's my problem with this film.  I like the offbeat, the film that's a bit difficult to get into.  But this one tries too hard to go from director Meier's wondering about the lives of people in remote houses by the highway to something Significant, and comes across, to me, as simply pretentious rather than insightful.",1308268800,,1178,5.046632124352332

""Home"" wrestles with just that idea, what is a home? Is it a place, is it a feeling, is it the people you live with, and if all those things change, then what exactly is it?  Home takes place in a  french countryside,  bordering a 10 year abandoned interstate that never opened.  The family has adapted and extend its boundary line incorporating it into part of their kingdom; they play hockey on it, watch TV on it, barbecue on it, sun on it, and even have their satellite dish attached to its guard rail. But is this family prepared psychologically to maintain this idea of home, when progress drives through the front yard or, will they be imprisoned in a castle of their  own choosing?",1305417600,5,886,4.46583850931677
4131718,4,B003JYOFOQ,"Home is not where the heart is.....but where absurdity lives.  This French family is living right smack off a dead road, their lives are strewn on the road, couch, wading pool, toys, etc.  Until, the road is opened to a highway and they choose to adapt to the highway noise.

Marthe, the wife has previously been a drug addict and while vulnerable, does not want to move once the absurdity of living on the major highway becomes what some might say, unbearable.  The family consists of Marthe, her husband, three children, two teenage girls and a boy about 8 years.

You do not see anything other than the highway and the home, giving the viewer first hand look at the closeness and confines of living on the highway.  But Marthe refuses to move,  her husband takes drastic measures to ward off the noise, one daughter is paranoid believing they will all die with the contamination and the other daughter drifts away too.  The madness slowly creeps up.

There is 30 minute interview with Director Ursula Meier.  The idea of someone living on the highway was based on her knowledge of that situation.  The details are information, being the building of a highway from a road not in France, the noise level studied, the addition of 300 cars, etc.

Now, here is America, we are not accustomed to viewing children in the nude, and moreso, children in the nude with their parents.  An 8-yr old boy in the bathtub with his mother?

This too close knit family, a husband, wife, two teenage girls and a little boy, have evidently been there a long time, and the mother doesn't mind that they live in relative isolation.
