8026054,3,B0002CH7RK,"So limited, Check out this review though:  What can I say, Excellent! Packaging for the Incredible hulk, the episode booklet, the mini poster, 2 single sided discs, and I had worried as I had purchased the box set of the other Marvel 1966 heroes but this one includes the individual title pages with the recap. Although I was thinking the recaps are maybe not needed as the episode they recap is just before them on the disk I still like that they were included and I did want the 3 episode title pages. The theme song and closing music is at the beginning and end of the 3 episodes however, and I agree that works fine. This presentation may not be for everyone but then what is? If like me you are in region one all you should have to do is use your computer DVD and when inserted the program for viewing should pop up a screen asking if you want to change to region 2. You may be limited on changes so take note. I read that someone did not like that the recaps were not included on the others (Cap., Thor, Shell-head, and subby) but like I said, I didn't miss the recaps as much as the title screens. I hope others from the US see this, I know we have been waiting for the license people to get it together and let these out to us; funny, I had to go to the UK to get my Marvel Super-heroes. Hey, whatever works. so to recap, 5 stars for packaging, 5 for one sided disks, 5 for features, and 5 for the UK for getting them out, I would give all the above 10's if I could.  In conclusion; as Stan would say, EXCELSIOR!  they list this as 13 episodes but all 39 are there. Amazon UK also has the Captain America with the others, I bought the box set for the others. Not as complete as the hulk but only missing the recaps and additional 2 title screens per 3 episode group. I actually liked both presentations but the hulk is closest to the original airings. I have seen the Cap dvds 4 times so I guess they have my approval and all contain the 13 episodes.",1226620800,3,1958,4.133858267716535
