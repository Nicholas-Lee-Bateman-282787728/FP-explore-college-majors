809036,4,6304212151,"I had been looking forward to seeing ""Crossfire"" for a number of years; it never seemed to be available on any of the channels I had access to.  I finally got my wish and I was duly impressed.  This is a very good movie that tells the story of what hate can do if left unchallenged.  It is, thus, a message that is timeless in its' relevance.  However, as I understand it, the screenplay altered the book (""The Brick Foxhole"" by Richard Brooks) because the subject matter was ahead of its' time.  In the book, the murderous anger is directed against homosexuals which would, to me, make for a more effective movie than the one that was presented.  That comment aside, the elements of fear, prejudice, anger and superstition are all woven well together along with some very good acting.  Robert Ryan is the dominant character both on the screen and in the plot.  Playing almost an opposite personality is the low-key, almost bored, yet quite efficient policeman played by Robert Young.  In between those two extremes is the role played by Robert Mitchum.  This was from the era when Mitchum seemed at his peak in acting abilities and his role in ""Crossfire"" underscores his strength on the screen.  The other roles are played with varying abilities.  The transformation of the Ryan character from bully to desperate was very well done.  There is a very small but interesting twist to the plot that caught me off-guard and helped me understand how the perpetrator was to be brought to justice.  This is one of those film noir movies that shows the darker side of humanity.  Its' message works very well thanks to good acting, directing, writing, and camera work.",1090022400,3,1660,4.715277777777778
809037,4,6304212151,"Edward Dmytryk's ""Crossfire"" was a powerful and seminal treatise dealing with anti-Semitism in post- WWII America.  He broached an issue previously tabooed in films which was on the minds of many in the U.S. in the aftermath of the Holocaust.
Washington D.C. is teaming with servicemen who fought in the war but are presently idle with spare time on their hands.  Inactivity leads to tragedy as a group of three inebriated soldiers are involved in the savage beating death of a man who turns out to be Jewish. The leader of the group is Robert Ryan, in an Oscar nominated performance, playing Montgomery a bigoted loathing, hateful man unable to control his emotions. He bullies his other two cohorts into silence.  George Cooper, one of the two other soldiers, is a naive timid man who longs for his wife.  He had been so tipsy that he doesn't have any recollection of the crime, so Ryan tries to implicate him.  He quiets the third soldier by killing him and making it look like suicide.
Robert Young playing the coy and placid police captain Finlay, who had been exposed to Irish bigotry, is assigned to investigate the case.  With the help of U.S. Army sergeant Robert Mitchum they uncover enough evidence to suspect Ryan, but have no motive.  Young decoys Ryan and tricks him into revealing his deep seated violent feelings of anti-Semitism which soon incriminate him.",1076284800,3,1373,4.817021276595745
809038,5,6304212151,"Landing one of the lead roles in RKO's low-budget gem, Crossfire placed Robert Ryan at the forefront of the studio's exciting new stars. Although the actor's intensity had been tapped in two earlier films, Marine Raiders and The Woman on the Beach, Crossfire was pivotal in terms of future roles that would come his way.
Several brillant, controversial minds came together on Crossfire, in the persons of producer Adrian Scott, director Edward Dmytryk, screenwriter John Paxton, and executive producer Dore Schary. As a penetrating example of the film noir genre, the thematic elements of alienation, isolation and loneliness received a grand treatment in Crossfire, as all of its characters are depicted in a state of flux, in limbo. Soldiers and civilians alike are portrayed as tired, bored, frustrated souls, trying to pick up the pieces of their lives, victims of the emotional turmoil of World War II. All are searching, waiting for something to happen, and as depicted by the professionals from RKO, the performances are superb. The choice of the three leads in Crossfire was a stroke of genius, validating Schary's sagacity in casting and in public relations. In accepting the unsympathetic role of the sadistic bigot, Montgomery, Ryan took a big risk in career terms, since a failure of the movie might have short-circuited his advancement.
He always viewed his role in Crossfire as a mixed blessing, and believed it contributed to his being typecast as a perennial heavy. Although today Ryan is often remembered for that part alone, in a larger sense it served him well, since from his Best Supporting Actor nomination in 1947, he became a major contender for stardom. Moreover, it was a statement, albeit inadvertent, of his and everyone else's conflicts and ambivalences as human beings. His friend Henry Fonda once said that acting was therapy for him, a way of expressing the positve and negative aspecturs of humanity, but with a constructive purpose Ryan seemed to have shared those sentiments.",1042675200,3,2010,5.1310975609756095
809039,5,6304212151,"While ""Gentleman's Agreement"" exposed anti-Semitic bigotry among New York's sophisticated cocktail set, RKO's ""Crossfire"" tackled the topic from a Middle American perspective as Robert Ryan gave one of his most stirring performances as a soldier returning to America from war filled with hatred.
""Crossfire"" was one of the greatest low budget achievements in film history, earning five Academy Award nominations.  Director Edward Dmytryk turned out a gem on a $550,000 budget.  It was shot in 20 days.  Dmytryk shot 140 scenes distributed out over a 6 1/2 hour daily schedule, a pace of 20 scenes per day.
The film noir classic was based on the novel ""The Brick Foxhole"" written by ex-Marine Richard Brooks, who would later became a film writer, and finally the great director of classics such as ""Elmer Gantry"" and ""In Cold Blood.""  Brooks' novel differed from the film in one basic area.  In the book Montgomery, the hateful killer, murdered a homosexual, while also revealing a hatred for Jews.  In the movie he was revealed as a former police officer from St. Louis who detested Jews, killing kindly Sam Levene, who invited him into his Washington, D.C. residence for a drink.
The film encompasses one very busy night in our nation's capital, in which Robert Mitchum, playing a worldwise, cool-headed sergeant, helps police detective Robert Young to solve the case.  Mitchum is determined from the outset to clear George A. Cooper, the vulnerable young soldier on whom Ryan seeks to pin the crime, taking advantage of the fact that Cooper had been drinking and cannot initially adequately account for his time during the time period of the crime.
Cooper's cause is aided by Paul Kelly, who plays a bizarre, mentally troubled man with a penchant for alcohol and a strong urge for B-girl Gloria Grahame, who takes Cooper back to her apartment.  Not wanting to get involved, Grahame refuses to help provide Cooper with an alibi, not even after Cooper's wife, Jacqueline White, has interceded on her husband's behalf.  Just as Young, Cooper and White are about to leave, Kelly, having overheard the conversation, walks into the living room and corroborates Cooper's account of events.
Ryan commits a second murder, killing fellow soldier Steve Brodie when he fears that he will go to the police, strangling him with his victim's Army tie.  It is the shrewd Young, who reveals to Mitchum that his own Irish immigrant grandfather was killed by a bigoted mob not long after coming to America, whose expertise ultimately traps Ryan into revealing himself.  He uses young Southerner William Phipps, a soldier Ryan likes to make fun of, to reveal information that proves perfect bait for the merciless killer, who falls into the trap.
One outstanding noir ploy of the film is that, in order to hide Cooper from the D.C. police while he is under suspicion for murder, the wily Mitchum takes him to an all-night movie theater.  Mitchum and fellow soldiers periodically surface in the darkened theater to hold quiet strategy sessions, focused on the task at hand of clearing Cooper and proving their steadfast belief that Ryan is the killer of Levene.  The all-night theater idea was adapted from Brooks' novel.
RKO intended to use the ""Crossfire"" team of Dmytryk, producer Adrian Scott and screenwriter John Paxton on numerous other projects.  The right wing anti-Communist witch hunt period surfaced at that inauspicious point as Dmytryk and Scott eventually went to jail for contempt of Congress as two members of the Hollywood Ten.",1015804800,27,3526,5.036082474226804
809040,4,6304212151,"In one of the first films to expose the issue of anti-Semitism in post WWII America, Edward Dmytryk's 1946 film Crossfire, brings forth the dangerous venality of ethnic hatred to an unsuspecting screen audience.  A  hit at the box office and a winner of several humanitarian awards,  Crossfire is most remembered by Robert Ryan's portrayal of a twisted,  menacing, racist who vilifies Jews.  Ryan as the callous G.I. Montgomery,  created a screen presence that would secure him numerous roles as  Hollywood's most notorious racist. In reality, Robert Ryan was actually a  champion of civil liberties and an agressive campaigner for equality of  rights among minority groups.  Although scriptwriter John Paxton and RKO  producer Adrian Scott were nervous about the film's public reaction; credit  should be given to the creative team of Dmytryk, Paxton, and Scott for  collaborating on a film dealing with a controversial topic that was buried  in American society.  While other major studies such as Warner Brothers,  Paramount, and MGM refrained from social ""message films"" minor  studio RKO showed resilience in forging an avenue for future social  commentary films such as Gentleman's Agreement, and Bad Day At Black Rock.  The film's storyline is pure noir; an innocent man is accused of murder and  a midnight to dawn investigation of the true killer ensues.  Robert Mitchum  plays G.I. Keeley, who aids in the murder investigation.  George Cooper is  Finlay, the naive, innocent, soldier on the run.  Gloria Grahame recieved  an Academy Award nomination for her brief appearance as a prostitute, and  like Robert Ryan solidified a position in future urban noir films.  Crossfire is one of those films that has largely been forgotten by film  buffs.  Do not let this one slip by you.",961286400,21,1788,5.171929824561404
809217,3,6304212151,"Dated feeling but nonetheless effective film noir.  Kind of simplistic presentation of anti-semitism, but that is a theme not addressed all that often in films I am familiar with. Robert Mitchum gives a very strong performance",1465776000,,226,5.277777777777778

809219,4,6304212151,"I enjoyed this movie very much on various levels.  The cast is very strong.  The movie is a fine example of film noir.  I am extremely interested in film noir.  A lot of film noir is about the use of dramatic lighting effects.  Also, this is perhaps my favorite Robert Ryan role.  Additionally, this is an early example of the post World War II movies about civil rights and equality.

It has become crystal clear to me that the America of today has changed very much from the World War II era.  Prejudice of all types was accepted as a fact of life.  Slowly there was a movement towards civil rights.  This movie is an early example of the theme of anti semitism in American Society at that time.  Let us remember how much people of the Jewish Faith suffered during World War II.

But there is another very interesting aspect to this movie.  It is based on a novel ""The Brick Foxhole"" written by a gentleman named Richard Brooks.  Richard Brooks' birth name was Reuben Sax and his family is of Jewish Heritage.  Mr. Brooks was very sensitive to prejudice of various kinds.  Although the book The Brick Foxhole mentions various prejudices including anti semitism, the most serious incident, a homicide, is about homophobia in the book.  This theme is morphed into anti semitism in the movie.  I have read that the theme of homophobia was deemed to be a ""bridge too far"" for the time.

I have read The Brick Foxhole.  Although I enjoyed both the novel and the movie, I liked the movie better than the novel.  Probably because of the strong cast and the fact that I am fascinated by film noir.  But the most interesting part of the whole experience to me was the various themes of prejudice being portrayed and the judgement to change themes from the book to the movie.  If a viewer wishes to see another post World War II film about anti Semitism, please consider ""Gentlman's Agreement"".  Thank You...",1450915200,,1900,4.553254437869822

Although the primary plot revolves around a murder motivated by anti-Semitism, ""Crossfire"" also implicitly explores the effects of war on a soldier.  Almost all of the soldier characters are restless and enraged, forerunners of the ticking-time-bomb-Vietnam-Veteran trope that was part of our popular culture for so long.  ""Crossfire"" was based on Richard Brooks's novel ""The Brick Foxhole"", which featured the murder of a homosexual soldier.  Hollywood's Production Code at the time forbade the portrayal of homosexuality, so the victim (played by veteran character actor Sam Levene) became Jewish.  Gloria Grahame's character is almost certainly a prostitute, but the Production Code wouldn't allow that either.  Nor would the code allow the frank and crude vocabulary that would be used by such characters in real life.  All in all, ""Crossfire"" is worth a viewing from people who are looking for an example of how Hollywood worked with the censors to get out the message that all was not well among our soldiers after World War Two.",1367971200,,1183,5.1947368421052635

But that my two kids were gripped, well, that's saying something ('black and white', they used to say, means 'boring'). A classic is supposed to captivate you from the onset, and hold your attention throughout the unwinding plot - and this delivers. I love the ""flashback technique"", and the retelling of stories from the perspective of several key figures. It is a highly effective way to ""round out"" a plot, with the viewer in the privileged position of seeing matters through various pairs of eyes.

The dialogue is perfect, the casting spot on. Robert Mitchum guides the show along, the link between the various characters and subplots, but accolades should also be showered on the other two Roberts, Young and Ryan, who assume opposite roles in this game of cat and mouse.

The plot is a straightforward case of whodunit, which becomes fairly apparent after the first 15-20 minutes or so (at least to me when I first watched it). Thereafter, it's a question of watching Young's character try to build his case and lay his trap for the murderer. Young's speech against anti-Semitism and the need to ""do the right thing"", a monologue of several minutes, is priceless. Succinct and powerful. It makes you think, as it's designed to do, and remains pertinent to this day. It is a thrilling story, brilliantly acted by this first-rate cast.

809393,5,6304212151,"The subtitle for Crossfire is: ""Hatred is like a loaded gun!""  Contrary to the impression given by the sensationalistic theatrical poster reproduced on the DVD cover, the film tells an importantly moral story.  It is built around the central theme of racial hatred and its plot devolves around the murder of a Jewish man.

The subject of antisemitism was quite controversial in American films when this movie was being made in 1947.  The original film-story derived from a novel which actually dealt with the murder of a homosexual, but, as the subject of homosexuality was extremely restricted by Hollywood codes at this time, Edward Dmytryk managed to tell the story by making the murder victim a Jew.

Once the film was ready for showing, the film-makers were reluctant to bring it out for fear of the adverse reception it might meet and they decided to show it to a review audience of Jewish rabbis, then to an audience of Catholic priests, and then to an audience of Protestant priests.  All these religious leaders were favorably impressed, did not find it offensive, and advised going ahead with the public showing.

Creative use of lighting plays an important role in this film.  Notice, for instance, such dramatic techniques as the silhouetted murder scene which opens the story, and the silhouetted staircase near the end, which, when the killer is about to be captured, suggests jail-like bars. (Dmytryk said that he determined to make lighting and audio serve for 20% of the film's effectiveness, and only 80% was to come from the actors, several of whom were obscure, but others of whom were quite outstanding, such as Robert Ryan, Robert Mitchum, and Robert Young.)

I noticed the dramatic significance of lighting throughout the film, but I didn't know until I watched the Commentary Feature which recapitulated the film scenically in a tutorial that lasted about 1  hours, that the use of light and shadow--and mainly shadow--is the basis of definition for what is called  the ""film noir"" genre!  I was very pleased to learn more about ""film noir"" and also, because of the Commentary, to add some new titles to my list of films to see.  There is another brief commentary about 15 minutes long.  The entire Feature Section comes as a decided Plus of this particular Crossfire DVD package.  Altogether, you'll spend over three hours viewing the movie and the educational material, lengthy but interesting and high quality, that accompanies it.  Viewing both is, I feel, well worthwhile.

The tutorial by Alain Silver and James Ursini with Edward Dmytryk could serve almost as the basic outline for a whole COURSE in film noir.  It was also informative about the anti-Communist movement which was sweeping America when this film was made, and Dmytrych tells how that movement affected him personally.

Robert Young plays an ""Irish cop"" with a ""difference"" here.  He is dignified, perspicacious, a Detective Captain, almost sophisticated-appearing in his very neat herringbone-weave wool suit and comfortable pipe.  I found it especially interesting to observe the penetrating facial expressions and other details which Young used to portray this intriguingly likable detective.  When he removes his hat in the final scene, he looks more like a professor or a doctor than a policeman!

To a point, the film portrays the inner psychology and mannerisms of the killer. (Note the insightful remarks on the Commentary regarding these traits.)

The more I see of 1940s movies, the more I notice that they are often ""psychological"" in nature, affording psychological insights into the characters and sometimes built around plots that involve ""psychiatric"" situations.  It seems to me that there is almost always a meaningfulness and morality in the so-called ""film noir"" movies.

Because of its lurid cover, I at first misjudged this movie, expecting it to be a trivial gangster movie, but it turned out to be quite a worthwhile drama that also opened the door, through its Commentary, to a cornucopia of other good films.

809394,3,6304212151,"In a recent review of a 1950s crime noir, Pickup At South Street, a film that combined the ordinary subject matter of this genre, some crime doesn't pay scam, with a veneer of 1950s political anti-communist ""red scare"" political conformity I noted that putting the two together weakened the film. That is the case here as well although the combination is somewhat different-a seemingly senseless murder committed under mysterious circumstances in post-World War II New York and with a very heavy dose of plebeian anti-Semitism mixed in. Not that the question of anti-Semitism cannot be properly portrayed in film, witness the same years Oscar film,  Gentleman's Agreement, but under the plot line (and character development) here it just doesn't jell. It might have worked just as well as a straight police procedural with no particular social message. Here's why.

This is a tale of the three Roberts. Robert Ryan, a twisted pycho Army NCO lifer-type with a hard anti-Semitic craze, frames one of his men for a foul murder of a ""civilian"" shirker (said shirker in reality having been discharged as a result of wounds performing his military duty in the war). Needless to say this shirker (aren't they all) is Jewish (a ""Jewboy"" in Ryan's vernacular). And murder brings in Robert Young as a hard-bitten New  York detective who is assigned the case and who smells a rat (Ryan) early on but can not quite put his finger on it.  And enter too Robert Mitchum as a fellow Army NCO who also smells a rat, although he too is not quite sure who did it.

As the story evolves it is clear that Ryan's chosen fall guy didn't do it (although his whereabouts, his actions, and his alcohol-induced ""fog"" didn't help his case) and that Ryan did. That part works, works decently enough for a second-rung crime noir, but there is never any strong motivation presented for Ryan's anti-Semitism other than the plebeian platitudes common to gentile attitudes toward Jews then, and perhaps, now. I know from my own working class background that attitude, and the expression of those attitudes among 1950s Irish Catholic working-class kids (""they killed Christ, see""). They should have left this one to stand on its crime doesn't pay, especially for pychos theme.",1321920000,,2241,4.917989417989418

Had Monty Clift been cast instead, with more Robert Ryan anti-Semitism and less Robert Young speechifying, this would've been a winner. 6/10",1310860800,2,417,4.805555555555555

There are a number of suspects, all of them army men, who were out drinking and crossed paths with the murdered man.  The prime suspect is a troubled man returning home after 4 years of war; his marriage is perhaps on the rocks and his friends want to cover for him.  Mitchum, for once a good guy and not a suspect, runs interference while figuring out what is going on, all the time trying to help his friend to save his marriage.  It is an interesting mix of people, esp. Robert Young, who I always thought he was an under-rated actor.  Slowly, Young pieces together what he thinks is the likely motive, eventually telling his story about a long-ago murder that affected him in a moving speech.  Thus, the film is a good snapshot of America right after the war, addressing demobilization and prejudice.

809511,4,6304212151,"A film which starred three Roberts; Young, Mitchum and Ryan; it is actually Robert Ryan (a favourite of mine) who has the most dramatic part; and he makes the most of his opportunity.

The story involves the death of Samuels (Sam Levene), who is killed by a racist ex-soldier, because Samuels was Jewish.  Robert Young plays detective Finlay, who is in charge of the case.  Finlay has trouble figuring out what happened, because there doesn't seem to be a motive, and the suspects left to tell the tale had been drunk when the crime took place.

The film is the obvious product of talent.  The acting and direction are spot-on.  The visuals should please most noir enthusiasts.  The story is well written.  Be warned though, Gloria Grahame's role, even though she appears prominently on the DVD case, is a small one.  And some may find a scene near the end where Young discusses why 'bigotry must be fought' a little too obviously didactic.  And yet, the fact remains, the filmmakers were very much in earnest, as that movie's director and producer, Edward Dmytryk and Adrian Scott, soon found themselves caught in their own 'crossfire' as members of the infamous Hollywood 10.

Interestingly, snippets of an Edward Dmytryk audio interview are interspersed throughout the DVD's fine James Ursini and Alain Silver commentary.  Though discontinued, the disc can still be found in the 'Film Noir Classic Collection, Vol. 2'.",1272844800,,1421,4.949367088607595

There were 2 Academy Award nominations for best supporting roles given to members of the cast. Robert Ryan, as the brutish anti-Semite murderer and Gloria Grahame, as the party girl who won't give an alibi for an innocent soldier, both received nods for their performances in this film.

This movie shows another side of film noir.  Hatred.  There are no sexual or monetary motives for our crimes, only Antisemitism.  The plot is a foray into the crime and a Sergeant's (Robert Mitchum) attempt to help a GI (George Cooper) being framed for the murders.  Robert Young takes the role of Captain Finlay, an aloof and moralizing policeman.  Sam Levine plays the victim.

This noir gets an extra star for the outstanding performances from the cast and in particular, Ryan and Grahame.

809513,4,6304212151,"This film was released the same year as the much touted ""Gentleman's Agreement"" with Gregory Peck which also dealt with anti-semitism. But this film is the superior of the two because it features an Oscar nominated performance by the under-rated Robert Ryan as the vicious bigoted soldier. He is superb in that role but it also typecasted him almost forever as the villain you'd love to hate--a nasty, sneering bigot versus the few heroic roles that he had (""The Proud Ones"", ""The Wild Bunch"", ""The Set-Up"").  The other 2 Roberts, Young & Mitchum, are also good but they're outclassed by Ryan's vicious Montgomery.  Though the original victim of the hate crime was homosexual this doesn't change the theme of the film which is how intolerance can become like a loaded gun. Edward Dmytryk would never direct a film with this so much power again since he and writer, Adrian Scott, would be black-listed and imprisoned. Outside of the landmark Western, ""Warlock"", the director's authority and drive would be diminished by lesser features though he did direct ""The Caine Mutiny"" and ""Broken Lance"".",1217030400,,1094,5.0054945054945055

809515,5,6304212151,"Crossfire remains one of the best Hollywood message movies because, unlike the admirably intentioned Gentleman's Agreement, which it beat to theatres by a few months, it chooses to send its message via the form an excellent noir thriller rather than have an outraged star constantly saying ""It's because I'm Jewish, isn't it?"" It's much easier to get the message that hate is like a loaded gun across when the dead bodies are actual rather than metaphorical. Somewhat shamefully, the brief featurette on the Warners' DVD doesn't mention that novelist Richard Brooks disowned the film over the shift from a homophobic murder to an anti-Semitic one, but it's interesting to note that while the victim is killed primarily because he is Jewish, there's little doubt in Sam Levene's performance that the character is in fact also gay - not a mincing caricature, but there's definitely a two lost souls aspect to his scenes with George Cooper's confused soldier. There's not much of a mystery to who the murderer is: even though the killing is carried out in classic noir shadows, the body language of the killer is instantly recognisable, but then the film has its characters drift to the same conclusion before the halfway point: the tension comes from proving it and saving the fall guy.

There's an element of Ealing Films to the gang of soldiers teaming together to get their buddy out of a fix (you could almost see that aspect as a blueprint for Hue and Cry), but the atmosphere is pure RKO noir. Set over one long sweltering night, the film has a great look filled with deep dark blacks and shadows born as much out of economy as style (it cut back on lighting time and allowed director Edward Dmytryk more time to work with the actors) and the excellent cast make the most of the fine script: a laid-back but quietly charismatic Robert Mitchum, Robert Young's Maigret-like detective, Gloria Grahame's tramp and the perpetually creepy Paul Kelly as her compulsive liar admirer, a guy who tries on stories the way other people try on ties. But the lasting impression is of Robert Ryan's excellent performance as a guy who could do with a good leaving alone as he does his best to help the wrongly accused man all the way to death row. A big surprise hit in 1946, as a reward, Dmytryk and producer Adrian Scott found themselves investigated by the HUAC, which itself had a notable tendency to target Jews. So much for crusading...

Warners' DVD boasts a good transfer despite some print damage at one point, a brief retrospective featurette on the film and an audio commentary by Alain Silver and James Ursini that (like the featurette) includes excerpts from an interview with Edward Dmytryk.",1182038400,2,2693,4.814254859611231

Robert Young - playing the effective police detective - turns in as fine of a performance as you could ask for.  Robert Mitchum does well, but he isn't the movie.  Instead, the movie is a sum of all its characters, founded in its message in post-war America.  Before it was fashionable to go after the mongers of hate, RKO bravely put out a film that did just that.  The film keeps you guessing about who the murderer is for most of its length.  And the dialogue is well written.  For example, Robert Young as the detective explains to Robert Mitchum why it took him so long to figure out who the murderer was.  He goes on to say that he was looking for folks with all the obvious motives to kill, but that, when he looked past that, the murderer's identity become obvious.

809568,5,6304212151,"Completed in only about 20 days of shooting, 1947's ""Crossfire"" was one of Hollywood's first attempts to make a movie focusing on anti-Semitism. Directed by Edward Dmytryk (Murder My Sweet, Cornered, The Sniper), it was filmed on a very low budget yet featured an amazing cast: Robert Young, Robert Ryan, Robert Mitchum, Gloria Grahame, Paul Kelly, Sam Levene, and Steve Brodie. To everyone's surprise, the movie (released shortly before the similarly-themed Gentlemen's Agreement) was a big hit and was nominated for five Academy Awards including best picture.

Joseph Samuels, a Jewish veteran who had survived World War Two has just been murdered, and the police are baffled. Captain Finlay (Robert Young) interrogates the last two people who saw him alive, Mitchell (George Cooper) and Montgomery (Robert Ryan). They are also veterans, but only Montgomery seems to have an alibi for the night of Joseph's murder, and Mitchell was too drunk that night to remember what really happened. Knowing that he's the police department's prime suspect in the case, Mitchell hides from the cops. Meanwhile, Mitchell's friend Sgt. Peter Keeley (Robert Mitchum) tries to help the police find the real killer, while clearing Mitchell.

As Finlay's investigation progresses, he learns that Montgomery was the only one who had any reason to kill Joseph. The motive: a burning hatred of all Jews. Also, the police find out that Mitchell was at Ginny Tremaine's (Gloria Grahame) apartment while the murder took place. But proving that Montgomery was the murderer will be very difficult, because Montgomery has a ready answer prepared for just about any question the police can ask him. Eventually, the police use Montgomery's own friend Floyd Bowers (Steve Brodie) to try to trick Montgomery into revealing himself as the killer.

Despite some badly dated scenes of Robert Young ""preaching"" about racism, ""Crossfire"" is a terrific film noir with an excellent cast and stylish, shadowy lighting that creates a very dark atmosphere for a story of hatred and murder. Gloria Grahame, who played a sexy nightclub girl (it is implied that she's also a prostitute), was nominated for a best supporting actress oscar for her brief but very memorable performance. And aside from Robert Ryan's outstanding and chilling portrayal of a racist killer, the second most interesting character IMO was Paul Kelly, who played Gloria Grahame's pimp (for lack of a better word).

The picture and sound quality of the Warner DVD of ""Crossfire"" is very satisfactory. Bonus features include commentary by film noir historians Alain Silver and James Ursini (which includes audio interview excerpts of director Edward Dmytryk), and a brief documentary ""Crossfire: Hate is Like a Gun,"" which explains how difficult it was to get the movie made, and how the director had his career almost ruined by the communist ""witch hunt"" of the late 1940's that resulted in many people in Hollywood being wrongfully blacklisted. One minor error I noticed in the commentary: they state that ""Crossfire"" was Robert Young's only film noir credit. Actually, he made two other noir films: ""They Won't Believe Me"" and ""The Second Woman."" Other than that error, though, the commentary was very interesting. ""Crossfire"" is a wonderful example of how many late 1940's noir films had strong messages concerning social and moral issues. This dvd is a must-have for any film noir buff!",1132531200,7,3419,5.210909090909091
809569,5,6304212151,"The first big movie to deal directly with anti-Semitism - it beat ""Gentleman's Agreement"" to the screen by a couple of months - CROSSFIRE brackets its message of tolerance with a brace of murders.  The movie opens and closes with scenes of freshly minted corpses, the first one sparks the narrative, the second neutralizes evil.

 All of which is accomplished in deep shadows on cheap sets.  There's a short, 9-minute featurette bundled on the dvd entitled ""Hate is like a gun."" (DON'T watch it before you watch the movie for the first time; it gives away most of the major plot points.)  The featurette contains archive footage of director Edward Dmytryk discussing CROSSFIRE.  Made on a limited budget for RKO, Dmytryk recounts how he wanted to flip-flop the normal economics of a movie, so he decided to spend the bulk of the budget on actors and proportionately less on lighting, sets, etc.  I was tempted to write `at the expense of...' but the shadowy, seedy look serves the movie admirably.  The three Bobs this approach allowed Dmytryk to afford - Young, Mitchum, and Ryan - would have been more than worth the sacrifice, though.

  Sam Levene plays Joseph Samuels who will be brutally beaten to death simply because, the movie will soon explain, he was Jewish.  Samuels was last seen at a hotel bar, drinking with a group of soldiers who are about to be mustered out.  He invites a lonely, despondent and seemingly disoriented soldier - George Cooper as Cpl. Arthur Mitchell - to his room.  They're joined by a couple of other soldiers, including characters played by Steve Brodie and Robert Ryan , and before the night is through Samuels will be dead and Cpl. Mitchell will be missing and eagerly sought by police Captain Finlay (Robert Young) in connection with the murder.

 Although it's nowhere near as preachy as `Gentleman's Agreement,' CROSSFIRE does carry a strong message of religious and societal tolerance that comes across as heavy-handed today.  In their informed commentary track, Alain Silver and James Ursini rightly observe that this movie's message had to be sold to its audience, while we accept it as a given today.  Enough already with your folks coming over from Ireland, Capt. Finlay!  More `subversive,' to their view, is the non-judgmental attitude CROSSFIRE takes toward the b-girl (played to Academy Award nominee perfection by Gloria Grahame,) Cpl. Mitchell befriends and may provide an alibi for him when the police and - gasp! - his wife close in.

  The `message' didn't make me realize that anti-Semitism is evil, that in some places it's pervasive, or that it's something that needs to be fought.  Young's delivering-the-message scenes were, therefore, a little lost on me, although I found them interesting in a historical sense.  And even though Robert Mitchum was a tad wasted - more a bystander than a central character - Ryan, Young, and Grahame more than compensated with their powerful characterizations.  Strongest recommendation for this great crime thriller.",1131235200,16,3011,5.010060362173038
809570,4,6304212151,"Despite the great noir visuals, a good (if somewhat over-the-top) performance by Robert Ryan as the villain (you can tell his character is guilty right away) and the always welcome presence of sultry femme fatale Gloria Grahame, I think that ""Crossfire"" hasn't dated as well as other film noirs.  ""Crossfire"" is really two films in one.  First, the film is a murder mystery in which the crime turns out to have been motivated by anti-Semitism. This is the part that hasn't aged well, especially the customary (for a classic Hollywood film) educational speech delivered by a white actor (Robert Young) in a father figure role. Secondly, the film is about the difficulties faced by soldiers and their wives as they try to get back together in postwar America.  There are two couples that face this problem, and this is the part of the film that is still interesting nowadays.  In the original version of the story, the crime was motivated by homophobia and not anti-Semitism, which makes a lot more sense when trying to understand the relationship between the murder mystery and the domestic problems of the two couples.  The cast of ""Crossfire"" is uniformly good.  Robert Ryan, Gloria Graham and Paul Kelly are particularly memorable, but Robert Young and especially Robert Mitchum could have played their parts in their sleep.",1127865600,4,1326,4.97737556561086
809571,3,6304212151,"This review is for the 2005 Warner Brothers DVD.

The story opens with a man who was beaten to death in a fistfight in his apartment.  The police show up headed by Captain Finley (Robert Young) and begin to unravel the mystery of who killed this person.  A small group of military men, including Robert Mitchum and Robert Ryan, are linked directly or indirectly to the crime scene and now Finley has to sort out who are the suspects and who is innocent.  After interviewing the suspects, Finley  believes he's found the motive and the murderer.

I would classify this movie as a mystery, and it slowly meanders in several different directions with very little drama until the very end.  The story has one major merit because it confronts a serious social problem, but the execution of the plot, including the knowing exactly what happened as the murder unfolded, plus the weak, flawed and even disturbing police work raises more questions than answers.  Without revealing too much more, the police did get the right man, but how they went about it was very unconvincing for me.  I'll give this film a qualified recommendation simply because it is decades ahead of its time in social awareness of a serious problem, but if you are looking for an action packed, well-written noir crime movie, you'll probably be disappointed.

The DVD quality is decent.  The film was not restored, but did show short segments of negative wear once in a while, but nothing too distracting from the overall presentation.  The sound is fine too.

PLEASE NOTE:  Before buying this DVD, consider buying the Film Noir Classic Collection, Vol. 2 which contains this movie plus four other highly recommended movies at a very reasonable price.

809572,4,6304212151,"""Crossfire"" was considered a risky film when it was released in 1947. It was a relatively rare 1940s example of ""social conscious"" filmmaking that had largely gone out of style after the 1930s. And the film addressed the subject of bigotry in America, which was still considered taboo in some quarters -or at least box office poison. ""Crossfire"" was adapted from the novel ""The Brick Foxhole"" by Richard Brooks, which concerned a gay Marine who was beaten to death by his fellow soldiers. The Production Code did not allow homosexuality to be discussed openly in films, so screenwriter John Paxton made the victim Jewish instead, and ""Crossfire"" became a statement against lingering anti-Jewish sentiment in America and a denunciation of bigotry in general. The message was couched in a stylish murder mystery/detective story, and ""Crossfire"" achieved both critical and commercial success, including 5 Academy Award nominations.

As the film opens, Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene) has been beaten to death, and Police Captain Finlay (Robert Young) is trying to piece together the events that led to his murder. Four army buddies on leave -Mitchell, Montgomery, Floyd,and Leroy- went out drinking. They met Samuels and his girlfriend in a bar. Mitchell was feeling homesick and had drank too much. A sympathetic Samuels invited him to dinner. They preceded to Samuels' apartment, followed by Montgomery and Floyd. Samuels ends up dead. Mitchell's wallet is found at the scene, and he is missing. Finlay seeks out Sergeant Keeley (Robert Mitchum), who knew the men, for help with the investigation. Keeley tries to protect Mitchell, while Montgomery (Robert Ryan) implicates him. But what possible motive could any of these men have to kill a man whom they'd only just met?

We have a pretty good idea of who committed the murder early on in ""Crossfire"". The mystery is the motive. And that is where the film's message is found. But this isn't sophisticated writing. The characters are 2-dimensional and seem to exist only to service the theme. And the theme is a little weak. It undermines itself by assuring the audience that Samuels embodied none of the stereotypes that his assailant had assumed of him. But what if Samuels had conformed to a stereotype or two? Would it be ok to bludgeon him? ""Crossfire"" is sometimes presented as the sole example of a ""film noir"" social conscious picture and as proof that such an animal could exist. I find this curious because I don't see anything but the most superficial qualities of film noir in ""Crossfire"". Director Edward Dmytryk made use of low-key lighting because it was cheap and disguised his low-budget sets. This is a crime film. I suppose it's an introverted film, but that just makes it characteristic of the era. In any case, this is an example of overtly ""social conscious"" filmmaking in the 1940s. The mystery cleverly relates directly to the film's anti-bigotry theme and keeps the audience engaged. ""Crossfire"" is entertaining but uncomplicated.

The DVD (Warner 2005): Bonus features include a documentary and an audio commentary. ""Crossfire: Hate is Like a Gun"" (9 minutes) talks about making a ""message picture"" during the Communist witchhunt of the late 1940s. It includes an interview with director Edward Dmytryk in which he talks about shooting the film in 20 days on a low budget and the resulting visual style. The audio commentary features film noir theorists and authors Alain Silver and James Ursini as well as archival commentary from Edward Dmytryk. Silver and Ursini discuss the film's style, characters, themes, and director. Dmytryk talks about the political climate in Hollywood at the time, the House Un-American Activities Committee, being one of the ""Hollywood Ten"", and his own experience with blacklisting. He does not, however, discuss his decision to ""name names"" to HUAC after spending some time in prison for contempt of Congress. Nevertheless, Dmytryk's commentary will interest anyone studying HUAC and Hollywood. Subtitles for the film are available in English, French, and Spanish.",1121817600,3,4068,5.16060606060606
809573,5,6304212151,"Ostensibly ""Crossfire"" is a police procedural about finding the murderer of a kindly Jewish man in post World War II Washington D.C.  On that count I thought the film telegraphed the murderer a little early but that is beside the point because the story here is so intricately textured that there are many riches to be found.  The film touches on not only irrational bigotry that leads to murder but also portrays a country and yes a military in a malaise following the end of our 4 year campaign to free the world of tyranny.  We now have peace and the question arises as to where to devote our energies.  It's in this climate where after we saved some Jews from Nazi extermination only to direct our hostilities toward the Jews at home.  The film is starkly lit and filmed by director Edward Dmytryk to maximum effect.  The cast is superb with Robert Young, Robert Mitchum, Robert Ryan, and Gloria Grahame giving some of the best, in some cases the best, performances of their careers.  This film was nominated for best picture in 1947 losing to ""Gentlemen's Agreement"" another film touching on domestic Anti-Semitism.  I recommend seeing both films but in my mind ""Crossfire"" is clearly the superior film.",1121126400,4,1208,4.746411483253588

Director Edward Dmytryk's stark, hard-hitting examination of a hate crime was way ahead of its time in 1947, and has lost neither its topicality nor its punch in the years since.  Based on a Richard Brooks novel (""The Brick Foxhole"") about the senseless murder of a gay man, the script dropped the book's sub-theme of homophobia to focus on the more cinematically ""acceptable"" topic of anti-Semitism.  Despite this concession to the Production Code, what emerged was a mature, pungent indictment of all crimes motivated by discrimination and blind hated that was nominated for five Oscars: Best Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Supporting Actor (Robert Ryan), and Supporting Actress (Gloria Grahame).  Also deserving award consideration were  top-billed Robert Young (arguably giving the best performance of his decades-long career as a taciturn police detective) and supporting actor Robert Mitchum, as well as J. Roy Hunt's masterful black and white cinematography.

The Warner Brothers DVD release of this classic film noir is, in all honesty, a major  disappointment, mainly because the film-to-video transfer is not up to their usual high standard of quality.  There is very distracting jump in one of the earlier scenes, apparently caused by a break in the film which was subsequently spliced together by an amateur; one or two scenes are unacceptably grainy; and there is a flurry of horizontal visual ""snow"" toward the end of the movie.  Surely such a key title deserved a little restorative work before being transferred to DVD!  (That's a statement, not a question.)  Furthermore, the DVD does not include a Theatrical Trailer; however, it does contain a very informative snippet from an interview shown on TCM featuring director Dmytryk reminiscing about the film's production.  There is also an audio commentary by film noir authorities James Ursini and Alain Silver.  Overall, despite the inadequacies in the master print, ""Crossfire"" remains a must-see film, and therefore this DVD edition is definitely recommended.",1120780800,5,2085,5.411764705882353
7864746,5,6304212151,"I bought this socially conscious crime thriller based on the packaging and the actors. I had never heard of it, and thats a crying shame because this film deserves a wide audience, even today.  It should be re-made with a more contemporary script because its message, regarding anti-Semitism and prejudice is more relevant than ever.

Crossfire was adapted from the Richard Brooks novel The Brick Foxhole, in which the murder concerns a homosexual, whereas the film dropped the book's sub-theme of homophobia to focus on the more cinematically ""acceptable"" topic of anti-Semitism. That being said, I am surprised the original idea hasn't been filmed in the post-censorship era.

I love the way the murder is filmed in shadows and thus the audience is in the dark as to the identity of the murderer until the climax. Although the killers body language is instantly recognizable and the film has its characters drift to the same conclusion before the halfway point, the tension comes from proving it and saving the polices initial target, an innocent soldier.

I could not imagine a better cast for the topic. I love Gloria Grahame in every noir shes been in, Mitchum is his usual laconic best, and Robert Young is the epitome of trustworthiness. Its tough seeing Robert Ryan, who I like in heroic roles, as the bigoted villain in this film.

Crossfire didn't win any of the 5 Academy Awards for which it was nominated, which is a shame. Even though the similar Gentlemens Agreement won Best Picture, Crossfire is superior due to its operating on two levels: an excellent murder mystery manhunt and a message picture.
The shadowy atmosphere is RKO noir at its best, but that cant also be said for the Warner Bros DVD version I viewed. It isn't terrible, but this classic deserves a little restorative help.

Also, the DVD does not include a Theatrical Trailer; however, it does contain a very informative snippet from an interview shown on TCM featuring director Dmytryk reminiscing about the film's production. There is also an audio commentary by film noir authorities James Ursini and Alain Silver. Overall, despite minor issues, Crossfire remains a must-see film, and therefore this DVD edition is definitely recommended.

7864750,4,6304212151,"""Crossfire"" was directed by Edward Dmytryk (""Murder My Sweet""), and it is remarkable in that it depicts GI's returning from WWII as a group that is kind of in limbo--- uncertain about jobs, beliefs, and the future.

It has an interesting opening sequence, in which a fatal attack is portrayed by shadows of the men fighting, projected by a lamp against an apartment wall.  The lamp falls, and the scene goes black.

Robert Young plays Finley, the Washington, D.C. police captain investigating the murder.  He smokes a pipe during many of his scenes, which gives him a cerebral air, and he becomes the voice of the film's message explaining prejudice.

The soldiers are depicted as uprooted people trying to re-connect with civilian life.  Robert Mitchum (""Keeley"") represents the ""older brother"" type, a GI that the others look up to.  He was formerly a newspaperman.  ""Mitchell"" (George Cooper) becomes a suspect, and is described as a ""sensitive guy"", an artist in previous life.  ""Leroy""  (William Phipps) is from the South, and is described as a ""dumb hillbilly"".  ""Montgomery"" (Robert Ryan) is a volatile drinker, a superpatriot who openly disparages civilians.

Will the wrong person be fingered for the crime?  Mitchum as ""Keeley"" becomes an ally of Finley, and together with ""Leroy"" as a key go-between, helps to expose the killer.

Finley wraps up the case while relating the story of his grandfather, an Irish immigrant who suffered from the attitudes of people who  considered him a ""foreigner trying to rob men of jobs"".

Robert Young, as always, seems a little mild in his portrayal of the bearer of wisdom and stability.... but his performance is more than offset by Robert Ryan, who effectively portrays an unstable man infected with bigotry.

Altogether, it's an interesting film that still carries a timely message.",1502064000,,1832,5.053333333333334

7864753,5,6304212151,"""Ignorant men always laugh at things that are different,"" observes mild-mannered homicide detective Capt. Finlay as he regales a weak-willed soldier with an ominous family yarn. See, the detective is trying to make a point. He's trying to talk the weak-willed soldier into playing along with a ruse to catch a killer, a colleague of the weak-willed soldier's. RKO's 1947 film noir, Crossfire, is about a hate crime that lurks within a murder mystery. It's based on Richard Brook's first novel, The Brick Foxhole, penned when he was still in the Marines. One of the book's key plot elements was so controversial - that of hom0phobia - that the Hays Code - a.k.a. Hollywood's morality police - wanted no part of it. So, h0m0phobia was swapped for anti-Semitism.

This grim story situates itself within the G.I. community not too long after World War II, triggered by the murder of a Jewish man (Sam Levene). In sifting thru possible suspects, Capt. Finlay (Robert Young) gives the particular side eye to Sgt. Montgomery (Robert Ryan), two weeks demobilized from the Signal Corps Detachment. And it's real easy to target Sgt. Montgomery as whodunit, him with his casual bigotry, his sly, sneery putdowns. Ryan craved this role from jump. He landed it and tore into it with gusto, layering in a festering malice beneath an affable surface. For his show of despicability and straight-up menace, he nabbed his only Oscar nomination.

And he's not the only one. Film noir siren Gloria Grahame's brazen, cynical barfly was memorable enough that it earned her the first of her two Supporting Actress Oscar nominations (she'd lose this one, but win the second). Edward Dmytryk - whose ancestors have something against vowels - was also nominated for his fine directing.

It's the rare B-movie that snags consideration from the Academy Awards, and, probably, it was the hot button subject of anti-Semitism that turned Oscar's head. In its time, it was a gutsy move for Crossfire to broach this touchy material with such indelicate frankness. But you can't dismiss the admirable expertise with which cast and crew handled the other aspects of their film. It's a deftly executed crime drama, and Dmytryk works well within the film noir purview. He effortlessly establishes mood and a sense of claustrophobia. The acting is capital. Robert Mitchum is the take-no-guff sergeant whose job is to make the ink for purple hearts and who tries to set the record straight. Robert Young is even better as the pipe-smoking police detective who conducts his investigation with understated resolve and exceeding patience. Young shines specially in that one scene in which he eloquently makes his case for that one reluctant soldier to help him expose a racist murderer. Lex Barker - no loincloth in sight - has a bit role as one of the grunts whose misguided loyalty towards an implicated fellow G.I. hampers the police investigation. Paul Kelly, dishonorably discharged soldier and disgruntled ex-husband to Grahame's hard-bit barfly, is also great in his two scenes. It's a very good cast of which riveting performances serve to flesh out and provide color to what, technically, is a pedestrian murder mystery. But, man, Robert Ryan is fantastic and so chilling in his intolerance. It's too bad that the more prestigious, similarly-themed Gentleman's Agreement came out the same year. Crossfire deserved as much shine.",1471737600,,3395,5.080645161290323
