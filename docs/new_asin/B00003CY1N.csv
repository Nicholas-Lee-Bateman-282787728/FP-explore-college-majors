His older brother (Matthew Rhys) is supposed to be the magician in the family, but its their father who turns out to be the real talent

Lulu plays their wayward mother though no one seems to realize just how wayward she is",1507593600,,304,4.315789473684211

7918104,5,B00003CY1N,"Really nice movie. if you grew up in the UK in the 70's (like I did) it will mean more to you.
Great cast. Great acting. Great soundtrack. Great Fun.",1292544000,,149,4.0
7918105,3,B00003CY1N,"I can't believe that a black comedy starring three great actors like
Courtenay, Thewlis and Fry)and two up and coming stars (the boy and girl at the heart of the story) and one of my old favorites, Lulu, who looks very sexy still and not much older than when she was in ""To Sir With Love"" can only have THREE reviews when it is ten years old. I found some moments in it boring. Some moments ugly. More moments of high enjoyment, and several of brilliance. A dull but decent working-class dad turns out to have super psychic powers, enough to levitate people and bend objects and stop watches and even pacemakers. This of course gets him into legal jeopardy, and into a media circus, and his fame, while re-attracting his straying wife, unhinges some of the people around him. The situation complicates his son's work and love life, and the home life of his son's desired girlfriend. Finally, the dad has to take a stand on his own gifts, and he does the right thing, at the expense of going back to being a nobody. I wish I had liked ALL the characters, set-ups and situations, but few films are indeed perfect. The flaws in this one are easily forgiven because of the cleverness of the best of it.",1275350400,,1198,4.45
7918106,4,B00003CY1N,"A great, great film. But why does the US version have a picture of London on it? This film is set in my home town, Sheffield, 200 miles north.",1218067200,,142,3.9310344827586206
7918107,5,B00003CY1N,"If you came of age in the period after 1975 till 1985, I think much of this film will be very special.  The thing that got me the most was the insecure yet exciting time in this character's life....but in ENGLAND!  I saw some reviews from Britain that hated this film, but those homey colors of the seventies come alive... the impact of Saturday Night Fever, all of so many things that I experienced so raw, so similar in my life!  I just never thought those same things were hitting England at the same time!  Somehow I just thought our two societies would be skewed and not as similar as they were.  Just an excellent movie. Like the movie, I 'caught' the FEVER... our cars were all fuel economy hatchbacks.. and before it was all over I renounced publicly the fever for more riotous music (yet kept secretly the love of it as well). Forgive the fact I can't get it in writing, but the connection was pure. They nailed the times, the looks; everything from that wonderful era and to those who say this movie was a waste of time...""Sod Off!""  A beautiful little movie which captures a period in time just perfectly.  Thank you.
Most Sincerely,
ZR",1202774400,2,1147,4.45933014354067
7918108,5,B00003CY1N,"If you like British comedy, this is a film for you. You will smile laughing, rather than grimacing, as you watch intelligently drawn characters behave in believable ways in a completey riotous story. And Tom Courtenay, as a modern Stan Laurel, is show-stopping. Do not miss this. There is little true comedy these days, this is one. A gem, a quiet riot, an endless laugh out loud film. Buy it NOW!",998870400,7,397,4.605633802816901
