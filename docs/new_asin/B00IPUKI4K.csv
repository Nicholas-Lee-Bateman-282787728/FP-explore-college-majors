At a time when mindfulness is becoming more mainstream and people are looking for ways to feel more relaxed, this DVD is a great tool.  I play the music while working on my computer and it makes me feel more focused, calm and productive through the work day.  Highly recommend.",1421452800,,377,4.769230769230769
