Dennis Price is the perfect snob. Unfortunately, 3-4 minutes have been edited from the transfer and the sound is a bit out of sync. If you can live with these flaws, you should purchase it as there are no other options.",1259366400,3,390,4.666666666666667
8294227,2,B001DM3QMI,"This is a perfectly enjoyable (and so-far hard to find) little film, considered by some to be very much in character with the long-gone Ealing Comedies. I'm giving it 2-stars ... somewhere in between a 4 for the movie and 1 for the poor DVD transfer. It is ruined for me by the atrocious unrestored sound and picture quality of this transfer. The high price tag only adds insult to the injury. They've started out with a very poor print and have done nothing to improve it. The result is worse than we're used to seeing on most budget label low-speed VHS tapes. I'd recommend you buy a used DVD of this because it certainly isn't worth the asking price that Televista has placed on it. This one is so bad that in future I'll avoid any more of these Televista products until I see reviews that comment on the quality. They obviously can't be trusted to deliver a product that's in line with their asking prices.",1229644800,6,910,4.455089820359281
