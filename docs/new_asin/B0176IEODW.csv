7489561,1,B0176IEODW,"Boring, humor is prejudicial and racist, not really funny. I've seen many comedians that can weave all those subjects into their act, and still make it
seem funny.",1451260800,2,163,4.857142857142857
7489562,2,B0176IEODW,"Usually a fan of her humor but since her surgery & weight loss she seems to have replaced the weight with anger issues.  MUCH more mean spirited than her normal past specials and humor has been.  Less audience focused, too much ranting, not enough laughing.  Middle portion is the best, but she really needs to stop saying I am Lisa Lampanelli so often, 10 times in a 1 hour show?  ok she lost over 100 pounds but she seems to have picked up a 100 pound ego to go with it.  NOT her best work, and Im a HUGE fan of hers.",1451260800,2,519,4.049019607843137
7489563,5,B0176IEODW,Lisa is one funny lady! I'm thrilled this is on Amazon Prime.,1451174400,,61,4.166666666666667

7489567,2,B0176IEODW,"Same tired jokes but now she focuses on her weight loss.  Take your money, invest properly and drop the microphone; it's doing us all no good.",1450915200,2,142,4.461538461538462
7489568,4,B0176IEODW,"Classic Lisa Lampanelli. Not all her best stuff, but still damn good!",1450828800,,69,4.833333333333333
7489569,3,B0176IEODW,I expected not to like this standup but she actually was pretty funny in some stretches. I had only previously seen Lisa on those celebrity roasts and her brand of comedy is perfect for those. I thought it started off kind of slow but I found myself laughing consistently after the first couple minutes.  If you are easily offended or you are a pc crusader then you need to stay away because her brash style will rub you the wrong way.,1450483200,7,435,4.37037037037037
7489590,3,B0176IEODW,It was ok.  Not as funny as some of her other stuff.  Glad I didn't pay to see it live.,1484092800,,87,3.3

7489595,1,B0176IEODW,Glad she lost the weight--but wish she had gained some insight so that she didn't have to rely on the sophomoric jokes. There is so much else out there--too bad she couldn't find it.,1475020800,,182,4.382352941176471
7489596,3,B0176IEODW,"Lisa is a great insult comic, but at a certain point, the routine becomes a little old and repetitive.",1475020800,,102,4.421052631578948

7489613,5,B0176IEODW,"Another funny standup special from the Queen of Mean. She covers her divorce, weight loss, and of course lovingly offends just about every racial group on the planet. Nobody has humor quite like Lisa's.",1472169600,,202,4.970588235294118

7489649,5,B0176IEODW,Don't trust the ratings on this. This is hilarious. I think the prudes just down-rated because they lack a sense of humor. I almost didn't watch because of the ratings. Lisa is hilarious i laughed the whole time.,1469664000,,212,4.605263157894737

7489675,2,B0176IEODW,She was hilarious but her act is a bit tired.  Once the shock value wears off that she says every racial slur she can think of it gets pretty redundant.,1466035200,,152,4.066666666666666

7489688,5,B0176IEODW,"I looked at the reviews and thought it might be lame, even though I love her earlier work. It sounds childish but I'm always stand offish when entertainers I really like drastically change. I also don't find female comics as funny most of the time even though I'm female. That being said it's just as funny as her other stuff.",1465430400,2,326,4.45

7489728,1,B0176IEODW,"I thought she was funny back when she and Greg Geraldo were trading insults at the Comedy Central roasts. No longer. Her entire shtick seems to be trying to be as shockingly gross as possible-- that's it. No cleverness, no creativity, not even any real humor.  She seemed a lot funnier and happier before she lost all that weight; now she only comes across as angry, attempting to be vile as possible, and thoroughly unfunny.",1457654400,,425,4.666666666666667

But Lisa isn't funny.  She shocks, and nervous shock often results in laughter, but she is incredibly mean-spirited, and not particularly funny.  If she were to retire tomorrow, and my review were the cause, I'd consider that a win.  I don't think I'm that influential, but then again, I've forced a number of retailers to go ut of business by staying away in droves.

7490270,1,B0176IEODW,"ZERO Stars!
In the early/mid 2000's, I was a 3 Star fan of the then morbidly obese (fatso) Lisa Marie Lampugnale (real name) - Lampanelli, who ran thru  the Comedy Roast circuits before and garnered a modest following. But now her material Smells like Rotten Bacon, that has exceeded it's expiration dates, by a few years! There is nothing new in her latest less fatso transformation, it's become just a meaner Version of the SAME Ethnic humor, racial minority insults, slurs, and stereotypes that are the predominant corpus (no pun intended) of Lampanelli's so called ""comedy routines"".
Lampanelli is of Italian & Polish descent, how about she focus on some thought-provoking Ethnic humor, racial minority insults, slurs, and stereotypes THERE?
Or, she could add a modern humorous revision as to How the English (UK) refer to the Scott's and the Irish (England's liberal use of theN-word).
Because if you live in America, you have the Freedom to INSULT any Ethnic Group (Cornish, Italians, Jews, Polish, Albanians, Irish, Scot's, German's, Mexicans, French, Greek, etc, etc) or minorities, either in Public or from behind the Safety Glass of your vehicle or Home ... it's called Equal Opportunity, and if this happens to fall on your own family, or ethnicity; well just LOL! There You Go, that's the Spirit! How do you like me Now!
Lisa, is just NOT Funny anymore, so go try Jenny Craig or Weight Watchers for a night cap, maybe you can get new Fat material there.
Yes, I agree that you need to waddle back to the Drawing Board, Lisa, and Look into your own family for new material.
Verdict - New Humor 0 Stars - Weight Loss: 3 Stars.
Lisa Fatpannelli has joined other comedians that rely on feeding from the same Trough of racial insults, slurs and stereotypes. Why? because that's the easiest and laziest choice.
Personally, I don't have a need for that type of bovine scatology, as that is what my family is for! ... Res ipsa Loquitor, People!",1453507200,2,1947,4.811940298507463
