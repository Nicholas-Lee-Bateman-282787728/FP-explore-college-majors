8568655,5,B00BHO0NV4,If you haven't watched it by now...you probably never will. I'm just gonna say I'm happy it's on dvd. Yes it is a dvd-r but that's better then nothing. Received my copy today...woohoooo...The quality is good for what it is...if memory serves the movie was always a little grainy so it looks the way I remember. I had it on vhs and still do but my video isn't in the greatest shape so transferring it myself wasn't worth it. I'm disappointed they changed the cover art but not the end of the world. Definitely worth the $15. I don't imagine they will even have this available for very long through amazon so order your copy now before it goes out of print again. Love this movie!!!,1372636800,2,680,4.404761904761905
