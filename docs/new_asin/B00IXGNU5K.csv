6302940,5,B00IXGNU5K,"Well, I bought this on a whim. I was not familiar with the synopsis or the music but I couldn't pass up another cheap opera on BluRay. I'm so glad I forked over the $9.99 because not only was it fantastic but, getting it for a rock-bottom price only sweetened the deal.

Even though Elektra is only one act and the scenery never changes, between the wonderful singing/acting and the lighting and set design, I didn't mind at all. Strauss' music is dramatic and riveting as well and it always feels as if it has great momentum. The costumes and set are modern, obviously. But, it's done very tastefully. I'll admit it. I really can't stand ""Euro Trash"" opera and so I'm always a little worried when an opera is given a contemporary staging. However, when it is done well, it's always thrilling to see and experience.

Now, if you tend to like Verdi and Puccini mostly, this one might be out of your comfort zone. There's no romance here. But, if you are like me and you love opera, I encourage you to step outside the box and try something new because at less than ten bucks, what have you got to lose?",1412812800,13,1101,4.392156862745098
6302941,5,B00IXGNU5K,"First off, this was a brilliant production, it was updated to a WWII setting, but the good thing about that was its one of those rare contemporary updates that doesn't completely stray from the original intent, the characters were all there, its full of great singing and acting, as well as a powerful vocal duel between Irene and Waltraud during her confrontation scene. The music is conducted quite fast and gives the impression of a dark action movie, which works cuz it really sets the mood. The quality of the Bluray really helps with the detail and atmosphere. The costumes are great, Irene has quite a dishevled and crazy look about her in her black dress and tangled wig with cracked pale make up. Eva Maria's look as Chrysothemis works, she contrasts with Elektra in her maroon dress and A-line hair a simple yet effective costume. Waltraud Meier is one beautiful yet flamboyant Clytemnestra, and Eva Maria's costume seemed to mirror hers, as Waltraud is bedecked in a sparkling 40's style ball gown of dark pink, with a scarlet fur coat to boot. The rest of the costumes are great as well, the 5 maids are dressed in black cowls and tattered gowns that look like feathers, which works as they are seen creeping about the darkness of the palace. The Trainbearer and Confidante (who look like identical twins... and are very good despite their brief appearence) wear gray leather blazers, and tight 40's style skirts, with gray gloves and platforms, with the gelled curly hair and it works. Orestes and the tutor with him look awesome in their black leather outfits and rogue knots (hairstyle) and they look the type to be prowlers in the palace. All in all this production was very good and I highly recommend it! :D plus the bonus feature is pretty awesome, as well as the price! :D",1409184000,10,1792,4.710191082802548

That said, I really do prefer Rosenkavalier as music.  That's simply my taste in music.  The price was right, anyway, and I'll be listening to it again in the future to see if i can stretch my tastes a bit.",1432166400,,330,4.5423728813559325
6302958,4,B00IXGNU5K,"This performance has a wonderful cast, but the sets and costumes are dreary.  All the cast members give outstanding performances in an opera that is, admittedly, an acquired taste. This is notable for the acting, which is mesmerizing, especially Klytemnestra and Electra",1431388800,3,270,5.428571428571429

6302960,5,B00IXGNU5K,"For starters le me say that I am not a huge fan of some of Strauss' work specially this one. I bought this because the ""price was right"" and loved the cast. Well, this was a lot better than I thought!!. The production although it is modern and very minimalistic works great with this opera. The singers are top notch. Irene Theorin (I had seen her in the new La Scala Gotterdamerung with Barenboim cond.) is incredible. Perhaps not as powerful as Nilsson was in this role or maybe even Marton, but she is amazingly good vocally as well as dramatically. Waltraud Meier as Klytenemstra; what is not to like. She was her usual great self and I loved the interpretation as Klytenemstra as Gloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard! Rene Pape as Orestes is the cherry on the ice cream. Personally the weakest link in the performance was Eva-Marie Westbroek as Chryothemis, She was perfect vocally, I only wished they had given her a better hair do and something else to do instead of just running all over the place. The orchestra is amazing. The lush score comes through beautifully. The Blu-Ray quality is also top notch. But then again I have not seen any of the Arthaus Musik recordings disappoint in that respect.  Bottom line - great performance - great singing - AMAZING price!!",1428364800,8,1273,4.657777777777778
6302961,4,B00IXGNU5K,This is a dissonant expressionistic work recorded in exquisite HD digital sound.  If you are a Strauss / Von Hoffmanstal fan you cannot go wrong purchasing this performance.,1423353600,2,173,5.178571428571429
6302962,5,B00IXGNU5K,"Viewing this disk gave me the opportunity to see this opera for the first time...I am very familiar with Der Rosenkavalier which I love, but Elektra kind of scared me.. I thought it would be too modern and atonal for me....Well, it is sort atonal and much more into modernism than I am usually comfortable, but I was amazed at the intensity, and often times the great beauty of the writing. The final scene's intensity will make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. When compared to most of Strauss' other operas such as Der Rosenkavalier and Arabella,it presented Strauss to me in an entirely different light.

Never having seen the opera before, I have no basis of comparison with other performances, but all the principals seemed perfect for their roles; the stark modern and ""quirky"" costumes and single, angular stark set seemed very appropriate to the opera. The orchestra was superb and the Blu Ray picture and DTS Sound were equally fine.

At the current price of $7.49 the disk is a great bargain and anyone not familiar with the opera can see a great masterpiece at a great price.

I think I will now check out Salome or perhaps I MIGHT even venture into some Wagner.",1422662400,3,1185,4.606635071090047
6302963,1,B00IXGNU5K,"I couldn't access the subtitles on this disk.  I tried every button I could think on 2 differnt BD players but the options for both the subtitles and sound for matt never came up as available.

also very irritating is that there is a nice beautiful packet inside the case but it is it is not a libretto or performance history or anything informational. It's an extensive promotional catalog for other titles by this company - which I have now no intention of ever buying. However it, if you do want to know the synopsis of the plot you can look on the inside of the cover.  You can either read it through the blue cover or out and squint at it to look at it there. Of course, if you pull it out good luck getting it back in. Cheaply done cheaply done cheaply done.",1421366400,,764,4.219178082191781
8645991,3,B00IXGNU5K,"I do very much like the opera Elektra, have so since 1981 when I first bought the Bohm recording.  In fact I prefer all the heavy, serious repertoire and don't care at all for his Rosenkavalier, his Audrey Annie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Obnoxious/dp/B00B0D29TG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Obnoxious</a>, or in fact anything of his that's light or silly.  OK, that's where I'm coming from.

I am well aware Elektra was intended to be a modernist shocker in 1909.  Still, it doesn't need to be helped along by modern stage directors who always feel the need to include blood and nudity as a matter of course.  I do think the genius of Richard Strauss in his wild score conveys all the necessary weirdities thru music alone.

So I thought this Salzburg production was pretty good until the last scene when it showed the murdered corpses of Klytaemnestra and Aegisthus in a roomful of blood.  And I would just like to axe the following question:  if we were compelled to display a shocking murder scene, how about having the man hanging head down from the ceiling, tied up, with his ballsack exposed, and the woman dead on the floor, with her person covered?  No, it could never be that way.  It always has to be the woman hanging upside down with her breasts bare, and the man on the floor, covered.  I wish someone would explain that to me, not that I don't already know the answer.

I guess the good citizens of Salzburg consider it to be fine art, like Titian.  I do not.

But do you know what is strange, Europeans are always the ones lecturing Americans about human dignity, human rights, women's rights, oppression of women, etc.  And yet they are the ones, not the Americans, who can be counted on to continue making opera productions of this sort.

How about rather keeping the graphic stuff off stage, which is how the Greeks did it, and one may argue, Richard Strauss intended?  For example, it's a matter of record he did not want Salome to disrobe to her nethermost follicles, but that's how it's done nowadays--o the joy!

Well anyway, apart from all that, the opera is well-played and sung.  It's generally a period-neutral production, 20th century ratty clothes with grim makeup as should be under the circumstances.  The cast members bringing on flashlights does tend to spoil it as a story of ancient Greece, earlier than need be.

I am happy about subtitles.  They are noticeably better than most Blu-rays, which usually are tiny white letters with no borders, invisible against a white background.  These are a little larger white letters and they do have black borders.  I guess ArtHaus has been reading my complaints in this area, ha-ha :)

And if anyone is still having trouble accessing subtitles--they are selected from your option button on the remote, not directly from the screen menu.

And now a free review of San Francisco Opera's Elektra this week.
***
Watching and listening to the Salzburg Blu-ray at home, on my shabby 20-year-old equipment (actually very decent, but by no means the latest or greatest) ... was more satisfying overall than fighting traffic and going up to San Francisco Opera last Friday night.  They had a huge orchestra in the pit, I am guessing about 80 players--I was wondering how they could play at all without elbowing each other.  Anyway, the orchestra sounded fabulous.  The singers however were miked, and the sound system in there is not up to making it sound natural to have singers amplified over the huge orchestra.  So you have the orchestra with beautiful, natural sound, and the singers coming over it like the sound from a set of bullhorns.

Of course, I am aware that (supposedly) nothing can be done about this;  Strauss requires the huge orchestra, and even in the landmark 1958(?) studio recording by Karl Bohm, who had worked personally with Richard Strauss, Bohm states that at last, the microphone has solved the problem of balance!

OK so why then does the Bohm recording, and Solti, and this Blu-ray all sound natural on my shabby home equipment, and yet the SFO sounds like a huge natural orchestra accompanied by singers on bullhorn?

Setwise, I also like the Salzburg production better than SFO.  They are both set in modern-day.  The Salzburg in possibly a ruined castle or bunker;  the SFO stated to be within an antiquities museum, after hours.  That was a bit too cutesy.

How about gore and nudity.  SFO showed both murders on stage.  The mother was decapitated (on stage), and her lover was axed whether he liked it or not.  There was no nudity.

Another thing I didn't like about SFO was some of the action took place on a video screen far backstage near the ceiling.  And where I was sitting, 2nd row of LOWER balcony, hardly any of it could be seen.  For this reason they had entirely closed off the upper balcony, but even in the lower balcony, it couldn't be seen.

So ... it was kind of a bust, and I could have just stayed home and enjoyed the Salzburg Blu-ray for both sight and sound.",1505174400,,5031,4.777520278099653
8645992,1,B00IXGNU5K,"The acting and singing seem superb to me....but the opera itself....the ""music""..........the lack of any melodies.....the sad story.....the ""screeching"" by the main character who has a lovely voice and fine acting.... but is too much ""on stage"" and began to get on my nerves with her long orations in a high soprano voice........it's the lack of melody and the story itself that turned me off.....and ""too much soprano"" also.  STAY AWAY UNLESS YOU ARE LIKE ME AND WANT TO MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND.  The DVD does have positives...but not enough for me to enjoy the  piece.  The accompanying short exerpts from other operas from the same company were interesting...maybe worth the $10 cost alone

As for the necessary English subtitles....they didn't appear immediately....but after ""playing"" with the buttons on my Blu Ray Player remote....they finally appeared....English, Spanish, French and several more.  Just keep trying and they should turn up...because they ARE there someplace!",1495238400,,981,5.337662337662338

8645997,5,B00IXGNU5K,"A daughter yearns to avenge the murder of her father, her sister just wants to have a life, and her brother comes back after a long absence to kill the murderer and his wife -- who just so happens to be the mother of the three siblings.  Not exactly the most appealing and attractive plot. Richard Strauss has taken this story, which has evolved from a play by Sophocles to a drama and libretto by von Hofmannsthal, and composed a thrilling and captivating opera.  He paints each psychological portrait with his music, almost 90 minutes of buildup to the sonic explosion of vengeance achieved.
The staging suggests a WWII period, with modern geometrical forms against a gray and somber background.  Since this opera is all about the music, the set design does not disturb the essence of the opera.  In fact, for most of the performance, the images are close ups of the singers/actors who illustrate the psychological drama,  not only with the music, but with their superb acting.  In addition, Lehnhoff, the stage designer, uses sidellighting to cast interesting shadows, creating very interesting full stage image compositions.
I was impressed with Rene Papes stage entrance as Orest (not surprisingly, though) and Irene Thearins Orest aria.  It is the first time she smiles in the performance.
Strauss composed Elektra for an unusually big orchestra, one with a wide range of sonic effects - in particular the vengeance climax and the subsequent dance.  This recording (BluRay) renders a full spectrum of the sound, a real treat!
Last but not least, the selling price of this BluRay is unbeatable.  I wish other operas on BluRay would be in this range.",1452988800,,1654,4.920863309352518
