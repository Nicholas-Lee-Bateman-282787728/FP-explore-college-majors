7795238,2,0983789290,"A little disappointed with this purchase--- it is basically 2 Sophia Yin seminars talking about the science of dog training.  I'll admit I slept through half of it.  I really like Dr. Yin's work overall, but I didn't feel that this video offered any new knowledge about the science of training dogs.",1404345600,6,299,4.730769230769231
7795239,4,0983789290,"I bought the video for helping me deal with performance issues I was having with my dogs. It is very good to lend to pet dog clients, but too basic for what I was intending to use it for. For focus work and also for general over excitable dogs it is good though.",1398470400,9,262,3.9622641509433962
7795240,5,0983789290,"As always Dr. Sophia Yin gets right to the point with lots of examples, videos and practical exericses that anyone can use.",1395360000,7,123,4.636363636363637
7795241,5,0983789290,"Animal training is explained scientifically and demonstrated in video clips. The clips showing how quickly chickens can be trained with a clicker, really inspired me.",1393718400,7,166,5.68
7795242,5,0983789290,Very good exceeded my expectations. I would recommend this for a trainer or any one who wants to work with their dog,1390176000,4,116,4.318181818181818
