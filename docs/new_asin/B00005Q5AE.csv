8107767,5,B00005Q5AE,"This DVD was a beautiful blast from the past! It was Westlife's first tour, but their excellence radiated through out their performances! These Irish lads are so funny and fans get to see former member, Bryan McFadden at his quirkiest! There are a lot of behind the scenes parts of the DVD which were highly enjoyable, the costumes scream early 2000's - it was just a pleasure to watch!

Songs that are overlooked on other tours like, ""Seasons of the sun"" and ""I Lay my love on you"" are covered very well. This DVD is a definate collectable for true westlife fans!",1277856000,,564,4.529411764705882
8107768,5,B00005Q5AE,"This is the very first westlife tour dvd live in dublin. I didn't think it would be great as the other live dvds, but like always westlife will prove you wrong. I love this dvd, and I got to say it is worth buying if you are a westlife fan no matter what country you are from. I am from the united states and have been a westlife fan for 7 years now they have changed my life, and changed the way I feel about the music industry. Westlife were 5, but now 4. If you have any questions about this dvd feel free to ask.",1250208000,,516,3.8773584905660377
8107769,5,B00005Q5AE,"I have recently bought most of the other westlife dvds and this is my favourite out of all the westlife dvds i have. It is very entertaning and funny I realy enjoy watching it. It was one of the concerts on their first tour. It is very diffrent from their latsest dvds the stage set up, the costume and the dance moves are much more extavagant. So if your looking for a good westlife dvd do buy this dvd. I no i love waching it so if your a westlife fan you will to.",1232496000,4,466,3.9680851063829787
8107770,1,B00005Q5AE,"I had previously purchased all the other available Weastlife DVDs and was thrilled with the results.  I ordered this DVD especially because the concert featured songs from their earlier albums which tend to get less coverage on other concert footage.  This was their first DVD attempt & boy does it show!  The concert itself is a bit cheesy, but the most disappointing thing for me was that Mark had terrible pitch problems throughout.  He hardly ever sang in tune having particular trouble with all the high notes.  If you want to see Westlife in concert and enjoy it don't buy this DVD.  However, Coast To Coast (for great unplugged performances), The Number Ones Tour and Westlife Live at Wembley especially, are much better investments.  You can really see how much the boys have matured and have much more stage presence and confidence in these DVD performances compared to the amateur quality of Where Dreams Come True.",1178496000,10,925,4.891025641025641
