7934366,5,B000059XU8,"First of all, ""Lost Paradise"" is a great movie, both for Koji Yakusho fans and readers of the original novel.
Make sure you don't get the bootleg edition. As far as I know, there's no legitimate Region 1/US release of this movie.
If you want great picture quality, extras, and good & accurate English subtitles, then get the recent Japanese DVD edition.
Yes, you'll need a region free DVD/Bluray player, but it'll be worth it.",1454457600,,426,4.693333333333333
7934367,5,B000059XU8,"I've watched this movie three times and learn from it each and every time. It is difficult for a Westerner, more so, a Frenchman such as myself not to wonder why the film cannot have a more happy ending. Though married, and wanting to be with each other, one would think that it would be easy to begin afresh, start a new life, far from what we assume is Tokyo, either in Hokkaido or Okinawa, Japan's extremes, or another place with a large Japanese minority such as Hawaii, Guam or Saipan. Instead they choose suicide as way to be ""together forever"", suicide as it is well documented, being extremely common in Japan, the number being in the neighborhood of 32,000 people, more so then traffic deaths, averaging one every 45 minutes somewhere in the country. The scenes are typical though and reflect the society well. The wife suspects something and consequently asks for a divorce. No shouting, banging on the table, broken glasses; calm resignation to the facts at hand. The other lady, also married, comes homes to a husband who has hired a detective, and just tells her that he knows everything, even her lover's name, but that he will not give her the satisfaction of a divorce, that she is still his wife. She replies as he goes upstairs by asking him if has anything for the washing machine. Good film overall, odd editing at times, but an interesting reflection and comment on extramarital affairs involving love in Japan.",1316736000,,1432,4.709163346613546
7934368,3,B000059XU8,This movie is not for minors. I found this movie okay. I would watch it again and recommend it. The poem the movie was based on was well acted out in the movie. I was not offended by the explicit love scenes.,1183507200,,208,3.9761904761904763
7934369,4,B000059XU8,"This film is beautiful, delicate, romantic, trully sensitive. But this edition only have one chapter!!! The whole film in only one chapter! A star the less for that. But, this film is wonderful.",993427200,5,194,4.909090909090909
7934370,3,B000059XU8,"Given the popularity of this film in Japan a few years ago, I was expecting something more. In many ways, the plot is derivative of ""In the Realm of the Senses"". While I have very mixed feelings about ""In the Realm of the Senses"", it had much more emotional (some of it negative, but nonetheless meaningful) impact than ""Lost Paradise."" ""Lost Paradise"" suffers from an abundance of mediocre love scenes (when a few genuinely moving ones would be better), a predictable ending, and a huge lack of character development. While the situation presented is a bit controversial due to the nature of Japanese marital laws, the film's failure is its inability to make the audience understand, or care about, the motives of the characters on anything more than a surface level. By the end of the movie, our protagonists are little more than cardboard cutouts going through their predestined motions.",992217600,5,890,4.94
7934371,5,B000059XU8,"Lost Paradise is a phenomenal movie.  The basic premis of this movie is that a Japanese business man who is married falls in love with a housewife of a prominent professor.  They begin an affair that proves to be both erotic and with dire consequences. Starring in this movie is the lovely Hitomi Kuroki.  She does a wonderful job acting as well as being just stunning on screen.
This movie was not without out its controversy when it was released in Japan.  It is legal for a male to have an affair, but it still remains illegal for a woman to do so.  Hence....controversy.
A modern day Japanese version of Romeo and Juliet.  It is not to be missed.",982195200,6,650,4.420168067226891
