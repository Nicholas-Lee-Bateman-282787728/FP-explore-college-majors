1658131,2,B00005RZPS,"Saber Marionette J was a wonderful series and I highly recommend it.  This however, is your typical disppointing sequel.  The plot extensions are weak and the characters lack the charm they had in SMJ.  As a fan of SMJ, I know how tempting it is to pick up this sequel, even though someone tells you its bad, just because you want more SMJ than they gave you.  I did. Take my advice; you can find better stuff to spend your money on than this.",1007337600,,443,4.238095238095238

1658133,5,B00005RZPS,"Saber J again is a cute anime about three marionettes named Lime Cherry and Bloodberry. They have maiden circuits which give them hearts and souls. This show is very cute, touching and funny. The antics of the gay Hanagata  will leave you on the floor and the heart warming stories will leave tears  on your cheeks. This is a MUST buy for any otaku fan!",961977600,5,353,4.415384615384616

7952921,5,B00005RZPS,"Otaru's life is pretty wild. As if having 3 Marionettes wasn't enough. Now he has 7! Faust has become put out with his Marionettes terrible cooking and their inability to act like normal people. He has sent Tiger, Panther, and Luchs to live with Otaru and his girls; hoping that they will learn not to be so inept. In addition to that, a new Marionette named Marine has shown up at Otaru's place. She has no memory, and has much to learn about living with humans as well. They soon realize that Marine is part of some bigger scheme by the president of New Texas. She may also be the key to saving the world from another disaster.

I had doubts about this OVA when I ordered it; but my doubts were soon cleared up when I began to watch. This OVA continues the 1st season pretty well. The animation is a big improvement, they story is as good as you could expect, and all the old characters are their usual selves. My 1 complaint is the English dub. Some of the, no, most of the voice actors are different. That is a good thing and a bad thing. Most of the new voice actors are easy to get used to. The new voice actor for Otaru isn't. It's the same person that they used for Kohta in Kanokon. Now Otaru sounds like a 8 year old boy instead of a grown man. It's really bad. Other than that, this OVA is great. I think that most fans of the 1st season will enjoy this 6 episode OVA.",1355529600,,1379,4.145522388059701
7952922,5,B00005RZPS,"Nice edition, This is the OVA, after the first part Saber Marionette J. It has Textless openings and ending, and an art gallery. Nice images, 2 DVDs and a guide.",1183334400,,161,4.4
7952923,4,B00005RZPS,"Right when you thought things would calm down, a series of events shake things up.  First, Faust sends Tiger,Panther and Luchs to Otaru, Lime, Cherry and Bloodberry for help.  It's hoped that Lorelei can repair Tiger and the other Dolls can learn manners from Otaru.  Second, a new Marionette appears, Marine, who seems to dislike men and has no memory of her past.

Third, there seems to be a danger greater than the Marionettes have ever faced before.  A danger that threatens the whole planet and even with Faust's help they may not defeat it.

Great link between J an J-X.  And Wendee Lee is Luchs' English voice.  YEAH!",1109289600,,624,4.660550458715596
7952924,5,B00005RZPS,"Saber Marionette is a top-notch anime! This fits with the first 3 DVDs, and is absolutely wonderful. The new marionette Marine has brought a new person into my site 'The Goddess of Anime'. I recommend this DVD whole heartedly.",1026259200,,226,4.82051282051282
7952925,5,B00005RZPS,"I've always liked these series since I watched them on TV.  I was amazed on how addictive they can be.
This Program 26 is a very good link between series and a ""must see"" to understand the first episodes of Saber Marionette J to X.  It's a new story that explains how Tiger got up and was repaired.  The character design is very similar to the J to X series, the same fresh and younger look.
If you liked Saber Marionette J as much as I did you'll surely enjoy watching this one.
A MUST BUY for SMJ and SMJX fans all over the world.",1020816000,5,532,4.0476190476190474
7952926,5,B00005RZPS,"Este OVA comienza despues del episodio 25 de ""Saber Marionette J"" que es algo asi como la primera temporada de la serie Saber Marionette.
La historia comienza cuando Lima descubre una marrioneta ""salvaje"" llamada Marina, que posee la habilidad de controlar el plasma(yo creo que por eso se llama ""Plasmatic Crisis"")",1012867200,3,315,5.196078431372549
7952927,4,B00005RZPS,"When I first did research on this new installment of SMJ, I was skeptical but eager to buy, none the less. I was very apprehensive because ALL of the voice actors are different! But being the die-hard SMJ fan that I am, I had to update my US release collection and get this one anyway. Let me say, the voices hardly matter by the time you're through this 6 episode set. The voice actors seem to get more and more comfortable in their roles, so that by the end you hardly notice the difference and everything is fine (with the exception of Otaru, the main character, who sounds more ""boyish"" than ever).
For those of you entering the world of Terra 2 and Saber Marionette J, ""Saber Marionette J"" was the first set of 25 episodes to come out around 1996 or so. Start there first if you haven't yet. Fantastic series. Then this series, SMJ Again, comes out thereafter and, since it's only 6 episodes, some people consider it to be an OVA prototype for the next series (SMJ to X). I like to think of it like a ""made-for-TV mini-series"". It takes all of the emotions, drama, action and goofiness of 25 or 26 episodes and compacts them into 6. The production quality is totally AWESOME, from art to sound. The artwork and DVD mastering is crisp and clear with enough incorporation of CG into the ink art to make it eye-candyish without taking away from the plot or looking cheesy. The sound is mixed very nicely in Dolby Digital and is overall exquisite. The soundtrack calls back to the original SMJ scores at points, and also incorporates entirely new themes and ideas. Every episode has a new opening and closing theme sequence (at least aesthetically) and are easier to watch--no temptation to ""chapter skip"" through to the episode anymore.
Like I've said, the only reason why this isn't 5 stars is because of the voices...they're just not the same anymore, but if you're a subber and not a dubber, the Japanese tracks are the same actors. Whether dub or sub, this is a very enjoyable and at times intense DVD collection that I'm very glad to own. Stay tuned for Saber Marionette J to X to be released after this set! I'll be there to grab it first thing! Will you?",1012608000,11,2163,4.49238578680203
7952928,4,B00005RZPS,"THis was a good series, but no where near as awesome as the first.  The plot was rather easy to predict, and the voices in any langauge just didn't fit.  Also I am all for Hanagata bashing, but in this series it just seemed repetative and pointless.  Having the other Saber dolls stay with Otaru was cool, but their outfits were very weird.  It was obvious this series was not rated the same as the first, just by looknig at Bloodberries outfit, which no longer has the orange under suit.  Flashing otaru seems to be a big thing in this DVD, but everyone knows they would never do it in the original.  Also plots seemed too rushed, like Marine's hate for men, and the marrionette's entering puberty.  The ending also is rather vague as to whether it is real or a dream.  Still if you liked the original this is a good one to watch while waiting for the next to come out.  Also Faust seemed very odd, without his cloak and regalia he looked like a biker.  It would also be nice to know more about the city of New Texas, as it was a major player in this series, but not in the first series.  We also see the use of cars, police wise (originally only guys like Hanagata had one as they seemed hard to come by), and satalites that were never used before.  Not to mention some things made no sense, like when Otaru nearly was ran over by the huge ocean liner that was traveling down the cannels in town.  (never seen one of those in SMJ).  Once again I like the series as a whole, but these 6 episodes were rather weak.",1012089600,3,1514,4.211805555555555
7952929,1,B00005RZPS,"I have to start out by saying how much I loved the first Saber Marionette series. The second one, however, is just lame. They changed all the voices and quite frankly the English dub is really bad. I'm not really into subs so I really cant comment on that aspect. Save your money folks, if your looking for something new, go get something cool like Sorcerer on the Rocks.",1012089600,,371,4.391304347826087
