8023599,5,B000286RU2,"I've developed an admiration for Frankie Darro movies. Even though the budgets were usually rock bottom, Darro never short-changed the public with his energy and acting. And that goes for a lot of the other wonderful ""b"" actors who appeared in many of these movies, like the handsome Kane Richmond and pretty damsels in distress June Gale and Rosita Butler.

""Devil Diamond"" from 1937 has a different look than many Poverty Row films, mainly due to some expert camerawork. There are more close-ups and medium shots. Also, the scenes are well-staged and don't appear to have been shot ""on the run.""

The plot centers around a huge, uncut diamond known as ""The Devil Diamond."" Some gangsters are out to steal the diamond when Kane Richmond shows up and claims to be a writer with a keen interest in gems. But is he a detective or just another crook out to get his hands on a diamond estimated at $200,000 in 1937 dollars? That's over two million of today's dollars, depending on which historical currency converter is used.

This Alpha release surprisingly has an above average picture and sound. So for a lot of fast-paced action with some comedy thrown in, this is an entertaining 61 minutes.",1315008000,2,1192,4.776699029126213

The film shows a street in a big city, like San Francisco. A jewelry company holds a private meeting. The ""Jarvis Diamond"" cost $200,000, it has a reputation for bad luck, a curse. It will fe cut into smaller diamonds for resale. One man has a plan to get them by illegal means. ""Bet on `Tough Luck' in the third race."" The leader of the gang has a plan. The young man will be trained for the boxing ring. This will explain the gang's presence in a small town. A home furnishes ""Room and Board"". Peter Lanning lives there, he is a diamond cutter. Comic scenes keep the story moving along, and fill up the time. Morland does his research at the library, and finds Jerry Connors there. There is a squabble in the barn. ""That's fine cooperation!""

We see a display of manners at the new roadhouse. The gang is careful with their words. There is a fight in the bar. [Comic relief?] The diamond is sent in a plain package. Can a man hide by climbing a tree? Lee talks to Jerry and learns his secret. Morland asks Stevens for more money but is refused. A bad management decision? Peter Lanning cuts the rough stone into smaller pieces. When his daughter Dorothy brings him lunch she finds Peter and the diamonds are missing! There are conflicts among the characters that lead to a car chase along the highway. Will the crooks be captured? There is a happy ending. ""You're so cute.""

This is an entertaining movie that involves different scenes, but lacks a musical number. The story is good considering its low budget. The monetary figures date this picture, the minimum wage then was 25 cents.",1264032000,,1618,4.515358361774744
