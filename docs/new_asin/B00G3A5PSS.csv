6050283,5,B00G3A5PSS,"The Channel Tunnel connects the United Kingdom to Northern France; a 37.9 kilometre underwater pass that allows for easy transport between the two countries. It's at the exact midpoint of this tunnel that a body is found; its location requiring both English and French detectives to assemble at the scene. Leading the French investigation is the serious and direct Elise Wasserman (Clmence Posy; Fleur Delacour from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter/dp/B000HKY9W8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter</a>&nbsp;films), whilst the English are headed by the more laidback Karl Roebuck (Stephen Dillane; Stannis Baratheon from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Game-of-Thrones/dp/B00KHWSD1O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Game of Thrones</a>).

He's more than willing to turn the investigation over to Elise; after all the dead woman is French and her head is in France - but things take a turn for the bizarre when the body is moved and it becomes immediately apparent that *two* bodies have been placed there. The killer has positioned the upper-half of a French politician and the lower-half of a British prostitute directly over the boundary line between France and England. Now the two countries *have* to work together.

If this premise is ringing a bell, that's probably because you've already seen or heard of the Danish/Swedish crime drama&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bron-Broen/dp/B00JPNU8P0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bron/Broen</a>&nbsp;or its American/Mexican remake ""The Bridge"". At this point you may be wondering why you'd bother with yet another variation of the story, but there is plenty here for a viewer to enjoy - even those familiar with the overarching plot.

Elise and Karl immediately butt heads; Elise is uptight, humourless and a stickler for doing everything by the book (though it's never made explicit, it's heavily hinted by her behaviour that she has some form of Asperger's syndrome), whilst Karl is easy-going, instinctive and has a humanist touch when dealing with suspects. Despite cultural and diametrically opposed personalities, the best part about their partnership is that there's no sexual tension between them. Each one has romantic complications in their own subplots, but as the serial killer's crimes start to escalate, no one is more surprised than they are to realize how effective they are as a team.

Nicknamed the Truth Terrorist by journalists, it soon becomes apparent that the killer has a political as well as a personal agenda when it comes to choosing his victims. He seeks to draw attention to the plight and/or corruption of various individuals, institutes and society in general, exploiting internet platforms and media saturation to share his ""truths"" with the rest of the world. Everything he does has clearly been years in the planning, leaving our protagonists to scramble after him at a break-neck speed (and making it all the more rewarding whenever they get the drop on him).

There are ten episodes in all, and the dialogue is evenly divided between French (with subtitles) and English. Though the first episode is almost a direct copy of ""Broen/Bron"", the two shows diverge as the episodes go on, with this one touching on issues such as the London riots or immigration policies.

The cast is impeccable; starting with Clmence Posy and Stephen Dillane and ending with the extensive supporting cast, including Tom Bateman as arrogant journalist Danny Hiller, Joseph Mawle as sinister social worker Stephen Beaumont, Thibault de Montalembert as Olivier Pujol, head of the Calais police service, Keeley Hawes in a minor role as a care worker and drug addict, Jack Lowden as Karl's rebellious teenage son Adam, and Angel Coulby (best known as Guinevere from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Merlin/dp/B00MBQYKG6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Merlin</a>) as Karl's wife Laura, who becomes more prominent as the episodes go on and is at the centre of the show's most riveting sequence.

Not all the subplots are wrapped up satisfactorily; minor characters that are embroiled in the Truth Terrorist's plotting flit in and out of the episodes on a regular basis, and at least one red herring is given a significant amount of screen time that peters out into nothing, but for the most part this is a tightly-plotted and ever-intensifying crime drama that knows how to manage its suspense (and occasionally allay it with a bit of humor).

The atmosphere is gritty and bleak, but it makes the most of its dual locations to provide plenty of locales in Kent and Calais, exemplifying the differences (and similarities) between the two countries. Well-acted and beautifully filmed, with a tight script and a terrifying antagonist (who I can't reveal here) ""The Tunnel"" is a surprisingly justified remake, and will hopefully get a second series.",1410393600,7,4980,5.7293640054127195
8620280,3,B00G3A5PSS,"I may be biased, but I really, really miss Saga and Martin. This series is a UK/France co-production. Another version of the original Scandanavian series ""The Bridge"".
As a production ""The Tunnel"" is a little bit off the mark. Starting with the sentimental lullaby-like theme song, to the silly Mickey Mouse voice of the Truth Terrorist, to the visually dull Channel Tunnel.
 The story moves slowly, a severed corpse has been placed in the Channel tunnel at the exact border of France and the UK. Literally, half of the body in the UK and half of the body in France which leads to joint Police jurisdiction.
The two investigators, French Elise and British Karl, and their respective teams are pretty clueless and usually traveling in circles. Karl has the majority of the dialogue and seems to be leading the investigation. As played by the actors; Elise is an expressionless cipher and Karl is a supercilious twit. You can't tell if Elise is a humorless, rude, by-the-book automatron or just stereotypically French. You can't tell if Karl is an arrogant, fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants chauvinist, or just stereotypically British. At any rate, neither protagonist is very likeable or relatable. They have no chemistry together.
 Fortunately, the mystery is interesting and the stock characters are pretty amusing (slimy journalist, rebellious teenagers, long suffering wives etc.) even if totally one dimensional caricatures.
 The cinematography is pedestrian, the Tunnel is not very interesting. Really, traveling in tunnels eliminates the fantastic vistas usually available to bridge travelers. The locations of Calais and Folkestone as photographed, seem interchangeable. The travel between the two countries is totally bland, and slows the momentum of the story. Tunnels are kind of limiting as locations...must be all that grey cement.
It's not bad and if I hadn't viewed ""The Bridge"" I might have enjoyed it more.",1453852800,4,1919,5.326732673267327
8620281,5,B00G3A5PSS,"I've seen the first seven episodes and find this An intriguing take on the basic ""The Bridge"" story. Acting is top notch, direction is solid. Now, how about figuring out a way for those of us in North America to view it without having to buy an European spec player. Streaming? Region 1 discs? Anything would be fine.",1448064000,,317,4.482758620689655

8620283,5,B00G3A5PSS,"This 2013 ten-part series from B Sky B (British) and Canal + (French) kept me on the edge of my seat.  I don't speak French so had to rely on the translations and often the dialogue was muffled so I gave in and used subtitles throughout.  Usually this is too much of an effort but in this case it was worth it.  Haven't seen the original Swedish-Danish series yet but, based on how good 'The Tunnel' is, will give it a go.  Clemence Posey seems a bit young to be a police 'capitaine' but she gives a powerful performance and Stephen Dillane certainly deserved the International Emmy Best Actor award for this performance.  There was more graphic violence than necessary; they really didn't need to linger on those scenes so long.  Acorn produced this 3 disc set which has a 'play all' feature.  All said: an excellent show.",1438214400,,823,4.52027027027027
8620284,2,B00G3A5PSS,"This is my least favorite adaptation of ""The Bridge"" that I've seen. Even the American version is better.
I'm uninterested in any of the characters and the way it's shot and edited seems to make it hard to follow at certain points
Some issues for me:
1. Why is the female lead's character so watered down?
2. There is absolutely no chemistry between the lead actors (thus characters)--which was a critical point in the origianl story
3. The resund Bridge was a character in the original series and the filmakers' attempt to make the ""Chunnel""  one fails miserably..
4. The journalist, an important character, is unbelievable. I don't buy the guy who plays him.
If you're not interested in ""The Bridge"" then go for it!. Comparatively speaking this is a weak and watered down version of the original. Check out the American version before this one!

If you're not familiar with ""The Bridge"" search out a copy of the original Danish/Swedish series",1426032000,3,944,4.820987654320987

8620289,5,B00G3A5PSS,"I purchased the standard DVD Region 2 PAL version (not playable on US DVD players) from a UK Amazon seller. It cost me about 1/2 the price of the U.S. Blue-ray version. It was sent to me by Royal Mail and took about two weeks to arrive. Not a bad trade-off to save $25. Since purchasing my Sony Region-free DVD player from Amazon, I've also made other standard PAL DVD purchases with comparable savings.

If you go to the Amazon Blue-ray purchasing page, you will find two ""Videos related to this product"". They aren't. These videos have absolutely nothing to do with the pictured DVD series. They are of a movie with the same title. To convince yourself that you absolutely need to purchase this fantastic series, you need to go to the ---Tube place, look for ""Inside The Tunnel""by Sky Atlantic and watch that instead.

Again. What you want is the British/French crime drama television series. Choose carefully. There is lots of mediocrity out there with the same exact title. You can find out even more about this British/French series by going to that ----pedia page and looking for ""The Tunnel (TV series)"". At the bottom of that page, you will find numerous links to articles about the series but I think that the most important information is found in Footnote 1: ""Sky Atlantic planning second series of serial killer drama adapted from Scandinavian original The Bridge.""

Consider Series 2 ""already sold"" as soon as it shows up as available for purchase on Amazon.",1412467200,6,1471,4.76078431372549
