7938520,5,B00005J76G,"I sit here and read these reviews one after one for this film.  Some gave the most horrible rviews from people who went to school with one of the actors to the most amazing reviews who saw the movie's potential.  I can't believe people saw this as horrible and cheesy writing. In my eyes and opinion, I saw this as great writing.  The actors did an incredible job acting out their parts as as some has already said, young adults can relate to these kids characters.  I myself have shown this movie to others and all can relate to it...all can see themselves in certain characters.

If you look at the emotions and concentrate of the mood of this film, you will like it for the most part. If you want any action in your films, this would not be the movie for you...a lot of talking going on to make you relate with each character.

I for one picked this movie up on the east coast at a local Big Lots store...didn't take long before this became my favorite film...I cried three times during my first view...I def. reccomend for anybody to pick this up with an open mind!!",1122595200,3,1070,4.325
7938521,4,B00005J76G,"This movie portrays the world's problematic teenagers very well to some extent.  some of the speeches were unrealistic for your average teenager to actually be expressing to strangers, however, thanks to great acting by Francis, Tann, Huett, Damon, and the rest, the movie's quality was dramatically increased.  One problem I personally had with the movie was the ending when all the kids were talking about what they were thinking.  If you ask me, it was kind of cheesy.  Overall this movie was well-written, had great actors and actresses, and had all the drama needed to keep a movie viewer inrigued throughout the film.",1006560000,,623,5.019417475728155
7938522,3,B00005J76G,"Social Misfits is a movie you can pretty much enjoy if you take the characters into account individually.  I say this because, in general, the film's pretty stagnant.  The writing was dull (even awful at times); some of the acting was questionable; the motives of the film are rather contradicting; the music was terrible and could have done better.
There are some good points, too.  Some of the other acting, in particular by Damon, De La Fuente, Tann, and Huett, was wonderful.  However, it is Charlie Talbert's short ""moment"" that truly saves this film.  He plays Kyle the Klepto in this film and his performance, though short, is magical to watch.  His starring role was in ""Angus"" (1995), of which he was terrific in, and he's just as terrific, charming, charismatic, and tender as he was in this film... perhaps better.  This should be appreciated since Talbert is very rarely seen in any films.
The concept of having a smorgasbord of misfit kids shipped off by their parents and locked up in a room for two days is quite intriguing in itself.  However, I'm not sure if the behavior the writer intended to show was really the appropriate one.  There's no real closure; there's no real sense of ambiguity, either.  It is implied out of little that these kids do in fact change.  Even though their behavior is undeniably relevant for today, the writer fails to deliver it in a credible manner.
All-in-all, it's a decent film to rent.  If you have any favorite star in this film, like Charlie for me, then go ahead and buy it.  Otherwise, spare yourself.",1001635200,2,1557,4.7011070110701105
7938523,1,B00005J76G,"This movie was an utter train wreck, sheer dog .... Low grade trash that will wallow in the unmarked grave  of ...movie making. It made me long to watch Battlefield Earth twice. Words fail to describe the utter discust and waste of time this dreadful picture representces, itemize the contents of your trash can it will be time well spent if your other option is sitting through Social Misfits.",1001030400,,394,4.7101449275362315
7938524,2,B00005J76G,"well, i was excited about the movie because i like movies about rebelous teenagers and i am also a big fan of gabriel damon. but when this movie started, after the first 'speech' i started to laugh. kids aren't really like that! whoever wrote this movie has no idea what kids are like. and the ending, when they all just got really nice! caring about the girl who got raped? um, i don't think so. i think the funniest parts were when the the guy who steals had his little speech and then the guy who tried to kill himself, his speech was funny too. i could just see myself bringing this movie to a party and just everyone laughing at how cheesy it is. but hey, you want to watch the movie to see what cheesy thing is next! oh yeah, and the girl who could fly!? um, yeah right! well, that is my opinion on this one! thanks.  oh yeah, i can never forget the part when the girl got up and was like 'will you shut up.  someone is hurting because they were raped'  ok, sure.  announce it to everyone honey!  and how they dealt with it.  um, that was the work of a true rape victim-YEAH RIGHT..
so i am pretty much saying 'if you want a good laugh, watch this movie with some friends who have a great sense of humor-and who can laugh at cheesiness'",1000684800,2,1242,4.132780082987552
7938525,5,B00005J76G,"I loved this movie!  The story is extremely well-written, so I want to congratulate Tyrone Tann for doing such a great job.  All the actors are very talented!  Gabriel Damon, Tyrone, Ryan Francis, and Elizabeth Huett all did amazing jobs!  I'm a big Gabriel Damon fan, and I have to say that he is awesome!  The characters are so real and you get a good understanding of each of their situations.  The story is intense, and it makes you think.  It was so interesting to see how these characters act and change throughout the story.  It is a very good movie, and everyone involved with it should be congratulated!  I was kind of upset that it was only released on the West coast, but I'm glad I got to see it eventually when it came out on video!  It is such a great movie, and I would definitely recommed it to everyone!",998092800,2,820,4.3355263157894735
7938526,5,B00005J76G,"I just rented Social Misfits recently and I would like to say that this movie is powerful, emotional, and moving. The cast was great! And the story line was well thought out. There are not many movies like this, It was one of a kind! Many people can learn from the experiences that these young adults went through. It was realistic and the cast was great! Gabe Damon, Ryan Francis and Tyronne Tann did a wonderful job!!! Good luck to them and the rest of the cast from Social Misfits!!! It was a great movie!!!! Two thumbs up!!!",996019200,,528,4.3979591836734695
7938527,4,B00005J76G,"Hello,  I just wanted to say the movie ""Social Misfits"" displayed a wonderful example of human relations, of different stereotypical parts of society being brought to share one viewpoint, and of how different ethnic groups can live together, even for just some moments, at the same level.  Gabe Damon played an especially strong role in the developing of this movie. Thumbs up.
I was a bit disappointed that it was only released on the west coast.  But thanks to amazon.com, I received the opportunity of buying such a great film.  Bravo to the producer, director, screen writers, and keep it up.",994982400,,596,4.871287128712871
7938528,5,B00005J76G,"I can't wait to see this, though I fear it won't be very popular because it wasn't entirely released in theaters. I love Gabriel Damon and a few other actors in it, and it should be a great movie. It has a pretty good plot, and should be interesting. NEWSIES RULE!!",991526400,,265,4.215686274509804
