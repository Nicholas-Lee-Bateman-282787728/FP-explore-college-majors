Mrs. Faver gets a telephone call from a friend, Martin Abbot. She will walk over there. A man talks to her, Alexis, Psychic Consultant. Martin joins her at her home. They talk. At night she dreams; did she hear a voice? Will she see a ghost? Chris screams then faints. It was a bad dream says her friend. Should she seek help? She goes to see Alexis, and continues to do so. Her friends go to see a Private Detective who investigates psychics; he knows all their tricks. Can Janet investigate him?

A two-way mirror allows viewing, sensitive paper copies her written question. Can he read her mind? Yes. She offers him a cigarette from her case. He puts his fingerprints on that case and wins her confidence! [A lesson here?] Our client is hooked good. Another older woman visits. Alexis inspects her jewelry. Janet tells Chris to avoid Alexis and explains why. Janet ties his hands and he gets into a cabinet. A ghostly luminous hand floats in the darkness! Then there is a portrait of a man. A tape recorder plays music, ghostly figures appear! [We see how these tricks are done.] A figure appears near the door. Nobody was up there! Later there is a surprise! I can use you.

This movie starts slowly but develops into a clever plot. It is important for its educational value, then. Nowadays few people believe in magic like psychics. Can some people read minds? Yes. Right now I can read your mind, and you are thinking I cant do it. Now you're thinking what I did was obvious, and wondering what Im going to say next. Now you think Ive come to the end of this act and will quit. Am I right?",1412035200,,2368,4.474537037037037
