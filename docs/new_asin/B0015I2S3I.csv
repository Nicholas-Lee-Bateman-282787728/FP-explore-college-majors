The songs are catchy and fun for adults to listen to as well with themes like ""I hide my muscles well"" and ""my mother loves my brother more"".  Bright colorful cartoon backgrounds with a frog puppet are a common theme.  They do videos to Zak's songs that are super cute.  I cant believe this video is only three dollars on here, I paid way more for it.  I wish there was another video but I was happy to at least see there are 3 CDs for sale.  I guess Zak Morgan won a Grammy for his music (used in this DVD) about 10 years ago.",1305417600,,568,3.93859649122807
8258683,5,B0015I2S3I,"Thank you, Zak, for creating a video I actually like watching with my kids. Our favorite is tio-dnaci.  Within a few viewing, we had the words memorized. My kids were excited meeting you.  They felt like they had met a star!",1299628800,,224,4.439024390243903
8258684,5,B0015I2S3I,"Since purchasing Zakland, this DVD has quickly become a favorite of our 4 and 2-year-old kids, although it would certainly be entertaining to somewhat older kids as well. The soundtrack is really quite endearing, with musical segments featuring songs from Zak Morgan's acclaimed albums, Bloom and When Bullfrogs Croak. Music and the imagination take center stage, as Zak leads kids on a playful romp through ""Zakland""--an educational and inspirational, colorful landscape where trees and creatures are shaped from musical instruments, and the chant ""Tiodonaci"" (an anagram for ""I can do it"") is the order of the day! It's a great lesson in imagination, self-esteem, and the joy of music.",1219190400,,687,5.3119266055045875
