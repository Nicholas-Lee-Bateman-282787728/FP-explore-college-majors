8385256,2,B002ZTLVW0,"Not a very thorough telling of the tale of the Bedford Boys.  It jumps around a bit and never seems to be focused, the book is much better for getting a feel for this story.",1369958400,,173,3.942857142857143
8385257,5,B002ZTLVW0,This was probably overdone from a historical standpoint but still the story is probably generally correct and the facts are there.,1367452800,,130,5.238095238095238
8385258,5,B002ZTLVW0,"This is an excellent dvd about the small town that paid
a heavy price in losing so many of its sons on D-Day June
6, 1944.  Interviews with those that knew the boys will
tug at your heart.  This small town remembers them with a
beautiful Memorial, please visit it, it is beautiful.",1348185600,,281,4.283018867924528
8385259,5,B002ZTLVW0,"I had read the book ""Bedford Boys"" (which I would highly recommend) and was glad to see that they had done a documentary on it.  This little town in VA lost more men in the war per capita than any other place in the U.S.  Reading the book first made this documentary even better for me.",1291334400,,286,4.089285714285714
8385260,5,B002ZTLVW0,This movie is a stunningly in-depth look at the personal sacrifice of families and individuals during a time of war. My two daughters (23 and 17) accompanied me to a viewing two days ago and we were all touched very deeply by the impact of war on the real people in the movie. To call it a moving and informative snapshot of their sacrifice for freedom just does not seem to do it justice!,1275004800,3,389,4.27027027027027
8385261,4,B002ZTLVW0,"This is another thought-provoking film by the creators of ""Paper Clips.""  The people of Bedford VA have intense memories of World War II and its heavy impact on them.  For this film, they are interviewed with sensitivity, and their opinions are firm and sometimes surprising.  The videography presents their memories in an unusual and interesting way.",1269388800,3,351,5.232142857142857
8385262,5,B002ZTLVW0,"A poignant story of the men from rural Bedford County, Virginia who were in the local National Guard company-sized unit and called up to serve in WWII.  After basic training, the boys were sent to England where they trained for the amphibious landing planned for Normandy.  On D-Day, 19 men of the unit lost their lives, including two brothers and the company commander.  The film depicts episodes of the soldiers shot before and after the war.  Some of the D-Day veterans filmed quite recently have passed on since the filming.  The fact that the losses during that first day of the invasion represented the largest percentage of mortalities from one unit, compared to the size of the local population, led to Bedford City being selected as the site of the National D-Day Memorial.  A must-see film from the same producers of the likewise touching film ""Paper Clips"".",1269302400,5,868,4.870748299319728
