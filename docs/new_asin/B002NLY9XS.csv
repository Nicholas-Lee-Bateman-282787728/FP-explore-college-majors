Here's some of the issues I have with this movie after previewing it:

1. the fact that profanity is constantly used

2. you have to endure a senior citizens bum shaking infront of you when he drops his pants and he asks to have some of the green moss to cure his well...problem should I say of being unable to do his husbandly duty...although that wasn't the wording he used... very specific and graphic terms.

3. they try to bring a dead man back to life and they show the dead man?!?!

4. There's a scene where the police go to arrest the senior for stealing some of the moss and they arrest him while in the act of doing his husbandly duty he comes out of his house with his wifes under garments hanging around his neck.

there's more....Ugggh!....it goes on and on!

98% of all our movies at home are feature films for families Because we love watching them...I feel Blessed that I had put this on to watch after the kids had gone to bed to preview it...I could never show it to my kids it was not a family movie for our family.",1265760000,8,1130,4.252336448598131
