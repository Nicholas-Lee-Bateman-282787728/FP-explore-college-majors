8236025,5,B000ZMEOKU,"As a birth-mother who found my daughter when she was 18, and whose relationship has grown steadily over the 15 years since then, I was particularly eager to view ""10 Things: Adoption Search & Reunion.""  I began to watch, jotting down the steps therapist Sharon Roszia outlined, mentally evaluating how each segment fit with my experience.  At the same time, I followed with rapt attention the reunion process of Julie, the adoptee, and Wendy, a birth-mom like me.

  The advice, the cautions and the expectations which the film expands upon are CLEAR, ENLIGHTENING AND EXTRAORDINARILY PERCEPTIVE.  I wish I had had such insights to help me in my own search.
  Because for 20 years, I have belonged to support groups in three different states (CA, NC & NM), in addition to reading dozens of books on adoption, plus sharing the journeys of dozens of friends in their searches, I was reminded once again of the thread of similarty tieing us all together, yet also the complete uniqueness of each adoption story.

  I can state with ENTHUSIASM that this DVD COVERED EVERY POSSIBLE FACET OF SEARCH & REUNION, many of which had never even occurred to me.
  Naturally, I addressed each question the film posed.  For example, I knew very well ""Why"" I was searching--I wanted the answers to two burning questions:  1) Is my daughter all right?  2) Does someone love her?  Because my support group at the time had adoptees, adoptive parents and birth-parents, I knew it was important for my daughter (the adoptee) to control our reunion.  Thus, I wrote her a letter (which I previewed with my support group before sending), introducing myself and giving her the choice to meet me.  Two weeks later she came for our first week's visit, a time filled with laughter and tears.

  As fate would have it, at the time I saw ""10 Things: Adoption Search & Reunion,"" I was staying with my daughter's mother (her adoptive mom) , in town to meet ""our"" granddaughter for the first time.  (yes, my daughter is now a happily-married mother.)  We watched this DVD together, then shared our thoughts and feelings--how much of Wendy's story fit with my own, especially that sense of freedom she felt upon finding her son, Eric.

  But my daughter's mother found it almost impossible to believe that adoptive families could be unaccepting, something she had never thought about.  Ultimately, we again counted our blessings in having such a close relationship--like sisters--and laughed about how ""our"" daughter agreed with her not long ago when she said, ""Let's face it, Pat.  Sara needs two moms.""

  We each concluded that this DVD would be INVALUABLE to anyone wishing to begin a search. At the same time, we say that simply to learn where your child or birth-parent is, no matter what the outcome, will be worth the effort.  THIS FILM IS SO FILLED WITH WISDOM, LOVE and SUPPORT that if an individual watches it a few times and is able to contemplate and take hold of its guidance, we both strongly believe that the choices you make will be more than satisfying.

  In conclusion, I would say that ""10 Things: Adoption Search & Reunion"" can even serve as that ""mentor"" or ""friend"" it recommends.
  I AM GRATEFUL TO ALL THOSE AT THE KINSHIP CENTER WHO BROUGHT THESE EXTRAORDINARY HISTORIES, PERCEPTIONS AND ADVICE TO US.  I will be sharing it with everyone I know, especially those whose lives are touched by adoption.
