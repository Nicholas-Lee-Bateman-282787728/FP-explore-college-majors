6797849,3,B00PCSVODW,"I never read 50 Shades..., and have no interest in reading it or seeing the film. It seemed obvious to me that this movie has nothing to do with the aforementioned ""Mom Porn"" so many were expecting.

Pros:
This Fetish Set movie has a good story, some decent humor, Sarah Nicklin is cute, and her acting was good. The same goes for Julia McAlee. Galeano has a nice tush, and Bill Oberst's screen presence is disturbing and effective. Also, the story moves at a nice pace. This movie has mostly a female cast. The film is framed and shot well too.

Cons:

I had a lot of difficulty understanding Galeano's dialog because she has a strong Latin accent. Galeano and Tomiko's acting was poor at times, especially when their characters were crying. The film could've benefitted from a bit more female nudity. Way too much footage of Oberst dancing naked.

Conclusion:

Not a bad movie overall. If the dvd had an option for English subtitles, a bit more female nudity, better performances from two of the actors, and reduce the Oberst dance sequences, I probably would've given this film five out of five stars. Still, I really enjoyed this and recommend it. Just forget about the Fifty Shades already!",1467936000,,1195,4.698564593301436

6797875,1,B00PCSVODW,Thought this was the sequel to fifty shades of grey,1458777600,,51,4.2
6797876,4,B00PCSVODW,"First off, this film is not connected in any way to ""Fifty Shades of Grey."" I'm sure the ""fifty shades"" here was added to the title in an attempt to cash in on the hype and success of that film. This one is about four ladies who attend a fetish convention in Texas, to make some money catering to the unique ""tastes"" of the ""unconventional conventioneers."" The opening scene, in which the ladies are together in their hotel room, talking and doing certain ""activities,"" defines the four characters fairly well.

Bill Oberst Jr. gives a great performance as a Buffalo Bill-like crazed killer who targets the ladies, but it's the four actresses who really shine in this film, and of those four, it's Venezuelan-born Glenda Galeano who shines the brightest as Reyna, a streetwise lesbian, who can be as cold-blooded as she can compassionate. One notable scene is where Reyna gives instructions to a freaked-out Mai on what they'll need to do and get to dispose of the large body of the man Jo (Sarah Nicklin) just killed in the adjoining room, but not without getting a huge swollen-shut eye out of the deal. Tomiko Madoff (credited here as just ""Tomiko"") who plays Mai, is actually a real-life fetish model and performer, and the backstory on her character here is probably loosely (or perhaps not so loosely) based on herself. Julia McAlee rounds out the quartet of dames as the seemingly-passive Angel, who's Reyna's flavor of the month.

The ending scene reveals something unexpected and it's inconclusive, which leaves the door wide open for a sequel. Even those who don't have a stomach for extreme violence or a taste for sex and nudity should be able to handle this one as that stuff is mostly implied in this film, rather than explicit.",1458691200,6,1742,4.764900662251655

6797957,1,B00PCSVODW,"First of all, this movie calls itself ""The Fetish Set"" in the title and end sequences and the commentary; somebody tacked on the ""Darker 50 Shades"" to sell more copies, I guess, but it has NO resemblance to ""50 Shades of Grey.""  Best single word description:  UGLY.  Rape, rape, murder, murder, rape, murder, all done off camera (we just get to see the results).  Brief nudity here and there, and the first scene is the ""fetish set"" of the title (meaning naughty behavior in lingerie); otherwise, four not-too-young female characters stay fully (and boringly) clothed and bawl their heads off, one of them through the entire movie. We try to find something to admire in these characters, thrust as they are into terrible situations, but their attempts to cope are pathetic. The principal actor, Glenda Galeano, has a Spanish accent that kept me from understanding a third of her dialogue, so I missed some of the plot connections; even if I could understand her, I don't think I would understand the motivations for a lot of the actions in this storyline.  The final twist and suspenseful ending might have worked if the movie that preceded them had been totally different.",1433376000,45,1173,4.845
