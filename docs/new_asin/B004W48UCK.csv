8444340,5,B004W48UCK,"Released in 1988, WORKING STIFFS is Micheal Legges first feature length film ( shot in super 8 !). It revolves around a temp agency that hits upon the Idea of first killing their prospective employees, then raising them from the dead to send them out to work! Legge plays Ed Drago, the agency worker who supplies the idea ( and the spell ) to zombify people and create the ultimate work force...but as Drago comes to learn, the best laid plans of mice and madmen often go awry.

This is the 6th film of Michael's that I've had the pleasure to watch, and I can honestly say I haven't been dissapointed yet. Legge himself has said in interviews that people either love his work or hate it- that there seems to be no middle of the road. You can absolutely put my name in the ""love it"" column!

Recently shown at the New England Underground Film Festival, WORKING STIFFS is a look into the past of a very talented and imaginative filmmaker. Even with this early entry in his career, you can see the comfort his actors have not only with each other, but with his leadership and direction. He is a natural at this.

WORKING STIFFS....they may be the only employees whose motto is ""Thank God it's Monday!""",1350086400,,1198,4.461187214611872
