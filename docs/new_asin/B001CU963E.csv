A known sequence of coins, arm pulls and buttons would produce a big payout. But that was not enough. Then he discovered that the random number generator in Keno wasn't so random. The first time he used the number generator, he won too big against enormous odds and drew the suspicion of the house. The gaming comission never knew he rigged the slot machines until he got busted for winning too big at Keno. Full of suspence with heart pounding close calls and one guy gets murdered for knowing too much. I was on the edge of the couch.",1288396800,,667,4.475409836065574
