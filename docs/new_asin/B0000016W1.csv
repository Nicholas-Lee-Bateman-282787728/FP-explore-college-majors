8173237,5,B0000016W1,"This is a wonderfull tape. I wish it were still available - I rented it from the NYPL dance collection once and have not been able to get it again. It consists of Alica Alonso, Carla Fracci, Ghislane Thesmar and Eva Evdokimova dancing reconstructed pieces from the romantic era, which is when ballerinas first started dancing on point - the time of Taglioni, Grisi, Grahn, Cerrito and Essler. I recall that Alonso danced a solo from Roberto the devil and all 4 of them danced the famous ""Pas de Quatre"", but I don't remember which solos the other 3 performed. They also discuss elements of the romantic style, and how they approach the ballets. Alonso & Fracci do most of the talking (esp Alonso), but then - they have the most to tell us! Hopefully it will pop up used someshere, I would love to own it.",1081123200,3,804,4.476190476190476

The two dancers who appeared younger could barely get in a few words. Althought their discussions were unclear the dancing is definately worth watching.",1047254400,,288,4.8979591836734695
