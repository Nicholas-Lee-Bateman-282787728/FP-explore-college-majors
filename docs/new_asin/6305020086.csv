951751,5,6305020086,"An original masterpeice. This is one of the greatest movies ever made. The struggle betwwen the good and evil. Islam conquers the hearts of all men, and is the true meaning of life. However after watching this film, I've  noticed some parts of History taken out of the Holy Prophet Muhammad's  life. There were many more battles also, but in the movie it only focused  on two. Imam Ali, the successor of The Prophet was also left out, even  though he is the most important being in the universe next to The Prophet.  Although it had some false artributes, the movie was beautifuly done and  the acting and scenes are breathtaking!",917827200,,630,4.63063063063063
951752,5,6305020086,"I am not a Muslim, however, this movie presents a very historical and true picture of the struggles of Islam and the development of this religion.  This is a movie you will enjoy watching regardless of your religious  preference.  I found myself having a much greater understanding of Muslims  and a very deep respect for their faith after viewing this film.  I highly  recommend it for anyone and all ages.  I am very surprised this movie was  not a box office smash.  One of the best I have ever seen......it answers a  lot of questions and presents some great opportunities for interfaith  understanding. As an American this film was a special ""eye  opener"" for me.",915062400,135,668,4.71304347826087

951972,4,6305020086,"At the beginning of the movie, there is a statement that refers to the movie being approved by the back-then Al Azhar University and the Shi'ite Council of Lebanon, i.e., both the Sunni and Shia representations, respectively, were OK with it.  If you are disoriented by the events for the past many years, whichever side of the fence you are on, this movie may be a good place to start.  With the very very little knowledge that I have, some scenes can be traced back in their history.  For example, when the Prophet's uncle (Abu Talib) is in his deathbed and is mentioning ""One"" or when Bilal orders that not even a date palm should be destroyed (meaningless destruction of the enemy's property during war) can be traced back to its origins.  Some other scenes are more solid as they are brought up in the Qur'an, e.g. the Spoils of War when the archers abandon their strategic position for that purpose.  Overall, you can take a scene/clip from the movie and do a research for yourself (a legitimate research on peer-reviewed articles, books, etc.).",1486944000,,1051,4.690217391304348

It is a very interesting movie as we watch the beginnings of Islam.  The actors had to work with a presence.  The Prophet Mohammed  is not shown or heard in the movie, following Muslim religious tradition. We see the actors speak towards the Camera and then listen to a man speak and we do not hear what he says. After he speaks another actor would repeat what the Prophet said so we know what was said.  The Prophet starts with a few followers and we watch as is beliefs influence others as they are drawn to the Prophet.  The actors do a great job and Anthony Quinn is wonderful.  It is unfortunate that when this movie came out that there were protests a few people died, so the movie was pulled from the theaters.  I gained an understanding of Islam and enjoyed the movie.

Besides the spiritual and historical content, this movie is well-shot and excellently directed. The scenes of battle are particularly delightful to watch, whereas the scenes involving the Prophet Muhammad are impressive and inspiring. The movie gives an idea about life in Mecca, with many social and spiritual issues before Islam, and how the new religion fixed social problems and guided the moral behavior.

Most complained that the movie didn't cover every aspect or action of Muhammad's (pbuh).  Well, this is a movie, not a mini-series.

Several complained because Muhammad (pbuh) is not portrayed in the film.  This was deliberate so as not to offend Muslims and it is made clear in the beginning of the film.

The film does cover several key points in his life and was required viewing for a class I'm taking on Islam.  While not one hundred percent factual, I'd say it's about ninety percent on that mark, the ten percent being poetic license.

While a knowledge of Islam isn't needed, I found it did help to have some background on the subject.

That is quite an accomplishment at this time, when Muslims around the world (those we see in the press) look violent and fanatical.  It is the same now as it was in the early days, despite our freedom of religion---to say that one is a Muslim takes courage.  My elderly mother was impressed at how much it seemed like a movie about Christ.  And the film is roughly accurate---at least as much as can be expected of a movie, for it does not change history like ""The Gladiator"" does (to name one example).",1370736000,2,692,4.341085271317829

952898,4,6305020086,"THE MESSAGE a.k.a. MOHAMMED: THE MESSENGER OF GOD is a film I had heard of many years and finally I got chance to see it about six weeks ago.  I am not a Muslim and I am not overly familiar with story of the Prophet Mohammed.  I saw a documentary about him once on PBS.  This film is good, but not great.  The negative aspects are that it is cheesy, some acting is underpar, and the villians pretty one dimensional while the good guys are very good.  On the other hand the production values are top notch.  Anthony Quinn does a good job as Mohammed's uncle.  Finally, the story of the Prophet is so compelling that it helps with shortcomings of the film.
  As already stated in many reviews the Prophet nor his immediate family were shown.  From what I know about Islam (and I am no expert) it is againt the religion to show an image of Mohammed or his immediate family.  The filmmakers were pretty ingenious in not showing him and being able to make a three hour film on the life of man without ever showing him.
  The film does comes to a powerful and moving conclusion.  I thought the ending was quite creative. It's too bad the film wasn't as powerful throughtout it's entirety and it's too bad it has cheesy elements.  But it's not as cheesy as THE TEN COMMANDMENTS and some other religious films I've seen.

952976,5,6305020086,"This film is about Mohammed and early Islam. If you are not interested in this topic, I don't think you will like this movie. It is a film from the 70s, but has the feel of an early 60s film. Not everyone's taste.

If you want to learn more about Islam, I think this film is a great start. You do get an understanding of the society that Mohammed was revolting against and you learn some basic facts about his life. As an example, I now realise that the role of women was improved by Islam compared to pre-Islam times. So I don't think Mohammed tried to put down women. Off course, the situation today is different because the western society has given women many more rights. So today Islam does not seem very equal in my view. Another thing I learnt is how little of what Muslims believe today is clearly spelt out in the Koran, but instead is described in texts (hadith) written several hundred years after Mohammed's death.

The film is directed by a Muslim, but I don't think it is propaganda. It is in fact probably the best way to understand the appeal of Islam to many people of the region. The idea that race and status does not matter in the eyes of Allah is indeed a powerful idea. This becomes very clear in the film.

Some people here on amazon criticize the film because it doesn't show a balanced view of Mohammed. Without being an expert. I think this is valid criticism. Some areas not covered well are: The role of women in Islam. The way Mohammed's early followers gained resources. The relationship between Muslims and Christians/Jews. These are serious omissions if you want to understand Islam.

The director wanted to make a film so that audiences could better understand the positive sides of Islam. I don't know what to make of the irony that a Muslim suicide bomber killed the director and his daughter seemingly at random in 2005.

In conclusion, I think this is a five star film. Please play tribute to the director by buying the DVD.

If you want to understand current Islam, there is obviously a lot more to understand. Start with the film and the check the al-quran.info and you can see how some critical verses have been translated differently. Then check out wikipedia that has loads of material.",1313625600,6,2229,4.546134663341646

This movie gave me a better idea of the Prophet Muhammad's life (PBUH) I also see how Africans accepted Islam, it wasn't by force as some folks say, Northern Africans such as senegalese, Morrocans, Malians, Tunisians, Algerians, etc all accepted Islam. Africans were enslaved by Arabs before the Europeans began. The acceptance of Islam happened initially through Ali and his exposure to the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)Such a beautiful movie. I watched it twice. I would recommend this movie to all non-muslims who want to know about islam.

953034,5,6305020086,"""There is no compulsion in religion, it can take a man many years or only minutes.
It is God who decides the time.  So respect his doubts.""

There are many sayings like this throughout the movie ""The Message.""  Sayings that cause you to scan back and replay them so you can fully ingest their meanings.  This was my third time watching this movie and again I come away with new ideas as well as a greater respect for Muslims and their faith.  When the Christian Abbysinnian King draws a line in the ground to show how thin the differences between Christianity and Islam are, you get a sense that you're watching a movie that can change peoples perceptions about other religions.

I thought not having an actor portray Mohommad (PBUH) was a signature theme of the respect this movie shows for Allah and his messenger.  While Anthony Quinn seemed to thrive in his role as the Lion Hunter, his dialogue with the camera as Mohommad was brilliant. The supporting cast, though a bit stiff (1977), takes nothing away from the overall performance.  There is no misunderstanding the messenger's message. He continues to remind followers that he is just a man. An illiterate man who received the word of God with a duty to reveal it to man.

Regardless of your ethnicity or religious beliefs, this movie is a joy to watch simply because it teaches while telling a very revelatory tale about the man who brought the message of Islam to Arabia and the struggle to have it take root in the culture. Don't be afraid to learn about Islam and/or expel preconceived notions you may have about its beliefs and practice. There is no room for prejudicial judgment in this movie, just brotherly confirmation amongst mankind.",1304553600,2,1703,4.707070707070707
953035,5,6305020086,"It is the 7th century and in Makkah (Mecca) powerful leaders are in conflict with Muhammad who attacks the many injustices their way of life produces - slavery, drunkenness and cruelty. Muhammad claims to have seen a vision of the Angel Gabriel and calls to the people of Makkah to worship the one God - not the 360 idols of the Kaaba. Muhammad and his followers meet secretly, despite bitter opposition, and the leaders of Makkah respond with persecution, forcing the new Muslims to leave and find sanctuary in Medina. Then follows the story of the adult life of Muhammad to the return to Makkah, the destruction of the idols in the Kaaba and the restoration of the holy place to the worship of the one God.

Hollywood's Syrian-born Moustapha Akkad produced and directed this feature film starring Anthony Quinn and Irene Papas. Music was composed and conducted by Maurice Jarre. Intended to promote interfaith understanding of Islam, it is the recounting of the life story of the Prophet Muhammad. Filmed entirely in Muslim countries, it was objected to in a few, although the Prophet Muhammad himself is never shown. It is highly acceptable to the American Muslim audience and will bring nods of approval from parents of Muslim youngsters in the classroom. Its real ""Hollywood"" appeal - big budget, special effects, location shooting (one of the late 1970s ""epics"") - make it an educational film that will rivet student attention. (Includes a 45 minute trailer that describes the making of the epic - itself a valuable tool for student understanding.) Think of it as a primary source. A must in any classroom study of Islam!

Obviously this is an old movie and seems like a throwback to the old Hollywood epics like The Ten Commandments. Making a movie about the birth of Islam is a difficult proposition due to restrictions about portraying early leaders like Muhammad and Ali. This director gets around it by showing other characters and only suggesting the presence of Muhammad by having the camera take his point of view and playing soothing music. To a degree this lessens the impact of the movie but it is a workable trade off. This movie does a decent job of portraying the conditions under which Islam was born but it does gloss over a few details here and there. Overall, it gives a good visual perspective of what happened while at the same time trying to highlight some of the societal goals of Islam also.

I was impressed by the fact that no actor actually plays 'the prophet'. People talk to the camera - as if the camera itself is him.
I was drawn to Islam by its simple and direct message. However I was disappointed by the highly selective dealings with his life. His child-bride Aisha is not shown at all.
Some of the battles are shown, as he fights to regain entry to Mecca. The subsequent murder of political opposition, and the massacre of hundreds of Banu Qurayza prisoners in cold-blood are excluded from this narrative.

953141,4,6305020086,"Its too bad the noble sentiments expressed in this homage to early Islam are not practised universally by its more radical followers today.  At its inception Islam was enlightend and forgiving.  What happaned to that outlook?  Over time the ideas of Mohammad became entrenched and corrupted, much as with Christianity.

The Middle East never expereinced anything like the Scientific Revolution of the West which inspired the Reniassance.  Free, independent thought are not conducive to state operated theocratic governments.  This is what Islam is.  The religion is both government and state.  There is no seperation between the two.  History has shown that religious regimes tend to be conservetive in their development.

Islam was great in the 6th - 10th centuries.  In the 21st century with its failure to evolve, and with its innate fear of change, it is a dead weight around the neck of nearly every Middle Eastern country.

This film is a great achievement, and although a homage to early Islam one can see why the religion had such appeal to those dusty Arabs of the dessert.  The battle scenes are first-rate and show how intense and intimate these small skirmishes were in early Islam.  Anyone interested in Middle Ages warfare should find these scenes worthwhile.  I would say its one of the highlights of the entire film which can be a bit slow at times.

The extra feature showing the behind scenes efforts is quite extensive and illustates how carefully the director wanted to film this project.  The fact that he had two movies - one in English, the other in Arabic, is quite unique.

Since the religion forbids depictions of its prophet, Muhammad is never shown on screen, nor is his voice heard. The main characters here are Muhammad's adopted son Zaid (Damien Thomas), his uncle Hamza (Anthony Quinn) and a slave named Bilal (Johnny Sekka). Convinced by Muhammad's teachings, they try to revolt against the ruling merchants of Mecca. These merchants don't like the idea of monotheism because it would hurt the economy and they also don't like the idea of slaves and women being equal to men. So Muhammad and his followers are exiled, but the battle is not yet over...

Much of the time, the movie works surprisingly well despite Muhammad's absence, but at times it's rather awkward, even silly. Occasionally, the camera takes his place, having people talk to the camera, apparently getting replies that we, the audience, can't hear. Muhammad does no preaching, instead one of his followes will have to tell the crowd, and the viewers, ""The prophet has said..."". This fails to give the impression of Muhammad as a strong leader, because he doesn't really do anything at all. We also don't get to know him, nor do we get to see his revelations, the way we got to see Moses get the stone tablets on Mount Sinai in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ten-Commandments/dp/B000CNESNA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ten Commandments</a>. The movie may be less offensive to muslims this way, but it's also less effective and convincing for the rest of us. It's also quite difficult for the non-believing viewer to really identify with the religious motivations of the characters.

According to an opening note before the film, it's historicity has been approved by certain Islamic leaders and scholars. Whether it's been approved by other - more neutral - historians, I don't know; the movie ignores the more controversial aspects of Muhammad's life and teachings.

In conclusion, though, while ""The Message"" clearly is a pro-Muslim film that gives us only the good side of the religion, suffers somewhat from lack of a protagonist and is a bit longer than it needed to be, it's still an interesting movie and a good introduction to the early history of Islam, as portrayed by its followers.

As one of my teachers, Dr. Bilal Philips, has said many people became interested in Islam at the time of its theatrical release and started to investigate and ask questions. While from a purely technical standpoint there are some objectionable qualities to this film, for example musical soundtrack, exposure of women (meaning showing more than the face and hands), etc. However, this is best taken in stride seeing as how the scholars at Al-Azhar (the oldest and most prestiguous Islamic University in the world) reviewed this film and approved of it. It is one of the few examples of Islamic epics, the only other one which comes to mind being Lion of the Desert. The producer Mustapha alakkad is perhaps better known for his series of films Halloween.

953236,5,6305020086,"I saw this movie when it was first released on Christmas day in the mid-70's. I own a copy of the video and will be buying the DVD before my video disintegrates! I have to disagree with a lot of the negative reviews posted here. Islam does not permit the portrayal of the face of the Prophet (the movie also chooses not to show the faces of Ali and Abu-Bakr, the first Imam/fourth Caliph and the first Caliph, respectively), so the person who compares this film to Harvey  is demonstrating a complete lack of understanding about something that is of great importance to Muslims. I wish someone would make a film about Jesus that had the sense of reverence not to try to portray someone sent by God. I think the way this aspect is handled is one of the most intelligent things about the movie. Zaid and Hamzah are frequently viewpoint characters, and the viewer (as an artistic and religious choice) is left to intuit Muhammad's words. It must have been an incredible artistic challenge.

I agree some elements are omitted (eg, the Battle of the Trench). Akkad did not have the amount of time Peter Jackson had to present Lord of the Rings; to do a dramatic presentation in less than three hours, you have to leave something out. I am not a Muslim but object to the suggestions that this is a whitewashed job. Scholars like Martin Lings and Hassan Balyuzi present a picture quite consonant with this one. I love the way you feel the thrill of the early Muslims (who, like Christ's early followers, were drawn from the poor and meek) when someone appears with a freshly dictated surah of the Holy Qur'an, and the sense of tension when they know they must be very circumspect about the fact that they are even meeting. I love the depiction of Bilal chanting the first addhan. I love the emphasis on the message of peace and the brotherhood of man and on the spiritual discipline so central to this revelation. I'm in the USA, and I am appalled that for many of my countrymen, Islam is a religion that tells people to fly planes into public buildings. Islam's central message is not unlike that of Jesus. I agree a little historical reading (say the history section of Pickthall's The Meaning of the Glorious Koran) would not be misplaced, but I think for Westerners, this is an excellent introduction. It also gives some context for study of the Qur'an itself --- a tough read for any raised on the more linear text of a book like the Bible, but the true miracle of the Islamic revelation.",1196726400,8,2486,4.546875

953238,5,6305020086,"Essentially, Message is a great movie about a great period in the history of world history, and that is the advent of the last of the great monotheistic religions called Islam. It does well to convey the basic message of Islam and its founder Prophet Muhammed (p.b.u.h.). Of course, the detractors of Islam will not find the movie all that enjoyable. But irrespective of whether one is a Muslim or not, the movie certainly does well to deliver an entertaining panorama of events and action.

The late Moustapha al-Akkad, who also made the film ""Lion of the Desert"", made a film that did all it could to be in sync with Islamic religious sensibilities, but at the same be historicaly accurate. If there is one criticism that could be surmised about the Message was the fact the film failed to zone in on other aspects of Prophet Muhammed's life and message, but being a movie, one cannot simply include everything, which puts the director and film's makers off the hook, so to speak.

I recommed this film for all ages. It's a movie that will be treasured as a classic. One of my P.h. D. friends from Senegal, who teaches African history, used the film to educate his class about Islam, and all the students enjoyed the film immensely. I'm sure coming generations will also enjoy the film.",1187827200,4,1288,4.644736842105263
953239,3,6305020086,"Hollywood has always wanted to have a big named star play Muhammad.  But Islamic law would not allow that to happen as it would be blasphemy to show the image of Muhammad.  However, fellow Muslim Moustapha Akkad found a way to make a film without insulting the masses.  ""The Message"" was an epic film that took 6 years to prepare for and a year to shoot.  Led by Oscar winner Anthony Quinn, the film is very faithful and accurate in its historical value.  However, there are some shortcomings.  One problem is the film's length.  Three hours is way, way too long.  The film could have been chopped off by about an hour and it still would have been able have an effective story to tell.  Another problem is the dialogue. In the film, ""The Message"", Muhammad is referred, but is not seen.  That makes it a little confusing when the characters are referring to Muhammad.  Despite the shortcomings, ""The Message"" gets its point across without insulting the Islamic religion.  This is a film that should be recommended to people of all faiths and will answer lots of buring questions regarding this controversial faith.  Ironically, Moustapha Akkad was killed by a terrorist bombing while attending a wedding in Jordan in 2005.  It appears that some members of the Islamic faith have not followed Muhammad's ""Message"" not to kill fellow Muslims. It shows that Islam still has many obstacles to climb in getting Muhammad's ""Message"" to its followers.",1184544000,6,1444,4.817073170731708
953287,5,6305020086,A profound film on the roots of the Islamic faith.  Granted it was a Hollywood film but nonetheless it got the point across  that there is more similarity between Islam and Christianity than most Americans thought possible.  I would like to make this film a prerequisite for political office.  Right now hatred for Muslims and the Islamic faith is at an all time high and that is very unfortunate.  So unfortunate that it could lead to total anniliation of the human race!  We must learn to deal with other faiths because our lives depend on it.  This film underscored the vast similarities in all  religous beliefs rather than the differences as we so often get in the mainstream press and other media.

953290,4,6305020086,"""The Message"" is a three-hour movie about the life of the Prophet Muhammad. Honoring the Muslim tradition of not portraying Muhammad, the filmmaker took on the interesting challenge of making a film in which we never see or hear the main character. So we get reports on the words and deeds of Muhammad from other characters, or the camera's point of view is Muhammad's point of view.

The film is a faithful portrayal of the Muslim understanding of the story of Muhammad. (Its ""accuracy and fidelity"" were approved by groups of Islamic scholars, both Sunni and Shia.) You'll understand the story better if you already know a bit about the life of Muhammad, but even if you know nothing at all about Muhammad and Islam, you'll be able to follow the basic storyline.

The film is longer than necessary (I thought the battle scenes could've been trimmed down), and something about its 1970s aesthetic occasionally had me expecting Captain Kirk to beam down from Enterprise, but some of the cinematography is beautiful, and all in all, I found this film a great way to learn about Muhammad and the origins of Islam.

I've used large excerpts of this video in teaching Islam, and the students like it. If you'd prefer a shorter presentation of the story of Muhammad, I'd recommend ""Muhammad"" (42 min.) from A&E's Biography series, available as a bonus feature on the DVD ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secrets-of-the-Koran/dp/B000FOQ03W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secrets of the Koran</a>.""

953291,4,6305020086,"It's 3 hours long, but never boring.

Of course it's script was ""Approved"" by various Islamic Scholars, and whatnot, and had the unusual conceit of never showing the Prophet, or giving his character voice [ Except thru a narrator ( The great voice of Richard Johnson ), or by characters relaying his message, and orders, as required by the script ].

This was supposedly in accordance with Muslim beliefs, and meant that his seven wives, his daughters, and his sons-in-law could not be depicted.

This left Mohammed's uncle, played by Quinn, as the central character from the perspective of the newly forming religion.

The characters speak to the Camera when talking, and reacting, to The Prophet, and the Point of view of The Prophet is seen from the cameras view of what is in front of it, especially when he moves around.

This film was made to give voice to a Moderate Islamic perspective of a religion that its practitioners felt was misunderstood, or unjustly characterized by the West.

It fits squarely in the tradition of all the Biblical films familiar to western audiences in the 50's, 60's, and 70's.

The more unsavory facts of the life of Mohammed, the founding of his religion, and the contents of the Koran, of course, are nowhere to be found, but I don't hold that against the filmmakers of the time.

To say that they would not be able to get away with that in the current climate is a waste of time, just as saying that making a reverent film equivalent, in quality, and unfamiliar perspective, to The Last Temptation of Christ would result in protests, and Fatwahs, of the vehemence of the reaction to the recent Danish Cartoons.

The Script does its job in an intelligent, and thoughtful, manner.

The acting, by its 3 famous leads is uniformly excellent, as are the performances of an international cast of Europeans, Arabs, Westerners, and African-Americans, in other important speaking roles.

The most unusual of this last was seeing early Christianity portrayed by Black actors as the King, Advisors, and courtiers of a Kingdom bordering the Arab territories.

The Cinematography is breathtaking, and the several full-scale battles are as well executed as any comparable ones of the time.

The Score was well deserving of its Oscar nomination.

The scenes shown under the closing credits are a reminder that Islam, radical, and moderate, is a religion that has spread around the world, and makes you sit up and take notice of this fact if you haven't already.

The film took 6 years to prepare, and a year to film, and the effort shows in its quality.

This is a film sadly long forgotten, but that should be seen now by anyone who wants to get a little knowledge of Islam unaffected by their own, or any Media's, prejudices.

You will come away from this educational film with an understanding you may not have had before, and may be inclined to look for more information so as to be better informed about the Conflict with Radical Islam that the West has found itself in since at least a year after the release of this film.",1165622400,11,3053,4.741020793950851
953292,5,6305020086,"This is one of the best movie made by Mustafa Akaad. With the limited budget and resources, he still managed to produce an outstanding film that gives a brief introduction to the re-birth of Islam. I say the re-birth of Islam becuase Islam is not a religion that started with Mohammad (PBUH), but Islam started with Adam and all the following prophets that came afterward preached the same message: ""Worship God alone"". Highly recommanded movie.",1164758400,6,445,4.946666666666666

A bonus was that despite the fact that I couldn't find this DVD anywhere else, Amazon delivered it fairly quickly.",1155859200,2,316,4.851851851851852
953294,3,6305020086,"I can give this movie a 'B' for entertainment value, but it gets a 'D' for historical and theological accuracy.  The doctrines the characters express to be that of Islam make it seem that this is just another version of Judaism or Christianity.  It completely ignores those doctrines of violence endemic with Islam.  Also, according to 'The Oxford History of Islam' (available as I write this through Amazon.com), very little is known of Mohammed's actual life and ministry (p. 6), so much of what is believed to be his story is based on traditional yarns that were developed long after he died.  Therefore, this movie should be taken as an approved Islamic narrative that may or may not reflect actual history.

And that is one of my biggest problems with the film - it is at odds with every scholarly history of Islam I've read.  Because most of the surrounding tribes already believed in one God, Mohammed was tolerated by most neighboring tribes.  It was mainly with his own tribe, one that was polytheistic, that he had the problems shown in this movie.  He was more accepted in Medina, with its large Jewish population, and used his years there, after his protector-uncle died, (622-632) to consolidate his power.  Those who challenged Mohammed's claim to being a prophet, and his dogmas, were dealt with harshly - with the loss of their property, enslavement or execution.  So much for his doctrines of charitable treatment of people, humility, etc.  Eventually, when he had gathered enough followers to form an army, he went to a neighboring tribe and demanded that they convert to Islam.  When they refused, the historical record reports that his army killed about 10,000 tribesmen.  Then, his followers used this example of what happens to those Mohammed viewed to be infidels to convince other tribes to convert to Islam.

This movie accurately shows that Mohammed's people were frequently, if not almost always, fighting for their religion.  What is dishonest about the movie is that it was mainly against his own tribe he fought for defense; in virtually all other cases he was involved in offensive battles to further Islam.  This is an attribute of Islam that continues to this day; just look at the declarations of fundamentalist Moslems today.

Violence in Islam is not only focused on non-Muslims; just look at the different factions of Islam in any newspaper today.  Indeed, in the history of Islam, there have been only one or two Caliphs who died a natural death; all others were murdered.  [This would be somewhat equivalent to only one or two Popes dying a natural death; all others being killed by a Cardinal who then made himself Pope.]  So, my main objection with this movie is that it shows Islam as just trying to survive in a hostile world, when in reality it was Islam that used violence and  barbarity to advance its cause.

Therefore, if one is interested in a good yarn, one can watch this movie in that light and enjoy it.  One can watch it to get some sense of what life might have been like in Seventh Century Arabia.  However, if one is interested in historical accuracy, they should read the many scholarly histories of Islam.",1153353600,25,3164,4.805914972273568
953295,5,6305020086,I purchased this movie because someone recommended it to me. It is a beautiful look at the world of Islam and how it came to be.

953296,4,6305020086,"The reaction of Muslims to cartoons of the prophet Muhammad in a Danish newspaper were hardly surprising since I recalled how when ""The Message"" was released in 1976 the publicity that talk about how Muhammad was not depicting on screen in the film.  What I learned in finally watching the film is that this also meant that the voice of the prophet could not be heard as well, and that his immediate family (wives, daughters, sons-in-law) are also covered by this prohibition.  This means there are moments in the film where actors address the camera directly, which represents Muhammad's point of view and pause as they listen to dialogue that is not being spoken.  Anthony Quinn plays Hamza, an uncle of Muhammad, and becomes one of several key figures, including Bilal ibn Ribah (Johnny Sekka), who explain and accept Muhammad's teachings.

The key thing about this film is that the title tells you what it is really about, which is to say ""The Message"" rather than the messenger.  There are biographical elements of Muhammad's life presented, usually as exposition by other characters when talking about the prophet, but what matters more are the beliefs espoused by the faithful.  This is not to say that there are not fascinating historical details, such as how it was decided that the faithful would be called to prayer by a human voice rather than a horn or drum, and the story of Muhammad being saved from death by a web spun by a spider, because clearly there are some key events depicted in the film.  But mostly it is the declarations of faith that will stand out in the minds of the audience.  The fact that there will be relatively few viewers who will not learn something about Islam from watching this film that speaks to exactly why it should be seen.

The University of Al-Azhar in Cairo and the High Islamic Congress of the Shiat in Lebanon endorsed the accuracy of the film, and while it was banned in many Middle Eastern countries, it was because objections were raised to the making of a commercial film about Muhammad, and not because of doctrinal concerns.  The film is directed by Moustapha Akkad, who made an Arabic version, ""al-Ris?lah,"" with different actors on the same sets on which he filmed ""The Message.""  He only other film as a director was 1981's ""Lion of the Desert,"" which reunited him with Anthony Quinn, but I suspect most people will remember his name as being the executive producer of the ""Halloween"" films.  However, Akkad deserves more credit as a producer for getting the film made than he does for what he brings to it behind the camera as the director.

The educational value of this film far outweighs it cinematic merits.  At 177 minutes it runs a bit long because of the number of battle sequences in which the audience has no real appreciation for what is going on.  What matters are the victories and how they advanced the cause of Islam, and not the tactics on those battlefields.  Besides, during these battles there are long stretches without dialogue and troops matching around in the desert, which do feature Maurice Jarre's Oscar nominated score.  The best parts of this film are when these figures from history are talking about the beliefs and tenets of Islam, and the worst are the melodramatic parts, which usually involve Irene Pappas as Hind, whose emotionalism runs against the tenor of the rest of the cast, exemplified by not only Quinn but Michael Ansara as Abu Sofyan, the leading merchant of Mecca.  Keeping clear who these characters are might be difficult, but understanding what they believe will be easier and much more important.

I would be shocked if there was another movie made devoted to either the life of Muhammad or the rise of Islam, so ""The Message"" is going to be the only dramatization of those subjects available to teachers to show their students.  If I could cut a third of this film its educational value could be doubled, but even with its flaws this film is going to teach them more about Islam that any textbook chapter or documentary of talking heads and ancient artwork.  As for ""The Message"" constituting an effort at conversion, I do not see that to be the case.  What I expect is that students, seeing a choice between the three hundred and sixty tribal gods kept in the Kaaba by the merchants of Mecca who set themselves up as the overlords of Arabia, and the monotheism declared by Muhammad that also established the equality of slave and master in the eye of God, will agree with the faithful in this film as to which path to choose.  There should be some fascinating classroom discussions after watching this film, and being reissued this year on DVD as a 30th-anniversary edition should increase the chances of that happening.",1145491200,13,4731,4.742682926829269
953337,5,6305020086,"I've just finished watching this movie (the Arabic version) and I really loved it. As an Egyptian, I always heard about this movie but never had the chance to see it. I finally got the DVD and was not disappointed. What reminded me of the movie was the terrible news I heard about its director, Mr. Mustapha Al Akkad, who was killed in a terrorist bombing in Jordon. Ironically, he was killed by one of the ignorants trying the hijack the same religion he spent his life trying to defend and show its true teachings. I was also sad because, before his death, he was preparing for a new huge epic movie about the legend Saladdin, the defeater of the crusaders. Al akkad directed another great epic movie in the past called Lion of the Dessert, which I highly recommend as well.

This movie is so accurate that at one point I started thinking that it's more of a documentary than a regular movie. For western viewers, the movie could work as a quick crash course on Islam and its beginnings. The information provided in the movie, based on my readings in Islamic history books, is 100% authentic.

Some people might not enjoy the movie because the main character, prophet Muhammad (PBUH), does not appear in it. for Muslims, the depiction of any prophet is prohibited. That's another reason why I appreciated the movie more, because the movie makers were sensitive to the Muslim world and respectful to its culture. After all, it is a movie about Muslims.

I definitely recommend it to western viewers who want to educate themselves about this religion. Worst case scenario, even if you don't like the movie, you will still learn a lot about Islam and its early struggles, and will definitely grow more respect for this amazing religion. But I'm sure most people will like the movie, because it's really well made. So it's a win win situation.

The acting is very poor and some of the transitions in the movie are a little disjointed.

The most annoying thing is that the main character (Mohammed)is never seen.  This is reminescent of the rabbit Harvey in the movie ""Harvey"" with Jimmy Stewart.  Harvey's invisibility added to the comedy, but ""The Message"" is not trying to be funny.  There are many times when it is not clear who a character is speaking to because he is looking at the camera or at nothing.

953407,5,6305020086,"""The Message"" tells the story of the birth of Islam, from the Prophet Muhammad's first revelation from God to his death. The film follows the Prophet's story (though never showing the Prophet himself, as Islamic tradition ordains) as he starts with a handful of believers, and over the coarse of 23 years, establishes a mighty force that shook the world. The story is most excellent. The script was well written and approved for its accuracy in telling the story of the Prophet. The actors are wonderful in portraying the people who were in involved the Prophet's life. Anthony Quinn is simply magnificent as Hamza, the Prophet's uncle. The cinematography of the film is breathtaking. The Oscar-nominated music for the film by Maurice Jarre is phenomenal. The director, Moustapha Akkad, could not have done a better job. This film is without a doubt a perfect 10.

Now, about the special features: The film comes in two discs, the first is the English version of the film and the second is the Arabic version of the film. The two versions of the film were shot together by two separate casts. Akkad originally made the film so he would have an instrument to teach his children the history of their faith, as well as the general public at large. And since he had established his life in California, he initially wanted to make the film in English. He then realized he wanted to pay homage to the religion by presenting it in the language that the events happened in, so he made a valiant effort to bring together actors from the Arab world to play the parts in the film. The film is handsomely presented in anamorphic widescreen. The sound is presented in its original Stereo 2.0 surround sound mix. Both the video and audio have been remastered for this release. The DVD also includes an enlightening commentary track by Producer/Director Moustapha Akkad on both versions of the film (English commentary for the English version of the film and Arabic commentary for the Arabic version of the film). Also, there is a Making of an Epic: Mohammad - Messenger of God (the working title for the film) that runs for approximately 44 minutes.

953409,5,6305020086,"I must salute Mustapha Akkad for making an English language film on Islam and casting world-renowned actors Anthony Quinn, Michael Ansara and Irene Papas in prominent roles. This was a wonderful marketing strategy on his part to generate mass appeal for the film. It's unfortunate this never materialised into a blockbuster when it was released in 1976, at least in the US anyway.

I for one was ignorant of its existence until some Muslim students from university mentioned its screening at an art theatre in Denver, back in the early 1980's. Like most non-Muslim Americans the film meant little to me at the time. It wasn't until I emigrated to Malaysia that I did see it and realised what a thoroughly informative film it was...and still is.

Whether you are Muslim or non-Muslim, ""The Message: The Story of Islam"" is an excellent primer to understanding the life of the Prophet Mohammad, the early history of Islam and the basic beliefs of the religion.

In keeping with Islamic teachings, even the Prophet Mohammad is never seen. For some viewers unaware of this fact, it might seem strange and contribute to the occasional ""wooden"" performance of the actors. Despite this and having seen countless Islamic-related films dealing with the Prophet Mohammad, his family and close associates in Arabic and Bahasa Malaysia, I can assure you the message is more relevant than the craftwork of the actors or director. ""The Message: The Story of Islam"" is no different in this respect.

Previously released under the title  ""Mohammad: Messenger of God"", this 30th anniversary edition comes with two DVDs. One is in the English language and the other in Arabic, which I suppose was originally offered in the respective regions where these languages are spoken. The Arabic version is of particular interest should you prefer to listen to the linguistic nuances of the selected Quranic verses. There is also an interactive menu on each DVD, allowing the viewer to see a documentary on the making of the film and a running commentary from the director -- if you wish to hear -- while viewing the film. The DVD video transfer looks great and the audio is adequate.

953410,4,6305020086,"A film to watch if you wish to know something of the history of Islam and/or life of the Prophet Muhammad without having to read through the many books that are on the market (although reading Martin Lings' book is a good start) This film has been approved by both Sunni and Shi'ite scholars thus you can be assured of a pretty balanced view of the life of the Prophet which is agreed upon by all schools of Islamic thought. It is also shown on TV in most Muslim countries during the month of Ramadan which should give you some idea of the importance that this film has in the Muslim world.

One point though, you will not see the Prophet as it is considered blasphemous in Islam (something which is explained at the beginning of the film) and this may come across as a little strange to anyone who is used to seeing films depicting Jesus or Moses but you do get used to it.

The acting also can be a little 'corny' and 'wooden' at times but much of that has to do with the era the film was made. The DVD also comes with the Arabic version of the film which has slightly different scenes (for those who are native speakers of Arabic) and a short documentary showing the making of the film. On that note I wished they would have had better subtitles options(Turkish for example would have been useful) and a few other European languages as a film of this importance really needs to have more exposure (this film has been dubbed into Turkish and I am sure into a few other languages why didn't they have this option on the DVD?)

Still, the film covers all of the major events in the life of the Prophet and several of the major figures (Blial, Hamza etc) I would have given this film 5 stars were it not for the lack of language choice and subtitles.

Otherwise well worth watching.",1123718400,7,1781,4.323353293413174
953411,5,6305020086,"I can't believe this movie is not given the recognition it deserves. Being one of the only movies in its category it is actually very impressive with brilliant roles by the likes of Anthony Quinn.

One of the reasons maybe because it is only a brief insight (the very beginning) of the vast history of Islam. Its a great film for non-muslims and muslims alike (ie, christians will possibly identify with the persecution of the early believers, etc).

The movie although being a story about the message of Islam doesn't actually show it in detail, due to the fact that the prophet (his family and his close companions) are all regarded with great respect and it would be a kind of blasphemy to even try to portray them on film.

A great way to get around this is actually buying a biography of the prophet (the one by the western writer Dr Martin Lings is highly recommended) - will move you emotionally at times as you actually get an amazing insight into the lives and the sheer presence of the prophet and his close companions.

Hopefully after viewing the film and reading the biography of the prophet you should get a better insight into the vast world of Islam. The more knowledge you seek the more you will be enlightened and rewarded.

One things for sure you will never truly understand Islam until you read the Quran (the source of light for THE WHOLE OF MANKIND) - highly recommended translation is again by a western writer Mr Pickthall.",1116720000,6,1448,4.596899224806202

The movie was perfectly set in order. The reason they do not show the prophet's face, is out of respect. Muhammad is a Prophet, not a character out of a movie. It is the same respect that Christian's, in other such like movies, do not show the face of GOD. This movie, shows you the trials and tribulations of muslims. Islam is a religion of peace. And those that have read the Holy Koran (Q'uran) know all about that. I myself have recently converted. This is a wonderful movie, for anyone, wishing to convert, or anyone who just wants to know a little bit more about Islam and Muslims.",1115942400,3,607,4.468468468468468
953413,3,6305020086,"Wanting to educate myself about Islam and having read the rave reviews about this film on this site, I decided to order it and I watched it with great interest. However, besides being intrigued and impressed, I was also disappointed.

The movie has a great dramatic flair and has some very beautiful scenes visually and musically. This however hides some shortcomings in the plot and characters. There is a short introductory part about how the movement in question came about, inspired by the example and ideas of a poet-prophet, apparently guided by a supreme and only deity. The movement seems to react to a corrupt and immoral society, fighting against all odds for justice and righteousness. The main part of the movie is about their fight. They heroically succeed. So far, so good.

Then why is this message not really convincingly conveyed by this movie, leading to my disappointment with it? There are several reasons.

Firstly, the goodies and the baddies are too one-dimensionally portrayed, making them not true to life and damaging their credibility. They are either too good to be true or so thoroughly bad, that it lacks credibility for a viewer embedded in a post-modern world used to self-reflection and self-criticism.

Secondly, the main character, the poet-prophet in question, is never heard or seen, except by allusion, in a way which has an unintended spooky or comical effect on the viewer, further damaging the credibility of the story, unfortunately.

Thirdly, the onset of the drama is not sufficiently worked out to really cause one to identify and sympathise with the protagonists. One is mainly made to sympathise with them, because they are shown to suffer unnecessarily violent persecution and one is supposed to be convinced of their goodness by the overly theatrically staged phrases of common wisdom they utter to each other.  Their inner motivations however are not sufficiently placed against or supported by any real insight into their historical background and context. This makes the plot regrettably shallow. Likewise, the idol worshipers and greedy or dishonest merchants who are the antagonists are not fully rounded persons, but merely amusingly nasty figures. The idols also are supposed to be made unlikeable by making them look as ridiculous as possible, but this merely makes them look funny.

I would have liked to see more about the personal history and inner struggle of the prophet and more about the conflict between the parties, showing good and bad people on both sides, to be really touched by the story and message, which I assume is the original intention of the maker. I suppose this is for me the main lack of this film. Maybe in future a more convincing and balanced film could be made about this crucial episode of human history. That would require a script writer and director who can look at this story not only with passion, but also with a critical and scholarly eye, keeping in mind the mentality of the modern audience.

For believers this film might be inspiring and heartening through its emotional thrust and dramatic combination of scenery and music, but for others I'm afraid it will be no more than a nice period piece and costume drama that could just as well have been titled ""The invisible holy man versus the hysterical evil woman"".",1111104000,4,3309,4.981884057971015
953414,5,6305020086,A wonderful and Islamicly respectful depiction of the life of the prophet. For those wondering why the prophet and his strongest companions were not shown it is because the director took the advice of the scholars. it is almost rude to the islamic faith to try and attach a face to such people as the prophet PBUH or Abu Bakr or Omar. These are the greatest men of the religion and portraying them the director (rightfully so) thought that it would cheapen the effect.,1110153600,6,468,4.583333333333333

Granted, some elements of the production may seem dated now. But the overall effect, and heroic and herculean effort of producing such a movie to begin with, overshadow this small flaw. It is a classic in what will be a growing genre of Islamic cinema.

It also has the needed effect of demonstrating the true essense and humble beginnings of the religion of Islam: something that is desperatly needed in today's world.

I do volunteer work as an Imam (Islamic ""minister"") in the prisons in New York City. It is a tradition in some facilities to show this movie during Ramadan.

I read the reviews the preceeded mine. A complaint that came up is that Muhammad himself was never shown. One must understand that this is part of the essense of Islam in that it rejects idolarty in all its forms. To show the person of Muhammad would threaten the spirituality of the Message he was sent to give us. The director solved this problem in a very ingenous manner.

Perhaps in the future, some ambitious director will attempt a remake of this film. I eagerly anticipate seeeing it; as well as other dramatic (or comedic!) films made from the Muslim perspective.

Unfortunately he skipped the human part of the prophet. The movie forgot to explain what the message was. ""PEACE"".

It tries to be a factual and informative movie while not trangressing the limits set by Islam such as not seeing the person of Muhammad and some companions. This epic is certainly moving, it captures the essence of Islam and preaches the Oneness of God, and that Muhammad is His Messenger. It chronicles the life of Muhammad S.A.W. from when he received the first Divine Message up till his end. It examines the tribulations and greatness of prophet Muhammad (p.b.u.h.) and tries to keep as though the viewer is there among them. Truly a captivating experience. I recommend it highly for Muslims to deepen their knowledge of Islamic history and also especially for non-muslims so that they may know and understand the message of Islam, what not with the bad protrayal of Islam by the media nowadays.

953482,3,6305020086,"This DVD product is not up to the standards of current DVDs. It's most glaring omission is English subtitles. Fortunately, it's the kind of film that sets a stately pace (to match the  solemnity of the topic), and the actors speak in crisp, easily understandable voices...most of the time.
Since the original film was done in two versions, I think it is about time that they rereleased this in a Special Edition. It would be interesting to see the Arabic version of the film with English subtitles. As it is, you only get a hint of the second version in the Arabic trailer on the current product.
I also found the stills gallery irksome. It isn't a gallery, but a slide show, with loud music playing throughout. It would be nice if there were an option to view the stills without all the sturm and drang.
The film itself is a decent religious/historical drama. Most of the acting is quite well done. There are some truly moving moments in this film: my favorite was when a former slave speaks up and defends a possible convert who is having doubts. What he has to say about the issue of doubts struck me as one of the wisest things I have ever heard in a film about any religion.
Another reviewer here lauded the battle scenes, but I would have to disagree with that. The battle scenes were almost laughable by today's standards. Yet, that is really not so important within the context of the whole. This is a film about the birth of one of the world's major religions, not ""Lord of The Rings.""
I recommend this film to anyone interested in a dramatic treatment of the birth of Islam. I think it would be particularly useful to teachers teaching about this period of world history, as crucial elements can be presented easily in isolation on the DVD, whereas with the VHS version you would have some fearsome fast forwading to do.
Dare I say this last part? I found the refusal to show Mohammed somewhat gimmicky. Whenever Mohammed is in a scene, the camera shifts to a point of view looking out of his eyes, accompanied by some eerie music to indicate the shift in perspective. I think they could have dealt with this in much the same way that ""Ben Hur"" dealt with showing Jesus. You saw his feet and hands in the frame, or his back, but his face was never shown. If he was turned toward the camera his face was in dark shadow. That, in my humble opinion, would have been a better technique for portraying Mohammed in this picture.",1076630400,27,2432,4.4774774774774775

953484,5,6305020086,"Mustafa Akkad, the man who also brought us Lion Of The Desert, directs and produces The Message. The film is based on the story of Islam and the prophethood of Muhammed, peace and blessings be upon him. Islam in Arabic means 'submission to God', a Muslim is one who accepts Islam and therefore is a 'submitter to God' All prophets before Muhammed had been sent down with the same message of truth; to submit to God and worship Him alone. The Message reveals this as much as it reflects the true prophethood of Muhammed and the revelation of the Quran being the last revelation that God sent down to mankind.
The film is well acted. Anthony Quinn plays the role of Hamza Bin Abdul Mutalib, the prophet's uncle, who was one of the first people to accept the message that his nephew had been sent with, one of the greatest warriors and early martyrs in Islam. The film is also beautifully shot in the deserts of North Africa.
I recommend this film to all Muslims and non-Muslims. For the Muslims, this film will be an engaging and very emotional experience. For the non-Muslims, it will be a good lesson in knowing and understanding the truth and essence of Islam and how its message is universal and true.
Muhammed, peace be upon him, is not portayed on screen because it is forbidden to resemble any prophet by another person even for artistic reasons. This does not apply only to prophet Muhammed, peace be upon him; but also to Jesus, Moses, Abraham, Noah, David and all other prophets peace and blessings be upon all of them.

953485,3,6305020086,"I have only studied a small amount of the rich history of Mohammed, the Koran, and Islam, so I cannot vouch for the historic accuracy or even the message delivered by the movie.  All prophets of peace are, of course, needed badly in this world.
  As a movie, however, this leaves much to be desired.  The writing is stilted and tedious, the acting only passable (even by fine actors), and the movie suffers from prophet-worship.  Mohammed is portrayed as a disembodied figure and the other actors either stick their faces into the camera for very one-sided conversations or simply announce to each other what the prophet said.
  Movies about Moses, David, Jesus, and other religious figures portray their subjects as human, keeping God as the disembodied voice or burning bush or what-not.  In this movie Mohammed takes this invisible form, instead of being humanized by an actor, and therefore is equated with God.
  If The Ten Commandments had shown Moses-the-disembodied-voice telling Pharaoh to free the slaves, or if films about Jesus portrayed him only as a golden light (the way a recent Disney movie did Mohammed), the producers would have been accused of deifying those characters.  It would be better to show the Prophet as a man than to make him the equivalent of the burning bush.
  Also, it makes the script very ponderous, difficult for the actors, and quite repititious:  ""Hey, Mohammed says God said this!""  Hey, the Prophet says God said that!"" is heard over and over again.  The Message would be better served by having Mohammed come to the people directly and telling them what God said, and leave out the middlemen.",1069891200,5,1635,4.890909090909091

Another point is that the person of the Holy Character of Prophet Mohammed, his family and some of his companions don't show.. not even the backs at least - if they didn't want to show faces.

953645,1,6305020086,"I really had been looking forward to this movie, and expected a lot better of it. Yes, the acting was passable, and the writing was interesting- but it made for interesting historical fiction. It was certainly based on the lives of real people, but the comparison with reality ended there. It became more a propagandistic whitewash of true events, not corresponding to historical criticism, the Qur'an, or the Hadith. For an interesting story, it's OK. But for a movie that claims to be history it falls far short.

There are glaring omissions throughout the movie- such as the wives and concubines of Mohammed (pbuh), Mohammed's (pbuh) raids during the months of truce, and the raids he initiated on caravans throughout the year, the Battle of the Trench, and the presence of strong Jewish tribes in Yathrib (later Medina). Often issues that would not paint a sympathetic view of Mohammed (pbuh) were obscured or left out. The movie suggests that the followers of Mohammed (pbuh) would not initiate attacks and tried to avoid fighting- but this directly contradicts the historical record, the Qur'an, and the Hadith! Indeed, the Muslims became strong through the acquiring of wealth from raids, an accepted practice of the time, as long as it did not occur during the months of truce. The movie portrays his followers as going so far as to say that they are men of peace. At the same time the attacks on Mohammed's (pbuh) followers in Mecca are greatly exaggerated, as there is little evidence of real physical persecution. In the movie Mohammed (pbuh) is seen immediately as the leader of all of Medina, with all Medinans immediately submitting to Islam. But the town was called Yathrib, a Jewish name, for a reason- the Jewish tribes remained there until they were expelled much later by the Muslims. And Mohammed (pbuh) was seen as the leader of his followers only and as an unbiased arbitrator within Yathrib for a long time, as first among chiefs rather than ruler, gaining true civil authority only towards the end of his life.

Lastly the act of not showing the image or displaying the voice of Mohammed (pbuh) greatly detracts from the artistic merit of the movie, making many scenes confusing and frankly silly, as everyone looks in the direction of the camera for the unseen audience to respond. The end result is ironically to create an almost god-like portrayal of Mohammed (pbuh) as he is an unseen powerful presence throughout the movie.

Due to religious purposes, the figure of Mohammed is never seen or heard in the film.  If the other characters are talking to him, then they are either looking just off camera or looking at the camera.  He is assumed to be there, but you will need to work with the film.  I don't think that it detracts from the film at all.
The movie starts prior to Mohammed's vision and finishes when his followers arrive in Mecca.  If I had to think of an equivalent for the production, I would compare with the Ten Commandments.  Both movies are done on a grand scale.  The music reminds me of Lawrence of Arabia.

The main problem with this film is that it is a whitewash of Islam and it only shows the nice side of Muhammed and his Islam! Sort of like reading about Islam from a John Esposito or Karen Armstrong POV ad nauseum!
It would have been much more interesting and true to the Facts if it showed some of the more unappealing aspects of Muhammed and Islam ie: Muhammed ordering the brutal execution of 800 innocent Jews, Muhammeds ordering of the execution of poets that made satire of him, Muhammed's marriage and consummation to Aiesha when she was only 9 years of age and he was 53, Muhammed raiding and looting Caravans from Medina and many other unsavory aspects of Muhammeds character!
Whilst the man was not entirely bad, he was far from being the Angel that this fictional account portrayed him as..
It is important to remember that while watching this film which one can still derive some pleasure from!

Although it features film stars with whom many of us will already be familiar, Irene Pappas, Anthony Quinn and Michael Ansara, it was directed by a Moslem director,  Moustapha Akkad, and has the stamp of approval of the Al Azhar Mosque and University (the oldest University in the world and an institution much respected in the Islamic world for its Koran scholarship).
While it carries a religious message for Islamic people--in fact I saw parts of it again on Saudi TV as part of the Ramadan season's celebration while I  was working in Tabouk--it also explains in a sympathetic way for Western viewers many of the basic tenets of Islam.  It is as moving a story in its own way as the stories of the New Testament are for Christians, and it portrays the essence of what Moslems believe about Mohamed and their faith.  The simplicity and straight forwardness of the tale as it portrays the sacrifices of plain people for their convictions and the ultimate triumph of good over evil will appeal to anyone with a sense of fair mindedness regardless of ones religious convictions.  The light in which it places Christians cannot fail to impress.  Mohamed's more vulnerable followers are told to seek asylum with the King of Abyssinia (modern day Ethiopia), because as a Christian king he was their ""brother"" and bound by the ""book"" to protect them from their oppressors, which indeed he does!  Nor are the Jews spoken ill of in the tale.
The actual cinematography is a little dated, and the story can be a little postured, but no more than any other film of the 1960-1970s.

And show the bright side of the prophet friends (Sahabah) and how brave they were and it clear the reasons for having Jehad in Islam, specially for the part that shows the Sahaba and other Muslims want to revenge from whom destroy their lives but the prophet disagreed as God did not give the permission, and later when it was given God (ALLAH Subhanahu wa Taala) give them the permission only to fight whom thrown them from their own homes and properties for the only reason that they became Muslims and say that ALLAH (Aazza wa Jalla) is their God and they were not permitted to kill any kid or women or even to cut a tree. The movie show how Islam is the religion of love, no matter what color is the person even if the person is a black poor slave, like Bilal, he can be of a very big positions, and that only depend on his faith and love to ALLAH Taala and to Islam. It shows also how wealth and money are of no importance to Muslims, and how they are willing to spend them to free a slave and let him enjoy his right to live as a human (As Abu Bakker did). And once ALLAh (Alrahman Al Raheem) accept to forgive all the faults of a person just because he believe in ALLAH (Al Ghafoor) and Mohammed (S) as a messenger of God, a person would wants to thank him by offering all what he have of gold and money to serve Islam (as Khalid bin Al Waleed did). It shows how Muslims are brave (like Hamzza) and are free to say the truth and are ready to face any one of any strength if he is unjust or despotic. And because they have discovered the joy of Islam and how it provides Muslims with self-esteem, self-respect, dignity, and all other nice meanings, and they were ready to sacrifice and defend Islam even by their lives (like Ali Bin Abee Taleb (Peace on him)), only to preserve Islam and make sure that those nice meanings and nice feelings reach as much people as possible",1010361600,9,2159,4.255474452554744

The recent tragic events in US has peaked the curiosity of a lot of non-muslims and this movie briliently tells the story as it was. Specially the scenes that show the original converts to the faith seeking refuge and protection from an Ethiopian Christian king are extremely moving.

September 11, 2001 tragedy at the Twin Towers and the Pentagon  really made me angry, but as alot of other Americans I too
became interested in finding out more about Islam, reading
some books, surfing the web and finally borrowing this video
from my local library. I really wanted to know if Islam was
indeed an evil religion that preached only hate and killing
of innocent people like it's protrayed by the media. Anyway
I viewed this 3 hour film , and to my amazement, I was truly
enlightened by it. It preached about equality for all races,
and touched upon the recognition of all the prophets: Abraham,
Isaac, Ismael, Moses, Isaiah and Jesus. They truly recognize Jesus and his teachings ( MUSLIMS BELIEVE JESUS WAS A PROPHET
NOT THE SON OF GOD NOR THAT HE WAS GOD ). They even recognized the miracle birth of Jesus and they hold virgin Mary at high esteem. In this movie I felt the message of BROTHERHOOD come through. the brotherhood preached in this movie is to ""WANT FOR YOUR BROTHER WHAT YOU WOULD WANT FOR YOURSELF"" there is no lower classes or higher classes only equality for all. Islam believes in ""ONE GOD"" and we are all ""ONE PEOPLE"" all of us ""BROTHERS AND SISTERS."" My next step for me  now is to read the ""KORAN"" to
get the full understanding of ISLAM.
The reason why I didn't give this movie 5 stars is because you never get to see Prophet Muhammad's face or body or him speaking
due to religious belief in respect to Islam not to show him.
All in all the director did an outstanding job and I commend him
100%, it was truly a well made film . I hope someday the Islamic clerics will allow an updated film about Prophet Muhammad and Islam....only this time showing the character of Muhammad just like Jesus is protrayed in ""King of Kings' and ""Jesus of Nazerth""
or Moses in ""The Ten Commadments"". Having a character play the role of a hero like Muhammad would send Islam spreading around the globe faster then ever.
I recommend this movie to anybody interested in learning about Islam. Muslims and non-Muslims and to the Muslims that don't really know enough about their religion. So far based on my reasearch and viewing this movie I can simply say that Islam
is a religion of peace not hate. I can see why Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world including here in America.
The terrorists in this world do not represent true Islam, they
represent Satan.

953717,3,6305020086,"Originally released as ""Mohammad: Messenger of God"" in 1976 and more recently on DVD as ""THE MESSAGE"" (Anchor Bay, ...), this lavish, nearly four hour epic focuses on the life and impact of Abu al-Qasim Muhammad ibn 'Abd Allah ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib ibn Hashim, the founder of Islam, who was born about 1,600 years ago in Mecca.  Orphaned at six and trained to be a merchant, Mohammad received the prophetic call in a series of visions that later were recorded as the Koran.
The movie never actually shows an image of Mohammad.  A respectful religious conceit that works. Sometimes the camera assumes his point of view or cuts to his companions. Anthony Quinn stands out as warrior Uncle Hamza.
The film begins in 610 A.D. at Ka'bah where pagans worship over 300 idols and merchants rule the sacred community.  For three days, Mohammad has been secluded in the mountains receiving visions from Allah via the angel Gabriel. A small group of believers meet secretly before openly proclaiming His monotheistic message of mercy and love to the locals. But these rebels are attacked and the survivors flee.
The film straightforwardly presents the traditional events in the history of Islam.  It also makes clear Mohammad's true message of mercy and peace, a far cry from the interpretation of extremists attempting to ignite a jihad.  There are over 1.5 billion practicing Moslems in the world and it is currently the fastest growing religion.  Attention must be paid.  The film produced and directed by Moustapha Akkad, boasts spectacular production values and a memorable score by Maurice Jarre.  Irene Papas and Michael Ansara co-star.  Filmed on location in the Sahara Desert, Morocco and Libya.  There's a bonus making of documentary.",1000857600,5,1732,5.045614035087719
953718,4,6305020086,"This movie is a wonderful depiction of the life of the Prophet (pbuh) and the conquest of Islam over the hearts of many. Although it has some historical inaccuracies, it is generally true to the history and true to the spirit of Islam and Muslims. The movie attempts to go beyond the stereotypes and insecurities often cited by people living in the West, and in fact displays Islam as a religion that has the same roots as its Judeo-Christian brother-faiths. Besides the spiritual and historical content, this movie is well-shot and excellently directed. The scenes of battle are particularly delightful to watch, whereas the scenes involving the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) are impressive and inspiring (all done without ever showing the person of Muhammad, pbuh). Overall, this is a wonderfully made movie. Definitely a must-watch for all, regardless of ethnicity or religion.",998956800,5,874,5.205673758865248

This film along with the others I mentioned are excellent for showing nonmuslims the true history of Islam in the form of a feature motion picture.  As a muslim, I found some renewed motivation after watching the film.  One of the particularly poignant parts of the film is the ending.  MuHammad's (peace be upon him) last speech is given then there is a narration along with a montage of different adhaans and scenes of different muslims from around the world praying.  This film not surprisingly was never shown on US television (correct me if I'm wrong).  Yet there have been tons of films shown on TV about Jesus and Christianity.  None of the films I've seen on Jesus and Christianity have had the same effect on me which ""The Message"" did.  All of the films on Jesus and Christianity seem too much like fantasy and make believe.

Not just Anthony Quinn and Irene Pappas but all the others appear to be uplifted and acting at the same elevated level. It must be the best hidden secret in all the history of cinema and in a way I am glad it never got an oscar because that would have given in a common place among other films. This is really more than a film. After seeing it you can almost hear your own soul telling you that this is the truth. This is a view to the past.

It gave me an understanding of Mohammed and Islam that I lacked while I was growing up. If you ever wanted to know why Mecca and  Medina are important to Muslims or what Mohammed really did, you should  watch this movie. It won't convert you to Islam, but it will give you a  better understanding of the religion and some of its history. HOWEVER -  here is the bad news - the fact that the camera is never allowed to show  Mohammed is (in my opinion) a serious negative.  If I wasn't interested in  Islam and its history, I would not want to watch this movie.  You could  make the arguement that Jesus is portrayed too much in movies, but to watch  a movie where you can't see the main character is annoying. Okay, now that  I got past that unpleasantness, I still give the movie 4 stars because I  did enjoy it. I suppose most devout Muslims have already seen this movie,  but I would strongly suggest that Christians and other Westerners also  watch it to get a better understanding of Islam.
