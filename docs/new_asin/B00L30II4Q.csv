8663495,3,B00L30II4Q,"The performances in this version of the Tempest are outstanding; however, the picture quality is very poor.  This is copy on DVD of the 1960 television broadcast of the play.  The images are blurry, pixelated and even grainy at times.  The picture quality of this production is technically inferior, but that is due to the technology used at the time of the broadcast.  Based on the picture quality I would rate this production a one (1); however, based on the quality of the acting I rate this television adaption of the play a three (3).  If you can get past the picture quality, this is a very good adaption of the play.  The cast is very  talented",1498262400,,651,4.512820512820513

8663497,5,B00L30II4Q,"Superb  1960 TV HALLMARK taped version of Shakespeare's play, headed by a cast
you'd never get live in a theater: Maurice Evans, Richard Burton, Lee Remick,
and an astonishing Roddy McDowall.  Well-directed and incredibly designed.
A fascinating and entertaining production in vivid color.  Highly recommended.",1419033600,2,310,5.844444444444444
