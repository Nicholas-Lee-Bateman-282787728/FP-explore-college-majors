It is a better film than Bomb It or The Legend of Cool ""Disco"" Dan. Recommend for folks into graffiti or ""street art"". Great doc!",1452124800,,271,4.230769230769231
8541088,5,B009G3GHSG,"This is an interesting work, and to me, the most interesting aspects have to do with where the film makers' stated motivations and values wind up being opposed to their vocal protests when others subject them to the same actions and justifications which they champion against others. The most obvious incident is one where their arguments about objects in the public space, as legitimate targets of graffiti, suddenly evaporate when the object is their own camera.

Either this work is a subversive attack on the culture it claims to defend... or the film makers are actually clueless about the inconsistencies and hypocrisy they engage in. Either way, they make a good and honest case against the actions they claim to embrace, at least when they are protecting their property rights in the ways they claim others shouldn't.",1436918400,,825,5.021897810218978
