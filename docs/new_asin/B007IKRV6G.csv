5089465,4,B007IKRV6G,"I saw this documentary at a public showing and bought it to share with my family.  We ride bicycles, my children are runners (completing various marathons) and my husband was a sailplane (glider) pilot as was Mr. Foster.  I worked for an architect in my post-college days and maintained my interest in building design and city planning.  What a fascinating film!",1372896000,,362,4.901639344262295
5089466,5,B007IKRV6G,"Aerial shot of the Millau Viaduct, voice over narration ""We had forgotten that useful things could be this beautiful."" From the perspective of the crumbling infrastructure of the United States, this movie presents some alternative examples of large projects done for the general good.
Sir Norman favors the speed at which the Chinese are able to complete large projects over the West, comparing the speed at which Beijing's terminal (one of the largest buildings in the world) was with the Heathrow terminal upgrade (still in planning). I am not convinced the Chinese have the right balance, but the debate is well worth having, and this movie is an outstanding start.",1371168000,2,668,5.081818181818182
5089467,5,B007IKRV6G,"If Foster is the master of his elegant taste, creations and accomplishments, the individuals who put this masterpiece DVD together are the masters of their trades. Beautiful cinematography, well written story with a narrator that allows you to sink in not only the life of this individual who has created not buildings but architecture that it will move your senses unbelievably but the creations and cinematography will be a feast for your eyes and the music a feast for your ears. Foster could have not asked for a better director to document his legacy which will last for many decades to come. Wish Foster all the blessings in the world. The last few minutes of this masterpiece where Foster describes his life and close encounters with death, are truly spiritual. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1350691200,6,789,4.93984962406015
5089468,5,B007IKRV6G,"I love architecture. I have seen Frank Ghery's piece by Sydny Pollack, FLW piece by Ken Burns and about 40 other architecture movies. This one is in the top 5. Exceptional videography, music score is excellent, story is very well written, editing at times is on genuis level, this is a good movie. I highly recommend it.",1350086400,3,320,4.631578947368421
5089469,4,B007IKRV6G,"Considering the number of buildings Sir Norman Foster has designed, I realize that it would be impossible to discuss the design philosophy behind his every major building in a 90 plus minute film. Having said that, I would recommend this film to any architecture lover, who is curious about N. Foster.",1344643200,3,301,4.921568627450981
5089470,5,B007IKRV6G,"I had no idea how much of the world's great modern buildings were the product of Norman Foster's work.
Really loved the bit about him getting to work on the Reichstag after being bombed by the German's as a child.",1340928000,,213,4.35
5089471,4,B007IKRV6G,"British architect Norman Foster may not be as well-known as Frank Gehry but his design projects are just as iconic and inventive. There's the Heart Building in New Yoprk, the Swiss Re Tower in London (that looks like a silver bullet) and the amazing Millau Viaduct in France. This 77-minute documentary will fill you in on the architect and his projects with significant discussion by the man himself. Other interviewees include fellow architects and architecture journalists. While Foster is an engaging speaker - as are the other interviewees, the narrator for this film is - frankly - boring in voice. And the slow music that is added are at odds with the exciting architecture we see on the screen. The interviewees are identified in the lower left corner of the screen but the typeface is white and often difficult to read. This low contrast is also evident in the two ""extras"" on this DVD: A text-only interview with the filmmakers and the bios of the filmmakers.

Architecture fans or those interested in design will want to see this film and it should interest those, like me, that enjoy documentaries. If only they had chosen a narrator whose voice is exciting as Foster's work.

8517635,5,B007IKRV6G,"This is a superb documentary.  The script is excellent, the cinematography superb.  It tells the story of Norman Foster, the Manchester-born architect who studied at Yale and now operates a firm that spans the globe in its reach.  The principal themes are NFs sense of style and his sense of organization.  He employs 1400 individuals in his Thames Bank operation.  With 20 or so major projects going at one time, NF has created both an organization and a process, the latter of which touches all individuals within the firm.

The documentary provides biographical information, technical information on his major commissions, interviews with many members of his firm and some reflections on life, death, art and immortality.

Even if you have no special interest in architecture, this is a truly fine film.  Highly recommended.",1466812800,3,827,5.165413533834586
