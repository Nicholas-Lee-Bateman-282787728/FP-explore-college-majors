8616040,3,B00FJC7Q88,"I am a HUGE fan of the original New York cycle podcasts and cast, so I was anxious to see them record the show on video more than anything!

Buuuuuut... the podcast recording session is broken up into self-contained clips, almost like how a comedy album splits the jokes into tracks. Except here they're shown with title cards and in no particular order. One of the best parts of the podcast to me is just listening to the free form banter between the hosts, one thought connected to another in bizarre ways, and this video special kind of throws a wrench into that.

To speak to the rest of the video, Jonny puts a lot of effort into the music videos, and it's gratifying to see some of the tidbits he mentions putting a little extra time into when he's talking about them on the podcast. It's just that I don't really care that much about them. There's some funny visual gags, and loads of hot guys, but I guess I just like the drag videos more.

But you know what? There are tons of people who do, and they will donate their money for him to make more. So I wish him all the best going forward!",1413849600,2,1097,4.264423076923077
8616041,5,B00FJC7Q88,"The talent and charm that is Jonny McGovern cuts right through on this--  the tight beats and video of the pro Hollywood team, and the true NYC underground where it all began.  Funny with-a-wink, and sexy in-your-face, if you like it like that...  Live video podcasts plus Original Stars makes this a must have for even the casual podcast/blog fan, or newcomer to the party!",1404777600,,374,4.723076923076923
