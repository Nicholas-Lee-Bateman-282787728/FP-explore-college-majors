5974140,5,B00FBQ3E88,"I seek out the Paley Fest interviews for all my favorite shows and this one did not disappoint. I love Jessica Lange and all the rest of the actors on the show. It is so much fun to hear them talk about the show and see them interact together!

Give this a try, I promise if you like this show you won't be disappointed! Hey, I watched this Paley Fest before I watched a single episode of AHS Asylum and I enjoyed this so much that that is why I watched the show!",1392940800,4,463,3.978494623655914

5974144,5,B00FBQ3E88,"All the way through the entire episode you become lost in the movie and its hard to not watch the every episode one after another with out a break, it is that good! The best I have seen in years. I am looking forward to more like this one.",1390348800,2,239,3.8979591836734695

5974164,4,B00FBQ3E88,"I love these Paley shows to get the scoop on all the ""behind the scenes"" stuff from my favorite shows!  I've never been a _horror genre_ fan, but the acting and writing have really captured my attention.  What a great cast!

Highly recommended!",1418860800,,244,4.627906976744186

5974182,5,B00FBQ3E88,"I love Jessica Lange as herself, even more than her characters.  Its remarkable to see how different she is from her characters.  I didn't appreciate the range of her acting skills as much before I saw her personality shine through.  I loved this!",1418256000,3,247,4.6976744186046515

5974184,5,B00FBQ3E88,"Very cool to see the real side of some of my favorite actors. Especially Jessica Lange, she is such an interesting and talented woman. She's all grace. Not to mention that American Horror Story is my favorite show ever. Ryan Murphy is so delightfully twisted! It's great to hear where some of my favorite scenes/episodes came to fruition.",1416182400,,338,4.844827586206897
5974185,5,B00FBQ3E88,"If you don't like spine chilling edge of your seat thrillers DON'T watch this! On the other hand,
if you DO like great writing, great acting, great stage sets and an all frills twist and turn production, this is the
show you are looking for.  My stomach was in a knot throughout.  I did a marathon and gave myself no breaks. I actually forgot to eat !
Jessica Lang is just extraordinary.  This woman wears more hats in one production than some actors do in a whole career.  All of the actors are terrific. I had to keep reminding myself that this was acting.
The first season was good. The second season was better.
I highly recommend this show.  Each season is a completely different story with many of the same actors so you could watch season 2 without watching season 1 and you will have missed nothing.
The only issue I ever have with these types of shows are the ideas they might be giving to the crazies out there.",1409616000,4,921,4.362573099415204

5974190,3,B00FBQ3E88,The actors take on  their characters was interesting and the fact that they didn't seem to know where the show was going over the course of the season was also interesting.,1399939200,,172,4.548387096774194
5974191,3,B00FBQ3E88,"Interesting, but could have been better.  I would have liked more clips of the series and discussion about that with the actors.",1398816000,,128,4.818181818181818

8614090,3,B00FBQ3E88,Entertaining to watch characters in their own  persona. The host could have better questions to each of the celebrities rather than just Jessica talking.,1473033600,,153,5.375

I also loved looking at Pepper without makeup and all the other actors, I would love to buy this as a DVD for my collection.",1447891200,,290,4.37037037037037
