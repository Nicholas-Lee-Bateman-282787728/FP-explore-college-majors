2887461,2,B000SM6FHM,"This had all the makings of a Firm routine that I expected to like - approx. 44 minutes and my knees were delighted there was no use of the ever present Fanny Lifter - so I was a little surprised when I found I didn't.

I found the warm-up and initial warm-up to be complicated, especially given their apparent fixation with moving to the side. That would have provided a little more of a learning curve and may have even prevented boredom if the cueing hadn't been so dreadful. Unfortunately, Emily wouldn't tell you what steps were going to be done until you were supposed to be doing them.

Examples of the poor cueing would be that if you're doing lunges, you'd have no idea whether to alternate legs or which leg would lead. You would be told to do an arm lift, but you'd have to watch to see that they were doing it in two parts - lift halfway up and then the rest of the way up. Many times you'd be told how to angle an arm lift, that you should do two quick movements instead of one or that you were going to do a move in two parts after the first one was done. As you can imagine, this made it very difficult to follow and felt very herky-jerky.

I don't expect to be able to anticipate every move or follow along flawlessly with a new routine, but this workout is a prime example of why people often dislike trying a new DVD. I use a wide variety of workouts and anything overly complicated or difficult to nail down doesn't make the cut because it's impossible to learn and retain a complex routine that I may only use every few weeks. I will often feature 3 or 4 workouts for a period of time and alternate a wide variety of others on the remaining 2-3 days of the week, but I found this one so annoying that I am glad I borrowed it from Netflix and didn't buy it. I may try it one more time before returning it, but I don't recommend this for anyone looking for a simple, straightforward, easy to learn routine. Definitely not recommended for beginners, lest they think all exercise is this difficult to learn.

I recommend The Firm's Total Body Toner with Allie Del Rio Pointer as the instructor if you're looking for a well cued workout that doesn't use the fanny lifter in this era of The Firm's DVD distribution.",1203724800,11,2229,4.274881516587678
2887462,4,B000SM6FHM,"I was pleasantly surprised by the Firm series, this video is no exception. Emily is fun without being overly aggravating. Some days I just want a quick workout instead of the usual grind and sweat. This is it. The choreography is a bit much, but it is worth sticking with and learning how to follow.",1202860800,3,299,4.454545454545454
2887463,4,B000SM6FHM,"I confess I'm not the most coordinated person in the world, but I found some of the cardio moves a little tricky to follow.  I've done this work-out twice now, and I'm getting better, but it will probably take me a few more times before I have the moves down really well.  However, I think this is a good work-out.  I consider myself an intermediate-level exerciser, and I worked up a good sweat.  I bought this one at the same time as The Firm Boot Camp Maximum Calorie Burn, and the Burn and Shape is definitely the easier of the two.  The Burn and Shape does more sculpting with weights and is shorter at about 40-45 minutes.  I like that it gives me a good work-out without requiring lots of equipment.  You just need 3 sets of dumbbells.",1202774400,4,742,4.333333333333333
2887464,5,B000SM6FHM,"I have been doing FIRM workouts for years now; they're fun, fast paced and effective. Generally, I have been thinking that the newer ""boxless"" workouts that have been coming out are just not as hard as the ones with the ""boxes"" (Be it fanny lifter, box, transFIRMer..). I will be the first to say that's not the case with this puppy!
  This video absolutely attacks my hamstring area. The next day, it's tender when I sit! Call me crazy, but I love that feeling. Makes me feel proud of what I accomplished. I thought nothing could work like the tall box climb- then I did this ""butt and back burner"" the way that Emily does it. Nuff said!
  I still rotate my step workouts (What can I say? I'm a step junkie!) with the newer non-step ones, but I don't feel like I am having an ""easy"" day when I grab this one.",1202342400,7,809,4.26797385620915
2887465,4,B000SM6FHM,"This is another good Firm workout.  It's using basic choreography and it's designed more for an intermediate exerciser.  Emily's cuing isn't quite as good as someone like Kari Anderson or Amy Dixon, but it's not too hard to follow along with.
You get alternating intervals of weights and cardio and you can always do some movement variations to make it a little tougher if you want to.  When it comes to the cardio, it's not overly dancy so that portion is easy to follow (cuing could again be a bit better).  I like how with the toning, you begin with basic moves and add on different muscles to maximise the effect and your heart rate stays up which is good for the burning fat and calories.
This is a pretty good workout that I've only done twice so far, but I enjoy it and think many people can gain benefits from this.  It might be a little frustrating at first if you can't follow due to her cuing, but once you get it, it's fun to do and effective for sure.",1200441600,10,964,4.303867403314917
2887466,5,B000SM6FHM,"I got this and Cardio Fusion together.
I was pretty excited to see some new stuff come out, and not have to buy new equipment. And really kind of glad I didn't have to climb on anything.

Overall I'm happy with it, and will be happier yet when I get the steps down, I agree with a previous review that the cueing wasn't quite there as it should have been and that does make it frustrating, but generally I find with Emily's that the choreography transitions smoothly enough I usually can catch up quickly. There is quite a bit of arm-leg movement, so be aware that it may take a few times and repetition to make it all work. I'm with you there, I'm not overly coordinated. I'm still learning this one, but so far I like it and will like it even more once I know where to put myself.",1200182400,15,782,4.178807947019868
2887467,5,B000SM6FHM,"This DVD is the best.  Emily is a great leader, and the exercises are fun and effective.  I love the firm and find that this ""pink box"" series is no nonsense, not ultra impossible, and you can see and feel the results.  Lots of weights, aerobics and toning.  A great package!  I am in my 50's and find this a comfortable pace.",1199318400,7,326,4.193548387096774
2887468,3,B000SM6FHM,"Overall this can be a terrific workout, and I think given more time as I learn all of the steps for all of the segments I'll be fine.

However....Emily's cueing in the first two cardio segments is not the standard I expect from her or the FIRM.  I'm never certain which foot I'm supposed to be stepping on first, I'm never certain which direction I'm supposed to be moving, basically I'm just confused through those parts.

My first two times with this workout were terribly frustrating.  It's been better the last two times, but it's a shame that the cueing issue wasn't monitored more carefully for beginners or those of us who are a little awkward with dance.",1190937600,17,662,4.584745762711864
2887469,5,B000SM6FHM,"This new Firm series is great! No step or fanny lifter! Just cardio and weights. Each DVD is divided up into segments that you can jump through. Each one has a ""modifier"" for those of us who need a break ;-)

I've been a Firm fan for 7 years now and I think its great how they've come along, now with something totally different!

Kudos to Emily and all the Firm Instructors, past and present!",1189296000,14,393,4.226666666666667
2887470,5,B000SM6FHM,This video is really good if you don't feel like hard cardio that day. It has a light mix but mostly wieght lifting and toning. I like this trainer although she is a little 80's ish in personality.,1294963200,,197,4.2105263157894735
2887471,5,B000SM6FHM,"Burn and Shape appears to be complicated (and perhaps too hard) at first and second viewing. But once you learn the cardio moves, it's an awesome workout! It's by far my favorite these days. I find it a little short, so I tack on Emily's portion of Cardio Party at the beginning to make a longer workout. Love it!",1293667200,,313,4.322033898305085
2887472,4,B000SM6FHM,"I recently purchased The Firm Ultimate Fat-Burning Collection, and this workout was one of the four selections included on that DVD.  Emily Welsh leads this workout with 4 background exercisers (surprisingly, although Sue-Mi is in the cast, it's Allison who shows modifications) in the Firm's newer set with wood floors and fake windows.  This is a cardio sculpting routine, and Emily cues use of light, medium, and heavy dumbbells (I used 3s, 5s, and 10s).

The workout begins with a fairly long (almost 7 minutes) warm-up.  Although the moves themselves are relatively simple--e.g., double side steps, v-steps, low jacks, double taps with squats and rear dips--the choreography is a bit tricky, especially for a warm-up, and I found Emily a little hard to follow at times.  On the other hand, it did get my heart up quickly, so that was good.  Following the warm-up, Emily cues medium weights to move right into squats with shoulder press.  Next is a short front lunge with glute lift/row and then a biceps curl.  Moving onto light weights for shoulder work, Emily starts with a unique move, a plie which adds a twisting delt raise, and then she does a traditional rear delt raise with a bit of a twist (I liked both these exercises!).

The first cardio segment comes next (about 4 minutes total).  Again, the moves themselves are pretty simple:  a front-back-front step, a hamstring/knee combo that adds repeaters, and a lunge front with small hops to switch.  This is followed by rear dips with triceps overhead extensions, push-ups, lat rows, wide squats with wide bicep curls, and a second set of push-ups.  For the second cardio segment, Emily starts with a side step, circling the arms and adding a knee up on the end.  She then moves into a squat-front kick-dip combo on each leg and does some plyos; this entire sequence is repeated several times.

Emily has you pick up your heavy weights for side lunges with sweeps, but then it's back to the light weights for deadlifts with triceps kickbacks.  This is followed by a walking lunge with a clean and press (forward)/biceps curl (backward) and the final standing move is a ""seesaw"" to work the abs.  Coming to the floor, Emily does a held plank and then goes right into triceps push-ups and chest flies, which concludes the dumbbell work.  She next performs about 2 1/2 minutes of crunch variations for the abdominals.  The final stretch is short (about 2 minutes):  Emily begins on the hands and knees for cat/cow, a calf stretch, a triceps stretch, and a hip flexor lunge, and she moves to standing for hamstring and neck stretches.

Overall, I enjoyed this workout.  There were a couple of places where I felt the choreography was a bit unnecessarily complicated and/or where Emily could have cued better, but I liked the fact that my heart rate stayed up the entire time, even through the weight sections, and I found the mostly low-impact cardio segments to be fun.  I would rate this workout as low intermediate, but it would be appropriate for experienced beginners (or even new exercisers following Allison for modifications), and it could be modified up for high intermediates using heavier weights.",1287014400,3,3168,4.8584729981378025
2887473,4,B000SM6FHM,"I'm a HUGE Firm follower and this DVD is good. If you are already a firm follower, it will be an easy DVD to follow. If you are a beginner, it will be a good one to set the pace. The moves are easy to follow. It's not as difficult or challenging as some of the others, but I still enjoy this one.",1284768000,,296,3.7142857142857144
2887474,5,B000SM6FHM,"Darn, I wish I'd discovered this collection sooner! But better late than never. Very effective. I actually break out in a sweat just doing the warm up!

I like to include a 7.5 lb. kettle bell where appropriate (i.e. tricep dips, hip adductions, standing ab twist), and love the variations in weights. Emily is so cute. Her upbeat personality keeps me focused.

The outfits are cool, too. Alison's reminded me of early Britney Spears.

If you want a fast, fun and efficient workout, I say grab a copy. You won't regret it. Do it 3 times a week for 2 weeks, and see results!",1280707200,,573,4.490384615384615
2887475,4,B000SM6FHM,"This workout moves really quickly without spending time to explain but after doing the workout several times, I got the hang of it. I also like how the ab exercises are unique and work parts you are not used to working.",1256601600,,219,4.365853658536586
2887476,4,B000SM6FHM,"This is my first The Firm workout and I am happy with it.  I didn't get all of the steps right on the first try, but I expected this and you should, too!  It will get easier as I use the video more and learn the workout.  I actually think the cuing is pretty decent, which is a high compliment from me because I workout with a toddler underfoot.  The cuing is better than many exercise videos out there, but I can see room for improvement on that item to give instructions on right/left foot, etc.  It is easy to follow, the cardio steps have good flow, it uses weights and cardio in combination, and I was really sweating by the end!  Overall, a great workout!",1249344000,,661,4.2063492063492065
2887477,3,B000SM6FHM,"I have them all I am a junkie (see my other reviews)and this is still a solid workout even though it is only about 40 min.  Emily is a self professed lunger and proves it a couple times in this video with differnt sets of walking lunges. It really gets the heart pumping! The only downfall is there is not enough abs but what do you want for the time given? Still I put this in the rotation after my two hard days(500 calorie workout-dangerous curves ahead) as a bit of a break...one comment she looks so much different now, had a fantastic makeover but still like her either way she is motivating and just seems like the girl next door.",1236902400,,637,4.264462809917355
2887478,4,B000SM6FHM,"The sculpting segments are a great workout. Every muscle in my body burns afterward.

Not crazy about the cardio, however. It is so fast and poorly instructed that I get frustrated and end up hopping in place. Emily isn't my favorite instructor. Her voice is often monotone and it doesn't match the speed and intensity of the exercises.

Overall, I enjoy this workout and hope to catch on to the cardio a little more each time I pop the DVD in.",1236211200,,444,4.469135802469136
2887479,5,B000SM6FHM,I rented this on Netflix to give it a test run.  I liked it so much I decided to buy it.  It keeps we sweating throughout the entire session.

2887481,1,B000SM6FHM,"I bought this DVD because it said it included ""beginner modifications so anyone can do it"" on the packaging. I tried it once and only made it through the first 10 minutes. The warm-up with weights did have modifications (don't use weights). However, the aerobic steps were very complicated. So much so I could not begin to keep up. Admittedly,I have two left feet, but this was so complicated I will not even try again. If you do not have experienced in aerobics or have trouble picking up complicated moves, buy something else.",1228089600,3,528,4.688172043010753
2887482,1,B000SM6FHM,"I don't consider myself to have two left feet, nor am I an aerobics expert. As someone somewhere in the middle, I found this to be far too complicated to get through. The cueing is truly awful and the instructor doesn't take time to intro the moves and get you comfortable with the routine. Maybe the strength routine is better, but even after multiple tries, I couldn't get past the cardio section, so I really wouldn't know.

With so many better, user-friendly and well-produced products on the market, it's not even worth bothering with this one.",1221696000,,549,4.71875
2887483,3,B000SM6FHM,"This really is a 4 STAR. It won't let you change the number of stars you originally put in.

It's mixed with toning and cardio segments.  The toning is good and easy to follow.  Some of the cardio is hard to follow but I turned the volume up and it helped me to follow. The abs at the end are very good.

The cardio is fun. It takes a few time to get it, and helps just to watch it a couple of times before you do it.

I changed my original review, but I can get the stars to change to 4 instead of 3.",1219276800,,501,3.688679245283019

2887487,1,B000SM6FHM,"I love the Firm, but I'm very disappointed with this and the other new Firm DVDs. Some of the four-limb segments are good, but I find the aerobics segments unnecessarily complicated and they don't even raise my heart rate. With my older Firm DVDs, I always feel like I've had a workout; with these new ones, I don't. Also, these new routines feel harder on my knees (because of twisting more than impact) and back. I have minor back problems, and I find myself modifying the moves in these new DVDs to protect my back from being strained/""put out."" And I miss the fannylifter/transfirmer. I don't know if these changes are because Gaiam now owns the Firm, but I really hope they go back to the more intense, more straight forward routines. I would return this one and get my money back if I could.",1210204800,3,797,4.503448275862069
2887488,1,B000SM6FHM,"I wrote a review for this before, but have changed it since doing the DVD a couple of times.  While Emily seems to be a good instructor (Cardio Sculpt Fusion aka Total Body Lite), this DVD outright is terrible. Her cueing is subpar, especially in the warmup. There were a lot of step touches, pivots, punch punches, etc. She only goes slow a couple of times, then ramps up the speed like a guinea pig on acid. The strength training is okay, but doing the lunge/row/overhead press combo was tough on my back, plus she was never specific on what leg to be using. So I just alternated legs.  Her cardio was okay, nothing exciting. I had to modify some of the bouncing around. The ab work was probably my favorite- a variety of moves in different positions. I enjoyed the standing ab work as well.  Overall this video was sub par, especially if you have two left feet and have trouble keeping up with all the step changes.  Defintely try something by Alison or Rebekah instead if you want consistency.",1204848000,13,997,4.49171270718232

The only problem I have with this one is that some of the power moves were a little too fast for me to have good form, so I will have to work on that. And the other thing was that some of the cueing was a little too late. But it was an excellent workout and Emily really gets your blood pumping and your sweat pouring while having a good time.

8205897,3,B000SM6FHM,"I had tried some Firm dvds a couple of years before but I found the choreography to be too complicated for me.  (I was a Jillian exerciser because they were easy to follow.) Then I tried the Firm's Cardio Party and loved it!  I began buying more of their workouts which brought me to Burn and Shape.  I was very surprised by the overly complicated warm up and the lack of cueing in this workout.  The first time I tried it, I got through 4 minutes of the warm up and was so frustrated I gave up and changed dvds.  I tried it again yesterday and was frustrated again by the complicated choreography but completed the workout.  It didn't seem to be fluid and I was not able to pick up the cardio moves.  I have tried several Firm dvds (pink series) and have been able to pick up the choreography, so I was surprised I couldn't pick up the moves.  I gave it three starts because there were some good exercises in there which left my glutes, thighs and hamstrings sore today.  I exercise 5-6 days per week so I usually don't get muscle soreness/doms. I also liked the use of some heavy weights in some of the exercises.  I normally like Emily as a trainer.  As a side note, I did notice a couple of times that the camera focused solely on the modifier and I couldn't see what the normal move should have been.  I think it is great that the Firm usually includes a modifier.  It is great for people who are starting out, or are new to the Firm workouts.

I stopped using most Jillian dvds because I got to the point where I was dreading them.  I don't feel that way with most of the Firm workouts and actually look forward to working out.  While I don't intend to use this one again any time soon or at all, here are some I really like and recommend: Cardio Party, Hi-Def Sculpt, Total Body Time Crunch, Cardio Overdrive, and Pump, Jump n Jab.",1465344000,,1838,4.238505747126437

8205905,3,B000SM6FHM,"First off, this was my first FIRM workout. I know many people are die-hard FIRM fans and many reviews here come from these said fans. I thought I'd give a ""newbie"" opinion.

I am very coordinated. I used to be a serious dancer, and I've taken aerobic and step classes, so I am familiar with terminology. Having said that, I don't think ANYONE could follow the cardio choreography the first time through this dvd. I eventually caught on and was able to complete the workout, but many times I found myself stumbling over my feet, unsure where to go next or missing a move. The cuing is very poor and the instructor's method of repeating moves before going back to the beginning or moving on is erratic and changes throughout. For example, she might show a new move, do it twice and then go back to an earlier move (but you're not sure which one she's going back to). Then on the next new move she may repeat it four times then add on another new step, which she'll do once before going back to yet another different spot. The warmup was the hardest part to follow, and should have been the easiest. Having said all of that, I was able to get through the workout without stopping. It was just far from perfect. I assume it will get much easier each time I do the dvd.

I did like that it went back and forth between cardio segments and toning segments. However, it all was (physically, if not mentally) quite simple and I didn't work up much of a sweat. I found myself modifying a lot of the toning work or using much heavier weights to get a bigger benefit out of it. And I didn't find it to be very enjoyable. I typically do hour long workouts so this was even shorter than most I do, but I found myself continuously looking at the clock. I think this was mostly due to the instructor more so than the actual work being done. I didn't care for her personality and she seemed very amateur to me. Not that she seemed incompetent, it just felt more like a workout some random girl decided to film at home rather than a true professional with lots of experience teaching and in front of the camera. I know many others like her personality; it just didn't jive with me. And I like lots of different types of personalities with workout instructors (e.g. Jillian Michaels, Sara Ivanhoe, Kari Anderson... all very different)

My review sounds harsh but I still give it 3 stars. If I can get past my less than enthusiastic reaction to the instructor, learn the choreography and add more weight/intense modifications, it's a worthwhile workout. Still better than a lot of what's out there... just not the best there is.

UPDATE: The second time I did this workout I didn't struggle NEARLY as much with following along. I may have just had an off-day that first time. Her cuing could definitely be better and her # of repetitions is sporadic but it's not as difficult to follow as I made it seem. I enjoyed it more the second time around too.
