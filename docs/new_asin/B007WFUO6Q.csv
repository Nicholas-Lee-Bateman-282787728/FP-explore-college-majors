8522611,5,B007WFUO6Q,"I had recently watched Ondine which alluded to the selkie myth, and I was reminded of this older drama by Hallmark which draws heavily upon the selkie mythology and does so in a compelling and credible manner. Set in a sleepy Irish coastal village in the early 1900s, Scott Glenn plays Owen Quinn, a lonely and sad widower who pines for his late wife who was his soulmate. Quinn and his best friend Willy (Eamon Morrissey) are both fishermen who have fallen on hard times due to the lack of fishing prospects. In fact, the entire village is experiencing hard financial times, and so it comes as a surprise when one of the least liked village inhabitants, a surly young man named Eamon Dunhill (Joseph Kelly) suddenly prospers. The circumstances are strange - Eamon begins showing up with a beautiful young woman (Saffron Burrows) who tags along with him on his fishing boat, and each time return with a boat full of fish. No one knows the identity of this mysterious young woman, and the village is astir with gossip and speculation.

Then things gets even stranger - Quinn finds the young woman spying on him at his isolated home near the sea, and begins to imagine this lady visiting him in his dreams, pleading for his help in recovering something that she has lost. Well, (no spoiler here given the plot), the woman claims to be a selkie who is bound to Eamon and the land as long as Eamon keeps her sealskin. She needs to find the sealskin and return to the sea before the next seventh stream comes to an end.

The story has all the elements that make for a riveting watch - suspense, romance, elements of the supernatural, excellent casting, beautiful cinematography of the Irish coast and romantic soundtrack, all of which further enhance the story. A wonderful yet poignant romantic drama.
The DVD is retailing at a high price, but there might be cheaper alternatives via third party sellers.",1446940800,,1900,4.66865671641791
