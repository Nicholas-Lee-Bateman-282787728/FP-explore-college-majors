6397502,5,B00K0HD7TO,"Wow!  I have to make this short, but the setlist if VERY unique, INDIAN SUNSET, LEVON, TINY DANCER, BETTER OFF DEAD, and many many classics although TOO many up-tempo songs like SATURDAY NIGHT'S ALRIGHT and BENNIE and some others that I could live without (Like PLEASE retire CROC ROCK) - but the presentation is spectacular, Elton is in fine, grufff voice but sounds wonderful and the band on the blu ray in 5.1 adds some notes new to these songs and this is truly a great great full gem-filled show with amazing versions of lots of classics. Highly recommended!",1404259200,2,563,4.686868686868687
6397503,4,B00K0HD7TO,"Love Elton and this is a very good concert, but some of the performances seem stripped-down. Concert itself is just a little over an hour and forty minutes, and that is with the encore. Gone is Elton's signature epic version of ""Rocket Man"" replaced with a nice version, but i was looking forward to one of his amazing extended renditions of one of his best songs ever. Gone completely are numerous classics like ""Daniel,"" ""Burn Down the ""Mission"" and ""Somebody Saved My Life Tonight."" Best performance for me were ""Indian ""Sunset"" with just Elton and the legendary Ray Cooper, handling what originally included his band and a full orchestra. The encore is just ""Circle of  Life"" but its beautifully performed with a stunning, cinematic backdrop that fondly recalls ""The Lion King"" The only really annoying part of the show comes when many audience members come on to the stage during ""Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting."" The electrifying production and staging is marred by these people almost swallowing up Elton; some holding their cell phones inches from his face. Coming to mind was ""Tantrums and Tiaras"" moments when Elton was not happy when fans invade his space. What some of these fans did on stage re-defines the yword 'invasion' Overall a nice, but too short performance. I have to say, I liked the ""Red Piano"" show much more. Although i could do without the silly inflatables, the use of video sceens was more creative and exciting. I also thought that the ""Red Piano"" show as a video, was better produced and featured many shots of the actual, wonderful staging and production values, which is not the case with this one. If you're an EJ fan, this is worth purchasing, but not everyone will slobber all over themselves in excitement and euphoria viewing this.",1404172800,21,1776,4.880794701986755
6397504,5,B00K0HD7TO,"Super-ornate lighting and staging surround Sir Elton during this outstanding show(s) from Caesar's Palace featuring a Yamaha $1,000,000 (actually 1.4 million dollar) piano with LED lighting.  Frankly the piano's effects were only a small portion of what must have been an incredible visual and sonic experience for the 4000 people in attendance.  There was so much going on in the background that there were times that I wished the director would have used more wide shots, especially during the performance of ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" when the audience was apparently seeing a visual depiction of the career of the man singing the song while we disc viewers were left mostly with close-ups of the singer and members of the band.

One of the most welcome and interesting performances was the seldom-played live, ""Indian Sunset"" from the ""Madman Across the Water"" album that featured Elton backed only by percussionist Ray Cooper.

I don't know about most viewers but when I watch a concert disc, I at least prefer to have the illusion that I am watching one performance.  While most of the band members seemed to have gotten the memo requesting that they wear the same clothing during the filmed performances, backup singer Rose Stone (from Sly and the Family Stone)  and the late bass player, Bob Birch, apparently did not.  I found it very distracting to see Ms. Stone wearing two different blond wigs in shots taken from within the same song.  Similarly, I was constantly amazed to see Mr. Birch's jacket appear and disappear within the same song.  Unfortunately these were not isolated occurrences either; I noticed the same things happening multiple times.

Don't let my quibbles stop you from purchasing this disc if you are an Elton John fan or even a marginal one.  The fact remains that I still awarded it five stars due to the strength of the performances and overall presentation.  The Piano Man certainly didn't just phone it in!",1404086400,20,1944,4.947692307692308

I had the thrill of seeing Elton's Red Piano show in Las Vegas several years ago, but this show outdid even being there in person. Sure, there are loads of special effects, but they just add to the energy and excitement of watching the performance. They didn't seem gimmicky, just fun. Forget going to the gym- just buy this Blu Ray and enjoy 45 years of an immense talent!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1403827200,39,533,4.287128712871287
6397506,5,B00K0HD7TO,"I saw this on its limited run on the big screen. I sat close and really got into it. Actually lapsed into thinking I was at a real concert. Began singing and clapping along.  Probably lucky that I didn't get tossed out. Elton really still has it, Even though he Doesn't quite hit the high notes like he used to, but all the songs sounded great. The piano does some awesome stuff, you really have to look closely because it doesn't seem possible. I can not leave out the excellent ensemble of musicians and backup singers.",1402617600,53,521,4.427083333333333

The sound and visuals on the Blu-Ray version are phenomenal, and the documentary on the creation of the Yamaha piano is very interesting...  it is great to see these accomplished Yamaha engineers team with EJ's team to produce such a magnificent instrument.

Regarding the concert itself, EJ's voice is as strong as can be expected for his age and previous excesses, but the show is spectacular, and the setlist is really good, with several notable omissions, such as ""Someone Saved My Life Tonight"", which EJ can no longer sing in its original key.  Otherwise, EJ puts on a very strong performance, and the band and back-up vocalists do an excellent job.  Highly recommended!",1456099200,6,841,4.772413793103448

Elton John was in fine forum but unlike the Blu-ray, John walked out during the opening of Philadelphia Freedom as he yelled f&*( it too slow then walked off the stage but returned to finish up the show. Also at the end he stays out to bow to the crowd for a few minutes & at my show he just walked off stage without returning. I heard this wasn't the first time he had done that. Despite that, it was still one heck of a show. This is the best way to relive that show & the extra features are well worth it.

6397596,5,B00K0HD7TO,Having gone to the show in Vegas ....this brought it all back! Great video quality and editing and pretty good sound quality...though the sound quality was not as clear as my other Blu Ray concerts - and I have many. Elton sounds and is amazing - and what really separates this is the clean editing of the video footage. The show may not have every hit or song you'd like - Elton simply has too many...but the show overall is outstanding. Buy it - you will not be disappointed.,1417824000,,477,4.370786516853933

The quality is perfect. The show includes all of his hits plus a few of the songs like Indian Sunset that us die hard fans love to hear. I have been listening to his music for 41 years and have seen him multiple times in concert. Elton endures because of his showmanship, his music and the beautiful lyrics by Bernie Taupin.

It was THE BEST SOUNDED show I attended in my whole life (and been to many). I went to see Celine at the Colluseum one month after Elton, and it sounded 75% of what it sounded Elton. Don't know why, but believe me. From the same position, the sound of Elton was astonishing! I'll have to wait for some friend to travel to USA in order to buy the Concert, because if I buy it at Amazon and they send me to Argentina, probably I'll never recieve it.

6397630,5,B00K0HD7TO,"Watched this last night and loved it.  Elton and Bernie have written so many iconic hit songs that the band can't even get to them all in just one performance.  Elton is in fine voice and his piano playing is magnificent.  The band, including original band drummer Nigel Olsson, long-time guitarist Davey Johnstone and percussionist extraordinaire Ray Cooper, is excellent throughout.  I loved the familiar hits - on which Elton is not afraid to sing new melodies and re-invent as he plays them - but my favorite song in this show is probably the lesser-known Indian Sunset, a mind-blowing duet with Elton singing and playing piano and Ray Cooper adding percussion. You realize when watching this how sophisticated and brilliant the songwriting really is - like the Beatles, Elton originates and defines what we term ""popular music"". Buy this without hesitation and enjoy!",1410134400,2,872,5.076923076923077

Due to the fact I was their on the first show I can relate deep inside with this outstanding job that the camera technicians, sound crew, and stage directors, did an out-standing job to catch all of the footage along with Ray Cooper,John Mahon, playing vocals and percussions. As far as Sir Elton, Dave, Nigel and our beloved Bob Birch, Ta, Ta and the lady's. I Was once again rocking my house down. This is a must buy!! trust me. You will not ever see such a show like this one, If you have been to LV Caesars Palace you know how beautiful it is. The DVD also has an extra kick to it, Elton's newest cello players who also blended in very well. I also must tell you this DVD has more action, so do not miss it after the show>> use that remote to rocket your self away to another event, with more rocket action. And last of all the CD has footage of the making of the 1.4 Million Dollar piano. For the cost of this CD I purchased another 10 CD's for Christmas gifts. With that said I may purchase a few more that I will pass along to some friends.

Respectfully Submitted,",1406505600,,1248,4.2

6397678,5,B00K0HD7TO,"There is no question that through the highs and lows of the music industry and all of the fads and trends of artists that have came and went, there are just very few and far between that have still absolutely shown after all this time that they are still standing after all these years. Elton John who has been celebrating over 5 decades of bountiful highs and lows, has shown to honestly have the most important legacy after the showcase that The Beatles have shown. His songs still withstand the test of time, beyond what words could ever be said with timeless melodies that still remain remarkable. He has had some remarkable shows cemented in his life, in Las Vegas he had The Red Piano in 2004, but what could follow up with that from a legend that still is standing.

The Million Dollar Piano which started in 2011, showcases a piano concept that came to Elton John from Yamaha pianos, a piano that could show lighting effects just as much as the stage show, and a translucent element into Elton John's classic songs. The show which was shot in 2011, was sadly before bassist Bob Birch who had performed with Elton on tour for over 20 years took his own life, as one of the final concert series that Elton had performed with him. The concert is a multimedia event that shows images and concepts set through the stage and Elton's piano, and through the setup is a classic concert of Elton's great classic songs like Your Song, I'm Still Standing, I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues, as well as lesser-known songs from Elton like Better Off Dead from Captain Fantastic & The Brown Dirt Cowboy and Indian Sunset, Blue Eyes and Circle Of Life. The Extras work as well, as Elton performed a set of songs when he toured for the Peachtree Road album in 2004 in Russia. While I do wish that songs like Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word and Burn Down The Mission to just name a few could've been in the concert film, as well as more recent songs from The Diving Board album like Home Again, there is no denying Elton John and the stamina of his classics.

All in all, what Elton John is still doing in his sixties surpasses the so-called talents of Beyonce' Knowles, Nicki Minaj and Katy Perry, who have let their talents go to waste because they have been marketing products than real entertainers. Elton John has had so many great concerts he had done before in Australia with The Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, Barcelona Stadium during the Olympics in 1992, and Madison Square Garden in 2006, for his 60th birthday having the number 60 with his name hanging in the rafters with sports legends like Wayne Gretsky. this is a definite buy for die hard Elton John fans. He has made the music of our times, and it is so amazing after all this time, his songs have never ever gone out of style.
