7929613,5,B0000520PX,"Not a bad German action-movie. Main star: Dennis Hopper,
Lot's of good action-stunts and flashbacks, professionally done.
This is not a must see film, but I think you will not regret it.",1192147200,,186,4.84375
7929614,3,B0000520PX,"The ever-present Dennis Hopper plays the hero for a change in this German-made thriller that has some good moments, but still seems a little forced and talky at times.  Hopper plays a former Vietnam vet whose protege is killing people in revenge of his young daughter's death probably caused by a nuclear power plant.  German actor Heinz Frecke looking like a pumped up Bruce Willis is stoically effective as the ""straight shooter"".  The movie attempts to connect the current killings with Frecke's time in Vietnam where he mistakenly killed two children in a raid.  While the effect isn't quite as devastating as the writer intended, it still lends some credibility to the script.  The movie's abrupt and puzzling ending are a little unsatisfactory, though.",1154563200,3,758,5.080645161290323

digitally remastered)...relive those thrilling days from the early '30s and '40s

when drama took us down the dusty trails and the plains to exciting

adventures....some of the best B-Westerns ever to grace the Saturday Matinee

Screen......the Native Americans had no better ambassador than Tim McCoy, a

former Indian language translator in real life...as Tim McCoy speaks

passionately about this country's longtime abuse of its native population by

breaking treaty after treaty...just remember double thrills, chills, mystery and

suspense...hitting the bull's eye with excitement...don't miss any of the Tim

McCoy features loaded with action that will leave you wanting more of his

B-Western adventures

7929616,3,B0000520PX,"Dennis Hopper is still in (just barely) good enough
shape to pull this role off in this not bad german
action / thiller (with english subtitles). Main prop
here is a dual story (unfortunately Anti-Nuke) about
german special forces guy who was in Vietam(?!) with
crack [Col. James] 'Bo' Gritz-style unit commanded by
Hopper. 'Straight Shooter' was the ultimate killing
machine, 'created' by Hopper. He has never adjusted
well to life outside the field and his daughter's
death he blames on those who run Nuclear Power Plant
nearbye. He picks them off one by one and KILLS
all who try to stop him. Shades of the recent german
first woman Chancellor, he finally gets her too!!

Look for Hopper taking out 'S.S.' @ the end and a
good but brief cameo by ex-NFL/XFL & current 10-yr.
NFL E vet TE Werner Hippler, as a Secret Service
type at the female District Attorney's sons' daycare
place guarding him. He also had bit roles in german
films: Die Wache and Der Clown, the best of the three
he started in...",1136505600,2,1001,4.623595505617978
