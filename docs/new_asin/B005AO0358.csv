8463483,4,B005AO0358,Excellent thorough but shocking presentation if you are not familiar with vaccine contents.  Covers in depth history as well as current problems with vaccines.  This would be a great gift to a mother to be or any mother for that matter.  Mary Tocco certainly knows her vaccines and is a joy to listen to.  Not a bit boring either. Highly recommended.,1446249600,,350,4.688524590163935
8463484,5,B005AO0358,I highly recommend Mary Toccos DVD set.  Great information and clearly explained. So thankful to have watched these before I had children so I could make informed decisions.,1390953600,4,173,5.178571428571429
8463485,4,B005AO0358,"The info is great and just what we were looking for.  The information is organized well and presented clearly.  The format isn't great, you have to go back to the main menu to go to each segment.",1353369600,3,195,4.243243243243243
8463486,5,B005AO0358,This video has so much information that every parent should consider and hear. She has been able to present the information and is very careful to sight her resources. She hides no information.  This is not just about vaccines but goes into great details about many of the other childhood illnesses and diseases. There is so much information you will be thankful you took the time to watch this DVD set. Everything from SIDS to Gulf War Syndrome are gone over. A must have .,1338163200,5,474,4.576470588235294
8463487,5,B005AO0358,"If you are a parent, it is YOUR responsibility to be FULLY INFORMED on vaccinations... what's in them, what tests have been done on them, what side effects can be, if and how they can affect the nervous system, etc.  It is the uninformed parent who takes their child in for vaccines and just listens to whatever they are told.  You have to educate yourself.  Mary Tocco does an INCREDIBLE job in this DVD.  It is not boring at all.  She gives tons and tons of statistics and facts.  She's an excellent speaker and has obviously done years and years of research.  If you don't have time to read/ watch more than one resource on vaccines, make it this one for sure!!  I have no affiliation with Mary Tocco at all, I simply bought her DVD at a seminar one time and now have loaned mine out to lots of my friends to share the information with them as well.  I beg you, WATCH this DVD and take notes and then research more on your own!!",1311465600,10,931,4.244318181818182
