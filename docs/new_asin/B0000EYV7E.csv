1937978,5,B0000EYV7E,"I bought this DVD as a Christmas present for my 3 year old son.  I was amazed that he actually sat still and watched it.  He normally runs around and watches at the same time.  It's been less then a week and he now knows most of his letter sounds.  With me operating the DVD remote control, he can play the game and gets most of the sounds right.  This DVD is amazing, the music is catchy and my son loves it.",1072742400,,409,3.9390243902439024
1937979,5,B0000EYV7E,"This video is great.  I have a 5, 3, and 1 year old and I put it in for the first time on Christmas day and each of them really liked it.  I bought the video at Wal-Mart for $10 in case any of you want to find it cheaper.  And I have another suggestion for a video that this site didn't have.  If you like this movie and want something catchy that will hold your children's interest try ""Chica Chica Boom Boom"".",1072569600,,411,3.9156626506024095

1937981,5,B0000EYV7E,I bought this DVD on a Thursday morning and by Friday afternoon both of my boys (just turned 3 and 4) knew EVERY letter and EVERY letter sound from A-Z!  I have never been so amazed by a video.  I can teach my 4 year old to read.  Both of the boys go around the house all day singing the letter sounds.  I am not kidding when I say they know EVERY letter and sound from A-Z.  I suggest everyone buy this video.  I'm just hoping they come out with letter flash cards to match the letters in the video.,1072396800,,500,3.95

1937992,5,B0000EYV7E,"This video has really helped my 2 year old learn his phonics. He'll sit down and watch the entire movie in one sitting (about 30 minutes), which is quite a feat considering his short attention span. The songs are catchy, the voice acting is great, the story is a lot of fun, and the animation is surprisingly a lot better than what I was expecting (I thought it'd be akin to 90s cartoons, but it's much better). Overall a wonderful DVD that belongs in every toddler's library.",1523836800,,476,4.482758620689655

All three of our kids have loved this video and have learned both their letters and sounds at a very early age.  It has a catchy tune to help encourage young learners.

She goes around the house singing the letters and their sounds. Its given her confidence and pride. Its also excellent for my 2 year old, and shes already saying the sounds the letters make. Its entertaining and educational for both of my kids, so that is a win!",1523059200,,392,4.458333333333333

1938001,5,B0000EYV7E,"I don't personally *love* this, but my daughter sure does! This DVD was recommended to us by a doctor that swore by it with his kids. In the week we've had it, my 3 year old daughter has really learned a lot. She walks around singing the song and saying the different letter sounds. She wants to know what different words start with and likes to sound them out. I think it'll help us with reading as she continues to learn.",1522540800,,423,4.234567901234568

1938005,5,B0000EYV7E,"Outstanding video!! This is one of the early Leap Frog videos it is great at teaching children the names and sounds of letters. I also love Mystery Code Capers, it teaches diagraphs and the final silent e. The Math Circus is great for teaching the number to 0-10, skip counting by 10's and adding with in 10. I am not a huge fan of any of the newer videos. I have them but the voices are annoying and they don't focus on specific skills like the earlier videos.",1522108800,,461,4.25
1938006,5,B0000EYV7E,"This is a great video and my daughter learned her letter sounds that helps her to learn how to read.

1938024,5,B0000EYV7E,"My younger boys are watching this a couple times a week. In just a matter of two or three weeks, they went from only knowing one or two letter to knowing THE SOUNDS of over half of them. In another month, I'm pretty sure they'll have all of them learned. And they really like the video. The song goes along with the LeapFrog fridge phonics set. I have tried so many things to teach these boys their letters and letter sounds.

1938028,5,B0000EYV7E,"Here comes review number 2000 and change, from the grandfather of a two year old and four year old.  This new generation of pre-schoolers has access to a vast array of junk videos carelessly designed from a curriculum standpoint.  We are flooding their minds with educational pablum.  These leapfrog DVD's have been carefully and thoughtfully designed by authors who are paying attention to phonics.  C does not say see, it says kuh.  B does not say Bee, it says buh buh buh.  All of this is packaged in a framework that kids love.

The grandkids are already watching and rewatching the letter factory video.  These dvd's are the best buy at Amazon, bar none, if you have pre-schoolers.",1520726400,,686,4.754237288135593

1938032,5,B0000EYV7E,"I was skeptical of this DVD (or any phonics DVD for that matter), but my son's preschool teacher recommended it to help with letter recognition and retention.  I really love his teacher and trust her opinion, so I went ahead and purchased it.  I am blown away with how entertained my (almost) 5-year old was.  He had been struggling with phonics/letter recognition, and to be honest, he doesn't ""learn well"" from me, so attempts at supplementing his schoolwork at home was pointless.  After watching this DVD, I noticed him putting more effort into recognizing letters around the house or within our conversations.  I know the DVD had a great deal to do with that because he would repeat the little rhymes when sounding out letters.  It's also just long enough to keep his attention while still packing all of the letter info in it.

I would definitely recommend this for any child in the 2-4 year old range who are just learning or are struggling with letter sounds/recognition.",1520380800,,979,4.791666666666667
1938033,5,B0000EYV7E,"I used this when my older kids were younger. I recently bought again for my youngest son who's 2 and my older kids (15 & 16) remembered the entire video. Great educational buy, would buy again!!",1520294400,,194,4.416666666666667

1938038,2,B0000EYV7E,"I purchased this because of the rave reviews, but I guess I didn't realize how out-dated the cartoon is.  My child lost interest so fast, it looks like it was created in the 90's. I really like the story-line and how they have creative words for each letter sound, but I think LeapFrog needs to re-make this cartoon to keep it more updated.",1519776000,,340,4.396825396825397

A lady on YouTube recommended this video that helped her kids learn the abc's. I ordered it asap lol.  She also said that using an abc puzzle along with making letters with Play-Doh really got her kids interested in wanting to learn since it was fun.  Once I got the dvd he cried saying he didn't want to watch it.  Put that sucker in and hit play and a few minutes later he wasn't crying but actually watching it. He still doesn't know all the letters and sounds but this is helping. We've only watched it once and he was saying some of the sounds..... so cute!! At the end it goes to the menu and you can play a game on finding which letter makes the sound they ask and you use your DVD remote to move around to pick the letter.

Literally I can sing the song ""The A says-"" and she will answer ""ah"", or ""the B says"" - ""buh"". It is crazy! My six year old watched this when he was 3-4 years old and then we lost it. He is almost finished with kindergarten and has done amazing with reading.

One is at an average reading level, and the 2-year-old, I will let you know!

I found that is really holds my kids interest.  It is sing-songy and repetitive - which is great for learning.  Parents, it isn't the most horrible thing that I've had to listen to - I'd give it a 3/10, 10 being the most annoying.",1489968000,,627,4.299145299145299

1938259,1,B0000EYV7E,"I have an alternate opinion.  My wife and I took a very advanced course on teaching your baby to read.  Our child is already reading many words at 17 months but I thought he would still enjoy this DVD.  Turns out the it only teaches capital letters, which is the opposite of what we were taught.  In general, words are written 90% in lower case so those are more important to teach first.  I was very excited to show this to my son after reading such great reviews but the second I realized it was in capital, I cringed because it will only confuse him to teach both at the same time.  So unfortunately, to teach a kid to read by showing only capital is not advantageous so I cannot vouch for this.  Also, my son wasn't interested in it at all and he usually will be glued to it on the rare occasion we turn on the TV.",1479686400,,818,4.1069182389937104

1938278,5,B0000EYV7E,"I truly believe that this DVD is a must have for all children. We have had it for years, all three of my children have loved it. Now my youngest has been enjoying it (since he was 3, he is now just four) and even my NOW 7.5 and 9 year olds (who grew up with it) still get locked into it in the car and want to watch. Specifically with my youngest, he was not the child who wanted to learn, couldn't pick up the alphabet, just had ""better things to do"" and always chose playing over learning or writing at school. Starting this DVD with him immediately sparked his interest in writing, doing some sit down work at preschool, and always telling me what letter things start with and what sounds each letter makes. I'm very pleased with how this DVD has stood the test of time and been one of the best items we've owned.  I also can't recommend leap pads enough, my kids have all had the pads from  The original leap pad through the leap pad 2, ultra, and now the epic.  This is definitely the very best of the leapfrog DVDs!  now we play it in the car as well as at home,  The only improvement I suggest is a digital copy !",1477785600,,1120,4.095890410958904

Nothing can replace reading to your child, but this very engaging movie is a fantastic addition. As soon as they learned their letter sounds (anywhere from 15 months to 2 1/2) I'd catch them trying to sound out words they came across. No, a 2 year old doesn't need to know their letter sounds yet, but I think for my kids it led to an early love of reading, which has served them very well in school and life.",1475539200,,531,4.165048543689321

I was even afraid there could be some type of dyslexia. I did a google search and found other parents with my same concerns, some of them recommended this movie. I am pleasantly surprised as to how much it helped, instead of the boring review I provided it made it fun and entertaining and I believe that helped with her retention. The movie makes the letter names and sounds catchy so that they are easy to remember. Can't give it enough praise.",1475366400,,684,4.3515625

He learns other skills at an above average level but just lacks the attentiveness to follow along with the class on letters and sounds.  I was reluctant to buy this but am so glad I did.  He normally prefers shows like Daniel Tiger and Curious George which are E/I so I thought at best he would watch this once and be done with it.  He has preffered this video over the other shows for several days so fae and watches in the morning and afternoon.  He is noticeably better with letters and sounds as well am I.

Most kids video's would make you crazy listening to it over and over, but not this one...at least for me. The flash cards that came with it matched the cute drawings on the video.

1938451,5,B0000EYV7E,This is my second purchase of this dvd. My now three year old enjoys watching this dvd and has learned her letters better and their sounds. After only watching it two times she was asking what sounds letters made during the day and was singing the song for that letter from the movie. This movie is wholesome and has no innuendoes or themes our family tries to stay away from. The voices and songs are not annoying for an adult to hear over and over again. My daughter enjoys watching thus multiple times a week and has grown in her interest in letters another sounds. We started watching this when she was around two years and it held her attention and helped her learn the letters and what they looked like. I would recommend this as an educational dvd for a classroom or home learning.,1469145600,,788,4.441379310344828

So I had been wondering how to keep him feeling challenged and engaged in his love of letters. This video was the answer. He learned his letter sounds immediately and loves watching it. Such a catchy tune that now whenever I ask the sound of a letter I say, ""the M says...?"" and he completes the line.

This has even enabled him to start sounding out words. He figured out how to spell ""stop"" when I isolated the sounds for him. He figures out the first letters of words.

I was honestly a little hesitant because I did not know if it would hold his attention like the other shows he loves to watch (Blaze, PJ Mask etc.) For $6, I figured worst comes to worst, I can give it to another friend and see if their child likes it. Well, he loves it! It has been at least 3 weeks and we still watch it every morning while I get my day started. He loves singing the Alphabet song and within a week he knows all the sounds of the alphabet! Not only that, he is excited and is so proud to show off his skills!

1938661,5,B0000EYV7E,This has taught all 5 of our kids their letters now!  It is entertaining enough for a distraction time for 8 and 9 year olds too.  Very grateful to have this resource as step 1 to reading.  The English alphabet stinks and there is no one video to teach all sounds an E makes.  See and set.  Very tough but this preps them great for teach your child to read in 100 easy as the next step.  Love it!,1461542400,,396,3.949367088607595

His struggle area in Preschool as affiliating the sounds with each letter of the alphabet and he has done wonderfully learning each letter with its corresponding sound in addition to his preschool worksheets he completes.

1938691,5,B0000EYV7E,"I bought this because I was impressed that my friend's 2-and-a-half-yr-old could identify letters.  She said all she did was let him watch this video once a day, every day.  I am by no means advocating pressuring little kids to read, but I decided letting my daughter watch a 20-minute cartoon was feasible.  She loved the video and she also knows her letters and their sounds.  I NEVER drilled her or asked her to do anything.  One day, I simply asked her if she knew what letter a magnetic letter on a refrigerator was.  She did -- in fact, she knew more than half of them!  If your child likes music, it's great.  If not, it may not be the best video... my nephew doesn't like music or nursery rhymes and he showed NO INTEREST in this video.",1460246400,2,744,4.340579710144928

It keeps their attention and before you know it little phonic sounds start coming out of their sweet mouths. My oldest was in first grade when I had my second born start watching. She was struggling to read. Within a week she was reading on grade level and has exceeded that ever since. All of my reading aged children read 2-3 grade levels above their grade. My now 9 month old has already started saying his phonic sounds along with the video. A great resource!

At two years old they can say and recognize the whole alphabet (lowercase and uppercase), My four year old started writing the letters correctly without any prompting at about three years old.

The first day he asked to watch this video three times in a row - the only time he's ever done that. Within a week he was beginning to write a couple of letters on his own. We played the game on the DVD and he got some of the answers right. My two year old is enjoying the DVD as well and I predict will learn his letters by the time he's 3.

When paired with lots of being read to and games we played with recognizing letters and short words, my son was actually reading at the start of kindergarten.

My three year old daughter will request to watch it.  After the third time, she almost had it all down.  They do a great job of putting music to each sound and letter to help with comprehension of the material.  I am a high school special education teacher and was really impressed with this video.  I also liked that it is not scary at all and has a good message of working together.  My one year old daughter will sit and watch it as well.  She can even say some sounds and letters because of it.  Anytime you put music to learning the comprehension is so much faster.  Very affordable price too!  I love that it is under $10.

CONS: 3 of the letters are incorrect. Q, W and Y.

1938874,5,B0000EYV7E,"I can't say enough good things about this video! My young 5 year old has been struggling to remember his letters and sounds in Preschool. When we would work with him at home it was a fight getting him Intrested at all. His teacher recommended getting the letter factory to have him watch as ""homework"". I purchased it for $7 on Amazon and it was the best purchase I've ever made! Instead of having him watch it at home every day I just keep it on repeat in the car while we are running errands. After a few short weeks my little guy knows every letter and sound and he LOVES to say them. He even has picked out a favorite letter and loves to play with anything to do with the alphabet. We've now started him on simple I Am Sam books. It's amazing that a month ago he couldn't tell me what sound A made! My 2 year old can now identity many letters and asks constantly what each letter says. At this rate she may be reading in a year. Anyhow, get this video.

I read a lot of reviews before buying it and I can recall a teachers review saying that it did not include lower case letters (as a bad thing), but I found that when my kids were learning the sounds, they were exposed to letters in many other ways as well- there are letters everywhere you go, and most kids know how to recognize and say their letters by the time they are watching this dvd. My kids are now 6 and 7 and are both top readers in their classes and are each reading 3 grade levels above their own. I credit this dvd and only a few other things: reading to them nightly, introducing sight words (in a fun way) as soon as they started to show an interest in reading, and going to the library often.

1939030,5,B0000EYV7E,"We started watching this video a few times a week when my daughter was about 20 months old. My husband and I would drink our coffee and wake up and she'd drink juice and watch the show. At 2 years old, she knew her entire alphabet, is learning the sounds of each letter, and still loves the movie. It's a really good show that builds in letter association with each letter's theme. She routinely will say, 'H says Ha', or 'K for kick'. We're amazed. She is just over 2 years old and has learned so much. It helps that she loves learning, and while we don't push her, we encourage her curiosity. I definitely recommend this movie.",1439337600,,629,4.338983050847458

There are a few sounds that are not taught such as c can make the K sound and S sound but it only covers the K sound.  It wasn't hard to teach them those extra sounds once the majority was learned.

My children were able to begin reading early and still love books today.  The only disappointment I have is that they do not offer this dvd as an option to buy on Amazon Instand Video.  I really would pay more for this version then all the other ones I've seen so far.",1438905600,,607,3.975206611570248

1939191,5,B0000EYV7E,"We bought this video because our 4 year old was having trouble remembering his letters just using flash cards.  We noticed that he memorized his movies word for word so we thought an alphabet video was the key.  It worked like a charm!  Not only did he love the video and memorize his letters by sight, now he also knows the sounds they make and is quickly learning to write them!  We couldn't be more pleased with this video and because our 2 year old daughter loves to watch it also, she will know her letters before we know it.  Although this is not a replacement for traditional teaching methods, it is a great addition, as children all learn differently.  It does not bother me that the letters in the video are all capital because as I have home schooled my children I have always focused on capital letters and introduced lower case letters later.  It's a little overwhelming for children to have to learn both at once.",1428969600,,926,4.476190476190476

They say it wrong in the first part of the video and then correctly in the second part.  My kids learned how to say them wrong from watching this video.  Pretty pathetic for an educational DVD.  I called the company twice to notify them about this.  They said they would have a manager call me back, which never happened. They obviously don't care.",1426982400,,481,4.288888888888889

1939270,5,B0000EYV7E,I was a Kindergarten teacher for 29 years.  I purchased this to loan to K. students having difficult learning their letters.  It helped learn them better than any other video or game I've seen.  I had the older version and it was good.  But the newer one is even better.,1425254400,,270,4.34
1939271,5,B0000EYV7E,Best DVD I can imagine for my 2 year old girl.  This DVD has taught her the alphabet fast.  Since this purchase we have bought most of the other Leap frog DVD's.  I would highly recommend Numberland also.,1425254400,,204,4.315789473684211
1939272,5,B0000EYV7E,"My child has been watching this DVD since he was 10 months old.  Now that he's over 2, he still loves watching it and has learned how to sound out some letters.  He knew the alphabet entirely right around when he turned 2 and I attribute part of that to his love of this DVD.  I bought it on recommendation from a friend who has two older children.  My child gets super excited when I turn this on and always wants to watch it again when it's done.  The DVD helps your child learn the alphabet but also the phonetics of each letter.  I do have slight issues with how the letters ""L"" and ""R"" are sounded out.  The letter ""L"" is pronounced ""ull"" instead of ""la"" so when they say the word ""lollipop,"" it's pronounced ""ull ull lollipop.""  Wouldn't one pronounce it as ""la la lollipop""?  The letter ""R,"" according to the DVD is sounded out as ""err"" instead of ""ruh"" so when they say the word ""racing,"" they pronounce it as ""err err racing."" Wouldn't it be ""ruh ruh racing?""  Either way, my kid loves this DVD and has learned quite a lot despite these two nuances.",1425168000,,1058,4.271356783919598

1939275,5,B0000EYV7E,"I ordered this upon recommendation from a friend... and was VERY pleased with the video.

After watching it twice, my toddler started connecting the sounds of letters with their names.  He started talking about the words we were using in conversation (""enjoy"" ...""n"" sound).  It was really great to see his eyes light up when he made these connections throughout the day!

The video kept his attention, and apparently the portion of the video discussing letter ""Q"" is hilarious, because my son breaks out into belly laughter when that portion comes on.

There are a number of other reviews already detailing what happens in the story, so I'll be brief, but basically one of the frog kids (Tad) visits all the different ""rooms"" in the letter factory where the baby letters learn to make their sounds.  It's a really cute way to associate the name of the letter with its phonetic sound -- which can be pretty difficult for little ones sometimes.

Also, since this is a video -- there's the added bonus of sight association with the letter names and sounds.",1424908800,,1054,4.758241758241758

My 2.5 year old son learned all the letter sounds after watching this just a few times. The video uses song, characters, and actions that the child is able to associate with each letter.  (Ex: Letter P  ""Puh, puh, pops!""  into popcorn.  The letter F has wings and flies.  The letter R is a race car, ect..).  This DVD is both entertaining and educational.",1424908800,,479,4.5

Because of the focus on her speech, she learned her sounds but was having difficulty connecting the names of the letters to those sounds.  This flipped the switch for her.  In a matter of weeks she now knows all of her letters names and can correspond them to their correct sound.  She has been in speech therapy but was still having difficulty forming a couple sounds.  After the last few weeks, she has made vast improvements with her speech as well.  My 3 and 2 year old also love it and have started identifying many letters and the sounds they make.

1939485,5,B0000EYV7E,"I have been letting my 21 month old son watch this while I fix dinner sometimes over the last month or so. I have been amazed that he now recognizes all of his letters (all uppercase and most lowercase), and I haven't worked with him very much at all about letters. He also knows each one's correct sound. And he's only seen this video 7 or 8 times! We have a lot of letter manipulatives around the house (like letter magnets and letter puzzle pieces), and he carries them around proclaiming their name and sound. He will say ""O says ahh"" and ""C says kkk"". Before seeing this video, he only recognized a few letters like T, S, and O. He loves letters and points them out all the time. My older son (now 4) enjoys watching it too, even though he has started reading now and has known his letter sounds for a long time.

I recommend this video to anyone with young children. This is one video I don't mind letting my kids watch; I can see that it is having a strong impact on my son's learning.",1416960000,,992,4.221052631578948

1939523,5,B0000EYV7E,"Like most people say, this is a great product for toddlers.  How quickly a child learns is, of course, dependent on the child but generally toddlers will pick up sounds within a month or two at the latest.

It's fun and has been thought out well.  Each letter is made fun to learn through audio and visual aids in the form of 'rooms' for each letter.  This helps kids learn through positive stimulation.  Plus it's a great product to keep kids occupied when trying to feed fussy kids !  We put it on and let our kid concentrate on the video whilst we feed him.

The proof that it works for us was when we recently went to a friend's house and they were amazed when our under 2 years old toddler picked up toy letters and pronounced their sounds - when their daughter (who is older) couldn't.  They asked us how he knew his letters and we pointed them to the Letter factory.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1415318400,4,894,4.337349397590361

It doesn't do a whole lot to keep the interest of the child--your average educational television show (Super Why is a good example because it also teaches letter recognition and sounds) does a much better job of that. The story line is just boring. Overall, it's fine but I wouldn't purchase it again.",1414195200,,427,4.706666666666667

1939598,3,B0000EYV7E,"It's okay... but my 2 yo is not very interested. It has more of a story line to it, and he likes straight learning videos that review ABC's and such, so he gets bored with it. Probably better for slightly older children.",1411516800,,220,4.261904761904762

1939611,5,B0000EYV7E,"I purchased this movie for my 5 and 3 year olds. My 5 year old has experienced many speech delays, thus was quite behind on his letters and letter sounds and this movie was recommended to me. I would highly recommend this to any parent of a young child. In two weeks, my 5 year old knows all his letter sounds (and is already beginning to read three-letter words by sounding out the letters), my 3 year old knows all her letter names and sounds. It is an amazing feeling to have your fresh 3 year old point to signs in a grocery store and say ""I know what that letter says! the A says Ahh!""

The movie is fun and keeps the kids' attention, which results in learning. I love that my children love this movie and that they don't even realize they are learning! They have both stated that this is their ""favorite movie"" and I have just purchased three more LeapFrog movies to help with learning!!",1411430400,,893,4.284023668639053

I was having the hardest time with teaching her letter recognition by using flash cards, games, and anything else I could find. A friend suggested this dvd and my baby girl learned her letters and sounds in one month. She did learn her sounds first and then the letter names but who cares right? I'm super excited! I also bought the Talking words dvd so that we can move onto the next step of her learning jojrney. Did I mention that now she can't get enough of talking about the alphabet. Whether we are passing a sign on the street or looking at labels in the store, the kid is obsessed with the alphabet! This was the best purchase of my life!",1410134400,,776,4.321917808219178

1939656,5,B0000EYV7E,"While this video is not perfect, it has been such an amazing aid to teach my two older children phonics.  They are entertained, and they better remember the sounds through the fun examples provided.  Our oldest child (boy) began watching it at age 2.5/3 years, and our second child (girl) is now watching it at age 3.  We have checked it out from our local library systems each time, but this would be a great addition to your home collection of educational videos.  The catchy song is something you can sing with your kids over and over to teach phonics as you play or ride in the car.  This video helped me to better teach the sounds by giving me clear examples and tools (the song).  I would drill our son on the sounds in the years to come until I was sure he had each sound remembered well (i.e. What letter does ""popcorn"" begin with). To be clear, there is an issue with the characters lying as another reviewer has pointed out.  However, it is a subplot that can be addressed with your children.  We do not live in a perfect world, and it is always best to watch the shows WITH your children so you can address any values that do not align with those of your family.  Also, while our kids love this video and will watch it over and over and over, other kids may not relate to its style.  Our kids pretty much only watch educational cartoons and videos with a few quality movies thrown in - that *may* make a difference.  Either way, give it a test run when you feel your kiddos are ready.  For us, it has been best to watch after our kids firmly learned the names of the letters, although, the sounds of the letters is really more important to reading.",1409529600,,1659,4.29903536977492
1939657,5,B0000EYV7E,I ordered these for birthday gifts (2 girls turning 4). They love them I already own it at my house.

1939659,3,B0000EYV7E,"Okay but it does teach several of the consonants incorrectly.  The ""R"" is taught to say ""err"" instead of ""ruh.""  Same with the L sound.  This matters when kids start trying to sound out words and also when trying to spell them.  We end up with brds and grils instead of birds and girls.  As a phonics teacher this drives me nuts.",1409270400,,329,4.241935483870968
1939670,5,B0000EYV7E,This is about the 5th time I have purchased this DVD.  I buy it for all my friends because it worked so well with my son.

1939672,5,B0000EYV7E,This is the best DVD for preschoolers out there! I have two older girls that learned to read at five and four years old. (My oldest daughter is now eight and reading Harry potter and the pegasus series. My second daughter is now almost six and has been reading short chapter books like Tree house and Junie B.) I believe this DVD was a huge part of their success with reading. They would watch this intermittently starting when they were two and three yrs. I also have a son who is three years old watching it.  After one week he had mastered most of his letter sounds. He is on track to start sounding out three letter words by the time he turns four. This DVD is worth the money and your kids tv time! The songs are addictive too.  :),1409184000,,736,4.212765957446808

1939695,5,B0000EYV7E,"Great DVD to engage your children who ""don't want to learn"".  Our son was disinterested in learning his letters.  He would just not focus or even try to learn or recall his letters when we asked him.  This was a concern of ours, since his preschool/daycare classmates were moving ahead of him.  Read on some forum that this DVD was recommended by teachers.  Decided to give it a try, and to my surprise, our son picked up his letters and sounds right away.

Very highly recommended.",1407283200,,482,4.546511627906977

However, we lost the first video (or lended it out??) and so I purchased another.  This was advertised as a 2-disc 50th anniversary edition.  Sounded great!  But that is not what I received.  It was just the basic DVD.  I was bummed, but will keep it.**EDITED TO ADD: After talking with Amazon they offered to replace the item.

1939801,5,B0000EYV7E,"We bought this DVD to use as a tool to help our son to learn sounds and letters. He has been slow to talk so we watch this DVD with him and encourage him to make the sounds. We select the scene where they start with the letters and skip the intro- it's a little wordy. He loves the letters and has started making some of the sounds! He wants to watch it over and over again. Very cute and fun.

Update:: we have been watching the DVD together for over 2 months now and our son can recognize all of the letters and can make most of the sounds (Q, R, S are hard!). It's amazing! It has really helped him with speech and it's fun to watch him master these letters and sounds! Our SLP also raved about the DVD and recommends it often to parents with young kids with a speech delay.",1399075200,,777,4.012903225806451

1939803,5,B0000EYV7E,"I had heard great things about this DVD, but I was skeptical of some of the glowing reviews.  Still, I figured it was worth a try.

After my three and four-year-old watched it the first time, they begged to watch it again.  For several days, they immersed themselves in it.  That has subsided, but this DVD is still a favorite in our house, and even if they never watched it again, I would still say we got our money's worth because of how much they were able to learn from it.  By the second day of watching it, they knew every letter sound on the DVD!  Now, when we go places, they will point to signs, identify, the letters, and I will start singing the song that goes with every letter in this DVD (to the tune of the Farmer in the Dell), ""The A says...,"" they will say, ""Ahhh,"" and then we are on our way to sounding out a word.  It is absolutely amazing!  I like to think I have particularly bright kids, but they have never been identified as child prodigies or anything, just typical kids with a love of learning.

We are a homeschooling family and use it to supplement Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons, which I also recommend, although that book is not as fun as the Letter Factory DVD for them, and I think it would have taken them a lot longer to grasp phonics if we had not supplemented with the DVD.  Even if your child is not yet in school or attends a preschool outside of the home, I still highly recommend this DVD.  It is both entertaining (for its intended audience, anyway...even for parents, it's not so bad you'll be wanting to stab your ears with Q-tips to make the singing go away like with some children's programming) and educational.

My only regret is that we did not get it sooner.",1398816000,,1722,4.280864197530864

1939929,3,B0000EYV7E,Most people swear by their kids learning their letters through this DVD. It didn't work for any of mine but each child learns differently. This video only teaches the uppercase letters and only teaches one sound when in fact some letters have multiple sounds which isn't necessarily bad but it definitely doesn't teach your kids all about letter sounds although there are the basics. I think they did a great job animating how the sounds should go to give a child a reminder about the sounds but some of the consonant letters give a vowel sound first rather than just the consonant sound. All of my children are very much hands on learners and so maybe it's a learning style issue as to why none of them caught on with this and didn't make a good reinforcement to learning the letters for my kids. However it is a very cute video and works well for most kids.,1386115200,,859,4.477707006369426

1939955,5,B0000EYV7E,"My daughter had this when she was about 3 (now 8), and she loved it. She watched it all the time, and when she started preschool, she could single out each letter and their sounds, which was apparently a pretty big deal compared to some of the other children in her class. It gave her a great foundation for beginning to read and sound out her words.
So now that my son is getting older, we wanted to start playing this for him as well, and we're also hoping it will help his speech therapy along. We couldn't find the one we used to have, so started looking for a new one. I found a listing on Amazon that had the same cover artwork as our original, but was way more than we wanted to pay. We went ahead with this one, hoping the format of the show was the same, and it's the EXACT same video, just with updated artwork, and way cheaper!! The DVD arrived quickly and brand new, in perfect condition. Yes, the animation looks a little outdated, but my kids watch all the newest movies as well my old cartoons from the 80's, so this isn't an issue at our house.

Since my daughter's success with it when she was young, I have and will continue to recommend this product!",1383609600,,1169,4.21875

My son (2yrs) LOVES this DVD. You could immediately see him picking up on sounds and letter shapes. We would sing the songs and sounds together and have a blast. I would even hear him mumbling letters while he was laying down for a nap or at bedtime.

Of course we work with him on his letters and sounds beyond this DVD and others, but he now knows all of the sounds in any order and can pick any letter out of a pile or on paper. Lowercase is still a work in progress, but I am very proud of him.

We also picked up one of the 3 Disc DVD sets which had Numbers Ahoy, Amazing Amusement Park and some story related DVD. They are good as well, but the Alphabet Factory is still the best and most well put together in my opinion.",1381881600,,931,4.048913043478261

I am not writing a load of Tosh from a teachers perspective or a psychologist point of view. Simply from a mother of a toddler. Being Scottish living in the USA (where they pronounce letters different from the rest of the world) it is already a learning curve for me to teach my daughter the American sounds like J (Jiy and Jay ) and Z (Zed and Zee). I was looking for something to go along with our books and flash cards.

This DVD does a great job at keeping up the pace, it gives the sound along with the letter name which makes it easier for my toddler to link the two and the graphics (that someone said looks like 80's graphics) are great. They are sharp and clear from things that might distract. I watched with my daughter to ask her what the letter was each time.

Great learning aid for toddlers.  It has been PROVEN to help children learn ABC's but all kids learn differently so you have to buy this DVD knowing that . Flash cards are great to do with this to help teach lower case letters .",1381708800,,1240,4.197478991596639

I was reluctant to buy because you never know if your child is going to like but I was really surprised at how quickly this DVD became a favorite for both my kids.  It ranks up their with their enjoyment of watching non educational movies such as The Chipmunks and Winnie the Pooh. I introduced a year ago and I have a two and three year old.  They both know the entire alphabet and one of their favorite activities to do now is to sing, ""The A say A...""  They both can sing the entire alphabet that way and everyone is really impressed at how much it has taught them at such a young age.  They also have the coordinating Letter Factory toy and love that as well.

My second son is now 3, and begs me to watch this DVD constantly! He is ""getting it!"" They ALL seem to ""get it"" when watching this!
I strongly encourage this purchase, followed soon by the ""Talking Words Factory."" I'm not sure if that is on Amazon.com, but I'll be searching for it soon.

I also bought the Numberland DVD and a few others but this has been the one all the kids ask for. The way i starts is with a family of turtles going on a family trip to see the family owned letter factory. It has a happy mood all the way through and keeps children is somewhat of a trance. Very creative way of making kids learn letters and the sounds they make by making it fun and musical. The best movie I have bought for her so far.

This is the first movie that my son actually watched and sat through (and interacted with), as he's not much of a tv/movie watcher.

Overall, I was surprised by the lower quality of animation.  It seems like an older cartoon.  Her favorite show (and pretty much only thing she watches for 30 minutes each day) is Super Why on PBS, and I was expecting it to look more like that...but, maybe my expectations were just unrealistic?

I decided to purchase this video hoping that the songs may help her a bit. Little did I know how much she would love this video (it did take a few times for her to get into this DVD however). She requests for this DVD and I gladly put it on b/c I hear her sing the sounds of the letters as she dances to the music. It's a joy watching her learn.

1940144,5,B0000EYV7E,"Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!
This is the most fun and creative DVD for teaching Letter recognition and sound.
I bought this when my daughter was 18-month old. She doesn't like letters no matter how I present it -- magnetic letters, flash card etc. She loves numbers and can count from 1 to 10 but not consistently correct. She sometimes skip a number. She also cannot recognize numbers yet but she loves it. So what I did, I purchased Numberland and Letter Factory at the same time. I figure if I let her watch Numberland, she'll love it because it's about numbers and get use to the Leapfrog format and sure enough she got addicted to that. Recognize Numbers 1 to 10 in less than a week and was able to count consistently correct from 1 to 10. In the same note, when I presented Letter Factory in the same week, she was hooked to learning letters.
In 2 weeks, she was able to recognize about 50% of the alphabet. This is amazing development from a child who has zero interest on letters. I will pick up a letter and she screams excitedly what letter it is. There are few occassions that she was sleeping then she screamed E F G then when I checked her, she was sleeping... LOL. Having this DVD for a month now, she can recognize letters from A to Z. When we read at night, she points to the capital letters in the book and name it to me. Same goes with numbers. She is starting to say the sound of the letters too.
I rented at the local library some DVDs about alphabets (after the success of Letter Factory in our house) such as Brainy Baby, Meet the Letters, Babyscape etc etc -- they are also good but not great like Letter Factory. I let my child watch those to present the letters in different way. All the DVDs I named above have very similar presentation -- showing the letters, saying what letter it is and what sound(s) they make. Letter Factory on the otherhand is very creative in their presentation. The song is very catchy. One of those that sticks to your head. The way they teach the sound of the letter is very creative and funny for kids too like for example for letter ""A"". Tad (the main character) went to the training room of Letter A then Professor Quigley (the one helping Tad learn the letters) put on a monster suit and said ""Booga Booga Booga"" to scare the Letter A and all the letter ""A"" along with Tad screamed ""AHHHH"" in fear. My daughter loves to scream with the letter A when they make their sound ""AHHHH"". Now, 19-month she thinks sound of letter A is funny.
What makes this DVD superior among others is the creative presentation -- not the typical fashion.
Rating this a perfect 5 for all the reasons I named above but most importantly for delivering a proven result to my daughter.
This DVD helped her and continue to do so.",1369353600,2,2750,4.362573099415204
1940145,5,B0000EYV7E,"My son loooves this video.  This video makes it clever and fun to learn the sounds or the letters.

For the letter A, a furry monster scares a room full of A's and they scream Aaaaaaa! to illustrate the A sound.  My son learned the sound quickly and happily.

We loved it so much we lent it out to everyone we could think of! It was so popular that eventually it got worn out, so we ordered another one!

I have only seen portions of a few Leap Frog videos, and this one stands head and shoulders above all the other ones. Even if you haven't been too impressed with their other materials, definitely give this one a shot! I think you'll find it worth it.",1363132800,,640,4.237704918032787

1940195,5,B0000EYV7E,"My kids love this video. It started with my 4 year old and now my 2 year old can't get enough of it.  My wife saw this at the library and borrowed it.  The kids wanted to rent it every time they went to the library.  I decided to pick it up from Amazon so we wouldn't have to worry about someone else borrowing it and not being able to borrow it ourselves.

Besides the kids loving it...I love it.  My two year old walks around the house and when he sees letters anywhere he will start to make the letter sounds.  He can also put together a letter puzzle with very little help. So, he is actually learning something from this video.  The wife and I don't like letting the kids watch TV too much, but at least with this video they are learning while being entertained....can't say that about many other cartoons and kid shows.  Sure some kid shows teach things, but they don't teach the whole alphabet in a half hour.

All of my kids have learned their beginning phonics through this DVD.  In fact I had lost my original copy and just re-bought it for my two year old. It is that good that I knew we needed to re-buy.

The DVD goes through upper and lower case of each letter.  It shows the kids the letters and the sounds they make.  That is what really helps kids.  They are not just learning to identify but to also sound out the words.  There is an entire series which is also good (but not as good as this beginning DVD).  Then there is the song that tells each letter and sound.  We sing this song around the house all the time.  The thing is they kids are learning without out realizing.  It really is a great foundation for learning letters/sounds and eventually reading.",1362441600,,906,4.264705882352941

The only tv he watches is Super Why and Sesame Street and the occasional toddler movie, so he is not a huge 'sit and watch tv' kid. This did not hold his interest, nor mine, the first several times we tried it. But then he grew more interested in and started interacting with it, repeating the letter sounds and shouting out the letters. Now he asks to watch it at least once a week, and just as my mom friends told me, I have noticed an increase in understanding, as well as interest, in the alphabet, letters and their sounds from him.

I bought this for my two year old and in no time at all, he knew what sound every letter of the alphabet made. He was speech delayed when we decided to buy this, hoping it would help. Boy did it! He was talking when he was two, but his pronunciation of words was off. He has learned so much from this dvd. He can sound out every letter when trying to read, and has been spelling words on his own for over a year (he is 3 1/2 now). He is no longer speech delayed, and I really believe it is because of this dvd. Learning what sounds different letters make has given him the understanding of what sounds to use when he is speaking words. If he pronounced pop as bop, I would simply tell him that pop started with a p and ask him what the p says, and he would then say the word correctly. Now his speech is all caught up and he is advanced with reading and spelling words!! I couldn't ask for more than that from a dvd!!",1359676800,,1071,4.056603773584905

My kids make it through the first 5 minutes and are begging to shut it off. They enjoy the leapfrog toys, but if you are going to show your kids a DVD to teach them letters or sounds I think preschool prep is better (graphics suck but it gets to the point and the information sticks!) and the your baby can read series. Both of my kids watched these along with the Blues Clues shape detectives, at 2 years they could identify all letters, shapes, colors and numbers.

His preschool teacher said in October that she would wait to test his ABC's till January to decide if we needed to hold him back 1 year from kindergarten because he needed to know at minimum 10 letters, but that they prefer 13 letter and 13 sounds.  After only 2 weeks of watching this on a daily basis my son was able to sing the entire alphabet song and could identify at least 10 or more letters.  Then on January 3 my birthday, my son identified 26 letters and 26 sounds as a my gift.

When my son was 22 months old he could tell me the letters and their sounds because of this system. We started with the DVDs. Then we added Fridge Phonics. After a couple months I added the Word Builder.  I only let him have about 10 or 12 letters at a time so he doesn't get overwhelmed. When I had too many out, he would knock them to the floor. He's 28 months old now. He doesn't make real words yet.  But that's coming soon!

But watch out for the fridge magnets. Leapfrog changed the sizes. The Word Whammer and the older Phonics with the Frog have the letters that match.  The ones with Scout the Dog and the Sun match the Jet (word builder).",1357516800,,755,4.371428571428571

At 20 months we were at a store and our daughter started naming the letters on the various signs.  WOW.  At two years old she could identify all letters and make their sounds.  She had the lower case letters down shortly after.  I recommend introducing this video at about 15-24 months. Then introduce them to Phonics Farm and Math adventure to the Moon at about 2 years.

1940314,3,B0000EYV7E,"I won't reiterate what other reviewers have said about the positives of this DVD. I just can't believe no one has commented on how it is totally starring and largely about boys. Before you mistake me for some PC-crazed maniac looking for sexism in every nook and cranny, I can assure you that I am not. But, I have a little girl and it is startling- the dad is the employee at the letter factory, mr. websley is the boss, the professor is male, and of course tad is also. His older brother calls the shots, and at the end when he fakes laryngitis to give tad a chance to host the show, the sister is not even considered! Hey no need for YOU to fake laryngitis, girl! Even most of the letters are male- I did a quick check and it is over 75%. It's just sad for me. It's like when I watched toy story before I had a kid I didn't really notice that the lame bo beep character was the only girl, but now I do.

1940320,5,B0000EYV7E,"There is a reason why the majority of Leapfrog reviews are five stars -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LeapFrog-Letter-Factory/dp/B001TKUXUC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LeapFrog: Letter Factory</a>&nbsp;is the perfect mix of educational content and entertainment. I am convinced that it is one of the best children's DVDs to ever hit the market.

I have two beautiful boys: the oldest is nearly five and the youngest is 18 months. My oldest was diagnosed with PDD-NOS. While he does well in other subjects, he had shown some delays with speech and used to get frustrated and agitated when I tried to sit him down to read.

Six months ago, my best friend suggested I play some educational DVDs for him. She bought me a copy of Letter Factory to play for the oldest. ""Blown away"" best describes how I felt when I saw him fall in love with the DVD. I literally cried I was so happy. Now all he wants to do is watch it. The most amazing part is that not only has his speech has significantly improved, but he has started to read books on his own!

After seeing how great ""Letter Factory"" was for my oldest I tried showing it to my youngest. Unfortunately it was a little too advanced for him, so I did some research on Amazon to find a more age-appropriate DVD and ended up buying the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tiny-Tutor/dp/B0094J4CD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tiny Tutor</a>&nbsp;DVD set. The videos are very simple and slow paced but really hold his attention. After about three months of watching my youngest son has picked up most of the numbers and a few letters. I am saving ""Letter Factory"" for when he is older and actual reading (not just word recognition) becomes more important.

The rest of the Leapfrog series is now on my Christmas list. I know it sounds crazy but ""Letter Factory"" has made me a true believer.

Beyond highly recommended - a must have!

Update - January 2013: As promised, I also bought&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LeapFrog-Talking-Words-Factory/dp/B001U7NW20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LeapFrog: Talking Words Factory</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leapfrog-Numberland/dp/B0064MT1NK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leapfrog: Numberland</a>&nbsp;as Christmas presents for my oldest boy.

1940323,5,B0000EYV7E,"This summer I googled how to help a toddler learn his letters and this video was one of the top five suggestions so I purchased it that day. It is more important that young readers recognize the sound of letters rather than being able to just sing the alphabet.  My son now sees a ""C"" and says it is c-c-cold or a k and tells me it k-k-kicks.  I love it!  I teach seventh grade and now I find myself telling my students--every letter makes a sound, what letter says ____? whenever they are trying to spell a word.

I was amazed now she say's I want frogs. She's referring to the DVD. BUY IT! It's a staple to your collection. I wish now that the company updates the quality of the grafic's. It's so cute I sing with my todler. When were reading books I refer back to the DVD for letter experience with them. K for kick! I will be the best gift you give!

Of course  I reinforce what she has learned by giving her worksheet activities. A must have for preschool children. It WORKS!! Great job leapfrog. Very pleased with this product. I encourage parents to go and GET IT.,1347667200,,440,4.5

1940337,5,B0000EYV7E,"My daughter loves this video.  She watches this video at daycare and is always asking us for ""Letters,"" so we got it for her.  She is just 2 years old and has been able to tell you what the letters are and their sounds for a few months now.  This video is great!  Very educational and keeps the attention of a 2 year old!",1346630400,,321,3.96875
1940338,5,B0000EYV7E,Bought this when my daughter was 17 1/2 months old. She just turned 19 months and knows most all her letters and the phonics associated with those letters solely because of this video.  That is in just 6 weeks.  I play it twice a day (run time is about 40 minutes).  She finds it enjoyable because most of the video is set to music and a fun story line.  Learning should always be this fun for all of us!!!,1346371200,,406,4.10126582278481
1940339,5,B0000EYV7E,This DVD keeps kids watching and it's a fun easy way for kids to learn their phonics. It's especially good if watched often particularly in a car.,1345420800,,146,4.444444444444445
1940340,5,B0000EYV7E,"I was a teacher for 10 years.  My own children, who are toddlers, knew all of their letters and many of the sounds.  However, after watching this DVD twice they know all the sounds.  They love the DVD, and have watched it many times.  I bought the 3 DVD set with flash cards, and they flash cards are a great resource to reinforce what they've learned.  I'm going to start buying this DVD as gifts for anyone in the right age bracket.",1345248000,,434,4.2439024390243905
1940341,5,B0000EYV7E,"My son learned his letters really young, like under 2. He would point them out everywhere we were. But then around 3, he totally forget them. Lack of practice I guess. I would show him letters and ask him to name them, but he acted like he couldn't. Then he watched the letter factory. He asked for it over and over again. After watching it just a few times, he new every single letter and their sounds. I couldn't believe how clearly he could say each sound, since he doesn't always talk perfectly clear. Sometimes he even corrects me. If I say, ""the L says Laaa"", he says, ""No, the L says ullll"" and gives the phoentic sound. Everywhere he go he finds letters in signs, etc, and is always asking me to read what the word says. This video was worth so much, can't say enough about it.",1345075200,,785,4.275167785234899
1940342,5,B0000EYV7E,"This DVD was first introduced to my child at his daycare. I went ahead and purchased it and two weeks later he could say about 10 - 12 of the letter sounds if you prompted him with the little song that is sung in the story.... ""The A says..."" and then he'll say Ahh! We let him watch the DVD about 2 to 3 times a week and 4 to 5 weeks later, he can now say 20 of his letter sounds. We started to play the DVD when he was 16 months and now he is 17 months old. I would definitely recommend this DVD to any parent. And it seems like even for a one-year old, it isn't too early to start! Who knew a one-year-old could recite letter sounds?

I'm so glad we found this DVD. I plan on purchasing the Word Factory DVD later on, maybe around age two and see how that goes. I'm truly amazed by this product. For $10, my child learned the majority of his letter sounds in a month, but after almost a year of watching the My Baby Can Read series.... nothing! Okay, maybe not nothing... he learned to follow the direction ""arms up"" and ""arms down"" from that DVD, but he certainly wasn't reading after watching the series since the age of 3 months. No big surprise to me that the company went under. It made false claims. This DVD by the Letter Factory is FAR FAR cheaper than the $200 My Baby Can Read Series and makes no claims about what your child will learn, and yet review after review, we can clearly tell that the Letter Factory DVD works, and it works quickly.

As a former Pre-K teacher, I will have to agree with the other review about the DVD having errors. It does say that the L says ""ull"" and the R says ""err"" which is incorrect. And it makes me cringe every time I hear the Letter L singing it's ""Uuullll"" song.... because I don't want my child to think that the Letter L says ""ULL"" but I've been reviewing and repeating the correct letter sounds with him for the letter L and the letter R and he seems to adjust accordingly.

Anyway, hands down this is a great product and worth every penny.",1344643200,,1995,4.123393316195373
1940343,5,B0000EYV7E,We bought this product a few months before our son started kindergarten because he was struggling to learn the alphabet and sounds.

Some friends of ours recommended it, saying their kids had all learned their alphabet and each letters sound by watching it.  So far we haven't seen that in our daughter.  She watches the DVD a couple of times a week, but hasn't picked up her alphabet.  The music is catchy, but she tends to get bored about halfway through.  It's not the DVDs fault though - our daughter doesn't watch any TV for an extended period of time.  As a parent that watches it with her, I have to admit the songs and music tend to get a little tiring after the first few times, but if she learns her alphabet and phonics then it is well worth it.",1342569600,,710,4.1838235294117645

In a weeks time, she was able to identify every letter and the correct sound that it makes. In addition, she was suddenly interested in everything alphabet, including the many alphabet books I had bought prior to this dvd but that she was not interested in. We rarely let our daughter watch television, but if I had to recommened a dvd for a child, I would recommend this one.

1940367,4,B0000EYV7E,"My kids LOVE the Leap Frog videos and they've been helpful in teaching them about phonics, math and other topics. A small criticism, though, is that some of the phonics sounds are confusing them. The ""O' doesn't say, ""Ahhhhh"" like the video voiceover says. My four and five year olds said, ""Mom, that's not right."" And the sounds for letters such as L, D and R come out like ""El,"" ""Duh,"" and ""Er,"" which confused my 4 year old when he tried to read the written word. He kept saying, ""ellot,"" duh-og,"" and ""errun"" instead of ""lot,"" ""dog"" and ""run.""

For learning phonics and reading the written word, I prefer a teaching method that teaches sounds, not letters. Kids who come out of preschool know their letters. But then they have to learn everything all over again (sometimes with multiple sounds) when it comes time to learn phonics and begin reading. That being said, it's helpful to have the memorable songs that my kids love, and when my kids get stuck on a sound, I often prompt them with, ""Every letter makes a sound, the f says ....?"" And they come up with the right answer!",1339632000,,1082,4.520408163265306
1940368,5,B0000EYV7E,"I read the many positive reviews and thought, might as well give it a try.  My 23 month old at the time sat down and watched the whole thing through and requested it again the following week.  He has watched it maybe 6 times through and after only 3 times he was sounding out letters of the alphabet on his own.  He LOVES LOVES LOVES LOVES letters now and wherever we are if he sees letters he must stop, touch them and read them out.  He knows the difference between upper and lower case and knows them to be the same letter, he knows the sounds they make and knows an object or a person whose name starts with that letter.  I am thoroughly impressed not only with this DVD, but the others in the set of 3 that I purchased.  I intend to buy others that leapfrog has created.  Well worth the money.  Works great on its own or with other tools, such as flashcards, toys with alphabet, magnetic letters on the fridge.  It all helped and I amazed how quickly my son learned the alphabet.

She knew a few letters here and there, actually only 2 really. I know 3 yr olds aren't SUPPOSED to recognize their whole alphabet, but when you have a 5 yr old who knew all the letter and sounds at 3, it can be a little tough as a parent. I know they are completely different people, but still. Well I would work on letters every single day for a few minutes with my 3 yr old, and she would show NO interest, and never remember what we went over. Well I took advice from another reviewer, and I just have this playing constantly in the car. Okay I bought this TWO weeks ago, and she recognizes EVERY single letter now, and the sounds they make.

And it has produced AMAZING Results!!!
The repetition of the movie, and us allowing multiple viewings...in a 2 week time span he can now recognize and say ALL the letters in the alphabet! He also knows all the sounds to the letters!!!

I let him watch this everyday in the morning and now he knows most of the sounds of the alphabet except for N, R, V, W, X, Y, Z (which I think are really difficult). He says the sound of the F and Q with difficulty, but he tries.

He gets excited when he sees me taking the DVD out of the case and he really is happy to see the movie. It's very engaging.

Now, wherever we go, he would just randomly say a letter he sees like A when he sees Staircase A in Church, or D for the word Drop Off in the Pharmacy, or when we go shopping and he sees big letter signs. This is a great tool for learning and he really loves it. We got him an alphabet puzzle when he was 6 months old and he suddenly took an interest in it after watching The Letter Factory. Of course, complemented with this are reading books to your child, using flashcards and magnetic alphabets. Leapfrog has done a good job with this one!",1333670400,,998,3.9113300492610836

I like that the video isn't too fast-paced or flashy.  The setting is a letter factory where living, talking letters are taught their sounds.  They go through each classroom and show a letter making a sound.  (The Qs quack, the Ss are taught by a snake.)  Then there's a short song about each letter sound.

1940398,5,B0000EYV7E,"If I ever only recommended one learning DVD to a parent of a preschooler - this would be it. We are very careful not to let our children watch a lot of tv. But this DVD is truly beneficial to young preschoolers. I recommend it to every mother and preschool director I meet. It teachers letter recognition and letter sounds through a cute story and catchy tune. And while it focuses on upper-case letters, it also shows the lower-case letters. This DVD will quickly teach young children the main sound each letter makes. It doesn't teach long-vowel sounds and some of the exceptions - but these can be taught at a later age. Parents can easily add other activities to their child's day to supplement letter learning and letter sounds.

When we bought this DVD our daughter was 25 months old, and our son was 17 months old. Just to give you some background - both of our children are adopted and are not biologically related. Our daughter already knew all her letters and within 2-3 viewings could tell us every letter sound. After watching about 3 times a week over the course of the first month our son knew every letter sound. And so by 18 months old, he knew all his letter sounds also. We reinforced letter learning and letter sounds daily - we worked on puzzles together, asked them to find the letters, and tell us the sound. We sang the song in this DVD while we traveled in the car. And we took other opportunities in the day to reinforce what they were learning.

When our daughter turned three and half we jumped ahead to Section 3 in The Ordinary Parent's Guide to Teaching Reading and started on learning to read words. She very easily transitioned to this phonics-based home program (which I also love) and is doing great. She is half-way through the book now and is reading at a second grade level; she is four years old. She is bringing me books through the day to read to me, and taking them when we ride in the car. She is quickly becoming an avid reader. Our son watched as we worked on her reading skills. And he is picking it up even faster. While she was sounding out words - he was already blending them and putting them together at age two. They are both on the way to becoming great readers.

This DVD is one of the absolute best buys for a preschool child. I would recommend for ages 18 months to 3 years old. Add some interactive parenting and this DVD works great.",1332720000,,2390,4.414965986394558

1940405,3,B0000EYV7E,"At first, I got very excited about how effective this DVD seemed to be working on my son and was all set to give this DVD five stars.  The reason I thought that the video worked is because after my son had watched the video for three weeks, he could recite letters and letter sounds because he was mimicking the songs he heard in the video.  I picked up one of his alphabet board books that introduce upper and lowercase letters simultaneously, he did great with identifying most of the letters, so I thought, ""Woo hoo! My son knows almost all of his letters and he just turned four!""

The problem is that I purchased a set of lower case plastic letters to help reinforce what my son learned.  When my son was younger, I tried without success to get him to learn all of his letters without the aid of videos.  Before this video, he only firmly knew a few.  After a few weeks of this video, I was surprised and a little disappointed to find that my son only knew a handful of the lowercase letters.  He misidentified or simply didn't know any of the other lowercase letters. I am satisfied with the start this video gave him and the progress he made, but I simply can't celebrate, rest on my laurels, and move on if he is not firm in those letters.

The reason him not knowing all of the lowercase letters is a big deal is because anyone who has a child or has had a child in kindergarten knows that your child mostly learns lowercase letters in K and is asked to apply the knowledge of those lowercase letters in school.  If you personally are home-schooling, then obviously your child can learn the letters at their own pace, but not so if they are in school.  Your child is tested often (in most public schools, anyway) on that knowledge of lowercase letters and is expected to know some sight words involving lowercase letters in school.  If you are a Generation X-er, Kindergarten is not the way it was in the early eighties where it is okay for a five-year-old to mostly know uppercase letters; the standards have changed.  A lot more is expected of your son or daughter.  Your child will not got an A for effort if he or she knows primarily uppercase letters.  Every parent that is going, ""My child knows all the letters after only one week of watching Leapfrog Letter Factory!""  I ask you to thoroughly test your child on all lowercase letters not accompanied by their uppercase partners - out of order! - before you come to this conclusion.

Besides, as a few reviewers correctly pointed out most books are written in lowercase letters and it is a little easier for your child to pick up reading well after K if they are firm in their knowledge of the lowercase letters.

I think that if you have effectively introduced your child to lowercase letters and then you are using this video to reinforce those letters your child knows, that's different.  That said I think what's most important is that your child will have good phonemic awareness of all the letters after watching this video several times and know some of their lowercase letters, especially lowercase letters that look like the uppercase letters, c, p, o, k, u, v, w, x, y, z, etc.

Another point I want to make about this video is the style in which it is presented. I am one of those parents that do let my kids watch cartoons and this particular LeapFrog DVD is very much like the cartoons my kids enjoy, so it did engage them.  If you don't let your child watch much TV or hardly any cartoons and want a learning video without a zany cartoon plot and kind of eccentric characters, this is probably not the video for you or your child.  Or if you yourself are kind of conservative and prefer characters who are a little more sedate and pious to help teach your little one their letters, then you probably will not like this video for your child.

Otherwise, I can only recommend this video for reinforcement of what you or another medium has already taught your child in the way of lowercase letters.",1331596800,7,3975,4.453793103448276

As the mother of a 2 1/2 year old daughter this has been unbelievable! Beforehand, she didn't know any of her letters muchless the sounds that they made! We bought this DVD due to the numerous reviews it had! I figured if there were over 1000 plus reviews for just a DVD this had to be something---BOY WAS IT EVER!! Our daughter literally watched this DVD for two weeks--I would say at least 3-4 times per week! SHE NOW KNOWS EVERY LETTER AND EVERY SOUND THAT THEY MAKE!! IT IS TRULY A BLESSING HOW FAST SHE LEARNED THEM..We have read and worked with her so much, I felt she knew alot for her age! We felt that it would be a different story learning the alphabet!! WE WERE WRONG!! Just the other day she came up to me and started naming every letter that was on a t-shirt that I had on..It was the most adorable thing ever! What a big girl...We are so proud of her! ALSO, WITH WORKING WITH HER OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS--SHE CAN DRAW THE LETTERS H-L-O.... Yaaaaa! So needless to say we have bought the talking words factory, and fixing to purchase the numbers ahoy after reading reviews on it!! JUST FOUND THE COMBO PACK WITH MEET THE NUMBERS, LETTERS, COLORS, SHAPES, AND SIGHT WORDS 1-2-3...I JUST KNOW IT WILL BE WONDERFUL AS WELL!!!

He LOVES this DVD and requests it every day.  We've had the movie less than two weeks and he's picked up so much, constantly mimicking the sounds he his hearing in everyday speech, and he's so interested in writing and putting letters together now.  I was highly skeptical of all the rave reviews I read about this DVD, but they're true!!!!

My only, and very small, issue is that the movie gives only one sound for each letter, although quite a few letters make two sounds - c, a, e, i, o, u, etc.  The vowels aren't such a big deal, though, since the name of the vowel is its long sound.  We had a little trouble with ""c,"" and remembering that it can sound like an ""s.""  It's really not a huge problem, but is worth mentioning.

I would definitely recommend this movie.  It's a great tie-in to the LeapFrog fridge magnet alphabet set, too (which does mention both sounds for those certain letters).",1330819200,,1040,4.48404255319149

It's so superbly done and is just the perfect length for the attention spans of pre-schoolers. The kids beg to watch it, and are truly learning!

The other thing I love about this is that it is reinforced with other Leap Frog products. The song used to teach the letters and sounds are also used in the refrigerator magnet toy. The continuity is great! As a teacher, I am always on the look out for quality, educational products, and Leap Frog is always excellent.

We've now progressed to the Talking Word Factory DVD and my 3 year old enjoys it just as much. She calls out the letters and sounds out the words along with Tad.

One of the annoying things is the kids pick up the letter sounds exactly how they say them and when the W comes up it says the sound about 3 times in a row, now my kids will say the W sound multiple times because they think that is how it pronounced.",1326326400,,551,3.9107142857142856
1940426,3,B0000EYV7E,"This video teaches letter recognition and basic letter-sound encoding through the use of mnemonic devices wrapped in a frame story.  In the frame story, frog children explore rooms in a letter factory, where animated versions of each letter are congregated, doing something to reinforce the primary sound for that letter.  For example, the Zs are sleeping, going ""Zzzzzz"".  In each room a short ditty also increases stimulation of the child and is intended to aid recall.

I will say that my two-year-old son, after watching it once, demanded to watch it again, and was enthralled.  He also started vocalizing some of the sounds, which for a youngster with a mild expressive language delay is nice to see.  Hence I have to rate it highly in terms of appealing to children on a basic level.

However, there is one subpar aspect to this video: it only teaches upper-case letters.  Since it is far better to learn the lower-case letters, this is a mistake on the part of the designers, mirrored in other products such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LeapFrog-Fridge-Phonics-Magnetic-Alphabet-Set/dp/B000096QNK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LeapFrog Fridge Phonics Magnetic Alphabet Set</a>, which only comes with a set of upper-case letters, forcing one to buy the lower-case letters as an add-on set.  There is a brief mention, several seconds long, of the existence of the lower-case letters, and the letter B is briefly shown then in lower case, but aside from that, it's all upper case.

(All leading pre-reading programs today primarily stress recognition of the lower-case letters, and secondarily the upper case letters, for a number of reasons.  Since lower-case b-d and p-q reversals are common in early writing, getting practice in differentiating them early can help greatly.  In addition, the vast majority of text a young child will learn to read is in lower case.)

All in all we found this video charming, memorable and well-constructed, with the glaring flaw of a nearly exclusive focus on the upper-case alphabet.  If it is used, it must be accompanied by plenty of other material which stresses the lower-case alphabet; and the fact that the lower-case alphabet is not taught by this video represents a huge missed chance.",1326240000,5,2284,5.343575418994414

The show is fun and educational and in no way boring, its only half an hour so its great for little ones with small attention spans. I wash completely surprised, my 3 yr old started picking up the alphabet after watching this a few times, here in a week or two he will be an alphabet expert. I recommend this to every parent with small children!!!!",1319673600,,479,4.1063829787234045

1940464,5,B0000EYV7E,"I am a professional educator and a mother.  This and all the other Leap Frog DVD's are the best by far.  I have seen and evaluated many other learning DVD's from the perspectives of both a teacher and a mother, and Leap Frog is the best by far.  This DVD does a perfect job of teaching letter sounds in an engaging way.  It's hard to find a DVD that kids will want to watch repeatedly.  Repetition is the key to early reading success, so if the show is not engaging enough to watch over and over, then the content is irrelevant.  My daughter is two-years-old and is already beginning to read short words largely due to these DVD's. Of course nothing can replace parental interaction, but if you use these DVD's as a common ground between you and your child, you can't go wrong.  Watching these WITH your child while interacting, then following-through and reinforcing the concepts afterwords is really the only early reading program a typical child would need. You might first want to begin with the letter amusement park DVD, which helps with basic letter identification, then move on to this one which is the best for learning letter sounds once the letters become identifiable.  Then move on to the word factory and so forth.  The math DVD's by Leap Frog are also excellent.  It's worth the investment.  I hope this helps!  :)",1319068800,,1329,4.608510638297872
1940465,3,B0000EYV7E,"I was disappointed with the LeapFrog Letter Factory.  I bought this for my 6 months old son, because I read another review similar to my specifics. Although it initially got the attention of my son, it took only a few plays for him to get totally bored. Plus, the manner of teaching the letters are confusing and 'crowdy'  to a baby younger than 18 months; and thus NOT recommended for a baby this age.  I also did not like the incorrect pluralization of the word ""Fish""...as ""Fishes"". Yes, this may sound like a picky point, but  I have known children to develop this incorrect pluralization of the word and its hard to get them to understand the difference.",1318377600,,659,4.559322033898305
1940466,5,B0000EYV7E,"My son had no interest in learning his letters and sounds. Now that he is in kindegarten I knew I needed to really encourage him and work hard on getting him up to speed. This video was like magic. I popped it in the car DVD player and he is watching it nonstop and then talking about letters and sounds all day long. Within 1 weeks time he is all caught up and it could not have been easier for us. Before we purchased this video we spent many hours trying to work on his letters and sounds and always ended up frustrated or in tears.
  WARNING: you WILL find yourself singing the catchy tunes. Even my 9 and 11 year olds are humming the songs.

Video first:  We saw part of this on-line and in typical toddler fashion, our two littles (3 & 1/2 and 1 & 1/2) were instantly mesmerized by the video.  After watching it one time we knew we had to purchase it:  both babies were singing the song along with the video.

Pro:  easy for toddlers to hear and understand,
  children want to sing along and the constant repetition makes ""learning"" unconscious
  Not expensive
  Great amazon.com customer service (see below)
  Not too long of a video (we don't let the tinies become video zombies for hours on end)

Cons:  The song gets in everyone's head and you find yourself singing the tune and making up words

AMAZON's Customer SVC:  We ordered this on September 15th with Prime 2 day shipping.  Tracking via UPS showed the dvd in Georgia on September 17th with delivery scheduled for the 18th.  Days and days later, the tracking still showed the same UPS transfer point in Georgia.  By the 23rd we'd given up hope and called UPS, who told us the shipper had to request an investigation / claim for a lost package.  But the UPS customer service people also get two thumbs up for emailing us an official statement detailing the above situation.  We emailed that to Amazon, and on the 24th (the next day) Amazon.com shipped us another DVD, no charge.  It arrived on the 26th.

(End of story note:  On September 30th the original shipment showed up!  Somehow it was sent from the Georgia transfer point to California.  Once in CA, they shipped it back to GA.  We called Amazon.com to see what to do since we received both copies [eventually]. We have a friend with small children as well who asked if she could buy a copy from us.  In the end we're paying for both copies and selling one to our friend.  BUT we're still so happy with Amazon's Customer Service for the prompt shipping of a replacement.

I saw a sample of leap frog on another website and I knew I had to purchase it. Leap Frog is a wonderful adventure that kept my daughter's interest throughout the entire video.

Now that my son is 3 and my old copy is very scratched from so much play I thought that he could use it to help learn his letters and sounds. The songs are catchy and help kids memorize what each letter says along with teaching them what each letter looks like.

He knew majority of them by sight and some of their sounds. I just couldn't keep his interest no matter what tactics I used. Magnets,books,Alphie,nothing seemed to truly click. I decided to give this video a try. Best decision I have made in the past month. Within 3 days,he knew all his letters. I suspect he knew them all before but was just being a little difficult. But now,he was excited about them,something I couldn't accomplish. Within a week he knew all the sounds. He now quizzes us to see if we know everything he does. Like I said he is really excited about his letters. He also surprised us by perfectly drawing(as perfectly as a 3 yr old can) several letters on his dry erase board on his own.

This video provides visual and situational cues with each letter, allowing my daughter to make associations in order to remember the letters and their sounds.  She requested this video all the time when she first got it and knew every letter and its sound within 2 weeks.  We've had it a few months now and it's still a favorite of hers.

The other day I was amazed that he can pretty much recite the whole video by word. He can't really pronounce some things clearly but but it was obvious that he could remember it all.

1940513,5,B0000EYV7E,"I bought this for my almost-3 year old son recently on the recommendation of a friend. My son immediately took to this video, which he fondly calls ""The frogs"". It's about 30 minutes so not too long. Within a couple of days, I could ask him ""What sound does a P make?"" and he'll say ""Puh"". ""What does the F say?"" and he'll reply ""ffff"" with his arms flapping. Something about the presentation/repetition of the sounds really makes it stick in that 2 year old brain! I'd say 2 1/2 is probably the earlist a child would be ready or interested in it. My 1 1/2 year old wanders off when it's playing - not quite ready.

I'd highly recommend this to any child aged 2 1/2+. I can't vouch for long how they stay interested since we're still watching it regularly. It will go on my Christmas gift-giving list for any children around this age, that's for sure!",1313971200,,851,4.352201257861635

1940519,5,B0000EYV7E,"I am a Full time K/1 teacher and think that any exposure that little ones have (in a fun way) to letters, sounds and reading is IMPERATIVE to their school success. I am not talking drill and kill, I simply mean that just like we talk to our kids about anything in this world, it is also important to talk to your kids about letters, sounds and words. That said, I have never recommended videos for children in my class to improve their letters/word knowledge. My own children (2 years old) have an expressive speech delay, so in my mind it is even MORE important to expose my children early to letters/sounds in a fun way. On the recommendation of our speech therapist we bought this same video and my boys LOVE it. Not only do they love it, but I learned a new song that we sing when we are out and about learning about letters and sounds in the real environment. My barely (July) 2 year old boys know the majority of letters/sounds by name and we are rapidly learning the letters/sounds by sight.
I HIGHLY recommend this video to all and especially for parents to watch WITH their children and learn the REAL sounds letters make. Then take this knowledge/sounds from the song to continue the teaching throughout the day!!
Maybe all children seem to level out by 3rd grade, but what parent would want their child to be the ""low"" kid in the K-2 class??!!  In my classroom the children who come in September knowing few letters struggle ALL YEAR long to catch up to their peers. As parents we are our childrens' first and most important teachers and everything we can do to expose our children to all academics is so very important!!  Ok, that is MY soap box!

He would tell me when to restart it.  Now I'm working on getting him to pronounce 3 letter words.  He's 4 now and is really trying.  I can't believe how amazing this is.  A coworker recommended this.  She said the private school her son is in was using it for all their kids.  A CD was given to each parent.

My son's were 1.5 and 3 years old when I got it for them. My 3 year old already knew the alphabet, so it was mostly a refresher for him. My 1.5 year old son really picked up on the alphabet from this dvd. I didn't have to do anything else. He naturally learned it on his own.

If your child is between 1.5 and 3 years old, this is about as close to perfect as you get.

I also got&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/123-Count-with-Me-Learning-About-Letters/dp/B000YDKA1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">123 Count with Me/Learning About Letters</a>&nbsp;but both sons hated it and wouldn't watch it at all.

It's hard to go wrong with leapfrog dvd's.

They're the best on the market and cheap too. Leapfrog Letter Factory should be mandatory for all kids and it'll make the parents lives a lot easier too. Definitely get the Sight Words set after your child learns the alphabet from Letter Factor.

As your child moves on to learning how to read, you'll want to avoid Whole Word type programs where kids simply memorize words. Programs such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Your-Baby-Can-Read-Early-Language-Development-System/dp/B000EGD4US/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Your Baby Can Read: Early Language Development System</a>&nbsp;may make you feel proud of your baby or child for picking out words he or she sees, but it's not making them a better reader and research seems to suggest it will hurt their reading progress.

Now I should say, the Meet the Sight Words set is whole words learning, but that's an exception because some words just don't make sense with phonics so you'll need some sort of whole word program for those tricky words. But you don't want to rely totally on whole word as a reading program.

So start with Letter Factory and then move on to phonics.",1309651200,,2630,6.029490616621984

THIS DVD IS THE FIRST DVD OF THE ORIGNAL LEAPFROG SERIES- produced to help children gain reading skills starting out with the ABC's and learning their sounds.  THE VIDEO IS VERY ENGAGING AND CHILDREN LOVE THE ENERGY OF IT'S PRESENTATION!

My granddaughter started watching this as soon as she showed interest in TV.  Her Mom let her watch a DVD of this series until she was so solid in the material presented and she was thouroughly grounded in all the information that series had to offer before she went to the Next DVD.

BY THE AGE OF 2, SHE WAS READING!  The FIRST LEAPFROG SERIES IS THE BEST- START WITH THAT ONE, IT HAS MORE INFORMATION PRESENTED.  THE 2ND SERIES IS GOOD TO START AFTER YOU CHILD IS COMPLETELY SOLID IN THE FIRST SERIES.  THE NEWER-2ND SERIES IS GOOD FOR A REVIEW, IT HAS SOME OTHER INFORMATION AND STORY BUT IT IS NOT AS GROUNDING IN READING SKILLS AS THE FIRST SERIES!  AMAZON CARRIES BOTH LEAPFORG DVD SERIES.

NETFLICKS HAS THESE 2 SERIES BUT THEY DO NOT HAVE THIS ONE DVD, THE FIRST DVD OF THE FIRST SERIES-WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DVD TO START OUT WITH - THIS ONE HERE: LEAPFROG LETTER FACTORY!

I BUY THIS SERIES FOR EVERY CHILD I KNOW! at Walmart for $9 dollars (NO LONGER AVAILBLE AT WALMART)- So I HUNTED DOWN THIS FIRST DVD AND FOUND IT FOR LESS AT AMAZON!.  I DID NOT FIND THE 2ND SERIES AT WALMART EITHER THE LAST TIME I PURCHASED A GIFT.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FIRST SERIES.  ONE CHILD I GAVE IT TO WAS FLOUNDERING IN SCHOOL, SHE WAS LOSING HER SELF CONFIDENCE, IT TURNS OUT SHE NEEDED GLASSES TO EVEN SEE THE BOARD.  SHE WAS SO FAR BEHIND, WITH THIS SERIES SHE WAS ABLE TO CATCH UP QUICKLY AND EASILY, HER CONFIDENCE RETURNED IMMEDIATELLY.

THIS IS A MUST AND MAKES A WONDERFUL GIFT FOR CHILDREN THAT KEEPS ON GIVING....FROM HERE YOU CAN VIEW THE REST OF THE FIRST SERIES OF LETTER FACTORY ON NETFLICKS AND SERIES #2 IS THERE TOO.  WONDERFUL INVESTMENT, GREAT FOR MOM AND YOUR KIDS!",1305763200,,2153,4.418781725888325

1940547,5,B0000EYV7E,"I got this in a buying frenzy for my 1 yr old in the Philippines...(still had money left after all the baby einstein vidoes LOL)She has an older sister (3yrs)who is very bright, but has not had the benefit of english language upbring. I expect this to balance out later, as she will be bilingual, but I really worried about the selection of english language learning materials for preschoolers that i would find when I went, so I loaded up and hand carried 400 pounds of of phonics materials, videos and workbooks. This was by far the best of the bunch.

My 1 yr old is still a bit young for it, but she dances to the songs, and the 3 yr old absolutely loves it. It has even helped her mother and aunts refine thier accents. The baby einstein stuff is pretty slow paced for a 3 yr old, but I expect to get some extra legs out of them since she is really just getting her first exposure to english with them. They are good for the baby, and good to bore the 3yr old away from the TV for awhile(she wants to watch the letter factory 24 hours a day). Although it kills any dreams of limitting TV time, these videos are extra important, becuase I want her to get a solid grounding in english, and especially proper American Standard dialact...something just not available, even in the english speaking prescool I just enrolled her in, since everyone speaks english with an accent - which is to be expected.

On a side note, I was pretty ticked off at Disney..although the baby einstein materials are obviously good quality, I do feel like I paid 300 bucks for a total of about 45 minutes of sock puppets and video of toys that I could have bought for less than the cost of the videos. But worst of all, among the ABC stuff that was available in PI...much of it was by Disney Corp...and they had the audacity to use ""Disney"" for the letter D on an ABC poster...what a shameless stab at cultivating brand loyalty. Not Dog, Duck, Dinner...but Disney. Disgusting. AT any rate, the kids love the video and I got the rest of the set on the way.",1304294400,,2034,4.335958005249344

It Is the first thing he wants to do when he wakes up, he walks up to me with the DVD in his hand. We sing and dance to the songs, as my 18month old claps along. Contrary to what a reviewer stated, Lower case and Upper case letters are included in this DVD. It's a great DVD and I recommend for Birthday gifts. I love Leapfrog products. They make learning fun not only for the children but for the parents as well. Well put together DVD, I will be getting the whole Learning DVD series soon!!",1304121600,,606,4.1440677966101696

We've had it for almost a month and with watching it twice a week and pointing out letters during the day she knows almost half of her alphabet.  She loves to go through and sing the sounds of the letters also.  It keeps her very entertained in the car.  I love that it is only about 30 minutes also.  It gives me just enough time to get some cleaning done without feeling bad about having her watch TV too long.",1302825600,,565,4.081818181818182

The only thing that surprised me is that there is no singing of the ""ABC's"" song. My son has had the song memorized forever, but to put the letter with the visual of the song would have been nice to see. Either way, he loves it, and it's helping him learn!",1302739200,,394,4.12987012987013

1940573,5,B0000EYV7E,"My son who is 3.7 years old likes this movie. His favorites are the letters ""P"" and ""W"".
We are in Brazil and he is in a bilingual school learning English; so this is a great video to introduce him to a more natural and Montessorian way of learning how to read. Using the sound of the letter rather than using the name of the letter.
I follow up the video playing a game of chosing words that start with a few letters of the movie, I let him chose the letters.
He really likes it.
I will now make at home some sandletters so that I can get him really used to the letters.
we have also another video from the serie and he likes it as well. Thumbs up for Leapfrog!",1302307200,,662,3.9849624060150375

My three year old is beginning to spell, write, and read simple words!  Plus they are both recognizing numbers, understanding how to sort, they can identify patterns and shapes, plus learning how to add & subtract with 1's and 2's.  We've had this maybe 1 month. These are their favorite shows and watch them all the time. They hradly want to watch anything else. We bought another program (your baby can read) but both girls lost interest very quickly. These videos keep their full attention and they are honestly learning in the process. I would highly highly recommend these videos!

1940580,5,B0000EYV7E,"I was looking for a DVD that would teach letter sounds. And when reading the reader rabbit reviews I bumped into one review that mentioned this one. I then happened to see the RR one too. I am so glad we got this. The story is great, it is not boring. The amount of time they spend talking about each letter is just right for a kid not to loose interest. My son (wich was just turned 5 when we got it) just loved this and better than all he mastered his letter sounds in no time! Even my 21 mos old loves this. She asks to watch the frog all the time and she recognizes some letters and some sounds thanks to this. She saw letter F the other day and said the name F with a blow. It is amazing. After thsi my son asked to get the talking words factory. We got it too and it was excelent help for him to learn word families. I posted a comment on that. I recommend this DVD. It made phonics and reading so much easier to my son. We are now getting the word capers with is the third in the sequence to help our son in more complexes sounds as SH, CH and to understand some rules such as a vowel silencing another etc. So far we have loved this series and would buy again.

The principal walked him back from his evaluation and said she was amazed that, not only did he know his letters, but he knew all of their sounds as well.  My husband and I were shocked!

Although my daughter is only two, I've always put a lot of emphasis on her education. I bought the ""My Baby Can Read system"" and this DVD, by far, outweighs all the benefits of my baby can read. Why? Because it's almost effortless. All you have to do is put the DVD on and they're hooked. My two yo knows her ABC's from A-Z and, I learned today, that she can IDENTIFY the letters when asked, on a chart. I was amazed; I didn't even know she could do that!

1940597,5,B0000EYV7E,"Well I purchased this video for my three year old daughter.  It was highly recommended by my older daughters Kindergarten teacher.  She said that every child that had watched this video in the preschool years went into Kindergarten knowing all of their letter sounds.

When the video arrived I was skeptical that she would even be able to make it though its entirety.  It was annoying at best...for me anyway.  Repeating the same tune over and over again, inserting the different letters and their sounds.  Well she loved it!!  We watched it everyday before nap time for a few months.

Quality wise I think that the makers of the film should have used lower case letters instead of uppercase because it is crucial for a child to recognize these first if you want them reading early.  Better animation would have been nice.  What do you want for under $10 right?  But let me tell you this much...after a few months she knows ALL of her letter sounds.  I have made my own flash cards for her using lowercase letters and we no longer watch the video.  Instead we sing the song using my letters.  The best part....my two year old son knows most of the letter sounds as well.  He is barely talking, but if you show him a letter card he will make its sound.

I highly recommended this to everyone parenting a toddler!  Also buy their Math Adventure to the Moon if you want them skip counting early.  X2-20, X5-50, X10-100.",1299542400,,1416,4.529644268774703

The first time I played it my 22 month old kind of watched, but lost interest half way through. I was really disappointed, but then about 3 days later she went and got the video herself and wanted to watch it. She loved it, sang along and now only 3 weeks later can identify in books or out in public at least a dozen letters and say their sounds correctly. It is amazing! It makes sense, because they show the letters and repeat the sounds over and over, so it sinks in and it is fun to watch. I would recommend it to any one.

It is a nightly request before bedtime and never tends to get annoying to my wife and I (like a certain purple dinosaur most likely would.)
It is a good length and keeps her attention the whole time. We have watched her progress educationally with this dvd over time. It was an extreme help with first vocalizing the sound of the letters and then recognizing and saying the names of the letters.

1940631,5,B0000EYV7E,"My daughter somehow got through preschool with out learning all her letters and almost no letter sounds.  She had little to no interest in learning these concepts.  She hated being read abc books and loathed the ""Word World"" cartoon.  During her first month of kindergarten my sister gave me the ""Letter Factory"" dvd and, to my pleasant surprise, my daughter watched the entire thing!  The next morning she asked to watch it again. When it was over she asked to replay it.  She asked to watch the ""Letter Factory"" video at least twice a day for the rest of the week. And then she was done.  She knew ALL the letters and ALL the sounds. She didn't want to (or need to) watch the dvd again.

I am a credentialed teacher and tried many times over the years to help with her pre-reading skills, but her intense lack of interest (and out right refusal!) quickly ended all my attempts.

At first I wasn't sure if I liked the idea of the vowels only being presented as the short sounds, but I think that makes the most sense.  Kids will easily remember that the letter can make it's own sound, but the short sound is harder so it's wonderful that he's learning it. After watching this for a couple weeks my son is starting to sound out words when we read books and figures out ""mom"" or ""on"" pretty well.  Love this movie!!",1294099200,,547,4.180952380952381

It did not take him long to learn the sounds of the letters and he loved watching this video!  I recommend this video to anyone trying to teach the alphabet, or the sounds of them.  I passed our video along to a family whose oldest was in Pre-K learning the alphabet, and there were two younger siblings at home.

1940660,4,B0000EYV7E,"This is a very good product. It teaches the alphabet  and the letter sounds in an engaging way, through songs and animation. My toddler just loves it, and showing her the DVD is about the only way to get her seated in the car seat quietly.

I give this only 4 stars because of some slight flaws:

- the sounds of the vowels are not consistent because the characters in the dvd sound them differently
  e.g it's difficult to make out the difference between 'A', 'E', 'U'; 'O' sounds like 'ohhh' and 'ahhh'

- the dvd doesn't differentiate between long and short vowels

- there is an emphasis on uppercase letters; lettercase letters are important for emergent reading cos they occur more frequently in the written language.

My toddler has learnt letters that have similar looking upper and lowercase letters. However, she has trouble recognising the rest of the alphabet. My friend's toddler, however, has learnt both upper and lower case letters from this dvd.",1287705600,,962,4.787878787878788

He hadn't really been interested before in learning them, but this DVD really did it for him.  He loves it!  Bonus: the 18 month old, who only catches a little of the DVD once in a while (he doesn't get very much TV), knows some of his letter sounds too!  Really cute DVD for a good price.

1940665,5,B0000EYV7E,"My 26 month old son loves watching this, and it really does what it's meant to do.  I bought Melissa and Doug magnetic fridge letters at the same time, and he almost immediately began naming letters using the sounds he learned in the video.  Every week there are a couple more letters he recognizes.  He points to the A and says AAAAH!  He takes the J out of his name puzzle and says 'jump, jump!' and makes it jump around.  When he sees and S, he hisses like a snake.  And every time he sees a circle, he says ""o!""  It really works!  Not that I think a 2 year old needs to be pushed in any way, but my older children were early readers, and I figured I'd try it and see if he was interested.  Kids are always eager for new ways to make sense of their world, and what better gift to give them than the keys to reading?  This video is a fun, well-crafted way to introduce these foundational concepts.  I'm looking forward to using the word factory video in a year or so.  And I wish Leap Frog could work this same magic for potty training, but that's a different story :)

As far as the criticism about only upper case letters-- it's true, but you do have to start somewhere, and phonics newbies need to first grasp the letter-sound correspondence before the next steps are relevant.  The video does briefly touch on the idea that there are small letters that have the same sound.  And in my past experience, small letters are so much part of the child's environment that once they are engaged with their own emerging phonics skills and asking a million questions about the books and other print they see, this problem sorts itself out organically.

Highly recommended for any pre-reading child, two and up.",1287014400,,1706,4.385350318471337

The DVD is engaging and entertaining, with visually appealing animation and a catchy song. It has my daughter very enthusiastic about letters; she has even started identifying the beginning letter to some words! My only concern is that in contrast to other LeapFrog products, this video doesn't emphasize that some letters make more than one sound. I wouldn't let that deter you, however.

We took it with us on a four hour car ride and he must have watched it at least 3 times. He watched it just as many times on the way back.

One of my friends recommended I try ""Letter Factory"" as an educational video for my son when he is ready to start learning his alphabet (my son in currently 18 mos.) I've only watched the show once with my son, just to see how it was, and actually enjoyed it. I had previously watched other shows geared toward young children and found that they tended to focus on entertaining the young ones and alienating any adult audience. Even though these shows are for my son, I do want to be able to sit and watch it with him rather than just putting him in front of the TV, and this show seems to meet my desires. The light humor makes ""Letter Factory"" watchable by all ages, and while the repetition of the songs get a little tiring after a  while for me, the repetition of the letters and their sounds is what other parents have said helps their children learn the alphabet.",1282608000,,1014,4.446236559139785

1940687,5,B0000EYV7E,"I want to add my comments to the chorus of other parents who love this DVD.
I purchased this for my 16 month old daughter for Christmas.
When we went to watch it I was initially disappointed.  It is poorly animated, and has a pretty lame story line.  The characters are predictable and the plot doesn't even make sense at points.
But my daughter loved it.

I know a 16 month old should not be watching television.  But we let her watch this almost every day to wind down before nap time.
In about two weeks, our 17 month old new her alphabet.
She could say her alphabet, she could tell you what letters made what sounds.

When we would show friends and family how great she was at her alphabet they were shocked, and filled us with compliments about what awesome parents we must be.  Truth be told, be gave all the credit to the movie.
It has a lot of repetition, songs and silliness that appeal to toddlers and work towards a learning goal.

Now my daughter is three.  She can read small words and is constantly pointing out letters and their sounds, spelling words just for fun, and writing short words, etc.  I think her advanced reading and writing skills at this age are a direct result of her coming to love letters so early.

I am actually online looking at this product to order a new one for our 17 month old son.  Our fist copy broke and I want him to have the same love for letters.

I recommend this book to everyone who wants their children to learn letters and sounds.",1281398400,,1482,4.310469314079422

1940690,5,B0000EYV7E,"I tried countless ways to help my son learn his letters and letter sounds, spending more money than I care to admit.  Leapfrog's Letter Factory DVD was the first and only method that worked!  He watched it over and over.  Within a week or two, the transition was amazing.  I cannot say enough good things about this product.  My son needed something that would entertain, educate and hold his attention.  The Letter Factory did the trick!",1281225600,,438,4.697368421052632

He'd often get them wrong, and wouldn't have too much patience to keep trying. Since I bought this DVD, he's learned all letters (both by name and by phonetic), and takes every chance he gets to practice writing them. He repeatedly sings the theme song, and loves reading letters we find in everyday life.

We moved on up to the Talking Words Factory video, and she is getting the letter combinations and blends after only a few days as well.  She BEGS to watch ""Tad and Letters"".  I'm very impressed with these videos.  They seem to be just the right length to hold her attention, and aren't overly annoying to listen to.

After viewing it only a few times she knew the names and sounds of all the letters in the alphabet.  We would say ""What does the ""A"" say"" and she would say ""Ahh"" like the way the video would say it.  We feel like her language skills have grown just by watching this video.  She is able to sound out letters even in her books.  The video uses repetition in its songs and pronunciation of its letters (they even repeat in the talking words factory) and that is great for toddler learning.  The only other video she won't turn off is Sesame Street Count with Me but even then she doesn't really pay attention like she does with the Leapfrog Letter Factory and Talking Words Factory.

1940698,5,B0000EYV7E,"I bought this when my daughter is close to 2 year old. She loves the character especially TAD that it makes her want to do what Tad is doing. Before showing this video, she have an alphabet rubber mat and we were showing her flash cards or letters with animal pictures. She quickly learned the animal sounds but not the letters. When we showed this video to her, she quickly learned the letter sounds in less than a week then she started to recognize all the letters in the alphabet. In two weeks time she only gets confused with E and F and also with l and I but soon realized the difference.

We let her play with her 4 year old and 5 year old cousin during one of our family gathering, the game is to go on top of the letter on her rubber mat. My then 2 1/2 year old was able to compete with her cousins sometimes getting to the letter before any of her older cousins does.

She also learned how put the letter together using the next video ""Talking Words Factory"". At 3 years old she can now read 3 letter word by putting all the letter sound together but the only thing is that the video only put emphasis on Capital Letters. Her mat is also capital letters and I also write in all CAPS. So she can read the word BAT but not the word bat or Bat. We will now need to show her the lower case equivalent. This will be great if Leap Frog will make this adjustment or make another video with lower case for the next generation of children who will be watching these videos.",1278892800,,1473,4.128919860627177

He is 2 1/2 now and still enjoys the viedo, he can identify all the letters of the alphabet and tell you what sound they make. We have now moved on to the ""Talking Words Factory"" so he can start learning how to put the letters together. He still enjoys this video as well.

1940700,5,B0000EYV7E,"I read an article last week that stated not to start teaching your children the alphabet until after 2 years old and that the alphabet is usually not mastered until age 4 or 5.  They also said don't use flash cards...

Well I completely disagree with that article because my son started watching Letter Factory at 16-17 months old.  We go weeks in between viewings sometimes and by 22 months old he knew all of his letters and their sounds.  He is turning 2 in a week and he LOVES playing with the Leap Frog Flash Cards that came in the box set I bought.

I know many people have addressed the fact that the video doesn't focus on lower case letters and I do wish there was a little more focus on them.  However, I'm finding it very easy to teach my son the lower case letters on my own, since he knows the upper case letters.

I recommend this video to every mom I come across.  It is definitely a stepping stool in learning!",1278806400,,926,4.221590909090909

My son begs to watch it so I let him watch it once a day.  After a couple of weeks, he was able to repeat the sounds of every letter in the alphabet.

1940706,5,B0000EYV7E,"I bought this for my three year old and my two year old.  After watching it a handful of times, they know almost every letter and can even recognize the non cartoon ones on flashcards or in books.  They can even be asked, ""what does the H say?"" or ""what letter says haa?""

Warning to parents, it is an annoying cartoon as it repeats the same song for every letter...but without that repetition, I don't think it would be nearly as effective so I just turn it on and ignore the movie for a short time if it is too bothersome to me.

Some others reviewed the movie and said how disturbed they were with the incorrect sounds like the L saying ""ull"".  I thought it sounded weird at first too but if you think about it, it is correct but it's just a little less obvious in real speech.  I think as your child learns to read, the awkwardness will drop away.

I only wish that they lowercase letters were also introduced in this video.  They are seen in a few places in the background but are not very prominent.  I know it's a method of teaching that allows for teaching the lowercase later, but I wish they were at least a little more obvious in the video if not totally taught too.  (Maybe Leapfrog needs to make a ""lower case letter factory"" movie.  LOL ;) )

It is deffinately a good buy.  I bought 5 more of them and we've watched them but are not quite ready to form words and stuff yet, but I'm so excited about these videos!

Also, my newly turned 1 baby is watching this video and is mimicking the sounds that the letters make.  He's had a slow vocabulary so far but introducing new sounds and tongue movements, has really helped him too.

I'm very, very impressed with this video and would recommend it for anyone.  Just buy a set of ear plugs if you are easily annoyed by too much repetition.  :)",1277683200,,1801,4.247058823529412

She watched intently, then one day as we were out and about - she pointed to a sign and said that's the letter ""H"".  And she was right.  She then proceeded to tell me the sound the letter ""H"" makes.  Originally, I thought she knew about 4 or 5 of her letters.  Turns out - she knows all but 4 or 5 of her letters, and the sound each makes.  She will point out letters on the computer keyboard by name.

But we were being typical parents of the first born and decided to try it out. My daughter could identify every letter and its sounds within a week of watching the video once a day! She turned two in February and it is amazing to see how she is using the alphabet! When we go on walks or we are in the car- she will yell out letters as she sees them on signs or buildings.  It has been so much fun seeing her learn her letters. I highly recommend the DVD. It is a wonderful tool to engage your young child!  The only item of issue is that it does emphasize uppercase vs. lowecase and I see her struggling to identify lower case letter that are vastly different from their uppercase partner.

This is the first review I have ever written. Personally, I am so happy; and I had to show some gratitude. My daughter is 27 months old and stays at home. I purchased this DVD set while on vacation in San Diego one month ago  at Best Buy. I had gotten her 'Your Baby Can Read' and thought it lacked the fundamentals of reading- sounding out the letters of the alphabet- she really enjoys 'Baby Can Read' though. After just 1 month, my daughter recognizes and can sound out all the letters in the alphabet! I am so happy right now; this is unbelievable! I totally recommend this product, 100 per cent.

I bought a few different DVD's with letters (sesame street) and this one. This one is amazing. The content is organized and entertaining. The letters are on the screen for a long enough time without flashing away like some other videos. Even though each letter segment is different enough to be entertaining, they are consistent enough that she can recognize all the letters along with their sounds after watching about 15 times. She can watch the video over and over and sings along with it now.

I attribute part of that to the leap frog dvds because they enjoyed them and were given such a positive impression of reading through them, as well as our family's love of books in general.

I figured at the very least it helps bring in several modalities to learning; visual, auditory, musical, kinesthetic (these students usually end up doing the motions the letters do in the video).

I've been home on maternity leave for a few months and one day I decided to play it for my 3 year old son (just to get him to be quiet for a few minutes).  I personally haven't been teaching him any letters or sounds because I know he will pick them up in preschool next year and didn't want him to be bored. Not to mention teaching him something like the letters and sounds just didn't seem like much fun AT ALL as he is one of those hyper boys that doesn't like to pay attention to detail.  After watching this movie just once my son started telling me the letter names and sounds.  He's only watched it maybe 5 times but he can identify 19 of the 26 letters, with the sounds.  I know people think I'm pushing him, but I just keep telling them about this wonderful DVD.

Until he started watching this DVD, that is!  Within watching it just two or three times, there was a noticeable improvement with his speech.  After three weeks of having it, with him watching it maybe five times a week, he can say every letter clearly and correctly.  This DVD has made a world of difference!

My only complaint is that they don't teach the different sounds some of the letters make.  For example, it teaches that the A says ""Ahhh"", but neglects the hard ""A"" sound.

I have corrected her on the L and R since they are not correct, but her interest is now high and she asks about letters all the time and when I ask her the sound they make, she tells me.  She is also making good transfer of her new learning.  If I ask her what letter does dog or wagon begin with and I slow down the first letter sound, she can tell the correct letter.

The video systematically goes through each letter, showing fun scenes within the letter factory. Each letter has its own room where they learn what sound it makes. The frog goes on a tour through the factory learning the sound of each letter with the letters. They sing a song ""The A says 'ah' the A says 'ah'; every letter letter makes a sound; the A says 'a'."" This song is repeated in each room, sung over while showing the letters. In addition to showing animated letters, each letter is shown written on a door, written on a blackboard, and usually written on other items. For each letter examples are given of words that start with that letter. After about 3 or 4 letters are introduced, they are reviewed.

She constantly sings the catchy song used in the DVD to teach the sound each letter makes. I only rated the DVD 4 stars, since I thought that the lower case letters should have been included as well. By the way, my 6 yr old asks to watch the DVD as well (even though she already reads above her grade level). So definitely two thumbs up.",1260403200,,635,4.3
1940783,4,B0000EYV7E,"I have been teaching for 18 years.  I bought this DVD for my son.  He watches it about 4 times a week.  He know knows about 6-8 letters and their sounds.  My son is 2.3 years old.
In my job I am frequently rquired to assess the cognitive development of young children.  Many of these children are 6, 7 and even 8 years old and do not have a firm grasp of their letters or their sounds.
This DVD will not take the place of working and playing with your child, but it acts as a very powerful supplement.
The DVD is consistent, it uses the same song for each letter.  The only drawback is that most of the lower case letters are not reviewed, only the uppercase.  However, if this is the only draw back to having your child ready to read by 3 years then it is well worth it.
I would recommend this DVD to parents of young children or even parents or teachers of children with learning difficulties.",1260316800,,895,4.1686046511627906

In the story, Tad visits all 26 letter rooms in the talking letter factory and learns what each letter looks like and what sound it makes.  Each letter and sound is presented in a creative way.  The video also has a catchy song for learning letter sounds.

The video helped teach my children the alphabet, and I've heard good things about it from friends, too.  Leap Frog does a good job of making fun, yet educational toys.",1258588800,,570,4.271028037383178

1940791,4,B0000EYV7E,"My son received this video as a gift when he was 9 months old.  He is now 18 months as still loves it.  For him, it is very engaging - he loves music and he seems to like the repetitive letter-sound song.  As he has gotten older, he tries more and more to imitate the sounds he hears when the characters enter each room.  He also calls out the names of things he sees in each room. Overall, I think this is a decent video for exposing young children to letters and sounds in isolation.

There are a few things about this video that ""irk"" me.  I have a strong background in linguistics and early reading and the video presents some sounds for letters that are not completely accurate.  Specifically, it is important when teaching the sounds of letters in isolation not to add vowels sounds to the consonant sounds.  For the letter L the video presents the sound as ULL with the U emphasized prior to the L sound.  This is very inaccurate - we don't say ULOLIPOP, etc.  Also, for the letter Q the sound is presented as QWA.  I find this very frustrating because Q makes a K sound, and it is only Q with U that makes the QWA sound.  I am fully aware of the common tradition in education to teach students the Q sound with the U attached.  Most of these people argue that students should be taught QU together because ""Q is always followed by U"".  This is not true.  While there are very few words that start with Q and are not followed by U - they do exist (QAT, etc.)!

Having said this, even with these few problems, I have yet to find a video that presents letter-sound associations in isolation that does it as well as this video.",1258156800,,1631,4.246753246753247

I thought it was more of an educational DVD that reviewed letter sounds. The letter sounds are introduced, but in the context of the plot of a cartoon show. Most cartoons annoy me, and this is one of them. There's a lot of extra stuff that I don't necessarily want my almost-two-year-old saying, ""Okie-Dokie-Artichokey"" being one of them. And it's annoying to sit through all of the beginning and end plot of the show surrounding the alphabet sounds. I'd recommend watching someone else's copy before buying one for yourself.

We also bought the Leap Frog alphabet fridge magnet set that uses the same catchy song...highly recommend that over this video to teach the sounds.

Edited, after having 3 more kids. I still think the extra stuff in the cartoon is annoying. I think the comments on my review are interesting. My kids are all smart, and I don't watch adult shows with them.

It starts out with a story, not thrusting learning and letters in their face. Which is awesome if you have a child who runs for the hills at the first hint of anything educational like I do. Now after a few times my 5 year old HAS gotten bored with it. But it's okay, because he has mastered the sounds already, and my two year old still watches it.

I have even overhead her on other occasions trying to sound out words she sees which is FABULOUS!! Although the video does not address that fact that some letters have more than one sound, it is a great start for children to understand the importance of letters and opens the door to reading. I purchased the reading system many people may have seen on TV but her response was far better with this video. And, it actually teaches her to read words rather than memorize them.

When I received this DVD and let my boy watch it for the first time  he really enjoyed the characters in the movie .Only a few days later he knew almost all his phonics. This DVD constructed very well as far as teaching new letters( phonics) and repeating them again after every 4 letters are introduced.

She always wanted to watch it and it really got her through that particular step a child takes before learning how to read. Now my son is that age (3) and he's having particular trouble with speech and letter sounds. I have high hopes that this DVD will be just the help he needs.

1940856,2,B0000EYV7E,"This DVD is not one of the better learning tools out there.  The audio and visuals are overstimulating and distracting from the message, the story line is contrived and hard for little ones to follow and the characters pronounce the letters incorrectly in many cases.

I can see that it might be entertaining for some kids, if they are used to fast pace animation and the unfortunate jump-cut editing pervasive in children's programming.  But my 2.5-year-old was bored with it and didn't want to watch it again.  He enjoys story-based programs (Curious George, Little Polar Bear, etc.) and lesson-based programs (Brainy Baby ABCs), so it's not a matter of his not being able to follow along.  I think it was just too much unnecessary noise and action.",1246060800,8,751,4.881889763779528
1940857,5,B0000EYV7E,"I was a first grade teacher before my son was born, so I have a pretty good handle on teaching letter sounds, etc. I'm all about having children learn from many different angles, so thought this video would be a great addition to our learning routine. Actually, we hadn't really done much with the alphabet when we got this (at around 20 months), so this was his first introduction to the alphabet other than singing the alphabet song and a few flash card sessions.

Much to my surprise, within a few times of viewing this video my son was able to say all his letter sounds. After around 2 months of off and on viewing, he can now say all of the letter sounds just by seeing the letter. What's more impressive is that he can do this out of order, and he is beginning to decode words using the sounds! This is something that many kindergartners are just learning.

Of course, I think my son is brilliant (lol! Doesn't every mom?) but I'm more than happy to announce that this video is extremely well done, and I don't think that my son would be as far along without it, despite my teaching background.

When you use this video (and the others in the series, which we will start in on shortly) in conjunction with flash cards, teachable moments around the home/outside the home, etc...your child will be well prepared for school.

I must say that this has  helped my son tremendously in learning his letters and the letter sounds.  The animated frog characters sing songs about each letter and demonstrate a way to remember the sound by associating it with a funny action and a catchy tune.  For instance, the ""A"" is easily frightened so he screams, ""Aaaaaa""  every time something scares him.  The ""B"" likes classical music and sings the tune of Beethoven's 5th symphony, ""ba-ba-ba-baaaa.""  The ""C"" is always, ""c-c-c-cold.""

It had been a while since he's watched so I pulled it out again (he's 3 now) and it was a completely different watching / learning experience for him.  He already knew his alphabet, but was very interested in learning the sounds that go with them.  This DVD did a great job of showing him that connections between the letters and their sounds.

They both recognized all their letters (usually upper and lower case) before seeing this video, so I have no idea whether it helps with that. But neither of them had made the connection between a letter and a sound -- they were learning how to recognize some words strictly by memorization -- and this video has made that concept click for them. Now they see a C and say ""The C says 'kuh'!""

Some reviewers complained that the letter sounds are ""incorrect."" I thought this too at first, but this is only true if you're focusing on the letter's NAME. For instance, we say L as ""el."" The video says ""ul."" But if you're trying to sound out the word ""left,"" does it start with ""el""? No, it start with ""ul."" Same for O -- we call it ""oh,"" but in many words starting with O, the sound is actually ""ah"": octopus, on, off, etc.

I also don't mind that it only teaches one sound for each letter. There is plenty of time for small children to learn the marvelous complexities of English. This video teaches a very beginning-level phonics, which is perfect for kids who more or less know what letters are and what they're for, but need to make the connection between letters and sounds.",1242259200,2,1250,4.430434782608696

We started about a year ago with it and don't really use it anymore because she knows her letters so well now, but she still says ""Wu Wu Wu Wu What's happening dude?"" EVERY time she sees a W!

1940895,5,B0000EYV7E,This DVD is amazing! My 3 year old has had a really hard time learning her letters and after going over and over them everyday with no progression at all I decided to give The Letter Factory a try. In less then 1 week my daughter is reciting almost ALL the letter sounds perfectly! She loves watching the video and asks to watch it everyday. My 5 year old who is reading very well even finds this to be interesting and amusing. Thank you Leap Frog!!! I will be buying the rest of this series!,1238025600,,492,4.189473684210526

1940898,5,B0000EYV7E,The title says it all.  My 3 year old son recognized his letters for months but could still not understand the concept of phonics no matter how hard I tried to teach them.  In desperation I bought this video on a recommendation and within 4 days he could sing the phonics to every letter in the alphabet and within a week I started introducing him to 3-letter words with success.  A video you don't have to feel bad about your child watching over and over!  Excellent!,1237248000,,468,4.406976744186046
1940899,5,B0000EYV7E,I absolutely loved this video.  My 3 yr old now recognizes almost all of her letters after having this video for about 3 wks.  My 2 yr old knows the sounds the letters make as well as letter recognition.  This video was recommended by a couple of friends whose children have watched it and learned the alphabet.  I highly recommend this video to all parents who want a fun way for their kids to learn the alphabet and the sounds for each letter.,1237248000,,445,4.325301204819277
1940900,5,B0000EYV7E,"This DVD eally works. Not only did my son love watching it, which surprised me as it wasn't anything that spectacular, but he also learned very quickly. This was one of the ones he wanted to watch over and over again. I never had to push him to watch it, he pushed me. Age 3 and half and he knew his phonetics. Amazing. I am still impressed now that he is four and knows the sound that every letter makes. His expensive pre-school couldn't even do this well. Now I am looking for something with letter combinations and words. He just watched Super Why on PBS and this seems like it might be next. I will also check out the other Letter Factory videos although we purcahsed another one or two and they didn't work nearly as well. Maybe we didn't get the right one. I will give them another chance.",1236988800,,796,4.2781456953642385

A fun must-have if you as our household!",1236643200,,333,4.138461538461539

1940905,3,B0000EYV7E,"My son 3 1/2 and my 21 month old son quickly began making all the letter sounds.  After just 3 times of watching the video, my son new 15 of the letters and their sounds.  He actually doesn't even sit and watch it, but plays and repeats the sounds as he plays.  He's often not even in view of the TV so I think he'd get even more if he saw the helpful graphics that go with it, but I'm not going to make him stare at the TV.

I am annoyed with a couple of things on this video.  The most important being that some of the letter sounds are completely incorrect, but I've been loudly singing them correctly over the video so he isn't learning it wrong.  For example the video says that R says 'er' instead of 'rrrr'.  Also that L says 'ul' which is completely wrong.  There are a few other incorrect ones as well.

My other annoyance is that only on letter B, J, and I do they ever address the lower case letter.  All the letters that are saying their sounds are capitals.  The lower case is shown for only a split second and not explained at all.  That's a huge error since kids are reading with lower cases much more often than seeing capitals.

Overall, it's been a good introduction.  It seems that of the videos out there this one is interesting to the kids and fun for them, but has some major mistakes.  The others I've seen are boring but teach more correctly.  Tough decision.",1235865600,16,1383,4.201520912547529

1940911,5,B0000EYV7E,"My 2 year old son received this video for Christmas and is completely obsessed with it. For his birthday, in November, he had gotten another phonics toy--the Zizzle Letters and Sound Talking Smart Stick--and it was way over his head. He didn't know any letter names or sounds, and couldn't play the games, so he lost interest in that toy pretty quickly. However, after watching this video daily for a week or two he could identify nearly all the letters and their sounds. He also now plays with his Zizzle phonics toy, which is now nearly too easy for him. I think the heart of what makes this video work so well is repetition (with the simple letter song) and visual reinforcement (the letters are depicted in ways that reinforce their sound). It's very entertaining for my son, and he'd watch it all day if I'd let him. I would highly recommend this video to any parent.",1234915200,,872,4.560509554140127
1940912,5,B0000EYV7E,"My 2,5 year old daughter started watching LETTER FACTORY about a month ago. One month later, she knows all the letters of the alphabet, from A to Z and she knows their sounds. Last week we started learning how to write them!
Its fun. As Tad and Professor cruise the factory they go into different rooms where letters learn their sounds. Letter A says ""Aaaa"", professor walks in dressed like a monsters and all letters and Tad shout ""Aaa"". The song follows ""the A says Aaa, the A says Aaa. Every letter makes a sound, the A says Aaa"". Letter P is like Popcorn, T is a tap dancer, etc. etc. till the Z which likes to sleep.
Excellent idea how to teach 2 year old letters! I also bought my daughter a wooden alphabet puzzle. It helps connect letters to object names A is for Apple, N is for nest etc.
Check out Leap Frog WORD FACTORY! It teaches kids how to read short words by the sounds that letters make. I recommend it also.",1234915200,,925,4.261363636363637

The only thing I would change about this DVD is that they don't have the long vowel sounds like they do in the Leap Frog Fridge phonics, and as a former teacher the pronunciation for ""L"" leaves a bit to be desired.

Other than that, the DVD is very entertaining and captures and retains the child's attention.",1231372800,,541,4.1923076923076925

It is wonderful.  She is so interested in spelling now that she asks me how to spell different words through out the day!  And it is a really fun game to her to guess which letters make which sounds.  I find myself singing the little song on the DVD to them.  As a mom I think it is important for us to review these products to find out what really works.  Which is one of the reasons I bought this product!

1940924,5,B0000EYV7E,"This is a very impressive DVD!
  Since my son had just learned his uppercase letters and had such excitement at picking them out on signs etc. I thought learning the sounds they make would be fun for him.
 Since he picked up so many words from Blue's clues, which I highly recommend for 2 and under, he seemed to learn from dvds and I thought this would be a nice upgrade.
  Well, in 2 weeks, he only watched this DVD 4 times total, and not even completely each time.
So I wasn't expecting much and was really shocked he had learned all the letter sounds, except for I (i), which he confused with the sound for Y (yi). The I came about 2 weeks later.
 In fact, he comes up to us to 'quiz' him, and says 'The A says..' then he chirps 'Aaah!'. And will stand there and wait for us to go thru the whole alphabet!
  He is so proud of himself, like he cracked some big code, which I guess, he did!
Its been very empowering for him! :D
At the grocery store, he's on the lookout now for letters and then he says the sound it makes, so its made what used to be a boring trip for him, really entertaining. Thank you for that Leapfrog. ;)
  My only (minor) disappointment with the DVD is that I expect each Letter to have a different song, and while each one has a different clever 'story' on how they make their sound, the song they sing at the end of learning each letter is the same. The B says... the B says... every letter makes a sound, the B says... And so on.
I thought each letter having its own song would be more distinctive and easier to learn for toddlers, but this is minor as it didn't slow my son down one bit!
This is the most valuable dvd in our collection, my toddler asked for it often. Now that he's mastered it, I'm buying the next one in the series... we are moving onto words!",1231027200,,1790,4.103151862464183

1940931,3,B0000EYV7E,"The creators of this program have come up with an excellent concept; animating letters that make sounds representing each letter in the Alphabet.  I have a degree in Psychology and studied several modules on how children learn to read.  I also have 2 preteen children who I taught to read and one 4 year old daughter who I bought this learning video for.  The four year old learnt all the sounds pretty quickly.  However, there are a few letters pronounced incorrectly; L is pronounced ULL, R is pronounced ER and a few others are not clear.

But by far the BIGGEST problem with this video is that all the letters are only taught in UPPER CASE letters.  So your lovely child may learn all her sounds but most books for children are written in lower case letters, with CAPS only at the beginning of sentences and names.  Some parents may not see this as a problem because we take for granted that our experienced minds can easily switch between reading lower and upper case letters, but from the numourous case studies I did to complete my modules, plus from my own experience with my children, most childhood educators recommend teaching lower case letters first, then very early introduction of upper case letters. 98% of all prose in all books is written in lower case!  Imagine a 4 year old learning the letter 'A', then in a simple book you expect them to identify the 'a' in printed text then link the two objects as being the same?! To their young eyes its a completely different object and you will have to reteach them from scratch as I have had to do with my 4 year old.

However, buying this video is still recommended though, but what I have done to help my child is to have a book with colourful lower case letters close by to show her everytime the capital letter is shown on the video.  This same problem of CAPS only is on the entire Leapfrog series, I have 4 of their DVDs.  Other than these problems its a brilliant concept, the animation is very entertaining, the repetition is essential to rote learning and most importantly; my child enjoys watching it.",1229558400,258,2073,4.53083109919571

My two year old son who has a hard time talking loves this video. If you draw each letter he will tell you the sound that goes with each one. That blows me away and it is all thanks to this DVD.

If you don't have it, get it. And don't worry about those reviewers who said it teaches incorrect sounds. It's just not a factor.  This DVD works and my two kids are proof of it.",1226793600,,707,4.071942446043166

But I do agree with other reviewers that there are a couple of mistakes, such as the ""L"" and ""R"" sounds.  Also, it kinda bugged me that Leap lied to his brother Tad about losing his voice, so Tad could do the presentation.  Does that show that it's okay to 'white lie'?  Anyway, I still give this DVD a 5-star rating.  I think it's excellent in teaching letters and phonics!",1224460800,,481,4.359550561797753

The only negative I can think of is for the ""w"" letter, the letter speaks in slang with ""waz happenin' dude!"" (I'm no fan of the word ""dude""!) In another clip, the professor was tasting popcorn and commented that it needed salt. As a result, in a later scene, the student frog mentioned salt, obviously having learned ""salt"" is a treat. With childhood obesity on the rise, I'm not sure it's too keen promoting salt! But by no means would this land my review one less star.

I can't rave enough of this product. My review title says it all. I have spread word among playground chatter and to all my parent friends. This is not to be passed up.

My daughter loves it and she often asks to watch 'professor Quigley' over and over again.  I have found her reciting the letters and sounds to herself before she goes to bed at night.
The reason why I didn't give this 5 stars is because of one thing.  When teaching the L sound, it is not very clear and both my daughter and I hear 'O'.  When we get to that part, she would ask me why are they saying 'O' when it's 'L'.
Other than that, I'd recommend it to all parents of preschoolers.",1223164800,,590,4.113043478260869

1940980,5,B0000EYV7E,"I just purchased this video for my 3 year old son and am thoroughly impressed by the quality of this product.  The video goes through each letter of the alphabet teaching viewers the sound of each letter and noting the lower and upper case writing of each.  Each letter comes with a silly antic that children can associate the letter with and there is a reoccuring catchy tune that my son was singing right away.

This video primarily teaches phonics, but combined with whole word training it can be a very effective tool in teaching your child the beginning stages of reading.  I have been using this video as part of an integrated learning approach with workbooks and just noticing letters and sounds in our everyday environment and am amazed at my sons level of interest and ability to catch on.  Making learning fun, rather than work is hugely important to me so a video that my sons finds entertaining while I know is educational is a winner for me!",1221955200,,954,4.588235294117647

The only caution is not be in the same room when your kid watches this - once these catchy educational songs get into your mind, there's no getting them out. Trust me, no one in the office is going to take you seriously once they hear you singing  ""every letter has a sound and B says 'buh'"" to yourself at your desk.

They both already knew their letters and most of the sounds, but this really solidified it for them.  They were quickly ready for the Talking Words Factory and the Code Word Caper.  The Code Word Caper introduces long-vowel sounds which are not addressed in the first two videos.  The only reason I give this four stars instead of five is because one of the characters, Mr. Websley, is a cantankerous, bossy, and demanding fellow.  Not exactly a great role model for the kids.

1941053,5,B0000EYV7E,"My daughter received the Leap Frog Fridge Phonics as a birthday gift last year and had absolutely no interest in it.  I thought it was great, but it ended up on the shelf.  We also got the Leap Frog Letter Factory little board book at a yard sale that rarely got read (us reading it to her.)  Despite these and other toys that are supposed to help little ones learn their letters, my daughter seemed to have little interest in the subject.  She could recognize 3 or 4 letters, but otherwise she didn't much care and we didn't push.

That all changed once I got this video!  She watched it twice the first time we popped it in.  Once I realized that the story in the video matched the story in the book, I got it out and she eagerly followed along, turning the page for each letter.  After watching it a few more times within a week she started playing with the Fridge Phonics.  The songs match the ones on the video and I hear her singing along, ""S says sssss....every letter makes a sound...""  Now she points out a letter or at least make the phonetic sound when we are out and about.  It is great!

The video itself is pleasant to watch.  It is not too ""cutesy"" and the story is nice.  The songs are catchy but not annoying.  I was happy to sit down and watch it with my daughter, even if more than once in a day.

I don't know what it is about this video, but our daughter is finally interested in learning her letters.  It may still be awhile before she gets them all down, but at least she is finally excited to learn about them.  I also love that she is learning the phonetic sounds.  All in all I am very happy with this video.  Great buy!",1209168000,,1646,4.165079365079365

Both teach the proper letter sounds, which is the first step in learning how to read.  This is the best thing for teachers and also for homeschooling like I am doing.

This is amazing, considering she could memorize each letter and its sound  and also the order of the story, she can follow exactly all the conversation about each letter, and what Prof said. She even can memorize the colour of each letter and can relate simple words with the letter. This is really unbelievable, this dvd is very entertaining and at the same time is educational. She can ask to watch the dvd one day a couple of times, which I have to restraint her from watching too much.

I definitely will recommend this DVD to all children who is going to learn about reading. Thank you for this wonderful DVD, which saves my time to teach my children as I am working mother.

On school nights my children have to be in bed by 8, but we prefer that they fall asleep to educational shows and these were the perfect fit. My 3 year old has even memorized all the songs!

I also purchased Math Circus and Talking Word Factory that are just as good.  We switch out watching one each day and she never gets tired of them.  Also, something I did not expect was that my 20 month old son loves them too!  These are his favorite videos and he actually gets them out of the entertainment center and brings them to me.

The on that really spurred him on was the Talking Words Factory by Leap Frog (the next one after this video).  Talking Words Factory also has a game you can play afterwards using your remote (to spell 3 letter words).  He loved that and learned without realizing it!

1941105,5,B0000EYV7E,"I have a 3 year old son. he was good with his alphabet recognition and names since a very long time and i was wanting him to learn phonics and then eventually start reading, as he is crazily attracted to books.

I had a concern that he very picky about what interests him and i certainly did not want phonics to be something he doesn't like learning. So it was important for me to make  acorrect choice of DVD which entertains him thorougly while making him learn.

Leap frog letter factory gave him the perfect first introduction to  phonics. It clicked with him so well that he wants to watch it over and over again. To my  surprise he has already started sounding letters specilly the ones he like.

Tedd and prof uigley actually visit the various letter rooms to learn the sounds. In these rooms the letters (from letter factory)are learning their own sounds. During each room visit, the letter sound is taught, prof quigley gives a few words starting from that sound, he also writes the letter on a slate (this helps children know how the letter is written and helps when they eventually learn writing), also the catchy jingle after every letter. The letters and sounds are repeated after every 4 new letters are taught. while in particular letter room, many words starting with that particular letter are deliberately used to give children a discreet sense of what the letter sounds like.

The best part about this DVD is that they have made the most perfect pronunciation / sounds of letters, along with associting them with mnay real life situations, where you hear those sounds. hence it  becomes very easy for the child to associate the sound with something, rather than learning it as a stand sound of the letter. vowels which are particularly dificult to remember (soundwise) even for adults have been so beautifully sounded in the dvd, associating them with different things.

for example the sound of a (as pronounced in apple) is taught as a response when someone scares you. It is funny for children to see tedd getting scared with the 'ae' sound and they instantly register it.

similarly the sound of O is taught through a jungle theme, tarzan sound.

Children can easily differentiate between sounds through these associations.

To begin with you might find the DVD going fast from one letter to another but I think the sped is perfect for children, as if too much time is invetsed on each letter, children may loose interest. After watching it a few times you will find the speed appropriate.

It is for me the bets way to teach phonics at home.",1204761600,,2565,4.685968819599109

This past weekend, we were in a store, and there was a sign that said ""hot.""  He sounded out each of the letters for me when I pointed to them, and I was able to (I think) help him start to see how the sounds come together to make words.

My 5 year old, who had resisted many of my attempts to learn letters (books, letter magnets and more), loved this video.  He learned his letters and the sounds that they made in no time, and he went from behind in his class to a little above average in the first quarter.  We have five of the Leap Frog videos total and my boys love them all.  My three year old knows many letters and their sounds, and is already showing interest in writing them too.  I give all of the credit to Leap Frog Letter Factory.

One thing to know is that the song that they use to teach the letters and their sounds is VERY catchy.  You will be hearing it in your sleep after you play this video.  Fortunately, I didn't mind the song and the fact that the tune is so catchy ensures that your little one remembers the letters and their sounds.

By 22 months she knew the letters of the alphabet and I thought this DVD might help to reinforce it in a fun way.  It surpassed my expectations because now at 24 months my adorable granddaughter now knows the sound that each letter makes and can tell you words that start with each letter as well.  She recognizes letters on boxes, cards, and signs and tries to sound out the letters.  She also can tell you several words that start with each of the letters.  She's just turned 2 at the end of December!!  It's incredible.  I have now ordered Talking Words Factory and am looking forward to watching it with her.  (Check back for my review on Talking Words Factory too!)  The video makes the way the letter produces the sound easy for a child to understand AND remember.  It is a wonderful learning product presented in a fun and exciting way. (I'm a retired librarian and am always on the lookout for great learning materials.)  I highly recommend this for as soon as your child shows an interest in learning ABCs.",1199232000,,1232,5.14070351758794

Within only a couple of weeks, she was able to recognize all of the letters and describe the phonetic sound attached to each letter!

He was excited because he wanted to use his new TV but I didn't want him watching junk all the time.  So we told him he could watch tv either on the way to the baby sitter's house or on the way home--not both.  The baby sitter lives less than 5 minutes from our house.  We put in The Letter Factory so at least he'd be ""learning"" something while he watched in the car.  In less than three weeks, he knew all his letters and sounds from watching this movie.  He is now absolutely obsessed with finding letters everywhere around him, wanting to know what the words say how to spell things.  Before watching his ""ABCD Movie"" (that's what he calls it!) he had no interest in letters and especially not sounds!  I would and do recommend this movie to anyone!

By her second birthday, my daughter could identify and name almost all 26 letters and sounds.  I suggest using this DVD accompanied with the Fridge Phonics Magnetic Set.  I would have loved to use these tools at the beginning of the year when I was teaching first grade for the kids that still didn't know all the letters/sounds.

The story line is great, the kids love it, and if they watch it as much as my kids do, they'll learn their letters in no time at all.  Great as a supplement to other learning, but also a great movie to stick in during quiet time.  We have Word Factory also, but it doesn't have as much as an impact as this one does.

I would give it 5 stars, except some of the rponunciation of letters is incorrect. Especially for the letter L (where did they get the UULL sound?). There are a few more letter, like O, M, N, R, but they are not as profound as L.

This program hits the ""button"" for unleashing your pre-schooler's interest in letter-sound recognition.  Combined with lots of games/books/songs that encourage rhyming and repetition (cat in the hat and early reader books read aloud are good) you'll ensure you're providing your child lots of opportunities to develop phonemic awareness -- a critical foundation to later reading success.

The letter sounds are presented in context of a song (to the tune of ""Farmer in the Dell"") and a fun story.  Kudos to Leap Frog for creating something entertaining for little ones AND educationally sound.  My son requests this DVD regularly and is now trying to put letter sounds together.

Now I can have them look at any random letter of the alphabet and tell me what it is and what sound it makes. The 3 yr old can even read small words now. Whereever we go they see letters and yell them out loud- for example at the grocery store, on someone's shirt,etc. This honestly is the best dvd we own and the girls would watch all day if I let them!!!",1190851200,,600,4.050420168067227
1941234,5,B0000EYV7E,"I'm probably going to say what everyone has already said, but this DVD deserves it.

My 2-year old son rarely sits still or pays attention to much of anything.  However, he really does watch this whole show.  The characters are cute and colorful, but the animation is simple enough not to be overwhelming.  Do not expect a movie of cinematic genius, but do expect something your pre-schooler will love.  Aside from the letter learning, the story and how the characters interact and treat eachother is charming and appropriate without being too saccharin.

Additionally, and most importantly, he was repeating letter sounds the very first time he watched it.  He already has a favorite letter, ""W"", which he calls ""double.""  He dances to the music and I think it helps that he has the magnetic letter set and the little player that came with them sings the same song for each letter and it's sound, so he recognized it.

I was nervous when it first started playing because the legal warnings at the beginning were very poor video quality and I thought maybe the whole movie would be that bad, but it was ok once the movie started.  I love the letter song, it is so cute, that I sing everyone of them!  It is repetative, but that's what makes it such a good learning tool.  I think we will be watching this for some time to come!",1190505600,,1327,4.552742616033755

1941248,5,B0000EYV7E,"As a preschool teacher, I am always on the look out for great teaching aids, and this is certainly one of them!! I used it at the tail end of the year last year to help introduce the more difficult letters like x, y, and z. Each time we watched a segment, the children wanted more.

The story takes place in a working letter factory where they are manufacturing letters and teaching them their sounds before going off to books, or wherever a letter is needed. Each letter has to be taught their own sound. For instance: a monster scares the letter ""a"" and it says ""ah!"". The letter ""c"" is c-c-c-cold! The letter ""o"" lives in a jungle and swings from vines like Tarzan while saying the short o sound.

The dvd is divided into 27 short (30 seconds or so) chapters with each letter containing it's own chapter and an intro as the 1st chapter. This makes it very easy to pop in with each letter and help learn the story of that letter before going on to do activities around it.

The twins and I laughed as Tad, the frog, visited the factory's 26 letter rooms where letters practiced their sounds.  The panting H with tounge hanging out, The I that gets slimed and the lollypop licking L.

1941285,5,B0000EYV7E,"We originally bought this as a Christmas present.  At first my daughter showed no interest in it.  Now, at just under 3 1/2 years old, she asks to watch it at least once a day. She became very interested in the DVD once her long term memory improved and she was able to remember what different letters looked like.  It has accelerated her letter recognition and really helped her recognize some letters that look and sound the same (B,P,D,etc...).  Now when she recognizes a letter she say its name and sings the song with the correct pronunciation from the DVD. All this with about two weeks of exposure to the DVD.

As a parent I really like how this DVD, My First LeapPad: Alphabet book and the Letter Factory Game all reinforce the same idea. She gets the repetition in different formates.  I highly recommend these products.",1183420800,,829,4.605442176870748

I like the introduction of each letter, and the repetition of the little song for each letter is good for young ones (it's the same thing that's on a lot of the Leap Frog toys).  But I always skip over the introduction.  It's really drawn out, and kind of over-the-top with it's pro-capitalism.  Why do they have to have this factory where some big rich duck is going to come see a presentation to decide whether or not to buy these letters?  And why do they have to say things that I think are borderline racist like: ""our letters are the best letters in the world!"".

They are fun to watch and extremely educational! I have been amazed at how quickly my children have picked up their letter sounds. My six year old daughter was already reading, but after watching these movies she has improved a great deal. My four year old daughter started reading after viewing these movies for a couple weeks. My three year old daughter knows all her letter sounds. Just the other day she put some refrigerator magnets on our fridge and sounded them all out to make a word. My 20 month old son knows many of the letter sounds just by watching the Letter Factory. He points out letters in books and tells us the sounds they make. They all love the whole series and ask to watch them over and over and over again. I have never come across any other series that have caught my children's attention like this.

1941436,5,B0000EYV7E,"I bought this for my 6 yr old.  We homeschool and I had gone through one reading curriculum and tried two other approaches on my own.  We were most recently doing Hooked on Phonics but with the old version and he wasn't progressing very well with that. He was stuck with the letter sounds. He was frustrated beause his twin brother was doing great with his reading and was moving forward quickly.  So, I got the new version of HOP and got this video, too, because he likes to watch movies.  Well, the DVD arrived first and, even though it is a touch too ""young"" for him, he has enjoyed it very much and has watched it every day.  By the time we got the new HOP in the mail, he knew every letter sound just from watching the movie!  He is enjoying learning to read again and was so excited to get the new HOP in the mail.  The only complaint I have is how they sound the letter ""P.""  But he remembers it now, can see there is a difference between ""P"" and ""B"" sounds (both my boys had problems distinguishing that) and I can easily correct him in saying it properly- not a huge negative, IMO.",1172966400,,1090,4.181818181818182

In about 1 week he knew over 2/3 the alpabete. After 1 month he knows all the leters and the majority of the sounds. He points out letters on the road and says the name and the sound. My brother LOVES this video and he is very picky about what he watches.

The songs are catchy but can get annoying. it goes: ""A say AH. A says AH. Every letter makes a sound and A says AH."" For every letter. It only makes 1 sound for each letter, but i wish they said both sounds for them.

I HIGHLY recomend this along with the ""Leap Frog Fridge Phonics Magnetic Letter Play Set.""",1172880000,,714,4.056737588652482

He just turned 4 and in preschool, but I am certain he is now ahead of most kids in my daughters kindergarten class and they are over halfway through the year.

The weird thing is he LOVES watching it and playing the simple game at the end using the remote.  I watch him as he mouths the sounds as the letters come up.

The only downside is that we as adults have to hear it.  The simple songs are eerily addicting and almost impossible to remove from your head after only a couple viewings. My wife and I laugh about it and when we notice the other looking content and peaceful, all the other has to do is sneak up and sing ""The B says ""buh"""".  Its good for a laugh but sort of mean because it take a few hours to forget it again.  I'd almost rather have 6 hours of hiccups.

As for my son, he could have worse songs stuck in his brain so I'm sure he'll be OK.  But definitely buy the video and be amazed at how smart your kids really are.",1172534400,,1094,4.051162790697674

Simply put, within a day or two my 3 year old son knew all the sounds of the letters of the alphebet.  These are great phonics tools and pre-reading equipment.  Presently my son and I reside in a non-english speaking country and I am always on the look out for (english) pre-school material that would hold his interest. One or two of the letters sounds are a bit off but really of no major consequence.",1171584000,,527,4.479166666666667

But the amazing thing, is that after about 2 more showings my 2 year old who had previously shown no interest in letters or letter sounds knew them all too!  -- 2 years old!!! --- He walks around pointing out letters on signs and saying their sounds.  He actually sounds out words this way, even though he doesn't realize he is doing so - but when he does, look out books!  I have lent this DVD to several friends with kids ages 2 to 5, and each child has been interested and has learned the sounds.  Just amazing!

If there are going to be moments when I throw on the tv in weakness I'd rather she watch something informative. This is a good pick and much better than sesame street. Colorful and fun way to learn phonics though they disregard the fact that some letters have multiple sounds such as a, c, e, g, i, o, and u. I guess it was just easier to present one sound to fit the sing-song format they use. I figure this will teach the basics and I can expand on the rest later.",1169510400,,572,4.162162162162162

1941467,4,B0000EYV7E,"I bought this for my three year-old daughter and it is definitely helping her to learn her letters and sounds.  She sings the little songs that talk about ""B says buh ..."" and that kind of thing even when it isn't on.  And I have noticed she answers me correctly a lot more now when I ask her what sound a letter makes or what the letter is after only seeing the DVD three or four times.  The DVD keeps her attention.  She will watch it all the way through and asks for it.

They have catchy ways of introducing the sounds that makes sense and are memorable.  For instance, the S has snakes and the snakes make the sssss sound and they are shaped like S's, too.

The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because we have had problems with the DVD itself.  The first one we bought had to be returned because it wouldn't play.  The second one has one area that hesitates every time -- I may return that one, too.

1941523,5,B0000EYV7E,"My husband and I purchased this movie, and gradually the others in the series, for our two and a half year old son.  He soon asked to watch ""Tad Letter Factory"" just about everyday, at least once.  Seeing his enthusiasm after a couple of days of requests to watch it, I decided to start working with him on his phonics sounds with his Leap Frog Fridge Phonics magnetic letters and was surprised to witness that MY TWO-AND-A-HALF-YEAR-OLD KNEW EVERY PHONICS SOUND FOR ALL TWENTY-SIX LETTERS of the alphabet!!  I then quizzed our son in front of his Daddy so that he could witness what I just had.  Sure enough, he was amazed at what he had learned without us working with him yet!!  Months later, he still asks to watch ""Letter Factory"" and walks around singing the ""the ____ says _____"" song from the movie, retaining each letter name and vowel sound.  We frequently catch him sounding out letters on signs and places all around us (beginning reading), and all at age 2!!  I cannot recommend this movie enough to every parent interested in teaching their child letter names and phonics sounds!!  Our son now watches the LeapFrog Word Factory & Code Word Caper and we are now looking into the Leapster Letter Factory Cartridge, hoping to engage him even more toward a jumpstart on a lifetime love of reading!!",1168128000,,1308,4.656521739130435

1941556,5,B0000EYV7E,"My 2 yr. old son loves this DVD.  He asks to watch it almost daily.  After only a few times watching Letter Factory he knew all his letters and recognized them by sound.  It's amazing to see a lil guy like him knowing all that so soon.  I love this and would highly recommend it to anyone.  As a matter of fact I bought one for all 3 of my siblings to let their kids (which are a year or 2 older and didn't know letters yet)watch and learn.  Sure enough, they learned it as well. What a great concept they use to teach by singing.  The ""A"" says ""Ah"" every letter makes a sound the ""A"" says ""Ah"". Then using a purple monster costume to scare the ""A's"" into saying ""Ahhhh"".  It's cute and I enjoying watching it with him.  You can stop it after each letter segment and review the letters if you like.  Also on the menu it has a game.  Use your remote to play.  It says for instance, what letter says ""mmm"".  Then you can help your child scroll through the letters or you can as he/she points to the correct letter.  Select the correct letter and balloons and clapping and saying ""Yay"" go up the screen.  The DVD is about 45 minutes long.  This is a must have for any child 2-6 that hasn't learned all this yet.",1167782400,,1208,4.098290598290598

1941558,5,B0000EYV7E,"We don't watch a lot of TV, so this was a real treat for my son.  He would earn this video with good behavior, and he was learning also.  He also loves Math Circus.  We started this video at age 2 1/2, which was perfect.  After about five times through of just staring at it, he just started singing along.  The songs are so catchy, that he couldn't help but remember.  He started pointing out letters on signs and all over the place in the car.  It's so obvious this series was designed by preschool educators that really know what captures the attention of kids age 2-5.  Wonderful series!
Update 2012-
My second little boy als learned his letters with this video.  I can teach a certain amount, but it takes me so long by myself, when I can teach along with this wonderful video.  My first son was very visual and this video was the key to what I had been missing teaching him myself.  My second son is very auditory, memorizing books and song lyrics easily at age 2.  So this video didn't cause him to immediately grasp all (probably half) of the letters, though he did love to sing along.  So, I brought in a physical element -block capital letter magnets from Mardel store.  We held them in our hands and looked at them during each letter and reviewed the letters four at a time.  Then used the magnets in the car ( I would hold one up) and we would sing the song.  Within a week of getting the magnets, and watching the video a few more times with me, he had all 26 letters and sounds committed to memory.  That was at 34 months.  Now at 40 months (and we do not practice letters very often anymore) he says S-S-S School bus starts with ""S"" Mommy!  and D-D-D Daddy starts with ""D""!  so he is applying to our daily lives and conversations.  Awesome.  I have gifted several of his classmates with this video for birthday presents.  Get it!",1167782400,,1844,4.311953352769679

1941560,4,B0000EYV7E,my daughter is 2 and watches this every morning. She has been a slow talker so I thought this would help her out with sounds and the alphebet at the same time.

1941561,5,B0000EYV7E,My daughter LOVES this DVD. She fell in love with it from the first time she saw it at 15 months.

While getting our oil changed the other day she was reading the letters on the soda machine - much to everyone's surprise in the lobby! I can't say enough about this video. My daughter is now 18 months old and continues to ask for the DVD every day.

Two different people recommended this DVD to us, and it has been amazing!  There is a room for each letter, with that letter making its sound, and a catchy tune for each letter.  For example, in the ""E"" room there is an old Letter ""E"" in a rocking chair, and every time the young frog says something to him, he says, ""eh?"" (the ""e"" sound).  The song for each letter is to the tune of ""The Farmer in the Dell,"" and says, ""The (letter) says (sound), the (letter) says (sound), Every letter makes a sound, the (letter) says (sound).""  I knew it was a success when an older child said a letter, and my son broke into song! :-)  I HIGHLY recommend this DVD!!",1163030400,,758,4.333333333333333

1941582,5,B0000EYV7E,"My son received this DVD as a gift from ""Grandmother"" 1 week before his 2nd Birthday. Now he is 2 years and 2 weeks old and can recognize EVERY letter in the alphabet AND say the corresponding phonetic sound. I am amazed at how quickly he picked it up. We are a bilingual family (English and Thai/Lao) and  thus far in his life he hasn't been extremely ""verbal"" yet (he walked at 10 months and is great with all the physical stunts, but so far doesn't have a very large vocabulary).

I thought this DVD would be something a 2-year-old would need time to ""grow into"", but it has been great for him. It is proven that the mind can recall information more easily when we learn things in a certain context. For example, the ""K"" says ""kuh"", while at the same time doing a ""kick"" and  singing the ""K"" song. All of these cues, visual, audile, and kinesthetic, help seal the information in your child's memory.

As a professional English as a Second Language teacher and a Master's Degree holder, I highly recommend this DVD for preschoolers.",1163030400,,1034,4.48404255319149

1941620,5,B0000EYV7E,My three year old twins learned the sounds of the letters of the alphabet well and quickly just by watching the DVD. It is fun to watch. It works.,1159833600,,146,4.068965517241379
1941621,4,B0000EYV7E,"My 2 year old son LOVES this video.  He never has seen a cartoon before this so I wasn't really sure if it would capture his interest but it did for the whole thing!  My son loves to repeat the letters and sometimes (he has the fridge set too) he will run into the kitchen and get the letter they are singing about.  He just turned two and he can sing his whole alphabet, reconizes most of the letters and knows the sounds most of them make.  While this video is not soley responsible for this, I do think it played a big part (esp. with letter recognition and sounds).  Relatives comment all the time that they cannot believe how much he knows at his age and the pediatrician said these are 3 year old skills.  The reason I gave it only 4 stars and I am surprised no one else has mentioned this, but for the letter K they do K is for kick and they show the letter's kicking the wall.  Whenever my son gets his letter k off the fridge he runs over to the wall, kicks it and says ""kick"".  I then have to explain to a barely two year old that it is not okay to kick the wall they just do it on the video to show the letter sound. I can't imagine with all the words out there they chose this one.  One other thing - not nearly as important to me as the kicking is that if you sit and watch it with your child, Professor Quigley is extremly annoying.  Not a big deal if you don't watch it with your child but he will drive you nuts if you sit and watch it or are even in a room where you can hear him.  That is a minor flaw considering the educational value in it.  All in all I think this video is a very effective tool at teaching letter sounds and the alphabet and would highly recommend it.",1158883200,2,1690,3.967455621301775

The action/association with the phonetic sounds in incredible and he knows all of his letter sounds forward and backwards!  Definitely recommend.

We bought it along with the ""Word Whammer"" toy and I also got the fridge phonics in spanish...so my only complain is how come they didn't have the DVD in Spanish??

1941714,4,B0000EYV7E,"I purchased all 5 of the Leap Frog DVDs after reading the reviews. I too am very pleased w/the videos. My son isn't even 3yrs old yet and can recite the alphabet, recognize all letters upper case and lower case, knows the order of the alphabet. He can sign (ASL American Sign Language) every letter of the alphabet. He can write most letters (not in a straight line but recognizable) A C D E F G H I J K L M O P Q S T U V W X Y Z. Most of this was by 2 1/2 years old. So of course when I saw these DVDs I knew they would take him to the next level. And they did, at 38 mos old he watched the Leap Frog Letter Factory 3 times and knew every sound every letter makes. I would sing the catchy song ""Every letter makes a sound the G says..."" and he would respond w/the ""G"" sound. Now he says ""G"" then the letter sound after it. 2 wks ago we moved to the Talking Word Factory and now one month before his 3rd birthday he can spell from 12-15 words. CAT DOG CAR COW BLUE BOY GIRL STOP GO RED BOOTS are a few. He can spell his first and last name. I am looking forward to moving on to the other videos. Now of course all of this isn't due to just the videos but this has been a very helpful tool. I suggest these videos to everyone who has a child close to his age. As long as my son shows the interest in letters and numbers and spelling we will continue to keep up the pace and progress through to the next video. Besides he enjoys learning so much. These videos are priced so reasonably and the children get so much out of them. I played these 2 dvds in the car while on the way to an amusement park and the other child in the car was so interested in them she didn't say much the whole way to the park, she will be in the first grade.

Now, about a month or so after buying this video, he knows every letter of the alphabet and is even starting to write some of them on paper.  I have no guilt for letting him watch this for a half hour while I cook dinner, like I do with some of the other kids shows, because I know he is really learning from it...This video is a must have!!!",1152316800,,558,3.920353982300885

The contents were well organized and using imagery as well as sound in the background to emphasize the sounds of letters. There is a room for each letter to introduce its phonetic sound, using literal images such as flying for F, vibratiing room for V, buzzing bee fo B, etc. Each letter is then sung in a  melody which is very familiar for anyone.

After watching it for only a couple of weeks he already knows almost all of the letters and many of their sounds.  I also got a couple other alphabet videos to reinforce the same concept in different ways, but this one is by far the best.  The story is very clever and my son watches the entire story intently.  We also have the Fridge Phonics magnet set by Leap Frog, which sings the same tune as on the video, and I love having that toy along with this video.  I will definitely be purchasing more of these DVDs for gifts for kids from 1 1/2 to 3 (although I am sure it could be enjoyed by kids who are even in Kindergarten already).",1151193600,,786,4.206666666666667
1941741,5,B0000EYV7E,"This is the first review I've ever written for Amazon, but I had to let other parents know about this fantastic DVD.  We've had it for about 3 weeks and already my 3 year old not only knows all the letters (lowercase and uppercase) by sight and sound, but she can also WRITE them (capitals only).  Now, where ever we go, she says, ""Look mommy, letters!""  And she tells me their names and sounds.  She's also picking up books and sounding out the letters she sees. Almost all of these milestones happened since we have had this DVD.  I normally prefer to teach her myself, but in this case, the Letter Factory DVD has been able to teach her in 3 weeks what I've been trying to teach her for the last 3 months.  Even my 17 month old child repeats the letter sounds and can recognize a few letters when she sees them (she gives their sound).

We also have the Talking Words Factory DVD which builds upon the Letter Factory.  It introduces simple words and letter blends.  Although the topic of letter blends seems to be a little incomplete, this video still does a great job of teaching phonics to build words.  We've only seen it a couple of times but my 3 year old already is noticing word blends and sounds them out.  I just can't say enough good things about these products. I HIGHLY recommend them to any parent who wants to teach their child letters and phonics.",1150934400,,1365,4.376984126984127

He is now associated letter sound with the letter.  I'll show him a letter and ask the sound and he know it.  This is a great learning video.  They love watching it together and I get a little bit of me time (at least 30 minutes)  I just ordered the Math and Words DVD.  Can't wait to get them.,1150156800,,460,4.022222222222222

I was really starting to worry because he was just months away from starting kindergarten.

A friend recommended this video so I tried it.  Within a week he could recognize every single letter from a flashcard and knows its sound.  When he sees the letter he acts out the letter's action from the DVD to make its sound.

I went out and got the Talking Words Factory 1 and 2 immediately.  It's almost unbelievable to me, but it has been about 3 weeks now and he is sounding out words and has read the first 2 Hooked on Phonics BOOKS!  I'm here now to find more of these videos.

He wanted to write words, but he couldn't recall the letter sounds easily.  Then we rented this video from the library, and he seems to have mastered his letter sounds overnight.

Additionally, his 3 y/o sibling, who knew his letters but not their sounds, is almost on par with his older brother now.

My children really, really enjoy this video--despite the fact that our library copy has multiple scratches and gets ""stuck"" 7-8 times during the story!  I have been impressed with how easily that this video can teach letter sounds, so I went and bought a (unscratched!) copy.  It is worth the investment!

Only one negative--some letters have two sounds, like the letter ""c"" or the vowels.  This video only covers one sound per letter, which is different from the LeapFrog toy products, which mention both sounds for each letter.",1146096000,2,948,4.808641975308642

He's been switching back and forth between the two for the past week.  He was the sort of kid who preferred Bob the Builder and Dora movies...not that they are bad by any means, just not quite as educational...I was initally concerned that he might not like them (having never seen them before myself!).  They are very cute, and kept his attention. He likes to dance around the room singing the different letter's songs...If you are looking for fun, yet educational toys for your kids, I am a HUGE Leap Frog Family Fan!",1145664000,,858,4.39873417721519

She is almost 3 now and reads at a 2nd - 3rd grade level.  People are amazed!!!  This DVD is a must for any child interested in their ABC's.",1144713600,,425,3.839080459770115

He got interested and learned his letters through the Leap Frog Learning Hoops toy and I thought he would love this DVD. He likes it, but not as much as Baby Einstein, Veggie Tales, and Thomas the Tank Engine. I'm sure if he wasn't hearing impaired, it would be a lot easier for him to enjoy it and discriminate between the sounds that the letters make more easily. Overall, it's a great DVD!

**UPDATE** 1/19/08 My son has taken a stronger liking to this DVD and I often hear him imitating the letter sounds (even the ones that are hard for him as a hearing impaired child!). I often hear him say, ""every letter makes a sound the __ says..."" And my TWO YEAR OLD DAUGHTER is even saying these things!! She is way advanced for her age and already can count to ten and say most of the ABC'S when she sings the song.",1144368000,,899,4.196531791907514

After watching this only a handful of times, he knew EVERY letter and a lot of the letter sounds.  He now knows all the letters and ALL the sounds and it's only been a month or two since I bought it.  He loves the characters and the little songs for each letter.  It's also priceless to see him laughing at different parts of the movie.

I highly recommend this movie, especially if your child is interested in letters and likes music and singing.  I know you and your child will love it as much as my son, my husband, and I do.

After 2weeks from the video he knew all of them, both uppercase and lowercase, and knows what sound each makes.  Most importanly he Loves letters now.  He sings the 'every letter makes a sound' song with his friend when they play together.  He makes my husband and I sing it too him so he can say the sound at the end.  It's really great.  I have been able to teach him to sound out 3 and 4 letter words.  He is barely 3, and already reading! He is really doing wonderful and I have to give most of the credit to this video.",1143849600,,763,4.129251700680272
1941808,5,B0000EYV7E,"After the nearly 250 reviews that have been posted for this DVD, I'm sure I'm not stating anything new.  However, I have been so pleased with this purchase I just had to comment!  My two and  a half year old daughter has had this video for less than two weeks and has made tremendous strides with her efforts to verbalize all the letters and their sounds.  She has a minor articulation delay, so this is something that we've been working on for the past several months.  Since we brought this DVD home, she has shown much more interest in her ""ABC's"" and asks to watch the video daily.  We have a couple of other Leap Frog products that reinforce the same letter/letter-sound phonetic philosophy, but for some reason this video has been the thing that has captured her interest the most.  As a result, she has become much more interested in the other toys (flash cards, refidgerator magnets, etc...) since her exposure to this video.  I must say, as far as the video itself is concerned, it is truly one of the most clever introductions to phonics that I've ever seen.  (Our speech therapist thought so as well.)  But the best part has been hearing my daughter -- unprompted -- sing the song for each letter and make the appropriate sounds!",1143676800,,1240,4.570135746606335
1941809,5,B0000EYV7E,"Before the Letter Factory, my 2 year old was not interested in TV.  The only videos he watched was Journey Concert DVD and Fantasia 2000.  Now he asks for Leap Frog every morning and watches it over and over.  He can say all but 3 letters & sounds.  It is kind of ironic that he has a speech delay but picked up the alphabet so fast.  I wish Leap Frog would develop something like this for Chinese & Japanese.",1143676800,,409,4.1265822784810124
1941810,5,B0000EYV7E,"My son just turned three and he has been watching this DVD for three days.  He has watched it two or three times a day, and he can already tell me sounds for letters that I've never tried to teach him.  The only way he could be learning them is from this magnificent video.  My daughter, who already knows the letter sounds, finds those sounds reinforced as she watches the show.

For the real stickler, I can think of two things in this video that adults might not like.  First, after Tad (the youngest frog) learns the sound of the letter M, he burps.  However, the burp is very small (not a rude belch like so many shows have these days) and Tad says ""Excuse me"" immediately after.  It didn't bother me, but some might find it offensive.  The other item concerns the letter W, the sound of which is done to rap music.  I personally wish LeapFrog had chosen music other than rap since I don't want my children to develop a taste for that kind of music, but I believe that a small showing of it will be more than balanced by the music we normally listen to.  I mention this so people who are thinking of buying this DVD will know about anything to which they might possibly object.

On the plus side, this DVD has many positives besides teaching letter sounds.  The frog children, Leap, Lily, and Tad do not bicker with each other, but instead treat each other lovingly while they try to help each other.  In addition, they do not back talk to their parents.

Despite the two minor flaws, this gem of a DVD really teaches letter sounds in a loving, happy way, and my kids, age 3 and 5, love it enough to watch it several times a day.  And since it's so educational, I love letting them watch it!  (I also recommend the related DVD, Talking Words Factory.)",1143590400,,1756,4.324159021406728

My older son can now pronounce almost all the letters in the alphabet.  The video focuses more on just recognizing and naming letters, but the phonics behind letter sounds as well.  I think it will be much easier helping them learn to read now that they know what sound the individual letters make.

My only criticism is that I think the letter L is pronounced funny in the video.  Doesn't quite work as well with phonics reading as the other letters do.",1142380800,,571,4.339622641509434

The examples in the DVD helped him remember the phonetic sound of each letter if he forgot.  He's a pro now and of course watches it over and over and over again.

All three of my kids have learned from it, but I am most impressed with how much my youngest has learned.  He's almost 3 now and he knows all his letters by sight and there phonetic sounds.  But he knew the phonetic sounds far earlier...by the time his second birthday rolled around.

My 4-year-old knows the names and sounds of the letters as well and is already starting to sound out words.  He won't enter kindergarten until '07 (as his birthday is in Nov) so he should be reading quite well by then.

Now I know this isn't that incredible.  Kids their ages are doing this all over the world.  But as much as I adore my children, I am not a very patient person.  So I have not spent nearly as much time as I should working with them on these skills. I have to give Leapfrog most of the credit.

Having such good results with him, I used it in my first grade class to help the lower students. Also I used it when I taught preschool during the summer. The kids really get a kick out of the songs.

1941928,5,B0000EYV7E,"The video's best asset to me is that it gets to the actual learning quickly, after just a few minutes setting up the plot. The plot in a nutshell- Young Tad wants to learn the alphabet so Professor Quigly takes him from room to room in the talking letter factory and each letter does a short demonstration of the sounds it makes. (The vowels do short vowel sounds only.)  There is a quick musical review after every few letter sounds Tad learns. Effective.

Buy Leapfrog Fridge phonics and this dvd together and along with your own reading they will definately help your child learn letters and letter sounds. Fridge Phonics is geared towards auditory learners (kids who learn best through listening) and kinesthetic learners (kids who learn best through touching and doing). They manipulate the letters and the toy sounds them out. The video caters to visual learners.

I'm no teacher, but I believe the two toys work so amazingly because they cover so many types of learners. Most kids are probably a combination, but many have one style that just doesn't work. Example: I recommended this toy to my sister (a teacher) for my then two year old nephew who is anything but auditory. My sister says ""He just doesn't want to hear it."" He received this for Christmas and learned his letters in days!",1139443200,,1296,4.725663716814159

She was so bored with it that she kept coming over to me during the show and requesting other videos that she has.  She just did not get into this.  I think maybe because it's cartoon format.  Cartoons don't hold her interest unless they are interactive (asking the audience questions, etc.)  Otherwise, she prefers live people, puppets, etc.  But there was no opportunity for her to interact with this cartoon, so it didn't hold her attention.  Maybe she'll like it more when she gets older.  I have to admit though, I was a little disappointed and thought it was kind of boring too.",1138924800,4,735,4.557251908396947

In this dvd, all the letters of the alphabet are shown with their corresponding sounds. There is a distinction made between: ""Capital letters and lower-case letters.""

1941934,5,B0000EYV7E,"My son was diagnosed with Pervasive Development Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified when he was 3. PDD-NOS is on the Autism spectrum, and children with this diagnosis often have developmental delays.

My son had a speech delay and other developmental delays. His speech is great now...no one can detect that he has this diagnosis. However, the delays have, understandably, affected his learning in some areas.

While his spatial skills have been way above average--as has his grasp of science (such as planets and their attributes)--he has resisted reading. He gets tired and frustrated.

Well, trying many approaches for helping him, I thought I'd take a chance and get Letter Factory from Amazon.com, especially since the reviews were so good.

I am so THRILLED that I did! I thought for SURE he'd suspect that I was ""getting him to learn"" (make no mistake, PDD-NOS doesn't mean a low IQ!), but surprisingly, he's been watching Letter Factory on a consistent basis for WEEKS now! I'll even hear him singing the catchy songs to himself as he goes about his business.

In the DVD, Tad (Leap's younger brother) joins Professor Quigley to all the different rooms where new letters learn their sounds. For example, when they enter the A room, there's a silly purpose monster that scares the little A's into saying ""ahhhh!"" In the K room, the little K's are practicing their karate kicks as they learn how to make the ""kay"" sound.

What's especially great about the Letter Factory is that it combines the visuals of the letters with the sound that the letter makes in a very catchy tune. For example, as the F's are flying, they sing ""the F says 'eff', the F says 'eff'...every letter makes a sound, the F says 'eff'"". This method helps both audio and visual learners to grasp the sounds...not to mention those that are more musically inclined.

I see my son applying what he's learned (very quickly, I might add!) to books. He'll now pick up books from the library ON HIS OWN, and attempt to sound out the words. Combined with the DVD's Talking Words Factory I and Learn to Read at the Storybook Factory, I KNOW The Letter Factory has contributed to his progress in a BIG way.

Our daughter is already singing along with them as when they teach the letter's sound they always sing ""Every letter makes a sound and 'J' says 'juh'""  Kids love to sing so you can see why this works so well.",1137888000,,497,4.051020408163265
1941957,5,B0000EYV7E,"After reading the reviews about The Letter Factory I decided to purchase it along with The Talking Words Factory and Code Word Caper. I am so impressed with these DVD's. I was not sure how my 6 year old would like The Letter Factory, since he already knows his letters and sounds. But he was hooked. It's good practice for him. And in just the few times my kids have watched the DVD, my 3 year old has learned many of the letters and sounds that she didn't already know. The Talking Words Factory and Code Word Caper have been equally as impressive. My son has started writing many words he did not write prior to seeing these DVDs. Even though these two DVD's are more complex for my 3 yr old, she loves them as well and is getting a good introduction to creating words with letters. I highly recommend these DVDs. They are fun, interesting, and educational.",1137801600,,859,4.408805031446541
1941958,5,B0000EYV7E,"My 3 year old son could already recognize the letters of the alphabet, so I bought this hoping it could help him with the sounds of the letters. He watched it about 4 or 5 times and I was amazed, he now knows most of the sounds. The story is very entertaining and he is learning without even realizing it.",1137715200,,305,4.1
1941959,5,B0000EYV7E,"My son is almost 5 and he has very little interest in learning his ABC's and 123's.  He would much rather play on the computer, ride his bike, or pretend he is a superhero.  The videos sat there after Christmas for a few days until he tried everything else out that he had got and now he watches them all day long.  One after another and he keeps amazing me how he knows his the sound for V or R.  He feels so smart now and these videos have made it so fun.  Even with a interactive game on the DVD too.  He loves it and I love that he is learning.",1137024000,,548,3.8482142857142856

She watched it a half dozen times on the way down and 3 times on the way back then switched to ""Word Factory."" When we got home she requested and watched it at least once per day for a week or so. She doesn't watch alot of TV but the TV she does watch we try to make it educational. Anyway...back home after the holidays she went to her ""school"" and blew all the teachers away by the fact that she knew not only all her letters (which we had been working on for awhile) but also the way the letters SOUNDED - ""The B says Buh!"". In fact, the teachers brought her up to the Director's office and showed off her abilities. Imagine how proud the parents are when they hear a story like this - it made our day. Around the house we sing the song ""Every letter makes a sound the H says..."" and she responds with the proper sound...amazing how quickly kids are able to soak information in especially when it is presented in such an entertaining and easy to digest manner. Hat's off to Leap Frog - I just purchased the other DVDs in this series to have on-hand when she is ready.",1137024000,,1154,4.133333333333334

The DVD is pedagogically brilliant!!  Plus, it's even interesting for adults even after a few viewings.  The background scenery has lots of interesting, humerous detail that you can't catch the first time.

I sincerely hope Leap Frog creates more DVDs of this high calibre!!!!

Hey, I'm a teacher, so I'll take it upon myself to grade the makers of this DVD :-))

We've had them for about a year now, and the boys still enjoy them.  We get a lot more use out of them than the Leap Pads, which our kids never really got into.  Our younger boy is in speech therapy, and seeing these DVDs has improved his articulation of letters.  I love that he requests to watch these.  I will hear him sounding out each letter along with the Frog, and know he's developing skills.  Our older son has picked up on how to build words and spell with this series.  It explains how phonics work, and in a simple-to-understand way.  We found all of the DVDs in this series exceptionally educational, and see tangible results from the children watching them.  I can't say that about any other toy we own.",1134086400,2,889,4.392638036809816

He is seventeen months old and already repeats the letter sounds that he hears on this video and has a vocabulary of about ten words. He gets a kick out of making these sounds and the praise he gets from us.  He loves this video and I would definitely recommend this learning tool.  He is getting the Talking Words Factory DVD for Christmas.",1133913600,2,444,4.1395348837209305

1941977,5,B0000EYV7E,"As a homeschooling mom to 4, I'm always on the lookout for really good educational products. I ran across this DVD and my 3 and 4 year olds are hooked. I love listening to them sing the songs and tell me what sounds the letters make. Right now this is their favorite thing to watch. I highly recommend this DVD and am planning on getting the rest in the series",1133827200,,360,4.1571428571428575
1941978,5,B0000EYV7E,"Everyone thought my 28 month old was a genius - he knew all of his letters, AND the sounds they made!!  Once I had him with me when I stopped by my daughter's kindergarten class, and he waltzed in there and started naming the letters in words around the room and the kids just stared at him like he was an alien.  That was pretty funny.

Anyway, I really credit all that to this DVD, because other than a few readings of ""Chicka Chicka Boom Boom"", I didn't have the time or desire to push academics or pull out flash cards.

For some reason, kids really respond to this DVD.  I have recommended it to several friends - some with toddlers, and another with a kindergartener who was having trouble with letter recognition.  All of them made significant progress towards mastery of letters and sounds.

Personally I can't really figure it out - the video is almost annoying, with its high pitched cutsie voices, bland graphics, big-eyed frogs, and silly songs.  But kids, particularly toddlers, don't see it that way.

BTW, all of the Leap Frog videos are good - Math Factory, Word Factory, and Complex Word Factory.  Putting in these videos is a guilt free way to grab 30 minutes to fold laundry or get dinner on the table.",1132531200,18,1221,4.509090909090909

Children like it and learn their letter sounds from it.  The only drawback is that it doesn't teach both the long and short vowel sounds, only the short.  The only other rival is Challenger School's tape which you can only purchase via Challenger Schools. Its sister DVD, Word Factory is also good but if you choose one, go with the talking letter factory.  Once your kids have the letter sounds, skies the limit!",1132272000,,579,4.466666666666667

But don't be put off; keep watching.  These videos are amazing!  What a creative way to teach phonics.  We encorporated the fragments of song in the video into one long alphabet/phonics song.  My grandchildren learned phonics and were on their way to reading before the age of 3.  (My granddaughter actually read her first book shortly after receiving these videos.)

Now I use the video to help him with his speech.  If he is trying to say a word, like ""frog"", I'll say it starts with F and he'll make the ""f"" sound and then say the word correctly (he used to say ""bog"").  It is amazing.  He can watch this DVD over and over.  He recognizes letters while we are out shopping and will make their sounds when he sees them.  It's great all around!!",1132099200,,523,3.914285714285714

I have four kids (4, 3, 2, and 11 months)and I'm in the military so believe me when I say I didn't have the time to teach them anything.  They started out watching the DVD everyday, but now only watch it a couple of times a month, but they still get excited everytime you put the DVD in.  I recommend this DVD over any other DVD.

My almost 5 y.o. son couldn't even identify most of the alphabet in either upper or lower case.  I bought all 4 reading related dvds and now he's reading the first set of Bob books and I placed this order only 1 month ago!!!  Plus, my nearly 3 y.o. daughter is learning right along side him.

1941996,5,B0000EYV7E,"I would not normally write about my son but we feel like we have been given a present in this video.  We have lots of videos and toys that deal with the alphabet but none have captured the attention of my sone who has an autistic spectrum disorder.  He really does not like TV and does not play with toys.  We have lots of Leap Frog toys - and he does not play with them.

But, this video is really teaching him his ABC's and he asks to watch it over and over.  I sometimes hear him singing during the day the letter tunes.  If you heard one leap frog tune well you know what they sound like ( A says A, A says A, every letter makes a sound, A says A).  However, the visual cues that the video puts with the letters is awesome.  When we read other letter books at night he feel he has to say the sounds from this video.

BONUS:  the game on the DVD is so great.  The child is asked to find the letter that makes a certain sound.  If your child gets it wrong, it prompts again and if he/she gets it wrong again, it will show a little clip of the video as a visual reminder.  he loves this game and is actually learning his letters.

I highly recommend this for any child.",1130889600,2,1170,3.9656652360515023

I bought this at the recommendation of another mom at Walmart when we were looking at the Leap Frog books for Leap Pad.  My daughter is two, but I bought it anyway because we prefer educational videos and there aren't alot for her age.  To my surprise she asked for ""frogs"" quite a bit.  One day while giving my second daughter her bottle and reading a NORA ROBERTS novel simultaneously, my two year old walked up, tapped the outside of my book and said ""O"".  My imagination or lucky guess for her, right?  I tapped the next letter she said ""R"".  I tapped the ""A"" and she got it again!  Imagine my excitement!  ""Maddie, what's this one?"" And you guessed it, she spelled out R-O-B-E-R-T-S!  I had never worked on letters with her prior to this, she learned it entirely on her own, from the video!  She was two, I had no idea she would be able to self-learn so successfully.  Now we own the LF Word Factory and Math Circus and she enjoys them all very much.  She loves the refrigerater set, enjoys playing with the letters while I work in the kitchen.  She can almost sing the entire alphabet song on her own.  I've taught her to write the easiest letters, O and L and I, and we are working on the rest.  These videos are truelly amazing.  They are entertaining - she LOVES to watch them - and she still enjoys them at almost age 3.  As a bonus - they are not expensive!  Cheaper than Barney (who she loves) and Disney.(Bonus for me?

He went out to daddys squad car and read STATE POLICE today!  I was soooooo proud.  He knew daddy was a police officer but not that he worked for the State police so it wasn't something he knew already.  He walked right over and sounded it out!

I was astonished to see that this became his favorite DVD instantly and within a few weeks of watching regularly he could tell me what sounds all of the letters made.  It was amazing to me.  We have since bought the next few Leap DVD's in this series and my son (three now) is sounding out words on his own, and loving it. Sure, he isn't always able to put the individual sounds together and figure out the word, but most three letter words are read easily and correctly.

My younger son and one of my neices, both two years old, know all the letters by name, the sounds they make, and which are vowels. Don't be mislead by other reviews of leap movies that say the animation is low end.  I have not noticed anything low quality about these DVD's.",1129075200,,916,4.235632183908046

However, on his very first viewing of this video, he began repeating the letter sounds with the characters on the video.  He sat completely spellbound watching the program in its entirety and then begged to watch it over and over again, each time becomming more and more involved in making the letter sounds.  It was like a light came on for him and he now is excited to learn and to use his new found knowledge.

We've only had the video for a couple of months now and he almost knows his entire alphabet and can spell his name.  He can read letters on signs.  It's just amazing.

Other reviews speak to the content, so I'll leave it at our personal testimonial.  We highly recommend this and all the Leapfrog ""Letter Factory"" products.",1127779200,,935,4.640243902439025

Within 2-3 weeks of watching the video (not everyday, but frequently) he pretty much knew the entire alphabet! I like it because it ties in with other Leap Frog toys. ie, the Fridge ABC magnets. The consistency and repetition helps a child learn very quickly. After they have mastered the alphabet, you can move them on to the Talking Words Factory video.

It introduces every letter and the sound they make, as the video progresses they review the last 4 letters they have covered and then all of the alphabet at the end.  To me, the main goal at this time is for her to understand that each letter makes a sound, learning that will be great when she is ready to read.

He asks for this DVD all the time and as soon as he sees the ending credits come up he says, ""More fogs peeze"".  He watches it daily and never just once.  I actually find myself singing the song in the shower or on the bus!  A well done product for teaching letter sounds.  Very clever, fun and educational.

Originally I purchased Fridge Phonics and my son just wasn't catching on. Now we use both tools together and they are a wonderful learning tool.

I can take any letter and ask him what it is. If he is stumped I just start to sing the familar song or make the sound of the letter and he will instantly recall the letter or sound. This DVD is set up so you can teach the ABC's and Phonics in 4 letter groupings, or you can simply sit and watch it all the way through while interacting with your child.

If you're considering this for your child I couldn't reccommend it enough.

The marvellous thing is the DVD makes learning the alphabet so easy, also effortless!

I would rate this item much higher than 5 if I could!

Trust me, if you have preschool children (or older children who need help with phonics) this is well worth buying.  My older granddaughters (ages 7 and 9) watch this over and over too.  For whatever reason, none of them ever seem to get tired of it!

We do read to her a great deal and talk about the sounds and names of the letters. However, I can say-- without a doubt-- that this video has  been a main component in her excellent knowledge of the alphabet. I don't think it's necessary to play this video daily to be effective. Our daughter watched it a few times a week at most and it made an impact.  She's clearly recognized all of the letters since about 18 months of age and has been able to sound out most of them since 20 or so months. I've recommended this to all of my friends.

1942145,5,B0000EYV7E,"I got the Letter Factory DVD for my 17 month old daughter in February. She looked completely mesmerized since the first time we played it to her. She would laugh and squeal and bounce and imitate the sounds, and request to watch it everyday. After about a month, one day when we were idle in the car, I thought I would play a game by asking her if she knew "" A says ...."" what...

She knew... and I kept going.

We stopped at ""W""! She knew every sound from A to W! I asked her again at random order and she knew everyone except X, Y, and Z. She was only 18 months old and I never taught her phonics except playing her the DVD. This was a huge surprise. After that I noticed she would try to pronouce words that are around her.. labels... books... even signs and ads on the street. This DVD has provided a wonderful tool for me to teach our little toddler new words, and for her to say them properly. For instance, she's been saying CAR for a long time, but she used to pronouce it as ""GAR"". After I knew that she had learnt ""C"" says ""Ca"". I used that to teach her the correct pronounciation of CAR. Now she can say it crisp and clear every single time.

I have started showing her the Talking Word Factory and she loves it, too.

I must commend Leapfrog for putting out such a marvellous product, and would recommend it to all parents with young children.",1112745600,,1355,4.1603053435114505
1942146,5,B0000EYV7E,"I have never felt strong enough to actually take the time to write a review.  I am a certified k-6 teacher who has told everyone I know about this amazing movie and now I am telling you...This was the first (out of 4) Leap Frog Movie that my children watched.  My 3 1/2 year old and 2 years 2 month old boys are allowed to watch 1 movie a day.  Each Day they agreed, in excitement, to watched this movie.  Under a week my 3 1/2 year old knew his letter sounds. He could sing the letter sound song almost as fast as he could sing the alphabet. After a week, he amazed us when he sat down on the ground and wrote out the entire alphabet like a 4th grader.  Had NO idea he could write like this!  Shortly thereafter, the 2 year old knew all his letter sounds and letter recognition.

Talking Words Factory:  I was so impressed that I bought them the Talking Words Factory that 2nd week.  I wasn't surprised that my 3 1/2 year old began to spell, writing, and sounding out 3 letter words.  He told me all about how the vowels were all sticky and their job was to stick letters together to make words.  He went around singing the vowel song.

My kids loved the videos so much that for 10 months...My son's (who used to play with Thomas the Trains and puppies) were obsessed with letters and words.  They made their own letter and word factory machines out of their toys and tubs, drew each letter cartoon character, and sang the letter and vowel songs, and the older one wrote, yes wrote, many of his own homemade books.  I knew there might be a problem with this obsession when all his arts and crafts from pre-preschool came home with letters all over them in place of eyes, noses, etc!

Talking Word Factory 2:  It doesn't stop there...They got the Talking Word Factory 2 and Math Circus when they came out this Christmas. In a couple of days, the now 4 year old, was telling me all about sh, ch, th, and other blends.  He told me how the silent e at the end of the word made the other vowel say its name (long vowel sound).  He went on to tell me also how ""when 2 vowels go walking the first one does the talking."" And he wrote and read new complex words such as, boat, home, dime, wait, etc.  This really increased his ability to read many, many new words - 8 letter words too!

Math Circus:  They loved it too!  Though it is fast moving for beginners, it is entertaining and has an easy concept.  Adding and subtracting now comes pretty easy for my 4 year old.  I gave him a math work sheet for addition and subtraction just for kicks.  Wouldn't you know it, he did all of them with no problem. He was so interested in adding that he started asking about problems such as 3 + 3 + 3.  Which helped him learn the concept of multiplication 3 x 3, 3 x 4, etc.  But, we told him that he had plenty of time to learn that later!

The only negative comments that I have to say about these Leap Frog videos:  Nothing, Oh, except that I wish my children weren't so obsessed with letters!  They eat, breath, and sleep letters.  Sometimes I just wish they would play with the trains, cars, and other toys.  They will have their entire school life to learn about letters and reading!  I just hope that when the time comes for school that they won't have grown board of it!

Other Leap Frog learning tools that reinforce what they learned on the videos:

LF Fridge Phonics Magnets - Love it.  It sings each letters song when you put the letter in the hole.

LF Word Whammer Fridge Phonics Set - LF just came out with this.  I know that they will love.  I bought it for the next birthday!  It is like the Fridge Phonics, but you can spell 3 letter words.

LF Letter Factory Board Game - Love it too!  It is interactive and the board game talks and sings!

LF Sing Along Letters Flash Cards & CD - Songs from the DVDs.  Not that you don't hear the songs sang enough from your children!

Wish they would make computer CD's too!

LF Leap Pad - Fun but they got board with the same books over & over.  $14 a book!

There are many others, but I had to draw the line somewhere!

If you check all the other reviews, I am not alone.  Only two out of 121 people gave this movie less than 5 stars!  It is about time someone made a movie that parents and children both agree on!  Thank you Leap Frog!",1112313600,81,4275,4.170134638922889

After watching the Letter Factory DVD for about 10 times, he now knows them all!  In addition, he is beginning to sound the letters and plays with the Fridge Phonics toy a lot more.  The coolest thing is that when we are out somewhere, he will point to a store sign or billboard and yell out the letters he sees.  The DVD is well put together and manages to hold our son's attention.  It's great that it isn't too long since we try to limit his tv time - the show's length works out well during his dinner time.

However, upon arriving at my local(frequently patronized) McDonald's, I found myself agasp at the news delivered by the boy at the register.

He is three and my daughter is two. She is now starting to listen and watch it. I love this tape but couldn't find any more like it in tell one day i pulled it up and found this.

The thing I like about this DVD that's different from the other learning DVD's is that it's set up to look like a real cartoon, not just jumping to A IS FOR APPLE, B IS FOR BUTTERFLY etc. I was skeptical about buying it since none of the other DVD's have worked, nor have the hundreds of alphabet books we own, so I just went ahead and bought the letter factory, talking words factory and word factory 2 along with math circus (wich is nowhere NEAR as good as the other 3). After 1 week of watching this video once a day he learned alot of the alphabet and the letter sounds. As of now, 2wks after purchasing it, he knows all but 4 letters by sight. I also bought the letter factory game to go along with the DVD and to give him time away from TV while still learning his alphabet and the letter sounds. The game is great because it's basic enough for a 2yo to play it but it also has 2 levels for more advance play. On level one you have to find the card color and on level 2 you have to find the actual letter. I HIGHLY recommend this movie AND the letter factory game to go along with it (Kohls.com has an exclusive game tin that I like better than the cardboard box).",1104883200,17,1259,4.142857142857143
1942218,5,B0000EYV7E,"This is one of the best learning DVD's I have seen. It will be a great watch for the Pre-k to first grade classrooms. The DVD teaches the letter names. Most importantly, it teaches the letter sounds in a creative way. Viewers see the letters, hear the letter names, they see a picture/video that represents the sound each letter makes, and the viewer hears a catchy tune to match the letter sound. For instance, the letter C is shown in a cold environment with ice hanging from it. The letter comes to life by shivering and stating that it is /c/ /c/ /c/.... old. Then the characters in the story sing the catchy Leapfrog song; ""The C says/c/, the C says /c/, every letter makes a sound. The C says /c/. This DVD/VHS is marketed towards parents to use with their PreK to First grader, but all teachers need to know about this video and share it with their class. It would be a great review or introduction to letter sounds. Teachers could also use the catchy phrases and visual representation of the letter sounds in their lessons by creating activities or visuals based on the video. Students will see the sounds letters make, hear the sounds, and sing the sounds. This video combined with strong phonics based classroom instruction will help reach a variety of learning styles and lead your students on the path to becoming strong readers.",1104624000,244,1341,4.615062761506276
1942219,5,B0000EYV7E,"Our two-year old daughter loves this video. I highly recommend it.

It's primary strength is introducing the alphabet in a memorable way. But it also introduces basic phonics/letter sounds. She has started to go around the house singing, ""The A says `a', the A says `a'...."" But you will need more than this video to teach all the sounds that letters can make.

As an adult, I found the frog characters and the ""PR"" theme of the main frame story a little annoying. But I think it's a good video for kids.

If your kids see a lot of TV, they might have a different reaction than our daughter did to this video. We don't let her watch a lot of TV unless it's educational for her (studies show TV and rapidly changing video images are not healthy for kids' brain development, especially before age 3).

I had bought this for my four year old son, but he ""can't like it"" now that his sister already did something before him.  This is one to get and start your child on at a young age.

But....we have several other Leap Frog items and our daughter loves them.  So, I bought this DVD for our Daughter for her second birthday.  After the first viewing, my daughter was running through the house pointing and calling out letters.  During the second viewing, she was calling out the next letter in the alphabet as each letter was being shown.

I have only two concerns:

--  Only one sound is taught for letters like C, A, O, E, G etc...a little confusing, but I can deal.

--How to convince family and friends that kids really ENJOY watching this even though it could be perceived as 'flashcardy'.

This is a 'must buy' for toddlers and preschoolers!  And, it has the added bonus of not being too annoying for parents.  We have had this for 3 days and I know I have watched it 15 times.  IT IS GREAT!",1094515200,,936,4.366279069767442

I could not get him to associate the written letter for the letter name.  He would say that A was P or something weird.  I was starting to get worried that he may have a learning disability.  I bought this video and the Talking Word Factory not really expecting much.  Within a week he knew his letters!!!  He is the kind to want to watch a video over and over and since this is educational I did't mind.  Boy did he ever learn from this video.  He now (within a month) knows every letter and letter sound!!!!  I am so proud of him.  I thought there was a real problem but now I see that I just needed a way to put each letter into something interesting and that related to the letter and letter sound.  I can't say enough about these videos.  I thought the Talking words Factory would be a little over his head but he can now say that A E I O U are vowels. Even if he isn't quite sure what vowels are I think it will help when the time comes to learn vowels in school.  He even has been learning about similar sounding words such as bat, cat, mat.  I can't wait to see what the next Leapfrog videos are about.  I hope they will help us with numbers since that is another area we have trouble with.

And many more. Although Dora Explorer was his favorite. And I have gotten him to watch and talk about the other ones. He fell in love with the leap frog family. He asks to watch it every day. Talks about it. Wants to learn his letters. After watching it just a couple times he learned that K is For kick and makes the sound ""K"" and S is for snack and makes the sound ""S"". He started to pick out the letters in the stories we read. And is very excited about the letter sounds.  He will now sit and play with his leap pad system. I purchased the leap frog learn the alphabet booklet. We are on our way learning the alphabet and reading. Thanks Leap pad.  For the number of positive reviews.

I then checked it out on Amazon and was amazed to see that nearly everyone (65+ people) had given it 5 stars. And I can see why! After only owning it for 10 days, My son can recognize nearly every letter of the alphabet, and knows the sounds that half the letters make. He just adores this video and asks for it repeatedly - which is great, because it's educational! The song is very catchy if corny, but we sing it in the car all the time.

She is now 20 months old and can recognize every letter of the alphabet and can pronounce almost every letter of the alphabet...she's stuck on Q, X, and Z.  That's fine with us!  She loves to just open a book and start pronouncing!  She even does it in the car as we're travelling past stores.

By 16 months I could ask her what any letter of the alphabet made and she nailed it each and everytime.  She recently turned 18 months old and can now recognize each letter.  I write them out for her and she can tell me what each letter is.  It is so wonderful to have products like this out.

After just two weeks he can already name and make the sounds for almost all the letters in the alphabet and I have noticed a tremendous improvement in his language development. The video is truely brilliant and so enjoyable that he now asks to watch it everyday. Even better is it coordinates so well with the leap frog refrigerator magnet set- one of his favorite toys.

They truly learned thier letter sounds, which is very crucial in the early reading stage. The songs are catchy and the children love the association to real life, which also helps them remember the letter sounds. Very wonderful video!

Letter Factory makes it easy for toddlers and preschoolers to associate the letters with the sounds. Yesterday we were playing with his letter magnets.

Although I'm not a great fan of the Leap Frog graphics, they do have a catchy way of making you remember all the sounds.  I think my three year eight month old son pretty much memorized all the sounds after watching the video just three or four times.  We followed up with the Word Factory, so now he understands the concept of letters combining phonetically to make words.
It's not one of his favorite videos, but I think that he already learned the lessons to be learned, so it was money well spent.",1084406400,6,590,4.444444444444445

I have a 2 1/2 year old little boy and he adores this. He has asked to watch it 6 times in the 2 days we've had it. The movie has a catchy tune to help remember the letters and each letter has something special to help the kids remember the sound of the letter...for example, the letter ""I"" has Icky stuff dripping down, the letter ""C"" is in a ""cold room""...you get the idea. My son has been talking along with the video as the letters make their sounds! I'm definately happy with this purchase and will get the Word Factory next!",1082937600,,672,4.098484848484849
1942300,5,B0000EYV7E,"I purchased this video for my 3 year old daughter who is beginning to learn her letters.  I was not sure what to expect when I bought it, but I was confident on the quality of Leap Frog products in general.  This video is no exception.  The cartoon features a story which takes the younger of the Frog kids, Tad, through the Letter Factory training rooms where he learns all the sounds the letters make.  Each letter is afforded about a minute of time, which does not seem like much, but with repetition (my daughter asks to see this video several times every day since I purchased it) the children remember more and more of the letters and sounds.  The video is 35 minutes long.  The story is interesting to children and uses a combination of songs and visual prompts to help the kids learn and remember the letters and their sounds.  My daughter was singing along with this video the first time she saw it.  While I don't think this video is enough to teach children their letters, I do think that as part of a learning program it is a wonderful learning tool.  I use the video, then bring out my daughter's My First Leap Pad (I Know My ABC's) for her to use, I help her write the letters on her Magna Doodle, set up art activites for her with the letters, read her ABC books, cut out textured sand paper letters for her to play with, etc.  The only things I found missing in this video are that they only give the short vowel sounds and that they don't talk enough about lower case letters. However it is only a 35 minute video, and I can teach her those other concepts myself.  I also thought they went through the letters a bit fast for kids having trouble with basic letter recognition, but again, it is a short video and parents can always use other techniques to help their children with letter recognition (plus repetitive viewing of the video can help).  Overall, the video serves its purpose very well.  I highly recommend this DVD.  It's interesting enough to hold the children's attention and it teaches useful concepts in a fun way.  I am definitely purchasing the next Leap Frog video (Word Factory) once she learns her letters a little better, so she can start to learn the concept of how letters come together to make words.  Learning happens one step at a time.",1082246400,,2279,4.4423076923076925
1942301,5,B0000EYV7E,"This DVD as well as the companion DVD ""Word Factory"" teaches with simple catchy tunes, mnemonics, visual cues, and audio cues.  Both DVD's address most learning styles.  We have had several parents, who were impressed with our children's knowledge of the alphabet and corresponding phoneics, ask us for the information on these DVD's.  Also, pick up the letter magnets for the 'fridge from Leap Frog.  This is another way to reinforce the cues from the DVD's.
In plain language--these three items will keep your child's attention, help them learn their letters and letter sounds, and won't drive you too crazy!",1082246400,,610,5.07
1942302,5,B0000EYV7E,"I can't recommend this video enough!  My 25 month old now knows all of his letters and the sounds they make.  The video uses innovative ways to get kids to learn the sounds.  For example in the C room the letters are kept c-c-c-cold so that the c's can learn the sound they make.  The L's l-l-l-lick l-l-l-lollipops to learn their sound!
The video only teaches one sound for each letter, but we've paired this with the fridge phonics by leap frog which lists both sounds that some letters make.  My son really enjoys having the tactile letters to play with now that he knows what they are.  And when we are reading to him he asks us what the letters and words say and is making the connection that the letters on the page make the words we read to him.  This is a fantastic and entertaining learning tool.",1081468800,4,805,4.326666666666667

It's great!!!  The only flaw is that the L sounds like an O, I don't understand why they made the sound like that, and the X sound is kind of confusing for kids!

He loves playing with his leap pad, and he also loves watching movies, so I picked up this video and he was telling us what sounds the letters made almost immediately.  It's true that they only teach one sound per letter, but I feel this is less confusing.  Even with one sound per letter, they can still assemble simple words by sounding them out.  Both of my boys watch this video over and over, as well as the Talking Words Factory video, and now not only is the four-year-old starting to put sounds together to make words, but the two-year-old is learning the letter sounds.  The animation and the sonds keep the kids engaged, and each letter has a special trick to help the kids remember their sound.  I find the older one pantomiming each function while he tries to connect sounds.  We've tried other videos and have been less successful.  I'd recommend this video even if your child does not know the alphabet yet, because it teaches the names of the letters along with the sounds.",1081036800,4,1135,4.606965174129353

Plus, as if that wasn't enough, I have noticed he is now showing much more interest in ""reading"" his own books instead of automatically giving them to us to read to him.  Out of any educational toy or video I have bought for him this is, by far, the best and most effective!  If Leapfrog ever comes out with a number video, I will be FIRST in line!

It does a great job at cleverly illustrating and animating each letter in a ""letter themed"" focus- chattering frozen cold C's; vibrating V's, hissing S's in school, karate kicking K's, jumping J's, flying F's... you get the idea. There is also a brief illustration (chalk on chalk board) of how to write each letter as it is covered. I have both the my first leap pad and traditional leap pads for my 3 & 4 yr old boys. I was terribly disappointed that they didn't play with them as much as I thought or hoped they would. However, after getting these videos they have had a lasting burst of renewed interest in both formats of Leap pads because they now recognize and are familar with the leap frog family characters. It has been a very unexpected benefit! It was like they both had an ""Ah-ha!"" moment.

And he's interested in words!  This video is a bit slow for parents, but great for kids.  It teaches correct consonants and short vowel sounds that kids can put together to make words (as opposed to many videos that inadvertently add vowel sounds after the consonants).",1077840000,,568,4.529411764705882

She was never much interested in doing flashcards or letter sound games--her attention span and patience would only go so far.  After just two weeks of watching this DVD daily, she knows and recognizes the entire alphabet, knows the hard sound for each letter and can figure out the first letter of a word by herself.  It has bridged the gap between what I wanted her to learn before Kindergarten and what she was willing to put up with.  She is now beginning to sound words out on her own and we are moving on to the Word Factory DVD.  I Highly recommend this DVD!! It is entertaining to kids and the sing-song sounds the letters ""learn"" to make in the factory really help them remember.  Kudos to Leap Frog.",1077580800,,760,4.431654676258993
1942333,5,B0000EYV7E,"This video has been educational and entertaining for my 2 year old.  She remembers the songs and repeats the letter sounds.

1942334,5,B0000EYV7E,"I expected my 3-year-old son to enjoy this show and learn from it (which he does), but I didn't expect my 15-month-old son to be equally riveted.
The plot progresses by repeating a course of events for each letter: the characters enter a letter training room where the anthropomorphized letters are engaging in an activity that corresponds to their sound (the letter 'R' is making the 'rrrrrr' sound and Racing around a track), the letter is drawn on a small chalkboard (which you can purchase cheaply at any craft store so your child can draw along with the `professor'), and there is a song, ""The 'A' says, 'ahhh'..."" that highlights the sound of each letter. This sequence repeats for each letter, but the there is also a larger storyline that overarches the introduction to the letter sounds. Quite wonderful!!
My 3-year-old loves to watch the movie and then act it out. Just the other day, he wanted to play the part of the professor, so he sang the song for each letter, ""The `B' says..."". He would pause, expecting me to fill in the blank with the correct sound. Much to my surprise (and delight), my 15-month-old piped in with the correct sound for each letter!! I didn't expect this dvd to be that effective!
If you are going to watch movies with your young ones, I highly recommend this one.
Only one criticism: unlike some other Leapfrog products, like the Imagination Desk, this movie only covers a single sound for each letter. The long vowel sounds and the soft consonant sounds are left out.",1077148800,3,1506,4.686792452830189

This one is amazing though, she asks to watch it or puts it in herself, she would watch it all day if I let her.  We have only owned it a week and I know she already recognizes and knows the sounds of at least a half dozen letters.  Not only that but she tries to remember and say all the letters and their sounds, including the sound for letters like ""L"" which she has been doing in speech therapy for 6 months and I hadn't once heard her try until yesterday (and she had been out of school/speech for 9 days b/c of the ice storm).
I highly recommend it, we are going to buy and try the word factory too after she masters more of these letters.",1075680000,,842,4.115853658536586
1942349,5,B0000EYV7E,"My 3 year old watched this video 2 times and immediately started recognizing letter sounds. Now he goes around sounding out letters on t-shirts, books signs, etc.  We had tried other techniques before like flashcards but nothing worked as great as this video.  I would also highly recommend the Word Factory also.",1074729600,,313,5.0
1942350,5,B0000EYV7E,"My son is 18 months old.  A week after he started watching this DVD, he started saying the sounds to letters, A, B, D, H, I, M, Z!  He really loves it, and my son is so picky about what he watches!  Hats off to Leap Frog! Again!",1074643200,,228,3.7083333333333335
1942351,5,B0000EYV7E,"I have two little boys, age 4 1/2 and 18 months, who have been recieving Leapfrog toys from my mother-in-law since they were infants, and they always seem to be the toys that get the most play time.  So when my husband saw the ""Letter Factory"" and ""Word Factory"" DVD's and suggested that maybe Santa should bring them to us for Christmas, I figured they might be worth trying.  I was totally unprepared for the effect these DVD's have had, and continue to have on my sons, especially the 4 year old.  We have been trying here and there over the last year to get him interested in the alphabet, but he was always too busy with other things to really get into it.  We stuck this DVD into the player on Christmas day and have played it at least once a day since, and both of my boys are glued for the entire 30 minutes every time it is on.
Here is the reason I am so impressed, and therefore writing this review:  My four year old walked up to me just now, looked at my shirt and informed me of every letter printed on it, AND what the letter sounds like, AND a list of words that start with the letter mentioned, without difficulty.  There were 15 different letters.
WOW.
This is all a result of the Word Factory and Letter Factory DVD's, and we have had them for less than a month.
The creators behind this DVD set are brilliant to say the least.  They somehow seem to know just what goes on inside preschoolers heads.  The characters and songs are cute without being ""cutesy"" and they somehow manage to repeat each letter or word and its sound several times without being redundant.  The main adult character, Professor Quigley, teaches the three siblings, Leap, Lily and Tad, by helping them complete a project.  The kids learn by working alongside the professor, as opposed to being talked down to or simply lectured to.  And because of that they feel like they are really accomplishing something.  All of this is done in such a subtle way that I had to sit down and watch it all the way through to figure out exactly why it is so effective.  Simply put, when my 4 year old watches this, he sees that the kids are the ones accomplishing the goal and reaping the benefits and not just watching the grown-ups do everything fun and exciting.  Once again, whoever created these DVD's knows how to get (and keep) the attention of preschoolers, which is a pretty tough thing to do.
Obviously, my 18 month old is too young to grasp the structure  and objective of these DVD's, but he is just as entranced with them as my oldest, which says alot for a toddler just begining to speak is first coherent words.  I am looking forward to seeing how quickly he starts putting the concepts together the way my 4 year old has.
My only dissapointment with these DVD's is that they didn't come out a year ago!  Way to go, Leapfrog!!!  I hope to see more educational DVD's in the near future.",1074211200,7,2875,4.382297551789077
1942352,5,B0000EYV7E,"""Santa"" got this for my 2 1/2 year old daughter this year. She watched it non-stop for a week! It really taught her the sounds of letters and letter recognition! They have a little song for each letter and she sings them all of the time. During the past 3 weeks she has started to learn how to tell me what letter a word starts with and is now writing her letters! This would be a wonderful learning tool for any child!",1073952000,,419,4.121951219512195

Home school moms...this is a must!",1073779200,,321,4.0476190476190474
1942354,5,B0000EYV7E,"I put this on my 2 year old sons holiday wish list. I'm so glad that his grandparents bought it for him. This is an excellent video. He loves it! He tries to copy the sounds the letters make and is getting better everytime he watches it. The cartoon is enjoyable to watch, and is not annoying to parents as background noise like some other videos. It's a decent length and keeps my sons attention for the whole time; which allows me to get dinner ready or pick up the house. I plan on buying more of the leap frog dvds soon. This one is great!!",1073520000,,544,4.1415094339622645
