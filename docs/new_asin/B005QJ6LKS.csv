4859105,4,B005QJ6LKS,"Against the wishes of her upper class parents (Wilfrid Hyde White, Fay Compton), a girl (Maureen O'Hara) marries an impoverished painter (Dana Andrews) and moves to the slums. But the marriage is an unhappy one, due partly to the husband's alcoholism. But when he dies suspiciously, she becomes a victim of blackmail by the local hag (Dame Sybil Thorndike). Based on the novel by Margery Sharp (CLUNY BROWN), the first part of the film appears to be veering towards a dark noir-ish tale but with the appearance of a drunk ex-actor (also played by Dana Andrews), it turns into a soapy melodrama and becomes less interesting. As the painter, Andrews is dubbed by a British actor but as the ex-actor, he uses his own voice and an inadequate English accent. The most intriguing aspect of the second half of the film is that O'Hara and Andrews are living together without benefit of matrimony but passing themselves off as a married couple. Surely, quite daring for 1949. It's wonderful to see Dame Sybil in a decent film role which allows her to display her legendary acting talent, her Medusa harridan will make your skin crawl. Nimbly directed by Jean Negulesco (THREE COINS IN THE FOUNTAIN). With Anthony Tancred and Diane Hart.

The Fox MOD DVDr is a decent transfer is a little on the darkish side. A little clean up wouldn't hurt.",1354579200,8,1332,4.766233766233766
4859106,3,B005QJ6LKS,"Intriguing story with some good acting.  Maureen O'Hara
looks beautiful and Dana Andrews is good as usual but
it's Sybil Thorndike who steals the whole show.  The
plot is not very credible.  Good video quality.",1352505600,5,210,4.942857142857143
4859107,5,B005QJ6LKS,"This movie was produced in 1949 in England. It's based on a book by a well known British author, Margery Sharp entitled ""Britannia Mews"" and the movie originally had this same title. I remembered seeing it as a teen in UK and never forgot it, Dana Andrews being one of my favourite actors.
I'm so pleased to see it back in print after not being able to find a decent copy for years. It is a black and white movie with an excellent cast and Maureen OHara, [as beautiful as ever], and Dana Andrews appear to thoroughly enjoy working together. This is the only film I can think of where Dana Andrews has the opportunity to show an under rated comedic side of his acting abilities.
He plays a dual role and the dubbed British accent is slightly distracting in the beginning, because he has such a well known voice, but the dubbing is excellent, so it becomes less noticeable and is necessary to the plot. When he plays the second character, his own voice is used.
The movie is the story of a young girl from a well to do family, who loves to watch life in the slum of Britannia Mews from her widow. She falls in love with her art teacher, who lives in the Mews because of income restraints. She brushes aside his confession of a drinking problem and marries him anyway. [Andrews does an excellent portrayal of a drunk, ironic considering his later illness.]
They move into the Mews and ultimately their relationship is affected by his drinking. She is blackmailed by ""The Sow"" also a tenant of the Mews, played by Dame Sybil Thorndike, after an accident.
Later, Dana Andrews turns up in the second role, as yet another man with a drinking problem, and the story progresses from there. No further details....don't want to spoil the plot for you.",1351123200,24,1740,4.5094936708860756
4859108,4,B005QJ6LKS,"Like my Review for ""Mask of Dimitrios"" I waited forever to find this old film Noire on DVD.
 I could not find it for viewing anywhere.
I remember seeing this movie on TV as a child in the 50s! Here is a link to a TCM overview [...]
I remembered it as ""Britannia Mews"".  Very dark at times, but an amazing story.",1415059200,,311,4.0
4859109,4,B005QJ6LKS,"Based on the Margery Sharp novel ""Brittania Mews"", the movie is most interesting for a chance to see Dana Andrews in a different kind of role.  Here he plays dual characters and does a little more acting than he usually gets the chance to do in most his noir roles.  The story takes some odd turns that make it at times dramatic, comedic, thriller, and romance.  It does make the story a little disjointed but for the most part it holds interest and is fairly entertaining.",1410912000,,473,4.476744186046512
4859110,2,B005QJ6LKS,Okay image quality but not a very satisfying film. I like Dana Andrews who plays two characters in the story but one of the characters is dubbed by another actor which was both annoying and ridiculous. My advice: forget it.,1410566400,,223,4.6

4859113,5,B005QJ6LKS,"Mainly bought this movie because it starred Dana Andrews (one of my favorites). Has a good storyline - drama, romance, and a little comedy thrown in. Highly recommended - especially for Dana Andrews fans out there. Even though it has several conflicts throughout the movie, it still has a happy ending. :)",1387238400,3,305,4.884615384615385
4859114,5,B005QJ6LKS,"I love this movie. not sure why, but I do. it's an interesting story, and I love Maureen o'hara and dana Andrews. I liked it so much I watched it a few times (fox seems to repeat movies for a while) and am happy I finally found it on dvd. I found an old copy of the book here on amazon, and bought it. the story goes on, further than the movie. if you like the movie, see if you can get the book.",1379980800,4,396,3.7261904761904763
4859115,3,B005QJ6LKS,"Amazon's part in delivering, speed and packaging, was as usual very good. The product was a poor choice for me as I never enjoyed the story line and did not consider the acting anything but mediocre.",1372723200,2,199,4.555555555555555

8483493,4,B005QJ6LKS,The oddest movie I've ever seen. Maureen O'Hara in.  But interesting all the same.,1455235200,,82,4.857142857142857
8483494,5,B005QJ6LKS,"As a big fan of Dana Andrews who stars in many of my favorite pictures including Laura the best film noir ever made and this one is very
good but the voice of Dana Andrews seems to be the dubbed version by an English actor because studio felt his british accent was so
bad but this is horrible and ruins the beginning of the movie. If it is Andrews voice it is pretty bad but it doesn't seem to be his own.
 When he plays the 2nd part as her new husband his voice is obviously his own and makes the rest of the movie watchable. Andrews puts in a great performance but O'Hara just seems miscast. The movie itself is a lost gem for Andrews and film noir and period movie fans. The quality is not remastered but good not great quality at times but well worth having in your collection.",1451952000,,782,4.144736842105263
8483495,5,B005QJ6LKS,"This is a dark movie but has a wonderful happy ending. I knew the movie when it was titled Britannia Muse (sp?) but I took a chance and ordered it because I thought surely Maureen O'Hara and Dana Andrews didn't do 2 movies together with the same plot!  Anyways, glad I took the chance.  The movie is exactly how I remembered it.  Product arrived in great condition and before the expected delivery date.",1440374400,,403,4.493150684931507

8483499,5,B005QJ6LKS,Anything Maureen O'Hara is in is wonderful.  The character she plays is competely different from other rolls.  I loved Dana Andrews in duel roles. It was a great picture.
