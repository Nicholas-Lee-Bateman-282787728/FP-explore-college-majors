This is an excellent video by a knowledgable presenter, a British psychiatist.
I have ordered three copies ostensibly in NTSC rather than PAL format because I want to share them with friends and relatives. The DVDs play OK on all three of my  computers and I have tried them on three different DVD players without success. In each case ( 9 tries: 3 discs X 3 players) I get an error messge like ""Incorrect Disc.""  My guess is that they have been refomatted from British PAL to American NTSC and the Video portion converted correctly but the Header did not. The DVD players apparently read the header and give up.",1332374400,,848,5.934426229508197
