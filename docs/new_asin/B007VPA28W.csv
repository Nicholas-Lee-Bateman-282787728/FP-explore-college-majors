Anni takes you through different segments, each one targeting a different muscle group, but ALL of them keep your heart rate up and the cardio factor going.  The exercises are 1 minute in length, which doesn't seem like a lot but is a long time when you're doing some of the more intense moves.  This works your entire body and can also be broken down into shorter segments if you need to save time.  This is definitely an advanced workout, but well worth it.  I am a devoted fan of Cathe Friedrich's workouts, and no one usually challenges me as much as her, but this one did.  I dread doing it, but only because it is so challenging, which is what makes it so effective!  Great routine, challenging to your heart, but simple choreography and good cuing.  She doesn't mess around that's for sure.",1407110400,,883,4.368098159509202

8522261,5,B007VPA28W,"Excellent 15 min, workouts in 4 sections- Upper, Lower, Core & Full Body. Anni certainly gets your heart rate up & your muscles to move with static + plyometric exercises!",1385337600,,171,4.733333333333333
8522262,4,B007VPA28W,"This is truly a ""fierce"" and advanced workout indeed! Strength training and cardio at a fast pace!
I was able to do all four segments; however, I had to modify quite a bit, sometimes not finishing all reps. With that said, I found my way and made some changes with some of her exercise moves. And that is why I am giving this workout 4 stars instead of 5. It is a workout that you will be proud to say that you accomplished it!",1366675200,,427,4.095238095238095
8522263,4,B007VPA28W,"I think this is a great muscle training video! It's quick and affective. I burnt about 350 calories doing a 30 minutes session.

My only complaint is that the background is a  boring and the music may kit even exist.",1362009600,,216,4.375
8522264,5,B007VPA28W,I considered myself very active person.  I purchased this video with the notion that it would be a high intensity workout.  I was not disappointed. It was worth the purchase.,1352937600,,174,4.766666666666667
8522265,5,B007VPA28W,"Anni Mairs has done it again!

Every time I think I'm ready for something tougher, it seems like she's waiting in wings ready to lay the smackdown on me.  I was finally able to get through her Cardio Force workout without huffing and puffing too badly (I still sweat like a pig, but I'm not so out of breath that I can't carry on a conversation), so I figured I was ready to kick it up a notch.  NOT!  The first time out, I was only able to get through the first segment of the workout, which is only about 15 minutes.  It's that tough!  My quads, glutes and hamstrings were sore for two days, and I was using lighter weights than she was.  Second time out I got through two segments, and was again sore for several days.

She starts with about a five minute warm up, and if you're new to working out, the warm up will be tough (in which case you have absolutely no business attempting this workout!).  The warm up is followed by three targeted segments, focusing on the lower body, upper, and abs.  The fourth segment is a total body workout.  Unless you're super, super fit, I don't recommend doing the whole thing at once.  It wraps up nicely with just about the longest cool down I've ever seen in a workout video.  I was pleased with this, because cool-downs generally seem like afterthoughts in other programs, a quick 2-3 minutes just so they can say they put one in.

The best thing about this workout is that I can pretend I'm not doing cardio, which is not my favorite type of workout.  I much prefer strength training, which is what I tell myself I'm doing with Fierce Force, only at a much faster pace than I'm used to.

My only consolation is that at the end of the workout, Anni was looking slightly flushed and breathing a little hard.",1352073600,6,1750,4.322085889570552
