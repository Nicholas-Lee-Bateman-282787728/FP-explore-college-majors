8568299,5,B00BGQWM3U,"""Germanin"" lays-out a sadly-tragic series of events in which German disease researcher Achenbach studies and eventually discovers a cure to the acutely-deadly ""sleeping sickness"" based on his research of the perfidious tse-tse fly. The symptoms ans suffering of one with sleeping sickness is nothing short of nightmarish, which makes British interference of its research an act of the lowest form of humanity. So implementing said cure ended-up being far easier said than done.

The time is during WWI, which of course pitted England versus Germany. When the Versailles Treaty was signed and the international cabal of khazar-jewish bankers had completed their betrayal of Germany -- beginning with their involvement of the USA in the late stages of the war -- the near-victorious nation was subject to far more than just crushing economic starvation on the home front, they also suffered indignity at the hands of England abroad. After Achenbach's base of research is destroyed by British terrorists under orders from their royal masters, Achenbach is forced to  start practically from square one back in Germany. During Achenbach's time in Africa, he came across game hunter Hans Hofer, himself an out of work doctor. Hofer (played by German cinema favorite Luis Trenker) takes the bold and reckless step of infecting himself with tse-tse fly bites in Achebach's German laboratory, but it is in the aftermath that the cure is proven.

Eventually, Achenbach receives permission to return to Africa to finally implement his cure to the endless peoples devastated by its spread. Naturally, the English continue on their same path by hounding Achenbach almost every step of the way, especially when it comes to attacking the source of the tse tse fly: its hatching grounds in riverbeds.

""Germanin"" is a must-see not only for historical importance and interest, but also for anyone interested in ground-roots disease research. It is an extremely heroic deed achieved by German researchers at the very source of a horrific epidemic. The film's production values are a high quality, as the story never drags, but also doesn't gloss-over the momentous points. One reason why this film is not as popular as it should be, is that it highlights an act of selfless bravery on the part of German scientists who risked everything time and again for the continent of Africa. That's right, disease researchers from the undying ""aryan racist"" nation of Germany did that for the people of Africa. Funny how history books seem to leave that out, isn't it?",1461024000,,2539,5.155339805825243

8568302,3,B00BGQWM3U,"I watched GERMANIN: THE STORY OF A COLONIAL DEED out of sheer curiosity. I've been exploring Nazi-era cinema at some length this year, and have generally found it to be much more subtle thematically, better written and better acted than I would have expected. Shot at the height of WW2, this movie can be excused for its propagandistic and anti-British themes, and represents a solid of unspectacular UFA studios release which perhaps belies George Orwell's assertion that no art of any value can be produced under a dictatorship.

GERMANIN begins in 1914 in a German colony in Africa. A resolute German physician (Peter Petersen) and his lovely assistant (Lotte Koch) are working on a cure to the dreaded, fly-borne disease of sleeping sickness, which is decimating the population. When war breaks out, the British attack his isolated research outpost, forcing a friendly trapper (Luis Trenker) to flee to Germany with the doctor's research. After Germany's collapse, the three reunite in Berlin to continue the fight against the disease, only to face bureaucratic obstacles set in their path by the British and by the Bayer corporation. After an act of heroism by the trapper, which proves the doctor's formula is effective, Bayer gets on board and the British reluctantly allow the trio to return to their former colony to bring the ""Germanin"" formula to the masses: it's only then that the true extend of British perfidy is revealed, and our three heroes must fight both a scheming British officer (Albert Lippert) and the disease itself in order to see that justice is done for the people of Africa.

GERMANIN is a film somewhat typical of the period in which it was shot and to some extent, the government which authorized its production. The idea of European colonization of Africa is accepted on its face as a beneficent enterprise: the Germans bringing modern medicine and technology to well-meaning savages (whose customs are depicted in great detail, with a huge cast of black people which includes the German-speaking black actor Louis Brody). At the same time, the loss of the colonies after Versailles is depicted as a national humiliation, doubly so because the rationale for stripping them from Germany was Germany's ""moral unworthiness"" to guide the local populace to civilization: yet the morally ""superior"" England is shown deliberately interfering with the distribution of ""Germanin"" in favor of an inferior American medicine, to the detriment of the natives. And the Germans themselves are depicted as ethical, manly and heroic (if they are men) and sexy and stalwart (if they are Lotte Koch). By today's standards the film is clumsy, obvious and deeply racist (in a strangely well-meaning way) but American and British films of the same era are no different, and as far as the British characters are depicted, the script actually allows for more character development from the British antagonist than would have been granted to a German in an ""Allied"" film of the same time.

As entertainment, GERMANIN does the job without exceeding expectations. The acting is quite good, and there are a few interesting twists to the story and some first-class villainy on the part of Col. Crosby, the bad-guy Englishman, such as when he destroys all the Germanin out of spite. (Lotte Koch is really a sight, too.) Technically the film is pretty sophisticated, and director Max Kimmich (Goebbels' brother-in-law) does his job with professionalism and some obvious gusto.  I'm not sure where the exteriors were actually shot, but the locations look African to me and I suppose it's not impossible some of it was filmed there during the period when the Axis had a large foothold on ""the black continent."" The camerawork is more mobile than many films of its time period (1943) and the use of stock footage of  chimpanzees, snakes, cheetahs, waterfalls, jungles, swamps, etc. is less obtrusive than you might imagine. The weaknesses are a lack of character development (everyone is pretty much fully formed at the beginning of the movie and stays the same all film through, except for Col. Crosby), uneven pacing, and a somewhat anticlimactic ending. We are continuously told that curing the sickness is only half the battle, that exterminating the tsetse fly is the real answer, and that the British stand in the way, but there is never an explanation as to how this might be done even if the Brits don't interfere -- especially by a band of 3 Germans with some native helpers.

All in all I'd say this is a decent but not a great film, entertaining without being riveting and enjoyable without being truly resonant. I'd recommend it for fans of 40s-era movies, adventure cinema, and those curious about what going to a movie in Nazi Germany would have been like.",1410480000,3,4769,5.0
