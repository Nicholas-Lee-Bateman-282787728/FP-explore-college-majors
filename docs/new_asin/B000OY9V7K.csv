2802780,5,B000OY9V7K,"Now this is a truly good choice. Can't wait for the release date. Wow.

All 40 Birdman cartoons, and 20 Galaxy Trio cartoons presented as complete shows. For years we've laughed at the way ""Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law"" poked fun at this show. Now we can see the original Super Hero action that inspired it all.

Semi-regularly, throughout the series, you'll see winged Super-hero Birdman gain powers from the sun's energy, and  take on F.E.A.R., a criminal organization which sometimes does its own dirty work, and sometimes employs super villains like Nitron, Dr Freezoid and Murko the Marauder.

Unique to the time (1967), they introduced a new character ""Birdboy"" in the later Birdman episodes, and developed him well, as he assisted Birdman in return conflicts with Birdman's old foes like Dr Millenium and Vulturo.

The Galaxy Trio stories are a fantastic outer space sci-fi Super-hero concept. Meteor Man (an elastic enlargeable hero), Vapor Man (who can turn into various gasses, as well as fire them from his hands), and Gravity Girl (who can reduce or increase gravity) fly through space in their ship Condor 1, defeating many foes. In particular, the music used in ""Space Slaves"" and ""Peril of the Prison Planet"" will make me keen to play them again and again.

LET'S HOPE THEY REPEAT THIS GREAT IDEA THEY'VE DONE, BY RELEASING THE 1972 ""SEALAB 2020"" SERIES which inspired the more recent satire ""Sealab 2021"".",1175472000,31,1424,4.987341772151899
2802781,5,B000OY9V7K,"Fascinating Hanna Barbera series.  As a 1960's kid-watcher, I learned to love all HB cartoons.  Now much older, I am still impressed with the stylistic features of these cartoons.  The hidden gem in this series is the ""Galaxy Trio"" wedged between two episodes of Birdman.  I admit that I am a collector and have almost all of the HB DVDs.  But this one is certainly unique among all.",1481328000,,383,4.573529411764706

Of course the comedy relief of Wacky Races, The Perils of Penelope Pitstop (BTW, does anybody else wonder why our dear Penny couldn't figure out that her guardian, Sylvester Sneakly, wasn't The Hooded Claw, especially since he wears those silly glasses on the end of his nose, EVEN WITH HIS MASK ON?

2802844,4,B000OY9V7K,"'Birdman & the Galaxy Trio' was the product of legendary cartoonist and comic book artist Alex Toth, in order for Hanna-Barabera to expand on its superhero line for the Saturday morning slot for kids, in response to contemporary shows like Marvel's 'The Fantastic Four' and Filmation's take on DC Comic's' Justice League (which would later be picked up by HB for its 'Super Friends' franchise).
The twenty episode series ran from September 1967 to September 1969 on NBC, with the titular character of Birdman being voiced by Keith Andes (who tragically took his own life in 2005).  Birdman is in fact a man named Ray Randall who was granted solar-based powers from the Egyptian Sun-God Ra.  As such, he is able to create solar blasts from his hands,  project a solar shield to repel enemy attacks, and can fly due to having natural feathered wings protruding from his back.  The only flaw that Birdman possesses is having to recharge his solar-based powers by being energised by the sun's rays on a regular basis, which presents a problem when super-villains, such as Morto, Dr Millennium, the Duplicator and Mentok the Mind-Taker, amongst others, deploy their evil schemes under the cover of darkness.  Towards the end of the series, Birdman is aided by a young boy that he rescues from a shipwreck, who he names Birdboy after passing on some of his powers onto via a transfusion, and along with his government liaison Falcon 7, they are assigned to protect their home-town of Central City from their specially designed Bird-Lair.
Each episode of 'Birdman and the Galaxy Trio' is presented in three parts, with two Birdman shorts lasting approximately eight minutes each, with a segment starring the Galaxy Trio being sandwiched in-between, making each full episode having a total running time of about twenty-four to thirty minutes.
Regarding the Galaxy Trio, their adventures take place in a futuristic Star Trek-esque setting, where the Intergalactic Police patrols space, attempting to thwart invading forces on unsuspecting planets.  The team consists of Vapour Man, who can turn into any gaseous form, Meteor Man, who can enhance his growth cells to enlarge any part of his body, and Gravity girl, a princess from the planet Gravitas who can utilise gravity force to fly and suspend enemies in mid-air.  Together, they form a formidable fighting force that protects civilisations from certain take-over, such as protecting the planet Aqueous from its rightful king 's evil power-hungry brother, and stopping the robotic Computron from turning his humanoid creators into robot slaves.
'Birdman & the Galaxy Trio - The Complete Series', distributed by Warner Home Video for the Region 1 market during July 2007 under its 'Hanna-Barbera Classics Collection' banner, has a total running time of 420 minutes.  That's seven complete hours of golden-age animation fun, containing all twenty episodes over two double-sided discs, with five episodes presented on each side.  There is some lovely artwork depicted on the set's packaging, which is a cardboard sleeve fold-out tucked into an outer casing, indicative of Warner Bros' distributed animation DVD packages from the Hanna-Barbera studios and Filmation, amongst others.  On the DVDs themselves, menus are presented with some more clean-cut artwork with an episode selection option, as well as being able to play all, with the added choice to view episodes with subtitles for the English hard-of-hearing.  The picture quality is sometimes a little grainy, although for the most part, this cartoon from the late-sixties holds up pretty well.  Regarding special features, there isn't really a lot to bulk up the collection apart from a mini-featurette looking at Alex Toth's original contribution to the series, lasting approximately ten minutes or so, along with some trailers which advertise other golden-age animated series on DVD.
Birdman and the Galaxy Trio teamed up once in the 'Hanna-Barbera TV Superheroes' comic book series, with our titular hero also having a one-time appearance in Cartoon Network's Toonami comic series, published by DC Comic's some time later. The character of Birdman would later be used, almost three decades later after the original show, as a guest star on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim series 'Space Ghost: Coast to Coast', appearing as an unemployed superhero looking for work.  Following the popularity of this series, Birdman subsequently starred in his own Adult Swim production, along with his supporting cast members, in the popular adult-oriented series 'Harvey Birdman - Attorney at Law'.  In this series, he offered his services in representing fellow Hanna-Barbera characters in a court of law, having completed an online law degree after giving up his crime-fighting career.
All in all, 'Birdman & the Galaxy Trio' is recommended for all classic animation enthusiasts, as well as those who were brought up watching similar shows, such as the Super Friends, along with people who have an affinity towards superheroes in general.  The stories can definitely seem repetitive at times and the narration of action can be somewhat expressed as a form of televisual radio.  However, if you don't take the premise too seriously, the characters definitely come alive with Hanna-Barbera's classic animated charm that the studio is historically famous for.
Additionally, it is most definitely worth exploring Hanna-Barbera's sister superhero creations, such as 'Space Ghost & Dino Boy' and 'The Herculoids', amongst others, as well as Adult Swim's 'Harvey Birdman - Attorney At Law'; all currently available for purchase on DVD.",1402617600,5,5615,5.278026905829597

Keith Andes is the mysterious Bird Man who has solar powers and has bird wings. With the aid of his super eagle Avenger they protect the near future Earth from perils both mundane and bizarre. We get no history on Birdman so have worked up a background story. Genetically created super soldier that originally fought vampires. Avenger is a line of GMO living  weapons. They are linked.

It has the classic  Hanna-Barbera style, which compared to current cartoons, is certainly less violent.  And for an old-timer like me, I dig the Jazzy music playing in the background.  It is also cool that Birdman's powers come from the sun; kind of a nod to solar energy before its time.  I highly recommend purchasing it for your youngster",1387497600,,455,4.421686746987952

Until the new age cartoons that appeared in the 80s and 90s that, these were it, the best superhero cartoons available.  Only thing I would have found to complete this collection would have been better special features, Space Ghost had a nice one and Herculoids had a good one as well but Birdman left me with something to be desired.

2802885,4,B000OY9V7K,"BIIIIIIIIIIRD MAAAN!!! Now here's a cartoon from a time when they were made just to entertain. When you look at cartoons nowadays, most of what you see is merchandising meant to indoctrinate your child into buying some toy or accessory. The occasional moral lesson notwithstanding, Bird Man & the Galaxy Trio was an action-packed straight to the point adventure show with stories told simply to amuse. No hidden agenda. No toy merchandising. What you see is what you get.

Granted it was from a time when cartoons were not CGI animated, but I personally find the technique and its defects charming. If you're looking for uncompromising entertainment for yourself and your kids, this package is a good bet. The 2 double sided DVD's are packed with shows. Each show includes 2 Bird Man episodes to each Galaxy Trio one, making up 40 of the one and 20 of the other. Given the objectiveness of the storytelling, the plots are not at all complex so that children may understand them, though they are intelligent so that adults may appreciate them. Fuzzy villains and vintage robots make-up most of the bad guys, which are simple and stereotypical on the surface to allow a short episode, but which also contain enough profile hints for your imagination to work-out a deeper profile for them.

The same is untrue of the hero - Bird Man - who is never developed beyond the super hero identity. His civilian alter-ego is never revealed, which gives the impression that Bird Man was a full-time agent of a secret global governmental organisation. His background is never explored in the series and the origin of his powers is only briefly alluded to Ra - the Egiptian Sun god - which lends itself nicely to the nature of Bird Man's powers. Aside from his bird wings and his fantastic eagle sidekick, Avenger, Bird Man is a nuclear battery. He absorbs radiation from the Sun (and/or from nuclear reactors) and uses that power to boost physical strength and endurance. He also constantly displays the ability to shoot solar rays from his fists and projects quaint solar shields to defend himself against attacks. Cool. His weakness is also always exploited by villains, who draw Bird Man away from the sunlight to drain his power.

If you're familiar with Bird Man, this package will bring you memories. If not, this is a good chance to meet the character. For the price you're paying, this package is well worth it. Enjoy!",1319500800,2,2412,4.793269230769231

2802888,4,B000OY9V7K,"Superhero cartoons were quite the rage in the mid 1960's.  Birdman And The Galaxy Trio (1967-69) was intended to entertain kids, and not meant to be taken very seriously.  With the space race fueling the interest in space exploration, these light and frivolous science fantasy adventures, center on the basic theme of good versus evil.

Birdman And The Galaxy Trio was designed by Alex Toth, who also worked on the cartoons Space Ghost, and The Herculoids.  These Hanna-Barbera cartoons are rather similar, science fiction or fantasy based, with the heroes typically battling super powered villains, strange monsters, aliens, and robots.  Birdman is based on Earth, and along with his eagle Avenger, tangles with assorted criminals, and fights to protect America from whatever threats may arise.  The Galaxy Trio, deal with a variety of weird and wacky alien beings, as they travel in the spaceship Condor One.  Each episode features two Birdman adventures, with a Galaxy Trio story in between.

Birdman (voiced by Keith Andes), is headquarted inside a hollow volcano, and usually gets his missions via video messages from his superior Falcon 7 (voiced by Don Messick).  True to his name, Birdman has wings on his back, and usually utters the cry `Birdman!!' when he takes fight from his bird lair.  Birdman gains his powers from exposure to solar rays, and can fire solar ray beams from his hands, and can also create a solar shield, to deflect projectiles and other threats.  Deprived of sunlight, Birdman's strength begins to drain away.  Avenger proves to be a worthy partner, and an able fighter, saving Birdman's life many times.  Together, they are a tough and well coordinated fighting team.

Birdman faces a variety of opponents, some human, and some alien, who usually want cash, have schemes for conquest, or have plans for Birdman's demise.  He often faces the agents of F.E.A.R., an organization dedicated to evil deeds.  The stories are not very subtle or complicated, and usually feature plenty of action and fighting.  With usually only Avenger as a companion, Birdman does a lot of talking to himself, in a loud, dramatic fashion, usually pointing out the obvious.  He is quite prone to getting in trouble, usually from being deprived of sunlight.  Exactly why a guy with wings, needs to wear a mask to hide his identity, is something of a mystery.  Birdman usually succeeds in stopping the evil schemes, but villains often escape capture.  Later, the character Birdboy is added, serving as an occasional sidekick.

The Galaxy Trio's adventures typically take place on various alien worlds, and are usually complete fantasies, featuring a variety of weird alien lifeforms, who remarkably, all speak English.  The trio consists of Vapor Man (voiced by Don Messick), Gravity Girl (voiced by Virginia Eiler) and Meteor Man (voiced by Ted Cassidy, Lurch on The Addams Family).  The trio each have specialized powers, when combined make a formidable team.  Similar to Space Ghost, The Galaxy Trio is best enjoyed as a futuristic space fantasy.

Birdman And The Galaxy Trio, features familiar vocal talents of the day like Vic Perrin, Hal Smith, Henry Corden, Mike Road,and John Stephenson.  The series had some pretty cool musical themes, but also utilized musical cues from Hanna-Barbera's library, that were also featured in other Hanna-Barbera productions, like Jonny Quest and Space Ghost.

The image quality is very good for a classic 60's cartoon.  The quality of the animation is very good for the era.  Being mostly fantasy adventures, the stories are about as relevant now, as they were then.  This is light, mindless entertainment, with low educational value, but a high fun factor.  If the violence is not an issue, then kids may be amused by the constant parade of strange and exotic characters.  A short, but informative featurette,  'Birdman: The Forgotten Hero"", pays tribute to animator and artist, Alex Toth.  The set has two double sided discs with all twenty episodes of this exciting series.",1268438400,3,4023,5.099388379204893

2802900,4,B000OY9V7K,"This is my first review for Amazon.com so please bear with me and enjoy!

I  watched this show as a kid over at a friend's house that had cable.  I was instantly sucked into this show.  It was full of action and adventure and even thought I was older and maybe ""too old"" for cartoons it was AMAZING!!!  By the time we watched the episode my younger friend and I were saying ""Biiiiiiirdman!' and ""Biiiiiiiiiirdboy!""  all day.

I came across  the DVD when I was randomly searching for items to buy on Amazon and  knew then and there I had to buy it.  I was a little iffy about it after buying some old cartoons that were not as good watching the second time around once the wonder of childhood is gone.  Boy was I wrong!  I was saying ""Biiiiiiirdman!"" every day until it got here and I watched it disc at a time until I finished it.  Amazing stuff here.  BUY IT!!!!

Episodes:
There are 10 per disc, five per side.

Grades:

Presentation- 2/5
This is a cheap cardboard box.  The folder case box that holds the discs in it is a little tight and is doesn't slide out real easily and you have to pull it out sometimes by force.  It also had some bad animation of the Galaxy Trio and Birdman on it.  Another complaint is that it is called a 2 disc set  but it is 2 flip disc.  I wonder why they did not put it on full discs?  Other shows are done with more minutes on a disc.  On top of that the disc are stacked one over another so you must remove one to get the other one out.

Appearance-3/5
Although you can see the ""dirt"" on the screen it is not very bad.  I would have preferred a restored version but what do you expect out of a DVD for about $15-20 for the whole series?

The show-4/5
The show itself is great and it aged very well.  Even though characters will announce everything they do when they do it  this is expected for the time period this show was made in.  The odd thing is how some characters change in appearance between episodes, such as Dr. Millennium changing hair and skin color.  The oddest thing is how almost every bad guy was green skinned!  Even if they were human!  There are some off moments when Birdman is shown without wings or his symbol on his head. Or color changes in his costume.  Vaporman is shown without sleeves a few times in the episodes.  A little more continuity would be nice.  Maybe tie in some characters and a background would have been nice.

Special Features-0/5
There are some trailers of other cartoons and one documentary about the show  but nothing special.  It would have been nice to have some character profiles and an episode of  Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law plus the one episode of Space Ghost Coast to Coast where he has Birdman on the show.

Overall-4/5
All in all I would recommend this to kids and adults who like comic and cartoons.  It  has good hero moments and if sci-fi is your thing there is the Star Trek like Galaxy Trio part.  Buy it and enjoy!",1256342400,3,2916,4.261904761904762
2802901,4,B000OY9V7K,"Birdman and the Galaxy Trio is an enjoyable disc collection of some of our favorite cartoons from our friends at Hanna-Barbera.

The action is great, even if the storyline sequences do not quite measure up to Space Ghost or The Herculoids, both of which are also from the HB Superadventures genre. Regardless of whether it was Birdman in a bind, where his powers were diminishing in a cave where he had no exposure to his own source of power and regeneration, namely the sun, or if it was a Galaxy Trio segment where Gravity Girl was under an evil spell, we could rest assured that no problem was too insurmountable for the climactic triumph of hero over villain in less than five minutes!

Looking at it from an adult's perspective, the quick results or victories often resulted from plot holes that would either make the viewers laugh or roll their eyes, or both. However, Birdman and the Galaxy Trio, despite its seeming flaws, left, at best, notable impressions in young minds that there exists a world, whether fiction or real, that crime does not pay and that the good guys would always prevail.

Overall, Birdman and the Galaxy Trio had a good theme, though seemingly inane by application, that managed to make each episode rather pleasant, so enjoyable, in fact, that I myself own this set.",1243900800,,1298,4.734513274336283
2802902,5,B000OY9V7K,I am so glad they put these classics from my childhood on DVD.  I have missed being able top see REAL cartoons on Cable. This is a MUST HAVE for anyone born during the 1960 - 1970 era.  Boomerang is fine but there are times I want to see my cartoons in their original episodes and not inbetween other shows.  Well done Hanna-Barbera!!!,1237248000,,335,4.285714285714286
2802903,4,B000OY9V7K,"BIRDMAN & THE GALAXY TRIO is another classic superhero from the late 1960s produced by Hanna-Barbera and designed by Alex Toth. While BIRDMAN combined superheroics with the government agent theme, THE GALAXY TRIO shorts had its own intergalactic baddies and surefire action. A bit campy for my taste, but it also had its own coolness, too, and both are highly enjoyable.

I strongly urge the heads at Warner Bros.'s DVD division to dig into the H-B vault and release these other action/adventure gems from Hanna-Barbera,ASAP:

THE HERCULOIDS
SHAZZAN!

The context in which those of us who watched Birdman, Space Ghost, Herculoids, Shazzan et al,on Sat mornings is very much viewed through rose-tinted glasses. I can think of dozens of shows I watched as a kid (Land of the Lost, The Shazzam/Isis Hour, Sigmund the Sea Monster etc) that I thought were awesome and on watching them today, discover that the mythology I built around them was built on a premise that no longer exists. So we have to view them differently - it's like watching the original King Kong and saying how crap the effects were.
Having said that I still enjoyed them and they were still entertaining albeit for different reasons. So what if they all followed a similar premise or rehashed stories used in other cartoons shows? Don't we do that today anyway? It's great to have these on DVD and I only hope more are released such as Herculoids, Mightor, Valley of the Dinosuars, Shazzan. Geez, considering some of the crap that they are releasing on DVD, I can't see why these wouldn't be released. Sit back and enjoy.",1222387200,2,1074,4.569948186528498
2802905,5,B000OY9V7K,"Based on my dim childhood memories I had no idea how brilliantly terrible this series was.  Now I'm in total awe of the myriad of tricks and plot elements utilized in Birdman to avoid doing any actual animation, while still somehow managing to convey stories.  Birdman is virtually always a stationary drawing that shoots ""animated"" energy beams. Occasionally while flying his wings twitch a bit.  Very often an action is about to happen and the camera cuts to another character in a talking head shot saying something like ""Those evil robots have just walked through the doorway.""  Basically, any individual episode of Birdman could be animated in a weekend by a 12 year old kid who mastered Flash... if he had Alex Toth and some top notch voice actors working for him.  And what really dumbfounds me is that as a kid I had NO IDEA the animation on this series was so cheap.  I just thought Birdman looked cool and was mysterious because I caught his show only rarely for some unknown reason.  Next to the Challenge of the Superfriends (the season with the Legion of Doom), I think this is my favorite cartoon of all time... just slightly ahead of Space Ghost.",1218585600,4,1161,4.661764705882353

Thankfully i didn't and i bought this nice collection and priced well also.  Its not a bother with the packaging to me, i never had a problem getting the discs out.  Being for when this cartoons were made the quality is pretty decent.  It's not going to be spectacular these cartoons were done back in the late 60s.  Even still they hold up well to the things available today.

2802920,4,B000OY9V7K,"Alex Toth was one of the most influential comic book artists in the business.  He started out working on JUSTICE SOCIETY OF AMERICA superheroes back in the 1940s, and never completely stayed away from that field.

In the 1960s, he was hired by Hanna-Barbera Studios - the animation kings of Saturday morning cartoons at the time - to work on cartoon television shows and create characters and strips.  While there, he created BIRDMAN AND THE GALAXY TRIO, SPACE GHOST, SUPERFRIENDS, and THE HERCULOIDS.

In the 1960s, cartoons took huge budget cuts. Hanna-Barbera Studios struggled to find ways to meet the budget restrictions and still deliver exciting, fun-filled cartoons for the Saturday morning crowd. One of the ways they did this was to have similar scenes throughout a series. For example, a hero always went into action the same way, that way the establishing shot could be used over and over again.

There were also several ""talking head"" shots that allowed writers to establish plot and character through dialogue (which was still done quite cheaply compared to the animation) instead of action. Most kids at the time didn't really notice the changes, but if you compare the cartoons of this time period with the ones Max Fleischer and others did back in the 1930s, you'll see huge differences.

Birdman was a superhero who lived inside a cave and waited for calls to action from his contact, Falcon 7 (a one-eyed man that reminded me a lot of Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.). Birdman had wings that allowed him to fly. His powers were solar-based, which requires him to frequently flights where the sun several times during nearly every episode. He fired solar blasts and could create solar shields to protect himself.

He was accompanied on his missions by a large eagle he called Avenger. Later, he created his own sidekick (something that most Supriano strips had back in those days - young teammates were all the rage because Adam West had Burt Ward). Birdman's sidekick was a boy he rescued from a shipwreck. He called him Birdboy, which - although not terribly invented - got the point across. Birdboy had essentially the same powers, but his wings were metal not feathers.

Most of the missions that Birdman undertook involved threats from aliens and highly organized criminals with superweapons.

Usually in a half-hour show, there were three short cartoons. Two of them were Birdman episodes that book-ended a GALAXY TRIO episode.

The Galaxy Trio was a three-man team from an intergalactic law enforcement agency. Actually, the team consisted of two men and one woman. They were Vapor Man (who could turn his body into vapor), Meteor Man (who could change the size of any part of his body and become super-strong), and Gravity Girl (who could change the gravity in an area were on a person).

They usually targeted powerful criminals or criminal organizations on different planets of the space sector they patrolled.

All the Birdman and Galaxy Trio episodes are gathered here in this DVD. When I first heard that this was going to happen, I was excited. I grew up on these cartoons. I can remember wanting to be Birdman and Meteor Man. Sadly, the cartoons don't stand up to my memories and my nine year old son was not impressed. He can watch an anime for hours, but he was giving up quickly on Birdman.

He actually prefers the new HARVEY BIRDMAN, ATTORNEY AT LAW episodes that still air on Adult Swim.  In his new reincarnation, Birdman has retired from the superhero business and become a lawyer.  The episodes often feature other cartoon characters in suggestive plotlines that lampoons them as well as the naive nature of the series back when they first aired.

Although the cartoons won't occupy the middle grade kids, they're still good enough to hypnotize the younger ones. I mean, after all this is a hero who has wings and can shoot beams. Not only that, but Birdman has his distinctive cry several times in one episode: ""Biiiiirrrrrddddddmmmmmaaaaannnnnnnn!""",1188604800,6,3993,4.910846953937593

2802922,5,B000OY9V7K,"1967 was a year of love, the Vietnam War and super rock groups and of course Birdman and the Galaxy Trio. Negatives, the packaging is cheaply done, all I can say is when you take out each dvd, use lens paper, as to not get fingerprints on the two dvds. I felt W.B. could have gave the consumers of this product, better packaging. There could have been remastering of all the episodes, you could still see artifacts while watching these two dvds. Maybe it was better W.B. left the original prints the way they originally are. I know Spiderman 1967 5 dvd 52 episode set has 48 episodes remastered and some look like they were made a day ago, only 4 episodes of Spiderman have not been remastered in the 1967 set. The positives of Birdman and the Galaxy Trio: The Complete Series, it is nice to have all the episodes of each series, there is also a really interesting documentary ""Birdman The Forgotten Hero"". This documentary explains the origins of Birdman and the Galaxy Trio, and how Hanna--Barbera had some amazing artist in thier studio during their twenty year or more, dominance of saturday mornings. I enjoy watching these cartoons, and as silly as they sometimes are I still enjoy it. The soundtrack for these cartoons may repeat itself on many Habba Barbera cartoons of this era, but I feel Joseph Barbera was a really good musician. Enjoy  Birdman and the Galaxy Trio: The Complete Series for what it is good clean and at times silly fun. I'm not into superheroes but man, I cant wait till Warner Brothers releases the ""Fantastic Four 1967"" .

2802923,3,B000OY9V7K,"I bought this set purely for nostalgia and I'm glad I did, but it appears that little effort went into restoring these episodes for this DVD release. The video transfer suffers from all sort's of age related debris, scratches, speckling and is nowhere near the quality of some of the other Hanna Barbera releases. As for the overall packaging and condition of the discs, some fans will definitely be disappointed.

The packaging is absolutely cheap and the quality of the discs is just plain terrible. In this set, you'll get a very cheap cardboard package and two double sided discs that sit on top of one another. The discs are very hard to remove from the package and chances are they'll get scratched, if they're not already.

I pre-ordered this set from Amazon and when I received it the discs were already full of fingerprints and scratches. I contacted Amazon customer service immediately and they offered a replacement set without question and issued an apology. When the second set arrived it was riddled with deep scratches, more fingerprints and some kind of residue on the discs making them unplayable. It's evident from this release that the company doing the DVD replicating for Warner has some serious quality control problems and they need to be addressed immediately.

As for Amazon, they resolved the problem to my satisfaction with a level of customer service I've come to expect. I wish I could say the same for Warner Studios. As for an apology, Warner should apologize to all the fans and to the people at Hanna Barbera for the way they handled this DVD release.

7:00 am (Atom Ant/Secret Squirrel/The Impossibles/Frankenstein Jr.) until

1:30 pm (Johnny Quest) in the 1966/1967 time range.

The most interesting point I wish to make is this:

All three major networks had Hanna-Barbera cartoons.  Stranger still, I

don't remember ANY of them clashing with each other during the day!

In Los Angeles, one could flip from chs. 2 (KNXT - now KCBS/Columbia)to

4 (KNBC/National) to 7 (KABC/American) and catch about all of their

cartoons.  (I seem to remember Birdman airing on Ch. 4 at the time)

Birdman - It was never said, but he worked with 'our' US Government in

battles with the bad guys.  As Communism was big in the 60's, the over-

tones were crystal clear.

of criminals.

8187347,4,B000OY9V7K,"Fron 1967, Hanna Barbera gives us more outer space and earth heroes What can I say, I am a sucker for these old cartoons. what can you look forward to...cheesy dialog, the usual artwork/illustrations so ther3e will be nothing new but guess what....I still had a wonderful time watching a few episodes here and there. I'm not sure if the kids will like it because they re used to more CGI based toons with more story lines and action. But for me, love the old stuff.",1501372800,,465,4.4186046511627906
