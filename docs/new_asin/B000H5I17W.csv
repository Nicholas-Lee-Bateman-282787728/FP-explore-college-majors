8136350,4,B000H5I17W,"Long out of print, this 1983 VHS tape features a trio of classic videos from David Bowie's ""Let's Dance"" album. Most importantly, it remains the only commercial release to include the uncensored version of ""China Girl,"" which never aired on MTV. A definite must-have for Bowie collectors.",1259971200,2,288,5.148936170212766
