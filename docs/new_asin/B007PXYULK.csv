8520788,4,B007PXYULK,"This is a futuristic film that bends reality with programs asking questions about the illusion of life and free will in a sea of nothingness. Jimmy (Chrsitopher Lambert) is a computer programmer. His new game ""Nirvana"" needs to be delivered in 3 days. While playing the game on liquid marijuana, he discovers his main character Solo has self-conscience awareness due to some undisclosed virus.  Solo (Diego Abatantuono) requests to be deleted, as a man not satisfied with his life, asks his creator not to be born.

Jimmy chooses to travel to Marrakesh, a black market community of rogues in order to find answers and maybe Lisa (Emmanuelle Seigner) who left him a year ago. Not my first option if simply destroying the chip is the goal. Jimmy meets a number of odd characters as his program, in ways, takes control over his life.

The film suggests, that in life, we are all programmed and we can't change the outcome. Any attempt to change the outcome, is already part of the program. Surfing is forever. A sci-fi thriller for the geek in you. I watched my version as part of a Miramax 12 pack action film DVD.

8520789,4,B007PXYULK,"Not to be confused with the band that brought ""grunge rock"" to the masses, Nirvana is a very interesting 1997 science fiction film that is one part Cyberpunk Action Thriller and one part European Arthouse. It takes place in the not so far off future where video games and illegal drug usage is on the mind of every civilian on the globe. The most popular games are made by Okosama Starr and Jimmi Dinni, who's latest title ""Nirvana"" is nearing it's deadline. Not to mention that it's also become infected by a virus that's somehow or another helped the main character Solo gain human awareness/sentience.

Pleading for his life and tired of having to restart after dying, Solo begs Jimmi to delete Nirvana and let him rest in peace. Ontop of that, Jimmi is searching for his wife Lisa who suddenly up and left a year ago, leaving him in state of emotional distress.

Overall, Nirvana is a wonderful thrill ride, but it leaves you with a sense that more could have been done to make the film feel more fleshed out. However, I would still call it a very solid film that deserves at least one viewing",1388880000,,1097,4.5353535353535355
