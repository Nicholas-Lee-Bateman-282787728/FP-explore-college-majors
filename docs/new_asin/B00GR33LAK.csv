6104272,5,B00GR33LAK,"Attended the Incomplete movie Premiere! Fantastic!!!
Actors Jaye Taylor, Michael ""Mike Pain"" Davidson, Sanura, Donald Porter, Jr. and Nicole Bee.
Prenominal performances! Dynamic!
Swift and down to earth. Reflects real life!
Not just a chick flick...but ladies, it'll make you think twice! OMG moments!
You'll look at relationships in a deeper manner. Nice soundtrack too!
There should be a making of a Part 2!
A must have movie!!!",1392163200,23,431,5.352941176470588

6104276,3,B00GR33LAK,"Kinda of disappointed in this movie.  It was really long and saying absolutely nothing for the first 40 minutes of the movie.  The acting by the main character Kimberly was also awkward and forced along with the very contrived storyline.  It is another movie that portrays black women as sex crazed and weak even though there is really no problem going on because the main character seems to have everything.  At first Kimberly tries to be there as a safety net for her best friend who is going out on a blind date with the fireman.  When he also brings his married friend Malik as a security net to make sure that he has a buffer - Kimberly acts rude and hard towards him.  Eventually Malik, an engineer in the field of construction becomes a client at Kimberly's firm and they become chummy.  She is in a stable marriage to her successful husband named Jason, an attorney but yearns to have a baby to complete her idyllic image of a family.  She finally gets pregnant when she seeks comfort in Malik, but ultimately has an abortion because she can't face telling the truth to her husband.  Afterward, she learns that Malik had a vasectomy and that the baby was hers and Jason's all along.  None of the events were a plausible reaction on handling minor things in a relationship.",1510531200,,1280,4.550218340611353

6104287,2,B00GR33LAK,"While I understood the premise of the film, I had an issue with the writing and in particular the lead character, Kim (not the actress). The lead character was poorly developed and immature. The film underdeveloped the relationship between Kim and the Malik character. To me, it didn't go deep enough into why the Kim was so drawn to Malik to the point of wrecking her marriage. I didn't see any real passion or sexual tension between them. The ending threw me off a bit with the 'Catch Ya' moment or twist it tried to present. The sound quality was inconsistent in some places; the voiceovers were a bit extra. The film quality was good though. I loved Shy because she is gorgeous and stylish. Malik is a cutie as well although he was a bit monotone throughout the film. Good luck to everyone involved with the film though. This was a good effort but I hope they take it to the next level with their future films.",1498003200,7,914,4.446428571428571

6104355,1,B00GR33LAK,Well... I read the synopsis of this prior to purchase and it seemed like it would be very interesting and a good film. However the story line was something else in that immediately the female lead goes into wanting a baby right when the movie begins  and doesn't let up. I had to stop the movie maybe 20 min in it was slow and predictable. But please. Don't solely take my review as gospel. Read some others and  watch it yourself... After all no two people think alike you may enjoy it.  However I do like the cover photo and the  title of the movie on the DVD box.,1413676800,2,566,4.165137614678899

6104391,3,B00GR33LAK,"Story line was hazy, not really sure if the baby seeking wife really loved her  always airport bound attorney husband. The story did not provide a reason as to why the wife was so desperate for a child. The acting was below average, and the ending was not clear as to the biological parents. It was clear that this couple had a challenging relationship, but should have portrayed happier times, other than the strange invitees to the husband's birthday party.",1398038400,6,459,4.7375

I was determined to support this project and complete the movie, so it put me to sleep two nights in a row, and I finally finished it one morning.

I hope those involved get better and do better next time.",1530748800,,342,4.573770491803279
