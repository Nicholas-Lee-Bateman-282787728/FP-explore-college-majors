7851204,4,6303591140,The product is a good instructional video! It covers the basics well but I wish it had more about using tumble assist products.,1328227200,2,127,4.565217391304348
7851205,4,6303591140,"Over all, I thought this instructional video was pretty informative. I did like how they included many ways to do a certain move (front/back roll, cartwheel, roundoff). It definitely helped with comfortably executing each (after much work, that is). The explanations and examples were quite clear (though as I will mention, not as specific as I had hoped).It was definitely for beginners, which was very good for me, what with not having any experience.

However, what I didn't like was how it didn't offer specific detail as to how to execute certain moves, such as the cartwheel. It wasn't as specific as I had hoped it would be, it didn't explain how to begin a cartwheel, only what you should think about/do while performing it. It also does not include certain ways to stretch (which is very important), or how to do a handstand. When introducing one of the front rolls, they do a handstand, without explaining how to do it.

It was helpful, though I suggest using this video as an aid, not a guide, to tumbling, and to do it with someone experienced. It does not offer all that beginners should know (though a lot), but it is useful for practice.",1154563200,4,1152,4.669950738916256
