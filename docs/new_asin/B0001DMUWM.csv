1991963,1,B0001DMUWM,"The audio is SO unbalanced, you can barely listen to it and the picture is nearly unwatchable.  IDK who produced this, but the transfer is just horrible.  Why even bother?  I'm wondering if this is a bootleg with a 30 year old Betamax mono tape as the master?  I can't speak to the movie itself as I'm only 2 minutes in; but I saw a preview of this movie on the VHS version of ""Terror On The 40th Floor"" and it looked really good.  I've wanted to see this movie for years.  I'm just so sad that it appears I won't be able to watch it because of the God-awful audio. :-(",1435968000,,569,4.035714285714286

1991967,1,B0001DMUWM,"I was thinking that it would be the forerunner to the movie ""Showgirls"" but even as bad as that movie was, this one is worse.  There is NO discernable plot and characters are muddling their way through the film.  Don't waste your time.",1416787200,,235,4.441860465116279

1991969,2,B0001DMUWM,"Didn't bother to watch it to the end. Not at all on the same level as the choices that led Amazon to recommend it to me: ""Choose Me"" (a wonderful movie that everyone should see) and ""Round Midnight"" which was also quite nice. Sometimes the recommendation system works, sometimes it doesn't!",1203897600,3,290,4.705882352941177
1991970,2,B0001DMUWM,The picture quality on this DVD was terrible.  I wish it had been better because it had a great cast.,1190073600,,101,4.05
1991971,3,B0001DMUWM,"An interesting melodrama, this production features Lesley Ann Warren, Rita Moreno and Dianne Kay as three dancers of differing skill levels who are hired for a new revue in Las Vegas at Caesar's Palace, where the picture is set, and focusses upon various travails within their private lives as they prepare for the opening of their show, with the eponymous Warren's character deservedly garnering the most screen time. As a Broadway dancer recruited for the engagement, Warren plays high-stepping Jillian Brooks, whose need for success upon the stage is altered by her affairs of the heart, while Moreno portrays a veteran hoofer whose husband (Tony Curtis) is a sucker for entrepreneurial scam artists, and Kay is an inexperienced beauty queen from the Midwest. The film could easily have been much less engaging, as clichd situations abound, but the episodic script is effectively utilized and includes a good deal of skillful dialogue, there is splendid editing by John Woodcock, and a strongly appropriate thematic underscore is provided by Jimmie Haskell, while the performance of the talented and generally underprized Warren goes beyond the expected implications stemming from her comeliness.",1113264000,9,1199,5.382978723404255
1991972,3,B0001DMUWM,"PORTRAIT OF A SHOWGIRL is the made-for-TV movie genre at it's trashy-best.  Musical theatre veterans Lesley Ann Warren and Rita Moreno shine as two hard-boiled hoofers looking to make the 'Big Time' in Las Vegas.

If you're a fan of Lesley Ann and Rita, you'll adore this film.  The picture quality is quite lousy, but just having this campy gem on DVD is a miracle in itself.

Not the girls' finest hour, but worth a look nontheless.",1113264000,8,434,4.597402597402597
8010759,2,B0001DMUWM,"Portrait of a Showgirl is better than the infamous film Showgirls, but that isn't saying much. Tony Curtis's career really had to be in a decline for him to appear in something like this. The finale, with a Rockettes' style dance number, is the highlight.",1524009600,,255,4.688888888888889
8010760,3,B0001DMUWM,"If I recall this was a made for TV movie. However the film quality is poor & the sound as well as the lighting are badly in need of adjustment.
This movie pointed to a lot of topics that were popular discussion at the time including congressmen on the take.
But one issue was oddly overlooked, some dancers were sometimes just dressed as women.
