8064230,5,B0009OF8V8,"Dr. John is a national treasure, and this functions as a repository of music Americana. The Doctor is not quite as good as other instructors when it comes to breaking down the material, but his performance is amazing. This is essential for your collection if you want to know more about New Orleans music history.",1442448000,,313,4.709090909090909
8064231,5,B0009OF8V8,He is a master. This is pretty advanced stuff and he doesn't really slow down to make it it any easier to see what he's doing.  On the other hand these videos have some great performances that you won't find in his records.,1396656000,,223,4.186046511627907
8064232,4,B0009OF8V8,"I don't feel Dr. John's the best *teacher*, but if your learning style can benefit by watching a master, this dvd is a valuable lesson.",1368144000,,135,4.44
8064233,4,B0009OF8V8,"The Doctor is in the house. My thoughts echo those of the guys who wrote about the next lesson/volume: this stuff is brilliant AND complicated. I've been hammering out a basic blues/boogie riff for probably +/-50 years with not a single tune attached. Just exercising the fingers in the same blues keys the Doctor uses in this lesson. OK, hands apart! Work those bass lines til your left hand aches, then try learning just a few signature right-hand riffs. Don't worry about putting left and right together anytime soon unless you're already there. Point is, this is THE stuff from THE Master and it will help you immensely if you don't let the complexity  and the fact that he doesn't break it down completely GET YOU DOWN. Buy this and have hours of fun playing with Doc J.  He and Leon Russell have kept this genre of great piano music alive. Bless they hearts!",1291420800,2,864,4.603896103896104
