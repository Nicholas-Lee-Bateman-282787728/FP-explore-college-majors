8630787,5,B000099531,"I found this World of Swing Shag series just what I have been looking for. This series can take you from the Basic Shag steps into more Shag moves than you can remember!  That's why the whole Shag series is a must have for Swing dancers.  Whenever you need to brush-up on the basics or review/lookup moves for a nights dancing, jam session or competition, just pull out this collection of great shag material for reference.  The included Shag-jams are good entertainment and can give you great ideas on how to use all the shag moves you will learn from these tapes.",1055721600,2,565,4.519607843137255
