3912376,5,B002DQLYY0,"I boought this DVD Video ""Shipmates forever"" for a good friend who served on the USS Colorado Battleship in WW II.  The Colorado was used in the film and I thought he would enjoy it.  I viewed the film before giving it to him and enjoyed it very much.  I have not talked to him since giving it to him and so I do not know what his reaction to it was.",1328486400,2,350,3.8333333333333335
3912377,3,B002DQLYY0,"""Shipmates Forever"", a large scale 1935 Warner Brothers release, took the popular duo, Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler, into a navy setting just as the year before, ""Flirtation Walk"" took them into the army. The formula was repeated - Frank Borzage directing, a melodramatic plot whereby Powell may or may not succeed to graduate, a fair selection of on-site scenes, this time Annapolis, the home of the United States Academy, and a sprinkling of catchy tunes for Powell to sing. Although the first film was a box office smash, Warners had the sense to improve the formula, making the duo less maudlin, giving Keeler a chance to tap dance in her role as a dance teacher and presenting a much more authentic insight into life within the Academy. In fact, the film has genuine historical value in its scenes set in and around the sea. Borzage's direction is exemplary and both the leads benefit from his care even though the plot is contrived. There is the usual extensive supporting cast, the standout being Ross Alexander in a virtual repeat of his previous performance in ""Flirtaton Walk"".

The DVD is one of the Warners Archive Collection which means it is very expensive and the print is unrestored. The print here is not good with plenty of scratches, popping and at least one noticeable tear. The only extra is the original theatrical trailer.",1262736000,5,1344,4.818181818181818
3912378,5,B002DQLYY0,"I would just like to add, to the above reviewer, that Warner Bros on-line store will not ship Archive released videos overseas...therefore it is very helpful for us in United Kingdom that some dealers are offering these internationally.
In my experience dealers are NOT doubling up on price, same or less than Warner Bros are asking.
Until Warner change their shipping policy, I hope dealers will offer these dvds via Amazon!",1249603200,7,425,5.0
