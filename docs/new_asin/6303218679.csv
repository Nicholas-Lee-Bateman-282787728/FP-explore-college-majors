7841018,5,6303218679,"In many ways ""Shadow Ball"" is my favorite episode in Ken Burns' celebrated documentary mini-series on ""Baseball.""  From the very first ""inning,"" Burns has been intent on setting up the greatest moment in the history of the game, when Jackie Robinson stepped on the field in 1942.  ""Shadow Ball"" fully sets the stage for that pivotal moment, looking at the great players of the Negro Leagues: Satchel Paige, Josh Gibson, Cool Papa Bell, Judy Johnson, and Buck Leonard.  Meanwhile, back in the Major Leagues, Lou Gehrig begins the decade playing with Babe Ruth and ends up with Joe DiMaggio while the Yankees take on Dizzy Dean and the Gas House Gang St. Louis Cardinals, but you wonder how either team would have done against the Pittsburgh Crawfords.  The impact of the Great Depression also comes into play, inspiring the first All-Star game among other things.  Also, this is the episode that makes Buck O'Neill a star.  More than any other former star who talks about the old days on these tapes, Buck is the one who becomes baseball's beloved Dutch Uncle and the game's best good will ambassador.  Hearing him talk about baseball is an absolute joy.  ""Shadow Ball"" captures both the triumph and the tragedy of Negro League Baseball.",986083200,5,1236,4.852380952380952
