I  came across a vhs copy on the internet in the late '90s but have lost it. it is a great video, but does not capture the marvel that it was watching it live.
It was a once in a lifetime event for me, unless he returns to houston. (he has recently stated that he would love to return to houston to do a show). Before the Houston Rendezvous even, nothing even close had been attempted or done in the US.
with all the new technology now, I bet it would make the '80s event seem like nothing.

8305474,5,B001GI21JI,"I watched this concert in person in 1986, and it was amazing. I purchased the VHS format a year later but it finally gave out 13 years later. I would really like to see a new version on DVD. I hope he reconsiders the decision!",1362614400,2,226,4.044444444444444
8305475,5,B001GI21JI,"Superb video of the 1986 mega concert by Jarre.
The whole city skyline was taken over for just one night!
Lazers,fireworks,projections on building,lighting and video effects..oh and some music!
This video shows the edited highlights of this MASSIVE EVENT!
The intro is different to the standard UK version.
The sleeve is UNIQUE to this version.
Superb!

8305476,5,B001GI21JI,"Jean Michel Jarre Rendez-vous Houston: A City in Concert,

Wow,
Back in 1986 in America this show was and did celebrate the Nasa Foot steps in space as well as on the Moon.
I look forward to the original 90 min`s show on DVD. It is a good DVD to watch and Relax & Chill, at the same time enjoy and watch in Awe.

8305477,5,B001GI21JI,"This DVD was announced by Francis Dreyfus Music on September 29th 2008, scheduled for release in the UK starting Oktober 13th 2008.
But on October 4th, it was officially cancelled (although an unknown amount of copies had already been pressed).
The offical statement from Jarre's Management:
""it is important to underline that Jean Michel Jarre was not consulted or informed of the release by Francis Dreyfus Music, this in itself is sufficient to oppose it.
Jean Michel Jarre takes too much pride in his work and care in his creation, to allow it, and you, to be exploited, without the necessary investment of offering the best standard possible. A mere DVD copy of the VHS format, where no Bonus nor Extras are proposed, would have led to a less than mediocre product sold at normal price. The DVD, as Francis Dreyfus Music planned to release it, would have done more harm than justice to what remains a milestone event. Due to the evident poor quality of the film, which has not been restored or upgraded to today's digital standards, is at all a level of a product that Jean Michel Jarre could be artistically satisfied with.""

However possibly a very limited number of disks may have been shipped through Amazon.co.uk, as a fan posted pictures on a forum.

Official statement from Francis Dreyfus Music:
""We had to hold this release for contractual reasons but do hope this issue will soon be solved. However that some fans have received the DVD before cancellation is impossible because not one single copy of the DVD was shipped out of our office in Paris to our foreign distributors, at the time the DVD release was put on hold. The stock is locked up. Amazon.co.uk confirmed to us in writing that they had not sold any DVD to any customer who had ordered it, for the simple reason that they had no stock. So either the fans are lying, or the DVD they have purchased is a pirate recording. As you can imagine, a pirate recording is a very serious copyright infringement and its quality is certainly very poor.""",1293321600,2,2018,4.69774011299435
8305478,5,B001GI21JI,Saw a copy of this years ago in St. Lucia and have been looking for a copy ever since.  It's difficult to understand why so hard to find.  maybe singularly unlucky or a universal joker has me pegged.  It is nevertheless an astonishing performance by someone who's hard to equal.,1279065600,,278,4.52
