2124431,5,B0002VEVOI,"I have seen many shows in the past but about this one, I have to admit that it is truly an amazing show. I will avoid writing down all the names and terms that occur during the shows so that to avoid causing any ""headaches"" to the reader.

The story basically evolves through a galactic war among an elf-look-alike nation, called the Abhs, and humanity. Thing is that the first ones are human beings as well; they just altered their DNA and became something like a supreme human race. Moreover, they are conquering the galaxy and as it becomes obvious let us say, the ""primitive"" kind of humanity resists.

Apart from it, the amazing thing is that the story evolves around Lafiel and Jinto, the first is the daughter of an aristocrat and a princess at the same time, of the Abhs, and the second one is a human and a noble man among the ranks of the Abhs. May sound confusing, but in the series it will become apparent that some human nations have also formed alliances with the Abhs and fight side by side with them.

Having watched the complete shows, meaning all the episodes from ""Crest of the Stars"" up to ""Banner of the Starts II"", the viewer will definitely get hooked up with the show. As the episodes go on, the more attached he or she will become with the main protagonists, especially with the relationship between Lafiel and Jinto, that starts as a strong friendship and evolves to a... . Furthermore, the protagonists are caught up in the mists of war and have to do anything possible not just to stay alive but also to protect each other... As for the ending, it surely answers all the questions that me be in the viewers mind and has a satisfying ending.

All this been said, I will definitely suggest the show. But if you truly want to watch the show, than you must see it from the beginning, meaning to the ""Crest of the Stars"", then ""Banner of the Starts I"" and lastly, ""Banner of the Starts II"". The only sad thing is that in the end you will want more of these shows but I do not know if there will be anything new ""out there"".

The only thing left to say is: Enjoy them...",1143590400,5,2092,4.3538461538461535
2124432,5,B0002VEVOI,"I remember way back when watching Crest of the Stars for the first time, feeling somewhat bored as the lengthy narration and, explanations of technology, and setup of the complex politics took place whilst the main characters were introduced and then slowly developed. Of course Crest of the Stars is an amazing piece of work once you get into it, and only gets better with each viewing. What once seemed to be boring now is thought-provoking, and characters reveal more depth to me the more I try to understand them. The second series, Banner of the Stars, was an almost entirely different animal. Instead of the slow pacing of the original, it had loads of great dialog among key players, and so many battles that I felt completely exhausted by the end. This series is the last of the trilogy, and I was starting to wonder how the series was going to end by the time I finally got around to watching it. I needn't have worried.

Now that we have come to understand Abh thinking, Abh politics, and Abh life, you could say that the story is really kicking into high gear as far as the two lead characters are concerned. While in the first series Lafiel and Jinto were teenagers who thought more like kids, and in the second they were more like teenagers trying to act like adults, they are now at the point where they are, and act like, adults. Jinto is no longer uncomfortable when people refer to him as count Hyde, and Lafiel is no longer so self-conscious and over-doing it in her efforts to live up to her family's name. Now count Hyde is becoming something of a skilled diplomat, and Lafiel has gained the confidence she needs to become an excellent captain. They aren't kids helping each other out of dangerous situations or teens learning to trust each other. Now they are old friends who know each other quite well...and maybe more.

For this series, it seems like an extra coat of polish was applied to everything. The new remixed themes of some of the scores are simply magnificent, the visuals take a significant jump forward in quality over the second series (and everything is in widescreen to boot), and the dialog, camera angles, and overall feel of the show is much tighter this time around. We don't need any lengthy explanations of Abh technology anymore, and as a result we are free to learn more about the Abh code of honor and ethics, and how sometimes that code requires making incredible sacrifices.

The overall story revolves around how Lafiel and Jinto find themselves negotiating with the government of a recently conquered territory, only to find out that it is a prison planet on the brink of civil war. As the enemy approaches, Jinto and Lafiel both have to take a stand for what they believe to be right and for me the best character defining moments of the trilogy are all in this series.

While there are fewer episodes in this series than in the previous two (which may contribute to the tight feeling and lack of filler episodes), but this is made up for by the bonus episode ""Birth"", which deals with Lafiel's parents, and how she was born. The end of Banner of the Stars II is highly satisfying, as things truly have come full circle for the two lead characters, a chapter of their life is ending, and another is beginning. For fans of the previous two Stars series, this is required viewing.",1104364800,32,3330,4.591596638655462

2124474,5,B0002VEVOI,"The show does not disappoint. With crest of the stars I was engrossed with great characterization and subtleness that could only be pulled off with good writing. The second season succeeded with aplomb in that as well.
Much more heavy on the space battles and over-arching wat between the two factions of humanity. Not quite as much romance but it is still present, only in the form of small subtle quips and lines that reveal or hint at the true feelings of our favorite two characters.

2124477,5,B0002VEVOI,I have really enjoyed this series - this is the second (2) of three (3) parts and continues the story of two kids from different cultures that grow up separate and together and how this interaction affects their lives and careers.

2124479,4,B0002VEVOI,Banner of the Stars 2 is a great sequel. The Crest of the Stars series is very different. The story is pretty unique. I was impressed by the detail that went into the creation of this futuristic world. The only complaint I have is the animation. Although it is better in this volume than the first 2 installments it's still a little lax. If you can get past that the characters are great and the story is emotional. I highly recommend it to any serious anime fan.,1349481600,2,463,4.333333333333333
2124480,5,B0002VEVOI,"To appreciate the tale you have to have all three parts of this story!  The way it deals with cultures interacting, colonial minds, the merchants - the gentry - the royalty - the commoners and of course those who are assimilated or that desire not to be(!) is without a doubt a most marvelous treatment of the whole course of European - Asian history. Of course it deals with prejudice and nationalism - the enemies of Peace.  The romance that develops from a single meeting of two wonderful children and becomes a tale of love during a long time of war: if you do not own this DO SO! The whole set Crest of the Stars and Banner of the Stars complete to the last episode... This is truly a defining moment of anime history for tale-telling adventure.  Liking cats and roses helps but is not necessary... ~8) Jinto and Lafael are two characters I will always remember.  I hope you come to as well.

2124481,5,B0002VEVOI,"I bought these for my daughter, she loves anime and manga. So these one is one of her favorite, as she said ""These is so totally awsome"". Banner of the Stars is fantasy and scfi milltry action. It has space scenes in it which is really cool. It is rated for everyone 10 and up. Some violence in it not bad. So go buy it and enjoy it.",1313798400,,333,3.911764705882353
2124482,5,B0002VEVOI,"With the war between the Abh and the United Mankind in mop-up stages, a series of task lay ahead: dealing with the remaining enemy fleet and bringing back under control planets that had been lost during the war. The story picks up with Lafiel and Jinto as they are assigned as Territorial Ambassadors assigned to a planet whose political situation is growing more unstable by the day. Having to navigate intersecting and overlapping sense of responsibility, justice, and commitment, Lafiel and Jinto discover what is truly important to them.

Both the Crest of the Stars and Banner of the Stars series are, in my opinion, anime sci-fi gems. The films do a great job conveying the rich story, beautiful narrative world, and deep characters from Morioka Hiroyuki's classic story. There are few anime science fiction series that are at once so fun, so rich, and yet serious enough to be meaningful.",1292544000,4,895,4.927152317880795
2124483,5,B0002VEVOI,If a scifi movie with great a great story is what your looking for then this movie for you with great effects it's a worth while movie to enjoy.,1291507200,,144,4.0
2124484,4,B0002VEVOI,"I was truly in love with ""Crest of the Stars"", a storyline that featured a storyline about war, those who are human or landers who have been occupied by the Ahb Empire now fighting for their independence but in the middle of this war is an Ahb Princess (Lafiel) and a Count (Jinto Lin), who threw thick and thin fight for survival but trying to succeed together.

At the end of the series, the final episode flashed back four years later as Lafiel has now finished training and is a Captain of her own ship and crew.  Jinto finished his training to become a supply officer on Lafiel's ship.

The second television series ""Banner of the Stars"" continues where the first series left off.  Where the first series is character driven and pretty much focused on Lafiel and Jinto's adventures, the adventure does continue in ""Banner of the Stars"" but now that war has commenced, we are introduced to many more characters.  Especially those who command various starships for the Abh Empire and those who lead the battle against the United Mankind.

There are no adventures in planets or cat and mouse type of storylines.  In fact, ""Banner of the Stars"" is more like a Star Trek episode as you meet Lafiel's crew and together, under Lafiel's command, go into battle.

In a way there is an irony about this series as ""Crest of the Stars"", you wonder if your allegiance would be towards the humans because the Abh Empire pretty much takes over other planets and the inhabitants are forced to become part of the Abh.  But with Jinto's situation of being the son of a traitor (his father gave up his planet to the Abh without a fight to become a leader of the planet), he questions where he belongs.  What he calls home.

But in the end, you stick to it, because you enjoyed both Lafiel and Jinto together and hope there is a budding romance between the two.  Obviously, the two are good for each other but how it works out and how they get even closer is not really focused on in the second series which may bum some viewers out.  Especially, those who enjoyed the character development that was in place for ""Crest of the Stars"".

But this series is full of space battles but what people who want some kind of sign that there is hope for romance for the two main characters will have to wait because the focus in this series is between the Abh Empire and how they will go against the forces of the United Mankind.

AUDIO:

I listened to both the English and Japanese audio. I actually enjoy both the Japanese and English voice work in the series and found myself really enjoying the English dub (this is coming from a guy who prefers his anime in Japanese).  One thing I noticed on various online stores are reading people who were upset of the Abh language not being subtitled in the opening sequences.  Same as ""Crest of the Stars"", there are no translations but it should ruin it for you because it's just the opening sequences and that is it.

VIDEO:

""Banner of the Stars"" aired in April-June 2000 and considering that this series is eight years old, the animation still looks very good and doesn't look dated.  Whereas ""Crest of the Stars"" takes place in various settings, ""Banner of the Stars"" pretty much features the crew in their ship, their quarters and the same goes for the other commanding officers of the Empire.  So, there are a lot of blues, blacks and grays.  Not as many vibrant colors compared to ""Crest of the Stars"" but nevertheless, the animation continues to hold up quite fine.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

The DVD features trailers, summaries but my favorite part was the creator of the manga series, Morioka Hiroyuki, chiming in on his feeling of each volume titled ""Newsletters of the Stars"".  Mainly text on screen, no video but Interesting comments by Morioka wanting to see the characters in a hot springs episode.  That was quite amusing.  Another was his comments made of a fellow voice actor in the series who passed away which was good to read.

I was hooked by the storyline of ""Crest of the Stars"" and fell in love with the series but ""Banner of the Stars"" is totally different with the fact that despite Lafiel and Jinto, the two main characters still are the main key characters in this series, the dialogue and banter, character development is held at a minimum since the focus is on the action and battle sequences.  The war between the Abh Empire and United Mankind.

For those hoping to see more of the two get closer in terms of their friendship, you do get something and it's held late in the final episode after the credits roll.  So, make you sure you don't miss that.

But all in all, this series is building up to something.  What that something is, I don't know.  But I did enjoy the series overall for its space wars storyline.  Miss the ""Crest of the Stars"" style of storyline but I'm staying in for the long run and preparing for the next series ""Banner of the Stars II"" and looking forward to the progression of the war storyline and of course, whatever happens between Lafiel and Jinto.",1221523200,3,5022,4.541111111111111
2124485,5,B0002VEVOI,"There was a time when I thoght that the best chapter in the Stars series was Crest of the Stars. Then it was the third chapter in the series, Banner of the Stars II. And now, after having seen Banner of the Stars III, and having reflected innumerable times on the entire series, reading every manga, and every novel available in English... this is my favorite chapter in the series. For now.

At first glance Banner of the Stars might seem a little cheap compared with the other chapters of the series. It's only 13 episodes like Crest of the Stars, but there's a recap of the situation at the start of almost every episode (to the point of becoming annoying). And the first episode is filled with flashbacks. It could have been done just to save money. On the other hand, with a story of this scope it feels good to review the story and keep looking at it from different perspectives. And while the animation is doubtless much higher budget in the first installment, and there's plenty of reused music and animation in Banner of the Stars, the new music is actually better than the old in my opinion and feels less repetitive. The animation likewise feels more fleshed out and warm to me, and the characters more relaxed. I also enjoy the overall feeling of tension and stress combined with close-quarers that the space battles entail.

In the first part of the Stars series Lafiel and Jinto were teenagers, little more than kids as far as maturity goes. In Banner of the Stars II they are young adults with more confidence and control gaining respect in teh Universe. But on this voyage they are just on teh verge of becoming adults, taking on responsibilities that scare them and going through the trials and tribulations of finding their place even as they face te terrible fear of instant death on the battlefield of space.

The conversations between Lafiel and Jinto are wonderful, but teh conversations between everyone are great. Hearing Lafiel and Jinto chat about where their life is going, hearing Admiral Spoor grow impatient dealing with a planetary government, and seeing the various crew members play off of Jinto and avoid confronting Lafiel never fails to entertain. But the most memorable characters are probably the Bebaus brothers, whoose incredibly dry and mild sarcasm back and forth entertains me every time (gotta love a guy who takes a bath right in the middle of a brutal battle for control of the Universe).

Perhaps strangely, the part of the show that I enjoy the most is when teh Supreme Commander of the fleet (Lafiel's father) and his assistant are planning their strategy over massive simulated fleets, and you can see in depth just how desperate the fate of te Abh Empire is. If you love military strategy and war history it's the sort of thing you can really get into (if only there was a strategy game based on this series eh?).

The overall pace of this show is much faster than Crest of the Stars (which still takes the cake for slowest start of any anime series I have ever seen which actually turned out to be worth watching), with a heavy emphasis placed on intense space battles. In fact, the first time I watched this show I felt like I did when watching a marathon run of Gundam Wing. It was like I almost couldn't catch my breath from all that excitement once the battles got going. If you want to see our protagonists in desperate dramatic situations this show definitely does not disappoint.",1216166400,2,3438,4.657331136738056
2124486,3,B0002VEVOI,"Banner of the Stars, the sequel to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crest-of-the-Stars-Complete-Series-Set/dp/B0001BMM5Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crest of the Stars - Complete Series Set</a>, is a mixed bag to say the least. On the one hand it's slow, tiresome, badly paced, and boring; on the other it boasts some of the best space combat I've seen since Star Wars. Hailed by some as one of the best anime series ever (Crest of the Stars, Banner of the Stars, and the next in the series Banner of the Stars II) this show certainly has its strong points, but ultimately its flaws hold it back considerably to the point where I found it very hard to enjoy the story or sympathize with the characters.

Set three years after Crest of the Stars (which you'll have to see before tackling this series) Jinto is a supply officer on the quick attack ship Basriol, and Lafiel is the caption. the war between the Abh and the United Mankind has reached a stalemate, with both sides taking heavy looses in a failed UM attempt to take the Abh's capitol. For three years these opposing forces have been building up their strength, preparing for the day when the fragile cease fire will end and they can resume their conflict. Now, that day has come as the Abh launch a devastating attack called ""Operation Phantom Flame"" against the UM. Jinto and Lafiel, along with their loyal crew, are thrust into the midst of battle to fight for their lives and their nation.

The series never really seems to know what it wants to do with its scenes, one minute there's an enormous space battle involving hundreds of ships all firing their pulse cannons and space mines, the next you see the commanders sitting calmly in their flag ships, talking endlessly about completely random things which have absolutely nothing to do with the battle outside. Its these interruptions in the action that spell doom for the series; the transition from the frantic pace of battle to the slow, dull, boring pace of the conference room is done so often, so abruptly- often at the worst possible moments- that the grand scale of the war is lost. You'd think that a show like this, which is really all about one huge battle, would have focused on, well, the battle. The endless politics, the mood swings of the commanders, the twenty minute conversations, the characters taking brakes in the middle of battle to fix themselves a drink (no kidding), it all wore down on what should have been the series main focus.

Although not perfect, the soundtrack for this series is very fitting and nice. When I first heard it, it reminded me of ET and some old 70's sci fi music, but I also heard a lot of similarities to Star Wars and Now and Then, Here and There. Very nice music, with woodwinds and strings being the most present instruments. Unfortunately, if also suffers from repetition. Although I really enjoyed listening to it, I didn't enjoy it so much that I wanted to hear the same exact songs every single episode. I suppose that's to be expected, but still I would have liked to hear a little more variation with the song selection. the opening has a very old fashioned sc-fi sound to it, which makes it seem like an old classic as opposed to a futuristic tale, while the closing delivers yet another mediocre song to go along with a whole host of mediocre anime closers like Cowboy Bebop, and EVA, but that, too, is to be expected.

As for animation it's a notch above average, nothing great mind you, but the space battles are really memorable, even though they do recycle a lot of their scenes. You'll see the same UM ship blow up about twenty times in this series; just try to ignore it.

The three stars this show gets are for the music, animation, and the space battles which were nothing sort of incredible. The Stars series isn't amazing, certainly not up to par with a lot of anime I've seen, but it's still a show worth giving a look. If you can find it cheap then go for it.

2124487,5,B0002VEVOI,To me this is a very interesting anime.  There is so much action in this series and the characters in the anime are very cool.  It is interesting how there is like a love triangle but yet not at the same time.,1201392000,,209,3.9523809523809526

2124489,5,B0002VEVOI,"The third installment in the series shows that epic space battles aren't necessary to tell a compelling space opera.

Almost all the events in Banner of the Stars II take place on a single planet, Lobnas II. Lafiel and Jinto are assigned as ambassadors to the world, which until very recently had belonged to the United Mankind.

The series has plenty of action, but what really stood out for me was that this is the first time you actually see Lafiel and Jinto actually talking about how they feel towards one another.

Overall, I'd recommend it wholeheartedly for fans of Crest of the Stars and Banner of the Stars. Those who haven't seen those two series would do much better to start with them, however, as this is a lousy place to jump into the story.",1184716800,,756,4.544117647058823
2124490,3,B0002VEVOI,"I'm always on the lookout for new Anime and Manga (I just finished a 50 episode Gundam DVD set for example).  I had hoped this might be a bit on the more... adult side.  I keep reading that Anime/Manga in Japan is an all ages affair, but why do we constantly see the same theme over and over again: ""teenagers thrust into world shattering intrigue who must save the day""?

Well thats where this story starts as well.  Unfortunatly, Its also dull as heck.  Episode 1 starts with a human planet being blockaded by a massive, previously unknown race called the Ank who demand their surrender.  So.. they surrender.  Phew!  I almost thought there would be some action!  Then in episode 2, one teenager meets up with his old school friend, then meets an Ank teenager (humans who look like elves...) who is there to fly him to another world.  Episode ends.  This goes on for many episodes, then there is some action, then more filler episodes.

Its not bad, its just not that compelling.  Also, the translation to english is missing something.  To see what I mean, change audio to english, then turn on english subtitles as well.  The superior officer says ""Well thats good"" but the subtitle states ""I thought you couldn't handle it"" when someone completes a task.  A subtle change, but it means something different.

The other problem, (and I wonder if this is also a translation problem) is that the Ank are supposed to be the bad guys.  They invade worlds and enslave their inhabitants.  They state this a few times and say there is a human alliance of planets against their tyranny, who are fighting against the Ank (when the action finally starts).  The problem is, the story is told from the stand point of a human who becomes an Ank warrior and his human (female...) Ank protector (and superior officer).  Who am I rooting for?  They enslave planets, but the 2 characters are supposed to get our sympathy and emotional investment.  For what?  So they can enslave more worlds?

The DVD quality is passable, but the navigation is all in japanese so it takes some getting used to.  It also seems to be missing some episodes in the middle of the story, but my guess is it was some of the most dull storyline and it got cut.

As a rule, I never, ever review something until I get to the end of it, but I'm not sure I'll make it there...  If you're dying for some anime and have nothing else, the price is right, just don't expect seat of your pants action.",1173657600,5,2452,4.498866213151928
2124491,5,B0002VEVOI,"Banners of the Stars II is the final installment of the Crest of the Stars franchise and by this time feels like an old friend to those of us who have watched the first two series. If you haven't then don't worry you don't need to watch the others to grasp what's happening though it does help. In my opinion this is the best of the three. There is noticeably less action then in either of the previous series. Jinto is less of a twit in this one though he's still not the invincible knight, just an honorable guy. Speaking of Jinto he gets into another life or death situation, but this time Lafiel can't save him. Does he live does he die, I'm not going to tell you because that would kill the suspense of the entire series. If you've watched the last two series then you know what to expect, perfection, and it lives up to that expectation. The only difference is that this one runs has no meandering or slow pacing, everything happens quickly. Also Jinto's and Lafiel's relationship finally comes to a head though not in the usual manner. It's a good showing of the old saying absence makes the heart grow fonder. If you have watched either of the last two series then this ones a must.

8032817,1,B0002VEVOI,"I started watching Crest of The Stars and enjoyed that a lot. I was excited for Banner of The Stars, not realizing it would go into the battles more than simply advancing Jinto and Lafiel's relationship.

Banner of the Stars II, however, starts off with an emotional slit of the throat and then gives us a tacky and unsatisfying (open) ending on a 10th episode after spending episodes 1 to 9 explaining the events on a planet that is entirely a prison that leads into to the emotional stabbing they did on the viewers in that first episode. It doesn't even conclude in a satisfactory way. I'm fuming that there is a Banner of The Stars III, but it was more like a two episode OVA to wrap things up in a rushed manner -by giving text explanations of how each major character ended up. You won't likely find BoTS3 legit as I don't think it was picked up for US release.

So yeah, while I want to give credit to the work put in, overall the fact that we never get to see Jinto go through all three stages of Abh life with Lafiel has me in a rage, as their relationship is entirely verbal and never seems to get any bit physically intimate, even when there were chances for a simply kiss to the cheek to happen. It undermines for me the efforts put in elsewhere. BoTS3 even textually concludes with no info on them having a child. It is concluded in text that Jinto only continues to feel his place is on the battle lines, serving under the other girl who clearly liked him, and I am in too much a rage to even recall what happened to Lafiel as it didn't involve deciding to have his kid -despite her tears (something her family line is not supposed to show) and verbally clear desire to be around him.

This was not a proper way to end a beautiful lead up and because Banner of The Stars II is the furthest the majority can get into this series it would best to not even delve into this series, or a least be prepared to be left on a cliff.",1514073600,,1937,4.215633423180593
