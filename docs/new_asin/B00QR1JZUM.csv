8692366,5,B00QR1JZUM,"NOT A HISTORY OF CASTLE BUILDING, BUT AN OUTSTANDING DOCUMENTARY OF SIX CASTLES, A SIEGE AT EACH ONE, SOME WEAPONS, AND BACKSTORY OF CONSTRUCTION OF EACH CASTLE

This excellent series is deftly and dramatically narrated by Dan Snow.  It is not comprehensive in its coverage of medieval castles, but picks just six from among the greatest medieval battle castles ever built and laid siege against.  Each of the six episodes covers one castle and begins by introducing that castle and the famous siege that will be presented.  From there, they pause to go back and explain why and how each castle was built.  Along the way a few important weapons are discussed that play a role during each battle or siege.  These include formidable weapons such as the counterweighted trebuchet, heavy crossbow, longbow, Lombard cannon, and others.  All are demonstrated live at various locals.  A modern castle under construction in Guedelon France is visited to illustrate building techniques such as stone cutting, brick making, mortar making, metal work, and stone laying -- as they are actually doing work on site at the castle.  The show will provide a range of castle vocabulary as they describe construction and engineering.  However, this is mainly for those who have limited exposure or can use a little refresh.  In depth descriptions of castle terms and history are avoided so they can focus mainly on the story of each castle and siege.  Here are the six castles in order of episode:

1271 Krak des Chevaliers in what is now Syria.  This fortification was built and garrisoned by Hospitaler Knights from a previously abandoned Kurdish fort.  Built to withstand earthquakes in addition to siege, it became one of the most imposing castles ever built.  Laid siege to by Sultan Baybars the Mamluk.

1203 Chateau Gallaird in Normandy built in astonishing time by Richard the Lionheart.  He died before the siege brought by the forces of King Philip II of France which was during the time of John, Richard's brother.

1216 Dover Castle.  Again in the time of King John, the siege was brought by Prince Louis of France as a group of English Barons dissatisfied with King John invited Louis to take power from the unpopular king.

1295 Conwy Castle Wales.  King Edward (Longshanks) has built a series of castles to tame the Welsh region with Conwy as its centerpiece.  Welsh Prince Madoc ap Llywelyn leads forces in an uprising against the castles culminating in a siege at Conwy with Edward eventually trapped inside.

1410 Malbork Castle in what is now Poland.  The Teutonic order has turned its focus from the Middle East to the Prussian region of Europe.  Malbork Castle is a gorgeous and formidable centerpiece to a series of red brick castles.  Jagiello is both the titled King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania.  He leads a force of Polish and Lithuanian armies in an attempt to halt the Teutonic campaigns throughout that region.

1487 Gibralfaro Castle in the Muslim Emirate of Granada, Port of Malaga (now Spain).  Ferdinand and Isabella lay siege to the castle in what would be a key event of the Reconquista.

Though the title sounds a little dramatic or cheesy, this is a very excellent and enjoyable series.  The historical detail is very good and informative, though I did notice a minor error or two, such as the background on Baybar who actually rose to commander for the sultan's forces before taking power for himself.  That detail isn't really central to the story of the castles, therefore I call it minor.  There's a fair amount of graphics to show what the castles looked like in their greatest glory.  Dramatic reenactment is also used liberally.  I found the modern demonstrations of some weapons and siege engines quite thrilling.  It's astonishing to see the sheer power of the counterweighted trebuchet in motion.  It actually made me feel a little anxious as those huge timbers swung the projectile.  I can't imagine being on the other end.  Casual historians and castle aficionados alike should enjoy this well produced and well narrated program.",1420934400,9,4068,4.925
