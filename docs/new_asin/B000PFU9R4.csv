I got this in the used/new category and the discs look perfect and all
that I have played have played perfectly.  I feel like I've made a
great buy.  You get 11 discs that covers WW II from soup to nuts.  If
you can get it for under $7.00 that includes S/H like I did, get it !",1344988800,3,347,3.6
