8395181,1,B003E1QCYK,"This was not a good film collection at all. One of the films does not even have Jet Li in it (Jet Le), and some of the movies are just documentaries of his life.

This is perhaps the most horrible Jet Li Film Collection of all time.",1355788800,2,232,3.9361702127659575
8395182,3,B003E1QCYK,This was an ok DVD.  There is a lot of content and about half is okay with a couple movies not bad.  The other half is just barely okay.  I could have lived without.,1345420800,,165,3.7941176470588234
8395183,5,B003E1QCYK,"I purchased this movie as a gift. The person I bought it for loves Jet Li movies, so I know he will enjoy it.",1307491200,,109,3.5833333333333335
8395184,3,B003E1QCYK,"The official product description (not available on Amazon) for this item reads ...'This super collection contains eight of Jet Li's most important and action-packed films. From his first appearance at the age of 10 to his greatest martial arts blockbusters. Jet Li shows why he is the megastar he is today and has taken action by storm!'

However, see the list of films included and comments below:

1. Dr. Wai and The Scripture Without Words  - FILM, as far as I can tell this is the only US release of this film
2. Last Hero in China - FILM, as far as I can tell this is the only US release of this film
3. Bodyguard from Beijing - FILM, previously released by Dimension Video as 'The Defender'
4. Kung Fu Cult Master  - FILM, released in the US previously as LORD OF THE WUTANG or THE EVIL CULT
5. Fists of Legends 2: Iron Bodyguards  - FILM, THAT DOES NOT STAR JET LI

6. Legend of Kung Fu Hero  - DOCUMENTARY about Jet Li (this is the age 8/10 reference in the official description above ... no movie with Jet Li in it 'acting')
7. Li-Thal Weapon - DOCUMENTARY about Jet Li (with film clips in it)
8. Jet Li: The Kung Fu Years - DOCUMENTARY that's a look at Jet's Kung Fu years

The above is informational only at this point. I have recently purchased this item and it's on the way.  When I receive it I will update this review to ensure its accuracy and tell you of the picture/sound quality.  I'm sure it's of low quality but with some of these titles never before released for US distribution, I'm curious.",1300579200,24,1514,4.299295774647887
8395185,3,B003E1QCYK,"Despite the title that says 8 jet li films, there are really only four actual jet li films. The rest are documentaries, a movie without jet li, instead it stars jet le whoever that is, some footage from when jet li was young etc. However the 4 jet li movies are good and you would be hard pressed to get all four of those jet li movies for this price. The video isn't the greates but it is hard to find chinese jet li movies with good video. The other bright spot of this movie is that I believe the four jet li movies mentioned are in chinese with english subtitles. I cant stand english dubbing.

I would reccomend to foreign fil fans or jet li fans only. These movies even the ones I mentioned aren't like American movies jet li or otherwise.",1294704000,8,971,4.96319018404908
