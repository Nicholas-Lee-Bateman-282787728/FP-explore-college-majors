7944646,4,B00005M2DB,"Just a fun ""teen"" flick, very predictable, but a good couple hours' diversion.  Recalled seeing it years ago.  I'm a Nastassja Kinski fan.",1478304000,,138,4.956521739130435

7944649,3,B00005M2DB,"Not one of the best movies I've ever seen, but acceptable entertainment.  The reproduction on the DVD is quite poor, nothing was done to improve the quality of the original movie in the transfer to DVD.  So, what you get is an old, noisy VHS reproduction.",1398124800,,255,4.521739130434782
7944650,4,B00005M2DB,"This is a great movie for understanding the struggles and trials of coming to terms with dating in ones teen years. The plot was intelligently written to center around learning moralistic values after the cast participated in activities that disregarded such values. The point of this movie is to learn from error and become a better person along the way, which is what many of the characters did in this 70s teen comedy. As the movie unfolds, it is obvious that this is the first major role for many of these actresses. they are mediocrally developed as characters, but still draw the attention of the audience to care what happens to them in the film. So for a movie that is a step above American Pie and possessing a deeper plot, check out Boarding School.",1370217600,,759,4.62962962962963
7944651,5,B00005M2DB,"Entertaining romantic comedy with Gerry Sandquist and the young Nastassja Kinski. Some pupils of a girls boarding school pretend that their school is a brothel, in order to at last make their first sexual experiences. After many obstacles they finally succeed with their project.",1135987200,5,279,5.363636363636363
7944652,1,B00005M2DB,"This DVD is presented in 1.33:1 and looks like someone took an old, very old, VHS copy that had been watched a few hundred times and copied it over to DVD format.  Very grainy and extremely soft picture.  The sound is spotty and muted.

The film itself is semi-decent late night cable fair, only stands out because Nastassja Kinski's 19 year old boobs.

This is for the DVD version with amazon.com's ASIN of B0000DG98R.",1107129600,20,419,4.621621621621622
7944653,3,B00005M2DB,"I saw this movie in the cinema many years ago. The movie shows Natassja Kinski at age 19 topless as well as other 2 or 3 young women (one a blue-eyed brunette even more beautiful than Natassja), also in several stages of nudity; in a tale of repressed girls at a private school in Europe, who try to get to know romance and possibly also sex, in secret, with the young men from a nearby boys private school. Only the beauty of the young women justifies the movie, which otherwise is rather cliche. Last year I bought a dvd from a different maker (Front Row Features) which did NOT play in my dvd player but DID PLAY in my computer's dvd drive. This DVD, however, played without problems in my DVD player. I gave it 3 stars because the quality of the transfer of its images to DVD is only moderate, and because the extent of the scenes of female beauty can not lift this movie any higher.",1087084800,19,887,4.285714285714286
7944654,1,B00005M2DB,"Enjoy the precious few seconds of Nastassja Kinski prancing around in the buff, then use the DVD as a beer coaster. Preferably, German beer. Because only those zany Germans could have made a movie this bad.",1043712000,8,206,4.75
