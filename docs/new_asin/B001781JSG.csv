8265392,5,B001781JSG,"A very moving story about friends watching a very loved member of their friends circle die.  Some very enlightening parts about how peoples attitudes to AIDs was very unbelievable in early days.  When it was seen as a ""Gay"" disease so not important to the ""real"" or mainstream world.
Heart braking.  As a person who was alive when AIDs first was known in the world I have experienced some of the fear of how to catch it.  But the attitude that is shown about people just not caring because they were 'queer', is just so mind blowing.  A wonderful tale all need to see.  BUT only
the lucky few wil I guess.
God bless all.",1453075200,,620,4.3478260869565215
8265393,5,B001781JSG,"At least I know there is one moron left on the planet, the one who gave it a 1 star. This is a perfect combo of cinema verite, high camp and poignancy of an era of which I am a part. Really very amusing and now in my 60's reminded me sadly of how shallow I must have been then not to have realized the urgency of AIDS although I thought I did at the time.",1444176000,,355,3.6842105263157894
8265394,1,B001781JSG,"Sorry guys, but I could not believe Quentin Crisp would participate in such terrible piece of wasted celluloid. If there is any redeeming quality in the whole piece it is in the acting of the elder couple--they were great! A friend of mine wrote a review of this movie about a year age--what happened to it?",1316736000,4,307,4.5
