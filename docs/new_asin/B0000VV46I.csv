8003948,2,B0000VV46I,terrible movie by a terrible director,1520380800,,37,5.333333333333333
8003949,4,B0000VV46I,Our main character is Kennedy (Jimmy Tuckett) he lives in a very small suburban community and wants to be a rock star. He has such a difficult time keeping the band together virtually by himself because the rest of the band just phones it in. The manager is Kennedy's brother and as time goes by kennedy begins to have his doubts about how he is managing the band. This is a low budget indie and I have to say that I was loving it through and through. The characters have been defined and the actors and quite competent. Totally did enjoy the story as it unfolded and I think you may too. The bumps in the road for Kennedy and how he tries to keep things afloat with the help of the girl he works waiting tables with who has a crush on him and sometimes to high to climb but worth following. I do recommend this movie and hope you enjoy it.,1492300800,,840,4.159509202453988
8003950,3,B0000VV46I,"Titled in Australia ""Clubland"", ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Introducing-the-Dwights/dp/B000YV2184/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Introducing the Dwights</a>"" misled me into purchasing surely.

Eventually, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Introducing-the-Dwights/dp/B000YV2184/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Introducing the Dwights</a>"" is a story of generational exchange as following a then-young-lovely-joking husband, an England's cabaret artist came Down Under just to divorce and grow up two sons, a semi-spastic younger and baby-faced twenty-year-old truckie shy and knowing nothing in bedroom activities his girlfriend pushed persistently him in.

Perhaps, produced in a last year of a Howard era, this comedy is a copy-cat of the ""family values"" movies of the fifties (Tim, for instance), during a last decade Australia had artificially been pressed in, as explicit sex scenes resulted in a happy wedding finally, where a same gender couple dances joyfully.",1210377600,,1038,7.570247933884297
8003951,5,B0000VV46I,"What a movie! Rarely do we see in motion pictures such raw and honest reality as we do in CLUBLAND. This sexy film about stardom and the difficult choices that come with it, explores the morality and consequences of a rock star life, and the sacrifices it takes to get there. You will not be disappointed by this very worthy film from the producer of THELMA AND LOUISE. As well, a fascinating and moving soundtrack complements the film.",1097971200,,436,4.602564102564102
