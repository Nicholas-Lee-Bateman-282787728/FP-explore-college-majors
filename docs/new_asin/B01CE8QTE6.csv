8752820,1,B01CE8QTE6,"Hollywood drums up these redundant fantasy films. Like Revenge of the Nerds and its sequel films, where the nerds all win the beautiful girls in the films.  And the most ridiculous film Knocked Up where a fatter and nerdy looking goofy looking Seth Rogens character has sex with an amazing fantastic gorgeous looking Katherine Heigls  character and he gets her pregnant.?!!  The redundant premise of this film story is that Heigls character cant get a date because she is thirty something, and all the guys at a disco club don't want to ask her for a date or dance because they are young twenty year old pups. That is sooooo STUPID!!!!  So she is desperate and dances and goes home with a fat ugly Seth Rogens character. Has sex with him a and gets pregnant. That is soooo unreal!!",1532563200,,781,4.597122302158273
