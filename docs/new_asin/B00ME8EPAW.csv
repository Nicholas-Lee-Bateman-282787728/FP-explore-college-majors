6568113,5,B00ME8EPAW,My daughter has been watching Super Why for about 2 years. She has seen many of the episodes. I believe that this is helping to expose her to more words and phonics skills while entertaining at the same time. The stories are very kid friendly and educational.,1325289600,,259,4.531914893617022
6568114,5,B00ME8EPAW,"If you had asked me 6 months ago about ""Super Why"" I would have said ""Super What?"" Since that point, my 2-year-old has discovered the wonders of this fantastic PBS program. Super Why encourages young children to look for solutions to their problems by looking in a book. This series teaches problem solving skills as well as the fundamentals of reading. My little boy can now easily identify all of the letters of the alphabet. He enjoys the songs and the characters and I can actually watch it without feeling annoyed (unlike an un-mentioned purple dinosaur). I've been very pleased with the series thus far.",1323907200,,609,4.809523809523809
6568115,4,B00ME8EPAW,I bought this for the Christmas story in it. I didn't realize when I bought it that it also has a Halloween episode on it. There are 4 episodes in all on the DVD. They are all very cute. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because when you pick the episode and think it's about to start it goes into some PBS commercials first. Otherwise my 3 year old loves it!,1318550400,13,370,3.8815789473684212
6568116,4,B00ME8EPAW,My boys love Super Why!  I purchased this DVD so they could start to understand the upcoming holiday season. So far so good.  I would have given the DVD a perfect score if the subtitles wouldn't automatically turn on after every episode.  You have to go back to the settings before each episode and turn the subtitles off.  I can only hope it's my DVD and not the way they put it on the market?,1313712000,,394,4.213333333333333
6568117,5,B00ME8EPAW,"Both of my boys watched this DVD (ages 8 and 2) and enjoyed it very much. This DVD has four episodes total, one of which is about Christmas and another about Halloween. In the Christmas episode, the Super Readers are on a mission to find out why Santa visits children on Christmas. They fly into the classic story ""`Twas the Night Before Christmas,"" meet Santa, and find out that he visits children because it makes both him and them happy. How cute! If you have a little one who is just getting into Christmas (like my youngest), he or she will LOVE it! Not to mention, any time my youngest sees a question mark, he nows says, ""Look Mommy, Super Why!""",1308182400,5,652,4.396694214876033
6568118,5,B00ME8EPAW,My 3 year old loves this DVD and all of the Super Why series. He interacts and enjoys each story. This is a great show by PBS that truly teaches early literacy. Including a love of the alphabet and reading. Highly recommended!,1305244800,10,226,4.404761904761905

6568125,5,B00ME8EPAW,"My daughter loves this show. We bought her 2 DVDs of Super Why. It's excellent and educational. My only complaint with this DVD is the episode where the kid whines ""I can't do it"" and ""Never never never"". Those are phrases he repeats OVER AND OVER and I'm not too thrilled with my daughter picking that up. I skip that episode for her. The Santa episode is her favorite.",1484956800,2,370,4.3768115942028984

6568151,4,B00ME8EPAW,"As always, Super Why is great educational entertainment for kids.  The biggest complaint I have is that I like to let the kids watch holiday movies around the holiday that is occurring.  So, I let them watch this around Christmas thinking it had the one Christmas episode and maybe 3 random ones.  However, one of the episodes is for Halloween.  It's still great and they like watching it but I would much rather have my Halloween shows on a different DVD to show earlier in the year.",1425600000,5,484,4.528735632183908

We stumbled upon this show through Netflix and my son was hooked after a few minutes. It was the Halloween episode in this DVD collection that we happened to see first.

Not only did that episode help him understand Halloween is only pretend (he wasn't sure how he felt about the scary things at first this year....but after this he knows it's all pretend and thinks its the best holiday ever!) but he also LOVES to find the Super Letters and spell and read with them.
