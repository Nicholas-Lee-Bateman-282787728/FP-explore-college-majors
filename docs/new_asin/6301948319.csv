Dempsey is a pretty brilliant comic actor, and this movie has great kitsch quality.  Granted I watched the first half on mute as i was talking to my girlfriend on Skype and then the second half with the sound on.  the bikers just left their Initiation Ceremony (weird beaver hats and high pitched chanting) on Water Harleys.  the Bikers Woman (the Love Goddess) never leaves her tower because (I just discovered) she's studying for her doctorate in Sociology.  The insane scenes with kellerman and Al Waxman are totally loony.  GO EIGHTIES!!!!!! I also recognize a bunch of later Semi Famous people in it!  Its kind of like Really Old Episodes of Friends, the humor is idiotic, but there's a certain comfort involved.  ENJOY!",1240185600,2,994,4.805882352941176

He gets asked by Tripper to work at Camp North Star.  But, when he gets there, he notices some changes.  Tripper has sold North Star to Mean Gene (George Buza) and he has this woman who stays with him that everyone calls ""The Love Goddess"" (Shannon Tweed).  And while at North Star, Rudy watches porn movies of his favorite porn actress Roxy Dejour (Sally Kellerman).  She dies during the making of one of her love scenes, and goes to Hollywood heaven.  Once she gets there, they don't let her in until she does a good deed for someone on earth.  She choose Rudy as her assignment.  And one of her assignments for him is to get him laid.  Once that is done, she earns her wings into heaven.  Rudy falls for a girl named Wendy...and once all that falls into place, then Roxy is in.  Every guy at North Star wants to get their hands on the Love Goddess and when it gets back to Mean Gene, he goes and throws them out the roof.  It's pretty weird, but it has it's poor laughs.  The special effects of where Roxy uses her angelic magic to help Rudy out is even more funny.  I sure hope that this will become a DVD someday cause I sure want to buy it.  If not alone maybe if it becomes a DOUBLE FEATURE DVD with Meatball part II.",1107475200,,1382,4.213740458015267

7817398,3,6301948319,"Wimpy Rudy Gerner (newcomer Patrick Dempsey) has just graduated from high school and is off to work as a grunt at a rough river resort nightclub.  He would like to be more effective with women and lose his virginity.  Acclaimed porn actress Roxy Dujour (Sally Kellerman) died on the set and was transported to the Pearly Gates to meet Peter the Doorman (Charles Durning), who says she can't get through them unless she performs a good deed on earth really quickly.  She decides helping Rudy will qualify.

Oblivious to the interest shown by nice, former schoolmate, Wendy (Isabella Mejias), Rudy hankers after other women, like the slutty Val (Justine Campbell) or the inaccessible Love Goddess (Shannon Tweed).  Val is linked to Rudy's biggest tormenter, Tom (Peter Snider); The Love Goddess is jealously guarded by Rudy's violent boss, Mean Gene (George Buza), who has lots of violent buddies, The River Rats.  How can all of this resolve?

While summer-campy and over-the-top, this edition of the ""Meatballs"" franchise was my favorite.  Dempsey was charming in his debut, the other characters hammed it up effectively, and it was all good fun.

The violence is cartoonish (especially the way Mean Gene is able to eject those calling on The Love Goddess).  A number of the female extras at the resort give their topless best.  Of the main actors, only Dempsey and Snider have material skin shots.  The sex scenes are cartoonish too; one involves a bull.

The DVD has no extras, other than five still photos and a plot set-up summary on the back cover and apparently an original movie poster on the front cover.  There are ten chapters, the first nine of which are close to 10 minutes each.  The film's picture is not sharp: the overall quality is good videotape level, with a brief vertical line early on and a few artifacts throughout.  Still, one can see everything fine, and the sound is good.  While IMDB shows the film lasting 96 minutes, my disc timed out at a bit over 93 minutes.  On the back of the DVD case, the producer writes, ""Movies used by UP ALL NITE FILMS are public domain products and are not licensed nor authorized by the original copy right owners.""

Meatballs III is an enjoyable light comedy to while away some time.",1371168000,3,2242,4.776623376623377
7817399,4,6301948319,"I remember seeing this on USA's Up All Night. Yeah, the jokes were crude but all in all it was a good film in my opinion. It had some good scenes in it. It's weird the other Meatballs films are on DVD and this one isn't. Sad really.",1331078400,2,232,3.8541666666666665
