8486986,5,B005UNI2Z2,"I saw this movie on netflix a few hours ago, and I have to say, for an indie this was great. Lust in hell is a japanese erotic/romance/drama. There is a sequel which I have yet to see.

STORY

After losing her parent in a tragic traffic accident, Koto develops the ability to communicate with the dead. Hospitalized for extreme trauma, Koto escapes to return to the place where her parents died. There she meets Shinji, whose lover also died in a car accident. He and Koto then embark on an illicit and terrifying journey heightened by lust and death. Koto is able to bring back the dead and see into hell.
This all leads to a well balanced story. I was rather overwhelmed by the tension in Shinji. I felt the story was quick and to the point.

CHARACTERS

The characters are well developed. As the story goes on, we learn more about each character. Koto is basically the god of the film. Shinji is troubled after losing his wife. Shinji's friend plans on killing him, simply because he is tired of his negativity.

ACTING

The acting is much appreciated. I felt that Koto's performance was terrific. I really felt shinji's character, it was really well acted. The acting was believable in this film.

SEXUALITY

The sexuality is very graphic. It is garunteed to turn you on. There are numerous sex scenes throughout the film. And they are quite beautiful.

FINAL WORD

This is definitely a movie worth checking out. It's quite rare too. I am hoping the sequel is as good as this one was. This may be my favorite indie film.",1364947200,4,1524,4.529197080291971
