It belongs up there with A Charlie Brown Christmas, How the Grinch Stole Christmas (both 1966 & 2000 versions), The Polar Express and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.  I went to Wal-Mart today and I was surprised it was on sale early.  I couldn't wait until November 4.  I just had to buy it.",1225497600,,319,4.448275862068965

So watch it then or record it or buy it after you see it (I bet the prices will go down after it comes out since its a short picture!)

3461819,5,B001AQT112,"I know a lot of fellow reviewers are upset with the price of this DVD, but I cannot let that mar the product. This was the most outstanding Christmas Special I have seen in close to twenty years. Most of the other Christmas Specials I own are from my very early childhood or classics from before I was born. This will become a family favorite for years to come. When I found out this was being released, I literally called my brother and he was as excited as I.

The humor appeals to children as well as adults in the same manner as the films. It spreads a message of togetherness and family unity for the holidays as only Shrek, Fiona, and company can. It has wonderful twists on holiday tales, songs, and traditions that keep you laughing until you're wiping away tears.

""Shrek the Halls"" is sheer brilliance and a fat dose of holiday hilarity. Don't let the price scare you away. The years of laughs are well worth the price-tag - besides folks, ""quality, not quantity.""",1224460800,11,974,4.466292134831461

I TiVo'd this last year (2007) when it came out for the holidays on TV and I have kept it saved in TiVo this whole time. I watch it at least once a month! It ranks right up there with the three full-length moviews in the series.
Hysterically funny. You will have to rewind in certain parts because you'll be laughing so hard you'll miss some. :)
Great watch!
My only complaint is that it's not long enough ... the good ones never are ... ????

While I'm not a fan of ""potty humor"", I found the jokes in this short feature to be approachable enough for kids, but still sharp enough to keep me laughing without being over-the-top.

The animation and characterizations live up to the standards set in the first film, but Shrek the Halls offers a completely new story with a new message. While the running time is under 30 minutes, you are left feeling as though it was created with the same care and attention as a full length feature.

3461925,4,B001AQT112,"I remember several years back when Shrek the Halls came on TV not being super impressed with it.  Even for this franchise, the bathroom humor was a little over the top for me.  However, I recently decided to give it a second chance, and I enjoyed it more.

Christmas is coming, and everyone but Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers) is excited.  Heck, Donkey (Eddie Murphy) has been counting down since July.  When Fiona (Cameron Diaz) mentions that it will be the first Christmas with the triplets, so their first Christmas as a family, Shrek suddenly feels the pressure to create the perfect Christmas.  But since this is also the first time hes celebrated Christmas, can he do it?  And what will happen when their friends show up to crash the holiday?

Now I know that this franchise has always had its share of bathroom humor.  The main character is an ogre who lives in a swamp and loves all things gross and smelly after all.  Even so, this half hour special seems to focus on it a bit more than needed.  Usually in the movies those jokes get less as the movie advances.  Here, its just too short to focus on other things.

Still, you have to admire the creativity of the writers and animators who come up with some clever versions of classic Christmas staples for Shrek and Fiona to enjoy.  Even I had to smile as some of them, and kids will really laugh at the special.

Speaking of which, there are some great jokes that kids will get, but their parents will enjoy their own set of laughs.  The writers have done a good job of layering the humor so everyone will enjoy it.

Being a Christmas special, there has to be some heart warming moments, and this special has those as well.  The moral is rather obvious early on, but it is still nice to see Shrek be reminded of what is important, even if he claims to not like family or friends.

The voice cast from the movies is back for this special, and they do a great job as always.  Many of the secondary characters are here as well, so there isn't room for any big names to show up who aren't part of the normal cast, but you don't really need them.  The regulars are all you need.

The animation is great as well.  This may be a TV special, but youll still enjoy animation in keeping with the franchise.

So if you enjoy the antics of Shrek and his friends, youll want to Shrek the Halls this Christmas season.  It may not be a classic Christmas special, but it is still fun.

NOTE: I gave this a second chance since I got it as part of the Dreamworks Holiday Collection DVD pack, which I received in exchange for my honest review.",1434067200,,2581,4.336116910229645

3462003,3,B001AQT112,"This Christmas special takes place after the events of SHREK THE THIRD. Shrek and Fiona are happily raising their babies, but Donkey keeps bugging Shrek about getting ready for Christmas. Shrek has never celebrated Christmas before and doesnt plan on doing so until he finds out Fiona is looking forward to it and Shrek unexpectedly promises Fiona a Christmas surprise. Shrek races into town on Christmas Eve to get a book from the book seller to find out what Christmas is about and then sets out to make a wonderful family Christmas for Fiona and the kids. However, he informs Donkey of his plans and son Donkey and many of the other fairy tale creatures that are a part of Shreks extended family invade their home for a Christmas party. A time of storytelling and mayhem ensues.

The animation is good and the vocal talents from the Shrek movies do the voices of their respective characters. However, I didn't find the special to be as funny or entertaining as some of the other Shrek specials. I was also discouraged that the special didn't focus much on the giving aspect of the season (family is the big catch word in the special). Also, the special is rather short with a total running time of about 23 minutes. Despite this, I did enjoy watching it and found it somewhat entertaining.

My kids enjoy the 1960s stop-animation movies narrated by Burl Ives: The Land Of Misfit Toys and such.  THOSE are the classics!

3462059,2,B001AQT112,"As usual this movie had its witty writing and mostly typical character responses to keep it entertaining, but it isn't going to be a holiday favorite in my house. I love the Shrek movies (Shrek 3 being an exception) and I was going by previous reviews to decide whether I should shell out the bucks to buy this movie. Many reviewers said it was overpriced. It is. I thought the 30 minutes would be valuable, but they weren't; it was definitely rushed. Fiona's response to Shrek's anger over having their first Christmas crashed by their rowdy, obnoxious friends was more annoying than usual because it was overly dramatic and makes her character look weak, in my opinion. Overall, I'd advise you to pass on purchasing this movie for more than $5. And you can definitely find better movies than this out there for $5 if you know where to look.",1322006400,,842,4.62

3462111,4,B001AQT112,"Shrek wants to celebrate Christmas, but has no idea how to do it.  While he is trying to learn the facts about having Christmas, his friends and family are just making it happen.

Things get crazier and crazier until Shrek finally loses his temper and orders everyone out of his house.

When Shrek loses his temper, and alienates everyone, will he be able to have a merry Christmas?

This is the basic plot in a nutshell.  It's great to see the beloved Shrek characters again, in a different venue than a full length movie.

I'd give the special itself 4 stars, but the DVD only 3 stars.  Below is why:

Even though I enjoyed seeing the Christmas special, I would like to see more Shrek holiday specials on the same DVD.  It's a fun special to watch and a good addition to the Christmas classics list, but by itself it isn't a great value at $20 or so.

Put simply:  Most DVDs provide more than 22 minutes of entertainment.  Even if they have short cartoons (think the Bugs Bunny DVDs or the Animatrix), they pack the DVD with far more than 22 minutes of material.

I'd say wait for it to come on TV and tape (or DVR) it.  It's definitely worth seeing, but a 22 minute DVD shouldn't cost anywhere near what a full feature length movie costs.

If there were another holiday special or two on it (Halloween or Thanksgiving anyone?), with the same quality and humor put into this one, it'd be well worth the money.  But, until then, it's a bit pricey.

However, the special itself is excellent, and may be worth your purchase if you love Shrek.",1279497600,,1541,4.407801418439717

All the favorite characters are back to celebrate Christmas, and watching Shrek struggle to learn what Christmas is all about with constant interruptions from the usual suspects makes for a delightful watching experience.

My husband and I just looked at each other as if waiting for the punchline. After a minute or two we realized that maybe this was it.

People who are really upset at the price have a reason to be so; but they should have checked the film length before buying.  Also that has nothing to do with the quality of this holiday special.

This is a great show.  It is very high quality, is funny on numerous levels.  Both adults and children will find it highly entertaining.  Watching Shrek and Fiona decorate for the holidays is a blast.  There is a moral to the story too.

My personal favorite part is where Puss n' Boots tells his version of the Christmas story and get very distracted.

My husband and I have probably watched this 5 or 6 times by ourselves in the last couple years and my son has watched it 3 or 4 times this year.  My son is almost 2 and this show is the perfect length for him.  He thinks donkey is hilarious and he was rolling over with laughter at Puss N' Boots.

I would recommend either recording it on your Tivo or DVR (it's been on TV a couple times this year too) or waiting until you can buy it cheaper used.  But definitely watch it, it's a Christmas classic that I am thrilled to make part of our yearly tradition.",1229385600,5,1251,4.179916317991632
3462199,4,B001AQT112,"Three and a half stars for SHREK THE HALLS.

What the moneymakers are counting on is that, come the holidays, this short film about Shrek celebrating Christmas and mucking it up will prove too irresistible to pass up, especially if you have kids who are bigtime Shrek fans. Yes, for its asking price (currently set at $11.99) and with the film's running time of 28 minutes or so, SHREK THE HALLS isn't really worth shelling out for, especially since it's bound to decrease if you just ride it out. But, man, it's Christmas time right now. So, me, I shelled out.

If you want to get really nitpicky, the film is 28 minutes but the story proper only takes up around 22 minutes, with extensive end credits. Chronology wise, SHREK THE HALLS takes place sometime after SHREK THE THIRD and, presumably, before the upcoming SHREK GOES FOURTH. The story itself is routine but likable. It explores the Christmasy themes very well, but thru Shrek's ever cranky viewpoint. Like Jack Skellington before him, Shrek isn't too up on Christmas and its meaning and traditions, instead having to rely on the how-to book Christmas for Village Idiots. Still, he prepares for a quiet Christmas evening with Fiona and their three adorable ogre infants. But his raucous friends aren't about to be left out. Cue the expected shenanigans, and Shrek's inevitable temper tantrum.

While, with each successive entry, the Shrek franchise has continued to lose its edginess, it hasn't completely done away with those tiny subversive touches. To me, this movie's highlight is the Gingerbread Man's disturbing (though hilarious) interpretation of Santa Claus. And, I know it's just a cartoon, but it's gratifying watching Shrek engaged in domestic bliss and hanging out with his kids. Another neat thing going on is that the key voice actors reprise their roles for this TV special (I'm thinking, there must've been a proviso in Myers, Diaz, Murphy, and Banderas's contracts). And, no worries, the animation features the same excellent quality found in the Shrek feature films.

The DVD gives you the option of viewing the film either in widescreen or full frame. Special Features include: The ""12 Days of Christmas"" & ""Deck the Halls"" Sing Alongs; Gingy's Dunking Game challenges the kids to pick out the cookies in the batch most closely resembling the Gingerbread Man; upon installation of the Shrek Carnival Craze Video Game Demo, the kids can indulge in three fun activities: Royal Hoopla (a javelin toss), The Melon Bowl (bowling game), and Three-Wheeled Thrills (a tricycle race); the Animation Video Jukebox lets you play back musical scenes pulled from DreamWorks films like the SHREK films, THE BEE MOVIE, A SHARK'S TALE, etc. (the best, if you ask me, is Donkey and Puss in Boots covering ""Living La Vida Loca"").

SHREK THE HALLS debuted as an ABC holiday special on November of '07 and, as expected, it killed on the Nielsen ratings. But, you have to ask yourself, is the DVD worth the asking price? I doubt it. If you wait long enough, SHREK THE HALLS will probably be released as part of a SHREK package. That's the one to jump on. But, to assist the indecisive consumer, know that there's a dancing roast turkey in the film, and that the Gingerbread Man poops. If that's any kind of incentive.",1229126400,,3276,4.884892086330935

3462220,4,B001AQT112,"$11 at Wal-Mart I thought was reasonable considering it is the Christmas season. Who didn't see this DVD hitting the shelves this season after last season's TV kick off of this newest Shrek installment? This DVD will be in the $5 rack after Christmas not because it's bad but it is seasonal.

With that being said, when I watched STH's last year initially I thought it was hilarious, and witty with the same style of comedy Shrek is known for. A lot of funny stuff was put into the 30 minute program and I like that because it speeds up the good times and gives you a lot of bang for the buck. If you like the other 3 Shrek movies this one will be no disappointment. I DVR'd it last year and my 2 1/2 year old daughter also loves it about literally 50X's worth. Very enjoyable and worth the price of admission................",1227657600,,825,4.357142857142857
3462221,2,B001AQT112,Oaky the movie itself was not that bad it is shrek after all so it has to be good. I was looking forwarded to adding this to the other movies for a complete shrek collection. But I felt the story was rushed and should have been extended to make it worthy of the other movies & worth paying for. I got it on sale for $13.99 and even that was TOO much to pay for only a 22min show! It should have been cheaper or the movie should have been longer.,1227484800,,445,3.901098901098901
3462222,5,B001AQT112,I would give this 4 stars because of the price but the movie is just to good. I wish it was a little longer. Great story and I'm glad to finally have it since it was accidentally deleted from my DVR.,1226793600,,199,3.8780487804878048
3462223,1,B001AQT112,"I was very disappointed in this DVD. I've really enjoyed all of the other Shrek movies. Without even mentioning the price, the movie can't even be called a ""movie.""

3462224,3,B001AQT112,There was a scary scene with Santa and Gingey that pretty much ruined an otherwise enjoyable and authentically Shrek video.  Really little ones will be completely confused and possibly frightened by it.,1226620800,,202,5.3125
3462225,2,B001AQT112,"I have to put in my five cents on this and echo the fact that:

1. $17.99 is too much money for 22 mins of cartoon
2. $11.99 is too much money for 22 mins of cartoon
3. Shrek already has a bad enough reputation due to parts 2 & 3.
4. This 22 min EPISODE of Shrek will be on TV endlessly this year.
5. And the next year, and the next year, and the next .... sigh.
6. It's already available on youtube. Please, Dreamworks.
7. While the story is 'fair', but not great, this is just pandering all the way around.
8. A one-hour special wouldn't have killed them or strained Dreamworks resources in the slightest.
9. It's an EPISODE and not a movie and shouldn't be priced like a film at all. $5.99 would've been appropriate.
10. This would've been included as a freebie or an additional disk if they would've released 'Shrek Goes Forth'.

Please make sure you read reviews of the movie when making your decision about watching/purchasing. This is not the forum for complaints about pricing.

This should have been an addition to a re relese of the Shrek films and not a separate release by itself. Also, abrupt edits.  Doesn't transistion well from scene to scene.  Not worth the price.

As usually Shrek keeps you laughing.  I purchased this movie expecting over an hour of entertainment.  I was disappointed when it ended in 22 minutes.  I guess it's my fault for not reading the package before buying the DVD; but I figured for the price that it had to be full length.  The kids loved it and will watch it over and over.  Would have been nice if it were longer.",1225843200,,564,6.075949367088608
