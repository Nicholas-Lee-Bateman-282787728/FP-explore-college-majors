8466268,5,B005D4I9MO,"This is a low impact exercise in which you stretch and go through a range of movements without going to the point of pain or the ""burn"". It is perfect for the older person, or a person who has physical problems such as my wife.
There is an emphasis on relaxation and calming of the body through the mind. I don't think anyone ever did it as well as Satya Khouri. She is an absolute ""master"" in this area. She could literally talk me into going to sleep on a 1 inch mat on a concrete floor within minutes. I was often embarrassed when my wife had to wake me up. I am one of those folks who CANNOT sleep anywhere except in my own bed. I do not, because I can't take naps of any kind. No sleeping in a chair or car seat - nothing like that until I met this delightful woman.
My wife at the time was suffering terribly with Fibromyalgia and slept but short periods at night because of her body pain. She was always sleep deprived and this may have exacerbated the fibromyalgia. On learning how to relax her body and mind with techniques learned from Satya Khouri, she was able to go home and lie in bed and relax to the point that it was a life-saver. She was able to sleep like a normal person. She felt so much better and she became more productive and happy.
I don't know if Satya ever realized how much of a ""God-send"" she was. We had gone to doctor after doctor, and we ended up on the floor of the Senior Center in Fullerton Calif where in my opinion, her ""life was saved"" by Satya and the methods she taught. All the doctors and all the pills had no impact compared to Satya.
A belated ""Thank You"".
