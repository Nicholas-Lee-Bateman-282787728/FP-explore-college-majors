8500311,5,B006LAOF1S,"I have the anime and two live versions of this manga (did not read the manga, though, so I cannot tell how close or far the anime and live versions are from the original manga). The anime version is the best. The two live versions are not convincing, in my opinion, because of the actors - they try but do not get even close to the characters in the anime.

So, talking about Kotoko from the anime version: yes, she has no brains, and is all heart. But she has something that pushes her beyond her ""handicap"": determination, strength to fight for what she wants and knowing to stop when it is the most honorable thing to do.

i saw another review in which the reviewer says there's nothing in common between Kotoko and Naoki. That may be true at the beginning of the story, while the characters are introduced. But as the episodes go further, you start finding that, in fact, in matters of love, cerebral brightness (good brain) is the actual ""handicap"". And Kotoko, with her fierce determination and courage (yes, she has no brains and is all heart and soul) opens Naoki to a complete new world and once exposed to that, he finally sees how great she is in her apparent ""dumbness"".

I don't know if the other reviewers are familiar with Japanese (at this point, I have to say that the English subtitle does not make justice to the Japanese dialogues) but the dialogues are the essential part to understanding what is happening. The subtleties and nuances of the language...

SPOILER HERE!!!
There are really beautiful monologues by Kotoko, e.g. when she falls asleep crying with her love letter in her hands... I think that's when Naoki really fell for her. Or when Naoki explains to Non-Chan that ""90% of what I can do, Kotoko cannot; but the 10% I cannot, somehow Kotoko manages to get"" - looses a lot in English, sorry...

In fact, Kotoko vaguely reminds me Barbra Streisand in ""The Way We Were"". The only difference being that Barbra plays a character that is driven by her political views, whereas Kotoko is only driven by her heart and soul - and her love for Naoki....",1390608000,,2076,4.554959785522788
8500312,3,B006LAOF1S,"This is a romantic comedy where the not too bright (to put it kindly) main character Motoko is madly in love with Naoki, the top student in the school.  Due to a disaster where her home is destroyed, she ends up staying in the same house as Naoki, since their fathers are old school buddies.  The parents of both of the kids are all for the relationship, as is Motoko.  Naoki is less than enthusiastic.  It is based off of the manga by Tada Kaoru.

The series has its enjoyable parts, with the usual love triangles found in shoujo.  The problem comes with the two main characters.  Motoko has no brain, life or ambition of her own.  Her entire world is centered around Naoki.  Naoki is cold, arrogant, and treats Motoko very badly.  It is hard to understand what they see in each other since they have nothing in common.  If you want to see the sort of story where the nice girl falls for the cold guy, Hana Yori Dango is a better story.

Spoiler alert:

One good thing about this is that it continues the story after the characters are married.  This is unusual in romance stories, and I liked that a lot.  This keeps the review at three stars instead of two.",1344470400,,1160,4.330232558139535
8500313,5,B006LAOF1S,I have seen both the live-action and this anime. I like the anime but the live-action sticks more to the manga. I have also seen the korean version of this and it also sticks to the manga but a few twists here and there. It sad thing is that the author of the manga didn't finish it for she passed away and it actually end as we would have like it to finish. But overall it is very funny and very entertaining.,1341792000,6,410,4.012195121951219
