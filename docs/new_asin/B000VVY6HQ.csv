8220225,5,B000VVY6HQ,"My Father was absolutely riveted, his eyes glued to the screen as he absorbed and stimulated memories of his time on the Randolph.  This was one of the best gifts I have gotten and this series is highly recommended for anyone who has a relative who has served on a ship in the US Navy.  Even for me this was incredibly interesting as I had no idea some of the involvement of his ship later in the space program and he did not even know some of her amazing history before he served on her.  I expect every US ship has amazing stories to tell and just wish I had found this series before my Uncle died.",1526342400,,600,4.111111111111111

8220228,5,B000VVY6HQ,"I was attached to VS-36 sub hunters in the early to mid 60's aboard the USS  Randolph.  I found the DVD to be as
expected.  I received it on time as was stated.  The video brought back a lot of shipboard memories of my ol' Navy
days.  It is a welcome addition to my military library, just a little closer to home than most.  Thank you very much.  ""T""
