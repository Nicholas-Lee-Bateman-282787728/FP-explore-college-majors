Now its blue ray and still looking great and fun.  Yes story line was simple, but kung-fu ballet not bad and non stop action. Simple nice B category HK movie.",1434585600,,287,4.107142857142857
8268663,5,B00187618O,"As a collector of hong kong cinema. This is a classic! If you like sam hui and ti lung then this film is for you. Also known as legend of the golden pearl. This is the extended,original language version in widescreen. The other version is the international dubbed version which is not as good. The film itself is part sci-fi, martial arts and action, mixing international locations with humor in the vain of the golden child an indy jones. Highly recommended.",1374451200,,459,4.679012345679013
8268664,3,B00187618O,"It is my understanding that there are numerous Chinese books about Wisely. I discovered him by a chance rental of the Seventh Curse, which was excellent in a cheesy, exploitative way. After that, I was able to rent Bury Me High, which was stubbornly dull. Now, finally, I purchased Legend of Wisely, and found it somewhere between the two in terms of interest.

It tells the story of a society of monks (described once as evil, then never again) whose religion is based on a round object they call the Dragon's Pearl, which legend says is a dragon egg. An acquaintance of Wisely, an globetrotting author/adventurer, steals the pearl, which kicks the plot in motion. There's a lot of activity, but not what I would call coherent action, in the first half of the movie.

The Legend of Wisely comes to life at the 42-minute mark with a nifty car chase, and at the end, when the factions all come together in the monks' icy Nepalese temple for an at-times literally cliffhanging, apocalyptic finale with pretty decent effects. But the rest of the time the action is uncreative and redundant. For example, a jeep/camel chase in the Egyptian desert is followed up immediately by another jeep chase. Neither are especially thrilling, but at least there are far-flung locales.

It's perhaps not fair to compare The Seventh Curse to Legend of Wisely; Seventh Curse is Indiana Jones meets Army of Darkness, whereas The Legend of Wisely is Indiana Jones meets nothing, really, except a lower budget. In the Seventh Curse there are at least five sequences that make you go ""What the--?!?"" in joy merged with disgust, and in The Legend of Wisely at least that many sequences make you shrug nonplussed. Only the climax really made me sit up and take notice.

If you have a strong stomach and are ready to experience Hong Kong movie weirdness, I would check out The Seventh Curse. Then I would lower your expectations by about half and give this one a try, if you can find it inexpensively.",1305072000,,1975,4.715942028985507
