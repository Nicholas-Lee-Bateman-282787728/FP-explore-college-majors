8130032,5,B000GALHQ0,"This DVD may not be for everyone, but as an aspiring screenwriter, it was invaluable.  I read a lot of interviews with writers but seeing Goyer on video really gives you a sense of who he is and the voice that he brings to his movies.  When you see the tattoos and hear about his early aspirations to be a homicide detective, it's no wonder he brought out the dark side of Batman.  And it was cool to hear how he worked with Christopher Nolan to reinvent that franchise.  This is definitely not a James Lipton, ""look how great you are"" kind of interview.  It's much smarter than that -- grittier.  Of course, you get the usual war stories, but they really focus on the process of writing - where ideas come from, the process of putting them to paper, what to do when you actually finish your script.  As a writer, I highly recommend it.",1159488000,,836,4.32051282051282
8130033,3,B000GALHQ0,"I was excited to see this series, but disappointed in the overall product.  This was made by ""film people,"" and the setting, the interview, the style...boring.  This was the fault of the interviewer and production and editing staff, not the writer.  But that's the packaging.  David Goyer had some interesting and fun information, but nothing that shook my world.  There were a few items that David Goyer touched on that were helpful: The subplot in Batman Begins and how they developed it along with the image of a giant bat.  How he writes ""angst"" into his charachters and another was of Superman being Jesus Christ...God sending his son to earth to save the humans.

The best part of the interview was the little excercise where the writer is presented with a novel object that he, on the spot, has to create a backstory and bring it to life.

I felt the interviewer and his questions created the tone of this interview and he was stiff and distant and he should be replaced. A seasoned interviewer could have really brought out the magic that is obviously in this writer but remained hidden in this interview.

I like this idea and I will give another ""interview"" a chance.

I hope there is more substance in the next one.",1157760000,,1226,4.6342592592592595
