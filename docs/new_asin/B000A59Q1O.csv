8074615,2,B000A59Q1O,"THE BEAST BOX consists of three ""horror"" films, ranging from so-so to sub-zero in quality. BRIDE OF THE GORILLA is the best of the trio, which isn't saying much! Raymond Burr stars as a man named Chavez, who is turned into the title groom, after being cursed for murdering his boss. Co-stars Lon Chaney Jr. as the investigating police commissioner, Taro. Fairly dull, but has some interesting characters, like the old witch who puts the hex on Chavez. BELA LUGOSI MEETS A BROOKLYN GORILLA- Bela stars as mad scientist, Dr. Zabor, along w/ a pair of 'funny-as-a-kick-in-the-face"", Martin and Lewis impersonators, in this lamentable jungle epic. Supposedly a ""comedy"", nothing remotely chuckle-inducing takes place. THE BEACH GIRLS AND THE MONSTER- Bikini-clad beach girls dance, wiggle, and gyrate their way into our hearts. Uh-oh! A walleyed monster kills one of our beach bunnies! Alas, that's the only action until near the end. Neither the bongo-drums nor the ""shock"" finale can save this pile of cinematic fish flop! Makes HORROR OF PARTY BEACH appear ""ingeniously subtle"" by comparison. This BOX should remain unopened...",1441497600,,1126,5.226519337016574

8074617,5,B000A59Q1O,"Absolutely superb prints of all three films and what a low cost! Image Entertainment have done an amazing job with this three Disc set. Nice packaging, trailers for all three films, crisp clear visual and audio quality. Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla (1952) features a very informative and at times emotional twelve minute interview with Sammy Pertrillo from 2001. He speaks candidly of his career, Bela Lugosi and....Jerry Lewis...
The Beach Girls And the Monster (1965) was Jon Hall's final screen performance, he also directs. Frank Sinatra Jr. supplies the music and the print is in the 1.85:1 ratio.

Bride Of The Gorilla (1951) features Barbara Payton Lon Chaney, Jr. ,Tom Conway and Raymond Burr. All three films are what you might expect from the subject matter.
In all a fine example of how to release rare films in an entertaining and enjoyable fashion. Well done Image Entertainment!",1281571200,9,900,5.040268456375839
