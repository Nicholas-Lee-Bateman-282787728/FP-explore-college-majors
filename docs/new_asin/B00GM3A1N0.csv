6085956,2,B00GM3A1N0,Simple plot.  Waste of lead actor.  Nothing objectionable.  The nudity was natural.  A disappointment.,1465171200,,102,6.071428571428571
6085957,5,B00GM3A1N0,My favorite nudist film of all time! I liked the actors and actresses. Enough said. Get it while you can.,1450137600,7,105,4.3

6085959,2,B00GM3A1N0,I watched this movie on Amazon Prime video and it appeared to be a chopped up version from the original movie which IMDB lists as a 90 minute film but this was just over an hour. The video quality was not very good and some scenes appeared to have been chopped off either at the beginning or the end or completely omitted which made following the story (such as it was) difficult. There was some brief nudist camp nudity but the main stars were never seen nude other than the actress who played the sister-in-law.,1502064000,9,513,4.410526315789474
6085960,3,B00GM3A1N0,"Since this was made back in (possibly) the 60's, it's okay for that time era. Not much different then Frankie and Annette films, but the music is tacky and so is the story. I only made it to the half way mark before shutting it off.",1501977600,,232,4.065217391304348
6085961,5,B00GM3A1N0,"For those who love old movie and nudism, this is a great combination! I'm glad I found it.",1501977600,2,90,4.055555555555555
6085962,1,B00GM3A1N0,"(yawn)  The film feels like it was shot in a weekend, or maybe even in a single day, using someone's home movies of nudists splashing around in a pool (the same shot is used about a half dozen times), a ""story"" built around those home movies, and some c-list actors shot exclusively from the waist up.  Not sexy, just boring.  Take out the brief nudity and it's an episode of Gidget.",1501891200,5,383,4.366197183098592
6085963,1,B00GM3A1N0,Wouldn't waste my time. Would like to give it zero stars.,1501804800,,57,4.2727272727272725

6085965,5,B00GM3A1N0,"A golden oldie. By today's standards, blas. In its time, avant-garde. I found it to be cute, almost funny. The plot is predictable, but characters well-played. Be prepared to suspend belief: a 70 year-old Victorian prude becomes a nudist aficionado in one afternoon, etc. What makes this movie interesting is an illustration of tolerance for diversity, others' beliefs, and live-and-let live. An avant-garde retro notion for many ""progressives"" who aren't. Also features rock and roll music, singing, dancing, and other period treats.",1501286400,5,534,5.524390243902439

6085968,5,B00GM3A1N0,It is a really fun movie if you are inclined to like this sort of thing.,1482710400,3,72,3.5625
8624430,3,B00GM3A1N0,"Cute movie, not much substance and precious little skin to look at :-(
Made back in the early 60s, when pubic hair was forbidden.
The man who played the lead seemed embarrassed to even be there, but the female lead (Shelly Martin) was definitely cute as a button.",1523491200,,263,4.5
8624431,2,B00GM3A1N0,"Two stars are not for the movie itself but for this copy of it. For whatever reason this copy is missing more than 30 minutes of the film. I see a lot of negative reviews, but honestly a third of the movie is a lot missing to fairly judge it on.",1521072000,,245,3.823529411764706

8624434,4,B00GM3A1N0,"Very British, but better than the exploitative crap that Doris Wishman in the U.S in the same era. Here, we have conflict, but once again, of the stiff upper lip kind. Real anti-nudists get into heated arguments, get the authorities involved and sometimes cause parents to lose custody of their children. Here, the conflict is subdued but it's there, and it's more than was ever dramatized in this period.

I am aware that much of the nudity had to be cut for Amazon's ""standards."" More is the pity since I was never convinced of Mrs. Robinson's transformation and sudden sympathy for the nudists. I feel like it had been written by naturists and that was where it fails, because real naturists don't always see both sides of the equation.

Still, I found this film entertaining and informative. It captured an era that no longer exists in modern day nudism, as much of nudism takes place outside the resorts. I only wished that this film had inspired a trend of more dramatic takes on naturists to tell their real stories, because we surely do not have much that represents us.",1508112000,2,1078,4.698412698412699
8624435,1,B00GM3A1N0,Curious film from the fifties.  Not that what you'd call a high budget film.,1506556800,,76,4.428571428571429
8624436,2,B00GM3A1N0,"The amazon video version lacks nudity except for stock footage that is interminably re-used and re-used again. Again a movie in which nudists never get naked. The one thing about this movie is that it has a love triangle romance going for it. Still not really well done. For some reason this is a censored version, great care is taken not to show breasts. IMDB lists it at 90 minutes this is just over an hour. Apparently this is the only version available, but if you want to see the actors naked you can search for this movie. I am so glad I have Prime and don't have to pay directly for this dren.",1506038400,2,600,4.271929824561403
8624437,2,B00GM3A1N0,A silly little story.  Not much to look at there.  LOL,1503100800,,54,3.8181818181818183
8624438,4,B00GM3A1N0,"I didn't notice the year the film was made, or I might not have tried it, but that ended up being the most endearing thing about it.  When it opened, and I saw the early production values, I then became intrigued at how they would handle the nudity.  They handled it perfectly.  Lots of naked bums and breasts, but no penises or vaginas, all just enjoying good clean fun.  It's a really sweet movie, if not a bit too predicable.  But for that time, it must have been pretty avant-guard.  I agree with another reviewer, that this print seems to have several edits that somewhat break the continuity, but overall, it's a good watch.  And, I think the messages of 'tolerance' and 'live and let live' are even more important today.",1502064000,2,727,4.5038167938931295
