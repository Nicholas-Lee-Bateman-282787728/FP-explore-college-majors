8026804,5,B0002DRDKU,This film required a bit of effort to stay with it during the first 10 minutes - after that - impossible NOT to stay until the end.  Good courtroom/mob genre film with very strong performances.  Much better film than some reviewers on other sites would indicate.  Enjoyable and entertaining movie.,1467849600,,297,4.9

8026808,5,B0002DRDKU,"This is a really good mob type movie that shouldn't be overlooked. Danny Aiello is excellent once again as the big bad boss
of the mob who is pretending he's trying to go straight. He hires a former prosecutor who has been after him but after losing a
big case resigns and takes a job at a law firm that represents the mob and his forced to take a case defending the mob! His
brother is an x-con and involved in dope and it all winds up in a heated battle at the end with a great ending. The story is well
written and Aiello plays his character to the max and the entire cast is really good. Just another great movie passed by I guess
straight to video which is where I found it so I can say if this dvd is any good but the movie itself is a winner.",1409184000,,749,3.9342105263157894
8026809,4,B0002DRDKU,Interesting story of the power of the underworld / mob's ability to currupt the innocent.  Danny plays his part to perfection.,1383955200,,126,5.0
