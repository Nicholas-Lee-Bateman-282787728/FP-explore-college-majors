7900620,4,7885729575,"Illiterate Kihachi is not a good father to his son, and, as an older man, he foolishly pursues a young girl. This is a Japanese silent comedy with some unusual, funny moments and with a bit of pathos built in. Its a very engaging film, and well worth watching.",1487030400,,260,4.326530612244898
7900621,5,7885729575,"An Inn in Tokyo very movingly depicts the drudgery and depression that follows a father and his two young sons as he searches for a job. Trudging along, knowing the hunger his sons feel, the father somehow keeps alive the hope that he will find work. The older son (Tomio Aoki) nudges him on. It is through the immense kindness of an old friend that, when desperation turns to heartbreak, a way is found through to some small employment, food, and a place to stay. There is a heroism in this story in that, having so narrowly escaped a very sad ending,the father extends his compassion to an even more desperate mother and child leading to an event that makes the tenuous foothold out of danger break down. This could be an unbearable film to watch but Ozu infuses his characters with such humanity and even humor that the viewer comes away feeling a stronger belief in the goodness of people. The consequences fall to the father who sacrifices his gains to help another. Ozu is careful to find a resolution of sorts for the small boys. Sad enough what the father goes through, the boys will be cared for. With careful restoration we are priviledged to be able to see an early Ozu film heretofore available to only a few.",1280016000,10,1221,4.529411764705882

7900623,5,7885729575,"This is, without a doubt, one of Ozu's unsung masterpieces & a film that requires immediate viewing from all cinephiles who enjoy his other, more well known, works; not only that, but it is simply one of the best silent films I've ever seen, with performances that are beyond phenomenal (the children are just as above par as the adults), and it's also just one of the best films I've ever seen period. A man struggles for about 1/2 the film to find any kind of resources to feed his two boys, and it is this masterful depiction of poverty and its effects on the psyche that lead me to believe that this is one of the finest silent films, and film in general, that I've ever seen or am likely to see.",1261440000,10,700,4.2706766917293235
