Each of the CD's 8 songs has been masterfully rendered as a stand alone music video, and all eight have then been woven together into a mesmerizing and sometimes disturbing glimpse into Matt Johnson's imagination. While originally made in 1986, this work transcends the ""80's"" and works great today. The track 'Sweet Bird of Truth' with it's view on war in the middle east, seems even more relevant in today's world.
With vivid images to go along with the vivid lyrics, this is a very entertaining presentation, that will make you want to dance, sing along, and think. Despite the serious nature of the work, you get a sense that Matt doesn't take his work too seriously, because there are many amusing things to look and listen for. I must admit, many a drunken times were spent listening to certain songs on the CD, and I still have strong feelings when I listen to them now.
How can you miss with lyrics like these:
From Mombasa to Miami
Beirut to Bangladesh
I've flown around the world
Standing on the wing of a jet
Tryin' to salvage my emotions
From the bottom of the oceans
Y'see I sold my soul
To pay for my dinner
My stomach grew fatter
But my heart grew thinner
I ain't fooling I'm falling
I wasn't wicked just weak
I ain't lying I'm dying
Crippled by deceit",1043280000,4,1522,4.400709219858156
7963638,4,6301426975,The music and subsequent video see the the at their eclectic best. This is Matt Johnson's finest work and was for mine the album of the eighties. The title song 'infected' summed up the mood of love in the 80's with the  advent of aids. Neneh Cherry makes a worthy addition in 'slow train to  dawn'. All in all an album/video that should be in every collection.,958521600,,361,4.373134328358209
