8051947,4,B0007US85W,"This documentary has solid information, but is simply a DVD made of VHS content which was just lectures to begin with.  I myself just rented this, and have no desire to own a copy of this rather condensed and incomplete presentation. It is worth watching however, but not for the purchase price.",1279152000,,295,4.673076923076923
8051948,1,B0007US85W,"This doc is very dissappointing. Instead of an (expected) animated, good quality, with many scenes from the ancient sites and nicely told story, this is purely JUST a lecture starring on dvd 1: Graham Hancock, and on DVD 2 Robert Bauval in their EARLY years. The lecture is also incomplete. It ends abrubtly. This low quality video was original on VHS and, by the looks of it, digitallised by an amature. Do not buy this dvd if you think you are buying something like ""the mystery of the sphinx"" or ""the great year"". Also there is nothing new here if you have read the books.",1224201600,6,575,4.485714285714286
8051949,1,B0007US85W,"I am a fan of both Graham Hancock and Robert Bauval and was excited about this video but, unfortunately, the video was simply a taping of a lecture they gave which contained nothing that hadn't been in their books and contained no good visuals. The production quality was not good either. It gave the impression of having been made in someone's garage. Worst of all though was the continual reference to some information about the Sphinx that would be given at the end of the lecture and that was missing in its entirety. The whole viewing experience was frustrating and aggravating and I'm annoyed that the disk cost as much as something professionally made. I think Mssrs. Hancock and Bauval should withdraw this video from the market. It is much below the level of quality of their books.",1212451200,12,791,4.739130434782608
8051950,5,B0007US85W,"Great stone monuments having to do with stars are all over the world. The monuments in Giza are the big daddies.

When you watch this you'll learn that although they hardly have any writing whatsoever they speak volumes through their construction and planetary alignments.

You'll also learn that the ""air shafts"" are not for air conditioning, and they are not tombs, like the surface student of these architectural wonders would have you believe (my kids school textbooks for example).

There are only two drawbacks -- the laser pointer used in the video can't be seen during the lecture, and with so many star charts, sometimes it's hard to know what the lecturers are referring to.

Also there's supposed to be included a special Sphinx video which isn't included. Total cliff hanger. Where the heck is the extra video???",1204243200,6,824,4.949275362318841
