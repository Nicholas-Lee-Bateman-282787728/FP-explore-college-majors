8271480,5,B0018ZRKWW,"I have all 4 America By Rail DVDs, but this one is, by far, my favorite! Ever since I watched it, I started dreaming about riding Amtrak's Southwest Chief on its entire cross-country run from Chicago to Los Angeles and I still hope to live that dream.",1486166400,,251,4.361702127659575

8271482,3,B0018ZRKWW,"Southern California sites receive some attention. I liked the Orange Empire RR Museum scenes, with the Pacific Electric car. We should have kept that route. Sad to say, it was gone by the early 1960s. You can see one of the few remaining PE cars in this film.

Knotts Berry Farm has two old authentic steam locomotives, brought to Knotts in 1952, as one of their first tourist attractions. They are working engines from the old Denver, Rio Grande, and Western (or Southern) line. Engine 340, built by Baldwin in Philadelphia, 1881, runs daily. Engine 41 runs when 340 is in for repair. The engineers at Knotts were trained by the former DRG and W engineers, and are happy to tell you about their work.

Another area site, Angels Flight in L.A., received only a few seconds of footage. This short line (very short!) ran for 67 years before moving. It deserved more than a few seconds. Huell Howser found it worth an hour program, and Michael Connelly wrote an entire book-- Angels Flight.

If you like to look at operating passenger trains, you will like this film.",1369526400,3,1064,4.648936170212766
8271483,4,B0018ZRKWW,I am planning on taking an amtrak trip from chicago to la and wanted a preview. This video was great for seeing some of the station stops along the route. The only thing I didn't like was The music instead of being able to hear the actual train sounds as others have stated. Also wished they would have showed more detailed views of the sleeping compartments. I was also glad they included the tourist railroads. because I am interested in riding some of those also.,1260662400,4,466,4.4941176470588236
