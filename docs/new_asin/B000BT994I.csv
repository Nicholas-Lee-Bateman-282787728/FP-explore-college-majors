2440108,1,B000BT994I,AFter seeing the movie I would not recommend this DVD.. I was very disappointed,1168473600,,79,4.714285714285714
2440109,4,B000BT994I,My daughter just loves Curious George.  This is a wonderful dvd but some of the scenes are outdated...I guess they were produced from old scenes since this is a 65th anniversary dvd.  I still think it is wonderful entertainment for kids and teaches them good lessons.,1168300800,3,267,4.782608695652174
2440110,5,B000BT994I,This was the perfect gift!! My 3 yr old son can never get enough ( as much as i have)lol Curious George every day too many times but makes him happy! :),1151452800,6,152,3.78125
2440111,4,B000BT994I,"I wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing this DVD.

Even though my three year old daughter loves it, I was expecting

a Curious George DVD. Now I will have to make another purchase to get just a Curious George DVD.  I will definately start reading the reviews before making a purchase.",1150588800,14,299,4.5
2440112,5,B000BT994I,"Ever since my son saw Curious George at the theater, he's been into the whole George scene. He has a stuffed George, the PS2 game, several books (one based on the movie and two from H.A. Rey), etc.

When he saw this DVD at the store, he wanted it (of course). It was very affordable, so I bought it for him.

I was VERY surprised to find out that, despite the illustrations on the box, it is NOT an animated film or collection of animated stories. It's not even stills of the Rey books with voice actors reading the story.

No, what this Collector's Edition DVD is made up of is two Curious George stories done in stop motion with puppets. Although it's unusual to see at first, it has TOTALLY entranced my son. He watches it a least once a day...and this has been going on since before Easter.

However, there are only two actual Curious George stories on this DVD: Curious George Comes to America and Curious George Goes to the Hospital. The first story, created circa early 1980's, is about the Man in the Yellow Hat and his initial meeting with George...including his decision to bring George to the city. George's shipboard antics gets him in BIG trouble!

The second story has George going to the hospital when he swallows a puzzle piece. He's rushed to the emergency room (which is a rather odd storyline for young kids), but ends up forgetting his fears...instead cheering up other people.

The rest of the DVD includes four stop animation/claymation stories (NOT featuring George):

*Frog and Toad Together
*Frog and Toad Are Friends
*Mouse Soup
*Morris Has a Cold

There's also a ""making of"" at the end.

One of the episodes is absolutely hilarious. It features two rocks bemoaning how they don't have eyes and such. They break out in song ""We don't have belly buttons..."" and as they mention various body parts, the parts magically appear. It's clever and very funny...my husband and I make sure we're in front of the TV every time it's on! (You gotta see it to appreciate it, believe me...)

So if you're looking for 100% Curious George, you may be disappointed. But at this affordable price--and considering the length (almost 2 hours)--I think it's a good buy for something different for the youngsters.",1146096000,147,2217,4.661538461538462
2440113,2,B000BT994I,it is not worth the time better to get something from the libary then to purchase this it is not worth the money or time to watch it. poorly done and very old fashion and user unfreindly,1282521600,,186,4.054054054054054
2440114,5,B000BT994I,"I can understand people getting a bit bent out of shape if, based on the cover, they assume these are cartoons.  As other reviewers have noted, they're not.  Rather, they are terrific stop-motion animations from the 1980s of two original Curious George books: Curious George Goes to the Hospital and Curious George.  I love them, and my 2 year old, Curious George obsessed, daughter loves them too.

And while these are great, as far as I'm concerned the real treat on this DVD isn't Curious George, but stop-motion animations of two entire Frog and Toad books--narrated by Lobel himself: Frog and Toad are Friends and Frog and Toad Together.  Man, these are great.  I only wish they had done Frog and Toad All Year as well.

I can't stand the current Curious George cartoon--I think it's just generic, animation-mill junk.  If you love Curious George (and/or Frog and Toad) and respect the art *and* craft of animation, totally seek this out.  And if you know a kid who is obsessed with Curious George (and/or Frog and Toad), this DVD can be a great way to turn them on to thoughtful, artful animation.  I love this disc!  Shame it's not in print.

Oh--and if you're looking for something currently in print you can also get the Curious George and Frog and Toad stop-motion animations in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Curious-George-Goes-to-the-Hospital/dp/B0002UM11Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Curious George Goes to the Hospital</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Curious-George-Comes-to-America/dp/B00062J0OY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Curious George Comes to America</a>.",1262563200,5,1674,5.958158995815899
2440115,5,B000BT994I,"While being an adult, I have never really been a huge fan of Curious George, except I find as I see it more and more that it is rather funny, except I think that ""The Man in The Yellow"" hat would be in trouble for child neglect these days....  Oh that's right it's a monkey.  Maybe the
SPCA might have something to say then.....  I don't really know but they
are quite entertaining, forget the irresponsible Yellow hat guy and enjoy
Curious George's constant curiosity.

What is even better about this DVD though is the other video's on it.
My daughter is Autistic and though she's an adult she still likes to look
at stuff from her younger years, and we saw this one that we hadn't seen
in years, ""The Adventures of Frog And Toad"" by Arnold Lobel.  They are
claymation and are really excellent.

If you are the type who cannot sit still long and need to get up and be
on the move, you will identify with Frog.  If you are the procrastinator
type, who really doesn't see the need for adventure, and would rather sit
home eating cookies or sleeping, then you will identify with Toad.  And
like we all are, we often have best friends who are the opposite of us,
and that is what makes life interesting.

There are one or two other series on this also, that I wasn't as familiar
with, but they are also good and highly recommended.

A very good value for the money!",1256083200,,1362,4.326771653543307
2440116,5,B000BT994I,"I love this DVD, my kid loves this DVD. My two year old doesn't really watch television or cartoons, he is just not interested.  This stop motion animation really captures his attention.

You have to allow yourself to appreciate and enjoy the artistry and the hard work that went into making these shorts.  It appears to be a true labor of love for the animator and his family.  Just take some time to look at the complex action sequences and the detailed sets- no computers here, this is all handmade/homemade.

As far as the Curious George storyline being a bit dark or non-pc, have you read the original stories that where actually written by the Reys?  Don't use the  modern cartoon or even the more recent books as the standard. The original stories were a bit dark and non pc by today's standards.  These shorts actually follow the original stories pretty close (although in the original book, George smokes a pipe to relax and the TMITYH does not throw away the pipe like in this DVD).  Take some time to talk to your kids about smoking, the potential danger of water, the importance of not playing with the phone, etc.

The Frog and Toad stories are very well done and are a special bonus.  My kid loves them and now we read the books together.  Everytime you watch them, you notice something new and entertaining.",1247875200,,1322,4.578723404255319
2440117,5,B000BT994I,"This seller was very prompt, swift and very efficient. I will order from this seller again. Very nice material also.",1243555200,,116,4.85
2440118,4,B000BT994I,I bought this DVD after my daughter had watched it at the library. Very charming! And my daughter likes it too.,1240876800,,111,4.333333333333333
2440119,4,B000BT994I,"i am an adult fan of Curious George.  (love the lil guy!)  while this is not the familiar PBS cartoon, i really enjoyed this DVD.  The stop-action puppetry takes a while to get used to, but the stories are solid.  I'd caution parents of small children, George does cry, and TMITYH is not exactly heroic.  Still--glad I purchased, and love the addition to my library",1240185600,,365,4.553846153846154
2440120,5,B000BT994I,This is a great dvd for young children who love Curious George. My daughter sits and watches it plus it's nice for in the car for her to watch.,1234569600,,143,3.9655172413793105
2440121,5,B000BT994I,"This is the classic Curious George, plus some extra toons from before the digital era.  Good animation!",1209427200,,103,5.0588235294117645
2440122,4,B000BT994I,"We rented this DVD from the library because my 3 year-old daughter LOVES the PBS Curious George.  When we turned it on and I saw how different it looks than the current version I thought she wouldn't like it.  To my surprise she couldn't get enough of the two episodes!  She doesn't care for the Frog and Toad or other stories though.

I would not buy this even though she loves it since she only likes the two episodes.  I will continue to just rent it from my local library.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that I didn't like the pipe smoking scene but I talked to my daughter about how ""yucky"" and ""unhealthy"" that is to do.

Hope my review helps your decision!",1209168000,,674,4.25984251968504
2440123,2,B000BT994I,"She loves the one Curious George book we have.  I bought it on a whim at the store.  She cried the first time we watched it (she did like Frog & Toad).  The second time, we couldn't make it past the first Curious George episode.  Watching him nearly drown, him turning green on pipe smoke and then worried about the fire trucks.  My tender-hearted girl who doesn't watch much TV (we do watch some Veggie Tales together) just couldn't get past that.",1204588800,3,448,4.414634146341464
2440124,5,B000BT994I,"I remember watching the Frog and Toad Claymation on T.V. when I was a kid. I asked my dad if I could copy the episodes from his VHS tape. Unfortunately, he'd accidentally recorded over many of the episodes, and so I began searching eBay and the Internet to see if I could find a DVD of them.  Imagine my surprise when I discovered that the Frog and Toad episodes were lumped in with a DVD that carried the Curious George title on the cover.

Now, I want to mention something here.  If you or your children are ""Disney Freaks,"" or spend a lot of time watching T.V, then this DVD just might not be the thing for you.  The Claymation was done the old-fashioned, time consuming way and should not be compared to the newer methods of Claymation. Not to mention, it is not fast-paced, nor is there any ""exciting"" music/songs on this DVD (just background music and a couple silly songs).

There's a couple miscellaneous episodes (not Curious George or Frog & Toad) that we are not crazy about, and we sometimes skip them.  But, for the most part, we really like it.  My children giggle about something every time they watch it, which is a good sign that it's geared toward a young audience.  My 6-year-old and 4-year-old also love watching the portion of the DVD that shows how the Claymation was done.

In summary: If you enjoy reading the original Curious George books and/or the Frog & Toad books to your children, then you will most likely enjoy the accurate representations of them on this DVD.  However, if the only Curious George your children have been exposed to is the movie, then this might not hold their attention. For us, this has been a refreshing change from most children's entertainment that's out there.",1197590400,,1715,4.57516339869281
2440125,4,B000BT994I,"When I rented this video, I was expecting two Curious George cartoons, based only loosely on anything written by the Reys..

Imagine my surprise when I found stop-motion animation that followed the books almost to the word!  My son was entranced from the first moment.  Better still, the rest of the DVD was filled with Frog & Toad, Mouse Soup, and Morris gets a Cold -- stories I hadn't heard of yet, but which my son loved (and still loves).  Mildly educational, highly entertaining fun.  I simply can't return the rental before we own a copy, or my household will fall apart at the seams!  Luckily, the DVD is long and varied enough that it bears many playings.",1194652800,,664,4.584745762711864
2440126,1,B000BT994I,"The DVD animation looks like an 18th century work. I am extremely disappointed with this dvd especially with these unreliable reviews with which i took the decision. I had seen curious george cartoons in pbs kids tv show,expected the cartoons in this dvd would have the same look and feel.

The claymation of all the characters in this dvd is sort of ok but the audio and video quality is very poor.the characters talking and walking is very unrealistic. Overall it looks like the work done in very old time. Certainly I won't recommend this.!!!",1191456000,,545,4.7368421052631575
2440127,5,B000BT994I,"John Clark Matthews is a rare talent and his ""Curious George"" creation is a true masterpiece. The attention to detail is impressive as is his use of music and voices. Take the scene when George is put in jail, for instance. This is truly touching, pure, innocent and beautiful.

These animations, here including the ""Frog and Toad"" series from the 1980s are a delight to children. Our daughter has watched them over and over and has brought joy to all of us. These make much of what is produced today look like banal rubbish.

Matthews must also be a modest person, it is difficult to find information on him today. The ""makings of"" on this DVD are also very interesting but be careful about letting the kids see him taking George's face off the puppet (might be a little upsetting!)

I advise any discerning parent to buy this for the mental health of your child... and the community at large! The world needs more of this kind of refined art.",1188086400,5,944,4.541176470588235
2440128,5,B000BT994I,"The title is misleading since there are only 2 Curious George stories. The claymation is charming in spite not being the cute computer animation that's on PBS. But all the other stories are terrific. Classic Frog and Toad are Friend stories are entertaining. The mouse soup is funny too. But the crickets singing are truly adult (ie sophisticated humor) funny -- the accent adds to the charm. And as noted below, the rocks are amusing as well. My 6yo really enjoys it and my 4yo finds it somewhat entertaining.",1185235200,2,510,4.741573033707865
2440129,1,B000BT994I,Don't like this DVD at all.  But I love the new ones - Zoo Night & Rocket Ride.,1185235200,,79,3.388888888888889
2440130,5,B000BT994I,"While this DVD does feature two Curious George episodes, its also full of other television shorts done in the same animated / stop-action format, including several adventures of Frog & Toad (narrated by author Arnold Lobel himself). These bonus programs make this DVD a real value:

  * Curious George Comes to America

  * Curious George Goes to the Hospital

  * The Making of Curious George

  * Frog and Toad Together

  * Frog and Toad Are Friends

  * Frog and Toad Behind the Scenes

  * Mouse Soup

  * Morris Has a Cold

Now, these were done in the 1980s and yes, animation has moved on since then, but these were painstakingly made and if you watch the bonus behind-the-scenes footage of the episodes, you (and your children) will be even more impressed.

Fans of Rankin Bass, Davey & Goliath, and the stop-action Paddington series will really enjoy this DVD (and kids will love to see their favorite stories come to life).

This DVD does a great job of preserving and presenting these sought-after films.",1176249600,,1015,4.716763005780347
2440131,5,B000BT994I,"I love the animation in this video.  It's like claymation, but of course it's modern computer graphics.  Really cute.

2440132,4,B000BT994I,"My 2 year old loves loves loves these claymation Curious George stories, as well as the two Frog and Toad and Mouse Soup features that follow. Clearly however they are a little old and non-PC - it includes a scene of George imitating the man with the yellow hat by smoking his pipe for example. My question is this: what's the deal with the editing and marketing of these stories? The introductions are repeated, there's no menu on the DVD, and the disc's contents are not obvious or marketed. Seems like a wasted opportunity for the company, and annoying for the consumer. Aside from these bits, we really love the old claymation - even as an adult, I find them fun to watch.
