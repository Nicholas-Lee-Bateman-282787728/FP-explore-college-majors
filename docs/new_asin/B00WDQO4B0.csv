8712919,4,B00WDQO4B0,"A simple tale based upon (what is for millions of people) the most majestic event in world history, ""The Gospel Writers' Autographs"" is nostalgic fare. It's not DeMille's ""Ten Commandments"" (nor for that matter, Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"") ; It's more along the lines of a high school pageant brought to the screen.
But this does not detract from the film's charm.
The film's intended audience seems to be for younger - or newer - Christians, by means of introduction to the basics of the faith.
The two protagonists (social castoffs Mitchell and Vance) finagle a time machine using spare parts from a common label maker, and arbitrarily decide to test it out by traveling 2,000 years - and 9,000 miles - away in order to acquire the autographs of the four canonical Gospel writers, hence the film's title.
The movie hasn't much by means of a budget - although it has got soul. To criticize based on this element feels almost cruel, as each actor gives it his or her all. No one, for instance, speaks in Aramaic nor Greek - in fact, Saint Luke and Saint Mark would be more likely from present-day Wisconsin than ancient Judea. Although not historically accurate, the film has a kind-hearted sense of humour, introducing a light introduction to a very sublime, profound subject: the all-encompassing love and forgiveness demonstrated by Christ's sacrifice.
Considering the obvious efforts put into the film's creation, ""The Gospel Writers' Autographs"" is enjoyable to watch with the family, without ever having to worry about cruel jokes or the like. I had a lot of fun watching the actors' portrayals of Biblical personalities, and one can certainly appreciate the work put into the gorgeous costumes and sets. And when the cast breaks it down with a song-and-dance routine to the tune of Doris Day's ""Be My Baby Bumblebee""... well, it's impossible not to smile just a little.",1496275200,,1886,4.896875
