4959621,5,B00652U72S,I would definately recommend this movie to everyone. I have been the victim of a workplace bully and this movie hits close to home for me even though this deals with a teenager at school. Most of the parts of this movie is realistic. I firmly believe that people needs to see this because it will show them what happens when they bully others.,1333497600,2,343,4.375
4959622,5,B00652U72S,in every way. This is a must see for teens all over the world. And parents should be montering what their kids are doing if they want them to or not. Excellent movie.,1332547200,2,166,4.0606060606060606
4959623,5,B00652U72S,"I cannot believe there are only 3 reviews for this movie (as of March 21 anyway). EVERYONE needs to see this movie. No mainstream releases for movies lacking huge special effects, even when they are important, I guess.

This movie was definitely important. It was hard to watch, but that was because it was so accurate. If you've never been bullied, you'll probably think it's silly and overdramatic, but it's not. As the bully admits at the end, when you do it online, you don't even realize you're doing it. It doesn't seem real. It's just a computer screen. You can't see the person you're hurting. You can't see the pain in their eyes or the hurt on their face. And that's why cyberbullying has become so prevalent. Cowards do it. People who would never have the guts to say something to someone's face have no problem saying something to an inexpressive computer screen. And they have no idea the damage they cause. And the victims have no recourse. You can't go to the police with internal bruising. As it stated at the end of the movie, just over half the states now have laws that help with cyberbulling. But they only help, they don't actually punish the bullies or efectively stop it. And they presently only deal with minors. Adults can be bullied too and there are apparently no laws at all dealing with that yet.

I'd recommend this movie be shown in schools, but I imagine a lot of kids would laugh at it if it were shown in a group setting. Parents should show it to their kids individually, maybe. I think a lot of adults would benifit from watching it as well.",1332288000,30,1577,4.510489510489511
4959624,5,B00652U72S,This is a great and educational movie. It is sad but realistic. Most people (including myself) have became cyber bully victims over nonsense. I love this movie and I hope kids will learn that words can greatly affect others,1332201600,18,223,4.743589743589744

4959626,5,B00652U72S,"This was such a great movie. This epidemic is huge and can often lead to disastrous and terrible results and this movie absolutely captures that. When the main character receives a laptop for her birthday, she goes against her mothers wishes and joins a Facebook-esque website. Shortly after, a joke spirals out of control and rumors begin to fly. One rumor leads to another and soon she finds herself alone and the subject of cyberbullying.

The ending is positive, but the middle is what is truly horrifying. Certain moments felt like almost too much to watch and almost silly, despite knowing that this is exactly what is happening on the internet every day. That's what makes a movie like this so terrifying yet so honest. I absolutely loved this movie and would certainly recommend this.

4959648,4,B00652U72S,"The movie Cyberbully was a movie about a young girl named Taylor who was bullied over the web. Her mom gave her a computer for her birthday and she created a profile on the hot website called Clicksters. The bullying started when her brother hacked into her profile and made a nasty status up. The cyber bullying was getting out of control and Taylor was about to loose herself. She tried to commit suicide, but her best friend saved her just in time. She recovered at the hospital and joined a group to talk about it. Her family works hard and by the end of the movie a law is passed that made cyber bullying illegal. The teachers were not much help and were kind of blind sided the whole time the bullying was happening. At the end though they helped the family get the law passed to make cyber bullying illegal. I strongly recommend this movie to other teachers because it is a reality of what really does happen on the web and I think teachers need to know about that.

4959668,2,B00652U72S,"I was bullied heinously in a small town public school for 10 years, right up to the day I graduated, and they even managed to get in a final slap in the face in the yearbooks the following fall. I watched this on another service, and I couldn't believe how bad it was. I don't think anyone who worked on this movie knew anything about bullying in general, let alone cyberbullying, and it just turned out to be dumb.

Bullies don't have good intentions. Most of the time, they don't even have any intentions. They're bored, they're in the moment, and they see you as their entertainment to pass the time until an adult comes along who can make them stop. There is no logical or rational explanation for their behavior. Whoever added the logical explanation for the bully's behavior was trying to engage the part of the adult audience that always howls that ""THERE MUST BE SOME REASON FOR THIS!"" A kid will tell you it's because their parents are divorcing or because of this or that, because that's what you want to hear, that there was a REASON, but the fact is that they do it for kicks.

The bullying itself was very tame stuff, and it didn't reflect real-life harshness and intensity at all. Bullying is a blood sport and it is absolutely brutal. It doesn't stop with name calling and spreading rumors about STDs. They spit on you, shove you into lockers and walls, and won't let you have a seat at lunch or on the bus. You can be the ball in locker foosball if you show up at the wrong time-- that's where they line up in between lockers and shove you from one side into the other until they run out of time. And they don't just restrict harassment for one class or the bathroom. They do it to you everywhere. There's no peace for you on a bike ride or at the local shops. If you're an acceptable target, no one will ever intervene for you.

~SPOILERS~ (If that's even possible with such a badly written script)

The characters are incredibly naive and stupid. The mother allowed her to have unfettered access to the internet, not really understanding how any of it works. She kept telling the daughter to delete the social media page but never followed up. She got upset that her daughter called someone a b****, but she seemed just fine with everyone ganging up on her daughter until after the suicide attempt. Then after one run-in with a parent who was a bully lawyer, she didn't confront any of the other people who had done it. People are shocked, SHOCKED I SAY, that someone was catfishing using a made-up identity.

 Nobody knew about IP addresses or how to look one up. They only found out who did it because she confessed to it. The daughter had to go to therapy, because SHE was the one with a problem now, not the bullying jerks. Everybody in that group had the IQ of a sheet of bubblewrap and it focused on how victims need to adjust their behavior to avoid bullying, not on defending yourself. And of course, it had to end with everyone forgiving each other, and passing a law that most likely is unconstitutional, but everyone will support because it's ""for the CHILDREN!""

Not to mention this girl never would have been targeted in the first place. She was pretty, blonde, and had a circle of friends. Bullies pick on people who don't have friends and have trouble socializing. They'll focus on any visible physical flaw, but they prefer the loners. Loners don't have anyone to defend them. Even a loner's parent tells them it's their fault because they don't have any friends.

The casting was good, but the diversity was awful--- it always is in these kinds of productions. The one black friend splits at the first sign of trouble and is clearly there so that they will have someone black in the movie-- same with the principal. It seems that dark skinned black girls and Hispanic kids are only good for being tertiary characters and redshirts.

You can watch it if you want to see how bad it is, how not to write a movie, or play a drinking game every time a character does something dumb. That's really all this movie is good for. If you want to stop bullying, you need to raise your kids right. You have to talk to them and teach them right from wrong. When your kid says someone is hurting them, listen to them. It's nothing like this movie, and it's not going to end the way the movie did, either.",1430524800,2,4324,4.456384323640961

4959692,4,B00652U72S,"Cyberbully is a movie about a girl played by Emily Osmet, named Taylor. This movie addresses nowadays issues like social media and bullying, but in this case it combines them into one new category called cyberbully. It approaches the life of a teenage girl that finds herself trapped in a dead-end after rumors about her are spread in social media and she faces the consequences of such rumors. It addresses many delicate topics such as suicide, sexual relations, harassment, name-calling, homophobia, among others. After a while of being bullied online and in real life, and losing support from her friends and teacher, she turns into a suicidal stage in which she sees relief from all of these problems. Her mother is the only one that believes her and supports her, while going through everything with her in order to make her regain the confidence that she once had.",1427846400,,870,4.885135135135135

Taylor was cyberbullied by someone that she thought was her best friend. The bullying all started when Taylor received a laptop for a birthday gift form her mother. When her mother gave her the gift the one rule she had was that she was not allowed to have any social media because her mother knew the dangers of it. During the first month that Taylor had this laptop someone hacked into it posting a status to make her look like a slut. After that status was posted people started to spread rumors about Taylor and all of the dirty things she has supposedly done. After people heard those rumors they started to bully her. Leading Taylor to attempt suicide. Taylors suicide attempt was not successful and there fore kept her from school for many weeks. After the suicide attempt Taylors mom went to the school to try and figure out who was behind all of this. Her mother talked to the principal about it. The principal of the school was not helpful at all. Because there was no law in the state against cyberbullying there was nothing that he could do. I disagree with the principals actions because I feel like there was at least something he could have done. A principal is suppose to care for the school and the students in it and should try to take any measure to help the families of students. Especially students who tried to kill themselves. I strongly recommend this movie to other teachers because it can show teachers an inside view of how bullying can affect not only the student, but the family as well.",1427587200,,1626,4.610344827586207

4959696,5,B00652U72S,"In the ABC movie Cyberbully Emily Osment plays 17 year old Taylor Hillridge. Taylor is like any teenager; she is sucked into the age of technology and spends countless hours online on popular social media websites. One day Taylor becomes the victim of a cyber bullying attack. Emily Osment portrayed her character very well. She plays the emotional, innocent girl that gets attacked viciously from the mean girls cruel comments and rumors. Teenagers have very low self-esteems and take hurtful words to heart especially since a majority of a teenagers life is spent online. All teachers and students should consider this movie a teaching tool. This movie teaches its viewers how hurtful words can be online, how people are affected by bullying, and how a person should deal with bullying. Teachers can show this to students in a classroom as an example of how students may be dealing with the rotten things cyber-bullies say to others. This may also trigger students as a reminder to think before they post something to the Internet. This may also be an example for teachers to help assist students in this problem. As a current student there were many things my teachers new what was online before I did. If teachers see this arising, a teacher may be able to talk to a student and give ideas on how to improve the situation or, teachers can learn to take this to a higher level of authority. Educators could be that factor that helps a student before they do something harmful to themselves. This movie betrays the life of a teenager in this situation very well. Many stories are being told about teenagers taking their lives because of the things bullies are saying to them online. By students watching this film, hopefully it encourages them to put an end to the attackers saying dreadful comments on social media.",1427241600,,1818,4.81150159744409
4959697,4,B00652U72S,"Cyberbully is a movie about a typical teenage girl, Taylor, beginning with her experiencing typical high school situations of pressures to fit in, mean girls, and enjoying profile sites. A popular, rowdy profile site called Clicksters and her friends lead Taylor to creating a profile. From hacking to fake profiles, she begins to deal with cyberbullies and rumors. The movie portrays her struggle with bullying and relationships with those around her.
The movie is an insight into how schools handle this issue, as well. Because it is virtual bullying, they find it more difficult to control or take measures to change. The movies shows the problems the school system has when it comes to bullying, as it is a serious issue that, even virtual bullying, needs help controlling. Bullying leads to serious issues of depression, loss, desperation, and pain, as seen in the movie. This movie is an eye opener for those that are bullied, those who bullied, and for those who want to learn more about the serious impact of bullying.
This movie is a good portrayal of pressures teens face in school as well as showing that bullying is not limited to inside the school, as to not just in-person bullying. I would recommend this movie to show the effects of bullying and to show how virtual bullying is a problem, as well.",1427068800,,1313,4.84

The bullying started when she got a laptop for her birthday and joined a social media website. Her brother started it all when he hacked her profile and put up a status that made her look like a slut. Other students started bullying her, including her best friend. After Taylor tried killing herself, her mother actively went searching around trying to find out who was behind it all. She talked to the principal and he said that he did not have any power to do anything because there were no laws against cyberbullying in the state they lived in. Taylor and her best friend that bullied her met up and did a news article together trying to show people that cyberbullying is a big issue. After the article is made, a law is passed that makes it illegal. Taylor starts the process of making up with her friends and stands up to the bullies. The teachers did not play a huge role in the movie but the part with the principal was important. It showed how teachers have limited power when it comes to the cyberbullying problem.

So it may have the bully's upbringing that may her who she was.  Some parents need to take action for their children's  wrong doing instead of supporting it.,1412121600,,429,4.5064935064935066
4959714,2,B00652U72S,"In the movie ""Cyberbully"", ABC Family along with Director Charles Biname takes the issue of bullying via the Internet and addresses the effects and influences it has on an individual. I had been looking forward to seeing this film, and heard a lot of good things about it from my peers as well. I'd also scrolled past advertisements and trailers on my Twitter and Tumblr dashboards. It was supposed to be huge for ABC. But upon viewing it, it turned out I was pretty disappointed.

The movie takes place in a small town, where gossip is what everybody thrives on. Taylor Hillridge (Emily Osment) is a 17 year old girl who has recently created a profile on a new social media website. She becomes a victim of cyberbullying, when a fake profile is made that spreads rumors about her. The movie goes on to depict how emotionally tolling online harassment can be on an individual. Overall, the film had a well thought out idea along with a well known experienced actress, but what brought it down was the weak themes and the predictable plot, not to mention the other characters awful acting.

Beginning with the acting and the overall originality (aside from Osment) the actors were mostly unknown and amateur. Without Osment in the film, it would've been a complete flop. It was Osment's performance that made this movie go from bad, to okay. Seeing the actress struggle with her emotions as the movie developed was very realistic. Osment's acting set her apart from any other part of the film, because of how well she executed it. I felt as if I could feel what the character was going through when I watched her. She has a lot of experience, and she knew what she was doing more than anyone else in the film.

More of the main problem I had with the movie was the general development and plot. ""Cyberbully"" seemed as if a middle school student wrote it. The lines were cheesy and completely unoriginal. The typical mean girls at school, picking on the ""average"" main character, the rude jock that the average girl is crushing on, the two best friends of the main character, and an overprotective mother. Doesn't get much more typical than that. It was predictable and dramatic, and there was hardly even a plot twist. An example of this being the climax happening way too soon into the movie, making for an unrealistic drastic scene, coming out of nowhere. After the peak of the movie, I found myself checked out completely, only to realize I had a solid 45 minutes left to watch.

In total, the movie did not portray realistic characteristics of cyber bulling. The drastic measures taken by the actors did not reflect a typical cyber bulling case, made the movie lack relatable content, and didn't draw the audience in. It was a great idea and focused on an important problem today, but the movies potential could've been fulfilled with more realistic acting and a more structured storyline. Watching this film gave me the impression that the director and ABC Family think of cyberbullying as one big joke.",1411430400,,3007,4.7110266159695815

I've seen many negative comments from adults saying this story isn't relevant and that the acting was bad. That couldn't be further than the truth. As a viewer you feel like you are walking in the shoes of the main character who is being cyberbullies...and yes...she is a typical teen. We used this movie during our schools anti-cyberbullying week.  The feedback from students was that this movie was ""realistic"", ""something they have seen before in real life"", ""touching"".  It's a great way to teach students about online safety, awareness, standing up for your friends, and ""being the change"" in an internet age. It's a great conversation starter and visual way to teach your kids (or parents). Megan's mom also came to our school to speak to students and parents.

Taylor quickly joins a social networking service, where many of her classmates are also members, and becomes a target of insults and bullying online, including from unlikely sources of members of her family and circle of friends.  She becomes obsessed with the site and checks it constantly.  The taunting becomes too much and she buckles under the humiliation.

This is an excellent movie as it explores the complexity of the issue of cyberbullying, the difficulty of policing the internet, and the consequences of people's actions.  A great movie requires a combination of excellent writing and directing, but also of talented actors to bring the writing alive.  Cyberbully is one such movie that has the right ingredients of outstanding acting, impressive writing, and insightful directing.  Emily Osment (best known as the best friend on the television series Hannah Montana) interprets the emotions of her character perfectly, and makes a valuable contribution to the soundtrack with the song ""Drift.""

My one criticism of the DVD is the packaging.  There needs to be subtitles and/or voiceovers in French and Spanish, and subtitles in English, in order to broaden the potential audience.  I also would have liked to have seen some commentary on cyberbulling.

The internet is worse, however, because we got to leave school for a few hours.  With the internet, the harrassment is worse because it's also in your home.

What's really amazing to me is that there was also the issue of forgiveness with one character and Taylor (Emily Osment), and the movie is great for that reason.  It shows the absolute cruelty of what's going on out there, and also Taylor's willingness to forgive the person who hurt her the most (not giving that one away).

In fact, I felt little no sympathy for the main character because she causes most of the conflict in the film. On top of that the soundtrack is annoying and doesnt fit some how.
