8584189,1,B00COYSDQI,"Tu mamy szalona mystifikacja Holocaustu. A morderwstwa Polakow przez Niemcow, Sowietow, Ukraincow, i Zydow nigde nie dostaja zadna mystifikacje. Nigdy nie slyszymy o Zydowskich mordach Polakow wiosek Naliboki, Koniuchy, i innych. Wrszystko jest skierowane na skladanie wrszystkiej winny na Polakach i wybielania Zydow. Ten film jest tylko jeden pszyklad tej starej historie Zydocentryzmu.",1500508800,2,388,6.339622641509434
8584190,5,B00COYSDQI,"Pokosie (Aftermath) is a compelling thriller that illuminates an important aspect of the Holocaust and Polish history.  The film explores the relationship between Poles and the Jewish past of their country through the tensions around family and community. Pokosie (Aftermath) undermines the conventional history of the Holocaust, that local non-Jews were either uninvolved or powerless during the murder of their Jewish neighbours. The film achieves this by means of a straight forward plot and strong performances from Ireneusz Czop and Maciej Stuhr as the Kalina brothers. Some people have found this film unsettling. They should not. It says a lot about the willingness of some people in Poland to debate the Holocaust and the ethical issues surrounding it. Just compare the direct and honest manner in which Pokosie (Aftermath) looks at the Holocaust with the self-pitying, cloying evasiveness of the German mini-series Generation War (Unsere Mtter, unsere Vter).",1394409600,5,967,5.533783783783784
8584191,1,B00COYSDQI,"If you can speak Polish, you can watch this movie for free on UTUBE.
If you cannot, do not invest in this incredibly bad piece of propaganda.
The thesis (beyond belief) seems to be that much of Poland was owned by Jews and that they should get it back.
They did not and they should not. By the way, Poles have the largest number of Jewish rescuers remembered at the Yad Vashem
center in Israel. This movie is a slander of the Catholic faith and the Polish nation.
I suppose Benjamin Netanyahu would like it just fine.
Most Americans will find it ridiculous.",1391299200,3,557,4.41747572815534
