8504506,4,B006UF25PW,"I picked this up as I've been trying to get season one of Industrial Revelations with Mark Williams and I keep getting copies of More Industrial Revelations (aka season two).

For those who are interested this is NOT season one. It's the three disc set of More Industrial Revelations along with an oddly chosen single disc of the later series hosted by Ronald Top called More Industrial Revelations Europe. Strangely enough it is episodes 8, 9 and 10 of that series. Ronald can't compete with Mark as a presenter, however, his series is still worth the watch.

I have no idea why this set doesn't mention it's actually More Industrial Revelations aside from some little text on the back, nor do I know why it would include the last three episodes of More Industrial Revelations Europe and not the rest of that series.

That being said, IR is an excellent series on the industrial revolution. These discs are DVD region 2 (U.K., etc) and will not playback in North American DVD players - although many are region free now. In addition most modern computer drives ignore the code or can switch to R2. Ripping the discs - with say, Handbreak - makes the region irrelevant anyway.",1362096000,2,1176,4.699029126213592
