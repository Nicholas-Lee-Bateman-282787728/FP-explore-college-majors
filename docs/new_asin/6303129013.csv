572427,3,6303129013,"Okay, technically, my 2nd favorite Invisible Man movie is ""The Invisible Woman"", but that's a comedy.
""Revenge"" is actually the only one of the ""Invisible Man"" sequels in which the Invisible Man is a true menace like he was in the Claude Rains original.
The plot doesn't make much sense, and Jon Hall is no Claude Raines or Vincent Price, but don't let any of that throw you. Enjoy his wreaking vengeance on those whom he accuses of wronging him, and the clever and innovative photographic tricks. This Invisible Man is seen with water on his face 56 years before ""Hollow Man!""",970099200,3,577,4.666666666666667
572428,2,6303129013,"Hall plays a homicidal paranoic who thinks (unjustly) that he has been swindled out of great wealth. After learning some tricks about invisibility from crackpot scientist John Carradine, he goes on a rampage against his  would-be persecuters. Not a bad little horror film but too much footage is  given Leon Errol, the film's comic relief. The end result is a thriller  that could have been tighter with less padding. 2 1/2 stars.",963273600,3,430,4.944444444444445
7839128,3,6303129013,"Well--when deciding on my least favorite Universal horror--it's usually a photo finish between ""House of Dracula"" and this film. I think my problem here with ""Invisible Man's Revenge"" is that you have what appears to be a distinguished cast, but no one who really stands out with a stellar performance--or maybe more to the point, no one who comes across as affable or easy to root for.

And that's not to say that I don't enjoy a character who is devoid of sympathy--I very much enjoy Lugosi's Count Dracula--but here, I feel it would help if the Robert Griffin character was in some way likeable or sympathetic, but Jon Hall just comes across as a man with no redeeming qualities who will kill on the drop of a hat if someone crosses him in even the slightest way.

Which brings me back to a point I brought up in another review--why didn't Lon Chaney play the Invisible Man; given that Universal tapped Chaney to play every other fright character for them, I think Lon could have given this role the touch of pathos it probably needed.

The rest of the cast is pretty unremarkable, based on performance--John Carradine gives what may be the best performance in the picture as the ""Mad"" doctor who creates invisible animals as well as the Invisible Man. Evelyn Ankers is as pretty as ever but mostly wasted here in this movie--no screams of horror from the great Ms. Ankers either (a pity).

""The Invisible Man's Revenge"" is definitely the runt of the Universal horror litter and a film I don't play often, but--if you're a serious horror fan--it wouldn't hurt to give it a look or two.

7839129,4,6303129013,"THE INVISIBLE MAN'S REVENGE was released in 1944 and is an overlooked gem of sorts. We just don't get these type of films any more. It is a science fiction horror film directed by Ford Beebe and stars John Carradine as a mad scientist who wants to test his new formula of invisibility. THE INVISIBLE MAN'S REVENGE does not quite fit the continuity of the previous Universal entries, but it does have that Universal horror feel to it. Milton R. Krasner's cinematography is quite good and very moody in some sequences.",1421452800,,516,4.681318681318682
7839130,2,6303129013,"One of Universal's weakest horror entries and the unraveling of a better-than-average series. ""The Invisible Man's Revenge"" (1944) finally exhausts its H.G. Wells source material  little helped by a weak script and slack direction from Ford Beebe. Not even John P. Fulton's visual effects can save this tired sequel.",1390867200,2,316,5.448979591836735
7839131,2,6303129013,"The Invisible Man's Revenge, 1944 film

Packages are unloaded at a seaport. A man cuts his way out of one bundle. He doesn't like questions. Is he lost? A newspaper tells about a ""homicidal maniac"" who escaped from an asylum! We see a mansion in the country, Robert Griffin visits old friends and business partner. Griffin had lost his memory. The millions from the diamond field was lost in bad investments. But Griffin wants his share now. One drink affected his warped mind. They must get him off their property. Robert wanders off and is given shelter. But the written agreement is gone! They find a lawyer, Jim Feeney. The Chief Constable talks to them. Griffin walks away, but stops at a doctor's house. Doctor Drury takes him in and shows off his pets. They are invisible! ""That's incredible."" Griffin will take the drug to make himself invisible. It works! ""Me worry?"" Griffin walks away.

Griffin returns to Jasper and asks him to write a confession and turn over his property. Then Griffin returns to his friend. People talk about an invisible man. We see a number of bullseye's on a dart board. An easy 5? Julie tells of her mother's illness. Griffin returns to the mansion. He then goes to see Doctor Drury so he can be visible again. This will require a blood transfusion from another man! Reporter Foster learns about the telephone call from the police and goes there. Will he be in time to save Drury? A dog howls. ""Martin Fields"" visits that mansion. His new friend drops by. Drury's dog has followed Griffin. Reporter Foster tells about Drury's death. Later Griffin finds his invisibility has returned. He calls Foster to the wine cellar. ""You can't fight what you can't see."" The police follow a clue to the mansion. Drury's dog attacks ""Fields""; he falls to the ground. They rescue Foster. Fields will not be a problem anymore.

This is the last of these movies during this era. The end of the war seems to have ended these horror movies. The story of an ""invisible man"" may be a parody of Adam Smith's ""invisible hand"" that regulated economic life. It shows what a real invisible man can do with his invisible hand.",1350518400,,2135,4.672872340425532
7839132,4,6303129013,"Unrelated to the other Invisible films by Universal and even using the same actor, Jon Hall, from The Invisible Agent. Griffin is a man who escaped from an asylum after killing two nurses (not shown) and finds that his partner in an African safari (who got a diamond mine there) got a bunch of money and Griffin wants it.  And wants his daughter.  After getting himself kicked out and nearly drowned, he finds his way to John  Carradine's house, the mad scientist who has the invisibility serum.

It's great when Carradine opens the door and let's him into his house, with that leer and ""You don't have a friend in the world, eh?""  Carradine introduces him to his invisible dog and parrot and needs a human to experiment on.  Once the formula works, Griffin beats him up and escapes, to use his invisibility in revenge against his partner.

Special effects are fair; not sure how they make him invisible (positive/negative film perhaps) and we can see a few wires here and there with floating objects.  The story is a bit hackneyed and some forced humor with a dart game in a bar -- the darts move way too slow to their bullseye, thanks to invisible help.

Can't see what you'd like here (pun) but for the Universal Pictures fan, a must-see.  Several levels below the Claude Rains original.

7839133,3,6303129013,"The Invisible Man's Revenge is one hour and eighteen minutes long and was released on June 9, 1944. Unlike the Invisible Man Returns and the Invisible Agent, this does not follow a timeline nor is it a sequel like Frankenstein and the Mummy sequels. The thing that it is shared is the last name Griffin and the movie does not indicate that he is related to Jack or Frank Griffin. Jon Hall makes his second and last appearance as the Invisible Man. Robert Griffin has escape from a mental institution and is on his way to England to get his share of the fortune due to him. When he gets to the home of Lady Irene Herrick and Sir Jasper Herrick, he demands his share and wants it now. Jasper is reluctantly willing to hand it over, but his wife Irene is not. Though it is hinted in the movie that she caused him to loose his memory, she never omits openly. Irene drugs Robert whiskey and convinces Jasper that he is still insane and steals the proof of paper that proves he is equal to half of everything. They dump his body near a river where Roberts almost drowns until he is rescued. In the middle of the movie he finds Dr. Peter Drury who invented an invisible formula. Dr. Drury turns Robert invisible and Robert set out seeking revenge on the family that tried to kill him. End the end Brutus a dog winds up killing the Invisible Man. The story is so-so and the acting is lame. In the end, you wished that Brutus killed Lady Irene Herrick and Sir Jasper Herrick and feel sorry for Robert Griffin. I can only give this movie a C-.",1235174400,,1533,4.307958477508651
7839134,4,6303129013,"This is the final in the Invisible Man series of 3 films. By 1944 most of the Universal Monsters films were getting made on a very small budget and this last installment of the Invisible Man shows the same signs as the others, although not as bad. It's still a very entertaining film just a bit too contrived to take too seriously. The FX are pretty good but, most of the FX are parlor tricks and there are some wires showing here and there. It's a lot of fun and by this time in the series it's OK to laugh. This is available on DVD as part of the Invisible Man Legacy Collection along with 4 other films relating to invisibility. The DVD transfer is very good and there are some interesting extras included.",1201737600,13,709,4.298507462686567
7839135,2,6303129013,"The ""menace and out-and-out horror"" promised by Universal are invisible in this rather lukewarm installment in the ""IM"" series. Star Jon Hall is pretty to look at, and he might even be a good thespian, though the script (and Ford Bebbe's clumsy direction) certainly don't give him any chance to prove it. The plot is as vapid as it is improbable (and confusing): A man named Robert Griffin stows away on a ship, returning to England to get the money owed to him by his ""business partners,"" who happened to be Mr. and Mrs. We end up with bad guy versus badder guy and gal ... with lots of plot manipulations and oversized hypodermic needles thrown in. What makes the film worth watching (once) are the (limited) special effects; most specially the scene in which Griffin reveals his invisible eyes and the nifty bit in which he splatters flour on his face to prove his identity to a friend. This Wells have run dry.",1043539200,,914,4.579268292682927
7839136,2,6303129013,"Jon Hall wants revenge on the couple that have swindled him out of a fortune.  He not only expects to take over their estate, but he also expects their daughter's hand in marriage as well.  He stumbles upon a doctor experimenting with invisibility, and uses this weapon to get what he wants.  This film had some potential, but much of it is wasted.  Jon Hall isn't much of an actor (not that the role required him to be), so he isn't very compelling.  Evelyn Ankers, the scream queen, is given very little to do here, appearing in just a few throw away scenes.  The great Gale Sondergaard, a great presence in many movies, shows up in the first third of the film, then disappears (suffering from nerves, it is explained in the story).  John Carradine is fun as the scientist, the only somewhat memorable character.  The back story of the plot is confusing, leaving me with more questions than answers, and the direction is choppy.  There are a few good special effects, but that's not enough to compensate for the rest of the film.  I usually like these Universal horror films, but this one need a complete overhaul before it was even filmed.",1012003200,4,1142,4.58128078817734
7839137,3,6303129013,"Caught this flick last night on AMC, not to mention I own it, but it's been a while since I last seen it. But it's safe to say that it still holds it's status as a minor yet very enjoyable B Horror film. Right from the first studio that Dripped blood-""Universal"". This was their 5th and final entry in their Invisible Man series, and while it's not on par(there's no denying it) with it's 4 predeccors, it's definatly an above average B shocker-that still manages to outdistance any of their Mummy films that were being produced at the time(with the exception of The Mummy's Hand(1940), of course) A very classy film for it's kind(for it's status) the film benifits from an Exceptional cast, John Carridine comes to mind. Beautiful Camera work by Milton Krasner, a fine atmosphereic score by Universal regular Hans J. Salter, and some rather compentent if-rather awkward direction by B film specialist Ford Bebe, who seems to have a stronger feel for pacing rather than for atmosphereics, moving the film along in a brisk direction, never making the audience feel bored--a saving grace from that somewhat muddled film script that the filmakers seem to be working from, most notably in the opening and middle reels of the film. Another thing that boggs the film down is the clumsy editing job, theres a certain air about the picture thats seems it could have been benifited by a much tighter constuction, netherless the film as a whole suffers, and the much comedic padding doesn't help matters either. Still u get a film that suceeds in what it's meant to do--entertain. And while the film suffers from scripting and techincal matters...the film still emerges as a slightly above-average B shocker, and one of the very last of  their decent horror entries, before Universal ventured off into the ""non-competent"" era of Horror, the 1945-1946 period, churning out such ""B"" dreadfuls as The Brute Man, and Shewolf of London(both 1946) until they finnaly closed their doors on their Horror product altogether.
