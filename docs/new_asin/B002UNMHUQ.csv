8381343,3,B002UNMHUQ,"Not Jean Dujardin's finest work (OSS 117 takes that honor), but interesting stylistically, because it's like a high contrast, super saturated Western on acid. Still a fun and funny movie though. Worth it to see the French reinterpretation of Billy the Kid and Calamity Jane. Also, I ordered this from Amazon.fr and can confirm that it plays on my unmodified Region A blu-ray player. The description text that says it doesn't work on normal US BR players is just some placeholder text they must slap on all non-native blu-rays. PLUS, it has English subtitles, so it's super import-friendly.",1448150400,,589,5.020408163265306
8381344,2,B002UNMHUQ,"After four French animated features, a couple of not well regarded Terence Hill live-action films and the odd TV series, James Huth's big budget 2009 version of Morris and Goscinny's popular comic book series Lucky Luke doesn't do much to improve the cinematic batting average of the cowboy hero who's so fast he can outdraw his own shadow. Despite seeming perfect casting, an unfocused script renders Jean Dujardin rather hit and miss as the clean cut Wild West idol of millions who never killed a man only to suffer a crisis of conscience after doing just that when he's tasked by the President to clean up his outlaw-infested home town and finds himself confronted with one of the men who killed his parents. A big part of the problem is that, while there's style to spare - imagine a cross between a Jeunet and Caro film and a brightly lit spaghetti western filmed in the kind of Western town that might have been built by the architects of Robert Altman's Popeye - it's not particularly funny and there's not much of a sense of fun either. True, there are a few effective sight gags here and there and it manages to feel like a convincingly live-action version of a cartoon, but the film's occasional bold colour shifts and dramatic lighting changes tend to make more of an impression than the jokes.

It doesn't help that the overpopulated supporting characters aren't ever really given enough comic ammunition, be it Michael Youn's lollipop licking Billy the Kid or Melvil Popaud's Shakespeare-quoting theatrical ham Jesse James, while the film really doesn't know what to do with Sylvie Testud's Calamity Jane once it's taken the trouble to introduce her. The film also tends to amble until its surprisingly effective final showdown in a giant Las Vegas one-armed bandit-cum-funhouse, though it does provide a few injokes for the fans of the books - Luke's childhood sketch is one of the earliest Lucky Luke cartoons and there's a neat post-credits gag about the decision to remove the character's once trademark cigarette in 1983. There's enough that does work to keep you watching and it's certainly better than its reputation, but it's a definite case of great poster, shame about the film.

UGC's French Blu-ray offers a stunning 2.35:1 transfer that shows off the spectacular Argentinean locations very impressively, though the English subtitles are limited to the feature itself and sadly don't translate the onscreen gags punctuating the end credits. Unsubtitled extras are limited to a director's commentary, gag reel, featurette on special effects and lengthy 32-minute selection of stills from the Argentine location with director's commentary. Just be warned that the pressing seems rather temperamental when it comes to loading. The film is also available on an extras-free PAL DVD in the UK.",1374796800,2,2812,5.019271948608137
8381345,4,B002UNMHUQ,"Jean Du jardin looks the part, acts the part and comes the closest more than any other Lucky Luke actor I've seen (Terence Hill, Til Schweiger, etc.) . However, this was still one enjoyable film; although, the script may need a bit more polishing for laughs and action in order to capture the true essence of the Lucky Luke we all got to love.",1352937600,,343,4.375
8381346,5,B002UNMHUQ,"A funny movie. Some gags relate to the history of the comic book, such as the A-patch (get it, Apache?), which helped Luke stop smoking. But then there is the gag as to why he is chewing on a weed (which replaced the dangling cigarette the comic character always had until the nicotine lobby caught up), which was not. Belle and Lucky Luke are man and wife in real life, which makes the ""family tradition"" joke even funnier. There is no rantanplan, the stupidest dog in the world, but then dogs are hard to direct for nuance. Luke says, in French, ""wep"" which would be the French pronunciation of ""yup"" as written. But there is something for everybody, and it is an interesting example of a transfer from comic book to film.",1324252800,3,724,4.492424242424242
8381347,5,B002UNMHUQ,"I'm pretty hard to please. Especially with comedies. This film had me rolling on the floor. Its the best spoof Western since Blazing Saddles. I've read some luke-warm reviews from die hard Lucky Luke fans. This is the first LL film I've seen. I've also not read the comics. So I can't speak from that perspective. But as a stand alone film, this one was great. The visuals - cinematography, camera-work, costumes, makeup, sets -- are absolutely gorgeous.",1300406400,5,454,4.833333333333333
