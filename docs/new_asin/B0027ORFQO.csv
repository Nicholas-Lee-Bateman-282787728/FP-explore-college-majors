8354936,2,B0027ORFQO,"This dvd is a waste of money for any coach. I expected that it would have some drills or offenses to take to my practices but all it is is Baker slapping some pro players names on a few basic moves with a few impressive ones (that he doesn't even explain how to do all that well) and calling it an instructional dvd. If you're a street baller who wants to add something to your game go for it, if you're a coach who wants to diversify your offensive sets, don't waste your money.",1368316800,,479,4.1063829787234045
8354937,5,B0027ORFQO,"Ganon Baker sure has help me & my coaching skills in basketball program. Tips, the techniques, practice drills, the strategies, etc.  This is good for coaches & parents of  basketball players. Especially, in Middle and / or High Schools students.  Win or lose, good or bad calls by the reds, all about having fun, & the love of the game of basketball. Keep the peace. Be safe, have some fun out there.",1353196800,,401,4.541666666666667
