Who can resist the allure of zombies? They're just so much fun. I saw this movie a few months back in the theater and liked it enough to buy a copy. Whether you're a Hindi film fan or you love horror-comedies like Shaun of the Dead then you'll enjoy this one.  Zombie fans won't find much new here - the dead shamble the earth in search of human flesh while the humans try to avoid becoming snack food - but there's a decidedly Indian take. The concept of zombies doesn't exist in Indian culture, as the characters point out as they're going through the list of possible explanations for a sudden outbreak caused by the drugs supplied to rave-party guests by the Russian mafia the previous night. They're about to face certain death when Russian mafioso Boris (played by a blond, bearded and buff Saif Ali Khan) shows up, announcing, ""I keel ded peepul!"" This isn't your grandmother's Hindi film. Unless your grandmother likes weed.

If you think all Hindi movies are loosely based around singing and dancing then you're missing out on some great films from gifted directors and very talented, versatile actors, some of whom are making 3-5 movies a year and not whining about how hard they work to entertain us.  Movies that mix genres and contain song and dance numbers randomly throughout the films are called Masala. While entertaining in their own right, they're only a part of what Bollywood has to offer. Do yourself a favor and check out some of the very best films of 2013, Hindi or otherwise, like Bhag Milka Bhag and Lootera. What you'll find are movies which transcend culture and break cultural stereotypes, offering a refreshing addition (alternative?) to a lot of the crap being churned out by the large American studios. Bollywood has been doing this longer than Hollywood. (Go ahead, look it up.) Indian audiences expect more from cinema than we do. Why settle?

Almost forgot: there's a kickass soundtrack to the movie. There is also a lot of casual pot smoking. If you'e offended you should probably choose something else.",1377907200,,2090,4.762430939226519
