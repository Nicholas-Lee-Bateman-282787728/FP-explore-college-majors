1711893,3,B0000667LK,This is an outstanding DVD. I will watch it repeatedley im sure. but the vocals that i think really should be comming through the center do not all you get is a guitar that sounds like you are listening to a direct feed of his amp. you can barely even hear bruce even in DTS mode,1030147200,,279,4.0
1711894,1,B0000667LK,"Let me first say that I am a huge Maiden fan.  However, this DVD is aweful.  I'll first start off with the sound issue.  There are major problems with the soundtrack, especially the Dolby Digital track.  The sound level fluctuates throughout the entire show as if someone is standing at your stereo receiver messing with the volume control.  This is EXTREMELY distracting.  I tried the DVD on 2 different Dolby Digital set-ups and got the same thing both times.  And if all you have is a Dolby Pro-Logic receiver you might as well forget about is as there is no 2 channel stereo mix provided - only Dolby Digital and DTS.
The next issue, although not as bad as the sound issue, is the editing.  I have never seen so many camera changes in my entire life on a video.  The camera and angle changes every second or two - sometimes it changes within a split second.  It's enough to make you dizzy, or at least make your eyes hurt when you're done watching it.
I'm sure that you will see more reviews like mine soon.  Just check out the Maiden bulletin board where most people are complaining about these same matters.  I have to say that I am majorly disappointed with this as I was really looking forward to its release.  What a shame.  At least the CD release of this show is good.",1030060800,9,1279,4.3872340425531915
1711895,5,B0000667LK,"For all of those who are looking for the best metal concert to see, your in for a total treat by buying this.  What your going to find here isn't slayer, metallica or other talentless, pointless metal.  Your going to find real heavy metal, real music.  Not glamrock, not posers or mallcore, and definitely not sell outs.  It has 3 metal guitarists who simply rule this dvd, and im including Jannick Gers, alot of people will be writing bs saying, Get rid of Jannick, he is terrible, not very good, he ruins the classics.  Come on people wake up!! If maiden thought that then they wouldve got rid of him.  Jannick is not Adrian Smith, and doesnt intend to be, while Adrian isn't Jannick. He isn't going anywhere, he's been in the band for over 12 years now, and has worked too hard to have to just quit or get fired.  Im sure that made alot of you angry, but you know its the truth, just get over it.  If you don't think Jannick is that great of a guitarist, then just try to play his guitar work, and youll see what a guitar wizard or god is all about.  It is certainly these guys, including jannick.  Dave and Jannick change their style alot around live on the solos, because it adds flavor and doesnt make the solo's boring to play, I mean imagine having to play the same solo's every night for 7 months on tour, that would ..., so they add new ideas to it, and its still in the same format and everything.  Dave will tell you that on the interview here.
People will also say Bruce has lost his voice or isn't as good, while you know deep down Bruce has never sounded better with maiden.  This is far better then live after death, maiden have rocked like never before.  Who cares if their all in their 40's-50's, they still live heavy metal.  Even Bruce said so himself in an interview in metal edge.  The band played alot better on rio then live after death,, and added more text to the songs, including the solos. Bruce even sang much better on this, since he was trashed singing on live after death, he didn't sound that hot.
Production wise, well thats all a matter of opinion.  Nicko's drums sound very solid and tight, while he bashes the hell out of them like loose cannons, Steve Harris's bass sounds outstanding blending with 3 guitars, its still lightning intense.  All 3 guitars are right on target production wise.  I myself can hear all 6 of these guys perfectly, so anyone else who thinks otherwise, thats just your opinion.  OK well anyway, this DVD is quite amazing, an outstanding show with an outstatning band.  Disc 2 is a total treat too, which has interviews with each member of the band, and some cool photos taken.  It really is cool, and youll get a better fan's eye view on what the maiden boys like to do besides music.  All in all, weather you like it or not, this is amazing.  It isn't Powerslave, it isn't 7th son, or live after death, its Iron Maiden.  That is it, that is all.  Keep up the great work you metal guys.  Hail the true metal gods...  Eddie Lives... UP THE IRONS...",1029888000,,3010,4.357271095152603
1711896,5,B0000667LK,"The only flaw on this DVD is the absence of at least 1 song from Somewhere In Time. Other than that every aspect of this DVD is superb. The picture and sound quality are the best you will find anywhere. Having been dissapointed with Maidens, ""Raising Hell"" DVD, and still hoping for ""Live After Death"" on DVD, This fills my Maiden DVD void. The show from beginning to end is packed full of energy. The Huge crowd singing word for word throughout only adds to the exitement and energy level. Disc 2 is a great bonus to the show. Seeing the band in an every day setting makes me respect these guys even more. Great to see them all care so much about their fans. All in all A GREAT DVD from A bunch of down to earth guys who just happen to be possibly the best Metal band of all time, especially LIVE...",1029888000,,800,4.201298701298701
1711897,5,B0000667LK,"considering it took several listenings, to make a fair review
of the audio cd version, i have been worried about this dvd for
awhile. however, i am very pleased. my only disappointment is the fact i don't have a surround sound receiver yet which would
give it an extra kick. the sound quality is superb and the visuals are solid. all in all what a great souvenir for anyone
who saw them on tour in 2000-2001. steve did an excellent job editing the visuals and not to much of the retro camera which was
way over used in the live donington video to give more of a live
performance instead of a 2 hour music video. the extras are cool but not as good as the live show. the live show captures the energy and friendship within the band that they haven't shown in years. adrian, actually played to the camera a little. this is the best live performance captured on film of Maiden. the setlist
is slightly boring, but the band more than make up for it in their energy. live after death is a better soundtrack, however as good as the video is and will always be, it lacks the same intensity as rio. this is Maiden at their very best!",1029801600,,1125,4.286384976525822

Audience surround channels. You have a perfect stage configuration,like beeing on the concert. Just a small compare with Eagles Hell freezes over,where drums,bass guitar,and lead vocal are all in the center channel,big mistake. Tell me how many people use a full range speaker for the center channel.
I was a big fan of Maiden s in the 80 s and after all this years is still a great plesaure hear and see the guys rocking and enjoying in their music. Fantastic.",1028073600,6,631,5.196078431372549

1711913,4,B0000667LK,"This DVD is not without it's flaws, the worst being the packaging. The cheap foam inserts holding the discs in place both came off during shipping resulting in heavy scuffing on both discs. Cheap,cheap,cheap! Luckily my player was able to view them with only a couple of brief hiccups. The audio/video quality is good, but not great. I've heard better audio mixes & watching 4:3 aspect ratio nowadays makes the video seem dated(shouldn't we have had 16:9 seeing as this show is 2001?). Of course the editing could be slowed down a lot, but it's not the worst I've seen. And the bonus disc is nothing to get excited about.
  The 4 stars are earned by my favorite Maiden line-up, playing at their best, in front of a massive ,loving crowd. It's an event well worth watching.",1375488000,,772,4.627737226277373

Anyway, fast forward almost a decade and Iron Maiden are back in top form, performing better than ever with the guitar god Adrian Smith and one of the best vocalist in in the history of heavy metal.",1348704000,,368,4.382352941176471

1711922,5,B0000667LK,This DVD absolutely kicks a**!  I never tire of watching this show. Iron Maiden shows how much energy they still have to this day. Bruce Dickenson has one of the best voices of all time. From any genre. You can't go wrong purchasing this DVD.,1310860800,,242,4.377777777777778
1711923,3,B0000667LK,"I'm a huge Maiden fan and I have been trying to fill out my collection of CDs and DVDs for a while. I did not have, nor had I seen, the Rock In Rio DVD. I was very excited when it arrived and I couldn't wait to watch it. When I opened the flimsy packaging the first thing I noticed was that the DVDs were sliding around freely. The tiny foam pads that were supposed to be holding them in place had ripped loose from the package at some point during shipping. Consequently the DVDs were pretty scratched up. It took two passes with a repair kit to get the discs to play without freezing up in the DVD player.

The concert itself was amazing. Rock In Rio was the last stop on Maiden's Brave New World tour and they didn't hold back one bit! The extras were also very good, showing what the guys do on a day off.",1302307200,,809,4.05625
1711924,5,B0000667LK,"Of any Iron Maiden Show on DVD, this is one of my favorites and the 2nd DVD is very nice showing ""backstage"" and off the record footage of band members. Nice picture quality and superb sound. I met them on 2008 in a plane flown by Bruce on his flight 666 to Warsaw and Prague and they are just as you see in this DVD.",1257292800,,317,3.8923076923076922
1711925,4,B0000667LK,"Iron Maiden always seem to deliver live, that does happen in this dvd.  The only negative aspect would have to be the production, with regards to the ever changing camera angles, at times it can get annoying, as has been pointed out in other reviews.  However, I found it reasonably watchable with only the odd occassion that got on my nerves.  Musically Iron Maiden is sounding as good, if not better than earlier efforts.  If you are wanting a full greatest hits package the Live After Death and Flight 666 dvds are excellent additions. Rock In Rio is a good dvd that first introduced the current lineup. Its good to see these legends still going strong after all these years.",1254700800,,678,4.625

1711927,1,B0000667LK,"I love this band to death, BUT this is just unwatchable. Seems like the Editing wand broke on Steve. And it's really a shame because it could have been up there with LAD. On this concert we hear Bruce singing songs from the Blaze era from FOD and some old material too. It would have been great to sit back and enjoy, but I'm afraid you have to watch this at your own risk of a possible seizure or a blinding headache. Sad really :(

1711939,1,B0000667LK,"Harris takes a great concert and manages to destroy it with the most hyperactive editing I've ever seen.

Normally when watching things I never even think about the editing.  Editing is something you shouldn't think about when it's done right.  You shouldn't notice it.  You only notice it when it bad, and it's really bad here.  I think that had 24 cameras and Harris seems to be of the philosophy that you must show a shot from each of them within every minute.  He can't do something wild & crazy thing like focus on Bruce while Bruce is singing.  He has to randomly jump around from one shot to another to another to another to another to another to another to another to another to another to another to drive a viewer to the brink of total insanity.

All I wanted to do was strangle Harris as I watched it.",1241136000,4,812,4.366666666666666

1711941,4,B0000667LK,"Finally got around to playing Visions on a new Blu_ray player and there is a cut from this disc in that one as a bonus or whatever.  The sound of the cut from this disc just blew me away and I ordered RiR the next day.  The picture quality is GREAT and the DTS sound track is just wall to wall, 9 on a 10 scale.  Two negatives however, the video editing is nauseating.  The picture does not stay on the screen from one camera for more than just a few seconds at a time.  I think the box says they used 18 cameras and they edited the video switching between them as fast as humanly possible, Bruce's vocals could have been mixed/edited/overdubbed just a little better.  There are a couple of drop outs on the vocals during the show.  Nothing is perfect but this could have easily been fixed in post production.

In summation:  PQ gets 5 stars, video editing 3 stars, Sound FIVE BIG STARS.  The sound from this show will knock you down, run over you, back up and run over you again.  Buy or Die!",1228780800,2,993,4.201058201058201
1711942,5,B0000667LK,"Superb eighteen song DVD of the notorious Iron Maiden playing to an extremely large crowd in 2001. Fortunately, I got to see them a year before that. Semi-promising tracks off their new (at the time) disc 'Brave New World' included the title track, ""Ghost Of The Navigator"" and ""Dream Of Mirrors"". Sound and picture quality here are top notch. Of course, we also get to thoroughly soak in plenty of that good 'ol classic Maiden like ""The Trooper"", ""The Evil That Men Do"", one of my personal Maiden favorites - the awesome ""Number Of The Beast"", ""Hallowed Be Thy Name"" and the '80's metal foot-stomper ""Run To The Hills"". For me, one of the most memorable scenes on this DVD is during the song ""Iron Maiden"", when vocalist Bruce Dickinson bonds with several women (who are dressed to be sacrificed) groups in and willingly enters an actual iron maiden - the ancient torture device. Highly recommended.",1222732800,,900,4.7756410256410255

Contrary to some other reviews, this DVD has plenty of old classics like ""2 Minutes to Midnight"", ""Wrath child"", and ""The Number of the Beast"", and the newer stuff totally rocks.  The dueling guitars in the second half of ""The sign of the Cross"" are just classic, even by old school Maiden standards.  Up the Irons!",1222646400,,404,4.661971830985915
1711944,1,B0000667LK,"The music on this set is filled with some of Maiden's best work and is played to near perfection.  However, the production and editing of this DVD is terrible.  The concert footage contains a dizzy-ing number of camera shots and completely wrecks the Iron Maiden experience.  For example, on 2 Minutes to Midnight, a song that is approximately 6 minutes long, the average camera shot is 2 seconds long with the longest being about 5 seconds and a large number of shots being 1 second or less.  Image, approximately 180 camera shots in one song. The camera shots change so quickly, that you cannot appreciate the music or the musicians.  The multiple shots get pretty annoying in just a short period of time.  Additionally, the camera shots seem to have no relevance to the moment.  For example, when the lead guitarest is in the middle of a great riff as he played on Blood Brothers, why would I want to watch 1 second of the drummer, 1 second of the crowd, 1 second of the singer, 1 second of the bass player, then back to 3 seconds of the guitar player?  Just leave it on the guitar player.

For a full appreciation of an Iron Maiden concert, I recommend the Live After Death DVD.  This DVD better captures the excitement and energy of an Iron Maiden show.

As for Rock in Rio, I recommend purchasing the CD instead of the DVD.  The music and sound are fantastic.",1222041600,3,1365,4.481781376518219

1711948,5,B0000667LK,"Maiden's Rock in Rio is a fantastic DVD concert. It depicts them on the last date of their Brave New World tour in front of 250, 000 people at Rio de Janiero's ""Rock in Rio"" festival. Great set list, and Bruce's energy shows the band's enthusiasm.

The audio is amazing, if you have it wired correctly you can hear the Guitars and bass from the left and right speakers, Bruce's voice from the subwoofer, and the drums from the back speaker. The audio DOES rise and fall in a few quick places, but that doesn't distract you from the awesome-liciousness of the film. Yes, the editing was fast but I didn't mind it, and after 12 minutes I barely noticed it anymore, at least not when compared to the AWFUL editing of Death on the Road where you can hardly keep up.

Some fun facts about Maiden in Rio:

-Bruce went fencing in Rio
-Adrian went fishing in Rio
-The band had began their set at 12:02 AM
-This was Maiden's final tour date for the BNW tour
-The band had some...fun backstage, as seen on the ""Day In The Life"" feature on the second disc

1711961,2,B0000667LK,"I'm going to attempt to keep this short... I've seen Maiden live twice and watched Maiden England and this DVD. I thought their live shows were weak at best. Maiden England was a great video but this DVD was a true disappointment. I'm not sure what it is but this band seems to have difficulty coming together musically live. It's like everyone is playing at their own time and it doesn't come together like it does in the studio.

Now back to this specific DVD...

1. The first annoying thing you notice is how the camera shots change constantly in seconds. If they had 10 cameras filming I think it's safe to say all 10 got equal time. Eventually it makes you dizzy and you can't even focus on the concert you've paid for. Imagine going to a concert and turning your head to look at EACH musician for literally a mere second. Now over the course of the concert you've moved your head thousands of times... You get the picture and break out the Dramine.

2. The mix is poor. You can clearly hear the levels constantly rise and fall.

3. Bruce Dickinson is hyped up and runs all over the stage mumbling and screaming into the mic incoherently. Dickinson falls into the same catagory as Ozzy or DL Roth as a good frontman and a good ""studio"" voice after the clean-up and the final mix but live couldn't carry a tune in a wheelbarrow. Combined with the crappy camera work it's a disaster.

4. Again the band's timing is off or the mix is bad so things don't fit together the way they should.

On the positive side, the camera works is incredibly clear and the sound likewise but...

I'll sum it up this way...

If your a die-hard Maiden fan: You'll love it but you'll own anything they put out and accept it.

If you enjoy Maiden and want to see them perform (such as I): There's gotta be better choices out there but they are a band who tries to market everything they can so buyer beware.

If your Maiden experience is limited: If you watch this show you might not want to ever listen to Maiden again and move on to another band.

I now wish I didn't purchase this DVD.

I'm sure the show itself was great but the video wasn't!

We scour the web to find the best concerts and this isn't one of them.

I'm obviously a Maiden fan but I'm not going to mislead anyone. I've paid the price for you! Keep searching for a better live Maiden performance.

1711963,5,B0000667LK,"1. The Wicker Man: Excellent way to start off a concert, with brlliant light effects. 5/5

2. Ghost of the Navigator: Probably Steve's highlight, and a good job he did too. 5/5

3. Brave New World: Starts off excellent, and the first verse is even better. However Bruce made a slight mistake in the second verse. 4/5

4. Wrathchild: My favourite headbanger. Awesome, and the crowd are brilliant. 6/5

5. 2 Minutes to midnight: My second favourite on here, particularly the intro and chorus are brilliant. Verses are also more than excellent, and the song just couldt have been made better. 8/5

6. Blood Brothers: Never really has been a great favourite, but it wasn't a bad attempt. 4/5

7. Sign of the Cross: Vastly underrated by Maiden, and should have stayed a classic. Awesome performance, even the really long instrumental bit is done well. 6/5

8. The Mercenary: A classic live, and probably won't ever be this good again. The best for stunts, this is one of the fastest songs they ever wrote. 5/5

9. The Trooper: Not one of the best, but still awesome. Bruce waves the Britain flag while he isn't singing. 5/5

10. Dream of Mirrors: The worst song on the DVD, but still not bad. 3.5/5

11. The Clansman: The audience are brilliant in this song, and the freedom cry is one of the best things on the DVD. 5/5

12. The Evil that Men Do: You won't be disappointed by this. Best bit is when Janick Gers fights Eddie with his guitar, and at the end of the song Eddie walks away. 6/5

13. Fear of the Dark: Awesome live, as always. A lot of the song Bruce doesn't even need to sing, because the audience do it for him. Even that doesn't make the song worse. 6/5

Now we near the end...

14. Iron Maiden: Guitaring is very unusual because the band do someting to totally change the style. At the end, Bruce goes inside an Iron Maiden, and then he reappears just before the next song. 6/5

15. The Number of the Beast: My classic favourite, but i love this version lots. Bruce does sound a bit weak on the vocals, but it puts effect to make the song better. Nothing better than this! 12/5

16. Hallowed be Thy Name: Excellent vocals and guitaring, sand thats all i have to say. 5/5

17. Sanctuary: I don't see the point in giving this less just because of the audience. The audience didn't manage to get into this at all, but the band performed it well. 5/5

18. Run to the hills: An all-time classic which remained famous for 25 years, and will probably still be famous when im dead (im 13). An excellent way to end a concert, and all the band members perform it well. Nicko McBrain even plays the drums without the heads. Up the Irons!!!!!!!!!! 6.5/5

Best bit: The fight with the troll in ""The Evil that Men Do""

Worst bit: The pause between ""Iron Maiden"" and ""The Number of the Beast"" is unnecessarily long, but at least they play my favourite song afterwards.

In spite of it being the final show of another long worldwide trek, you can tell they really enjoy what they do.  Most amazing to me was the inclusion of a couple of the Blaze Bayley-era tracks, which if anything, Bruce takes to another level!

There is no band in my opinion that has been able to capture their essence in the dvd format better than Iron Maiden.  The sound on this dvd is incredible.  The three guitars mesh incredibly well in the studio and live.  They play with such precision it's remarkable.  The camera work is great but I do wish they didn't cut from camera to camera as frequently as they do.  That of course, is certainly not limited to this dvd as I find it to be the case with most concert dvds.  As with any band with an extensive catalog, there are some songs I would substitute but this isn't a chinese food place.  This concert is from that tour and thus, we get that set list.  This dvd is a must have for all metal fans.  Those wishing to check out what Iron Maiden is all about or those who have been upping the irons for decades will be thoroughly pleased.

But, along with everyone else, it would have been nice if the cameras could have lingered for longer than 3 seconds at a time on one musician or vocalist, as the case may be.  The camera work gave me a headache!!!  Also, Janick Gers is such a tiresome twit!!!  I was happy with the lack of audience members mugging for the camera, however. (Thank you, IM!!)  The Day in the Life of the band on the second disc wasn't anything to write home about, I could have skipped it entirely. (I had to wonder why they even bothered with the Easter Egg portions.)

I would rent this again, but I wouldn't buy it.  I will buy the CD or download the album instead.",1167004800,4,819,4.205128205128205
1711967,4,B0000667LK,"Being a fan since 1981 I gave up after '86-'88 when it all started sounding the same to me. And the last CD I REALLY liked was Powerslave (actually album at the time!!). But a friend has this and I must say I liked it a lot and several new songs immediately caught my ear!!! And when I found that ""Bloodbrothers"" and ""Dream of Mirrors"" were off the same CD I went and bought ""Brave New World"" and really enjoyed it. It reminds me of the classic era and I really don't understand the fans underrating this CD. Oh well.

It also has a pretty good representation of older material though I have several better versions of my all time Favorite - ""Hallowed Be Thy Name"". The band is in top form and it's VERY refreshing to hear that one of THE great voices in metal hasn't diminished with age like so many others!! Bruce must have a secret that Coverdale, Gillan, etc, etc don't know about!!!

But, as you can guess from the title of this review, I won't be truly happy until they pull their heads out and release the classic ""Live After Death"" on 5.1 DVD; I have just about worn out the VHS!!! Bruce, Steve, Dave...guys.....come on...please!!!

This is a very very good show to an aweosme crowd (250 thousand people) people have disputed the setlist including the previous reviewer saying its missing alot of the classics and while it is missing the old classics, the new stuff is just as good, ghost of navigator, the wicker man, blood brothers and Brave new world are all classics in their own right and by the way you don't miss out on 2 mins to midnight or run to the hills, hallowed be thy name or number of the beast.  If your more a fan of the old classics then i would strongly reccommend the Live After Death dvd instead of Rock In Rio.  The only problem i have with Rock in Rio is that Janic Gers gets more solos than the great Adrian Smith.  Don't get me wrong Janic is a very good guitarist and deserves credit for his work in  Maiden, but Adrian Smith please he is one of the best and technically perfect guitarists ever.

Awesome act although not as good as Death On The Road.  Rock in Rio finds a happy medium between Live After Death and Death On The Road.

Bottom line, buy it now its a remarkable show by a remarkable band. Cheers.

1711969,3,B0000667LK,"Anyone who has ever seen Iron Maiden live knows that they are one of the greatest live acts on the planet. They have energy, flash, and enough killer songs to fill up a two-hour set with no problems. Rock in Rio is their first attempt to bring this unbelievable experience home on DVD. Unfortunately, it doesn't quite grab the live Maiden experience, mainly because of the setlist.

By no means is Rock in Rio a bad performance. The classics present here are given fiery renditions by the current six-piece Maiden lineup. On the standards like The Trooper, The Number of the Beast, and Hallowed Be Thy Name, the awesome power of live Maiden is impossible to doubt. The problem is that the set is bogged down with so much crap. Brave New World, the new album at the time, is disproportionately represented to say the least. In the interest of completeness, Maiden kill about 20 minutes of potentially incredible set time to play out-and-out crap from the Blaze Bayley albums - 20 minutes that could have been used to put some other neglected classics like Still Life or Killers into the show. This is a bad move, and it does major damage to the set.

Also, despite having a quarter of a million screaming Brazilians in attendance, the DVD is shot on low-quality fullscreen video. A performance of this immensity demands widescreen presentation, like AC/DC did for their Donington show in 1991.

For the Maiden faithful, Rock in Rio is essential. It shows a newly reunited Maiden before a great audience, playing their classics very well. Unfortunately, the weak setlist choices just murder the potential intensity of the show. Maiden hardcores and casual fans alike will be far more pleased with the superlative History of Iron Maiden DVDs. Take it or leave it.",1151452800,,1760,4.801980198019802

1711985,3,B0000667LK,"First, the music on this DVD is spectacular! I recommend any IM fan to pick up the CD version of this concert which, as far as I could tell, is the same music as the DVD. See my review of the CD for more.

On the plus side -- it's good to see Bruce and Adrian back with the boys. Although in their mid to late 50s, they still put on a heck of a show.

Some gripes -- if you do not have Dolby 5.1 or DTS, you'll be disappointed. I watched the video on my laptop through stereo headphones (the DVD audio menu doesn't have a stereo option), and all of the rear channels were completely wiped out, which means most of the crowd noise was gone (which is a bummer on songs like ""The Clansman"" and ""Hallowed Be Thy Name"" but a plus on songs like ""The Evil that Men Do""). It's also hard to tell which guitarist is in which channel some of the time (how do you port 3 guitarists through 2 channels?!). On Live After Death, Dave Murray took the left channel exclusively and Adrian Smith the right channel exclusively. I imagined that the production designers would funnel Murray into the left channel, Smith into the center channel (or rather, ""both"" R+L channels), and Gers into the right channel, but that's not always the case. Smith's signal roams a bit depending on what he's doing (and he totally leaves the stage during the intro to ""Fear of the Dark,"" which he states on the Iron Maiden official website is his favorite to play from the years he was outside the band!). I'm also a bit disappointed with the song list. With Adrian back, it would be nice to hear some of his stuff like ""Wasted Years,"" ""Heaven Can Wait"" (which the band attempted to keep playing after Smith left and failed miserably each time I heard them play it), anything off of ""Powerslave"" (besides ""2 Minutes to Midnight""), ""Still Life,"" ""The Prisoner,"" etc.

The main gripe that I have is very, very serious. I adore Steve Harris immensely. I think he is the best bassist of his music genre, hands down. However, I don't think he's a very good production supervisor/editor of movies (I believe he edited this DVD). Here's why: during the DVD, you probably view each shot for about 3 seconds (maximum!) before switching to another band member or angle. Honestly, I felt like I was in some kind of blasted haunted house with a strobe light the whole time. I actually felt dizzy after a few songs. The constant switching of cameras and angles is terrible. I remember watching Live After Death on video tape years ago and that was a great production; lots of wide angle shots, and none of this hyper-camera switching going on. It's not the production quality of the film that's poor, it's the editing that needed help.

One last thing -- Guys, lose the spandex. The 80s are over. And Murray, stop wearing Iron Maiden t-shirts. It's corny to wear your own band's shirt.

If you're a completist, you'll want it. If not, I suggest just renting the DVD from an online video rental company, watching it, enjoying it, and then returning it.",1125100800,6,3000,4.477148080438757
1711986,5,B0000667LK,"Now that's a real live Metal DVD! Obviously Iron Maiden's not your fly-by-night 80's head-baggin' rockers, they lived and breathe Metal and more to come for sure. This release includes some serious new tracks that sounded like classics.

Are they trying to hide something?  Did the band lack energy?  I love the band, but I think it was a mistake for Steve Harris to cut this himself.  I never criticise unless I can do better myself...  and I have (see Manowar's Hell on Earth's Part 2, 3 and 4).  Just because you have 18 cameras, doen't mean you have to use them all within the space of a minute.  It's not modern and it's not cool.  It is embarrassing. Live After Death is still a great production.  Why go backwards! Live DVDs, like a good wine, should be allowed to breathe a little.  I look forward to the next Maiden DVD.

1711988,5,B0000667LK,"Very long time Maiden fan posting.  Like a lot of the reviewers here, I lost interest in Maiden after the Live after Death/Somewhere in Time period.  Honestly, it was more of my life/priorities changing, than Maidens music.  Does this DVD ever prove that point.  I'm still shocked/stoked at how GREAT this DVD is !  I can't figure out what took me so long to pick it up.  Maybe it was the low expectations I had regarding song titles I wasn't familiar with ... or the reviews regarding the camera angles/changes.  Whatever it was disappeared the second Adrian hits the first chords of Wicker Man ... actually the build up to that point gives you goosebumps.  There ARE a TON of camera changes, and yeah as a guitarist, I would have liked to have seen a little more solo sections shown longer up close ... but Harris didn't totally blow it with the rapid changes ( he really should have toned it a bit down though ).  The changes keep you as a viewer constantly absorbed in each song.  Seeing, and most importantly capturing the energy of all the band members at any given time is damn hard to display over a tv screen.  Even seeing them live with the whole spectacle you miss a lot ... ESPECIALLY with a stage that big.  I never thought I'd see a Maiden production to rival Live after Death, and although the stage set up was better in 85, this production with all the camera angles exceeds it for the viewer.  I saw Maiden up close in 85 at Long Beach Arena when they filmed and recorded Live after Death.  I also saw them sitting further back for the Somewhere in Time tour at Irvine Meadows.  Up close, you have a limited view ... turn your head to see one thing, and you miss a couple others.  Far back, you see the stage/light show better, but a bunch of ants running around the stage.  I think Harris realized this too ... it's spooky how well this dvd conveys the energy a Maiden show produces.  Remember, theres 6 guys to cover ( actually Janick Gers moves so much he should count for two ), PLUS the 250,000 fans going beserk singing and clapping along the ENTIRE time.  THOSE are fans !  The real treat for me was hearing newer Maiden material and feeling as if I just discovered some lost classic album.  Although I would have loved to have seen more ""jurassic"" classics like Phantom of the Opera or Killers performed, I tell you what ... Sign of the Cross and Clansman just rip your head off.  I'd never heard those songs before, and they came across as instant classics.  I didn't intend to be long winded here, but it seems the excitement Maiden conveys in their shows is contageous ... even after all these years.  Buy this DVD, and if you don't like it, I'll buy it from you since I know Im going to wear out my current one.  Watching this takes me back to Long Beach Arena in 85 ... Scream for me Brazil !

p.s.  the 2nd DVD is pretty cool in showing the various band members doing what they love to do on days off.  The Janick Gers segment is especially well done.  I knew nothing of the man, since I basically stopped following Maiden once he joined ... his attitude and positive views on life and Maiden show why they are even stronger today than they ever were",1108512000,13,3181,4.353140916808149

So, I put the disc on my DVD and what did I find? That Steve Harris edited it. Listen, dude, I can deal with changing angles each three seconds, or even two... But I can not deal with changing cameras four times within a second!! So, by the middle of the show I was not caring anymore, it was so annoying that, in dissilusion, I turned off the DVD and watched the other half the next day.

Why did Steve Harris dit it? I don't know. He proved he's the total boss (deservedly, of course), because I can not see how anyone involved (the band members, the managers, the record company, whoever!) did not tell him that his edtiing was awful, not professional, headache inducing...

I blast in the face and ears assault on my thinking that the band went downhill after 1985.  How wrong I was.  This DVD is a testament to how amazing this band was in the past and is still so today.  Bruce Dickenson's delivery is flawless with all the enigmatic prowess that one expects from a group of this caliber.  Every member of this band displays mind-boggling virtuosity.

You just new Steve Harris was going to release another concert film of that tour.  Maiden just seems to equal the love of money lately and judging from the numerous times of reissues and greatest hits in the past, wants their fans to keep shelling out and boy do we ever.  All in the expectation of returning to the greatness they had when their 1st concert film ""Live After Death"" was released.  I think that was 1985.  This dvd has a great sound, great color and picture but it kills itself with the constant changing of images from the oh so many camera angles.  How I would have loved to watch any of the band take guitar solos and show it not a second here then a second here with constant shots edited at strobe light effect but in its entirety.  This is just too much visual information, it overloads my sensory system.  It is a nice memory of the tour of which songs were played and what they made ""Eddie"" look like on that particular tour.

This song has an intro that shows Bruce in excellent shape. Of course there are the classic closers Fear of the Dark, Iron Maiden, Sanctuary, Number of the Beast, Hallowed Be Thy Name and Run the Hills. There are also hits from the 80's The Evil that Men Do, The Trooper, 2 Minutes to Midnight and Wrathchild. No track from Somewhere in Time, although it's the album that sounds closest to their current sound, and also nothing from No Prayer For the Dying. Fans of Iron Maiden know that they are not ashamed to play songs from the Blaze-era, which I think shine as much as the ones from the golden era: the epic numbers The Clansman and The Sign of the Cross. If you are a fan, you probably already own this on DVD and double audio CD, if you are trying to get into Maiden then this is a good point to do so.

The DTS mix is unreal!! It's so loud and clear, I haven't even tried the Dolby 5.1 mix!! ""Sign of the Cross"" makes my sub want to explode so that's cool hahaha
Watching Bruce use the stage is really good to see, he's a champ!! I hear he's a little uptight in person but I don't give a damn!!! Nicko's always cool to watch, even though the audiance must have barely seen him behind his huge cage of percussion! It's funny when he starts dancing behind the kit on ""The Clansman.""

GHOST OF THE NAVIGATOR: The best song here
2 MINS TO MIDNIGHT: Gr8 riff from Gers,good crowd participation
THE CLANSMAN: Nice solos from Murray and Gers
EVIL THAT MEN DO: an amazing intro, check out Gers battle with mascot Eddie
HALLOWED BE THY NAME: an all round great participation from the whole band and the crowd of 250 000
NUMBER OF THE BEAST: chuckle as a rather exited brazilian fan runs on stage and taps Harris on the shoulder, only to be quickly removed :)
RUN TO THE HILLS: an obligatory closer to the concert  the most well remembered song here.
Well iv never heard a better live album and this shines!! gr8 vocals, gr8 crowd, gr8 band, and EDDIE!! what more could u want???",1079740800,,1019,4.363157894736842
1712039,2,B0000667LK,"Before I say anything about the live DVD version of Iron Maiden's ROCK IN RIO, I must say this: ""Steve Harris, you're a unique bass player, good songwriter, and metal legend - please stay out of the editing room, thank you!!""  More on that later.  After being blown away by the double-CD version of ROCK IN RIO, I was really expecting a lot out of the filmed concert.  The band's performance is tight and singer Bruce Dickinson has never sounded better than he does here.  So how come all that energy comes through in the CD but not on the DVD?  Simple: there's too much going on and there's so little time to show it all.
For one thing, the sound is absolutely atrocious compared to the CD version.  On the CD, the production was raw but very listenable and every vocal and instrument could be heard well, including the crowd.  On the DVD, the sound is cranked up way past 11 and becomes hugely unlistenable.  I couldn't really tell what was going on; it was just one big sonic whirlwind of noise and nothing else.  As I mentioned in the intro, bass player and band leader Steve Harris did the editing, and you can clearly tell this guy didn't go to film school.  The editing is very fast, very choppy, very flawed, and extremely headache-inducing.  I swear, I thought I was gonna have a seizure midway through the concert!  And whenever someone solos, whether it be Adrian, Janick, or Dave, the editing doesn't pause long enough to see either them work their magic on the fretboards.  Very disappointing.  Not since the movie ARMAGEDDON have I seen so many annoying 2-second cuts.
The DVD isn't entirely all bad.  Some of the more intimate songs like ""Blood Brothers"" and ""Fear of the Dark"" really showcase Maiden's love for the crowd and their love back, with brief slowed down edits (finally!).  And watching Bruce Dickinson hop over the speakers, climb to the top of the stage set, and sing his heart out into every song is truly something to behold, proving he's one of rock's greatest and unsung frontmen.  The special features are pretty cool as they show the Maiden members doing un-rock & roll things, like fencing, playing golf, or going to a soccer game.  Nicko has his own spot, and appears in Dave Murray's bit, which is pretty funny.
But all that cannot save the fact that the awesome Rock in Rio performance has been ruined in the hands of Harris.  God, Steve what were you thinking?  Overall, if you had to choose between the double CD or the double DVD, stick with the CD.  It sounds a lot better and your mind won't turn to mush by watching Harris' hyperactive editing.  Maiden are still a great live band, but the ROCK IN RIO DVD does not do them justice.",1075593600,4,2675,4.529166666666667
1712040,4,B0000667LK,"I saw Maiden in 2000 on this Brave New World Tour.  They were phenomenal!  This DVD is my personal souvenir from that tour.  The band kill on this DVD.  The video quality and audio is first rate.  The extras are decent but not impressive.  My only gripe is the editing of this concert.  If you don't take your eyes off of it, you'll feel nauseous after awhile.  It is so choppy, and Steve Harris didn't leave one camera still for longer than 5 seconds!!!  It's way to much and too choppy.  Other than that, no other complaints.",1074124800,5,527,4.34020618556701
1712041,5,B0000667LK,"I have ""discovered"" Iron Maiden this year. Heard only a few songs over the years and was generally unmoved. However, having reacquainted myself with them I am duly impressed.
The Rock in Rio DVD is not perfect, with, as mentioned earlier, sometimes dizzying changes in camera angles. Have to give Steve Harris credit though, he does give everyone a fair exposure, and you really don't mind the changes.
To me, a live performance is where the rubber hits the road. No studio magic, overdubs or computer tracking. You either have it nailed or you perish. Sure, sometimes live performance recording is lacking in sound or video perfection, but do you expect that when you see someone live?
The musicianship of Maiden is top notch. Not just an average metal band. Complicated and difficult tempos, tasteful key changes, great lead guitar spread equally between Janick Gers and Dave Murray, with Adrian Smith laying down the crunching bottom end with deafening riffs. Steve Harris is a little annoying with his constant ""foot on the monitor"" poses and lip synching of Bruce Dickinsons singing, but, cut Steve some slack, he is the main songwriter of this band and displays some credible talent in this aspect. He wrote 70 songs after all.
Bruce Dickinson doesn't falter an inch. His pipes are clean and crisp with good energy. Nico McBrain is great, laying down the drum lines which bring the other players together to create some memorable songs, ie. ""Sign of the Cross"". You try playing that song on your guitar, bass or drums. ha. not!
The best things I like about Iron Maiden is that they are my age, and they can rock better than the talent that are dotting the rock/metal scene these days. No comparisons. (Well, Metallica is coming back to their roots).
I find myself collecting DVDs now that display the ever- disappearing talent from the groups of the 60's through the 80's. Clapton, Stevie Ray, Deep Purple, Queen, Pink Floyd, Black Sabbath. Zepplin,  and now, Maiden.
Yeah, I know, its from my era, but really, where is the talent now compared to the bands from that time period?
Sum 41? Blink 182? Linkin Park?..... I don't think so.
Rock on Iron Maiden, and thanks!",1070582400,3,2173,4.810160427807487
1712042,2,B0000667LK,"The worst thing that could happen for Iron Maiden was when its founder, its boss, the marvellous bass player and songwriter called Steve Harris decided to edit this DVD. I don't understand it.
Theoretically trying to ""capture"" the famous Maiden energy and vibe on stage, he opted for using a ultra-fast edition that will make your head spin, without paying any attention for who is soloing at the moment, if Nicko is at the middle of a great drums flourish, etc. All of the takes last, in their majority, less than one second and a half. The result was that you simply have no pleasure watching this MTV-styled DVD, thanks to its terrible edition.
Well, that's my opinion. Of course, the ""UP THE IRONS"" guys will love anything this deservedly great band release.",1069718400,2,762,4.7368421052631575

1712044,3,B0000667LK,"This DVD is visually great, fast cuts from many camera angles and a general sense of the size of the show. The problem with this DVD is in the audio mix. I run typical 5.1DD in bitstream through a fiber optic cable. In doing so, I have Janick's guitar coming full-blast through the center channel (see other reviews on that issue)and Bruce's voice, in fine form, is banished to a half-volume hell somewhere between the front speakers with the crowd screaming through the rear speakers. The crowd often drowns out Bruce entirely. There is a solution, however. Switching from bitstream to PCM downgrades the surround sound to Dolby Pro-Logic (limiting my amount of adjustable variables, delay etc.) and puts Bruce back to proper level in the center channel.

From the moment the show begins, we see this is truth. Their energy is blistering, their perfomance is fantastic, Bruce is singing like never.
But the edition..... My God, what was Steve Harris thinking???!! He destroyed the whole DVD, trying to put takes from all the cameras into every single minute of the songs! It's simply annoying!

I too was impressed with Bruce's versions of ""Sign Of The Cross"" & ""The Clansman""; they sound SO much better with him singing!

Seems a lot of people on here are trying to review this without the benefit of surround sound which to me would seem to be impossible because you can't possibly experience this without it!

Anyway, that is not my complaint, my only complaint is maybe a silly one, is with the band itself. Call it eighties withdrawl if you will (who knows) but i don't like their new image. Liked bruce with long hair, and I think they have lost some of their stage presence. Which is unbderstandable, they are not 20 anymore.

My head hurts from head-banging and playing this DVD at very high volume.
My head also hurts from the dizzying camera changes.
I know they filmed this w/18 cameras but they didn't have to use all of them within the context of four minute songs.
The editing was enough to give me a headache.
Camera was never focused for more than a second or two on any particular angle which made for an unpleasent viewing experience at times.
Just when the guitar solo would start we'd get a nice 2 second shot of Nikko, then 2 seconds of Bruce, then 2 seconds of Steve and, oh yeah, 2 seconds of the bloke actually playing the solo!
Steve Harris, stick to playing/writing music because I didn't care much for your editing, mate.
I love the band and enjoyed the song selection, though.
I think ""Brave New World"" was a great release and enjoyed seeing many of these songs performed on the DVD.

Then Nicko then back to Dickinson then to Harris then over to Gerrs, then back to the fans, back to Harris, then back to Dickinson who jumps off part of the stage, then right in the middle of the jump back to Nicko, then the fans in all of fifteen seconds, during ""Brave New World"" Gerrs is doing a solo yet the camera is all over the place BUT NOT ON HIM!!!. Also the sound is great however I think Dickinson was TOO SPOT-ON with his vocals.  The band should be ashamed to release this. I tried to watch this twice and I got a headache both times. Then there's the fact that it's a two disc set and the second disc is truly worthless it's ""Rock in Rio"" not ""Talk in Rio"" Also the packaging of this set is basically a piece of cardboard which could scratch both discs. I though maiden cared about their fans but I guess they don't, this set shows maiden is just trying to milk money from their fans with really a really bad product.",1041206400,8,1080,4.167464114832536
1712094,5,B0000667LK,"January 19, 2001 marked perhaps the highest point in Iron Maiden's career. It was approximately 25 years before this date that Steve Harris, Dave Murray and a plethora of their early members were gigging all around the East End and throughout their hometown with ambitions to be on top of the world. On that day in January, they triumphed over ambition as one of the headliners at the Rock in Rio festival, playing before 250,000 people. This DVD isn't just a live concert; it's a part of Heavy Metal history.
Iron Maiden has always been known for their over-the-top performances and this DVD definitely captures the best of the best. Every member puts everything they have into playing the music. Disc One of the set is the actual live show, edited and mastered by Steve Harris himself. Disc Two is some bonus footage including interviews, a photo gallery, web site links and a portion entitled 'A Day In The Life'. The last of which I believe can also be found on the Rock In Rio double album.
Disc One. The quality is very good. It's clean and crisp. I didn't find any problems with it at all. Obviously, if you've heard the double CD, you'll know what the sound quality is. However, you experience the full effect of the music and the show, you should probably have two speakers on your TV. With just one, some of the sound is lost (in my case, all of Janick's guitar parts aren't heard). I don't know if it's the DVD but do yourself a favor anyway.
The footage itself is amazing, in my opinion. Shot from a series of different cameras, Steve Harris viewed all of it and spliced it all down to create the two hours of footage seen. I think he did a fantastic job covering every aspect of the stage that night while still capturing the essence of the band's live performance (I have read some pretty poor reviews about the editing work, however). Every member is in top form (especially Bruce) as they command the stage, running from place to place, plowing through the classics. The stage set up is great, the lighting is good and the camera work is great. Overall, an awesome and entertaining viewing of the band's stellar live show.
Disc Two. The second disc starts off with the interviews. Each member is interviewed while showing what they do on their time away from touring, writing and recording. It gives a little insight into how heavy metal stars enjoy normal things just like anyone else. While some of it is somewhat comical, the rest of it is pretty informative as to how each member lives, how they got their start in music and a little bit about how they view on the band in the present. The second part is the 'A Day In The Life' portion, which shows the band's day up to and after the Rock In Rio performance. Press conferences, their arrival, preparing for their performance and the parties afterward. Entertaining and comical, at times. Not much else can be said. Third is the Photo Gallery of the band with commentary on each picture by Ross Halfin. Some cool pictures and some good information. The last two items on the disc are the credits and some website links.
January 19, 2001 marked perhaps the highest point in Iron Maiden's career. The essence of their live shows was put into overdrive that night as they performed for their biggest headlining crowd to date. That performance, all the power, energy, anguish, ability and excitement, can be found here on this DVD. I recommend this to any die-hard Maiden fans as well as anyone who has never seen the band perform live before. Anyone who wasn't satisfied with the Rock In Rio CD might be turned off by the music but the performance is sheer excellence. Definitely buy this.",1040256000,26,3656,4.591743119266055

Alas, there is a caveat:
The editing is schizophrenic.  Something like 38 cameras are used which isn't the problem, it's the fact they're all used within a minute of each other over and over again preventing the viewer from focusing on anything for more than a couple of seconds.
In this day of MTV editing,  Iron Maiden should be above this.  The haphazard editing, I believe, is supposed to enhance the energy and excitement of the show but it detracts from it because it's somewhat annoying hoping to watch a camera shot for more than 2 seconds.
Final note to band:  You don't need wild editing to show excitement, everybody at that concert only had one view, and they left exhausted from what I'm sure was the most intense concert they've ever seen.",1040169600,5,991,4.726744186046512

1712110,5,B0000667LK,"As much as I loved the CD version of ""Rock in Rio"", seeing its DVD counterpart increased my appreciation tenfold.  If you think Maiden are too old to rock...you are wrong.
The concert is energetic and electrifying.  When ""The Wicker Man"" first got started, I was a bit worried, because the way the camera angle kept shifting, I was afraid that would ruin it, but either they didn't do it very much throughout the whole thing, or I just didn't notice it after a while, but either way, it wasn't a problem.  The camera angles provide multilple views of each musician, so you can see how they create this incredible music. The guitarists were especially interesting to watch.  It's official, Janick Gers is awesome.  He's a better guitarist than Adrian, and almost as good as Dave, and he's definitely got the best stage presence of all of them (in fact, Adrian's kinda boring, odd man out I guess).  Nicko's energetic drumming is also interesting to watch, and then we have Bruce.  Wow.  Is this guy really 44 years old?  I'm less than half his age, and I'm not sure I have the energy to run around like he does. He barely stops moving throughout the whole thing!  Awesome stage presence, just a cool guy.
There are plenty of highlights to be found here, but a few moments do stick in my mind specifically.  ""The Clansman"" is an especially compelling live performance, complete with a cool acoustic bass intro, a stellar vocal performance, and you get to see Nicko and Bruce do goofy little dances. :)  Also, the part during ""The Evil That Men Do"", where Steve spars with Eddie is just hilarious, and it was cool to see what Bruce was talking about when he mentioned burning the virgins during ""Iron Maiden"" (it was a pyrotechnic thing).  But really, there's not a dull moment to be found here.
If you love Maiden, this is a definite must-have.  If you enjoyed the CD...you ain't heard nothing yet.

1712111,5,B0000667LK,"After having seen all the VHS  concerts, it's great that MAIDEN have the ""ROCK IN RIO"" DVD with all new material. The material is mostly new with some classics. The editing is a bit frenetic, but since Harry Harris ( Bomber ) had 18 Cameras, this is fairly understandable; Steve Harris is responsible for most of the Visual product that Maiden has produced, and after the number of tapes he has produced, I can understand why he might want to experiment. If you really are keen on ""focusing"" on the band, then use the DVD  freeze frame. My opinion is that the editing is great, and suits the fast paced work of the show. It really showcases the band as it currently is on tour. With 3 guitarists, 1 bassist, 1 drummer, and 1 singer, I don't See how Steve Harris could have done the edit any other way. For me, the editing is not a failure... in fact I liked the clear shots of the guitar technique Gers, Smith and Murray use. A Pleasure to have this DVD now. Highly Recommended.",1034985600,3,978,4.368131868131868
1712112,3,B0000667LK,"Man, this is one sweet looking and sounding DVD. The picture and sound are so crisp. There are a lot of nice shots of the band but there is one big issue which led me to giving this 3 stars instead of 5. Who ever did the video editing should be [fired]. He does not allow anything to be displayed for more than 3 seconds. It really bothered me and gave me a headache. Is that smell my armpit or the video editor? You decide.",1034726400,3,424,4.0
1712113,5,B0000667LK,"Okay... I want to add my $0.02 on Rock In Rio. Fully tainted by ""being a fan"".
First, it absolutely must be said: MAIDEN ROCKS!
Second, details... People commented on Steve Harris's video direction, on it being so jumpy it'll cause seizures (or something to that effect). After watching it in it's entirety, I must say it's NOT SO!
It is a bit ""busy"" at times... with one notable ""drumming on the editing board"" moment during ""Wrathchild"". Otherwise, I liked most of the video edit - usually it followed where the action was, and with 6 guys in the band, that's tough to keep up with.
But, even if you have simply have to turn off the video... GET IT FOR THE AUDIO ANYWAY!!! The performances by every member are the best I've witnessed. Bruce sang better than I've ever heard him live. Steve rocked. Janick rocked. Adrian, rocked. Dave and Nicko... well, I would have to say, ""rocked"" also. :)
Why, it's as if they KNEW they were being RECORDED! :)
More plusses: Easter Eggs (including ""Monkeys In Love""), interview snippets, photos.
Downside: Yes, there is a fault to this, and it's part of it's strength. It's the 5.1 audio.
Anyone reading up on RIR knows this disc was designed for 5.1 ONLY. On most players (including mine), the stereo downsample will cut a guitarist out completely (on mine, Janick). Find a friend with a 5.1 audio system, and you're good to go - I might just get me one. :)",1034467200,,1396,4.5436507936507935
1712114,3,B0000667LK,"...This concert sounds okay but the camera shots are too jumpy. I found myself comparing it to the After Death concert too much. I could not enjoy their new style. Every band changes over the years and I guess I cannot accept the new Maiden.
I keep hoping they will release After Death on DVD but until then I will settle for this one...
If you are a hardcore Maiden fan, buy it but do not expect the same concert you saw 17 years ago.",1032566400,2,435,4.129411764705883
1712115,5,B0000667LK,"FINALLY!  An official dvd release of the Best. Metal. Group. Ever.  Two tracks (DTS and standard 5.1) that both will annihilate your stereo system.  I prefer the power of the DTS track myself, but both are wonderfully mixed and clear as a bell.  The beautiful thing is that you can actually pick out all 3 guitar parts individually and clearly.  The extras are fun and give a brief glimpse into the personalities of these 6.  The easter eggs are mostly entertaining, especially the shadow puppet one.
While I very much enjoy the cd release of this concert, its the dvd that truly brings out the passion of the band.  Another benefit to the dvd is you get to see the group's quirky and amusing personalities at work, be it goofy interaction with one another or Nicko's Riverdance during the intro of Clansman.  A must-own for any fan, and a must-see for anyone who loves live music.  But be warned...your speakers will never be the same after this.",1032048000,,947,4.622754491017964
1712126,4,B0000667LK,"It has almost become a trend. Ever since the age of modernization has dawned on us, having 20 cameras per live concert is almost inevitable. As much as I enjoy the 20 different camera angles, one cannot stand it switching between them every 2 seconds ! Review all tapes of concerts of old, e.g. Raising Hell by Iron Maiden and you'll see what I mean. The camera knows where to stay, when to stay, when needed. Minus the direction, this DVD comes off pretty darn exciting !
Where should I start ? Oh yes, the Wickerman ! very few artist have the manhood to begin a show with songs from their new album. Only Iron Maiden (and Ozzy) have I seen do that ! Things are frantic, guitars are screaming, bass is thumping, drums are banging. Bruce Dickinson sounds almost as if he was recording Number of the Beast all over again. The glamour, the fortune, then pain, all included in this very tight, energetic performance. How does one make room for 3 guitarist ? who plays what solo ? Watch this to find out ! It's hard to keep 3 lead guitarist happy, but Maiden has found a way to split the workload evenly so that all 3 are cheerily playing their parts. The set list is awesome ! No complaints about that.
  The second disc is basically a bunch of spontaneous interviews with the band members on their day off. It is not a bad account of what they do, and it is refreshing to see Maiden as ""normal"" folk. The dvd further contains a photo gallery with commentary for those die-hard Maiden fans who don't mind flipping through one-by-one.
  In short, a handy DVD to have around, but hard to watch 2 hours all over again. You would also need Surround Sound, if not Janick Gers' guitar will be missing for sure, leaving empty gaps during solos and intros. This would have been five stars if not for the direction. The second disc also does not really seem like a necessity, but like I said, it is a refreshing look at Maiden. Unfortunately, that second disc does bump the price up a little. However, all-in-all, superb performance by the band, showing that they still got it after 30 years of heavy metal. Maiden has truly set a mark for the rest to follow. Let us hope Motley Crue do no try to follow that though...",1031702400,6,2206,4.3995098039215685
1712127,5,B0000667LK,"I love the camera and editing work on this DVD.  It is top notch.  Headaches?  I don't think so.  It is a blast to watch.  The sound quality could not be better.  True, in regular stereo mode if you do not have your DVD player set up correctly the volume will rise and fall but that is because the disc is meant to be played on 5.1 systems or something.  This happened to me at first but I now have my DVD player set up correctly and it sounds phenomenal.  One of my favorite concert DVDs.  I love the triple guitar attack.  The duel solo from Adrian and Janick in The Trooper is very cool.  I can't wait to get a 5.1 system and listen to this thing the way it was meant to be heard!",1031702400,2,683,3.948529411764706
1712128,3,B0000667LK,"I sure was expecting something a lot better than this. Like most reviews say, too many agles changes too fast. It's like that throughout the DVD. Even during the intro. The guys themselves are in top form and the performance is great. They've aged a lot since Maiden England, but the energy is still there. It's just the camera work that really ruins this DVD. Sometimes there's slight problems with the sound quality, but there's not enough of that to ruin the DVD as far as sound quality goes. To me, that gives it a more raw sound which I like. This DVD should be for absolutely true Maiden fans only. Otherwise I'd wait until they release Live After Death and Maiden England on DVD. (which they better do!) But stay away from Raising Hell.",1031529600,3,743,4.511111111111111
1712129,1,B0000667LK,"The concert was fantastic, the song selection was very good. The editting of the video is terrible.  Iron Maiden or the producers should have hired a pro to do the editing.  I agree with Chris Glenn 100 percent. This kind of switching angles back and forth is very distracting. I watched a little over half the show with the hopes that I could find a rhythm to the editing but no such luck. I finally had to turn it off because it was to hard to follow. As for sound, the fact that they did not give uyou the choice of 2 channel sound is reason alone not to buy this disc set. The fluctuation in sound levels are very apparent. I have yet to hear a live concert recording(heavy hitter rock/roll) which sounds better in 5.1 digital than in 2 channel stereo.
I also purchased the Judas Priest-Live in London. If you only could buy one of these DVDs-Iron Maiden or Judas Priest-select the Priest, you will not be disappointed.",1031184000,7,923,4.391812865497076
1712130,3,B0000667LK,"I have seen Maiden 3 times and I think that they are one of the best bands ever.  Rock in Rio is a decent DVD, but it is missing something that I can not put my finger on.  I think that the selection of songs is what is lacking from this DVD.  Its cool that they played quite a number off their most recent release, but the older tracks could and should have been choosen differently.  The older tracks are good, but I would have choose different ones, ones that have not been played to death on their previous live recordings.  That is why I gave it three stars.  Production is very good, camera moves to much around though.  It is worth adding to a collection.",1030752000,3,662,4.2063492063492065
1712131,4,B0000667LK,"This is without question the best live show Iron Maiden has done since ""Live After Death"" was released in 1985. The only draw back for me was the song list. I wanted more classic and less recent. It has both, but the new songs like ""Bloodbrothers"", and ""The Ghost Of Navigators"" didn't need to be here IMO.....
To be quite honest, I've never seen Iron Maiden play tighter than this. B. Dickinson sounded great, the trio of guitars sounds much better live as well IMO. The stage is awesome as usual, and the crowd is one of the largest I've ever seen....
The quality of this DVD is top shelf, as is the sound and camera work. I was very happy after seeing this for the first time. Actually, as much as I hate to say it, I was expecting a bunch of old geezers struggling to stay on top of their form. What I witnessed, kicked me in the teeth!!!...Maiden has lost nothing!
This will certainly go down as one of the best live Heavy Metal performances you can buy on DVD today. Maiden is in top form here, and they've proven that they are the true ""Gods Of Heavy Metal"".....
""Rock In Rio"" = 4 1/2 stars....""Live After Death"" = 5.

1712133,5,B0000667LK,"I have been a loyal Maiden fan since 1984, I've been there through there good and bad times. I must say BNW is a return to their former glory i.e. Powerslave/SeventhSon, on different level of course, when you take into account the amount of competative Nu-metal band of the day. I would sure as hell like to see some band attract 250,000 peeps to a show after 20+ years in business, not gonna happen. That just goes to show how Iron (Mr. Harris) Maiden has stuck to his guns and has become a successful business man, for what he believes in (Maiden Music and the fans) of course, not the flavour of the day ... and the commercial agenda of MTV.
Anyway onto to the DVD, if you don't have home theater system go out and buy one right now, you will thank your soul for the rest of your life, the sound mix on this DVD is awesome, all i can tell you, if close my eyes, i can almost feel the people around me, the bass and bassdrum slamming into my chest, it feels like i'm at the show literaly, to Mr. Kevin Shirley u r the eminence of audio engineering...You can genuinly tell that there are no over dubs of any sort. Everything sounds like it was recored directly from the amps/pa to the disc in true raw form the way a live band should sound. It even captures, the chord blunders in some of the songs that the guys made and you can tell who screwed up, amazing...
There is a slight audio sync to picture problem on the DTS track toward the end of the disc though, barely noticeable, i think you'll only notice if your a musician.",1030492800,,1528,4.2184300341296925
1712134,5,B0000667LK,"I was skeptical getting this DVD bacause I just wasn't impressed with their last 4 albums, especially 'X Factor' and 'Virtual XI'. But, since it's Maiden... I had to buy it (after all, I own every CD/Import/VHS/DVD they have). You see... I grew up on Maiden, way back when 'Peice of Mind' was released in '83. I've seen them on every tour since 'Somewhere in Time' and each time, they were great live. They're simply a bunch of guys that care about their music and their fans and nothing more.
In terms of quality: Steve did a phenominal job on editing and sound. It couldn't have been better, especially the surround sound! The picture quality is superb. You see every band member equally, even some great shots of Dave's, Adrian's, and Jannick's solos. Bruce gives an amazing performace as well. And all the extra footage is great too.
In terms of song selection: That's were I'm dissapointed. As a die hard Maiden fan, I love the old stuff... everything from their first album to 'Fear...'. Although the newer stuff is not bad, I just don't care for it much.
Nonetheless, IT IS a great DVD. It shows the guys are still having fun performing live and providing their fans with great music. Unfortunately, there aren't enough bands out there that can deliver like Iron Maiden can. They will always be a part of my life as well as heavy metal history. I just hope they will continue for many years to come.",1030320000,4,1406,4.583333333333333
1712135,5,B0000667LK,"I enjoyed the ""Rock In Rio"" double live album, and I was equally excited that this DVD was coming.  I bought it (15 bucks at Best Buy for a Double-DVD was a BARGAIN) and enjoyed practically every minute of it.  The sound and visual quality was nothing less than superb.  Some of the songs were even better than the original recordings, such as ""Hallowed Be Thy Name,"" ""Fear of the Dark,"" ""Brave New World,"" among others.  The only thing I miss about this DVD and the album is that they didn't redo any song from the Somewhere in Time album... oh well.  Maybe they'll do more in the future.
