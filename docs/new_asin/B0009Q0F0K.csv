Okay,the picture and sound quality is not the greatest in the world,but this film is quite a rare find,so thats fine!!! It's a early Burt Reynolds performance and there's fine acting from James Best,Don Dubbins and Inger Stevens also!!! A obscure 70's gem!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!!

2311527,3,B0009Q0F0K,"I would normally rate this movie a 4 or 5, but the 3 rating reflects the disappointing quality of the DVD release. There have been other ""Made For TV"" movies such as ""Duel"" released on DVD with great quality. This release looks like it was transferred to DVD from an old film taped off a TV set. I purchased a VHS copy of this film some years ago and the quality was also very poor. So I was ecstatic to see it come to DVD with the promise of digital restoration. However, the end result is same poor quality only on DVD. Anyway, if your a fan of Burt Reynolds or Inger Stevens, I recommend adding this to your collection. Hopefully, this can be re-released in the future with better quality standards.",1173484800,12,702,4.325757575757576
2311528,4,B0009Q0F0K,"Shortly after his half-breed character's run on Gunsmoke, Burt Reynolds was the right actor at the right time. America was obsessed with a romantic reassessment of Native Americans and Hollywood (and the Hippie Culture) was fully embracing the White man's burden of guilt. Reynolds claimed Irish-Italian-Seminole roots and his features were an asset over most obviously white actors for portraying a believable Indian.

Run, Simon, Run is one of several high-caliber ""Movies of the Week"" put out in the late Sixties and early Seventies for television. This one was a particular favorite of mine and it was great to finally get to see it again. It's a good showcase for Burt Reynolds acting before he became a more comedic actor. It is also a sad display of Inger Stevens since it is her last performance before committing suicide. The style and music is definitely a product of its time (The Orphanage sings what I suppose is the theme for Simon) yet for those of us coming of age in that time, it holds up well and stirs fond memories.",1128988800,5,1036,4.787709497206704
2311529,4,B0009Q0F0K,"Run Simon Run is a forgotten gem of a movie that will appeal to all lovers of early 1970's movies dealing with issues of Native Americans in a sympathetic manner. So if you liked movies like Soldier Blue, Born Losers, Billy Jack, Little Big Man and the like, then Run Simon Run needs to be in your collection. Burt Reynolds plays a Papago Indian who, wrongfully convicted for murder, returns to his corrupt, racist town to track down who really murdered his brother. On every level of expectation, this movie delivers with a great, authentic sense of locale and tense, frustrating and satisfying moments. It's somewhat amazing to think how this great film has been allowed to lapse in our collective memory. For Burt Reynolds or Deliverance fans, this movie will also deliver in that it showcases Burt in an earlier intense and thoughtful role - reaching the height of his powers before he began to blow it all away in self-parody in the late-1970s. If you love movies along the lines of Macon County Line, First Blood, Walking Tall..., this one's for you as well. Those who remember it have fond memories of an exciting and progressive time in pop culture. Those who don't know it will be pleasantly surprised.",974073600,24,1211,4.7440758293838865
