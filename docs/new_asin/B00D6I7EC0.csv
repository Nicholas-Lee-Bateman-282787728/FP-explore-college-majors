5775656,5,B00D6I7EC0,"Great Christmas story, wonderful snapshot of a wonderful organization who helps throughout the year!  Love the excitement and impact the Army has on the characters.

5775658,4,B00D6I7EC0,Silver Bells makes you think that this is what Christmas should be all about.  Helping others ... forgetting yourself and living the Christian faith makes this film worthwhile.,1384300800,13,176,5.285714285714286

5775671,4,B00D6I7EC0,Good little different Christmas movie.,1454198400,,38,6.8
5775672,4,B00D6I7EC0,"Great movie but this guys punishment and subsequent humiliation was a little excessive.  He didn't even really intend to hit and injure the ref, it was completely an accident, but this wasn't mentioned or taken into consideration. At least he became a better person because of it in the end.

I didn't quite know what to expect going into this movie but was pleasantly surprised. This movie can easily become a new holiday favorite for a lot of people.

The scene where Bruce apologizes to the basketball team appears to be slightly out of order. He refers to the incident with the ref as having occurred just the other day. But the movie spans from Thanksgiving-Christmas and  a lot happens between the time of the incident and Bruce's apology its much more than a few days.",1449273600,,775,4.676470588235294

5775685,3,B00D6I7EC0,"I live in Michigan and trust me when I tell you that in the middle of winter, crickets DO NOT chirp at night under the snow! It really take away from the scenes and the movie- I can't believe why anyone would add crickets in for winter scenes.",1419120000,,243,4.083333333333333
5775686,5,B00D6I7EC0,Really good movie. Well made. Plot twists I didn't expect. I shed a few tears. And NOT afraid to tell the REAL story of Christmas.  Great family movie even the guys can appreciate and not cringe through.,1418688000,2,203,4.486486486486487
5775687,3,B00D6I7EC0,"I can't believe how utterly stupid the director of this movie has to be.  One scene where the husband pulls into the driveway of his home and his wife is putting up Christmas decorations, the landscape is covered with snow and both people are in winter clothing, but, get this --  there are numerous cricket sounds in the background, apparently to suggest that it is nighttime.  Crickets?  In the middle of the winter?  The cricket sounds are used in every outdoor night scene.  Nice story, but that thing with the crickets ruined the whole atmosphere as serious scenes are turned into a joke.",1417910400,,593,4.70873786407767

5775692,5,B00D6I7EC0,This is a movie I will watch at least once a week just to remind me that when we spread the love of JESUS we have no idea how far it will reach!

5775704,2,B00D6I7EC0,Slow moving not really what I thought it would be. Nice storyline but took too much time for story to decelop,1390176000,,109,4.238095238095238
5775705,2,B00D6I7EC0,This was a decent film about not being over competitive.  I liked seeing Kenton Duty in this movie.  I think he's going to be a good career actor.  But this film was also basically a big ad for Salvation Army.,1389830400,,209,4.175
5775706,5,B00D6I7EC0,I love this movie and when I saw it on television I knew I would purchase it.  Over the holidays I guess I played it ten times at least.  This is a keeper and good for viewing any time of the year.  Highly recommend this movie.,1389657600,,227,3.891304347826087

Funny at times, sad and happy too. This movie has a little of everything.",1389052800,2,287,4.76
5775710,3,B00D6I7EC0,"When I ordered this, I thought it was the Silver Bells movie starring Anne Heche. This one is OK, but I love the other one, which I now have, also. I'll probably give this one away or try to sell it.",1389052800,,199,3.8780487804878048

5775714,5,B00D6I7EC0,"Watched with the wife.... we loved it.  Watched with a big group of folks...they loved it.  Laughs all through the thing.  NO drowning in Christian stuff...just a light sprinkling.  (I'd have preferred a tad bit more, but most modern Christian movies don't like to shout out about salvation or eternity these days....people might get offended or put-off).  The acting was low-key, even the hero's.  Very professionally done.  NO armatures allowed in this flick!  Very enjoyable and easy to view!!",1388275200,7,496,5.189873417721519

5775718,4,B00D6I7EC0,"I would recommend this movie. It was a good story, but in my opinion Boxleiter  was a little abnoxious, like Everyone Loves Raymond.  I thought the son was great as well as the wife.",1386720000,,182,4.323529411764706
5775719,5,B00D6I7EC0,"This is an enjoyable, fun film to watch.  It's not a religious film, but--as the Salvation Army's mission is to preach the gospel and to help those in need--the theme of giving is weaved into the story.  The main character, a self-centered sports anchor for a local news station, is sentenced to community service as a Salvation Army bell ringer for inadvertently assaulting a referee during his son's basketball game.  After a series of personal let-downs, the man--through his involvement with the ""Army""--learns the true meaning of Christmas and the gifts that come with helping others.  This is a nice little film that stands out from the rest of this season's holiday offerings that are all about shopping, over-indulgence and shameless cross-promotion (think Hallmark ornaments and Werthers candies).",1386633600,6,806,5.2734375
5775720,1,B00D6I7EC0,"I thought it to be a romantic comedy, but it turned out of be more of a religious film under the guise of being a romantic comedy.  Was very disappointed.  Couldn't even watch the entire film.  Very sorry I wasted my money in buying it.",1386374400,,236,4.2
