I enjoyed the movie very much.  A good watch.",1401062400,,110,4.238095238095238
5324666,5,B009FLZL04,It's a story that will hold your interest from beginning to end. Nothing sugar coated here. An honest documentary about hard men. Men who saved the world.,1394668800,,154,4.7407407407407405
5324667,5,B009FLZL04,"If asked to choose a single documentary of this genre, this would have to be considered one of the very best! Young men fortunate to have grown old and still with their story to be told. Original footage and interviews add a very personal dimension. Well presented and narrated, this is one you don't want to miss. Somehow this was overlooked in my 'Watch List,' just one of those things that goes missing when you want to make sure you don't miss anything. A student of WWII history, I was already familiar with 'Maggie' and had read his book. If you are interested in WWII and want a personal account, including 'Operation Market Garden' and the 'Battle of the Bulge,' this is one that you don't want to miss. Recommended as one of the best available in this genre!",1393286400,,767,4.525179856115108
5324668,4,B009FLZL04,True story of a man that was a part of a giant piece of history. A soldier's perspective of the war.,1392940800,,100,3.8095238095238093
5324669,5,B009FLZL04,Excellent movie on a documentary about a leader of military men that lead by example!! He is a man of character and valor I would fight w/to hell and back!!,1389657600,,156,4.233333333333333
5324670,5,B009FLZL04,"It was interesting for me to see James Megellas go back to the battle sites he participated in during WWII.  He's a humble guy and described losing friends.  This made me appreciate how all over the world, there are so many sites of battles where young people died and forgotten.",1385942400,2,279,4.56
5324671,5,B009FLZL04,"I thought the documentary was very well done. Moreso than other memoirs I have read, Maggie's book and his words in the documentary genuinely reflect the brutality of war and thought processes that he and others (like my uncle who was also in H Company, 504) experienced. The theme of leadership throughout the film was loud and strong. Leading from the front and developing trust among those whom you lead is critical. Maggie deserves a Medal of Honor for his actions in the Battle of the Bulge. It was tastefully mentioned by several of the paratroopers in the film. I have visited Nijmegen two times for Operation Market Garden anniversary events. The Dutch people are genuinely grateful and warm as depicted in the film. My only regret was that this film was not made 10 years ago when more of the veterans who served with Maggie were still alive. One of the veterans prominent in the film, Bill Hannigan, was one of the twenty-five 504 paratroopers that volunteered as a pathfinders for D-Day. He may be the only one still alive.",1384560000,11,1034,4.718232044198895
5324672,5,B009FLZL04,"This is an inspiring, well made story about a gritty World War Two combat hero.  The 94 year old returns to the scene and recalls the battles in a no holds barred manner",1381017600,,169,4.121212121212121

5324676,5,B009FLZL04,"Very cool to see someone my Grand Uncle Jack Desideri served with. ! Jack was one of the original Devils in Baggy Pants too. He was awarded the Silver Star for his action in combat. Jan 25th 1944. They are all heroes to me !

I hope someone on here can give information to me or photos about my Uncle Jack.",1431388800,,306,4.016393442622951
5324677,5,B009FLZL04,The best WWII documentary of the 82nd Airborne in Europe.  Great interviews with the men who fought the battles.  Maggie was a true war hero.,1426377600,,141,4.6
5324678,3,B009FLZL04,"Good story, great hero.",1424822400,,23,5.0
5324679,4,B009FLZL04,"Surprisingly captivating despite the straight forwardly, no frills,  factual portrayal of subject matter. A documentary made up of some archival still photos and few moments of archival moving pictures with constant voice offer or face-on interviews. Remembrances of the lethal events are told by men who survived to recall their battle experiences. So the film has an eye witness perspective. Anyone interested in WWII history should watch this documentary. As well, anyone entertained by anything about WWII ought to watch this film.",1421193600,,535,5.524390243902439

Very inspirational.",1415404800,,146,4.88
5324683,5,B009FLZL04,Still in awe of the man and men portrayed in this documentary. I feel viewing this should be madnatory in all the academies to show the future leaders what a great and humble leader is.,1414800000,,185,4.314285714285714

5324689,4,B009FLZL04,"I really enjoyed this documentary. This guy was the real deal. He volunteered for combat duty , and made it through, when many did not. He is humble about his service as many of that generation were. His men really respected him.  I believe they said he was in his 90s at the time of the production. Well preserved for sure.",1409529600,,324,4.311475409836065

5324691,4,B009FLZL04,"To a degree, like a single episode of Band of Brothers but he is actually discussing his war. ""Maggie"" provides provides more specifics on the attitude needed to fight and survive in combat. This also provides  a little background on fighting in Italy and Market Garden. Worth the 45 minutes or so of viewing time, especially with Amazon prime.",1405814400,,344,4.830508474576271
5324692,4,B009FLZL04,"very interesting story, as a world war 2 watcher, I had never heard of this man, wonderful to research that he is still alive today, after living through a story like that. Their argument for a Congressional Medal of Honor  is well stated.",1402444800,,239,4.558139534883721
8541015,4,B009FLZL04,"Very good dvd production. For a WW2 Hero. His account of the battles of the European campaign were very good. As an ex-army paratrooper, myself, this is well worth it. Thanks. I met LtC Maggella on a Showboat Cruise in Branson in 2016 & 2017, he was 101 & 102 and still doing well.",1515196800,,281,4.222222222222222
8541016,5,B009FLZL04,"Having read the book by ""Maggie"" Megellas, I was very glad to find this documentary.
My only complaint is that the veterans who were being interviewed were not identified by their names......after reading the book, I felt like I had gotten to know some of those men and would like to have known who they were.
Any chance the producers could get that information put in?",1484611200,,369,4.606060606060606

8541020,5,B009FLZL04,"Incredible story of heroism, loyalty, and a sense of protection of those Maggie led.  Told by men of his unit and by Maggie himself.  This man should have been awarded the Medal of Honor a long time ago.",1464048000,,203,4.315789473684211
8541021,5,B009FLZL04,"It brought home the reality of what war is like and how indebted we are for the Liberty we have for such people, even tho many today work to destroy the very ideals that this man fought so bravely for.  EXCELLENT MOVIE!",1463788800,,219,4.214285714285714
