8297311,5,B001EAWMOM,"As always with D'Amato you don't know what to expect and I didn't hope for anything--boy, was I wrong. This flick is really low budget, simple and predictable but I watched it numerous times and remember it as excellent. Yes, only two chicks in all movie and one kinda on low side but everyone acting properly, everything rolling, gigs, skin and as a result D'Amato is my favored along with Tinto Brass.",1398297600,2,403,4.611111111111111
8297312,5,B001EAWMOM,"I bought this on Amazon after watching it on Netflix first.  Let's just say it immediately made me want to own it, but you may want to do the same (try before you buy) just in case this sort of movie or type of women aren't to your taste.  I'm also thinking my original shorter review isn't good enough to convey just how hot Erika Savastani is (let alone the other beautiful women that appear here).  I hope some additional detail will help.

This is what it is in terms of plot, etc.  How sexy you find it depends on what you were expecting - this is definitely more on the soft side, but with that in mind some scenes are very hot and there's a lot of nice self-love from all three women (which we don't quite see graphically but the trade off is the acting is more convincing).  I find it a little frustrating that they keep intercutting with the pervy young guy who's spying on the ladies as they do sexy things... but the ladies are worth it.  The scene that kills me the most is when Erika first is getting undressed in front of the mirror, and the camera is in the perfect place so you can see her from both sides - and the view is just glorious, with curvature that puts my jaw on the floor every single time.  But some of the most exciting footage is non-nude, such as the sheer nightgown Erika wears in a couple of scenes.  Stunning, I tell you!!",1297382400,8,1357,4.188461538461539
8297313,3,B001EAWMOM,"Wasn't real sure of this thing. As it turned out, it was an OK movie. The storyline could have been a bit deeper. As it was they took a fairly short story and stretched it out with a lot of filler. Beyond that, it is watchable although it was more of a 2 1/2 star effort in my opinion and not a complete waste as a lot turn out to be. Essentially this is a story about a possessive and sexually selfish husband, who cnnot or fails to satisfy his wife. There is only so much that can be done with this kind of plot I guess.",1237939200,4,522,3.8878504672897196
8297314,2,B001EAWMOM,"What would have been a great movie, but all the best love scenes don't get a chance to begin.
Too much editing. It should have had a PG-13 rating.
I am a collector of old classics. This is the worst I have ever seen.",1231200000,17,216,3.9318181818181817
