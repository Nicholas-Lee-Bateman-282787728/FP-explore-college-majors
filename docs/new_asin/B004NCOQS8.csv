8436595,5,B004NCOQS8,"These DVD's are a wonderful review of basic derivatives. I completed Calculus I last semester and needed a quick review of derivatives. It is/was especially helpful to see everything worked out step-by-step. These DVDs do not contain theory, so if you're looking for/need mathematical proofs, you're out of luck as far as these DVDs are concerned.
Problems start out simple and then build on that foundation to more and more complex examples. I would recommend these DVDs to anyone who needs some extra work on the ""how to"" of derivatives.",1377302400,,539,5.0
8436596,5,B004NCOQS8,"The price of these DVD's are a bit on the high end, but it is well worth it. This professor tries his best to teach you the meat and potatoes of Introductory Calculus. The only problem with these dvd's is that they need to be accompanied by some sort of workbook in order to reinforce the concepts he is trying to teach you. He even mentions this during the tutorials, telling us to pause and do some problems on our own! I have yet to find the right book for the job. Don't bother with the Calculus for Dummies workbook, it's a jumbled mess. I'm looking for a workbook that gradually teaches you each concept through various problems ranging from easy to difficult. If any of you find it, please let me know. I'm trying so hard to CLEP out of Calculus.",1371859200,,753,4.309859154929577
8436597,5,B004NCOQS8,"This set saved my life during Calc. I really needed some extra help and practice, and I ended up getting an A!",1370476800,,110,4.045454545454546
8436598,5,B004NCOQS8,"The DVDTutorDVD.com DVD set ""Calculus 1: Extra Practice with Derivatives"" presented an excellent adjunct to the Calculus series. The sections regarding ""Implicit Differentiation"" and ""Related Rates"" are worth the price of the set in of themselves. Having taken Calculus back in the stone age and again at the local community college after retiring from the military I always found those topics problematic....once I worked thru the examples with Jason I found myself asking ""What was so hard about those problems?"" Along with another reviewer's comment I look forward to a similar ""Extra Practice"" with the integral part of calculus!

8436599,5,B004NCOQS8,"This is an excellent tutorial for those of us who want to get the techniques of differentiation down to a routine.  Notice I said techniques.  So if you are a math major be aware that there is no theory here.  There are no proofs of theorems as to WHY the techniques work.  That, as stated by the instructor, is NOT the goal of this set.  For those desiring proofs etc I recommend ""Calculus: The Classic Edition"" by Earl W. Swokowski.

I found this series to be superb for learning AND doing the various methods of differentiation.  The best way I found to really get things down was to view a section, say on the Chain Rule, then use REI's 'Calculus Problem Solver' text to do the exercises.  I also found that actually plotting the original function AND the first and second derivatives alongside using GeoGebra made the most sense for me.  This way I actually got to SEE how powerful the idea of differentiation was.

My math skills are meager at best and Jason's teaching methodology works for me.  No steps are skipped.  Everything is spelled out, step by step until by the end of the series you will know the mechanics of differentiation.

For the price this set is a bargain.  I only wish I had this crutch during my halcyon days in grad school to use as a refresher.  But; no matter, at least now I get the pleasure of doing this just for the fun of it.  Very highly recommended.",1323993600,2,1387,4.4229249011857705
8436600,5,B004NCOQS8,"I have many of Jason Gibson's DVD courses and I have found them all to be quite helpful, especially for an autodidact such as myself. The courses are expertly arranged, his explanations straightforward and clear, the courses expertly arranged, and the problems he uses progress from the basic to the more complicated in order to give you a solid grounding experience with the material. This DVD in particular, Calculus 1: Extra Practice with Derivatives, is exactly what it says it is: 10 solid hours of instruction in derivatives. When I was finished with it, I proceeded to plow through the sections on derivatives in the two calculus coursebooks I am using and my command of the subject was miles ahead of where it was when I started. It really did give me a solid grounding in the topic! I found the two sections on implicit differentiation, and the three on related rates, to be especially helpful and really cleared the topics up for me. Now I am looking forward for a future release of a DVD devoted to extra practice with integrals!",1320796800,,1040,4.71978021978022
8436601,5,B004NCOQS8,"This is essentially an extension of Jason's Calculus 1 & 2 Tutor DVD set.  It covers just differentiation.  There are no integration problems on this set.  This will be especially helpful for those whose school splits differential calculus and integral calculus into two different courses.  It covers some differentiation techniques that Jason did not have time to go into in his original set like implicit differentiation and differentiation of exponential and logarithmic functions.  He also spends a lot of time on Related Rates, which in my opinion were (along with optimization problems) the most difficult part of Calculus I.  By the time you get through the related rates examples you will know how to do most of the problems you will come up against in your homework and almost anything that can realistically be asked on an exam.

He also has several additional examples using all the differentiation rules, from basic polynomial differentiation to the product, quotient and chain rules.  Even if you have purchased his original DVD set none of the example problems on this set are the same as on the other.  While some of the more basic problems on each set are similar, they are not exactly the same.  Also, you can use this set as a ""stand alone"" because while introducing each topic Jason does give the background needed to understand the material and does not just launch into examples presuming you have seen his original DVDs or have a baseline knowledge of the material.

I own many of Jason's DVDs and have used them to prepare for my upcoming classes, as study aids during the semester, and to prep for finals.  As I have said on almost every review I have written of his various DVDs these are and should be considered supplemental to class and doing homework problems.  He does not touch on every aspect of every topic you will be exposed to in class.  And, there are times where he does the problems in alternate ways to the way your book may show you.  The only way to know what your instructor is going to expect is to go to class.  If you know the material presented on the DVDs well, you know how to do anywhere from 75-85% of what you will likely see on your final.  It will depend on your teacher of course, and what he or she chooses to focus on.  I have used Jason's DVDs from intermediate algebra all the way to Calculus 3 (which I am taking this upcoming semester).  If you use the material in a smart way, not relying on the DVDs exclusively but as a compliment to lecture and homework, not everything from class will be a cakewalk but you will have no problem coming out of it with an excellent grade.

+++Update+++

Jason has also put out a companion set to this that covers integration, which is excellent.  I don't think it is on Amazon yet which is why I am noting it here.  Integration is probably the hardest part of calculus whether it is single variable integration which you get in Calculus II (or if you school combines derivative and integral calculus into one class Single variable calculus) or double and triple integration in Multivariable calculus.  The calculus I extra practice with integrals DVD (it is split into two sets) just deals with single variables but goes into the disk, washer and shell methods for finding volume using integration (which I hated) and really touches on all the integration techniques (especially integration by parts).  If you get those and use this, you can really learn most of what you need to know to get through first year calculus, and if your school requires you to take the gateway exam (usually  10 question exams that you have to take derivatives or integrals by hand without a calculator) to pass the class, it will make those a breeze.",1313193600,4,3727,4.660550458715596
