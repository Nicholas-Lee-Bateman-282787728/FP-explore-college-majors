Berlin is a city that is changing by the day so by the time a book is published
much of it is already out of date.

8382872,1,B002W6506E,"I'm from Transylvania and was pretty excited to see a DVD in English...however, this was really disappointing as you can tell it was done through the eyes of Magyars (transylvanan hungarians) which represent about 15% of Transylvanian population. The DVD is primarily focused on Magyar traditions,people and villages, which is accurate, however like I said they represent a tiny bit of what Transylvania truly is...I would not recommend the DVD as a reference for someone who would like to visit Transylvania...",1362960000,2,511,5.320987654320987
8382873,3,B002W6506E,"I was in Berlin a couple years ago and thought this video would serve as a good trip down memory lane.  After reading the only other review for this video, I had some doubts but decided to watch it anyway.  Unlike many other travel videos that have a charming host/hostess walking you through the featured local, this video consists of a continuous stream of short shots while a commentator describes what you are seeing.  Yes, the commentator does have an accent (we all do) but I did not find him at all difficult to understand.  The video covers a lot of ground in 60 minutes and is a good introduction to anyone considering a trip to Berlin.  Because of its lack of a host/hostess, it does tend to be a bit dry but is still worth watching.",1357862400,2,743,4.394160583941606
8382874,1,B002W6506E,"I really wanted to learn something about the attractions and history of Berlin but I couldn't make it past the first 10 minutes. The videography is second rate and actually left the impression that Berlin was a rather dreary, dull place. The commentator has a strange accent (not German) and the random images were not always relevant to the (boring) running commentary.",1314662400,2,370,4.983870967741935
8382875,1,B002W6506E,"This has the potential to be a useful pre-travel video, because it shows lots of daily life -- how people look on the street, what the train stations and trains look like, etc.

Unfortunately the video quality itself is fairly low, looking as if it were shot with a consumer grade camera, and when there are video effects (such as speeding up a train journey) they look jerky as if they were created in iMovie or worse.

The narration is just bewildering.  Speaking continuously for an hour, the narrator has a flat American accent but uses odd British words and pronounces Japanese names in ways that are not standard for Japanese or English.  I seriously thought the voice might be computer generated until I saw the end credits.  The text of the narration contains run on sentences and strange asides -- it sounds like an 8th grader's social studies report, heavily cribbed from guidebooks and travel brochures.

As if to prove that the whole is less than the sum of its parts, the narration and the video often seem to be out of sync with each other, so it's constantly hard to tell whether you're looking at the place described, someplace visible from the place described, or someplace else entirely.",1270080000,4,1205,4.714285714285714
