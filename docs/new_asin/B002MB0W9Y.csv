8373809,4,B002MB0W9Y,"Fans of jazz guitar will no doubt be aware of the New Morning series of DVD releases. This is a wonderful performance from Larry in a trio format, so he gets to stretch out. I've long been a fan of his playing, but since he's known as a premier L.A. session player, a lot of his work left me a little cold - a little too produced for my tastes. So this is a great setting for him! He's accompanied by his son on bass, who's an amazing musician in his own right. Definitely one to check out and enjoy!",1390262400,3,500,4.01
8373810,5,B002MB0W9Y,"Incredible musician.  You probably already know that if you are reading this.  Buy anything he plays on.  If you like him once, you'll like them all.",1386720000,,149,4.653846153846154
8373811,5,B002MB0W9Y,"Larry Carlton is my favorite jazz guitarist! I also love all those tunes he performed with Steely Dan some years ago. This performance is what other artists should aspire to achieve, nuff said!",1363305600,3,193,4.878787878787879
8373812,3,B002MB0W9Y,"I HAVE SEVERAL OF LARRY''S CD ALBUMS AND MY FAVORITE ONE IS ""DISCOVERY""  A LOT OF PEOPLE MAY LIKE THIS DVD BUT FOR ME MOST IMPROV JAZZ , I DON'T CARE FOR. THIS DVD JUST DIDN'T DO IT FOR ME. SORRY TO SAY BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN HIM PERFORM IN PHOENIX ARIZONA AND HAVE SEVERAL OF HIS ALBUMS THAT I ENJOY VERY MUCH.",1362873600,2,308,3.888888888888889
8373813,5,B002MB0W9Y,"This is a must buy DVD.  With the Trio you can hear everything being played.  Larry is tasteful, Travis is solid and Toss is an artist.  You won't be disappointed with this DVD.",1354233600,2,177,4.303030303030303
