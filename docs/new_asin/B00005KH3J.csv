7943304,4,B00005KH3J,"""Chocolate Passion"" is an interesting program which shows chefs making delicious desserts with chocolate. Some of the time ingredient measurements are given and at other times they are not. This makes reproducing the desserts at home a problem. My suggestion is that you just enjoy this visual feast and look up recipes online afterwards. It is intriguing to see all the tools chefs use to create their masterpieces. Things I would have never thought of. So this is in some ways very educational. You will learn tips, tricks and secrets of some of the world's best chefs.

7943305,4,B00005KH3J,"The cover photo of that luscious chocolate cake with chocolate ruffles and a chocolate band is just the beginning of what you will find within this treasure of a DVD. The master chefs of these pieces are mostly from the US (one actually being a transplanted Frenchman by the name of Jacque Torres; recognize him?)and with one recipe from the French master of chocolate, Robert Linxe of Le Maison du Chocolat in Paris. I thoroughly enjoyed both watching and creating these desserts, with some being a tad more detailed, though nonetheless, possible to create.

There are eight different ""chocolate passions"" within this disc. They are:

  Chocolate Terrine

  Creme Brulee

  White Chocolate Mousse Cake

  Meringue with Chocolate

  Chocolate and Drambuie Souffle

  Meringue with Chocolate

  Chocolate Ganache (our friend Robert Linxe)

  Chocolate Fontaine (our friend Jacque Torres)

  President Cake

I had purchased the VHS format many moons ago, when ""DVD"" just meant letters from the alphabet. I'm very glad that it is now available in the DVD format, which can withstand the constant playing and replaying that many of us ""chef wannabe's"" tend to do. I think you will be quite pleased with this small, but enjoyable, menu of dessert items.",1135814400,9,1248,5.130653266331659
