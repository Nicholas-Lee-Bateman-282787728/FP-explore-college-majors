8642569,5,B00DTX7ZFI,"Great to have if you want to understand Balanchine's style.
This is Part 2 in their series on Barre work.
Detailed explanation of each step, what it's for and how to execute it properly aka Balanchine style by Ms Suki Schorer with occasional filler by Ms Merrill Ashley.
You'll see their ""attack"" on movement and musical timing which explains why they were known as the world's fastest dancers.
There were stories about what Balanchine made them do or comments he made in their student days which was interesting.
I'm so glad I bought it!",1420070400,5,538,4.73404255319149
