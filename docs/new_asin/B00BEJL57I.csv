**** In Romanian with English Subtitles ****
2.5 hours

It's easy to forget that this Romanian story is set in the 21st Century, but it's actually inspired by the nonfiction book of Romanian journalist Tatiana Niculescu Bran about an incident which originally took place in a Moldavian convent in 2005.

This film follows the lives of two young girls who survive childhood and instances of abuse in a rural Romanian orphanage and form an intensely deep and intimate bond.  When they get older, Alina, who was always Voichita's protector, moves to Germany to establish a new life there and returns for her love in her mid 20s with dreams of taking her away.  Meanwhile, Voichita stays behind and becomes a nun.  She finds her new protector in faith and a new family among the nuns in this very rural, farm-based monastery.

Each of the girls wants to rescue the other.  Alina has adventurous dreams of running away together to work on a boat and maintaining a lesbian relationship.  Voichita, on the other hand, has established roots and abandoned all material things and love for anyone but God.  She takes her new path quite seriously.  She wishes Alina would join her in her new faith.  Alina, however, knows better and isn't having any of it.  She starts to act up.  She's lesbian-jealous of the other nuns, challenges their priest, and is pushy and demanding of her affections.  She wants what she wants to her own detriment.  The quiet little monastery literally turns to hell.

All of the emotional and sexual frustration seems to trigger other issues with Alina... who has a history of being very moody and hearing voices (although it's never specifically clear here, Alina is said to have had schizophrenia).  Her aggressive attitude and breakdown, combined with the carelessness of the hospital and doctors, ultimately creates hysteria at the monastery.  Clearly, Alina is possessed!!!  What follows is both tragic and farcical all at once.

Bizarre story.  Like revisiting medieval times.  Yet anyone who's lived in (rural) Central or Eastern Europe knows *exactly* how something like this can still happen in modern times, lol.  For me, the film was quite long and slow-moving and often feels like real time.  This really gave power to a number of scenes, but it became exhausting after awhile and I couldn't watch it all in one sitting.  The tone is mostly very serious.  Loved the cinematography.  And the winter setting- bleak!

There is some nudity.  No sex.  But there is a suggestion the girls have had a past physical relationship.

Doesn't look easy to find on Amazon right now, but it's on USA Netflix.",1445817600,3,2632,4.886877828054299
8567218,3,B00BEJL57I,"Way too long at 2.5 hours.  Good acting, but slow.  I should give it 4 stars, but this type of length negates my positive opinion.",1434412800,,130,4.16
8567219,4,B00BEJL57I,"I saw this movie at a film festival. It is beautifully photographed and the main characters are very good in their roles. The story is compelling and somewhat scary, and it's hard to believe that such a thing could happen in this day and age. However, if you do some research, you find that it is based on a true story of an exorcism at the Tanacu Monastery in Vaslui County, Romania. It's not the exorcism that's the story, so don't expect a haunted house story, but it's the use of an exorcism ritual for the wrong reasons since the young woman was not possessed in any way.",1406246400,,576,4.342592592592593
8567220,4,B00BEJL57I,"Nine Things about Beyond the Hills

1. This movie is based loosely on an actual incident that occurred at a Romanian Orthodox Catholic monastery in 2005.

2. Its a quiet but gutsy tragedy of faith vs. doubt, of hanging on to your convictions past all reasonable boundaries.

3. Its about a young woman named Alina. She goes to visit her secret ex-girlfriend, Voichita, who has joined a small convent of nuns that has partially broken away from the Orthodox Catholic Church.  Alina is hoping to reconnect with Voichita, and is severely disappointed that Voichita has dedicated her life to the convent.

4. Alina is slightly mentally ill, and during her stay at the convent, she begins to break down. The nuns and the priest, who have deliberately broken most ties with modern society (they don't even have electricity) aren't sure whats going on.

5. Full of religious superstition, they interpret Alinas anger, broken heart and subsequent breakdown to possession by Satan.

6. The momentum and sense of foreboding slowly builds, and the last 45 minutes is a pretty distressing account of an attempted exorcism of Alina.

7. The cinematography and sound of the film are very well done  you really feel like you are in a little isolated corner of the world, tucked away from modern life.

8. The movie reminds us that when superstition clashes with science, nobody wins.

9. Hollywood likes to remake European movies, but I don't think they have the guts to do this one. It would offend too many people.",1388361600,2,1501,4.847058823529411
8567221,5,B00BEJL57I,"Cristian Mugui's follow up to 4 Months,3 weeks and 2 Days is a stunning depiction of a real life tragedy that unfolded in a small religious community in Romania. It depicts exorcism in a way similar in theme to Requiem. This film indicts the society of which the monastery is a by-product. What is impressive is the slow unfolding of the drama,the lived-through rituals,daily routines,prayers and devotions. You feel trapped in the monastery,but the director is non-judgemental,presenting soberly the facts and information behind this frighteningly compelling real life mystery. There is an authoritarianism and hysteria in this closed order of nuns under the monastery's Father(Valeriu Andriu) and Mother. This film like its predecessor,one that revolves around two female friendsimprisoned by societal structures,is set in the 21st century but the monastery with no power or running water,could be in a medieval world.

Cristina Flutur and Cosmina Stratan play Alina and Voichita, two young women who have been brought up in an orphanage and formed an intense bond, partly through surviving abuse. Alina has returned from an attempt to get temporary work in Germany and, to her horror, discovers that Voichita has become a novice nun. This long movie is played out in a kind of real time, a mysterious secular passion play. Perhaps inevitably, Voichita is now conditioned to be a pious, submissive believer and Alina a tough, self-reliant non-believer. They are still in love,but the papers for Alina to take Voichita back to Germany were not in order, so their destinies are arbitrarily shifted another way: Alina comes to live in the orphanage, where Voichita infuriates her by talking about God all the time. Alina's disruptive, sexually threatening presence causes mayhem from almost the very beginning; she acts out her own frustration and self-sacrificially intuits Voichita's. One's idea of love(want) conflicts with the other's(need).The secular vs. the orthodox worlds.

On top of this is the idea Alina,in the throes of schizophrenia and self harm,needs both hospitalization and treatment, which the Father and the nuns take her rightly to,but the doctor sends her home with some medication. The hospital which, through pure bureaucratic weariness or inter-institutional complicity, releases a disturbed young woman into the nuns' care,giving them the advice to pray for her. Then the Father reads with her for 3 days and 2 nights,until the 'unclean one had departed'.She becomes disruptive again,seeing the Father as possessing(having sex with?) her lover. We see the evil path that good intentions take,the community's attempts to drive evil out of her(read sexuality/unbelief) through chaining her to a pallet-cross,stopping up her mouth and not giving her enough food and drink. Mugui uses long takes,does not move the camera or use music. We get a larger picture of an exhausted society,without ideas or education: a directionless, hopeless world. The secular agencies of the state are at least as culpable: no one wants to look after Alina, and this leaves only the priest and his exorcism, whose desperate and foolish decisions are routinely cast as understandable in the moment, if not defensible. Great cinema. The lead actresses seem natural,the ensemble superb,the direction unbelievable.",1380153600,3,3311,5.4147286821705425
8567222,4,B00BEJL57I,"Based on an actual incident in 2005 involving an exorcism ritual by a priest and four nuns of Romanian Orthodox Church (later indicted by Romanian authorities), a Romanian film ""Beyond the Hills"" (""Dupa dealuri"") follows the fate of two women Voichia (Cosmina Stratan) and Alina (Cristina Flutur), who had grown up in an orphanage together. Voichia and Alina (names slightly changed from the real-life counterparts) formed a strong bond of friendship there.

Alina, now 25 years old, wants to live with Voichita, hopefully in Germany, but Voichita has taken vows while they were separated, and now lives in a rural monastery as a nun. Alina also decides to stay there, but her behavior gets more and more erratic.

The 150-minute film is most remarkable for its realistic approach to the difficult subject matter. Director Cristian Mungiu keeps a measured pace throughout, following the details of the event in a matter-of-fact fashion, as in his critically acclaimed ""4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days."" The film's story, told with ambiguity, is not exactly re-enactment of the shocking event; it is rather examination of what drives humans towards such an act.

Perhaps this could have been done with much shorter running time. The deliberately-paced drama sometimes borders on pretentiousness, requiring great patience on the viewer's part, but Mungiu's latest effort is still an unforgettable experience.",1372550400,,1403,5.2825112107623315
8567223,5,B00BEJL57I,"At a train station, two young women, Voichita and Alina, reunite. They became close friends growing up in an orphanage, but Alina went abroad to work in Germany. At her return she weeps, and seems near the edge of a breakdown. Whatever happened has left her deeply distressed.

Voichita is a novice at a monastery, and invites Alina to stay awhile. Somewhat isolated, over the hill from a town, in a beautiful setting, with simple but elegant wooden buildings, without electricity or running water, the monastery seems a good place for healing a wounded soul. Which has long been a main purpose of spiritual institutions: to provide sanctuary, a place of solace for even the least among us.

Each woman seems very fragile, vulnerable, dependent, in sore need of someone, something, to lean on. A need exacerbated, almost certainly, by growing up without a family, and by the deficiencies of the orphanage. But who, now and then, doesn't have that need? For Voichita the monastic community and faith in God have become shelter. For Alina it seems the love for her friend is her refuge.

And that love becomes more hysterical. Perhaps Alina's recognition of the fierceness of that love and of the impossibility of its full affirmation and consummation is what finally pushes, pulls her, already teetering, over.

The hospital where she is taken is, to put it mildly, inadequate: ice-cold in its efficiency, bleak and heartless in its rationality. Their solution is to strap her down, pump her full of drugs; and when her fits of frenzy have subsided, but recognizing that their treatment is deficient, to send her back to the monastery. A foster family, introduced briefly, seems interested above all in money.

It gets worse. You've read the synopsis: Alina is deemed devil-possessed and is tortured by those who seem genuinely well-intentioned, kind, caring. Voichita's efforts on behalf of her friend are restrained by her own faith in and obedience to the institution and its leaders. And they seem surprised that their sincere and traditional efforts on behalf of God and Alina's soul should be harshly judged by outsiders.

This fragmentation, deficiency, dysfunction, hollowness, cruelty, obtuseness, etc. of institutions is, frankly, not limited to Romania. As if some essential binding, transforming item is missing. We're shown an extreme case, but it's from the far end, from the distance, that the generalness and familiarity of the outlines, the common shape of things, is often more clearly recognized. If the work, and it is so very well done here, keeps us both involved and detached, guides us to intense empathy and to contemplation of the wider picture.

Near the close is a scene with Voichita in the center of the frame. She's no longer wearing the clothes of a novice, but seems ready to embark on her own. She covers her head with a shawl and at that moment reminded me of portraits of the Madonna, especially Antonello da Messina's ""Palermo Annunciation"". As around her arguments swirl between police and nuns and priest, Voichita remains strangely unperturbed, calm, inward, as if accepting some recognition and change within.

Will this winter ever end? asks a cop in the van on the hectic road through bleak scenery and abrasive noise, as a truck splashes the windshield with dark sludge. Voichita sits in back, calm, waiting.",1371772800,5,3351,5.025225225225225
8567224,5,B00BEJL57I,"Released in Romania as ""Dupa dealuri"" this is a film from award winning director Christian Mungiu (`4 Months 3 Weeks and 2 Days') who also wrote this his latest outing. It tells the tale of Voichita and Alina who were best friends and apparently lovers at a state run orphanage. Alina has since gone to Germany for work and Voichita has discovered God and is now part of a local monastery. Alina returns to get her friend to join her and when they first meet it is all hugs and smiles.

It soon becomes apparent that Voichita has `moved on' as they say in terms of her feelings and has very much taken to heart her frugal existence in this outpost of Christian Orthodoxy. She live under the tutelage of Papa the priest who is kindly but firm and single mindedly orthodox, having produced a `sin guide' to help believers repent and it contains 464 sins, just to point you in the right direction. The other nuns are led by `Mother Superior' who cares for them a like a big mother hen. They live almost self sufficiently, with no electricity or running water in what looks like permanently cold conditions.

Soon Voichita starts to act more and more bizarrely as she seems to not be able to control her emotional outbursts. Despite their better judgement the nuns decide to help her but only because they feel she must be possessed by Satan himself. What then unfolds is as surprising as it is intriguing and turns into one very dark tale indeed.

This is just excellently made and acted and with a run time of 152 minutes is not for the fair weather viewer. This has led to accusations that the editor could have been more ruthless, but the story is such that it actually benefits from the extra screen time. I was hooked from very early on and the tension increases as the film unfolds and to say I was taken aback by it is an understatement. A film about a run down monastery and a couple of friends where one can lose her temper, is not the sort of synopsis to get your cinematic juices flowing, but this is a remarkable piece of film making that is a definite must see for all cinephiles and lovers of European cinema - highly recommended indeed.",1371513600,7,2148,4.446700507614213
