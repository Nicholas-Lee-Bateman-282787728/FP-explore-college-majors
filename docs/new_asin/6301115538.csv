317618,4,6301115538,"This lovely, sensitive interpretation of Dylan Thomas's poem is loyal to the original, but adds appropriate dialogue and a wonderland of touching pictures and characters. We have viewed it for the first time and are drawn into the film at every new frame.  It seems just right for all ages and makes one quite nostalgic for the days of our youth and those special times with family and friends when small towns and simple acts meant love was every where around us.  We recommend it.",1008633600,34,482,4.658823529411765
317619,5,6301115538,"This is a delightful story of a young boy in Wales.  It commences with the grandfather and his grandson at the home of the child's parents on a Christmas Eve.(The narrator and grandfather played by Denhom Elliott)  The child is given a beautiful snowglobe by his grandfather as a Christmas gift. The grandfather had received the snowglobe many, many years earlier when he was a boy and the child asks ""tell me about your life when you were young, Grandad""  --  so the story begins of Christmas's long gone by in Wales, Gt. Britain.  The story is simple, Dylan Thomas' words are beautiful, and this is a video that can be watched every holiday season by all the family.  I encourage everyone with young children to see it.  Life was much simpler in those days.  Hopefully it will never go out of print.",1008547200,46,801,4.5524475524475525
317620,4,6301115538,"This film version of Dylan Thomas's Christmas story is very good.  BUT...the audio recording read by the author is truly an aural pleasure!  Also, years ago I saw a TV production of this story by the National Theater for the Deaf that was beyond words.  Please contact them and encourage them to make this simple, stunning, and (in my opinion) superior presentation available.",1007510400,9,376,4.936507936507937
317621,4,6301115538,"This beginning to be one of my favorite Christmas movies. When I'm getting too overwhelmed with a modern Christmas - the consumerism, the excessiveness of it all - I can put this movie on and get swept back to a time when Christmas was simple and, as seen through a child's eyes, wonderous. This movie captures the book's charm and expands upon it. The one downside is that it is a bit slow-paced, however, that might make it the perfect movie to show the children Christmas Eve to make them sleepy.",1005955200,13,499,4.4945054945054945

For those who wonder, this IS the actual poem by Dylan Thomas.  What we see is a bringing-to-life of Thomas's words.  So, in answer to some of the reviews.....it can seem a little slow (to 2017 viewers who want space ships blown-up with 5 min of viewing).  Because this is a poem of memories ""I said some words to the close and holy darkness....."" that we have the privilege of being shared w/us.",1514332800,,533,4.3

317756,5,6301115538,"What a wonderful adaptation of the Dylan Thomas work.  I would keep this in the same small treasure box with the Richard Burton reading of Under Milkwood.

317757,5,6301115538,"This is a practically perfect family film for Christmas. Not only is it beautifully photographed as almost a Christmas Card come to life, but having been made for television, it's only 55 minutes long, so even the smaller children won't get restless. The tone and look of the picture are as warm and nostalgic as the story was written to be by Welsh poet Dylan Thomas. The small Welsh village where it was filmed is beautiful with its half-timbered houses, stone walls and plentiful snow. As the story says, ""It was always snowing at Christmas. December in my memory is as white as Lapland, though without the reindeer."" Though picturesque, the story is true to life with its mischievous boys throwing snowballs, uncles sleeping after large Christmas dinners and slightly tipsy aunts singing in the garden. The story is not so much a greatly plotted piece as a series of humorous vignettes and is unencumbered by any big message other than love and family life.

Mathonwy Reeves plays the boy, Thomas, through whose eyes everything and everyone is seen. But of equal importance is Denholm Elliott as Old Geraint, his grandfather who tells the story to him on Christmas Eve. This is not just a voice over but often we see Old Geraint narrating the story to cheer the boy who is sad to see it raining on Christmas Eve. He has the perfect look and voice for the role and they couldn't have picked a better actor for the part. The family members and village boys and townspeople are equally well-played and despite the short overall time, come off as real people.

The story was gradually developed by Dylan Thomas over a decade, growing as it evolved by adding new incidents. It began as part of a 15 minute talk on Welsh BBC titled Reminiscences of Childhood, then became Memories of Christmas for 1945's Welsh Children's Hour. In 1950 he added incidents from Conversations About Christmas, a magazine interview,to expand it to its final length. He then sold it to Harper's Bazaar who published it as ""A Child's Christmas In Wales"" for a broader audience. He followed that with an audio recording on Caedmon Records the same year. He  never knew it would become one of his most famous works, especially after it was published in book form in 1954 and 1955; he died in 1953. His memories however will live a long life.",1513987200,2,2315,4.711111111111111

Plus, there are new passages that seem to belong to the original story.  Images stay with me throughout the year:  The two young men, marching to the sea, pipes blazing, Mrs. Prothero and the Firemen, songs in the parlour, the love of a Welsh family for each other and for the season.

There is one thing I can say about ""A Child's Christmas in Wales,"" the book or the dvd, it is Christmas.  I have owned this film, first on VHS and now on DVD since 1999, and I watch it every year around Christmas.  You don't have to be from Wales, or from the UK to appreciate this film.  The film is as follows: a young boy is excited about Christmas being the next day.  His grandfather, Old Geraint, portrayed perfectly by Denholm Elliot, presents his grandson with a snowglobe, which he was given as a boy.  From there Old Geraint narrates what Christmas was like when he was a boy to his grandson.  Throughout the film the auidence journeys back and forth between the Christmas past and to the Christmas of the present.  Old Geraint not only tells the story of a Christmas from his boyhood, he relives it.  I don't want to give away too much of the film, I only urge people to buy this DVD for yourself and see the true meaning of Christmas.  ""A Child's Christmas in Wales"" is no about the want of material things, it is about the true meaning of Christmas: family, friends, the town you live in, and the joy of Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.  From authentic Welsh settings, to amazing Christmas choir music, to Denholm Elliot's wonderful performance ""A Child's Christmas in Wales"" is a Christmas gem meant to be enjoyed as a Christmas tradition, year after year.",1419811200,2,1468,4.481203007518797

318304,5,6301115538,"The visualization of Dylan Thomas's prose poem is perfect--the snow and the sea always about--whether boys are throwing snowballs at the cats on stone walls or singing in the parlor or the uncles sleeping off their Christmas dinner while the women (of course) are clearing up.  Denholm Elliot is perfect as the narrator of the poem--the poem is done as a bedtime story on Christmas Eve to this over-excited grandson. The story takes the boy (and us) into the Wales of his youth (""when I was your age, boy"") at the turn of the 20th century).

A Christmas tradition at our house: watch it every Christmas Eve. While my childhood Christmases were Welsh nor quite so long ago, they were about feast and family and church and small presents, in contrast to my children's Christmas memories (more about the presents) though we still do the feast and church and cookies and the decorations, it's still ""more about the presents.""",1409011200,2,921,4.786163522012578

I wish they could do a HD transfer,  but since I originally recorded it in VHS when PBS broadcast it, and then bought a VHS copy years later when it became available, and finally the DVD when I found out about it, I'm not complaining.",1389225600,,527,4.3232323232323235

The scenes of the grandfather's long ago Christmas were entertaining, humorous and conveyed the spirit of the holiday that we try to celebrate in a similar fashion.

Dylan Thomas' poem (which it is based on) was one of my grandfather's favorites, and when we saw the movie it quickly became part of our family's Christmas tradition. Unfortunately, we no longer have a DVD player, so it sure would be nice if this was released for streaming (although perhaps it's too obscure).

It's a beautiful story that completely captures the wonder of Christmas from a child's perspective. In my opinion, there is no better Christmas movie!",1388448000,3,613,4.5225225225225225

318438,5,6301115538,"Wonderfully narrated by Denholm Elliott, this beautiful film, ""A Child's Christmas in Wales,"" delves into the richness of Dylan Thomas' prose. Gorgeous cinematography of the coastal Welsh village and surrounding landscape vividly brings to life this classic Christmas tale. Dylan Thomas' 1955 poem, originally written for radio, is meant to be savored on a chill winter's night, and nostalgically portrays a simpler time, with a child's special imagination. On Christmas Eve, kindly grandfather ""Old Geraint"" (Elliott) shares stories about his Christmas past with his beloved grandson, Thomas (a perfectly elfin Mathonwy Reeves). The narrative poetry will pull you in: ""All the Christmases roll down toward the two-tongued sea, like a cold and headlong moon bundling down the sky that was our street; and they stop at the rim of the ice-edged, fish-freezing waves, and I plunge my hand in the snow and bring out whatever I can find. In goes my hand into that wool-white bell-tongued ball of holidays resting on the rim of the carol-singing sea...""

True to Thomas' story, the film delightfully describes a Useless Present: ""a celluloid&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/duck/dp/B00AQAZZ1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">duck</a>&nbsp;that made, when you pressed it, a most unducklike sound, a mewing moo that an ambitious cat might make who wished to be a cow..."" I have heard black and white cow-cats like that, who poke around the ground with their little faces, eating grass and moo-mewing.

This film can enrich and inspire your family traditions during the holidays. To further savor the story, we also have the book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Child-s-Christmas-in-Wales/dp/0763666955/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Child's Christmas in Wales</a>.

318483,5,6301115538,"Just ordered this classic to replace our well-loved, worn-out VHS version.  Our boys grew up with A Childs Christmas in Wales as an annual tradition, played often during tree-trimming and always on Christmas Eve, with angel chimes burning and swirling around.  Our traditional Christmas Eve gifts were snow globes, and each boy (now young men) have impressive collections.

I didn't realize until watching this movie how many of my familys other Christmas traditions came from our Welsh background:  the crackers/silly paper crowns, the useful presents, the lead soldiers, the burning of the plum pudding, etc.  Now we are blessed that our eldest and his wife have invited us to share their 14-month-old twins first screening this year, and that our youngest wants to share his new wifes first screening with us.

For many, this film is slow...some of our extended family roll their eyes when we bring it up every year.  But for those who feel a kindred spirit in tradition, please let it grow on you.  Dylan Thomas has a magical way with words and is quoted beautifully by Denholm Elliot (who played Coleman in another favorite, Trading Places.)  The slow pace of the film reminds me of Mr. Rogers approach to life...savor it.  The music is traditional, lovely, and will stir your soul.  Savor and enjoy!",1386547200,,1305,4.940366972477064

It brings back our feelings of Christmas as children, no matter when or where we grew up. The magic of Christmas, mostly resting on family love, fun and tradition, is captured by Thomas's words and Elliot's narrating. I would wish that every family sit down together and drink in this sweet hour of Christmas.

Like the ""old guy"" muppet on Sesame Street once said: ""They don't make ice cream cones like they used to....and they never did.""
I first saw ""A Child's Christmas in Wales"" when it first aired on PBS in the eighties. I had previously read the Dylan Thomas story and, in the intervening 30 plus years a rereading, out-loud, to the gathered family became a Christmas tradition. So much so that I could recite portions by heart.
So I ordered this DVD, KNOWING that it couldn't be as good as I remembered.
I was wrong.
This is a charming dialogue between a grandson and grandpa as the latter recalls Christmastime in turn-of-the-century Wales. The fact that it was filmed on location helps greatly.
To those who complained about the ""slowness"" of this film, well, Christmas is about sitting back, looking back and telling family stories.

Another food onslaught at 'tea time' and after that the entertainment around the piano.  The only thing different about this, is that Christmas-time in New Zealand is mid summer, so there was no hoping for snow on Christmas day.

No holiday season should pass without watching this at least once. The relationship between grandfather and grandson was so touching and real, the kind I'm creating with my granddaughters now. And the extended family relationships in the production brought many a knowing smile to my face. Who wouldn't want an Auntie Hannah as a cherished family member?

He displays in his acting a love for Dylan Thomas's story, along with pathos and great warmth and genuine feeling for the words and sentiment. I have loved this film since I saw it on Channel 5 when my kids were growing up here in England back in 1991 or 2. Since that time it has NEVER again been shown in the UK on TV since then. Also, it is unavailable in the UK on DVD, but I ordered a Region 1 copy from the US that I can only watch on my lap-top. It is sacrilige that this is unavailable in the UK. It is easily the most beautiful Christmas film ever made. Also, it does complete and utter justice to Dylan Thomas's great story. And this comes from someone who is an absolute Dylan Thomas purist. Denholm Elliott was a wonderful, wonderful actor, far too sensitive a man for the grossly competitive world of hollywood film-making, although his performance in ""Room with a view"" was also superlative. So too was his brilliant performance as ""The Signalman"" in Charles Dickens' ghost story.

It's a great addition to a Christmas video collection, but it's certainly not in the category of most animated TV specials. More of a ""thinking man's"" holiday story, perhaps.

Portraying a kind-hearted grandfather, the late great Denholm Elliot lovingly spins this Christmas tale from childhood for his enraptured grandson Thomas. Although the film includes many great visual scenes, ""Mrs. Prothero's house fire"", ""The uncles"", and the ""two pipe-smoking young men walking undaunted toward the sea"", to name a few, it emphasizes Thomas's evocative text, thus creating a rather wordy film. Although lyrical, the film progresses quite nicely, moving seemlessly between the grandfather's childhood remembrances and the present.  A well-wrought and beautiful film, my only criticism would be a technical one, and perhaps I'm splitting hairs, but I had hoped that it could have been produced in anamorphic widescreen, filling the entire screen of a 16x9 tv.

Mathonwt Reeves makes a very good as the young Thomas, and really steals the show.  I have found much to relate to in the story having several uncles that somewhat resemble those of old Geraint, and who could forget Auntie Hannah who works her way through various wines and laces her tea with rum. The fire in the Prothero house is always a delight as is Christmas caroling in front of the haunted house and the pranks perpetrated by the children (blowing the dog whistle) and the adults (the clockwork mouse).

The true delight of this program is the celebration of Christmas as a holiday for family and friends without the strident commercialism of today.  There are presents, of course, but they are not an obsession and the traditional aspects of Christmas - a family dinner, snowy Winter days, time spent with family and friends.  One family tradition that this program started for me was opening Christmas crackers before dinner, something that I have observed every year since A Child's Christmas in Wales aired.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1169769600,2,1570,4.760147601476015

319089,4,6301115538,"Like so many other who have seen this seasonal film year after year, it truly is a family classic that conjures up the Christmas spirit every year.  The poetry, acting and setting are perfect.

HOWEVER ... if you are looking for the complete film (and the complete poem) this DVD does not provide it.  You can't believe my disappointment when the family gathered round to watch this newly purchased DVD and at the end we all looked at each other and noted scene upon scene that had been omitted from the DVD version that were part of the video version.  I can't fathom why this was done, especially considering the fact that this is a classic piece of poetry.  It would be like chopping out scenes from Shakespeare.  Both the video version and the DVD version say the running time is 55 minutes but I have to doubt the accuracy of the time on the DVD considering it's short by about 5 plus scenes.

For anyone interested, here are some of the scenes that are missing:

* Eating sugar ""fags"" (candy cigarettes) outside.

* Finding a dead bird in the snow.

* Seeing his reflection in a store window.

* Following the old man with yellow gloves from the cemetery.

* Two young men walking briskly down to the sea.

* From the window looking in at old uncles smoking cigars and old aunts sipping tea.

I may follow-up with the producers of the DVD the reason for these omissions.  Will post again if I get an answer.

Despite it all, it is still a wonderful film and evokes the Christmas spirit!

Denholm Elliot, bless his dear departed heart, is so gentle, and the little actor playing the grandson does a great job and is such a cutie.

My parents taped this, one holiday season, off of our PBS station and  we've been watching it every Christmas since.  In fact we watched it for so long that the tape no longer worked well. So I was just thrilled when it was finally released on DVD.

  If you like the poem or even if you are unfamiliar with the Dylan Thomas poem you will enjoy watching ""A Child's Christmas in Wales"".  It is funny and nostalgic, filled with the wonderful lyrical and descriptive words of Thomas. I used to read along with the poem before we got the DVD but now it's great to have the subtitles on.  The accents are strong and take a little getting used to but the subtitles help if you don't want to read along.

I look forward, as usual, to our Christmas viewing  of ""A Child's Christmas in Wales"" and hope to introduce some new people to this classic.

I never tire of its magical quality. Denholm Elliott is wonderful as the gentle grandfather telling his grandson the story of a long-ago childhood Christmas. Of course, Christmases are never so white as they are in one's own childhood. That is how the story begins. It continues with the events of a particular Christmas day...complete with visiting Aunts and Uncles, Christmas dinner and the shenanigans of ""naughty"" boys doing what boys did...and still do. Particularly poignant to me is the scene where the extended family is singing ""All Through the Night"" and the boy retires to his room where he looks out his window and reflects upon the day. The story comes to a close as the grandfather sees that snow is falling and that that yes, his now sleeping grandson will have the same magical memories.",1137456000,3,956,4.907407407407407

It is hard to describe this movie.  The poetry of Dylan Thomas combines with the images and story of the film in such a powerful imaginative way that I doubt I will ever want to just read the poem by itself.

There are so many classic moments.  Perhaps one of my favorites is the four boys going up to the old man's door to sing carols.  They try singing Good King Wenceslas but are frightened away by the haunting whispery singing on the other side of the door.

So well does this film conjure the savory smells coming from the Christmas-Day kitchen, when all the women are busy preparing the meal, that one's mouth waters.  We can't help but laugh at the uncles, who having stuffed themselves to capacity, loosen their belts and fall asleep in that fine sleeping time post-revelry.

The production shifts between a 'modern' family's Christmas eve and the half-remembered Christmas celebrations from the 'modern' grandfather's (Denholm Elliott) childhood. The family home is the same for both time periods, itself becoming a key character within the piece.

Dylan Thomas' poem is left intact and is BEAUTIFULLY and IMAGINATIVELY brought to life by a talented cast of Welsh actors, who act and sing their way with almost uncanny passion. The humor of the verse is actually improved by several visual gags.

For me, this is the best portrayal of Christmas ever filmed, with the possible exception of the last scene of a good ""Christmas Carol"". There is no suggestion of the ' freedom from avarice' theme that is key to ""Crhistmas Carol"", ""Miracle on 34th St"" and the newer Christmas productions. The spirit is entirely one of nostalgia, love and reflection -- surely those are the best emotions of all.
