6389773,5,B00JSC8BMU,"I recently purchased this set of Mack Sennett comedies, only having seen some of his work in compilation DVDs.
I would say that this is not only a collection of some outstanding farcical comedy, but a time capsule of life over a hundred years ago in parts of the United States. Filming around areas of Los Angeles and New York shows the viewer the surroundings and people of those places, of the types of transport and the culture of these places. Much would have changed in those 100 years, and so the images capture a time and place that no longer exists. It is fascinating to see the antique cars and planes, at the time considered the latest technology looking quaint to our eyes.
The short films themselves are priceless. No adjectives can properly describe their importance and relevance to American cinema and the creativity of Mack Sennett created an institution. I consider myself lucky to have seen these comedy shorts as they were pioneers to modern comedy. Considering their age, it is amazing that they have, firstly, survived, and secondly, been able to be restored and remastered to Blu-ray with outstanding results.
I would urge all those interested in silent cinema to buy this set. If you only buy one silent shorts compilation, then buy this one. But since this Volume One, I'll be buying the second one when it comes out, it'll be two compilations to have.
This is an outstanding set of silent cinema.",1409443200,12,1421,4.757085020242915

6389775,5,B00JSC8BMU,"I believe this to be the finest silent film set on Blu-Ray to date. Yes there are a few talkies on it as well..:)

Sure not every one of the films is perfect but that is due only to the rare source materials, some of which are over 100 years old.

Let's take ""Fatty and Mabel Adrift"" by far the best it has ever looked on home video and most importantly it runs as close to it's intended speed as Blu-Ray allows. It's actually funny now not like the version on Slapstick Encyclopedia which runs slower than watching grass grow.

Speaking of running speeds on the silents, admiring every frame as if it were a museum piece may be very European but that does not make it good. This set actually has all the fun and life intact and those involved should be very proud of their work.

If you are a fan of silent film comedy you will not do better than this magnificent set. For those who are not huge fans of silents let this set be the only one of the genre in your collection.  1000 STARS!",1408320000,16,987,4.173684210526316
6389776,5,B00JSC8BMU,"In the very early days of cinema, while D.W. Griffith was establishing film language, it was fellow pioneer Mack Sennett who brought laughter to the new lexicon. Sennet's Keystone Studio, a.k.a. The Fun Factory, cranked out one and two reel comedies that relied on visual gags and slapstick farce, usually laid out at a frenetic pace. This was where the first custard pie was thrown, and where the Keystone Cops, the Sennett Bathing Beauties, and Charlie Chaplin's Little Tramp were born. Dozens of other stars became famous at The Fun Factory: Mabel Normand, Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle, Harold Lloyd, Ben Turpin, Gloria Swanson, Harry Langdon, W.C. Fields, Carole Lombard, and Bing Crosby all owe their careers to Sennett.

For decades, these groundbreaking comedies weren't given the justice they deserve because of badly worn, splicy prints being projected at improper speeds, which destroyed subtle nuances and made the already frantic antics hard to keep up with. The true genius of these films was only apparent to historians and private collectors who cared enough to search vaults and archives for original nitrate prints, and have them preserved in the way they were meant to be enjoyed.

In this regard, we can be thankful that the folks at Flicker Alley have made available for the first time on Blu-ray, The Mack Sennett Collection (Vol. One), which contains fifty fully restored titles - nearly seventeen hours - all accompanied by newly recorded music scores. The three-disc set covers a balanced overview of Sennett comedians from 1909-1933, so we get a good sense of the variety of talent and comedic styles that flourished at the studio. Famous, influential films like BANGVILLE POLICE (1913) - the first Keystone Cops comedy, Arbuckle and Normand in FATTY AND MABEL ADRIFT (1916), TEDDY AT THE THROTTLE (1917) with Gloria Swanson, THE EXTRA GIRL (1923) with Mabel Normand, and the W.C. Fields classics THE DENTIST (1932) and THE FATAL GLASS OF BEER (1933) are all presented in exceptional quality, as are other less celebrated gems like A LOVER'S LOST CONTROL (1915) with Syd (Charlie's brother) Chaplin, MADCAP AMBROSE (1916) with Mack Swain, DOWN ON THE FARM (1920) with Louise Fazenda, HIS MARRIAGE WOW (1925) with Harry Langdon, and THE PRIDE OF PIKEVILLE (1927) with Ben Turpin. There's also some pleasant surprises in the bonus features, such as rarely seen footage of Sennett's Bathing Beauties putting on a display for a delighted crowd at Venice Beach.

All of the material has been compiled from the best extant sources possible, courtesy the Blackhawk Films Collection, MoMA, Lobster Films, the Library of Congress and various private collectors. Quality of the films varies depending on age and nitrate decomposition, and for a few titles there's only one print in existence. Taken into account, these issues don't detract in any way from this splendid, long overdue home video release. Some of the films have audio commentaries that add good background information, and there's an illustrated booklet with liner notes. The lively music scores were provided by Philip Carli, Ben Model, Dennis Scott, Andrew Simpson, and Donald Sosin.

To have these timeless films together and in such great condition is a dream come true for every silent comedy enthusiast, and I heartily give this fun-filled collection my highest recommendation.",1407974400,14,3358,5.1900369003690034
6389777,5,B00JSC8BMU,"I have not yet seen the collection and I am pre-ordering it under the strength of Paul Gierucki's name on the credits, Lobster Film and others who have done high quality restorations of our silent film classics.  I did not see if there are any audio commentaries but I hope there are for they give the viewer a 20th/21st century insight into one of the best comic producers.  We are so fortunate to have this set in our hands. I can't wait.",1407974400,2,440,4.353658536585366
6389778,5,B00JSC8BMU,"I have eagerly awaited this release since I first heard about it. The opportunity to see some of the lesser known Keystone comedies in Flicker Alley's usual excellent transfers was one that couldn't be passed up. I am happy to report that not only was I pleasantly surprised and completely satisfied, but this set exceeded my wildest expectations. If you want a representaive sampling of the man responsible for much of American silent comedy, here it is. Everyone knows the name of Mack Sennett (1880-1960) but outside of Charlie Chaplin, Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle, and the Keystone Cops, very little of Sennett's vast output has been seen. This set not only rectifies that but presents its offerings in chronological order from D.W Griffith's landmark THE CURTAIN POLE (1909) through W.C. Fields' surreal and utterly bizarre THE FATAL GLASS OF BEER (1933). Most people aren't aware of just how long Sennett was active, how many changes he went through, or how many major careers he launched but this 3 Blu-Ray set and the accompanying booklet will help to remedy that. There is even guest commentary on a number of the offerings that add more historical detail for those of you (like me) who can't get enough background information.

Disc 1 finally allowed me to see THE CURTAIN POLE in its entirety. It gives Sennett one of his first starring roles and he wrote it as well. Next up are 2 rare Biograph comedies along with the first important Mabel Normand vehicle THE WATER NYMPH (1912). Several short Keystone comedies follow that introduce us to Ford Sterling, Mack Swain as his Ambrose character and a brief (6 minutes) Chaplin effort that shows him honing his tramp character. 24 films in all including a beautiful print of FATTY & MABEL ADRIFT (1915). Disc 2 offers 9 two reelers featuring the likes of Syd Chaplin and Harry Langdon as well as  a couple of feature films including Mabel Normand's last hurrah, THE EXTRA GIRL (1923). Disc 3 starts out with 5 silents and then moves into the talkie era as it showcases 2 W.C. Fields shorts including a pristine uncut version of the heavily censored THE DENTIST (1932). There's also a brief early color short with sound, THE BLUFFER, which I had never even heard of until now.  As if that weren't enough, each disc comes with a number of bonus shorts including outtakes, rare footage of the actors at work, and a couple of tributes. It may seem pricey but you get what you pay for and then some. Now I'm ready for Volume 2.",1407542400,31,2476,4.740139211136891
6389779,5,B00JSC8BMU,"The transfers are superb as is the documentation. This is also the only set that has W.C. Fields' ""The Dentist"" uncut and without deteriorated footage spliced in. A marvelous set. When do we get Vol 2?",1462406400,,201,4.611111111111111

Commentary tracks by specialists and afficionados like Steve Massa or Paul Gierucki are very instructive and often funny. And great new musical scores by Ben Model, Donald Sosin...

If you love the silent era, especially silent comedy, this will quickly become a favorite volume.  Finally, crisp, clear prints worthy of the classic content contained within. This is a robust representative sample of the best Mack Sennett offered during the golden years of the Fun Factory.  I've only watched half the films so far, but I can't wait to see the rest.  Lots of rare and interesting extras in the set, too.

6389786,5,B00JSC8BMU,"There are two BIG things I really like about this collection.
1) These are the best presentations of these comedies I have ever seen.
2) This is ""Volume 1"" indicating there will be more volumes to come.
One needs to understand that most Mack Sennett films survive today because of the 16mm home movie market which started in the late 1920's and became the home to many silent films when sound hit the theaters and theatrical re-issues were not likely.

To avoid double-dipping, Charlie Chaplin appears only twice in this set. Charlie has his own Keystone DVD set.  Charley Chase is also hardly seen here, his Keystones are in the Becoming Charlie Chase DVD set.

Image quality ratings:
***** = very sharp with excellent contrast (equal to the way it looked in 35mm Nitrate projection)
**** = sharp image with good contrast. Lines will be a little softer that above & gray-tones will exhibit a slightly higher contrast.
*** = image has s slight softness & contrast is higher, grey[tone scales are more limited to dark & light.
--No prints in this set exhibit any picture quality less than 3 stars, this is not a ""Alpha Video"" or ""Madacy"" low quality release. All images went through image stabilization.
Studios mare mentioned when Mack Sennett worked for other studios.

Disc #1
1) THE CURTAIN POLE (1909)  (10:02) Biograph w/ Mack Sennett (directed by D.W. Griffith)
*** Image Quality, some fogging & scratches.
**** Comedy Value
Primitive comedy spending 10 minutes demonstrating how to knock people & objects over with a curtain pole while driving a horse drawn wagon as the angry victims give chase.  Primitive, but still fun.

2) THE MANICURE LADY (1911) (11:22) Biograph w/ Mack Sennett, Vivian Prescott
**** Image Quality
**** Comedy Value
A more subdued comedy with Mack as a love-loran barber with eyes for the manicurist.

3) A DASH THROUGH THE CLOUDS (1912) (10:16) Biograph w/ Mabel Normand, Jack Pickford
**** Image Quality
*** Comedy Value
This is more of a novelty to see the early aeroplanes than a comedy.

4) THE WATER NYMPH (1912) (8:20 *the menu says 18 minutes) Keystone w/ Mabel Normand, Mack Sennett, Ford Sterling.
*** Image Quality, contrast a little high.
** Comedy Value
One of the earliest Keystone Comedies released.  Sennett's indoor studios have not yet been made, so most filming was done outside.  This is more of a curiosity than a comedy.
There is a lot of talking without any dialogue cards

5) A GROCERY CLERK'S ROMANCE (1912) (7:38) Keystone w/ Ford Sterling.
*** Image Quality, better than ""Nymph"" but still washed out.
* Comedy Value
This is more of as spoof of melodramas of the time and not a comedy.  It does not play well today, the ending does not satisfy.
A Grocery Clerk (so the title implies) is in love with a married woman and plots to kill her husband and marry her.
See ""The Great Toe Mystery"" (below) to see how it is done right.

6) ON HIS WEDDING DAY (1913) (6:16) Keystone Farce Comedy w/ Ford Sterling, Mabel Normand, Helen Holmes.
**** Image Quality, though there is some double image blur in the last few minutes. This is a problem in the source film print.
**** Comedy Value.
While Ford Sterling's mannerisms spoof now forgotten melodrama stars, his performance as well as the comedy itself is still a lot of fun to watch.  Some early comedy cops appear in this Keystone comedy, but not quite yet the ""Keystone Kops"".  Filmed at Echo Park where Chaplin's ""Recreation"" would be filmed later.

7) BANGVILLE POLICE (1913) (6:27) Keystone Farce Comedy w/ Fred Mace, Mabel Normand, Nick Cogley, Dot Farley.
***** Image Quality
***** Comedy Value
While the title may suggest this is a Keystone Kops comedy it is really more of a comedy of rural cops who do not wear the traditional Keystone Kops outfits.

8) A FISHY AFFAIR (1913) (7:10) Keystone Farce Comedy w/ Ford Sterling. Laura Oakley, Bert Hunn, Rube Miller.
**** Image Quality, some heavier negative wear.
***** Comedy Value
Ford Sterling goes fishing at the California Alligator Park.
A pratfall comedy cop is thrown in for good measure.

9) THE SPEED KINGS - EARL COOPER AND TEDDY TETZLAFT
(1913) (8:33) Keystone Comedy w/ Mabel Normand, Ford Sterling, Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle, and real life racers Barney Oldfield, Earl Cooper, and Teddy Tetzlaff (note correct spelling).
***** Image Quality, but with some nitrate deterioration.
** Comedy Value
Filmed at the Santa Monica Road Race.  Typical of to Sennett use a local event to make a film.

10) A THIEF CATCHER (1914) (8:00) Keystone Farce Comedy w/ Ford Sterling, Mack Swain, Edgar Kennedy, Rube Miller, and Charlie Chaplin as a cop.
***** Image Quality
***** Comedy Value
-The discovery of this `Lost' film in 2010 by Paul Gierucki was a BIG deal. Not only is it an excellent comedy with a big star cast, its discovery also re-wrote the books on Charlie Chaplin by adding a 36th Chaplin Keystone film appearance! Look for Charlie in costume as a cop.
While this is the same one-and-only surviving print used in the ""Chaplin at Keystone"" DVD release, a new HD transfer has been made with better black levels and no compression artifacting.

11) THE GREAT TOE MYSTERY (1914) (10:51) Keystone Farce Comedy w/ Charles Parrott (aka Charley Chase), Alice Howell, KEYSTONE KOPS.
**** Image Quality
***** Comedy Value
Possibly Charley's first starring comedy.  Shoe-salesman Charley falls for a beautiful, but married, female customer.  He woos her in the park as her jealous husband comes after him.  Notice how much better this story line plays than it did in ""A Grocery Clerk's Romance"". Add a little bit of innocents, and a lot more comedy, throw in the Keystone Kops and you have a 5-star comedy!

12) RECREATION (1914) (5:24) Keystone Farce Comedy w/ Charlie Chaplin, Peggy Page.
This very short film made at Echo Park has Charlie getting in trouble with a sailor & some cops over a girl. While the `half-reel' length doesn't allow for much character development, Charlie is still fun to watch.
*** Image Quality (Most of this a MAJOR improvement over the old Chaplin at Keystone DVD, now there are grey-tones & face details. BUT the 35mm footage presented in the old DVD is not present here! What a shame. I don't know why the crisp footage was not included here.)
**** Comedy Value
Desolate Charlie is about to throw himself off a bridge in a park when a lady passes by and changes his mine.

13) SHOT IN THE EXCITEMENT (1914) (11:49) Keystone Farce Comedy w/ Alice Howell, Al St. John, Rube Miller, Josef Swickard.
*** Image quality, contrast is a bit high.
**** Comedy Value
Two men cause mayhem fighting over Alice while her dad fends them off in this knock-about comedy.

14) THE NOISE OF BOMBS (1914) (11:33) Keystone Farce Comedy w/ Charlie Murray, Edgar Kennedy, Lucille Ward, Josef Swickard, Charles Parrott (aka Charlie Chase).
***** Image Quality
***** Comedy Value
It is fun to see some of these up-and-coming stars in their early beginnings. Why throw bricks when you can throw cannon balls & bombs! Top notch Keystone slapstick farce complete with cops.

15) AMBROSE'S FIRST FALSEHOOD (1914) (11:14) Keystone Farce Comedy w/ Mack Swain, Minta Durfee, Edgar Kennedy, Charles Parrott (Charley Chase).
**** Image Quality
**** Comdey Value
In a story re-used by many (even Laurel & Hardy in The Sons Of the Desert), Mack Swain sneaks off to a night club instead fo taking a train trip. His wife reads in the newspaper that the train wrecked and all were killed, so how did her husband survive?

16) A BIRD'S A BIRD (1915) (12:50) Keystone Farce Comedy w/ Chester Conklin, Minta Durfee, Dutch Ward, Bill Hauber, Alice Davenport.
*** Image Quality, contrast a little high & image a little dark. Window-boxing is more extreme here.
**** Comedy Value
Chester searches around the house for something to cook for dinner.

17) GUSSLE'S DAY OF REST (1915) (21:47) Keystone Farce Comedy w/ Syd Chaplin, Cecile Arnold, Slim Sommerville, Phyllis Allen, Eddie Cline.
**** Image Quality, but window-boxing seems more extreme.
**** Comedy Value
Gussle spends a day in the park with his overbearing wife. When she falls asleep, Gussle slips off to be with a younger girl.

18) DO-RE-MI-BOOM! (1915) (11:40) Keystone Farce Comedy w/ Chester Conklin, Charles Arling, Harry Booker, Fred Fishback
**** Image Quality
**** Comedy Value
Chester's music teacher is interested in the same woman as Chester. So Chester decides to try to plant a bomb in the teacher's piano to eliminate the competition.

19) A LOVER'S LOST CONTROL (1915) (22:20) Keystone Farce Comedy w/ Syd Chaplin, Phyllis Allen.
**** Image Quality, but window-boxing seems more extreme.
***** Comedy Value
Syd Chaplin shows he has some of the talents of Charlie.  He gets into more trouble while shopping with his wife in a department store.  I won't ruin any gags by mentioning them here.

20) A SUBMARINE PIRATE (1915) (24:23) Triangle-Keystone w/ Syd Chaplin, Phyllis Allen, Glen Cavender, Wesley Ruggles, Louise Fazenda.
**** Image Quality
**** Comedy Value
Syd Chaplin is at it again, this time he overhears a plot to rob a ship by submarine.  Sennett is starting to use more story plot in his films.

21) FATTY AND MABEL ADRIFT (1916) (30:38) Triangle-Keystone w/ Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle, Mabel Normand, Al St. John, Frank Hayes, May Wells, Wayland Trask, Glen Cavender, Luke the Dog.
***** Image Quality from a tinted 35mm print!
One of the few tinted prints in this set.
***** Comedy Value.
A cinematic triumph! Roscoe puts the D.W. Griffith touch to his comedy. Serious thought went into the camera angles, lighting, shadows, in-camera effects and animation.  The acting is `realistic', the story is timeless.  One can imagine this story being shot today.  Roscoe & Mabel meet, fall in love, get a home by the sea, and a storm brews as Al St. John also has his heart set on Mabel.  If by chance you are seeing this for the first time, watch it without the commentary as there are spoilers in the commentary.

22) HIS BITTER PILL (1916) (19:35) Triangle-Keystone w/ Mack Swain, Louella Maxam, Ella Haines, Edgar Kennedy.
**** Image Quality
**** Comedy Value
Some of the humor in this western spoof may be lost today as it has fun with the popular westerns of that time.  However, the humorous inter-titles are just as fun today.

23) MADCAP AMBROSE (1916) (21:44) Triangle-Keystone w/ Mack Swain, Polly Moran, May Wells, Edgar Kennedy, Frank Hayes, May Emory, Louise Morrison.
**** Video Quality
***** Comedy Value
Its romance on the farm, Keystone style. Add a traveling female artist looking for male models to the mix and you have a Mack Sennett merry mix-up.

24) TEDDY AT THE THROTTLE (1917) (26:36) Triangle-Keystone w/ Bobby Vernon, Gloria Swanson, Wallace Beery, May Emory, Blanch Phillips, Charles Bennett, Teddy the Dog.
*** Image Quality, the contrast is a bit high & the focus a little soft.
***** Comedy Value.
Bobby will only get his rich inheritance if he marries. Scoundrels plot to marry him. Then a second will turns up to add more confusion.  The confusing title to this film may be based on the popularity of car racing at that time. The Teddy in the title is the family dog, and he doesn't drive a car.  Teddy is essential to the film in this spoof of melodramas complete with dastardly men tying fair maidens to the railroad tracks.

***Bonus Material***
Silent out-takes & Rushes from ""The Water Nymph"" & ""Bathing Beauties"" (9:01) These out-takes have quite a bit of sex appeal!
Rare silent footage of the Edendale Sennett Studios exterior (1:03)
Original 1922 theatrical trailer for ""The Crossroads Of New York"" (1:22) it is fun to see a rare silent movie pre-view.
A Blu-ray PDF of ""The Sennett Story"". Unfortunately my computer only has a DVD drive so I could not view it.

Disc #2
25) HER TORPEDOED LOVE (1917) (21:08) Triangle-Keystone w/ Ford Sterling, Louise Fazenda, Keystone Kops.
**** Image Quality.
**** Comedy Value.
It takes a little while for this comedy to get going, but it picks up momentum as it goes on and ends with a frenzy.

26) A CLEVER DUMMY (1917) (19:23) Triangle-Keystone w/ Ben Turpin, Chester Conklin, Wallace Beery.
**** Image Quality, but with more tiny scratches than usual.  *** Comedy Value.
Imagine Ben Turpin as a 1917 mechanical dummy! The laughs are milder today until the grand climax.

27) HEARTS AND FLOWERS (1919 *the menu says 1912) (21:18 & *the menu says 10 minutes) Triangle-Keystone w/Ford Sterling, Louise Fazendale, Phyllis Haver, Billy Armsrong, Jack Ackroyd.
**** Image Quality.
*** Comedy Value.
One of the rare surviving Paramount Mack Sennett silent shorts.
An orchestra leader thinks he is marrying an heiress. The most amusing sequences come from the beginning at a nightclub.  The rest of the film gets a little tamer until the old `brick-in-the face' gets thrown and mayhem is the result.  Just why these old comedies thought throwing a bring in someone's face was funny is beyond me, but it does liven things up.

28) DOWN ON THE FARM (1920) (United Artists feature film 51:02) w/ James Finlayson, Louise Frazenda, Bert Roach, Harry Gibbon, Billy Armstrong, Ben Turpin, Teddy the Dog & Pepper the cat.
***** Image Quality.
*** Comedy Value.
Introduced as "" A Special Feature In Five Parts Produced By Mack Sennett"" with an areal shot flying over the Sennett Studios.

29) DON'T WEAKEN (1920) (21:27) w/ Charlie Murray, Ford Sterling, Jimmy Finlayson, Harriet Hammond, Fanny Kelly.
**** Image Quality.
*** Comedy Value.
Another rare Paramount Mack Sennett silent comedy. The picture has a little more contrast, but we are very lucky to be able to see this recently found print at all. This is a boxing comedy performed by Charlie & Ford, with Jimmy refereeing.  While their ring antics are fun to watch, I still prefer Jerome ""Curly"" Howard of The Three Stooges in the ring.

30) GYMNASIUM JIM (1922) (19:19) w/ Billy Bevin, Mildred June, Kewpie Morgan (often mistaken for Oliver Hardy), Marvin Loback.
***** Image Quality, with some **** inserts.
****** Comedy Value.
O.K., while I am using a 5-star rating system, I have to give this 6-stars because it is so wonderful.  The creative gags are just non-stop.  Billy plays a car mechanic who enters a boxing match with Kid Ryan.  This is equal to anything Chaplin or Hal Roach has done.  You will watch this one over and over!
Produced at First National Pictures.

31) THE EXTRA GIRL (1923) (Associated Exhibitors feature film 72:44) w/ Mabel Normand, Ralph Graves, Vernon Dent, Harry Gibbon, Billy Bevan, Max Davidson, William Desmond, Teddy the Dog & Dunk & Duma lions.
***** Image Quality.
***** Comedy Value.
This HAS to be my all time favorite Mabel Normand picture!
The presentation looks perfect, I have not had time to compare it to my various other copies.

32) THE DARE-DEVIL (1923) (19:56) w/ Ben Turpin, Harry Gibbon, Kewpie Morgan,
**** Image Quality, with *** inserts.
**** Comedy Value.
The 8th Pathe' film by Mack Sennett
A behind-the-scenes comedy gives a good insight on how early silent films were made.  Ben is always fun to watch and he does not fail here. Director Del Lord would reuse many of the clever gags from this films in his sound Columbia comedies with the Three Stooges.  Beware of a KKK poster gag that has a black man run in fear.

Vernon Dent gets to be a star in this gag-filled comedy.  An arial prison break picks up the wrong prisoner, Sid, forcing Vernon to break out on his own.  Both prisoners join up in their early comedy version of ""The Defiant Ones"".

***** Comedy Value.
Groom Harry waits for his wedding at the wrong church and must find his way to the right church.  Harry is at his best, and you can see how he influenced Stan Laurel in developing the innocent mayhem causing character.
This is a BIG video improvement over the washed out copy on the ""HARRY LANGDON COLLECTION: LOST AND FOUND"".  That old transfer looks like the old Xerox copies where the blacks fade to light gray. And the video grain is unbearable on that old DVD. Now this new Blu-ray has perfect blacks and no video grain.

I just love watching Harry Langdon's antics, and he is in top form here.  Costarring with Vernon Dent, married Harry gets talked into hanging out with some flirtatious women after work.
Comparing this transfer to a previous transfer in the ""HARRY LANGDON COLLECTION: LOST AND FOUND"" I find a vast over-all improvement. That previous release is riddled with video noise, a graininess caused by the video transfer, and not film grain. While the old transfer has a mild improvement on detail in dark areas, the whites are over-exposed.  This new HD transfer has no video noise, the whites are not over exposed, but the shadows in a FEW scenes have a little less detail. I emphasize that this is just a few scenes and a little less detail.  The overall presentation is a vast improvement.

Billy must deliver a block of ice up along flight of stairs! If these stairs look familiar it is because a year later Laurel & Hardy would try to deliver a washing machine up the stairs in their lost film ""HATS OFF"". The five years later they would deliver a piano up the stairs and win an Academy Award for ""THE MUSIC BOX"". In 1945 Edgar Kennedy visited the stairs in ""IT'S YOUR MOVE"".

-More of a novelty that a classic comedy. Combining Taxis & Mack Sennett brings images of car chases, but no such thing happens. Like Hal Roach's ""Taxi Boys"" series, the budgets were cut and very little happens on screen.

6389787,5,B00JSC8BMU,"EXCELLENT!  I am writing this to convince everyone that this is worth buying.  I am selfish and I want lots of people to buy this so that I can get more of these sets in the future.
You may feel the same way if you could see this for yourselves.
I have only watched disc one so far and the set is already 5 stars.  Let's see, there are 3 discs so that makes this a 15 star set!!
OK, here's my pitch...
The set starts out with a few pre-Keystones from Biograph.  The first one is one of the earliest things that Sennett ever did and it's impossible to describe the energy level in THE CURTAIN POLE.  This one is a classic and it's been in more than one set, but never as nice as it looks here.  They did it in the exact correct speed so it's working here better than it ever has.  It's a VERY funny film even though it was shot in 1909.  D.W. Griffith's first wife even got injured in this.  I think it's supposed to be on screen somewhere in this melee.
The Syd Chaplin Gussle shorts were a revelation.  He is so underrated.  Check out that bit with the potatoes in GUSSLE'S DAY OF REST.  Amazing.
If there are any Charley Chase fans out there, he's in two of these so far.  Not just bits where he is spotted in a crowd scene, he's in throughout the whole films and in THE GREAT TOE MYSTERY he's one of the leads.
Another plus is the complete THE WATER NYMPH. There are even outtakes from it!! Mabel Nommand is well represented in the set.  One of the commentators seems to say she is boring.  I must have heard that wrong.  Check out her first dive in THE WATER NYMPH.  NOT BORING!!  I think she's got those feremones or something and the still work on me 100 years later!!
I do agree with the same commentator in saying that Minta Durfee is marvelous.  He's dead on there.  She's was not just Roscoe Arbuckle's (one short has him in a bit part) ex-wife, she's an excellent comedienne, too.
Ever hear of Alice Howell?  She gets mentioned a lot in various silent comedy books.  Stan Laurel said she was the best silent comedienne of them all.  Many have heard the name but have not seen her.  She's in two of these (one opposite Chase) and she's just great!
Still not convinced this is worth the money?
Consider this.  There are 50 films in this set.  Two of them are features!  (DOWN ON THE FARM & THE EXTRA GIRL).  Many are 3 reelers and most are 2 reelers.
These discs are fully loaded.  I read that these are on Blu Ray not only because they have a higher bit rate, but also because they needed the space to FIT ALL THIS STUFF ON HERE!!  Thank you CineMuseum & Flicker Alley!!
Oh yeah, there is a short by some other guy named Chaplin that has never been seen before!  Only a piece of it was an extra on the CHAPLIN AT KEYSTONE set.  It's here complete.  You MUST listen to the commentary on this one.  It's a great story how this re-entered the Chaplin filmography.  Thank you CineMuseum & Flicker Alley & hero Paul Gieruki!!
There is a Mabel Normand short where she is flying on location in a very early airplane.  It is less than 10 years since Kitty Hawk.  Tragicly her co-star, who she drops Fred Mace for and flies off with at the end, was a real aviator who died in a crash before the film was released.
They also put all the films in chronological order so you can watch how these developed over the years.  Thank you CineMuseum & Flicker Alley!!
So do you think this is worth the money?  Don't forget that this is only the first disc I am raving about here!!  There are two more jam packed discs to go.  I am in heaven!!!  Thank you CineMuseum & Flicker Alley!!
If I had a complaint, it would be that I wish there were more commentaries.  There are a number of shorts here that would greatly benefit from one of the Silent Comedy Mafia being on board to identify some of the actors.  I do wish that Syd would have had a commentary.  Also having a commentary gets me to watch the film a second time right away.  PLEASE keep this in mind for volume 2, will ya??  Commentaries on EVERY film.  OK?
Thank you CineMuseum & Flicker Alley!!",1410739200,11,4045,4.21251629726206
6389788,5,B00JSC8BMU,"This is an incredible collection of films chronicling the career of Mack Sennett, digitally restored and rightfully described as Classic Comedies in the promotional material.  To say that the films are often breathtakingly funny is an understatement; but to finally see a previously undocumented and very early Charlie Chaplin film for the first time (A THIEF CATCHER) -- AND hear the fascinating commentary by Paul Gierucki on how he discovered a 16mm print in a flea market -- is worth the price of the set in itself.

And just like A THIEF CATCHER, many of the other 49 films included here have not been seen anywhere in decades, possibly not since the end of the silent film era.  As a bonus there's an excellent PDF article THE SENNETT STORY by film historian Joe Adamson which amounts to a book in itself, and 28 commentaries by other comedy film authorities including Brent Walker, Richard M. Roberts, Bruce Lawton, David B. Pearson and Steve Massa, among others, all of them adding Sennett lore to delight any film buff.  I haven't found them yet but I've read that another of my favorite comedy historians, Sam Gill, is represented here as well (for the dyed-in-the-wool aficionado, part of the fun is discovering who is featured on each track).

A few of the films included here were available years ago via the home movie market, but they never looked as pristine and beautiful as everything in this set.  And the majority of available titles were never easily accessible -- 15 years ago, the last time I had a chance to purchase a 16mm print of the Sennett classic BLACK OXFORDS, it sold for over $400 on eBay!
Other titles like A CLEVER DUMMY, GYMNASIUM JIM and the legendary W.C. Fields talkie THE DENTIST, seen in condensed or otherwise botched editions, are finally restored to their original completeness, it's like rediscovering a new and better film.

As the first volume in a planned two-volume set, I can't recommend this collection highly enough -- and eagerly look forward to the next volume.  There ought to be an Award created for Paul E. Gierucki and his CineMuseum Team for creating these restorations -- and to Flicker Alley for having the foresight to issue this incredible set.  Get it -- and discover the brilliant art of great screen comedy through a chronicle of fifty classic films -- or just rediscover why you fell in love with Mack Sennett  comedies, all over again!",1410048000,5,2403,4.796610169491525
8653729,5,B00JSC8BMU,"ok, I was a little skeptical in buying this on blu ray, all of my silent film collection is on dvd format and I don't want to re buy everything on blu ray. There is a HUGE improvement from dvd to blu ray, the image is more cleaner and less spotty or grainy. Harry Langdon's films have different music from the dvd releases and also the Chaplin's. Overall this is a must have for the silent film fan!

Any fan of comedy film should be interested in this set, which features many stars, including Mabel Normand, Ford Sterling, Charlie Chaplin, Marie Dressler, Ben Turpin, and W.C. Fields. Even Sennett himself comes around as a surprisingly good comic actor. Of course, not every film has stood the test of time, but there are enough gems. Beautiful copies, excellent soundtracks. Highly recommended.",1502409600,,573,5.3076923076923075
8653734,5,B00JSC8BMU,"I confess that the only reason I purchased this was because it includes the short ""Run, Girl, Run"" which is otherwise only available on a poor 16mm print elsewhere. If you are the film historian type or a fan of the comic antics of Harry Langdon or Ben Turpin (I'm not really), then this is for you. There isn't much in the way of the Keystone Cops or Fatty Arbuckle, but one must be impressed by the restoration work done on these films overall, Proof that this project was taken seriously and the best available prints were found and properly restored is W.C. Fields ""The Dentist."" I have the Criterion Collection DVD of six Fields shorts which includes this title; Criterion generally does fine work restoring old films, but they apparently were forced to insert a low-quality print of  the ""infamous"" patient scene that was cut even in those Pre-Code days because it was too ""sexually suggestive."" Here, a pristine and uncut print was used that shows no evidence of tampering. So, if you are a fan of Mack Sennett's early comedy shorts or just want to be familiarized with history, ""history"" won't look any better than this.",1501200000,2,1128,4.696969696969697
