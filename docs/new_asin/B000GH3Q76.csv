8132139,3,B000GH3Q76,"Being a fan of Bud Spencer and Terence Hill comedies, including the music, I reckon this movie is good. That is even although it's not considered one of Bud Spencer's best comedies. (Otherwise there would surely be more editions and releases of it.)
A South African, Kallie Knoetze, plays the part of an American soldier boxer. The movie is also a good example of how American soldiers can misbehave in a foreign country, and therefore be disliked.
The movie has basically the same story as  '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/They-Called-Him-Bulldozer/dp/B000XPU5HA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">They Called Him Bulldozer</a>', an earlier Bud Spencer comedy. (That's with the gridiron, not the ninja.) A lot of Hollywood (& Hollywood type) movies have similar stories. I'd say that if getting this movie, also get ""They Called Him Bulldozer"", for the complete story.
I liked that dune buggy, which is quite fancy and impressive. There is also good Austrian/Bavarian folk music.
This DVD has a bad soundtrack though. I could hardly hear what they were saying.",1212192000,2,1092,5.618181818181818
8132140,3,B000GH3Q76,"Bud Spencer stars as Bud Graziano a former heavyweight boxing champ who loses a fight after a crooked army sarge hit his right hand and leaves to be a sailor. A boxing promoter offers him to train a new challenger so he accepts and train the kid until he fights to Rosco Dunn the sarge Bomber fought. As like all the Bud Spencer movies we have lots of punches,hits quickie moves and humor. Shot entirely in Rome some scenes remember me of Rocky(the training scenes. Entertaining only for Spencer fans.",1160611200,4,501,4.5777777777777775
