8011318,5,B0001EKS3Y,"My Husband being a born Viennise was really Happy to have found this, it is a delightfull variation of the famous Operetta from J. Strauss, the Costumes and Scene are beautifull and the Singing is superb. If you don't understand the Viennise Dialect enjoy it anyway, it is a wonderfull production.",1389830400,,297,4.8431372549019605
8011319,3,B0001EKS3Y,"There is no English subtitle. Performance could be good. But if you don't understand German, you may avoid this DVD.",1385769600,,116,4.85
8011320,3,B0001EKS3Y,"The production was very good; the singing was very good; the quality of the disc is very good. It should have deserved a four star rating. May be even 5. The problem is the subtitle  none. Subtitle is always an important part in a disc of operettas. I had watched the Kollo/Hallstein version before, which has subtitles. I still could not follow all the connections in this one. Having said, one should consider the price of this disc  very cheap; or I should say very value. So if you don't care about the subtitle It is a four star disc.",1366156800,,539,4.38
8011321,4,B0001EKS3Y,"This operetta was NOT written by Strauss but by others using themes from his operettas.  This production is attractive to watch and well performed, but lacks subtitles.  No idea what's going on but who cares?",1277337600,2,208,4.914285714285715
8011322,1,B0001EKS3Y,"the overall production was very poor---sound,acting,scenery,effects, all too ""jazedup"" unnecessary. The jacked lacked a libretto.
the disc is either defective or dirty???First time play???
sorry, but never again",1216425600,3,211,6.571428571428571
8011323,4,B0001EKS3Y,Just be advised: regardless of claims in the description information - this DVD does NOT have subtitles.,1163376000,20,104,5.176470588235294
8011324,4,B0001EKS3Y,"First off, this otherwise gorgeous and hilarious operetta production has no subtitles or other aid for the linguistically-challenged.  So if you don't understand German--particularly the dense and humorous Vienna dialect also heard in the movie ""The Third Man""--think twice.  By the way, the title ""Viennes Blood"" is not only a misspelling but is also not the usual translation, ""Vienna Blood,"" meaning roughly ""the Viennese character.""

Luckily, the plot is easy to follow even without a translation, a standard marital farce much like ""The Marriage of Figaro,"" with wayward counts, jilted countesses, and saucy servants chasing spouses and mistresses whose identities are constantly being mistaken, and all forgive each other in the end.  The outdoor production is magnificent and inventive, using water, foliage, boats, costumes, lights, and horses to create a fantasy Vienna circa 1815.  This is a traditional-style, not a Euro-trendy designer, production.

Singing and acting are superb, as is the video quality, and a meaty Strauss family biography (in English) provides a very worthwhile extra.  The audio quality is vivid on the individually-miked voices, a little distant for the pit orchestra which looks as if it is almost under water.  A huge bargain at the price, and operetta-lovers can hardly go wrong.",1118016000,12,1317,5.45320197044335
