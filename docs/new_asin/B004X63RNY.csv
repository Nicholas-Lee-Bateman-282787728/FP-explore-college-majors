4492126,4,B004X63RNY,"This movie was first released in 1956(2011) in B/W and full screen 1.33.1 and runs 79 minutes. The sound and the picture quality are very good. There are no extras. The film starts with a poster of Tris Hatten (RAYMOND BURR) offering a reward for him dead or alive, for killing Sheriff Bates and his deputies. Sheriff Wade Addams (HUGH O'BRIAN) was showing 12 year old Clay Gipson (DONALD MacDONALD) target practice using this poster. Tris was supposed to be dead. Clay's father Tom Gipson (ROBERT BURTON) brings him a horse and they name it 'SINOYE'. Later Tris rides into Apache Ben town and demands to see Millie Street (REBA TASSELL). Sanchez goes to give her the message. Clay's sister Linda Gipson (NANCY GATES) wants best for him, but she does not want her brother to be like Sheriff Addams. Tom advises Linda to marry Wade and asks him to turn his badge in and join him at the ranch. Out riding at night, Clay follows Millie to Tris's house and as Tris comes out, Clay recongnises him from the poster. On return, Clay tells Sheriff Addams that he saw Tris with Millie. Sheriff goes to investigate and Clay who was supposed to go home, follows. Sheriff arrests Tris and locks him up in the jail. His deputies were to keep 24 hours watch on Hatten. In the saloon, Sheriff says, he wants to know if any strangers came in. At the ranch, Sheriff wade tells Linda, that his sheriff job was still there for another 1 year and after that he would give up his badge. Linda was frightened for him. Jonathan Tatum (WILLARD SAGE), newspaper owner gets Clay and Tom into Apache Ben town, to get their story for the reward money. Sheriff Addams is worried that Tris's men may harm Clay or Tom. Sheriff was waiting for the judge to come for the trial. As Linda comes to town, Sheriff sees 3 drifters riding in and entering the saloon.
How will it end? Will Tris go to trial or break jail? Will Sheriff Addams get any support from the town? Will Clay, Tom or Linda be harmed by Tris's men? Who are these 3 drifters just come to Apache Ben? What will Sheriff Addams do after all this is over?
This story of GEORGE ZUCKERMAN is well photographed in B/W by CHARLES VAN ENGER and slightly slowly directed by GERD OSWALD. Hugh O'Brian and Raymond Burr give good performances. The action scenes are good too.

4492147,4,B004X63RNY,"I have seen a few westerns lately that have had titles that any teen aged kid could come up with.  I think the title of the movie should be as interesting as the movie itself.  I nearly passed up The Brass Legend just because of the boring title.  Only after I read it started Hugh OBrian did I decide to watch it.

Hughs role in this movie was right up his alley.  If I had come in in the middle of the movie and didn't know what it was, my immediate guess would have been The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp the 19551961 TV series, except as Wyatt Earp his was much better dressed.
Also, seeing Raymond Burr playing a hardcore bad guy was kind of interesting as well.  He plays a much better western bad guy that he did as Perry Mason, I never did like that series for some reason.  So overall I liked the movie very much.  Actually, whats not to like with Hugh OBrian in it.  I will give it four stars and a grade of B-.",1449100800,,921,4.016483516483516

4492160,1,B004X63RNY,"Sometimes, even when you don't like a movie much, you at least like one or more of the characters.
And while we love seeing anything with Hugh O'Brian and Raymond Burr - we couldn't find anything sympathetic or likeable about either character.
Both my husband and I were grumbling about how stupid the various actions in the movie were.
Finally, when it was over, we both realized how much the other didn't like it.
(I stayed with him, thinking that may he liked it because it was a western)
Conclusion - you should have told me sooner - we could have turned it off.",1425081600,3,566,4.451923076923077

8446121,4,B004X63RNY,"Hugh O'Brian, then starring as Wyatt Earp on TV, plays a dedicated sheriff dealing with conflicted townsfolk as he holds an outlaw wanted for murder who's too crafty to stay in jail for long. The outlaw is played by Raymond Burr, who was a great big-screen heavy before he moved to stardom on the small screen as lawyer Perry Mason a year after this film. Low-key b&w western, strong on drama and character, short on action (although there's a great shootout midway through that's short and sweet and an exciting final showdown), extremely well-written, solid cast, sharp direction. I'd never seen this before finding it on Amazon Prime. I've seen hundreds of westerns, yet there are plenty I haven't seen that are waiting to be discovered. Highly recommended.",1461024000,,760,4.9453125
8446122,4,B004X63RNY,"This is a good, low budget, on-location western with good actors and plenty of action and character development.  I'd watch it again.",1457395200,,133,5.045454545454546
