2815406,5,B000PC6YSA,My great grandmother was a midwife in rural Georgia in the 1920's so this is a wonderful reminder of all those great women who brought so many miracles into the world with so little to work with and did it so well!,1354492800,,214,4.119047619047619
2815407,5,B000PC6YSA,"to have discovered this film.  I was searching for anything I could fine on classic African American movies when I found this one.  After watching Bright Roads/Dorothy Dandridge, Harry Belafonte, I wanted to see more positive and realistic movies about the communities I grew up in.  I was born in the mid 50's in the deep south and have enjoyed listening to my grandmothers and aunts about the way life was in ""their"" time.  My mother had her first child at home delivered by a midwife and a home visit by the doctor.  However, having given birth in hospitals, I could not fully comprehend giving birth at home.  I wanted details!  Well, I have the details now, lol.  A film to be proud of.  A midwife to be proud of--and the many other midwives who care for our community when there was no other place to go.  I could go on and on about the stories my husband told me (he was 12 years older than me and born and raised in the country) of how his grandmother used to ""doctor"" them at home, for example, a nearly cut off finger among other things.  This movie is a bit of history everyone should watch--so happy to have found it.",1343347200,7,1129,4.354066985645933
2815408,5,B000PC6YSA,"This film, originally made as a training film for midwives by the Georgia Department of Health, is an incredible document. It documents another era, when ""granny midwives"" were the only providers available to poor, black women in the rural South.
The subject of the film, ""Miss Annie"" was like a pillar of strength for families in her county.
Also very moving was the interview with her grandson. He described the journey of discovery that he and his family made, because of the film, and how it deepened their knowledge of their mother's/grandmother's vital place in the community.",1308009600,13,582,5.010309278350515
2815409,5,B000PC6YSA,"Although there is no indication in the amazon.com description, this DVD also contains a full-length audio commentary by filmmaker George Stoney on the production of ALL MY BABIES, a somewhat shorter commentary providing an introduction and context for PALMOUR STREET, and a brochure which reprints a long essay by Stoney on the research and pre-production work on ALL MY BABIES.  The commentaries were recorded when Mr. Stoney was 90 years old, but reveal him to have been as sharp as a pin, with a remarkably detailed memory of his work, and many insights worth sharing.  Full disclosure:  I produced this DVD purely out of admiration for this man and his wonderful film, and believe it will touch and impress all who view it.",1212364800,20,727,4.894308943089431
2815410,5,B000PC6YSA,"I first saw ""All My Babies"" as a new midwife in the 1970s. What an inspiration this tireless GA licensed midwife was to me and to the homebirth/midwifery movement.

African-American families had little or no access to medical care in Georgia during this time but received excellent care from their midwives.

Highly recommended for those who treasure our history!",1203552000,18,363,5.135593220338983
2815411,5,B000PC6YSA,Renting movies from Amazon was a lot faster and quicker than I thought. The film was in very good quality. I needed this for classes I'm taking and was able to get it quickly from Amazon. I would recommend renting from Amazon anytime. The movie was very educational about the midwives in that area during that time.,1394323200,3,315,4.543859649122807
2815412,5,B000PC6YSA,A must see for anyone in the healthcare profession.  Genuine.  [...]<check this out if you liked the movie.  We had to watch this for a culture class and another student found that link to the writers story about the film.  I'd like to read the whole thing if I could find it.  The link only provides a portion.,1391644800,,311,4.293103448275862
2815413,4,B000PC6YSA,"I am a midwife and this film is one of the ones that inspired me way back in nursing school to wish to someday practice as a midwife.  Some things are dated, but there is one astounding birth story shown with great respect and love.",1390694400,3,232,4.155555555555556
2815414,5,B000PC6YSA,"This was made in 1953, I think, in a rural black southern town.  It was the way things used to be, natural and the midwife was delightful and cared about her work.  I got a surprise when there was an actual scene of a birth.  It was beautiful. She even examined the placenta and it did not make me want to hurl.  So natural.  I was also taken by one mother to be who lived in a ramshackle house with flies everywhere and the walls lined with flattened out supermarket boxes!  Someone can tell you about something like that but to actually see it was so dramatic.  They did not even seem to think twice about it.  It is a must see.  No Fred Astaire dancing, just real life.  I googled it and found out that it has been praised all over the world to this day.  I agree that it deserves it.",1388793600,4,787,4.078431372549019
2815415,5,B000PC6YSA,"This was an interesting film, educational and historical. I learned a lot and saw rural health care practices I had never seen before.",1384041600,,134,4.869565217391305
2815416,5,B000PC6YSA,She was one amazing and caring woman. This documentary is eye opening and just worth the watch. I love it!,1376438400,3,106,4.35
2815417,4,B000PC6YSA,I found this video very interesting in a look at midwifery in the mid-century America. The fact that they show an actual birth was amazing no fuzzing out of anything. Very good tiime period piece.,1370476800,,196,4.628571428571429
2815418,5,B000PC6YSA,"This is a video which every health professional and policy-maker should see. How excellent health care was delivered to women in rural Georgia who had little else besides their hopes and dreams for a healthy baby. This documentary clearly shows what can be accomplished by dedicated people under often difficult circumstances, and with limited resources. We should look to our past to help us find our future.",1369699200,,409,5.119402985074627
2815419,4,B000PC6YSA,Very informative and interesting documentary of the primitive way that midwives use to have to deliver babies. Yet heart warming of those like Miss Mary who closely followed hygenic ways for safe delivery and urged all mothers to go to the Dr. early in their pregnancy. Also substituting whatever was needed when the necessary items could not be provided. A big disadvantage when there was no indoor plumbing and very little heat and unsanitary conditions. Remarkable woman and I'm sure she represented many others.,1365033600,,515,5.142857142857143
2815420,5,B000PC6YSA,I love this film.  The footage is from the time that it represents.  It is not a retrospective piece of work.  I really enjoy that aspect of the interviews and video footage.  Very realistic so you get a real feel for the culture of the times.  Highly recommended.,1363478400,,264,4.416666666666667
8190306,5,B000PC6YSA,Such a great film!,1438128000,,18,3.75
8190307,5,B000PC6YSA,"Great movie,pulls no punches,tells it like it was!",1416009600,,50,5.375
8190308,5,B000PC6YSA,"What a lovely film.  If anything, watch it for its historical value.  We really enjoyed it.  Takes you back to what maternity care used to be  like in rural America not that long ago...",1414713600,,185,4.352941176470588
8190309,5,B000PC6YSA,"What a fascinating story of a midwife who has the love and dedication to care for women beyond delivering their babies.  Mary Coley does not have a glamorous or easy life, but certainly a fulfilling life. Her story is timeless.  As she was a model for midwives of the old tradition in the 1950's, she is a model for modern day midwives. Her emphasis on cleanliness to prevent infection in the mother and baby is so important.  She is able to maintain a clean and sterile environment in some very challenging home environments.  This is a must see!",1414368000,,547,4.551020408163265
8190310,5,B000PC6YSA,So amazing! Spoiler alert!! Live birth shown in its full glory!,1410480000,,63,4.818181818181818
8190311,5,B000PC6YSA,"This is a wonderful film of the old south and the family care given by the midwives, not to mention a real  ( not cgi ) loving birth of a child.",1406332800,,144,3.6451612903225805
8190312,5,B000PC6YSA,"This is a wonderful tribute to the rural American southern mid-wives who, though often illiterate and poor themselves and working for little pay (sometimes none), brought thousands of healthy babies safely into the world.  Intended as a training film for illiterate midwives it unintentionally showcases these  amazing women who brought compassion and cleverness to their work throughout the rural south from early days up through the 1960's.  The one scene where Midwife Coley improvises a premie incubator from available materials is amazing.  It is impossible to praise too highly the work of these women but this is a good start.",1405468800,2,633,5.3
8190313,5,B000PC6YSA,"""All My Babies"" is an excellent movie on midwifery in Georgia in the 1950""s. I was surprised that there were quite a few African-American midwives. They were trained by the nurse and doctor in the ob clinic. The nurse and doctor also assisted the midwives as needed. Showed the difference in well cared for wife and one that is very poor and depressed. I thoroughly enjoyed this historical documentary.",1401148800,,402,4.840579710144928
8190314,5,B000PC6YSA,"I was amazed by this little film. In about one hour, it gives a glimpse into our recent past  with dignity and love. Midwifery is definitely a calling and Mrs Coley was the kind of caregiver any family would count on. It is really  such a snapshot of the times that we don't see- black  and white people working together for the greater good. Maybe we will all become more involved in birthing of our families!",1399334400,,410,4.368421052631579
8190315,3,B000PC6YSA,Was good.  I wish it was more on the personal life of this women.  You can tell the video definitely was controlled by the system to show them up at the time.  Was interesting enough.,1396396800,2,183,4.171428571428572
