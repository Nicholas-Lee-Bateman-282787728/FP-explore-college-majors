973053,5,6305134979,"I saw this show in person in dec of 1997. I wasn't much of a stones fan at the time, and actually went in the first place because a buddy of mine said it would be worth the drive to see the world's greatest rock and roll band.  Well, he wasn't far off, and this DVD caught it all pretty well. The colors  are bright and punchy, the camera work is exciting, and the music is great.  The only complaint I have would be that the really loud parts of the  concert tend to flinch in the mix and don't add the complete punch one  might expect when viewing it turned up. Otherwise it's great fun and  totally worth your time!",956880000,,618,4.066115702479339

I totally re-experienced the ""live concert"" in my rec-room with this  wonderful production. The flawless sound and picture quality of this  edition offers you a front seat to the best production that you will ever  see. Even if you didn't go to the Babylon Tour '98, buy this CD.

973288,5,6305134979,"I am the Stones Authority. This DVD is solid from start to finish. Well photographed and directed, and the sound is quite good too. My only complaint really is that they were not forward thinking enough to go ahead and shoot wide screen. This was a great tour too - if you happened to see them live at the time. It would be for me the smallest venue I would ever get to see the Stones, when they played two nights in Houston at the former Compaq Center - with only about 10,000 seats being sold each night. It sure beats a football stadium. They are really on for this show in St. Louis, great energy, banter, wardrobe, the small satellite stage, the whole nine. Great versions of ""Gimme Shelter"", ""Waiting On a Friend"" and ""It's Only Rock 'n' Roll"", which is pulled off down on the satellite stage. That song there makes the whole DVD worth it for me. Look, some people are not going to like this because it is no longer the Stones in their mind - post Bill Wyman. Well, fine review something that doesn't exist anymore, but I am reviewing this show, and it is very good. And if you like the Stones and you've gotten over Bill's departure then you should absolutely get this DVD.

The cameras stay on the band the whole time, unlike many current concert videos that seem to think the viewer wants to watch the audience.  The sound is CD quality, the picture and color is vivid, the editing is tight.  The highlight for me is Keith Richards' ""I Wanna Hold You"" and some incredible versions of many classics.  The songs from the Bridges to Babylon album are excellent and it is funny how quickly some of them faded from the permanent repertoire.  The fact of the matter is the Stones have enough excellent songs to do ten different concerts.

I highly recommend this DVD.  It is superior to the Four Flicks, and a lot less expensive.  Five Stars.",1162166400,7,804,4.489655172413793

They have the lovely & talented Lisa Fischer on backup vocals. She really used her ""assets talents,"" all of them. Her voice hits all of those amazing notes that few singers will ever hope aproach.

The ""really cool"" Joshua Redmond joins in with his saxophone.

Lets not forget the inovative theatrics that we've come to expect from the Stones. The never disapoint me in that area. In this film they do actually cross ""a bridge"" to Babylon.

If you love the Stones and you love seeing them live or wish you could, this is a great way to see them!

All right, I admit it. I am a huge fan, (can't fool you) since the begining. I've spent more than I'll admit this year on concert Tickets, T-Shirts and DVD/CDs. Not to mention plane tickets!",1140739200,15,852,4.435897435897436

Lisa Fischer, the awesome support singer, is in rare form as she and Mick bump and grind all over the stage. She gets in everybody's business on this one. Surprisingly, Miss You doesn't appear on Four Flicks. Neither does Its Only Rock and Roll, which is a highlight from the B-stage here. Also is a terrific Wild Horses duet with Dave Matthews and Dylan's Like a Rolling Stone-performed better here than on Stripped. Another highlight is Keith's I wanna Hold You, from Undercover. The sound is a slight step down from Four Flicks, but certainly great for when it was released.

973481,5,6305134979,"i saw the stones' bridges to babylon concert in detroit a few days before this one was taped in st. louis and this one is a carbon copy of the one i saw.
this video captures the controlled, frenzied atmosphere of the concert and really shows you what a rock concert is like from the point of view of the performers, support people and the audience.
this video has tremendous sight and  sound.  if you do not yet have surround sound and a big screen tv then this video alone is rationale enough to go out and buy that.
afer seeing this, you will feel as if you were at the stones' concert and will agree that mick, and not james brown, is the hardest working man in show business.  he was unreal and took geezer rock to new heights.
the song selection was great, with the stones playing almost all of their golden hits.  they open with ""satisfaction"" and go right into ""let's spend the night together"" and keep going from there.
the ""bridge"" -- to babylon, evidently -- was sort of gimmicky and 2001ish, but ""like a rolling stone"" done on the mini stage and ""sympathy for the devil,"" done by mick in a mandarin warlord coat, on the way back, are worth the gimmick.  mick and dylan are a good match.
the supporting backups are great, including a black female singer whose name (lisa?) escapes me but who is fantastic and dave mathews, who has a solo, and blondie chaplin, who evidently needed the work and was content to bang on a tambourine and sing harmony.  watch for keith doing a snazzy turn on the keyboard.
mick and keith are outta sight, as is ron woods, and charlie watts looks like an ad for clean living, being in great shape and wearing a golf shirt and pounding the skins all night long.
i regret that the stones did not do ""paint it black"" but you can't have everything and it gives me a reason to see them  live and in concert again.
where can you get one of those full-length leopard or cheetah coats that keith walked out in?  and who were the amply endowed twin 35ish babes in the audience, captured boogeying to brown sugar at the end?
give this video five stars and definitely add it to your concert dvd collection and take it home and start it up.",1042329600,7,2166,4.344059405940594
973482,5,6305134979,"The Rolling Stones' ""Bridges To Babylon"" world tour opened in 1997 and wound up grossing $87 million dollars, a box office record. HBO filmed several concerts, mostly in St. Louis, Missouri, and was later released as a dvd.
""Bridges To Babylon"" shows the band at their best. Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood are phenomonal guitar players here, playing some amazing solos on ""Flip The Switch"" and ""Brown Sugar"". Charlie Watts is still the quiet man in the group, but his drumming still reigns supreme. And Mick Jaggers is his effervescent self on the manic performances of ""Satisfaction"" and ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"". There are also some special appearances. Dave Matthews and Mick do a lovely duet on ""Wild Horses"", and Joshua Redman plays axophone on ""Waiting On A Friend"".
For all the highlights here, one steals the show. Their phenomonal performance of ""Gimme Shelter"" is possibly the single best live performance of their career, thanks to the stellar vocal performance by Lisa Fischer. This is a must-have disc.",1036800000,,1011,5.059880239520958

Even though Mick may be getting a little long in the tooth for rock concerts (aren't we all) and rumours have it that Keith Richards is really dead, you could see and feel that this band loves performing, and would put together a 5 hour show if they could.
The band shows up on time, (something very unusual now a days for rock star wanna be's) and rocks your socks from beginning to end, non-stop.
The DVD brought back memories of that performace and did not fall short in any respects. The video is crystal clear, sound is exact and sharp, and the editing absolutely fabulous. The director seemed to know where one would be looking during the concert and it made me feel as if I was back there again.... some of the editors of concert videos that I have seen had no clue as to where and when to focus attention during the concert .....
Although I would give 'Voodoo Lounge' concert DVD a slight edge, (I mean a very very slight edge) over Babylon, trust me, this is a must have DVD that will, like Voodoo, go out of print and you'll be buying the DVD for 50.00 bucks just to have it in your collection......",1011657600,62,1351,4.386454183266932
973484,5,6305134979,I loved it.. It brings back memories from seeing the stones do Bridges at soldiers field in chicago.  I have tried many ways to listen to the old stones tunes and they just do not sound right but now I have hit a gold mine.  I purchased this used and it was fine.,1011052800,,263,3.943396226415094
973485,5,6305134979,"They may all be past their prime, and certainly aren't in their prime. However the Stones sure know how to burn up a stage.
There is no weak or sub-par moments in this performance. The Stones rock through electrifying renditions of all their classics; from I Can't Get No Satisfaction to Tumbling Dice to Start Me Up to Out of Control. The show is just as magnificent, complete with light shows, a huge TV screen, a bridge upon which the Stones walk over the audience to another stage in the middle of the audience, and Mick Jagger proving he can still be a magnificent performer.
Even in their 50-some odds the Stones know how to rock. And when it comes to rocking live they are a whole lot better than most of today's acts. So if you want to hear and watch a great live show from the Greatest Rock 'N' Roll Band in the World Bridges to Babylon is a DVD that you can't live without!",1008115200,2,883,4.293413173652695
973486,5,6305134979,"The Rolling Stones, thirty years after their prime, are still the best live act in the world, bar none.  This concert, which was originally telecast as a pay-per-view concert in December 1997, is indisputable proof.  They still have their edge, they still give it everything they've got in live performance, and their sell-out concerts are proof of it.  All music acts should look at this concert to see how hard work, huge talent, and impeccable professionalism is done.  The Rolling Stones are the masters of live performance.
I spent the twenty dollars it cost for the pay-per-view telecast and even taped it over the air.  I have seen it at least 60 times and still love it.  What struck me is, despite his age, Mick Jagger still has tremendous energy to play so well in front of an audience (and this concert was late in the evening, finishing after midnight). It takes a great deal of energy to be able to go back and forth on a stage about the size of a football field and under those hot lights. Not only that but he looked the best he ever looked in his life.  About 25 pounds heavier than in his youth, Jagger was filled out, and, for being a member of a band not known for pulchritude, actually looked almost attractive.  The rest of the band was in fine form, too, and contrary to some reviews, Keith Richards does not looked bored here.  He was very much animated and seemed to enjoy himself.
The concert consists of a mix of both old hits and more recent songs, with three of the original concert tunes cut out of the DVD version (""Corinna,"" with Taj Mahal--not a high point of the show; one of Keith Richards' songs; and ""The Last Time,"" which should probably be the last time for this tune as Jagger and company can no longer hit the notes).  What remains is still great, with the second half of the concert being slightly better than the first half.  Highlights include ""Saint of Me,"" ""Gimme Shelter,"" ""Honky Tonk Women,"" ""Jumping Jack Flash,"" ""Start Me Up,"" ""You Can't Always Get What You Want,"" and a rousing finish in ""Brown Sugar.""  Personal favorites of mine include Keith Richards' ""I Wanna Hold You,"" featuring Keith duelling guitars with the underrated Ron Wood (in super form here), and an absolute killer version of Bob Dylan's ""Like a Rolling Stone"" performed during the small stage sequence.
There is only one complaint I have about this disk which others have said elsewhere, and that's the sound quality.  Where in the world were the microphones set up for the soundtrack?  It sounds as if it had been recorded clear in the back of the building.  Jagger and his backup singers sound like they are in a cave.  The sounds of the audience should have been muted by having the mikes put in an appropriate place.  I still have my tape of the original pay-per-view telecast, and the sound quality on that is perfect with NO distortion.  I strongly recommend the makers of this DVD get hold of the original soundtrack from the pay-per-view telecast and replace this dreadful one.",1002585600,12,3003,4.612781954887218
973487,3,6305134979,"The Stones put on a great show and it's captured beautifully on video but this DVD is lacking in a few things that would have really made it special.  First of all, why no DTS sound?  If you're not sure what this can add to a concert video, watch the DTS version of The Eagles ""When Hell Freezes Over"" and compare it with this or another non-DTS DVD (provided your player supports DTS).
The other minor complaint is there are no bonus features (ie. interviews, backstage scenes, music videos, etc) that would have added greatly to the live performance.  It's as though the makers of this DVD did not realize the potential of the format they were using.  A few little additions would have made this one of the all-time greats.  I'd still recommend this DVD to any Stones fan because it's wonderful to see Mick, Keith and the boys in this format and the concert itself is a fantastic performance.  I just hope the next time they release a DVD, it has more bells and whistles.",990403200,22,973,4.468926553672317
973560,5,6305134979,"I first bought the VHS of this tour, right when it came out and already enjoyed it although the sound quality in some parts left room for improvement. Well, the DVD version is awesome. The camera work is consistently great, the sound quality is as good as on the Stones IMAX movie (also highly recommended) and overall the guys show that they still have the right stuff. The movie also highlights and gives credit to their excellent additional stage musicians and singers, most of all the fabulous Lisa Fisher who does the female vocals on ""Gimme Shelter"", definitely one of the absolute highlights of this concert. This was the first tour where the Stones used the smaller second stage to showcase some of their old R&B tunes, and one could have had a bit more of that, but then again: choices and cuts have to be made from a stage show that is usually well over two hours long and the selection is overall pretty satisfying, a good balance of new stuff from the ""Bridges to Baylon"" album and old favorites.",980035200,6,1008,4.574585635359116
973561,5,6305134979,"Seeing Mick come out for the encore in shades belting out Jumpin Jack Flach with more energy than Pearl Jam on their best night was the coolest thing I've seen in years.  I was a little disappointed he didn't go up in the crane like in ""Let's Spend the Night Together.""  But walking across the crowd on a glass bridge was neat.
These guys define rock and roll and all other bands follow.  Jagger is the coolest man to ever live.",976060800,7,428,4.2592592592592595
973562,4,6305134979,"Bridges is a very entertaining DVD for any Stones fan.  A huge stage, plus a secondary stage and an energetic Mick make for a fun time.  The live show includes a special appearance by Dave Matthews in a duet with Jagger during ""Wild Horses"". There is also an appearance by jazz great Josh Redman during ""Waiting on a Friend"".  The DVD exhibits quality engineering and is closed-captioned, recorded in 2 channel stereo and Dolby 5.1 - making good use of rear channels.  No other special features are added, which is a little disappointing, but nonetheless a definite plus to any DVD music collection.  Recommended.",971136000,2,613,4.855769230769231

Jagger, Richards, Wood and Watts seem to be ageing like a bottle of good wine.  If this is what it's like to be a pensioner then I am looking forward to it.  Superb, powerful, entertaining and a good lesson to a lot of ""young bands"".  You need to work hard and love your music to be this good.  Nick",969840000,3,474,4.0

973568,3,6305134979,"I'm a huge Stones fan, but maybe it's because I don't have the Dolby Digital setup yet, but I found the atmosphere as described by others to be somewhat lacking on this DVD. It's often hard to make out the crowd noises  which usually add so much to the atmosphere of a live concert. The sound  track serves to highlight Jagger's not so great performance.
It was also  fairly shocking to see how old Mick Jagger and Keith Richards look. Keith  appears somewhat lacklustre, wandering about the stage as if he's just  going through the motions. He looks positively bored in places.
Once I  have the proper sound setup, I may re-evaluate this, but my recommendation  would be, if you don't have a good sound setup, give this a miss and buy  the studio recorded album of the same title. It's much better. (Of course,  you only get the new tracks, but you have the older ones already, don't  you?)",959904000,3,891,4.5125
973569,4,6305134979,"Given the enormous size of the stage and the difficulty in capturing a live Stones concert on film, this DVD does a respectable job of bringing the excitement to the living room.  The camera work is impressive  throughout, capturing close-ups of Keith's subtle facial expressions and  Mick's spastic moves.
Highlights include ""Gimme Shelter,""  featuring a phenomenal back-up singer going toe-to-toe with Mick,  ""Sympathy For The Devil,"" when the stage is bathed in a eerie red  light, and ""Like A Rolling Stone"" on the smaller center  stage.
A few minor complaints:  I wish they had included more songs from  the smaller, more intimate stage.  When I saw them on this tour, they did a  fantastic version of ""Little Red Rooster,"" which I wish were  included.  Also, while it was fun to see Dave Matthews and Mick singing  ""Wild Horses"" together, it was pretty static.  I think they could  have done much more.  Basically, it's just Dave and Mick standing there  trading verses.  I would have loved to see Dave join them on ""Honky  Tonk Woman"" or ""Brown Sugar.""  Lastly, I wish there were  more extras on the DVD.  There are no interviews, no special footage, no  nothing.  Just the concert.  Seems like they didn't take advantage of all  of the benefits of the DVD format.
Still, these are relatively minor  complaints that don't overshadow a great concert.  If you are even slightly  a Stones fan, you will enjoy this DVD a great deal.",958089600,6,1435,4.809917355371901

The vocals are horrible, Jagger's moves are robotic, the band members look more ridiculous then circus clowns and even the guitar work is pathetic.  These guys have been stuck in a bubble for too long.  This is from 1997, so that means they were about 25 years past their glory days when this was filmed.  It amazes me that a band can coast that long on the fumes of their past success.  There are much better Stones' concerts available so do yourself a favor and skip this.
