5926862,2,B00EKS34CY,"I'd like to echo the sentiment of others on the DVD release of this marvelous series.  This is getting completely out of hand regarding dropping episodes and editing music etc.  If they want to sell these as complete seasons or series they should at least match the original broadcast.  The series makes no sense otherwise.  At least this series was good enough that one can watch the available episodes, but not for continuity.  The show was great the episodes are great,  but if you want to own the series forget it and chalk one up for the lawyers that now dictate what we can watch.  I would be willing to pay extra if the series was intact including original music.",1447977600,6,670,4.533333333333333
