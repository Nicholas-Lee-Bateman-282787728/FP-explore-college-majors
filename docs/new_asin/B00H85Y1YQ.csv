I bought this one because it gives God the glory for His creation. My kids love it, so does Mommy.  I just ordered the butterfly and bird DVD's for my older kids. Can't wait for them to get here.",1425772800,,314,4.288135593220339

My youngest jumps, claps and squeals when it starts playing. He has already started saying some of the words and signing.  My oldest son and I were playing in the dirt when he said ""Mommy, God mad this dirt and it good"", which lead us into a natural and relaxed conversation about God and why God wants us to be good. Both boys are so curious about the Lord and this is the perfect way to engage and teach them at the same time. As a parent, I fell in love with this DVD too, it teaches so much at one time without being overwhelming, over stimulating or obnoxious like so many other children's DVD. I don't mind this playing in the background at all, especially since I am able to enjoy all my favorite hymns. I promise you will not be disappointed!",1407369600,3,872,4.190476190476191
8630760,5,B00H85Y1YQ,"Once upon a time, I moved to North Carolina because I wanted to attend college to study Deaf Education. I wanted to teach elementary aged deaf students. I began learning American Sign Language in high school.  We were required to take two foreign languages and ASL was one of the options available.  The teacher was a deaf woman who allowed an interpreter in the classroom for the first month and then we were expected to learn by total immersion.  It was fantastic.  I fell in love with it all.

I had dreams of teaching and maybe even interpreting at some point, but life had other plans. It's been several years since I've regularly used ASL so I've grown a little rusty, but I do teach my children from a young age basic signs before they can speak to help encourage communication.  Recently, my oldest daughter (age 8) has expressed interest in learning more, so I dusted off my notes from high school and college and started teaching her a few signs.

We have utilized other sign language videos, but I'm always on the lookout for more resources to help me dust off my skills and pass on my knowledge to my daughter. I was excited to receive the chance to review For His Own Glory! Barnyard Collection from Crowe's Nest Media, a new 40 minute DVD designed to teach young children basic farm animal signs.

Bright, cheerful imagery accompanied by live action shots of real farm animals capture the attention.  Fellow children help teach the motions of each sign. In the background, you will hear familiar Christian hymns and inspirational music such as Joyful, Joyful We Adore Thee.  The best aspect is that throughout the video, glory is given to the Lord for His creation.

Children will learn signs for:

  horse
  cow
  pig
  rabbit
  donkey
  rooster
  cat
  goat
  dog
  duck
  chicken
  sheep

I love that this is not only exposing children to another language, but also teaching them to praise God for everything! Teaching thankfulness at a young age is a great goal to have as a parent.  We are all dependent on the Lord and without Him, we'd be living purposeless lives.

This playful and vibrant video serves as a fantastic introduction to some basic ASL signs while also encouraging children to honor God. Crowe's Nest Media is a family ministry that creates, edits, narrates, and animates all of their our videos and they have done a fantastic job with this one.",1397606400,3,2380,4.670702179176756
8630761,5,B00H85Y1YQ,I have a special place in my heart for sign language. I have 3 children and we want to learn it as a family but with this DVD my 3 year old learns it as well and in a fun way with God honoring songs. I would recommend this DVD over and over.,1397174400,2,241,3.5660377358490565
8630762,5,B00H85Y1YQ,"My one year old and four year old are so excited about this DVD! I love the sign language, the God-honoring songs, the engaging footage of the animals, and the fun finger puppets. This DVD even includes early counting and spelling skills! So fun!",1396828800,3,246,4.613636363636363
