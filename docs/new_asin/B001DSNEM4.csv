3538844,5,B001DSNEM4,"I purchased this box set ignoring the warnings of how these discs were being shipped, ie. stacked on top of each other with no protection between to prevent scratches and nicks? I thought for sure that had to be a mistake... but it was true! All 12 of these discs came just that way... but to my surprise and delight, not one episode was pixilated or stuck or frozen during play! Not one! They all played just fine and I was laughing so hard. I'd forgotten just how incredibly funny this series was, despite the foolishness of Andy Dick. Phil Hartman, Dave Foley and Stephen Root were priceless. Vicky Lewis and Joe Rogan were allowed to grow into their parts and amply filled the absence of Hartman following his untimely death. And they were of course joined in that effort by Saturday Night alumnis, Jon Lovitz.  This show was a truly irreverant piece of work... a true gem! - and to protect them I replaced their packaging with a couple of 6-disc cases... which I also recommend to protect this series!",1228262400,7,1006,4.558011049723757
3538845,1,B001DSNEM4,"This is a review of the packaging, not the series.  The entertainment industry weenies continue to see how little value they can give you for the highest possible price.  Unfortunately, packaging is the one (the others are double sided disks that get scratched no matter how carful you are and compressing the show, to squeeze more on each disk, reducing the quality).  This time they hit a new... all time low!  When you open the box you will find a paper thin plastic ""space filler"" shrink wrapped (so thin, the wrap bends it all out of shape) with a piece of cardboard on a spindle.  Pry the cardboard up and you will find all 12 disks stacked on top of each other.  That's it.  I really can't explain how cheap this was done.  I've thrown away packing materials that were far superior.  I'm sure they would respond that "" they want to keep the price down so we can afford to buy it"".  Since I can buy a thin jewel case retail for about 10 cents, we are talking pennies at the manufacturing level...not wholesale - that cost could realistic be 1 cent.  I'd pay 12 cents more to protect my $47 investment.

Bottom line, good series, but if you buy this be prepared to provide your own cases to protect the dvds.",1227830400,180,1213,4.390134529147982
3538846,3,B001DSNEM4,"I loved newsradio and was over joyed to see a complete set was being produced. Now however, I wish I had collected newsradio season by season as I did with M*A*S*H and other great shows. The all in one package basically took all the disks from the five season packages and put them in a stack, one on top of the other, without so much as a piece of film between them. I was forced to acquire a CD book to hold the disc to make them easier to access and prevent scratching. I would suggest you be prepared to do like wise.
 There is also no guide book only an episode list on the box. Even for someone like myself who knows all of episodes by heart this is a problem. I know the episodes as the Lisa-Dave brake up episode, or the bill shocks himself episode not ""Led Zeppelin II"". Someone who has only seen each episode a few times will probable be completely lost.
 Do yourself a favor, buy each seasons individually. The price is about the same (if you don't buy the fifth season and who needs it. I mean we all know the show was not the same after Phil Hartman died.) and you will get better cases, better guides and great show. Who could ask for more.",1225411200,202,1154,4.170403587443946
3538847,5,B001DSNEM4,"As any actor will tell you, comedy is not easy. And comedy shows in particular are not easily made nor do they stand the test of time. Many shows that were benchmarks in their day do not hold up well years later. Then there are the jewels that DO stand up with repeated viewings at a later date. Such can be said of NEWSRADIO.

The show only aired for 4 years and yet it had some of the funniest scenes ever committed to video tape. It covered some topical issues but not to the point of preaching and not to the point where the discussions aren't relevant today. But best of all was that this was an ensemble cast that worked.

I've often said that ensemble casting in television shows is the way to go. With a wide ranging casts the hopes and dreams of the show aren't placed on the shoulders of just one person, the make or break burden that leads to celebrity meltdown. A great ensemble casts spreads the jokes around, makes everyone a part of the plan and offers some of the best comedy and acting there is. Such was the case with NEWSRADIO.

The story revolved around the new station manager, Dave Nelson (Dave Foley), just in from the Midwest and now the manager of WNYX, an all news station in New York. Where one would expect the show to adopt the fish out of water aspect, it never happens. Instead we have a fresh take on the country bumpkin going to New York. He isn't a bumpkin at all! He's pleasant, affable and tries to rope in the staff and anchors that work at his station. And he does so well considering who that is. Foley does an upstanding job as Dave, making him appear nave and yet capable of handing himself.

Stephen Root stars as station owner Jimmy James. What an incredible character this is. And I think that this was/is the best part that Root has ever played. Jimmy is incredibly wealthy and yet never seems snobby. Jimmy can buy and sell as he pleases, yet holds on to this station. Jimmy often times seems incredibly stupid and simple, yet beneath it all he knows more than anyone in the building. To portray this person and do make it work shows some fantastic acting chops.

Maura Tierney is Lisa Miller, the top news writer and all around station fixture who takes care of everything. Her belief was that she would get the job now handed to Dave. The two face off immediately with malice in her eyes. So what's next? They jump into bed together and become a secret item in the office.

Vicki Lewis is Beth, the all knowing, all seeing, all commenting smart alek of an employee who knows the dirt on everyone. She's the one who offers the quickest of quips when things happen and stirs the pot when she can.

Joe Rogan is Joe Garello, the handy man in the office. Mr. Fixit can whip up a computer, fix the station's microphones or create an exploding block of cheese in an attempt to discover who is stealing food from the fridge (one of my favorite moments). Here again we have someone who appears simple minded yet knows all the tech that runs the station.

Of the cast here Khandi Alexander seems to be the least used. But when she is the biting criticism of her character, the standoffishness of her aloof Catherine Duke, news anchor, is such that she still seems approachable. Her remarks to co-anchor Bill McNeal offer the counterpoint to his sarcasm. She goes toe to toe with him and stands her ground.

Matthew Brock. This character is perhaps the only funny thing that comedian/actor Andy Dick has ever done. Since the show I've not seen him be funny once. But here, he drew viewers towards him every time he stepped into a scene. He was the goof, the oddball, the nerd and he did it well. Not only did he play the character that way but he had a puppy dog attitude that made you feel for him while laughing at his antics.

Best for last. Phil Hartman as Bill McNeal. When you watch this DVD, you can't help but feel a certain amount of sadness knowing that Hartman is gone. While he was amazing on SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE, he truly shines here. Hartman doesn't take center stage all the time, rather sharing the limelight with every other cast member. But when he's there you can't help but be amazed at how natural everything he does seems. His character is filled with egotistical mania, considering himself to be the best that there is in this station. And at the same time he does some of the most ridiculous stuff or misquotes famous lines. It is Hartman and not McNeal that makes for one of the most interesting members of the cast.

So now you have the cast. How does that make a show? Simple, they all work well together. Each one plays off of the other, none of them stepping on the toes of the next cast member. While watching you never feel like one member or another is the centerpiece of the show. Each has their own moment in the spotlight. This is what makes great ensemble acting.

The stories range from the simple (Dave having to fire the man he is replacing) to the ridiculous (the staff setting off rat traps because they have adopted the rat in the room). Certain episodes make the serious funny like the attempts of Bill McNeal to stop smoking that starts with him simply ignoring the no smoking rule.

So we have a great cast, great stories and great directing. Is there anything at all wrong with this series? Once I find it I'll let you know. As for now the chance to own the complete series in one box for a more affordable price than buying them separately is enough to make you whip open your wallet. This is one that is worth having on your shelf. I doubt there would be a time (with the exception of a loved one dying) that you couldn't pop in a disc from this set and find yourself laughing. In today's serious world, that alone makes it worth the money invested.",1225152000,11,5735,4.388888888888889
3538848,5,B001DSNEM4,"I am highly looking forward to the release of this product. Phil Hartman, Andy Dick, Stephen Root and Dave Foley all do excellent acts of genuine comedy.

 This show is hilarious with episodes with a pet office rat, crazy boss to fly in balloon, office co-workers quite their additive habits, nightmare day dreams and of course the last episodes of the fourth season which is Phil last episodes: the Titanic parody.

 Be prepared to watch a show unlike anything feeling a show brings and never will again. (I just wish the can get rid of that stupid ""laugh track"")",1223424000,,564,4.666666666666667
3538849,5,B001DSNEM4,"It's about time!

I've been waiting for the complete series to be released for years now. I started watching this show when I was around 9 or 10, even that young I found the show to be funny, even if I didn't understand all of the jokes yet.

13 years later, Newsradio still remains my favorite TV show of all time. The acting is superb, the cast gets along perfectly - they really had a great chemistry together, and the writing is hilarious and clever.

Newsradio is a funny, charasmatic, and laugh out loud funny TV show that will remain popular for years to come. Hopefully, one day we will see a reunion!",1222128000,3,609,4.371681415929204

This is not a complete series, and I would not recommend for others to buy it.  I wish I would have read more closely, so I leave this review for others in hopes they see that this series is incomplete and can avoid my mistake.

That said, the show itself was excellent.  I would just probably find a different offering if you are after the 'complete' series.  This is not it.",1516492800,3,610,4.410714285714286

3538885,3,B001DSNEM4,"FYI the NewsRadio complete series set DVD with the lightning bolts around Dave Foleys head does not contain any of the extras that were included on the previously offered complete series set, which imported the extras from the individual season DVD's, and it's packaging is the cheapest concept I've ever came across, flimsy cardboard sleeves.
as for the show itself, it was one of my personal favorites, quirky and sometimes outlandish story lines, perfect cast of characters, sadly the fifth and final season suffers due to the loss of the real deal Bill McNeal played by Phil Hartman, I for one couldn't accept Jon Lovitz as his replacement,  beside Lovitz had already appeared as two other characters on previous NewsRadio episodes, the original cast had great chemistry, Lovitz character seemed out of place and a poor fit.",1516060800,,828,5.043795620437956

Spoiler alert, sort of: Bill Moves On episode will hit hard after these people become like family to you.  Can't imagine a better cast for this show.  Stephen Root is fantastic, Dave Foley's dry comedy timing is pitch-perfect.  No one but Phil Hartman could imbue ""Bill McNeil"" with such bathos and humanity.

Seasons 1, 2, and 3 and 4 get four stars from me, but season 5 was just an abomination. Not even being hyperbolic here: Season 5 deserves zero stars. It's that bad. And not just because Phil Hartman died. The episodes are not funny, and the Dave/Lisa romance (which I felt was the heart of the show), goes down the drain in favor of worst on-screen romance I've ever seen on a TV show- Lisa and Johnny.

Yes, I tried it on 480p DVD player and it didn't look much better.

The reason I bring this up, despite this being a good show with quality acting and writing, the image quality of the DVD becomes distracting, regardless of the quality of the episode. So much so, I couldn't any further than mid-season four. I tried hanging in there a bit longer because of how entertaining I found the show, I just couldn't.",1462060800,,760,4.352112676056338

My personal favorite episode actually comes early in Season 1 in which Bill and Dave attempt to quit their respective addictions.

3539087,5,B001DSNEM4,"Once in a while, a TV series will catch lightning in a bottle, with an interesting premise, intelligent writing, and a stellar cast. ""NewsRadio"" was one of those series.  Dave Foley starred as Dave Nelson, radio station WNYX's level-headed news director.  The late Phil Hartman was egotistical Bill McNeal, the on-air news co-anchor.  Phil played the part to perfection.  His death after the fourth season was addressed in season five's first episode, ""Bill Moves On.""  It was one of the most moving, heartfelt, and funny episodes of any TV series.  Jon Lovitz played the on-air news anchor Max Louis, who took over for the part played by the irreplaceable Phil Hartman, in season five.  Stephen Root played Jimmy James, the station's eccentric, multi-billionaire owner, who inexplicably spent most of his time at the radio station.  Andy Dick played office oddball Matthew Brock, a news reporter who rarely did any news reporting.  Maura Tierney played Lisa Miller, a reporter, on-air personality, and producer.  For several episodes, she even replaced Dave as news director.  Vicki Lewis played Beth (no last name), Dave's secretary, who wore inappropriate outfits to work, and whose main job seemed to be making coffee.  Joe Rogan played Joe Garrelli, the radio station's electrician and handyman. He preferred to make his own gadgets, and even made duct tape.  Khandi Alexander played Catherine Duke, an on-air news co-anchor who left during the fourth season.  She did return to appear in season five's first episode, ""Bill Moves On.""

One of my favorite episodes is ""Space,"" the last episode in season three.  The WNYX radio station is in a spaceship hurtling through outer space, boldly going where no radio station has gone before.  Another of my favorite episodes is ""Sinking Ship,"" the last episode in season four.  It's a spoof of the movie ""Titanic,"" in which the radio station appears to be a ship hurtling through the ocean that hits an iceberg, with disastrous results.  Sadly, it was the last episode to include Phil Hartman.  Bonus features include cast commentaries and gag reels.  The fold-out box includes a plastic container with a plastic spindle, with the twelve discs piled one on top of the other, without any protection. I'm happy to report that none of the discs I played were scratched or defective in any way. In addition, the audio and video qualities of the episodes were very good. For the bargain price it's selling for, I definitely recommend buying the complete series box set of ""NewsRadio.""",1446422400,2,2527,5.040963855421687

*No spindle packaging like the last Complete Series set. The packaging is actually quite simple. 1 case with 9 discs protected by 9 envelopes.

*The picture is what I'd call an ""honest"" transfer. It looks great but has the occasional grain to it. This is just the reality of watching things that were actually filmed on film. Nothing to be done about it but enjoy what you've got.

*No special features. This is actually a deal breaker for me as I already own the individual seasons (I was hoping to consolidate space) and know how much I enjoy those extras. If this isn't a problem for you, then by all means, buy away. Personally, I'll be holding onto my old copies and trading this new set in.

If you're new to the franchise, this will do just fine. But it's not an upgrade for old fans who already own the series. Hope this helps anybody on the fence.",1433030400,39,1236,4.554054054054054

3539162,4,B001DSNEM4,"A great series in a funky package, as many reviewers have already said. I moved all the disks to a CD wallet. I too can't help but think that the lower price vs. buying all of them separately could have been made possible without the ""stack-o-disks"" packaging. Not only are they in a pile in the box on a spindle, but the spindle is tall enough to allow them to flop around inside. It's like they brainstormed ways to make sure the disks would be damaged in transit. However, I'm still working my way thru the series, so I can't know yet if there has been damage--so far so good.
One quibble- the disks have various headshots of the cast members on them, and none of them depict the GREAT Stephen Root. And Andy Dick is there at least twice! No justice in the world.
Update 12/3/13: No problem with playback on any of the disks. But I haven't watched all of the bonus material.

3539173,4,B001DSNEM4,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she was absolutely thrilled with it - except for the extremely poor packaging. Once the plastic wrapping was removed from the case, you could see where it had been banged around quite a bit and large parts of the silver/black package were white from being rubbed or ripped. Inside all of the DVDs are packed on top of each other in a flimsy plastic container (which was crushed down in the center) and are held in place with a piece of cardboard.

Aside from the packaging, everything else was great. She has already watched all of the episodes and enjoyed them immensely (she had no problems with any of the disks being damaged in any way), and simply bought a small CD/DVD case to store the disks in a more convenient way. This is still a great set to own (the price can't be beat for the complete series) and I would absolutely recommend it to old and new fans a like - just be aware of the packaging problem and decide if you're okay with it or not before ordering.",1357776000,,1017,4.352631578947369
3539174,5,B001DSNEM4,"Since the reviewers generally seem to agree the show is terrific, I won't address that here. I will add my two cents to the whole packaging debate. The first TV series released on DVDs were events. The packaging was huge, featuring full-color pull-out booklets with photos, reviews, interviews, etc. The DVDs played minutes-long introductions with theme music and highlight clips. The extras were extensive, with commentaries, making-of videos and deleted scenes. Those were great, but in general so 10-years-ago!

Today's media companies know you are downloading their content. Some are doing it legally, while many are not. While some companies try to sue their customer base out of existence, others are apparently taking us at our word when we opine: ""I wouldn't torrent these files if they made them available at a reasonable price.""

These discs are definitely made by and for today's peer-to-peer crowd. I've spent a fair amount of time in foreign countries where the US copyright law is less respected, and these discs look like they came right from one of the counterfeit markets I remember. Not the high-quality, hard to tell copies from Asia; these are the made-at-home DVDs you find in the Middle East and South America.

The first two seasons are packaged on three discs with zero frills. There's no introduction screen, no play all feature, no episode description, not even a distinction between seasons 1 and 2. There's simply a 1-28 list of episode names with poor-quality still photos taken from random places in the episode. Inexplicably, S03E25 ""The Injury"" is added to the last disc of ""Seasons 1 & 2.""

Season 3 adds some ""special"" features such as the ability to play all episodes and commentaries, but not all of the episodes even have commentary tracks on them. About half of the episodes have just one audio track which means a commentary track wasn't added. Maybe they tried to save money by paying the actors to comment on every other episode--who knows?

Despite all this, don't get the idea that I look down on the packaging or the DVD features. There was a time I paid a large sum of money for the fluff (West Wing, Sopranos, I'm looking at you!), but now I ""Fair Use"" all of my purchased media directly to a NAS while the originals are packed away and safe from my children's hands. These discs are perfectly priced to transfer the media from Amazon to my house to my media server with as little fuss as possible.

If you're looking for more than this, maybe you can convince the living members of the cast to get back together and film some specials. Clearly there's a market for that. They can throw in some color photos so that you have a booklet advertising the set you already bought.

If you're fine with low-cost, no-frills, pop-in-the-dvd-and-watch, this is absolutely the best way to get NewsRadio back on your TV set. Enjoy!",1354147200,4,2865,4.822810590631365
3539175,5,B001DSNEM4,"This set is well worth the price. News Radio may just be the most underrated sitcom of all time. It certainly has one of the best ensembles. Of course, Phil Hartman is outrageously funny, but special mention should be made of Stephen Root and Dave Foley. Stephen Root is a wonderful character actor that has such a comedic and endearing way of delivering a line, that the audience can't help but love the eccentric owner of the station. And Dave Foley, as the news director, is really the anchor of the show, often playing the straight man to the chaos around him. Don't equate the straight man (of which I think he's one of the best, right up there with Bob Newhart, IMO)to an absence of humor. Quite the contrary. Dave's reactions, one-liners, and dry, sarcastic quick wit have given me some of the biggest laughs. KITH fans will be familiar with the humor I'm describing. As far as packaging, I wish it was a bit sturdier, but the discs were in excellent condition. It's nice that it doesn't take up a lot of space, and really it's not that inconvenient to switch out the discs on the spindle.

3539194,4,B001DSNEM4,"Paul Simms created a TV Series that (sadly)lasted only 97 episodes. The indisytry requirement for syndication is 100 episodes. This show is called ""News Radio"" and it makes ""WKRP"" look like ""My Mother The Car."" To begin with we have an ensemble cast that rivals any of the legendary casts in history (including ""Friends"", ""The West Wing"" and ""Will & Grace"") with outrageously funny writing that bordered on the insane from time to time- as did the characters themselves- and a set as brilliantly designed as ""Cheers"". There are episodes of this series that rival ""Chukles Boites The Dust"" as funniest epsiodes in history (Matthew Brock and his hysterical mispronounciation of Joey Buttafuco on the air; Jimmy James' heart attack, The Jumper,) It's almost a Bob Newhart style, where a rational and normal man is set into a group of luhnatics and expected to lead them.

Two things occured to this show that held it back. The first was the untimely murder of one of it's stars, Phil Hartman and though they replaced him with Jon Lovgtiz, one of the fiunniest men in America, no one really fell into a pattern of how to write for him- his strengths weren;t utilized and where he was Hartman's best friend it's possible that the chemistry could never have worked anyway. The second was the Network who kept throwing in stupid tested elements, forcing 434 productions to do things to placate the American audience, thinking they would please as many as possible and subsequently dissapointing all. In Season 5 we had the addition of Future ""gilmour Girls"" star, ANdrea Plan B who dominated an Arc that caused me to stop watching the series while it aired. Then the addition of a tall handsome wino to whom Lisa got married pushed us away from the characters we'd grown to love and into worlds with characters we simply didn't like. For this, ther show loses a star.

Despite this, it's well worth buyingthe series and watching the first four seaqsons over and over and over. Enjpoy Viki Lawrence- a remarkable talent, and Phil Hartmen, who is a lovable cipher, Steven Root and his remarkable comic timing, Then there is Andy Dick who is a blend of Andy Kaufman and David Schwimmer; his willingness to do anything to make us laugh and his knack for physical comedy. Joe Rogan, who would become famous for feeding goat entrails to idiot Americans on ""Fear Factor"" is an actor and comdeian of such brilliance that his chemistry with Andy Dick on this show was worthy of ruminating over possible ways to pair the two if not in ""The Odd Couple"" on Broadway, then some sit-com. one would never guess that the beef-cake brilliant actor Rogan and the skinmny, long fingerer Dick could have a Tracy/Hepburn or Newman/Redford chemistry, but they do.

The show is full of mistakes, but it's a rare series that isn;t and watching a series upwards of ten times gives a critic the opportunity to do something no one of the production team could do: How many siblings did Matthew have? How many birthdays each year did Catherine Duke have? (It's like Helen CHappel's sister, ""Wings"", Lorraine who is then brought onto the series full time in season six and her name is Casey and came from San Francisco, not Maui.)

There are many inside jokes with this show that must have begun withg the production team (certainly I'm not the only one who wished they would fired their cosume designer) but it became clear that our writers either epent a lot of time drinking or a lot of time discussing ""Firefly"" while playing Video Games. I'd guess that the writers room had no living plants and the coats stretched across chairs were denim or polar fleece and not Burberry, but these guys were brave and brilliant.

So I place this one in the top ten of all time simply because half the erpisodes are brilliant. Some of the episodes were phones in, but they handled the motion picture schedules of Hollywoods finer actors, the murder of one of their best actors and a network who was fighting to learn that there IS no formula to creating and producing a hit sit-com; like all art, it is a miracle and it doesn';t always have to do with quality. This is why ALF was a hit and Stiudio 60 lasted only 24 episodes. George's Seurat never sold a painting in his lifetime and Norman Rockwell died a millionaire.

As for the manty typos here I apologize: I suffer from a severe pns neuromuscular illness and to take the time to correct the errors would delay this review further- a review I've been meaning to write for more than a year.

3539195,5,B001DSNEM4,"This is an absolute steal!  $20-30 bucks for the entire News Radio series?  The best comedy sitcom ever!?!  You can't go wrong here.

The series revolves around straight man Dave Nelson (played with put-upon determination by Kid's In the Hall actor Dave Foley), who is only an odd-duck himself in that he can tolerate a cast of fellow odd-ducks without having a nervous breakdown, managing a disparate cast of characters at a radio news station.  Among the comedy gold stands out Phil Hartman playing pompous and argumentative Bill McNeal through the first four seasons.  One of my favorite moments from this show was when Dave, who is trying to uphold the no-smoking ban in the office much to Bill's chagrin, challenges Bill to avoid smoking and throws in with him by himself giving up coffee.  Both men, straining to maintain a semblance of non-addiction professionalism, break down and vocally rip Matthew's character (played by Andy Dick who may not be likable in anything else he's ever done or as a human being) to shreds in a fit of addict-starved hostility.  The way they played off of each other is something that you hardly ever see anymore.  The other office oddballs are Joe (played by Fear Factor's own host, Joe Rogan), the handyman/ conspiracy theorist/ male man-child who can fix anything but you better not be around when it breaks; Jimmy James, the station's eccentric rich billionaire owner, who writes his own rules just so he can rule his own writings; Beth, the plucky do-nothing office assistant who never met a peacock dress that she didn't like; Catherine Duke (played by the lovely Khandi Alexander) who was essentially the competitive foil for Phil Hartman's character; the I-don't-know-what-I'm-doing Matthew who is dumber than a box of chocolates and is always in jeopardy of losing his job...or some body part (except for in the episode where he becomes ""SMatthew"", a.k.a. ""Smart Matthew"", when his boss Dave wants to keep him on staff); and Lisa Miller (played by E.R.'s Maura Tierney), the lioness who is who is Dave's intellectual equal and competitor as well as his lover.

The writers of this series deftly weave and connect 2-3 story threads in each episode a la later seasons of Seinfeld.  Each of the character's are sympathetically portrayed and played and this group of actors worked extremely well with and off of each other.  There were almost always several laugh-out-loud moments in each episode and you frequently did not know what was going to happen next (Jimmy James falls out a window when the stock market drops--only to see a moment later that that is what he was fantasizing about and considering; Bill McNeal biting into a sandwich and hearing that sandwich crunch like a bag of chips!).  There was a lot of physical humor in this series, often revolving around sight gags and Matthew's prone-to-fall character.  There was a lot of relational and situational humor and all of it was handled and blended very well.  The show took risks also in parodying other popular zeitgeists, like ""Titanic"", or in saying good-bye to important characters while simultaneously tugging at our heart and tapping our funny bone.  My wife and I literally cried when they said ""good-bye"" to Bill McNeal.  Unfortunately for us we lost the irreplaceable Phil Hartman after season 4 (R.I.P. my noble friend) and Khandi Alexander (after season 3 I think).  They chose not to replace Khandi's character (smart move, that would have been a distraction) but Bill's antagonistic relationship with boss Dave Nelson was a central relationship in the show and, if they were to go on, they needed to find a replacement.  It's true that nobody was going to be able to fill Phil's shoes in quite the same way so they went for bringing in another character with a quirky personality who could be a radio star--Jon Lovitz's Max Lewis.  An ""A"" for effort for all who tried but, like most of the other reviewers have said, the show just wasn't the same and the 5th season became the last.  Still, a good run it was and we have it collected here in its entirety.

For those reviewers who have dumped low ratings on this due to the packaging (discs stacked together; no catalog of episode names; etc.) you have done this product (namely the show itself, with all of the extras and audio commentaries still on these discs) a disservice.

No episode details are listed and that is the only drawback, as some episodes are titled after Led Zeppelin Albums.

 A special treat is the commitment to audio commentaries. Each season features more than 10 episode commentaries. It really adds replay value to the set. The writers, producers and actors comment, some actors comment on episodes specific to the development of their characters.

Season 4 even includes a good amount of behind the scenes  footage. We can sit in on readers round tables, and table reads with the cast. In one bizarre clip, we hang out with Andy Dick in his trailer discussing a musical he has written. One of my favorite clips is being a fly on the wall during the filming of an episode. Each bonus clip also includes commentary which can be turned off. Not to mention gag reels, and the producers even do spoofs of the show itself.

Not that the rest of the cast is less talented - Maura Tierney and Khandi Alexander are a scream, Joe Rogan and Vicki Lewis have their own delightfully weird thing going on, and even the often-reviled Andy Dick fits into the ensemble. Fans generally discount the episodes filmed after Phil Hartman's tragic murder, but John Lovitz actually works very well as his replacement - he had big shoes to fill.

NewsRadio has a certain timeless quality (despite some now-dated references to 1990s celebrities and scandals) - the plots and jokes are all kind of classic. The writers rarely go blue - you could watch this with kids.

The DVD set itself is very basic - all the disks sit on a plastic spindle in a thin cardboard box.",1287792000,2,1207,4.683962264150943
3539216,5,B001DSNEM4,"This show is probably better then we even know. This is a part of history from the 90s. Although I like married with children better then this, this comes right after it. Its really sad what happened to Phil Hartman. He was such a funny guy and then to have his life end at what some call his peak in such a tragic way. Season 5 tried but I really feel that it just didn't work, but it was still funny none the less. Oh and I just don't understand that Andy Dick what the heck is wrong with him... you always see him on some stupid reality TV show about rehab or something it is so freaking lame he is in his 40's, while I'm 20 and more mature then him...",1285286400,,655,3.9696969696969697

3539219,5,B001DSNEM4,I was very pleased with the end product. It not only came quicker than expected but was in perfect condition as well. The only downfall to this product is the case packaging itself.  Its set up like a stack of dvd discs all on top of eachother(no protection between them). So for any interested buyers be prepared to buy a cd case to keep them in so they don't get scratched or just purchasing them as individual seasons to avoid this.,1275091200,5,435,4.37037037037037

My only issue is that the ""slim packaging"" meant that the DVDs are stacked one on top of another like a stack of CD-R discs.

3539231,3,B001DSNEM4,"I will echo the feelings of other Amazon customers ---

NewsRadio is a fantastic sitcom. I discovered it a few weeks ago on Netflix and wanted to get the complete series for myself. I love this type of humor and wish the television studios would go in this route instead of these silly reality shows they are focusing on. I also thought that the Amazon price was very reasonable.

The lower rating of this product is for the packaging of the DVDs. It is har to imagine how it could be any cheaper or any more careless. They come packed all together in a flimsy plastic insert with only a cardboard insert -- very little care was taken with this. I never thought that the packaging of a DVD product was that important to me -- but now that Ive seen this, I am more aware of it. Seriously, if you're going to spend about fifty dollars on a product, it should be packed with care.

All that being said, this is a fantastic show and Im glad its out on DVD !!",1271808000,2,954,4.202185792349726
3539232,3,B001DSNEM4,"Well worth the price, but certainly not a fancy definitive edition.  The disks come stacked on a spindle inside a cheapish looking box.  Not subtitled (except in Portuguese (???)) but the episodes are close captioned.  Almost every episode has an alternate commentary track supplied by someone or someones associated with the show.  My only real gripe is the picture quality is not real good but it's certainly acceptable.  And best of all, you get lots of Phil Hartman at his peak.",1271203200,,482,4.901234567901234
3539233,4,B001DSNEM4,"First off, this is a great show and I love it. But when I ordered it and it said ""slim packaging"" I was expecting maybe 3 dvd cases that held 4 dvd's in each. What I got was a small spindle with all 12 dvd's just stacked up on each other.
The reason for my 4 stars rather than 5 is most likely an issolated incident. When I opened my copy to make sure everything was there, I was missing Season 1 Disc 1. Which was easily replaceable.",1271116800,,434,3.9431818181818183
3539234,2,B001DSNEM4,"This show was under the radar in terms of everything, in my opinion. When you talk about Newsradio, people remember it, but they don't remember watching it. The series was cancelled after Phil Hartman died and Jon Lovitz stepped in.

The series was great and had it's moments, but this DVD package is utterly horrible. This is a review of the DVD, not just the show, which is why I had to give it such a low rating. This is a product review and the packaging for this product stinks.

The dvd case is the type of plastic the halloween masks are made out of and the dvd are piled ontop of one another like a blank DVD case pack. Prone to easy scratches and difficult to get to the certain disc you want. Why the hell they couldn't put together a normal DVD package is beyond me.

The show was good, but this DVD package is more ghetto than the streets.

Be warned.",1269475200,7,863,4.2439024390243905
3539235,5,B001DSNEM4,one of the best tv series there ever was.  kind of fell apart after khandi alexander left and phil hartman died.  I should have bought 2 of them to loan out to friends and still keep one to watch.,1267833600,2,196,4.0
3539236,4,B001DSNEM4,"The series is 5-star. I was a little worried it would have aged since I saw this in the 90s, but it really hasn't. I buy a lot of DVDs, some of which sit on the shelf a very long time before; but not this - I've been watching an episode of two most nights since it arrived. An exemplar of how an office sitcom is supposed to work.

Great special features, but the worst box in the history of box sets. The set is cheap, and you get what you pay for, I guess, but I'd have happily paid an extra couple of bucks for something sturdier and less prone to dvd damage.",1265760000,2,562,3.9298245614035086

I knew I would have to get covers and what not for it, but I wasn't worried about that. When my husband opened it and saw that it was ALL 5 seasons he just about jumped out of his socks. I hadn't ever really watched this show before, so it has bee a real treat for me too! Yes it has bad packaging! Yes I had to find new covers for them! Do I care? NO! My husband is happy as can be. Definitely the BEST GIFT EVER!",1262908800,3,584,3.7560975609756095

3539250,5,B001DSNEM4,"Watching these DVDs, I remember why I love this show so much: it's funny, and it's dense. Most sitcoms have an A story and a B story. NewsRadio has half the alphabet in each episode, there's always tons of different stuff going on, unlike in many other shows where the stories are drawn out, sometimes to good effect but usually not so much.

Also, all the characters have all kinds of weird running gag quirks, such as Dave's babyface and matching stature, Lisa's math capabilities and growing up without watching TV, Matthew's insane admiration of Bill and so on.

Yes, the packaging is fairly cheap but it gets the job done.

One thing: I'm not completely sure, but it looks like these might be syndication shows, clocking in at 21:50 per episode in the fourth season. In the 4th season episode where Bill interviews Jon Lovitz hanging from the side of the building I remember Joe falling/jumping out of the window (to Dave's dismay) to join them, but this didn't happen. However, this might have happened in a different episode although I can't remember another one with people hanging from the side of the building.",1260489600,8,1120,4.733333333333333
3539251,5,B001DSNEM4,"You're probably more likely to see positive reviews here than negative, since most people wouldn't have considered buying the entire series if they weren't sure they really enjoyed the show. However, I still must say this is one of the best series ever to grace the television with its brief presence. Of course, the tragic death of Phil Hartman all but brought the show to a screeching halt, and while the show did air one more season without ""Bill McNeil,"" it was never the same and the ratings showed that in its final episodes. However, I think with any sitcom there are certain points where the predetermined story and written scenes make themselves only too obvious, and it is only when we give a show a moment or two of our time to see if the writer's jokes can really make us laugh that we can look past these subtle imperfections to truly enjoy a well written show. Newsradio was truly ahead of its time with the humor and wit that it exhibited in the mid to late 90s, and all of the actors and actresses meshed very well with one another, which, coupled with the brilliant script writing I spoke of before, makes for a very enjoyable show. Sometimes Newsradio shows its age when you get a look at the computers and electronics that are used, but it certainly takes nothing away from the outstanding product laid before you at such an affordable price. If you ever enjoyed this show, or even if you never heard of it before today, I would recommend this to anyone with a good sense of humor looking for a program that can draw you in again and again. When it comes to comedy, Newsradio remains unmatched by other sitcoms to this very day.",1258243200,5,1647,4.493333333333333

3539253,4,B001DSNEM4,"I purchased the boxed set about a week ago. Thirty dollars for all five seasons is a great deal. Personally I have collected the individual seasons as well, but I lost two disks from the fifth season and one from the first. Instead of buying both seasons again, I figured I would buy the boxed set, and I couldn't have asked for a better deal. Sure the packaging is sub-par, but if you are really set on having an individual container for each disk, then you should purchase each season separately. It's just as easy to buy a  CD case to prevent scratching and easy viewing.",1247270400,5,574,4.415094339622642
3539254,4,B001DSNEM4,"I read how bad the packaging was on this product, and though it is not the usual packing and is not what I will use permanently, I don't use the other permanently either.  The packing does its job until I can get it into something better.  The show itself is hilarious.  The only problem I see is that the picture itself is grainy.  I am not sure if this is due to compression or if it was the quality of the original.

None the less, I enjoy watching the shows.",1246060800,17,462,4.088888888888889
3539255,5,B001DSNEM4,"I had missed the last season when it was originally aired, and it wasn't available on hulu, so I ordered this DVD set. Yes, the packaging leaves a bit to be desired, but I ALWAYS recycle my packaging anyway, as my DVD collection is so large that it took up too much space. CD Folders are definitely the way to go for an organized home!

Anyway... the gag reels were hilarious, but I felt they didn't really need to be ""bleeped"", what's the point of the gag reel when the funny part is censored?

Everyone complains that the final season wasn't up to par because Phil Hartman was no longer there, but I don't believe that's true. If you were watching JUST for Phil, you weren't truly a NewsRadio fan, you were a Phil Hartman fan. Dave Nelson was the character that held the whole mess together, and that's just what he did after the death of Bill McNeil. You can almost feel Dave getting close to the edge of his sanity in the last 3 or 4 episodes of the series. I wish it hadn't been cancelled, I was interested to see how the New Hampshire storyline was going to play out. :(
