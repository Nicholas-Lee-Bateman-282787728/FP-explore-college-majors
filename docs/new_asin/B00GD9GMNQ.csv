It is about Andre (Niels Arestrup `War Horse' and `A Prophet') who plays a doctor who seems to have a soft spot for Algerians who want to escape to France to have a better future. He has married one for her convenience and then he sponsors her brother Mounir (Tahar Rahim `Free Men' and `also `A Prophet'). They seem to have a very close bond indeed so when Mounir announces he wants to marry a French woman, there is a moment of awkward friction.

This woman is school teacher Murielle played by the achingly beautiful Emilie Dequenne (`The Pack' and `Brotherhood of the wolf'). They waste absolutely no time in starting a family and Andre insists that they live with him. He sees himself as part of the larger family and what at first seems to be a loving and helpful man soon starts to be revealed as a manipulating and very controlling person indeed. As his influence grows so does the gap between the erstwhile love birds and it is only a matter of time before things will come to a head.

Director Joachim Lafosse has managed to make a harrowing true story be very watchable and engrossing with his portrayal of the inter relationships that make people act in a way they would never have meant to. All of the performances are excellent with Emilie Dequenne putting in an exceptional performance of a woman slowly coming unravelled; she seems to age as the film progresses. Issues around illegal immigration are touched upon but the morality is left for the viewer to decide. This was a co-production of companies in France, Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland and is a case where too many cooks can make a rather excellent meal of a film altogether. This is no feel good film either, but with the subject matter it was never going to be. In French and Arabic with very good sub titles and a run time of 111 minutes all of which are put to excellent use - this is a film for lovers of European cinema and fans of Niels Arestrup who is also excellent in the slow burning role of a controlling dictator - highly recommended.",1391212800,3,2097,4.515789473684211

It is also a feeling that can, at time, endear me to a film or a particular performance because I find myself longing to correct what I cannot and seeking any way (racking my brain mostly) that they can fix their plight and find that happy ending, even when it is obvious that all is lost and there is no light at the end of this very dark and dense tunnel.  I love tension and dramatics and that emotional connection to a film that is caused, and carried, by suffering and so I guess Im a glutton for punishment because I like it when a film can reduce me to tears, and I don't mean happy tears (although those are welcome as well).

There were many moments during Our Children when I found myself clenching my fists in anger as a solitary tear slid down my cheek.

This movie is devastating.

Based on a true story, although Im not entirely sure how loose this adaptation is, Our Children tells a very interesting tale of love, marriage and a third wheel.  The film tells the story of Murielle, a young and beautiful woman who falls for Mounir, a Moroccan man living in France.  Upon falling in love, and marrying Mounir, Murielle becomes aware of his families plight.  Being of Moroccan decent, they are in the country illegally and have been seeking paper-marriages to avoid deportation back to Morocco.  Mounirs own sister is married to a man, Dr. Pinget, who is practically Mounirs adopted father.  Murielle is assured that her marriage is not the same thing, and that Mounir is really in love with her, but as their marriage starts to form roots it becomes more and more evident that this was a mistake.  They move in with Dr. Pinget, who manages their finances and provides well enough for them, but as they begin to produce children things get stuffy in their home, and Murielle begins to desire a separation between themselves and the looming presence (and judgmental eye) of Dr. Pinget.

But he won't have that.

The character of Dr. Pinget is a very interesting one, and one that truly stood out for me.  The backstory created with mere glances from Niels Arestrup (marvelous performance) is uncanny.  While the film makes subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) hints towards his relationship with Mounir and his vicarious voyeurism, it is left up to the audience to conclude for themselves who this man is and WHY he is doing what he is doing.  Thankfully, Arestrup dominates this role, understanding how to do so much with such an ambiguous presence.

But the film easily belongs to Emilie Dequenne, who is astonishing as the conflicted and eternally frustrated Murielle.  Her spark of life slowly diminishes as the film progresses, and she brilliantly conveys the overwhelming loss of freedom and control that Murielle undergoes.  Your heart breaks for her, and while the films climax is utterly devastating and something that I would normally loathe (seriously, nothing else in the world infuriates me more than the harming of a child), there is a sense of understanding that is only brought forth because of Dequennes miraculous portrayal.  The understanding that she has of her childrens futures thanks to the prison that has been built around them paints a very haunting portrait of a woman who did the only thing she knew how.

Her final phone call just kills me.

The films use of music was something that I particularly loved, and those sweeping segments of music and movement (the kissing, the love making) helped to build emotional connections and color in the relationships here, helping us to fall deeper into the family plight.

Overall, I really liked this one.  I guess that is the wrong choice of words.  I didn't like this film at all, but I admire and respect what it did.  The film is a very hard one to watch, not because it is poorly done (its VERY effectively constructed) but because the story is so frustrating and heartbreaking.  That final scene is one I never hope to see again, and it wasn't like anything was actually shone (but that is also what made it all the more effective).  An astonishing look at desperation and the toll it can take on those incapable of escaping.",1389312000,5,4166,4.677640603566529
