4255723,4,B0043IX86S,"Suzanne decides to resume her physical therapy career after 15 years, now that her two children with rich doctor Samuel are almost grown, so Samuel hires Spanish handyman Ivan to convert a shed into Suzanne's new workspace. While Samuel treats the working class ex-con with contempt, Suzanne quickly bonds with soulful Ivan, and the two quickly find themselves falling in love.

None of this is treated lightly by the film. Both Suzanne (Kristin Scott Thomas) and Ivan are seen fighting their feelings throughout the film's first act. The obvious attraction, as well as the conflict these two middle-aged adults have about these feelings, is written all over their faces. The chemistry between the two characters is not just erotic ... it's clear that these people share a deep affection for one another. When the two finally consummate their relationship, it's not an act of animal passion, but of tenderness.

Ivan, although romantic, is too much of a realist to expect Suzanne to leave her rich husband and children for him. So it's Suzanne who takes the initiative. In a shocking moment of clarity, she confesses to her husband that she's fallen in love and plans to leave.

Strangely, despite being a story that begins with infidelity, Samuel is the character who emerges as the true monster in the film. Instead of displaying sadness and grief over the loss of his wife, he reacts more like a toddler when you've taken away his favorite toy. At first he throws temper tantrums, becoming violent and verbally abusive, ""forbidding"" her to leave. In these scenes, it's more clear than ever why, despite the financial security, Suzanne would want to leave this man ... he really sees her as nothing more than another possession and status symbol. Samuel is not only furious that someone he regarded as ""his"" would dare to leave him, but the fact that Suzanne is leaving him for someone he considers to be so far beneath him leaves him enraged. When Suzanne sticks to her resolve and goes, Samuel uses his influence in the community to sabotage Suzanne and Ivan's ability to make even a meager living, and as their situation becomes more desperate, it leads to a tragic chain of events.

The film manages to provide a believable, albeit tragic, love story, anchored by a powerhouse performance by the beautiful Kristin Scott Thomas. Normally stories about characters who find themselves caught up in a passionate and impractical love affair are about young people, so it's interesting to see these feelings believably portrayed in an older couple. In the midst of the tragic love story, the film also explores social class, as well as the sacrifices made for love, family, and money.",1331164800,11,2684,4.93141592920354
4255724,3,B0043IX86S,"It's a pity because this film is quite visually pleasant and well crafted, but the plot and particularly the characters, are a bit two-dimensional and unbelievable...not quite in the egregious American/Hollywood-blockbuster kind of way, but more in the King Lear self-destructive and hopelessly incompetent lemming kind of way.

The film is basically a counterpoint to the romantic cliche that ""Love conquers all.""  It doesn't, and in this movie we can see its systematic destruction coming from miles and miles away.  I suppose if you somehow find it a revelation that many rich men have an inordinate amount of power over their wives and over the lives of poor working men, you might enjoy this movie more than I did.  I won't say more about what happens in the movie because it is already so excruciatingly predictable.

I give it 3 stars because it really doesn't show me anything new, despite Kristin Scott Thomas being a gorgeous woman and highly talented actress...but eye candy can only go so far.",1307664000,2,1005,4.958333333333333
4255725,5,B0043IX86S,"THIS IS A WONDERFUL MOVIE, KRISTIN SCOTT THOMAS HAS TO BE THE BEST ACTRESS ON THE PLANAT, SHE CAN PLAY ANY ROLE TO PERFECTION.",1300147200,2,126,4.291666666666667
4255726,5,B0043IX86S,"Scott-Thomas gets a chance to expand beyond her normal range of roles, and does so magnificently - here showing how a middle-aged woman can become once again a young girl full of hormonal enthusiams. Frankly it's a delight to see this accomplished actress in a role that permits her to portray a far more passionate and naive character, sex scenes and all.

The plot is basic: woman in a dull marriage falls for a builder, has an affair, confesses to her husband, can't let go of her desire to continue the affair... The point is not the plot but the very human behaviors, reactions, and pain that is consequential to the act. No one escapes unscathed. The movie is like a Dutch painting - everything is finely observed, on a small scale, and intensely human.

There's no point in judging the behavior of the various characters - this isn't a medieval morality play. It's a study of an accidental explosion that occurs in the lives of perfectly normal people living mundane lives. What matters is how accurate, how honest, and how involving the study manages to be. And this study manages to be extremely good indeed. We can watch, knowing that it's all going to end badly yet appreciating the transient pleasure experienced by the lovers even as they destroy those around them. Watching, we can know that thoughtlessness leads too often to low-quality outcomes yet we enjoy the sureness of touch exhibited by the cast and director. We can know that temporary infatuation is no real basis for  an adult relationship, yet we can remember our own jeunesse d'esprit from all those years ago - before we discovered that actions inevitably have consequences.

It's sad to watch a grown woman behave in a way guaranteed to lead to ruin, but at the same time it is a fascinating and engrossing spectable. And always performed with fidelity and low-key intensity. So many people in real life make decisions based on what feels easiest rather than on what is right. It's rare to have the opportunity to watch the crash play out in finely detailed slow-motion before our eyes.

While UK films are trending towards ever-greater superficiality and US films become ever more reliant on CGI, the French are - fortunately for anyone who cares about film making - continuing to make little gems like this.",1299283200,23,2289,4.784810126582278
4255727,5,B0043IX86S,"I LIKE THIS KIND OF DRAMA...IT IS SLOW AND METHODICAL (DETAILED) AND IT SEEMS REAL (TEXTBOOK); THE CHARACTERS ARE BELIEVABLE AND FULLY DEVELOPED SO THAT YOU KNOW HOW THEY FEEL EVEN IF YOU DISAGREE WITH THEM. AND ANYONE WHO HAS GONE THROUGH ""DOMESTIC DRAMA"" IS LIKELY TO FEEL BETTER AND NOT SO ALONE AND EVEN LEARN A POINTER OR TWO WATCHING THIS KIND OF DRAMA (INCLUDE ""Mademoiselle Chambon""), SO THERE IS A BIT OF THERAPY AND LIFE LESSON TO BEHOLD.

Parents use to teach hometraining to their sons and daughters to let them know that REAL life is out there. Parents made suggestions to their children about how to deal with such matters.  Nowadays we don't do that.  We rather operate as if REAL LIFE died and left us all in wonderland.

This is a story about a woman who wanted her freedom and thought that was a reasonable request but it wasn't. She was held rather (in human bondage) sort of speak so the pressure builds as it will in real life and something is bound to happen that is foolish and ill-thought and reactionary.

There is a virtue here...kind of cockeyed though (she could have gone on for years pretending).  She may have even returned to her marriage.  Many of them do.  (Many women do this kind of thing very discreetly and return to their marriage and think about it for the rest of their lives but never do anything else illicit.)

There is an old saying, ""If you love something set it free; if it doesn't come back to you, it was never yours in the first place.""

4255728,1,B0043IX86S,"One of the worst movies that I've seen lately. Even good actors cannot help a stupid script. In Samuel's place I would throw out such a wife without any regrets,even after 20 years of living together. His crying and begging her to return,outbursts of rage and silly revenge acts don't cause any sympathy. Suzanne's behaviour doesn't make any sense. A spoiled with luxury and bored housewife,looking for love-sex adventures, destroying her family's life and finally commiting a crime. For what? Don't waste your time on this schlock!",1293148800,4,532,5.126436781609195
4255729,5,B0043IX86S,"Leaving is one of the most shattering, uncompromised examples of the melodrama since the best work of Ophuls, Sirk, and Minnelli.  It reminds us that the era of the female as absolute property of the male has by no means ended.  The woman as ""housewife,"" as a being policed by the male in a domicile (photographed to resemble a prison)without an ounce of warmth, is brilliantly achieved here, as is the woman's terrible sexual frustration and doubt about each decision. A wonderful companion piece to this season's more operatic I AM LOVE.",1291507200,5,539,4.8478260869565215
8414992,5,B0043IX86S,"This movie is EXCELLENT in every way: the acting, the directing, the scenery, the storyline, everything! Serge Lopez played his role to perfection, and Kristin Scott Thomas is walking perfection, but especially in this role. I think all the characters were played extremely well. Someone said the French wouldn't have an issue with an extramarital affair, but that's not the point!  Her husband is a control freak, in every way.  That is the point of his issues with her.  This is a perfect story, with perfect actors, playing each of their roles perfectly, and written and beautifully directed by Catherine Corsini.",1508025600,,616,5.079207920792079

8414995,2,B0043IX86S,"Kristin Scott Thomas is wonderful and sexy as always, but this is a French film so she has only so much with which to work.  Her fluency in French is amazing, but the movie is not.  It starts well enough but the character development is improbable, as well as the initiation of the movie's affair and its denouement.  It is even more improbable since the movie is French, and, as everyone knows, the French are the last people on earth to lose their heads over a little extramarital sex (the current islamic invaders of France excepted since they are actually in the thrall of that evil mass psychosis known as islam).  The movie, does, however, have some nice French and Spanish scenery.  Only giving 2 stars because of my dreamboat Kristen, otherwise 1 star, barely..",1486425600,,769,4.666666666666667
8414996,1,B0043IX86S,"I bought this because of Kristen Scott Thomas. I so loved her in 'The English Patient'. When began to watch I was disappointed that there was no English version (only subtitles). Guess I didn't read the description closely enough. Although that was aggravating, I did watch the movie. I could not believe it. I kept waiting, waiting, assuming that the characters would 'click' for me but, I'm sorry, there just seemed to be no rapport between any of the main actors involved. Especially the two main characters. I had a hard time believing KST was that devastatingly drawn to the male lead character. Chemistry? None, zero, nada. Very disappointed!",1366848000,,648,4.954128440366972
8414997,4,B0043IX86S,"Kristin Scott Thomas is the upper class wife and mother full of bourgeois misery as she walks from her marital bed in suburbia in a flashforward,then a shot is heard. Her Spanish handyman,Ivan(Sergi Lopez),a former jailbird breaks an ankle halting her runaway car while working at her home. She drives him to Spain to see his small daughter, they become lovers. Suzanne is guilty about her adulterous affair,what it is doing to her family,but she is determined to act on her desires. Remembering Scott Thomas from I've Loved You So Long(2008),she's good at complex,ambivalent female protagonists. The camera stays close to the lovers from their 1st encounter and we get a sense of the stripping off of Suzanne's bourgeois propriety as she pursues the affair. She guiltily confesses to her arrogant husband but can't help herself rekindling the affair. Her husband Samuel freezes her bank accounts and uses his influence to prevent the couple getting work. Suzanne is forced back to Samuel before bolting again. In the Languedoc countryside,sizzling with heat, the adulterous couple make ecstatic love in a field. Desparate for funds they steal her husband's co-owned paintings while he is away. Husband and lover are are very simply portrayed,one a villain the other a stoic. Director Corsini reminds us of Truffaut's ill-fated lovers by using his scores on the soundtrack. As Suzanne becomes increasingly unstable the tale loses some credibility. Her husband subjecting her to beatings, bullying,rape leading to an overwound tragedy. There's a Laurentian theme at work of the kindling of love by lust and the hollowness of bourgeoise marriage. Thomas well conveys the abandonment to passion and misery.",1358121600,,1703,5.264705882352941
8414998,1,B0043IX86S,"I did not like it.  She was a mess, I just did not like how desperate she was in the relationship with her lover... I just don't know what he saw in her as she always looked very dirty, messy.

8414999,4,B0043IX86S,"Loved her acting-superb!  But her character was missing a few rings in the evolutionary cycle of maturity on many levels.  Sexual passion should be bridled and tamed & when it is not, you have people DISREGARDING their own husbands and wives and children and marriages, culminating through pedophilia, pornography, beastiality, and all kinds of imbalances.  Her husband WAS NOT to blame - it was only she for signing up to be treated like a help instead of PROUDLY taking care of her family by CHOICE. She let her own denied passion(s) get out of control by not LISTENING TO HER OWN INNER WISDOM.  Who forced her to marry him? I don't care what label you put on him.  She debased herself to basic ""crack-head"" antics thru the way she ending her marriage with no rationality.  She could have intelligently gotten herself a divorce attorney ONLY AFTER giving her husband & family some emotional time to deal with her sporatic decision.  She could have given herself more time to evaluate this new lover of hers before deciding after 2-3 great sex episodes that she MUST throw her eggs in one basket and foolishly impact so many lives.

Woman do deny and rob THEMSELVES of far too much for the sake of having a man (penis) then they want to turn it around and blame the man for not allowing them to be WHOLE.  That's something only you can give yourself.  THERE WERE SO MANY OTHER OPTIONS-but she let her sexual impulses lead the way and someone ended up dead.  She made the wrong choice.

If Ivan couldn't perform SEXUALLY all this would not have happened---so for 2-3 sexscapades-you kill the father of your children.  And then we have those romantics....I won't even go there.",1345420800,,1676,4.679180887372014
8415000,3,B0043IX86S,"I think that I put this title on another film review that I wrote recently...I don't recall which one.  In any case, I think that the strong performance of Kristin Scott Thomas makes this film watchable.  She gives a character who is somewhat unbelievable and not all that sympathetic, so much life and humanity that we do believe her and root for her.  At least I did.

It's set in France and Spain so it's visually delicious.  The supporting cast is mixed; Yvan Atta makes a wonderful bad guy.  Sergi Lopez, who plays the man she falls in love with, didn't really win  me over with his charms.  He is physically large, as opposed to Atta and from the many sex scenes we get the message over and over that he's a much more energetic lover than her husband.  But other than that, I didn't see anything to motivate her to go the extremes that she did for him.  And, back to KST--she is basically too sane and balanced a human being to play crazy and she had to be crazy to do what she did.  If the story had given us a sense of some tragic crack in her psyche that would make her later actions credible, it would have been a better film. She was a physiotherapist, a healer, who, presumably would have more sense than to self-destruct the way she did.  Likewise with her husband.  He was shown to be a snob in the beginning but we don't see the great nastiness that he shows later.

I saw this film the same day that I saw ""Mademoiselle Chambon"" another French film with a similar theme.  An upper-middle class, educated woman falls in love with another hunky construction worker.  In that case it's the man who is married with a family, but the dilemma is the same.  ""Mademoiselle Chambon"" is a much better made film.  The characters are more fully rounded; the wife of the construction worker is sympathetic and believable.  In ""Leaving"" the characters are little more than cardboard stereotypes, even though KST, does an amazing job of making hers real.  I gave Mlle. Chambon five stars.

Another reviewer dismissed the film as feminist propaganda, and while I didn't think of it that way when I watched it, upon reflection it does seem to be a fair criticism.  It does seem to be a ""made up"" story to prove a point, perhaps how women are oppressed even in present day France.  If that agenda were dropped and the writer had let the characters develop themselves naturally, it might have been a more interesting and believable film.

If you watch it for the beautiful Ms. Scott Thomas, you won't be disappointed.  Just don't expect a lot more.",1342483200,4,2545,4.492374727668845
