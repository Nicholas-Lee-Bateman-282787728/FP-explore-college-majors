1708008,4,B000065U2U,"This movie was absolutely captivating. From the very beginning my attention was caught and lasted throughout the entire film. The whole build-up of the Jacob storyline was what really moved me. The one thing that prevented me from giving it 5 stars was how the ending seemed a bit rushed. I feel they should have explored the feelings of all members of the family a bit more. I would love for them to make a sequel to this film about Sarah, Jacob, and Earnst going back into society. But all in all, it was a truely moving movie.",1038700800,6,529,4.408163265306122
1708009,4,B000065U2U,"in my opinion this movie was very exciting. There were many different mood swings But in the beging when they were on the ship it was a little too dark to see. So that makes the eyes stranded a little. If you are on the ""edge"" about this movie i reconmend that you see it. If you don't mind a little violence you should see it. In the hole movie i only counted 2 murders. Although the movie isn't rated (i mean G, PG, PG-13, R OR X)i  would rate it probaly rate it PG-13.",1037664000,,471,3.957894736842105
1708010,4,B000065U2U,"This was a wonderful movie and I would highly recommend it, yet it is not for young children, it is very different from the Swiss Family Robinson. It is not as happy but more exciting and there are a lot of new twists. The 3 brothers are very very nice on the eyes so if you don't like the movie you will still enjoy the view.
 Another Hallmark production that I would Highly recommmend is the 10th kingdom, it was fabulous to say the least.",1026518400,6,441,4.188235294117647
1708021,5,B000065U2U,"This is a great family movie.  It has drama, a love story, adventure, heartbreak,  and even some humor.  The best movies have it all!  The cast is superb.  It's hard to find clean, family friendly movies that are also entertaining, so I highly recommend it!",1363564800,,257,4.622222222222222

1708024,5,B000065U2U,"Thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Is one for the entire family.  Scenery is wonderful, can watch it over and over again.  If you are looking for a good movie that you don't have to worry about it being too worldly, you will enjoy it too.",1344211200,3,235,4.295454545454546

1708026,3,B000065U2U,"I must say I was a little surprised by this movie. It was actually really good! I really enjoyed the characters and, if it wasn't 175 minutes, I would recommend it as a family movie. As much as I enjoyed this movie and as much as I was rooting for the main characters, I do have a slight problem with one thing. *Spoilers** My only complaint is when one of the Robinson boys goes missing, n adorable Andrew Lee-Potts, the family doesn't seem to be too worried. Even when he's missing for over 7 years! Personally, I think I would be more heartbroken. Especially when they finally find him, the reunion seemed a little lacking to me. If that was my son or brother that had gone missing and I finally found him after 7 years, pretty sure I would have knocked him flat with a back breaking hug and probably endless tears. That's just me. Nevertheless, good story, good characters, worth a gander.",1334275200,,893,4.451219512195122
1708027,5,B000065U2U,"I first saw this movie on the Hallmark channel and after watching it several times on television decided that I needed it for my video library. For those who have not seen it, it is a wonderful version of Swiss Family Robinson that is full of action, scenery, and special effects. The actors are superb and the film is long enough to do the story justice--175 minutes. It is great family entertainment and will hold the attention of young and old alike. I still love the Disney version of Swiss Family Robinson but this one is updated and more believable. You cannot go wrong with this movie.",1331769600,,592,4.542056074766355
1708028,5,B000065U2U,"I have seen this movie so many times I think i know the dialogue.  But what i don't have is a good copy of it.  i taped it off a regular tv.  I agree that i am going to get the dvd.  This a beautiful telling of a classic story.  A bit off from the earlier Disney version.  This family leaves to follow their father;  who is  banished for his religious convictions to not join the army.

I could not take my eyes off it.  The amazing family making the best of a possibly  horrible future  exiled on a deserted island; a lost son; and if found several years in prison.  The actors were outstanding.  The locale made me wish i was stranded there.  Gorgeous men, amazing locale, wonderful story of people of faith making a life together.

i think the one message that comes from this movie for families  watching this movie is that with faith in each other; tolerance and love that it doesnt matter where you live as long as you are together. Despite disagreements, the children respected their parents; honored them and in the end it made them an even more cohesive family unit.

A wonderful action, adventure movie for a great night for the family.  There is something in it for everyone.  The parents will love the message of family unity and honor; the kids will love the action and pirates; and in the end i think that it will become a  family classic.",1275782400,3,1353,4.353413654618474
1708029,1,B000065U2U,"You could give this movie four stars if you wanted something to fill over 3 hours with very slow paced action.  Acting was ok given the story line, but the ""FIGHT"" scenes are almost funny. Shots fired everywhere but during the 3 hours plus I only remember 3 persons getting hit and two stabbed. For a pirate ship, that's better odds then going downtown in St Louis. LOL.
SORRY but for me this movie lacks the action of 'Swiss family Robison' that it claims to have used as a model.",1264204800,,481,4.344444444444444
1708040,5,B000065U2U,"This is a fun movie, a take off or earlier type of Swiss Family Robinson Movie.  I would recommend this movie for kids as well as adults. Kind of a fun family type movie. Thanks",1244851200,3,177,4.057142857142857
1708041,3,B000065U2U,"Product met my expectations and arrived in a timely fashion.  Very happy with both shipment and service, along with a very entertaining product.  I highly recommend this to all customers for a future purchase.",1234137600,,209,5.117647058823529
1708042,5,B000065U2U,This movie has some violence in it so you should be cautious about young children seeing it.  Otherwise it is a heartwarming story of servival based on Swiss Family Robinson.,1220140800,2,174,4.8
1708043,5,B000065U2U,"My opinion of this version of ""Swiss Family Robinson"", is that this is the more adult version of that same story. Color, and clarity of picture, compared to the VHS version, is beautiful. The father came across as a little weak, but all in all, it was worth getting for my movie library.",1219881600,3,287,4.433962264150943
1708044,5,B000065U2U,"I really enjoyed this DVD. The was great and I liked their interaction with each other. At times, it did drag a little and it was hard not to compare it with Swiss Family Robinson, but all in all I would recommend it as a good family evening watch.",1219622400,,248,4.081632653061225
1708045,3,B000065U2U,"The VHS/Video version is MUCH BETTER - this DVD must include uncut scenes and the story drags.  Still, my kids love the movie and at times I do, too but if you have a VHS player - go that route.  Warning: Men hate this movie.  Maybe more for kids and women who like some sappy parts in an adventure story.",1194480000,,305,4.05
1708046,4,B000065U2U,"This is a good, clean, wholesome family movie, made in the Hallmark tradition, and based on the book, ""The Swiss Fmily Robinson.""  You pretty much know the story already, but the movie is different enough to keep your interest.  The acting and production are very good, and the scenery is superior.",1179532800,3,298,4.823529411764706
1708047,5,B000065U2U,"Yes, it is long and slow but the movie itself is great. It gives more of the book than Disney could gather together. Worth the watch!",1177545600,,133,4.153846153846154
1708048,3,B000065U2U,"I made the mistake of buying this based on reviews here. I recommend you rent this first before buying it. Now I am always willing to see a different take on a book. This version of Swiss Family Robinson is more closely related than some others. I went into this with an open mind and my wife watched as well. Both our conclusions were we probably wouldn't sit through it again. It is okay, but it is far to slow in developing the story. This should have had tighter editing. It does not need to be so long a movie, and some of the scenes were not well acted. The music isn't that great either. I know now why someone like Hallmark didn't pick this one to distribute. Overall I am disappointed so many rated this so well. I think this movie had good potential, but it wasn't realized during editing. The scripting is pretty good and I like the addition of the native that comes to the Island. But it just seemed to drag along sometimes. Although the Disney version is a little far fetched with the Zebra and Ostrich on the island, it has much more action and is far more enjoyable to watch.",1175558400,4,1090,4.296116504854369
1708049,5,B000065U2U,"What a refreshing movie.  Right off the bat it reminded me of ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" (classic book & movie) and ""[the Adventures of}] Robinson Crusoe"" ( [movie] & classic book).  The way the stranded family adapted to their new environment and made a life for themselves on the island also reminded me of the modern American reality TV-show called ""Survivor - *location name* .""

I highly recommend this movie (over 3 hours) because it is also quite different than the mentioned books/films, and TV show.  This movie is based on a book, and the cinematography is superb.

Get comfy, grab some snack food, and enjoy your company (family or friends) ... for this movie is a good adventure ... even if much unlikely for any of us, as for the main characters.

Survivor, ""this family is growing up"" ...The failure to communicate is the failuyre to love.",1173312000,4,854,4.697986577181208
1708070,4,B000065U2U,"I was drawn in to this movie expecting to see the standard ""lost at sea"" type of story and was pleasantly surprised as the plot unfolded.  This family made the best of an awful situation, looked out for one another, and always relied upon their faith in God to get them through.  They really ""bloomed"" where they were ""planted"".  This production was so much more realistic than others and I could actually visualize myself in their situation--I was on the edge of my seat a number of times.  This was very well done and such a refreshing change from the standard fare of violence, sex, and other depravity we are bombarded with on a daily basis.",1170028800,35,645,4.5344827586206895
1708071,4,B000065U2U,"""Stranded"" is based on the book ""The Swiss Family Robinson"" by Johann David Wyss. This is a pretty good movie. I was invsioning a movie like the Disney ""The Swiss Family Robinson"" but this movie had more action and a better storyline. ""Stranded"" shows the struggle that the family had to face over the years not only from their enviroment, but from just being alone. Overall, ""Stranded"" is really good movie for the whole family.",1163980800,5,429,4.733333333333333
1708072,4,B000065U2U,Before I watched this movie I was told that this version was more like the book. While watching this I was comparing this with the orginal Family Robinson. I did like Stranded. It does have more action and more characters. A great family film. A must see for every family. I have not read the book but it would of been better to have the tiger in Stranded. Something seemed to be missing. It is close to 3hours long but you will be on the edge of your seats. Make this movie one of your collections.,1145664000,,499,4.208333333333333
1708073,5,B000065U2U,"This is a beautiful and lavish production that has more eye candy than computer generated space movies.

I bought this thinking it would be the 120 minute version that Amazon states. Sometimes things work out for the worse, but this time I was pleasantly surprised with the 180 minute version. I had to get that out because it allowed a lot of sub-plots that I can imagine were cut. We get to see how the Robinsons learned to subsist, as well as how the one son got along, being away from the family for all of those years. In fact, these were not just brief moments of showing what was going on in the son's life, but there were whole new plots involved that made this a very fulfilling movie and well worth the time invested. I could not name one of the actors in the movie. I did note someone named Liam. I could reach ten inches from here and grab the info, but the names would still mean little to me. That's sort of the point. Good acting, though maybe not great, and parts that were written from story, not thinking, ""well, since we have Brad Pitt (who?), we'll have to throw in some meaty lines, inside jokes, and modern humour."" Thank you, no. I'll take this type of well done production any day of the week.

  Next time I need to sip some tea and get lost into a beautiful, exotic dream, this movie will be at the top of the list.",1135123200,8,1341,4.247058823529412
1708074,5,B000065U2U,"I never was into 'family' movies, but now with kids, I'm starting to check them out already on my own, as my kids are still too young yet.  I saw this in the family section of a rental store and just finished watching.  I was skeptical at first, wondering if I'd like it.  But then before I knew it, I was completely drawn into the film and didn't want to stop to watch the second half tomorrow as I planned-- I had to see what came next.  This was an interesting take on a great story, the acting was great, and the plot kept on moving.  This was no goofy family film, but not some violent movie by any means.  I'd think this would be a PG movie had it been rated, but maybe 9+ would start enjoying it more... but I always recommend pre-viewing a movie first before showing the children because a parent is the best judge for his/her child.

Right now I am glad I decided to check out family films for down the road, because it's introducing me to films like this that I would have loved to see even if I had no kids!

And... so many people in this film were gorgous yet had interesting looks.  The three sons, very very hot.  The mother was breathtaking, and the young blond girls were stunning.  I couldn't help but mention that!

After seeing this movie on VHS from the rental store, I'm posting my order now from Amazon for the DVD.  I don't care if there are no extras (which I hardly utilize anyway)-- the movie is worth the price.

UPDATE: I wanted to add that I have now viewed this on my new DVD, and the film is breathtaking.  Crisp and clear, this makes me never want to see a VHS tape again after seeing the difference.  Before it was the story and acting that drew me in, but now the scenery adds so much in this clearer view on the DVD.  I just want to repeat, this is no cheesy family film-- buy it for yourself!",1124150400,43,1828,4.1477272727272725
1708075,5,B000065U2U,"This is the story of Robinson family shipwrecked on an island [not Mars].  I was intrigued to find out how Liam Cunningham fared in this role after watching Falling For a Dancer and Dog Soldiers.  I really enjoy his acting.

His wife, two older sons and a daughter land on the island with him.  He being bound for the convict island of Australia.

A younger son, Jacob, had been put on a small boat escaping the wrecking of the ship.  He is not reunited with his family for 7 years.

The one son is always going against his father's decisions if he makes better sense of his own instincts.  But the boys seem to work well with each other.

Oh yes, there is an involuntary drop-off of another female to confuse the issue.  And daddy is hot on her trail.  Well, the trail of the pirates anyway.

Then they meet a native [great body] and he helps them and also helps save Laura?  And becomes a saving factor in the end.

The pirate Captian is a scoundrel and always putting the moves on Robinson's wife.  He also turns Jake, the Robinson's son into a pirate.

Those pirates provide plenty of action - not necessarily good.

The rescue and resolution was all that was hoped for.

The actors were excellent - the scenery was spectacular - the story a classic - and definitely a credit to the Hallmark trademark

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - great family movie -- tons of color - [grin, lots of water]",1110067200,22,1387,4.41106719367589
1708076,3,B000065U2U,"The film I saw (on DVD) was inspired by the book Swiss Family Robinson.  The father, a preacher, is sentenced to life in Australia for refusing to declare loyalty to the crown.  The family choses to go with him into exile.  On the way a storm destroys the ship.  The youngest son gets to the boats and is separated from his family.  The family lands on an island and has to come to understand each other and rely on their skills and knowledge.  The father learns that he is not all knowing and all powerful.  Each of the children learn and grow.  They survive and through an unlikely series of events are finally reunited.

1708077,4,B000065U2U,"I enjoyed this film very much... although it bears hardly any resemblance to the original film or book, it's very cleverly done. Plus, it doesn't hurt that the guys in this film are very good looking... wink wink.
The DVD however... total bomb. There is nothing in it except the 'scene selection' and 'play film' options. I would have loved to have seen deleted scenes, or making-of's. I would have loved to see more of Andrew Lee-Potts (Jacob) seeing as he was my favorite character... but since the film itself is so good, I give the DVD 4 stars.",1050451200,,548,4.545454545454546
1708078,4,B000065U2U,"This would have to be my favorite Hallmark film ever (well ok... tied with Secret Garden). The movie is simply fantastic. The scenery, acting, and story are perfect. However, I couldn't give this DVD edition 5 stars because the Disc is practically empty. All it contains is the movie and a scene selection menu. In an age where we expect to see original trailers, filmographies, and ""making of"" featurettes, one cannot expect to be happy with a DVD this bare. The sound, although really nice, is a tad bit disappointing as well. With 5.1 as the norm, 2.0 doesn't quite please. I really wish that they had put a little more work into giving this wonderful film the release that it deserves. Still, this disc is the best way to see this masterpiece.

This movie is more adult than other versions and deals with more complex emotions especially with the family separation of the youngest son Jacob from the rest of the clan.  If you have young children and want them to watch the movie with you, you may have to do some explaining but there is only a limited amount of violence and there is a strong Christian presence throughout the movie and pirates and castaways.
