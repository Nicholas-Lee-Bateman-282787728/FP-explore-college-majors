WHO THE HECK EDITED THIS AND IS THERE ANY WAY TO STOP THEM FROM CHOPPING UP THESE STORIES. THEY REPRESENT MY CULTURE AND THEY NEED TO BE TOLD IN THIER ENTIRETY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.  I REALLY HATED THE EDITING.  I WISH THEY WOULD RE-DO THE EDITING ON THIS.,1361404800,,361,4.202898550724638
2197499,1,B0006Z2NOK,One DVD was missing. There is  nothing worse than to miss out a part of a movie or novela. I could not return it because my time to return had expired! This is not the product you can just check right away unless you watch it.,1360627200,,226,3.9130434782608696

2197502,5,B0006Z2NOK,"You get not only one, but TWO Gaby Spanic characters in this telenovela!
It's amazing how she portraits two people so differently. There's no doubt she's an amazing actress.

2197503,3,B0006Z2NOK,"El servicio de este vendedor es bueno, bastante rapido el envio, pero acerca del contenido no es muy bueno, se encuentra en calidad estandar, no abarca toda la pantalla en caso de que tengas una television hdtv, ademas de ser solo un resumen muy corto de la serie, solo pone un poco de lo mas esencial para comprender la trama y ya esta en poco mas de 3 horas ya viste todo, en fin, en tanto mi mujer este contenta con lo que vio, no hay problema.",1344470400,,447,4.149425287356322

2197505,3,B0006Z2NOK,"La Presentacion, Diseo, Portada y demas son Exelentes, en cuanto a la edicion del Dvd es buena pero le faltan muchas pero muchas escenas importantes de Paola en contra de los Bracho: por ejemplo cuando insulta a Gema en la mesa, luego de haber hecho el pacto, y ambas discuten por diferentes cosas, cuando Paola martiriza a piedad en el jardin (antes de que Willy le pegue un tiro a Carlos Daniel), cuando Gema le dice a Paola que Carlos Daniel esta internado porque Willy le disparo y ella se rie burlandose. Faltan muchas escenas de las maldades de Paola, pensamientos y demas (algunas escenas con la enfermera, Elvira) y sobre todo escenas del Final. En el final podrian haber dejado las escenas de cuando Paulina se arregla con Carlos Daniel, que si bien esta, esta demasiado cortada, cuando Paulina regresa a la casa de los Bracho y la abuela se alegra y cuando tiene la charla con los nios. Esta demasiado abreviada para lo que contiene la Telenovela, podrian haber dejado mas, tambien note que faltan partes de como Paola obtiene el auto especial para invalidos y todo ese desarrollo. En el Dvd se puede comprender la historia con mucha coherencia, pero me parece que haberle cortado tantas partes le quita credito y esencia a la Novela. Despues contiene la Entrada Original y la musicalizacion tal cual como en la transmision televisiva.
Me hubiese gustado que el Dvd tubiera Subtitulos en Ingles, Extras, Entrevistas, Detras de Camaras, Bloopers y demas, pero no tiene nada mas que Fotos.
La Duracion es de Mas de 400 Minutos en 2 Dvds, uno de Doble Cara y otro Simple, lo cual podrian perfectamente haber hecho los 2 Dobles, y que tubiera mas escenas.",1287705600,,1661,4.731034482758621
2197506,3,B0006Z2NOK,La Usurpadora when it aired was a great soap opera when I purchased the DVD I thought that I was able to enjoy mostly the begining of it.  There were to many important details that were suppose to be included by my opinion of course.,1245369600,,233,4.177777777777778
2197507,5,B0006Z2NOK,The DVD came in great packaging. Very well presented. The DVD ran perfect. Great Picture scene great Quality. It was my first time purchase with amazon and I will be shopping here again.,1219622400,,186,4.666666666666667
2197508,5,B0006Z2NOK,"When I seen this novela I was so glued to the TV I couldn't wait to see it everyday and sat-sun were the worse! I am so very happy they release such a classic on DVD. Granted, it may be edited and short but I think the reason why they did that was because they figured people who are buying it already know what happens. In my case, I wouldn't need the complete novela because I already saw it and I just wouldn't have the time. So this being edited has it's advantages for those who already saw it and loved it. After this novela, Gaby Spanic became one of my favorite spanish actresses! She did such a wonderful job and how brutal she was portraying the mean sister! I highly suggest you invest in this novela!",1213660800,,712,4.204379562043796

2197510,5,B0006Z2NOK,"this was the first spanish primetime soap I saw on Univision.  So, I was pleasantly surprised to watch this abridged version.  it contains most of my favorite parts from the original version.  And what can I say, I love watching Fernando and Gaby act together - they definitely bring the characters to life in a romantic comedy sort of way.",1201564800,,340,4.633333333333334
2197511,5,B0006Z2NOK,"I like this storie a lot, has been remade trhu the years, in this version the great Libertad Lamarque plays the alcoholic matriarch who will be rescued by La Usurpadora ,twin sisters played by Gabriela Spanic portrait the good and the evil, a diverse cast of Latin actors from Mexico,Venezuela Argentina Etc,. the identical double of a rich woman is found by accident and forced to go to her mansion and play the rich's woman role,.the story includes, romance, betrayal, jealousy and much more.",1196985600,,494,4.892857142857143

Fell in love with Fernando Colunga n became addicted 2 the DVD versions of telenovelas.

2197515,5,B0006Z2NOK,"I loved this novela when I was younger... and when I found out that I could buy the DVD set I was ecstatic.  But when you buy this much shorter version, you lose a lot of detail.  I decided to surf the net and I found a great website ""Novelas R Us"" that contains the complete novelas. I just bought Corazon Salvaje (on 20 DVDs) and am going to buy this one (on 19 DVDs). The best thing about it is that they are only 65 dollars each (considering that you get only a few hours for 20 bucks).  I can't wait to receive it.

Although, some people prefer the shorter versions, I like the longer ones because of the details that are missed in the shorter ones.  This novela should be enjoyed in detail and I am certainly going to shop for other favorite novelas of mine.",1175817600,,764,4.135135135135135

2197517,3,B0006Z2NOK,"La Usurpadora was a good novela, but it was edited too much.  Gaby Spanic is excellent! She plays twin sisters, one good, the other bad.  Fernando Colunga , Chantal Andere,  Arturo Peniche are worth watching also.  The story was cut up so badly, now all I want is to see the complete novela! Plus, there's no subtitles at all. Therefore, this is not a classic DVD, but it is a classic novela. I feel I would not recommend it, it's been hacked to pieces! And no subtitles!  I want complete novelas!",1168992000,,497,4.417582417582418
2197518,3,B0006Z2NOK,"I LIKE THIS TELENOVELAS VERY MUCH, especially the acting of Gabriela which i think very great since she must play two role..the story itself was great and not confusing.i have seen this in complete series when it was air on the televesion, but when i was thinking to buy this dvd in order to collected it.. i found that it was totally cut too many scene which i think was important and thats right NO ENGLISH SUBTITLE at all! i have try to play it on player & computer but still no subtitle, so please please to amazon and the xenon or televisa people..please make the complete series and added with subtitle, i'm sure that there are many fan's who wants to buy and collect this telenovela, not even just this one but for the rest telenovelas too. we won't be mine to pay more for that.

2197521,3,B0006Z2NOK,"WARNING: As an insult to Americans (meaning who speak English), this dvd of this great telenovela has no subtitles at all (not even for Spanish! And I read these are really popular in Russia too, so you'd think they would have subtitles). Therefore a complete ripoff for anyone who relies on subtitles. I had to take another star off because of how the telenovela is condensed and not the full series, but I guess that's just how they do these sets for market reasons. Oh well...Gabby Spanic is still fantastic regardless of the dvd shortcomings.",1148342400,,546,4.757894736842105
2197522,4,B0006Z2NOK,"This is a story about two women who are identical and meet each other, without knowing that they are twins. Paola comes from a wealthy family and is married to Carlos Daniel, but she isn't loyal to him and devises a scheme to force her mirror image, Paulina, to impersonate her for a year (while she goes off to travel with her lover). Paulina does her lookalike's family good; she rescues the family's factory and cures Abuela Piedad from alcoholism, but she is later discovered. When Paola returns, Paulina will have to face the consequences. It has no subtitles.",1135468800,,565,4.717171717171717

8043963,3,B0006Z2NOK,"If you have never seen a telenovela, you may like La Usurpadoras better than if you have seen many.  Telenovelas are in a rut of using standard, repeated plot lines (lack of originality).  The plot is utterly impossible and very contrived.  [This could be A SPOILER if U never saw a telenovela before, tho U cannot be sure that all these stock lines are are used in La Usurpadora.]

Possible Stock tropes: Rich vs poor class distinction, servants, cinderella, impossibly-identical twins,(played by 1 actor), unknown/mistaken parentage.  (At start stop to guess who will en up with mistaken parentage whenever U watch a telenovela.)  Also 2 sisters after one man or 2 brothers after 1 woman. All characters lie all the way thru story. Someone pretends to be invalid in wheelchair who can walk. Love at first sight without reason; incest or threatened incest (woman & daughter fornicate with same man). Female protagonist cinderella loves protagonist who is a fornicator, but she doesn't mind.  Male protagonist will be shot (stabbed, etc.). Protagonist gets put in jail / hospital, which has no call button to use when villain tries to do a hospital murder.  Good guys never call 911 if a villain attacks.  If someone is hurt bad, run over, shot etc., instead of calling 911, someone grabs the victim and shakes the body hugging it.  Story ends with wedding.

BTW, Telenovelas are not soap operas since the plots are not unending; the story is long, but comes to an end.

Gaby Spanic, protagonist, is a thin very young lady in this.  She plays a good twin & a bad twin.  (Though in real life she has a twin, Gaby plays both parts herself.) She became type cast in telenovelas as a very bad villainous.  Fernando Colungo IMHO is one of the best telenovela actors. There is some good-acting in this show.  For my taste, it is not all great.  Interestingly, a woman who plays a major supporting role as Colunga's sister, is la otra (adultery partner) vis-a-vis Colunga in Amor Real, a much better Colunga telenovela.

It is quite proper to cut the story, since the original has a lot of blather.  But it really is excessive cutting to try to take a telenovela show ~ a year long & reduce it to a few DVDs.  However, it looks like most of this telenovela is uploaded on the internet  So one way to watch, is to view these DVDs, then watch on internet, skipping past blather. For example, one can skip any parts where servants are reporting to each other what we done seen & flashbacks.  If you watch uploads on internet, you may well find that there are missing episodes.",1518825600,,2566,4.655555555555556

when the evil one comes back, she isn't satisfied that the good one fulfilled the agreement. she plots ways to ruin her life and the lives of her own family just to do bad.",1442188800,,483,4.020833333333333
