3902838,5,B002C39T46,"I bought this for my dad... he is a cheap humor kinda guy... and Michael Loftus is definately funny enough to make my whole family bust up laughing.... So if you don't mind cursing/cheap laughs, you probably will enjoy this.",1347494400,,224,4.625
3902839,5,B002C39T46,"Michael Loftus (of ""World's Dumbest"" fame...) is incredibly underrated as a comedy, i was in stitches throughout.  recently married, i appreciate his viewpoint of being married and everything that comes with in-laws, kids, and married friends.

very funny",1339632000,,255,5.684210526315789
3902840,2,B002C39T46,"I bought this DVD after seeing a ten-minute segment from Michael Loftus on one of the Just For Laughs compilations from the Montreal Comedy Festival. It seems that most of the funniest bits were on the video I saw earlier. This video left me less than impressed - and I was looking forward to seeing it. Loftus seems to be pretty much a one-trick pony, with the vast majority of his material aimed at his wife. I found it more tedious than funny. I will be selling this DVD - if anyone will take it.",1326240000,,499,4.2631578947368425
3902841,5,B002C39T46,"Absolutely worth the price, but be aware that it might not be appropriate for young teens.  Parents should screen the DVD first and make their own determination.  We look forward to Loftus doing another show in the future.",1316476800,2,222,4.815789473684211
3902842,5,B002C39T46,This DVD is the best ab workout I've ever had and I had P90X.  The wife and I have watched it four times with various friends and family.  Every time we're laughing so hard we're in tears.,1293840000,,188,4.054054054054054
3902843,5,B002C39T46,"Michael,

Both Judi and I first saw your performance on the Comedy channel and just laughed until we ached.  We were pulling lines from the show over and over ...... ""you've changed"" .... ""what did I just say"".  It was just a riot and soooo spot on in a frightening way.

Then we lost the recording of it and were so bummed.  We just had to get the full version anyway as we just think it is a classic, to be sure.  I can not remember the last time I had so many flash backs ( well since the 60's anyway) and I am always playing it for someone else to enjoy.

You have set a high standard for your next show and I can not wait to see it.

All the best,

Bob North

8362905,5,B002C39T46,Most comedians say funny stuff to be funny. This guy tells it how it is and its hilarious. He is spot on with damn near all of his jokes. Give this guy a shot if you haven't already. You won't be disappointed.,1358726400,,209,4.0
8362906,3,B002C39T46,I bought this after seeing a special the comic had on TV recently and only catching minutes of it.  During that special I laughed enough to look this guy up and buy this DVD.  It's good his stand up got better.  I would loan this to friend but don't recommend to buy. I wouldn't watch it again.  I will order the special that was on TV when available.  It was really good.,1357603200,,372,4.111111111111111
