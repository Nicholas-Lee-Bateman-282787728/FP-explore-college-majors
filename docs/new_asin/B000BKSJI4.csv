2422869,5,B000BKSJI4,"I have all 5 Sakura Wars games, and as anime nut as well, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this anime is loosely based on the first game released for Sega Saturn and Dreamcast in Japan only. I thought it was awesome to sit there and listen to the story of of the first game, since I cannot read Japanese. My personal opinion is if anyone liked number 5 for PS2, or wii, will enjoy this story of how it all started. I did.",1342656000,,432,4.034883720930233
2422870,5,B000BKSJI4,"Okay, I will keep this review brief since I have not purchased this particular boxed set, but I have watched the series. This series is my second all-time favorite next to Full Metal Alchemist because of the great attention that was paid to character development, BGM selection, art, voice acting...well, my list could go on forever, but my point is that this is truly a fine piece of anime that NO TRUE FAN should be without. I enjoy light-hearted anime like Zero no Tsukaima, Rosario+Vampire, and Mayou Neko Overrun a great deal, but I like titles with more substance too. This series is one of the reasons why I even watch more serious anime. It is a series that can easily appeal to a male and female audience, and you will not be disappointed by the action scenes. If you are an anime fan that likes stronger female characters this is a great series, because the only military troop that can battle the evil Wakiji is all female. If you are not sure about buying Sakura Wars, PLEASE BUY IT. You will NOT regret it.",1327276800,,1019,4.513513513513513
2422871,5,B000BKSJI4,"I don't understand the idea that this is a series for girls.  I am a 58 year old man, and love it.  So much that having viewed the library's copy a half dozen times or more over the years, I had to get my own since the library copy is getting really worn out and missing a couple of disks.  I shouldn't have been such a tightwad and bought the other set.  The idiot who put all the disks on a single spindle should by put against the wall and shot.  (OK, shot with a steam powered creme pie catapult.  No need to go overboard.)",1307923200,5,527,3.9714285714285715
2422872,4,B000BKSJI4,"Sakura Wars is a great collection but the DVD case needs lots of work.
it's ridiculous that someone would aloud these disk to be stacked on top of each other
in a single tab.
It took a while to find the perfect replacement
because certain companies don't sell just one DVD case but will try to
sell you 50 or more.
but i found a replacement booklet DVD case holder with 4 slots for the DVD and
all i had to buy was one, a couple of dollars but well worth it.
if you need to know where to get a replacement
Google u.s. plastic corp and look for the tab DVD cases
it was hard to find an inch think case with 4 slot but its in there
and the graphic sheets fit perfectly in there too",1291161600,5,679,3.927536231884058
2422873,5,B000BKSJI4,"I agree that before watching other Sakura Wars series collections, you must watch this original TV series first. Fujishima Kousuke sensei's anime is always wonderful and never disappoint anyone. Unlike AH! My Goddess, this story is about some evil spirits invading Japan, particularly in Tokyo, battles are more emphasized in Sakura War. Needless to say, it is exciting. In addition, the story also describes the daily lives of the characters. Humors, fantasy and excitment are combined perfectly.",1196899200,7,497,5.467532467532467
2422874,5,B000BKSJI4,"Anyone interested in Sakura Taisen (Sakura Wars) - whether a fan of the games or just interested in the anime - should definitely watch this 5-disc compilation of the entire 25-episode run of the TV series.  Be aware, though, that the story told in the TV series is slightly but significantly different from that told in the OAV (and also from that told in the new manga version, which is now being published in English in the USA).  I definitely recommend watching the TV series BEFORE watching ""Sakura Wars: The Movie"", because otherwise the latter won't make much sense to you at all and the TV series provides a tremendous amount of character development missing from the OVA. (Also, I strongly recommend watching the TV series and the movie both before watching ""Sakura Taisen: Ecole de Paris"", since that particular anime takes place in the timeframe between the series and the movie.)

Note also: the TV series has a lot of emotional heft to it and can get dark, almost somber in places, but I don't think it's much of a spoiler to say that everything works out in the end.  HOW it works out, though, you'll just have to watch to find out! :)

P.S. On further thought, I wanted to put in a word here about the alternate-history background of this anime.  Sakura Wars takes place in a timeline where steam appears to have become the dominant method of power generation and propulsion (right down to steam-powered telephones!!) and also where technology in this version of the 1920's is up to at least 1990's levels (computerlike machines and some form of virtual reality simulator are seen being used in several scenes, and there is obviously some kind of video technology as well).  Also, socially and politically, the 1920's Japan of Sakura Wars seems to be a very different place from the 1920's Japan of our ""real"" time line - in fact, according to the new English translation of the manga, the characters for the Imperial era ""Taisho"" used in this series translate to ""Broad Truth"" in English, not ""Great Truth"" as in our actual history.  Something to be aware of as you watch the show.",1141084800,45,2097,4.694822888283379
2422895,3,B000BKSJI4,"This just does not live up to the splurge on the back cover ""MECHA action.""  Good luck waiting for that to happen. And wait you will as this thing is slow. Four discs (all stacked together - what moron decided on that arrangement?) with slow pacing and endless flashbacks. You have the supernatural, military, steam-powered armored suits with little girls as the drivers, alternate universe and the worst thing of all - theater!  You will have to slog through the first two discs before any real mecha action happens and even then it is only the first two episodes. So if you were hoping for four discs of mecha action you can forget it. Too bad as the spirit suits are a great design.  Build a model of one and have way more fun than trying to watch this.",1393113600,5,756,4.424460431654676
2422896,5,B000BKSJI4,Much diffrences between this version and the adv 2 volume set. Story is different and the dub is ok. I loved the series over all.,1392940800,2,129,4.2

2422898,4,B000BKSJI4,"I enjoy the Sakura Wars series because of their technology that is used to fight demons.  It somewhat reminds me of the Armor of God, in the book of Ephesians that is needed to fight Satan.  Therefore, it is a nice anime show to look at.

2422899,5,B000BKSJI4,Well I'm not gonig to tell you about what this anime is about if you want to know what the anime is about go to Wikipedia or animenetwork to read a descritiption now with that said Ill have to say that I recommend this series to anyone it might look a little girlish but believe this anime is worth your time. PD: Why are you even reading this just go ahead and buy it NAO!!!!!!!!!,1376956800,,381,4.093333333333334

2422901,5,B000BKSJI4,"this is my first official entry to the sakura wars series & its fun , worth the time & splended to watch

if known this anime for along time but never had the chance to get into nor the games but Project X Zone finally changed my mind  so i get this lovley dvd set for starters

first of all i didicate myself into the lovley art of Kosuke Fujishima  since i love the Tales of  games as also i adore the anime series Your under arrest to death  and a few month back i got into Oh My Godess  so i knew what i was getting into

the show is wonderfull  i enjoyed it & loved it  now i want more out of sakura wars  & hope in the future the other series gets localized .

a recomended starting point for starting  watching this franchise
i have to say the cast are so lovable and colorful  , from the natural beauty that is sakura , the lovely sumire ( i dig her hair style  ) , iris the little munchkin  , strong & bad ass maria  ,  funny girl kana who i tought she was a guy at first glance  ,  and last but not least brainy girl koran

its mainly the focus of the beautiful sakura to build her self up and try her best , while also enteracting with the other cast  an many adventures  ,  decisive batles  , and also making thier on stage performences in a way for them to get better and stronger

i wish thier stage acts where extra features of the show they kinda look promising

art wise it  is lovely , music is amazing at most of the time ,  just love the cast  story is great  as it tries build up the cast  in its own fasion  just wish iris got into the action battles more offten  which are not brutal but enough to satisfy on what it offers .",1374537600,2,1648,3.893939393939394
2422902,4,B000BKSJI4,An old anime from the early 2000's.  Basic plot is Japan is attacked by evil monsters and its set in the middle of the 1920's.  Young girls of some military organization in giant robots are set in to stop these monsters.  I can say the whole thing is okay.  Also its based on a video game franchise few hear about but I found this title great unlike most things based on video games this is also the exception.  I can highly recommend it.,1369958400,,438,4.228915662650603
2422903,5,B000BKSJI4,"I would say Sakura Wars is in a ""hybrid"" genre. It has a Shjo aspect in that it takes place at a theatrical school; yet it has a Shnen element in that the girls end up fighting in giant robots. In this same genre I would put Bubblegum Crisis, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Silent Mobius, Burst Angel, Full Metal Panic!, and Aquarion; just to name a few; as they feature the day-today life of their protagonists more than they show them in battle.

This gives them more of the character driven dramatics of Shjo rather than the conflict driven action of Shnen, and thus perhaps their wider appeal than say... Dragon Ball Z, GT, Kai, etc, and Bleach which have battles that last several episodes. I'll take soul searching angst and pithy dialog over flying fists and school-yard insults any day, thank you.",1362787200,3,799,4.626760563380282
2422904,3,B000BKSJI4,"Sakura is the daughter of a war hero. She has arrived in the Imperial Capital to take up the fight against the hoards of demons that seek to destroy it. When she gets there, she is surprised to find out that the elite unit of mecha pilots she is now a part of is also a performing troop. Not only does she have to learn how to pilot her mecha, she has to learn the stage.

The rest of the troop is skeptical of her at best. There are 5 other members of the troop. they are all women, including a 9-year-old child. After a miserable failure, they receive a young male captain to help them with their teamwork and leadership issues. It takes a while, but Sakura begins to blend in and is a vital part of the team. The odds are stacked against them. The demons have a leader that has a pension for death, and a surprising tie to the elite group's past.

I bought this because there were only raving reviews. I was very disappointed. This anime didn't have a lot to offer. While the story was pretty good, and there were some fairly interesting characters, it fell short of anything great. My first complaint is the animation. I realize that this was made in 1999, but the animation is below par even for that era. I was, however, impressed with the attention to detail in the backgrounds. It's kind of strange that the backgrounds were done well, but the character animation was sloppy, colored poorly, and fuzzy at times.

My second complaint is the terrible voice cast. This is one of the worst English dubs I've ever heard. It's up there with the likes of Fantastic Children and Legend of Crystania. The Japanese voice cast is pretty good, but I don't like to read subtitles. A lot is lost in translation, when you're just reading words instead of hearing someone speak you're language.

The story isn't bad, it took me about 13 episodes or so to get into it. There is a lot of fluff. The characters got a little background treatment, but not that much. There were a few twists thrown in there to keep you interested. The battle scenes were okay. I am not a big mecha fan, but this one didn't focus as much on the robots as many other shows do. That's a good thing in my opinion.

Overall, I can't think of one thing that made this series stand out. It's one of those that gets swallowed up on your shelf and only gets noticed every once on a while, but you think to yourself ""I think I'll watch something better today."" Sakura Wars reminded me a lot of Silent Mobius. If you have seen that, then you know what to expect from Sakura Wars. This anime isn't bad , but there is no way that it is worthy of 5 stars. I see all the 5 star reviews, and I can't believe it. No part of this series is that good. I recommend watching it online or renting it before you buy. I wish I had. Now I've wasted money because of over hyped reviews. This just goes to show you that everyone has different perception and standards for what they call ""good anime"".",1358121600,3,2943,4.295495495495495

8088057,5,B000BKSJI4,Terrific Story and you find yourself becoming attached to all of the primary characters. Graphics were excellent. Lengthy primary series that runs over 600 minutes in 24 episodes. Be sure and track down the subsequent OVA movie (runs almost two hours) and the two follow up short story DVD's to have a complete set. Definitely a 5-star package.,1461974400,,344,4.948275862068965
8088058,4,B000BKSJI4,"I really love the manga series, but it's different from the anime. It's an older anime, which makes it very charming. (I love the theme song.)
If you're a fan of the series, it's definitely something you should pick up.",1458086400,,219,4.5
8088059,4,B000BKSJI4,"Nothing that combines steampunk and pretty anime girls can be all bad, and this TV series loosely based upon the never released in American first Sakura Wars video game is not bad at all.  The true identities and motives of the villains are clever and well thought out, as is the transformation of a bunch of girls into an elite military unit, and the little details of this Steampunk alternate history Tokyo make for a lot of fun.

Defects? Unfortunately, yes.  The most obvious problem is the very poor pacing of this serial.  Arguably, the best paced anime serial of all time is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mysterious-Cities-of-Gold/dp/B001QKB2XC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mysterious Cities of Gold</a>, in which not a single episode is wasted. Every episode sees an important clue discovered or deciphered, an important lock unlocked, an important tool acquired or learned more about, an important piece of knowledge obtained, an important ally won or a dangerous enemy thwarted, a significant character development or team building exercise, or at the very least, significant physical progress being made on a journey stretching from Barcelona to the land of the Incas to the Amazon jungle to the land of the Mayas.  The worst paced is arguably&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nadia-The-Secret-of-Blue-Water/dp/B00GY71GHE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water</a>&nbsp;in which NHK demanded the creation of 12 extra episodes in order to stretch the series to 39 episodes; the universal consensus is that they are just awful and that they stop the series dead in its tracks.

Sakura Wars is closer to the latter than the former IMHO.  The series has an intriguing beginning, a rousing and heroic ending, some interesting episodes in between, but a number of other episodes that are pure filler.  Seriously, how many times must we watch Sakura experience Yet Another Crisis of Confidence?  How many times must we endure Yet Another one of Sumire's over-the-top rhymes-with-witch-fests?  I think close to half of this series could have been edited out in order to improve it, or better yet replaced with more interesting material, like maybe the back stories of some of the lesser characters such as the Wind Division girls who in the current version I can't even tell apart.  A perfect example of what's wrong is episode 10: ""The Kanna that Summons a Storm"" in which Kanna and Sumire square off over whether Kanna's senses based weather forecasting is more or less accurate than Kanzaki Heavy Industries' state of the art scientific forecasting.  There was potential for some sort of a story here, but in the end both methods got the forecast identically wrong so what was the point?

Other lesser issues involve the total lack of any sort of romance or romantic interest or even romantic tension; Captain Ohgami might as well have been just another girl as far as the troupe was concerned.  Finally, no serious attempt was made to justify having the Flower Division's ""cover"" be as an acting troupe.  Not only was it too public to fool anybody paying attention, but  it used up too much time and energy that would have been put to better use training to fight.

Bottom line; it wasn't terrible, but it was a lot less good than it could have been.

Note: The TV series varies rather significantly from the plot of the first game, which means it varies from most other Sakura Wars or Sakura Taisen anime that follow the games more closely such as the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sakura-Wars-OVA/dp/B000031EG8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sakura Wars OVA</a>, the OVA series:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sakura-Wars-2-OVA-Return-of-the-Spirit-Warriors-Vol-1/dp/B00006CY4C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sakura Wars 2 OVA - Return of the Spirit Warriors (Vol. 1)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sakura-Wars-2-OVA-Wedding-Bells-Vol-2/dp/B00006CY4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sakura Wars 2 OVA - Wedding Bells (Vol. 2)</a>, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sakura-Taisen-Ecole-De-Paris-OVA/dp/B0009HLDDW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sakura Taisen - Ecole De Paris OVA</a>, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sakura-Wars-Movie/dp/B00E00GC3A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sakura Wars: Movie</a>, and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sakura-Taisen-Sumire-OVA/dp/B0000C7PSU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sakura Taisen: Sumire OVA</a>.",1455753600,,4729,6.515151515151516
