8528838,4,B008L1VZNQ,"I liked this production very much, especially the staging (by Daniele Abbado - yes, the son of Claudio A.), set & costumes, and the musical direction (cond. Michele Mariotti). There are some good singing too, not least from Abigaille, the leading lady, sung by Dimitra Theodossiou. Leo Nucci in the title role is OK, but he sounds perhaps a little aged (he was 67 at the time of recording). I beleive that there are stronger casts, but the production as a whole will disappoint few. There is some problems with the focus of the chorus in ""Va pensiero"" - they are too much in the background. I have seen two other performances of Nabucco on DVD - Arena di Verona from 1981 with Renato Bruson in the title role, and Wiener Staatsoper 2001 with Leo Nucci. The latter suffers from a very ""stripped"" staging with modern costumes (""eurotrash""), while the former probably beats the present production in many respects, especially regarding the soloists. But the sound and the picture are not as good as the present Blu ray. I have not heard (or seen) the Metropolitan production on DG.",1377993600,6,1078,4.708994708994709
8528839,3,B008L1VZNQ,"The failure of Verdi's second opera "" Un Giorno di Regno"" in 1840 was one of the bitterest disappointments in Verdi's life. This on top of the death of Verdi's first wife Margharita Barezzi also in 1840 he swore to never write opera again. His chance meeting with the impresario Bartolomeo Merreli, his mentor and friend resulted in him considering a text refused by other composers of Nabucco. He again refused but later relented and this Nabucco is the result. Here he demonstrates a mastery of large choral forces, vocal contrasts and somewhat static dramatic effects (these will be refined in subsequent operas). All this captivated the audience in 1842 at La Scalla. It was and still is a triumph. In it we do not have the well crafted dramas that will begin with Ernani but we do have episodic high drama with massed chorus to move the plot along. We do have great vocal scoring for the three major characters: Nabucodonosor (later shortened to Nabucco) who is Primo Baritono (a voice type Verdi was always to favor), The High Priest of the Hebrews, Zaccaria, Primo Basso and Nabucco's evil daughter (later found to be a child of slaves) Abigaille Prima Donna Soprano. Audiences at the time liked biblical stories where good and God always win the day. And of course, the famous chorus ""Va piensiero"" of the Hebrew slaves found resonance in the struggle for the unification of the nation of Italy and the freedom from the oppressive Austrians.
This production is certainly a mixed bag. The one shining thing is the orchestra and it's conductor. This is the house orchestra of the Parma Opera House and in this recording really sounds great. (I've heard it under the direction of other conductors when the product was not so good) I assume it is the leadership of Michele Mariotti that makes the difference. He is on top of every note and in firm control. The solo riffs from the orchestra players, flute, cello etc are all done very well.
The scenery is another matter. This appears to have been done on the cheap. The sets seem to have been gathered from other productions and jumbled together haphazardly. The same with the costumes only a few players got to wear something half-way appropriate  to the drama, the others had on Hathaway shirts and black ties e.g. Zaccaria had on an apron with things on it. At first he looked like a Hot Dog seller at a Baseball park. (His acting could have passed for one). In the chorus of the Hebrews the members have on yulmacas (sp?) as Jews should, but when singing the chorus of the Baal worshipers they had on the same gear (Not Kosher!)
The singers were a mixed bag also. Leo Nucci took awhile to warm up but when he did - wow! A masterful portrayal. The part of Zaccaria calls for a Basso Primo. Riccardo Zanellato is certainly a bass and a good one. But his acting is not ""Primo"". The nice sister Fenena had a nice voice done by Anna Maria Chiuri but was so stiff she looked like a walking manikin. Dimitra Theodossiou is an audience favorite in Italy. She belted out a few numbers without much feeling. She looked bored, tired and uninvolved. But the audience apparently loved it. Oh well! I loved the music and the orchestra.
One star for the orchestra, one star for the conductor and one for Leo Nucci.",1372291200,6,3258,4.617241379310345

8528841,5,B008L1VZNQ,"I had the pleasure of attending this performance in Verona. It was fantastic! Linda puts the real fire into this character.  Linda and husband Peter went out to dinner with us after having the cast sign one of the posters for us. Have known Linda and Peter for several years, and they are extremely great artists.",1292716800,3,313,4.589285714285714
