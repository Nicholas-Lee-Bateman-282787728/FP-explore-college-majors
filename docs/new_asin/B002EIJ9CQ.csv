8367718,4,B002EIJ9CQ,This DVD is mostly rememberances from Jimi's brother Leon.  I love Leon and I am glad that he can get a piece of the pie as he has been left out of the will.  The interview with Ed Chalpin was hard for me to watch based on the heartache he caused Jimi during his life. I liked the DVD as I am an avid fan of Jimi's and I was not disappointed.,1263772800,7,342,3.736111111111111
