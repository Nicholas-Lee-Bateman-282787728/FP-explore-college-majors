3644112,1,B001HUHBAY,"Cheers is my favorite show of all time, however when they came out with the DVD's I have been disappointed time after time again with the lack of quality. Every other show has many extras, are presented in great quality with better sound and just make the show even better overall. Cheers seasons 5-11 all lack these things. No cast interviews, no commentaries, and with this season (One of the biggest finale's of television history) you had tons of late night cast interviews, television specials and a behind the scenes pre-show that would optimize the DVD experience. NONE were found here, just the episodes in fullscreen (a few look as if they were transferred from a grainy version)with inferior sound quality and missing some scenes. This packaging they have adopted since season nine looks like something one of my teenagers made for a pirated version. A major disappointment, CBS video or whoever is responsible for this cheap strip-down DVD series have ruined what could have been a great opportunity for fans.",1236211200,19,1020,4.970760233918129

3644114,5,B001HUHBAY,"Let me start with one small but touching piece of information that one of my sons passed along to me.

The picture of Geronimo that Sam adjusts at the very end of the final episode is a picture that was actually hanging in Nicholas Colosanto's (who played Coach) house. It was moved to the set as a reminder of and tribute to him and Sam's straightening it at the end is one final, touching reference to Coach and Colosanto himself.

As to the final season, my recollection is that it was a strong season despite the series' age -- far from the best season, but certainly worth the money for any fan of the show. The series finale is one of the better ones -- in my view, second among comedies only to Newhart's ""bad dream"" finale -- that rings true and is, mostly, funny and in the end just serious and touching enough to satisfy.",1232668800,2,831,4.32051282051282
3644115,3,B001HUHBAY,"Though this DVD set does not release until next week, I was able to purchase it from a local store yesterday.  I purchased this season set for the final (3-part) episode, which I watched last night.  Another reviewer stated that certain scenes in this episode are missing; I can't vouch for that as I do not intimately recall the aired finale nor do I have it on VHS.  What I would like to make known is the substandard quality of the final episode itself. Though the majority of the episode is fine (similar in quality to that of the first 5 seasons which I own), several specific scenes look like they were taken from poor quality VHS tapes and spliced into the episode to make it the original length.  When the episode shifts to one of these scenes, it is very jarring and watching these scenes is irritating.  I cannot believe that a television episode that aired only 15 years ago can look so bad.",1232668800,12,902,4.442424242424242
3644116,4,B001HUHBAY,"I am looking forward to this final season of Cheers, but I read on another site from someone who got the season early, and the series finale is missing certain scenes as well as Rebecca Gaines, Rebecca Loses (which is missing about a minute).  The finale was missing about a minute of Alan and Paul commenting on The Ninja Turtles and LL Cool J, as well as Rebecca getting a goodbye kiss from Sam near the end.  Just thought I would pass this along.",1232409600,8,449,4.333333333333333
3644117,5,B001HUHBAY,"The 92-93 season of Cheers, its last, is one of its best. For one thing, at this point everyone's story must be wrapped up, so there is quite a bit of action in the comedy this season. Woody, married at the end of the tenth season, has a few surprises in store, professionally and personally. Frasier conducts an experiment that results in Woody's election to city council. With Woody being the dangerous combination of likable and uninformed, Frasier has nightmares when he begins dwelling on Woody's possible future in politics. Frasier and Lillith break up and then reunite several months later - the reason will surprise you. Rebecca finally meets and marries the man of her dreams at the end of the season. Again, you'll be surprised who she chooses considering her gold-digging past.

The feud between Gary's Old Town Tavern and Cheers erupts once again, and Cheers brings in Harry the Hat (Harry Anderson) to help them out. This is the season after Harry Anderson's long-running series ""Night Court"" ended. Anderson first appeared on Cheers back in season one before Night Court began, and it is great to have him back one last time.

The final episode brings Diane Chambers back to the scene for the first time since she left for six months to write her book back in 1987. She has an interesting explanation of how six months turned into six years. Will she and Sam finally get back together? Seeing Shelley Long's Diane Chambers back on Cheers reassured me of one thing. Although it was the perfect finish to have her as part of the show's conclusion, her decision to leave after five seasons bought the show several seasons that they would not have had otherwise. Diane Chamber's part in the Cheers saga had been played well but it was played out, and Rebecca Howe and her own unique set of eccentricities made a completely different foil for Sam and the Cheers gang.

The story is ended for all but one - Frasier Crane. His character goes on to star in eleven seasons of ""Frasier"", and results in Frasier tying Marshall Dillon of ""Gunsmoke"" as the longest running TV characters of all time - 20 years each.",1226102400,21,2117,4.7008086253369274
3644118,5,B001HUHBAY,"Cheers has gone down as one of the all time classics, up there with lucy and honeymooners. not many people that i talk to have negative things to say about cheers. True, i think they should have ended the show after the ninth as the story line got old, but i love cheers. it is my favorite and will always be. i already have the first 8 seasons. so now i will get 9-11
all at once in january when the 11th season is released. i hope they do not do any cuts on the very final episode. just a final note. although the series went downhill a bit after the 9th year, they ended the show very well. Sam alone in the bar realizing how happy and lucky he is, despite never getting married. i thing keeping sam unmarried was the smart thing to do. if he was to marry anyone, it should have been Diane and that would have ended the show after 5 years. i liked the final scene where sam saw someone knocking at the door and he raised his hand, saying
""Sorry, we're closed.
Cheers to Cheers. An everlasting classic",1226016000,21,1003,4.148717948717949

3644120,3,B001HUHBAY,"Cheers final season wrapped eleven years of laughter and memories. Cheers was the biggest comedy series from the early eighties to the early nineties. With the finest ensemble on television,  everybody's favorite bar includes Ted Danson (CSI, Becker); Kirstie Alley (Look Who's Talking); Rhea Perlman (Taxi, Matilda); and Woody Harrelson (Natural Born Killers) as everybody's favorite bar employees. Of course, you can't forget regular barflies, John Ratzenberger (Pixar); George Wendt; and Kelsey Grammer (Frasier).

With the best cast perhaps ever assembled on television, they get ready to end a phenomenal eleven year run. When Cheers began in 1982, it was early canceled because of low ratings. Thankfully Brandon Tartikoff (NBC leader) liked it and kept it on the schedule. The series would win Emmys and Golden Globe Awards.

The end of the series brought back Emmy winner Shelley Long to reprise her role as Diane Chambers in the final episodes. Other memorable guest stars include John Mahoney, Peri Gilpin, Sharon Lawrence, Roger Rees, Robert Prosky, France's Sternhagen, Paul Willson, Bebe Neuwirth, etc.

No commentaries or special features especially from the final season. There was plenty when the series ending in the early nineties. Jay Leno and the Tonight Show did a live memorable episode in Boston, Massachusetts. The cast made the cover of Life magazine and the finale was an epic event viewed by millions long before DVR. It was the end of the series and an era in television history. The final season DVD deserved better for the fans and future fans to discover this series.",1455840000,,1598,5.206225680933852
3644121,3,B001HUHBAY,"I bought Season 11 on Vudu for one reason, to see how the finale wrapped up the Sam/Diane relationship. I was never a fan of the Rebecca Howe years. Well, I understand why the writers made the choice they did to have Sam's ultimate 'true love' be the BAR rather than a human being - but it was definitely a heartbreaking decision on their part. To have Sam saying, in the last moments, 'Sorry, we're closed,' as he forlornly gazed out the window at a late-comer - with all of his regulars having gone home to their families - is just gut-wrenching.

Of course, not everyone has to be married or have a family - and perhaps Sam Malone would have been more fulfilled, after all, with his adopted family of barflies.

But when you've got Diane Chambers waltzing into the bar after a six year absence- looking like she's been living the yoga-and-kale-shakes life in LA (check out her legs!) - and now a successful screenwriter - and she and Sam still seem to have the magic, how does it make any sense whatsoever that they wouldn't at least take a chance at love again?

I love the speech Sam gives the bar regulars (Norm, Cliff, Frasier, Carla, etc), saying that he's not their mommy - and while they all have someone to go home to at night, he doesn't, and he wants that for himself. To see how selfishly they reacted to the announcement that he was moving to LA - especially when Norm whines 'What will happen to us?' - really stripped bare for me how adolescent these characters were. All of them had always been so down on Sam and Diane - sure, the characters argued, but they also saw each other through tough times, and over the years, learned to communicate and accept each other's foibles.

[I have to take a moment here to note Kelsey Grammer's impeccable comedic timing - when he's staring at the awards show in which Diane has just appeared and tells Sam 'Look to her right' - that's a line with no perceptible joke on paper - yet Grammer's delivery is so funny, the audience explodes.]

I choose to think of the ending as Sam and Diane on the plane - and the series stopping just as Sam cracks his joke about them joining the Mile High Club and Diane breaks into hysterical laughter. That was always the glue of their relationship, if you ask me - not sex, but laughter. There wasn't a day that went by that the two of them weren't smiling at each other's jokes, even if it was at their own expense.

What comes after - Sam suddenly questioning whether or not he TRULY loves Diane (does that really matter at this point in the game, when you've got hot sex, laughter, and some semblance of compatibility?) and Diane ruminating on Sam's 'mediocrity' (years after Diane seemed to wholeheartedly accept that Sam was never going to be Albert Einstein). The thoughts each has about the other seemed to be unnecessarily cruel.

I read that the writers decided to keep them apart so that Rebecca fans wouldn't get angry - but yet they give Rebecca a husband, and Sam a bar.

Anyway, I understand why the writers went the way they did - it made the most sense in the context of Sam's long-standing inability to commit to anything or anyone except Cheers - but that doesn't mean I have to like it!",1448323200,2,3197,4.434412265758092

3644138,4,B001HUHBAY,"Great show, outstanding characters and plenty of laughs. Unfortunately, they are running out of story lines in the 11th season and the end is near. The show never really jumped the shark, but it was coming is the show wasn't ended. Many episodes now take place outside of the bar. I guess they could only write so many bar episodes before running out of ideas. But this is till my all time favorite show with lots of replay value. But the syndicated reruns don't show too many of the 11th season episodes, so I am glad I got to see them again. Cheers!",1396137600,,551,4.359223300970874

There have been a lot of sitcoms that I have loved over the years, but this is the only one that truly finished strong.

MASH's ending annoyed me.  Friends' was so-so.  Seinfeld's annoyed me.  ALF didn't really end. Most of these shows weren't  especially memorable for me.

3644143,5,B001HUHBAY,"Cheers was one of the greatest sitcoms of the 80's.  This last and final season, as with many last seasons, didn't represent the comedic genius of the writers.

3644145,5,B001HUHBAY,"Both cheers and Frasier had eleven year runs.  That is an accomplishment which requires a tremendous amount of talent in all areas of production, and cheers certainly had that. I believe that it is necessary to watch each season in order to know the regulars at the bar. The last season perhaps was not the best, but I could not rate it any less than 5 stars.",1379548800,,359,4.358208955223881
3644146,4,B001HUHBAY,"That final line, uttered by leading actor Ted Danson, sums up the bittersweet 11-year run of one of television's greatest situation comedies.  It is one of those rare TV moments not easily forgotten, much like a year earlier when a tearful Bea Arthur on The Golden Girls said, ""You'll always be my sisters...always.""  The three-part series finale of Cheers, appropriately titled ""One for the Road,"" originally aired on May 20, 1993, and is (as of this writing) the second-highest-rated series finale of all time, behind that of M*A*S*H.  It's easy to see why:  1) the superb script by creators/brothers Glen and Les Charles; and 2) the long-awaited return of former leading actress Shelley Long as Diane Chambers, to wrap up the Sam and Diane romance once and for all.

Aside from the finale (which btw is an edited version), Season 11 contained only a handful of what I would consider ""great"" episodes:  ""The Beer Is Always Greener,"" ""Feelings...Whoa, Whoa, Whoa"" and ""Is There a Doctor in the Howe?""  The remaining episodes, to me at least, could have been a little stronger.  However, I thought actress Dana Delany was delightful in ""Love Me, Love My Car.""  Her performance as Susan, the widowed kindergarten teacher whom Sam deceives, was exceptional and very natural.

What disappointed me most about Season 11 was the estrangement of Frasier and Lilith.  I loved these two characters together; they were made for each other.  Their breakup, which spanned two episodes, was painful to watch and seemed rushed and out of character.  For example, I don't believe for a moment that Lilith would abandon her child.  Although actress Bebe Neuwirth appeared in only six episodes in Season 11 - two of which were fleeting appearances - I wish the writers had kept them together throughout this final season.  (Then again, ""Is There a Doctor in the Howe?"" would not have been as great an episode had there been no estrangement.)

Also disappointing was the lack of extras / special features.  It would have been nice to have cast and crew interviews commemorating not only the final season but the series as a whole.

Nevertheless, Cheers is television comedy at its finest.  With Season 11 available on DVD, your collection is complete.  So, raise your glasses and offer a toast:  ""Cheers to Cheers...thank you for the heartwarming memories of a little bar in Boston where everybody knows your name."" :)",1376611200,2,2401,4.937655860349127

3644149,5,B001HUHBAY,"It's bit ironic to see the genuine American culture from a bunch of losers being stupid together in a bar. Diana, British inherited intelligent stupid. Sam, true American indigenous street pretended stupid. I finished first 5 seasons and jumped straight to the last 3 episodes of the last season. (I did watch seasons 6-11 on and off when it's on TV in the 90's) Diana and Sam are a mismatch yet perfect union of love and life. What is the meaning of life? In the finale Karla said the realist - make babies and realize the ultimate goal of survival of the human race. Norm said the idealist - love without judgment. Woody said the best - why change? It's pity that most people are brainwashed with this stupidest idea in the history of human race - ""Change the world."" At the end of the day, Cheers is only Sam and the regulars dream world that doesn't exist in the American culture in reality. Why? Because nobody wants to be losers.

The final episode is STILL the second most watched series finale of all time behind only M*A*S*H's, which was also great. Classic episodes include ""Little Match Girl"", and ""Look Before You Sleep"", and too many more to mention. Ted Danson won his second Emmy for best actor(Should've been his 4th or 5th, I think), for the classic episode ""The Guy Can't Help It"" as well. I don't think any show in the history of television ever maintained the quality throughout a long run like Cheers did. Of course, only a handful even lasted 11 seasons. I think Cheers is, by far the greatest show ever on television, and unfortunately nowadays, seems relatively forgotten. I wish there were a bunch of extras on the 11th Season set. There was a lot of hoopla surrounding Cheers coming to an end. The Bob Costas special would have been nice. The Mayor of Bston declaring a Cheers day in Boston would also have been a neat extra.

3644169,5,B001HUHBAY,"After having watched all of the previous seasons on DVD, it was bittersweet to watch this one. On the one hand, the quality was high, the stories were good, the laughs were funny and most of the characters we came to love over the previous ten seasons were the same as always. On the other hand it's sad to know this was it. In the finale the characters debate whether or not Cheers is their home, but for a fan of the series it is just like home. The show rarely left the bar and in spite of different characters that came and went, it was always as comfortable as home. It's amazing how eleven years of the same setting and more or less the same characters could seem fresh after all that time, but this season does not disappoint. There were episodes that made me laugh and there were very few moments that made me cringe. If you are a fan of Cheers you will want to own this season. It may have been the end of a good run, but it went out on a high note. I especially liked the development of the Frasier character who went on from this show to have a long-running and successful show of his own and while the Frasier of the new show was somewhat different that the Frasier of Cheers, there is a continuity in the basic personality and demeanor. Curiously this final season included a few bit parts for actors who would go on to start in Frasier as his dad and his producer. It's a little odd seeing them here as different characters but interesting nonetheless.",1311638400,,1466,4.276978417266187

3644171,5,B001HUHBAY,"Seeing Diane in the last 3-part episode just blew me away.  I loved the Diane years.  I liked many of the Rebecca ones as well.  So to see them all on the screen in one last shebang was just the cherry on the top.  Season 9 is really one of the best seasons.  All of disc 1 is a winner.  Disc 2 has a few weaker ones.  Disc 3 gets strong again with some interesting prospects for Woody, and disc 4 sees the show end in such excellent form you can only shake your head and wish it wasn't so.  Cheers gets deeper than usual in its last season with Sam seeking new meaning in his life - he joins a sex addicts therapy group even.  Hilarious, but you can tell the writers are digging into some real issues for him at this point in his life. Cheers never did shy away from those in its own way, and they do give the show and the stories a good sense of direction this last season.  Was sorry to see it end when it did.  I'd have settled for a middle aged Sam going through issues.  Cheers was a great show.  This and ""All in the Family"" are my favorites of the 20th century.",1303084800,,1069,3.9624413145539905

3644173,4,B001HUHBAY,"One particular episode I remember was pertaining to the ongoing fued between Gary's Old Town tavern and Cheers. I believe this was in, or near, the final season when aired. In this episode Sam recalls when everyone in Cheers was involved in the gag that convinced Sam that Gary had actually died. He got even with his own gang in this episode by having a bus dump off some of the gang in the middle of nowhere with only only a phone near by. The gang calls Cheers where Sam answers and basically says ""Remember......... GOTCHA !"". That was a great episode that I haven't seen on the DVDs and I own all 11 seasons. There is another episode too pertaining to the time frame when lillith ran off with Dr Pascel that seems to be missing as well.",1270252800,,741,4.338129496402877

3644176,5,B001HUHBAY,"Cheers was one of the best sitcoms ever made and I recall what a sad day it was when that final episode aired and the show would be no more.  Now with all of the seasons in my library I can relive all those funny moments.  The final season does not disappoint, and I believe this is one of the few sitcoms that ended with a strong season.  So often a sitcom comes to an end when the episodes no longer entertain and the laughs stop, but the final season of Cheers is one that I can watch repeatedly and enjoy as much as the previous seasons.",1253059200,,541,4.037383177570093
