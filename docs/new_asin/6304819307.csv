7878144,4,6304819307,"A young boy, Who's the son of a wealthy businessman [James Mason], is kidnapped and held for ransom. With him, Another young boy, Who's the son of a poor mechanic [Luc Merenda], Is kidnapped and held for ransom. Before the police or anyone could do anything about it, The 2 boys are murdered and the mechanic decides to hop on his motorcycle and look for the people responsible for the murder of his son as well as the murder of the businessman's son. I saw this movie one very late night on the local fox affiliate channel down here and i ended up staying up all night to see the whole thing! This movie is action-packed, Has a story that's full of thrills, and The movie never gets boring. Unfortunately, This movie is not on dvd right now. I'm praying real hard to god that one of these little movie companies gets the rights to bring this movie to dvd because i want a copy of this movie bad and i really don't like watching movies on tapes anymore. I hope someone out there who owns a movie distribution company reads this review and decides to put this movie on dvd because this movie is better than a lot of the garbage action films that're flooding hollywood today. Hope the review helped. I'm out.",1135468800,4,1206,4.388392857142857

HAS GOOD ACTION, DECENT ACTING, AND IT DOES HAVE A SUSPENSEFUL SCRIPT. THIS FORGOTTEN FLICK IS DEFINITELY WORTH A WATCH AND IF THEY EVER DO RELEASE A DVD FOR THIS MOVIEE, I JUST MIGHT THINK OF BUYING IT. A WORTHY EFFORT.",1084492800,5,334,4.491803278688525
