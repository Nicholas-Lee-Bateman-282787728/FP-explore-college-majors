8715448,1,B00X99CBXI,"Since so many Franco films are finally getting reissues of higher quality and better packaging, to give some context, these are the Franco movies I have watched so far: Eugenie De Sade, Countess Perverse, Eugenie: The Story of Her Journey Into Perversion, Succubus, A Virgin Among the Living Dead, Vampyros Lesbos, How To Seduce A Virgin, Lorna The Exorcist, She Killed In Ecstasy, Nightmares Come at Night, Venus In Furs and now THIS.

The Erotic Rites of Frankenstein is by FAR the WORST of the Franco films I've watched.

I've enjoyed most of the Franco films I've watched so far, even the flawed ones - but I can plainly see his strengths. Fantastic on location shooting of beautiful and exotic locales, including great houses, castles and villas, always heightened by vintage period decor. Beautifully composed camera angles that shift from ""you are there"" casualness to highly arty and stylized shots that are like paintings. A quirky, but direct use of a fast zoom (a trademark!) Game and interesting actors and (with the women especially) mostly sexy ones. A deft mix of different genre styles: Erotic cinema, thriller, horror, detective, camp. An emphasis on fantasy and the lush. Without a doubt, he is one of the best curators of soundtrack music for his own films. Almost every Franco film has an incredible score.

Unfortunately this movie fails in almost every aspect. It's not scary or spooky. The frankenstein monster is not compelling. Ridiculous low-budget effects and set dressing. A weak plot. Things that champions of Franco will say are purposely camp - but don't be fooled - it's just shoddy execution.
As a comparison it does not have the decrepit perversion of something like Lorna the Exorcist, isn't as strangely arty as Nightmares Come at Night, nor is it as sexy or entertaining as either Eugenie movie. It doesn't have the dream-like quality of A Virgin Among the Living Dead or exotic and enigmatic quality of Venus in Furs.  Almost any aspect or strength Franco could have played to, FAILS. Could it be because this was just ONE of SEVEN movies Franco directed that year. Being spread too thin is written all over this picture!

ABOUT THE TIM LUCAS COMMENTARY: I love Tim Lucas, and any commentary he makes is always packed with info. That said, it is plainly evident in this commentary that he is really shoehorning his love of film to justify many of the incompetent and arbitrary choices in this movie. I think he loves cinema and Franco so much, he is unwilling to say something is simply not working or is terrible at face value. In the case of this DVD he doesn't act like a critic outwardly judging the film or tackling the merits. He is more interested in the stories and process behind the film - but you start to ask yourself - why champion something which is so weak within the director's own body of work?",1476662400,4,2849,4.782520325203252
8715449,4,B00X99CBXI,"""The Erotic Rites of Frankenstein""(1972) is directed by Jess Franco. This was one of nine films Franco made in 1972. This prolific director created one of his most bizarre movies with this creation. The film might not be for everyone, but there isn't a boring moment as we get everything from a bird woman who has a thirst for blood, to a silvery Frankenstein, and an immortal wizard named Cagliostro. And even though Franco usually had small budgets for his movies he often managed to find some great locations, and this tended to add a marvellous ambiance to his films. This film was made in Portugal, close to Lisbon, in a castle on the coast.

This film hasn't been restored and has numerous instances of dust on the print. The film can be viewed in French with, or without subtitles, or dubbed in English. There is an interesting audio track that accompanies the film by Tim Lucas.",1457654400,5,886,4.643312101910828
8715450,5,B00X99CBXI,"I felt compelled to offer a different perspective on this wonderfully weird film as a counterpoint. Jess Franco's surreal touch goes a long way here, and your response to this film may depend on your mood. It creates an uncanny viewing experience, but it's also possible to enjoy it as a laugh-out-loud treat. The Bird-Woman amazes and, contrary to other comments here, her ultimate soliloquy is a fun jaw-dropper, ideal for audio samplers. There is something of the Bird Woman in Juliette Landau's character Drusilla in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Like Moctezuma's Mansion of Madness, this film gets a bad rap from people who are expecting straightforward horror rather than a trip through a bizarre wonderland. Redemption's transfer is clean and it's fun to watch the film with the English dub + subtitles, since they are often at odds in a rather funny way. All in all, this is a great gateway film to the crazy world of Director Jess Franco, a great movie to put on at the end of a party or to study on its own terms.",1446163200,5,1019,4.666666666666667
8715451,1,B00X99CBXI,"Ive attempted to watch several films by noted director Jess Franco over the past few years and I still don't get it. Fans in the horror community hail him as one of the seminal directors of the genre in Europe over the starting in the seventies when he truly began directing more and more films. Im sorry to say that the more of his movies I see the more he has in common with Ed Wood than directors of note.

Im sure much of his popularity stemmed from his use of naked or semi-clad women in his films but there has to be something more than that for him to achieve the status that he did. Perhaps it was his inclusion of what some considered taboo subjects at the time like S&M. Whatever it was I still have yet to become a member of the fan club. Perhaps someone can suggest one of his better films than the ones Ive witnessed to date.

Which brings us to this film. It begins with Dr. Frankenstein and his assistant Morpho finally creating a creature that comes to life. Unfortunately at the same time the assistants of Cagliostro are also nearby and steal the creature away. This involves the first hilarious moment in the film when the head of this group of henchmen is led by the character most call The Bird Lady. Bedecked in green feathers leaving exposed flesh she tends to caw like a bird rather than talk. Later on when she does talk youll miss the cawing as she tends to overdramatize any and everything happening.

The monster itself is a joke to witness. Given the square headed appearance weve known to love since the first Karloff film, this time around hes shirtless and painted silver for some reason. He can talk but still in monosyllabic sentences. Worst of all is when his silver skin rubs off on someone else in a scene.

During the capture of the monster Dr. Frankenstein was killed. Now his daughter appears and seeks not only revenge but the return of the monster as well. The police talk with her but are little use. To find out just who is responsible for the murder she asks the victim. Whats that you say, he is dead? Like that makes a difference. Hooked up in the lab she uses magnetic energy to bring her father back around and learn what she needs to know. Not one to let a good gag go to waste, Franco has the doctor regenerated several times before he finally kicks off.

Facing off against Cagliostro won't be easy. Hes survived for centuries changing bodies as each ends its time on Earth. His plans are to create a female creature to mate with the current one thus giving them the chance to bring forth a number of offspring who would live forever providing him with a more permanent place on the planet. Only Frankensteins daughter can stop this from happening and avenge her father.

If this movie weren't so badly produced it might have been a decent story to film. Instead it has all sorts of nonsensical moments and inclusions that might look cool but have little to do with what is going on. Cagliostro has a number of followers dressed in the appropriate monks garb, almost all with bland looks on their faces and several who are just skulls inside the robes. Every scene they are involved in is the same filmed sequence. If that weren't enough the bird lady becomes more laughable each time she speaks.

The acting in the film is so over the top as to make the actors in the afore mentioned Ed Wood movies seem like major thespians when compared. The lighting is often off, sometimes overly bright and others far too obviously day for night. Im still trying to figure out just what directing was done for this movie. Maybe if I go back and watch it one more time with the audio commentary track playing it will make more sense to me, but if thats the case then how good a movie can it be?

Look, I understand that movies like this need to be preserved for historical purposes. They also need to be made available for fans of the director and his work. But as for the casual viewer I would be hard pressed to find anything to recommend about this movie. It does offer people the chance to see one of the works of Jess Franco. But still, if someone can recommend something thats a better representation Im all ears.",1438300800,6,4159,4.413298565840939
8715452,3,B00X99CBXI,"The Erotic Rites of Frankenstein is director Jess Francos take on the Frankenstein story. Baron Frankenstein (Dennis Price) has electrically shocked his silver-skinned monstrous creation (Fernando Bilbao) into a being able to speak. The good doctor, of course, is convinced that his scientific experimentation is for the greater good of science, but clearly he isn't playing with a full deck. But soon after Caronte and Melissa, a blind, blood-thirsty, nearly naked bird woman, steal the monsters body with their own twisted intention. The creature itself is not portrayed as evil; it is those who control it who are evil. They bring the monster to Cagliostro, a crazed warlock with malicious plans of his own.

One of the lesser feature films based on Mary Shelleys novel, this 1972 French/Spanish co-production bears the Franco touch  lots of nudity, blood, and violence. Made on a small budget, the film stands out because of its sheer strangeness. Franco observes no parameters of good taste as he presents one over-the-top moment after another. Maybe this is necessary to spice up a tale thats nearly as old as movies themselves (the first filmed version of Frankenstein was made in 1910). Francos trademark in horror cinema is the visceral and perverse. Dismemberment after a sulfuric acid splashing and a graphic decapitation are only two of the grim treats awaiting viewers. The look of the film is partly inspired by grisly adult European comics of the early 1970s.

The widescreen Blu-ray edition contains a print mastered in HD from the original 35-mm negative. Bonus extras include audio commentary by Tim Lucas, editor of Video Watchdog magazine, and theatrical trailer. Two versions are included: French with optional English subtitles and alternate English dubbed.",1437955200,10,1779,5.257042253521127
