5957392,3,B00EYTDM6C,"EARLY PLOT SPOILER 20 minutes into film.

Cammie (Malin Akerman) is excited about going to the cottage by the lake with her workaholic boyfriend Todd (Tyler Labine). She has discovered the engagement ring he has hidden and knows what is coming. Alas, the family cottage is shared by his overly crude brother Sal (Dan Petronijevic) and foreign, off and on girlfriend Masha (Lucy Punch). Cammie wants them gone. Todd confronts Sal and drives an ax between their relationship leading to what could have been a fairly decent dark comedy.

While there were funny scenes, the humor quality was uneven. It couldn't maintain the level of interest. Sal, was not only unlikeable to his brother and GF, he was made unlikeable to the audience. Dov (Benjamin Ayres) should have added to the humor, instead added to the boredom. They needed a colorful character to replace him. Likewise all the support crowd was fairly lame.

Okay rental at best. I recommend the British dark horror comedy ""The Cottage"" instead.  Sorry Canada.

5957393,3,B00EYTDM6C,"This is not quite at the caliber of Hell Baby, which is riotously funny and outrageous.  This one tries and occasionally succeeds at portraying a would-be couple getting caught up in murder and lies while they vacation in a country cottage, with the tranquil setting at odds with the increasingly bloody behavior.",1389139200,,313,5.019230769230769

5957395,1,B00EYTDM6C,"A couple vacation at his parents' cabin.  It supposed to be the perfect romantic getaway where he plans to propose--but then his aggressively obnoxious brother and slutty Russian girlfriend turn up unexpectedly and tensions eventually erupt into violence.  Cottage Country manages exactly one laugh across it's seemingly interminable 92 minute length--a sight gag involving a not quite severed head.  Stars Tyler Labine, Malin Akerman and Lucy Punch have all been amusing elsewhere so the fault is obviously not with the cast but this movie is painfully unfunny and the characters rarely act in ways that are even remotely plausible--one murder leads to another and then another but it never feels like a natural escalation but rather stuff the actors are doing because it says so in the script.  For a much funnier body count comedy starring Tyler Labine check out Tucker and Dale Vs Evil instead.",1388361600,7,898,5.13013698630137
5957396,5,B00EYTDM6C,This is a sleeper movie Great cast and storyline karma eventually gets everyone Very funny and tragic at the same time,1386115200,4,118,4.666666666666667
5957397,4,B00EYTDM6C,"Just agreeing with most + reviews. Dark comedy from Tyler Labine. I also loved Tucker and Dale vs Evil, which is slightly darker, gorier and campier",1516233600,,148,4.730769230769231
5957398,4,B00EYTDM6C,"I saw this a few years ago and forgot about it and saw it again on Prime. Its not really funny but it is a dark comedy as someone attempts to cover up murdering their sibling.
I really like that we don't exactly love everyone, for Todd I get why he is mad at his sibling for showing up when he wanted the cabin to himself, but he should have known his brother wasn't going to listen and check a website, he should have at least told their mother who apparently Sal the brother checked with and mom said it was ok. However when Todd keeps trying to talk to Sal, it becomes evident that Sal cares for only one person himself. The actor portraying him isn't seen long but holy cow, props to that guy for being a class a-d bag lol. Really the death is self defense, sal kept physically attacking him (todd) for throwing the head phones into the lake.",1516147200,,846,4.196319018404908

5957400,1,B00EYTDM6C,"We bailed out after 25-minutes because it wasn't funny, it wasn't scary and it didn't have a likeable character. In fact, three of the four were downright annoying and hard to watch. Perhaps it got better but when you don't like what you're watching staying with it doesnt make much sense. The plot was tired and predictable and it certainly isn't a dark comedy if nothing is humorous.",1515283200,,385,4.676470588235294
5957401,5,B00EYTDM6C,Very hilarious movie. Love the main male actor. First seen him in Tucker and Dale VS. Evil. Another dark comedy thats insanely funny.,1514937600,2,133,4.826086956521739
5957402,4,B00EYTDM6C,Why hasn't this gotten more press? This is hilarious. Fans of Tucker and Dale will love this. Maybe even MORE than Tucker and Dale.,1514505600,,131,4.5

5957405,2,B00EYTDM6C,"I expected a dark comedy and I got, I don't know, a light hearted tale about brother murder?  Wasn't funny, somehow wasn't dark, just a sort of aimless and confused, like this review.  I guess at least I liked many of the actors in other films that they've been in.",1511827200,,265,4.28

5957407,4,B00EYTDM6C,"I liked it, very Tucker and Dale vibe to it with less humor, mixed with a dash of What about Bob, Folks!, and your average nice person snaps and kills someone plot. Better than 90% of the utter manure that is currently on amazon prime.",1507766400,2,235,4.2444444444444445
5957408,4,B00EYTDM6C,"This is definitely a dark comedy. Not bad i would give 3 1/2 stars. This is along the line of ""Very Bad Things"". If you like that movie you'll like this one.",1497052800,,157,3.9375
5957409,2,B00EYTDM6C,"A successful horror comedy, has a fine line to watch out for.
A little to the left and it's all jokes and over to the right and it's a serious horror movie.
The balance is hard to find.
There is very little comedy in this movie.
The horror aspects hardly exists either, almost more situational horror then anything else.
I like both main actors and Lucy Punch was hilarious but that's about it.

Warning not related to this review.
Amazon have shortened their return policy from 90 days to 30 days.
I lost 600.00$ on an HP Laptop because of this.
I guess you need to verify the return policy everytime you buy on this website from now on, because it used to be 90 days.
(Ebay has also done the same)",1491436800,,699,4.295454545454546

5957411,5,B00EYTDM6C,"I thought this movie was hilarious.  Malin Akerman was new to me, but she did a great job as the ""take charge to the point of murder"" fiance.  And I suppose I'm something of a Tyler Labine fanboy because I like pretty much everything he's in.  It's a very violent movie and will certainly not appeal to everyone, but my wife and I thought it was a great watch.",1449705600,,360,4.188405797101449

5957414,1,B00EYTDM6C,"It started off good but after the brother was killed the movie went straight downhill. It did pick up again at the very end with the shooting (I was NOT expecting that) but by then who cares? The movie was just about over so it really doesn't matter anymore. I don't know what I was expecting to watch but I'm glad I wasn't expecting anything good because if I was then I would've been REALLY disappointed. The only reason why I think I stuck around till the end was to see how everything ended & I can't believe I did. There were so many times I just wanted to turn it off. DON'T pay to watch Cottage Country. If you have to watch it, Watch it for free",1423785600,,653,4.109375
5957415,5,B00EYTDM6C,I love this movie. It was funny. Had already rented it before when I decided to buy it. It was just as seller described and is in great condition and shipped quickly! Highly recommended! Thanks! Would buy from this seller again.,1420416000,,228,4.585365853658536
5957416,5,B00EYTDM6C,"Loved it!  I wasn't sure what to expect, but had seen the trailer on another movie and wanted to see it.  For me this was definitely a good movie.  It has a lot of twists and turns.  I don't want this to be a spoiler alert so that is all I will say.

5957419,3,B00EYTDM6C,"Certainly not a comedy, I don't know how I'd characterize this film.  It's a sort of social commentary, though if you want me to save you the effort of watching it- all women are gold diggers, marriage is awful, and the best for which you can hope is a quick death, or relationships will make your life a living hell.  That is about the best summary of the film's message I could provide.",1398816000,,388,4.301369863013699
5957420,4,B00EYTDM6C,"I actually like this movie for what it is. This is an unusual film to say the least. It's funny in an extremely dark and twisted way. Not a shiny, happy movie in anyway. Malin Akerman is lovely and insane...",1398211200,,207,4.2
5957421,3,B00EYTDM6C,This dark comedy filmed in Canada has body count...gore and twisted humor to please any horror fan. Although the acting isn't great especially the accent I found irritating instead of funny. Netherless its worth the red box rental. The ending is a hoot! In a sick way.,1396742400,,268,4.723404255319149
5957422,5,B00EYTDM6C,maybe it was my mood but this was pretty darn good and funny too. worth a watch and has some good twists....I enjoyed it as much as any ''big budget'' movie ive seen !!! I'd watch it again!,1395619200,,189,4.0
5957423,3,B00EYTDM6C,"If you stuck Very Bad Things and the Great Outdoors into a blender, you'd end up with this Cottage country smoothie.  Todd brings his girlfriend, Cammie to his family cottage in the woods to propose, but is interrupted(during oral sex of course) by his obnoxious brother and his girlfriend.  Tensions rise, brother is killed, and in the comedy-of-errors tradition, Todd and Cammie's attempts to cover up the murder leads to more bodies piling up.
  As you might guess, the movie is played as black comedy.  And while it's certainly not bad by any means, I just couldn't help thinking the whole time how similar the movie is to Very Bad Things.  The whole premise and tone are similar, but there are a few things that seem to be lifted directly from that film.  The three biggest examples would be, A) a character stating and insisting that a Jew needs to be buried with all of their body parts.  B) Cammie is essentially the same as the Cameron Diaz character from VBT, as the nutzo bride to be that will stop and absolutely nothing(murder included) to make sure her perfect wedding isn't spoiled.  And C)  even the ending is very close to the VBT ending.
  I mean, I know lots of films bear similarities to each other, but this really has a deja vu vibe going on.  All in all it isn't so bad though, especially if you like your comedy dark, dark, dark.",1393718400,,1353,4.518518518518518
5957424,3,B00EYTDM6C,"""Just one more thing and it's all over and we can do whatever we want with our lives."" Todd (Labine) wants everything to be just perfect at the family cottage where he plans to propose to Cammie (Akerman). Things are going to plan until his brother and his girlfriend show up. After an attempt to get them to leave goes horribly wrong Todd's brother winds up dead. When Cammie finds out she has one solution, kill his girlfriend as well and no one will ever know. The plan is perfect until they return to the cabin and see a party happening...with guests invited by his brother. I was looking forward to this one mainly because the slasher- comedy movie Tucker and Dale vs Evil was so great I was hoping it would be like that. This did have funny parts in this but overall this wasn't nearly as funny as Tucker and Dale was. Much like that one though this is a very dark comedy and you laugh at things you shouldn't laugh at but the problem for me was that even though the actions were way over the top the actors seemed to play the movie straight. This little aspect made the movie lose some of the laughs that it could have gotten. Comparing this to Tucker and Dale isn't fair but that is the type of movie it is and is not as good as that one. Overall, disappointing but mainly because of my expectations. Not as funny as I was expecting. I give this a B-.",1393372800,,1359,4.250965250965251
5957425,5,B00EYTDM6C,One of the best DTV movies of the year! Its not cheao looking at all and very very original!  Anything tyler labine does seems to be great fun. I cant wait to buy this on dvd. I had to rent it at redbox. And boy was i surprised at how much fun it was. Dont know why its taking 4 months to comeout to buy. But o well. Im def buying this and YOU should too:),1392508800,2,356,3.6842105263157894
5957426,4,B00EYTDM6C,"First of all this is not dale and tucker vs. evil. It's not even kind of that movie or that type of movie. So if you're looking for another movie like that, this isn't it. What this is a dark comedy where two seemingly normally good people accidentally kill somebody and then things go from bad to worse to just plain terrible as they try to cover it up. You can almost hear the song ""I did a bad bad thing"" playing faintly in the background...Hope this helps. More dark than comedy but painfully ironic and just in the end.",1390694400,,524,4.25

The situation goes from bad to worse with everyone getting what they deserve in a sympathetically psychopathic kind of way. There were definitely uncomfortable scenes... But you quickly get over it and start laughing.  There is not a feel good ending to this movie, but Loved Malin, she is awesome.  Tyler's character...

8610453,4,B00EYTDM6C,This was a pretty decent flick. Not at all what I expected. I love Malin Ackerman so that helped. It was different than most stuff out there these days. Good plot twist at the end. I would watch again.,1519862400,,201,4.17948717948718

8610458,5,B00EYTDM6C,"The cast makes this movie.  The storyline is decent, and a new, darker twist on a concept introduced in Tucker and Dale.  Malin Ackerman really shines here, and you can almost feel layer by layer her inner true character being peeled back.  The actor playing Todd is pitch perfect as a mildly neurotic yuppie, and Salinger is the second coming of Pauly Shore.....his ghost scenes are ridiculously funny, and I would love more of them.  If I could take off half a star for anything it is that the body count is much lower than expected based on a) the possibilities and b)the film's description.  Watched this and Crush the Skull back to back for some great new entrants into the horror comedy genre.  Don't miss this one.",1516838400,,721,4.59375
8610459,5,B00EYTDM6C,I love gritty films and this was a nail biter. Kind of a movie about an accidental homicide and how people go about getting away with it. White people that is. How white people go about getting away with it.,1516492800,2,207,4.2
