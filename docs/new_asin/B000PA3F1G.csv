8190025,5,B000PA3F1G,"In the background, we see a picture of the Metropolis in 2026 that is watched over by Johhan 'Joh' Fredersen (Alfred Abel). He stole the heart of Hel from C.A. Rotwang, der Erfinder ""The Inventor"" (Rudolf Klien-Rogge) and married her. It was speculated that Hel fell for Joh's position of power more than love. Hel dies in childbirth.

Rotwang being lonely invents a robot replacement for Hel. Rotwang loses a hand in the process. We see the machine person Hel on the poster the same way Joh saw it when he learned of its existence.

Meantime it looks like Jon's son Freder Frederson (Gustov Frhlich) has been smitten by a kindly girl Maria (Brigitte Helm) with a mission. This mission is stated in the beginning credits as the ""Head"" and the ""Hands"" will be brought together by the ""Heart.""

Joh must squelch the son's infatuation with Maria and put the workers in their place.

Looking at the sight of Rotwang's machine person, an evil plan forms in Joh's mind. Little does he know what plan is in Rotwang's mind.

However, we do.

Hel is the name of the queen of Helheim, the Norse underworld.

8190026,5,B000PA3F1G,"In 1927 my mother was 17 years old. Like most of the country at that time she would have been living a largely agrarian lifestyle, a countrified life, filled with cornpone and over-cooked green beans. Her simple cotton clothes would have smelled of some borax-like detergent and her nails would have been short and split from hard work around the farm. Had she made it to town to see this picture show on some muggy Saturday night in 1927 with my father, she would have stared agog at the screen as the phantasmagoric images swam past in futuristic splendor. For a brief hour and a half or so it would have lifted her away from the washboards and wringers and pump handles and udders and brooms and clotheslines. When she came out she would have shaken her head in disbelief and laughed with wonder that such a world could have been created. Imagine yourself in 1927 when you see this film and share the wonder of this, one of the very first films in (and the likely fertile progenitor of) the cinematic genre called science fiction. Its cost, they say, was over $200 millions in adjusted dollars - quite an extravagance for the time, two-thirds the cost of Titanic.",1176854400,4,1166,4.583732057416268
