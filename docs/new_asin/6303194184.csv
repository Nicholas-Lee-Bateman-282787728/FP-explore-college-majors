590829,3,6303194184,I really liked James and Natalie's blending together. That is what good acting is all about. However the story line was just okay.,1306972800,,130,4.695652173913044
590830,4,6303194184,"I have read and enjoyed every novel by Anne Tyler. Breathing Lessons is one of my favorites. I was a little hesitant to purchase the Hallmark Hall of Fame video of the novel since, in my opinion, movie renditions either don't follow the story line or the actors are not the best choices for the role. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the movie adaptation, the actors, and the rigorous adherence to the plot. The quality of the tape was good, the price was exceptional, and the shipment superb.",1302134400,,499,4.617977528089888
590831,4,6303194184,"I got this movie, first because it was a Hallmark Hall of Fame movie & second, because I like both the leading actors/actresses - James Garner & Joanne Woodward.  I don't know who James Garner is married to; but, I do know Joanne Woodward is Paul Newman's wife.  Actually, Paul & James have similar demeanors.  Perhaps, that's why this couple seems to have so much ""chemistry"".  The whole stoy of this movie happens one Saturday, starting with the couple getting ready to take a couple hour road-trip for a funeral of Maggie's best friend's husband.  From start to finish, the day is filled with comedy & friendly bickering of an ""old-married-couple"".  The viewer is introduced to three incidental family members: a college-bound daughter, older son - a ""biker-dude"" with torn-out knees in jeans & long-hair.  The first incident in their day happens when the wife walks to the auto-body shop to pick up their car, which had been repaired following an accident. Ira's father lives upstairs from his frame shop & the viewer is briefly introduced to him as well.  As Maggie is pulling out of the body shop, onto the street, she will declare her ex-daughter-in-law's voice is heard on the car radio. ""Bang"", the car is struck in the front passenger-side quarter-panel by a large utility truck.  The day goes on from that incident, visiting a cafe for coffee & a map so that Ira can determine his driving route.  Lots of personal information is exchanged by Maggie & the waitress.  I think of one of my home-care clients, when there were several women out in the dinette chatting, he would say ""la cockarone, la cockarone"", rough Italian equivalent of ""the chickens (clucking)"".  Ira & Maggie arrive at the church with no body else in sight.  As they are waiting, Ira pulls out a deck of playing cards & starts a game of Solitare.  Soon, however the widow, played by Joyce Van Patten, arrives at the church & hands Ira a large floral arrangement & takes Maggie outside for a little friendly chat.  The rest of the congregation arrive soon afterwards & it is the strangest memomorial service this viewer has ever seen!  Various congregants are asked to sing some love song or another.  Maggie begins to sing ""Love is a Many Spleandored Thing"", soon accompanied by the man sitting on her left - some other friend of Maggie's.  Soon, the funeral is over & the congregation appears at the home of the recently departed & his widow.  Ira is found in the bedroom, setting up another game of Solitare.  Maggie finds him & accidentally falls backward onto the water-bed!  They are laughing & having fun & the widow finds them & ""throws them out"".  Maggie suggests to Ira that they stop & visit thier ex-daughter-in-law & granddaughter Leroy.  On the way, Paul Winfield is driving erratically & Maggie lies to him that his wheel is in danger of falling off the car, and they end-up taking him to a garage where a family member of his runs the tow-truck.  They arrive at Fiona & Leroy's home & Fiona's mother returns shortly from grocery shopping.  Ira & Leroy play a game of catch with the baseball.  Maggie has talked Fiona & Leroy into coming back to Baltimore with them.  Their son Jesse comes to the house, knowing his ex is going to be there (Maggie calls him from the bedroom phone at Fiona's place).  The reunion lasts all of about five minutes & Jesse ""hits-the-road"", followed shortly after by Fiona & Leroy.  Following supper, the college-bound daughter is still packing & Mom has brought a cup of frozen yoguart for each her & the daughter.  ""no Thanks"", says daughter & Maggie goes to bedroom.  Yet again, Ira has a Solitare game going.  She ""butts-in"" on his game & he eats some of the dessert & comments ""hey, this is actually pretty good"".  Screen fades to black & end credits roll.  In about an hour & a half, the viewer is shown one waking-day in the life of Ira & Maggie.

i like movies like this, once in awhile - a ""day in the life of - somebody"".  It makes me realize I'm not so much different from the rest of humanity, at least in middle-class America!

Hallmark consistently sets the standard for what ""movies ought to be like"" - a good story, very little swearing, very little overt violence, very little overt sexuality.  If some of those are needed a swear word or two is sufficient.  If sex is part of the story, it's either referred to in dialog or just a quick scene.  Violence is handles the same way.  And the story is told in about 100 minutes, give or take.",1286323200,2,4477,4.58816120906801
590832,5,6303194184,"My wife and I really related to this movie when it came out. I gave it to her on her 24th anniversary so we could view it again.  We were looking for the movie in the conventional areas, netflix, blockbusters with no success.  I was so glad to find it on Amazon.  The DVD was in great shape and had special features included which was nice.  Hallmark really puts out good stories.  I also would like to acknowledge Amandasgiftshop for sending the product in a timely fashion.

Thanks,

Satisfied Customer, Phil",1274745600,,510,4.538461538461538

590837,4,6303194184,"This Hallmark Hall of Fame TVM is an adaptation of the Pulitzer prize-winning novel by AnneTyler about a Baltimore married couple who travel to a friend's funeral. We're in road movie territory with James Garner and Joanne Woodward bickering along the way. The bickering is of the amusing variety because of the skill of both actors, the tone set by director John Erman and music by Broadway composer John Kander. Although Garner has a non-threatening manner, it's funny to see how Woodward as a dithery eccentric infuriates him. Woodward reminded me a little of Shirley Booth in Come Back Little Sheba, but without the dog. Garner says she ""believes the people she loves are better than they are"" which explains her romantic quest to rejoin her divorced son with his ditzy ex-wife, Kathyrn Erbe, in a performance as strong as Garner and Woodward. Woodward has an hysterical turn when she is called upon to sing Love is a Many Splendid Thing at the funeral, and gets a good line at Garner with ""You and reality oughta go steady"", which is also a little Blanche DeBois ""I don't want realism. I want magic"". In smaller roles are Joyce Van Patten as the funeral's widow, and Eileen Heckart who comes off a little better as a diner waitress (though Garner upstages her with his looks of disdain at Woodward's openness with her). Paul Winfield is also in a few scenes where he is the victim of Woodward's road rage.",984528000,31,1410,4.712550607287449

590878,4,6303194184,James is a great actor but this wasn't in character. Hallmark is known for their movies-just not my kind of movie,1396137600,,113,4.428571428571429
590879,3,6303194184,"I saw this movie on the Hallmark Movie Channel this morning and I didn't really care much for this movie at all. I like James Garner & Joanne Woodward but not in this movie..  It was hokey ...Too much running around all threw the movie.. Said it was a romance movie ...It was suppose to be about: An eventful Saturday drive gives a longtime married couple(James Garner, Joanne Woodward) time to renew their love..Didn't see much of that... Going to a funeral and visiting a friends daughter and her little..The little girl turned out to be their grandchild and eventually comes to live with them...I thought it was going to be about rekindling their romance...I didn't see any of that.. Didn't like it and wouldn't watch a second time. Once was enough!",1393804800,3,752,4.696969696969697

590883,5,6303194184,"Breathing Lessons was a cute, funny movie, just a joy to watch.  I love all of the Hallmark Hall of Fame movies.

590884,5,6303194184,How do some marriages survive? This movie looks at one that has endured thanks to the spouses' willingness to bend at all costs. Garner and Woodward make for an enviable couple.,1360540800,,177,4.741935483870968
590885,4,6303194184,"I call this type of movie a 'slice of life' film. (it's not some sort of pregnancy preparation film like the title might suggest)

I quite enjoyed this film. (1994/boxed 1998)When you have people go on and on about something personal in their life to a complete stranger,and it's your friend, you might get a bit antsy, but watching it happen to Garner here is actualy fun. Now though ostensibly the star is Garner, I have to compliment Joanne Woodwards ability to pull off and her role so perfectly and her story telling bits are just so natural as to make you see she was her role and just knew the content of her bits so well she could just make it seem perfectly natural to go on like she did. Her acting made the film.

Normally slice of life films to me are often pointless, or too gloomy and never seem to have definable end or beggining for that matter. This one made more sence in that regaurd, and I even wanted it to go on.  Normaly with ""slice of life"" films...once was enough, but this one was fun, funny, yet deeper than one might readily see, even poigneint, and I'll be glad to watch it again.

The acting and dialogue by virtualy all actors was exceptional.",1357516800,,1174,4.371559633027523
590886,4,6303194184,"This is a really odd movie! Joanne Woodward plays a simple idealist, and James Garner plays a serious realist. Together they form a bickering (but loving) couple on a weird road trip movie.

It's hard to give a basic premise/plot, because it's really all over the place. But this is a movie that's quite enjoyable if you like the Hallmark brand of sentiment/humor. James Garner is in many of these Hallmark movies, and he's more than up to the task in Breathing Lessons. While this certainly doesn't have a ""picture perfect"" ending, it is pretty realistic and gives a good ride.

This is a very imperfect (yet perfect) couple, who are imperfect (yet perfect) parents and grandparents. Watch it and I think you'll see what I mean!",1342569600,,729,4.732283464566929

7840420,3,6303194184,"I'm sorry to point out that Maggie Moran mars this movie through being overplayed. She comes across not as superficially-flighty-but-wise but just plain silly, 65 going on 12. As a great admirer of Anne Tyler's subtlety, humor and humanity, I'm thrilled when any of her work is dramatized, thus all the more disappointed that the movie failed to do the story justice. This despite good acting otherwise as well as good script, pacing and production values.

Because James Garner and just about everyone else played it just right, it's worthwhile seeing to the end... once. Second time around I just couldn't do it.",1471824000,,614,4.961165048543689
