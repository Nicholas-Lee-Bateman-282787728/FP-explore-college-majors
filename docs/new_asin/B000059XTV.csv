8097649,1,B000059XTV,"I teach freshmen English at a large public high school, and I use this filmed stage version of ""Romeo and Juliet"" so my students can appreciate the far better, though older filmed version I show from start to finish. It is from the ""Thames Shakespeare Collection from A&E and starring Ann Hasson and Christopher Neame.
This version with Blanche Baker, probably best known for playing the older sister in the movie ""Sixteen Candles,"" is truly awful, and I can only show a few minutes at a time before we all want to shoot ourselves, as one student said.
Some of the acting is alright, but Baker as Juliet is so bad, it's painful. I am so sorry if she ever reads this, which seems quite unlikely, but nevertheless possible. I loved her in ""Sixteen Candles,"" and I would hate for her feelings to be hurt, but I feel compelled to write this review.
As the actors around her struggle to interact with her in some meaningful way, Baker is like, as one of my students observed, a robot.
She has learned the lines, which is in itself a formidable task, but she never seems to feel any of them. All budding actors should watch this production so they understand the importance of internalizing a character.
Her delivery is wooden, her movements artificial, her expression, inflection and intonation, nonexistant.

8097650,1,B000059XTV,"This has got to be THE worst R&J ever produced anywhere.  The staging is clumsy, the costumes embarrassing, the acting turgid.  The voices are a cacophony of mixed bad British, grating American, and others never actually used anywhere.  Although if you like cod-pieces, this is the production for you.
  The formidable Esther Rolle's subtext seems to be that she can't wait to go home and take a shower.  The director has relegated her to the demanding task of standing there looking African, presumably in a desperate bid to add visual interest to the crowd scenes.
  The producers used the phrase ""staged as seen in the 16th century;"" in my opinion only the first five minutes would have been seen, after which the actors would have been pelted with rotting vegetables by a disgusted audience uttering earnest calls for getting their money back and/or burning down the theatre.
  This DVD could, however, be useful for encouraging folks to try their hand at acting.  Once they see this they should be thinking ""Hey, I could do better than that!""  A splendid bad example-- acting teachers can say ""See? This is what I want you to avoid.""  This R&J is a fine collection of the very worst acting habits and traits.
  The only high points:  there is one good actor in the cast, in a minor role (Try and find him, like 'Where's Waldo!') and the sword fights, which do show some of the modern improvements in fight choreography.  Perhaps they only seem so good because they prevent the actors from speaking while they fight.
  Personally, I'd rather watch dogs play poker.",1063238400,21,1568,4.762081784386617
