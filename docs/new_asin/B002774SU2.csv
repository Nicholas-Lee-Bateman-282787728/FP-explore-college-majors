8354241,3,B002774SU2,"Fortunately, I never have the highest hopes for stuff like this. Not that it was total waste of my time, and I did enjoy it, but it is not going to make me jump up and down with absolute joy. To be honest, it was not a total time waster, but it is something that I won't be saying is the greatest either. I liked it, the animation for what it was decent and I don't regret spending the money.",1400889600,,392,3.9125
8354242,5,B002774SU2,"Me and my boyfriend watched this as soon as it arrived, and him being into anime, I thought he was having a heart attack in some of the scenes, lol. He really enjoyed it, and it made me happy that he enjoyed it. The graphics are off a bit, and the orgasm sounds are hilarious..... so, if you think your gonna get your rocks off watching this, think agian. Bu, if you watch porn for the humor behind it, then this is a must have. :)",1377129600,,431,4.023255813953488
8354243,3,B002774SU2,"I'm usually a big fan of the adult studio, Adult Source Media and gotten a lot of movies from them, but this movie is 3DCGI and gay, but I guess it's okay.  ASM only had 5 3DCGI movies in the past 5 years already and they don't have too many gay films.",1373068800,,252,3.8461538461538463

8354245,1,B002774SU2,"What can I say, I laughed so much I got a stomach ache.  The technique they used was not like the new style of animation that is out, sort of like watching Final Fantasy VII Advent Children, more like a computer animation.  It was very explicit, but basically computer animated.  It felt like someone used their computer to animate figures.  The story line or should I say lack of was cheap to say the least.  The sound was like some cheap dubb, the music was too much.  In one sense it was too cheap.  If you are a true yaoist you could get it, but I would not waste money on this item.  It lacked too many things and it would take too long to list them.  Do yourself a favor and just go for better anime like Winter Cicada, trust me, the plot line is there and is much better.",1252800000,8,778,4.099337748344371
