5058685,2,B0076YFJHM,"I receive my package and when i opened it up i hear the disks moving around. So i open the case and find most of the place holders broken. Not only that, the disks are so scratched they won't play. I am really disappointed in this product. Anime Works needs to be held accountable for this. This is horrible and unacceptable. I suggest to everyone looking to buy Fushigi Yuugi is to wait for it to get rescued by another anime company. Sadly this great show is ruined by the packaging.",1374969600,4,485,4.34065934065934
5058686,1,B0076YFJHM,"Anime aside, the packaging for this show is TERRIBLE. It comes in this flimsy little 4-disc plastic case that can be broken with two fingers. I ordered this item from Amazon, and it came so badly broken that all of the discs were scratched. I returned it for a second copy, which was also broken.",1373673600,4,296,4.4
5058687,3,B0076YFJHM,"the packaging was terrible for this product. The case for the DVDs was obviously extremely cheaply made. One of the things that holds the dvds into place broke when it was shipped. So far I haven't noticed any DVD's scratched but I intend on watching all of them soon. If any are scratched I will return it. As it is I'm mad that the case broke. (also if you do buy this invest in sleeves, or some other way to store the dvds. I'm afraid that leaving them in the case will scratch them if they aren't already. Great anime series though, just poor case and packaging. The shipping arrived quickly.",1371945600,2,596,4.378378378378378
5058688,4,B0076YFJHM,"Fushigi Yugi: Season One was a great story, though it had some weak english voice acting. and that to me was strang considering who the voice actors were. Maybe they were rushed or something it was a lot of episodes. It had that early anime feel going on, but i kind of like that. Icant really tell if I am reviewing the show or the shipper, so I'll touch on both. The ending left something to be desired, but that is typical with Japanese tradjedy. The overall story was great, amd the characters were very strong. As for 40k the provider. They gid a great job in packcking the discs. Somewhere in transit the box was totaly smashed and the discs were still ok. They all played fine, even though the season one box was broken. Good job!!",1366675200,,738,4.355072463768116
5058689,5,B0076YFJHM,This was the second Manga series i started reading and the anime is great only problem when you first meet Hotohori how can you not tell it's a guy he's not disquiseing his voice or anything.,1366243200,,191,4.333333333333333
5058690,3,B0076YFJHM,"Well I've been a fan of Fushigi Yuugi for years.  A friend of mine has it on DVD, the original release including the OVA and Eikoden.  So when I saw it was rereleased, I was thrilled because the other DVDs are expensive.  And the show still is enjoyable.

But the thing is...the packaging.  I bought mine from Best Buy but looking at the reviews here make me realize it doesn't matter whether you bought it at Amazon, Best Buy, or wherever.  The first version the packaging worked fine, didn't actually have any issues.  But the second disc didn't play right.  One episode it wouldn't play fully and a second episode it skipped during the recap at the beginning.  So thankfully it was only a couple days before the 30 day mark so I brought it back to Best Buy and exchanged it.  Got home to find out the third disc wouldn't stay in the case and when I was poking around it cracked and the inner portion popped out.  Shortly after the same thing happened to the second disc spot.  Thought I got them relatively fixed even though the third disc still wouldn't stay in.  Watched the two episodes of Disc 2 that had issues on my first version, they worked fine and watched disc 3 without trouble.  Just watched disc 4 today a couple weeks later...and had issues with I think episode three where it hitches and won't play when you get about half way through the episode and then skips to the end credits.

It's annoying because I'm not sure I'll be able to take it back and exchange it.  But it really makes me wonder, because I've never had such of a hard time with a dvd or anime dvd release as I've had with this.  Makes me wonder if the reason why season 2 was pushed back was because they wanted to make sure they made the casing and discs actually work right.  I'm not saying don't buy this, especially if you've already seen the show and have been waiting like me for a more affordable release.  But be cautious and make sure you watch it all as soon as possible so you can see whether there are any playing issues.",1352851200,,2017,4.330666666666667
5058691,5,B0076YFJHM,"This is a great show that will bring back fond memories of the 90's for kids and teens who got a chance to watch it during its original release. It'll also be great for new fans to explore anime that they didn't get to watch the first time around, or if one if just a fan of collecting anime. This show will not disappoint. The dubbed version is fine, even though i find the main voice actor that dubbs Miaka's voice a bit annoying and wished someone else was cast. Anyways, check this series out. This box sets contains the first half of the first and only season.

However, like many reviews have stated, the box set is poorly conceived. It contains 4 DVDs in one DVD case separated by a piece of foam. Chances are, finding it'll be damaged by the time someone opens it. I got two at Best Buy and had to return both.",1346457600,,818,4.210191082802548
5058692,3,B0076YFJHM,"Due to the low star reviews here on amazon I decided to be cautious & purchase this set off of buy.com & also sent them an email asking if they insert any protectants inside the set to prevent the discs from falling out. Overall when I received my copy of the set earlier today the discs still ended up floating inside the case.

But this isn't amazon or buy's fault, this is Media Blasters/Anime Works' fault for having made the nubs that are supposed to hold the discs in place too small & no matter how many times I attempted to press/force them down the discs would always come out of place, so I am going to have to purchase an individual 7mm dvd case that can house 4 discs

My discs also arrived scratched but fortunately still worked & none of the packaging was damaged either. Unfortunately I dunno if this first season will sell all that well & we may never see the second season receive a release.

Anyways regarding the content itself, this contains the first 26 episodes of Fushigi Yugi about 6 per disc, nice covertart & disc art I have to admit, it's anamorphic widescreen (although the visuals aren't necessarily all that improved having been upscaled) & this is a barebones release as well: recycled menu's (that at the very least have music unlike Geneon/Pioneers sets), english subtitles & the original english+japanese dub.

And don't let ""boxset"" deceive you because this is a regular 7mm sized dvd case.

Though one thing I did notice not initially in Geneon/Pioneer's releases of Fushigi Yugi is that Media Blasters/Anime Works kept in some scenes that initially contained japanese text, so I suppose that's a plus.

Overall i'd recommend the Pioneer boxsets or the individual Geneon volumes, but if you are interested in purchasing this convenient set then make certain you email the seller to include some sort of protectant inside the case so the discs don't end up flying around or scratched as much.",1341878400,7,1927,4.720238095238095
5058693,2,B0076YFJHM,"From what I've read I am not the only one that has had this problem. The problem being that the DVD case that these come in is not very sturdy, it's borderline just unacceptable. I waited so long for this box set to come out. As many know the date kept getting pushed back. When I finally did get the dvds they were poorly packaged. Upon opening the case Two out of Four of the place holders were broken, all for discs were sliding around and so they were horribly scratched. The place holders are very thin, so they don't hold the discs very well. Even the unbroken ones aren't very good, they are just too thin. I am afraid to break them myself just pushing on them a little.

So I returned my DVDs for another set (willing to give them a 2nd try). I got my replacements in quickly and they were better packaged this time. Still though, one of the place holders was broken, but it was one in back, so all the discs were still secure. Also, one of the clips was broken, so the case doesn't shut all the way. I recommend waiting to buy this set in stores. Thecompany really needs to reconsider making the cases stronger and not so cheaply. I really felt like it was a waste of my money.

Other than the case problems the disc quality is good, no special features or anything like that, just the show.",1341187200,6,1300,4.237903225806452
5058694,3,B0076YFJHM,"I looked forward to this product for a long time. The release date kept getting pushed back and I almost canceled my order. When I finally received the product, the inside of the case was broken so that none of the discs are held in place and just float around inside the case. Due to this, all of the discs are scratched by the broken parts of the case and skip in places.
That said, it's still the same show I remember watching in junior high and it brings back a lot of good memories for me.
I wouldn't count on the second season ever being re-released any time soon, especially not by this company, which is a shame.",1340841600,4,620,4.218487394957983

5058704,4,B0076YFJHM,"This anime is fantastic! I absolutely love this anime, but the product itself is poorly made.

8511278,4,B0076YFJHM,"If you like anime in which the protagonist goes back in time, this is a good show to watch. I was just annoyed by how easily the protagonist was manipulated. I was also annoyed by how the friend was a jerk and was not held accountable for her actions. She changed her personality so many times she acted schizophrenic. It was annoying. The overall show was good.",1521244800,,362,4.417910447761194

8511283,3,B0076YFJHM,"This is a fantastically cheesy older fantasy anime filled with friendship, betrayal, love quadrangles and a heroine that you just can't take seriously. I absolutely LOVE it, but I'm not going to lie - I love it mostly because it's nostalgic and silly. It's all of the reasons I fell in love with anime in the first place, but it's definitely a guilty pleasure.",1495843200,,360,4.640625
8511284,4,B0076YFJHM,"Same as my review for Season 2: Great show, sub-par packaging and video quality.  The characters are so lovable and the story is engrossing, but it's difficult to overlook the production value of this DVD edition.  I honestly feel Anime Works did a disservice to the original creator and crew who put their all into making this show.  That being said, I'm grateful to them for taking the trouble to do a US release of  Fushigi Yugi in the first place.  If you don't mind near-VHS quality video and are willing to risk receiving potentially scratched disks, then I say give it a try (because it probably won't be re-released anytime soon).",1487635200,,638,4.660714285714286
