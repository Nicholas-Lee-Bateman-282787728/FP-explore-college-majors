8647926,5,B00J49LXPE,"Except for listening to original recordings, I know of no other source for music of this era that is performed in it's original orchestrations with such professionalism.  Max Rabbe has a band that is tight and professional with a good understanding of what the music was suppose to sound like when it was written.  Listening and watching this disc is infecting and after a few minutes I could close my eyes and I felt transported back to a European nightclub in the early 30's.",1403481600,,477,4.666666666666667
8647927,5,B00J49LXPE,"This disc was recorded at the Waldbuhne in 2006 and has been available on DVD for some years. This blu-ray version is to be warmly welcomed and has all the usual virtues of crystal clear imaging coupled with precise accuracy of sound. Although this is an outdoor event neither the imaging nor the sound (DTS 5.1 and stereo) suffers in any technical way and it can therefore be described as an outstanding technical success.

The program runs for 115 minutes with a clear focus on the hits of the late Weimar period of German light music which centres on the 1920's and 1930's. This is supported by a handful of American hits using the same instrumentation. There are 32 pieces performed in total, each one introduced briefly and sung by Max Raabe with substantial input by the various members of the orchestra who all get their opportunities to shine as featured musicians.

The Palast orchestra was formed in 1986 when Max Raabe was a student and many of the 12 band members have been with him since its inception. The style is of simple precision delivered with a sharply dry sense of humour. This applies to all the participants. The main prop used by Max Raabe in his brief but succinct introductions is a raised eyebrow which makes it clear that there is often a sub-plot to all that may be spoken.

The combination of dryly witty introductions and songs which frequently share the same sense of humour make the addition of subtitles an essential aid to following everything that is said and sung for all non-German speaking viewers. The translations may not be identical to the original German but they certainly capture the meaning and the mood very well. In this respect this disc is a great advance on other similar discs without sub titles.

There is a 20 minute bonus film which follows Max Raabe on his concert tours of New York, Japan and Rome. This is light-weight entertainment but enjoyable as an introduction to Max Raabe and his whole approach to making music.

This is a superb disc and has produced a response of astonished delight when shared with friends. It should inspire many newcomers to become avid followers of Max Raabe and his marvellous orchestra. It would be hard to imagine this disc being improved upon in any way whatsoever.",1399939200,2,2259,4.723350253807107
