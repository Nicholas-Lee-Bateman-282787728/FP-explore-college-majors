574686,4,6303106862,"I am a big fan of Karen Voight's.  However, on this video, I found her demonstrations of how to do it the WRONG way very annoying.  When working out to this video I have to look at the guys standing behind her so my routine doesn't get interrupted by following something wrong.  Since I use the video 3-4 times a week, I also turn off the sound and play my own music.
I have other Karen Voight videos and this is the only complaint I have ever had.  She is the fitness queen!",971308800,4,475,4.075268817204301

I am a huge fan of Julian Michaels -( love her no bs attitude!) but if your looking for a longer solid  full body workout nothing beats this one! The option of just doing upper or lower is awesome. Also once 3lbs feel light you can make it challenging by using a heavier handheld weight.  Yes, the music and visual aspect is dated but who cares? It's about getting results! She teaches easy to follow form and the upper body segment gives the body serious results I haven't found in any other workout. Definitely works all the muscles.",1415577600,10,682,4.404761904761905

574858,5,6303106862,"I am a high intermediate-advanced exerciser. This workout kicks my butt every time! If you want a really good toning workout then this is the workout for you!

This workout is a bit ""dated"" since it was made in the early 90's (I think). However, this workout stands still on its own and surpasses many newer workouts. It is all weights, but your heart rate will stay up there during the standing ""4-limb-type"" upper body part. I wouldn't call this a ""body building"" type workout since you do use light weights so for heavy dumbells you would probably want to use a different video..BUT this will give you a great shape and tone your body like never before!!

The workout:
6 1/2 min of warm up
Lower Body (standing) Toning 6 1/2 min
Standing Upper Body Tonight (you do light 4-limb since you are moving your legs but there is NO jumping or aerobics) 20 min
Lower Body (Floor Toning)- 30 min (ankle weights and a small medicine ball used but I didn't use my medicine ball and even if you do not use ankle weights it is still a killer lower body floor workout).
Abs- 15 min (get ready to do ALOT of floor ab work)! The abs are easy to do, but you will feel them!!

I did the full workout (it has different chapters where you can choose to mix and match your own segments but I did the whole entire thing).

All the moves are basic but VERY effective (and you will feel the burn the next day-especially your arms and quads!!).

The Upper Body part is KILLER-I use 3lbs with this and oh boy you don't think 3lbs is anything, but just you wait! LOL The upper body moves are constant and even someone using 2lbs will probably still feel challenged. For very advanced exercisers, you can use heavier weights to make it more challenging although I do not advise to use anything heavier than 8lbs for the Upper Body since she does move a little fast in one part with them (just in one part where she does this bicep tricep back and forth move torwards the end of the upper body toning part). But most of them are slow and controlled and very fun to do.

Think ""Classic FIRM Vol 2 'Low Impact Aerobics'"" when it comes to a similar video workout (with Janet Jones)-although THIS workout was more challenging for the upper body since I can easily use 5lb for the entire upper body segment from FIRM vol 2. (Anyone who has done the FIRM Classic Vol 2 will know what I am talking about). But these two workouts will surely get your arms into tip top shape!!

The Floor toning is very nice and time goes by pretty fast as there is no dread factor to me with this workout. The music is dated but you get so into the workout that you may not even notice it. ;)

The Abs are easy basic moves but nicely slow and controlled you WILL feel the burn!!

As always Karen gives excellent form pointers and her cuing is wonderful in this one!! A classic you never want to be without!! Grade A+!!",1391731200,11,2868,4.3061224489795915

574980,4,6303106862,"This is the 2nd Karen Voight workout video I have and like the first one, I love this workout.  Although I can't do it all at one time, I like the long segments on using weights, working the legs and lastly a short abs workout.  I think the video is a great overall workout.

The workout is probably beginner to intermediate and using heavier weights would increase the intensity.  My only complaint is that I wish Karen would have used the legs more while using hand weights.",1295827200,,476,4.436781609195402

Anyone who's a fan of Karen can tell she's quite young as are the two guys working out in this one that are much older in the newer stuff. That aside, the workout is killer! Karen it is a tough cookie! I used 5lb weights and nearly blasted my shoulders and arms off!!! It looks like they're only using like 3lb weights, which is what I suggest. At 5lbs I couldn't do all the reps and I'm an advanced exerciser. There's sections for upper and lower body that can be split on separate days.",1262736000,6,532,4.174757281553398
574984,4,6303106862,"This dvd is a little dated, but will still give you a good workout.  I ignore all the cutesy dance moves and just stick to the basics. It's very fast paced and you will sweat!!",1238976000,,176,4.0285714285714285
574985,4,6303106862,This is a pretty demanding (but excellent) workout. It is structured well with different sections so you can mix and match whichever body parts you want to exercise. I found the lower body routine (squats and lunges) fairly straightforward to follow but agree with some other reviewers on the upper body segments where I found it fairly hard to coordinate upper with lower body moves. I'm unable to do the whole tape in one sitting but can usually work my way through two segments which makes for a good half hour workout.,1205625600,4,522,4.684782608695652
574986,3,6303106862,"First of all, if you have neck and shoulder problems stear away from this DVD.  After doing the ""Great Weighted Workout"" two times, I found that afterwards I would be in a lot of pain. I think it is because of the swinging movements you do throughout the upper body segments using weights. The third time I tried the workout, I used weights only part of the time, and I didn't experience the same problems.

I would not recommend this DVD for beginners. I have been an avid exerciser, so I knew when to not overextend my knees, arms etc.. Karen, however, does not give that clear of instructions on how not to do that. Unfortunately, I believe  it would be easy for a beginner to get hurt. As far as recommending it to those who are on an intermediate or advanced level, you will feel some burn. I would say, though, save your money there are such better DVD's out there like Jari Love ""Get Ripped"".",1200268800,8,899,4.37125748502994
574987,2,6303106862,"I loved this DVD...before I learned about proper weight training methods. Karen instructs viewers to do so many consecutive repetitions of exercises that muscles will fatigue, but they won't be properly stimulated to grow or to truly attain that nice tone we all want. Calories will be burned because you're moving around a weight for a long time, but if you really want a workout that will improve your physique, just start learning the basics of good old standard weight training routines--squats, lunges, presses, etc.",1194825600,8,521,5.141176470588236
574988,4,6303106862,This is a very good DVD. Karen makes you work hard. I also like the fact that she is so fit and sculpted. I would highly recommend this video if you are looking for an exceptional workout.,1194393600,,188,4.108108108108108
575076,5,6303106862,"As with Energy Sprint, I had these when they first came out and now had to reorder them since I was getting bored with spinning, yoga and running. I needed weights and remembered her videos. She gets so much in  and the time goes by so fast.",1194307200,2,241,4.127659574468085
575077,3,6303106862,"This DVD was my first introduction to Karen Voight. I could tell she is a great instructor but this workout was not for me. As soon as I popped it in and attempted to watch the routine before trying it, my first reaction was that I would have had a hard time keeping up when I was 23, much less at 43. Coming from a routine that includes Pilates, walking, and non-aerobic sculpting with weights, this was like culture shock to say the least.

My biggest problems were the very fast pace and the leg movements accompanying upper body workout. When I am working out the upper body I like to concentrate on perfecting the movements without worrying about the lower body and dislike dancing around, simultaneously doing cardio, and trying to keep my legs moving in a pattern at the same time. By the time I caught on to one movement, she switched. Very frustrating. It brought back bad memories of Jane Fonda to me. After a typical 15 hour day, I look to exercise to help me relax and unwind. The aerobic pace and the awful disco-y music had the opposite effect on me.

Worse, Karen's movements were somewhat obscured because the four exercisers behind her were all standing too close to her, which lent a confusing effect of many arms and legs swishing around. I finally found the answer to this visual confusion was to concentrate on one of the men to her left, since he had no one directly in back of him and his movements were much easier to follow. The two women in the back row were little more than clutter - you couldn't see their moves at all and they added to the overall cramped feel of an otherwise expansive studio setting.

If, like me, you don't care to contend with fast pacing, grating music that drones out the instructor's voice, and choreography when you're trying to concentrate on correct form, you will want to pass this up. But if you're a high energy, aerobics type who likes to follow hyperactive dance-y routines, you might like this one.

On a final note, even though I gave up on the upper body, I briefly checked out the lower body floor work and that seemed to be more along the lines of what I was looking for. Good sculpting but no option to turn the music off.",1187222400,27,2190,4.440298507462686
575078,5,6303106862,"If fatique and sore muscles are any indication of a good workout, I definitely got my money's worth with this DVD.  Like other reviewers, I had to move down a level with my hand weights and remove my leg weight for the first few times I did this workout.  But no complaints here.  I love the results.

Karen is very careful to explain proper technique and help you understand the difference between muscle fatigue and muscle exhaustion.  I found the number of reps to be perfect.  Besides, if there are too many reps, you just do every other one, right?  I also love the length of Karen's workouts.  There's lots of data to indicate that an hour of physical activity every day will greatly reduce your risk for all kinds of health problems.  I really believe that if I can find an hour to workout every day, almost anybody can.  It's about prioritizing your health.",1180656000,,865,4.52258064516129
575079,5,6303106862,"One thing I love about this workout is that it is a routine that is easy to learn. There is nothing more frustrating that doing a dvd that has you jump, circle, backflip, sit down, stand up, roll over etc at such a pace that you would never learn it. Then they say something like ok reverse! Boom and you are supposed to do it a lightening speed. This didn't have that, thank god! It was a very challenging workout and at times I had to rest. My abs feel really worked and if that section was any longer I wouldn't have finished it, so I am glad it was only 15 minutes, even though it seemed much longer. 2 or 3lb dumbbells are recommended but I used 1lb wieghts and switched off to the 2lb ones as I felt more comfortable. It was a very good workout with just the 1lb and I recommend starting there. Get this one it is worth it!",1180224000,8,829,4.060975609756097
575080,5,6303106862,"This video starts with a warm-up, then about 6 minutes of standing legwork which is fabulous, then goes into a 20 minute arm workout.  This is then followed by a 30 minute lower body workout, abs and finally cooldown.  The thing that I love about this video is that you can do all of it, or break it down into different workouts.  Sometimes I only have a half hour, so I do the upper body workout.  You can make the exercises as easy or as difficult as you would like but varying the weights.  She does an awesome job explaining how to do each exercise to optimize the benefits as well.  I do this video a couple times a week and see results.  I love it!",1168300800,8,654,4.142857142857143
575081,5,6303106862,"This dvd is an absolute must, a classic and totally necessary for anyone serious about keeoing fit. One can do it in parts or all together, which is quite a challenge. Karen is thorough and knows exactly what shes talking about.",1163030400,9,228,4.585365853658536
575082,5,6303106862,"Let me clear this up....if you are a true exercise fanatic, this dvd is for you.  I've done every dvd exercise program including Taebo and this ranks in my top 2.  Taebo is awesome for the cardio but when it comes down to muscle tone, this dvd is tops.  The background music and background exercise people are the least of my worries, you have to concentrate on the exercises she does to TONE YOUR BODY!!!  These exercises are an all over workout.  My favorite part is the 20 minute arm workout, my arms never looked so good!! She works the hell out of you and it took me a few times to get through it but if you want to tone up and get in shape, just put in this DVD and be prepared to SWEAT!!!!",1161734400,33,696,4.088235294117647

575084,5,6303106862,"This is a wonderful weight training DVD.

- There is a 6.5 minute warm up

- 6.5 minutes lower body workout (standing up) with dumbbells

- 20 minutes upper body workout with dumbbells

- 30 minutes lower body on the floor with ankle weights

- 15 minutes of abs (great section)

- 6 minutes of stretching

I like this DVD because:

- It's also aerobic. Except for the lower body on the floor routine and the abs routine, she has you moving around while you're lifting weights. Upper body and lower body moves are often combined.

- You get a rather long workout if you choose. Personally I can't do the whole thing in one sitting. It's really intense.

- It really challenges your muscles and gets them to that place where you don't think you can do another rep, but you do. So the muscle has that good fatigue afterwards.

What I don't like about it:

- They are little goofy. They hoot and she teases them about more reps. It's a little co-ed movie-ish.

- She doesn't really tell you what the count is and then she'll change it on you. I'm not sure; but maybe she does this so you don't allow yourself to relax at the end of a set because you know it's about to end. Maybe she wants to keep you on your toes?? Not sure.",1152230400,18,1223,4.219827586206897
575085,5,6303106862,This is a great tape for anyone who wants a challenge!  You will deinately feel it in the legs.  I have the Ultimate Step Circuit and Burn and Firm and prefer this one as it seems to take you to depletion...until you can't do anymore.  Karen Voight is excellent at cueing and reminding about technique.  Comparable to The Firm Lower Body Split...another 5 star recommendation for feeling the burn!,1150416000,2,397,4.7101449275362315
575197,5,6303106862,"Once again, thinking that I was in great shape, I added yet another workout to my library to ""mix things up.""  Part of my workout routine includes alternating upper and lower body workouts within my usual routines, and since I have discovered ""Karen Voight,"" I thought I would try her ""Great Weighted Workout.""  The DVD allows one to ""mix and match"" routines, which work out to be approximately 35-40 minutes per upper or lower body, or do the entire workout, which is about 80 minutes.  I had only been doing the ""mix and match,"" which are pretty challenging in themselves, but finally decided to do the entire routine.  WHEW!  Because of the intensity of doing the ""upper"" and ""lower"" workouts, I knew the workout would be tough, and it is.  I would not recommend this workout for beginners because of the intensity and fast pace, but if one is a beginner, one may want to ""mix and match"" and either begin with very light weights (dumbbells, ankle weights and a small body ball are used), or no weights at all until one is comfortable moving up a notch.

I use reasonably heavy weights (dumbbells and ankle) for my workouts, but because Karen's pace is very fast, I found myself not being able to keep up with the exercises using the heavy weights and stuck with 5 pound dumbbells for the upper body--I used my heavier weights and ankle weights for the lower body and abdomen sections, but during the standing lower body routine, Karen does combine both leg and arm movements with the dumbbells, so for the squats I could use the heavy weights--when she would work the arms (bicep and other moves) and legs together, it was difficult to keep the pace using heavier weights.  I would definitely suggest that one keep several sets of weights (3-5-8+) in case one cannot keep up with the fast paced moves, or if the weights become too heavy one can lower the weight.  Additionally, the DVD recommends ""light dumbbells, ankle weights, a body ball and a mat...""

Although the release date is 1991, the routine is not dated.  It is well structured with a good warm-up, standing lower body workout (squats and squats with arm movements using weights and quite a bit of ""swinging"" of the weights, which is why I would not recommend too heavy weights), a really fast-paced, thorough upper body weight workout (I was huffing and puffing by then!), and a lower body floor routine using ankle weights, a weighted body ball (I have never used these, but they look like a good alternative to using a weight on one's leg for extra resistance), and/or a weight for added resistance.  Again, the routine is fast-paced and she really works the muscles--outer/inner thighs, quads, hamstrings, buttocks...Believe me, I felt it all!  She then moves to the abdomen using the ankle weights, body ball or dumbbell option, and finally finishes the routine with a good stretch.  Believe me, one will be saying ""THANK YOU!"" when that stretch comes, but one will and should feel completely ""worked out!""

During the routine, especially the standing lower and upper body, I could really feel my heartrate climb, so again, be prepared to feel some aerobic benefits with this weighted workout.  When I first did the routine alternating upper and lower, I was really sore the next day, but it was a ""good workout"" sore.  Doing the entire routine is something I will incorporate probably once-a-week in order to perform a totally tough, invigorating, top-of-the-line workout.  One certainly gets one's money's worth, so to speak, but more important, one will receive an excellent workout--whether ""mixing and matching"" routines, or doing the entire workout.

Although I truly recommend this workout for those who want to improve their fitness through a good weight routine, I must stress again that if one is beginning, go easy or one may end up with injuries--so work into it.  If one's a regular exerciser who wants to add a bit of toughness to one's routine, this DVD really works.  Be prepared though...Once again I thought I was in great shape and STILL found myself very sore the next day!

Check out Karen's body during the workout--she has great muscles and muscle tone, which is a great incentive!  Good job Karen!",1149292800,26,4192,4.7997218358831715

575199,4,6303106862,"My criticisms are there are form corrections missing in some exercises and there is really no proper breathing instruction. Their outfits are dated (which is amusing) but the exercises are very challenging and some of the moves were awkward for me and could be really dangerous to a ""nubie"". I didn't really groove on the warm-up portion at all - it was okay. However, I thought the upper body work-out was effective and I thought her cool downs and stretching portions were great. Again, not for the uninitiated - should you buy this DVD I would recommend doing a run through with no weights (or if you must use 1-3 lb wrist weights) so you can concentrate on getting the moves/form correct. There are no fancy foot moves which I like. I've done many home video workouts and this one was really long and super tough. I'm really traditional so I will stick to my Tammy & Minna videos.

I read one review where the reviewer was complaining of the music on this video being boring, but I personally do not think the music is boring at all.  However, I do not need music to be motivated.  I am motivated by knowing that I am going to see actual results from using Karen Voight's video.  ********** 10 stars!!!",1124064000,3,736,4.321167883211679
575205,3,6303106862,"This tape is NOT 30 minutes long!!!  It is 85 MINUTES long.  I'm not sure what tape these people are reviewing.  This is a super challenging tape even for advanced users!  You can really hurt yourself if you are not careful.  Also, unless you are very young and eat right to begin with, you are NOT going to drop 4 sizes by doing this tape - or any tape - that does not even make any sense whatsoever.  Just be forwarned, that Karen Voight is not for beginners.  I think her tapes bring you to the point of over-worked.  I like her and her style, but her workouts are too long and can make you feel defeated.  I like the shorter tapes by The Firm and Denise Austin has some tapes that are broken down into 20 minutes.  You can do all 40 minutes, or what I like to do is 20 minutes of her kick boxing or Blast Aaway 10 pounds combined with Jane Fonda's weight workout or Arms and Abs of Steel with Tami Lee Webb.  They are both about 20 minutes each and that is long enough!  I don't know who has time for an 85 minute workout anyhow.  Almost all the instructors out there will tell you moderate exercise and healthy eating is the base for long term results.  Happy workouts!",1122768000,,1174,4.16
575206,4,6303106862,"I just got this video last week and tried it on Saturday. All in all it's not a bad video. The only thing that I did not like about it was this one part where it seemed as though she was going rather fast. I especially liked the leg segment, and I am sure that once I get the ankle weights I will feel it even more the next day, and my butt and legs hurt pretty good without the weights!!  The ab segment was great also.  I do my abs every day and I had to stop a couple of times during that segment.

While I've heard some complaints about the length of the video, I did not find it to be too long.

If you are looking for a good weights-only video I think this is the one for you.",1113177600,50,682,3.7816901408450705
575287,5,6303106862,Karen is wonderful. You can do her workout without trying to fiugre out her routines. She is the best aerobics teacher and her routines work. It is never boring.,1109376000,13,161,4.586206896551724
575288,5,6303106862,"I do this workout when I want to be sore for a day or two.  I'm a Karen Voight convert now (sorry Kathy Smith).  The first time I did it with 3lb weights and that was a mistake; be sure to start out easy in the beginning.  The floor exercises at the end are excellent....especially the abdominal segment.  A great production, definitely a favorite go-to.",1106870400,32,354,4.4
575289,5,6303106862,"This dvd is awesome. I have been exercising on and off for a while. I bought this video so that I can  focus more on building lean muscles. The workouts are great. After doing only a portion (30 min. of leg work)of the video, my muscles were tired and not only that. Those muscles were sore for 2 days after. So as you can tell the workouts are very effective even though the weights you are using  may range from 1 to 5 pounds(for women).

Girls if you want to get in shape, this would be a great buy.

The entire dvd is approx. 1 hr and 25 min.

Sections:

Warmup -  6  min.

Standing leg work - 6  min.

Upper Body -  25 min.

Lower Body -  30 min.

Abs -  15 min.",1102032000,154,667,3.8656716417910446
575290,2,6303106862,"I already own 3-4 tapes and one DVD by Karen, and the common denominator is that they are too long. I thought this would be a challenging workout, but I was so bored with the amount of repetitions needed I've only done it all the way through once!!  I don't think I could face it again without fast forwarding through a few reps!!  Even the music was boring!

If it weren't for one of the fine male members of her class, I'd have given up much earlier!!

I'd recommend Kathy Smith's Lift Weights to Lose Weight Vol One - Vol Two is good too (but for a bit of back pain in the glute section) and they BOTH have great music! Kathy Smith tapes ALWAYS have great motivating music, and motivation is key, but the music on Karen's tapes is nearly always awful. Karen's best workout is the one she did with Elle Macpherson.",1091577600,4,816,4.279220779220779
575291,5,6303106862,"Karen Voight work out with weights is simply the best work out video tape on the market. I lost 20lbs last summer doing the tape on days I was home from the beach. I dident even know i'd lost weight. I did not diet, and lost 4 sizes. The tape makes you really strong. You do not just lose weight you firm up. It's never boring either. 30 minutes your in your out its done. All you need is hand and ankle weights. It's not to hard. You don't have to jump all over the place. It is very simple. I started with 10 minutes a day. Anyone can do this. You will love it.",1054425600,3,563,3.9043478260869566
575292,5,6303106862,"I have been working out, by either going to a gym or doing videos at home, for over 20 years (with only a few, unfortunate,slack times thrown in). This tape is the best! It was my first Karen Voight tape and won't be my last... I'm ordering another one when I complete this review.
No stranger to weight training, I was truly shocked that I had to use less weight in order to keep up, even to the extent that I remove my ankle weight for the quad work.
I love her music choices, since I need a driving beat to keep moving or I get bored. My only complaint is that she didn't dub the vocals out... the singing competes with her voice at times plus, and this is the worst part, the words to the song keep going around and around my head AFTER the tape is off. :-)
To all of you who wonder how the guys can be using 10+ lb weights during the arm section, watch very carefully when they drop the weights at the end of the first section... they bounce! I know I felt better seeing that they were just props.",1053043200,9,1002,4.065656565656566
575293,5,6303106862,"Warning! This workout is not for the novice exerciser.  I am a big fan of Karen Voight and find her to be one of the finest fitness experts around today.  Her workouts are normally geared toward the immediate to advanced exerciser.  This workout is intense and very, very, very effective! But way tooooooo long, 85 minutes to be exact.  I use this video one to two days a week (depending on my schedule). There is a natural break in between the workout making it possible to divide the workout into two segments. You could do the first part of the workout in the morning and the other part in the evening or can do them on two different days. This is one video tape that does not get rotated out of my workout schedule.  It one of my regulars because it stills challenges me.",1027900800,12,775,4.354166666666667
575294,5,6303106862,"Great for upper body, abdominals and legs. Highly recommended for anyone who is serious about exercising. 85 minutes of challenging weighted routine that will definitely sculpt legs, buttocks and upper body. Not for the beginner exerciser. My only complaint is the ugly annoying music.",1025568000,5,285,5.5
575295,5,6303106862,"This is the toughest weight exercise tape I have done.  Leave it to Karen Voight to produce an 85 minute killer.  Also, leave it to Karen Voight to produce a video jam-packed with interesting combinations compiled in such a way that the workout flies by.  Karen Voight is top in her field for a reason.  Her incredible cueing, her instructions and the exercises themselves work amazingly well.  This video is no exception.  Working the enire body, Karen concentrates on specific areas, but keeps the entire body moving throughout the video.  Although the background is a bit dated as well as the flowered leotards, the workout is not.  My only gripe is that she talks over the music in the background....the music would be good if it was more than muddled backgound noise.  But the workout is so complete and novel, that this flaw can be overlooked.  Truly another killer by Karen Voight!",1025568000,3,888,4.782894736842105
7839333,1,6303106862,"There is nothing more frustrating than spending your money and your time on something and having it turn out to be a complete bust. Waking up at 6:00 am to start a workout only to find it lacking in direction completely, leaving you without any idea as to how to safely perform the exercises is awful. If you are going to create a workout video - where you are the ""teacher"" you need to actually teach. This video can leave one with a pulled back, a hip out of join, you name it. Stay away from this one.",1512345600,,504,4.153061224489796
7839334,5,6303106862,"I just read a review that said this workout is not for anyone over 40.  Really?  I'm almost 70 and workout an hour daily.  I was quite capable of doing these exercises, and even in some cases making them more challenging by adding additional weights.  I absolutely love this Karen Voight dvd.  She is a fantastic teacher, all of her instructions are crystal clear and she has a warm and motivating personality.  Some of the exercises utilize a small, weighted ball, but in most cases you can find ways to improvise.  The total workout is over an hour and 20 minutes, which is a big bang for your buck.  The dvd is formatted so that it's easy to do it section by section.  I get bored working out with one instructor for more than half an hour, so I switch to a different dvd(s) to do a second or third part of my workout routine.  Anyway, please don't be put off because the outfits worn in this dvd are out of date.  Who cares?  It's an excellent and classic workout.  I'm super happy that I purchased it, and will be looking for more dvds by Karen Voight.",1506211200,2,1057,4.304568527918781
