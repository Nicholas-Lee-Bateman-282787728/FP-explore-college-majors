6403476,5,B00K6DEQ92,good collection at an even better price,1405123200,,39,4.714285714285714
6403477,5,B00K6DEQ92,Well worth the money!!!  We love Dr. Who!!,1405036800,,42,4.25
6403478,3,B00K6DEQ92,"I will not buy this set because I haven't received enough information.  What is important to me are the total numbers of hours on the disk.  I want to know how much I'd be paying per hour.  Four disks for $177 means that I'd be paying $44.25 per disk.  Considering they are only DVD disks, not BluRay, that's far too expensive.

I'll wait until they show up on BluRay at a lower price.",1404518400,5,385,4.219178082191781
6403479,5,B00K6DEQ92,"This was an awesome deal.  At less than $25/season, the Doctor Who parties can continue for an eternity.
I would recommend this to all Whovians.",1403308800,,144,4.76
6403480,5,B00K6DEQ92,"I am not a big Dr. Who fan, but my husband is. But after watching the series featuring David Tennant, I just might change my mind. I have found my favorite Dr. Who. What a great actor. He made the show fun and interesting for me. I'd love to see him in some other movies or shows too.",1402358400,19,284,3.913793103448276
6403481,5,B00K6DEQ92,"I want to buy this collection, but I won't,WHY?
Because I have spent over 5000$ for Sony 55"" HDTV/Onkyo
7.2 home theater system/top line Sony Blue Ray player.
I will not buy any of my favorite TV programs or movies
in the old horrid format,unless they cannot be done in HD.
This collection was shown in HD on BBC America,so should
be available on bd.

Easy.",1402272000,25,357,4.409090909090909

6403491,5,B00K6DEQ92,"I am the alien in a house of Classic Doctor Who fans. Then, I discovered David Tennant!  Now I am as devoted to the programme as the rest of my family. They say ""you never forget your first Doctor"" and I know this to be true.  This collection is a must have for all Whovians.",1423526400,2,275,3.981818181818182
6403492,2,B00K6DEQ92,"The package was delivered promptly, and looked fine on the outside. The cases to season three and four were splintered significantly. The season two and specials case and discs were fine and played well. All the discs to the 3rd season are scratched and skip, only the first two discs of season four will play.",1422835200,2,310,4.654545454545454
6403493,5,B00K6DEQ92,Love this show enough to buy all the seasons to add to our collection for re-watching,1421107200,,85,4.375
6403494,5,B00K6DEQ92,"A pretty self-explanatory product. Not a box set, so just the four individual seasons shrink-wrapped.",1420329600,,101,5.8
6403495,4,B00K6DEQ92,Another great doctor who series,1419120000,,31,5.4
6403496,5,B00K6DEQ92,"I liked the 9th Doctor. But the 10th Doctor... my favorite doctor. The lead David Tennant is amazing! While the rest of the supporting cast is not as strong, they eventually grow on you. The 2 leads (doctor and his companion) were always enjoyable to watch. I love how each companion was unique, and brought something different out in the doctor during their time with him. But again, David Tennant fans... a must own. Oh and the episode Blink... one of the best. You will never look at statues the same. You'll see...",1418947200,6,518,4.580645161290323
6403497,5,B00K6DEQ92,"DVD sets arrived in perfect condition, my 14 y/o Dr. Who-obsessed son loves them.  My only complaint is that I wish these sets were available in Blu-ray.  As it is you can only get the Blu versions in the 50th anniversary super collectors set, which in out of production and goes for ridiculous amounts in the secondary market.",1418688000,3,327,4.620689655172414
6403498,5,B00K6DEQ92,"The description for the DVD was a bit confusing and almost prevented me from purchasing it. This is not like the Matt Smith Years, placed in a special box set with a book and all of that.

It is each individual season (including the specials). They're all in separate cases. It's not 4 DVDs, but 4 DVD cases. It has the special features that you would normally get. I bought it for $99.99, so it was a steal! Especially when each season is around $40 or more a piece.

Each DVD has Galifreyian and a character (including companions and aliens) beautifully placed on the surface. It's shiny.

High recommend it, but I do wish that they'd come out with a box set like Matt Smith's Years. Maybe they will, but I'm content.",1417910400,22,719,4.431818181818182
6403499,5,B00K6DEQ92,Tennant gives a fine performance. Does justice to a very good long running character.,1415491200,,85,5.142857142857143
6403500,5,B00K6DEQ92,"Fabulous!  Highly recommended for Doctor #10 fans.  David Tennant is a fine actor as are all of his ""sidekicks"".  Really, the only stories that I didn't care for were ""Blink"" and ""Lovers and Monsters"".  Not enough Doctor in them.  But this collection is marvelous as long as I can access closed captioning!  Without cc you miss many of the throw away lines and obvious adlibs.",1409788800,,376,4.707692307692308
6403501,5,B00K6DEQ92,Hoooray! I've been waiting for deals like this to come out for awhile. I think 10 is still my favorite Doctor although there's awesome character changes throughout the entire history of the show. I'm so glad I can finally complete this portion of the collection. :),1409011200,,265,4.782608695652174

6403503,5,B00K6DEQ92,I've been a Whovian since the Tom Baker days. I find David very entertaining and humorous while keeping with the traditions of Dr. Who behavior. I can say without a doubt this is a win win collection.,1406592000,6,200,4.4324324324324325

6403505,5,B00K6DEQ92,"Well it is David Tennant as the Doctor. He may not be my very favorite actor to play the role, but he is simply amazing. The various seasons form a beautiful arc as he goes from learning the character to becoming the character to owning the character. Great entertainment and lots of fun to share.",1405814400,3,297,4.418181818181818

8656249,5,B00K6DEQ92,"I am a Doctor Who aficionado. I started watching this series back in the 80's when they were broadcast on public TV on UHF. Of course Tom Baker is the most liked of all of the Doctors.
Earlier this year (March) I purchased Christopher Eccleston, David Tennant, Matt Smith and Peter Capaldi Doctor Who series. My favorite is Matt Smith, then David Tennant, then Peter Capaldi and finally Christopher Eccleston. I realiz e that the stories have gotten more complex and engaging as the writing for the series has become more engaging and revealing with each succession. Peter Capaldi enduring four and one-half billion years was impressive in my opinion. You will have to see it.
David Tennant is excellent as the Doctor. Good stories and some mystery. After all-why do we watch this series?",1478304000,4,788,4.844444444444444
