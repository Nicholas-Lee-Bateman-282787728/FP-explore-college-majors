8462967,5,B0059GVBDK,"Buffaloe Bill Jr. is an excellent family western. There is no bad language, and no extreme violence. In fact, there is much comical entertainment in each of the episodes. The shows are from the 1950s; nevertheless, the picture and sound quality are very good. I have watched all of the episodes, and I have started viewing them again.",1358640000,,334,4.775862068965517
