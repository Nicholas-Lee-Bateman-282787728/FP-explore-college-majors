8426789,5,B004ED6Q4S,"Pastor Boonstra delivers a powerful message on God's presence in relating the earthly tabernacle to the Heavenly Tabernacle. He also teaches on the Feast Days and how it relates to the coming of Jesus Christ, and much more. All of these  heavenly symbols have an awesome symbolic meaning in which the bible will interpret itself. Get ready to explore ""The Presence"", the supporting bible based scriptures, and you will know the true meaning of what it is like to be in God's Presence and how we need to approach HIM through Jesus Christ. Amen!",1321142400,,543,4.776595744680851
