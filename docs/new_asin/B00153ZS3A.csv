The first hour is almost entirely rehashing 2007 and 2004 ...before they get into Rookies and then the all time team...which in the last hour bounces around without much chronology and oh yeah...finally presents the great YAZ at the 1:48 mark into the documentary with 5 minutes left? I honestly think BILL LEE got more coverage than YAZ and Ted Williams. The history element is hysterically bad..bumping from the early 1900's to a quick 1946 to 1975 to 86 all in the span of a couple of minutes.  I'm very GLAD I found this used for $5.
the DVD ""Boston Red Sox 100 years of Baseball History"" puts this to SHAME!",1210118400,20,721,4.5038167938931295

8257401,2,B00153ZS3A,"I agree with the other reviews in that there was too much footage of the 2004 and 2007 teams, which is directly pulled from other MLB DVDs.  It doesn't seem to have a clear story line, the topics bounce all around.  But the one thing that really stood out for me was that they would play the same footage AGAIN!  There would be a scene shown early in the DVD and then they would show it again later on....why???  As if we didn't notice it the first time?  This was very poorly produced, which is too bad because they did have some great vintage footage that could have made this a Red Sox fan must-have.",1300579200,,603,4.208695652173913
8257402,5,B00153ZS3A,"This is a good video and it is a great price. It is a really good way to relive your memories('04,'07) and to see some of the other moments in Red Sox history if you weren't alive for when they happened. Also this is a pretty long movie so you're getting a lot for your money, even though it is only on one disc. I would recommend this to anyone who loves the history of the sox, or like I said earlier just wants to see the highlights again to relive their memories.",1257033600,,467,4.032258064516129
8257403,1,B00153ZS3A,"I waited for this movie to be released and was so upset with it. It is called red sox memories: the greatest moments in boston baseball history, and should be renamed  The Greatest Moments of the 2007 season and other players. By the name I expected to see great segments on Yaz, Fisk, Clemens, Evans, Rice, Foxx, Boggs etc, instead you get every bit of the 2007 season and a tiny bit of history. Not enough time was spent on past greats. Also too much time spent on garciaparra. Good buy at $5 or less other than that STAY AWAY. A perfect pink hat movie!",1217894400,9,555,4.285714285714286
8257404,5,B00153ZS3A,"This DVD will certainly remind Bostonians why to be proud of their hometown.  It highlights the Sox's recent victory in the World Series (so don't even think about watching this if you are a Rockies fan) and further delves into the team's history of notable moments and significant players.  I am not a huge fan of the Red Sox, but having lived in the city of Boston showed me how to feel proud of the sport!",1213401600,4,408,4.355263157894737
