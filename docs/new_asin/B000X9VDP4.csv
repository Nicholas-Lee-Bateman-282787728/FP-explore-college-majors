8227503,3,B000X9VDP4,"This DVD was boreing. It would make you want to sleep even before you reach the first hour of this DVD. However, the quality of instructions presented by the pilots were so good and covered new stuff that other World Air Routes DVD's pilots did not cover. In addition to that the cabin flight from Dusseldorf to Palma was entertainning. Other than that I wouldn't recommend you wasting your cash on this DVD.",1221091200,,408,4.602739726027397
