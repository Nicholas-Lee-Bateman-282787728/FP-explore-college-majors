2559251,5,B000FBFYKU,"This was one of the best series to come out of North America in recent years. Engaging and intelligent, witty and at times surreal, this comic drama will have you wishing for an enocre every time.",1147564800,13,196,4.472222222222222
2559252,5,B000FBFYKU,"A friend of mine taped this Canadian show off the Sundance Channel and mailed it to me. I have never loved a TV series more. It's hilarious and touching and features Canada's top actors in a backstage satire of a company that resembles Ontario's Stratford Festival. Don't miss ""Slings and Arrows"" if you're a theater buff. It's now a cult hit, having released three seasons on DVD, all of which I bought at Amazon.

The conceit of the show is that each season depicts the madness during rehearsals for a specific Shakespeare play. Season one centers on ""Hamlet,"" and features the alluring Paul Gross as Geoffrey Tennant, as well as Luke Kirby as an inexperienced Hollywood action-actor brought in to play the Danish prince (and beef up box-office receipts). The young and charming Rachel McAdams plays an actress who is suddenly cast as Kirby's Ophelia.

I can't recommend this series highly enough! Bravo to the show's witty and inventive creators. I know I'm not alone in hoping for a reunion special on PBS or cable or, dare I suggest it?, season four.",1145404800,18,1055,4.791208791208791
2559253,5,B000FBFYKU,"I wore out the ""On Demand"" button on my cable TV remote because i watched Slings & Arrows season one over and over.  And loved every minute.  It's funny, sad, wry, intelligent, wonderfully written and acted....every time I watched I saw something new.  Treat yourself to this gem.  (Season two just ended its U.S. run on the Sundance channel, season three will be show within the year.  I'm looking forward to them on DVD as well.)",1145404800,16,431,4.618421052631579
2559254,5,B000FBFYKU,"""Slings and Arrows"" is an intelligent, witty, sometimes moving, mostly brilliant series from Canada that is head and shoulders above anything on TV today.  If you like following a wide canvas of fascinating characters through the peaks and valleys of their lives, if you like theater, if you like brilliant ensemble work, if you like writing that is just as brilliant, this series is for you.  I hope this series opens people's eyes to some of the remarkable film and theater work going on in Canada these days.  By all means, watch ""Slings and Arrows.""  But make sure you have plenty of time.  Like a page turning novel, it won't let you go until you see the entire season.",1145059200,59,674,4.630252100840337

2559266,5,B000FBFYKU,This Canadian show about a Shakespearean Company ROCKS!  Very under-rated; wish there were more than 3 seasons.,1454976000,,111,5.529411764705882

2559268,5,B000FBFYKU,Still a great series even though it's a little old. I love Paul Gross and this has just the right amount of humor to keep you laughing and character creation to keep you interested.

2559273,5,B000FBFYKU,I find this whole series delightful. I discovered it on Netflix and watched all three seasons multiple times before it disappeared. The first two episodes set the scene and introduce us to the characters: they are not 100% indicative of the show as a whole. That's not a slam; I'd just suggest that if the first episode doesn't completely grab you to keep watching for a couple more as the series reveals itself. It's funny and touching and oddly real for a story of such extreme characters in such theatrical situations.,1439596800,,521,4.736263736263736
2559274,5,B000FBFYKU,This is my third time watching this series. It is just so so so good!!,1438819200,,70,3.7333333333333334

2559281,4,B000FBFYKU,"The answer, of course, is you will laugh.  This is a very funny series dealing with the theater life populated with all the expected zany characters and, of course, a ghost.",1435276800,,173,4.580645161290323
2559282,5,B000FBFYKU,"Do you enjoy theatre? Or just great writing? Aside from quite a few f-bombs, this is a series anyone can enjoy especially if they attend or are involved with theatre folks. The cast is excellent and the writing sharp and fun. It has a Topper-like turn (search lookup the movie or old TV show) a couple of episodes in. Rachel McAdams is delightful here. We can't wait to get Season 2 and start bingeing on that. Great stuff.",1429574400,,423,4.435897435897436

2559286,5,B000FBFYKU,"One of my favorite series of ALL TIME!  So well executed, acted, written, etc.  Also if you want to see what being in the theatre is like this is perfect.  I used this series to introduce my college freshman Acting I class what goes on behind the scenes of a production.  Love it!!",1418428800,,281,4.245283018867925
2559287,5,B000FBFYKU,Funny and tragic and full of tortured artists; great parody of the actor's life,1416873600,,79,4.714285714285714
2559288,5,B000FBFYKU,"We caught this series of three seasons when it was first aired on PBS. Watched the repeat a year later and then, a year after that rented the DVDs. So this is the fourth time we've watched, purchased from Amazon. It bears repeated watching. Because the characters are authentic enough to carry the story line; and because the story of the magic of the theater bears repeating. And this is played so very well. -- Season one was first broadcast the year after Shakespeare in Love came out, telling the same tale - the triumph of faith and commitment over the mundane realities of life. A year later Stage Beauty, with much the same theme, also provided a very satisfying reminder of the magic of staged drama. -- But what makes this provincial Canadian-based series so lovely it just that without high paid writers, directors and the very best production values the sincerity and humane striving of live theater is portrayed with vivid intensity. Very satisfying. I guess because each of the three seasons simply shows the same thing. Each time with a new story line. But always the same ardor for the joys and considerable pains creating the magic of the theater.",1415836800,,1163,4.733990147783251
2559289,5,B000FBFYKU,If you are a fan of Cananda's  Stratford Festival....this is a hoot!  Paul Gross and the rest of the cast are great.  Very funny and intelligent.,1412035200,,145,4.5
2559303,5,B000FBFYKU,"Don't delay another minute. Stop reading reviews and watch this series. I'm not kidding. You'll put the first episode on and before you know it you'll have watched the entire first season. You'll then scramble to watch the next, then the next and then....we'll, Season 3 wlll be it (all they wrote) and you will be very sad that there aren't additional seasons. The characters are vivid, the writing is clever and spot on. It's that good. No car chases or crashes here. No steamy distractions - not needed at all. No cops, no aliens, no doctors and no same 'ol, same 'ol. Just strong, well developed relationships and story arcs. This is life in the theatre; colorful, dramatic, ridiculously funny and masterfully entertaining. I told you to stop reading reviews - go watch this show now!",1409616000,,788,4.759124087591241
2559304,5,B000FBFYKU,Hilarious.,1408924800,,10,10.0
2559305,5,B000FBFYKU,An absolutely amazing portrayal of the theatre artist & the Bard!,1406678400,,65,5.0
2559306,5,B000FBFYKU,"The first series follows a fictional Canadian Shakespearean Festival (The New Burbage) as it overcomes the sudden death of its artistic director and attempts to reinvigorate itself with a production of ""Hamlet"" starring an American movie star who may or may not have the chops to pull it off; a former company member who's gone a bit bughouse but is persuaded to return to the scene and the play that was his undoing seven years prior and a gang of misfits whose behind the scenes machinations and shenanigans make what's happening backstage as interesting as what's happening on it.

Every now and again something comes along with the perfect cast, direction and writing that remind us how special television can be.  The performances are pitch perfect and the flow of the series is easy and engaging.  Anyone familiar with ""Twin Peaks"" will recognize a similar, unconventional (some might say odd) feel that you'll either love or hate.

I'll point out that a young, still relatively unknown Rachel McAdams is a standout.  Her goofy yet sexy twist on the ""ingenue"" anchors a major plot point.  Unfortunately her movie career took off after the first season aired and she was compelled to chase the Hollywood dream and was therefore written out at the beginning of Season Two.  No one can blame her for that but her departure diluted the magic formula that was ""Slings and Arrows.""",1401753600,,1381,4.8760683760683765
2559307,5,B000FBFYKU,"This was aired in Canada and did not get much traction in the US except among the acting community. Which is fine, because I love mentioning to actors that I watch and love this show. Their faces light up and full-on geekery ensues. And if I come across actors who have not seen it, it's like introducing Firefly to a sci-fi nerd who is not yet a Browncoat.",1400198400,,357,4.264705882352941
2559308,5,B000FBFYKU,Would recommend this to anyone who loves the theater and the insanity that's always just a breath away. Brilliant ensemble effort; each character is perfectly cast. It was good to see Rachel McAdams before she became a big star. If I weren't older than God I'd want to be adopted by Paul Gross and Martha Burns. They are FANTASTIC in this!,1394150400,,339,4.573770491803279
2559309,5,B000FBFYKU,"This show fire off truths about theatre and life like a Gatling gun. I love this show. The writing is superb, & the acting is amazing. If you've worked in theatre this show is one of the greatest shows of all time. If you haven't it's one of the best shows of all time.",1390867200,,269,4.0
2559310,5,B000FBFYKU,"Starring Paul Gross (remembered as Constable Benton Fraser) and a few others, the drama of the stage is best set behind the scenes.  Slings and Arrows depicts the trials of a Shakespearean company looking for patronage and audience.  The death of its artistic director opened the company to the mad direction of an ""interim"" artistic director who had left the company as an actor many years before, gone insane from a romantic betrayal.  His reputation and his weak hold on sanity are strong hurdles as he directs the complacent troupe into high art.",1388966400,,550,4.89247311827957

2559326,5,B000FBFYKU,"I loved this series, and the final two episodes count as almost perfect television. Paul Gross was wonderful, and a young Rachel McAdams shows her acting chops. Highly recommended.",1382400000,,180,5.241379310344827
2559327,5,B000FBFYKU,"I really don't understand why this show is not more famous. It's funny, well-written, incredibly well-acted, and consistently entertaining. Season One may be my favorite, but it doesn't slow down after that-- the subsequent seasons are uniquely fabulous and deeply affecting. Even if you don't like theatre, Shakespeare, ghosts, Rachel McAdams, insanity, freudian psychology, art vs. commerce debates, grisly deaths involving pig trucks, or curious lizards, you'll enjoy this brilliant show.",1381708800,,491,5.929577464788732
2559328,5,B000FBFYKU,"This drama about the denizens of Canadian theatre company in the town of Burbage is excellent from Season One Episode One right through to the final Season Three Episode Six. I point this out because so many TV series lose steam as they progress from episode to episode and season to season. Not Slings and Arrows.

It cleverly inserts well-done scenes from Shakespeare in a most entertaining manner. Hamlet was the play being produced during Season One, and amazingly, from watching Slings and Arrows, I learned much about the text of Hamlet.  So much so that after watching Season One, I had to go back and watch Hamlet again.

It is a series in which you will care about the characters. You will like some of the characters and be ready to strangle others. Don't get the idea that Slings and Arrows is pedantic. It's dramatic, quirky, and fun to watch.

I took the time to write this review simply because there don't seem to be a lot of reviews and I hope that more reviews will result in more people discovering and enjoying this great series.",1381017600,,1048,4.588235294117647
2559329,4,B000FBFYKU,"Then again, I have only seen a handful. Haha. I think the acting is good and it made me chuckle from time to time. It's definitely not something I'd go back and watch over and over again, but I liked it.",1380931200,,203,3.975609756097561
2559330,5,B000FBFYKU,"Slings & Arrows is, in my opinion, a perfect TV show.  It's what television should be like.  It doesn't talk down to people, it's funny, intelligent, a little bawdy, like the Bard himself.  I'm pretty much ecstatic that I can re-watch these episodes with my Amazon Prime membership.  Bravo, Amazon!!",1380844800,,299,4.92
2559331,5,B000FBFYKU,"A great behind-the-scenes look at live theater, not pedantic, but instructional, nonetheless; funny, touching. I've watched all three of these short season a couple of times, and am very glad it was recommended me.",1380672000,,214,5.323529411764706
2559332,5,B000FBFYKU,"This series encompasses everything excellent: clever and sensitive writing; character development; direction; acting; and more.

2559361,5,B000FBFYKU,"We loved this show. Watched all three seasons in one week. We couldn't hardly stop. We have a Shakespeare Festival in our town of Kilgore, Texas every summer so watching this was just fascinating. We love the reality and the fantasy and even though it is not reminiscent of the Shakespeare festival in our town, the behind the scenes and the struggle for finances are all too real. There are hilarious scenes and heart warming scenes and I would recommend it to everyone.",1376438400,,471,4.686746987951807
2559362,5,B000FBFYKU,"I happened upon this Canadian-made TV series during a Google search for ""best TV shows of the past decade."" Having watched all of ""Mad Men,"" ""Breaking Bad,"" and ""Serenity,"" I was looking for another engaging, must-watch series. And did I strike gold!  ""Slings and Arrows,"" which aired from 2003 to 2006 on Sundance, is about a flailing Shakespearean theatre company. The writing is first-rate, the acting is gobsmackingly good, and the characters are richly drawn.  This is TV at its best.

Each season features a different Shakespearean play.  In Season 1 we get a nice, big, juicy serving of ""Hamlet,"" and, in addition to getting to know all of the various wacky-wonderful and wacky-evil series-long characters, we are served up lagniappe in the form of the talented, delicious Rachel McAdams (who went on to star in ""The Wedding Crashers"").  Luke Kirby as Jack Drew is also a fresh young face with acting chops as solidly perfect as his chiseled features. Alas, we get these gorgeous paragons of youth only in Season 1; however, the magnificent Martha Burns as the actress Ellen Fanshaw -- an actress of a certain age who fears most of all the ""you're over the hill"" message of being cast as Nurse in ""Romeo and Juliet"" -- graces the stage throughout all 18 episodes.

I don't want to give too much away about this show.  It takes a little time in the early episodes to get to know the aforementioned characters, but the investment of time yields massive rewards.  The character Geoffrey Tennant (played to mad perfection by Paul Gross) is Our Hero, ably abetted by the actor Stephen Ouimette as Oliver Wells.  These are the masthead characters; let everyone else enter stage right for your viewing pleasure and get to know each of them as they take their turns in the spotlight.

If you love theatre, if you love unconventional, if you love saucy wenches, cads, ne'er-do-wells, good ale and Shakespeare, if you can imagine a title song called ""Cheer Up, Hamlet"" with lyrics that include: ""Your incessant monologizing fills the castle with ennui,Your antic disposition is embarrassing to see, And by the way, you sulky brat, the answer is ""TO BE""!,""if you ever went to a Renaissance Faire -- in costume -- this show is likely for you.

Unfortunately, there exists only three seasons of six episodes each, so our joys in beholding this delightful show are fleeting.  However, get thee to Amazon Prime -- free to members! -- and start tonight. Grab your bloke (or wench), grab that ale, make some popcorn and sit yourself front row center for some true entertainment.  As a friend once said to me about a book he loved, I envy you your first encounter with it!",1376006400,,2661,4.783842794759825

This show (specifically Paul Gross who plays Geoffrey Tennant) allows you to feel the joy, passion, fear, thrills, excitement, anxiety etc. of theatre actors. It's categorized as a comedy, but I think it is probably more like a lighthearted drama.

Geoffrey, Ellen & Oliver were best friends and actors together. Geof/Ellen madly in love, Oliver the gay best friend who was constantly left behind as the couple went off to share private moments -- which is understandable, but a little painful if you're Oliver.

At some point Oliver & Ellen knocked boots and Geof had a breakdown...which began in the middle of a live performance of Hamlet.

Years later Oliver is killed and Geof is hired to fill in and direct a cast which includes Ellen. Tough enough situation to deal with the ex and Hamlet again - and everyone wondering if he's still crazy, but now he also sees and speaks with dead Oliver!

2559442,5,B000FBFYKU,"Smart, literate and very funny, Slings and Arrow is compelling watching and simply brilliant--the kind of series I'm always hoping to find and seldom do.

This behind the scenes look at ""theater people"" is dramatic and so human. The dichotomy between what the audience sees and what goes on back- and off-stage is something most people are unaware of.  In the first episode, the director gives a drunken observation on why so many actors drink and drug.  To paraphrase, it's a question of how else could an actor face ordinary life after the adrenaline rush of a brilliant performance.  How, indeed?

The insular world of a repertory theater, in this case The Burbage Shakespeare Festival company, with its jealousies, romances, egos and loyalties is perfectly portrayed.  This world can be the most generous and the most rigid.  The foibles of the individual are tolerated and accomodated to the fullest extent, but the show must go on every evening, cues picked up and lines delivered.  It's the most demanding of professions yet provides what is in the end merely entertainment.  This is a rather insane way to spend one's life and naturally it appeals to the most creative, emotional and expressive segment of the population.  It's bound to create high drama.  In the great tradition of Mel Brooks' immortal To Be Or Not To Be and a direct descendent of The Dresser, Slings and Arrows demonstrates how the medium is the message.

The behind the scenes machinations, power grabs and frustrations are no less involving than the larger than life personalities and egos of the actors of the Swan Theater.  The interactions of these three sets of people is credible and hilarious.  Stellar acting and splendid writing make this a must-see for any theater-lover or anyone who's ever been involved in a play or with someone who was.",1295481600,2,1829,4.915309446254072
2559453,4,B000FBFYKU,"Ever been to Stratford in Canada, a town that specializes in Shakespearean plays (among others) year-round? Well, I have -- and I have new appreciation for the thespians and managers who manage to keep those venerable theatres running, if they have to deal with half the stuff that goes on in ""Slings and Arrows Season 1."" It's a subtle, hilarious comedy with death, romance, ghosts and corporate idiocy.

As the story starts, artistic director Oliver Welles (Stephen Ouimette) is run over by a pig truck after drunkenly falling asleep in the road. His replacement: former protege and genius iconoclast Geoffrey Tennant (Paul Gross), whose acting career ended in a nervous breakdown onstage.

Unsurprisingly, the acting troupe -- including Geoffrey's ex-lover Ellen Fanshaw (Martha Burns) -- are wary of of Geoffrey's brilliant but erratic behavior. And Geoffrey isn't too sure of himself, since he seems to be seeing Oliver's ghost trying to guide him from beyond the grave (and causing Geoffrey to start screaming at thin air). And the new play he has to oversee is ""Hamlet."" Ironic, no?

To make matters worse, Geoffrey has to contend with an obnoxiously avant-garde director, Ellen's romance with a much younger man, and Jack Crew (Luke Kirby), an overanxious Hollywood action star who is starring as Hamlet. And behind the scenes, an omnivorous American businesswoman is seducing the manager -- with the intent to turn New Burbage into a shallow theatrical theme park. Will the show go on, or is this ""Hamlet"" doomed?

If I had to compare ""Slings and Arrows"" to another comedy series, it would be something like ""Arrested Development"" meets ""The Office"" (original or remake). You've got death, corporate treachery, possible insanity, horrible ""postmodern"" adaptations, weird postmortem requests, a farcical funeral, and a lizard that escapes into the theatre. Not to mention a duel (""Everybody cries when they get stabbed. There's no shame in that"").

And all this increasingly ridiculous stuff is handled in a straight-faced, non-slapsticky manner with subplots that run through the entire season -- in fact, all six episodes are actually kind of like a miniseries. The writing is simply brilliant (""I would've cut my throat, but you're not allowed to do that in front of subscribers"") and takes some brilliant comic stabs at bad actors and even worse directors (Clare's dancing ""stoned"" Ophelia).

The only major flaw is that some of the subplots are left hanging at the end of the season. Seriously, what happened to the chameleon and the old lady? We never hear!

Gross is playing the exact opposite of his famous ""Due South"" role -- his Geoffrey is wonderfully erratic, weird and devoted to his craft. Quimette and Burns are equally brilliant as Geoffrey's ghostly mentor who guides him from the great beyond, and his embittered ex-lover (who may still have a teeny tiny flame for him). And Rachel McAdams and Jack Crew have a lovely little subplot of their own as the sweetly insecure action star and a ""third fairy"" who captures his heart.

""Slings and Arrows Season 1"" is a show that is deliciously subtle, hilarious and clever -- and if you know anything about Shakespeare or putting on a play, it'll have you rolling in the aisles.",1266019200,3,3246,5.042910447761194

There are parallel story lines -- romance within and across generations, corporate backstabbing, a nagging yet helpful ghost -- but the most compelling theme addresses the craft of acting.  When the burned-out actor turned director instructs his Ophelia and his Hamlet, you know you're hearing echoes of theatrical truth going back to Richard Burbage and beyond, even unto the Greeks.  When the stage ingenue finds it amusing that her movie star boyfriend (who took a theater gig to improve his acting cred) might have learned something from Hollywood director Ron Howard, she is reminded that ""he's been around actors since he was, like, three years old.""

To date I've seen only season one, and am looking forward to the others.  It's sophisticated comedy with just enough drama to elevate it to a genre of its own.  I can't recommend it highly enough, particularly to those who have ""trod the boards.""

There are so many surprises and astonishing moments in this jaw-dropping series that I almost hesitate to tell you anything about it because part of the delight of this show for me was having no idea what was coming next.

The New Burbage Festival has seen better days. Its productions of Shakespeare are stale, the director and actors are uninspired. When the company finds itself in need of a new artistic director, a former Burbage player, Geoffrey Tennant, reluctantly takes charge despite his history (he had a mental and emotional breakdown while onstage in the middle of Hamlet, years earlier) with the company.

Economic forces are constantly at odds with art. Actors' lives are messy and dramatic. Young movie stars (think Keanu Reeves/Orlando Bloom) seek growth and legitimacy through Shakespeare. There is language and sex but if you let that put you off, you will miss moments where Tennant explains a character or an aspect of the Shakespeare play with such clarity, passion and insight that you will be staggered to think you never saw it that way before.

2559461,5,B000FBFYKU,"I watched this DVD during the writers strike when USA TODAY ran a feature on what shows to watch if your favorite show was on hiatus.  I think they said that if you were missing THE OFFICE, you would be bound to enjoy SLINGS AND ARROWS.  Well I was skeptical but then I gave it a try.  Previously, I had always caught scraps and pieces of SLINGS AND ARROWS while flicking the channels and landing on Sundance channel and I don't think I understood the snippets I was seeing.  Needless to say, like everyone else here, I was totally knocked out by the superb acting and old styl;e likeability of the star, Paul Gross, whom I had never seen before.  He holds the show together, even when his character Geoffrey Tennant is supposed to be flipping out.

What I don't understand is why the show keeps bringing Oliver Welles back week after week.  I got tired of him while he was still alive in episode one.  I couldn't believe my misfortune when as it developed, they thought it would be a smart idea to have his ghost come back and torment Geoffrey.  I thought maybe it was Geoffrey's fantasy that Oliver is there, still lovesick for him.  But they never mention the fact that Oliver loved Geoffrey.  Instead he is supposed to have had a brief affair with Ellen (Martha Burns), and that this is what drove Geoff mad.

It's clever in that it parallels part of the central situation of HAMLET, the play Geoffrey must now oversee in his new post as interim artistic director of the New Burbage Theater.  Martha Burns isn't the world's greatest actress, nor is she the Cleopatra type the script requires her to be, but somehow she's not entirely miscast, one regards her presence with a puzzled, kindly, avuncular shrug, as though to say, maybe in Canada she's sexy.  They say that Martha Burns and the man who plays Oliver Welles once co-starred in real life as Romeo and Juliet in Canada!  Now that's a production that must have been designed by Darren Nichols who was taking all the good looks out of the play and the chemistry!

Luke Kirby and Rachel McAdams are both highly appealing in their smaller roles as a US movie star come to play Hamlet in Canada a la Keanu Reeves. and the ingenue who gets to play Ophelia opposite him once a rival is put out of the way.

2559474,5,B000FBFYKU,"A friend, more literary than I, turned me on to this one, the dirty rat. I inserted Disc 1 late one evening, well expecting to be entertained but still bent on watching one and only one episode. Six 45-minute-long episodes of Season One later - and a bout of grogginess - and I was very late for work the next day (shh, don't tell anyone). I'd wondered what had ever become of Paul Gross after DUE SOUTH's cancellation, and here he is, better than ever and bigger than life in SLINGS & ARROWS, a great, great show.

Mostly, I can take or leave the Bard of Avon. I don't mind him and I'm familiar with his stuff in a general sense. And, for what it's worth, I do think Branagh's and Olivier's versions of HENRY V to be sublimely realized adaptations. But I'm more of a casual fan of Shakespeare's. But witnessing Geoffrey Tennant's passionate breaking down of Hamlet to certain of his acting troupe hit a chord and left me feeling I'm maybe missing out on something good.

SLINGS & ARROWS: SEASON 1 tells of a gifted lunatic given the reins to a troubled Canadian Shakespearian theatre festival. Down and out actor Geoffrey Tennant (Gross), having suffered an epic onstage meltdown 7 years prior, returns to the scene of the crime, the New Burbage Theatre, to pay his last respects to recently deceased, old but estranged friend Oliver Welles (Stephen Ouimette). Shockingly, the unstable Tennant is offered the job of artistic director to the New Burbage Theatre. His immediate and momumental task is to somehow turn around New Burbage's beleaguered production of Hamlet, and this before opening night.

Tennant finds pretty much everything stacked against him: a temperamental lead actress going thru the motions, a young and untested action film megastar playing the lead (and, drat, he's a Yank!), zero budgeting, ruthless profit-minded boardroom weasels undermining the show, and a crass director (and longtime nemesis of Tennant) whose postmodern notion of a Shakespearian production involves the staging of pyrotechnics and horses on stage. Oh, and there's only one dress rehearsal before opening. And a ghost is haunting Tennant. And, oh, lest we forget, Tennant is still cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs. But, what the eff, the show must go on...

Lord, I revelled in this, being made privy to the backstage goings-on, the over-the-top rivalries and petty bickerings, and the insight into what makes a stage actor, and the arduous journey which begins with vomit-inducing doubts and the trembling fright which somehow coalesce into an assured and commanding onstage performance. There are the bar-none enchanting performances. There's the writing, consistently brilliant: funny and tragic, scathing and touching, raunchy and perceptive, bright and melancholy, dramatic and human. There is biting wit and a ferocious honesty, and there is silliness and farce. There's even sweet romance here and a romance painfully dredged up from the past and another one to satisfy a mid-life crisis. And I enjoyed, really enjoyed, the cheery, irreverent ditties which frame the opening and closing credits (""Cheer Up Hamlet"" and ""Call the Understudy"").

The show would be a lesser thing without the despicable villains. Mark McKinney is perfectly smarmy and calculating as New Burbage's business manager. But his malice pales to a transparency when compared to the brutal, opportunistic ambitions of his loathsome yet sort of cute lady love Holly Day (Jennifer Irwin). Aesthetically, I cringed at Holly's Shakespeareville proposal, although the cheesy side of me couldn't help but think a place like Shakespeareville might actually be a fun thing. As Kate the understudy, Rachel McAdams glows with unaffected girl-next-door loveliness, and I wish there were more scenes of her as fragile Ophelia. And then there are the many other actors, who all found their light and admirably read their lines.

But I came to this show for Paul Gross, who made me love DUE SOUTH. As Geoffrey Tennant, he dazzles. Why, oh why, hasn't this man done more stuff? Gross's on-screen encounters with Ouimette and with Martha Burns (his wife in real life), fraught with edgy and bittersweet overtones, are showcase moments in a show already tamped down to bursting with highlight reels. Having said that, my favorite scenes are Geoffrey guiding and encouraging uncertain movie star Jack Crew (Luke Kirby). Simply wonderful. By the way, McKinney, who also had co-writing duties, admits that Jack Crew was inspired by Keanu Reeves playing Hamlet in Winnipeg.

Segue a bit to the special features, which are all on Disc 1: the trailer; 6 and a half minutes of so-so bloopers; 10 minutes of deleted and extended scenes (watch for the ""Actors!"" and ""Speak the Speech"" segments), 8 screen pages of production notes; cast filmographies; and the lyrics to ""Cheer Up Hamlet"" and ""Call the Understudy."" Not bad, but I wish there were episode commentaries or cast interviews.

So all this gush, and I haven't even seen Seasons 2 and 3 yet (but, believe me, they're on order). To folks poking their heads in, don't let the theatre setting daunt you. Yes, a theatre lover would definitely be in pig heaven. But, truly, there's so much here that's universal, no one will feel out of place. If you haven't seen this show yet, you're missing out on something really, really good. So, yeah, brush up your Shakespeare...

Lastly, in Season 1's many scenes of irony, the stand out for me is the overdramatic director Oliver Welles getting run over by a truck labled ""Canada's best hams.""",1191456000,6,5529,5.027292576419214

Next, ask a loyal Stratford theatre buff about Paul; no doubt that you'll hear of his brilliant performances as Hamlet in 2000. Paul is also a vocal advocate of the arts within Canada and an accomplished musician.

Paul's many talents truly come together on Slings and Arrows, a sendup of the internationally-known Stratford Shakespeare Festival. For those not in the know, Stratford, Ontario (named after Shakespeare's hometown of Stratford-Upon-Avon) hosts a lavish Shakespearian theater festival that runs for seven months a year, featuring some of the brightest stars of stage and screen.

Slings and Arrows is titled after Hamlet (Act 3, Scene 1) and is set in fictional New Burbage, a small, rural town that briefly flowers during tourist season. The New Burbage theater company is worn and uninspired, anchored by diva Ellen Fanshaw (played by Paul Gross's wife, Martha Burns). The artistic director Oliver Wells (Steven Ouimette) is a washed-up thespian and alcoholic who views the theater as a cash cow, nothing more. Across town, Geoffrey Tennant (Paul Gross) is struggling to save a small theater (Theatre Sans Argent, or ""Theater Without Money"") from eviction. Tennant suffered a mental breakdown seven years ago during one of Wells' productions of Hamlet, and it ended his career in the theater. On the opening night of A Midsummer Night's Dream, a very drunk Oliver calls Geoffrey from a payphone, passes out in the street, and is run over by a truck. His ghost haunts Geoffrey, who has become the interim artistic director of the festival.

Which is all...very Shakespearian in nature. The show is rich with irony, and I found myself frequently laughing at unexpected flashes of brilliance. Add to the mix the quirky cast of actors, backstage antics, and theater in-jokes, and you have an effervescent satire of theater and the state of the arts in Canada.

There are subplots involving American corporate sponsors, pot, budding love interests, and old rivalries. The dialogue is witty, the editing airtight, and the rousing opening and closing singalongs (""Cheer Up, Hamlet!"" and ""Call the Understudy"") make this a blast. Add to the fact that many members of the cast and crew are theater vets (Burns, Gross, Ouimette, Susan Coyne, and William Hutt all performed at Stratford) and Canadian screen stars (Don McKellar, Sarah Polley, Rachael McAdams).

Though the show is beloved by many who work in the theater, non-thespians will find Slings and Arrows equally engrossing. My ""theater"" background consists of working backstage on one or two high school plays and a visit to Stratford in 2002, and I absolutely loved Slings and Arrows for its blend of comedy, outstanding performances, razor-sharp dialogue, and glimpse at the backstage craziness and camaraderie. Extras include a trailer that's best left until after you've watched the first season, outtakes, production notes, cast filmographies, a list of the series' credits, and lyrics to ""Cheer Up Hamlet"" and ""Call the Understudy.""",1190246400,18,4022,5.833333333333333

It is altogether a different sort of thing than ""The Sopranos"" and other top shows in the States that are satisfying in an entirely different way. This is Noel Coward compared to, say, Tennessee Williams or something like that. Light, moving, literary but utterly unpretentious. The acting is superb. How accurately they capture the strange grandeur and embarrassing amateurishness of the theatre company. What a marvelous blend of depth and shallowness. The setup is a work of genius.

What I really love about this series is that it is never mean spirited or attacking and each character has at their core a real passion for the craft. Even the ""divas"" and ""corporate brown nosers"" ultimately are portrayed with redeemable characteristics.

""Slings and Arrows"" takes place at the New Burbage Shakespeare Festival.  Aside from having their artistic director die at the beginning of their production of ""Hamlet"", the place has been taken over by a corporate sponsor who is trying to take the theatre over and turn it into a theme park.

Actors', directorial staff, and administration staff concerns are juxtaposed amidst Shakespeare's immortal words.  You see a play taking shape as lives in the foreground rise and fall.

Along the way, it hits on some deep truths about why theater, not to mention Shakespeare, is so important to so many of us.

2559499,5,B000FBFYKU,"I must confess that I only recently learned of this series when I TV critic whose opinion I respect put it in his list of his favorite TV series along with such critically acclaimed shows such as BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS.  I was quite taken aback.  I am a big fan of both of those Peabody Award winning shows, both of them chosen in December by the American Film Institute as one of the ten finest shows on TV.  I was intrigued that a show that I had never heard of was included along with them.  So I delved into the matter and learned all I needed to know to want to see it.

I won't rehash the contents of the show because so many here have done that.  I would, however, like to comment on one aspect of the show that certainly contributes to its success and that is the extreme brevity of each of its seasons.  This is a deliciously well-written show with taut, sharply told story arcs.  But it works not despite its short length but because of it.  Many reviewers here unjustifiably slam American television.  It is unjustified because it paints the entirety of American television with too broad a brush.  Yes, there are some terrible shows, but there are also a number of amazingly good shows.  The two shows I mentioned above are great examples, though neither gets many viewers.  FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is wildly regarded as one of the most penetrating analyses of American society and small town life in decades.  BATTLESTAR GALACTICA (saddled with one of the silliest names in the history of TV) focuses on political and international issues better than many news programs (and has garnered an astonishing amount of respect from both critics and especially television producers and writers).  Shows like THE OFFICE, which against all odds turned out to be every bit as good as the BBC original (something that has astonished me).  THE WIRE and THE SOPRANOS features writing as sharp as anything you will find anywhere.  VERONICA MARS is an exceedingly well-written show, though it has been hampered by network interference.  I could go on for sometime in this vein.  If you haven't watched THE WIRE or BATTLESTAR GALACTICA (which is not, by the way, best appreciated by Sci-fi fans, who tend to be confused by the series) or FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS or UGL BETTY or recent series like ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT, you might not be in a very good position to make general statements about the state of current American television.  One could cherry pick and make American TV look dreadful, but one could also cherry pick and make it sound like the best thing since Charles Dickens.  On the other hand, an English friend once told me that we shouldn't think too highly of British television; we wouldn't, he said, think very much of the stuff that didn't make it across the Atlantic.  And furthermore, he said the best thing on British TV tended to be American imports.

I was trying to get at why SLINGS AND ARROWS succeeds so marvelously, but by a round about method.  Though there are many successful American shows, there are a large number that fail simply because they are shoved into an uncongenial format.  An example is PRISON BREAK, which enjoyed a thoroughly entertaining first season, but a terminally silly second season.  Many critics -- and I think they are right -- that PRISON BREAK should have been a 22-episode first season followed by a 13 episode second season.  American studios resist such arrangements because it precludes syndication.  SLINGS AND ARROWS will never be syndicated.  If it goes what for it is another full season it will have a grand total of 24 episodes.  The optimal minimum number for syndication is usually regarded as 100, though some do manage with less.  But many of these shows would be better off with fewer episodes.  As magnificent as BATTLESTAR GALACTICA is, the producers have been frustrated with the demands of the studio to pad seasons out.  Coupled with network demands for episodes that don't require much previous knowledge of what has been happening on the show (ignoring the blatant fact that it is precisely the involved back story that keeps the show's fanatically involved fan base coming back) you end up with 3 or 4 episodes a season that dangle incongruently apart from all the rest.  Fans, writers, producers, and critics all acknowledge that BATTLESTAR GALACTICA would be better if it consisted of 13 episodes a season instead of 20, but network pressure gets in the way of what everyone knows would be best for the show. Another example is LOST, a show with a great premise whose overall narrative has been harmed by network demands to stretch the narrative over more rather than fewer seasons (I think LOST should end after one or two more seasons, though I fear ABC will exert pressure to keep it alive for three or four more years).

Imagine SLINGS AND ARROWS if it were 22 episodes a season.  It is almost impossible to do so.  It is hard to imagine the writing staying as sharp, the arcs as tight, or the production as edgy.  It would decline in quality, we'd start seeing a string of weak episodes, and we'd see the kinds of compromises shows like BATTLSTAR has to make to keep the network happy.

So, in a way, SLINGS AND ARROWS in the context of television ends up playing about the same kind of role the Shakespeare festival plays in the context of the series.  It resists the corporation pressure to water down quality to maximize profitability.  I would like to see a lot more television on a smaller scale.  I deny that there isn't a great deal of absolutely superb American television.  But I think many if not most shows would be improved if they followed SLINGS AND ARROWS and adopted a smaller number of episodes.  Actually, there is an example of such a show in the U.S.:  THE SOPRANOS.  They not only have limited how many episodes they produce, but have sometimes taken nearly two years between seasons.  No question there is more freedom to do this on cable.  BATTLESTAR GALACTICA ended in March but will not return until January.  Hopefully, this kind of flexibility will gradually begin to permeate broadcast television as well.

Whatever the state of TV as a whole-heartedly recommend this series.  It is exceedingly well-acted, very well written, and a delight at every point.  The only downside following this season was that Hollywood discovered Rachel McAdams and stole her from Canada.  She was a wonderful presence in the first season, but the show remained strong despite her loss.  I would also like to point out that this is a completely Canadian television series.  A great deal of television is, of course, filmed in Canada, especially in Vancouver.  But virtually all of these shows are American underwritten and produced, usually with American actors in the leads with Canadian actors filling in the supporting roles.  Some current leading American TV shows fall into this category including THE L-WORD, MEN IN TREES, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, STARGATE SG-1 and STARGATE ATLANTIS, SMALLVILLE, SUPERNATURAL, and many others.  But SLINGS AND ARROWS is 100% Canadian.",1177113600,6,7079,4.793729372937293

Instead, I'll just say that I agree with all the praise piled on ""Slings & Arrows"" by others and note it is a special source of fun for anyone with backstage experience.

Call the understudy

So call the understudy

I can't go on tonight

And liquor is what will hit the spot

The play is not the thing

So call the understudy

I think it's only right

My diction will be muddy

I'll never find my light

Before the intermission I'll be pissin' on a sprite

So call the understudy

I can't go on (he can't go on!)

I won't go on (he shan't go on!)

After all, I regularly attend Oregon's like-minded festival in Ashland, and some of my best friends are Canadian.

But while it is good, it is perhaps not the seminal work of television one might think from nearby reviews on this page.

MOST REWARDING: Watching Geoffrey Tennant directing his actors in Hamlet. These scenes provide genuine insight into the process of channeling a character on-stage.

SPECIAL SHOUT-OUT: To Mark McKinney as Robert Smith-Jones, the invertebrate and very funny budget director.

RED HERRING: The woeful ""mystery"" of why Geoffrey lost his mind playing Hamlet. (And I pray for no more scenes of actors on drinking binges in Season II.)

2559526,5,B000FBFYKU,"I love this show. So far I've only seen the first season, finally getting hold of it after reading good reviews, hearing solid word of mouth, and loving the premise -- about a theatre troupe in Canada (based on Stratford fest, no doubt), where the players are trying to put on a production of ""Hamlet.""  This is trying to be accomplished in spite their personal demons and the sponsors' corporate culture scheming -- think high art vs. commercial crap. The plot is fantastic drama, and the dialogue is touching and funny, with touches of dark humor, lots of wit and memorable one-liners.

It starts with two very different theatre companies: One is run by Oliver Welles (who is directing ""Midsummer Night's Dream"") and it's a fancy, flashy production, all good looks but little integrity. The other company is run by Geoffrey Tennant, who's directing ""The Tempest"" in a run-down theatre, with no budget but a lot of heart. Geoffrey is evicted, makes a scandal by chaining himself to the theatre, and the lavish ""Midsummer"" production sells out but in the snatches of performance you see, it's not that great.

Welles, drinking to excess after the successful (financially anyways) production, tries to call Geoffrey, but Geoffrey wants nothing to do with him, due to a rift forged years ago that involved the two and Ellen Fanshaw, Geoffrey's then-girlfriend (and aren't these characters' names great?), which led to Geoffrey's mental breakdown, in the middle of a performance of ""Hamlet"" no less, which tainted his reputation and caused quite a scandal. Welles, very drunk, is obviously in crisis and ends up passing out on the road, and getting hit by a truck, and dying. And that's only in the first episode, and it sets things in motion.

From there, Geoffrey gets involved in the fancy New Burbage theatre as artistic director, and you see the goings-on behind the scenes as they try to get ""Hamlet"" produced with a lot of drama in between. You've got a corporate shark with her own vision for the theatre (basically a theme park with lots of musicals and a tiny bit of classic theatre), how she works with Mark McKinney (and I was so happy to see a KITH alum in this, and as a co-writer to boot) to try and change the company into a commercial thing.

There's a hilarious diva of a director hired to direct Hamlet, and this bring along its own clash since he and Geoffrey have a hate for one another -- diva just wants to shock the audience and Geoffrey wants to provoke them, get them feeling and thinking via good art and artistry -- diva ends up out of the picture after a hilarious sword fight, and Geoffrey takes over as director. There's Rachel McAdams as an understudy with dreams of playing Ophelia, and her budding relationship with an American movie star hired basically to headline Hamlet and fill seats (and his doubts whether he can handle the Bard's work). You've got messy love stories (unresolved issues between Geoffrey and his ex, McAdams doubts and fears over her reputation - installed in her mind after a bad actress plays with her mind), the commercialism vs. art, a lot of funny characters, and on top of that, Geoffrey is seeing Welles' ghost, how very ""Hamlet"" indeed. If you love Shakespeare and the theater you should be delighted by this, and if you love Canadian humor you'd be happy, too (that was part of the draw for me since I grew up and still live in an area where I get Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) as well as TV Ontario, so it's a welcome and familiar feeling on that level, too. And the whole damn thing is so well written and you really care about these well developed characters who are played to perfection by a great cast.

Nor did i expect to enjoy watching something about a theater company but i absolutley loved every second of it if you haven't seen it your missing out big time. Very funny and differant i've watched it over and over again i can't wait till my next dvd arrives to me haven't seen that one either but i'm sure i'll enjoy it. I say it's very much well worth the buy.,1161648000,,484,4.052083333333333
2559536,5,B000FBFYKU,"Discover this show. I don't believe it has been shown on any channel in the UK, which is ridiculous. I bought Series One based on the Amazon reviews and I TOTALLY recommend it. It hooked my entire family from start to finish. The Amazon reviewers are correct, Paul Gross is astonishing and his performance alone is worth the ticket price. It's funny, it's feel good, it's annoyingly well written and it's ensemble performance GOLD. The range of each episode is astonishing - it scoots from cartoon characters to true character, from bathos to real charm, from dark comedy to laugh out loud. It shouldn't really work, but it SO does. Series 2 is out on DVD at the end of October 2006, and I've already pre-ordered. This show thoroughly deserves raves, and it gets one from me.",1158624000,3,775,4.664233576642336
2559537,3,B000FBFYKU,I gave it a 3 star rating to be fair to the actors. I mistakenly thought it would be as family friendly as Due South.. I was wrong & tossed it in the trash after viewing part of the first episode..If the first episode has that much vulger language & sexality than it is reasonable to assume the others will follow suit..I was very dissapointed as I truly agree that Paul Gross is a very underated actor..,1157932800,9,404,4.259740259740259
2559538,5,B000FBFYKU,"This without doubt one of the best shows i've ever seen. It's funny, moving and just totally brilliant. Paul Gross is simply amazing in his role. A fantastic cast and so very well written. This is tv gold and totally addictive. I look forward to seeing the next 2 seasons.",1156550400,2,272,4.46
2559539,5,B000FBFYKU,"The Canadians got this one right.  The show is witty, whimsical and not afraid to be a little fantastic.

Anyone who works in the theater will recognise something in every chracater.  I know that stage manager.  I worked with that ingenue.

With a blantant hit at American commericalizm, this show is a must see!",1155081600,4,312,4.703703703703703
2559540,5,B000FBFYKU,"I first caught this series on Sundance, and was delighted when the DVD came out.  Bought several copies to give to other theater-loving friends, and all of them were staggered by how wonderful this show is.  Only one friend was indifferent; but he's an avant garde theater producer who thinks Mac Wellman might be getting too accessible.

It probably helps to be a theater afficionado, to enjoy this show. But, did only lawyers enjoy LA Law?  Or only cops and prostitutes enjoy Homicide: Life on the Streets?  I'll bet this show finds its larger audience on DVD.

Series 2 has already aired on The Sundance Channel; Series 3 is in the works.  I'm very excited to see more of this show!",1154217600,5,685,4.6115702479338845
2559541,5,B000FBFYKU,"Chin up, Hamlet. Chin up, Hamlet.
Buck up you, melancholy Dane
So your uncle is a cad who murdered dad and married mum
That's really no excuse to be as glum as you've become
So wise up, Hamlet.  Rise up, Hamlet
Perk up and sing a new refrain
Your incessant monologizing fills the castle with ennui
Your antic disposition is embarrassing to see
And by the way you sulky brat, the answer is ""To be.""
You're driving poor Orphelia insane
So shut up you rogue and peasant
Grow up you most unpleasant
Cheer up!  You melancholy Dane!

Be forewarned that you have to be a theater person, or at least to have spent a some time in that incarnation, to really enjoy ""Slings & Arrows.""  For me the best moment of Season 1 is when Geoffrey Tennant (Paul Gross) explains to eco-centric and largely untalented actress Claire Donner (Sabrina Grdevich), the motivation for Orphelia in the mad scene from ""Hamlet.""  Not only is it a succinct point of character analysis, but Geoffrey is as clearly wrapped up in the emotional meaning of his analysis as he is by its intellectual content.  My memories of being a director, limited and obscure as they obviously are, came flooding back, and all they ever really boiled down to was trying to get students to understand the difference between what the lines say and what they mean.  Spencer Tracy said ""Know your lines,"" three words with an obvious double meaning.  Every thing is fair game for helping people to that understanding in this world.  When his leading man announces on the eve of his first entrance, ""I'm going to throw up,"" his director immediately responds, ""Use it.""

Oliver Welles (Stephen Ouimette) is the artistic director at the New Burbage Theater, which basically does a Shakespeare festival somewhere in Canada that involves scenes shot in Toronto.  Following another by the numbers production of ""A Midsummer's Night Dream,"" Oliver gets drunk over his loss of inspiration and falls down dead drunk in the middle of the street.  We flash back to his glory days and the friendship that once was between Oliver, Geoffrey, and Ellen Fanshaw (Martha Burns).  Then Oliver has an unfortunate encounter with a delivery truck and the festival needs a new artistic director.  Infamous for his on-stage break down during a production of ""Hamlet,"" and most recently in the news for getting himself arrested for chaining himself to a building in order to keep a rundown theater open, Geoffrey is brought to New Burbage to replace Oliver.  There are two problems.  The first is that Geoffrey only showed up to fulfill a promise to Oliver recarding an old but true theater tradition regarding the character of Yorick in ""Hamlet,"" and the second is that Oliver is still around.  At least as far as Geoffrey is concerned.  The show must go on, but with Geoffrey?

""Slings & Arrows"" was originally a six-episode mini-series produced for Canada's Movie Central network, that was rebroadcast in the south of the border on the Sundance Channel (swearing is involved).  The nice thing about a six episode season is that things come full circle, and the questions you have regarding what happened with Oliver, Geoffrey and Ellen after the happy moment we see in the first episode is revealed in the final outing.  The show is filled with familiar theater types, from the two old pros who comment on everything with their acquired wisdom (and sing the songs at the beginning and end of the show), to the young would-be starlet, Kate McNab (Rachel McAdams).  There are other things going on at the New Burbage such as the back stage machinations as Holly Day (Jennifer Irwin) tries to help Richard Smith-Jones (Mark McKinney) orchestrate a palace coup to take over from May Silverstone (Marcia Bennett), Geoffrey finding than Ellen has a new and much younger boy toy, and Kate hooking up with Jack Crew (Luke Kirby), the American movie star brought in for his box office appeal more than his ability to declaim the Bard.

I round up on this two-DVD set for two reasons.  First, when the show goes on the person you really thought was going to end up playing Hamlet does not really end up playing Hamlet.  Fall prey to your own expectations and be done with you.  Second, we get to see a fair piece of ""Hamlet.""  Bits and snatches to be sure, but watching Kate reduced even Claire to tears with the singing in the mad scene that she so horribly mangled at the start completes yet another circle in the show.  Actually, there is a third reason, which combines the two, in that the end of the play seems a significant moment of conversion.  When I saw ""Shakespeare in Love"" I was absolutely convinced that in the end, when the matter of the bet came up, that when Queen Elizabeth brought up the matter of the bet that Lord Wessex would admit he had lost it because that was how powerful the play was that he had just seen.  That scene was denied us in that film, but we get something along those lines here.  Oh, and before I forget.  Do NOT watch the trailer before you watch the six episodes, because it really gives away too much of the game.  It is only six episodes and everything above should be more than enough to get you interested.  It looks like Season 2 is about ""MacBeth,"" so lead on, MacDuff, because I am ready for an encore of this cast.",1152748800,3,5277,4.656957928802589

Brilliant.

Hillarious!

And then wait eagerly for season two to be released in the fall!",1151625600,7,325,4.333333333333333

Who can I talk to, to fix that horrible mistake?",1151452800,4,362,3.9726027397260273
2559544,5,B000FBFYKU,"In the words of the Guiness animated characters:  Brilliant!

Paul Gross is the most underrated actor north of the border.  Yes, north!  'merkins like it,too.

I stumbled across this on Sundance and was immediately captivated.  Great setup, beautiful suspension of reality, Willy the Shakes would be envious.  Add in Mark McKinney as the ""evil-doer,"" and eh!, us United Stinians take heed.

Paul Gross embodied but did not hog every scene he portrayed the original Brian in Tales of the City.  For those of you who have seen it, remember the trailer park, and the bilious night back at the all-night diner, when he was told:  ""You can go.  YOU can GO!""

The Prince of Denmark with yet another layer of madness.  How can you go wrong?  What, you expected Cats?  Wicked smart entertainment, don't miss it.",1150243200,13,803,4.801470588235294

It lovingly depicts all of the fun, excitement, and insanity that goes on backstage, where the drama usually excedes anything that the audience witnesses.  When I learned of the dvd release, I immediately ordered three sets - one for myself and two for friends who still lurk in the wings.
