7962075,5,B000066734,"This is it!  Goku is finally brought back to life, and rightfully resumes his place as the main hero of DBZ!  Yep, no Goten, no Trunks, no Vegeta, and no Gohan!  Goku's finally taking center stage again, and that means big trouble for Majinn Buu, especially when that pink freak absorbs Gohan!  Can Goku defeat Buu, and save his family, his friends, and the universe?  Maybe with a little help from Vegeta... and not only that, but the coolest character in DBZ shows up for the first time!  I have only one thing to say for DBZ fans... VEGITO!  So hurry up and get this volume!",1067904000,3,577,4.386792452830188
7962076,5,B000066734,"For any fan of Dragonball Z, this DVD is a must have. When Goku returns to help Gohan things take a turn for the worse before the father and son can fuse, Gohan gets absorbed. The only people left for Goku to use the newfound Pottara earrings with, are Mr. Satan and Dende. The earrings will fuse two people together forever, plus give them a major power increase. There is a funny scene where Goku imagines himself fused with Dende, then another with Mr. Satan. Goku is about to throw the earring to Mr. Satan when he senses Vegeta soem distance away. He uses instant transmission to get to Vegeta. Sadly, Vegeta refuses to fuse with Goku, because Goku hid Super Saiyan 3 during their battle. Finally, once Buu is about to kill them, Vegeta agrees and they put on the earrings. Thus, the invincible hero, Vegito, is born. Awesome episodes and I can't wait for next months set.",1032134400,,877,4.522012578616352
