But its great to get a glimpse of him playing wonderfully.",1270425600,,124,4.434782608695652
7971383,2,B00006L93Y,"I love King's playing and have most of what he's recorded on CD. This video however, is very disappointing. The video is bad and the group isn't his usual sidemen.",1188864000,3,163,4.466666666666667
7971384,4,B00006L93Y,If you believe Freddie is really the greatest then this is more of the best you can get.  Only gave 4 Stars due to two interludes of Freddie talking across the tracks.  When will DVD Dude Directors get it that we want the artist's stuff without the break-in talk-fest.  Keep it for a special features extra.  Otherwise just wonderful. Dave,1152057600,11,339,4.6
7971385,5,B00006L93Y,"The band is incredibly tight and funky, Freddie's playing top notch, singing voice is in fantastic form...just an incredible concert.  Taped for a Dallas PBS Station in 73, Freddie and his band give it their all. The best King DVD I have and I can't recommend this one enough.  Freddie was truly was of the greatest ever to pick up a guitar.  The one thing I don't like about the DVD, is the brief insertion of an interview during ""Ain't Nobody's Business"".  That was stupid...but because the rest is so good, forgivable.

If you don't have any Freddie King on DVD, I strongly suggest you start with this one.
