4981687,1,B006A8XFZS,"This movie stinks like a dirty diaper. It makes little-to-no scene. The acting is third-rate. The story is stupid. It's loud,obnoxious and annoying. The ONLY good thing about this film is John Cena's cameo but even that fails to help this movie in the long run. I give this ""film"" a 0 out of 10.",1345161600,6,295,4.381818181818182
4981688,1,B006A8XFZS,"For those who don't know who Fred is, he's a preteen who gets into random zany hijinks that most people would find mundane, such as pouring milk into their cereal. Sounds very formulaic right? Well Fred also manipulates his voice to sound like a neutured chipmunk AT FULL VOLUME and runs around playing a hyperactive special needs child. His voice serves no purpose other than to ravage eardrums, his sense of humor is to overreact like a caffine addict to very bland scenarios.

I know I'm not the target audience here, and Fred is basically the modern form of entertainment for teenie-boppers (someone has to entertain them right?) but there's no real creativity or thought behind anything, this Fred kid just gets hopped up on sugar and films himself, then later does the obligatory voice edit in case you didn't catch that he's hyperactive. His whole internet show schtick has the same depth as LOLCATS, so maybe the internet is to blame here for this new form of entertainment that is just random pointlessness.

Kids love him sure, but happens when 'that' day comes? It's the day when they'll wake up (probably around 14-16) and think to themselves ""wow, THAT'S what I was watching"". It'll be that sobering moment of shame that will project Fred's current fans into miserable self-loathing adults. As for Fred himself, his show is pretty much one single running gimmick/joke, and because of a lack of variety he's likely doomed to obscurity by his twenties, however since there's an endless supply of pre-pubescent kids with underdeveloped senses of humour he might also stay popular, and I'd be curious to see if Fred keeps his schtick up when he has a five o'clock shadow.

P.S. Is John Cena really this desperate?",1336521600,21,1722,4.850340136054422
