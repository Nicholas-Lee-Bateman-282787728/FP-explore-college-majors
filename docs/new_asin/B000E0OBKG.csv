2476250,5,B000E0OBKG,"Natural City is a visually stunning sci-fi movie produced in South Korea. It is dark, gritty, slow-moving film noir at its best. The plot revolves around a futuristic SWAT team hunting down rogue cyborgs and the love affair between one of the men and his cyborg girlfriend who is about to ""expire"". There are plenty of comparisons both in plot and in elements within the movie to Blade Runner, and in fact the director's cut of this film on Amazon is subtitled ""Korean Blade Runner"".

However, all of that said, Natural City is not a rip-off and is an awesome movie in its own right. It has an excellent story line, great acting, incredible visuals, action-packed scenes clearly inspired by The Matrix, and a very worthy Dolby Digital 5.1 surround soundtrack. The film has English subtitles; but otherwise, you would not be able to tell it apart from a Hollywood film. On the contrary, Hollywood hasn't produced science fiction on this level for quite some time.

In particular, many months were spent building small-scale models filmed for a lot of the special effects. I still find this technique of using miniatures ""realistically superior"" to 95% of the computer graphics produced these days.

If you love dark, post-apocalyptic, film noir science fiction then you will love this movie. It's worthy-enough to reside in your DVD collection next to Blade Runner and the Alien trilogy.",1155513600,10,1386,4.939914163090129

2476252,4,B000E0OBKG,"When you pick up a Tartan DVD release you know that you're getting your moneys worth. I've seen so many great movie releases from Tartan Video that I just can't begin express how much I appreciate being able to watch their latest stuff. Just recently I got to check out a film called Natural City. A Korean science fiction picture filled with great action, drama, visuals and a damn good story that goes with it. Natural City takes place in the year 2080 after a deadly war. Advanced in technology the streets are filled with cyborgs, flying cars, and well you get the picture. We fallow a man by the name of R, who is a fellow police official. R is in love with his cyborg companion Ria. To keep Ria alive R illegally takes AI chips from other dead cyborgs. Little does R know he is about to face his biggest challenge. To fight a group of rebellious cyborgs who are hell bent on taking down the entire police force.

The first thing that came in mind when I read the actual plot was the movie Blade Runner. For the simple fact that the stories are pretty similar. You can argue that perhaps director Byung-chun Min may had some inspirations prior to writing this film. Luckily in the special features of the DVD you get to hear from the director himself as to what really inspired him and what lead him to make the movie. Hearing about the real inspiration for Natural City makes total sense when you actually finish watching it. Natural City is a beautiful film which features some of the best looking visual effects I've ever seen. Watching some of the scenes were like watching cut scenes from a next generation video game. The movie blends in a nice mixture of computer and miniature visual effects. It helps give the movie a more realistic look behind all the CGI aspects of it. It's always best to combine CGI with the real thing or even just a hand built model. The presentation is just wonderful and it's much more than just eye candy. The film also has a great yet familiar plot which plays out mostly like a well made science fiction drama.

The story doesn't go too much into the past. In the beginning there is talk about the deadly war in the dialog but not much is really explained. Instead you just stay in present time and you fallow these characters in the year 2080. The lower class live in the ruined water filled parts of the city while the middle class and above are across the bay. What the film also includes are some brief and very entertaining action sequences. Although there are only a few real big action scenes they were all fun to watch. Not only were the action scenes well shot but they were just really entertaining and fun to watch. There's even some blood and gore thrown into the mix which had my head spinning from excitement. If you're into Sci-fi films then Natural City is just the movie for you. The only real downside about it is that it's nothing new. But that alone didn't keep me from enjoying it all the way through.

To understand the logic and meaning of everything you have to go through the bonus features, which by the way are also really good. There is a featurette called 'The Story of Natural City'. You get to hear from the cast and crew about the making of the project and as I mentioned before you also get to hear from the director and his inspirations for making the film. You get a good look behind the scenes on some of the visual effects and even some of the planned out action sequences. Features also included are deleted scenes, cast interviews and trailers. If you're into science fiction dramas then I highly recommend Natural City. It's a great film with stunning impressive visuals and very entertaining action. Sure it's nothing new but if you watch it all the way through it shouldn't disappoint. Natural City is a science fiction film I definitely recommend owning.",1144800000,6,3839,4.497134670487106
2476253,3,B000E0OBKG,"NATURAL CITY (2003) Directed by Min Byong-chan. Arresting production design and state-of-the-art visual effects can't disguise a dull plot that borrows so liberally from BLADE RUNNER and GHOST IN THE SHELL that the word 'tribute' could warrant legal action. To date, this is probably the most beautiful looking AND most vapid Korean science fiction film to come down the pipeline, and one feels almost guilty in knocking it in the face of the undeniable amount of craftsmanship that went into it.

Set in a futuristic megacity in the year 2080, it's about a sullen policeman (Yu Ji-tae) who wants to extend the life of his beautiful android dancer Ria (Seo Rin) by finding a new host for her brain-chip. As she's nearing her sell-by date, which requires her complete destruction, this puts him at odds with fellow cop Noma (Yun Chan) and evil android Roy Batty...err...evil uber-android Jeon Doo-hong, who has plans on accessing android headquarters and programming a massive robot uprising. Flying police cars, slow-floating dirigibles with gigantic projection screens, endlessly vertical skyscrapers forming a mountain of technology in a post-war wasteland.

We've seen all this before. And indeed, it all looks amazing here. But what's missing is any depth of character to make the story more convincing. The leading man is a complete cipher whose motivations for prolonging the life of his robot are never explained or explored, and while his robot clearly has functional difficulties with her impending doom, Seo underplays these scenes to a fault, generating neither tension nor sympathy, only indifference about her fate. To give credit where it's due, Korean is one of the few Asian countries - and one of the few countries outside of America and Japan - even attempting high-minded science-fiction films such as this, WONDERFUL DAYS, 2009 LOST MEMORIES, and YESTERDAY. One hopes that one day, the quality of screen writing will improve to meet the superb level of technical artistry already apparent on screen.

The Korean 2-disc special edition had a remarkable array of extras that may not all be included on the U.S. edition, but hopefully they'll at least include the cool easter egg that could be found on disc 2 by arrowing up on the main menu to highlight '*REC'. This gave you access to what appeared to be a 7-minute, effects laden music video about the plight of a country devastated by a nuclear attack, which almost feels like the backstory to the main feature.",1140393600,44,2482,5.06356968215159
2476264,4,B000E0OBKG,"R is a cop who hunts down renegade cyborgs; these humanlike cyborgs only have 3 years of life and are used for everything from combat to companionship. Now, R only has a few days to save Ria, the ""doll""- a humanlike cyborg built for companionship- he has fallen in love with. Natural City is a great action/SciFi film.

The story in Natural City is great. It is somewhat similar to the fantastic ""Blade Runner"", but with less ambiguity (an element I loved in ""Blade Runner""). The action in this film is superb; plenty of shootouts, fistfights, and explosions- and a lot of slow motion. Although it is presented as a main element, the romance between R and Ria is never really fully fleshed out, but it is occasionally used effectively. It moves at a moderate pace, however, the ending really picks it up; on that note, the ending was thrilling and well-done. The music was excellent, and the acting was great. The special effects were great, they occasionally felt out of place, though. The storytelling was confusing at times- this is a film that will probably be more enjoyable during a 2nd viewing.

Overall, Natural City is a great SciFi film with amazing action sequences and a superb finale- although it is hurt by some poor storytelling. Worth purchasing for fans of SciFi or South Korean films, a rental otherwise.

Natural City has strong violence and gore, and some brief nudity.",1365465600,,1389,4.755186721991701
2476265,5,B000E0OBKG,"It might be a Blade Runner Copycat but this movie is full of entertainment it will keep you on the edge of your seat!

It's the year 2080 and the humans is at war with new created technology : Cyborgs
Cyborgs are now full time entertainer, non-stop  worker, and lethal warriors that can be a danger to mankind.
R (Yoo Ji-tae), is a member of a special squad together with his friend Noma (Yoon Chan). Their mission is to destroy all illegal Cyborgs that threat the society.
One Day, R falls in love with a Cyborg entertainer Ria (Seo Rin), who is dying of 3 years life span and must replace her chip before it's too late.
What must R do? Betray his friends and comrade and mankind? Or save the girl Cyborg he loves?

Sure, this movie has a lot material recognize from the epic classic of all time Blade Runner, but since we live in a world now where there is no new stories and Hollywood is filled with remakes and prequels, so why not?

The actors are doing a great job, I love Seo Rin as the Cyborg girl, she really play the part well as the robot who has no sould but has a human heart. You really feel for her and sometimes you feel you want to help her as well.

2476272,1,B000E0OBKG,"This movie is a real disappointment.
It is based on ""Blade Runner"", but lacks all the deep ideas that made Blade Runner so good. Blade Runner is full with violence, true, but the violence is for the purpose of the movie. Here, the violence is just for ""action"", and does not serve the movie at all.
It is just bad another action movie that uses Blade Runner as a makeup.",1230595200,3,370,4.3
2476273,3,B000E0OBKG,"Right off the top, this film loses a star for putting Doo-hong Jung in the flick and totally underutilizing him. The guy is the king of Korean martial arts flicks and he gets relegated to a few, sparse action sequences.
As for the film itself, it's not bad. For those people who feel that ""Blade Runner"" is the end-all, be-all of human/cyborg love and that no other film should ever be done that deals with that subject: stay away from this film. While it does deal with the same basic premise, it certainly sets itself apart from ""Blade Runner"". Sure, it has that very cyber-punk futuristic feel, but the story almost would pick up where BR left off. We find our main character in the last few days of his cyborg love's life and what he's doing to try and save her. But we also find the familiar Asian themes of brotherhood and love vs. loyalty/duty, self-interest vs. greater good, whereas in BR the main theme was ""what is life?"" and that was about it. So NC tends to be a bit more complex (but I still like BR far more).

The visuals are well done and the acting is pretty solid. It does have a very stylized visual approach that will remind some of ""The Matrix"". The story was just play. It seemed to wander a bit here and there and the main character's actions often seemed to contradict what the whole movie was about (read: he sure has a funny way of showing affection). Maybe there's something deeper, some underlying motivation that I missed, but I thought he just came across like a d-bag to his woman. And that runs counter to the stated purpose of the whole thing.

Basically, it's a decent movie that could have been better. The action feels restrained and the story tends to try and make itself deeper than it actually is. Performances and visuals are overall solid. Sci-fi fans should enjoy this one. Action fans will feel cheated by seeing talented martial artists going to waste. I enjoyed it, and maybe I'll watch it again someday...just not anytime soon.",1219968000,,1974,4.526610644257703
2476274,5,B000E0OBKG,"I am one of the original oficionados of Blade Runner.  This means that when no one thought it was worth a $&*&,  I was already lost inside of it.  Here was a film that investigated so many deep things and yet... it entertained.
Natural City is possibly even better, but this is 2008.  We have learned a lot about film making.  Like Blade Runner,  it has a lot of action,  it offers something (without hammering it into your head) to think about and surprise... A great yet unannoying love story.
The acting is great,  story line efficient and visuals will pleasantly keep you lost for the length of the film,  and wanting more.
Like Blade Runner,  it will take you many painless viewings to appreciate how good this film is.

What Blade Runner had that this movie seriously lacked was a)character development, b)relatable characters, c)better edited scenes and pacing, and d)Blade Runner made total sense!

This movie has got to be the best of the lot.  It goes so far as to tell a story, and had Blade Runner never existed this movie would be excellent.  But the regular nods to Blade Runner make this movie more memorable and enjoyable to watch several times over because there are so many things going on in the cinematography while the story is playing out.",1191628800,,559,4.295238095238095
2476279,3,B000E0OBKG,"Natural City (Byung-chun Min, 2003)

You know, I don't think anyone but the Asians could have had the cojones to remake Bladerunner, add in Frankenstein, throw in a dash of The Sentinel for good measure, and then stick a name like Natural City on it. And while Natural City is not--is, in fact, nowhere near--as good as any of the three films whose hearts it wears on its sleeve, it's still a good hard kick in the guts.

R (Lady Vengeance's Ji-tae Yu) and Noma (Faceless Beauty's Chang Yun) used to be best friends. Then R got himself involved with a replicant--oh, excuse me, a cyborg--named Ria (Rin Seo). Ever since, R has become increasingly distracted and slipped into an alcoholic fog. Not a good state to be in when you're a cop. There's an added problem; Cyborgs only live three years, so while the rest of his troop thinks he'll come around after Ria's put out to pasture, R is scrambling for a way to transfer Ria's consciousness into a human body so she can live on. Enter Cyon (Jae-eun Lee), a gorgeous street urchin, whom R plans to kidnap and deliver to the evil, quite insane Dr. Gion (no English translation of the name to be found in the credits), who's been experimenting with that sort of thing. Gion has teamed up with a renegade combat cyborg, Cyper (Mongol's Doo-hong Jung), who wants to create a race of combat cyborgs capable of wiping humanity out.

In other words, yeah, there's a whole lot going on here. And given how well most of it's pulled off, it's hard to believe this is Min (Phantom)'s second directorial effort, and his first stab at writing and camerawork. He's good at getting performances out of his actors, as long as you're willing to concede Chang Yun's woodenness to Noma's rather stiff character (given the caliber of the other performances here, I'm willing to give both Yun and Min the benefit of the doubt). He's got a good eye for chiaroscuro. He knows how to take what is, in the end, an impossibly complex script and make it reasonably easy to follow. As one would expect from such a thing, there are pieces of all this we don't really get to see for much of the movie (R's quest to save Ria is the main plot, and thus gets the most screen time), but Min does manage to keep it from completely losing focus (unlike, say, Altman in Gosford Park).

Now, having expounded on Min's obvious talent for so long, I'm going to dash it all to the side by saying you want to see this movie for one reason: stuff blows up. A lot of stuff blows up. This is an action/sci-fi movie. It doesn't really try to be anything more than that, and on that level, it succeeds exceptionally well. Everything else, well, that's just icing. It shows that even when the South Koreans are making mindless action pictures, they do it better than the Americans. (Come on, hold this up against any movie Arnold Schwarzenegger has made since Jingle All the Way and tell me it doesn't come up smelling like roses.) *** ",1184025600,2,2937,4.50281425891182
2476280,2,B000E0OBKG,"First the good news:  I can understand the majority of high ratings in other reviews.  This film looks fantastic and those used to Hollywood big-budget fare will not find it wanting.

The cinimetography is wonderful, and there are moments of simple, unadalterated beauty woven into the dark, rainy atmosphere.  The scenes of the protagonist's cyborg sitting on a bench at the beach (within a hologram) are enchanting.  Everything from her pose on the bench to the vibrant color that so contrasts with the rest of the film is profoundly affecting.

The special effects are first-rate, yet exist to provide an environment, not become the focus of attention.

Speaking of focus, that's the good and bad of this film.  The acting is superb, but you can't concentrate on their faces because you have to read the subtitles.  Dialogue dubbing has improved dramatically in recent years, and this film is begging for an English surround track.

That said, there are other problems.  First, the gist of the plot is that a cyborg hunter cop is stealing AI chips in an attempt to extend the life of his expiring cyborg girlfriend, whom he has fallen in love with.  Not a problem in iteself, but there is absolutely no indication for almost the entire film of any affection between them.  Only in a flashback sequence at the end do you see any signs of the love they supposedly share.  For the most part, she just sits around looking blankly at the ground.

Second, Natural City falls victem to the bad idea of filming the combat scenes too close.  I don't understand why filmmakers do this, but all you see is twirling black-clad bodies that take up the entire frame, with no sense of their surroundings, then a quick cut to someone getting offed.  Back up a little, please!

So, a mixed bag of the great and the bad.  I want to rate it higher because of it's undoubted quality, but the lows sadly beat the highs.  An English (or substitute your language of choice) track so you can watch the talented cast, better framing of the fight scenes, and a more genuine portrayal of the protagonist's relationship with his cyborg (this is the whole purpose of the movie, remember) would have made this an easy four stars.  As it stands, it's a great visual and acting treat made sour by some poor decisions.",1177632000,8,2288,4.684210526315789

The movie is excellent, with romantic music and pretty sea and sunset landscapes.

This film survives quite well on it's own merits.  The acting is uniformly superior to anything you will find in ""The Matrix"".  The two male leads are impressively charismatic, their rocky but devoted friendship an important part of the storyline as one friend falls deeply over the edge as the lifeline of his love-interest, the mechanical Ria, comes to it's end. So this is also a love story.
A lot of the best communication between characters is wordless which gives you an idea of the acting quality. The production, fight scenes & storyline are decently done. There's plenty of action, some of it beautifully choreographed. The love story is profound: It makes me wonder why some of the best love lines in cinema have been utterred by androids. I really can't understand why the producers never tried releasing this as a major release in the USA. There is a lot of candy here, & not because it's so bad. This is one movie of hi-fi sci-fi that I can watch from beginning to end without fatigue, as I have already multiple times.  That's rare for me. There are visions here that give me the shivers.

The tale told is of a society in the future full of robot or in this case cyborgs and how one criminally involved soldier has feelings for one of them. There is much more to the plot which gets disjointed and muddled in parts but I just went with it and had a good time.

8103255,3,B000E0OBKG,"Having seen numerous very good South Korean films I decided to give a try to this 2003 science-fiction movie - and I was only partially satisfied. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.

""Natural City"" is without a slightest doubt a quasi remake of the famous - and much beeter - ""Blade Runner"". The story takes place in a dystopian megalopolis (but no, this is not Los Angeles) and the year is 2080 (rather than 2019). The main ""hero"" is a certain ""R"" (instead of Rick Deckard) and he is a specialised policeman charged with tracking and killing rogue androids - for some reason those guys are called MPs, rather than being simply called ""blade runners"". Androids, called usually ""dolls"" (rather than ""replicants""), are quite numerous on Earth and some of them rebel and take to the hills (metaphorically speaking). For that reason their ""life"" is always limited to three years.

Or ""R"" is in love with a dancing ""doll"" called Ria and she is nearing her expiration date. In desperation, ""R"" contacts a shady character called Doctor Giro, who makes all kind of illegal things for the criminal underground, including escaped androids - maybe this very strange man knows how to override Ria's time-encoded ""death switch""? In the meantime, ""R"" is also part of a large effort by all the MPs to locate and terminate Cyper-N77, a particularly advanced and dangerous combat android who deserted and vanished without a trace...

That is the basis for the whole film and many more things will happen before it ends - at one moment a spunky street wise girl named Cyon, who lives on the margin of the society in the worst of the slums, will also play an important part.

PRECISION: the mention ""The war has begun"" on the cover of the DVD box has absolutely nothing to do with the content of the film! It is beyond my ken why would somebody put it there!

It is not exactly a bad film, but it is definitely mostly an attempted imitation of ""Blade Runner"", with just some more action scenes - but it is considerably inferior than Ridley Scott masterpiece. There are many unnecessary lengths, the film is surprisingly slow, the main ""hero"" is a rather pathetic and not very likeable guy, there is virtually no humour, and last but not least, the story is greatly confused - at some moments I couldn't exactly follow the plot and I didn't really feel motivated to go back and view once again the previous scenes to better understand. Also, at the end, rather than being moved, I was actually rather relieved that it was over.

Bottom line, this film has for strong points two beautiful Oriental beauties, playing Ria and Cyon, some good visions of the futuristic dystopian megalopolis, a couple of good action scenes and a serious sex-appeal for all the cyberpunk afficionados - the bad points, well, it is most of the rest. For my personal taste this is a film watchable once - I don't think I will keep the DVD.",1385337600,,2911,4.67578125
8103256,5,B000E0OBKG,"I watch many Korean films, I really should be a professional at rating these films. I enjoy all the genres of K-movies mostly drama and action or action/thriller and some horror. With that being said I would like to say that sci-fi K-movies are not as a familiar drama to me. This film had great visuals a story similar to blade runner but with a more emotional twist.
Old Boy co-star Yu Ji-Tae plays a cop named R that lives in a city in the midst of a colony war involving humans and androids. He runs into a prostitute that may be the mental host for his new found android Ria who is nearing the end of her three year life span. As a fan of Korean cinema I am always making an effort to share these films with many friends of mine, most of them find no intrest in foreign films, especially my star trek obsessed best friend who abhors Korean films.
I recommend this for anyone interested in gritty sci-fi films and this one has an emotional twist to it.
Enjoy.",1379894400,2,963,4.26775956284153
