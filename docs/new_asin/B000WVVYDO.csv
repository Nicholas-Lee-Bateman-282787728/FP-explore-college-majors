8225896,4,B000WVVYDO,"The only word for this series is ""odd."" These cartoons, while appearing to be produced on a fairly low budget, nevertheless are quite entertaining. Sam Basset cartoons frequently show up in presentations with titles like ""Worst cartoons ever,"" primarily due to some of the guest star characters being drawn somewhat ""unattractively"" let's say. But aside from the way the characters are drawn I think it's a clever, humorous concept and the writing is pretty good.",1398211200,,463,5.1866666666666665
