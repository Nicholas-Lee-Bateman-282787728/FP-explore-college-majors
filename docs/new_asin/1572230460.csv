If you're a bird lover this is a MUST SEE!!",1426896000,,292,4.214285714285714
7797417,4,1572230460,"I enjoyed this video very much, but I found it lacking in one major respect:  it gives little or no information on detecting or differentiating between various birds, or even between males and females of a particular species.

The video instead gives advice on several bird feeders and types of seed to use, depending on the type of bird you want to attract, as well as good locations for the feeders in your backyard.  The program is 60 minutes, with the 2nd half free of narration, so you can watch and listen to the birds, almost as if they were in your own backyard!  I found this portion of the video to be particularly relaxing - I almost drifted off to sleep!

Overall it is a good program, but I do not recommend it if you are interested in something to help you with bird identification.  For that, I suggest the ""Backyard Birds"" series from Terra Geographical Studies.",1120867200,3,878,4.525316455696203
7797418,5,1572230460,"My son went through a big bird craze between ages 2 and 3 and this was his favorite video, oddly enough!  He still enjoys it, and we both retain a lot of information from it after watching/overhearing it the usual kazillion times.

It's a soothing video, not dry, with a natural flow and narrative.  Lots of beautiful footage of common backyard birds of the northern USA, such as chickadees, robins, nuthatches, purple finches, cardinals, mourning doves, woodpeckers. It's also very well designed to allow you to absorb information about each bird through live footage, a friendly factual commentary, and the bird's calls.

The first half of this video includes a voiceover narration that gives a lot of good information on the specific birds, their habits, interesting facts about them, and the best ways of feeding and watering them in your back yard.  The second half shows the same footage of birds with only the sounds of the birds themselves.",1112832000,4,948,4.937106918238993
