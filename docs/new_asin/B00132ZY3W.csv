The footage quality is terrible and the entire audio is someone reading about what skills a NFL scout is looking for. The audio about Reggie McNeal is all about the size and skills needed for an NFL wide receiver. Every now and then there is cow sound. Perhaps confused with the Longhorns? There are no highlights framed by the moment such as a big win over a rival, a bowl game, or conference championship game. There have been a few moments (not many, but some)in the last 15 years for the Aggies. You won't find them here. If you read the few reviews for this DVD series for other schools you'll see similar comments. It is just pathetic. Not worth $5 let alone $25.",1237075200,3,837,4.337579617834395
