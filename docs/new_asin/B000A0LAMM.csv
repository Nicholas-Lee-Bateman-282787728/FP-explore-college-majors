If you fall into the former, then the question becomes - how bad is the print? These are not bad prints, not great, but until somebody ponies up the money to do a professional remaster, it is the best we can get.

2348312,2,B000A0LAMM,"Monogram's 1941 pairing of Bela Lugosi and The East Side Kids certainly had potential for low-brow fun. Unfortunately, the laughs and chills never materialize in ""Spooks Run Wild."" The horror icon (wearing full Dracula regalia) does his best to enliven the proceedings, but cannot overcome poor production values and misfired gags. Slightly better than the second East Side Kids collaboration  ""Ghosts on the Loose"" (1943)  only because Bela gets more screen time.",1344902400,2,464,5.430555555555555

Dubs are usually from well-aged 16mm broadcast films of quality that varies from below fair to almost good.

2348314,5,B000A0LAMM,"At a certain  point in his career Bela Lugosi decided that he would take any film that came his way and Spooks Run Wild is a strong example of this.

What you get is a teen summer camp comedy that sticks Lugosi in as a strage ghost/monster/madman as a way to bring the rest of the comedie clips together.

This film is definantly geared towards children with Lugosi stuck in as a name star to draw parents along with them.

Watching it today, it's the sections that were meant to be serious that are the most hilarious and campy, while the orignal jokes fall flat (as they must have even back in 1941.)

Overall a good unusual genre piece.",1146528000,4,639,4.336134453781512
2348315,3,B000A0LAMM,"The East Side Kids meet Dracula, er, Bela Lugosi.  Our daring and resourceful heroes, convicted of inner-city mayhem, find themsleves sentenced to a reform-school camp in the country.  These little low-buget  movies don't pretend to be more than they are.  The comedy is low-brow but  harmless.  The thrills and chills are mild enough to qualify for family  viewing.  Bela Lugosi had become a low-budget standby at this point in his  career.  The Eastside Kids, if not lovable, are tolerable in small doses.  Huntz Hall and Sunshine Sammy make the most of their comedic opportunities.  Depending on your point of view, this is a good Halloween party tape for  ""G"" rated audiences, or for more sophisticated viewers who enjoy  humor that's so dumb it's funny. Don't spend time analyzing this film.  Just kill and hour and enjoy it.",939772800,8,830,4.956204379562044

They hear a warning about a maniac who has killed three persons and may be in the vicinity. At night the boys hear some howling. A stranger comes to visit the long empty Billings estate. Dr. Van Grosch shows up next and asks the station master to keep his presence secret. The boys go exploring the countryside at night; a shot is fired and the boys seek refuge at a lone house. The owner leads them upstairs to a bedroom so PeeWee can rest well. The others will stay in another room. [There is no electricity in those days.]

PeeWee awakes and walks out of the room. The boys show up and search for him. They wander around the house. Some of the jokes are no longer funny. A stranger offers a ride to the nurse and she accepts. In town the men get their firearms to search for the monster at the Billings estate. The identity of the mysterious stranger is revealed.
