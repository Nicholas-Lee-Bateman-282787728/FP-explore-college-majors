4841826,3,B005MZSXXY,"This documentary could've been a knockout. Legendary documentarian Albert Maysles tracking McCartney in NYC only weeks after 9/11 as the star prepares to headline the benefit show. For McCartney fans, there are some great nuggets here - including rehearsal footage and McCartney dealing with a rather pushy, opportunistic fan.

The problem is, this is mostly just a well-made, gritty-looking, black and white promotional piece. McCartney was pushing a new album at the time (one of his weakest ever, ""Driving Rain"") and he makes the usual stops to talk with press people such as Howard Stern and Dan Rather. None of this has any relation to his involvement in the Concert for NY. Very little of McCartney's interaction with the plethora of superstars that played the show is seen - and what is shown displays a McCartney overly preoccupied with his ditty ""Freedom.""

By the time the final half hour rolls around, it has devolved into an alternating pattern of: A) show a little backstage glad-handing, B) show a lo-res clip from the concert broadcast, repeat.

Also very curious: where is Heather Mills? She was McCartney's constant companion during this period and she is neither seen, nor heard, nor even mentioned. I realize McCartney, post-divorce and now remarried, probably wants to do nothing that will put her in the spotlight. But for Maysles - the 'fly on the wall' verite filmmaker - to agree to edit her out of the film seems like a compromise of his art.

There are no bonus features on this disc, which is a shame. The complete McCartney set from the big concert would've been a great bonus, as the official DVD release of the Concert for NY omits two songs McCartney played that night. Maybe rights from the VH-1 broadcast were an issue, if so some additional rehearsal footage would've been appreciated.",1325548800,17,1819,4.915309446254072
4841827,4,B005MZSXXY,"The documentary is fascinating for its behind-the-scenes look at many stars from the sixties meeting and chatting before the concert.  But I do not recommend the Blu-Ray. Here's why.

It is filmed in black-and-white, giving it the classic Maysles cinema verit look. Interspersed are color snippets of songs at the concert, taken from the TV broadcast. Both of these sources are far from the resolution of today's high definition video. But with these image sources Blu-Ray turns out to be a very bad idea. You get to see the grain detail of the black and white film. That's not so bad. What is dreadful is to see the TV footage which shows every line, color fringe and stairstep of the NTSC broadcast. The problem is exaggerated by the sharpness of Blu-Ray compared with regular DVD. DVD will be a little less annoying, being slightly less sharp. (It would have been much better if they had used original concert footage instead of broadcast TV video. Perhaps copyright issues prevented this.)

Not an essential Macca video but a good addition to your library. My suggestion: Buy the DVD not the Blu-Ray of this one. It will look better on your HDTV.",1325462400,6,1150,4.768844221105527
4841828,4,B005MZSXXY,"It was 47 years ago - in 1964 - that documentary filmmaker Albert Maysles and his bother made a documentary on the arrival of the Beatle in America. When the tragic events of 9/11/2001 and former Beatle Paul McCartney found himself in New York Cirt trying to put together a benefit concert for the families police and firefighters who lost their lives - as well as to try to lift the spirits of New Yorkers - Maysles grabbed his camera (and crew) and stuck with McCartney over a 3-4 day period. He captured Sir Paul walking the streets of NYC and signing autographs, rehearsing and even subjecting himself to an appearance on the Howard Stern Show to promote the concert. Then, the night of the big event, he filmed the action from the side of the stage.

Ten years in the making, Maysles' 93-minute film - ""The Love We Make"" - made it's debut on the Showtime cable network in September and is now on this DVD. (There are no special features - a director commentary would really be nice.) It's both a memory of the concert (available for the last 10 years on DVD as ""The Concert for New York"" an a reminder of what a great filmmaker Maysles is. In fact, a few times during the film, Sir Paul points out to his musician or celebrity friends that it is the ""famous Albert Maysles behind the camera"".  Celebrity watchers will see Sir Paul interacting with Dan Rather, James Taylor (great story here), Eric Clapton, Pete Townshend and Bill Clinton, among others.

The film is in Maysles standard ""black and white"" Though it's probably more gray). His footage is nicely edited with archival TV and concert footage - which is in color. This allows you to see what is new and what has been previously available. There are some full performances of songs - but these take place at rehearsal. Excepts of songs from the actual concert are here - encouraging viewers to see out the full concert DVD.

Whether you find Sir Paul more ""accessible"" or ""real"" after watching this film will depend on how you look at ""celebrities"". I found him smart, open and genuinely caring.

It's great to see Maysles back working. I've always admired his work. Maybe this production will introduce younger viewers to seek out his other work.

4841829,4,B005MZSXXY,"This is a really nice and reasonably intimate documentary. No dizzying cuts or the rehashed music more typical of McCartney DVDs. Maysles is as close to fly-on-the-wall as you're gonna get, and it really is fascinating to see some of the uncomfortable circumstances that Paul copes with admirably; ignorant and rude fans, stammering musicians, scores of employees, tedious interviews. You go away with the feeling that he is a sincerely kind and polite man. Conversely, you get to see some of the familiar ""pushy"" McCartney, trying to sell to some of his actual peers(Clapton, Townshend) one of his maybe-not-greatest tunes related to this event. It's also a little bit sobering to see Paul firmly in his old age(and this was ten years ago!) Good work. Maybe greatest musical artist of the twentieth century.",1321920000,17,808,5.082706766917293
4841830,5,B005MZSXXY,"What we get here is a rare peek into what might typically be what Paul McCartney experiences whenever he's on the road. Paul has always been accused of being gaurded and rather coy. Not here. Not one bit. I have been watching this man since 1963 and never have I seen him more candid. We see his years-honed Beatle charm and wit. We also see his humanitarian side and genuine emotion for what transpired on that awful day. Make no mistake about it; Paul McCartney might just be the most powerful man in show business. People come to him. From pop stars to Hollywood types to media moguls to past USA Presidents. They all seek to gain his attention, some for more than a few minutes, others just to shake his hand and be recognized. Paul is charming throughout. A couple of particularly interesting moments were backstage when ""Jimmy"" (as Paul called him) Taylor were reminiscing about their Apple recording experience...and when Jay-Z was onstage performing, Paul was watching on the monitor and working his best ""hood"" moves as Abe Laborial was translating some of the hip-hop speak. Good stuff. We see his love for his daughter Stella, the admiration of his fellow musicians Elton John, Pete Townsend and Eric Clapton. The list of celebrities is long.
We get to experience a birds eye view of what happens when Paul appears on a street or what he goes through while riding in a limo. The adoration is genuine and endless....and his patience abounds.
Another cool aspect of the documentary is it being filmed in black and white, which gives it that ""60's"" feel. Albert Maysles doesn't fail with his lurking cameras and terrific editing.
While not a concert film at all, we see brief moments of the assembled doing their bit, from David Bowie to the Glimmer Twins, Mick and Keith.
Last, but not least, the documentary does a great job of capturing the emotions of the people most affected by the attacks of 9/11; the NYC police and fire departments and families of those who lost relatives and friends.
I own virtually every DVD/film of anything Beatle related. This documentary is unique. There's nothing else like it. While we get this insight into what Paul goes through, the impact of the events of 9/11 is not just a backdrop. It's front and center and driving the events that led up to The Concert for NYC.",1318896000,53,2312,4.697044334975369
4841831,4,B005MZSXXY,I love Paul McCartney so anything he does cannot be bad. Recently saw him in concert and believe me the man still has it.  Was on stage for 3 1/2 hours without a break  and  I DARE SAY MOST 70+ people could not do that.  He is the Master of his time. He did seem a little crowd shy in this DVD but after what happened to John I don't blame him.,1371168000,2,344,3.736111111111111
4841832,5,B005MZSXXY,"Paul is such a caring gentle person, and this comes across in this movie.  And how could he not be thinking that it could have been him, as he was on a plane at the time.",1368489600,2,170,3.7222222222222223
4841833,5,B005MZSXXY,"Paul, you are so cool...so very PAUL!  Thank you for just being yourself, and dealing with all that you are with such grace!!!!  And a note---no footage of Heather---didn't she ""have this idea""....just kidding...oh, by the way, GREAT CONCERT  :)",1367798400,2,245,5.075
4841834,5,B005MZSXXY,I really enjoyed this and all the behind the scenes action they showed. I am happy Paul did this for NYC. I am grateful that his ex-wife wasn't in any of the footage even though she was with him at the time. Kudos for editing!,1367452800,2,226,4.044444444444444

4841837,2,B005MZSXXY,Even as a McCartney fan I found this boring. It shows Paul walking the streets of New York showing Himself as a man of the people. Hard to do when you're a celebrity  . Even the backstage banter got old fast. Didn't shed any light on 9/11 other than to let us know Paul was there. Buy the concert for N.Y.C. and skip this.,1350086400,2,322,4.03125

4841839,5,B005MZSXXY,An interesting behind the scenes look at Sir Paul and his efforts to put together the Concert for New York to celebrate the heroes in the wake and aftermath of 9/11 attacks. Celebrates the heroism of the first responders and their families and the freedoms we enjoy in America.  Shows Paul's and other musicians and performers generous philanthropic spirit in helping to celebrate what's great about America--the land of the free and home of the brave.  I'm glad I got this video for my collection.,1344729600,2,498,4.847058823529411
4841840,5,B005MZSXXY,"This DVD was specifically made WITHOUT any mention of Heather Mills since she has long been forgotten and I am so glad!!! Aside from the wedding ring and the one song he did write for her, but never refers to when singing it in rehearsals, he has paid enough dues to her to let us have the whole DVD relate to America, Paul McCartney and post-9/11. This will make you cry and laugh, as well as relive those horrible conditions we came back from....it should be seen by all Americans. Thanks, Paul!!!",1339977600,2,499,4.434782608695652
4841841,5,B005MZSXXY,"Great look at what it's like to be Paul McCartney anywhere, but especially in New York.  It's just him and the filmmaker on the streets, in and out of the car, his comments to people asking for autographs, getting ready for interviews with Dan Rather and others, and backstage during the Concert for New York right after 9/11/01.  No narration...just Paul talking to the camera, but mostly you're eavesdropping the whole way, especially since the people being seen aren't posing for the camera or trying to put on a show for it.  Thoroughly enjoyed this and if you're a Paul/Beatles fan you will especially like it (though you don't need to be to enjoy it).",1335744000,2,657,4.695652173913044
4841842,3,B005MZSXXY,"There are many stories surrounding the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001 that deserve to be told.  This is not one of them.

I'll admit that I had written that line long before I put the disc in the player.  The blurbs and promotions give the distinct impression that this ""chronicle of Paul McCartney's cathartic journey through New York City in the aftermath of 9/11,"" is a shameful attempt to use an atrocity as an ego trip.  Indeed, the promotional material stops just short of claiming that Paul McCartney came to heal America just as the Beatles had (apocryphally) helped America to get over the Kennedy assassination.

Fortunately, the film itself is nothing like what the descriptions suggest.  Shot in grainy black and white by Albert Maysles (of Gimme Shelter and early films of the Beatles in the U.S.), it's a genuine fly-on-the-wall account of the lead up to the Concert for New York City on 20 October, 2001.  There is no commentary, either direct or implied and there are clearly no situations contrived for the benefit of the film.  The events that prompted the concert are only mentioned during snippets of conversations, although there is an interesting moment when McCartney ponders how an avowed pacifist should react to the attacks.

The film also isn't cut to be too flattering to McCartney either.  Moments after gladhanding people on the street, he's shown in the car saying, ""Right, get me out of here.""  There are of course all the usual shots of fan mobbing and references to the Beatles, but it's a refreshingly candid portrait of McCartney.

Things get interesting at the venue where we see Paul planning arrangements, instructing musicians and somewhat nervously presenting his idea for the new song, Freedom, and confessing to its corniness.  We also see how even some of the most famous people in America can be reduced to gibbering fanboys in the presence of The Beatle.  There are no complete musical performances.  That's fair enough since it's not what the film is about, but if that's what you were hoping for, you'll be disappointed.

Although The Love We Make is far better than expected, there is still much of it that is suspect - such as why Paul would hire a film crew to document his contribution to the concert, and why release it to coincide with the tenth anniversary of the attacks?  While the film is not quite as self-serving as I thought it might be, McCartney is not completely innocent of trying to make it all about him.

That would be forgivable if proceeds from this DVD went to the Robin Hood Relief Fund, as the proceeds from the concert and album did.  However, there is nothing to suggest that this is the case.  As such, The Love We Make is better than it looks, but approach with caution.",1329264000,2,2758,4.754201680672269
4841843,4,B005MZSXXY,"I received this as a Christmas gift and am glad that I was able to watch it end to end 10+ years after the event took place.  For those that might not like McCartney you have to acknowledge that he did his best to provide some sort of healing so shortly after 9/11.  For a Brit to come up with a quick tune, ""Freedom"", and try to give back to a country that has given him so much I really appreciate it.

Hi-lites for me were the snippets of Paul in the street talking to regular people and recognizing his true fans.  Also, the classic clip with the fireman stating, ""Osama Bin Laden, you can kiss my white Irish ass!""  Classic!",1327881600,2,629,4.1652892561983474
4841844,2,B005MZSXXY,"This is a good video documenting some of what Paul McCartney was doing in the lead up to the post 9/11 Concert for New York.  I got the blue-ray version and aside from the deliberate black/white ""frosty"" scenes, the video quality of the TV interview scene are not very good.  I have the Concert for New York DVD and the video of that DVD set is much better, played on the same Blu-ray player and TV.

Aside from the poor video quality, I think the overall show could have been a bit more about what New York was going through a month after 9/11.  It came across a bit too much McCartney centric (and I am a long time Beatles/McCartney fan)",1327708800,5,639,4.256198347107438

4841846,2,B005MZSXXY,"The Blu-ray is really a waste here. Although the stills on back of the box are framed 16:9, the film is 4:3. Also, although it is mostly black and white, it appears that it was shot in color and then changed to black and white electronically, with the color info appearing as noise in the black and white video.
The color concert bits and other video excerpts are very low quality, and appear worse than standard definition. These color parts are so blurry that it must be either a technical blunder or a bad 'artistic' choice to differentiate what was shot for this film and the material borrowed from other sources.

The program itself is interesting for the Beatles fan, but for the videophile, save your bucks and get the regular DVD instead.",1326585600,5,746,4.609022556390977

Also, George Harrison was still alive, though not for long (he passed away on November 29, 2001).

Is this autograph seeking looking to make a quick buck? Is that one intending to harm him? McCartney's desire for an open life is shown to be almost impossible to achieve, but he is committed to trying. Because events in this film happened a decade ago there are a few amusing moments.

To see him cutting up on stage and also his reaction to emotional ties w/his past in The Love We Make was bittersweet. I watch the DVD anytime I want to see genuine kindness, a wish that there could be peace in this world and the knowledge that music has the power to help that along. Paul is real. His music, timeless. His ego could fit in a thimble, not in a stadium as would be needed for someone else who has been in the business as many years as he. He is magnetic on stage and sang 3 hours both summers I saw him, with 2 short breaks. He is whimsical and banters with the crowd, making everyone, including himself, feel like equals; because that is truly what he believes. And that's what comes out in The Love We Make. I have tried to get everyone I know to watch this with me. A few people have and they also love it. I think the full quote from him is ""the love we get is equal to the love we make"". I pray he keeps making that love for many more years!",1394496000,2,1054,4.023809523809524
