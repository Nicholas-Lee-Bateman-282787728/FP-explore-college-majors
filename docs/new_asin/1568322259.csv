My son watches this video all the time, and loves it!  I recommend getting Magic School Bus movies in a boxed set, with 3 or more.  That way you get more for your money, and the kids are oh-so-happy!",1213574400,,361,4.173913043478261

This episode was one of my favorite and sparked my interest in the Solar System. While teachers made us do boring projects and try to ram facts about each plant into our heads, the Magic School Bus presents it in a way that it doesn't feel tedious and before you realize it, you know the order of all nine planets!",1045612800,3,485,4.651162790697675
