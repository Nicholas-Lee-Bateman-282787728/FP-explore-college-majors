8396350,5,B003G5JR1Y,"I love this DVD. It's photographs of petroglyphs in various sites over the world. First, I've always wondered if all petroglyphs were like the ones commonly seen.  These are mind-boggling, make me realize that these people may not have had the accumulated knowledge that our society now claims, but they were humans, they had minds, and creativity and were telling a story!
Of course, it helps that the photogapher is Tom Till, one of my favorites!  He's awesome!  Prepare to sit back and enjoy the photographs and music.
There's no narration, but sub-titles are available to identify locations.",1348358400,,595,5.051020408163265
