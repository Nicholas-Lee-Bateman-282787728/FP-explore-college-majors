8264484,3,B00170ID3S,"This relatively short movie features Rinty's offspring, Rin Tin Tin Jr., rather than the old man. While hardly an embarrassing doggie performance, Junior is not his Dad. With that in mind, this movie, if viewed through a generous lens that includes respect and interest in the Rin Tin Tin heritage, is mediocre at best with dog stunts held to a fairly pedestrian level and with there being no real call for the dogs to ""act."" In any event, don't be misled by that title. There is precious little ""wild"" here (consider, for example, Junior's visit to a nearby woods to lie with a family of cute bunnies who leap and bound about him in happy communion) and not much in the way of ""fang"" either.

Frankly, one could wish for a healthy offering of the handfull of surviving silent movies that featured the original Rin Tin Tin. C'mon Amazon. Netflix? Rhino? Somebody???",1333756800,,865,4.690789473684211
