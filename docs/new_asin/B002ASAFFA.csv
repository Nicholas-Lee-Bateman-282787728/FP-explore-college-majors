8360337,4,B002ASAFFA,"Tank Engines are small steam locomotives that carry their water and fuel aboard the locomotive itself instead of in an attached tender. The film features a variety of locomotives , mostly still in use for tourist excursions. The film includes two versions on one disk: one for children that leaves out some of the technical details, and the other for adults. The adult version describes wheel configurations and how steam is generated. It's a little vague as to how the steam makes the pistons move the connecting rods that turn the wheels.

Most steam train films featured major railroad lines and their locomotives and ignore work engines used in logging, mining, and local freight work. So there are no hard-working monster steam engines belching smoke and steam here, but rather glimpses  of little locos going about their business along with scenes of ""working on the railroad.""

The narration is low-key and folksy. Train buffs and little kids of all ages will enjoy this short  film immensely.",1262476800,,1000,5.006024096385542
