8649329,5,B00JAD6GZ6,Haven't watched any of it yet but was very impressed by the lineup of movies involved.,1458691200,,86,4.4375
8649330,5,B00JAD6GZ6,"Gave this set of DVDs as a gift last Christmas - got big thanks from my movie buff friend - many he'd never seen before.  He mentioned the quality of one or two of the titles (don't know which ones) was not up to par, but certainly viewable - the others that he's watched were just fine.  So, with those qualifiers, I'd say this was a good purchase.",1430697600,,349,4.117647058823529

8649333,5,B00JAD6GZ6,bought this for my sister who loves the old timers.  she can't thank me enough.  she says it is just so wonderful to see some of the many movies that made some wonderful and talented stars.,1418774400,2,189,4.222222222222222
8649334,2,B00JAD6GZ6,"As you would predict, the quality is poor on these movies.  Missing frames ( resulting in movies jumping ahead a bit,) poor audio, poor video (especially dark parts of the films,) you name it.  This is expected at this price.  The product makes no claims about restoration quality.

Some of the movies have A movie stars.  You can probably get a better quality version of some of these ( for example, a Barbara Stanwycke movie directed by Capra...you would expect that movie is or will be restored.)

I have seen only some of the movies and some were pretty good.  I enjoyed the formulaic Port of New York for example.  There's a very interesting film noir called The Chase.

Expect to find some good movies here with good IMDB ratings.  The collection is not filled with garbage IMO, the cheap price is due to the quality (lack of restoration) and possible legal status ( public domain on some of these movies?)

If I have one main complaint, it's the audio.  As there's no closed captioning, you may have to crank the volume in some scenes in some movies to hear what they say.  WARNING - the DVD menu audio is loud (STUPID) so you might turn up the volume on a movie, and when it goes back to the DVD menu you will be assaulted with loud and annoying music.  My setup for watching movies includes a powerful amplifier, so it's a bit of a shock if I forget about this ( it's shocked me a few times.)  If you have your audio hooked into an audio/video receiver or amps (as opposed to the TV speakers) or are watching late at night, you will want to be careful about this.

Seems for the price, and if you are a film buff that can overlook the quality issues for the experience of seeing some movies they probably will never show on TCM this is a good buy.",1400544000,9,1756,4.340490797546012
