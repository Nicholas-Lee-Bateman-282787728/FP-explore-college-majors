2896669,5,B000TEUSJ0,"New Jersey born and raised stand-up comic Mike Marino comes across as a wiseguy / goombah comic, the kind who would be comfortable in a Tony Soprano world. This shtick works because Marino is able to use the stereotype to set up his jokes and also rise above it at the same time. His first stand-up comedy DVD, New Jersey's Bad Boy of Comedy, was, in my opinion, a long time coming but is well worth the wait. If you have his CD you'll recognize many routines but this time you get to see them and a lot of the fun in Mike Marino New Jersey's Bad Boy of Comedy DVD is watching Marino perform as this stand-up comic really uses his body language to add to his material.",1194307200,,668,4.186046511627907

8208735,5,B000TEUSJ0,Mike is a great comedian and preformer. The laughter continues after the show is over. If you have not already seen him I suggest you do so!,1388188800,,140,4.222222222222222
8208736,3,B000TEUSJ0,"Not sure what happened. For about 20 mins the laughs were there and then it just went down hill.

This was my first chance to see this comedian so when the show started off with a bang, I was happy I had selected this for viewing.

Now? I am uncertain if I would watch him again.

Usually comedians need to warm up in their act, get into momentum and then the laughs start rolling.  Here I witnessed the opposite.

I would have to see very high reviews on another one of his stand up acts to consider giving him a second chance. Disappointed.",1374019200,,542,4.223300970873787
8208737,5,B000TEUSJ0,"We went to the Borgota this summer in Atlantic City and saw Mike live. It was non stop laughs from his first word. He is an amazing comedian. We laughed so hard we had tears streaming down our faces ,I swear I couldn't breathe! It was a packed house and everyone was going crazy,laughing. It has been a very bad year and a half I lost my mother inlaw ,my mom,my grandfather,2 dogs, and had my last dog on her last legs. It was the first time in a long time I laughed,it was the best show I have ever seen. At the end of the show I bought his CD and DVD ,I thanked him for the laughs and he told me to be on the lookout for Marino's his new TV show that's coming out soon. I also am Italian and come from Jersey but even an Eskimo living in an Igloo would love this guy,he is a comedic genius. If you or somebody you know could use a laugh please buy his DVD.",1284854400,2,858,3.8806818181818183
