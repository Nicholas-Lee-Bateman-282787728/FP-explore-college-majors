1658671,5,B00005T304,"...Treat Williams sported a brown leather jacket, red shirt, blue jeans i.e. Jack Slater's wardrobe and his name was Jack, right? The first ten minutes of the movie will leave you disgusted and you'll probably shut it off immediately. But, the main reason to watch ""Gale Force"" is because of Michael Dudikoff. The American Ninja plays a bad guy for once and he takes care of business. Basically this movie makes fun of reality television shows especially ""Survivor."" ""Treasure Hunt"" has brought in a group of people to search for a pot full of ten million dollars. But, a group of pirates (ex-Navy Seals) are scavenging around the island taking down the contestants. That's enough plot. Too much thinking. Jerad (Dudikoff) asks the host, ""You think we're ready for primetime?"" and then surprises him with a blast! I was amazed to have seen clips of the helicopters flying around from ""Predator"" in this movie... This movie is horrible, but it can make anybody laugh. A lightning bolt struck two people at the same time, yes! Old Man Withers still has some fight in him. Way too windy for me, the winds looked pretty windy. Oh well, like I said comedy!",1043971200,,1151,4.76
1658672,1,B00005T304,"Treat Williams has made some bad films, and ""Gale Force"" is another stinker to add to his filmography.  This direct-to-video garbage stars Williams as a LAPD detective who is asked to sign up for a new TV reality show, ""Treasure Hunt"", after he is suspended from the police force.  The film's director (supposedly it's Jay Andrews, not Jim Wynorski) decided to steal some footage and action sequences from other films, such as ""Last Action Hero"" and ""Die Hard"".  I wonder how the makers of ""Last Action Hero"" feel about having its car chase sequence being digitally inserted into this film!  Anyway, avoid this one at all costs, and pray that Treat Williams' new TV series will be better than this [one].",1026864000,,704,4.793388429752066
1658673,2,B00005T304,"What could have been a REALLY great B Flick with a very different plot ended up just another average B Flick. The plot:""Treasure Hunt"" is tv's hottest new reality based show-$10 million dollars is buried on a remote island and it's between 8 contestants to find it and bring it home.(I can hear the idea being pitched now to a major tv studio to actually go through with this) Rogue theives have infiltrated the island and are also looking for the hidden cash but wait another disaster has beset these islanders: a violent tropical storm is heading towards them. Sounds good right?The Bad: Well the opening car chase scene is STOLEN from ""Last Action Hero"" it is the original scene but edited with Treat Williams in place of Arnold! (Look for the Slater 1 license plate on the car!) Even when the ""house"" where a hostage is held up blows up (STOLEN from Last Action Hero) it reeks of being from another movie. Didn't the director trust his production company or are B flicks that tight on a budget due to the economy? I thought I could overlook this flaw but alas another scene has a group of ex-Navy Seals flying in by helicopter to the island. This was lifted right from Predator! The somewhat Good:Overall I found it to be entertaining just to find the ""borrowed"" scenes from better action movies. I was disappointed in Michael Dudikoff playing a bad guy. (First Olivier Gruner in Extreme Honor and now Dudikoff for shame!) Its bad when B actors are playing bad guys instead of the usual ""good guy"" we see them play in countless other movies. What could have been will probably be when a Big Budget Movie Co. remakes this plot and releases it to a national audience.  Bottom Line:Check it out just for a good laugh then check out the better produced movies they borrowed from.",1011657600,6,1779,4.59433962264151

1658683,5,B00005T304,gale force has famous actors like american ninja michael dudikoff and other actors as well. Its kind of low budget when it comes to special effects but for the most part the movie is pretty cool.,1307577600,,195,4.444444444444445
1658684,5,B00005T304,"This is a horrible movie, really it is.  Low budget, poor special effects, directing and script leave so much to be desired, but! somehow this movie keeps you sucked in!  You keep watching thinking it's going to get better but it never does, but yet, you know it's not going to get better and you still keep watching.  It's a paradox and every time I see this movie I keep waiting for the universe to collapse in on it's self.

I think the reasons you continue to watch is due to the acting ability of some of the players in the movie.  Not all of the actors pull off a good role, but some of them do, such as Treat Williams.  This man is a very underrated actor and always seems to end up in low budget movies, but yet, he makes those low budget movies his own with his presence and ability.  That and the movie does have story in there somewhere that wants to bring you along, but it's kept at bey due to the low budget.

This movie is now a cult classic in my collection and my family and I are turning it into a Friday Night popcorn throwing and interacting movie.  It's fun to comment at the movie as you watch it.  Like when they are running through hurricane force winds and rain and end up in a shack, Treat's hair is as dry as can be and not a hair out of place..  Even a tidal wave is no match for the strength of Treat's perfect and dry hair!

Had this movie been backed with more money, I imagine it could have been more than a cult classic B style movie.  It has a good story in there, it almost had the cast it needed and hell, the director might have actually shined through on this one with some money behind it.  Treat Williams does a fine job, Michael Dudikoff did as he should and of course how could you not jump on a movie with Curtis Armstrong.  It was nice to see William Zabka again, but I wish his role had more meat to it.  He always seems to take second seat, but it is nice to see he's still working in the industry.

Do not buy this movie if you're looking for a world renowned critically acclaimed movie, buy this movie because it's the best worse cult classic style poke fun at and still enjoy it movie.

I give this one 5 stars because it's a hidden gem that will never shine.",1296864000,4,2208,4.095348837209302
1658685,5,B00005T304,"In order to enjoy this flick, one must be able to realize this is a low budget/straight-to-video/B movie and lower their expectations a bit.  ""Gale Force"" does something that can be considered quite despicable it recycles footage from other high budget films.  For instance you will see stock footage from movies like ""Predator"" & ""Last Action Hero"" (personally I feel ""Gale Force"" is a much better movie than the latter).  If a viewer can past this movie studio ruse, they might really enjoy this movie.  I must admit, it is kind of funny to see this ""chop editing"" in action.

As for the actors or as I call them talent, there are quite a few of them in ""Gale Force"":

1)Treat Williams - The B Movie Prince is awesome as the Burn out Cop.
2)Michael Dudikoff - The American Ninja plays the bad guy wonderfully.
3)Tim Thomerson - Doll Man/Jack Deth delivers a stellar performance.
4)William Zabka - Johnny ""Cobra Kai"" Lawrence is a marvel as a villain.
5)Curtis Armstrong - Booger, we love you no matter what!

The plot is simple, there is a reality TV show called ""Treasure Hunt"".  The premise of this show is putting a group of diverse people on an island to win 10 million dollars. Treat Williams sort of becomes the unofficial leader of the group.  However, the contestants are getting more than they bargained for, a hurricane is coming towards the island and there is a group of mercenaries who want the money for themselves.  As for the mercenaries, they are led by Michael Dudikoff and his right hand man is William ""Johnny Cobra Kai Lawrence"" Zabka, who will due anything for this 10 million dollars.

The DVD presents the film in letterbox has the preview/trailer, language options and talent biographies.  Average features for a low budget/straight-to-video/B movie.

Again, I really enjoyed this movie, dumb fun.  I felt the acting was quite good despite some of the budget issues; it appears everyone had a good time making this movie.  I must reiterate ""Gale Force"" isn't ""The Godfather"", ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", ""Gone with the Wind"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"" (all great movies), but it can be a real blast if you suspend your disbelief  for 100 minutes.  Oh and adding a pizza to the equation wouldn't hurt either.",1223942400,,2230,4.765625
1658686,3,B00005T304,"GALE FORCE is another straight to video that suffers from its lack of creative intelligence.  Obviously scenes were stolen from previous movies (see other reviews), and the opening scene does little than to establish Treat Williams as a loose cannon.  I will say for Treat that even though he can do much better than films like this, he manages to exude a quiet strength that helps elevate his films.  Michael Dudikoff as a villain is novel; Susan Walters needs acting lessons; you never know when Cliff deYoung and Tim Thomerson are going to turn up.  The effects are sub par, the pacing erratic, but overall it's an entertaining 90 minutes or so.",1076025600,,648,4.758928571428571

Sure it was comical watching them run through a storm with dry hair & sunshine visible in the background, but overall, for a low budget flick, this one was thoroughly enjoyable.",1496188800,,432,4.597402597402597
