8508026,2,B003AO3CNK,"Well, After reading a stellar review at a popular audio magazine's website I thought this would be amazing, but, honestly despite the excellent quality of the video and audio on the blue ray disc...and the talent of the singer (she's a great singer-seriously). This disc comes off as a caricature of a Japanese singer trying to do the great American Songbook, complete with mispronounced words (not a letter 'L' in her repitoire). I'm sure she can knock just about anything 'outta the park' in her native language...but not in English.",1296259200,,535,4.955555555555556
8508027,3,B003AO3CNK,"""Hiromi In Love""  is a collection of 11 elaborate music videos of songs from the Great American Songbook performed by Hiromi Kanda.  Born in Nagasaki, Japan, Ms. Kanda was exposed to American music via the armed forces personnel stationed in the city.  At 19, she appeared on an ""American Idol""-type Japanese TV talent show, beating out an initial two million applicants, and signed a recording contract.

The videos on this Blu-ray Disc are beautifully photographed, combining performance footage with story segments and smooth visual segues from one video to the next.  Ms. Kanda is elegantly costumed in gowns, often sporting a series of gardenias in her hair, perhaps a tribute to Billie Holiday.

Ms. Kanda is not exactly the best interpreter of songs. She's a bit too affected, and seems more concerned with her appearance and interesting background settings than in giving the songs a memorable delivery. Style takes precedence over vocal interpretation in her songs. I prefer a singer who connects with the material. Ms. Kanda often seems to be mouthing the lyrics without fully comprehending their meaning.

The selections include songs associated with pop vocalists (""Unforgettable"" - Nat King Cole, ""In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning"" - Frank Sinatra, ""Cry"" - Johnnie Ray), big band classics (""I'll Never Smile Again""), and a Gershwin hit (""Someone to Watch Over Me"").  Ms. Kanda is accompanied by the Honolulu Symphony Orchestra. There are two bonus music-only tracks.",1278201600,4,1484,5.205882352941177
