8188702,1,B000P2A5IA,"I guess the info was ok but the instructor was ANNOYING. She had a constant annoying nervous laugh and
she played with her water bottle constantly....ocassionally taking loud gulps of water. All very distracting. I won't
be able to sit through another lesson with her.",1397433600,,268,4.977777777777778
8188703,1,B000P2A5IA,"I am glad this was only a rental, though I still have buyers remorse for that. Half way through this ""Training Session"" I thought I was watching a remote viewing class by way of women's studies class.  Very little ""training"" or really usefull information is to be had watching this.  You would do better to purchase anything by Ed Dames, Paul Smith, Stephen A Schwartz. Even the fiction by C.S. Graham would be a better buy.

Sure the succeeding sessions may have more meat to them but the poor presentation of the initial video has stopped me from giving it a shot.

If you feel need to check this item out, I would suggest skipping the first session, and going to the next.  Review that and let us know if it has any good qualities.",1331337600,3,734,4.407407407407407
8188704,5,B000P2A5IA,"Remote Viewing Training Sessions - Part 1 - 7 - Introduction to RV by Prudence Calabrese.  Technically low quality DVDs from an entertainment point of view (White board talk). It is like a home movie of people in a get together in a Days Inn in California. I was amused by Pru. I found her delightfully charming. The ""home movie"" recorded class conducted while there was a power failure in the hotel. The power came back on while Pru was teaching. It went off again as DVD 6 ended. Pru presented several techniques not taught in other RV home study courses. She teaches a different resolution to analytical overlay.",1192665600,6,615,4.6422018348623855
