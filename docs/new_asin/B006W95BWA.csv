5022432,1,B006W95BWA,"Received my Cheyenne Season three on Friday 6 April 2012.
Couldn't wait to watch this series over the weekend.
On every one of the five discs there was skipping, the speech and movements were out of sync or massive amount of green artifacts speckled across the screen.
I contacted Amazon first thing Monday morning and have returned my season three for a replacement.
I hope the replacement will function and play as expected.
I will reevaluate the rating after I receive my replacement of Cheyenne Season three.",1333929600,18,512,4.896551724137931

Have had a quick look through the 5 discs and all appears well. The quality looks excellent and so does the story plots. All five discs have good quality pictures on them.
I feared they might be double-sided, thankfully not. ""CHEYENNE"" is an excellent series.  Hopefully I will be able to buy more of the series .

5022468,5,B006W95BWA,"The BIG GUY's Back & even more clearer than ever!!!!  For Christmas I received a Sony 65"" Flat screen TV, so Clint is even BIGGER THAN EVER. I've always liked Cheyenne 'cause he has scruples and he stuck by them, which is ""VERY RARE"" IN Hollywood in his day and even more so today. I've tried to live by what I was taught by my Widowed Mother, even though I occasionally slipped from that track, I would manage to put myself back on an ""even keel"" and get back to what's right & wrong, since I didn't have a dad when I was growing up in the mid-50's & 60's I'd ALWAYS try to remember what Cheyenne would do in a situation like that, then try and do them YES BOYS & GIRLS, MEN & WOMEN, The Show HAS SCRUPLES, & Clint will teach you what's right & wrong. In the ""Real World"" Clint Walker is a Devout Christian Man who attends Sunday School & Church, BUT, HE'S ONLY HUMAN and being human he & the rest of the world will ""Occasionally"" slip up, and when he does ""HE ADMIT'S IT"" & TRIES TO RIGHT THE WRONG THAT HE'S CAUSED, shouldn't we all do the same?",1420070400,4,1048,4.087378640776699

5022482,5,B006W95BWA,"Cheyenne was one of the best old westerns. Always a man of integrity and always helping people out of trouble. That is what I love about this series. With the TV junk the new shows serve up,this old black and white is a welcome relief. The episodes are always interesting and well acted. We enjoy recognizing the actors that eventually made it big. Clint Walker was tall, had that deep ,velvety voice,broad shoulders and was a real man of honour! Great show! I highly recommend it!",1397865600,,481,4.604651162790698
5022483,5,B006W95BWA,"If you want a good role model for the young men in your life,  these Cheyenne TV episodes are perfect for them to watch.  They just don't make clean, moral and interesting shows like this anymore.  Good for ages 7 and up.",1391817600,,221,4.214285714285714
5022484,5,B006W95BWA,"As a kid growing up in the 1950,s i was cowboy crazy and Cheyenne was one of the first and the best. Now,if Warner could finallyrelease 77 Sunset Strip,Hawaiian Eye and Colt 45 on dvd I would be forever in their debt. But Cheyenne is still one the best.",1388793600,,253,4.183673469387755

5022488,5,B006W95BWA,Cheyenne was a great TV series produced by Warner Brothers.  Clint Walker was great as Cheyenne.  He was a giant of a man but had great acting skills.  as the previous seasons this is a must have for the avid collector.,1383868800,,219,4.2926829268292686

5022490,5,B006W95BWA,really enjoyed watching the series again...as great in the 21st century as it was in the 1950's....clint walker the original hollywood hero..,1379635200,,141,5.454545454545454
5022491,3,B006W95BWA,"As some others have noted, there must be zero manufacturing quality control on these Warner Archive made-on-demand (MOD) DVD-Rs.  I've ordered five seasons of this show, and several DVDs in each of seasons 2 through 5 were seriously scuffed - a far, far worse track record than any other sets of DVDs that I've ever purchased.  The only seasons *without* scratched DVDs was the first season, but those are proper pressed DVDs that evidently come from a different sort of manufacturing/packaging line than these crappy MOD DVD-Rs that Warner loves so much.  And, since I'm complaining, remember that MOD DVD-Rs will NOT play in anything but a standard DVD player hooked up to a TV.  In every way MOD DVDs are a very bad format which I avoid at all costs... after all, one can make their own MOD DVDs easily from TV broadcasts, and *those* discs will play in ALL of ones' various players.  The Cheyenne TV program itself is a classic, which is the only reason I put up with Warner's crap manufacturing and too-high prices.",1378425600,6,1020,4.707865168539326

5022495,5,B006W95BWA,Season 2 and 3 are my favorite of the Cheyenne series.  Quality stories and a quality DVD set that we are glad to have in our Western collection.  It is a pleasure to be able to share these with the grandkids,1367107200,,208,4.048780487804878

5022504,5,B006W95BWA,"I found disc 3 of this season of interest as it brings back also memories of that other Warner Bros production ""Lawman"", with episodes ""The Empty Gun"" starring John Russell and ""Renegades"" with
Peter Brown. It was most pleasing to see John Russell having this episode almost to himself,
""The Empty Gun"" begins and ends with a graveside scene, although not spoken of it can be assumed this gunfighter has sustained a stroke with Russell having to tie a gun to a lifeless hand,
 this episode is exceptionable.
Peter Brown by contrast has little to do in his coming of age episode.",1353542400,3,578,4.666666666666667
5022505,4,B006W95BWA,"I welcomed this DVD of the third season.  Each  season gave Clint Walker better stories to work on, and he improved as an actor because of them.  This group included the episode called ""The Conspirators"" which showed off his singing voice.  It was an amusing and good diversion from the usual ""Western"" format.  The whole Cheyenne series was one of the best TV westerns.  I hope Warner Brothers releases the rest of the seasons while Clint Walker and those of us who were the original viewers are still around to enjoy them.",1349740800,5,524,4.641304347826087

I was really hoping this season would include the episode where he sings, and IT DOES.  That's a family favorite, and I've been wandering around humming those songs for days.  Clint Walker is definitely one of the handsomest actors ever, and we love the story lines.  Definitely good, clean family fun and something to share with the younger generation.

8505467,5,B006W95BWA,"Clint Walker is wonderful as ""Cheyenne"". A Lone Ranger type of character who restores law and order to the wild west, and helps solve the most unsolvable of crimes. Every episode is delightful, and after watching season one, it quickly became one of my favorite western classics. Having already watched and enjoyed the third season, I'm ready for number four. If you enjoy great western shows, I highly recommend watching ""Cheyenne"", and I guarantee it shall quickly become one of your favorites.",1491004800,2,496,5.060975609756097
