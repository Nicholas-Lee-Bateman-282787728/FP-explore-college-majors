4660689,5,B005DJDF2I,"""Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara"" (ZNMD) is a complex, honest, and thoroughly refreshing story about friendship, about love, about choices, about ... well ... the journey of Life (lit. 'zindagi').  Writer-Director Zoya Akhtar takes three characters we might think we've seen before ... but deftly makes them original, fresh, and unexpectedly engaging.  Her intelligent script perfectly balances the very real, even painful, personal transformation of each character with moments of joy, wit, charm, and humour.

No one's Life Journey is ever quite what one plans!

Our protagonists?  Three best friends since childhood:  Arjun (Hrithik Roshan), now an investment broker in London; Imraan (Farhan Akhtar), an advertising copywriter in Delhi; and Kabir (Abhay Deol), a construction architect in Mumbai.  Ten years after college Kabir's imminent wedding impels 'The Three Musketeers -- all for one, and one for all!' -- to finally embark on the many-times-deferred adventure challenge they'd always planned.

ZNMD explores whether three grown men can survive a 3-week road trip together *and* still remain friends *and* still be the same people.

Think you've heard similar, before?  Guess again!  Ms Akhtar elevates the basic 'road movie' premise into something rare and sublime:  brilliant character-driven comedy never cheap but often laugh-out-loud funny, and so true to life and people each of us actually know that it genuinely moves the heart as well as the mind and funny-bone.  As each ZNMD character in turn challenges his own fear, whatever personal demon that has been holding back his life, it becomes our victory, too.

See ZNMD and discover:  *your* life may change, too!

Such strong story and plot would be lost, without great acting.

Farhan Akhtar (the writer-director's twin brother) just gets better and better, as an actor, every time out of the gate.  Already one of India's best young directors, his deceptively brash but sensitive and layered acting in ZNMD is quiet excellence ... and deliciously funny.

Abhay Deol I confess I had not seen before.  Not exciting, but I like his potential.  A good foil for the other two.

However the real revelation in ZNMD is, most surprisingly, he whom we might have *thought* most familiar.  Hrithik Roshan we see so often in heavy dramatic and/or demanding multi-part roles -- because, let's face it, he's that rare actor who CAN do them, and do them brilliantly well -- that it's easy to forget just how plain damn funny and versatile he can be.  Casting one of the world's more notorious compulsive workaholics as, well, a compulsive workaholic?  Absolute genius!

On the distaff side ... Katrina Kaif.  Wow!  Where did this performance come from?  She's always been beautiful, of course, but in ZNMD for the first time she shows subtlety and depth as an actress.  Easily, her very best work to date.

Cannot finish without special mention of the fantastic music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy (long my favourite Hindi film composers).  Their ZNMD soundtrack perfectly backdrops the film's emotional journey.  Irresistibly hummable music spans the full range of moods and emotions, much like our three main characters:  everything from amusingly lighthearted ('Senorita', sung by Mssrs Roshan, Akhtar, & Deol) to cool and modern ('Ik Junoon -- Paint It Red') to reflective ('Der Lagi Lakin') and even unabashedly romantic ('Khaabon Ke Parinday').

But the rocking 'Dil Dhadakne Do' seems to capture the very Joy of Living ... and that is the ultimate spirit of Zoya Akhtar's ZMND.

Perfect summer movie!  10/10

Best film I've seen yet from anywhere in the world, thus far in 2011.",1311724800,38,3629,5.182444061962134
4660690,5,B005DJDF2I,"If you liked Dil Chahta Hai, you will like Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. I'm not going to tell you the summary of it because you can read it yourselves. I'm going to tell you the thinks I liked about this movie:

1. The actors. Each of the three main actors did a great job. Hrithik was the work-a-holic, which is something he has never played before so it was nice to see him play something different. He did a great job. Farhaan- the jokester of the group. His one line jokes had us laughing throughout the whole movie. This is also a new role for him because in his other movies he has played someone serious. He also has a serious role in this movies but you don't see it until the end. Abhay- I don't usually like him in movies but I think he did a very good job playing the guy getting married. He also had his own one line jokes, but not as much as Farhaan.

2. The story- There is something about three guys coming together on a trip and finding themselves and dealing with issues. Each of the guys have to deal with something in their lives and you learn that their issues aren't known to each other until the end of the movie. This movie is a lot like Dil Chahta Hai because both movies are about three friends going on a trip to find themselves.

3. The setting- most of the movie takes place in Spain, where they decide to go on their trip. The scenery was beautiful and a great place to film, since there are no Bollywood movies made in Spain (that I know of). Also the setting is important for the trip because each guy picks a sport to do that the other two do not know about it so the sports takes place in Spain.

4. The Music- the music was amazing. I bought the soundtrack before I saw the movie and I loved it. Hearing the songs made me want to see the movie even more. My favorite song (which is hard to pick, since the album is great) is Senorita. In the movie, all three actors do their own singing for the song. The music video for the song in the movie is great as well.

I recommend this movie for anyone. Even some of my friends who have never seen bollywood films loved this movie.",1311724800,25,2105,4.136919315403423
4660691,5,B005DJDF2I,"One of the best ""feel good movies""  about discovering one's self and correcting the path you may be on if it is in the wrong direction. This movie is long- but every scene really contributes to the overall experience and theme of the movie. Each actor shined in their roles and each character contributed an integral side story in the combined journey these 3 men are on. Is this a rom-com? Not really. The love story has a pleasant background note, but the real message is how these 3 men are fulfilling a pact they made in their college days to have a road trip before the first one gets married but end up correcting the wrong direction their lives have taken. What they think will be a 3 week bachelor holiday becomes a personal quest for each fellow as they uncover significant flaws in their current lives that are holding them back from fulfilling their full potential and true passions in life. The biggest lessons they learned were to live in the moment and appreciate the bond of their friendship and the support they have for each other. The story moves quickly - you will not be bored, and you will laugh!! You will also identify yourself in some elements with each character. Grab a Mountain Dew and bag of red grapes and sit back and enjoy! Ciao!",1521849600,,1260,4.502183406113537

All the three male leads play their part to perfection. Hrithik Roshan, back with his Greek God looks, is charming not just in his looks but in his natural act as well. Farhan Akhtar shows a refreshing flair for comedy and has impeccable comic timing. Also he's wonderful in the poignant scene where he confronts his father. Abhay Deol is commendable as the one who initiates the trip, mediates between his friends and is confused about his own love-life.

I didn't like Hrithik's part as much as some others he's done.  Although he played a very sensitive character which is nice; better ultimately than his business side.  Although  I am used to the business side of men in my own experience because I have a finance background.  I admire Hrithrik's ability for diversity in his roles.
I guess I like his macho roles better!  Although he still manages to show a sensitive side in those roles.  Over all was a fun experience!",1507852800,,591,4.457943925233645

4660728,4,B005DJDF2I,"ike Dil Chata Hai directed by her twin brother Farhan this is part of a new generation of Bollywood, less reliant on old clichs and more honestly exploring the lives of young people. Song and dance are used a little less often, and are more integrated into the plot, so there isn't the feeling that these numbers are obligatory.

There are things about the film that trouble me. This story of three best (male) friends going on a 3 week bachelor party adventure trip to Spain is terribly materialistic. As much as the film espouses live free and happy and for the moment, thats a lot easier when you're either wealthy or well to do as all these characters seem to be. Even the character who eventually has to face that hes too obsessed with success doesnt seem about to abandon that 'living the good life' = money for things and travel formula.

But that carp aside, I found this generally charming and fun. While on the surface not all that different from U.S. movies about young guys having a wild time together, there is an honesty to the performances and emotion and a freshness to the approach that makes it better than the same tired U.S variations I cant even watch anymore.

What I did like about this movie was that the actors were handsome and very relaxed, relatable, and human, their acting wasn't over the top, their delivery was pretty chill and effective. The scenery of Spain is GORGEOUS, especially that sky diving scene, that was beautiful. My main gripe with Zindagi is really the plot. It's a little too simple and wears thin after the first hour with not much dramatic tension to keep things exciting. Sure there's the issue with the fiance getting jealous of the swimming instructor but it seemed a tad unnecessary and over the top for her to go all the way to Spain just to see ""what's going on"" for only one day only to return back home. There just wasn't enough drama for me, not that I wanted it to be a soap opera but most of the movie is basically where the characters are having a good time on vacation. It's nice and enjoyable, but doesn't make for an exciting 2 and a half hour movie. Overall though, this movie was GOOD, not great. It was def. worth watching and sitting through from start to finish. I just wouldn't rave about it as much as some reviewers have done already.",1366243200,5,1208,4.397321428571429

4660761,5,B005DJDF2I,"I went into watching this Bollywood film with the fear that it was going to be a comedy like the original american film ""The Hangover"", (I usually don't like comedies where I'd have to read subtitles because the humor doesn't always work) but, it was actually a very pleasant ""feel good"" film about three guys going on a road trip through Spain before one of the guys get married.

I liked the bonding that three three guys had, and the interesting little sub-stories of each guy making discoveries about themselves when the finally get away from their actual home environment.

I love the camera work of this film. Spain is a beautiful country, and it's glorified well in this film. Plus, the underwater scenes and the skydiving part, and the tomato fight festival, and the bull running traditions were all really great scenes to watch and enjoy. I'm happy I got this film. I truly did enjoy it.  In fact, it's like a cross between ""The Hangover"", and ""City Slickers"".

The three male leads, Hrithik, Farhan, and Abhay were all impressive with their individual dialogues as well as their singing and dancing.  There wasn't a single scene where I felt bored or wanted to skip to the next frame, that's how good it is.  The title of the film Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, Life Doesn't Happen Twice, is so appropriate because this is what the three characters, a trio of childhood friends, learn through the course of the movie.

I got this movie last year around Christmas and my family saw the movie twice immediately and in terms of quality of the blu-ray, now I'm not an expert or a tech geek, but awesome.

4660770,5,B005DJDF2I,"OMG! If there was ever a movie that made the idea of a road- trip entiticing it's this one! I'm beyond joy with this one and getting my thoughts in order is incredibly hard because there is just so much emotion to work through. This is the most emotional ""guy"" movie I've ever seen without taking away any masculinity from the characters. Of course, as you can tell by my alias I'm a girl so masculinity isn't my area of expertice. HOWEVER I think I can safely say that my brother would like this movie if I could convince him subtitles aren't awful. He's a bit of a hillbilly so if he would think these guys are manly then they are.

Where to start... okay when in doubt start with the obvious and work from there. Spain is AMAZING! It's always been on my bucket list and now wish I really could go. Indian film makers know how to capture fantastic scenery and Spain is captured in all it's natural sensual splendor. I love how even though it's beyond mortal comprehension of beauty it isn't pristine. It's hot, sometimes dusty, and you see that. The reality adds to the sensuality and you feel like you're there too. This isn't a fairy tale this movie is about finding where you belong in your life and friendship. Both subjects get a little messy so is the scenery at times and it works!

Music: after Jodhaa Akbar this is my favorite Bollywood soundtrack ever!  It's so fresh and different but still retains the Hindi film cultural spirit. There isn't one dragging or loose song here. There all joyous uplifting and energizing they perfectly capture the theme that life is meant to be devoured and love in all forms savored. I could listen to it twenty-four-seven. I know that's a recognized form of torture but the songs are that wonderful. I love them all but the two most amazing are...

""Khwabon Ke Parindey"" is a pure soulful love ballad that's as light as air. I'd play it at my wedding if I was getting married. The only thing I don't understand is why they dubbed Mr. Roshan's three lines when he was going to sing in his own voice anyway!

Which is a perfect segway into ""Senorita."" Anyone who's a fan of Farhan Akhtar knows he's an accomplished singer and plays in his own band. Also ""Rock On"" was his baby so it's not surprising he would sing for himself. Mr. Roshan might be a bit of a shock to people who haven't seen ""Kites"" or ""Guzaarish"". Abhay Deol I've never really seen before and according to the special features he didn't enjoy singing but he did a fine job. Senorita is a perfect example of how no matter how culturally diverse humanity is there's always a universal constant where we mix perfectly. I'm not shocked that it's the ""superhit "" of the album.

Performances: As I mentioned I've never seen Abhay Deol before so I have to say I'm more impressed than I thought I'd be. I mean just putting Farhan Akhtar an Hrithik Roshan is more than enough for a great film. But Mr. Deol has to hold the trio together in the first half and he does it brilliantly. All of the characters are deliciously human and messy and multi-layered. Kabir has amazing strength and crushing weaknesses and Mr. Deol wisely never overplayed either.

Farhan Akhtar has hooked me as a very devoted fan. The first time he came to my attention was with ""Luck By Chance"" due to my determination to see every Hrithik Roshan movie ever made. And Mr. Akhtar made me so mad in that movie because I adored his character and he turned into the biggest Jackass! Well it doesn't take a genius to know he's good at his job because I was angry enough to almost skip ""Rock On"". Fortunately he didn't stay a jackass in that film and hooked me forever. Here he's a total doll and a bit of a harmless lecher. But underneath that charming funny exterior is a confused aching young man with wisdom beyond his years. His ability to observe life altering moments and put them into poetry adds so much depth that by the end of the film you're left feeling that he'll somehow change the world with his gifts. I hope that Mr. Akhtar has more oppertunities to play comedies they fit him like a good cashmere sweater.

Just once I *wish* I could say Hrithik Roshan wasn't perfect. I do because I sound like a simpering teenager with a massive crush. Well I'm not a teenager and if I do have a crush it's with a publicity image because (God willing) I'll never meet the man! Alas that blasted man was indeed perfect! How perfect? He actually got to direct himself while lip-synching. Yeah I know, it's just too much! Arjun is a seriously screwed up cat but he's got good reasons. The poor man is trapped in a nightmere of materialism and pain and the worst part is he's oblivious to his situation. Still like a butterfly cracking it's cacoon he comes out of metamorphosis with a new lease on life. The best part is that the transition is handled gradually and very naturally. There's no one huge moment where the lightning strikes. It starts with a single step until one journey is over and a new one begins. Mr. Roshan does do some unusual things here. One, he doesn't cover his tatoos. No complaints there although tatoos aren't usually my cup of tea. Two, he gives the middle finger for a split second. In fairness Imram was being too mean, but my two yr old nephew won't be seeing this movie. The last thing I need is him learning that. Three Arjun and Laila sleep together. Sorry for the spoiler but parents should know these things. The scene isn't graphic in fact they're seen actually sleeping but it's clear more happened.

I forgot to mention Imram also had an encounter but that's not shown either. Just a post chat with lady fully dressed in Hindi and Spanish. All in all it's very PG for the USA and it all turns out honorable I just won't say how.

Ladies: First up, Laila! Katrina Kaif is a favorite of mine and I get the sense that when it comes to Bollywood fans you either love her or hate her. I love her. She's not the type of girl who is nervous about being silly or uninhibited she's a complete natural at playing sensitive, intelligent, strong-willed free spirits. The kind of girl I wish I was. She plays off of everyone brilliantly and she's my second favorite leading lady for Mr. Roshan. But I just have to say she doesn't do the kissing as well as Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. Still if I can't have more of my favorite on-screen jodi Miss Kaif definitely has some serious sparks going for her with Mr. Roshan. Can't wait for the Hindi version of ""Knight and Day"" starring these two. Tom and Cameron who?

Natasha played by Kalki Koechlin is pretty much everything irritating to me in another woman. I can't say much more about her without massive spoilers but I will say the actress did not wow me either.

Cool stuff: the actors did all the sky diving and scuba diving themselves! The tomatoes action was as real as it gets. And most importantly the car worked!

Direction and writing: Zoya Akhtar is so amazing as a director and storyteller. Her brother is no slouch either his dialogue is wonderful and if you get a chance to watch his own directorial efforts do so. It's amazing that this is only the second film Ms.  Akhtar directed. I can't wait for more.

It's the characters and their constant conversations, jabbering oftentimes, that elevate Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara to a higher rank. Looking inward, Zoya and Farhan as the dialogue-writer, borrow liberally from their own life and those around them. When a film or any story for that matter is rooted in true experience, it succeeds in transmitting the feeling easily to another person because in the end, our experiences are the same, we are raised like everyone else with friends to count on, our tiffs are the same and we love no differently. The biggest achievement with this film, in all honesty, is that they stay true to what they have often expressed, of how important friends are to them and how their friendships fulfilled the need for other significant relationships a man must have.",1346716800,,941,5.038461538461538

Abhay Deol and Farhan Akhtar are amazing too, and the chemistry between these three actors immediately makes you believe they have been friends their whole lives.  This is a road trip movie about three friends spending vacation together before one of them gets married and the trip is probably the greatest part of the movie. The cinematography of ZNMD is breathtaking, shot on location in Spain it almost seems to beautiful to be real.  While there is only one dance number during the movie it is PERFECT and the song will play over and over in your head. (FYI-there is a dance number that is shown during the end credits so keep watching). Finally, the soundtrack to this movie should be bought along with the film!

Language is no issue however as the director makes beautiful use of surroundings and music to tell the story. The actors also deliver top notch performance, making excellent use of their body language and facial expression to accurately convey their respective character's feelings. The songs used in the movie are well written and add further depth to the movie's premise.

4660782,5,B005DJDF2I,"This film is one of those movies that will stay with you for a long time. One can relate to these characters and at least in my case, the humour was very close to the kind of silly slapstick humour I share with my friends.

This film is perhaps not for everyone, especially those viewers who go in thinking they are going to be getting the standard Bollywood fare of music, dance and drama. There is none of that. Although the music is great, it does not take anything away from the film, like so many movie soundtracks do and after a while you just want to scream at the screen for them to move on with the song and dance to get back to the story. I loved the fact that the only big sequence song 'Senorita' was actually sung by the actors themselves instead of the usual playback singers India is famous for. It lent the song a certain credibility and I enjoyed it even more, not minding the interruption in the film.

The drama in the film is subtle and not overpowering at all. It comes across in certain scenes that are short and don't interrupt the flow of the movie. I especially like the scene where Arjun is thinking back to his break up with his ex. It was an insight into his mind and immediately one understands the change occurring in him. I especially loved the scene where Imran finally meets his birth father Salmaan (played by the fabulous Nareerudhin Shah). Imran's disappointment in his birth father is evident and makes him understand the meaning of being truly sorry for a misdeed. I was so glad it was not some big happy family re-union, which would have been completely unrealistic.

My favourite scenes perhaps are when they come up after their diving experience and Arjun has a life altering moment, as well as the scene where Imran and Nooria are talking, him in HIndi and she in Spanish. They were both touching and sweet moments in the film.

What made the movie special to me was the addition of the fantastic poetry by the great Javed Akhtar (the father of the director Zoya Akhtar and the actor playing 'Imran' Farhan Akhtar, a great director in his own right). It was different and the way it was used in the silent moments of the film where characters were experiencing a significant moment in their lives, making it so much more poignant than it would have been with just a good background score.

I really don't have any complaints about this film. As far as I am concerned it is perfect. It did not lack anything and it did not have any aspect in excess either.

I will say though, watch this film with an open mind, go into it not expecting anything of it and you will be pleasantly surprised.",1327795200,2,2630,4.4235537190082646

Kabir as the reliable, responsible, most grounded of the three .. or so I thought.

The only redeeming aspect of the film is the beautiful scenery that is Spain. Otherwise, Indian actors (male) seriously need to come to terms with the fact that they either spend time building and flexing their muscles or going to acting school and taking acting seriously as a profession. I am indeed a Bollywood fan but a very critical one at that. A ten year old child could have done a better job writing the dialogue. And as far as acting goes? It breaks my heart to even go there;I am not likely to contain myself. Do yourselves a huge favor and rent it for the scenic locations. These actors were not making a movie with a story grounded in depth and substance; they went on a long vacation instead and got paid handsomely for it.

4660787,4,B005DJDF2I,"The director and the script writer (both of whom are the same by the way) have done a brilliant job in keeping the goings on true to the title. The movie works for one main reason that the four characters played by Katrina, Hrithink, Imran and Abhay are very easily relatable. In fact, I think all of us who have watched this movie would have felt at many points that the dilemmas and the emotional conflicts which they go through are the ones that we too have gone through at some points in our lives. And that we too perhaps need to discover the spirit of Katrina's charatcer, to feel, enjoy and live life the way it is supposed to be. The picturesque and sangunie Spain and the way the scenes have been shot is an important aspect, for it indeed helps us understand why the three men feel the way they do and why they realise that Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara.
Katrina once again proves and with consummate ease, why she is the best actress Bollywood has ever seen. She is not only a Goddess to look at but the comfort and ease with she portrays this carefree character while retaining her feminine appeal at all times, says a lot about her actining abilities. The scene where she is talking to the ""three musketeers"" over shots of vodka is a case in point.
The cynicism of Indian journalists/critics who are from a generation when Indians suffered from a serious inferiority complex about their abilities and everything in general and every person and event was looked at with doubt and suspicion, find flaws with her accent and acting because they can NOT believe that there can be anyone who can have it all - who is impeccably pretty and can act well too. A reminder to all such people - ""Not everyone who lives amongst humans is necessarily human - there are Goddesses too"".
Katrina needs to seriously learn from Shah-rukh-Khan some tricks about self promotion and media manipulation. She must not let her talent go unnoticed due to poor PR. She is brilliant and amazing.
Kalki, was the only sore point in the movie. I felt like skipping the chapters in which she appeared but did not want to loose on the continuity of the goings on. She should restrict herself only to the dark, with-an-ugly-under-belly, weird kind of movies which her dark, with-an-ugly-under-belly, weird husband produces.
All three men did a good job. It showed that they had understood and imbibed the three characters well, before the cameras started rolling.
Naseer's cameo was a surprise and he did a phenomenal job of it. With a total footage of 2 minutes or so, it is only a seasoned and a born actor who can convince the viewer that he is indeed the character that he portrays and not some 300 films old veteran who has every imaginable accolade to his credit.
This movie surely deserves a place in my collection and Katrina in my temple.",1315872000,,2821,4.5770750988142295
4660788,5,B005DJDF2I,"""Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara"" (ZNMD) is a complex, honest, and thoroughly refreshing story about friendship, about love, about choices, about ... well ... the journey of Life (lit. 'zindagi'). Writer-Director Zoya Akhtar takes three characters we might think we've seen before ... but deftly makes them original, fresh, and unexpectedly engaging. Her intelligent script perfectly balances the very real, even painful, personal transformation of each character with moments of joy, wit, charm, and humour.

No one's Life Journey is ever quite what one plans!

Our protagonists? Three best friends since childhood: Arjun (Hrithik Roshan), now an investment broker in London; Imraan (Farhan Akhtar), an advertising copywriter in Delhi; and Kabir (Abhay Deol), a construction architect in Mumbai. Ten years after college Kabir's imminent wedding impels 'The Three Musketeers -- all for one, and one for all!' -- to finally embark on the many-times-deferred adventure challenge they'd always planned.

ZNMD explores whether three grown men can survive a 3-week road trip together *and* still remain friends *and* still be the same people.

Think you've heard similar, before? Guess again! Ms Akhtar elevates the basic 'road movie' premise into something rare and sublime: brilliant character-driven comedy never cheap but often laugh-out-loud funny, and so true to life and people each of us actually know that it genuinely moves the heart as well as the mind and funny-bone. As each ZNMD character in turn challenges his own fear, whatever personal demon that has been holding back his life, it becomes our victory, too.

See ZNMD and discover: *your* life may change, too!

Such strong story and plot would be lost, without great acting.

Farhan Akhtar (the writer-director's twin brother) just gets better and better, as an actor, every time out of the gate. Already one of India's best young directors, his deceptively brash but sensitive and layered acting in ZNMD is quiet excellence ... and deliciously funny.

Abhay Deol is not exciting, but I like his potential. A good foil for the other two.

However the real revelation in ZNMD is, most surprisingly, he whom we might have *thought* most familiar. Hrithik Roshan we see so often in heavy dramatic and/or demanding multi-part roles -- because, let's face it, he's that rare actor who CAN do them, and do them brilliantly well -- that it's easy to forget just how plain damn funny and versatile he can be. Casting one of the world's more notorious compulsive workaholics as, well, a compulsive workaholic? Absolute genius!

On the distaff side ... Katrina Kaif. Wow! Where did this performance come from? She's always been beautiful, of course, but in ZNMD for the first time she shows subtlety and depth as an actress. Easily, her very best work to date.

Cannot finish without special mention of the fantastic music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy, long my favourite Hindi film composers. Their ZNMD soundtrack perfectly backdrops the film's emotional journey. Irresistibly hummable music spans the full range of moods and emotions, much like our three main characters: everything from amusingly lighthearted ('Senorita', sung by Mssrs Roshan, Akhtar, & Deol) to cool and modern ('Ik Junoon -- Paint It Red') to reflective ('Der Lagi Lakin') and even unabashedly romantic ('Khaabon Ke Parinday').

But the rocking 'Dil Dhadakne Do' seems to capture the very Joy of Living ... and that is the ultimate spirit of Zoya Akhtar's ZMND.

Perfect summer movie! 10/10

Best film I've seen yet from anywhere in the world, thus far in 2011.

Am definitely holding out for the complete 2-DVD version (and/or Blu-Ray) on this title.",1315353600,5,3664,5.196943972835314

The director's brother Farhan Akhtar had made a film on his debut which was about friendship but this sophomoric debut by his sister Zoya is completely different from the Dil Chahta Hain.

Abhay Deol is plannig to get married to Kalki Koechlin but before he does, he wants to have a road trip in Spain with his childhood buddies- Farhaan Akhtar and Hrithik  Each of them will choose an adventure sport and will participate in it, whether they like it or not. It is during the road trip that they meet women, resolve issues in their life and live lie to the fullest.

This is a fantastc film in all respects, I had loved 'Luck by chance' and this one furthers the evidence that Zoya Akhtar is one of the most underappreaciated but one of the greatest directors that we have on the scene today.

Hrithik Roshan is great throughout the film and so are Farhan Akhtar and Abhay Deol. Karina Kaif looks pretty after a long time and Kalki Koechlin plays the part of the possesive girlfriend ably.

Shankar . Ehsaan and Loy have gven us a decent soundtrack. Especially 'Senorita'

Carlos Catalan's cinematography transforms the film and the locations are superb.

I thought these scenes were the best:

Kalki's expression when she watches the friends walk in the lobby, while Ajay is cradling Katrina in his arms.
The song Senorita
The tomatino festival in Spain
The Sky diving scene
The events that led to the engagement of Kalki and Ajay
Farhaans meeting his father for the first time and his conversation with his mom.
The song in the climax.

ZNMD is one of the better films of the year and Zoya  Akhtar has created an anticipation for her next work. See this now. 8/23/2011 4 stars",1314057600,8,1908,4.58235294117647

I don't look for ""art"" in movies neither mindless action. Something simple that we can all relate to as human beings. And this movie delivers it in doses. We have a bit of all these characters in us and go with their emotions as they take the incredible journey across the beautiful landscape of Spain.",1522540800,,447,4.530864197530864
