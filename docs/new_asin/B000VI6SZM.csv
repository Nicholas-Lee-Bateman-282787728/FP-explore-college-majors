This shows all of the things she was planning, songs she was recording (for Diddy), and all the drama with her family Neffe Pugh (sister) and Frankie Lons (mother). This is all of the things you should see about Keyshia Cole besides her famous super-stardom.",1227312000,,358,4.698412698412699

8218819,5,B000VI6SZM,"Season 2 and 3 are better imo because there's more drama revolving around her and her family issues as the show and seasons progress within time but Season 1 was still very good and decent enough overall.... :)

Season 1's mostly just about Keyshia and how she became to be the person that she is now.... And how she struggled growing up without having her mother because her mother was constantly strung out on drugs as she was growing up and has never really had that mother/daughter bond... And because of these struggles, according to Keyshia these struggles made her a 'survivior'.... and had made her into the singing star that she currently is...

Good season... 5/5 stars :)",1422921600,2,682,4.722689075630252

8218821,4,B000VI6SZM,I missed watching this show because they do not show re-runs of it after all three seasons ended. I haven't watched it in years and that's when I decided to purchase this dvd. Watching it brought back memories and now I can watch it as many times as I want without waiting for BET to show one of the episodes. Full of drama but it's still a great reality show.,1415145600,,360,4.1571428571428575
