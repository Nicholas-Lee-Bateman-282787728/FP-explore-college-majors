Ok, most of the rest of it isn't all that great, but lets be honest, it is a movie about how boring most people's lives really are.  These poor people have nothing going on in their lives, so they do this.

Amazingly enough, there is an extra on the DVD that shows there really is a national bagging contest in (of course) Vegas every year, and it actually is a big deal, to those involved.

- National Lampoons was funny.

Can somebody please explain to me how a movie about a supermarket owner who trains a bag boy to win the national bag packing competition is funny?

Bag Packing groupies? People cheering on a contest to see who can bag the most groceries the fastest? The bad gays are from a supermarket in the same area, even tho it goes national? A Steam roller flattening a heap of trolleys in the supermarket car park????

Who the hell gave the green light to shoot this crap? And worse yet, who thought it was funny????????????????

Put it this way; Imagine your local supermarket entered a bag packing contest and won it... would you care? Could you possibly start thinking, ""Oh, my supermarket has the country's fastest bag packers, I am so proud of them, I think I will shop there exclusively forever""

Gimme a break, if you don't care in the real world, why would you care in this glorified monstrosity that bag packing could have been a national past time?

Whoever it is at national lampoons okaying this garbage needs to be fired right now, there was once a time when national lampoons meant something to comedy. When movies like Animal House and The Vacation series, hell even Loaded Weapon would draw crowds in numbers and the movies didn't even need to be promoted cause everyone would be already talking about them and encouraging people to see them, sometimes NL gets a decent movie out, but what are the averaging? 1 decent movie a year, and 10 you wouldn't wipe your 244 with.

So can I say anything good about this movie? Well, it's better then National Lampoons Golf Punks, but that's a given. Avoid this movie at all costs, there is nothing funny or memorable about this movie at all.

I often see movies have gratuitous nudity that I really think was not needed at all and just shows the movie trying desperately to appeal to some perverted audience... well, as there is none in this movie, for the first time in my life I can say that a movie needed it to even somewhat make it somehow appealing to somebody in the world.",1247875200,2,2166,4.535897435897436

Save your time, money, electricity and wear and tear on your couch and don't watch this movie.

Its not even funny. I was close to just turning it off about 10 minutes in. It was a waste of resources to even make this movie. It's about bag boys who compete in a competitions to see who can fill bags the fastest. They go on the pro circuit and travel the US. All Lame!

This movie would not even be good if it was playing in the waiting room while I was waiting for my oil to be changed.
