7943301,5,B00005KH3O,This is an extremely well-done film with hilarious special effects.  They are charmingly executed and fit with the over-all look of the film.  It is amazing what they were able to do at the time this was filmed but remind me of Jason and the Argonauts.  The costumes are great and the story-line is fun while making a profound point.  I watched the film in Russian with English subtitles and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I don't have any kids but think this would be entertaining and appropriate for them as well.,1199664000,6,508,4.6
7943302,5,B00005KH3O,"Serge is wrong. The DVD, at least, has an English language track (and several other languages too) as well as English subtitles. Like the other Rusico fairy tale titles, this is a beautifully produced disc. The film itself is a lot of fun - and Serge, it is just as good, if not better, than Hollywood movies of the same genre (and there are not a lot of those). Generally speaking, Russian fairy tale movies are some of the best ever made for children, and this is a superb example, full of quirky characters, slapstick, color and magical happenings (as well as some scary moments, one right at the beginning). But what ARE those brass pipes? Well, you CAN'T find out in the movie ...",1077148800,13,685,4.488
7943303,5,B00005KH3O,"This is a fairy-tail love story.  Although it is not of the quality of US movies, it is still entertaining and my children watched it repeatedly until they wear out the VHS tape. It is in Russian language.",1012867200,8,205,4.394736842105263
