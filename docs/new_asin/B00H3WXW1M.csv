6130927,3,B00H3WXW1M,"I'm 60 years old, and the first disc wasn't too hard to pick up.  I think I could have been happy with just that one disc.  I moved on to disc one and it got harder way fast . . . definitely not gentle and not for beginners.  Even the some of the students in the class had some trouble.  I think it is fair to say that Yoga Warrior 365 would be best for a student that had about considerable time practicing in a live class under the guidance of a certified yogi.  It could use much more information about how to make different positions work for a student's skill and flexibility level.  Perhaps a beginner or an older person would be better served with a ""gentle yoga"" class / set of discs.",1425513600,4,692,4.126865671641791

Should of done more research prior to purchasing this DVD set.  After contacting the customer un-service person today and getting cookie cut answers, I am done with UDAYA Entertainment.",1421280000,3,212,5.59375
6130931,5,B00H3WXW1M,"My serious yoga journey started with Udaya's Ultimate Warrior. This latest offering from the same company is of the same beautiful production quality.

I started this series thinking it would be a continuation of Ultimate Yoga. It's not, but it is a wonderful practice.

It is a comprehensive series, consisting of 12 regular workouts, plus a few bonus ones. Each time I do a workout, I say to myself, ""this is my favorite."" Okay, so now I have about 14 favorite workouts. Each workout has a focus, e.g. hip opener. It also has a ""Warrior Tip"" separate section that gives very detailed form pointers on specific poses. I have not yet had the patience to watch these, but I do plan to do so.

Why I love this practice:

* It gives me peace. I'm at a very stressful and sad time in my life right now. Even though I have a strong faith, I needed something more to help soothe my soul. This practice does just that.

* It forces me to confront my weaknesses. Many yoga teachers say that yoga helps you work on your weaknesses. I never really `got' this until now. I am a hyper person and one who has very little patience. The very slow cadence of these workouts helps me work on my patience. I must admit, when I first did these workouts, I didn't like them very much. I kept waiting for the pace to pick up. That is the whole point of these workouts!

* They challenge me. It's hard to put into words how they challenge me. It's not just physically, because you are holding the poses for longer than I am used to, but on a much deeper level.

* The practice structure. We begin every practice by setting our intention. It's a wonderful way to start calming your mind and to focus on the upcoming work.

* The beautiful production quality. I feel relaxed just looking at the set.

* Rudy. What can I say? I love him. Think Army Drill Sergeant finding his softer side. He is a hoot. I can't tell you how many times, I'm struggling in a pose and Rudy comes out with one of his sayings. I burst out laughing, with maybe a snort or two thrown in.

Rudy does talk a lot and that might be off putting for some. I find his form tips are spot on.

If you are looking for a rather unique yoga practice, this may just be the thing for you!",1419379200,6,2225,4.236406619385343
6130932,5,B00H3WXW1M,"Useful and entertaining instruction.  I personally appreciate Rudy's constant reminder and illustration to work with in your abilities and modify as necessary to match you physical ability.  I never felt ""guilty"" for not being able to do poses like the teachers in the classes.  This is extremely important to someone who has chronic injuries and is naturally inclined to push a little too hard",1417305600,2,394,5.125
6130933,5,B00H3WXW1M,"Great production!
Not as challenging as Ultimate yogi put out by same company.
Good solid workouts that won't blow you out or feel like you missed something.",1410307200,10,157,4.851851851851852
6130934,4,B00H3WXW1M,"I love how each of these practices are approximately 60 minutes in length.  They fit perfectly into my day.  Each is intermediate in level which is also perfect for me.  The reason for the 4 star rating is mostly because it suffers by comparison to the Ultimate Yogi series.  UY has been my introduction to yoga and I love it.  It's meditative, it has a nice build then moves to relaxing floor poses.  I ordered Rudy's YW365 to give some more variety to my daily yoga.  While the practices aren't bad and they are similar in difficulty to UY, it lacks the meditative quality and the lovely build that UY provides.  Rudy talks and jokes constantly throughout the practice and I find it very, very irritating.  (My husband doesn't mind Rudy's banter and finds him entertaining.)

I don't have any other experience with yoga other than 6 months using UY, so take my opinion with a grain of salt.  But, just this morning, I put in a YW365 class and within 5 minutes had ejected it and replaced it with a UY DVD.  :/  It's just a personal preference.",1403481600,27,1045,4.465608465608466

6130936,5,B00H3WXW1M,"I LOVE this program. It's great if you are new to yoga or just want to perfect your practice. While I am about a year into my yoga journey, I was having problems with injuries with some other programs. Not because those programs were bad, but because I didn't have a clue about proper alignment.

Rudy Mettia designed an excellent program that allows you to learn or better understand many yoga poses. There are 3 warrior tips on each DVD that run about five minutes each and thoroughly explain the key poses. I play these again and again while referencing my yoga anatomy book to make sure I'm doing things correctly.

The yoga practices range from beginner (The Gathering) to more difficult power flow sequences. I still can't do the ""Freddie Mercury"". Rudy is a riot, I constantly find myself laughing as I learn. Best yet, I've done all the DVD's and not injured myself!

Well done Udaya and Rudy Mettia!",1386979200,13,908,4.627329192546584
8629658,2,B00H3WXW1M,"I hate to say this, I dislike this series. I should start out by mentioning I own MANY exercise DVDs, a little embarrassing actually.  I own Ultimate Yogi (Travis Eliot) and Deepen Your Practice With Vytas (Vytas Baskauskas). I can compare these but I want to review THIS video series.

I really wanted to love it... But. First off, I really don't give two hoots about one off color joke.  However, I want to do yoga. Rudy spends entirely too much time talking and as such, this series moves slowly. A class that could be 30 minutes is stretched into an hour. And it isn't as though we are spending more time in each posed- just more time in Downward Dog while Rudy talks about being in the moment. I want to do YOGA!! Perhaps I am alone, I don't want to listen to Rudy while I stay in Downward Dog for a few minutes- I want to do the video more than once ie, I don't want to hear it every week.

Also, I wouldn't say I am a yogi- yet. I have been doing yoga intermittently for about four years so, really, about four months. This series is too basic, I don't need so much information on how to do a pose.  I attend yoga classes and am occasionally corrected. Again, let's get moving here, kids, this doesn't need to take all day.

Positive notes... someone made a 12 disc yoga series. It was nicely done.  Obviously, Rudy knows what he doing. I will continue to look for a series I will continue every day.  This isn't it.",1473811200,4,1423,4.2444444444444445
8629659,5,B00H3WXW1M,"First, let me say that if you base your idea of the difficulty of this practice on ""The Gathering"" you will be sadly mistaken. The Gathering is easy and is very, very introductory.  However, as you work through the other parts of this practice you will discover that you are a dripping, soggy puddle from the intensity of the program.  So often I see reviews saying this is ""so much easier than the Ultimate Yogi.""  Not true.  I do both - the Ultimate Yogi is just different.  The Ultimate Yogi is the Type A person's yoga practice, whereas Rudy is the antidote to that type of behavior. Rudy absolutely forces you to slow down and to completely ""be"" in any particular moment and pose. I'm a *very* Type A person so I completely adored Ultimate Yogi (and still do) because it feeds that part of me that wants to go-go-go, to conquer, to do and do some more. However, in working my way through Yoga Warrior 365 I have found myself more centered, more grounded, more focused and definitely pushed outside my comfort zone in a very, very different way. You are short-changing yourself if you blindly believe that it is less difficult because some other Type A person like me was enraptured with UY and didn't understand, didn't more deeply analyze YW365.  Try it. You will find it is amazing.",1464480000,3,1289,4.558441558441558
8629660,5,B00H3WXW1M,"I recently received this set as a gift. I had already done a lot of research on it and noticed so many reviews comparing it to the Ultimate Yogi and indicating it was not as challenging or not as good as UY. I have done the Ultimate Yogi, but still love this program just as much! They are both excellent DVD sets. Yoga Warrior is challenging and I love that I can actually focus on the pose and what my muscles and joints are achieving in each! It gives me a chance to try to work on my posture. Although I am still working my way through the set (I have done 7 of the DVD's so far), I feel like I am challenged - maybe a little different type of challenge than UY, but still challenged nonetheless. The classes are a bit shorter then UY which is also a nice break since I do them early in the morning and I really like Rudy's laid-back ""non-yogi"" style. He clearly has a lot of knowledge about yoga and how to avoid injury and he also gives tips at the start of each DVD on how to properly achieve the poses that will be a focal point of each DVD. If you are on the fence about buying this, don't be - it's a great program!!",1458777600,5,1126,4.0088888888888885
8629661,5,B00H3WXW1M,"This is the type of yoga I love.
Pros
1. Long enough to sink into your pose a little.
2. But quick enough to keep you from getting bored.
3. Rudy Mettia's voice is so calming and relaxing.
4. His Warrior tips where he explains poses in more detail are pretty good
5. He is rather charismatic and interesting
6. He shows modifications for most poses.
7. The production quality is great
8. The program is organized and well thought out.
9. There is room to grow (in my opinion.  A more advanced yogi might find it too easy.)
10. He has a strong focus on finding stability first and preventing injury.
11. He reminds you several times to use modifications if necessary and will even have the models use modifications so that you don't feel bad having to do it.  I was surprised at how effective that was.
12. He has this adorable older woman as one of the models as well as several people with injuries.  He talks about their injuries including his own and how modifications are made for them.  I found that really helpful.
Cons
1. The explanations of the poses in the Warrior tips could be a smidge better but honestly he does better than most of the teachers I've seen.
2. He made a sex joke about one of the female yoga models in the Yin class which I found really inappropriate and distasteful.  Honestly, why do some guys think that's OK.  Basically he said she would need a cigarette soon because she's over there moaning.  Ugh
3. I would say this would be difficult for a true beginner.  I've been out of practice for several years and I spent the last month just trying to finish the first class.  I was expecting a much easier first and second class.

If I could do a partial star I would do 4.75 but I can't so it gets 5.  I really enjoy his style of leading the class and I LOVE the pace and focus on stability.  I hope this review helps others.",1457568000,16,1853,4.293103448275862
8629662,4,B00H3WXW1M,"I ordered this set as a progression to my one and a half years of (at home) yoga practice.  I am 61 and have found that regular yoga practice virtually eliminates all of my chronic back and hip issues and allows me to stay active with my work and play with my horses and other physical activities.  It is a practice that also helps me stay more centered, relaxed and present throughout my day.

These are beautifully produced DVDs and I have them in my weekly yoga rotation practice....(I do a YW 365 DVD on three days a week and cycle through my others  (see Vytas Baskauskas for other good yoga instruction) for three other days a week).  It is nice to have a wide variety in this set, with a stated purpose and focus for each disc and Rudy Mettia challenges the student to set their own intention, a great idea for practice as well as daily life.

Rudy Mettia is a distinct and strong personality and there are parts of his instruction that I find a bit, well, distracting.  For someone intent on focusing  the student on the practice, he has a way of bringing the topic (continually) back to himself and sometimes I feel like he thinks he has to 'entertain' the student during the workout or something.

Even with those somewhat negative aspects of his teaching style, there is an inherent kindness in him as well as a deeper spiritual aspect that shines through, and I have found that my yoga practice has grown and improved immensely as a result of working 'with' him on his dvds.  He illuminates ways to get more from the movements, points out alternative angles and caveats for those of us with knee issues and other physical challenges and these are quite helpful.

I do find some of his 'chatter' funny, but all too often I find myself begging for just a few moments of silence while I simply do the work....these silent moments are rare though, when Rudy is in session.

All-in-all, I believe this is a set I will be able to stick with for years to come, and look forward to continuing to grow with it; perhaps my level of patience will also expand with its use.",1453593600,2,2073,4.440633245382585
8629663,5,B00H3WXW1M,In addition to the 5 start reviews here I would like to add that I have been dabbling in yoga for several years.  This is the first time I truly got into a rhythm of breathing that was natural and fluid without any effort.  It just happened for me. The instruction is perfect.  The Warrior  tips were so good that I corrected poses I've done for years without understanding what I'm doing.  I feel like this is an invaluable program.  I can't wait for each new DVD.  It is challenging but not discouraging.  I can't stop telling people about this program.  It is worth waking up and spending the hour with Rudy and your own practice. I'm already hoping for another series even though I can be with this practice for a very long time. This is top notch.  Worth every penny.,1441065600,,772,4.373239436619718

8629665,5,B00H3WXW1M,"I practiced yoga back in the 80's when I was a teenager doing the super shape up program. I've done little since but have always looked for a  program that is real and comprehensive like that. If you spent a few weeks doing the first one and wait until your body tells you as it will that it is ready to move on this is the perfect set for you. The guy that teaches it is funny, natural, and real. He doesn't come off trying to pose for the camera but comfortable teaching and even joking in front of a large crowd.",1437350400,3,515,4.049019607843137
8629666,2,B00H3WXW1M,"i really wanted to like this. After the Ultimte Yogi i thought this would be a nice change but its way too EASY. i did 2 cycles of UY, and i guess that ruined me for this. This is NOT a progression or a complement to UY, maybe a precursor. too easy. Great production though, just not for intermediate or advanced yogis.",1432080000,5,319,4.161290322580645
8629667,5,B00H3WXW1M,I would highly recommend this set for anyone interested in doing a home practice and can also be taken along when traveling. This yoga set was well constructed.,1426636800,,160,4.75
