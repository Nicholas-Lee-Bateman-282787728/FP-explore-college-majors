They pull in some huge hogs out of spring creeks and it's always nice to see the Green River on display.  However, if you're looking for in-depth instruction, this video does not go very deep at all.  It is an enjoyable video, but I would consider it 80% big fish catching, 10% instruction, and 10% advertisement.",1291939200,,385,4.4714285714285715
8333458,4,B001PKHRZU,"the information here is solid but i purchased it expecting to find a good deal of material that would be novel for a moderately experienced fly fisherman, especially pertinent to large trout. most of what is in here is covered well in many other books published since at least the early 1970s. there's nothing wrong with it, but i think the blurb for it tends to oversell it.",1242432000,,375,4.529411764705882
