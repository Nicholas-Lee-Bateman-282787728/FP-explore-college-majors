8255330,5,B0014DODG4,"My 5 yr old grandson who is Autistic and is unable to speak absolutely loves this movie and has since he was about 18 months old. We think he must identify with Hermie somehow. We've bought many copies because he takes the movie everywhere he goes and it gets dropped, stepped on, cracked or scratched. There was a phase he went through in times of frustration that he would bite the movie case so hard and crack it and if the movie fell out he would pick it up and bite that which would damage the movie to the point it would not play..not good!  His mom has really worked with him to help him to understand it's not okay to bite the movie. Thank goodness because Hermie really is the only thing that will cheer him up on a bad day. We hope Hermie is available for years to come.",1453852800,,780,4.1655629139072845
8255331,3,B0014DODG4,"I gave this movie a ""3-star"" because although the concept and teaching is great, I have a hard time watching it.  Some of the Hermie Movies are great (Buzby, Milo) but others are just lacking interesting story lines, including this one.  Thanks!",1280707200,,245,4.809523809523809
8255332,5,B0014DODG4,This is a very well made show. Didn't even know there was a movie - only had the books. Has some star voice talent adults may recognize and is very nicely made. Computer animation is clean and pretty.,1219104000,,200,4.2894736842105265
