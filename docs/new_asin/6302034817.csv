7819937,3,6302034817,"I just looked ""Steven Wright"" up in Wikipedia.  I wasn't even sure that he was still an active comedian.  Well, of course he was never what you would  an ACTIVE comedian, and that was the point.  He was all about monotone delivery and off-the-wall humor.  (Interestingly, I somehow seem to have forgotten that he appeared in THE ARISTOCRATS--must have served primarily as one of the commentators: I'm pretty sure I would have remembered his particular take on THAT joke.)  At the peak of his fame, Wright seemed the perfect post-modern comedian, for those who use such terms--and for those who don't use such terms, well, let's just say he just had a great deadpan shtick.  And it worked most of the time.

But is it just me, or has this humor NOT aged especially well?  This performance tape dates back to '85, and it shows.  The material which used to seem so ahead of its time, now seems very much of its time (which is to say, a little dated by now).  Wright's witticisms were dryer than powdered water, and that certainly set him apart from some of his more manic (if equally ""high concept"") contemporaries (such as Robin Williams and Steve Martin).  Wright built off the deadpan ""hip to be square"" tradition of Pat Paulsen, Stanley Myron Handelman and others, but was more cerebral and therefore ultimately hipper.

If you ""got"" Steven Wright you could afford to be a little self-congratulatory.  This was smart humor--for the well-educated if not the well-heeled.  He didn't make jokes about metaphysics as Woody Allen was won't to do.  But the jokes were conceptual, and if you could conceive them, well, you were entitled to pat yourself on the back a little bit.

So why does it all feel a little dated, nowadays?  I don't have an answer to that.  The culture HAS gotten louder and more garish over the past 20 years, and what passes for humor these days is more outrageous but certainly less ""intellectual.""  It's nice, in a very real way, to revisit an era where this more whimsical wit was not only acceptible but desirable.  But it does feel very much at a remove from everything going on today.

I smiled a lot watching this old VHS.  The actual guffaws were fewer and further between.  Some of the audience's laughter, when the camera pans to them, does seem forced--as though if the camera WEREN'T on them, they'd probably just be smiling slyly.  And that, in the final analysis, is probably how you should be reacting to Steven Wright.",1160265600,4,2453,4.675233644859813
