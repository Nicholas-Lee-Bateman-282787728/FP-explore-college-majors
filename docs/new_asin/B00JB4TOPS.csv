8649544,5,B00JB4TOPS,"Note: I have not yet heard the commentary on first the two hour movie that was the series premiere of The Incredible Hulk.

'The creature is wanted for a murder he didn't commit.' That part of the shortened narration which was used for all the episodes after the second two hour movie included on Disc 1 stuck with me for some reason ever since I saw bits and pieces of the classic show in my formative years, when I was too young to follow the plot, but old enough to appreciate the action on-screen. Now, I'm watching the series, and it's Incredible (pun intended). Though I like the current Hulk played first by Edward Norton and subsequently by Mark Ruffalo in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (I don't remember the 2003 cinematic photoplay too much, except that it was terrible; but I plan to see it again after I watch the final television movie that served as the conclusion to the 1978 series), Bill Bixby/Lou Ferrigno's version is my favourite. The pilot explains why The Incredible Hulk does not kill, and it handles the human drama very well, keeping the show grounded in reality and focusing on issues that affect normal human beings. The show is perfect for the whole family to watch. While the transformation scenes may be frightening for very young children, the violence is limited to The Hulk throwing people non-lethally rather than punching them because it would have been too violent for children who watched the show, and because one punch from The Hulk could kill someone instantaneously. The language is limited to three or four uses of Damn and Hell, and no sexual content. Of course, the humour is always appropriate. This show is an excellent viewing choice for the young, and the young at heart.

The series premiered in 1978, and lasted for five seasons, the first one having twelve episodes including the two feature-length movies, seasons two and three twenty-and-three episodes, season four eighteen episodes, and season five seven episodes, followed by three reunion movies.

8649549,5,B00JB4TOPS,Two actresses make this the best show of that year.  Laurie Prange in episodes two and three and Deanna Lund in episode 5.  Laurie was brought back for two more during season 4.  They should have been back a lot more.  The show would still be on today.,1500595200,,252,4.1875

8649551,3,B00JB4TOPS,"I'll be writing the same review for all 5 seasons. It's based on the quality of the DVD transfer not the show content (I love the show) .
The transfer aspect ratio is the old pan and scan made for square tube TVs.  In order to get a widescreen view I have to manually change the aspect ratio which ""stretches"" the picture and leaves the top of the screen chopped off.
I'm very disappointed and wish the studio would have taken the time to adjust the aspect.",1461456000,,457,4.252873563218391
