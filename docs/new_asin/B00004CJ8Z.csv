7920306,1,B00004CJ8Z,"It was supposed to work on my non-British DVD system.  It didn't.  My Bose 3-2-1 Home Theater system said ""Bad Disc"" and can't play it.  I was deeply disappointed as I have seen the movie once before on Turner Classic Movies and had hoped I would have my own copy of this incredibly funny and factual movie.  I'd like to get my $34. back.  (That includes shipping costs of approx. $5.)",1474243200,,385,4.366197183098592

7920309,5,B00004CJ8Z,"This is an excellent movie and has to be one of the MOST IMPORTANT World War 2 movies ever made, not only is it a TRUE story, it stars the ACTUAL person that that the movie is about,  ME Clifton James plays himself, in the role HE played in World War 2!",1341187200,,253,3.8653846153846154
7920310,4,B00004CJ8Z,"This is a great British ww2 movie.

It's a true story about M. Clifton-James

(who was a character actor before entering

ww2).He was assigned to the accounting dept.

in the British army and on occassion would

dress up as Field Marshal Montgomery on stage

for local army canteen type shows. He was seen

on stage by a man from British army intelligence

and was asked to pretend that he really was

Montgomery. James was paraded around from country

to country as Monty,hoping that the Germans would

believe that he really was Monty. They did.

The harrowing escape from capture as Monty by

the Germans showed how they completely bought

the Brits deception.

After the war James wrote a book about his

experience of playing Monty during ww2 as well

as being the actor who played himself/Monty

in the movie.

This is a movie every war buff will love.",1168214400,,858,4.675675675675675
