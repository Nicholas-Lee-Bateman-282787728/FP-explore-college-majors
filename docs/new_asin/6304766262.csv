7876811,1,6304766262,"""Return to Savage Beach"" was a bridge too far: it's the Andy Sidaris movie that finally broke me. It was the 12th of 12 Andy Sidaris movies I watched in a relatively short period of time, and it's by far the worst. Made nine years after the original ""Savage Beach"", the franchise has more than worn out its welcome. I started out paying attention, but as soon as the abominable opening theme song bleated its way into my consciousness I began to mentally withdraw: by the time I heard more of the KSXY radio blathering that has stretched across several Sidaris features and was never entertaining or funny I was distinctly unamused. I detested this movie more with every passing minute. What finally put me over the top? Julie Strain as Willow Black. Strain is not a good actress, and I'm being kind. Here she's in a sea of non-actresses but still manages to distinguish herself. The plot is a mishmash and rehash of other Sidaris plot elements, mostly revolving around the Lacrosse satellite and evil terrorists. To tell the truth I did watch to the end but I have no recollection of the last half of the movie, which is actually merciful.

I have given other Andy Sidaris films positive reviews, but I have to say enough is enough: there is nothing new here, and everything we see in this one has been done better in other Sidaris films. This is all pain and no gain. If you want to see an Andy Sidaris film, don't watch ""Return to Savage Beach"", just watch ""Savage Beach instead.",1470096000,,1482,4.550561797752809
7876812,4,6304766262,"If you were a fan of Russ Meyer, then this is Andy Sadiris' best knock off...or should I say KNOCKERS OFF effort to pay tribute to the Master. Andy gives you more plot than Russ but less nudity which in the case of Return to Savage Beach is a real crime. Julie Strain is easy on the eyes but can not act while Julie K. Smith and Shae Marks gave their best screen performances and really carried the entire movie.  A quick snapshot of this movie - a typically convoluted plot with male actors who can't act, girls who get applause for just being able to keep from toppling over, beautiful location shots and lots of explosions. The key to enjoying RTSB - the pause and slow motion buttons. A 4.5 for Andy, too bad he didn't feature Julie and Shae in more of his movies. If you like realistic big fake boobs, this is your cup (DDD) of milk!",1308441600,,838,4.2375
7876813,4,6304766262,"Return To Savage Beach is one of the most distracting movies I've ever seen. Actually, a lot of Sidaris' movies are distracting. You can't focus on the plot, when you have beautiful people in beautiful locales driving beautiful cars. I have no idea what this movie was about, but whenever you have women as beautiful as Julie Strain, Julie K. Smith, and Shae Marks onscreen, who cares what the movie is about. You still get some enjoyment out of it. Julie Strain is awesome in this, as she was in most everything she has ever appeared in. There aren't any women working in movies today who are as badass as she was. Sadly, she has retired. I also loved the ninjas in this movie. Yeah, there is some good action to go along with the hot babes and dudes!",1301961600,,752,4.41726618705036
7876814,4,6304766262,"After reading one of the other reviews I just had to add my two cents...The other review starts out fairly normal, but then takes a right turn into Shae Marks breasts and goes on and on and on about them, and believe me Shae's breasts at the time of this film deserve just that.  I have to agree with the other reviewer that Shae 'had' one of the best overall looking pair in the biz and with only two nude scenes, one very quick and the other running about 1 minute or so a little disappointing we couldn't see more of them.  Shae makes this movie and it's a shame she had them reduced.  They appeared to be just to perfect for words in both size and shape.  They were quite the pair and she is one gorgeous woman.  ok, I have to stop drooling and move on.  I do get my Andy films mixed up (they're all basically the same), but it's either this film or one other Andy film that we also get to see Pandora Peaks in a great nude scene with some guy in the middle of the forest, showing off her massive headlights, but before she went SUPER HUGE.

Here's to you Andy for making such fun films to watch...too bad there aren't more of these type of films around...",1135209600,,1160,4.128888888888889
7876815,3,6304766262,"Sidaris movies are typical: women, corny plots and action. ShaeMarks-Tiger and Carrie Westcott-Sofia are two of the most beautifulwomen on earth. This movie has everything gorgeous women, buff guys for the ladies, action, explosions. What ever your interest this movie has it!",955065600,6,276,5.595238095238095
7876816,4,6304766262,"Buff Bagwell truly is the stuff.  He gives the most awesome performance I have ever witnessed.  As though Buff's comedic (not intentionally) presence is not enough, there is random nudity, and explosions that are even more  random than the nudity.  This is the movie that every college student  dreams about making.  Two thumbs up.",947548800,7,331,5.037037037037037
