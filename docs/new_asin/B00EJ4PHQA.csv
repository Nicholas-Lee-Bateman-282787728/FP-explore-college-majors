8605936,5,B00EJ4PHQA,"Absolutely loving watching these complete seasons again, the show is still as funny as it was when it aired, and Season 2 is one of the funniest.  Season 2 begins with the continuation of the water park outing from the final episode of Season 1.  Lois is dragging both Reese and Malcolm out of the pool at the bottom of the slide after Malcolm pushed her down and she grabbed them both to plummet down with her.  The family is driving home and Hal is annoyed by a silver Honda that is driving up his rear, the vehicle finally passes him then seconds later is involved in a fatal head on which blocks the road home.  While the family is caught in the middle of nowhere awaiting the road to be cleared, Lois is having trouble coping with what she can't control, Reese is at war with an icecream truck driver who refuses to sell his icecream and Malcolm has met a girl who he sees a future with. Meanwhile Dewey having followed the paper bag from the last episode is now lost in the middle of nowhere and asking a scarecrow to come alive and help him.  If you bought the official soundtrack back in the day, a lot of the songs such as Cotton Eye Joe and the sound bites used in the Dust Brothers song I Just Don't Care, are from this season, such as Lois (""that's just freaky"") going to dinner with Kitty and Abe and Hal (""folk heroes, like Bonnie and Clyde"") taking on a hoon that is endangering the lives of everyone on the streets.

Francis is still at military school in this season.  Memorable moments in this season include Dewey making friends with a fly, Malcolm goes to hospital for appendicitis but is put in the kids' ward, Reece is made to undertake a cooking class as punishment, Dewey is tormented by the new neighbours' gnome, he also looks after Jellybean, Craig's cat and loses it. Malcolm and the krelboyne's steal an old woman's car.  This season has the bowling alternative universes episode if either Lois or Hal takes the boys. The boys sneak out to the carnival with Stevie and run into a psychopathic security guard when Stevie asks him to open the gate and let them out.  Dewey finds a mini bike and the boys work together to restore it only to have Lois forbid them from riding it.  Francis visits home with an extra ticket to the wrestling forcing Malcolm and Reese to compete for ""this pleases me"" points. Hal looses a couch of the roof of his car that he is taking to the dump before the neighbourhood is evacuated due a train derailment likely caused by his couch, where Malcolm is grounded and Lois won't let him leave his cot, while Reese and Dewey set out to make as much money as they can in the evacuation centre. Season Two ends with the flashback episode to when each boy was born when Lois suspects she might be pregnant which shows how the standard of life and economic situation went from 80's yuppies with just Francis, to where they are today with Dewey.

This show works as you can easily put yourself in Malcolm (and sometimes the parents) shoes.  My mum was just like Lois.  You feel Malcolm's embarrassment as Lois spanks him in front of everyone at the evacuation centre for example.  Keep an eye out for the guidance councillor from Freaks and Geeks who thinks he can bully Reese and force him into the special class by failing him.  He never counted on Malcolm and definitely didn't know about Lois!",1436659200,,3345,4.433931484502447
