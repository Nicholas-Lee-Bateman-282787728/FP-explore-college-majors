2838129,5,B000QGDXUW,"This film is one of my personal, all-time favorites. Even though I have no frickin' idea what the hell ""Mystagogue"" means, and I heve yet to find it in any dictionary, I musty confess that that this flick is awesome.

I doubt thsi DVD is anything but  a vhs transfer, but hell, it is still worth it. Lewt's go through why this film is worth your time and money...Let me count the ways:

1.  Horses running at the beginning of the film.  Anyone who knows martial arts knows that when a film starts with poeople riding horses, someone is going to be killed in the next 30 seconds or so, and usually at the hands of a dude in a funny hat.  And guess what?  That happens.

2.  Strange weapons.  We're talking about the Bloody Birds, my friends.  They're like ninja star fans that get thrown like boomerangs.  They also get used liek a chopping fan blender type thin.g.  And the dude who uses them is a creepy, ominous villain that shows no mercy.  And he's got a funny hat.

3.  A Blind Shaolin monk.  C'mon, they can smell an a$$-whoopin' and will deliver it thusly.  And this particular monk is pretty righteous and bad-ass, especially with the eyebrow-mustache thing happening.

4.  Stolen scrolls.  Somebody wants the secrets and the price will be paid in blood.

5.  Political intrigue and betrayal.  You know that this is a fairly crucial element for the ""blood and honor"" theme that makes kung fu so awesome.

6.  Invincible kung fu style.  Why is this a great element?  BEcause the user of this style lay the law down on all those who get in his way and think they're silly enough to defeat him.  Plus, when the baddie that's invincible goes down, it's usually pretty brutal.  And this film is no exception.

7.  Carter Wong.  Great martial artist.

8.  Cheese dialogue.  Although not the cheesiest in the genre, but the ""My uncle is an epileptic"" line is one of my all time favorite. Plus, they have some of the coolest voices dubbing this flick.  It really adds tot the flavor of the film.

Man, this is gonna be my 5th copy I'm buying because I keep lending it out and my friends love it so much, I just let them keep it.  Maybe I'm a sucker...a sucker for ""Shaolin Kung-Fu Mystagogue"".",1269734400,2,2193,4.441919191919192
2838130,5,B000QGDXUW,"This is Shaolin Kung-Fu at it's most electrifying...! The story-line is well screenplayed and the acting and continuity is magnificently balanced.
It keeps you on the edge of your seat. Here you get to see a true Shaolin Priest set the pace and example for all to wanna follow and emmulate. It's a no-nonsense flick with some real serious acting and plot. The Shaolin Priest is the quintessential teacher and superb, finesse fighter who holds the secret of the Shaolin's Buddah's Fist or otherwise called the 18th and final form...; the ultimate technique. Chang Yi is as cunning and clever as always, being one step ahead of his peers, but lacking the honesty and patience to be honorable. Carter Wong is the patriarch student of Shaolin Temple trained by the Master Teacher Priest Fighter of the Shaolin Temple. His fellow student who was a spy at Shaolin working for the Manchus is toppled by his disloyalty, killed by Chang Yi, who's in the end killed also by the Shaolin Priest. Chang Yi looses out on his shrewd, cruel ambition to attain the secret book containing the 'final form.' Carter ends up getting it, after dueling also with Chang Yi. This is a remarkable flick you won't ever get enough of...! Classic !",1207440000,3,1219,4.754716981132075

This movie also has a very goo fighting scene at the end that explains the deadly technique. This deadly technique is mentioned throughout the movie, but never elaborated upon.",1468886400,,267,4.702127659574468
