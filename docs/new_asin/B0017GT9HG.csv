8265805,3,B0017GT9HG,"I admit I'm a novice at enameling and wanted to see how this process was done. So much of the photography was from a distance and you couldn't tell what she was doing a lot of the time. Also, the pictures shown on the packaging etc are not the project done in the DVD....which involves 2 cranes rather than the other pieces shown. In fact, the cranes aren't shown at all in the exterior packaging! I spent a lot of time wondering what/how she was tweeking the wires or applying color but admit that I did gain some insight into the process.",1464652800,,540,4.303921568627451
8265806,5,B0017GT9HG,"For having been filmed in the 90s, the quality of image is pretty good. The information is REALLY good. She walks you step by step through a cloisonn project, including her rather unique bezel method.

I've bought enameling books, but there was something about seeing it that made it much less daunting.",1462838400,,303,4.826923076923077
8265807,5,B0017GT9HG,"I found this DVD to be the best in overall  instruction on cloisonn. Granted, I did have a good background in enameling  but this was SO complete and well ordered that i think anyone with a little basic knowledge would enjoy and benefit from it.  This is much superior to a book because you actually see the entire process, not just photos during the process.",1330473600,9,359,4.492307692307692
