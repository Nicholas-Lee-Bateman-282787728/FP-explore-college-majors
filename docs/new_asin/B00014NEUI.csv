8006381,3,B00014NEUI,"If you're a fan of classic Spanish cinema in the Pedro Almodvar style, then consider 'Km. 0' (alternatively known as 'Kilmetro Cero' and 'Kilometer Zero' in its international releases) as one bowl of Almodvar Lite.  The script and tone have Almodvar-like chance intersections and misunderstandings between characters (as well as its sexual openness) that send the screenplay skittering off in new directions.  However, while Almodvar is the master of the shock revelation and feel that expertly walks the border between drama and masterful comedic touch, 'Km. 0' is trite, superficial and completely implausible.  And, by the way, a pretty nice little rental.  It's 105 minutes of digestible, enjoyable fluff that's just right for a Saturday night showing in your living room.  Just don't expect the movie to resonate with you the next morning.",1169251200,,844,5.315789473684211
