7840604,1,6303194761,Purchased movie for my class.  Played it for first time this week and the movie is poor quality.  It has lines running through it.  It is shaky.  The picture will go out but the sound remains in tact.  The tracking adjuster does not help.  I have a hard time believing that this was a new copy when he plays worse than the one I was trying to replace.  Very disappointed.,1286236800,,371,4.214285714285714
7840605,4,6303194761,"The cover of this video is deceptive.  It actually has very little to do with Jeffery Dahmer.  Nonetheless, it has some facinating stories about some other, less famous, serial killers.  The best story is about the guy who worked in the hospital.  'Murder by Number' starts off boorish, but gets better towards the end.",1047600000,2,319,4.851851851851852
