8278166,3,B000171QVE,"I would have preferred to see more of Rani Mukherji and less of Sanjay Dutt in this one.  If I were Indian perhaps I would have liked the film more as a result of patriotic attachment, but even though the film had a few exciting ""action"" scenes, most were predictable(if not inevitable).  The strength of the film was in the interpersonal relationships, both between the soldiers themselves, and between the soldiers and their families. Like many Indian films, the tendency was toward representation rather than reality.  I was disappointed.",1181606400,3,541,5.056179775280899
