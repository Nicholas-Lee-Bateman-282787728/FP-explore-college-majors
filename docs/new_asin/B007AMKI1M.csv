5072532,5,B007AMKI1M,I read the book first and then wanted to see how the movie portrayed the action.  Reading the book first helped me to enjoy the movie.,1392249600,,134,4.153846153846154
5072533,1,B007AMKI1M,"It would have cost money to add something to our vcr to make it accommodating. And, as far as liking the film, he really enjoyed the acting. That's why he ordered the movie!",1376697600,,173,4.2727272727272725
5072534,5,B007AMKI1M,"Wish I could view it, but it's on a European format that my DVD player cannot interprite. :-( Still like the movie though",1369699200,,121,4.304347826086956
5072535,2,B007AMKI1M,"The White Tower is one of those forgotten star vehicles that occasionally crops up unannounced in the TV schedules and surprises you with how enjoyable it is. It's a fairly simple story, with Glenn Ford's wandering ex-G.I. joining Valli's expedition up a mountain that's defeated everyone who's ever tried to climb it more out of interest in her than the climb only to find himself in competition with Lloyd Bridges' ruthless and unrepentant Nazi. Unfortunately, though the BBC have shown a decent enough colour print of the film, for some reason ever-erratic Odeon have chosen to release a pretty dire black and white version on DVD in the UK. Since the colour location photography is one of the film's biggest assets, it's a particular travesty, and the black and white transfer isn't even good in its own right.",1366588800,,814,4.905797101449275
5072536,5,B007AMKI1M,"55years ago, I read The Wite Tower translated in Japanese and enjoyed it very much. Just then the film was shown in technicolour.

But I missed it. Recently I looked for the dvd in Japan but coudn't. And hit it at Foreign Amazon. It is monochrome and doesn't fit

dvd players in Japan , only can enjoy by pc. But it remindes me of  my youth and makes me happy. I treasur it.",1366416000,2,374,4.095890410958904
5072537,5,B007AMKI1M,"The video I ordered arrived almost before I placed the order.  Very speedy service.  The video in question is what I consider to be a collector's item, which in this case is a colour version of The White Tower, a classic climbing film from the 1950's. All in all, very satisfied with the service.  I highly recommend the seller.",1344643200,,328,4.52542372881356
5072538,5,B007AMKI1M,My orders came quickly and were in perfect condition. I expect to be happy to deal with this supplier again.,1283990400,,108,4.45
5072539,4,B007AMKI1M,"So okay, we've all heard of the ""forgotten cinematic treasures"" that turn out to be a load of cockywocky, but this is the real thing.
The choice of title was unfortunate, but they didn't know that in 1950. ""White Tower"" is a Hollywood version of the ""mountain film"", a strange interwar German genre that served as a nursery for people like Leni Riefenstahl. In mountain films, a doomed climbing team composed of varied and conflicting types takes on an ""unconquerable"" peak, dying one by one on the way up until the only survivor reaches the top to undergo an ineffable mystical experience before freezing to death. (No wonder they lost the war.)
""White Tower"" replaces the metaphysics with melodrama, and that's all to the good. The setting is the immediate postwar era, where a burnt-out GI is goaded by an ex-Nazi to join a badly-assorted climbing team. It's all uphill from there.
Glenn Ford (he looks about fourteen) plays the veteran with his usual solidity. Alida Valli, needless to say, is worth seeing in anything. Claude Rains gives a nice turn as a tormented author, with a truly wild-eyed breakdown-on-the-glacier scene (""Is it good enough, Astrid?"") But the casting gets interesting with the unique appearance of Oskar Homulka, beloved for decades of portrayals of either Gestapo or KGB thugs (he's lucky the Cold War lasted so long -- he couldn't have passed as an Arab) as a good guy, a rugged, stalwart guide. Balancing this oddity, the ex-SS villain is played by none other than Lloyd Bridges. And he's good, easily overcoming all memories of ""Sea Hunt"" and ""Airplane!"".
I have no idea who Tetzlaff was or if he ever made another flick, but he did a solid job with this one. ""White Tower"" is a perfect example of the kind of film that used to be dismissed as ""product""  which in retrospect stand head and shoulders above nine-tenths of what's made today. They were good back then, and it's pictures like this one that reveal exactly how good. While it'll never knock ""Kane"" off the ten-best lists, ""White Tower"" is worth your time.  Track it down before Spielberg or somebody decides to throw together a remake.",1088812800,21,2128,4.795640326975477
8513453,3,B007AMKI1M,It's just an ok film - not as interesting and exciting as I thought it would be.,1527638400,,80,3.764705882352941

8513456,1,B007AMKI1M,I had to return the DVD because its format was not compatible with USA standard.  I am waiting to receive my credit.,1443571200,,116,4.2727272727272725
8513457,5,B007AMKI1M,"A great lost Technicolor jewel of the early 50's, refracting in a cool, icy prism the lingering shafts of ashen light emanating out of the earliest revelations of the Nazi genocide, the post-war formation of the United Nations, and that brief limbo of incipient film noir realism that would soon
spiral outward and explode into the dueling and threatened forces of the McCarthy/HUAC hearings, the Hollywood blacklist, and the revolutionary arrival of Brando, Clift, and Dean onto America's mainstream movie screens.",1439078400,,515,5.37037037037037
8513458,5,B007AMKI1M,Excellent movie and the DVD was of good quality.  The price was reasonable.,1438905600,,75,4.769230769230769

8513460,4,B007AMKI1M,"Great cast, great scenery (too bad black & white) and a good story line. You also get to see Lloyld Bridges play a Nazi.",1424217600,,120,4.041666666666667
8513461,1,B007AMKI1M,If there were a zero star I would give it to this version. Heavily censored. Not worth watching. Buy a very old vhs version if you want to see the real movie.,1420675200,,158,3.96875
