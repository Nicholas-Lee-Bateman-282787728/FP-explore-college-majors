509453,5,6302783348,"I can think of no better portrait of alienation and loneliness than Bergman's ""The Silence,"" which I think is one of his three best films.  Everything about the film suggests silence, emptiness, aloneness:  the huge, baroque, but strangely empty hotel; the silent lonely crowd that fills the streets; the ominous preparations for war; the inability of Anna and Ester to speak the language of the country in which they're stranded; the loveless, desperate coupling of Anna and the waiter she picks up; the frigid, despairing masturbation of Ester; the hotel porter's nostalgic but sad fondness for photographs of his past.

The essential thing is that the sisters Anna and Ester, for all their estrangement from one another, really are kindred.  Bergman seems to be suggesting that they represent two irreducible aspects of personality, sensuality and intellect, and that individuals suffer from an inner sense of fragmentation if the two are unreconciled.  (In this regard, the message of ""The Silence"" is not unlike Hermann Hesse's in Narcissus and Goldmund.)  So the exterior loneliness in his film is mirrored by the interior loneliness personified by the sisters' feud.

At the end of the film, the silence is broken by Ester's final note to her nephew, Johan, a ""translation of words in a foreign language.""  Words are what create communities.  They bind humans together.  As such, the end of the film offers a possibility that the long loneliness can be ameliorated by a human invention.  In the last analysis, that's all there.

The acting in ""The Silence"" is superb, from beginning to end.  Ingrid Thulin's Ester is frozen, emotionally blocked, but yearning for connection.  Gunnel Lindblom's Anna is a sullen carnality that occasionally breaks out in despairing loneliness.  Jorgen Lindstrom's Johan is inquisitive, innocently absorbing the world around him.  And Hakan Jahnberg's porter, while silent for most of the film, masterfully and poignantly expresses all he needs to in his gestures and face.",1214784000,,2011,5.2375
509454,5,6302783348,"***** 1963. Written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. Three Swedish Academy awards (Best Film, Best Director and Best Actress). Two sisters argue in an hotel room while Johan, a 10 years old kid, is discovering the corridors and the strange guests of the hotel. The train compartment, the hotel room and the town, three claustrophobic places that Ester and Anna can't leave while Johan seems to be the only one able to open doors and communicate. THE SILENCE is a huge film which, like some books, can be enjoyed again and again. In my opinion, one of the most beautiful films ever made and one of my most intense experiences in a theatre, ever.

509455,5,6302783348,"Originally titled God's Silence. This is a film of loneliness and despair. It is a film where there is great pain in existence. Three primary characters: Anna, Ester and Johan (Ester's son). The film opens on a train. This snapshot is telling - Anna coughing up blood and emotional, Ester comforting her son yet shooing him away minutes later, Johan the acute observer noting happenings in each cabin, noting the tanks careening by. They get stuck in a village where a language is spoken that they do not understand. They get stuck in a very old hotel where it appears that other than a troop of little people, they are the only one's in the place. Three auxillary players come into play - the maintenance man, the bartender and the hotel waiter. Most of the film is silent - except for some ambient music in the bar; and a very critical scene where Bach's Brandenburg Concerto is featured on the radio. While this is a piece representing Bach's highest achievement - the people we are exposed to in The Silence are all at their lowest. Seeking comfort in base desires. For Ester it is within that she seeks comfort from loneliness, sickness and despair. She turns to cigarettes, liquor, her intellect and her work translating great literature, and she brings pleasure to herself sexually. Anna, on the other hand, seeks to ease the pain of loneliness through others. Through the attentions and affections of her son; and when that doesn't work through the company of a stranger - in this case a bartender. Her efforts fail to ease her pain as well. Ultimately there is no relief. It is worth noting here Francis Schaeffer's comments on this film in ""The God Who Is There."" He points out that: this film is a statement of utter nihilism. Man, in this picture, does not even have the hope of authenticating himself by an act of the will. The Silence is a series of snapshots with immoral and pornographic themes. The camera just takes them without comment...That is all there is. Life is like that: unrelated, having no meaning as well as no morals."" Is there any hope in this film. I'd like to say that the waiter has some redeeming qualities to him. But he too is but a charicature of who he once was. The film ends back on the train with just Ester and Johan as they travel there is a storm raging outside. Ester opens the window to feel the rain on her face. Maybe the rain is God. Cleansing. Baptising. What she needs. The answer to her despair.",1179360000,3,2449,4.568181818181818
509456,5,6302783348,"The title of a dark and erotic final chapter of ""faith"" trilogy may sum up Bergman's own philosophy regarding religion and God - ""God has never spoken because He does not exist"". Bergman mentioned that he wanted to make a film with as little dialog as possible because ""he had made many films with a lot of talking"". He wanted ""The Silence"" to be a pure cinematographic experience where the images do all the talking. The films centers on two sisters, Ester (Ingrid Thulin) and Anna, (Gunnel Lindblom) to whom Ester is physically attracted. Esther, Anna and her 10-year-old son travel together and had to stop in a hotel located in an unnamed European country due to Esther's serious illness.

The film may be viewed on several levels -as the story of two sisters who apparently used to be close but are not able to communicate and understand one another anymore. Or it can be interpreted as a parable of Sensuality, Intellect, and Innocence, that cannot coexist in the world where God does not exist. As with every great and intelligent work of art, ""The Silence"" has so much to offer to its viewer, it's got so many questions to ask and it does not provide the easy answers.

Complex, suffocating, screaming through the silence, poignant, passionate, harrowing yet strangely hopeful and even funny sometimes - this is an unforgettable film, a masterpiece, a hidden treasure that has to be rediscovered and to receive as much praise and admiration as ""Persona"" and ""Cries and Whispers"" - for both of which ""The Silence"" was an inspiration. The acting by two Bergman's actresses is a miracle (as usual) as well as Sven Nykvist's camera work in creating the claustrophobic world where silence cries, whispers, and kills...",1166313600,4,1721,4.850340136054422
509457,5,6302783348,"This is a hard film which plays with your inner feelings without a drop of merciless. Two sisters stop in a hotel and will exchange her different opinions and points of view. One of them is frustrated lesbian without anything to give and furthermore nothing to share. The other one is the free loving mother of a 10 years old child. In this claustrophobic stage and micro cosmos Bergman will interweave a painful and harsh portrait in a hallucinating and valiant drama where the loneliness, the hopeless, the God's silence and the lack of affection will be the main springs of terrible revelations and mutual accusations.

509458,4,6302783348,"I'm an Ingmar Bergman neophyte and have seen about ten of his films to date, and I think this one haunted me the most. It couldn't leave my mind for a few days. It's crammed with hopelessness and emptiness, and to put it bluntly, is quite depressing. I was able to put up with Persona, Cries and Whispers, The Seventh Seal, and a few others with a fierce motivation to assess and analyze, but this one left me quite deflated. I think it was because of the way the little boy was used; he is left to roam the hotel occupied by weird hotelkeepers and dwarves that like to dress him up in girl clothes while his mother is out all day on sexual rampages with complete strangers, while his dying aunt spends her last days in a room upstairs. The pain displayed is so raw and unflinching that one is inclined to feel uncomfortable and wondering. I think the capper was the ending of this film on the train: mother and son leave the country and leaves the aunt alone to die, and the son, who has openly worshipped his mother all along, looks up at her with such open contempt that she visibly reacts, putting her hand to her throat. And then he looks down at this picture that aunt has given him. It ends on such an enigmatic note that one has no choice but to feel depressed for some time.",1055548800,4,1283,4.262295081967213
509459,5,6302783348,"Easily the finest Bergman film Ive ever seen. I like these chamber movies because of the strange, paranoid claustrophobia of it and appreciate the film more in this way than as a religious insight or whatever, even though its the end of his whole trilogy of faith thing. I found it more likeable as an evocation of early Polanski films and the little Georges Bataille Ive read which also often create a vaguely impending, ominous setting. The film is about two sisters who been have obviously joined and subsequently repulsed by a sexual relationship with each other and while one sister is dying in a foreign country where they don't understand the language, the other is off experimenting in heterosexual encounters. One of the sisters also has a kid and the movie is often seen through his eyes. For me, the movie was about communication and I guess the young boy in his black and white, innocent naivety represents the inability to articulate feelings and emotions other than in bold, crude expressions that seems also to become the sister that is not dying. The sexuality is never explicit but always feels graphic and often disturbing and this hinted, uncertain quality of the girls relationship runs through to the child who seems only too understand things on a vague level. Im thinking of the foreign butler who I thought was very creepy, showing the little boy pictures of dead people after enticing him with sweets. The scene with the little people I couldn't help but think of David Lynch and his man from another place. Overall, a darn good movie. Highly recommended.",1049760000,,1580,4.833948339483395
509460,5,6302783348,"Watching this movie, I am reminded of the old Biblical story of the prophet who sought the word of God in many places but found it in the great silence.  This unsentimental movie tells the tale of two sisters on their return from a vacation, one of whom suffers gravely from lung disease perhaps cancer, the other is accompanied by her little boy.  While many questions lie realistically hidden in the shadows of silence--most importantly the understandable pain of the two sisters--nevertheless there is unexpected tenderness, remarkably from a stranger and a child.",989107200,4,567,5.086021505376344
509461,5,6302783348,"Along with  Cries and Whispers  and  The Seventh Seal , Ingmar Bergman's  The Silence  is his best work, a film mesmerising in its still potent power to disturb. The film charts the deterioration of the relationship between two sisters who book into a vast hotel in a nameless foreign region.  Tensions mount and hostilities soon arise as both sisters can only find  futility in their search for a warm, compassionate and tender relationship.  Anna ( Gunnel Lindblom ) has a compulsive sexuality, which prompts her to  have sex with strangers, while Ester ( Ingrid Thulin ), a cold repressed  and alcoholic intellectual agonises over her lesbian feelings for her  sister...
The Silence  is a strange film fuelled by strange passions and  emotions. It's rather minimalist in style, for Bergman rarely ventures  outside the empty hotel, which is peopled only with a ghostly elderly  porter and a troupe of circus dwarfs. With Sven Nykvist's camera exploring  the space of the vast hotel corridors, it may for some recall  Last Year at  Marienbad  but I think the film has more significant parallels with David  Lynch's enigmatically bleak  Eraserhead , both films sharing similar themes  and a dark ambience. Symbolically, the film is not a difficult as other  Bergman dramas. The sense of decay is omnipresent throughout the film - the  sisters' relationship, Ester who is suffering with a terminal cancer, and  the region itself with its streets patrolled by tanks, suggesting the whole  damn thing is about to slip into war.  And Bergman's superb use of the  hotel, which the characters seemingly can't escape from, takes on almost  Kafkaesque proportions.  Made in 1963  The Silence  still remains strong,  with scenes of sex, nudity, ...and alcoholism. The film  ended an extraordinary trilogy that began with  Through a Glass Darkly  and  Winter Light ; a series Bergman made which addressed his evaporating  religious faith.

7830830,5,6302783348,"The Silence is the third film in the trilogy, beginning with ""Through a Glass Darkly,"" and then the second entry, ""Winter Light.""
Bergman 's search for God goes very far and he takes us on journeys that demand stamina and perhaps some idea of how spirituality works for him and for ourselves.

The first two describe God as a Spider, savage, devouring, only extinguished by love. Love is the key, and those who are lucky enough to attain it will find joy, healing, even some modicum of belief.

In ""Winter Light"" the idea of love as salvific is questioned. The pastor of a remote Lutheran Church has lost his wife, love has died and so has God. A school teacher has since entered his life; he loathes her attempts to be like his wife. He despises her skin disease, her vulgar mockery of faith, faith he has long since discarded. Death odf a parishioner frightens the pastor and makes him cling agaion to Martha, the school teacher. His conclusion is a hollow witness to Christ in the Eucharist as a distraction from panic..possibly suicide.

The Silence is a world without God. It begins on a train headed for a strange town where two sisters and a young boy begin to absorb the pervasive angst and reveal themselves in the face of this hellish landscape as essentially carnal, with the boy looking on in misunderstanding and fear. Incest, self-defilement, unhealthy Lesbian sex, stark carnality, make up for who is silent, has always been silent..God. There is only this savage, devouring existence, a real hell, where gratifications are repeated, where dwarfs dress the boy as a girl, where  people fornicate in the local theater, mimicking the actions on the stage..formulaic copulation among the dwarfs, displays of  transvestism with real men, all presented in a smoke-filled arena, hot and humid, where nothing seems to gratify the senses. It's all semi-lust, no referents, no cause and effect, no rationale except desire without communication or real choice..a hell indeed.

The trilogy is one of the great masterpieces on film. The Silence is the completion and it is daring, not because the scenes of carnality, but because of the themes it unfurls. The absence of meaning is acted out with a realism that mesmerizes and scares all at once, and never lets go of you for one moment.
.
Unforgettable, deserving all the hurrahs it has received..all three films..The Silence is the greatest, but it is the coda so it had to out do
perhaps the others. Buy the three and experience something of the horrible, inescapable truth Bergman bravely serves up.",1406505600,,2556,4.85091743119266

7830832,4,6302783348,"A film I definitely need to see again. My first reaction was the same
I've had to many of Bergman's films: deep admiration, but not personal
adoration. In this case, the more extreme, self-conscious surreal style
threw me off. This feels more like something by Bunuel, Fellini,
Beckett or Lynch (all of whom I love).

Two sisters, polar opposites - one sensual, emotional, promiscuous,
self-centered, representing the body, the id. The other, intellectual,
sickly, sexually isolated stands for mind or super ego. The child of
one, perhaps 8 years old, is accompanying them on a train trip, heading
home. We never know where they're coming from or why they went. They
stop in a city clearly preparing for war, or under some sort of
military occupation. They stay in a baroque but almost abandoned hotel,
unable to communicate with anyone, since this unknown land has a
language none of them speak.

While one sister picks up lovers, and the other languishes ill in bed,
the boy explores the creepy hotel (The Shining was definitely
influenced by this), making friends with a circus full of dwarf
performers, who, pointedly, are the most normal people in the film.

All of this is done with very little dialogue (to the point where the
effect felt forced and self- conscious at times). I had a hard time
clicking in while watching the film, but images and moments have really
stuck with me, and reading why so many intelligent critics think it's a
masterpiece makes me very open to re-visiting this extremely open
ended, stylized film.",1334966400,,1533,4.865900383141763
7830833,4,6302783348,"The Silence by Ingmar Bergman-

like a Bergman picture, a story based in the images presented & not enough backround to really make any concrete sense out of the story. He means to raise questions in your mind as a primary purpose.

The story revolves around two sisters that stay in a foreign country at a hotel. The country is either at war, preparing for war or experiencing civil unrest as your shown tanks in the street more than once. There doesn't appear to be any war damage though. One sister has a son of about 8 to 10 years old. His mother is very sensual & motivated by oils, perfumes, baths, nudity & men. The other woman is the older & responsible sister motivated by work, yet enjoying masturbation as men & their equipment along with the physical act of sex repulse her. She is also dying of a lung disease. The boy loves both his mother & his aunt but lives in a childs world avoiding the adult context of it. When he does see some of it he is more mystified than anything.

The two womens relationship is complex & subject to many interpretations. I bought the Criterion edition & it of course has an overview of the movie in it's booklet. I disagree with a lot of what is said there but most notably that the story is told through the eyes of the boy. So much do I disagree with it that I feel you must be brain dead to reach that conclusion.

The why of the younger sisters sexual activity can be taken as being anything from wanting out from under her older sisters babying of her to a desperate attempt to deal with the fact her sister is slowly dying in front of her eyes. She takes her boy & leaves  the country on a train while leaving her sister dying in a foreign land while being watched over by hotel staff that do not speak her language.

There are tons of religious, famalial & societal questions raised by this movie but since you never get a clue as to why they were traveling, why they stopped in a foreign country where they didn't speak the language or even why they have come to the point where they can barely speak to each other you cannot make a coherent story out of it.

You watch a movie like this for the wonderful images put on screen & the upclose & personal, though unexplained actions of the individuals. A great Bergman movie but not a great story as he never intended to tell a complete story.

The acting is dynamic, real & a joy to watch. Ingrid Thulin as the older sister Ester & Gunnel Lindblom as the younger sister are perfect in their roles, few others really matter at all. The is very little dialogue & only the words of the main characters are in the subtitles so be ready for a slow paced but well constructed movie with great acting & cinematography. I give it 4 Amazon stars.

A bit of nudity but nothing at all by todays standards. It was very racy when made though. Recommended for at least one viewing & more than one to try & put it together.",1324166400,,2909,4.274545454545454

The terminal sister longs for some comfort from her sibling or perhaps some infusion of her vitality but is cruelly rejected.

Ingmar Bergman's film is mesmerizing but difficult (at least for me).  To be honest, I wasn't sure that the two women were sisters until reading about the film after watching it.  I had thought they were perhaps lovers who were experiencing difficulties.  At any rate, there are definite homoerotic aspects.  It has been said that the film opens up if one realizes that the two women are really aspects of a single woman.  I wish I had had that in mind when I watched it.  Maybe the gloomy hotel is a metaphysical stage wherein a conflict between spirit and body is played out.  At any rate, I can't say that watching this movie was a completely satisfying experience for me, though no doubt the fault does not lie with Bergman.

7830837,4,6302783348,"The last film of Ingmar Bergman's Spider Trilogy, The Silence (Tystnaden), is not as good as the film which directly preceded it, Winter Light, but is closer to it, in quality, than the trilogy's comparatively weak first film, Through A Glass Darkly. This is because the weak link in Bergman's filmic repertoire is his ability to handle sexuality. Through A Glass Darkly has the most of it, Winter Light is nearly void of it, and The Silence has a bit of it, although not nearly as much as the lurid American trailer for the film would suggest. That trailer, available on the DVD, would have one believe that the two thirtysomething sisters in the film, Ester (Ingrid Thulin) and Anna (Gunnel Lindblom) were engaging in explicit lesbian sex, of the variety one might see in a 1990s porno film.
  This is not so, and this film, in essence, is substantially different- both in tone and in substance- from the two other films, which lends credence to Bergman's claims that these films never formed a formal trilogy because not only is the spider God imagery almost absent from this film, but almost all references to religion are gone, as well. It seems that there has been a fatuous critical shoehorning of this film to make it part of a de facto trilogy, but one simply cannot support that claim if all three films are viewed in a row. In reality, this film can be seen as the first half of a duplex of films that ends with Persona, and the Spider Trilogy is really a Spider Duplex, too. It's not really about `the absence of God', as some critics claim, but rather an almost The Twilight Zone-like film dealing with the absurdities and cruelties of life, regardless of a God or not.
  Ingrid Thulin, as Ester, is very good as the repressed sister, and Gunnel Lindblom radiates an almost sleazy sex appeal as the horny Anna- which is perhaps the most oft-used name for a Bergman female character, who wishes her sister dead. Seeing the film now, however, it seems laughable to think that this film was Bergman's most controversial to that point, since the sexuality is so tame, even the scene of ester masturbating is really nothing to get excited over (pun intended), even though we see- in an upside down shot of Thulin's magnificently structured facial cheekbones, that Ester is enjoying herself. This eroticism, and the censorship battles over the film upon its release in country after country, made it Bergman's biggest grossing film in his career.
  The cinematography in this film is more daring than in the two other film's of the trilogy- both in camera movements, the usage of light and shade- especially in the scene where Anna is forced to watch a man and a woman have sex at the dwarves' cabaret, and in his use of subjective shots from the points of view of the lead characters, mostly Johan. The musical interludes consist mostly of Bach's music, especially The Goldberg Variations, and are deployed well. Musical taste seems to be the only thing the two sisters can agree on, re-emphasizing the old adage of it being the universal language.
  The Silence is the longest of the three Spider Trilogy films, at 95 minutes, but it seems the shortest, for it is the most quickly paced, with the shortest scenes, and is largely shorn of the long monologues its two predecessors have. It does, however, have the most symbolism of the three films, which again undercuts the mistaken critical consensus that Bergman had abandoned such techniques when he started this sequence of films. And the schismatic sisters in this film prefigure the more melodramatic personality sharing of the actress and nurse in Persona, only in a more dramatically believable and realistic way. Anna is free, sexually wild, and her body's none too subtle motions bespeak this while Ester's hair is pulled back, and she looks a typically Bergmanian severe and sexually repressed, as almost all of Thulin's Bergman characters are. This character goes to the extreme of even declaring she hates the fish-like smell of semen, although to compensate for the character's misanthropy, she looks far more sexually appealing in this film than in Winter Light.
  Yet, through it all, I could not get the idea that this film was in some way influenced by Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone television series, which was in its heyday when this film was made. It has all the psychological and sociological hallmarks- weirdness in the nonsense language of the foreigners (reminiscent of such Twilight Zone episodes as the one where beautiful people are considered ugly), a child's point of view, tension, deeper issues masquing under the obvious- save for the sexuality and paranormal, that Serling specialized in, and seems far more akin to it than the two other films in the Spider Trilogy. Regardless, it is an excellent film that touches on some quintessential Bergmanian obsessions, and, for doing so, it grabs hard at the human.",1221868800,,4902,4.8389021479713605
