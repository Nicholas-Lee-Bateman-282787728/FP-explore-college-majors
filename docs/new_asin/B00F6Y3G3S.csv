8612788,5,B00F6Y3G3S,I like Douglas Fairbanks Jr.  This is not my favorite movie of his.  My favorite movie of his is I like your Nerve.  I hope Amazon will come up with this movie and I will buy two because enjoyed that movie so much.  Sound of Love is a Racket was good.  The quality of the picture was difficult to rate because I played it on my computer and also it is a 1932 movie which does not come in perfect.  The movie itself was good for that time frame  considering how people in movies talked and acted somewhat gangster style. I also like the way Douglas Fairbanks Jr. treats his women particularly in I like your Nerve.  I may have given it to high of a rating but I just enjoy his movies.,1478736000,,683,4.082706766917293

8612795,5,B00F6Y3G3S,"This is a fun, entertaining movie, with Douglas Fairbanks Jr in his prime. Fast paced, simple storyline. I'm going to spare everyone another amatuer critical review, just look up the movie in IMDB for the full story. I will say that the DVD movie & sound quality are very good for a 1932 film.",1395014400,2,293,4.444444444444445
