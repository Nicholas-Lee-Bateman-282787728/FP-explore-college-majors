8086383,4,B000083C4R,"After the cliff hanger that ended the last boxset, we find Domon and Rain still in Shinjuku. The Devil Gundam is nearby and continues to attack with it's Death Army, which Domon and Master Asia are easily able to beat. However, an interesting twist occurs when George, Chibodee, Sai and Argo appear fighting against Domon as minions of the Devil Gundam and as Rain finds out someone else is working for it...someone Domon will find it hard to lose.
After the development and setting of box one, this second boxset gets into the meat of the story as Domon faces the Devil Gundam, loses allies and gains new ones. Most of this boxset is based around Domon retiring to the Guyana Highlands in South America to train to control his Super Mode. The mysterious and wise Schwarz Bruder of Neo-Germany manages to show Domon that he is not yet ready to take on the Devil Gundam and its minions. The same is true for Domon's new Shuffle Alliance allies and Schwarz arranges for them all to end up training in the same place. Here we get development of the other cast members and their crews. This leads into the final disc of this set where the full force of the Death Army is used against our heroes. Fans of the more classic military idea of Gundam will be pleased to know that this involves the Shuffle Alliance employing military strategy. Following this we get an intense duel between the Shining Gundam and the Master Gundam. At the end, only one will remain standing... Whilst I love G Gundam as a whole, this second boxset is a big improvement of the first one as we get into the real plot of the show. A note of warning to first time viewers- stay away from the G-File on Round 5. It contains a spoiler about Schwarz Bruder.",1050969600,4,1723,4.473015873015873
8086384,5,B000083C4R,This volume set is great.  It makes you need to know what happens next.  I already pre-ordered the next rounds.  Can't wait to see who ends up being Gundam of all Gundams.,1050624000,,171,4.28125
8086385,5,B000083C4R,"This is the better of the 2 boxed sets currently available and will probably be better than the one that is coming out in April. I love this one the most cause so much happens in these episodes. The characters that were introduced in the 1st boxed set are developed more and you understand what is going on more and more. Plus it comes to a very satisfying end and sets up the next set of DVDs quite well. Though don't listen to me just go and buy this right now! You won't be sorry. Though buy the other boxed set too, so you will understand what is going on.",1049155200,3,560,4.1
8086386,5,B000083C4R,"As I watched these episodes on toonami when it was on, I just said they were my fav episodes! I just love Domon and Rain together!!! They look sooo! CUTE!!! Yes, it is a little sad and I do have some questions about it. But in like wise it's really good!! I like this one better than the first box set. If you have never seen G Gundam I suggest you get the first box set so you know how it all happend and who the characters are.",1046304000,,429,3.8863636363636362
