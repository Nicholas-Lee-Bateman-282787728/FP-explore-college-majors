8199132,4,B000R7G6J0,"One of my favourite Globe Trekker DVDs. Ian Wright, the traveller, was fabulous as always. Just be aware there is quite graphic animal sacrifice in this DVD, including of a dog, so just be prepared.",1190160000,9,198,4.685714285714286
8199133,5,B000R7G6J0,"Ian Wright takes you on this journey to Cambodia (I saw this on PBS). This is not your usual Ian being a goofball.

In this installment he talks with survivors of the Khmer Rouge's prison. One well-known prisoner Vann Nath is interviewed (whose skills as a painter kept him alive). One of seven survivors of Cambodia's Tuol Sleng torture chambers, and escaped when Pol Pot's ""killing fields"" regime suddenly collapsed in 1979. He painted graphic pictures of communist Khmer Rouge extracting ""confessions"" from victims.

Some of his paintings depicting the atrocities he witnessed while he was held captive are shown. GUT WRENCHING!!!",1183507200,6,633,5.196078431372549
