5682143,5,B00BY8DKJ0,"Again, thanks to Fox for releasing one of Grable's most entertaining films. And, again, besides Betty at the top of he game, there's wonderful choreography by Jack Cole, and the presence of Gwen Verdon to make this a must for all movie musical fans and collectors.",1369872000,,264,4.760869565217392
5682144,5,B00BY8DKJ0,"What is arguably Betty Grable's best musical of the 1950s showcases her singing, dancing and comedic skills at their best.

She has an excellent dancing partner in Gwen Verdon, and great support from  future TV favorites Irene Ryan (The Beverly Hillbillies) and Eddie Albert (Green Acres).

But the show is all the fetching Betty's, whether delivering the witty dialogue or performing the top notch Jack Cole choreography..",1368748800,,423,5.2835820895522385
5682145,4,B00BY8DKJ0,"The production design of this film is wonderful. The costumes, that were the last word in 1951, are great examples of that period. I love the stage sets and the opening credits; fabulous art work!

Betty is, of course, as wonderful as ever. MacDonald Carey lacks the charm of Betty's previous leading men. He doesn't dance and I think his singing is dubbed. Honestly, I think John Payne (who could sing and tries to dance a little) would've been a better choice. But, alas, he was long gone from Fox by 1951 and Fox's roster of stars by that time really lacked a good match for Betty.

There are several stand out musical numbers and the choreography is landmark to it's time period.

I've had CDs and records with the songs from this film for a long time. It's finally nice to hear the music in context with the film.

I must admit that I burst out laughing when a montage of Miami scenes and the song, ""Oh, me O My- ami"" came along in the middle of the film. It's the exact same montage and music from Betty's 1941 film, ""Moon Over Miami"". I guess that audiences of 1951 wouldn't have known the difference, since few people at that time had television sets and, of course, home video was still 30 years away. Unlike today, where you can compare the two films side by side, the audience had no idea that the same thing was used twice. Actually, I love finding the same set, lamp, backdrop, piece of furniture, stock footage, etc. used from Fox film to Fox film - it's a little bit like playing ""Where's Waldo"".",1367971200,5,1511,4.405017921146953
5682146,3,B00BY8DKJ0,"The Technicolor print is top-notch on this DVD. And the opening number is Betty Grable at her best with a gorgeous costume. And the Grable legs are there in all their glory. The story is silly, but it isn't an offensive musical. You have to be a true Grable fan though to really like it. MacDonald Carey was not the best partner for Grable in this one. And it's always good to see Gwen Verdon on the screen in her pre-Broadway days.",1367452800,3,432,4.280487804878049
5682147,3,B00BY8DKJ0,"Betty Grable began her long and wonderful career as
a chorus girl in Let's Go Places in 1930 at 20th Century Fox.
After bouncing around to different studios for ten years,
she was rediscovered by Fox and became a big star after the
release of Down Argentine Way 1940.

At that time, Alice Faye was the reigning queen at Fox.
Betty Grable would be her successor and a major star for the
next ten years. I believe Wabash Avenue 1950, is her last
great musical at Fox. The times were changing and Marilyn
Monroe would soon be Fox's biggest star.

Meet Me After The Show 1951, is a good Technicolor musical,
as long as it's not compared to her previous musicals of the 1940s.
Jack Cole's choreography adds some zip and style to a couple of
Betty Grable's numbers which would later inspire Monroe's iconic
Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend routine from Gentlemen Prefer
Blondes 1953.

Betty Grable was 35 at the time and, except for some unflattering
hairdos, she still is a very talented musical performer nearing
the end of a remarkable career. Unfortunately, Macdonald Carey and
Eddie Albert are not Don Ameche or John Payne, so it's up to Grable
to carry the whole show. Legendary Broadway star, Gwen Verdon
dances with Betty Grable in the last two musical numbers.

There are no dvd extras, but Fox did a great job with the color
and picture quality on this dvd.",1367193600,2,1362,4.592592592592593
5682148,4,B00BY8DKJ0,"Debbie Reynolds once said that her favorite Grable musical number was No Talent Joe from ""Meet Me After the Show.""  And she's probably right.  It not only shows off Betty's singing and dancing talents and her still-beautiful figure, but also her sense of humor.  In fact, this movie gives us one of Betty Grable's best comedic performances.

Her boss, Darryl F. Zanuck, promised her Cary Grant for her leading man, but delivered Macdonald Carey.  (Well, at least he got the Carey-part right.)  Carey plays her producer husband who is starring his wife in a Broadway musical.  When she discovers her husband in the arms of the show's backer, Gloria Carstads (Lois Andrews), Betty suddenly develops a case of amnesia and heads for the beach night club in Miami where Carey had discovered her.  Carey and her show's leading man, Eddie Albert, follow and find her reverting back to her roots as a honky-tonk singer with a stuffed polar bear (""It's a hot night in Alaska, you can feel the heat way down in Nebraska"").  Plus she's found a beachcomber (Rory Calhoun) who she's planning to run off with.

The musical numbers show off Betty at her best, including the opening title-song with some senior stage-door Johnnies, and the closing fun back-alley routine that segues into a formal ballroom ballet, I Feel Like Dancing, with Gwen Verdon who worked with Jack Cole on Grable's choreography.  (Verdon also backed Grable with the muscle bound Greek Gods in the No Talent Joe number.)  Unfortunately, before the picture was released in 1951, an elaborate number with Betty, Eddie and the chorus on skates by a pond on stage was cut from the film. But you can see them in costume taking their bows about 15 minutes into the movie.  (I was hoping this out-take would be included, but as with all DVD-Rs, there are no extras.)

If you like your musicals with a lot of laughs, this one's for you.  The Fox Cinema Archive's MOD print is gorgeous, just as you'd expect from a Betty Grable musical.",1367107200,16,1985,4.746355685131196
5682149,3,B00BY8DKJ0,"First off I have to say that FOX got it right this time.  This MOD is a beautful Technicolor print.  However, this is a silly Grable backstage vehicle bolstered by some terrific musical numbers choreographed by Jack Cole. Grable opens the film with a hot tap dance number partnered with Steve Condos and another male dancer.  Impressive too is the jazzy, unusual BETTIN ON A MAN sung by Grable and beautifully photographed, and NO TALENT JOE with an assist from Gwen Verdon. I FEEL LIKE DANCING with Grable and Verdon feels similiar to some of Cole's choreography from Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and Three for the Show. Apparently Jack Cole likes to use candleabra.  Julie Styne and Leo Robin wrote the score.  The beautful EVERYDAY IS LIKE A DAY IN MAYTIME sung by co-star MacDonald Carey is just thrown away. Its also used mostly as background music. Eddie Albert and Fred Clark co-star. I believe I spotted George Chakiris in the chorus of dancers.  The musical numbers certainly make this film worthwhile, that is why I rated it three stars.",1366934400,7,1043,4.798882681564246

8575503,4,B00BY8DKJ0,"I saw this movie on television when I was a kid. While I only had a vague memory of it, I decided to purchase the DVD. While not a Hall Of Fame-caliber picture, MEET ME AFTER THE SHOW is a very entertaining musical. Despite the trite plot (Broadway producer splits with his star wife, after being caught cheating; she is injured and gets (fake) amnesia; he is injured and gets (real) amnesia, but eventually they reconcile by the film's end), the movie has plenty of good moments, particularly Betty Grable's two showcase dance numbers - the tap number at the beginning of the film, set to the title song, featuring Grable with hoofers Steve Condos and Jerry Brandow; and the film's closing ballroom/jazz routine with a then little-known Gwen Verdon.

Interestingly, several of the film's supporting players went on to have big TV careers, including Macdonald Carey (DAYS OF OUR LIVES), Rory Calhoun (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Texan/dp/B001FRNB62/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Texan</a>, and several other series), and Irene Ryan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Beverly-Hillbillies/dp/B001NRPQKI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Beverly Hillbillies</a>).

Because it is formatted on a DVD-R, the disc has no extras. Three and a half to four stars.",1405123200,,1337,6.031578947368421
