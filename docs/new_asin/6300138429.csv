The story is cliched and the characters one-dimensional:  it's the hackneyed story of the most popular guy in school falling for the class tramp with a heart of gold.  The performances are its saving grace, as the actors are able to move the viewer.

208758,4,6300138429,"FURTHER UPDATE:

I found another distributor for a DVD-R copy of BUSTER AND BILLIE - It is Sunshine Vintage Movies.  I am sorry to report that the copy I received from them was obviously made from a very poor copy of the VHS tape - or, rather, it appeared really to look like a DVD copy of a slow-speed VHS copy of the original VHS tape.  It is a bit ""lighter"" than the RareMoviedvd.com product - but the picture is still terrible.  So, I guess we all will just have to wait until SONY (Columbia) will perhaps make a decent DVD of this film that many, many people want.

UPDATE ON REVIEW BELOW:

I did order a 12.99 DVD copy from RareMoviedvd.com. and received/reviewed it.  It is certainly a rather poor copy of the VHS tape; however, the settings used for the copy provide such a dark picture that much of the film is impossible to watch.  Any scene at night is almost a blank black picture.  I responded to RareMoviedvd.com on this problem and they said not better print was available - but they did take the disc back and did reimburse me for the disc.  Yeah, the swimming scene is watchable (for those of you who are interested) - but it is such a pity that a studio version (even a DVD-R version) is not available.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

This is more or less just a comment, not a review of the film.  ""Buster and Billy"" is a very moving film; one that should be seen by many more people than will see it due to its not being available for viewing.  Because of this, the pricing of over $150.00 for a VHS copy will warm the wallet of the owner of the ""one copy,"" but I would imagine that he or she will wait a bit for someone who will shell out that kind of cash for an old VHS copy.  Yes, supply and demand.  But this is a shame.

I do not know the quality of the  RareMoviedvd.com  DVD offering at their site for $12.99 plus shipping ($4.99 I believe) - but I would imagine it is a DVD copy from the VHS tape.  If done with any kind of professional equipment - the DVD should be an equal to the VHS tape - and is quite a bargain - not to say a wonderful find for those of us who have wanted a copy of Buster and Billy for years not ever being able to forget the film after seeing it.

I know many people who are interested in this film - and have been searching for it for years.  Studios should get on the ball.  I am surprised that the DVD-R issues from WB and 20th Century Fox aren't alerting other studios to finally distribute some very popular films for us all.

Well, not having $155.00 or more for this film - I did order a 12.99 DVD copy from RareMoviedvd.com.  I will be interested in just how good the print is - but at least I will have the film finally in some viewable format - and will keep looking for a long-awaited studio pressing.

Good luck to all of us who love the film.",1302048000,7,2796,4.121996303142329

208760,5,6300138429,"I remember seeing this film for the first time when it was first released, at the Center Theater in Fremont California.  The theater was packed with teenagers, and amazingly the audience was quiet throughout.  This film is excellent, a very touching love story.  The only time the audience catcalled was the scene of Buster and Billie swimming.  Jan Michael Vincent jumps into the water, with a full frontal nude scene (never seen before in a mainstream film) and the audience went wild, one girl yelling out ""I want some of that!"".  When the film ended and the credits were rolling, the song ""billies theme"" played, and I honestly got a lump in my throat and my eyes watered.  Such a beautiful song.  Many years later I found a brand new vhs copy in a bargain box at K Mart for $3.99.  I bought it and so glad that I did.

We watched it again the other evening,first time in years.  When the movie started with Billie's Theme, again I started to choke up and my eyes watered, and the movie just started!  Why this film was never released on DVD is beyond me.  It is timeless, and will always have a soft spot in my heart.

They can't take that away.",1292457600,7,1150,4.393364928909953

208762,5,6300138429,"I don't do too many reviews.  I don't bother at all with the worthless books and movie; I just trash them and move on.  However, there are some movies and books that can be watched or read again and again, and they are worth writing about.
Buster and Billie is such a movie.  I bring out my old video cassette and watch this movie every five years or so, and value the experience.  As a matter of fact, I just invested in a ""new"" copy because mine is wearing out.  Other reviewers have covered the plot fairly well, so I'll stick with the characters.  To me, Jan-Michael Vincent, Joan Goodfellow, and Robert Englundpeaked are exceptional in this movie.  This is perhaps a case where the part might as well have been written for the performer, with J-M Vincent's cockiness, Goodfellow's sweetness, and Englund's insecurity ringing about as true as anything you could see in a movie.
I hope it comes out on DVD.",1242172800,5,909,4.539877300613497
208763,5,6300138429,"I am not a great fan of 70's or 80's movies, but my sister is. She was very happy to get this one and she suggested me to watch it. What can I say- It was amazing how close to the truth it was. It tells one of those stories when sometimes in relationship love isn't enough preserve it. I once lived in small village in the country before my parents moved to the city and this movie amazingly close shows the environment in that village. How  young people feel in such town, prejudices of society and so on, and now when I am looking back and think how it was- living back there I find that it is quite easy to  imagine that such tragedy could have happened.  I am not fan of tragic stories or stories with bad ending, but there are movies which doesn't leave you alone for days or even weeks. And I must say this is one of the best movies ever. It has everything amazing plot, acting and good background music (I sometimes catch myself singing the song which was played at the beginning of the movie). Personally I think this movie is better than many awarded movies. for example, I had ten times better emotional experience from it than from many awarded drama movies, and actors here played at least three times better than in most awarded movies and unalike many awarded movies which I forget next day this movie made me think about it for weeks.
I must warn you although this rally is a masterpiece it is not for faint of heart, but if you want to watch a really good movie this is the one.",1201392000,6,1494,4.235087719298246

208765,4,6300138429,"This is a very good movie that I saw a long time ago on TV back in the mid to late 70's. I finally found a copy which wasn't easy or cheap at the time because it was out of print. The movie still holds up. It is a great story that takes place in the 40's or early 50's. Buster (Jan Michael-Vincent) is the most popular boy in school and a jock. He has a gang of buddies that he drinks with and carouses with. He also dates the school beauty who and does all the right things. His girl friend though is kind of frigid and won't let him have sex with her until they are married. Billy is a girl who lives out in the boondocks with her semi crazy or mentally challenged parents. She has nothing and is dirt poor. She is incredibly backward and shy and the boys of Busters gang use her for sex which she goes along with because it is the only way she is accepted. They ask Buster to go along with them to Billys but he never does because he finds the whole group thing distasteful and he has a girl friend and it would be wrong. But being sexually frustrated and young he goes to Billys by himself one night without telling anybody and takes her for a ride in his truck. They have sex and he begins to see her more and more often and actually falls in love with her. The reprecussions from the community and the scorn thrown his way bring Buster and Billy even closer.

This is a story of young love and loss. It is a very emotional tail and a very good one. If you can find a copy on VHS its worth it if you can afford it. This is a largely forgotten movie and should be out on DVD. This movie also has some sexual content which is very tastefully done and also some very violent content that is kind of disturbing.",1137628800,33,1712,4.020527859237537

208776,4,6300138429,"Buster and Billie was one of the best little movies of its decade. Jan Michael Vincent showed that he wasn't just a pretty face in this film as he plays a half wild country boy who grows up and separates  himself from his old buddies when he falls in love with Billie. Billie is scorned by the girls in town and used for sex by the boys. This girl doesn't just come from the wrong side of the tracks she and  her family are considered to be nothing more than the town's trash. And then something beautiful happens. Buster's love changes her and makes her believe that she actually deserves a little happiness.

This is something of a Romeo and Juliet story only instead of two feuding families keeping the lovers apart it's the whole town and its hypocracy and snobbery. It's been years but I've never forgotten the final scene in the movie where Buster rebels and gets his girlfriend the flowers she deserves while the theme song plays.",1130284800,9,937,4.5

208779,5,6300138429,"(Story takes place in Georgia 1948) Very touching bittersweet love story. [...]Beg, barrow or steal it and watch it as I wouldn't want to spoil it for you.

I recommend seeing this movie in one sitting because it is a movie that slowly builds your feelings for the characters which will impact you more at the end of the movie.

Buster Lane (Jan-Michael Vincent) is a typical country boy with maybe a little more scruples then the average southern country poke. Buster is engaged to be married to Margie (Pamela Sue Martin) in the upcoming June and he has been playing touchy feely with her but she wants to wait until they're married to have intercourse. Buster's main friend is Whitey (Robert Englund--""Freddy Krueger"") and they hangout and drink beers together and take a trip to the ocean and we get an idea where Buster's friends minds and morals are at and this suffices as the story comes to a close later in the movie. I little more about these friends in the next paragraph.

In the meantime Billie (Joan Goodfellow) who is a very very shy country girl from a very poor family has been having sex with several of Buster's friends in a way of getting some attention. You are never made to feel anything but compassion for Billie, you never think of her as a [...]. Her performance radiates innocents and loneliness and sadness and then joy and happiness later in the movie, you can feel all her feelings as the movie progresses.

When Buster can't holdout any longer for sex with Margie his attentions turn to Billie and are not honorable at first. He finds her to be very very innocent and sees the beauty in her and finds himself falling in love but is not sure of his feelings reflecting his own youth and lack of experience to this new feeling called love.

Before Buster even realized what his feelings are he acts on his basic instinct and feelings and breaks off his relationship with Margie and is seeing Billie exclusively. You feel their new found love and see it as a rosebud just beginning to form. Billie is taken to her first movie with Buster to see a Tarzan movie, and you can see her elated joy at this new experience. When Billie and Buster go swimming Buster looks over at her to see if she is taking off all her clothes before he strips to the bare-ass as if to not offend her. It's little moments like this throughout the movie that all add up. The getting up in the middle of the night and waiting for the sun to show itself at the horizon and they jump up and down and then hold each other in a very very loving manner is touching as well. There are exchanges of gifts to one another and they both realize they love one another. Billie is taken to a dance with Buster and you again feel her joy. Billie is lit up like a Christmas tree by this time and you can actually feel her and his joy and happiness. but especially hers.

Meanwhile back at the ranch, the boys that were getting laid by Billie before her self-esteem got elevated by her new love comes for some more poontang. Of course Billie resist and fights back but is beaten, raped and killed by these boys.

Buster finds her body shortly after the killing and ends up killing two of the boys who had the evidence literally written on their faces. Buster is released from jail just after Billie's funeral and she was buried with only Buster's parents and the preacher being present, her parents weren't even there. The movie closes with the opening song and you get a big lump in your throat in the closing scene at the cemetery with Buster at Billie's graveside.

I have seen reviews that see this movie as a sweet movie that turns into a sadistic mean spirited movie and was rated as a poor to fair movie because of it. I do not subscribe to this view. We live in a world where ugly things happen every day. We can be sure of two things, it was inevitable that these boys were going to come back for more poontang and that she would refuse them. I'm not sure how else this outcome might be played out. I suppose she could have been assaulted and then just told Buster about it and he could deal with it in a nonviolent manner. We all like happy endings and I love a good Cinderella story as much as anyone. American Beauty is a great movie and didn't end on a very happy note for the main character either, but these same reviewers don't knock that, go figure?

Bottom line is this is one of my favorite movies. I seen it at a drive-in movie theater as the second feature back in 1974 when it was released and just bought a copy last month from an e-bay seller. It was sweeter then I remembered from 26 years ago. Joan Goodfellow doesn't seem to have done any visible acting since 1984. She gives one very sweet performance in this movie. I give Joans performance an 11 and the movie a 10. This movie will always have a soft spot in my heart.",1105833600,58,4834,4.362222222222222

Saw it as a small kid and never forgot the film; it has a memorable theme song, fab actors and beautiful scenery. It's one of those coming of age movies that did everything right. Film depicts the brutal reality of adolescent savagery, peer pressure and social class where church going young men can behave despicably esp in their treatment of girls.

Dialogue was refreshingly minimal, acting was spot on and the theme song, beautiful in its simplicity. The heartwarming and then heart wrenching sequence of events in rural Georgia 1948 follow the unfortunate predicament of a backwoods girl lacking in both family love -and the self respect derived from an inclusive and protective bond.

Definitely a movie you will not forget. Wonder whether actors in older movies such as this ever ck out amazon reviews of their earlier work. If so, they will be very pleased at how well their performances in this movie are still regarded and have withstood the test of time.

I had forgotten part of the film and had reviewed it when it was in theaters. I have tried, repeatedly, to get the Studio to put it on DVD...but they know nothing about older movies. And I guess nobody remembers Jan-Michael Vincent nowadays. In his youth, before his pot busts....growing it and being arrested, he had a fantastic career with his looks and talent. I was the sole reporter at the court when he was tried for growing pot at his home. His agent, Dick Clayton, who was James Dean's Hollywood agent, discovered Jan and was disappointed that he was hooked on pot and his TV series suffered from it too. But, this film should be on DVD for anyone who remembers him. It should be widescreen and 5.1 sound for all of us collectors to buy. The VHS copies could be transferred but these people who have it, think they have a goldmine with their prices.

I sent my copy to the Studio to trace down whomever put it out overseas. Warner Bros. claimed they never received it. Whomever opened the box now has it in their collection. Most of the pirated movies are stolen from the Studios and the place that has the films in 35mm, that sends them to theaters, like Technicolor.
