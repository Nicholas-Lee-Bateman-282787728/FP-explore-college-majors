4854369,1,B005OQS8EU,"It's little wonder this particular dvd has received no reviews on Amazon thus far. It's dreadful. The ""product description"" promises a story of a weekend after which the characters lives will be changed forever. Plot is simple. Verow hires a hustler to spend a weekend with him and then films their multiple sex acts. Other than a series of hand held camera close ups (many out of focus), that's it. If you want well made gay pornography, than buy it. Don't waste your time on this pretentious vanity project.",1337385600,3,509,4.730337078651686

8481686,4,B005OQS8EU,"Leave Blank is the kind of movie that is only going to appeal to a specific audience.  Yes, it has explicit, non-simulated sex in it, but you're going to have to be the kind of viewer who can get beyond that and also accept that it's not particularly ""sexy"" sex, and it's not meant to be.  It's meant to be a part of the narrative, which is quite simple, for the most part.

Looking over some of the other reviews, it seems the people who don't like this film break down into two groups--those who had different expectations around the sex scenes within the film and those who were looking more for a ""novel"" when what they are getting is really the character sketch scenario of a short story.

Verow's premise is pretty simple--the main character (Todd, played by Verow), hires a hustler named Paul (played by former real-life escort and current gay porn actor Gregg Tucker, AKA Sean Storm) for a weekend tryst in a hotel.  For $2000, Todd wants to try everything he's never done in his life.  He plans to film it all as a document for later.

Within about five minutes of arriving at the room, Todd and Paul have sex on camera.  It's not a porn scene.  It's more of the real-world vision of how sex works for strangers who've just met in hotel rooms--it's a bit awkward, not particularly sexy to watch, looks like it's more or less fun for both of them, but not something you'd normally catch on video and sell in a sex shop.  The men spend most of the weekend in the hotel room in various states of (un)dress.  In between rounds of sex, they have long conversations that seem pretty much in line with what people who've just met each other and are sharing sex as a business transaction would be likely to talk about.  They also shower, use the toilet, and get room service.

In the supplemental features, Verow and Tucker reveal about 80% of the script was improvised, which lends a certain degree of realism to the scenes, which tend to consist of long takes with occasional straight cuts from one moment to the next.  This isn't a big-budget, fancy cinematic affair.  This is more-or-less guerrilla-style film making with an off-the-cuff approach to the development of characters and plot.  Verow seems to be pushing the bounds of reality's intrusion into a filmic narrative.  We watch ""found footage"" films with the pretense of reality pasted onto standard horror movie plots.  Verow attempts to apply those principles to something a bit more visceral and real-world in its scope.  Without giving spoilers, this is a a narrative about two people in a rather awkwardly intimate, claustrophobic situation.  As such, it fulfills those parameters perfectly.

But does it work as a film?  The answer is ""kind of.""  If you're not into dialogue-driven character pieces with little to no action beyond the ""action"" the two characters engage in, then this is not the perfect film for you.  Most mainstream movie goers are going to find it to be slow moving, and a bulk of them will not allow themselves to get beyond the sex scenes in order to engage the actual narrative.  The more salacious viewer is going to be disappointed that the sex isn't titillating or particularly ""well-filmed"" by the standards established in regular pornography.  The lighting is flat, the shots are static, and the sex is basically the kind of sex that people are having in the privacy of their own homes on a daily basis.  The ""fantasy factor"" that informs pornography is avoided in this.  Even though the two men themselves are attractive (Tucker's main profession, after all, is making pornography for a living, and Verow, while not likely to make the crossover to Tucker's workplace any time soon, has a well-cared for physique and rather...uh...substantial attribute that would be a decided advantage in that line of work), these aren't the kinds of scenes that form the basis for fantasy.

The technical level is where this film does fall a bit short.  Verow has made something of a reputation on his work in low-tech film making, which is admirable in what he is able to accomplish with what little he utilizes.  But, it also makes for scenes that can become a bit tedious to watch in terms of dynamic camera work (of which there is almost none), effective lighting (also none), and sound design, which is pretty poor and occasionally difficult to discern the content of the dialogue, which is problematic in making the case for the film as a character-driven piece.  How do you have a character-driven narrative when the dialogue between the two characters is frequently almost inaudible?

That said, the film is a definite must see for fans of more independent oriented film making, from a time when ""independent films"" weren't drawing in A-list actors and mimicking Hollywood films with a less-pretty cast.  It may be more advisable as a rental for those who still aren't sure if it's a good match for them.  But if you can't get beyond the sex scenes, then you might as well not bother, though you're missing out.",1434844800,5,5001,4.722350230414746

His films are always original and provocative, and in a world filled with the mundane or shock value for the sheer sake of shock value, his movies stand alone.
