4484968,5,B004W2OKUI,"Last year my then 3 year old daughter became acquainted with Liz Vacco at preschool. Liz taught a weekly ""movement"" class at the preschool every Wednesday for a whole year! It was the highlight of my daughter's week. Because the class was rather large, only half the children at a time would have their session with Liz while the other half engaged in other classroom activities, and then they would switch. But when it wasn't her turn with Liz, my daughter would pull up a chair and watch Liz and the other kids go through their movement routines with complete amusement and interest. She brought the games and routines home and had her younger sister and me playing ""Dolls on a Shelf"" for hours. So when Liz announced she was moving to California, I bought Petite Feet so my girls could continue to enjoy story-telling movement and dance with Liz.

The great thing about Petite Feet is that Liz weaves story telling appropriate for preschoolers with accompanying dance, movement and stretching. So kids are not just learning movements, but are actors in a play. The songs Liz has composed for the stories are simple but catchy, and I sometimes hear my girls singing the melodies as they go about their day. I love seeing them sit together on the living room floor moving through the stretches and routines, and it's always a welcome break for me to be able to get stuff done around the house without putting them in front of the TV. The other nice thing for us was that the video reinforced what they were learning in their ballet class over the summer in between classes. I bought an extra copy to give as a birthday gift, and will look forward to Liz' next video.",1315785600,,1667,4.593959731543624
4484969,5,B004W2OKUI,"My 4 year old daughter just LOVES this video and has learned so much more actual dance than she ever did in her traditional ballet class. Liz offers a great mix of music, instruction and play - perfect for the aspiring ballerina. Plus, it has the added bonus of not having any drama in it, like Angelina Ballerina! No crying and moping here- just flying elephants! You'll see...!",1315785600,,379,4.588235294117647
4484970,5,B004W2OKUI,"This dvd is adorable!
Liz is a fabulous teacher who uses stories and songs to teach children ballet. I will gift this dvd to every child under 6 that I know!",1313280000,,157,4.096774193548387
4484971,5,B004W2OKUI,"I have bought a bunch of ballett DVDs for my almost 3 year old daughter, but this one is by far our favorite. It's playful enough to keep her engaged the entire time, not too fast or too rigid. Still, she has learned many ballett terms and has made real progress following the exercises and dance stories. I am hoping to see more Petite Feet DVDs coming out soon! We'll definitely buy them all.",1312848000,6,394,4.337837837837838
4484972,5,B004W2OKUI,"Not only does my 3 year old enjoy this video, it is quite possibly her favorite thing EVER. In the first two days of having it she pleaded to watch it over and over - and I succumbed (7 times in fact) because she was having such a blast and getting so much exercise!

I don't feel so bad about the (usually prohibited) hours of video watching because she is moving the whole time, completely engaged. It is designed so well with simple exercises, memorable songs and captivating stories, there is so much room for imagination - she doesn't just follow the instructions, she keeps making up her own parts. She got all her dolls out for the magic doll dust, she plays the piano with Waldo, she made a meadow of blankets to dance on....And she is really learning all the ballet vocabulary (words and movements).

It's a BRILLIANT video - one of the very best videos for kids I've seen, educational or otherwise.",1312675200,14,908,4.496969696969697
4484973,5,B004W2OKUI,"Liz Vacco's Petite Feet DVD is a wonderful gift if you have an aspiring ballerina in your house!  My four-year-old daughter, Helena, just started ballet class and she loves watching this DVD and practicing all her steps and also escaping into Vacco's creative, imaginative, and playful world.  As a mom, I really loved that the DVD was enforcing the lessons she learned in her ballet class and using the proper language for the movements, but more importantly, the DVD allows the child to escape into a playful, imaginative world while learning to love dance.  My one-year-old daughter also loves to watch her sister and mimic all the movements on the DVD.  Excellent gift to give if you know a little girl or boy just beginning to love dance.",1312675200,7,743,4.78125

4484980,5,B004W2OKUI,"My girls like this a lot. It's their favorite ballet video of the 3 we have. Liz makes the moves fun and easy to understand for kids. I also like that it includes not just a choreographed dance, but more similar to an actual ballet where it tells a little story.

For this age, I think I prefer this over going to classes. It's definitely worth it. And a fun introduction to ballet.",1449446400,,293,4.345454545454546
4484996,5,B004W2OKUI,My 3 year old LOVES this video. I have tried numerous DVDs to try to keep her active on days we are stuck inside. Both Ballet with Liz DVDs are the only ones that have stuck so far.  She brings me the DVDs and asks to do them. She follows along through both of them and sings along. It also definitely helped make her more comfortable in a dance class at a local studio. I just wish there were more of these DVDs!,1449100800,,413,3.9759036144578315

4484998,5,B004W2OKUI,"We LOVE this video in our house. We are a military family that moves around a lot so even though our daughter had to say goodbye to her ballet teacher we had at our last base, she got to bring Liz along to her new one.  We just adore this video, even I like it and don't mind hearing it played 1000 times! Just ordered the second dvd..",1446595200,,335,3.926470588235294

4485000,3,B004W2OKUI,"For the price, I expected it to be better and longer.  Seems like a good, engaging teacher, if you're in the room with her.  My main beef is with the camera angles. It zooms in too close frequently, sometimes to the point that she dances from outside the screen on one side over to the outside of the opposite side. While you're trying to follow along, it's hard to know what your entire body is supposed to be doing when you can only see a small portion of her. However, I suppose if you're 4, you're just flailing your arms around like the little ones in the video.  I bought this not only for my daughter, but to learn myself, so I could help her with the moves she learns in her weekly dance class.",1445904000,3,702,4.185185185185185
4485001,5,B004W2OKUI,"I ordered this DVD on Amazon after reading all the excellent reviews, and I'm so glad I did! It prepared my young daughter before her first ballet class. She was so into the DVD and asked to watch it over and over again! She prefers to watch this over Disney princess movies at times. She sings the songs, and practices the positions from this DVD, and has fun doing it! I was truly impressed with the teacher, and the quality.",1445817600,3,427,4.35
4485002,5,B004W2OKUI,"My 4 year old daughter loves it, as well as her 3 year old sister. Even fun for mom to do it with them ;) Great alternative to enrolling them in lessons!",1444953600,,153,3.8125

4485004,5,B004W2OKUI,"My 3-year-old LOVES this DVD!  She asks for it all the time, many times in a row.  My oldest daughter was lucky enough to take her very first ballet class with Liz in NYC and Liz inspired her love of dance that continues 7 years later.  I can't do this for my youngest daughter, so the DVD is the next best thing.  Liz is a wonderful teacher - I wish more early childhood ballet teachers used her techniques.",1441238400,2,408,4.1923076923076925
4485005,1,B004W2OKUI,This CD has only one activity... It's a complete waste of time.,1437868800,,63,4.333333333333333
4485006,5,B004W2OKUI,"Bought this DVD and another locally produced (Australia) dance dvd for my twin daughters to explore their interest in dance.  This one has been played many times a week, and stimulates a lot of imaginative play at other times too.  My only 'complaint' is that I had to get it shipped to a friend in the UK and then posted onto me because it can't ship directly to Australia!!",1436140800,,375,4.420289855072464
4485007,4,B004W2OKUI,"So, I wanted to see if my daughter would be interested in ballet without shelling out a ton of money on classes. I checked out some videos from the library and they were boring, poor quality (outdated) and too dry. I looked at Amazon Instant Video and didn't like the selection there until I found Petite Feet. I was searching for something that would hold her attention, be entertaining and teach ballet. Liz is engaging and teaches through song and repetition. So why only 4 stars? I wish there was more than one scene on the disc.  Price is a little high for such a short movie ~ $20 for 20 minutes of viewing. So like some of the other  reviewers, it gets repeated.",1435622400,4,669,4.387096774193548
4485008,5,B004W2OKUI,"I originally rented Petite Feet from Amazon streaming on the 3rd day of a rainstorm that wouldn't leave. I was out of ideas of fun, active things for my then 3yr old to do inside, so I thought a ballet video might keep her occupied for a morning. I got MUCH more than I bargained for!

Petite Feet was made with high quality production, the kids are cute, Liz is likable and engaging, and your kid will actually LEARN from this video.

My daughter had been in ballet for close to a year when we first rented Petite Feet, but knew next to nothing about the fundamental movements or their names. I put it on, and she liked it so much that she demanded it be played on repeat until lunch (and I am still unable to show it without at least 1 encore presentation nearly 2 years later). After that first day, she not only started discussing movements by name, but she also became more body aware while practicing them. And she became OBSESSED with ballet.

Our kitchen became her dance studio. She's spent countless hours practicing movements (and singing the Perite Feet songs) between the pantry and kitchen table. She started inviting her little sister to dance with her and helping her say the names and learn the movements, too.

I've watched her abilities flourish (despite stopping the studio lessons and not starting with a new one because I have yet to find one that's ""as good as Petite Feet, Mom"") and a real love of dance take hold in her. The same is happening with my 2.5yr old. What an awesome, awesome gift from what I thought was just a clever way to survive a rainy day.

A big thanks to Liz for sharing her gift for teaching dance with kids outside of her studio. Petite Feet has truly unlocked my daughters' dancer hearts - how many 5 and 2.5yr olds request to watch the Royal Ballet of Swan Lake and refer to themselves as Odette?!?

If you have a little dancer or just a kid that needs something fun to do on occasion, you need Petite Feet. (And Petite Feet 2 is just as good!)",1435622400,10,1993,4.387533875338754

4485011,5,B004W2OKUI,"She requests it every day, and would watch it on loop if I let her ;) She's also really picking up the dance steps, and integrating them into her own dances. Also, it gives me a nice 30 minute break ;) Love it!",1428710400,,210,3.9069767441860463
4485012,5,B004W2OKUI,My daughter just turned 4 and loves this video! She wants to take a ballet class but we didn't sign up this winter. I bought this to hold her over and it was a huge hit! She sings the songs and shows me the different ballet positions. I purchased a few ballet videos and the Petite Feet are the only ones she is interested in.,1427155200,,326,4.030769230769231
4485013,5,B004W2OKUI,"My young daughters (ages 2 and almost 4) LOVE Petite Feet. Liz Vacco is clearly knows her audience and is a terrific teacher. She teaches through song and repetition and truly makes learning ballet an engaging & fun experience. I borrowed a couple other DVDs from the library that aimed to teach ballet to young children, but they were very dry compared to Petite Feet. I wish my girls could take weekly face-to-face classes with Liz, but as it is they enjoy participating along with the DVD almost daily.",1427155200,,505,4.685393258426966
4485014,5,B004W2OKUI,Amazing video! I fell in love with the instructor instantly. She sings cute songs for the kids to relate to as her way for the kids to comprehend how to do the warm up exercises and dance moves.

4485016,5,B004W2OKUI,"This video is a lot better than, Baby Ballet. Liz goes slowly in her instructions to give kids plenty of time to adjust. My daughter loves it. Waldo is random, but doesn't hurt anyone.",1421280000,,184,4.4411764705882355

4485018,5,B004W2OKUI,"I love it. I have a just turned 3 little girl. She can focus enough through about half of it before she gets a little bored. But when she's really paying attention, she's doing what they do and enjoying what's going on. I think if she was a little older, maybe 3.5 or 4, she'd have it down pat. I definitely recommend. And I love how there are kids of different ages and ability levels doing it with Liz!",1419897600,,404,4.1265822784810124

4485020,5,B004W2OKUI,"My ballet loving toddler loves this. I enjoy that it is informative, using correct terminology. It is easy for my two year old to follow, but my 5 year old also really enjoys it. The way the activities are presented in an interactive way that make it really fun to participate and engaging.

My one gripe is that there is only one session on the disc, which is about 20 minutes long. For the price I wish there was a little more. Also, my children love this and it would be wonderful to have another installment so they can learn some new movements and activities.",1418169600,,564,4.371428571428571

4485023,5,B004W2OKUI,"All of the dance steps to be learned, even the stretches, are creatively introduced through stories.  Pure genius.  My kids love it.  Liz does tell the kids the names of many of the moves as well, so it is educational for sure.  She is very likable in this video.  The music is catchy, in a good way.  We sing some of the songs around the house, even when the video is over.  So well done.

The only thing I did not care for was magic references in some of her stories, but magic is in a lot of kids cartoons these days.  She does not over do it by any means, just uses fairy dust to bring the toys in the stories to life.  It's all in good fun in this video.",1414022400,,659,3.9242424242424243

I love her approachit is kind, thoughtful, motivating, engaging and delightful. Her dance and story-telling were considerate for the ages of her audience and they had FUN doing it. I LOVE this DVD. Keep up the good work and lets see MORE!!! (Waldo I'm not too fond of; you can tell that it's not him playing the music on the piano, but that's okay because...its for kids!

it isn't a high budget production, just simple singing, dancing, to piano. I find this is a plus as other childrens shows can make my little one hyper active. she gets up and dances to this so this is great for keeping her moving around as well.",1385856000,2,307,4.133333333333334
4485038,5,B004W2OKUI,"This is the most charming dvd for children.  The first time I put it in, my 3 year old daughter and 5 year old autistic son were involved in seconds and demanded to do it twice in a row.  Four months later we still use it a couple of times a week, they still love it, and it's a huge hit for playdates.  The neighbor kids love to have ""ballet class"" at our house.  Liz is adorable, inspiring, and imaginative.  The music is great and not annoying for adults.  Sweet, innocent, and decent exercise on a rainy day.  Very professionally done.  We can't afford to put the kids in local ballet classes, but I feel that this is an wonderful substitute.  With my son, he would be too stressed in a strange environment with a lot of other kids, and this dvd allows him to work on his balance, coordination, and sense of rhythm in his comfort zone, and also at whatever time of day he is feeling energetic.  We tried a couple of other childrens ballet videos by other teachers, they were just unbelievably awful in comparison to Petit Feet, we sent those right back.  I will buy as many more as Liz will make.  PLEASE make more Liz!!!!!",1384214400,,1127,4.314285714285714

So I bought this for them to do ballet at home. They love it and are so cute when they follow along. They have had it for a few months and still love it. Just yesterday my 2 yr old said, ""Mommy I want my piques movie."" My 4 year old also tells me she wants to go to ""that"" ballet school. Too bad we live in Key West. I tell her we are too far away to go there. Great dvd though totally worth the price.",1381190400,,559,3.5901639344262297

4485042,5,B004W2OKUI,"My daughter really wanted to join a ballet class, but is under 3, the age most ballet classes begin, so we got her this DVD to dance with at home. She was into it from the very beginning, even with her short attention span.  Vacco's ability to teach and communicate with enough clarity and enthusiasm to capture and retain a toddler's attention is impressive. My daughter often requests the ""ballet movie"" and enjoys dancing along.",1380672000,,431,4.746666666666667
4485043,5,B004W2OKUI,"I bought this for my 23 month old daughter.  She loves it and says ""more"" as soon as the credits start to roll.  The first couple of times I did it with her but now she will follow along on her own.  I really enjoyed that the camera focused on the instructor but also included the children in the video.  Sometimes when children are the instructors on other videos or classes it can be cute but harder to follow along.  My daughter really enjoys the songs that go along with the dancing.  Also, the instructor teaches the correct ballet terminology but doesn't overwhelm the children with it  either.  I love to hear my almost 2 year old saying ""adagio"" and ""plie'"".  I bought this for my daughter because she was too young for classes where we live but always running around on her tippy toes!  I would definitely buy again.",1380585600,,825,4.44
4485044,5,B004W2OKUI,"I looked at several Kids Ballet videos to supplement classes for my 3 and 5 year olds girls.  This was the best. Other videos were either very boring for small children (all educational) or just a lot of jumping around (did not teach ballet positions and terms). My girls enjoy this video and I feel it is reinforcing what they are learning in class. They oftern ask to watch ""Petite Feet With Liz"".",1380585600,,399,4.465753424657534

She loves it.",1369094400,,306,4.472727272727273
4485050,5,B004W2OKUI,"After having enrolled my three-year-old daughter in classes with Liz, I was enchanted and enlightened by the creativity, charm and basic dance technique in ballet and interpretative movement that her classes feature.  A loving and creative person herself, Liz has helped my daughter to explore her creative and dance-loving side, as well as discover interpretive movements linked to Liz's storytelling portion of class, that draw on the right brain so that the dance experience is not routine and rote.  Music and ballet terminology is introduced throughout, such as ""allegro"", ""adagio"", plie and soute (spelling?) to get little minds working and learning.

We bought the DVD after having watched it with a mom friend of mine who purchased it for her toddler.  Knowing we could pop the DVD into the player at home and put on a tutu dress or leotard and tights (sans slippers is fine!), and practice along with Liz, the walrus pianist Waldo, and her inspired students, was well worth the small investment in the DVD.  At 26 minutes in length, it is perfect for the shorter attention span of some toddlers/little ones.  I highly recommend this DVD to any parent who would like to have creativity, freedom of movement and basic ballet techniques introduced/built upon by an excellent, knowledgeable instructor.  Brava, Liz!",1366588800,,1320,5.111627906976744
4485051,5,B004W2OKUI,"I am very picky about what I let my children watch on tv.  Usually I stick to educational DVDs like the preschool prep company series.  But when my 2 year old daughter showed an interest in dance, I searched and read reviews on videos appropriate for her age.  I have purchased other children's DVDs and been very disappointed and amazed at so many positive reviews.  Sometimes they go straight to the trash because I don't want my kids eyes watching the jumpy animation.  This video is exactly what I was looking for and best of all, my daughter LOVES it.  At first she just watched mesmerized, but after a few times I got down on the floor and started following along with the class.  Then my daughter followed along too.  No, she's not very good at just 26 months old, but it is adorable watching her try.  I like the music, the simple dance steps and the length of the DVD.  Liz is just awesome!  I have 2 other ballet DVDs and this one far surpasses the others in every way.  Even my 3 1/2 year old son likes to dance along with it...although not nearly as gracefully.

We couldn't take our usual ballet class this Winter, so I bought Petite Feet for my daughter to practice at home.  She loves it.  She takes out the DVD, puts it in the player, and then goes to her room to get her leotard, tights, and ballet slippers.  She doesn't pay attention the whole time, unless I'm participating as well, but that's 3-year-old behavior.  I think the video is great for this age.  I'm holding back a half star because I wish there was one DVD with a few different versions of the class. I need a little variety (even though my daughter probably doesn't.) I also wish there were levels of learning - this is a great intro, and that's why I wish there were ways to advance with this story/playful technique.  I'm very happy with the purchase.",1365120000,2,840,4.352564102564102

He dances along with his sister. They both love it and I'm sure they will love to have the full version on DVD. It is an great ballet dvd for the smallest one.

This DVD is a perfect way to let her dance at home. She loves the littles stories and sings the songs all day. Her two year old brother likes to participate as well. The DVD exists only in English, but even if my kids are Dutch- French and don't speak English, that doesn't seem to bother them. The way the moves are shown is very clear.

4485056,5,B004W2OKUI,"My little girl is obsessed with ballet! She wanted to take ballet lessons but couldn't join the class until she was 3. I searched and searched for a Ballet DVD that would be enjoyable for her. When I came across this one I thought it looked interesting so we we rented on Amazon. We rented it 3 more times until the DVD arrived to us in Japan. My daughter loves it! She adores Ms. Liz and all of the wonderful songs and dances. She walks around the house singing ""you put your toes in the toaster and you flegs (flex) and point"" and all the other songs too. She even has started making up her own ballet story similar to the one in the video. She has now started taking classes but still loves to watch Ms. Liz and I feel she has learned more from the DVD than from the class. I hope that Ms. Liz will make many more DVDs with ballet adventures. My daughter adores you and my husband and I have just as much fun dancing along with her. She says ""Come on Daddy dance with me and Ms. Liz!"" Thank you Ms. Liz for bringing such fun into our home!",1351468800,,1042,4.087804878048781
4485057,5,B004W2OKUI,"As a special educator for very young children, I do not recommend many videos for kids--especially those under the age of 5.  As a mother of toddler twins, I'm still not big on videos.

This is the exception.

The pace is absolutely perfect for young children.  Liz mixes in fast and slow movements in such a way as to keep kids interested, yet does the class overall with explanations and demonstrations that are easy for little ones to follow along.  The music is simple and not distracting, matches the lesson, and is fun to dance to.  Even the set is refreshing--unlike so many other ""kid"" shows out there, there are no flashing lights and computerized jibberish in the background.  Instead, a simple, colorful backdrop of a sky with rainbows and clouds that does not distract, but rather creates a soothing and comfortable place to play.

As a teacher, I'm amazed at how Liz is able to construct a dance lesson that is so developmentally appropriate for even my two-year-olds.  The gross motor skills of dance are paired beautifully with simple songs that aid in remembering the steps of the lesson.  But what I love the most, as both teacher and mother, is the sheer creativity in which she goes through stretches and the introduction of some basic ballet moves.  Incredibly imaginative and engaging!  I also love that Liz lets the kids dancing with her be kids--the focus is on exploration and enjoying the class, and not on being perfect.

As a mom, I sit and smile at my daughter and son as they go through all the movements, answer Liz as she asks questions or gives other ""interactive"" prompts, and generally have a fabulous time getting up and moving to some music we all enjoy.  We've tried some dance classes for tots locally, and even being in an actual class with other kids has not been as positive an experience as this video has!  I wish, wish, wish we lived near to Liz to take her actual classes, but this video is a great substitute...and we hope to see more very soon!

We first found this by renting it on Amazon, but the kids asked for it so much it became apparent we needed to simply buy it outright.  It's well worth the couple of bucks to rent and see how much your own kids will love it!  I highly, highly recommend it.",1348617600,,2249,4.538461538461538
