8301279,5,B001F89SU4,"This DVD adds the dimension of video to the stunning quality of Lily Afshar's virtuosity.  Allowing your eyes to drink in the emotion evoked by the artist's eyes and facial expressions only enhances the quality of the musical experience.  Two other reviewers have done an outstanding job of chronicling the contents of the DVD, so I do not need to go there.  What I do need to do is encourage you to invest in this amazing collection of performances and enjoy!",1422144000,,460,4.654320987654321
8301280,5,B001F89SU4,"The title ""Virtuoso Guitar"" is no exaggeration for Lily Afshar's incredible DVD. While Dr. Afshar's flawless playing puts her in the top echelon of classical guitarists today, the amazing breadth of her repertoire puts her in a class of her own. On this DVD we get performances of both old and newly-composed pieces from Iran, Turkey, Italy, Spain, Cuba, and Argentina. While few guitarists are even aware of the musical traditions of these different countries, Lily Afshar demonstrates a deep understanding and personal interpretation of every one of the eight selections she performs.

An unexpected bonus on the DVD is Lily Afshar's detailed comments on each of the pieces played. This background enhances the enjoyment of each piece, and introduces us to the various musical traditions represented here. The most fascinating background is that of the 24 Caprichos de Goya, Op. 195 by Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco, which was the subject of Lily Afshar's doctoral thesis. This work was proclaimed by Segovia as probably the greatest work for classical guitar of the 20th century, and yet he died before being able to play it. While impossible to say, it seems unlikely that he could have played it any better than Dr. Afshar's stunning performance here. Her seemingly effortless virtuosity is matched by her most sensitive interpretation.

Of special note are the Five Popular Persian Ballads arranged by Lily Afshar. These have a special beauty that gets better each time you listen. Guitarists will be happy to learn that the music to this set has been published at a very reasonable price. You can buy them from Amazon.com or directly from Mel Bay.

Aside from the wealth of music performed, this DVD is a gold mine of information for guitarists. I have to say the Lily Afshar has the most perfect hand position I have ever seen. Her movements are precise, concise, and efficient in both left and right hands. It is nothing less than spectacular to see her right hand thumb pick out a melody on the same strings that her other fingers are executing a tremolando without interrupting the flow of either! This is just one of the many spots that will have you rewinding to check if your eyes were deceiving you.

The most pressing reason to buy this DVD is to see Lily Afshar play. While her CD's are excellent representations of her talent, seeing her perform is an unforgettable experience. It is particularly enthralling to see how she plays the fretlets on the guitar neck, and to realize the precision that it takes to hit them correctly at speed, a feat that Dr. Afshar performs repeatedly and flawlessly.

Any classical guitarist simply must have this DVD. It will also be of great interest to anyone interested in fingerstyle guitar or world music, or anyone who enjoys great playing of fascinating music. This review is from [...]",1280448000,6,2838,4.928870292887029
8301281,5,B001F89SU4,"I've followed Lily Afshar's career since the early 1990s and the Virtuoso Guitar DVD is a welcome addition and a great buy for anyone interested in the musician's art.

The contents of the DVD provide a well rounded view into Afshar's life as a professional classical guitarist.  In addition to the virtuosic and powerful performances which form the bulk of the material, Afshar provides well informed introductions to the pieces, translations of foreign language titles and a short biography outlining her cultural and educational background.  This much can seldom be said for this sort of product.

The main menu features a background serenade of Afshar's arrangement of the Persian Ballad ""Jaan-e-Maryam"" and provides the user with chapter/track selections as well great bonuses:

1. A mini-movie ""Lily Afshar in the First Person"".  Here Afshar describes her life in the chapters ""Beginnings"", ""Life as a Performing Musician"", ""Teaching"", ""Lily's Guitar"", ""Influences"", and ""Future Goals"".

2. Photo Gallery.  The viewer is treated to a series of photos of Lily beginning with her at age 7 continuing to the present and accompanied by Granados' Andaluza.  Many of the photos include a variety of luminaries in the classical guitar world including Segovia, Alirio Diaz, Oscar Ghiglia and Pepe Romero.

It is refreshing to see an artist provide such an open view into her past.

The program spans the globe with an excellent set of pieces reflecting various cultural heritages; some pieces well known, others less, but altogether important works for the guitar.

Program:

1-4. ""Koyunbaba"" (op. 10) by Carlo Domeniconi.  Features Afshar's original cadenza in the final movement.
5. ""Kara Toprak"" (Black Earth) arr. Ricardo Moyano and by Asik Veysel
Five Persian Ballads arr. Lily Afshar:
6. ""Gol-e-Gandome""
7. ""Dareneh-Jaan/Aziz-Joon""
8. ""Leila-Leila""
9. ""Jaan-e-Maryam""
10. ""Lala-ee""
11. ""Gozaar (Calligraphy no. 5)"" by Reza Vali (this piece was written for Afshar in 2003)
Three Caprichos from ""24 Caprichos de Goya"" by Mario-Castelnuovo Tedesco (1961).  Afshar informs us that Segovia asserted that these were the most important pieces in the history of the guitar repertory; sadly they've been neglected.  While listening to Afshar's introduction to this set, the viewer is presented with the Goya etchings upon which the selected caprichos are based.
12. ""No Hubio Remedio""
13. ""Quien mas Rendido""
14. ""El Sueno de la Razon Produce Monstruos""
15. ""Andaluza"" (spanish dance no. 5) arr. Lily Afshar by Enrique Granados
16. ""Un Dia de Noviembre"" by Leo Brouwer
17. ""Misionera"" arr. Jorge Morel by F. Bustamente

The production quality of the DVD is middle of the road (but who cares?). My main gripe is that sometimes an unattractive glare is produced by the lighting/camera angle combination.  There are a variety of camera angles which any guitarist will appreciate (often providing nice close-ups of her hands)--much better than a sterile/boring straight-on single angle format.

A great buy.",1263254400,,2998,5.353944562899787
