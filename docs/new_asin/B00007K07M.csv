Well apparently the same thing is true for film as the film under review, a slightly-veiled World War II propaganda piece by Edward Dmytryk in the days when the Soviet Union was an American ally and all hands, American and Soviet among others, were needed in the titanic struggle to smash the Nazi-night-takers who were subjecting Europe to a thrashing. (Of course a few years later Dmytryk when the tide turned against the Soviets in the early Cold War days and all hands were needed against them  wound up being jailed as one of the Hollywood Ten who were honorably sentenced for contempt for not snitching on their fellow leftists-although he did sing later, sang loud to save his two bit career). The film under review was an effort in that direction although it was spiced up a bit as a third-rate thriller.

When the deal went down that mention of all hands against the Nazis was no hyperbole as the two main characters of this film were escapees from the Rock, Alcatraz, the supposedly inescapable federal prison out in Frisco bay. Champ, played by James Craig, and Jimbo hightailed it one foggy night and wound up seeking refuge at a lighthouse out in the Japan currents. They take the residents of that lighthouse hostage, including the lighthouse keepers fetching wholesome daughter Ann, played by Bonita Granville, and plan their next moves (and Champ plays his hand trying to get with Ann to keep himself occupied until shipping out time).

What the fugitives did not know, nor did the residents, was that one of their number was a Nazi agent using the place to work on his nefarious plans to help blow up half of Frisco town if the opportunity presented itself. Jimbo wound up wasting that agent without knowing what his purposes had been. Those became clear when a threesome, two men and a woman, claimed they were stranded and sought refuge at the lighthouse. Their real purpose was to rendezvous with a German sub in order to get detailed plans of the layout of the city to the proper military authorities. For most of the film Champ and Jimbo could have cared less about what the Nazis were up to, it wasn't their fight. After all they were prisoners, escaped prisoners, who were looking for a getaway. They would bargain with the devil if he could get them out. But once they became aware that the plans would have blown the Rock and them with it they began to see the light, began to see that they had to defend American right against the vermin.

Jimbo said it best, they were gangsters but they were American gangsters and they formed that vaunted united front with the lighthouse residents to do the Nazi scum in. Got the information to the right people to blow that damn Nazi sub out of the water too. See even fugitives, low life, could contribute to the war effort. Okay.",1491264000,,2884,4.615984405458089

This one mixes Pearl Harbor paranoia with the criminals conformity to patriotic jingoism.

7977838,4,B00007K07M,"Alcatraz has the feel of a radio drama with it's isolated location and character interaction, as the two escapees hold a lighthouse crew of four at gunpoint and stumble on a Nazi spy ring in the process.  There's a shot up front of P-36's flying over.  There's a shot at the end of Catalinas on patrol, though the planes that drop the depth charges on the model Uboat look different.

Glory involves a rickety air supply service to an Andean mine by a scheming manager who selects only washed up stateside pilots with no other recourse than to work on his terms, never really getting anywhere by being in near constant debt to the company bunkhouse with room, board and liquor charges.  A newly arrived married couple throws a monkey wrench into the whole works with a fatal climax.  Three planes are seen flying, a Stinson Junior monoplane, a Boeing biplane and maybe a Travel Air biplane.  A non-flying SE5 and Jenny are seen at the field.  Most of the actual flying shots are take offs and landings, with aerial shots done with models.  There is some stunt work toward the end by a drunken pilot in the Boeing.",1396310400,,1113,4.557788944723618
7977839,2,B00007K07M,"""Seven Miles from Alcatraz"" isn't really a prison escape film, but rather a 1942 RKO film about Nazi spies that was part of the Hollywood propaganda surrounding WW 2.

Square jawed James Craig (1912-85) plays a convict who escapes from Alcatraz only to find himself on an island with Nazi spies. He appeared in more than 50 films and was most popular in the 40s when he appeared in ""Kitty Foyle"" (1940), ""The Human Comedy"" (1943), and ""Kismet"" (1944). Craig's style of acting may appeal to some, but I found it annoying.

Bonita Granville (1923-88) plays Craig's love interest. She was nominated for an Oscar for ""These Three"" (1936) but is best remembered as Nancy Drew in the film series (1938-9) and as the producer of the Lassie TV show (1959-73).

George Cleveland (1885-1057) plays Granville's ""pop"" and later appeared as ""gramps"" in her ""Lassie"" series. He also did a lot of the John Wayne B films in the 30s.

John Banner (1910-73) plays a Nazi - what else? Banner is best remembered as Sgt. Schultz from TV's ""Hogan Heroes"" (1965-71). Ironically, Banner was Jewish, but having been born in Germany, he played a Nazi for most of his film career. BTW - Banner is slim and handsome, almost impossible to recognize.

Edward Dmytryk (1908-1999) was part of the Hollywood 10, a group of blacklisted film makers imprisoned during the McCarthy era. Dmytryk was nominated for an Oscar for ""Crossfire"" (1947) and won at Cannes. He was twice nominated for a DGA award - ""the Young Lions"" (1958) and ""The Caine Mutiny"" (1954).

My favorite prison break films are - ""Cool Hand Luke"" (1967), ""Each Dawn I Die"" (1939), ""Papillion"" (1973), ""Midnight Express"" (1978),""The Shawshank Redemption"" (1994), ""The Escapist"" (2008), ""I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"" (1932), ""Escape from New York"" (1981), ""Stalag 17"" (1953), ""The Great Escape"" (1963), and ""Life"" (1999). Of course, this isn't really a prison escape film.

In terms of early anti-Nazi propaganda films about the danger of Nazi spies, some of my favorites are ""Confessions of a Nazi Spy"" (1939), ""The Spy in Black"" (1939), ""Enemy Agent"" (1940), ""Foreign Correspondent"" (1940), ""Across the Pacific"" (1942), ""Dawn Express"" (1942), ""Northern Pursuit"" (1943), and ""The Fallen Sparrow"" (1943). Disney produced several notable animated films - ""Der Fuehrer's Face"" (1942), ""Education for Death"" (1943), and ""Commando Duck"" (1944).

Bottom line - a pretty silly propaganda piece.",1372982400,2,2424,5.0425
7977840,3,B00007K07M,"""You gotta admit, it's a pretty piece of masonry, that Alcatraz,"" remarks cynical, cocky convict and voiceover narrator Champ Larkin (James Craig) as the film opens. Reading about the assault on Pearl Harbor in the papers and now concerned about possible bombing raids (they're sitting ducks there at ""the Rock""), Champ and his cellmate Jimbo (Frank Jenks) break out during a blackout. Frantically evading police patrol boats, they hole up in a nearby lighthouse station and take hostage the four people inside it. Little do they know that one of the hostages happens to be an enemy spy.

Running at a brisk 62 minutes, SEVEN MILES FROM ALCATRAZ is a 1942 RKO release and is one of those interesting genre hybrids, managing to mix in elements of gangster drama and espionage thriller, with a dash of romance thrown in. Hardened fugitives Champ and Jimbo are concerned only with making a clean getaway. But we realize that this film was released during the wartime era and that the narrative's main thrust is to convert the two crooks into patriotic men of action. Figure in next-door-neighbor pretty Bonita Granville (of Nancy Drew fame) as one of the lighthouse hostages, and it's just one more incentive for Champ Larkin to change his ways. When Bonita's character berates him early on (""Men are fighting a war to keep life decent, and you haven't the faintest idea what they're fighting for.""), it barely registers on the scornful Champ. But Bonita's got a whole hour to wear down her leading man's resistance. It's sort of fun watching Champ go from regarding the war as ""strictly someone else's headache"" to referring to Adolf as ""that lightweight with the hair piece on his lip.""

Perennial B-movie leading man James Craig is perfectly serviceable as the goon-turned-hero. He's propped up by Bonita Granville and by Frank Jenks who plays his sidekick Jimbo, a gruff character whose hobby is solving word puzzles. Imagine how handy this knack is when the narrative introduces the German spy ring and its plot to blow up San Francisco. The real big bads, when they finally make an appearance, are pretty over-the-top and tend to spout corny lines and propaganda (although you can say the same for the American hostages who themselves don't hesitate to speechify). Feel free to roll the eyes. Still, maybe the most amusing line in the film comes courtesy of the chief Nazi spy who walks into the room, gun in hand, even as the German duchess trumpets the glory of the super race to an unimpressed Champ Larkin. Pressed for time, the chief spy threatens Champ with his gun and remarks to her: ""There is no time to convert a man to National Socialism."" Heh.

If you've got an hour to spare, you can do worse than sitting thru SEVEN MILES FROM ALCATRAZ. It's spare and low budget and moves fast. You'd think the story would be static since the story mostly takes place in the lighthouse. But several plot points surface as the interests of the three parties, at extreme odds with one another, collide. It all climaxes with an extended, knock-down, drag-out brawl that encompasses several levels of the lighthouse, all the way up the tenuous spiral stairway leading to the tower. James Craig earned his lumps that day.

Sorry, but I haven't seen FLIGHT FROM GLORY, the companion flick on this VHS tape. For what it's worth, film critic Leonard Martin writers this about it: ""Hard-boiled, virile tale of outcast pilots stuck flying dangerous missions over the Andes. Excellent programmer that prefigures ONLY ANGELS HAVE WINGS in many respects."" FLIGHT FROM GLORY, a 1937 film, also runs a bit over an hour long. It stars Chester Morris and Van Heflin.",1346716800,3,3650,4.853932584269663
