8354488,1,B0027CI1NM,"This is nothing like to original documentary from Nova, following these 7 medical students to doctors to years into their career. when i saw this i was excited to see the conclusion finally. but this is not the conclusion i was expecting.",1372032000,,238,4.690476190476191
8354489,5,B0027CI1NM,"I teach Medical Careers Exploration and this movie, even though dated, accurately depicts what it takes to become a physician. I wish they would make a new version of it!!!",1364774400,3,172,4.766666666666667
8354490,3,B0027CI1NM,"Because I have a son-in-law who is in med school, I found this DVD extremely relevant and could relate to much of it.  The end - - when they follow up years later to see where the doctors are today - - is mostly depressing, as some ended up not practicing, was having difficulty staying employed, most had broken social relationships, or were generally burned out.  Illuminating and disillusioning at the same time.",1363305600,3,415,4.671232876712328
8354491,5,B0027CI1NM,"If you are interested in pursuing a career in medicine, this is a great video to watch.  It gives the viewer an idea of what becoming a doctor all involves and the sacrifices that must be made.  It will make you think.",1351987200,,218,4.166666666666667
8354492,5,B0027CI1NM,Very well thought up movie. Very compelling to watch. Wish there were more like this following the lives of medical students throughout their careers!,1345161600,,150,5.291666666666667
8354493,5,B0027CI1NM,"I view this as something that every premed student should see. Based on the responses from a number of doctors, both recent medical school graduates as well as those who graduated a while ago, they see this as very honest and without the glam of shows like Grey's Anatomy. You can watch the whole thing online through the PBS site, but I thought it was so well done that I wanted to own the DVD.",1260489600,6,395,4.28
