8515515,5,B007F1A32C,"Great Documentary. The best of all of the Chris McCandless stories. Filmed at the same time as the Sean Penn movie but more informative than Hollywood. His story has always fascinated me. And I enjoyed the Into The Wild book and Movie. But, if you enjoyed them, then this is a must see!!

Although, I'm dumbfounded why the price on here for a used copy is more than if you buy the movie brand new from the people that actually made the film? I downloaded the movie and watched it but came here to buy a copy for a friend. Extremely disappointing.",1362009600,2,546,4.352941176470588
