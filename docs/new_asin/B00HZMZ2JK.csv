8637565,5,B00HZMZ2JK,Love this movie for my twin grandbabies. They watch it all the time.,1487203200,,68,4.3076923076923075

I watched it with my 2 y/o and 6 m/o yes the audio is off but they aren't paying attention to words matching the characters mouths. My sons favorite is Joey's Toy Box. At any rate it's great buy for those that need a minute to clean house, start dinner, take a shower, or by gods take a crap without your kids, that there is worth it's weight in gold.

Enjoy!",1450396800,,509,4.247422680412371
