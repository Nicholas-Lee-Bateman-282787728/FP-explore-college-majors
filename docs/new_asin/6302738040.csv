7830196,1,6302738040,This was pure dross. Poorly acted melodrama that played out like a bad after-school special from the mid-70s. Couldn't sit through it. Don't waste your time.,1482710400,,157,5.076923076923077
7830197,3,6302738040,"I'd prefer to give this 2-1/2 stars, but the movie does present a somewhat balanced portrayal of the heated issue of abortion.  Since I was not an extra in this movie like another reviewer, I have no interest in over-rating it as it is quite flawed in some aspects.  Unfortunately, the two lead characters are unsympathetic and barely cross the line of one-dimensional.  Jed is given a stereotypical southern name and is a controlling and sometimes abusive husband.  Bonnie, while having the flat affect of many abused wives, does many things that are out of character for most abused women -- ignoring orders, talking back and coming home late from work, for which abused women are usually beaten severely.  Thus, there is an ambiguity to the abuse aspects, and her mental health issues are even more ambiguous, which unnecessarily muddies the plot since no history as to that is given whatsoever.  There is so little history of their marriage or personal lives presented, they are little more than hood ornaments in a demolition derby.  What happened to the pregnant woman injured at the protest?  Why is it not considered child abuse to involve a young girl in pro-life causes and protests?  (I personally once witnessed a pro-lifer on a street corner with a poster of a maimed fetus accosting children on their way home from school.)  The pro-choice demonstrators were presented fairly sterotypically.  This movie was good in some ways and certainly not awful, but in so many ways, it just barely touched its own characters and presented nothing to further either side of the argument.",1475884800,,1589,4.93609022556391
