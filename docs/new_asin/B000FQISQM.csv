8125562,5,B000FQISQM,"BEST SHOW EVER! Hyper, funny, and just plain crazy! This show is so fast-paced with hilarious antics but has tear-jerking moments too. I highly recommend this show to anyone who hasn't seen it already! :) You won't regret it! This box set comes with Kodocha DVDs volume 7: ""Adult Sized Secrets"" and volume 8: ""Sana's Duty."" It also comes with a little plush Babbit! :)",1439942400,,368,4.676923076923077
