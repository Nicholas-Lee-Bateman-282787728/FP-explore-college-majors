But Han Ji Eun is swindled by her best friends and loses her cherished home. Because of her friends betrayal she is stranded in China, while they sell her house.

On the airplane and in China, she runs into the self-centered actor, Lee Young Jae and they don't quite hit it off with each other due to a few awkward incidents. But thanks to the actor, she is able to return to Korea. However, she soon finds out that he is the one that bought her home.

Ji Eun and Young Jae continue to run into each other. For different personal reasons, they wind up in a one-year marriage contract. But as these two live together and argue consistently, they start to develop feelings for each other.

This is a great and popular romantic comedy. It was a hit drama in 2004. There are lots of funny, endearing, and romantic moments throughout the show. I recommend watching this drama. (16 episodes)",1388448000,,1050,4.458333333333333
8215971,5,B000V02P34,"The best Korean Drama that whole family can enjoy!
I recommend this DVD to every household to watch.  The main actress and top model, Song Hey-Kyo is not only the prettiest, lovely, beautiful gorgeous and talented leading lady but also she is so angel-like freshness and smile that make us so joyful to see even she gets mad or cry.  The actor, Rain (Jung Ji-Hoon)is a top singer, dancer, model, song writer,and CEO but he helps people in need with a big heart, and very charming.  Our family love this drama the best and we watch from time to time, always.  We do like another movie,""The Autumn in My Heart,"" also played by Song Hye-Kyo, and very sad good love story drama also, but this Full House is the best Korean Drama ever!! This drama settings are so beautiful also...the house, the place, the music, the daily life, the pretty glasses they drink, and everything joyful to watch.  We wish to see more dramas like this with these two lovely couple, Rain and Song Hey- Kyo together again ......in future.  We just love BiKYO Couple very much!!
Oh, We ordered 9 DVD Set $91.98 + $2.95 shipping through Amazon.com and so glad to have this set from KBS, Korea, instead of cheap copies made by unauthorized.",1348531200,5,1209,4.574074074074074

It is a darling, yet sometimes tearful story of how love beats all odds.
If you love the Pop Korean Singer/Dancer ""RAIN"" you won't be sorry you
watched this. The four lead actors are great together!",1188172800,5,265,4.215686274509804
