7796148,5,1561270369,"From 1988, it might not be up to today's technical standards, but it's a tremendous
performance nonetheless.  I've had the Davis/Lehnhoff JENUFA for a long time and
this might be even better.  I haven't seen/heard Mattila in the title role, but I can't
imagine it being done better than what Nancy Gustafson does here.  Felicity
Palmer is perfect as the mother-in-law from hell and all three tenors are quite
good.  The spare production values might not appeal to everyone, but I found
them generally effective.  And Lehnhoff certainly knows how to get the best
acting from his excellent singers.  Plus, this DVD is a bargain.",1454630400,2,626,4.914285714285715
7796149,5,1561270369,"Janacek's Kat'a Kabanova is a beautifully scored opera that manages to combine realism with lyricism.  This production was excellent both in terms of singing and acting.  Ms. Gustafson's portrayl was moving and captured the inner conflicts of the heroine. Other performers, especially the mother-in-law, were very convincing.  In short, I would highly recommend this dvd: A heartfelt performance that does justice to this very poingnant work.",1305590400,4,442,5.666666666666667

7796151,1,1561270369,"This production of Katya Kabanova is OK, but not much more than that.  It has respectable singers, especially in Nancy Gustafson and Felicity Palmer, but they appear bloodless and dull, and the orchestra, as another reviewer has pointed out, has faded into the background.  Add this to Glyndebourne's totally non-descript sets and costumes, and you get something that's sort of dull.  Also, there are some cuts from Janacek's original score, which is absolutely unfathomable in an opera that doesn't run for an hour and a half in its full version
A much better choice is the Salzburg Festival DVD of this opera by TDK.  First, the negatives:  it's one of those productions by a European director who thinks that Janacek would have done it this way if only he had just been as clever as the director.  It's set not on the banks of the Volga, but in the courtyard of a Soviet-era apartment building somewhere in Eastern Europe.  There are a few distractors: a non-singing drunk/demented person (take your choice) who is on-stage all the time; a broken fountain that substitutes for the Volga; the Kabanicha's room perpetually open onto the stage, and so on.
However, the positives far outweigh the negatives.  Angela Denoke is incandescent as Katya.  The entire supporting cast beats the Glyndebourne cast, one-on-one, hands down.  Dagmar Peckova (Varvara) and Rainer Trost (Kudryas) elevate their roles through their artistry to primario status.  The orchestra(the Czech Philharmonic, Sylvain Cambreling conducting) is clear and powerful, and well-balanced with the singers.  Worst case, you can turn off the picture and just listen to it.
I got my copy of this version of KK from the Royal Opera's website (Region 0 encoded). ...",1051833600,17,1729,5.070671378091872
7796152,2,1561270369,"Listening to this over high fidelity stereo loudspeakers, I found this video largely unsatisfying.  It's pleasant to look at, and the singing is fine.  The main problem is the balance.  The orchestra is much too far in  the background, as if the engineers mistakenly considered it to be  accompaniment to the singing.  As a result the spectacularly colored  orchestrations, the harmony, and much of the DRAMA (!) of this work are  lost in this video.  In short, musically it makes no sense...except for a  number of scattered moments when the beautiful sound of the music is  discernible.  I suspect that this was a good performance, badly recorded or  engineered.",917049600,19,664,4.981651376146789
