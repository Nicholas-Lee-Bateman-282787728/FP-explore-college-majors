8706461,5,B00UGQEYIM,"Stanley Kubrick made a habit out of directing films which are not what they first appear to be. He offers a simple surface text which is readily comprehensible based squarely in a genre which the spectator easily identifies, but then he undercuts it by setting out the real meat of what he is saying as subtext. 2001: A Space Odyssey appears to be a science fiction fantasy but is actually a deeply metaphysical statement on the nature of Man; A Clockwork Orange appears to be an entertaining youth culture film reveling in sex and violence but is actually a Swiftian satire on a clockwork society denying personal freedom; Barry Lyndon appears to be a picaresque 18th century costume drama but is actually a meditation on the enlightenment and the birth of modern man with characters every bit as clockwork as those in the film that preceded it; and The Shining appears to be a straightforward horror-schlocker but is actually a horror parody and a jet black comedy on America and the American nuclear family. Like Paths of Glory, Full Metal Jacket appears to be a straightforward war film but further viewings reveal a profound meditation on the duality of Man. Actually, duality pervades the whole Kubrick uvre to the extent that any given film can be broken down and understood as a complex series of binary and binary opposite combinations. In The Shining this duality reaches unprecedented complexity and in Full Metal Jacket it is explicitly spelled out by one of the characters as The duality of Man  the Jungian thing. The biggest overriding duality in Kubrick is this central dichotomy between commercial necessity and artistic expression. In film after film he anchors the spectators attention in readily identifiable codes (the simple plot, the use of genre) making sure he makes money, but then explores various aspects of the human condition fascinatingly and in the most revealing way. The intellectual apercus is fundamentally dark  misanthropic, misogynistic, cold and despairing, but audiences flock to the films in their droves. Great art is usually an audience turn-off and commercial suicide, but Kubrick manages to turn it into a magnet which draws people to see his films again and again. Full Metal Jacket is just such a work, a riveting war film as exciting and as involving as any ever made, but also an artistic statement as deep as the world. What follows contains spoilers. Dont read if you haven't seen.

I well remember seeing Full Metal Jacket in the cinema in 1987 when it first came out. One of the later Vietnam War films, all the talk centered on comparing it with Oliver Stones Platoon which had scooped all the Oscars the previous year. I was absolutely stunned, taking particular note of the way the audience around me reacted as they watched. The film is in two halves, the first playing out on Parris Island training camp, South Carolina as a group of marine recruits are knocked into shape by foul-mouthed Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (a deeply disturbing extraordinary performance from R. Lee Ermey). Prominent among the recruits are Pvt. Joker (Matthew Modine), Pvt. Cowboy (Arliss Howard) and Pvt. Pyle (Vincent DOnofrio giving the films other knock-out performance). Parodying military training camp dramas such as An Officer and a Gentleman, Kubrick plays on audience expectation as he stresses the brutal humor, particularly the way the overweight impractical Pyle cant do anything right and is victimized and bullied by Hartman and eventually all his fellow recruits. We think Hartman is another Lou Gosset Jr. and that all the recruits will make it and we wait for him to bid them a teary farewell. Not on your life ladies. Icy-cold Hartman pushes Pyle so hard that the recruit turns psychotic and in a devastating denouement shoots Hartman in the head (the bathroom) before shooting himself in the head. The brains dripping down the wall behind his toilet as the screen fades out completely silenced the packed house I was sitting in who until that point had been relaxed and laughing. Kubrick, the master audience manipulator had us by the balls as the film changed scene to Vietnam. Rarely have I sensed in the cinema such a masterful power emanating from the voice behind the images we were watching as I did here.

The tension inevitably sags in the second half, but its still a superior combat war film as we are taken first to Da Nang where we see Joker the Stars and Stripes journo becoming disillusioned with reporting before goading his c.o. during the 1968 Tet offensive to send him into the action first in Phu Bai where he meets up again with his Island buddy Cowboy and his Lusthog Squad, and then into combat proper in the Battle of Hu. Joker is the films voice-over narrator (we hear him 3 times in Part 1 and twice in Part 2) and we see the action from his perspective as a journey in which control is gradually lost and he scores his first kill. Hartmans total control in Part 1 gives way to the more relaxed control of Lt. Lockhart (John Terry) in Da Nang, the even more relaxed control of Lt. Touchdown (Ed ORoss), Crazy Earl (Kieron Jecchinis), and then the complete non-control of Cowboy and the squads machine-gunner Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin). The film concludes in a long sequence involving the flushing out of a Viet Cong sniper who turns out to be a young woman. Joker breaks his cherry by executing the dying girl (Ngoc Le) and declares himself glad to be alive and no longer afraid. The second half vacillates between these gripping combat sequences and reflective scenes critiquing US involvement in the war and the way the media portrays it  the Mickey Mouse journalist office and the TV interviews where soldiers are asked for their views. Coming after a compelling tightly-constructed first half, what follows seems to be rambling and disorganized and at the time I agreed with the majority of people in seeing the total experience as being excellent, but lacking the extra frisson of Platoon, a film which really pulverizes the senses and the mind more effectively. The key difference between the films of course is that while Stone throws himself into a very personal labor of love putting his own Vietnam War experiences on the screen, Kubrick pays mere lip-service to the genre, using the war to put on screen his own perception of the human condition. As a combat war film Full Metal Jacket may be rambling and disorganized, but as a Kubrick film we know this is a calculated part of a much bigger picture which becomes clearer the more times we watch it.

Key to the breakdown of control and apparent chaos of Part 2 is the breakdown of the machine. Mechanical man is a key Kubrickian perception and we see him stride through every Kubrick film operating machines which appear in many guises. The machine may be a robbery (the racetrack heist in The Killing), a society (18th century European high society in Barry Lyndon), a country (America in The Shining) or modern man in toto (2001), but it gets its clearest statement in the military power structures of Paths of Glory, Dr. Strangelove and here. All these films demonstrate men as cogs in a human machine which they think they can control, but which ends up controlling (and even defining) them. Dr. Strangelove delivers the clearest example of this with its depiction of Americas nuclear defense system where one cog going a little funny in the head sets off a mechanical chain reaction resulting in nuclear apocalypse. Kubricks vision got progressively colder, a point illustrated by comparing Full Metal Jacket with Paths of Glory.

Both are war films cast in 2 parts which set about depicting machines which go wrong because of human error as HAL memorably puts it in 2001. In Paths of Glory an ambitious general orders an impossible attack which inevitably fails while in Full Metal Jacket a recruit is pushed over the edge into killing his superior and then himself. Both events occur halfway through their respective narratives. In Paths of Glory the second half demonstrates how the machine fixes itself with the errant general passing the blame onto the soldiers who disobeyed him. The film builds to the execution of 3 representatives which mirrors the earlier battle in its despicable horror. The machine of the film is not only military, but social as well with the upper class generals of the chteau clearly contrasted with the lower class scum inhabiting the trenches. The trenchmen pay the price for upper class ambition and a clear moral is drawn via the character of Col. Dax who has one foot in both social worlds and acts as a conduit for the films crystal-clear anti-war message. The machine is fixed and military/social order is restored, but we are left in no doubt that the machine is evil as Dax voices the spectators disgust at what has passed. Contrast with Full Metal Jacket. Aside from a brief sequence with a colonel in Part 2 who delivers a speech which is complete baloney (Inside every gook theres an American) there is no depiction of order either social or military. The elite are invisible and command is placed most of all in the hands of Hartman in Part 1. But when he is blown away, command is never restored with Joker passing down a scale of diminishing command and mounting chaos once he arrives in Vietnam. The grunts are cogs in a machine which is depicted as broken from the beginning with no clear enemy and no clear cause worth fighting for in sight. When one marine suggests freedom he is told by an experienced grunt to flush out your headgear and suggests poontang as the cause for which they are fighting. There is no Col. Dax figure to focus our moral response and consequently there is no moral in the film at all. Instead there is a nihilistic statement of the cold inhuman nature of modern man with misanthropy and misogyny running wild. Men are depersonalized killing machines while women are mere objects to be bought, used and abused. If the trajectory of Paths of Glory is from the machine breaking down in battle to the machine fixing itself in the executions, the trajectory of Full Metal Jacket is from the machine breaking down in suicide to the still broken machine breaking down even further in another suicide as Joker kills the human part of himself to become a total killer. In the helicopter ride at the start of Part 2 the still green Joker watches a marine machine-gun everyone he sees through the open door and asks, How can you shoot women and children? His inner impulse to peace produces disgust, but in the films final sequence he kills that innocent spark within him by shooting the sniper who happens to be both a woman and a child. One suicide follows another and we are left with Mickey Mouse automatons marching through the mist in a bleak misanthropic vision of humanity as a truly monstrous machine whose control and purpose are impossible to discern.

We also understand the disorder of Part 2 and the very nature of the human machine itself reflects the duality that underpins everything we see. When screenwriter Michael Herr first met Kubrick to discuss adapting Gustav Hasfords short story titled The Short-Timers, the director asked him how much he knew about C. G. Jung, the famous psychoanalyst and he later wrote the following about his work: The substance was single-minded, the old and always serious problem of how you put into a film or a book the living, behaving presence of what Jung called The Shadow, the most accessible of archetypes, and the easiest to experienceWar is the ultimate field of Shadow-activity, where all of its other activities lead you. As they expressed it in Vietnam, Yea, though I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of death, I will fear no Evil, for I AM the evil. In Part 2 Joker constantly wears a peace button on his jacket while having the words Born to Kill written on his helmet. When a colonel takes him to task for his sick joke Joker explains hes expressing The duality of Man  the Jungian thing. When asked where he got the peace button he answers that hes forgotten (code for repressing the memory) which leads us to conclude that the duality here is the one in the human unconscious, between the personal unconscious (the button representing everything that has been repressed) and the Collective Unconscious, the collective impulse which both unites all marines as a brotherhood and which streams through all of Kubricks films  Mans instinct to kill each other. Once this central duality is understood we can see how the whole film is structured out of a series of binary and binary opposite combinations leading off from it.

Clearly Part 2 is rambling and disorganized precisely because Part 1 is so tight and organized. The two halves of the film function as a binary opposite with a series of events leading up to a pair of suicides which clearly mirror each other just as the battle and the executions did in Paths of Glory. Part 1 is structured almost completely out of binary combinations. The recruits are in training on Parris Island for 2 months. They inhabit a room with beds lined up down 2 sides of a long space facing each other. The beds are bunk beds, one above the other. Hartman screams at his pukes citing a stream of binary combinations. He orders them to sound off like youve got a pair, talks about steers and queers, sailors and royalty, this is my rifle. This is my gun, and one for the commandant. One for the Corps. Most insistent of all is the left, right, left, right that we hear (and see) constantly. The task is very simple  the recruits are asked to bury their usual social niceties into their own personal unconscious while uniting themselves behind the Collective Unconscious which is to kill, or to do or die. The successful recruit embodies both halves of his unconscious within himself. Pyle however cannot do this. He can be either one or the other, not both at the same time. He does not possess the correct duality to become a mean marine part of the killing machine. At first he is too nice, has a ridiculous helpless smirk and keeps making mistakes. When he fails to show he understands the difference between left and right, Hartman hits him on both sides of his head to teach him. Hartmans bullying does not work as shown most effectively when Pyle fails to climb a tall climbing frame. As pairs of recruits zoom up and down either side of him Pyle inches up slowly and painfully and fails to get up and over. Only when Joker is assigned to help Pyle can he begin to do the tasks he is set. Joker becomes nice to make a binary pair with Pyle and he eventually learns to get up and over, a scene followed by the pair climbing down in tandem. Joker sorts out Pyles left-right problem with shoelaces, teaching him to put the right one over the left, the left one over the right Pyle thrives on Jokers binary bonding, but when Hartman discovers a jelly donut in Pyles foot locker the dynamic is changed yet again as Hartman orders the whole company to be punished for Pyles mistakes. A mid-night hazing episode with all recruits hitting Pyle with soap breaks the binary bond between Joker and Pyle. In a precursor of the peace button / Born to Kill binary opposite of Part 2 Joker reverts to the correct marine duality. He hits Pyle even harder than his fellow recruits, but then puts hands over his ears to block out Pyles sobbing. He expresses the Collective Unconscious by participating in the hazing, but represses his bad conscience immediately afterward. From here Pyle is the perfect killing machine, an outstanding marine who can do exactly what Charles Whitman and Lee Harvey Oswald did (ie; assassinate figures in public places!). Hartman holds this murderous binary up as an example for the whole squad as Kubricks camera zooms in on Pyles increasingly deranged stare. Unlike the other recruits Pyle cant repress his good side. He can only be one or the other and in the concluding bloodbath he shows he is beyond help when he blows Hartman away. The bathroom is another binary location with toilets facing each other along 2 walls with no dividing partitions, and as Joker is left as the only one of the 3 to survive we realize he remains alive because he possesses the correct duality. We see nothing of Hartman except his mean, nasty goading and in a crazy way Pyle and he are twinned and so Pyle destroys him before destroying himself. Joker has shown that beneath the Born to Kill instinct there is humanity which Pyle recognizes when he spares him. Two things that are said here are reflected in Part 2. As Hartman enters the toilet he says, Whats this Mickey Mouse bull****, and both Joker and Pyle talk about being in a world of s***. Both reappear at the end of Part 2 where Joker admits in voiceover, Yes, I am in a world of s*** and then when the troops march off singing the Mickey Mouse theme song.

The point about the training in Part 1 is that marines can only be killing machines if they are working together and the order is clearly passed down from above. With Hartman ever present, this situation is effected, but in Vietnam where the higher command becomes muddied, the instinct to kill is correspondingly blunted. The events of Part 2 show how the instinct issuing from the Collective Unconscious breaks down and how the personal unconscious within each marine reasserts itself and makes him vulnerable. In Da Nang Joker talks big about wanting to get back into the s***, but such macho posturing along with his John Wayne imitation illustrates a sarcastic lack of respect for seniority which marks him as a big softy. Animal Mother senses it when he first meets and confronts him, Adam Baldwins character playing the role Pyle would have been had he have made it through training. Baldwin and DOnofrio are both big-boned, round-headed actors and are no doubt cast deliberately by Kubrick as doppelgngers. Animal Mothers helmet reads I am Become Death to hit the point home. Other binary combinations we notice in Part 2 are Joker/Rafterman always together as a father/son surrogate team, and Joker/Cowboy identical bald-headed recruits who cleaned the head in tandem on the Island and who are reunited in Phu Bai. We also notice in the course of the narrative the squad has 4 leaders, 2 have a semblance of authority and 2 have none at all. When the Sniper attacks the squad she sucks in and kills 2 grunts and in turn it takes 2 to kill her. Machismo plays against impotence here in a binary opposite. Animal Mothers aggressive machismo is a major element in explaining the concluding sniper episode where he disobeys the impotent Cowboys direct order and goes it alone. Jokers personal feelings of friendship for Cowboy and paternal responsibility for Rafterman (Kevyn Major Howard) also both come into play when he joins the party to flush the sniper out. He is intimidated by Animal Mother when Cowboy is shot and joins the search to match the dare to get payback. These are boys in the playground here comparing the sizes of their erections, not parts of a well-organized killing machine they are supposed to be. If they had all followed Cowboys order they would have simply walked around the problem instead of getting themselves tangled up in more slaughter for the sake of a camaraderie emanating from the personal unconscious which had better stay repressed for the sake of the team. Joker of course is nervous. When he has the sniper in his sites his rifle jams and to his embarrassment his life is saved by the man hes supposed to be protecting (Rafterman) who blows her away. Kubrick likes to parallel male endeavor with the sex instinct. Just as Major Kong rides his phallic bomb to the ultimate orgasm at the end of Dr. Strangelove, so Jokers gaining of his first kill is visualized in the manner of a virginal schoolboy finally breaking his cherry. At first his rifle jams (as many a young lads does when attempting to fire it for the first time), but then when he assassinates her with his pistol he does so to the admiration of all. The rampant misogyny of the film gets fullest expression in this scene where the dying girl as per usual is defined purely in sexual terms. One of the marines says, No more boom-boom for this baby-san while Animal Mother greets Jokers final orgasmic release with an admiring Hard core, man. The thing we notice most of all though in this final scene is Joker killing the innocence within himself and professing himself happy about it. On one level it balances Pyles suicide at the end of Part 1 and makes us think Part 2 being rambling and disorganized is clearly very pointed. On another level we notice where the voice-over narrator in Paths of Glory sets out the horror and Dax voices the central moral that war is wrong, Jokers narration in Full Metal Jacket is unreliable. He approves of what he is doing, but it is very doubtful if he even knows what he is doing as he fits seamlessly into Kubricks misanthropic vision of modern man. The final Mickey Mouse march into the mist looks back to the very dehumanizing we saw at the beginning of the film as all the recruits had their heads shaved on Parris Island. Jokers journey is one of disillusionment and dehumanization as Kubrick lays out his nihilistic vision. War is wrong, but larger than that for Kubrick modern man is wrong. Since Dr. Strangelove that has always been the case.",1521417600,2,21344,4.734408602150538
