8065757,4,B0009S2KKG,"Here is the premise: Get some of the best directors of horror from across Japan to scare you in 5 minutes.

There are 15 short films on the DVD by directors Takashi Shimzu, Keisuke Toyoshima, Ichiro Nakayama, Aiko Yoshida, Norio Tsuruta, Ryuta Miyake, Tyo Nanda, and Hirokatsu Kihara.

Overall, the DVD is great for what it does.  Get in, get scared, and get out (though one of the stories cheats a bit by being in 2 parts, but getting a horror story across in 10 minutes is still impressive).

The visuals are wonderful and some of the stories are truly scary.  All of them will leave you thinking.

The downside is that there are no bonus features (save for some trailers).  Audio commentaries would have been nice.  Since the entire feature clocks in at 75 minutes, I know they had the space.

The upside is that it is a great experiment to see what some established horror directors (and some not so established) can do when restricted to such short time, and all of them do it well.  You also get to see the directorial work of some people you may have not gotten to see before.

The downside is that some of the stores feel rushed and incomplete.

Overall, worth picking up if you are a fan of Japanese horror films.",1161648000,7,1222,4.454954954954955
