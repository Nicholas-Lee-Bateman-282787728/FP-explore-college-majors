8336866,5,B001QYCYUS,"Building the Three Gorges Dam in the U.S. would be impossible - too much political opposition to the required large numbers of people required to move, as well as likely environmental and other objections. The DVD did a good job presenting the lives of those being affected by the rising waters, and how the government worked to resettle them to higher ground in new housing. However, it is unfortunate that the documentary was completed in 2006 before the dam was finished, and thus did not have the story of how the Chinese obtained help in producing the original turbines, then manufactured the last ones themselves. It also would have been nice to show more scenes of the electrical generation portion, and add comparisons with eg. Hoover Dam.",1298160000,5,747,4.889763779527559
