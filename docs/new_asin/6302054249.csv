420058,4,6302054249,"It is interesting to watch Monty Python live. This performance gives quite a different effect than the studio series - for good and for worse. A big plus is the enthusiasm of the USAmerican fans, who can take just everything and even cheer for more and more. A few of the sketches do not work out perfectly on stage though.
Still, Monty Python Live At The Hollywood Bowl makes you roll over laughing, as usual.",982540800,,410,4.48
420059,4,6302054249,This is Monty Python at their very best.  Very little of the amusing but confusing sketch comedy that can be so hit or miss with American audiences.  This is a collection of their  material that appeals to the general  public.  This needs to be re-released so that people can get a chance to  see how delightful this comedy troupe was.,953596800,6,335,4.5
420060,5,6302054249,"Absolutely brilliant! This is a live recording taken from three stage concerts the Python's performed at the Hollywood Bowl and contains some of their best work from the popular TV series. All the favourites are here,  the Nudge Nudge sketch, Ministry of Silly Walks, etc. These sketches are  all performed in a much better way than in the original series, and there's  even some new material with Graham Chapman's 'One Man Wrestling' routine.  If you can stand the shouts of alcohol induced audience, this is a treat  for all Pythonites!",918259200,,538,4.933333333333334
420131,3,6302054249,"I thought I had a great bargain for this 2 dvd set.  I was way too wrong on thinking that I would get a good crisp dvd quality picture for it though!
LIVE AT THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL has the same cheap quality than the old VHS version, LIVE IN ASPEN ain't really a ""live"" show but rather a ""live"" interview with the whole lot (even Chapman is there in all his exquisite ash form!). The second dvd has a ""greatest sketches"" collection, hosted by Steve Martin. If you want to see Graham Chapman's last appearance with the group, than this is it. He was sadly really sick around the time this footage was shot, and he died soon afterwards. Martin's job is somehow a bit out of tune with the Python genre. The German show is good but you get the first one they did, and they talked in German on that one! A bit surreal to watch it really... The second TV show they did for Germany was done in English but I'm not sure if it's available anywhere (maybe on the Megaset? got to check that!)
Anyway, if you want everything from Python, you'll get it with this set and I believe that you cannot get the HOLLYWOOD BOWL gig on anything else than this! But it's obvious that A&E didn't put their hands on the master of that film, sadly!
I would advise you to keep your money for the Megaset if you're beginning your Python collection. Mainly because you have those 2 dvds in it AND you'll get the original series in its entirety and with great picture quality!
Anyway, do what you want to do, I mean it's your life, not mine! You chose what's best for your convenience, I don't care! Go ahead, buy it! But don't come back to me all teared-up because you thought it was going to be superb because I will tell you to go to hell! I mean, yeah, the image sucks and the sound too sucks, but hey it's pure, legit Python! You know... Aah! I didn't want to do this! Writing reviews and giving advice... I wanted to be... A Lumberjack!",1265241600,,1908,4.241758241758242
420132,3,6302054249,"If you're a faithful follower of Monty Python, as I am, you're going to buy this anyway, as I have, to complete your collection, but you're probably aware that Monty Python isn't really renowned for their live act; their TV Show was scripted and pre-recorded, their classic films, ""Holy Grail,"" ""Life Of Brian,"" and ""Meaning Of Life,"" were all scripted and assembled filmed takes, their records (with one or two exceptions, such as ""Live At City Center"") all scripted, in studio. There is a reason for this: Timing. A live audience can actually detract from a Python performance (as was evident in their Royal Command Performance).

This collection of Monty Python's ""live"" material is at best optimistically described and incomplete. While it does contain the live, and very funny ""Monty Python Live At The Hollywood Bowl"" and the not-quite-so-funny-and-missing-the-late-Graham Chapman ""Monty Python: Live In Aspen"" it does not contain the Royal Command Performance at the Albert Hall from 1973, released on the Midnight Movie Circuit here in the U.S. in 1980 as ""Monty Python Meets Beyond The Fringe."" Nor does it contain any of the individual or collective member's contributions to the various ""Secret Policeman's Ball"" Amnesty International efforts. Don't get me wrong: ""...Meets Beyond The Fringe"" wasn't that good a show-- it was poorly filmed, badly recorded, and the audience was forever saying the punchlines of the scripts before the actors could finish their lines. But it WAS ""Monty Python Live"", warts and all, alternating sketches with Beyond The Fringe's Dudley Moore & Peter Cook.

And this is where it should have belonged: The studio-taped Steve Martin special and the German Monty Python episode are not live, and don't really belong in this collection, one gets the feeling they were slapped on disc 2 to fill it out and justify a 2-DVD set, instead of a single disc or videotape. If the people responsible were going to do it, they should have done it right, and packaged these dog-ends in another Box Set with the never-released ""Hastily Cobbled Together For A Quick Buck"" LP from 1981!",1253664000,,2109,5.07492795389049
420133,5,6302054249,"This is a must for all Python fans as it has their live performance from the Hollywood Bowl in 1982 and the anniversary gathering in Aspen, CO from the 1990's (?) where they brought Graham Chapman's ashes to be with them. It also has their long-time friend Neil Innes playing a couple of his songs. Neil was in several of Python's movies and was a good friend of George Harrison.",1241827200,,379,4.428571428571429
420134,2,6302054249,"I have wanted this item since I first saw it back in the 80's but it is extremely difficult to find. When I saw it on sale as a DVD collection I pulled the trigger quickly. However, I was quickly disappointed. I had assumed that transferring the video to DVD would have been an improvement on the audio and video capabilities of the shows but I was wrong. And on a HD TV the poor quality of the recording really stands out. I really enjoy Python sketches but I found myself getting bored and frustrated with the actual quality of the media itself.",1231286400,,547,4.320388349514563
420135,5,6302054249,"For a new Python fan, like myself, this DVD set would give you some of the best laughs! The Monty Python team are at it with live performances, interviews, sketches, and quite possibly a German lesson for you.

For me, this DVD was a birthday present and I got the best of my money out of it. At this price, it's a great buy!",1218585600,,325,4.078125
420136,5,6302054249,"One of the best Monty Python out there!

Great versions of classic skits, Shoot soda out your nose funny!",1211587200,,105,4.526315789473684
420137,3,6302054249,"For a huge fan of Monty Python, this is a must have for those who do not already own most of it. For the price it sells at, I was not worried that I already had ""Live At The Bowl"" or ""Fliegender Zirkus"" on DVD already. They have been available on DVD in Australia since DVD's first went on sale.

However, I can tell you that Flie-Zir may be of better quality then the the original DVD release, but, the Hollywood Bowl is about the same quality as the original crappy DVD transfer. I'd recommend also picking up the newer release that Sony have released. (may only currently be released in region 2&4)

The next is Steve Martin hosting a best of show called ""Parrot Skecth, not included"". Not exactly live tho, it shows the best bits of the Flying Circus. Decent to watch if you have never seen it before. But any python fan will just say it's cut up and trimmed down pieces of longer and funnier sketches.

The best is Live In Aspen... which is a 1998 reunion hosted by whats-his-name and it is just great to see the MP team on stage again, and still being able to pull off laughs as well as ever. Mostly it's interviews and bits of the show and movies, but it is highly entertaining and worth the price of purchase alone.

Also in the DVD's there are some bonus features of a few little sketches and weird bits. I can't really remember anything memorable in the bonus features, but you might find something you like.

- Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl ** (the other release is much clearer and sounds better then this one)

- Monty Python's Flying Circus: Live at Aspen ****

- Parrot Sketch Not Included: 20 Years of Python ***

- Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus: German Episode #1 **

Overall, purchase if you are a fan of MP and cant get enough of them. For myself I found tho some of it is disappointing in quality, but the Aspen show was worth the price of purchase alone.",1195084800,,1888,4.340909090909091
420138,4,6302054249,"This movie is a perfect introduction to Python ignoramae, given that it features many of their best bits, a few of their naughty bits, and some pleasurable musical numbers.  I could've done with more Neil Innes, fresh from his work as The Rutles; the brevity of time spent with his work pegs my review down a notch.  If only the film could have had Neil singing ""I Must Be In Love"" or ""Cheese & Onions"".  The troupe also integrated the audience into a few routines, which shows they could've toured if they wanted to, to great success.

A final note: this film is remarkable in that it features more of Terry Gilliam on camera (a good thing), and has Eric Idle singing ""The Lumberjack Song"", instead of Michael Palin (an interesting thing).  Eric's voice is better for the stage, whereas Michael seems to over-sing live (i.e., Concert For George).",1186358400,,847,4.657718120805369
420139,4,6302054249,"If you're a Python fan, you've probably seen all their TV episodes and their major feature films. This two-DVD set collects material you probably haven't seen, namely their concert film ""Live at the Hollywood Bowl"" and their early 1970s appearance on German television.

""Hollywood Bowl"" is a true treat from the middle 1970s. By this time, Monty Python were bonafide celebrities and it's a thrill to see them perform so many of their best sketches in front of a live and supportive audience. I greatly prefer their performances here to their earlier renditions on their TV show - like all great teams they had gotten better with both experience and time. All the Pythons are especially self-confident as performers here, and as a bonus we have a couple of musical numbers courtesy of Neil Innes. I especially enjoyed the irreverent sketch where John Cleese plays the Pope.

The German Episode hasn't aged nearly as well. There's some good material (especially a mock-documentary about Albrecht Durer) but it's hampered by poor video quality. Honestly, the entire thing looks like it was filmed in Super 8 and the constant subtitling doesn't help matters. It looks like a third generation bootleg. The best of the sequences also appear (in considerably higher quality) in ""Hollywood Bowl."" You do get ""The Lumberjack Song"" sung in German, however. And it is a kick hearing Graham Chapman speak German with a thick American accent.

The remainder of the discs contain ""20 Years of Monty Python,"" a greatest-hits style program hosted by Steve Martin, and a group interview conducted by Robert Klein. It's fun for completists.

Still, ""Hollywood Bowl"" is the real draw and its a pleasure to see it on a reasonably priced DVD with extras.",1135036800,6,1734,4.989619377162629
420140,5,6302054249,"So, we have two live performances, a best-of type compilation, and a German episode in German.

Live at the Hollywood Boal has always looked like it was done on a $10 budget. It looks no better here. It's still VERY funny, and our only complete document of a live Python show.

The Aspen Comedy appearance is superb, a great reunion and interview with many new and hysterical bits. This is probably the final time all five will get together and really be fun.

The ""Parrot Sketch Not Included"" compilation has some good Steve Martin bits, and a final appearance of all six members together, shortly before the death of Graham Chapman. There's really not much more to reccomend to this.

Then there's the German episode #1. This is perhaps one of the best Monty Python shows ever, with somply great writing, a very brisk pace, almost no filler, and a great appearance by John Cleese as Little Red Riding Hood. This is the episode I turn to when I feel down, and it's inclusion is perhaps one of the best things that A&E has accomplished with their wonderful re-issues of all things Python. Very, very good.

All in all, a good set to own.",1123545600,3,1137,4.553921568627451
420171,5,6302054249,"...but nothing can be said about the quality of material contained within these DVD's.

The first of the four main programs in this set is the Pythons' live performance at the Hollywood Bowl in the early 80's. It's a performance so intimate that you feel that you're actually in the audience watching the sketches take place, which are of high quality. I had never seen this show before I bought the DVD, and I was not dissapointed. Also on the first disk is an interview titled ""Live in Aspen."" This is not neccessarily a Python show, but it does bring the 5 surviving Pythons (and the 1 non-surviving Python) together on stage again. The program can be informative, but for the most part, it's hysterical. I'm not going to spoil anything for you (if you haven't had it spoiled for you already).

Disk 2 is where things start getting Not-So-Live. Not in the sense that the title implies, anyway. However, the ""20 years of Monty Python"" program that is present on here is probably the best thing to come out of these DVD's. It's consistently hilarious, and great for folks who are not particularly familiar with the TV show. (the end of the program is pretty cool as well). Also there is an entire Monty Python's Flying Circus episode on here. The catch? It was filmed for German TV. My personal opinion is that the episode is above average, but the enjoyment of the program is probably brought down by the fact that you have to read subtitles for 45 minutes straight. I guess this counts as more of a special feature, though.

If there's any problem with this set, it's that some sketches are repeated throughout the four programs. It gets tedious to go through them over and over again. However, getting so much great stuff for under $20 can never be a bad thing.",1123027200,,1765,4.579113924050633
420172,4,6302054249,"just one complaint but it's a big one.  under the blurb on the hollywood bowl it states clearly that the ""incomparable parrot sketch"" is one performed along with the lumberjack song and the philosophers song.  the only reason i bought the set was for the parrot sketch.  CAVEAT EMPTOR---THE PARROT SKETCH IS NOT ON EITHER DISC! there is about a 2 minute clip of the parrot sketch included in the aspen part of disc 1.  but that is all.  terribly disappointed not to have the parrot sketch!  but there is a bit in the aspen discussion group involving GRAHAM CHAPMAN'S ASHES that is worth the price of the 2-disc set.  i saw it on tv when it initially aired and laughed probably as hard as i did the first time i heard the parrot sketch.  when i saw it these 5 years later i was surprised that i laughed just as hard and as long as i did the first time. you have to see it to believe it.
just be aware of what you are and are not getting.  would have given it 5 plus stars if the parrot sketch were included.",1077667200,,1006,4.170984455958549
420173,4,6302054249,"More English humour. You will undoubtedly laugh at some jokes and antics. You will smile at most of them too. Monty Python is always the same group of weirdos who respect nothing and make fun of everything that is sacred in everyday life in England : the Queen of course, but gently ; the police, a little less gently ; the church definitely less gently ; and things like chocolates that contain dead frogs to make them crunchy or some other disgusting things like cockroaches or whatever including some vomit. They cannot resist comparing American beer with ditch water and there they are definitely right, and that explains probably why so many sportsmen in one sketch start a race by ending up in the toilet. Too much of that beer is not good at all for the bladder. We learn that Descartes wrote  I drink therefore I am  which is definitely French in inspiration and tone. But lumberjacks are also ridiculed, with a lumberjack who wears a bra, for instance. English judges are of course revealed as being effeminate, which is in complete phase with the fact that they wear wigs : you should see their nice and colourful underwear. Try Monty Python at least once or twice, but be careful with an overdose of that drug because you may become either bored or just mentally disoriented and corrugated.

420174,5,6302054249,"A&E has done a great service to Monty Python fans the world over by finally releasing rare, out of print, or otherwise unavailable Python material.

Disc # 1 starts with Monty Python Live At The Hollywood Bowl.  The group opens with the song ""Sit On My Face"" wearing long aprons and, when they turn to go off stage, reveal their bare buttocks!  This is followed by Graham Chapman, playing Colin 'Bomber' Harris, who wrestles himself to a pinfall.  The Crunchy Frog skit concerns the Whizzo Chocolate Company and their choice of chocolate-covered confectionaries, such as anthrax ripple and cockroach cluster.  This sketch is highlighted by Terry Gilliam throwing up in his policeman's hat and then being forced to wear the hat!  The Custard Pies sketch involves demonstrating the history of physical comedy with pratfalls and pie throwing, with Terry Jones getting the worst of it.  Truly, this is Monty Python at their subtle best.  The concert ends with a rousing version of the Lumberjack Song.  That concert is followed by Monty Python Live At Aspen, hosted by comedian Robert Klein.  The group members talk about their early days at the BBC and their transition into movies.  For their film work in particular, they receive an American Film Institute Star Award.  Since this show was taped in 1998, Graham Chapman sadly had passed away.  An urn supposedly containing his ashes represents him and also gets the biggest laughs at the event!

Disc #2 starts with a 1989 retrospective of the group, hosted by Steve Martin.  Steve talks about Monty Python for a few minutes, followed by an hour of sketches from their classic TV series.  This is very much a hit or miss affair, as some of their weaker skits are included and some of their best sketches are not shown in their entirety.  Steve Martin appears at the end of the hour, opens a door to find the Pythoners huddled in a closet, and then promptly shuts the door on them.  That retrospective is followed by Monty Python's German Episode #1.  Apparently, German TV paid for the Pythoners to perform two episodes of their series in Germany!  Naturally, the sketches are in German with English subtitles.  It's surreal to hear the Lumberjack Song sung in German!  Some of this footage appears in various collections, particularly the Olympic events and the Little Red Riding Hood sketch.  It's great to finally see the 45 minute German show in its entirety.  For completists, Monty Python's German Episode #2 is included in A&E's ""The Life Of Python"" boxed set.  With 2 DVDs clocking in at 4 1/2 hours, ""Monty Python Live!"" is an essential addition to every Python fan's collection.",1070755200,38,2637,4.858744394618834
420175,5,6302054249,"This collection of odds, ends, and live performances will be appreciated mostly by die-hard Monty Python fans (like myself.) It contains on disc one ""Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl"" and the famous 1998 Aspen Reunion, and on disc 2 ""Parrot Sketch Not Included"" (hosted by Steve Martin) and the first German episode.
""Hollywood Bowl"" is the Woodstock of Python concerts. It is extremely funny, and has some lesser known works like the Lecture in Comedy and several Neil Innes songs. The Aspen Reunion doesn't seem as spontaneous as it should, but has some interesting facts and some funny moments, and its great to see the elderly Pythons together on stage for the first time in many years. ""Parrot Sketch Not Included"" was released on video several years ago, and I watched it many times. Don't miss the very funny final segment (after the end credits). And the German show is...well, it has its moments.
DVD quality varies. The German show and Hollywood Bowl performance look grainy, the Aspen Reunion is broadcast quality, and ""Parrot Sketch Not Included"" generally looks a bit soft. The disc includes as special features some clips from the Flying Circus shows, ""Pythonisms"", and troupe filmographies.",1046217600,,1212,5.034825870646766
420176,5,6302054249,"Monty Python Live must have been such a treat to those lucky people you see at the beginning of the show, anxiously entering the Hollywood Bowl.  It is certainly a treat for anyone who watches this DVD at home.  The boys revive their classic sketches, from the Lumberjack Song to Sit on My Face to Crunchy Frog, as only they can.
In Disc One of this 2 DVD set, the boys are in perfect form, and the live element to this show makes it even more entertaining.  They feed off the audience's reactions, and the audience (and you) find themselves reciting every line along with the cast.  It is a really fun time!
The Aspen special also included on the first DVD is a tribute to the Monty Python cast as significant contributors to the world of comedy.  Even the late Graham Chapman makes an appearance...in a funny fake urn...and the rest of the guys have a ball reminiscing about old times and old sketches, yukking it up with the host and the audience.
The second DVD includes ""20 Years of Python, a compilation special hosted briefly by Steve Martin.  It features clips from all of the most famous sketches from the TV series.  The second DVD also features a special episode written specially for German/Austrian audiences (""Fliegander Zirkus"").

If you are new to Monty Python, this is a great DVD set to experience their skits. One thing though, not much in the way of bonus stuff, at least nothing I was too impressed with....but so what, Live at the Hollywood  Bowl is just amazing! I have been waiting for this for a long time. Also, the transfer is fine, no problems. Sound is great. It is tough to review a comedy team for people who are not familiar with that group, and for those who are, you probably bought this already. The second DVD is not as great, but Hollywood Bowl is worth the price and more! There are too many skits to mention, but if you have any kind of sense of humor you'll find at least a couple of things that make you laugh. My favorite are the candy skit and the philospher sing along. They are very funny! Of course, the argument skit is also great....I could go on and on.....

420178,4,6302054249,"I loved the whole thing, Live at Aspen, Not Included and even The German Show but I felt that the Live at the Hollywood Bowl featured on it left out some parts. I mean I've never seen it anywhere else but it does seem to jump about like some parts were cut out. I still loved the whole thing but some things were better done on TV like the Silly Walk Sketch and the Socialist Game Show. Live in Aspen was a riot though seeing them all old made me kind of depressed but Micheal Palin aged quite well! Having Graham Chapman ""show up"" really made me laugh expecially Terry Gilliam's ""accident"". 20 years of Python was superb but Steve Martin [ticked] me off very badly. He tried too hard to be funny and he failed. Why didn't he just show the sketches? Anyone who actually watched that program probibly wasn't there for stupid Steve Martin. Seeing Graham so sick also made me sad and depressed but not for long because I just went back to the mosquito hunting sketch and laughed and laughed. dear god if you like Monty Python at all buy this DVD set. I don't have stock in A&E really I don't. I just want you to buy it because it is good. really.",1018137600,,1143,4.247706422018348
420179,4,6302054249,"The single most common praise one hears from a critical review is: ""If you only have one DVD/album/book by [Insert a well-known author here], make it this one!""
For Monty Python, this could labelled on this DVD set.
Much of the criticism of this package is it's inclusion of 'Dead Parrot Sketch Not Included' (a greatest hits compilation of their [arguably] finest work from 'The Flying Circus' television show). I think it's inclusion is a strength -- It's the Python equivalent of the Beatles '1' record: Yes, there are ommisions, but it's nevertheless a very decent well-rounded collection.
The contrary position is certainly understandable. If you bought the entire series on DVD, then 'Dead Parrot' is a pointless addition. However, if you can watch the Architect sketch, the lumberjack song, Salad Days and the communist game show in one sitting, it wouldn't be anything less than a holy disc.
But what's missing is certainly made up on the very funny Hollywood Bowl performance. 'Nudge, Nudge,' 'The Bruces,' 'The Philosopher's Song,' 'Crunchy Frog' -- much of the classics 'Dead Parrot' seemed to forget is redeemed here. Unfortunately, the film quality is a bit aged, but still very viewable.
The Aspen reunion is an insightful retrospective on Python, from it's history to the behind-the-scenes information on their famous sketches.
So there you have it. A complete collection of their essential work ('Dead Parrot'), a live performance ('Hollywood Bowl'), and biographical information ('Aspen').
Viking Press publishes their popular 'Portable' series, books of famous authors containing their most crucial writings alongside critical & biographical annotations (i.e. 'The Portable Kerouac,' 'The Portable Nietzsche'). Likewise, this is the 'Portable Monty Python.' It's a shame that A&E didn't market it that way.",1017619200,17,1824,5.4035087719298245
420230,3,6302054249,"I bow to no one in my devotion to Monty Python, but I do have a few concerns about this set. First, the film quality for ""Live at the Hollywood Bowl"" is terrible and in dire need of restoration. Second, truth in advertising: only two of four pieces on this set are live, and ""Live at Aspen"" is more of an interview/retrospective than a performance. The second disc, containing the ""Parrot Sketch Not Included"" retrospective and Episode 1 of ""Monty Pythons Fliegender Zirkus"", has nothing live to it at all. Third, one unfortunate result of the selection on these discs is that certain filmed pieces, done for the German episodes and recycled for ""Live at the Hollywood Bowl"", appear as many as three times in the set, which makes consecutive viewing a bit maddening. Having said that, the first German episode has always been one of my favorites, one I'm glad to have on DVD, and I've enjoyed audio recordings of live Python concerts, so I do like having ""Live at the Hollywood Bowl"", whatever the quality.",1012780800,12,1006,4.6892655367231635
420231,4,6302054249,"I only give the set 4 stars because the Parrot Sketch Not Included special is terrible. Steve Martin is overly obnoxious as the host. The only thing good thing in it is the last appearance of all the Python troupe. It's a bit sad, Graham Chapman doesn't look well at all. He passed away not long after the 'Not Included' show was produced.
The other stuff is terrific!
Hollywood bowl is great fun. The Hollywood bowl Whizzo Chocolate sketch is far funnier than the TV version. The  picture quality does leave something to be desired. However, a good remaster/restoration of a film, both picture & sound, costs hundreds of thousands, even millions, of dollars. The expenditure is justified on something like Star Wars or Lawrence of Arabia or My Fair Lady because the studio can, at the very least, do a limited theatrical re-release of the film and sell enough videos & DVDs to recover costs. I'm sure these Python DVDs aren't selling millions of copies. The less than perfect quality didn't detract from my enjoyment of the show.
The Live at Aspen is terrific fun, too. It's nice to see the surviving Pythons on stage together having a good time. Graham Chapman's 'appearance' on stage is very funny, and a little shocking, too.
The 1st German episode is nice. The subtitles are a bit annoying, but I don't think a version of the show without the ugly subtitles exist. Still, it's nice to have it on DVD, unedited. The only other showing it's had in the US is on Comedy Central. There were some edits there to allow more commercials, though. That broadcast was 5 or 6 years ago and it doesn't look as if it will be shown on TV again soon.
All in all, a good set for the Python fan. If you can get past the imperfect quality of the Hollywood Bowl show & the German episode, and just sit back and laugh, you'll get your money's worth.",1012521600,7,1833,4.521084337349397
420232,4,6302054249,"OK, I'd like to use this review of the (probably) final entry in the A&E Monty Python DVD line to spout off about A&E's treatment of this classic series.
First of all, thanks to A&E for releasing the original Flying Circus shows in chronological order. That's an improvement over video/laserdisc releases in the past.
BUT, don't buy A&E's claim that the shows are unedited. That is totally untrue. Several of the shows, particularly in the third season, are missing sketches. And this series presents the censored version of The Summarize Proust Competition sketch -- fans will now the famous controversy behind the sketch.
Also, I love DVD extras, but I'd take a bare bones release over a DVD with worthless extras. And I would challenge anyone to find extras more pointless than the ones on ANY of the A&E Python discs. I don't blame A&E if they sought assistance from any of the Pythons and they were unavailable, but I do blame A&E for the absolute stupidity of these extras. Obviously they are meant to be ""pythonesque,"" but they are simply moronic...Now for the Life of Python and Monty Python Live releases. Again, kudos to A&E for making this material available. But again the releases make little or no sense. Here is what they should have done:
Life of Python should commemorate anniversary specials:
Disc 1 -- same; Disc 2 -- Life of Python (documentary done at 20-year anniversary, which is still unreleased on DVD) and Parrot Sketch Not Included, which was complied for their 20th anniversary.
Monty Python Live:
Single Disc set with Hollywood Bowl and US Comedy Arts Festival (don't get me started on the horrible Bowl transfer A&E has put out).
German episodes:
Single Disc set with both shows. Why one is on a ""live"" DVD makes no sense.
Hopefully some day another distributor will get involved in this priceless material and do it justice, maybe with cooperation from the Pythons. Until now, this is what we have. And as great as the content is, the horrible presentation is inexcusable.",1011225600,4,2003,4.8425655976676385

The interview is interesting since I didn't catch it on TV originally and, yes, I even like having ""Parrot Sketch Not Included"".
But it's not vital unless you feel like being a completist.  With the exception of the Hollywood Bowl show, it's not even a particularly good introduction to Python.
But to spite all that, I like it.",1010534400,,537,4.583333333333333
420235,2,6302054249,"Synopsis: no apparent effort on behalf of A&E has been spent on this DVD. It is a great disappointment, the only consolation being mere presence of Live at Hollywood Bowl, and the Aspen interview.
These DVD's leave you with a feeling that A&E just didn't bother putting too much effort into them.
First off, neither one of the two DVDs has subtitles. And with the quality of acoustics of this Live at Hollywood Bowl recording, believe me, you will feel the need for them at times. The first simply doesn't have them, while though the second DVD allows you to set English subtitles, they appear to be either 100% transparent, or 0% opaque.
The choice of material is also quite questionable. While it's great to finally have Live at Hollywood Bowl, it's obvious that it's suffered a letterbox conversion - the ""built-in"" subtitles (prerecorded ones) are chopped off at the sides, during the Bruces' Beer song. The recording looks like it was directly taken off of a VHS tape.
The Aspen interview is a great piece to have, and has very presentable quality - probably the only recording without flaws (except for lack of subtitles).
Parrot Sketch Not Included is a rather daft ""Greatest Hits"" bit, basically a continuous bunch of snippets from Flying Circus, and features a very bland and distasteful intro by Steve Martin. Even if one ignores its obvious misplacement (it's not live, and features a 5-second shot [literally] of the Pythons, including Graham Chapman's last appearance), this is nothing the average Python fan hasn't seen, and is nothing but filler.
The German Episode.... Much has been said about A&E's mishandling of these episodes... Not enough, in my opinion. First the obvious - episode 1 does not belong on a Live DVD - for one thing it's not live. Second - it would have been much better to subtitle them properly (""hidden"" DVD subtitle format, and NOT permanently altered video). Both episodes (the other one is part of A&E's documentary, and is not on this DVD) would have been much more appropriate as part of the Flying Circus collection.
Back to my original point - these DVDs look like a bad prototype. At least I hope that's what I got (hardly). The extras are hardly useful at all (they're just snippets of FC and usual FC collection biographies). The DVD introduction animation is straight off of the Flying Circus collection, yet another indication of how much effort A&E has spent on this item. The DVD is a significant disappointment, and the only reason I'm giving it two stars is because Live at the Hollywood Bowl finally made it onto a DVD. Also, the Aspen interview presents some interesting insights (as well as a little Python humor on the side). PSNI is practically useless, and the German episode.... well... it's good to have, but it just doesn't belong here.",1010448000,15,2800,4.8232848232848236
420236,3,6302054249,"What wankers!  Like the Life of Python set, here is another bloated two DVD set, so you will spend twice the cash.

Features the classic Live at the Hollywood Bowl movie, though the transfer seems rather lazy.  Well, I guess you are not gonna watch it for the picture quality anyway, but at least they could try.  Then, there is the Live at Aspen interview, if you didn't catch it on HBO a couple of years ago.  A nice extra, I guess, but hardly a main reason to purchase.  Features classic snipets of old Python stuff, that you, since you are already a fan, already have seen.

The second CD has Parrot Sketch Not Included, 20 years of Python, a ""greatest hits"" from the TV series, made for Showtime 12 years ago.  Since you are probably already a fan who may have the TV series DVD, this is pretty pointless filler.  Parrot Sketch not Included should have been a stand alone release, for the more casual fan who does not want to purchase all the DVDs.  Features unnecessary introduction from Steve Martin, and a short shot of the ""troupe"" (thereby the rationale of it being a ""live"" performance) before Graham Chapman died.  Then the rest of the DVD is the first Monty Python German Episode.  More creative Python silliness.  How come the two German episodes were not released on the same DVD? ... other than to try to validate the existance of both Life of Python and Monty Python Live DVD collections.

Monty Python should be ashamed (Can't blame Graham Chapman thou... he is long dead).",1009497600,12,1491,4.556390977443609
420237,4,6302054249,"This set is typical of A&E's handling of the Pythons. Just stick the basics on a set and expect everyone to buy it because they can't get it anywhere else. Obviously the Hollywood Bowl film is great and worth getting but the other features are lacking. The Aspen is show is pretty good, but there's not really much new there and if you've seen Life Of Python you aren't missing much. The German episode is good, but is far less funny than the second German episode. The documentary with Steve Martin is VERY weak, as I think he's only on screen for maybe five minutes. It's only real purpose is to show the last thing the original Pythons ever did together-a five second clip of them sitting in a closet- filmed only a few weeks before Graham Chapman died. The second disc would have been much better suited for their skits from the secret policeman's balls, but maybe their saving that for yet ANOTHER padded 2 disc set. If you can get this cheap((...) range) it's worth picking up.",1008288000,12,983,4.4972067039106145
420238,3,6302054249,"A&E continues their bizarre treatment of Python material once again.  It's great to put together Hollywood Bowl and the Aspen reunion show to constitute a ""live"" title, but the German episode (which should have been on the lacking Life Of Python disc 2) and ""Parrot"" shouldn't even be on this set.  Some Secret Policemen's Ball bits would have been more appropriate, but I'm sure there's a rights issue there. As for ""Parrot"": is it worth paying 2-disc price for clips you've seen and a 5-second gag of all 6 pythons from 1989?  A&E should have taken the redundant clips off their Complete Series discs and just added the original bits from ""Parrot.""  Oh well, I still bought it all anyway.",1005264000,,690,4.725

Should be pretty worthwhile - have always enjoyed the Bowl film simply for the greatest hits of the Flying Circus combined with the energy and audience interaction of the live show.  Hopefully we'll get some interesting extras as well!  The reunion will be interesting to see, as I missed it at the time, but always enjoyed Cleese's statement that ""There
will be no Monty Python reunion as long as Graham Chapman insists on remaining dead.""

If you're new to Monty Python, this set is a great way to dive in, and get a taste of all things Python. As a fan of the show, and the movies, I am not disappointed with this set. One thing to keep in mind is that it was NOT recorded yesterday, so film and audio quality are not what many are used to by today's standards. So what? If you really do enjoy the material, the quality of the recordings won't be an issue. Not that it's worth whining about, you don't miss anything, it's just not in HD. So what?
