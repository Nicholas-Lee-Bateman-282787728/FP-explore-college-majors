8092605,4,B000BTJD4O,"RAW's New Year's Revolution:
This was the WWE's first ever PPV in the republic of Puerto Rico as the World Heavyweight Championship was declared vacant due to a controversial ending to a championship match weeks earlier resulting in the main event to determine a new champion be held inside the Elimination Chamber in Triple H vs. Edge vs. Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho vs. Batista vs. Randy with the wild card being Shawn Michaels as the special referee who had past & present issues with everyone involved in the match along with the fact that Triple H & Batista had a game plan for Triple H regain the championship but would Batista follow through with the plan?  Other matches include Jerry Lawler with Jim Ross in his corner against Muhammed Hassan with Davari in his corner, Kane vs. Gene Snitsky, Intercontinental Champion Shelton Benjamin vs. Maven...twice, Womens Champion Lita vs. Trish Stratus, and World Tag Team Champions Eugene & William Regal vs. Christian & Tyson Tomko.

Royal Rumble:
This Royal Rumble as usual was highlighted by the traditional Royal Rumble match that had it's share of moments such as the first two superstars to start, Daniel Puder being the victim of a chopping contest, the tease of a dream match that fans had been waiting on, the one superstar that everyone was able to unite against, RAW vs. SmackDown ""West Side Story"" rumble in the middle of the match, and the final two & controversial ending including what happened to Mr. McMahon in the process.  World Champion Triple H defended the championship against Randy Orton in a one on one contest with Evolution banned from ringside, WWE Champion J.B.L. vs. Kurt Angle vs. Big Show that saw the action both in & outside of the ring along with the allies of everyone getting involved as well, Undertaker vs. Heidenrich in a Casket Match that saw not only a creepy alliance formed but also the reunion of brothers with common enemies, Shawn Michaels looking for revenge against the man who cost him a World Championship match months earlier at Taboo Tuesday in Edge, and this wasn't a match but I had to mention the entertaining backstage skits between Ric Flair & Eddie Guerrero in regards to a stolen entry number.

SmackDown's No Way Out:
WWE Champion J.B.L. defended his championship against Big Show in the first ever Barbed Wire Steel Cage match that saw both men bleeding & an ending that I've never seen before or since in a steel cage match but that wasn't the only problem J.B.L. had as RAW's Batista made it clear he was going to be at the PPV to confront him for all the attacks & comments made towards him in previous weeks.  Other matches include John Cena vs. Kurt Angle with the winner challenging the WWE Champion at WrestleMania, Undertaker vs. Luther Reigns, WWE Tag Team Champions Basham Brothers vs. Eddie Guerrero & Rey Mysterio, Booker T vs. Heidenreich, a crusierweight open elimination match for the Crusierweight Title, and a Rookie Diva Of The Year competition beign held throughout the night hosted by Torrie Wilson & Dawn Marie.

WrestleMania 21:
""WrestleMania Goes Hollywood"" was the theme for this WrestleMania which was reflected throughout the night but this Mania was mostly remembered for WWE establishing the two new top faces of their company for years to come. World Champion Triple H with Motorhead performing him to the ring vs. Batista in a match where one man was beaten into a bloody crimson mask.  WWE Champion J.B.L. complete with a presidential motorcade entrance defending the title against John Cena in what's memorable for the beginning of John Cena becoming the face of WWE despite the match itself being the worst WWE Championship match in WrestleMania history. This event also marked the debut of the ""Money In The Bank"" Ladder Match in Edge vs. Chris Benoit vs. Christian vs. Chris Jericho vs. Kane vs. Shelton Benjamin that started off with the ladders on the stage being set on fire followed up by non-stop action with Shelton Benjamin being the ""human highlight reel."" Other matches include Shawn Michaels vs. Kurt Angle in a dream match that stole the show, ""Legend vs. Legend Killer"" as Randy Orton attempted to end the streak of Undertaker, Womens Champion Trish Stratus vs. Christy Hemme, a Sumo Match with Big Show vs. Akebono. Also on the show was the WrestleMania return of Hulk Hogan & a special Piper's Pit featuring the return of ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin.
DVD extras include all of the ""WrestleMania Goes Hollywood"" movie parodies they did including outtakes, commercial spots for the main event matches, special career highlight features on Kurt Angle & Shawn Michaels & Undertaker, two ""Confidential"" pieces on the WrestleMania weekend & media appearances, and Motorhead doing a backstage ""unplugged"" performance. Included as well is the COMPLETE Hall Of Fame ceremony featuring Cowboy Bob Orton, Nikolai Volkoff, Jimmy Hart, Iron Sheik, Paul Orndorff, Roddy Piper, and actor Sylvester Stallone inducting Hulk Hogan.

RAW's Backlash:
Hulk Hogan returned to WWE a month earlier at WrestleMania with the fans chanting for ""One More Match"" which they got here as he teamed with Shawn Michaels to face off against Muhammed Hassan & Davari in what was a very entertaining match.  Triple H's WrestleMania rematch happened here as Batista defended the championship against him here in a match that topped their previous WrestleMania match.  Chris Benoit was out for revenge for what happened at WrestleMania facing off against Edge in a Last Man Standing match that was so physical that it took more than just physical punishment to take & keep one man down.  Other matches include Intercontinental Champion Shelton Benjamin vs. Chris Jericho in a very athletic contest, Kane vs. Viscera, and a tag team turmoil gauntlet match for the World Tag Team Championship.

SmackDown's Judgment Day:
WWE Champion John Cena, complete with his new spinner championship belt, defended his title against J.B.L., with the previous WWE Championship belt, in an ""I Quit"" match that was a very bloody brawl that saw them start in the ring & end up on the outside to stage area destroying anything they could get their hands on.  Rey Mysterio faced off against Eddie Guerrero who started to show a more darker side & physically violent side of himself who showed he was out to punish Rey more than just score a victory.  Kurt Angle had been stalking & making unwanted advances towards Booker T's wife Sharmell for weeks on end resulting in this match that saw a more aggressive side of Booker.  Other matches include WWE Tag Team Champions MNM vs. Hardcore Holly & Charlie Hass, Big Show vs. Carlito with his new bodyguard Matt Morgan, Crusierweight Champion Paul London vs. Chavo Guerrero, and United States Champion Orlando Jordan vs. Heidenreich.

ECW One Night Stand:
After the highly successful sales of the ""Rise & Fall Of ECW"" DVD, WWE held a reunion show for ECW called One Night Stand from the site of the final ECW PPV in Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City. Matches include Lance Storm's retirement match vs. Chris Jericho who returned to his days of ""Lionheart"", Rey Mysterio vs. Psychosis in a match where the crowd make it clear that they weren't happy with which version of Mysterio appeared, Super Crazy vs. Tajiri vs. Little Guido, Sabu vs. Rhyno, Chris Benoit vs. Eddie Guerrero, Masato Tanaka vs. Mike Awesome in the match that stole the show & had everyone talking afterwords, and Tommy Dreamer & Sandman vs. Dudley Boyz.  Special appearances were made throughout the night by ECW alumni such as the bWo, Bill Alfonzo & Rob Van Dam, Kid Kash, Balls Mahoney & Axl Rotten, Al Snow & Head, the biggest gathering of F.B.I. members in ECW history, Joel Gertner, Mikey Whipwreck & the Sinister Minister, Spike Dudley, Justin Credible, Jason, Francine, Beulah, Pitbull #2, Danny Doring & Roadkill, ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin, Taz, and Paul Heyman along with ""anti-ECW"" crusaders watched from the balcony including Eric Bischoff & J.B.L. & Edge & Kurt Angle.
DVD extras include comments from the fans before the event, all the commercials & superstar spotlights featuring Tommy Dreamer & Sandman & Sabu & Rob Van Dam & Dudley Boyz, highlights from the ECW funeral on RAW, and a ""J.B.L. alternative commentary"" feature in which J.B.L. was miked throughout the event as you just hear the comments from him & those around him.

RAW's Vengeance:
The third & final encounter between Triple H & Batista occurred inside Hell In A Cell that saw things get very bloody & hardcore with weapons such as a biker chain, a barbed wire wrapped steel chair, and the ringside steps.  WWE Champion John Cena came over from SmackDown via the draft lottery to defend his championship against Chris Jericho & the man who had been calling him out for months in Christian in a fun triple threat match.  The draft lottery also saw Kurt Angle arrive to RAW & immediately challenge to a WrestleMania rematch against Shawn Michaels in a match that matched the instant classic quality as their previous one.  Other matches include Kane looking for revenge against Kane with Lita in his corner, Intercontinental Champion Carlito vs. Shelton Benjamin, and Christy Hemme vs. Victoria.

SmackDown's Great American Bash:
World Champion Batista was the final pick for SmackDown in the draft lottery & defended his title against J.B.L. in a match that was below the quality of encounters that we had seen Batista in with the previous encounters he had on RAW.  Despite the main event being the for the World Championship, the match that this event was remembered for was Undertaker taking on Muhammed Hassan in a #1 contenders match in Hassan's first appearance in weeks after a controversial incident on SmackDown that resulting in WWE killing off his character in this match.  Other matches include Rey Mysterio vs. Eddie Guerrero with Eddie threatening to tell an important secret in regards to Rey's son Dominic if Rey lost, Road Warrior Animal returning to team with Heidenreich against WWE Tag Team Champions MNM, Booker T vs. Christian, United States Champion Orlando Jordan vs. Chris Benoit, Torrie Wilson vs. Melina in a Bra & Panties match, and the Mexicools vs. the bWo.

SummerSlam:
""Legend vs. Icon"" was the main event here as Hulk Hogan faced off against Shawn Michaels in a match that's more remembered for all the backstage politics that resulted in them attempting to turn Shawn ""heel"" just for this match & Hogan's offense being heavily oversold throughout the match.  World Champion Batista returned to his hometown of Washington D.C. to defend the championship once again against J.B.L. in a No Holds Barred match that saw ""the animal unleashed"" including a powerbomb that J.B.L. has gone on record stated shortened his career.  The issues between Rey Mysterio & Eddie Guerrero in regards to Rey's adopted son Dominic got so out of control that the custody of him would be determined in a Ladder Match that not only saw both men take some hard falls but members of each family get involved.  Other matches include WWE Champion John Cena vs. Chris Jericho, Randy Orton vs. Undertaker, Kurt Angle vs. Eugene for Angle's Olympic Gold Medal that saw Angle be the most aggressive that we've seen in some time, Edge vs. Matt Hardy, and United States Champion Orlando Jordan vs. Chris Benoit.

RAW's Unforgiven:
Matt Hardy had some rough times from losing his long time girlfriend to getting fired for a period of time to not being able to continue the match against Edge at SummerSlam to both men being carted off in stretchers from their Street Fight, they met here once again in a Steel Cage match that saw blood & intense physical violence including Matt Hardy dropping the biggest legdrop in his career.  Other matches include WWE Champion John Cena vs. Kurt Angle, Shawn Michaels vs. Chris Masters, World Tag Team Champions Rosey & The Hurricade vs. Lance Cade & Trevor Murdock, Shelton Benjamin vs. Kerwin White, Big Show vs. Snitsky, Trish Stratus & Ashley Massaro vs. Victoria & Torrie Wilson, and Ric Flair vs. Intercontinental Champion Carlito.

SmackDown's No Mercy:
This was one of those PPV events that was remembered for all the wrong reasons as it was the final PPV appearance of Eddie Guerrero as he challenged World Champion Batista in a match where they recently became allies & tag partners together with Eddie fighting his old urges to ""lie & cheat"" throughout the entire match.  Undertaker went one on two against Randy Orton & his Hall Of Fame father ""Cowboy"" Bob Orton in a first ever handicap Casket Match that saw Undertaker battle both men alone while the Orton's resorted to some desperate tactics to keep getting an advantage with them doing whatever they could to not only win the match but also try to eliminate Undertaker forever.  Other matches include Rey Mysterio vs. J.B.L., United States Champion Chris Benoit vs. Booker T vs. Christian vs. Orlando Jordan, Road Warrior Animal & Heidenreich teaming with Christy Hemme vs. MNM & Melina, Mr. Kennedy vs. Hardcore Holly, Bobby Lashley vs. Simon Dean with Dean being forced to eat a dozen hamburgers if he lost, and Crusierweight Champion Nunzio vs. Juventud.

RAW's Taboo Tuesday:
This was the second edition of his event where the fans had a vote on each match.  WWE Champion John Cena defended his WWE Championship once again against Kurt Angle with Shawn Michaels being voted in as the third participant in a non-stop action triple threat match that saw the action that we've gotten before with Angle & HBK together.  Ric Flair had his wish fulfilled as the fans voted for his Intercontinental Championship to be defended in a steel cage against his former protege & Evolution ally in Triple H in what turned out a be a very bloody affair that not only saw the cage used as a weapon but others as such like a steel chair & chain.  The war between RAW vs. SmackDown happened here in two separate matches in SmackDown's Rey Mysterio & Matt Hardy vs. RAW's Chris Masters & Snitsky followed by a Street Fight Match in SmackDown's Batista vs. RAW's Johnathan Coachman who had both Goldust & Vader in his corner.  Other matches include Eugene & ""Superfly"" Jimmy Snuka vs. Rob Conway & Tyson Tomko, Mankind vs. Carlito, World Tag Team Champions Lance Cade & Trevor Murdock vs. Big Show & Kane, and a Divas Lingerie Battle Royal for the Womens Championship.

Survivor Series:
RAW vs. SmackDown continued on in three separate matches throughout the night including the traditional Survivor Series elimination match with Batista & Rey Mysterio & J.B.L. & Bobby Lashley & Randy Orton vs. Shawn Michaels & Kane & Big Show & Carlito & Chris Masters, Womens Champion Trish Stratus vs. Melina, and the General Managers facing off in Eric Bischoff vs. Teddy Long.  Triple H & Ric Flair continued their issues against each other here in a Last Man Standing Match that started before Flair even got his rob off & continued into another bloody brawl that saw one man resort to very desperate tactics to put & keep the other one down.  John Cena defended the WWE Championship against Kurt Angle with the special twist being Angle's new associate of Davari as the special guest referee in a match that got so out of control that it took an unexpected party to get involved & restore some order.  The United States Championship was declared vacant due to a controversy title match between Booker T & Chris Benoit resulting in both men revisiting their classic series from WCW 7 years earlier as they faced off here in match one of a ""best of 7 series.""

SmackDown's Armageddon:
Undertaker & Randy Orton faced off in the final match of their feud in a Hell In A Cell Match that saw both men bleeding & using whatever they could to inflict punishment from the cell to other weapons like the ringside steps, steel chair, a table, and ""Cowboy"" Bob Orton himself on the outside.  Other matches include RAW's World Tag Team Champions Big Show & Kane vs. SmackDown's WWE Tag Team Champions Rey Mysterio & Batista, Booker T going for the clean sweep of Chris Benoit in Match 4 of the ""Best Of Seven Series"", Mexicools vs. MNM, J.B.L. vs. Matt Hardy, Crusierweight Champion Juventud vs. Kid Kash, and Bobby Lashley vs. William Regal & Paul Burchill in a handicap match.

2005 was definately a year of change for WWE as they attempted so many different things with some passing & failing such as new main event stars in John Cena & Batista, Hulk Hogan once again returning to the company only to once again leave a bad taste in their mouths, the beginning of ECW's resurrection, the controversial Muhammed Hassan & Davari, the first time there was a true war between the RAW & SmackDown brands, and life imitating art in Matt Hardy vs. Edge.  The the shows themselves were questionable as only a handful of events were memorable & quality events while a majority of the others had some good matches but were unfortunately clouded with a bunch of unimportant & bad fillers to skip over.  The best events from this year were Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, Backlash, One Night Stand, Vengeance, Taboo Tuesday, and Survivor Series which is around half of the year so unless you were a fan of this year, I would recommend finding the PPV events individually.",1378252800,,17231,4.86118690313779

ok.... i am going to name the best actual WRESTLERS of all time, and im not talking about being having more championships.

1: kurt angle: the american hero, best skilled mat wrestler of all time, he has the most wrestling skills

2: chris benoit: the wolverne, highly skilled mat wrestler almost as good as kurt angle.

3: Triple H: cerebral assassain, he knows ever strategy there is to know about wrestling, knows every counter, can fight anyone with having a close fight.

4: Shawn michaels: hbk, the showstopper, his will to win is like no other, also has great mat skills also has high flying skills.

5: Bret hart: hitman, highly skilled mat wrestler very good with submissions, would like to see him vs. kurt angle.

6: Eddie guerrero: highly skilled mat wreslter, almost even with benoit, had trouble with other things tho, like drugs and his temper.

7: The undertaker: the deadman, he knows ever ring trick there is, highly respected wrestler, finds other ways to win becides his finisher

8:Brock lesnar: here comes the pain, i know it's crazy but he has very good mat skills, and he's a powerhouse

9: The rock: the ppls champ, above average ring skills, great will to win.

10: chris jericho: y2j, has highly good mat skills, also has high flying skills.

Many of you would question why i wouldn't put the names of stone cold, hulk hogan, ric flair, harly race, kane, and others. the answer is : these wrestlers don't have that great of mat skills (actual wrestling) don't get me wrong i like the other styles, but im talking about actual wrestling.",1154476800,,2378,4.711165048543689

You're going to save more than $150. The package comes with 15 DVD's. The DVD's are held in by a cardboard version of Cena's belt, which is pretty spiffy. All in all this is definately a better deal than buying all the 2005 DVD's individually, and the box is made out of pretty good material. The only negative would be having to buy DVD's you don't want such as the Great American Bash.",1142553600,8,555,4.245283018867925
