4263145,5,B0045KF754,"I happened to see The Perfect Stranger on television. I was so impressed I checked around to find out what was available. I ordered the Perfect Triple Feature. It did not let me down.
I am so impressed with these movies. They make me feel so close to The Perfect Stranger. If I'm feeling blue or depressed I can watch one of these movies and I'm back to my old self.
Really worth every penny I spent for the Triple Feature.
If you have any doubts about the existence of God and Jesus this should put all of those doubts to rest. Powerfully done to answer many, many questions about the existence of God.",1326153600,14,603,4.298245614035087

4263148,5,B0045KF754,"Every had trouble understanding what Christianity is REALLY all about or why there are some many differences of opinion, or why so many religions claim to be THE only real one, it's all addressed in these. In very different ways, the series covers all of the real details. The subject of wars, why there's evil in the world, why good people have to suffer. It's all here. Also the best explanation of the Trinity I've ever come across. Amazingly well made, especially when you consider the budgets and intentional refrain from going Hollywood. Believable dialog and true to life circumstances.",1303084800,20,593,4.94

4263155,5,B0045KF754,"All of Jefferson Moore's movies are great. They reach you in a way that is very special.
God and religion is given to you in away where you feel and understand,not where it is forced on you.
I saw The Perfect Stranger and after that I feel a total change in my life.
The actors are great,and everyone seems to relate to each other. You are drawn into the story as if you
were there and a part of it.
If you haven't seen his movies,do so! You will not be sorry. I bought every one of his movies.
I pray he continues to make more.",1425081600,,528,3.990566037735849
4263156,4,B0045KF754,"A refreshing change from ""shoot 'em up"" vioent movies, or ""heat 'em up"" sexy movies.  No foul language, no obligatory sex scene, and what's even better...no gun shots.  Great for those who want something more than special effects from their entertainment.  Good for famiiles too, tho' they might not keep the interest of the very young .

It is fine as long as one realizes this is just a story and that Jesus Christ is NOT going to appear in human form again today.

4263180,5,B0045KF754,I accidentaly stumbled across these mini-movies on youtube and have been hooked ever since. I knew I wanted these series for my collection. Others are interested in viewing them also.,1399852800,,183,5.133333333333334
4263181,5,B0045KF754,I have seen the movie  The  Perfect Gift that was playing on the Daystar network and I was surprised on How great this picture is and now I have found the other two movies in this set. I in  turn want to give the daystar network for showing such great films like this. If there was a movie that anyone want to take to church. This is the one,1397088000,,341,3.9130434782608696

Jefferson Moore's portrayal of Jesus left me amazed and wanting more. He really drew me in, he just did such a spectacular job. This is actually my second purchase of The Perfect Triple Feature. This set was for my mama and daddy, because after talking to them about them and how wonderful they are, they were excited to watch them. So, I bought them a set of their own! They love them as much as I do!",1391299200,4,530,4.418367346938775
4263185,5,B0045KF754,"I watched this in poor rez on youtube and immediately knew I had to get this.  The first movie is adult themed meaning it answers a lot of questions adults have (IE, is there a hell? Why doesn't God just come down and fix everything?).  The second one does this with a young woman getting ready for college.  The third is general with a nice emphasis on addressing some concerns from a child's perspective.

These are not heavy handed or very preachy.  The acting is very good and you will be glued to it in minutes.  There is so much good material that you can watch it over and over and still like it.

I am going to start looking for more of their stuff because it seems as the years go by they upgrade their stuff and it only gets better.",1390953600,,742,4.183098591549296

4263195,5,B0045KF754,The movies were very family oriented and there was no defects in the disc. All three movies were very good.,1375747200,,107,4.4
4263196,5,B0045KF754,"It is, of course, movie portrayal. However, they give what I feel is a good balance of how Jesus might handle some of the difficult and recurring issues people have. It is obvious they also try to keep close to the Bible.",1369699200,,221,4.285714285714286

4263207,5,B0045KF754,"The Perfect Triple Feature.  I have mentioned in other reviews, I love Christmas
movies.  I viewed The Perfect Gift before the first two movies.  It is more
Christmas like, with trees, nativity at a church, but that is not to take away
from the The Perfect Stranger or Another Perfect Stranger.  The Perfect in all of
the movies refers to The Perfect Jesus Christ.  Instead of Santa Clause appearing
to certain individuals, Jesus does so, but in a honorable fashion.  I recommend
you watch them in the order they appear on the cover.  Tho I had seen them all
before, I managed to watch all three the same day I received them.  Enjoy, it's
a '10'.",1344211200,,646,4.508620689655173

THE PERFECT STRANGER MOVIES TAKE PLACE IN TODAY'S WORLD WITH TODAY'S PROBLEMS, THE ONLY THING DIFFERENT IS JESUS APPEARS AS A PERSON DRESSED AS WE DRESS AND INTER-ACTS WITH THE PEOPLE AS JUST ANOTHER PERSON. THE MOVIE'S IN NO WAY PUTS JESUS, GOD, NOR WHATS RIGHT DOWN!!
THESE MOVIES ARE TERRIFIC FOR PEOPLE OF ALL AGES!! I HAVE A 10 YR. OLD GIRL WITH AUTISM, SHE LOVES THESE MOVIES, AND WHATS MORE, SHE UNDERSTANDS THE MORALS OF THESE MOVIES!!
THE PERFECT GIFT IS HER FAVORITE ONE. AGAIN, JESUS SHOWS UP AS A REGULAR PERSON WHO THROUGH HIS ACTIONS SHOWS PERFECT LOVE AND TURNS THE SPOILED LIFE OF A CHILD AROUND WHILE HELPING A COMMUNITY SEE GOD ABOVE COMMERCIALISM AT CHRISTMAS TIME.

Many questions the average person has about Jesus and about being a Christian are answered in a very unobtrusive, non-threatening way. These are movies with a plot and a purpose, not sermons, so I feel that this is an excellent way of answering questions about Christianity if you are curious but not sure. And for Christians who are sure and already know where their salvation lies, these are still very excellent movies portrayed in a modern-day setting  that helps you live in a modern world the way Christians are instructed to live through a Bible that is centuries old. Very instructive & refreshing, but not in a corny or patronizing way. I would rate these movies 10 stars if I could!",1474502400,,837,4.732876712328767
