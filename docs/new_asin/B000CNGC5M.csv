The beginning is evocative of psa from the 1960s car driving off scene. If this was made then or recent and specifically made to look 'retro' they did great especially at the end with the sheer effect of shattering glass.

 But soon after this, ones expectations might become suddenly shattered, because the film goes down hill with hardly bleak moments to perk up the interest weather in an art film sense or an all out independent sense.  As to what standard to go by, I don't know here.
The road sign part was not what I was hoping it would be.  After the first few, it becomes an endless display of different county identification signs.  All pretty much the same damn sign.  No classic or retro Holiday Inn, dazzling road side commercial pop signs from the 50's, 60's, 70's or local attractions that one might otherwise see on such a tour.
Maybe they had their reasons.  There is a part about these almost psychedelic micro-dots and shapes.  A part about flowers which is very informal and as far as independent film or artful theater goes, just could not bring myself to appreciate this.  One could easily say that it is a waste as I could, but I don't know the thinking behind it.  The homestead part is almost like the sign part, one of the casts looks like a member of Janes Addiction (the band).
 There never is any filming of any drive-through theaters as was hoped but there is this intermission section, that apart from the aforementioned, is just what you would find at one.  This is where things begin to pick up!

On the positive, the Portuguese bull fight is spectacular, not just by what is usually going on at the event but how it was filmed.  Again, I believe as was read it was made rather recently but as one would view it, you see it through a 70's cinematic camera.  There is true dimension here!  It has an anachronism but that's all right.  It just contributes to the magic here!  The Scottish dance festival is real from the late 50's early 60's and is a great gem of local film archives of state cultural events.  The Scottish gals skirts are really ""WOW"", especially for that time.

 The part of the commercial village square is the most interesting of all, and gloriously saves this film from it's fatal half.  The little girl, with her back turned toward the viewer, is like the culture of the 70's starring at the Corporate bastardized utopia of todays aesthetically, plain and consumer driven lifestyles.  It's strikingly eerie, yet strangely on que.  The subtleness of the aura as seen through the camera lens of 1970's eyes is something not to be missed about this film!  At the same time then, among late 60's and 70's automobiles, pulls in a 2001 Chevy that inters in at good timing before the girls eyes.

There is, sometime before its closing, a nice piece that has a heavy San Francisco retro-art-house-feel with a scary,  almost Charles Manson-like spirituality.  The vibe is unpredictable but the original music of Sergio Mendes is great to espouse the soundtrack!  If you possess the patience to for-bare long pauses found in Brian Eno's effect in his music, then the rest can be assured for you here.

You know, I truly think the film could have had allot more.  Not taking away from its very own minimalism for its own sake but lacking more time and display on the second half of after the intermission.

Last but not least, The California Tour DVD cover,.. Jesus Christ!  Don't you think that even independent film and art house lovers would agree that if they  had a childhood, they might sort of find it a tad silly in the sense that it sort of reminds one of, well, Lucky Charms breakfast cereal!  And I mean, absolutely no offense to the artist!  The Web site has a layout that is convincingly, approachable in comparison.",1168128000,,3893,4.589855072463768
