8552416,5,B00AIZ2L8Q,"I streamed this movie, then really wanted a DVD copy to watch offline.  This is a really touching, funny movie for the whole family.  Not to spoil too much, Yoo Ah In plays a teen with not only a stressful home life, but a school teacher he regards as his nemesis, as a next door neighbor.  The teacher's meddling in his life provides both angst and humor as the basis of the story about a boy finding a pathway to his future and happiness.  I highly recommend this movie.

The DVD is excellent, and is a licensed edition, not a bootleg copy.  Both Discs are included as advertised.  I'm very happy with this purchase.",1465430400,,618,4.368421052631579

8552419,5,B00AIZ2L8Q,"Ever since the success of Harry Potter more interest has been paid to young adult fiction, and like Harry Potter more young adult novels are being turned into movies. I have been watching the latest such success closely. John Greens The Fault in Our Stars which has been a very successful book and will soon be a very successful movie. However, the young adult fiction phenomenon is not just an occurrence within the english speaking world. I had the opportunity to view one of these novels turned movie in the Korean film Punch, which is based on the young adult novel titled Wandeuk, after the name of the main character, written by Kim Ryeo-ryeong. I am very pleased that I got to watch this movie and if I can ever find an english version of the book, I will read it. Or, maybe I will learn Korean someday. Until that time, I can watch Punch again.

 The film is centered on eighteen year old Do Wan-deok, played by Yoo Ah-in. Wan-deok comes from a broken, poverty stricken family. His father, Do Gak-seol, played by Park So-yeong, is a hunchback that makes his living from being a tap dancing clown who sells insoles in open air markets. Wan-deok has an adopted uncle, Min-gu, played by Kim Young-jae, who is mentally handicapped and a great dancer who follows Gak-seol everywhere. Wan-deoks mother is nowhere to be seen at the start of the film. His parents have separated but have still remained married. She lives close by however, and longs to reconnect with her son. She is a Filipino who moved to Korea to marry Gak-seol and took the Korean name Lee Suk-gi. The mother is played by Jasmine B. Lee a naturalized Korean lawmaker. Wan-deok has no real hope and no friends and lives mostly by himself in a two room shack that is at the top of another building. What changes his life is his study hall teacher, Lee Dong-ju, played by Kim Yoon-seok.

 The relationship between teacher and student is strained at best. Wan-deok regularly goes to church just to pray to God for Dong-jus death, because Dong-ju practices a form of teaching that one might call tough love. He will not cut Wan-deok any slack, whatsoever. He is quick to point out Wan-deoks faults and mistakes. Dong-ju makes fun of him, and calls him names. Dong-ju isn't a bully though, he just won't let Wan-deok get away with anything. However, he never gives up on him. He offers advice, guidance, covers for Wan-deok, and looks out for him when his father is away. Also, Dong-ju is Wan-deoks next door neighbor, so lessons don't stop when class is over.

 There is great chemistry all over this film. Wan-deok and Dong-ju have a hilarious relationship that is a mix of friends, brothers, and complete strangers. Dong-ju has many secrets he is dealing with by himself, one of these lands him in jail. He is an activist who campions socialist causes like workers rights and defends immigrants who are taken advantage of. The scenes with these two never disappoint and always surprise. Dong-jus responses are unpredictable and you are never sure if a fight will break out or a deep talk. The film balances these more emotional scenes well, never allowing the story to become overly intense but keeping a strong sense of reality surrounding the interactions.

 The neighborhood they live in has a life of its own. There are a brother and sister living together close by. The sister, Ho-jeong, played by Park Hyo-joo, is a writer of existential martial arts novels and becomes Dong-jus love interest. The brother is an irritable man who is always yelling at Wan-deok and Dong-ju when they have conversations from across the street on their rooftop apartments. The scenes with Wan-deok and his estranged family are incredibility touching. There is a scene where he buys his mother a pair of shoes and identifies her as his mother for the first time to a store clerk that is very moving in a simple and relatable way. Or, when Wan-deok carries his drunk father home and all the while Gak-seol keeps saying how his son is the best, the tallest son ever.

 The story is a coming of age story and that is where the punch part comes in. Wan-deok is incredibly defensive of the people he cares about, and while he might never stand up for himself, he will violently brawl with anyone who says anything bad about them. Wan-deok begins taking lessons in kickboxing that start to help him gain confidence and try to take control of his life. His teacher is played by Ahn Gil-kang, an actor I came to love for his role as Chilsook in The Great Queen Seondeok. It is the combination of kickboxing and Dong-jus relentless life tutoring that pushes Wan-deok to  play an active role in his life. He seeks out his mother and builds a relationship with her. He tries to repair the damage of his parents failed marriage and stops being afraid of his future. Also, he gets over his fear of his love interest in the film, a young woman in his class that is the brightest one there, Yoon-ha, played by Kang Byeol. These changes and the developing closeness of the characters leads to a neighborhood development that begins to change the life of so many more people.

 There is a story under the story however. It is one of of politics. There are many characters in this movie who are not Korean, Wan-deok mothers, a man and his wife at the church that Wan-deok prays at, as well as the people, unseen, that Dong-ju goes to jail for. They are all immigrants and many are illegal. The workers Dong-ju is concerned with are illegal and that status is being abused by factory owners. Much like immigrant workers who are forced to work at farms for cents a day in America. Dong-ju is furious and driven by his faith in Christianity to do something to stop their exploitation. The fact that Jasmine B. Lee plays Wan-deoks mother is also telling of the importance of this understory. Mrs. Lee is a Filipino and came to Korea as a student. She married a Korean and became a naturalized citizen. She was the first non-ethic Korean to become a politician and lawmaker. Needless to say she has been an advocate for the rights of immigrants in Korea. So, there is a story about exploiting the poor for the sake of greed. In a American film this would be front and center and it would become preachy. However, the main story here is about the people and how societies views of immigrants effect them.

 This movie is a cliche, there have been so many other films made with the same story in mind. They have become a mainstay of the Disney Industrial Complex. Such films have produced absolute cheese that gets replayed over and over on family TV channels and after school specials. In short, such films are crap. Punch is not one of these films. There are two reasons to watch this film. While it is a cliche, it is one done in such a honest and unconventional fashion. These characters are broken, weird outcasts, but they are real and they are important to each other. Just because Wan-deok starts making decisions for himself doesnt mean that life is perfect, but there are now opportunities to make it better. The second reason; when such films are done well, they should be watched because we need consist reminders that life can be better when we choose to make it so. Wan-deok makes improvements in his life because he sets out to make them happen, however the film makes clear that without people there to believe in him and support him, to give him a chance, he wouldnt have succeed. Without them, he wouldnt have a reason to make such changes. In short, we need each other.",1389830400,,7516,4.611069558713538

8552422,5,B00AIZ2L8Q,"Love how the everyday people shine w/ family love.  Didn't expect this to be so heartwarming.  I share this dvd w/ everyone I know & everyone has loved it too!  Not sugary sweet, just decency & acceptance in the script & in the faces of these wonderful actors.  I would recommend this dvd very highly & I am a rather picky viewer!",1366156800,,330,4.274193548387097
8552423,2,B00AIZ2L8Q,"I'm fond of the two actors on the cover of the movie jacket, and the two, who played the girlfriends. The woman who played the smart student, who didn't seem to belong in the neighborhood, added some lightness to the story. The funny parts had to do with the kid's cute conversations with God and the funny things the teacher said and did, while interacting with this teenager. There was a lot of cuss words that showed up in the subtitles and it seemed like the writers were trying to suggest, that the relationship between the dad and his coworker, was homosexual. The movie represented a bleak existence, where the kid, cheated out of a healthy home environment, with a responsible mommy and daddy, made the best out of the situation, to get by. The buildings, the neighborhoods, the skyline, the standard of living and the day to day life in the story, was all dreary. Not only was the kid's upbringing lonely and oppressive, His only avenue to make a living didn't involve an education, but the path of beating up another human being. Though I like the actors, I cannot recommend this movie.",1361059200,,1096,4.625641025641026
8552424,5,B00AIZ2L8Q,"Punch tells the story of troubled student Do Wan-deuk, his unusual teacher, Lee Dong-ju, and the odd relationship they form. Punch is a powerful, compelling, and often humorous film with a positive message.

The story in Punch goes over several events in Wan-deuk's current situation. We learn that Wan-deuk  comes from a poor family, has no friends, has a disabled father, and his mother ran out on him right after he was done breastfeeding. He eventually forms a relationship with Lee Dong-ju, his teacher, who teaches him about life in an unconventional manner. Although it may seem dark, the story usually keeps a positive atmosphere as it blends humor with the drama, and sends out a positive message. I found it to be a very positive and thought-provoking film- a film with the potential to change lives, or at least open minds. It's a story that shows the audience to take care of and respect each other, regardless of color, social status, culture, or disability. The pace was great, the music was great, and the acting was great.

Overall, Punch is an amazing film; a great blend of drama and comedy, with a positive message. As of 1/8/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, but a purchase is highly recommended.

Punch has some violence and blood.",1359763200,,1267,4.824884792626728
