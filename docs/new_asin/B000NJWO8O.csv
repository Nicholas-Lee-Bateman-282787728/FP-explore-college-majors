2770428,5,B000NJWO8O,"I'm a signifcantly overweight woman with several big health issues (can't walk or stand much and am on a catheter), so exercising in traditional ways is not an option.  Being severely mobility limited, I knew I had to find alternative ways to be healthy, or face dire consequences.  Therefore, I was delighted to find a workout that I could do sitting down.
  I poked around on Amazon and found this Chair Salsa DVD with David Stamp.  As someone who didn't much like exercise, whodathunk I'd love it so much?!!  There are two work out choices: one is a quick version of about 15 minutes, and the other is about 27 minutes.  Both have a warm up and cool down.  I love David Stamp's energetic and upbeat presentation (okay, yes, he gets corny in one or two places, but I can follow his direction easily).  The music has a great beat - it's lively and very easy to feel the rhythm.
  To start, you can pace yourself and only do however much you can handle.  Initially, I only could manage the short version, and not even all of it.  I quickly improved, and now I'm not even winded at the end of the long version.  I have to modify some of the knee exercises and sit on a cushion, but what the hey.  I've never been an exercise nut (usually I avoided it at all costs), but I actually look forward to doing this DVD.  By the end of it, I feel energized and know that every cell of my body is benefiting by the exercise.  The routine may not use every single muscle, but it definitely gets the most important ones.
  David Stamp, if you or your production team ever read this - thank you so very much for the great, helpful and fun work out!  You've entirely changed my outlook on exercise, and is helping me regain my health!",1283904000,46,1720,4.315625
2770429,5,B000NJWO8O,LOVE IT!! I am enjoying this video very much.  I was suprized at how fast I recieved the video. I recomed this video to any one who has a hard time standing. Its a fun way for me to get my exercise.  Thank-You,1270598400,,209,3.8372093023255816
2770430,4,B000NJWO8O,"Because of bad ankles and because I am just plain awkward (Hey, honesty here...) I bought some of the chair exercise DVDs to have an additional way to get my heart rate up which doesn't use equipment.  It's a change of pace for me from my usual exercises.  Am I great at following his lead?  Nope, but I hope that I will get better.  Do I care?  No.  There is just something that feels so accepting and nonjudgmental about the man who leads the exercise and the music is so fun that I just laugh at myself when I flub up and just keep trying.  Right now I get enough of it right enough, and get to laugh while doing so.

In one word, this DVD is FUN!",1266796800,14,650,4.0234375
2770431,2,B000NJWO8O,This product is fine if you can use your legs. There is some upper body but mostly leg work! Not good if you are in a wheelchair and paralyzed like me.,1257379200,24,151,3.903225806451613
2770432,4,B000NJWO8O,"I bought this fitness DVD for my mother in law who had a stroke many years ago, but therefore is hard for her to stand and exercise. This chair aerobics Salsa is awesome. It's different from other seated exercise classes/DVD's and keeps you moving. A good workout for beginner exercisers and active older adults who want something low impact. I definitely recommend this DVD.",1245110400,18,375,4.875
2770433,5,B000NJWO8O,Excellent workout for people who want to get moving but aren't ready for a more conventional workout & David is adorable & encouraging. I wish he was in more videos.,1242432000,8,165,4.533333333333333
2770434,5,B000NJWO8O,"I was looking for some activity that I could do while recovering from ankle surgery.  Chair Salsa really gets you going and I can do all the exercises with my cast as long as I am careful. I tried Chair Belly Dancing and it wasn't enough of a workout, but Chair Salsa gets me moving. I usually repeat the combos to increase the workout.  In fact I liked this so much I have bought it for my mom and aunt who both have leg troubles to get them moving.",1212451200,33,450,4.044943820224719

2770436,5,B000NJWO8O,"Loved this it is so much fun! I am overcoming terrible lower back pain, that prevents me from walking or standing for long.  This is a true workout.  My back didn't hurt at all while doing this workout.  He has such high, positive, energy that makes it fun as well.",1462233600,2,265,4.26

2770438,4,B000NJWO8O,"I injured my Achilles, and decided to try chair aerobics to give me some variety from stationary biking.  I found this video surprisingly fun and high energy.  It got my heart rate up to 135 bpm.  I am coordination-challenged, so I had trouble keeping up with David.  He provides some instruction but moves on to the next steps quickly.  David is very positive and I had a smile on my face the entire workout, despite my struggles.  For anyone interested in additional high-energy chair aerobics, I highly recommend Paul Eugene, also a very positive guy with challenging workouts (but more repetition and instruction).  I don't think he sells videos on Amazon, but he has 10 minute excerpts on youtube and sells full chair workouts on his own webpage.",1456531200,3,751,4.8203125
2770439,5,B000NJWO8O,"I have not been able to do aerobic exercise in 20 years because of problems with my knees and both feet. I have been limited to water exercises. I tried this dvd and could not believe how my heart rate really increased. I used a heartrate monitor to test it. It is AMAZING! I now add light hand weights to th wirkout. I also raise my arms high in the air. That gets me up to my target heart rate nicely. All of the other chair aerobics dvds were for people who really cannot move fast. I am 65 yrs old. But I need my heart to get stronger- not just to keep beating. This is the dvd of all time!  I actually bought a second copy in case something gets messed up  with the first one. I do it 5 times a week. I am so much stronger. I have improved in endurance too. My cardio health has improved greatly. I am so blessed to have found this dvd. And I am not injuring my knees or feet! It is perfect for someone who wants a great workout. It even has a quick workout segment. But I love doing the full workout. Then I do a 20 min. cool-down on my recumbent bike. Yes, I am a senior citizen. But I am an ACTIVE Senior- and I plan to stay active! This dvd changed my life!",1448064000,2,1166,3.9156118143459917
2770440,5,B000NJWO8O,"This workout is so FUN & A GREAT Workout!! I tore my Achilles' tendon and I was looking for a high intensity, low impact workout. I found it!!! David Stamps is an AMAZING instructor!!!  This workout  lets you go at your own speed and ability so it can be low intensity as well as high intensity.  I got a great work out and I burned over 200 calories within this 30 minute workout!!!  I also love to salsa dance and this workout fills that desire during a time where I can't walk because of my injury. A Must Buy!!!!",1438300800,,516,4.181818181818182
2770441,4,B000NJWO8O,"I am a serious runner and my ankle is broken, thus I am in an almost knee-length fiberglass cast. I have been scrambling to put together a regimen to avoid total loss of conditioning and this workout fits in nicely. To point out some specific factors:

-The workout is indeed totally seated. I read some complaints in the reviews for the generic ""Chair Aerobics For Everyone"" workout that that one contained several standing exercises. For this, you will remain in the chair the entire time. Also, no props are needed.
-If you wear a wrist-based Fitbit (like myself), this workout will credit you with Active minutes and it is good for a few thousand steps. I didn't think to take a before and after count of steps (and I will update the review if and when I do), but I appreciate being able to continue measuring my progress toward my (reduced) daily goals.
- It is fun and easy to follow. If you have an injury that renders you unable to do any but isolated movements, this workout provides that missing satisfaction of moving your whole body at once and even getting a little sweaty.

In summary, I believe that this workout (along with some lifting and rowing) is going to help me meet my goal of maintaining some level of base fitness until I am able to resume more intense training. Obviously, it is no substitute for the vigor of running. Nothing is. But as far as seated aerobics goes, I doubt that you're going to find anything superior to this.

**Update** Yesterday morning my Fitbit measured 874 steps before the workout, 3,817 after. I also wore a foot pod which tracked a rate of 39 steps per minute for a total distance of 0.25 miles. Not too shabby for sitting in a chair!",1436659200,7,1688,4.527868852459016
2770442,3,B000NJWO8O,"Love David Stamps, but chair salsa is mostly for those who can move their feet well....parts are very difficult for a person in a wheelchair, but, there is some good upper body workout too.",1431907200,,189,4.588235294117647
2770443,5,B000NJWO8O,"This was my first dvd of David Stamps.  I try to use this everyday.  I like ths salsa beat and I like the way David explains the exercise.

2770445,1,B000NJWO8O,"I purchased this last year,along with his Chair Boxing DVD,after I broke my foot and couldn't do my regular workouts. While Chair Boxing was a lot of fun and made me sweat buckets,this was just too hard to follow. I tend to have 2 left feet with highly choreographed workouts but I thought since I was seated,how hard could it be?!Well,I just could not follow along and got so frustrated I just gave up.",1428710400,,403,4.45945945945946
2770446,5,B000NJWO8O,"David is awesome he makes exercising in a chair fun.  I recently had reconstructive surgery on my foot  and will be non wt bearing for 4 months .

2770450,3,B000NJWO8O,"Bought this after bunion surgery. I'm a moderate-pace runner. about 20-25 miles a week. I wanted something to keep me from turning into a blob over the 4-6 week recovery time.

This is OK - but doesn't exactly get your heart rate up. It's better than sitting on the sofa, eating Pretzel M & M's - but barely.

And I bought the DVD, which is really pricey. Wish I had just bought the digital version (for less than half) and I could've seen it was just average. Might be a good choice for a senior citizen oe someone who is genuinely housebound.",1406592000,,544,4.323529411764706

2770454,5,B000NJWO8O,"This is not a hardcore workout but it is a good workout that will get you moving when you don't have a lot of room to work out.  I am a truck driver who drives truck with my husband so I don't have a lot of opportunities to workout or get in some cardio.  The most I can do in the small sleeping space is workout resistance bands.  This is a good option for me to use when I want some cardio and I can do it sitting on the edge of the bed while my husband is driving the truck.  It's a really good option I only wish that the actual DVD wasn't so expensive in comparison to how much the digital copy.  It's hard to download the DVD when you are on the road but it's hard for me to have access to my mailbox when I'm on the road, and Amazon instant video stinks.",1386374400,,761,3.821656050955414

2770456,5,B000NJWO8O,Enjoy David's enthusiasm.  That alone is worth getting the video for.  Plus he actually gets you moving.  Use this when my gout kicks up and always feel like I was able to get some much needed movement as a result.,1371600000,,214,4.3
2770457,5,B000NJWO8O,Based on the other reviewers' comments I bought this seated workout dvd. It was well worth the price. I have done it several times and it is a fun way to workout while seated in a straight back chair. The instructor is upbeat and his charm comes through the presentation. I place this workout dvd as one of my top 3 favorites that I do now.,1370736000,3,340,4.166666666666667

2770459,5,B000NJWO8O,"I am a HUGE fan of the Chair Aerobics For Everyone Series.. This was my 3rd from thes series that I purchased.  David Stamps is such a fun and enjoyable trainer.  He makes working out fun and always has a smile on his face which makes me smile.

I did the short workout first because I was pressed for time.. It was about 14-15 minutes I believe and it really got my heart rate going.  The full workout was almost an entire half hour which was a pleasant surprise!

I have Rheumatoid Arthritis and I am only 26 so I've been looking for workout DVDs to help me lose weight and tone without much strain on my joints and these are perfect.  You do have to move your legs/feet/arms but you sure do get quite a workout!

I would recommend to anyone and everyone!",1362528000,3,757,4.215277777777778

I am disabled and have been trying to find a video I could do from a chair and enjoy it.

2770462,5,B000NJWO8O,I used to do tae bo and turbojam until I injured my knee. Now I can't even jump up and down. I bought this video when I learned about chair exercises could help me. I was pleasantly surprised by this workout. First of all David Stamps is cute as a button and motivational. Also I have lost ten pounds since I started doing this one and watching what I eat in moderation. Not bad in two weeks time. I still have a lot to lose but I know with chair exercises and dieting I can reach my goal God willing. Great workout. G.Johnson,1344556800,2,526,4.116504854368932
2770463,5,B000NJWO8O,"I love this DVD.  David has such a positive attitude it is so easy to get caught up in his enthusiasm.  The DVD begins with a 5 minute warm up and ends with a 5 minute cool clown.  The middle is a series of five minute segments that you can add in as you feel able to do them.  It is great if you only have a half hour or so, and great if you want to spend more time.  I really enjoy working with this DVD.",1310774400,4,406,3.6206896551724137
2770464,3,B000NJWO8O,"I bought this DVD to use during my 16-plus weeks of wheelchair confinement after breaking my foot.  It is much better than the Wheelchair Workout from the same series, but still did not keep my interest.  I have been an avid exerciser for many years -- step aerobics, competitive swimming, hiking, Zumba -- so I did not have very high expectations for this video.  I just wanted something to keep me moving while sitting.  This workout does do that, but it has some major flaws:

--The music is bad:  electronic, canned, Muzak-like
--- The music is TOO LOUD and covers up the instructor's voice at times
---The instructor's choreography is predictable and repetitive:  very boring!

I kept using the DVD in spite of these problems because I thought there weren't any other DVDs that would be better.  However, I just found Jodi Stolove's Chair Dancing DVDS a couple of weeks ago and these are MUCH better in terms of chroeography.  The musi on Jodi's videos is also bad, but at least her movements are interesting and fun.  I'd recommend ckipping this ""Salsa"" workout and opting for Jodi Stolove.",1309219200,4,1096,4.776595744680851

It's the only one I've ever had that actually moves your legs. This sucker made me sweat, but I felt so good for doing it. Someday I hope to be able to do the entire thing.

8178764,5,B000NJWO8O,"I bought this DVD and Chair Boxing because of activity restrictions due to plantar fasciitis and bunion surgery. Chair Salsa is a higher quality recording than Chair Boxing. The music is engaging. I'm 66 and out of condition, so even though the workout is seated, it was fast for me. My son solved the problem by turning on the advanced controls of my VLC media player. This allows me to slow down the playback to suit my level of fitness. The routine does use the feet, but without putting weight on them. If you are in good condition, this may not be very challenging, but it's better than sitting in a chair and eating cookies while your injury heals.",1518652800,,654,4.504201680672269

David has an upbeatl personality and for me, the steps were easy to master after a couple of viewings. I don't become breathless but I definitely feel tired at the end in a great way. The Salsa dancing is much fun and a good combo of both upper and lower body moves in fast 50-50 sets. Just enough time to make me feel so much better and maybe even ditching a few calories!

I have seen a few chair videos before but the music on this one is exceptional.  The instructor is friendly and gives good comments on exercising during the video.  This is also nice if a person doesn't have much room to do all the exercises on the stand-up videos as many involve moving two or three steps to each side.  All in all, a very useful video.  (This does involve some leg and foot movement but I think a person can get by without it if they aren't capable of doing so.)",1473984000,,586,4.150442477876106

I loved aerobics when I was young and did a lot but now (61 years) with a spine surgery, no spine twist or flexions  and  long standing problems being able to do  aerobics again  is a wonderful life  surprise. Thanks David and ""Chair aerobics for everyone"" !",1466294400,,625,4.731481481481482
