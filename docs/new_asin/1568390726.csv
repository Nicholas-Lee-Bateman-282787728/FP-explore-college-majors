8194104,5,1568390726,"I want to start off with a little history that you will get in the video.  America's original amusement parks were built around the turn of the century for the purpose of entertaining the public, which, at that time, had more free time and money that ever before.  That's one of the main reasons that these parks were successful.  Today, amusement parks draw in nearly 350 million visitors a year with new hi-tech roller coasters, nostalgic midways, and all sorts of other rides to entertain even the most strict enthusiast for days!
This vidoe features several parks, which you can read in the items description.  There is some excellent footage from Cedar Point and Kennywood.  You get a chance to see the park in general and not just focus on one ride or particular feature of the park.  You basically get an overview of what the park is like.  You cover some of the history of the parks and how they got to be the way they are today.  Also, how the park's history is incorporated into the amusement park today.  Today's parks are not just about new technology, but keeping that fun and carefree feeling fro the turn of the century with the park.  There is also an interesting look at Universal Studios in Los Angeles that features their virtual reality rides, and the new technology that is being developed to thrill their guests more than ever before.
While this video is dated, it still gives an excellent view into the world of these top amusement parks.  I would say that this video focuses on two main points: 1) the history of these parks and how it shows through today, and 2) it shows how modern technology has contributed to these parks and making them become the best.  These parks have to be the best, though, becuase they are frequent tourist destinations.  Overall, this video will open your eyes to the amazing world of amusement parks.  Whether you are an avid entuhsiast or just looking into the parks for the first time, this video will give you everything you need and leave you craving more!!!",1040169600,5,2016,4.626404494382022
