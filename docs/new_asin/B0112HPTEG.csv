8723406,5,B0112HPTEG,"Who loves Transformers? We do! Growing up with the original 1980's hit cartoon series, I couldn't pass up the chance to review this brand new release from Shout! TRANSFORMERS ROBOTS IN DISGUISE: A NEW AUTOBOT MISSION, is a DVD I'd highly recommend for long time fans of the series and those who are new to the Transformers fandom.

With some of my favorite Transformers characters like Bumblebee and Optimus Prime, this particular DVD focuses on Bumblebee years after Optimus Prime's rein. Bumblebee must now learn how to fulfill his new role as leader of the Autobots. With some guidance from Optimus, I loved seeing Bumblebee's journey both in his world, and his journey to earth. True to the classic Transformers story, there's adventure, heart, and plenty of action packed fun in this DVD.

This is definitely a must have for Transformer fans of all ages!",1445990400,3,859,4.917241379310345

8723408,3,B0112HPTEG,"An impulse purchase containing only 5 episodes. If you are unsure about this series, this may be a safe purchase, however, if you are a fan, wait for the *hopeful release*  of the full season (26 episodes) DVD or BRD set. S!F has come through for the most part with their full season sets (sans Rescue Bots, still waiting for season sets on those). All in all, this new show is pretty good. Definitely a lighter tone, and for younger audiences. Not the epic series that Prime was, but still a respectable sequel.",1438732800,9,512,4.505376344086022
