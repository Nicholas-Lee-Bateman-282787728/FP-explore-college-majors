544341,5,6303039421,"I loved this romantic, comedic-thriller of a movie! It features amazing actors and is a spoof on detectives in a great film noir style.

Bob Hope is wonderful in his part as a baby photographer turned private eye. And the lovely Dorothy Lamour is as glamorous as it gets.

I enjoyed the cameo appearances by Lon Chaney, Jr., as well as Peter Lorre. The ending was my favorite part when Ronnie ends up being released from prison, much to the disappointment of his would-be executioner played by the great Bing Crosby.

I would definitely recommend this film for the entire family. It is fun and interesting and a great treasure to be watched time and time again!",1473724800,,661,4.632478632478633

544349,5,6303039421,"The fabulous thing about MY FAVORITE BRUNETTE, is that Bob Hope may arguably deserve single-handed credit for planting the seedling of what modern cinematic observational comedy has morphed into today. Hope was the King of subtle asides, humorous conversational ad-libbing, and in-side jokes referring to the pop-culture of the times in which his films were made. This isn't one of the 7 official ""ROAD TO..."" pictures he did with Dorothy Lamour and Bing Crosby, but it certainly is a fun caper and film-noir spoof about Ronnie, a baby-photographer who yearns to become a 'Private Dick Gumshoe' like the Detective whose office is across from his studio. After Ronnie volunteers to watch said Detective's office while he's out-of-town in Chicago, a case of mistaken identity/wrong-place-wrong-time ensues that proves the perfect formula for a comedian of Hope's talents! This remastered black & white classic does include some great cameos.  MY FAVORITE BRUNETTE has another surprisingly unique distinction; the character of Mrs. Fong, played by Asian actress Jean Wong, proved pivotal to the resolution of the story's central conflict, and was in no way played in the stereotypical manner that was common for the period. Ahead of its time, indeed...perhaps in more ways than one.",1429401600,,1279,5.3316831683168315

544458,3,6303039421,"I know it's misleading to say that this is one of Bob Hope's best movies, and then only give it a 3 star rating, but I have good reason for this.  I have been a big fan of this movie for a very long time.  I have seen it played on commercial television since I was a kid, and more recently by live streaming on Netflix.  I never really considered to be part of the ""Film Noir"" style of movie making.  I don't know if the original intention was for it to be film noir or not, but in the many times I have viewed it in the past, it certainly didn't seem be as dark and menacing as most film noir movies come across.  This movie is a spoof on detective films, whether or not the use of black and white was supposed to reflect what would be film noir or not is a mystery to me.  But I don't remember it being film noir the many times that I have seen it in the past.  This DVD version is very dark though, it shows the great wear and tear of age.  I was hoping that it had been somewhat restored, but it is not anything like the live streamed version I recently saw on Netflix.  This DVD was made by Alpha Video, there are other copies made by other companies but I doubt that they are of any better quality than this one is.  From what I have read in the reviews here on Amazon, other people have had the same experience that I have had.  I will still watch it because it is one of my all time favorite comedies, but I would prefer a more cleaned up version of this little gem of a movie.",1356393600,,1485,3.9331103678929766

544460,4,6303039421,"Paramount Pictures presents ""MY FAVORITE BURNETTE"" (1947) (87 min/B&W) -- Starring Bob Hope, Dorothy Lamour, Peter Lorre, Lon Chaney Jr., John Hoyt, Charles Dingle, Reginald Denny, Frank Puglia, Ann Doran, Willard Robertson &  Jack La Rue

Directed by Elliott Nugent

Bob Hope was arguably at the peak of his film career when he made this comedy-mystery with Dorothy Lamour, and eases his way through this reasonably high-quality material with the practiced accomplishment of an old pro. Lamour puts in a nicely appealing performance in this flick as a plucky damsel in distress whose uncle has been kidnapped by spies, and exudes an earthy sexiness at times that is perhaps a little surprising in a middle-of-the-road 40s comedy.

The plot is deliberately crazy and implausible, but creative, and it sets up some funny situations. The rest of the cast is good too, and it all works very well as light entertainment.

Watch for Lorre's attempts to place crucial evidence in Hope's path as the hopeless would-be detective searches a room.  Also Hope's foiled attempt to trick Chaney (who appears to be having a whale of a time) into helping him to escape from a sanatorium in which he is being held by the spies.

Hope bring us the laughs with even the most average script but in this film he excels as he is given some great material to work with and certainly makes the most of it.

There are a couple of amusing cameos - one predictable, one less so.  Another winner from Hope and Lamour in this rare release without Bing, oh so we think.

544462,2,6303039421,It is sad when a good film goes bad. (BAD COPY) We were willing to watch Bob Hope on full screen and sacrifice the widescreen experience.  Our family had to suffer through rough footage and low sound to watch this film.  I stress film. Because of all the lines left from the reel to reel film my husband and I were surprised not hear the sound of a reel to reel projector. I believe we would have enjoyed the movie more if we had watched the movie projected from a reel to reel. The sound was so low we had to turn our sound all the way up. If a better copy can be found we would like to have that one instead of this one.,1284508800,,622,3.9285714285714284

544547,1,6303039421,"My Favourite Brunette is a wonderful movie.  It's problem is that because it is ""public domain"", anyone can release it, and hence we get lots of techincally terrible versions of a great film.  The some studios even have the audacity to declare that they've released a remastered or enhanced version, which is an outright swindle as the release is stil CRAP!  I'd love to name names but those of us who've dealt with this company know it's tricks!  (I returned these two ""enhanced/remastered"" DVDs and got all my money back!)

But back to our film.....I'm hoping that Kino gets a little less snobby and gives this film the attention it deseves.  If not, I'm sure Image Entertainment or the Roan Group could do good jobs. Finally, why not let Legend Films colorize it?????  More young people would want to see this movie, and for the purist, Legend Films does a good job in B&W restoration, and has both versions in all of it's products.

The version I watched 20 years ago on the late, late show was miles better than this horrible transfer. Since this movie (incredibly) got forgotten by the copyright office and ended up in the Public Domain, all you can find are cheap, HORRIBLE tansfers to DVD's like this god-awful loser. It's better you never even watch this film than to see it in this terribe representation. Why Hollywood wouldn't want to protect gems like these is beyond me, but since they don't give a flying leotard, don't you. This grainy, blurry, audibly incomprehensible, hardly watchable transfer is a complete loser. Don't waste your money. Keep waiting for the ""restored version"" which hopefully comes out before 2021.

I don't mind black & white (please don't colorize it!), but the picture quality isn't as clear as other films made at the same time.  But for this caliber of humor, I'll put up with an imperfect video quality.  Plus you get to see a young Alan Ladd, although briefly.  Dorothy Lamour is at her best in this film.  She looks great, acts well and sings very nicely!  Peter Lorre and Lon Chaney Jr are great also.  I would place this in my top 3 Bob Hope films.

All the same, this is one of Hope's best comedies and shows why he is an icon among comedians and comic actors. Amazingly, although he was already in his early forties when he made this classic comedy, he would continue to entertain for almost another 60 years.

Baby boomers who only remember Hope as that ""square guy"" their parents watched on NBC in the 1960s and 1970s can get a true appreciation of Hope's talents in this film.

544620,5,6303039421,"The film opens in San Quentin, with the warden granting the incarcerated Ronnie Jackson (Bob Hope) the privilege of telling his story to a bevy of reporters before he is executed. As Ronnie spins his tale, the camera pans back in time to San Francisco as Ronnie plies his baby photography trade. See, Ronnie had always longed to be a part of the McCloud Detective Agency. He gets a crack at it (sort of) when McCloud is away and the Baroness Carlotta Montay (Dorothy Lamour) assumes Ronnie is a real private eye. She hires him to search for her missing husband (later, she changes it to a missing uncle). Soon, Ronnie is nose-deep in side-splitting jeopardy, cryptic maps, escapades in a brooding mansion and a shady sanitarium, and potentially crazy brunettes.

With this 1947 thriller-comedy, Bob Hope is back to his old tricks. But, this time, his allegiance is shifted from his favorite blonde, Madeleine Carroll, to his favorite brunette, Dorothy Lamour. The look of this film is very dark, with many scenes taking place at night or in very dim venues. As usual, everyone but Bob plays it straight. If not for Bob's relentless barrage of humor, this easily could have passed for a typical film noir. As it is, old Ski-nose zanily upends many detective clichs.

Dorothy Lamour - sans sarong, sans Road picture - makes the most of her rare femme fatale role. There's a comfort level between Dorothy and Bob that translates very well onto the screen. And just when you think this movie is Crosby-bereft, guess which crooner has a cameo? Charles Dingle, Frank Puglia, and John Hoyt have nice supporting parts, with Lon Chaney Jr. and the great but creepy Peter Lorre rounding off the cast nicely. Alan Ladd also has a tiny but amusing cameo.

At this stage of his career, Bob Hope had already perfected his screen persona of cowardly, self-deprecating funnyman. As usual, the jokes come in fast and furious, in strafe-like fashion. In the end, it's yet another terrific showcase for Bob's natural timing and immaculate one-liners. This really is one of his very best movies.

***Joke SPOILERS now*** Ironically, the funniest line of the movie is uttered not by Bob Hope but by a state trooper (threatening Hope): ""If you bother us again, I'll personally punch you in the nose so hard it will look like other peoples' noses."" The second funniest line is said by Bob Hope as he reaches up into a chandelier and pulls out a champagne bottle: ""Aha! Ray Milland's been here!""

Perhaps they meant that it was remastered in a mysterious basement somewhere taken from a print that can't count itself higher than 8mm.  It really is too bad, given that this is one of my favorite movies.  A film that makes a comedy out of being a Private Eye, puts Bob Hope in the role of a baby photographer that takes the place of his P.I. friend when he goes out of town for a couple of days.  Bob Hope is quick and funny and it's not campy, but quite witty and an enjoyable watch.  There are no good transfers out yet that I've seen of this film and I jumped at this when I saw ""remastered"" in the title.  The transfer here is completely average, not great, but watchable with some skipping of audio throughout as well.  The studio for this DVD review is A2ZCDS.  The price isn't exactly low either, that's why I figured that it was legit.  I should have jumped back instead.

544696,3,6303039421,"During the latter part of his career, Bob Hope's reputation as a comic legend was tarnished by a series of truly wretched motion pictures and television specials. But from the late-'30s through the mid-'50s, Hope was one of the most reliable laugh-getters in the business, and his best films from this period (THE GHOST BREAKERS, THE PRINCESS AND THE PIRATE, ROAD TO UTOPIA, MY FAVORITE BRUNETTE, SON OF PALEFACE, etc.) stand as a testament to his comedic genius.

MY FAVORITE BRUNETTE is one of Hope's funniest comedies, and would normally serve as a perfect introduction to his film work. The operative word here is ""would""...if only a nice copy were available on DVD. However, this is one of those ubiquitous ""public domain"" titles that suffers from poor representation due to the substandard prints utilized by distributors. Good quality copies of ROAD TO BALI, another public domain Hope title, are available (Brentwood has an excellent one), while all the versions I've seen of MY FAVORITE BRUNETTE (from Brentwood, Madacy, Alpha, Front Row, etc.) are taken from worn, grainy-looking 16mm prints.

This Genius Entertainment release, which I found at a Dollar Store, is the best DVD edition I've seen, faint praise that it is. At least the folks at Genius had access to a clean print with reasonably good (though far from perfect) picture and sound quality. Their version even has the original Paramount Pictures logo (other DVD copies are taken from the later ""California National"" reissue). As for the film itself, Hope is at his hilarious peak as Ronnie Jackson, a baby photographer who turns private eye when he meets the title femme fatale (Dorothy Lamour). It's a wonderful satire of '40s film noir mysteries, with a first-rate supporting cast that includes Peter Lorre, Lon Chaney, John Hoyt, and Reginald Denny...plus cameo appearances by two of Paramount's biggest stars of the era.

Also on this Double Feature disc is ROAD TO HOLLYWOOD, a compilation of scenes from the short musical comedies Bing Crosby made for producer Mack Sennett during the early 1930s. This ""tribute"" was foisted on the public in the late '40s, after Crosby had long established himself as a reigning box-office champion. It's a curio at best, although fans will be fascinated by this glimpse of Der Bingle at the start of his movie career. Since the real attraction here is MY FAVORITE BRUNETTE, ROAD TO HOLLYWOOD can be looked upon as an extended supplement.",1133222400,,2450,5.029556650246305
544697,4,6303039421,"I agree this film is too close to being a real crime drama. I don't care for the death lovers who want so badly to see Ronnie Jackson (Hope) get lynched. That part of the movie always bothered me. But it is only a movie! As most of the film

is told in flashback you can't be sure that the events took place actually just as being described. So if it is already stereotypical that can be why.",1128211200,,392,4.0256410256410255
544698,5,6303039421,"My Favorite Brunette is a classic that has apparantly been rescued. Hope is cast as a Baby Photographer who wants to change careers. He wants to be a detective. His studio is located in an office building in San Francisco juxtaposed to that of a

detective who is played by Alan Ladd in a cameo role.

Hope is alone when Dorothy Lamour comes into the office and asks for help mistaking Hope for a detective. She says that she wants help in finding her missing husband she also gives Hope a map and instructs him to guard it with his life. She then gives him an address outside San Franciso where he is to meet her.

Then the movie takes off. Hope encounters Peter Lorre and Lon Chaney Jr. among others. Lamour's sanity is questioned. Hope goes from location to location trying to solve the mystery. Hope even ends up in the gas chamber for murder. It is hard to tell where it will end or what will happen next but is all great fun. The laughs never stop. The pacing is fast but easy to follow. The only caveat is that the copy is not as pristine as would be desired but it is probably the best that could be provided for the transfer. I believe that one reason for this is that for some reason it does not seem to be owned by Paramount and therefore has not been preserved except for what we have here. The sound track is better than I expected. I believe this to be one of Hope's best and is a ""must see"" for all his fans. Bing Crosby has a cameo at the end of the picture. Once you start to

watch this picture you probably won't notice the quality of the print: it is that good !  The direction is excellent, the quality of the production is very high. That is my reason for the 5 Stars.",1127779200,,1690,4.171779141104294
544699,3,6303039421,"MY FAVORITE BRUNETTE (1947) is a funny send-up of the film noir genre that was so popular at the time.  Bob Hope's character works next door to the classic, hard-drinking, tough-talking detective that Raymond Chandler placed into all of his thrillers.  Of course, while the neighbor displays all the strong qualities needed by a man of action, Bob Hope himself is playing his usual bumbler -- tempted only by the life of excitement and convinced he has what it takes to be no-nonsense private eye because he can drink bourbon and owns his own gun.

Ironically, the film's success comes by placing Bob Hope in settings and situations which were already clich&eacute;s by the time the film was made: mistaken identity, misplaced photograph negatives, damsels in distress, a lost map and an innocent man fighting to clear his name.  In fact, you could imagine this film with only slight changes being made as a slightly unimaginative straight drama.  The comedy comes from playing it very close to the sources and then launching into the mocking at just the right moment.  The dialog is quite good, too, with Bob Hope getting lots of tough talk to say, but never quite getting it out right.

You'll notice Peter Lorre in the cast list, and he plays a knife-throwing, sleazy villain -- the type of role he usually portrayed in conventional noir films.  He plays it completely straight, which is why he never fails at provoking laughter.  He's one of the anchors for this film, providing the weight that allows the jokes to work.

That said, this still isn't nearly the funniest parody I've ever seen.  Some sections of the movie drag.  More than a few jokes drop with a clang and many of them are far too predictable.  Lon Cheney Jr.'s character is a bit too stereotypical and stupid to be truly amusing.

I own the Digiview release of this DVD, and the picture and sound are more than adequate.  I'm sure there are better versions of this movie available for purchase, but given how cheap you can find this edition, I'd be hard pressed to pass it up.

You can find this DVD available for virtually no money at all, and I think the single dollar I splurged on it was a buck well spent.  I'm not the biggest fan of Bob Hope (in fact, I think this is the only film I've seen him in that I actually liked), but he's entertaining for these short eighty-eight minutes.  If you like film noir and don't mind a few digs at the genre, take a chance on this.  It's not as if you'll be risking a huge amount of money.",1121040000,,2503,4.546875
544700,4,6303039421,"I grew up familiar with Bob Hope as a movie comedian and my memory of his humor was fairly positive.  I hadn't seen any of his movies for years and when I had the chance recently, I came away disappointed.  I was beginning to wonder if I was a poor judge of humor in my youth but I think ""My Favorite Brunette"" set me straight.  This is a funny movie and brings out all of Hope talents as a comedian.  It helps that the movie itself is a satire on the ""Film Noir"" standard of the '40's and early '50's.  Alan Ladd does a cameo appearance as the hard-boiled private eye that Ronnie Jackson (Bob Hope) aspires to become.  An opportunity falls in his lap and off we go.  Hope bounces from crisis to crisis alternating his expert talent at wise-cracking with his own self-deprecating humor.  I thought the movie was aided by a decent cast of characters including the likes of Peter Lorre and Lon Chaney Jr.  There was enough of a mystery in the plot to add to the interest level.  However, this movie was a vehicle for Bob Hope and it suceeds because of how well he delivers.

I was glad to be able to ""rediscover"" Hope as a comedian and I thought about how I got misdirected recently.  I realized that what I had been watching of late were ""Road to..."" movies where he teamed up with Bing Crosby.  I realized that, despite the popularity of this team, those movies stifled Hope's talents.  I remembered some of his movies that I liked so well from my youth and I realized that none of them included Crosby.  It's just a theory but I enjoyed the way that Hope plays his style of humor off everyone and I think it suffered when he had to focus that style primarily on one ploy (Crosby).  Maybe I'm not giving enough credit to the writers but watch ""My Favorite Brunette"" and then watch any of the ""Road"" movies and see if you don't detect a noticable decline in the quality of Hope's screen persona.  I'm fired up to check out some more movies with Hope doing his solo act.",1107129600,,1968,4.304347826086956
544701,3,6303039421,"I enjoyed this movie overall. Would I watch it again--not for a while.  The sound quality is a bit low, it looks like it could use a bit of remastering visually as well.

As far as the actual movie goes--it takes a few moments to get into the plot as it is a framed narrative, most of it taking place in the immediate past getting the viewers up to date with the current situation (Bob Hope in San Quentin).  It gets very enjoyable after that, a few confusing moments--a result of a bit of sloppy spoofing. However, mostly it is done very well, anyone familiar with the hard boiled detective genre, film or book will enjoy this for its light hearted take on it.

Lamour and Hope play perfectly off each other there is also a nice blink and you miss it cameo by their on the road co-star, Bing Crosby.

544786,5,6303039421,"In this crackpot comedy from 1947, Bob Hope plays a baby photographer who dreams of becoming a detective.  When an exotic brunette by the name of Carlotta Montay (Dorothy Lamour) mistakes him for a detective, he decides to throw caution to the wind and handle her case himself.  A detective only needs smarts, courage, and a gun, and he has a gun; he has even invented a camera that takes pictures through keyholes.  Carlotta says her husband is missing, although she later changes her story to say it is her uncle.  When Jackson comes out to the house, he meets the missing uncle and starts to believe Carlotta is rowing upstream without a paddle, but Ronnie Jackson (Bob Hope) is not one to leave a gorgeous brunette in distress.  To him, being a detective basically involves making time with beautiful female clients.  Soon, as there really are all sorts of thug-induced shenanigans going on, Jackson is in over his head, eventually finding himself framed for a murder he didn't commit.
My Favorite Brunette features vintage Bob Hope comedy.  He has one-liners for even the darkest of occasions; he even complains jokingly about his last meal when he is locked up in the hoosegow awaiting execution.  Dorothy Lamour's character remains serious and reserved throughout, but this doesn't slow Bob Hope down, as he quite easily carries the movie's load of comedy single-handedly.  As always with Hope, the comedy comes out in so many ways, particularly in the facial expressions; I don't think the man could ever have been not funny if he tried.  The ending of this movie screams deus ex machina, but it really doesn't matter.  My Favorite Brunette features an hour and a half of Bob Hope comedy in its most concentrated and effective form, guaranteeing a ton of laughs for anyone with a funny bone in his/her body.  There's even a very special dessert at the end of this comedic buffet, as Bing Crosby puts in a quick but noteworthy appearance.",1062633600,,1945,4.807807807807808

I can't help but love the old screwbal comedies from the golden black&white age where movies were tons of fun. And with such an all-star cast, what could go wrong with this film? Nothing!
Bob Hope of course stands out in the movie with the most comedic power. He has such talent and seems to effortlessly pull off gags, give out hysterically funny one-liners, and make us laugh with his slapstick comic routines. Dorothy Lamour is a great actress but seems to be stuck in the sidelines under the light of Bob Hope. But that's ok because it's fun just to see her in fabulous costumes and pull Ronnie into the dangerous plot. But besides Bob Hope, Peter Lorre is the bad guy everyone can't help but love. It's great to see him give his innocent puppy dog face which he's so famous for!
Also, don't forget to check out Alan Ladd and Bing Crosby in their cameo appearances (Alan Ladd as the detective, Sam McCloud, and Bing Crosby as an attendant.)

""Brunette"" has an impressive supporting cast including Peter Lorre, Lon Chaney Jr, John Hoyt, Ann Doran, Reginald Denny, Ray Teal, Jack la Rue, and features a couple of surprise star cameos.

Hope plays baby photographer Ronnie Jackson but his heart is set on becoming a private detective (""All my life I've wanted to be a hard boiled detective like Humphrey Bogart, or Dick Powell, or even Alan Ladd!"").
