4117005,4,B003F17ZO0,I like both movies ! But it's not my favorite !! It's ok movie and I rate 4 star because .. I can get 2 movies 2 disc on 1 set together and cheap !! That's why I gave 4 stars .. Movies are ok !,1416355200,,193,3.217391304347826
4117006,4,B003F17ZO0,"It had been awhile since I'd last seen Dr. Giggles. And It's as good as I remember. Otis, on the other hand, not near as good. Sort of dull in spots. Although It had more dark humor than Dr. Giggles. This Blu-ray is a good buy for Dr. Giggles mostly If you can find it inexpensive enough.",1405123200,,288,4.0701754385964914
4117007,4,B003F17ZO0,"This movie is weird enough that it has to be a cult classic.  It is full of one liners that just stick with you.  The main actor is great, sorry I can't recall his name, and he knows his way around the set.  Good one if you like that dark humor.",1388275200,,245,3.764705882352941
4117008,4,B003F17ZO0,"Although Otis is a fun horror/comedy, I got this collection from the nostalgia of Dr. Giggles. Very fun early 90s slasher that deserved a sequel.",1371427200,,145,4.84
4117009,4,B003F17ZO0,"Dr. Giggles is like the old reliable,brings a chuckle and morbid sense of laughter every time i watch this underrated gem..and though picture quality could have been better this is still a nice step up from the DVD ,now Otis i could not get through just was not happening and connecting with my sensibilities..great price ,fun movie DR. GIGGLES!!",1367280000,,346,4.88135593220339
4117010,2,B003F17ZO0,"I dunno about the stand-alone Blu Ray, but the DVD of ""Otis"" has a ton of great extras (commentary, deleted/alternate scenes/ending, featurette, trailers, etc.).  This version, however, has no extras whatsoever.  I thought the point of Blu Ray was being able to jam more on the disc while maintaining superior picture quality.

On the plus side, ""Dr. Giggles"" has never looked better, and this seems to be the only Blu Ray release of that film.  Though it's weird that they've paired it with a completely unrelated movie made nearly 20 years later.

If you're only interested in the films themselves, you can't beat the price.  But the lack of extras is irksome.",1303689600,8,662,4.866071428571429
4117011,3,B003F17ZO0,"I purchased these movies and laughed all the way through as there is comedy and horror in each. If you like old time humor and laughable horror, this is for you.",1298592000,,161,4.225806451612903
4117012,4,B003F17ZO0,"@ great Movies of the Odd Genre.
Dr Giggles id a Blast, comedy Horror early 90's style.
Otis is crazy on a great level. Just sit back enjoy.
Low price and Image is upgraded from DVD version. Well worth time and $ Blu-Ray quality DVD price",1297728000,2,238,4.195652173913044

Great Vendor quick delivery, always quality product.",1448409600,,136,5.523809523809524
8395784,5,B003F17ZO0,"Dr. Giggles is one of the funniest murderers ever. So glad he finally made the trip to hi def!

Never saw Otis before this release; it only added to the fun. Otis is 2 movies in one flick. A scary abduction horror n revenge comedy,  all wrapped in one twisted story. 2 great tastes that slay great together.
Ya can't go wrong buying this bluray.",1446940800,,345,4.292307692307692
