8039209,3,B00066FPA8,"As far as I'm concerned, all the ""Murder She Wrote"" episodes are enjoyable since Angela Lansbury's portrayal of Jessica Fletcher, a mystery writer from Maine, is wonderful and it's fun seeing the old time guest clebrities. Naturally, some stories are better than others and when Jessica teams up with another detective, it doesn't always work. In these two episodes, Jessica meets Harry McGraw, an old ""gumshoe"" in the Philip Marlowe, Sam Spade vein (women are ""dames""). Trouble is, he's a bit of a doofus and keeps getting beat up! Jerry Orbach (more recently seen in the ""Law and Order"" series) is an excellent actor and he and Ms. Lansbury have a good rapport.",1154822400,,663,4.876106194690266
