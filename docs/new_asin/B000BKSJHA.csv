8088186,5,B000BKSJHA,"Without giving too much away, a lot of events come into play in this volume. There are some startling casualties that stem from a jarring event that will change the current state of the world. And there is a budding romance that develops between two characters who were on opposing sides originally. With appearances by the mysterious Reiko and the appearance of the vicious Blattaria force- this volume is a must.",1135468800,3,414,4.845070422535211
