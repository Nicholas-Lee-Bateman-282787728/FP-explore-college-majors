Cases of Duplicate Case and Twice Told Twist)
(1) The Case of the Duplicate Case

Millie Cornwall works in the office of a major department store and has the interest of a number of men who work there. The fact that she is married, to Herbie Cornwall, doesn't seem to stop her from seeing those men whenever she feels like it. Herbie was once an up and coming baseball star but now that he sells insoles for tired feet, he doesn't seem as glamorous to her. Herbie's office is next to Paul Drake's and he inadvertently comes across Herbie's problem: when he got home that day after visiting his wife at the office he found $72,000 in his briefcase. Clearly the case is not his but a mysterious fire at his wife's office not only destroyed many of the; company's financial records, his wife is found dead. Perry Mason is soon on the case and while he is fairly certain that Millie was involved in the theft, it's apparent that someone else also had plans for her.

8047903,4,B0007L7IMK,"The ""Perry Mason"" novels were a form of mystery stories where the lawyer is the detective and the solution occurs in a courtroom. A real life court trial is not as dramatic as in fiction. Erle Stanley Gardner often educated his readers with new technology or medical-legal facts, and warned of swindles. The TV shows were simplified and modified versions from the originals or new stories. Some may criticize the tactics of Perry Mason but they represent life before the modern legal rules of the 1960s. The prices, automobiles, and monetary figures date these stories. They record the styles and culture of the 1950s. The many character actors enrich these stories, their emotions are often read from their facial expressions.
