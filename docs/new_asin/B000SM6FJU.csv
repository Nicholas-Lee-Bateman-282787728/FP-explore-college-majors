2887542,4,B000SM6FJU,This is a great sculpting dvd!  I wish it were longer. This is one of my favorite Prevention dvds.,1211673600,2,98,4.157894736842105
2887543,5,B000SM6FJU,"Do all three of these toning/cardio segments and you'll feel it in your muscles and see it in the results! I love the Pilates segment the best but it's the cardio one that does indeed fatigue the muscles just enough to tell you it's working. The kickboxing segment is just fun! At first I did them separately, but together they are very effective. In all honesty, you need to do a variety of workouts (and eat properly) to get ""BIG Weight Loss,"" but adding one of these segments to another cardio workout or doing all of them should work for most folks! I look forward to doing these workouts! If you're older (nearly 60) like me, stick to 2-3 pound weights.",1208304000,11,658,4.446280991735537
2887544,5,B000SM6FJU,"This DVD workout video is one of my favorites, its fun and since there is 3 ten minute workouts it doesn't get boring AND it is effective. I would reccomend it for anyone, I love it!",1205971200,5,182,4.083333333333333
2887545,4,B000SM6FJU,"Any dvd with Chris Freytag instructing becomes one of my favorites and Shortcuts to Big Weight Loss is no exception.  Although I have yet to do this dvd without supplementing the kickboxing or cardio sculpt segments with another dvd.  Neither segment is adequate alone and together there is not enough cardio for my workout plan. However, Chris' cueing, instruction, and all around positive approach make this dvd a ""go to"" at least once a week.",1202342400,9,445,4.92
2887546,4,B000SM6FJU,This a a good workout when you don't have a lot of time.  It targets areas that you may normally miss.,1194825600,16,102,3.857142857142857
2887547,2,B000SM6FJU,"The dvd is broken down to a quick warm-up, a 10 minute cardio/strength workout, a 10 minute pilates workout, a 10 minute kickboxing workout and a quick cool down.  Weights are needed for the cardio and pilates workouts.  They advise 2 or 3 pounds, but you can also use a heavier weight.  If  you use a heavier weight, Chris Freytag advises that you will fatigue.  She gives good advise and shows ""how to"" thru out the workouts that a beginner or an advanced exerciser can use.  Because the workouts are in 10 minute segments, you don't get bored and things are definitely moving.",1194566400,14,579,4.572815533980583
2887548,4,B000SM6FJU,"You can't go wrong with Chris Freytag leading your workout session.  This DVD is great for beginners and advanced alike, though it would benefit from an additional 10 minute section.  This is an effective, well-rounded workout, but intermediate and advanced exercisers may not find it particularly challenging.  I also think they should have put the pilates segment at the end, because that way you won't have to take your shoes off only to put them back on.  I supplement this 30 minute workout to meet my daily exercise quota.",1193097600,20,528,4.898876404494382
2887549,5,B000SM6FJU,"I have almost all of Preventions dvds.  They are great because you can do only a little workout, or combine all segments for one long workout.  Plus, they aren't intimidating or too challenging that you won't do them.  All the instructors are fantastic and Chris is excellent in this as she usually is.
In this particular workout, there are three different 11 minute segments.  There's cardio sculpt, pilates and kickbox.  I love the pilates section where you also use dumbbells to increase the effect (like a bicep curl along with a bicycle).  If you like kickboxing, you are in luck - it's fast and fun and totally fat burning.  At the end of the dvd there is a 6 minute tutorial.
All you need are some dumbbells and plenty of energy.  I've done this twice already and really enjoy it.  Chris is bubbly as usuall and I love how you can pick and choose what exercises you do and how long your routine is going to be.  This is a fantastic workout that I highly recommend.",1190592000,39,971,4.465909090909091
2887570,5,B000SM6FJU,"Had to buy a second copy, since my first was damaged.  I've had this DVD in my exercise rotation for at least two years now, and it's one of my favorites!  (9 of the 11 exercise DVDs in my rotation are of Chris Freytag's.)  I've tried products from a few other personal trainers, and I really find Freytag's to be among the very best- most fun, very efficient, and highly-motivating!

I started exercising on a daily basis in 2001, and Chris Freytag was there for me from the start.  I even met her at 2008's PF Chang's Half-Marathon!  (I didn't know she would be there.)  She's a lovely soul on screen and in person.  :)",1360281600,4,621,4.339130434782609
2887571,5,B000SM6FJU,"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this DVD, especially since I found it discounted at a store. There are three workouts that I linked together for one great session. While I see that at least one reviewer disliked the choice to place the pilates in the middle of the DVD, I have to disagree; you burn the most fat calories when you do intervals of cardio, and the choice to do cardio toning, followed by the pilates, and then the high-energy kickboxing made total sense to me and gave me a great interval workout. All of the moves will be achievable by beginners, but if you're more advanced you'll still feel it. I felt firmer and tighter after finishing, and I highly recommend this DVD as a great overall body toner and cardio session.",1352160000,2,749,4.514705882352941
2887572,3,B000SM6FJU,"I often look for new dvds and instructors to try to keep my workouts fresh and keep myself in good shape.  This is the first I have done in the prevention series.  Here are the likes/dislikes:

The instructor shows good form, is enthusiastic but not too over the top.  The workouts are cued well and get started quickly which is good because they are each only 10 minutes long.  As a daily exerciser a 10 minute workout is used for a couple purposes, to add to another workout for some additional work or to combine as in this case with the other workouts on the dvd to make a longer workout.  With three 10 minute workouts I still was a bit short on time I would normally spend working out.  The workouts were well done but nothing that I felt like I would want to do again and again.  I didn't feel like as a daily exerciser this one was really for me.

Who I think this workout is for: Someone who is not a huge fan of exercise, who wants to work out for a short span of time, burn some calories, but doesn't really want to spend a lot of time doing it.  This would also be good for someone in the beginner/intermediate range.  Someone who wanted a warm and friendly instructor, would also find this dvd to be a good one.  You will get a workout and not spend a lot of time doing it and you can expand and do more than one segment as you grow stronger and gain more stamina.

Overall, a well done workout, but not one that I would purchase for myself, though I would recommend for others who are looking for a well done workout for someone who is on the go and has minimal time that they want to spend exercising.",1315094400,8,1616,4.157556270096463
2887573,3,B000SM6FJU,More aerobic than I was expecting. I was looking for more strength building and cardio. Not for a beginer.  I like Chris Freitag's strength circuits better.,1306972800,,156,5.0
2887574,5,B000SM6FJU,I'm 58 and while I find this workout vigorous I had no problem keeping up with it after a few tries. It is one of the best I've used. I think Chris Freytag is very good at her job.,1279497600,,180,3.641025641025641
2887575,5,B000SM6FJU,"Excellent for my busy schedule. I can find ten-minutes at a time, plus it is excellent workouts.",1269388800,,96,4.705882352941177
2887576,4,B000SM6FJU,"I have five other exercise videos starring Chris Freytag.  I also have videos by other popular instructors.  Chris is #1.  She is enthusiastic without being perky, motivating and always is clear with her cueing and instructions.  I was hesitant to try this video because I've never done Pilates.  But, Chris makes it easy to follow.  I liked the variety of Pilates, Kick-boxing and aerobics and got a good workout.  Using weights was challenging, at times, but very beneficial.  I'm 52, in pretty good shape and do an exercise video 5 times each week.",1237334400,3,551,4.849462365591398
2887577,2,B000SM6FJU,"I have several Prevention DVDs, and I like them, but I didn't like this one. Even though I am an advanced excersiser, I am 43 years old, and throwing weights around at the speed shown on this dvd is a good way to get hurt. The whole thing seems disjointed to me, and I thought it was dumb to put the Pilates section in the middle. Who wants to stop and take their shoes off, and then put them back on again? There are a lot better dvd's out there that accomplish the same thing.",1234742400,12,478,4.042105263157895
2887578,5,B000SM6FJU,"I'm on a personal workout challenge. I'm working out every day for 30 days. I began with Jillian Michael's 30 minute shred, but frankly it's a bit boring and repetitive and too high impact at my weight. Just because she can get the Biggest Loser's to do jumping jacks and suicide jumps, doesn't mean it's good for them. Anyhow, I'm not dumping the workout, but I do need something to mix it up.
I've tried several other DVDs and this is currently my favorite. The instructor is friendly without being obnoxious, she has good cuing, and I work up a sweat.",1233360000,2,554,4.4950495049504955
2887579,4,B000SM6FJU,"This is one of Prevention's harder workouts.  Its shorter too, maybe cause it's more difficult, they shortened it.

Theres a warm up and cool down. Then it's broken into 3 sections.  The first is cardio sculpt.  This is what I found difficult.  Chris recommends 2-3 lbs weights due to its intensity.  You do multiple squats, plies and lunges with the weights at a faster pace.  Some of the moves I can use 4 or 5 lbs, but some, even the 2 or 3 hurt my arms alot.

The second 10 min. is milder aerobics and abs.  Nothing hard here.  But the ab workout is really good and you'll feel it.

The last 10 min is kickboxing.  It gets pretty intense at the end.  Very good and very rythmic.

I think it should be longer, cause it's shorter than the other prevention dvds.",1219104000,5,763,4.28169014084507

8205967,5,B000SM6FJU,"I am 61 yrs old, in good shape for my years, exercise regularly with low to intermediate aerobics and floor exercises and hand weights.  I find  this to be a very good workout.  Good cues from instructor with smooth transition to new choreography.",1485043200,3,247,4.6976744186046515
8205968,5,B000SM6FJU,I LOVE this work out! As a post partum mama it was just right to start working out again.,1479427200,,89,3.736842105263158
8205969,3,B000SM6FJU,"It's a good Filler if you are looking to get in a quick workout and, also, if you aren't up for a cardio challenge for the day...otherwise, wouldn't recommend if you are looking to be challenged by the workouts.",1473638400,,211,4.435897435897436

8205972,4,B000SM6FJU,I first checked out this DVD from the library and tried all the routines out.  I wasn't into the cardio or pilates segments but the kickboxing was awesome.  I'm kind of wimpy so the 10 minute segment really tired me out and it was so fun.  When I had to return the DVD to the library I really missed it so purchased a copy from Amazon and it's great!,1391904000,3,350,4.043478260869565
8205973,5,B000SM6FJU,"It's short but very intense. I recommend it mostly to middle-age women in an acceptable-to-decent shape (which best describes me) who want to bring it up a notch (or two). I find it useful to mix it up (not JUST treadmil or JUST eliptical every day) and this DVD definitely breaks the rut (I've only done a few times, though).",1361318400,,326,4.45
