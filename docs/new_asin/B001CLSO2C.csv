8288182,2,B001CLSO2C,Let me start off my saying that this DVD is very informative and very strategic. But. I wouldve liked it more if more fish were caught. It's ok but it seemed more business than fun.,1453680000,,181,4.2
8288183,5,B001CLSO2C,I think this DVD is excellent and worth checking out for any serious flat head fisherman. First off they open up your eyes to river fishing and the best spots on the river. Plus they use maps and explain why some areas are better than others. While you don't get to see them pulling out a lot of fish when they finally start fishing they pull out some monster flat heads over 30 pounds at night. They also show rigging systems. If you are not into flat heads or happen to be an expert on flat head fishing this DVD may not be for you but for anyone else this DVD is defiantly worth checking out.,1375142400,,595,4.137931034482759
