8364614,2,B002CXJI4W,This spinning DVD has elevator music with a motion video through the Cascades.  The shots are nice but if you are in to hard core spinning you would be better listening to you own music for motivation.  I would not recommend this video.,1391644800,,236,4.465116279069767
8364615,5,B002CXJI4W,"I have a Gazelle instead of a bike, and I enjoy gliding along as if it were a bike.  I love seeing the river rushing by on the side of the road, the waterfalls, the snow melting, the switchbacks, the overlooks, the mountain peaks  :)  The only thing that would make this better would be if I could smell the pines and hear the water rushing by....

The music was not really anything I wanted to listen to, so I muted it and played my own cd which was better for me.  The scenery more than made up for the music, however.",1341187200,,520,4.0588235294117645
8364616,4,B002CXJI4W,"I didn't give this DVD 5 stars only because I was disappointed the time length of each ride wasn't designated somewhere in the menu, or before beginning,except for the 63 minute Chinook climb,which I haven't done yet. Granted, I can figure out how much time each shorter ride is by using the timer on my bike, or a watch, but I think the makers of the DVD should have included the times of the shorter rides as well. Other than that, I was impressed with the video's gorgeous scenery of mountains,rivers,water falls and forests. My mind was tricked into thinking I was riding along the Cascade mountain roads which did make my ride less tedious. Currently starting with 30 minute rides which I was able to complete with two of the segments. I'm a 50 yo female whose intention is to get back some stamina and strength that I lost over the past four years do to some health issues. I've always been more of a bike rider and outdoor walker, than a runner, or treadmill user. I was pleased to have found a video to accommodate my choice of exercise when the winter stepped in to slow down my walking routine. Planning to purchase a couple different rides in the future.",1326931200,3,1165,4.5
8364617,5,B002CXJI4W,"I set my 37"" HDTV right in front of my exercise bike and the DVD takes me right to the Washington Cascade Mountains.  Makes working out fun, especially on those frigid Winter days when you don't want anything to do with the outdoors.",1307664000,4,233,4.4186046511627906
8364618,5,B002CXJI4W,"I have most of the Bike-O-Vision Cycling DVDs and I can usually do them without wanting to give up, but this one almost got the best of me.

We started innocently enough going through winding streets of a sleepy little mountain village with what looked like little chalets dotted along the road.  That seems like a L-O-N-G time ago now. It surely couldn't have been just 74 minutes, but that's what I read on the case.

We move on to a steeper grade. The scenery is SPECTACULAR, no, MAGNIFICENT!  Anyway, I didn't want to take my eyes off of it, so that part was easy. At one point we go through an area where a farmer is working on his land, which is surrounded by rather ordinary hills in the background and we travel though some rather ordinary territory for a while before getting back to the outrageously beautiful scenery again.

At the end I thought maybe I had accidentally put the DVD in an endless loop and I was going around in circles.  Wait a minute. I couldn't have because I don't remember seeing that waterfall. I know I didn't see all that snow. Okay, I'll look for the little chalets. If I see them again I'll know I am through for the day, or maybe that antique car. If I see that again, I'll know.

I think the problem was I had been doing the Bike-O-Vision DVDs regularly and was comfortable doing them, but got busy with my work and took a month or so off. The pounds started packing back on and I got out of shape! I had no idea how I had built up strength and stamina while I was doing these DVDs and some others that are another brand that I also enjoy.

Finally, a graphic came on the screen that said, ""Mt. Ranier"" and I knew we were finished.  WRONG!!! It didn't stop there.  Another segment started around the lake. I thought I might have to give up on finishing it, but I hung in there and did it.

Excellent way to exercise. NEVER would I have stayed on my bike that long if I hadn't been too stubborn to wimp out on that long ride.

These DVDs are great!  I recommend them.  ALL of them.",1273104000,8,2019,4.237597911227154
