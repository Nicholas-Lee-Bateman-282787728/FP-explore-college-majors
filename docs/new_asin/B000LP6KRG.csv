8162825,5,B000LP6KRG,"This is a form which is not quite a silent movie.  There are plenty of sound effects (wind, glasses clinking, sneezes, indistinct voices and laughter) but no dialogue.  Barker did a couple of these with Ronnie Corbett (By the Sea, The Picnic).
In this case, the setting is a country weekend put on by Futtock (Baker) for his neice and her friends.  A Japanese tourist also mistakenly enters the car when it is parked next to a sign for hotel pickup.  He never directly interacts with the group but wanders around observing the goings on.
The butler and Futtock are both dirty old men trying to get peeks at the neice's female friends and basically screwing things up for each other.  There are other servants with their own issues.  In general, things go wrong all over the place, but members of the group are generally chattering away and oblivious to what is happening around them.
All in all good fun.  BTW, the house this was filmed in once belonged to W S Gilbert of Gilbert and Sullivan fame..",1455408000,,999,4.578651685393258
