2018241,5,B0001NBLYA,"All of the films in this collection are very watchable.  Without doubt Weissmuller is the best Tarzan of the movies, although there are two Gordon Scott films that are also very good.  The extras listed are exceptional.
However, the gem of the collection is Tarzan and His Mate.  This is the last of the Weissmuller films made for an adult audience and was made pre-code.  Several scenes were cut from the film as released, and restored on the VHS version.  Whether the DVD release has the restored senes or not - once you watch this movie you'll know exactly why Tarzan did not want to leave the jungle.",1086652800,7,604,4.555555555555555
2018242,4,B0001NBLYA,"It's a delight to have these great flicks on dvd.
I watched Tarzan as a kid and can wait to see it again.
Cheeta in Tarzan's New York Adventure gives an oscar worth performance. Maureen O'Sullivan is just a darling.
And Weissmuller gives a mix of power and inocence to the part ,that makes him the best Tarzan ever by far.
 By the way, the guy who gave an star to this great package in his review, is the same guy who hates The Simpsons and thinks that The Matrix Revolutions is the best movie ever made... nuff said.",1086652800,11,517,4.222222222222222
2018243,5,B0001NBLYA,"I was one of the lucky ones brought up as a youth in the 5o's
in a neighborhood in Albany, New York  that had five movie
  theatres all located in the downtown area of
  Albany, New  York
  The Eagle Theater was the best!
You got to see newsreels.....three or four coming attractions......these episodic movie serials from the 1930's and early 194o's.  You got to see these really cool low budget sci-fi / monster films ..... and.....if you were really lucky.....  the main feature would be a Johnny Weissmuller
  'Tarzan' Film!
  I'm still infatuated and in love with Maureen O'Sullivan
  3o years later!
  I absolutely must have this Dvd Tarzan Collection

* note:  Maureen O'Sullivan is from our area in her early
  years.
 I got to meet her once around 1994 in one of her home
  comings.
 Owning this Dvd Collection is going to be another Home
  Coming!
  Thanks for carrying it Amazon.com!",1086480000,6,894,4.690789473684211
2018244,5,B0001NBLYA,"When I saw that this package was available on TV, I didn't hesitate to order it.  What a deal - 6 movies in one set.  I spent many an afternoon watching Tarzan on TV when I was growing up - it was the highlight of the day no matter how many times I had seen them before.  My husband too delights in these movies.  Unfortunately we didn't get to see them when they were first released - but we both feel they belong to our generation.
And to comment on what one person wrote - NO they aren't great epics but who cares - they are great fun and we are looking forward to sharing these with the grandkids!!",1086480000,4,602,4.033613445378151
2018245,1,B0001NBLYA,"These have got to be some of the worst movies ever made. Now I know that all old movies are bad, but this is approximately 100 times worse than any other old movie. Who wants to see some old, patchy film about some insane savage living in the Jungles of Africa? I, for one, do not. These movies are silly and horrible. Tarzan is a monster. I hate him.",1086307200,5,351,4.101449275362318
2018246,5,B0001NBLYA,"I can only hope at least a million people buy this Tarzan DVD set. I pre-ordered it a couple months ago when I first saw it was available to order. As a child I watched these on Sunday afternoons. They were a mainstay for any kids TV diet in the 1950s and 1960s. I have to say that after dining on the majority of Tarzan movies my taste became partial to Johnny Weismueller. The fact that he was an Olympian swimmer, had the best Tarzan yodel, and his acting seemed to fit a kid raised in the jungle. It was a blast watching him wrestle crocodiles and lions and call elephants to tramble the bad guys. We can only hope that interest in this set may prompt them to release the rest of his Tarzan movies. I for one loved them all, even if the special effects were a little hokey sometimes. By todays standards the F/X will seem comical, but still fun to watch. This set has the best production values and casting of all the Tarzan movies.",1085529600,160,936,4.23463687150838
2018247,5,B0001NBLYA,"Oh, thank you MGM! I have waited years for the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan movies to come to DVD.Quite simply, they were the best of them all, even better than the RKO ones he did afterward. These were lavish and big movies, a delightful fantasy. I just hope they fix up the quality of the first movie, Tarzan of the Apes. I have them all on video, and the quality was fine, but the first movie needs a clean-up. After I see the DVD I'll come back to edit this review.
  Now let's get something straight here, boys and girls. This is Hollywood's version of Tarzan, though I  think Johnny is the closest in physique and ferocity to the real Tarzan of the books. By virtue of his lifestyle Tarzan should be built like a gymnist/swimmer, long, lean, well defined muscles and not blown-up like a weightlifter. He played it with great dignity also, and did most of his acting with his eyes. Tarzan spoke more than a dozen languages, lived on an estate in British east Africa, flew planes and even had a girlfriend on the side, one La of opar. His real son was named John Clayton also, but in jungle parlance he was known as Korak the Killer, having been kidnapped as a child and grown up in the wild as did his father. His best animal friend was not a chimp named Cheetah, but a golden lion named Jad-bal-ja. Jane was blond and American, not brunette and British. ..But what difference does it make? These movies are wonderful fun. I wax nostalgic when I recall as a young boy in the fifties watching these movies on Sundays at 1pm on the CBS Movie for a Sunday Afternoon. And yes, all the stores were closed and life was for the better. People were visiting  relatives and not running to shopping malls to sped money and abdicate parental responsibilites. After all, Tarzan searched for his son for ten years!
  Well, I now have the set and have watched the movies. I'm disappointed. They did nothing to clean up the movies. They're the exact quality of what's showing on TCM on a regular basis. Why bother to do it if they don't improve on it?",1080691200,19,2038,4.421333333333333
2018248,5,B0001NBLYA,"What a great year it is for collecting box sets of your favorite
vintage movies Abbott & Costello,The Marx bros,The Airport series
and now it's Tarzan's turn. Edgar Rice Burroughs brainchild and mgm
favorite jungle swinger are finally on disc. Johnny  Weissmuller is
the fan favorite for wearing the loin cloth and good enough to play
in twelve Tarzan films, this box features the first six in order.
and that's Tarzan the apeman, Tarzan and his mate, Tarzan escapes
Tarzan finds a son,Tarzan's secret treasure and Tarzan's New York adventure.
To start off with the box features the original art from the movie
poster which is always a plus with collectors and by theory if the
set contains four disc then that's two films per disc leaving the 4th
for extra suppliments like trailers and such. I know I'm speaking

2018314,5,B0001NBLYA,"I've gotten a chance to enjoy the first 3 of this series and they are excellent. In the '50 & '60s, broadcast television in the area I lived in would show old movies in the late afternoon as a runup to the evening news. For school age kids, this was prime time viewing and it is where I first got to watch the old Tarzan movies.  Watching them again lets me revisit the sense of awe I felt back then; seeing those things Hollywood would never do again. There was high drama with actual wildlife, filmed before all the animal protections were put into place. There were scenes unfiltered by today's censorship standards that seem fresh and unburdened with pretend moralities. I'm looking forward to watching the rest of the series, and then probably watching them all over again.",1399420800,,778,4.597122302158273

It also seems that all of the tribes that Tarzan came into contact with, sounded alike. It didn't matter if it was in their villages or out in the jungle.

2018333,5,B0001NBLYA,"The first 5 films, in this alternate universe, portray Tarzan living in an exotic paradise, high on a plateau in the unexplored interior of equatorial Africa.  Tarzan wishes to be left alone, unfortunately, there are those who have heard of the fabulous wealth to be had in Tarzan's realm.  All they have to do is trek across miles and miles of jungle teeming with sharp-toothed beasts and hostile tribes and then climb a treacherous 1,500 foot cliff called the Mutier Escarpment.  Once on top, they'll find Tarzan's territory is just as dangerous . . . .

The last film is a departure from the rest.  Some men have taken Boy to New York to exploit his skill handling animals.  Tarzan and Jane fly to the city to retrieve him.  You might expect this to be a ""fish out of water"" story, but Tarzan easily adapts to this unfamiliar concrete jungle . . . .

This set of Tarzan films was produced by MGM and Jane's character was perfectly played by Maureen O'Sullivan.  (In ""The Tarzan Collection, Volume 2"", Jane was played by Brenda Joyce and produced by RKO Radio Pictures.)

Best way to view: recommend watching them in the order they were made - note the second film is on disc 2, not disc 1.

Special Features disc: no standouts, but interesting.

DVD - 2004.  Sharpness, Contrast, & Brightness varies from fair to good.  Defects: grainy.  In ""Tarzan the Ape Man"" many shots have a darkening in the corners.  Sound: volume moderately low.

That may make it sound like Im really old, but thats not so, I just enjoy the classics of yesterdays movie era before television even existed.  At one point there was innocence in our movie history that was visually captured and portrayed in a way that todays writers producers and directors just don't vision anymore.  Where Africa was a wild and mysterious faraway place and man had to be strong and adapt or not survive.  These adventures by todays standards leave a lot to be desired technically, but they were state of the art for the day.  I really enjoy Johnny and Maureen most of all in these roles, though many before and after have played Tarzan and Jane, these two had a chemistry that brought a realism to the roles they played.  There here in these collector sets to be enjoyed over and over, if thats your cup of tea I highly recommend them, for when you just want to see something different, I hope you enjoy them as much as I do.",1374278400,,1116,4.393203883495145

2018345,5,B0001NBLYA,"Okay, I want anyone who reads this review to be able to use it in making their decision on this purchase.  I love history, watching Black and White cinema is like pawing through old papers, letters, and tax forms-it is history!  I read the original Edgar Rice Burroughs books from the 1930's (these films are only loosely based on the premise ERB posited).  You don't have to be that big of a fan to appreciate these films, but don't think you are getting a copy of Avatar.

These are not the first movies about Tarzan (nor were they the last or the highest budget films) who has proven to be a character of broad social appeal.  It is slightly amusing to see the difference between these films and the movies of today.  These are beautifully preserved and if you are a fan, a great addition to your collection.

If you are wondering about the rating, there is a swimming scene where Jane is totally nude, but you only get a side view and no clear boob shot.  I treat it like a national geographic documentary type of thing.",1363132800,,1024,4.409574468085107

2018347,5,B0001NBLYA,No doubt about it Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan are the best Tarzan and Jane. When I hear Tarzan and Jane I always think of them. Seeing these movies reminds me of my childhood watching Tarzan movies on Saturday afternoons. The six movies are better than I remembered. The special features disc gives the viewer an inside look at how the Tarzan movies were created plus there are additional features. The chemistry between Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan is apparent and John Sheffield as boy is a wonderful addition. I only wish they were still here so I could tell them how much I enjoy watching their movies.,1361923200,,633,4.87037037037037

2018368,5,B0001NBLYA,"""Tarzan of the Apes,"" Edgar Rice Burroughs' 1912 pulp magazine story, was a natural for the big screen and director Sidney Scott made it work ---almost. Louisiana didn't look much like Africa, extras dressed in monkey suits were a distraction, and star Elmo Lincoln . . . well, the role of Tarzan really called for a younger man.
His successor, Gene Pollar, a paunchy middle-age fellow, was sure not what audiences wanted. The actor who followed him, J Dempsey Tablor, a fat balding man, wore a fright wig. Jim Pierce, who played Tarzan on radio, looked like a lifeguard. The role of Tarzan called for a youth, a ""wild child."" An idealization of man pure in nature running free was how Burroughs' illustrator, J. Allen Scott, pictured the jungle man.
In 1932, MGM found young Johnny Weissmuller, an Olympic swimmer. He won 67 world championships, five gold medals, set 94 American and 51 world records, AND broke the one minute mark in the 100 meter freestyle.
MGM reduced Tarzan to a monosyllabic lug. but who cared? Women went wild over hunky Johnny's love scenes with sexy co-star Maureen O' Sullivan. Kids went ape. Even animals fell in love with him. Cheetah the chimp hung on to Johnny and the African rhino Tarzan battled on film followed Johnny around MGM's backlot.",1357257600,,1274,4.795454545454546

I've seen the first 4 of these now and I am pleased to say they have exceeded my expectations.  Sure, the first one is only fair in viewing quality -- what do you expect for 1932?  But the rest are increasingly better black and white movies.  I really enjoy seeing these old movies as they bring back old memories.  The underwater scenes filmed at Silver Springs are still incredible.  I had forgotten about one thing about these movies:  there were several scenes that were reused from one movie to the next!

2018378,5,B0001NBLYA,"After careful deliberation going through many different versions of Tarzan scenes available on youtube I came to the conclusion that the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzans are the definitive Tarzans.  I don't care what Edgar Rice Burroughs thinks , or thought. Johnny Weissmuller is the best Tarzan ever. Oh sure, there have been physically more muscular Tarzan's and all that stuff, and Tarzan's with the right hair, and Tarzans that portrayed Tarzan as written in the novels, but without that classic Tarzan yell you got nothing. Don't believe the stories about all the different noises mixed together. That yell was Johnny with just a touch of audio enhancement to give it that fuller sound. His acting as Tarzan is far more brilliant than he's given credit for. Just look at his eyes as he displays childlike bewilderment and self assuredness at the same time. And that stilted speech comes across as something more believable than being able to speak Oxford English. There are other Tarzan movies and tv shows that borrow the yell, but it fits best here.",1341014400,10,1051,4.971590909090909

It seems, however, that WB again did not want to invest any money in restoring these movies. Don't get me wrong, I know these movies are from the thirties - I also know, as an avid film collector, what the 21st century technology can do to improve the transfer of movies like these; WB chose to ignore this technology and, if memory serves, they did this before to other films.

2018401,5,B0001NBLYA,"This is the tenth of twelve movies in which Johnny Weissmuller played Tarzan. Although lots of other men had this role, many people consider him the quintessential Tarzan. While this is his tenth time, he still has not mastered the English language and continues to speak in half sentences. Brenda Joyce is Jane again, her second time in this role, and Johnny Sheffield, who has been in the series longer than her, is Boy. The original idea was to name this film Tarzan and the Leopard Man, since a man has the leadership role, but the idea was changed because it lacked sex appeal. The woman who played the Leopard Woman, the priestess of the tribe, was a former model and later actress in B movies. She shows hardly any facial expressions and is very wooden. Tarzan is given no opportunity to use his famous Tarzan yell. Nevertheless the film is fun.

The plot focuses on an African tribe, curiously made up of Caucasians, who are angered and disgusted at the English who patronize the tribe and force them to aid them by doing menial labor. Their god is the leopard. They are led by a man who provokes them to kill the English after dressing in leopard skins and making people believe that the murdered people are killed by leopards and not men. Tarzan realizes that the people are not killed by animals since they have scratches but no bite marks. He takes on the entire tribe and saves the English.",1308009600,,1403,4.567460317460317

2018430,5,B0001NBLYA,"What a WONDERFUL trip down memory lane!  As a young child growing up in the 50's & 60's, escaping to the mysterious jungles with Tarzan, Jane, Boy and Chetah on Saturday mornings was the perfect recipe for developing my love for the healthy outdoors and my later desire for Zen living.  The excitement I felt as I watched these four characters live, love and play in a world with such wholesome harmony made me feel happy trying to emulate that in my own life.  These are the movies I encourage my own children to watch even now, as the more contemporary movies are so full of CGI effects that the real appetite for using our imagination is lost.  I purchased the full collection of two volumes, six movies in each volume and love all of these original episodes.  All 12 of the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan movies are precious and unique, most especially because filming and working with wild animals like they did then is now forbidden and fraught with so many rules that capturing the actions of wrestling with a real lion or riding on the back of a rhino or hippo could not be performed now without CGI.  The age old message of wholesome morality and living harmoniously in your world was never more distinctive than in these old black & white Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan movies.  If you ever need a good dose of warm, fuzzy and healthy excitement, with a healthy dose of natural Zen, these are the movies and stories to watch.  A very relaxing and therapeutic way to spend an afternoon.  They make excellent gifts that will be treasured and cherished forever.  Amazon has the best selection and prices of these, and movies like them anywhere.  I highly recommend them!",1279584000,3,1667,4.636054421768708

2018453,5,B0001NBLYA,Wow! Remember way back to the old Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan movies? Well here it is on DVD to watch over and over again. How fun! Total enjoyment.,1233792000,,146,4.444444444444445
2018468,5,B0001NBLYA,"This entire set is great, the first one being better. A powerful story of love,communication, corrupt white people & surviving the jungle in Africa. It also makes the white man look corrupt trying to take all the riches from the jungle. Johnny Weissmuller is easily the best Tarzan. Maureen O'Sullivan plays Jane perfectly...
Tarzan the Ape Man introduces Tarzan & Jane, and how they wound up together. Love at first sight. A great great movie,with a surprising amount of somewhat graphic violence. Now these are in black and white, but the shooting of animals and the flesh penetration was heavy duty for its time.
Tarzan Escapes is the 3rd film in the series with her family plotting to bring Jane home, but it is trick to capture Tarzan and get Jane back to 'civilization'. I cant blame her for staying in the jungle.
Tarzan & his Mate - yes this has nude scenes with Jane swimming - I was shocked when I saw this - still another great film with more corrupt whites wanting to make money in Tarzan's land and he has to save the bad guys from an evil tribe
Tarzan Finds a Son - ""Boy"" is his name and this was another fun story basically the same formula - bad white guys who wind up being saved by Tarzan
Secret Treasure has more greedy white guys using boy to round up all the gold that is in Tarzan's land that boy found. Pretty much the same story of the bad white guys who get captured by an evil tribe and Tarzan has to save everyone. Tom Conway plays a great villain in this.
Tarzan's New York Adventure rounds out this set,more greedy white guys kidnap Boy who will be a circus act with the animals. Tarzan in a suit no less goes to the circus and climbs buildings to find boy. Tarzan goes to court over Boy. It was different. I do like it because it got away from the Jungle, it was like a curve ball from someone who threw fastballs,a change of pace..I think overall these are fantastic films(especially the first ones). The DVD's are completely uncut & the movies are fun to watch. Watching the animals as always entertaining. Tarzan fights an alligator scene pops up in 3 movies. Same footage, still fun. If you like jungle films, you cant miss Tarzan and this whole series..highly recommended",1232928000,3,2206,4.476426799007444

2018471,5,B0001NBLYA,"When it comes to setting the trail for Olympic champions to parlay gold medals to pop culture stardom, Johnny Weissmuller is the leader.

The winner of five gold medals in swimming and one bronze medal in team water polo in The Games of 1924 and 1928, Weissmuller became the sixth cinematic Tarzan and starred in a dozen films.

The six in this set are from 1932-1942 and are classic action adventures that typify the era in Hollywood. Weissmuller as Tarzan is always just moments ahead of an incredible disaster, with his cunning and athleticism working in tandem to win the day.

Included is a documentary, which is as much as a nostalgic journey as historical and makes this collection king....in any setting.",1218672000,3,712,4.819672131147541

2018473,4,B0001NBLYA,"In addition to the films announced (covered in 3 CDs), this collection also include various footage in a 4th CD.  This review only covers the first 2 movies: The Ape Man and Tarzan Escapes.
Outstaningly restaured, the scenes are crisp and sharp, the photography is amazing, especially for a movie shot in the 30s.  Johny Weissmuller is goregeous and sexy, combining masculin and boyish charm, very scantly-clad, showing off his almost perfect body.  No wonder he was an instant smash hit with women as well as men!! Maureen O'Sullivan is very pretty and charming.  However, in ""Ape"" she annoyingly screamed non-stop !! She was much better in ""Escapes"".  ""Ape"" had astonishing fights between Tarzan and lions and leopards, while ""Escpae"" had beutiful underwater ""ballet"" by Weissmuller and O'Sullivan.  The relation between Tarzan and some of the animals (elephants and apes), is very sweet and touching.
Of course the stories are very basic, but the main idea of a white ""savage"" in Africa (who is always clean-shaven!!), who falls in love with a white pretty woman has charm (though not credebility!). Many scenes are shot on location, and the ones shot in studio are well done.  Espceially ""escape"", there are fascinating scenes of animals and birds.  However, it is very silly and laughable to see the ""town home"" of Tarzan & Jane perched up a tree, with an elevator (operated by an elephant), and a fan (operated by Cheeta, the very charming chimpanzee), and where a seated dinner is served at a table, with ""The Ape Man"" sitting on a chair and eating from a dish!!!
There are many stereotypes, which while understandable in view ot the era, are still annoying !!  Being the 30s, the Englishmen are clearly portrayed as the masters and the Africans as the slaves.  Constantly and unjustifiably, they have the Africans slashed and whipped, by others or by themselves, just because they are tired of carrying all the heavy luggage of the white man!!  Only Africans fall off cliffs ... are eaten by crocodiles ... etc.
Despite the few negative points, I am giving the collection 4 stars (even without seeing yet the other 4 movies!), on the basis of the following:
1. the subject is certainly unusual, fascinating, and intriguing.
2. the collection contains the first movies which started the Tarzan legend, and is a classical collectible item by itself.
2. the photography is superb.
3. the direction is excellent (despite some of the minor points), especially the movements of masses of africans.
4. Weissmuller is unique, and O'Sullivan is very pretty, which made them the outstanding couple they were.",1213315200,2,2606,4.967816091954023

2018475,5,B0001NBLYA,"For folks my age (I'm 68), the only ""real"" Tarzan is Weismuller.  Of course, he bears no resemblance to the Burrough's character.  All of these movies are essentially alike, but they are great nostalgia.  Folks who order these movies generally know what they are getting; those who don't are likely to be disappointed.",1199145600,,318,4.962264150943396
2018476,5,B0001NBLYA,"The Tarzan series is iconic, and Johnny Weissmuller's characterization is perfect. His films alongside the beautiful and delicate Maureen O'Sullivan are the best of his career and comprise some of the most entertaining jungle movies ever made. Here they are in clear, clean prints with an excellent documentary to accompany the series.

Tarzan the Ape Man is the first film of the series. The story is quite familiar now, so although everyone knows what will happen in the film, it is quite entertaining. Girl goes along with her father on a trek to find the famed elephant graveyard and stumbles upon a man who lives in the wild like an ape. The two are oddly attracted to each other. Weissmuller is not an incredibly attractive man although he is Olympically trained and very fit. He has incredible chemistry with the baby-faced O'Sullivan; all of their scenes are sexually charged which makes this film really good. The story is primally sexual but incredibly romantic at the same time. This film was shot with soft lighting which only accentuates the beauty of the wild. Some footage of real natives was used and real animals were filmed for many of the scenes. This film looks realistic which only draws its audience in more.

Tarzan and His Mate is a typical installment, but perhaps the best. Jane's former beau travels to the jungle with a new entourage in hopes of rediscovering the elephant graveyard and perhaps the lovely Jane. He finds her indeed as well as her new ""husband"" Tarzan. He also finds plenty of action; trouble with natives, animals, and later, with Tarzan. This film shocked the censors of later years with its sexual content. Although it is bluntly stated that Jane and Tarzan consider themselves to be married, the scene where he whisks a glamoured-up Jane into the trees for a night of passion still raises eyebrows. On top of the provocative dialogue, there are scantily clad and topless natives, a scene where a man undresses completely, and an underwater nude scene. O'Sullivan did not do this scene; a body double did, but we still get an eye-full of the beautiful star due to her loose loincloth. She is coy, smart, and helpless as Jane. Weissmuller is heroic, simple, and strong; he leaps through the trees with the ease of silent movie star Douglas Fairbanks. His character is a bit wooden, but he shows range even with scarce lines at the end of the film when he is reunited with Jane. The action scenes are frequent but the use of blue screens and mannequins make them less thrilling. The disregard for the lives of the natives is somewhat disturbing, but a common theme in these films.

Tarzan Escapes begins with two of Jane's cousins entering the jungle to bring Jane back to civilization so they can inherit money left to her. When they find her, they see that life in the jungle is not as savage and horrible as they expected; the treehouse is very advanced in this film. There is hot and cold running water, a fireplace for cooking meat, and other luxuries. However, Jane agrees to help her family by returning despite how upset Tarzan becomes when he hears this news. He also begins to hate the tour guide with just reason; he plans to trap Tarzan and turn him into a freak for a circus show. This film is much more structured and commercialized than the previous two Tarzan films. The scenery is breath-takingly photographed although the studio took the easy way out in using stock film from the other Tarzan pictures for this one. O'Sullivan's costume is much more censored than in previous films. Weismuller is more developed in this film than in the first two; he has more screen time and more ability to show emotion which he does very well. For the first time, we really get a sense of Tarzan's personality and his love for Jane.

Because of the rules governing film-making, and since Tarzan and Jane weren't legally married, Tarzan had to find a son; he couldn't have one of his own. Thus begins the fourth film. A father, mother, and their baby son are flying to Cape Town when the air becomes choppy and the plane crashes. The baby is the only one to survive. He finds his way to Tarzan who adopts him as his own. As he grows up, Tarzan teaches him how to survive in the jungle. The family becomes very close until five years later when a safari expedition comes looking for the wreckage and to confirm that there were no survivors. When they find that ""Boy"" (John Sheffield) is alive, they hope to bring him back to claim his inheritance. Tarzan is against it, but Jane believes it might be best for him. This film never really picks up speed. The relationship between parents and son is never really developed enough to draw emotion when he is threatened to be taken away. Also, the effort put into the film is mediocre. The quality of photography had increased since the making of the first two Tarzan films, but this film utilizes some of that stock footage. It is glaringly obvious. Also, many of the scenes were done with doubles and with rear projection. Even a simple scene like the underwater swimming scene is obviously filmed in a tank inside the studio with rear projection. One of the bright spots of the first Tarzan movie was that most of the footage was authentic and displayed how gorgeous the jungles of Africa could be. The lack of similar quality in this film makes it less notable and exciting to watch.

Another fun romp with Tarzan, Jane, and Boy, Tarzan's Secret Treasure repeats many of the same things from previous films. While out swimming one day, Boy finds some gold nuggets at the bottom of the lake. Jane points out to him that they would be worth a lot to the outside world, and that the family has many riches easily available to them that would be the envy of civilization. Boy is fascinated, and although he is warned he would not like it, he runs away in hopes of finding civilization and buying an airplane with his gold nuggets. On the way, he stumbles upon a sick tribe and some scientists. Through them, he gets into a lot of trouble as the scientists ruthlessly attempt to find the gold. There are many things about this film which seem a bit tired if one watches all of the Tarzan films in a row. Once again, the studio uses stock footage from a previous film, especially in the action scenes. It is quite noticable because of the advancements in film technology and in the change in appearance of the actors. Still, the interactions between the characters make these lapses in quality bearable.

The gang is living peacefully in the jungle when one day, an airplane lands nearby. Several hunters emerge in hopes of trapping wild animals, especially lions. Tarzan knows the danger of these men, so he warns them to leave, but Boy is curious about their airplane, and tries to befriend them. Seeing that they can use his repore with animals to their advantage, the hunters kidnap him and take him to New York to perform in a traveling circus. Tarzan will have none of their nonsense, regardless of the barriers between the jungle and the city. He and Jane venture to New York to find their son. One would think that Tarzan in the city would make for a great film, but we have more camp than classic here. This is not unusual for a film in the series at this period in time; ever since Boy was introduced, the series took on a more entertainment for entertainment's sake kind of a feel. It is relieving though that Tarzan and Jane did not choose to stay in the city. The couple does not quite gel in the new setting; there is a same discomfort in the book series when Tarzan enters civilization. There is one racially sensitive scene where Cheetah dials the telephone and reaches a black janitor at a nightclub. The janitor calls Cheetah ""colored boy"" and becomes offended by his ""double talk,"" suggesting that black people are the same as chimps. The scene is supposed to be funny, but it is a product of its time and does not age well at all.

Finally, this collection features several bonus features that are quite entertaining. One is a newsreel short about the filming of one of the films. We see the directors setting up a shot with an elephant, we see Weissmuller waiting around, and we see the rubber crocodiles that were used in the movies. There is a film short with Weissmuller in a short cameo role. Also included are the trailers for the films in the collection. The most exciting special feature is the documentary about the series. It focuses not only on the films, but on the book series as well. Instead of quickly glancing at the movie making process, it delves deeply into the problems with making a series and the previous attempts. It features interviews with cast members and families of the cast and of author Burroughs. Its length and detail could make it tedious to a casual fan, but those with deep interest will adore it.",1198108800,2,8844,4.622137404580153

2018504,5,B0001NBLYA,"Without a doubt, Johnny Weissmuller's interpretation of Tarzan is the best of all! An excellent swimmer, Johnny Weissmuller makes the swimming scenes seem effortless and believable. Maureen O'Sullivan as Jane provides elegance, as a gentle yet brave and courageous woman, who falls in love with a man, king of the jungle, and yet completely unaware of civilization. The house Tarzan builds for her is a marvel of progress, with the latest technological advancements... in a rudimentary... simple... basic construction. When Edgar Rice Burroughs created Tarzan he played on our survival instincts, and surfaced the innate fears of confronting savage beasts, and yet, the fantasy that we can become friends with all jungle creatures.

Tarzan and His Mate

- Simply best in class. It explores how life should have been for Adam & Eve... in love, living in paradise, respecting nature, and living in complete harmony with the environment. Not spoiling and accepting the simple things offered by our planet Earth.

Tarzan Escapes

- From civilization, Jane's cousins visit the Mutia Escarpment, only to realize that she has found true love, family, and home in Africa. The marvel of the home created by Tarzan is highlighted, with the elephant-powered elevator becoming a fascinating process to watch.

Tarzan Finds a Son!

- Here we meet a new addition to the family, played by Johnny Sheffield as Boy. Both Tarzan and Jane now have a play pal, and he does a magnificent job at allowing the audience to see how we can grow up in this environment and learn survival skills that keep him active, healthy, and self-assured. Great for a younger audience, adding fun and adventure to this wonderful set.

Tarzan's New York Adventure

One of the best scenes ever filmed is when Johnny Weissmuller dives off the Washington bridge, and makes it all look possible, doable... and easy. What precision! This movie is fun and Cheetah provides many a laugh. The struggle between good and evil are played to perfection in this series, where those in search for profit and wealth, are always trying to take advantage of the many natural treasures that surround Tarzan's simple life, and it is rewarding to see how the hero never gives in to avarice, defending and maintaining his world in its natural state.

We loved the set... and when we visit the zoo... or go to the Circus... we find ourselves looking at elephants and monkeys and saying... ""Simba... ungawa!"" ""Simba... ungawa!"" Would highly recommend acquiring this set.",1175817600,7,2507,5.036231884057971

He was talking about Tarzan and I told him that they have a collection on dvd, so I went and ordered one on Amazon. My father came over and I told him that the dvd's had arrived. I recently got a projector(that I also got on Amazon) so I set it up and we watched Tarzan the ape man and Tarzan and his mate. Wow what wonderful memories, my father and I enjoyed these movies so much. They are really fun to watch, in seeing Tarzan, my father remembered as a kid watching thes movies in theaters for a nickle. He got sentimental and so did I. It so beautiful seeing the animals helping Tarzan and the relationship they all have. These movies are so great to watch I enjoy watching these movies with my pop, I'm looking forward to seeing all the others. If your a fan of Tarzan don't hesitate get this collection.

2018506,4,B0001NBLYA,"During the Depression, movie viewers often wanted escapist fare to get away from the, well, depressing real world.  For pure escapism, few could surpass Tarzan.  A popular series of book for a couple decades and already the subject of several now almost forgotten movies, a new series of Tarzan films began in the early 1930s.  Were they great films?  No, but they were often great fun.

The six movies in this collection comprise the movies that had both Johnny Weismuller as Tarzan and Maureen O'Hara as Jane.  The first film sets the tone for the series.  In Tarzan of the Apes, Jane is part of an expedition that goes into an isolated area of Africa in search of the Elephant's Graveyard with its massive amount of ivory.  Tarzan kidnaps Jane but soon they fall in love with each other.  Tarzan is taught some English but never gets beyond simple sentences (it's obvious she doesn't love him for his conversational ability).  There are some fights with wild animals and a climatic battle with a native tribe, and in the end, Jane opts to stay with Tarzan rather than go back to civilization.

Tarzan and His Mate has the two of them referring to each other as spouses (although they are never truly married).  This is easily the most daring of the six movies, with a very scantily clad Jane throughout much of the movie and a swimming scene where she (actually a body double for O'Sullivan) wears nothing at all.  The plot once again involves a safari out to get the ivory from the Elephant's Graveyard.

In Tarzan Escapes, Jane is visited by cousins who try to bring her back to civilization because of an inheritance.  Accompanying her relatives are some seedier folks who want to cage Tarzan and use him in a circus.  As always, there are fights with animals and tribes.  This film introduces their treehouse which has all the amenities, including an elephant-powered elevator.

Tarzan Finds a Son! introduces John Sheffield as Boy.  Since the cinematic Tarzan has no explanation as to why he is in the jungle, the literary origin is used for Boy, who is part of the Greystoke family and is orphaned when his parents are killed in a plane crash.  Eventually relatives with less-than-noble intentions try and bring him home.  The original plan was to kill Jane off in this film, but initial reaction was so negative, a happier ending was given.

Tarzan's Secret Treasure has Tarzan contending with gold hunters and is probably most notable for the appearance of Tom Conway (of Cat People and the Falcon movies, among other things).  Tarzan's New York Adventure moves the hero to the concrete jungle of the Big Apple, as he and Jane seek Boy, who has been taken by a circus after the couple is believed dead.  This would be O'Sullivan's swan song as Jane, but Weismuller would continue in his role for several more movies (part of a separate collection).

While the storytelling is not always very original, footage is used over and over again (Tarzan has the same fight with a crocodile in three separate movies) and the films are not very politically correct, these flaws generally don't detract from the entertainment.  The great strength comes from the two leads who have a real chemistry.  The antics of Cheeta the chimp, however, are probably a little overdone and Boy can be a bit annoying.

The movies themselves are all high-three-star or four star fare, and there is a nice documentary on the collection (which sadly, does not discuss the later Weismuller Tarzans).  There are also a couple shorts and some movie previews, but no commentaries.  Overall, this is a four star collection.  These are not classic films (but does every movie need to be a work of art?), but they are nice escapist fare.",1173312000,9,3712,4.74414976599064

2018539,3,B0001NBLYA,"Johnny Weissmuller, an Olympic swimmer, was billed as ""the only man in Hollywood who is natural in the flesh and can act without clothes."" Maureen O'Sullivan was chosen for his mate, and the film concentrated on romance and ignored Tarzan's origins...

It was in this movie, that Tarzan becomes the unintelligible, but very sexy man-ape that most cinema-goers recognize... The famous phrase ""Me Tarzan, You Jane' was never spoken, but the film did include Tarzan constantly pointing to himself and then to Jane, enunciating ""Tarzan - Jane.""

It was in this film that Cheetah the chimpanzee made the debut... The film was an enormous success, and Weissmuller's simple native hero became the forerunner of many subsequent versions...",1168732800,5,731,5.239316239316239

2018541,5,B0001NBLYA,"TARZAN THE APE MAN is one of the best Tarzan action and adventure tales. Johnny Weissmuller's first portrayal of Tarzan will probably be remembered as his best, the benchmark. Equally Maureen O'Sullivan will always be remembered as Jane.  The villains once again meet their match, but its tough going. TARZAN THE APE MAN contains discriminating effects and exquisite photography by Clyde De Vinna and Harold Rosson, unusual from the other films in the series. Johnny Weissmuller was always the consummate professional and he gives one of his better performances here. TARZAN THE APE MAN boasts atmospheric jungle sets created by Art Director Cedric Gibbons. His brilliant set designs make an impressionable difference from the others Tarzan films. Weissmuller was the best of the loincloth-clad men of bravery, action and courage. This particular film is a testament to that. The engaging script by Cyril Hume has Tarzan jumping into action in an emotionally charged performance.
TARZAN AND HIS MATE, the first sequel, is an admirable film and rather erotic for its time. This film boasts some of the best production values, action story elements and a brilliant performance by Johnny Weissmuller. Simply put the engaging story has Tarzan swinging into action and true romance. It contains discriminating effects and exquisite photography. It has a great supporting cast. Fierce natives meet their match in this tense and absorbing drama with plenty of well-filmed action sequences as good overcomes evil jungle style.
TARZAN'S SECRET TREASURE is another favorite of mine. This admirable film is a testament to Tarzan the King of the swinging rescue. The engaging script has Tarzan ""swinging"" into action in usual fashion. This is a good action and adventure tale with the lure of gold at the center of the plot. It contains discriminating effects and beautiful photography, but is marred by sped up film in some sequences. Johnny Weissmuller was certainly the best of the loincloth-clad heroes as he demonstrates his talents as the ultimate master of swing. The villains once again meet their match in this tense drama of capture and escape.
TARZAN ESCAPES is a tough and mean Tarzan movie. Johnny Weissmuller gets you cheering in this one. It's good vs. evil all the way as Weissmuller enforces the unwritten Code of the Jungle. Directed by Richard Thorpe, this film generates a lot of energy and Tarzan sees to it that nobody is going to remove Jane or himself from their home. A favorite of mine, this excellent film is a real testament to the notion of ""kill or be killed."" This is a good hard-hitting action and adventure tale. It contains discriminating effects A. Arnold Gillespie and ravishing photography by Leonard Smith. Good supporting cast. Great score by the un-credited William Axt. The villains once again meet their match in this realistic drama. TARZAN ESCAPES is a good one.
TARZAN FINDS A SON is a good action and adventure tale with a twist. This exciting story directed by Richard Thorpe has Tarzan swinging into action changing diapers and feeding a baby. What? It contains inventive special effects, which are really good and gorgeous photography by Leonard Smith. Johnny Weissmuller was the best of the loincloth-clad heroes displaying true character as a man and father figure. This marvelous film is a testament to that. This is truly one of his best performances. I can't imagine any other actor in this role in this film. This is Good family fun and entertainment all around. My teenager even liked this one!
TARZAN'S NEW YORK ADVENTURE has a very interesting script with Tarzan swinging into action in New York City. It is a very innovative and entertaining film as this last MGM production moves Tarzan and company out of one jungle and into the concrete jungle of Manhattan. This story allowed Maureen O' Sullivan the ability to move out of her tropical habitat and into a ""civilized"" environment with more glamorous furnishings and wardrobe.  Under Richard Thorpe's direction this is a good action and an amusing adventure tale with drive. It contains nice effects and beautiful photography and has a very good supporting cast including Charles Bickford and Chill Wills. A beloved and very entertaining entry into the Tarzan saga, Weissmuller's rooftop flight once again proves he was always the absolute master of swing. TARZAN'S NEW YORK ADVENTURE is one of my favorites.",1167782400,3,4407,5.094052558782849
2018542,4,B0001NBLYA,"This movie had some amazing parts. It was also amazingly politically incorrect (but so were the books). I used to love these movies when I was little; it was a lot of fun to see them again.

The story is about a girl named Jane who comes to visit her father in Africa. They go on a journey to find an elephant burial ground. Their party is separated by an attack from dangerous spear-wielding natives. Enter Tarzan. Tarzan meets Jane and decides...well he decides he wants her in his tree. He doesn't really do anything with her, I think he was just bored and wanted something fun to look at. And he has a monkey. That's pretty much it. He plays with Jane, saves some people, and screams a lot. It is better than it sounds.

This movie has Tarzan wrestling several animals. A leopard, some sort of deer, and two lions. What amazed me was that he actually fights live animals. This isn't one of those movies where they unconvincingly fight a stuffed or animatronic animal. These animals are the real deal and let me tell you, the lions especially did not seem happy. They sure don't make movies like they used to. The scenes where Tarzan is flying through the jungle rate right up there with Spiderman for amazing and awe-inspiring acrobatic movie performances.

There is one point in the movie where Tarzan is arguing with the chimp and he gets angry and pushes the chimp. I don't know why but I laughed so hard watching that. I rewound it and watched it 5 times. I mean who does that? How often do you see a movie where someone shoves a chimpanzee. Never. You never see that in a movie. Another of my favorite scenes is when a herd of elephants stampede through a pygmy village (really just a whole lot of black midgets). And elephant runs up to a pygmy, picks him up with his trunk and throws him. I was in awe. ""How did they film that?"" I thought. How do you get an elephant to throw a midget without hurting him? I don't know, but if you watch this movie keep a lookout for that scene and maybe you can tell me.

It's a little outdated, but still a lot of fun. I think they should make a live action Tarzan movie; sort of a cross between Planet of the Apes Spiderman and King Kong; they have the technology to do it right. It could be totally awesome. They should follow the books more though. The books are great too.",1165190400,,2322,4.3310344827586205
2018543,5,B0001NBLYA,"I love classic movies but have never really been a Tarzan fan. I have seen bits and pieces of the Weismuller MGM films on TMC but never thought I'd get this set. When I saw this collection for a crazy cheap price at one of those discount big-box club stores I couldn't pass it up. When I got it home the first thing I watched was the great Tarzan documentary. This documentary alone is well worth the price I paid for the set.

The documentary features, among others, the always knowledgeable Rudy Behlmer, an Edgar Rice Burroughs historian, Weissmuller's son and the late Maureen O'Sullivan. It chronicles the origin of the Tarzan character, his early silent screen appearances and then leads into Tarzan's genesis at MGM. The lead actors (and cheeta, too) are profiled and each film gets its own segment.

There is a wealth of material in the documentary. I learned that there was originally a racy pre-code nude swimming seen in ""Tarzan and His Mate."" This was amazing as the film was shot in 1934! The scene was rediscovered and returned to the film in the 80s. O'Sullivan's Jane outfit in this film was also way ahead of its time. Among other things I also learned that the third Tarzan film, ""Tarzan Escapes,"" was completely scrapped after it was shot and an entirely new film was made (unfortunately the original version is not known to exist). I also learned that one of the screen Cheeta's who appeared in the MGM Weismuller films is still living. After a quick Google search I discovered he is still alive at 74 as of this writing (amazing as chimps aren't known to live much past 50 years).

If I was to make any complaint about the documentary I'd say that they make no mention of the series' move to RKO and the films that followed. After they get done with all the MGM Tarzans they quickly wrap-up the film. If you didn't know Weissmuller went on to make more Tarzans at RKO you'd think ""Tarzan's New York Adventure"" was the last one he ever made. Also Johnny Sheffield, Boy in all the Weismuller films, isn't in any of the interviews.

Overall this set is well worth getting.",1165017600,2,2090,4.565333333333333

2018586,5,B0001NBLYA,"I got this collection for my grandkids.  They loved it even though it didn't have all the special effects they are so used to in adventure films today. (i.e.: in the early movies you could tell Tarzan was swinging from a trapeze, the gorillas were obviously men dressed as apes) And my husband and I really enjoyed watching them with the kids.

The first original Tarzan movie of 1932 was a little more violent than the later movies.  The treatment of animals seemed harsher and Tarzan seemed a little cold blooded himself.  In later movies Jane had civilized him to some degree and he seemed more compassionate and less primitive with each movie.

The later movies were less violent and centered on Tarzan and Jane's family life in the jungle and how superior it was to the corporate jungle. Footage from one movie was often carried to the next, but it was fun to see it again.  There were some really cute and funny animal scenes involving Cheetah and the baby elephant and other baby animals which our youngest grand daughter thoroughly enjoyed.

There is a little violence in the movies that very young children should not see, but nothing very graphic.  i.e. Tarzan has to kill a charging Rhino and rides his back and stabs him.  Some of the scenes with natives involve killing.

The scenes between Tarzan, Jane and later, Boy, are very loving and tender and touched with humor.  We loved watching them and we will continue to watch them over and over I'm sure.",1141948800,2,1466,4.6434108527131785

However, all the great Weismuller/O'Sullivan films that I remember from my childhood are presented in full and in good condition.
(Did I say ""remember from my childhood""? There's certainly one scene I don't remember, because it was never shown on TV. It's the nude swimming scene in ""Tarzan and His Mate"" to which other reviewers have alluded. In fact, according to the bonus documentary included in this collection, this very sexy scene wasn't shown in theaters during initial release, either, except maybe in some sneak previews; then censors lowered the boom and the scene was reshot with a clothed Jane. Of course the nude swimmer is a body double, not O'Sullivan, but O'Sullivan looks plenty hot in her abbreviated jungle clothing that was seen only in this episode; it, too, later fell victim to the censors' veto).
It's both enjoyable and a little sad to watch these movies: Enjoyable because Weismuller and O'Sullivan remain, for most people, the definitive Tarzan and Jane; sad, because if you watch the movies one after the other, you see the sleek, cat-like young athlete, Weismuller, morph over time into a middle-aged, beefy man.

These are all of Johnny Weissmuller's MGM Tarzans in a space-saving package, beautifully remastered on three disks, and with a full disk of extras to boot. Weissmuller--one of the greatest swimmers who ever lived--WAS Tarzan in much the same way that Sean Connery IS Bond. My two tiny complaints are that the disks aren't in chronological order and that Warner Brothers seems to have been unable to release Tarzan Finds a Son in its original sepia-and-platinum print (now THAT I'd love to see). However, the uncut version of Tarzan and His Mate is here, complete with its beautiful nude underwater swimming scene--very racy stuff for 1934. (Alas, the famous bat/pygmy footage from Tarzan Escapes seems, unfortunately, to be reposing in the same circular file as the outtakes from Gone With the Wind and Greed).
I grew up watching these Tarzans on TV and I've never gotten tired of them or of Johnny Weissmuller, who has forever been one of the men I've respected most. Kids STILL love them, and with good reason--Tarzan demonstrates that man is master of his environment, that good triumphs, and that evil deeds merit the harshest of consequences. Add to this a hero who moves like no other member of Homo sapiens on the planet and who can communicate with primates and elephants and successfully fight lions and crocs, and you've got pure entertainment distilled to an average of 90 minutes per chapter.
At this price, I can afford a surprise Valentine for one of my best friends from high school, himself a former swimming champion who has always worshipped Johnny Weissmuller.

2018664,2,B0001NBLYA,"Who can forget Johnny Weissmuller's immortal yodel as the vine swinging he-man gleaned from the pages of Edgar Rice Boroughs? All six of the original Tarzan films are included in this collection. Each represents a variation on Boroughs' intriguing novel about a human baby that is raised by animals in the deep dark jungles after its parents have been killed. The baby grows up to be a man, but the man is void of all human instinct and intellect. Thus, when Tarzan reaches adulthood and stumbles across the shapely figure of Jane (Maureen O'Sullivan) he is moved to visceral prowess by his own curiosity. It's really quite an erotic concept that takes the old premise of love with a stranger to even `stranger' heights. Jane is at first attracted to Tarzan as a fascinating specimen of study - to learn from and teach in the ways of human history. But as the series progresses she grows from genuine infatuation to romantic love for her bo-hunk of the boondocks and develops an affinity for the ""really"" simple life of loin cloths, wooden tree huts and chimpanzees. The first four films (Tarzan the Ape Man, Tarzan and his Mate, Tarzan Escapes and Tarzan Finds A Son) are of a cinematic perfection in exploring the exotic romance and adventure between these two characters. But the final two installments (""Tarzan's Secret Treasure"" and ""Tarzan's New York Adventure"") are idiotic derivatives of the formula in which the series not only shows its age but glaringly misrepresents the original vision of Boroughs' novel.
THE TRANSFER: There's little to celebrate in this DVD collector's edition. Most of the films in the series suffer from a barrage of age related artifacts that create a very grainy, harsh visual presentation. The diminished picture quality improves moderately between each subsequent installment in the series. The gray scale seems poorly rendered and balanced on ""Tarzan and his Mate"" - much more so than on any of the other films in the series. The image suffers from lower contrast levels and a decided loss of fine detail in many of the scenes. There's also considerable shimmering in the background information, as though everything were shot on a matte process screen. Edge enhancement and way too much pixelization are present throughout most of these films as well as a hideous example of misregistration on Tarzan Finds A Son. For the rest of the batch - the balance and contrast is considerably better off. Ditto for the age related artifacts. In all cases the audio is mono and nicely balanced, though the critical ear will detect hiss and popping present in ""Tarzan the Ape Man"" and ""Tarzan and his Mate"". The movies are spread across four discs.
EXTRAS: There's a fantastic feature length documentary on the Tarzan phenomenon that is both comprehensive and compelling as well as some vintage short subjects. It is indeed a pity that no one thought to have an audio commentary track included for at least the first film in the series.
BOTTOM LINE: Though the MGM films take certain artistic liberties with Borough's original text, they remain the benchmark of cinematic Tarzan. The transfers, however, are below par.",1109980800,58,3146,4.948960302457467

The film picture and sound quality is at least, if not better, than when the movies played on TV. The movies are very watchable. I found them very entertaining. These movies were made between 1932 and 1942 and are still timeless. The bonus features are very informative and add to the value of the package. I am very pleased with this collection. I guess because of size differences, the 2nd movie is on the 2nd dvd. I suggest watching the movies in the original order. First is Tarzan the Ape Man. Then skip Tarzan Escapes and put in the 2nd dvd. Watch Tarzan and His Mate. Then go back to the 1st dvd and watch Tarzan Escapes. The others are in proper order. Enjoy, I know I sure did!",1096588800,15,792,4.358108108108108
2018699,5,B0001NBLYA,"Finally and about time, the release of Johnny Weissmuller on DVD in the role that he was born to play TARZAN! ~ loaded with many ""special features"" entitled ""Tarzan:Silver Screen King of the Jungle""[introduction/studio interest in Tarzan/developing the story/casting Tarzan/casting Jane/production begins/Tarzan and His Mate/the Tarzan yell/Cheeta/backlot zoo/Tarzan escapes/Tarzan Finds a Son!/Tarzan's Secret Treasure/Tarzan's New York Adventure/final thoughts/End Credits ~ plus vintage vault treasures featuring Jimmy Durante as ""Schnarzan the Conqueror""!!(from Hollywood Party) and a real treasure with MGM on location featuring Johnny Weissmuller, Tom Mix, Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, Mickey Rooney, Jackie Cooper featured in ""Rodeo Dough"" with Kokomo the Bull ~ all 6 Weissmuller/O'Sullivan Tarzan theatrical trailers.
After years of taping these off the local television stations and then when AMC ran the segments a few years ago with fairly good  prints, I'd given up of ever seeing the Tarzan films on DVD ~ but here they are in a beautifully packaged box set on four discs ~
""TARZAN THE APE MAN"" (1932) featuring Weissmuller, O'Sullivan, Neil Hamilton, C. Aubrey Smith and directed by W.S. Van Dyke.
""TARZAN AND HIS MATE"" (1934) with Weissmuller, O'Sullivan, Neil Hamilton, Paul Cavanaugh and directed by Bernard H. Hyman (this is my favorite Tarzan film - story and action sequences were way ahead of their time)
""TARZAN ESCAPES"" (1936) with Weissmuller, O'Sullivan, John Buckler, Benita Hume, William Henry and directed by Richard Thorpe.
""TARZAN FINDS A SON"" (1939) with Weissmuller, O'Sullivan, Johnny Sheffield, Ian Hunter, Henry Stephenson, Henry Wilcoxon, Laraine Day and directed by Richard Thorpe (one of the best in the early series)
""TARZAN'S SECRET TREASURE"" (1941) with Weissmuller, O'Sullivan, Johnny Sheffield, Reginald Owen, Tom Conway, Philip Dorn, Barry Fitzgerald (one of my favorite Irish Actors - with Bing Crosby and later with John Wayne) and directed by Richard Thorpe.
""TARZAN'S NEW YORK ADVENTURE"" (1942) with Weissmuller, O'Sullivan, Johnny Sheffield, Charles Bickford, Chill Wills (Francis the Talking Mule fame), Paul Kelly, Virginia Grey and directed by Richard Thorpe(which Tarzan and the rest of the cast are completely clothed in a civilized world of crooks, trying to take Boy away from Jane and Tarzan) all under the watchful eye of Edgar Rice Burroughs.
Hopefully Warner Brothers will release the next group of Weissmuller films he did for RKO Studios ~ the same quality and special features for those six films would be a welcome addition ~ just think a new generation of fans are on the brink of discovering the true Lord of the Jungle ~ TARZAN(in the guise of Johnny Weissmuller)...gotta love it!

2018700,2,B0001NBLYA,"Who can forget Johnny Weissmuller's immortal yodel as the vine swinging he-man gleaned from the pages of Edgar Rice Boroughs? All six of the original Tarzan films are included in this collection. Each represents a variation on Boroughs' intriguing novel about a human baby that is raised by animals in the deep dark jungles after its parents have been killed. The baby grows up to be a man, but the man is void of all human instinct and intellect. Thus, when Tarzan reaches adulthood and stumbles across the shapely figure of Jane (Maureen O'Sullivan) he is moved to visceral prowess by his own curiosity. It's really quite an erotic concept that takes the old premise of love with a stranger to even `stranger' heights. Jane is at first attracted to Tarzan as a fascinating specimen of study - to learn from and teach in the ways of human history. But as the series progresses she grows from genuine infatuation to romantic love for her bo-hunk of the boondocks and develops an affinity for the ""really"" simple life of loin cloths, wooden tree huts and chimpanzees. The first four films (Tarzan the Ape Man, Tarzan and his Mate, Tarzan Escapes and Tarzan Finds A Son) are of a cinematic perfection in exploring the exotic romance and adventure between these two characters. But the final two installments (""Tarzan's Secret Treasure"" and ""Tarzan's New York Adventure"") are idiotic derivatives of the formula in which the series not only shows its age but glaringly misrepresents the original vision of Boroughs' novel.
THE TRANSFER: There's little to celebrate in this DVD collector's edition. Most of the films in the series suffer from a barrage of age related artifacts that create a very grainy, harsh visual presentation. The diminished picture quality improves moderately between each subsequent installment in the series. The gray scale seems poorly rendered and balanced on ""Tarzan and his Mate"" - much more so than on any of the other films in the series. The image suffers from lower contrast levels and a decided loss of fine detail in many of the scenes. There's also considerable shimmering in the background information, as though everything were shot on a matte process screen. Edge enhancement and way too much pixelization are present throughout most of these films as well as a hideous example of misregistration on Tarzan Finds A Son. For the rest of the batch - the balance and contrast is considerably better off.  Ditto for the age related artifacts. In all cases the audio is mono and nicely balanced, though the critical ear will detect hiss and popping present in ""Tarzan the Ape Man"" and ""Tarzan and his Mate"". The movies are spread across four discs.
EXTRAS: There's a fantastic feature length documentary on the Tarzan phenomenon that is both comprehensive and compelling as well as some vintage short subjects. It is indeed a pity that no one thought to have an audio commentary track included for at least the first film in the series.
BOTTOM LINE: Though the MGM films take certain artistic liberties with Borough's original text, they remain the benchmark of cinematic Tarzan. The transfers, however, are below par.",1088121600,21,3147,4.948960302457467

2018702,2,B0001NBLYA,"The discs I received in this package are full of fingerprint smugges and some kind of grimy dust.  One disc has a scratch near the center hole.  Please CHECK the conditions of your discs.  I had a similar problem with another MGM title ""Green Acres Season 1"" and had to go through 3 sets before I found one that was somewhat acceptable.  Some players, like mine, are very sensitive to these anomolies.  Someone at MGM Home Entertainment is not watching their quality control very carefully.",1087430400,11,490,4.7176470588235295
2018703,5,B0001NBLYA,"I've been waiting for these films to be released on DVD ever since I got my DVD player in January, 2001. I was born in 1954 and grew up watching them on TV. Tarzan was without a doubt my favorite hero and Johnny Weissmuller was Tarzan. One of the biggest thrills of my youth was meeting Johnny when he came to my hometown in 1967. He gave me two photos of himself which I still have. The packaging of this set is excellent, first class all the way. The documentary is very interesting. I only wish that Johnny Sheffield could have been interviewed. It was great to see Cheeta still going strong at 72 years old. The theatrical trailers were fun to watch, and the other ""special features"" were great, also. I especially enjoyed the short documentary shot during the filming of ""Tarzan Finds A Son"" at Silver Springs, Florida. Before I purchased the set, I was concerned about the picture quality of the six feature films. But, when I watched them, I was very pleased. After years of seeing them on TV, it was good to view them via the high resolution of the DVD format. When and if the six RKO Tarzan/Weissmuller films are released on DVD, I pray that Warner Video will do the honors.",1087257600,114,1183,4.431192660550459
2018704,5,B0001NBLYA,"Umgawa!  This DVD boxed set is great!  Love these classic old movies. Tarzan was to the 1930s what James Bond was to the 1960s -- a cultural phenomenon. Sure these movies are preposterous and even silly -- an African Never-Never Land, but they're still splendid entertainment. 1934's ""Tarzan and His Mate"" is one of the greatest fantasy/adventure films of all time. Johnny Weissmuller is still an icon. I've owned all six of these movies before on VHS and laserdisc, and they look best here on DVD. The early '30s pictures aren't in as pristine a shape as the later ones from 1939 to 1942, but they still look damn good for their age. The documentary on disc six is an excellent one as well, and the packaging is some of the best ever done for a classic film series on DVD. A nice big banana to Warner Home Video for this one!",1086739200,14,826,4.427631578947368
