8405630,5,B003U4IPWS,Anytime a race fan can learn more information about one of their favorite sports feel they should do so. This dvd does help expand knowledge.,1436572800,,141,4.68
8405631,5,B003U4IPWS,"I got this DVD because I really wanted to have 1965 Sebring 12 Hour Race Footage and it is included as an ""Bonus Feature"" on this dvd,Although it is not Re-Mastered(neither are the Indy races.)So you might need to put the volume up higher,Sadly the Sebring Footage is Short and short on Corvette(except for Delmo Johnson and Dave Morgan in the #1 At the Start Leading the race in The Grand Sport,and briefly the #2 George Wintersteen Grand Sport with Peter Goetz & Milt Diehl,which are my favorites and the highlights for me.)Of Course the Beautiful Chevrolet Powered Chaparral's sticking it To Ford and Ferrari stand out for me. As for the Indy Races they are pretty nice to look at and sometimes sad since there was tragedy in both races on this dvd.
There is Not Much if ANY footage of any of the Stock Block Chevy that I can tell or mention of them except Ford.and The Hype about the New (Then New) Rear-Engine Invasion with Lotus-Ford versus the Traditional Offy and minor Drake-Offy. Beautiful Sights and Sounds of an Bygone Era in Racing,Sebring is The Highlight for me,The Rainsoaked Sportscar Race that year was one-of-an-kind specifically for someone As Young as me who was not even around back then to witness it.",1360972800,,1224,4.6976744186046515
