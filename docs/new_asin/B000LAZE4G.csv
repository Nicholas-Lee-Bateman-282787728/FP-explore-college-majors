2701200,1,B000LAZE4G,"The book was interesting and more complex.  The movie was flat and lacked panache.

If you have not read the book in print and have some time, get an AUDIO version of the book.  Your mind will love Patchett's writing and will form its own vibrant pictures.",1322006400,,256,4.404255319148936
8160551,2,B000LAZE4G,Two stars are for Dana Delaney and Sada Thompson who tried valiantly to sav this awful movie.  This is one of those movies that leaves you thinking  that huge chunks were left on the cutting room floor. Dana Delaneys character supposedly has some deep dark secret that causes her to leave people. Shes this tragic figure whose past sins make her unredeemable but apparently give her a license to hurt others. BUT you are never told what this secret is. She magically overcomes this and everyone is suppose to welcome her back with open arms. The spring thing is a strange side story. Dont waste your time.,1519171200,,605,4.644859813084112
8160552,1,B000LAZE4G,"There wasn't even an obscure closure to the story line. Kept waiting for the explanation, some type of connection....never happened. Disappointing waste of time. Good cast. my guess is complete failure during the editing.",1518912000,,221,5.529411764705882
8160553,5,B000LAZE4G,More movies like this.,1518220800,,22,4.75
8160554,1,B000LAZE4G,"No story at all.  Just a mentally detached woman hurting a lot of people.
Please do not waste your time
It is awful.",1517011200,,116,4.043478260869565
8160555,5,B000LAZE4G,I don't know why this film didn't receive more stars. I thought it was a great story and good acting.,1515628800,,101,4.1
8160556,5,B000LAZE4G,I liked how she kept her baby and her going back started the spring flowing,1514678400,,75,4.066666666666666
8160557,1,B000LAZE4G,Wow.  What did I just waste my time watching?  No clue what this was about other than a very emotionally detached woman.,1514246400,,120,4.409090909090909
8160558,3,B000LAZE4G,"3 stars for the acting.. but what on Earth was the miracle of the Spring?  After you watch it maybe you can tell me.. The only connection I can make of the ""miraculous spring"" is some really bizarre abstract convoluted "" Cabin Fever"" of a sort.  One was an actual sickness and the other was well, some sort of mental block???? I suggest you watch it.... and then give me some off the wall explanation.",1511827200,,401,4.333333333333333
8160559,2,B000LAZE4G,"Not sure what the plot was since the script was rather lacking, but Dana Delaney, Ellen Burstyn, and Sada Thompson did a pretty good job to try to save this movie. Maggie Grynnenhal was in a cameo.",1504396800,,197,4.351351351351352
8160560,5,B000LAZE4G,Very good entertainment for a chick-flick.,1423267200,,42,6.166666666666667
