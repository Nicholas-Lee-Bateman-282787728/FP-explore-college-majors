8353403,5,B0026P61G4,"I got this collection for my (grown) daughter who's really into the anime thing, the funnier stuff and various TV series.  I can't begin to name most of what she has in her collection.  When I got her the complete ""Little Princess Yucie"" she turned into a seven-year-old again.  I give it five stars just for the sheer delight it brought my daughter.  She had searched everywhere and even ordered it a couple of times only to have it fall through.  That happened to me once here on amazon.com.  I was quite the happy camper to get an order that didn't fall out on me.  It was more than worth the money since it was the 6-disc complete collection.  I admit I haven't actually watched it, but I get reports.  One day I'll be able to sit down a see it.  Well, I have seen a bit here and a piece there.  The animation appears to be typical with the mouths moving differently from the dialogue, but that's just the translation thing, no big deal.  The detail looks very good.  Or was that Inuyasha??
