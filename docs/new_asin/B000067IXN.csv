1721596,3,B000067IXN,"I saw most of this on TV last Sunday night (1:00am Monday morning). That time slot is dubious at best, often it's junk but occasionally redeems itself.

For a B movie i actually liked this. Yes the story is very cliched, but making the ""hero"" an ""actor"" (e.g., ""i'm not a hero but i play one on TV"") added just enough of a quirk to take it out of the totally mundane (plus the girl he was trying to save had broken up with him). It isn't too pretentious, and there was something about the characters that was likeable enough that i cared what happened.

Robert Forster did an excellent job as the hero's ""mentor"" and the bikers weren't too retarded, especially Hank Dillon who did a good job as well. Also there's the usual dufus town sheriff who tries to save the town by being a total coward.

This is not a movie you'd want to pay to see in a theater, but as a cheap rental or on TV it's not a complete waste. Maybe on the same level as a Steven Seagal, not as good as a Jackie Chan, but much better than some of the lower level of the same type (though maybe not worth the time i just spent typing this). But then i'm always a sucker to see the good guys win in the end, even if i know what's going to happen. Plus i didn't want to go to sleep and have to wake up for work on Monday morning.

(P.S. i loved the beat that played at the end, and the credits song that followed, which was Streets of Laredo played by either Headstones or Randy Kiss(?); i've found Headstones to download but not this song, would love to find it.)",1147737600,8,1530,4.107023411371237
1721597,2,B000067IXN,"This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  The only really good thing about this movie was Lou Diamond Phillips.  Admittedly, the only reason I picked this movie up is because he is on the cover.  I came very close to turning the movie off, it was just sooo ridiculous.",1099008000,,288,4.107142857142857
1721598,5,B000067IXN,"I saw parts of this movie on HBO while flipping between channels looking for something worthwhile to watch.  I thought this made for HBO movie was far from what I was looking for.  After seeing parts of it probably half a dozen times and being drawn in, I finally sat down and watched it from beginning to end.

This movie has a straightforward simple plot.  At a glance it looks like Hollywood stock and the average back cover synopsis at the movie store wouldn't lead you to believe different.  But, this film is of higher quality.  The writing is good, even witty.  The acting is good.  The action is a vehicle to the plot, not center stage.  It is a light, benevolent, and heroic movie, with action as its backdrop.

Unfortunately I haven't seen anything else written or directed by Ken Sanzel worth recommending.",1077667200,17,817,4.611111111111111
1721629,3,B000067IXN,"I enjoyed Lou in this movie, I thought he did a good job.",1429315200,,57,3.4615384615384617
1721630,5,B000067IXN,Excellent movie.  Lou Diamond Phillips played a awesome part.,1424304000,,61,5.777777777777778

1721632,4,B000067IXN,"Corny, outlaw bikers vs small town hicks!  Great! Not bloody, but lots of killing and goofy wild west re-enactments with fake cowboy becoming real life hero. Did I say Lou Diamond Phillips was hot?",1396915200,,197,4.794117647058823
1721633,3,B000067IXN,"Plot was fairly predictable through out the movie, but had some very funny and original scenes at times. I enjoyed it.",1380412800,,118,4.666666666666667
1721634,5,B000067IXN,I always enjoy a great action filled movie even if it has a b movie quality to it. I thought this was pretty well done though with great action. Lou Diamond Phillips did a cool job as the main biker bad guy. I'm a big fan of Shaun Patrick though I mean how can you go wrong with one of the boondock saints kicking but. I was waiting to see brother Reedus join him but I know that's another movie so. I will add this to my collection of movies though it is worthy.,1376956800,,463,3.9361702127659575
1721635,3,B000067IXN,The movie was goofy and the biggest saving grace was the fact that Lou Diamond Phillips was the villain.  Love that guy.  I just wish the would quit making the bikers the bad guys.  It is so different in real life.,1376179200,,214,4.170731707317073
1721636,5,B000067IXN,i watched this movie one night just bc there was nothing else on and I LOVED IT !! i thought it was great ..iv'e watched it about 20 times since and have just bought it .,1375315200,,170,3.75
1721637,3,B000067IXN,"Bikers are bad, civilians are good. Same story with a different cast. Lou Diamond Phillips does play a great bad guy though",1368489600,,123,4.636363636363637
1721638,4,B000067IXN,"Lone hero is one of those movies that proves you don't need a big budget to make a enjoyable movie. Lou diamond phillips is great as the leader of the iron bandits. He plays the bad guy very well and has some great lines. And sean patrick flanery is great as the reluctant hero. The movie never gets bogged down either moving at a pretty consistent pace with plenty of action along the way all leading to the eventual shoot out between the iron bandits and townspeople. Lone hero is a great movie to pop in when you don't want to think to hard or be amazed by multi million dollar effects. To me it has everything a good movie needs memorable heroes and villians, good writing with some memorable lines and a decent amount of action delivered at a steady pace.",1346976000,,760,4.359154929577465
1721649,5,B000067IXN,"I loved this movie. It was full of action and moved along at a very nice clip. Very well cast. Lou Diamond Phillips is very believable as Bad Bart. Sean Patrick Flanery is outstanding as John, the Lone Hero. I loved the ending and the fact that it keeps SPF front and center through out the entire movie.",1313366400,,304,4.258620689655173
1721650,3,B000067IXN,"Lone Hero - Lou Diamond Philips is a pretty good ""bad guy"" in this movie.  Plot is a little weak, but fun to watch anyway.",1294876800,,122,3.88
1721651,5,B000067IXN,Product arrived on time and in good condition.  I would purchase again in the future.,1286064000,,85,4.666666666666667
1721652,4,B000067IXN,"I'll agree with the previous writer, it's pretty cool seeing Lou Diamond Phillips (LDP) play a ""bad-guy.""  The action is alright and there is a cool lookin' bike in the movie.  Though most of the Outlaw Club that LDP is riding with are on old Jap' bikes.  It's a decent movie but it's short (under 90 minutes).  Good in some ways, since the ""towns people"" seem to be extras that were given speaking roles?!

(Free advice; Take it for what it worth.  I really like ""Beyond the Law"" with Charlie Sheen.  LOTS of bikes, babes and booze!)",1262822400,,534,4.443298969072165
1721653,4,B000067IXN,"Standard story of a biker gang taking over a town, the story starts with bikers robbing a bar and injuring the bartender. The bikers tell everyone in the bar that if any one tells who committed the crime, the gang will take revenge on them and their families. - Some one did not listen; you know the rest of the story.

Lone hero is an entertaining, low-budget variant of  ""High Noon"", a modern day western featuring bikers

If you are looking for a meaningful cinematic experience don't bother you will be disappointed, if you're looking for an entertaining shoot 'em up, this is for you.

To bad drive ins are a thing of the past, seeing Lou Diamond Phillips portraying a villain with a sense of humor on a huge screen in an out door setting would have been a real treat.",1259712000,2,773,4.422535211267606
1721654,4,B000067IXN,"This film, common to most biker films, plot was actually done in true form
Lot's of action, explosions, stunts & a little western action as well. Kept my interest to the end.",1239494400,2,174,4.46875
1721655,4,B000067IXN,"I view this movie as a low budget Biker movie which held my interest and was consistant as to my expectations of Lou Diamond Phillips who performed excellent. Supporting actors did a fine job as well. The location where it was filmed reminded me of ""Ghost Town"" in Maggie Valley North Carolina.",1238457600,6,294,4.673076923076923
1721656,3,B000067IXN,"The acting was good, the story was alright and it was interesting to see Lou Diamond Philips play a bad guy.  For some reason Hollywood seems to think that the only way to make a guy seem tough is to have them say the ""F"" word & ""G D"" over and over again.  Almost all the bikes were Hondas, most were Honda Magnas and Shadows.  The Harley at the end of the movie did not seem to be in the rest of the movie and there was one HD Sportster, with a long front end, but if there were any other HD's I missed them. Boy, these were some big tough bikers on their 750 Honda's.",1225756800,,569,3.8879310344827585
1721657,4,B000067IXN,"This movie was not the most well written. However, the acting by the three lead characters saved this move and actually made it enjoyable to watch. The action was decent, and I would recommend it to anyone who is not too snobish with their movies.",1213660800,,247,4.511111111111111
1721658,4,B000067IXN,I got this because Lou Diamond was in it. I had no idea what it was going to be like. I was tired of getting movies that were not any good so I was looking for stars that I enjoy. I was so surprised. LDP plays a bad guy and does it so well. This is one that turned out to be fun and I am so glad I bought it. I always like Robert Forster and He was great also.,1190246400,10,360,3.45679012345679

7963621,2,B000067IXN,"This is a pretty decent ""B"" movie Sean Patrick Flannery(Boondock Saints, Dexter) in an early role as the ""Cowboy"" small town hero with Lou Diamond Phillips(La bamba) as the big bad biker president. Biggest complaints are as a villian Lou isn't menacing enough or quite evil enough, the confrontations end up being somewhat anti climactic between hero and villian. Most of all coming from a family of bikers they try to pass off so many junk bikes as Harley choppers",1496793600,,465,4.825
7963622,2,B000067IXN,As Phillips has always been one of my favorite over the year I did not like him in this part but it was a fair movie.,1487462400,,117,3.5384615384615383
