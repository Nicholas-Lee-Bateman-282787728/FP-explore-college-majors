8475146,5,B005IWG568,"I recently purchased the Functional Fitness Diabetes DVD after seeing a snippet on YouTube. With diabetes running in our family, I thought it would be helpful. I just tried it and am really happy.

The DVD is geared toward middle-aged adults but also seems great for seniors. The instructor is a woman named Suzanne Andrews who's an occupational therapy practitioner, so I think that's also a plus. While the DVD shows Suzanne doing the exercises, I like that it also has a woman doing a modified version of the routine as she's sitting in a chair as well as a man who is able to give it a bit more energy. Every movement is low-impact. I could definitely see this being beneficial for anyone who has back or leg problems or who might be wheelchair bound. It's family friendly so I can exercise by myself or gently nudge my husband or mother-in-law to join me.

You can definitely get a good 25 minute workout without killing yourself. Also, you can use common household items for weight and resistance training. It's cheaper than buying straps, dumbbells and kettle bells. I have those items but my older family members don't, so it's nice that they can use stuff that's already in their house if they want to borrow the DVD. There's also some additional information for diabetics about choosing shoes and eating healthy. All good info!

The exercises get you going but are not what I'd call strenuous. There's a warm-up phase and then the pace picks up, but it's not a pace that's exhausting. Suzanne uses movements that flow. She also incorporates some gentle yoga poses at the end to give you a good stretch. Although this program is pretty gentle I would suggest keeping some juice nearby just in case your blood sugar gets a little low.

I especially like that the instructor tells you how to get in touch with her if you have questions or comments. I think that's a great touch. This DVD is definitely a nice option for anyone with diabetes and would probably helpful to people with back injuries or mobility issues. This was a good buy and would absolutely recommend this.",1329350400,4,2080,4.659400544959128
8475147,5,B005IWG568,"This year I decided to tackle my diabetes since my doctor told me that once a person has diabetes one can also expect poor performance of other body organs. However, medical science has proven that diabetes can be prevented or delayed with proper diet and exercise. However, while many cook books and menus are particularly created for diabetic patients and persons there aren't as many diabetic focused exercises.

Fortunately this functional fitness workout focuses on preventing or delaying diabetes complications that's out in the market today. This workout helps normalize blood sugar, increase blood circulation, reduce blood pressure, decrease insulin resistance and of course helps lose weight.

8475148,5,B005IWG568,"If you are a person with type 2 diabetes, I strongly suggest you view this Functional Fitness Diabetes DVD. It contains tips on the best way for people with type 2 diabetes to exercise, tips about blood sugar control and what to wear on your feet. Each workout provides both a seated version and a standing version so if you have sores or neuropathy or other trouble with your feet you can still get a healthy workout. Suzanne also explains how exercise and eating healthy can help people with type 2 diabetes get off of insulin and potentially stop diabetes from progressing. You'll find the DVD plus size and senior friendly. There is an informative introduction at the beginning which you can listen to before doing the DVD for the first time, and after that you can press the skip button (>) and it will go directly to the beginning of the workout.

8475149,5,B005IWG568,"I really like Suzanne's perspective on the DVD. She is not just an ""exercise guru,"" but she is an occupational therapist by training. So she really knows about how to specifically train for functional fitness.

She gears this DVD for diabetics by including exercises which increase circulation, are geared for heart health, and preventing neuropathies. There is also a section on how to choose the best shoes for diabetics and a special bonus section giving you 7 Diabetes Tips for Exercise. The two 25 minute workouts are simple and straightforward, with an optional chair version making the exercises accessible for seniors and plus size. The dialogue at the beginning is good to listen to the first time, but it can get tedious hearing it repeatedly. The DVD comes with simple instructions to let you know that you can skip the intro very easily by pressing your next button on your remote and going directly to the workout.

Suzanne is very inspiring with her personal success in transforming her body with fat loss and toning. Her pleasant style makes it easy to watch and follow. Her energy and enthusiasm is very motivating making this a winner and easy enough for people who want to get started but haven't exercised in a long time.
