5058733,3,B0076YFJRC,It was cute but not really that funny to me. The reviews said it was hilarious. I beg to differ. i worked the race track over 20 years and some of the jokes some people would not understand. Sadly I was extremely dissapointed,1352937600,,225,4.255813953488372

8511335,5,B0076YFJRC,"Being a fan of horse racing & of comedy, I enjoyed this movie very much. Being able to tease the trainers I know that had cameos in this picture, priceless! ;-)",1418428800,,160,4.193548387096774
8511336,4,B0076YFJRC,"Was better than what I thought it would be. Pretty funny! Had some twists to it that I liked. A movie about losing trainer who is being filmed, because he is not so good.",1379548800,,170,4.029411764705882
8511337,1,B0076YFJRC,"Didn't think I could ever see a movie more stupid than Dumb and Dumber, but this one proved they're out there!!!  Nothing entertaining..... just stupid..... and NOT comparable to ""Best In Show""!!!!!  Poor attempt at using stupidity in an effort to create comedy.  I actually threw it away!",1377475200,,289,4.979166666666667
8511338,4,B0076YFJRC,"This movie was not what I thought it would be, as it was sorta a goofy comedy, and I thought it would just be a regular drama.  But you do get your money's worth in laughs out of it.  Sean Astin is really funny.  My whole family liked this movie and we have watched it several time.",1353542400,,282,3.912280701754386
