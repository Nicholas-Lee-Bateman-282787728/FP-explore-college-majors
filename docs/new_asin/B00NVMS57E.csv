8680478,4,B00NVMS57E,Good video for stretching. Still have not completed the entire session but am working on it!,1521331200,,92,4.8125
8680479,5,B00NVMS57E,This was good.  Got it to stretch my psoas.  It does.  Gave me some exercises to do daily.,1518912000,,90,3.888888888888889
8680480,5,B00NVMS57E,"It is really helped my body alignment.  I highly recommend it.  It is an hour long, I'd rather do the it in 30 to 40 min. But probably wouldn't get the full benefit in a shortened version.",1428969600,,188,4.054054054054054
8680481,5,B00NVMS57E,"The Psoas muscle makes it possible for hip flexion, a supine spine, rotation of the spine, and lateral movement of the torso. It is the deepest muscle in the body. So it's function is crucial to our being able to stand and walk up right which is one of the characteristics that makes us human. It follows then that maintaining the health of the psoas is essential to our overall health.
  Aparna has thoughtfully developed a marvelous series of exercises that access the psoas, that make us aware of the muscle, aids in strengthening it, and helps us learn how to relax it. There are two levels of practice on this DVD which can be varied as desired.
  As always it is Aparna's beautiful sonorous voice that guides us through the poses. The quality of her voice reassures us while at the same time it allows us to focus on being our natural selves, doing exactly what our body can do right now. We see Aparna gracefully demonstrating every movement while her calm voiceover instructions lead us seamlessly through the flow.
  I highly recommend this DVD as an important addition to your weekly practice. I am fortunate to take class with Aparna in person three times a week, but have added the Psoas DVD to my home practice. I can see too that it would be an excellent tool for recovering from a hip or back injury. Also it can be used to regain strength after an illness. Here is another opportunity to be guided by this superb  teacher.",1418601600,4,1438,4.528957528957529
8680482,4,B00NVMS57E,"This video, if done consistently 2-3 times a week, can address your hip & back pain. I drive for a majority of my day and had experienced constant pain in my lower back & sciatica. Since I have attended to my psoas and done yoga faithfully, my pain has gratefully gone away. I recommend this video as Aparna Levine's choreography and technique are, as always, flawless and are ideal for supporting symetrical, strengthening stretching& development of the psoas.",1417910400,,461,4.923076923076923
8680483,5,B00NVMS57E,"As a desk dweller working in a stressful environment, I truly appreciate the Psoas Vinyasa DVD by Aparna Levine.  It's like having a private session with this gifted instructor.  The video is divided into two one-hour sessions.  Practice 1 incorporates vinyassa flow designed to acquaint the student with this important but often neglected muscle. Poses designed to access and stretch the psoas are interwoven with traditional vinyassa.  Practice 2 is my favorite and provides an opportunity for more stretching and strengthening of the psoas.  Aparna skillfully demonstrates all of the poses, while offering modifications for every skill level.  With her talent for detailed narration, you can concentrate on your own practice and for the most part, won't be distracted trying to watch the video.  I highly recommend any of Aparna's videos, but this one is especially therapeutic for those of us whose bodies are stressed by too much time sitting in front of a computer.",1415577600,3,971,5.225806451612903
8680484,5,B00NVMS57E,"This DVD is a calm contemplative introduction to working with a muscle that is difficult to identify and access. The instruction is clear and concise with helpful modifications provided if needed, depending on the experience of the practitioner. The progression of the poses is insightful and skilled. This is very enjoyable and informative for all levels including instructors wanting to inform their psoas knowledge and skills.
I have been a student of yoga for 5 years with various instructors, 2 years with Aparna. Her DVDs and CDs are reflective of her practice if not her personal foundation. A sincere and highly knowledgable practitioner, she excels in imparting her knowledge to the participant whether in class or virtually. A highly recommended yoga DVD you will reference over and over.
Namaste...",1415318400,2,809,5.27906976744186
8680485,5,B00NVMS57E,"After taking a psoas workshop from Aparna to learn the exercises included in this DVD, I have been applying these to my regular yoga practice and I have noticed a huge improvement in my lower back strength and hip flexibility.  With frequent lower back pain, I've had to be very careful of what I do in yoga to keep from straining my back into a spasm.  Now, I'm pleasantly surprised that I can jump my feet back to plank with no problem and many more poses are now open to me.  Being a student of Vinyasa yoga, I really enjoy both series in the DVD as they are integrated into a flow.  I will practice with this DVD probably for the rest of my life!
With my humble honors to Aparna,

8680486,5,B00NVMS57E,"I am a huge fan of Aparna Levine DVDs and I highly recommend this one! I know of no other DVD of this quality that focuses on the vital psoas ""wonder muscle"". She gives us two full vinyasas for accessing, releasing, and strengthening this muscle with a beautifully calm and encouraging voice guiding you and clear demonstrations of each pose. The production of this DVD is simple and straightforward; you will feel like you are having a private session with Aparna. As someone who basically ""lost"" a lot of psoas function after cancer treatment, I can say that recovery of psoas function is worth every minute spent in this kind of therapy. I recommend incorporating a subset of these poses into your daily practice and then returning to this DVD as you are able to continue to educate and refine your practice. You will see benefit in all aspects of your daily activities, yoga practice, and overall well-being.",1411948800,,912,4.7784810126582276
