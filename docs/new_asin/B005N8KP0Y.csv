8480230,5,B005N8KP0Y,"Season three (3) of the British series ""Street"" entertained me greatly.  In Season three (3) on two (2) discs with six (6) episodes that are an hour in length, is superbly written, directed and wonderfully acted.  This season (as in the other two) is about ""working class"" and very ordinary folks that live on a street in Northern England.  We, the audience, in Season three (3) get to meet and get a peek at some very interesting folks going about their ""ordinary""  lives and having some extraordinary ""happenings"" happen to them.

 One of my very favorite episodes is about an extremely bigoted man that hates everyone that is different than he is especially the Polish.  He is very willing to express his hatred most vehemently.  He is accused erroneously of rescuing a little Polish girl from a burning building.  When it's found out, especially by the mother of the girl, that he is not the hero he has been pretending to be, he, of course, suffers the ramifications thereof.  However, by this time he is in love with the Polish mom and has tempered some of his hatred--my god, what a good episode that is not preachy but just fabulously acted, written and directed. Another very fine episode deals  with an alcoholic father coming to grips with his long lost retarded son and how the eventual love of this son helps  him to pull his life together. The ""road"" to him loving his son is very ""rocky"" indeed.  All six (6) episodes are tremendous.

Season three (3) is great and if you enjoyed the other seasons, you are certain to adore this season; I know that I did.  Put the kiddies to bed and curl up with some adult entertainment.",1320537600,4,1637,4.596551724137931
