6164232,5,B00HHYF59S,"We rented it on Time Warner and I had huge expectations. It remained true to the book except for Elvis, but I can see that would be an additional expense to a low budget film. Yelchin is a wonderful Odd Thomas and Timlin is amazing as Stormy. They really seemed to fit naturally to each other and Dafoe was excellent as the Police Chief. I'm not sure how it plays to someone who has not read the book, but I liked the flashbacks to show how actions played out after Odd figures out what's going on. The bad guys come off well so you don't quite see them as bad guys until the end but it's not a big leap when you see them as bad guys in the end.

The end was very emotional and it shows the high quality of actors and excellent direction by Sommers. I thought it was funny to see Arnold Vosloo playing a bit role of Tom but I think that's the relationship between Vosloo and Sommers from the Mummy movies that made that happen. I liked it the first time I saw it but have watched it three times now and love it. It's definitely a must buy for me.",1391990400,83,1046,4.053140096618358
6164233,5,B00HHYF59S,"If you're an Odd Thomas fan, you are going to like this movie.  Of course it's not exactly like the book, but that's to be expected.  They got the gist of Odd  and that's what counts.  It's got the quirkiness I've grown to associate with the book series and Odd is just as endearing.  My rule for watching book adaptations is ""watch it twice"".  The first time is to see how it compares to the book and the second time is to enjoy it as it's own separate entity.  I've been waiting for this movie to happen for a long time and I was not disappointed.",1391817600,70,549,4.122641509433962
6164234,5,B00HHYF59S,"When I notice a CD release that is based on a book, I don't pay much attention, because the movie never compares to a well written, page turner. Well, this movie was filled with great character studies, and I ended up watching the entire movie. It not only had great stuff for us Dean Koontz fans, it had a study of a young, gifted man who, instead of bumbling through the plot, is really a damn smart hero.  His girlfriend isn't some giggly girl in love. It's a more mature love for each other that is really touching as the two of them fight evil.",1391731200,5,549,4.228571428571429
6164235,5,B00HHYF59S,"This movie was the closest product to the book that I could have imagined. The trend in movies is to change very important aspects of the movie to fit time frames, but this movie sticks to the plot line, and the casting couldn't have been any better. Anton Yelchin is a perfect Odd Thomas, and the attitude that Addison Timlin brings to Stormy Llewellyn's character is spot-on! Buy with confidence. You'll love Odd Thomas!",1391558400,123,422,4.716216216216216

6164237,5,B00HHYF59S,"I really liked it.  I have read many of Koontz's books, Odd Thomas being a book with a character that has his own series so to speak, I think there's about 4 now that feature him.  I haven't read this book but others that feature him; so I can't say how close to the book this is.  However I can see it can be difficult to translate a book into film so I rate this movie on it's own merit.  Despite some of the negative reviews I think the main actors did a great job.  True, the ""I see dead people"" has been done before... but so have a lot of themes; that doesn't mean each movie and book has to be totally original. Besides if you'll watch this, then take a chance on reading some of Koontz's books you'll find that he can be very, very original.  My only complaint- I don't think there was enough set up for the bad guys to become enough of the terror they could have been, but I think this movie was more about Odd and Stormy.  In his novels his antagonist are given much more depth.  Thanks for reading",1523404800,,1008,4.081218274111675

6164244,2,B00HHYF59S,"It could have been worse, I guess, or much, much better. The very worst thing about this picture is all of the dialog, which unfortunately consists almost entirely of incessant, cutesy-pie sass & drollery. All of the main characters indulge themselves in it to a degree meriting a slap in the head, & all while wearing these identical, self-satisfied, smarmy little grins. I kept picturing Quasimodo trying to sit through this, covering his ears & swaying in pain while crying out, ""The banter, ..the banter ...!!!""
  So many questions arise. Would this guy really not know his girlfriend loves him, if she didn't coo so much and sashay around addressing him by one sugary pet-name after another, while he moseys along gazing into some middle-distance & muttering astutely self-conscious, offhand responses? ..I don't know ..... Would the audience somehow forget the ironical significance of his first name actually being ""Odd"", if he & the chick & the cop were to quit constantly making reference to it? ..Maybe ..... Are battling demons and trying to avert mass murder or Armageddon (or whatever the hell this thing was about) really this easy so long as you do it with such insistent breeziness & whimsy? ..Who can say? ..... Who would be the target audience this was made for, and what grade are they in? ..Hmmm .....
  And, here's something else. - Why are all the worst reviews for this movie stacked up at the far end of the reviews listing, without any ordering as to dates submitted, etc? Is this the thing now, to bury anything that might discourage a purchase?",1519603200,,1571,4.828996282527881

6164252,4,B00HHYF59S,"RELEASED IN 2013 and written & directed by Stephen Sommers based on Dean Koontz novel, ""Odd Thomas"" chronicles events in a small California desert town where the eponymous young man (Anton Yelchin), a short-order cook,  has the paranormal gift of discerning of spirits wherein he can see into the spirit realm. Not only can he see dead people, ghosts stuck on this plane, he can also see the activities of evil spirits, which he calls bodachs. His gift informs him that theres going to be a mass murder in town and thus the wicked bodachs are gathering in droves. The police chief (Willem Dafoe) is aware of Odd's psychic gifts and works with him to prevent the carnage.

I didn't know anything about this movie or the Dean Koontz series before viewing and was pleasantly surprised by this eccentric black comedy/mystery/horror. While its not necessarily great overall, it has elements of greatness. For instance, the depiction of evil spirits and their activities, the way they're drawn to evil & fear like flies to dog doo-doo, is easily the best cinematic portrayal of demons Ive ever seen. The movies nigh enlightening on this front.

Petite cutie Addison Timlin plays the heros girlfriend and her beauty is well highlighted (no nudity or sleaze).

THE FILM RUNS 97 minutes and was in shot in New Mexico (Santa Fe, Albuquerque & Pecos).

GRADE: B",1509753600,,1350,4.852173913043479
6164253,3,B00HHYF59S,"Cheese, horrible over-acting by the lead, whose appearance changes from scene to scene, without cause.  Suspending belief is really stretched by low budget tech and production, even more when sharp women display unwarranted attraction for a guy that would never get a second look by any woman.  The supporting actress is beautiful, even if she strained to carry the load.  It should be offensive to women, suggesting they have lowered their standards so much, but then I look around and start to understand.  When did fat, bald, and sloppy become the new baseline?  In summary, this overplayed premise is tired, let it die.",1508889600,,623,5.009708737864078

6164264,5,B00HHYF59S,"Full disclosure: My girlfriend is an avid reader of fiction, I am not. I'm an avid reader of non-fiction. She spotted this one and was familiar with the Dean Koontz books. I'm familiar with the name ""Dean Koontz."" So I didn't walk into this one with any preconceived notions of it being ""faithful"" to the book, or ""better than"" or ""worse than"" the book. I just sat down to watch the movie.

One of my favorite films of all time is the Christopher Walken / Al Pacino / Alan Arkin masterpiece ""Stand Up Guys,"" which featured Addison Timlin in the pivotal supporting role of Alex the waitress, so that gave the film an instant ""hook"" for me.

Also, I'm a Willem DeFoe fan (watch ""White Sands,"" folks). So coming out of the gates, two actors already have my attention.

I thought Anton Yelchin in the title role was likable. If they had cast someone like Ashton Kutcher, I'm confident that I'd have been wishing for one of the evil creatures to eat him about 15 minutes in. He plays the role along the lines of Toby Maguire in the Spider-Man films...equally goofy and heroic, never sacrificing one quality for the other.

The movie is deliberately odd, in a sort of ""Twin Peaks Lite"" way. Some may find the unrelenting lovebird banter between Yelchin and Timlin to be a bit cloying after a while, but this isn't a movie for cynics to begin with.

And the ending...well, that's another love it or hate it proposition as well.

I gave the movie five stars based on what I like, not my anticipated assessment of what the mainstream might like. The special effects are computer generated...there is not a single second in which they will seem ""real"" to you. It's a little fairy tale, it's a little love story, it's a little slice of eccentric fun.

Likable performers, a Koontz-based story (if that matters to you), and a film that is light years ahead of most of the films you'll find on the streaming services. If my idea of fun sounds like fun to you, you'll enjoy it. If it doesn't, you'll love it or hate it for multiple reasons. I'd leave it where it is, though...even though there are apparently other Odd Thomas books, I wouldn't want this to become another Harry Potter franchise. One was enough.",1501200000,,2197,4.546835443037975
6164265,4,B00HHYF59S,"Weird story theme, but I like it.  Wish they'd come out with more movies.  Not sure why my Amazon Prime didn't cover it and I had to purchase it to watch.  It's not that new of a film.  C'mon Amazon.",1501113600,,199,3.9
6164266,4,B00HHYF59S,"I have just finished the book, so it's exciting to watch the transition to film.  If you haven't read the book, you may not get this movie, because it is rather Odd...",1500595200,,167,4.21875
6164267,3,B00HHYF59S,"Might have worked as a pilot for a series, as a stand alone movie, it is just a bit much. Not terrible at all, mind you. It just assumes a sense of affection for the series (the movie version of it anyways)  that this movie has not earned from its audience, not yet anyway. As another critic wrote, the thin script, despite established actors, is pretty much telling us how to feel, and the movie is so dense with its quirky characters and town that there is just no room for it to grow. In fact exposition is sacrificed for dense, snappy over rehearsed little quips, from characters we don't really yet know or care about, making the plot fall flat.  I have never read the books and have never seen a good film that is an adaptation of Koontz. Having since heard something about Odd Thomas, the book series sounds so much more interesting than this movie, and will hopefully some day get a screen version that does it justice.",1500076800,,927,4.415204678362573

I've never read the books but couldn't imagine anyone else playing this character but Anton Yelchin. He was committed and real. A natural. I loved that even though he was an oddball he still had a sense of family with his coworker, his girlfriend and Willem Dafoe's character. I also found myself tearing up at times, particularly at the end thinking of Anton's death. A talent gone too soon. Watching him touched my own feelings of grief and Ioss.

I just couldn't get past Dean Koontz using the phrase, ""Not so much"" (14.47 in). I am guessing he may feel a character such as Odd Thomas would say that but it just wasn't in the author's usual banter. I count on him for being different and standing out. Only other negative for me is I found the music to be a distraction. I kept having to lower my speakers.

You will also find this action packed, tense filled and completely riveting to watch. I bought this for my partner who has listened on audio books to all novels in the Odd Thomas series and she enjoyed everyone of them. I didn't even know a movie version of the first book had been made when I found the DVD on Amazon.

We both found the movie to be very good. Very well written, directed and acted it grabs your attention and takes you on a wild ride. The story is a little bit horror,little bit action, little bit suspense and a whole lot of fun to watch. The plot will keep you on the edge of your seat and make you jump a few times in the process. Anton Yelchin plays Odd in the movie and does an outstanding job playing the part. Some may remember he played Checkov in the recent Star Trek movies. Unfortunately he passed away earlier this year in a tragic  accident. It was sad to hear of his passing. He had an outstanding future ahead as an actor based on what he had already done. I don't know if there were any plans to do some of the other Odd Thomas books into movies with Anton in the lead.

6164371,4,B00HHYF59S,"I've never read the Odd Thomas books - in fact I didn't know there was such a thing when I first watched this film on Netflix. I watched it because it stars one of my favorite young actors: Anton Yelchin. Since I first watched it several years ago, I have re-watched it several times. Now let's get this straight, I'm not a teenager (far from it) and while i understand this film is targeted to the Young Adult audience, it certainly has humor that satisfies an adult.

For the life of me, I don't know why this movie didn't get wide release (Update: Apparently, it didn't get wide release because the distribution company, which was also responsible for advertising went into bankruptcy, thus ending this fun and emotional film's chance of a good reception).

No doubt about it, this is an ""odd"" film. The dialogue is intentionally hoaky and overly and intentionally narrative. As I understand it plays similar to the book, in that the protagonist, Odd Thomas (that's his real name) narrates the story and is told from his perspective (in both book and film).

In my opinion, the director, Stephen Sommers, is a hack, screwing up good films with too much cheesy CGI (The Mummy, Van Helsing, etc). While this film has lots of CGI, it isn't hoaky or cheesy - it actually works.

However, the reason this film is really good is because of the lead, Anton Yelchin (sadly as I write this, he was killed in a freak accident one week ago). I've long thought Yelchin was going to be BIG and I do mean BIG, because he's a gifted actor with a face full of expression and a strong screen presence. While he may be known for playing Chekov in the new Star Trek franchise, I got to know him watching Charlie Bartlett and the remake of Fright Night and Odd Thomas. We have just lost a lot of acting potential with the death of this 27 year old young man.

Odd Thomas and his girlfriend have a unique and wonderful chemistry that results from the two actors connecting so well. Additionally Willam Dafoe delivers a great performance as the chief of police. Not since Boondock Saints has he been this obtuse and fun.

The story is about Odd, who has psychic powers and can see dead people ""but he damn well does something about it"". He is essentially a detective, though he is nothing more than a fry cook.

He is trying to prevent a mass killing, but doesn't have all the pieces to solve it. We follow him as he puts the pieces together.

it's a fun ride and I'm glad I got to go on it.  Try it out. I think you'll find it fun and whacky, just the way the author Dean Koontz intended.",1466726400,,2570,4.416490486257928

The story is different than either of the movies I mention, but Odd Thomas easily fits in that same universe, both as a story and as how the movie plays out.  It's not too scary for older kids in my opinion, but is violent at times.  However, it also has a sense of humor and is light hearted with a romantic element here and there, but by no means the focus of the movie.  This is a great movie to watch on a rainy day or can't find a show to watch on TV.  It's not overly long and moves along pretty well, with only a couple slow parts.

6164405,4,B00HHYF59S,"""Odd Thomas"", the first and by far the best of Koontz's Odd Thomas series of books, would seem almost impossible to translate to the big screen, so kudos for doing a fine job. It's too bad that Odd's closest relationships (which is what made the book so special) are glossed over with the exception of his love interest, Stormy, and father-figure police chief (although I would have preferred Willem Dafoe to have played this a bit more affectionately). Odd's friend Ozzie is just there to supply a brief but essential plot point and was played more like Vanilla Ice after a year of gorging on fast food, rather than as Odd's mentor. The bodachs have too much self awareness and Odd's mom is totally misrepresented. The screenwriter also messed up on Odd being able to touch Stormy at the movie's end (you'll understand after seeing--or reading--the tale). I'm glad they jettisoned Elvis.

I know this all sounds negative, but it's so hard to translate the complex multiple facets of a novel down to two hours of screen time. So much is included, that I wonder if viewers unfamiliar with the book will be able to follow it. While I might have done some things differently, I don't think most filmmakers could have done as good a job. Oh...and the special effects are awesome!",1461024000,2,1275,4.7174887892376685

6164410,5,B00HHYF59S,"This is probably the saddest love story that is also a horror film I've ever seen. Yes, as I've said already, it's a horror film with the main actor Anton Yelchin having this ability to see ghosts in his small home town. This ghosts that called  bodachs who take the people's life away.
Sooner or later his hometown will be gone because of them taking all the human life.
Anton has this lovely girlfriend who also knows his supernatural power. Addison Timlin and him tried this machine that they insert a coin and the card said they are meant to be forever lovers. From then on they are like two of a kind. Although Anton Yelchin is just a worker at a restaurant, she really loves him. There is also this local sheriff Willem Dafoe who knows what's going on in his town and helps them. So three of them fight with the ghosts to protect their hometown.
But, as I told you, the main reason why I really loved this film is not about fighting with the ghosts. It's about love between Anton Yelchin and Addison Timlin. Adison is so adorable looking and Anton is also very humble but somewhat who is easy to like. They make a perfect couple.
The story ends up with them getting rid of all the ghosts and having a lovely time together. What? Is this a Desney movie? No, it isn'.t.  Sadly not.
The happy moment he spend with his girlfriend was actually Anton's imagination. In the reality she died during the battle with the ghosts.
Now at the finale, he sees her girlfriend bacomes a thousands of butterflies and flies away to the heaven.
This is clearly reminded me of Tim Burton's animation CORPSE BRID's ending but it was ok to me.
The editing and because this was bluray, the picture image was so very sharp and beaytiful. The sound was great too,

As is quite literally the case, even for Peter Jackson, you cannot film every nook and cranny of any book it is just impossibly cos prohibitive and of course the time it would take to watch it would be prohibitive as well.  Jackson took three movies to tell the story of The Hobbit and still had to leave out a good many scenes even while adding many others.  This film is a truly well crafted version of the book giving all the important parts and including as many of the backstory bits as he could to make it understandable for those three or four people who haven't read the amazing Odd Thomas books by Koontz.  There were a lot of production delays and holdups and I had feared that they would make for a less than excellent movie but those fears were totally allayed.

Forgetting the above & not knowing anything about the books, the movie worked well. It had a good love story, an interesting gift for the hero, and some twists. Overall, more of a thriller than a supernatural movie. This was an unexpected treat as I didn't know what to expect.

6164449,3,B00HHYF59S,"I am a fan of Dean Koontz, and was looking forward to this movie for a long time.  When it finally came out, I realized almost instantly that making the book into a stand-alone film was a terrible idea.  There's just a lot of stuff--too much--that's probably impossible to capture from the narrative, like an entire town that is haunted by ghosts, most benign or just quirky.  It would take a TV series at least a whole season's worth of episodes to get even half of it, but such pacing would no doubt better serve the story.

That being said, I still don't like the script/directing choices that resulted in the wholesale removal of entire characters (like Little Ozzie) and the reducing of Stormy's character to a short-skirted cliche was disappointing, to say the least.  The complete erasure of anything like a backstory for Odd should bother any thinking viewer, even those who haven't read the book.  In fact, if you haven't read the novel the plot may be borderline nonsense, a series of non-sequitors.

Willem Dafoe is a good actor but a poor casting choice for the character of Chief Porter; there's almost nothing paternal about him. Certainly none of the other actors are getting any big break from their performances here.  And although the special effects are pretty cool, the bodachs did not look anything like what I imagined. The insistence on a giant explosion in the final act is indicative of how uninspired the whole treatment was, trying to turn Odd into an action hero when that is supposed to be the last thing he wants to be.",1453766400,,1549,4.6900369003690034

6164467,2,B00HHYF59S,"If Ghostbusters and Ferris Bueller's Day Off ever had a love child, it'd be Odd Thomas, an endearing, witty romantic dramedy-slash-supernatural-thriller about a small desert town in California beset by demonic apparitions and a satanic cabal of deranged would-be mass murderers.

Adapted from the Dean Koontz novel and directed by Hollywood middleweight Stephen Sommers (The Mummy, G.I. Joe: Retaliation), the $27 million pic stars the always-brilliant Anton Yelchin as oddball short-order cook and ghost wrangler Odd Thomas. (His mom tells him a typo in the birth certificate reduced him from Todd to Odd, while his dad insists Odd was his proper given name.)

When Odd, who narrates the story Ferris Bueller-style, isn't flipping pancakes at the diner on Main Street or nuzzling with his devoted, diminutive sexpot of a girlfriend, Stormy Llewellyn (Addison Timlin), he helps murdered souls find justice.

""I may see dead people,"" he tells the camera, ""but then, by God, I do something about it.""

Odd is svelte, almost lanky, and all thumbs, and he's more likely to be seen on a cherry-red scooter than in an Aston Martin, but the self-described ""undercover detective for dead people"" knows his martial arts, and he's an old hand at tracking down evildoers and delivering them to the town police chief, Wyatt Porter (Willem Dafoe).

Odd Thomas shifts into thriller mode when Odd notices that one of the town's creepiest dudes is always accompanied by a posse of wraithlike creatures called bodachs. See, these demonic types live off fear and pain, and show up when a violent event is about to occur.

While Odd Thomas is nicely outfitted with diverting set pieces, comic situations, and a seriously smoldering romance, it errs on the cloying. Yelchin, solid for the most part, relies on the teen cuteness that served him so well in Charlie Bartlett.

The special effects seem out of date, silly. The bodachs, especially, look like the discards from a computer animation seminar.

The biggest problem with Odd Thomas isn't the film itself, but the bad rep it has accrued. Slated for a 2011 release, it was stuck for nearly three years in a litigious limbo, finally to be released quietly, on the sly. In the meantime, cast, director, and producers alike seem to have moved on, leaving the film bereft of the PR campaign that could have helped it become at least a sleeper hit, if not a blockbuster.

It's a shame: Yelchin deserves the exposure, the chance finally to become an A-list heavyweight.",1451779200,,2498,5.0

Dean Koontz is one of my favorite writers. His early writing used to scare me so bad, that for a few years I stopped reading him. Then about ten years ago, per my ""Library Staff Picks"" I read ""Breathless"" perhaps it was me, maybe I matured, but I love the way Koontz writing had evolved. One thing I refuse to do is to get caught up in a landslide of books recommended by the hoards. When the ""Odd Thomas"" books came out, I ignored them, because the mainstream loved them. They would always be there, and after the hub-bub died down, I would possibly give them a read.

Color me flabbergasted! All readers know that the book is always better than the movie, because our imaginations can still accomplish what Hollywood cannot. When ""Odd Thomas"" was offered for the holidays for free viewing, I watched it. Rarely, if ever do I watch a movie more than once. When movies are re-watched they are considered family classics. Usually, I have a movie playing in the background while I do other things...I have watched this movie at least four times in three days.

I LOVE ODD THOMAS!

There is suspense, thrills, creepy supernatural, a few frights, romance, and lots of Odd Thomas humor that I love. I felt it was true to the book and that the main actor brought Odd to life.

Anton Yelchin give a 5 star performance as Odd as does Penny Kalisto who as Stormy Odd's sweatheart has a natural beauty that to me personifies Koontz's character Overall the direction is very good as is the pacing I feel that a bit more of suspense & foreboding could have been added to the scenes of Odd snooping around one of the suspects home. It may sound strange but what I really miss in this movie is the ghost of Elvis which for some reason was left out I feel that Koomtz is the best Horror thriller writer out there and suggest you read his books as all of the other adaptions of his books do not do him justice,1443139200,,713,4.173913043478261

It is a quality horror drama though.  It's not a show that a vidiot may like though.  Vidiots are video game players who want constant action.  A vidiot can't handle any plot or character development.  I would rather be dead than a vidiot.  Oh well.  The blu ray which I do indeed own looks great as it should , with a nice hd picture.  The acting is great in this one and they did the book proud.  The main thing is that this one left me wanting more films and that's a plus.  Will it happen?

6164613,5,B00HHYF59S,"Didn't read the book.  I just watched in on netflix and loved it.  I couldn't believe Willem Dafoe was in it.  Lead actress needs more training.  I live in Santa Fe and about two minutes in did a double take noticing that it was filmed right on the plaza!  So I fell in love with it right away.  It is a fun story that is a little predictable but in a good way.  There are some twists but if you are paying attention they are more obvious.  Some of the things that made no sense did that on purpose because later they were put together.  Again, if you are paying attention the twists are not really twists, but the story is fun to watch regardless and flows well.  I do wish there was more mentioned about the chief of police before the end, but that is okay.  Anyone who loves the movie and wants to see the outdoor locations, visit downtown Santa Fe!  Half the fun was figuring out where it was filmed.  I didn't put together that the blonde girl was the same one too, that didn't make a lot of sense to me.  It explains it later, but what is her relation, it seemed like more sooner?  Also, anytime it shows the chief of police off duty he does nothing but fool around with his wife.  Doesn't he have anything else to do?

Also, why was the bad guy slowly walking away from a bomb with two minutes left on the timer?  Especially after it took time to break the lock to get to it?  Did he watch them doing that then decide to slowly walk away then start shooting?  Did he forget about it all together after that?  It seems like he did.  It took a lot of real life time for the two minutes to pass.  Why didn't his girlfriend listen and stay home that day?  I think his earlier visions had a different gun killing everyone, but things did change, which he didn't notice at all until the end.  Why didn't they ask why the officer was surprised at the comment that the other guy destroyed a church?  Just because he wasn't nice?  What was pod supposed to mean beside the ending answer?  Police on duty?  Why didn't his friend from the diner stay home after having that dream and knowing what day it was going to happen on?  Did they live?  I guess so.  Did anyone else think the chief of police's wife was going to slap Odd at the hospital?  I thought she would blame him when the scene started.  Why didn't Odd continue picking up weapons as he went?  Everyone but him seems to have had one and he gave up all weapons right before the end.  Why didn't the mall people scream with joy when they thought the threat was gone?  They were pretty fast to act when they knew there was a threat and couldn't get out.  Was it the guy who later showed up in the garage slowly walking out that locked down the mall?  He works quickly and takes alternate routes if that is the case.  That or he walked through a hail of gunfire trusting that the people with him would have perfect aim with an automatic weapon.  Was that guy just shooting randomly?  Shooting in a line?  Who else died at the mall after three magazines?  Why didn't he reload his gun before he decided to go on a rampage?  Why was that gun so angry about wanting his gun back?  Why did he want it back?  He seems to have found better ones later on.  Did he ever get back the one he wanted?  Why did the guy need so much ice cream?  Just to use the bucket in the freezer?  Did he eat that much ice cream?  He seems to have been in okay shape for a guy eating gallons of ice cream just to store things int he bucket.  Did the guy in swat gear really get taken down by a baseball bat to the chest?  It was as if he was hit in the head.  Was this guy dead?  He must have given up after that point.  Did they plan on killing their friends who were doing the shooting at the mall?  Bombs don't discriminate.  What would be the point of shooting up a mall then blowing them up while they are shooting people?  Why not just blow it up in the first place and skip causing panic to everyone inside?  Do you really think that was the right girl for him?  Especially after the ending?  Is there going to be a sequel?  I will definitely watch it and hope there are not as many questions at the end.",1435881600,,4139,4.114178168130489

If you haven't read the Odd Thomas novels, then it's a semi cheesy movie. The books are 10x better, but that's how it always is.",1433462400,,267,4.134615384615385
6164621,3,B00HHYF59S,"Odd Thomas (Anton Yelchin) truly lives up to his name. He lives a mostly normal life working as a line cook at a diner in Pico Mundo. His girlfriend Stormy (Addison Timlin) works at a local ice cream shop, and everyone who knows the couple agrees they are meant to be together. But Odd has an unusual gift that constantly complicates his simple little life. Odd can see dead people.

The film opens with Odd seeing the walking corpse of a young woman. Rather than ignore the dead, Odd follows their lead and acts to bring justice to the people who killed them. In this case, the young woman leads Odd to the man who raped and killed her. Odd confronts the man, chases him through a stranger's house, and finally knocks him out. The police chief (Willem Dafoe) knows about Odd's gift and the two often work together to bring wrongdoers to justice, In return, the chief does everything in his power to keep Odd's gift a secret.

One day Odd has a vision that is worse than anything he has ever seen before. He sees the faceless bodies of people in bowling shirts calling out to be saved from a gunman who kills them all. When he sees a strange customer at the diner surrounded by bodachs, invisible creatures that feed on evil and the suffering of others, his worst fears are confirmed. A terrible tragedy is about to take place in Pico Mundo and Odd is the only one who knows about it. Working off his own psychic visions, he must piece together the fragments that he has seen to form a clear picture of what is going to happen. The safety of the entire town depends on it!

Directed by Stephen Sommers (The Mummy, GI Joe: Rise of the Cobra), Odd Thomas is a fairly faithful adaptation of the Dean Koontz novel on which it is based. The quirky, sometimes hodgepodge tone of the book is a great match for Sommer's aesthetic. Yelchin is the perfect choice to play Odd, and the supporting cast of characters do a nice job in bringing life to this difficult story. Like the book, the narrative can often seem disjointed leading to a lack of focus to the main plot.  The end of the book contains an emotional punch that does not translate as well to film. Some things just work better on the page. Still, Odd is a unique character, and it is fun to see him race against the clock to save the town that he loves. This film was mired in controversy as a dispute arose between some of the financers. Unfortunately, this delayed the theatrical release and severely hindered any promotional efforts. It was released on Netflix earlier this year to little fanfare. I would encourage any fan of mysteries, thrillers, supernatural fiction, and genre defying stories to check out this gem of a film.",1433289600,,2684,4.482617586912065

As a film...on its own for someone who hadn't read the book, I'm not so sure it would be as ""touching"" as it was to fans of Koontz's books.  Too much narration in a film annoys me, for one thing.--though I realize that it might have been necessary in this case, so much back-story to fill in.

It's not a great film.  It's a good story...it's Koontz, and Koontz is great, but...I would rather read the books.  I just don't think Koontz books could translate well to films (though I would kinda like somebody to try the Frankenstein series, I'm afraid that, too, might disappoint me); it is Koontz's words on the page that grab me.  I can see the visuals in my head...he makes that happen.  And I have thousands of other movies to choose from if I just want to see a movie-movie.  I suppose the film producers and actors did a good job, I liked the actors, they were fine.

LOVED THIS FILM! Its never going to be your 'Forest Gump' but this is the type of flick you pop on and enjoy. Ups, downs, smiles and gasps.

Porter and Odd are supposed to have a Father-son relationship that doesn't even come close on screen.  Odd comes off as more of an annoyance to him.  The bodachs aren't even close to what was described.  Where is Terri?  Why does Stormy call him Fungus Bob before she knows his name?  Not to mention Fungus Bob was supposed to be creepy.... not comical.  There was nothing comical about him in the book.  They've crammed so much wanna be action into it that it's distracting...  Odd's relationship with his mother is glossed over and implies she also sees the dead... which we know isn't even close to being true.  I lost count of the number of times the words psychic magnetism was said.  Since when is Stormy a flippant flirt with everyone?

All this in 30 min worth.

6164756,4,B00HHYF59S,"Ive never read the book that this movie is apparently based off of.  That being said, I did enjoy the movie, even though I doubt I will keep it and watch it a second time.  The plot was actually pretty interesting and kept me going until the end, but the end was predictable and I saw it coming a mile off, which was the main disappointment.  The premise is a local boy named Odd Thomas (who claims his mother really meant to call him Todd, but there are doubts about that) who can see the dead and is dating a local girl nicknamed Stormy who works selling ice cream at the mall.  The ghosts come to Odd and try to get him to help them, but they cant speak, so that makes things difficult.  This is a familiar plot that Ive seen variations of in other movies.  But the strange thing that makes this movie a bit creepy is the existence of these other creatures that only a few, including Odd, can seemetamorphing partially see through things that they call bodachs.  These bodachs will kill anyone who they figure out can see them and they congregate around bad people who aim to do bad things.

Some spoilers:

The plot picks up where this creepy guy comes in to buy ice cream and has these bodachs all over him.  Odd follows him around and finds a rundown house that looks like the home of a potential serial killer, but with one twista door to the home of the bodachs/demons.  He then is on a mission to try and stop this guy from doing whatever horrible thing he intends, all the while the bodachs mass more and more, letting him know that whatever it is will have a high body count.  A local friend also tells Odd about a dream where she dies, and this provides additional clues as to what is going to happen.  Odd works with the local police chief to try and head this off, but one never knows, as Odd indicates, if Fate will just loop back around and bring you to the same place anyway no matter what you do.  All roads then converge on the final confrontation where, of course, Odds girlfriend and friends are in the line of danger.

The plot was predictable, but the movie was well done enough to keep on watching.  The special effects of the bodachs was creepy-cool and the main character was an odd mix of loser and hero.  Worth watching once and I am now interested in trying out the book.",1420416000,,2300,4.287037037037037

6164773,5,B00HHYF59S,"Perhaps a half-star more than it deserves, but I'm thrilled that someone finally put a face to Odd Thomas. I've been a fan of the book series since its inception,  and director/screenwriter Stephen Sommers has presented a comprehensive version of Odd's story, as complete as it needs to be to create a scenario that is concise and literate.

I can't stand it when people compare books to their movies, and I won't do that here. I prefer to review the film achievement, and I'm pleased with the result. Anton Yelchin is a fine Odd, lovable and, well, odd, and endearing to all who know him. Willem Dafoe seems to show up a lot lately, and he handles the role of the Police Chief well.  In a supporting role, the very fine English actress, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, plays the role with a very good American accent. Patton Oswalt has high billing, but it's really a cameo.

The very important role of Stormy Llewellyn is played by newcomer Addison Timlin, which could make or break the whole story. More could have been made of her chemistry with Yelchin, but, in the end, it all works out fine.

6164807,5,B00HHYF59S,"Odd Thomas really surprised me.  I've tried a lot of indie films lately and have been really disappointed.  Every-now-and-then one pops out and makes an impression.  Odd Thomas did that for me.
  I wanted to watch a Horror, or Thriller movie for Halloween.  This show was on Netflix, and it had really high ratings, so I figured I'd give it a try.  I was not disappointing.
  First of all, this is an expensive looking indie film. I'm still a little unsure if it's completely independent or not.  It is an adaptation of a novel series by Dean Koontz.  You can find his novel series on his Amazon author's page here.
  Odd Thomas is a nervous guy who lives up to his namesake.  He got his name from a mistake on his birth certificate, but the name holds true because he can see dead people.  I know what you're thinking... Sixth sense.  No.  It's nothing like that at all.  His mother had the gift, and passed it down to him, and he uses it to solve crimes.
  The movie starts with a fairly intense chase scene, when a dead girl leads him to her killer.  He explains the murder in detail to the murderer, and the guy runs.  Odd chases him, and they have a far reaching brawl.  There are some cool effects in the fight scene that have a kind of unique feel to them.  The whole movie carries these types of effects (slow motion in strange places, sped up scenes, and cg where you wouldn't expect it) throughout the show.
  A strange man appears in Odd's little town, and these demon-like creatures that only Odd can see are hanging out all around this guy.  These demon creatures feed on suffering and pain, so Odd knows that something bad is about to go down.
  He works with the chief of police, and his girlfriend, to find out what, why, where, and when it will all happen.  There are a lot of twists, and the end might make you a bit misty-eyed, but there's really nothing scary about the movie.  It's more of a suspense/thriller.
  There are a few profanities in the show, but nothing major.  There is one scene with a girl in her underwear, but for the most part, there's nothing sexual about the movie.  It has a rating of NR, but if it did have a rating, it would be a mild PG-13.
  Anton Yelchin, best known for playing Chekov in Star Trek (2009), was amazing.  His character was so believable that he kind of carried the movie.  I was actually surprised to hear him speak without a heavy Russian accent.  He made Odd a lovable character, and brought you in to his plight from the very first scene.
  Addison Timlin played Odd's girlfriend, Stormy Llewellyn.  Her character was not as believable, and, quite frankly, was a bit cheesy.  She was too supportive of Odd.  I know that that my sound a bit pessimistic, but it was really bad.  Sure, I think every guy would love a woman that devoted to him, but it really came off as almost patronizing.
  William Dafoe played the chief of police.  His role kind of confused me.  I only watched the movie one time, and we were interrupted several times by trick-or-treaters, but I was unsure if he was Odd's dad, or just his mentor.  He was good, as always, and gave a performance that we have come to expect from him.",1416787200,,3167,4.374137931034483

6164812,5,B00HHYF59S,"This was a really fun supernatural suspense thriller with great performances by Anton Yelchin and William Defoe.

While we all expect William Dafoe to be awesome, I wouldn't have thought Anton Yelchin could carry an entire movie this well.  Sure, he was great in Alpha Dog and Star Trek, but here he really stands out with Odd's weird combination of quirkiness and courage.  I think this could have elevated his career a lot if it had come out in theaters (as was originally intended) but a quick google search and it like some sort of distribution/contract dispute essentially killed the movie.

I get how some people thought Anton and Amber Timlin's character's relationship was insipidly sweet, but I'm a corny romantic and I kinda dug it.  Plus it raises the stakes and makes you care about what happens to them when the action heats up.

It wouldn't win any awards, but it keeps you on the edge of your seat.  You care about the characters as Odd tries to piece together the town's impending doom that only he can see the clues to.  And you get the fun exploration of both Odd's world and gifts, and also how people in town relate to him and what he knows.

A lot of it is predictable, but there are a few good curve balls also.  If you liked Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV show, not that ultra-cheesy movie) you'll probably dig the kind of action/suspense/comedy/drama going on here.",1416528000,,1387,4.6016260162601625

6164822,4,B00HHYF59S,"Based on the novel by award winning writer, Dean Koontz, comes the wildly successful Odd Thomas. This story was so popular, that it's become an entire series, one that Koontz has worked on almost exclusively since it's release. This unique story focuses on a unique man, with a unique name. Odd (Anton Yelchin) is a short order cook in a small California town, where he lives a relatively normal life with his girlfriend, Stormy. Odd is no different than any other twenty-something in town,  except for the fact that he sees the dead, specifically people who died prematurely and under suspicious circumstances. They can't talk to him, but the spirits lead Odd to the evidence he needs to find the truth. When a strange man comes to town, the spirits lead Odd to be suspicious, and with good cause. Anton Yelchin stars and once again shows off his loveable charisma. There is something about him that makes Yelchin the guy that everyone wants to be friends with, an ability that comes across in every character he plays. Odd is no different, as he is this complete weirdo, but with an innocent quality, that just makes people want to like him. Here he's more than just a lovable goofball, but he's also an unofficial detective and hero, that people turn to in there time of need. Everyone knows he's weird, but few know his secret, one of those being the Chief of Police, played by the legendary Willem Dafoe. Dafoe usually portrays the bad guy, and it was interesting to see him take on a different challenge. Odd Thomas is smart and extremely well written, with a terrific cast, that really brings the story alive with their own unique style. The story may seem like it's a little out there, but it's not just science fiction, it's a story that crosses many genres and has something for everyone, an easy choice for our list of must see movies!",1415577600,,1846,4.6452599388379205

What makes this so watchable isn't that element of it, which although good, is nothing to different to the thousands of similar plots out there.  It's the fun banter between the main character Odd and his girlfriend Stormy that pushes the movie along and keeps you amused. In fact you can't help but feel envious that you'd love to be a relationship like that. Although I'd never heard of either of these two actors, both Addison Timlinn (Stormy) and Anton Yelchin (Odd) do a brilliant job.  The ending was very predictable though, I think maybe it was supposed to be a powerful twist finish but you knew with the prior events what had happened before you went on the later journey.

6164832,3,B00HHYF59S,"I is hard to tell whether this film was intended to be a TV series pilot or not. The voice-over describer seems to be setting that TV series stage throughout the film.

The screenplay writer lifts the premise of seeing ghosts directly from The Sixth Sense and the TV series The Ghost Whisperer and then tries to make the premise its own with the character Odd Thomas but, in my opinion, misses the mark entirely. Moreover, placing Willem Defoe in the role of the bumbling/lovable cop is a miscue by the casting people.

So, storyline is tepid because it has been done over and over again. Directing is adequate but the heavy use of voiceover detracts from any real acting. The production values are OK but not stellar and so cannot hold up the movie to any great extent.

Overall, a mildly entertaining film that is not sure what it is supposed to be in the end.",1414540800,,862,4.477707006369426

I guess if you had not read the books, this film might make you want to.  My mother had to ask me if Odd Thomas really has that kind of sense of humor in the books, and I had to concede that he does.  Most of the things that make the Odd Thomas novels great are there to be found in the movie.

Of the six of us, two read the book and 4 did not.  Unanimously, whether you've read the book or not, it rated a solid four across the board for differing reasons.  Why share this?  Well, essentially whether you've read the book or not, you're in for a special treat.  The movie stays very true to the book which is a wonderful thing since I gave the book a five star rating.  The special effects were surprisingly good and with such a good story to tell, Hollywood didn't flub it up.

The stories of Odd Thomas have always been dark, with lots of quirk, humor, sadness, tension, action, and interesting characters.  That being said, I enjoyed who was cast as Odd, but I have to say, the only transformation that disrupted my enjoyment was the portrayal of Stormy.  Is it me, or did she seem a little slutty?  She's such a focal point of sun and smiles in the story but not in a midriff baring, sultry sort of way. Don't get me wrong, if you see the reviews I write, they're mostly about smutty romance novels, so I'm not a prude.  I just didn't appreciate the transformation of such an innocent and beautiful character.

My dad and I were both impressed with how they created the Bodachs (the shadowy spirit creatures from the underworld). They looked very much like I had imagined them!

The down side is that this movie was not released in theaters due to a lawsuit. I'm concerned it won't gross enough to warrant a sequel. I would really really like them to produce the next few books in the series.

Odd Thomas, his mom says it was a mix up at the hospital, he should have been Todd but this movie takes seeing dead people a little further and does it wonderfully.

The cast is great, and Addison Timlin makes a beautiful Stormy.  I did not like the fact that the movie sexualized Odd and Stormy's relationship.  They were chaste in the book, and that added dimension to their characters. But I guess Hollywood can't imagine young couples not having sex.  The bodachs didn't quite work for me either.

the movie struggles with tone.  Dafoe is wasted, he could have added a whole level of creepiness and instead just phones it in.  For his 5 minutes of screen time he gets way too high a billing.  It's stunt casting, the movie is featured around stormy and odd.

the odd/stormy couple are way too saccharine for a murder/horror thriller.  So the tone struggles to much to keep me engaged.  And there are the usual plot holes.

You seem to be coasting along fine with mystery and drama and fantasy and whatever and then BAM!, there's a crash and burn reality that (for me) destroys the natural ambiance of the story itself.

I won't give away any plot points, but the movie keeps your attention throughout its run time.

For a book-based movie, this seems to have broken the big Hollywood rule: it's nearly faithful in its entirety to the book, though there are a few things I was a little disappointed in (one of my favorite bit-minor characters, Rosalina, doesn't get the role she had in the film, but is referenced to twice in a row, etc.), but for intents and purposes, this isn't just a well-made movie, it's an incredibly well-executed movie with thought-out characterization, complimentary special effects (from the great director of The Mummy and G.I. Joe), increasingly excellent (and, at times, subtle) scene transitions, and Odd's trademark snippiness and one-liners, yet forthright (most of the time) honesty. Even the ensemble cast was done with great precision and believability. The first promo for this film indicated that it would be a trilogy, so I hope the second one will be equal to or even better than this (it's also the only movie with such a heartfelt romantic subplot that got me crying unashamedly, though I knew what would happen due to the book).",1405987200,,1250,4.845794392523365

Some aspects of the story have been condensed and some characters removed or blended with other, but that is the price you pay of doing a movie and doing it in X amount of time. I would love to have seen some more Ozzy, but what can you do.

The chemistry between Yelchin and Timlin is perfect, and they capture the characters and there relationship so well. Now when I read the books this is who I picture. Dafoe is great as always.

If you are a fan of the books I would recommend it. And if you have never even heard of the books I would say watch this, then read them.

6164995,2,B00HHYF59S,"I'm sure the books are good, I'm positive they're better than the movie anyway. My recent review on Jack Ryan can be copied and pasted in here for this movie. Completely substance-less. Flat story and the only memorable elements to any of the characters is an underwear scene. As in Jack Ryan nothing made sense. Skinny kid that gets rate 10 women dying to seduce him, all while having superhero abilities that go far beyond just seeing dead people, from genius investigating abilities that are never wrong, to catwoman like reflexes even against men much larger than he, which is most men. As in Jack Ryan (the end of the movie was almost a carbon copy to JR) it's like it has pieces or the elements you'd see in better movies, but the pieces are plain white and none of them seem to fit together.

Perhaps the books do a much better job of explaining things (naturally), but that doesn't excuse a lame movie.

Another waste of 2 hours. Looking at the other reviews I swear people are very easily entertained anymore. A brown paper bag puppet show I'm sure would get a raving 5 stars.",1405296000,,1085,4.530612244897959

It's a real shame, because Anton Yelchin is excellent. And wow, Willem Dafoe seemed to be reading off cue cards. No heat there at all. While the girlfriend character Stormy is smartly played by Addison Timlin, the script just wasn't there. The special effects were pretty cool.

I find there's not a lot more insulting than a script that keeps telling the audience how to feel. This one was just kinda bad. Glad I just rented it.",1405036800,3,714,4.622047244094488

6165012,5,B00HHYF59S,"This will be, I think, an enjoyable film even for people who have not read the seven Odd Thomas novels or who know nothing about magical realism. The main character, Odd Thomas, is a young man that people will like.

I read most of Dean Koontzs books and all seven of his Odd Thomas books as well as his Odd Thomas graphic novels and enjoyed them all. I thought that the film would be disappointing even as the Edgar R. Burroughs film Princess of Mars, which I saw earlier this week, was a disappointment. It was not similar to the book and not enjoyable. It depicted both the main character and Mars very unlike what the famed writer Burroughs created. I thought the film was below a grade B film. But this did not happen with Odd Thomas. The film caught the spirit of Koontzs creation and was true to its plot. Even the actors reflected the books character and although Koontz did not write the script the language was his.

Dean Koontz is a best-selling author of over sixty novels. He frequently writes tales with magical realism, as he does with Odd Thomas. This genre was used with perfection by many other writers, especially South Americans, and also by Nobel Prize Winners Shmuel Yosef Agnon (1888-1970, winner in 1966) and Gabriel Garcia Marques (1927-2014, winner in 1982).

Magical realism combines facts with fantasy. An example from one of Agnons stories is a man who was left behind accidently by his companions who were sailing on a ship; they saw him floating on a carpet on the ships side, not missing the trip and reaching their destination. Another example is seeing a man crossing a bridge; he begins by walking across, but soon he is seen elevated above the ground and floating to the bridges end. These fantastic descriptions add a dimension to the tale and can cause readers to think how they want to interpret the account. The events can be taken literally, symbolically, allegorically, the mind-set of the individual, or even as reality viewed from a different perspective for various reasons.

Koontz uses it in his novels in two different ways. In some, the magic realism only occurs rarely, during certain episodes, although the fantastic element is important to the development of the plot and the meaning of the story. In others, as in the seven Odd Thomas novels, the fantastic occurs frequently, for the main character, Odd Thomas, has the ability to see dead people, sees them often, and is alerted by them to the many interesting events that occur in the tale.",1404777600,,2495,4.715596330275229

Having read the novels, I was curious as to how the story would translate to the screen. Anton Yelchin (whose name sounds as if he should play a Slavic spy instead of this young adult role) is perfect as Odd. In appearance, he's a normal young man, fairly nerdish perhaps than how one would consider looking like a psychic but he's both. Odd sees dead people and proceeds to discover who killed them and bring the killers to justice. In fact the only thing blatantly odd about him is his devotion to his girlfriend Stormy whom he has loved ""forever.""  He lives in the little California town of Pico Mundo (which unfortunately in the end-shots looks suspiciously like the Southwest where it was actually filmed) by himself since his father is off chasing dreams and his mother resides in a mental institution because she apparently couldn't handle her own visions.  The local police chief is aware of Odd's visions and somehow manages to keep quiet his involvement in all the incidents.

We are introduced to Odd as he's diverted from going to his job a a fry cook by the ghost of a recently killed girl who leads him to her murderer. Thus first off, we're shown how dedicated Odd is to getting justice for the dead, as well as the dangers to him because of the bodachs, huge insect-like creatures attracted to evil. They aren't aware Odd can see them and will kill him if they learn. Since they're hovering in swarms around a specific person, Odd tries to determine exactly what the man is up to...and thereby hangs this tale.

As far as I'm concerned, Yelchin is perfect in the role, as are all other cast members.  There are little changes here and there in plot and characters, but when has a novel ever come to the screen perfectly intact? It's a fairly leisurely film but don't take that to mean it drags; it simply takes its time, setting up everything before getting into action. Quirky in spots, blackly humorous in others, the romance between Odd and Stormy who knows of his ""gift"" and understands him better than any other, is a lovely little gem in the midst of his turmoil, keeping Odd grounded and well-adjusted to his life.  The action takes place in the last 20 minutes of the film and when it gets started though it isn't very bloody, it's definitely violent...in Odd's own way.

I enjoyed it. I recommend it. I hope they make another.",1403395200,,2454,4.54875283446712

6165071,4,B00HHYF59S,"This is a rare genre treat that does many things nicely: horror, comedy, action, mystery, suspense, even romance. Following the eponymous hero's adventures with the invisible undead, it's fairly reminiscent to ""The Frighteners,"" another quirky cult film which defies traditional categorization.

One of the bigger drawbacks is the constant smart-alecky quips from the characters, which are not quite as fun and lithe as the movie would like you to believe. Even in moments of great tension, the characters will still spout a corny zinger which detracts from the danger. This also makes the experience feel more like a staged movie than a natural reality. The protagonist's girlfriend is especially guilty of these weak one-liners, where her lax performance does not help in their delivery.

But solid work by the main actor and the always-awesome Willem Defoe carry the acting otherwise. The entire film moves constantly with zippy editing and camerawork, all adding to the zany fun. A truly great trick ending capped things off nicely too.",1403136000,,1040,5.259036144578313

I'd seen the books in the grocery store book section, but that was about all I knew about them. That, and it seemed to have the same premise a bunch of other Ghost medium TV shows, so I passed over it.

Well, the movie is on Amazon, and it looked interesting, AND it starred the actor who plays Chekov in the nuStar Trek series. And, he's pretty good! This is near Frightener level, only with more expensive effects, and an equally goofy story-line. Odd Thomas' character was actually refreshing, and those invisible disaster loving creatures he sees were really creepy, too. It was also nice to see Willem Dafoe in a straight up good guy role.

The characters are likeable, but that may be because I enjoyed the story line from reading.  I thought the sheriff was a bit over done by Dafoe when he was barking out orders and too much of the story about the goblins (I forgot what they are called).  Missing was Odd's ghost dog and nothing about developing his relationship to Elvis.  You just see a cardboard standup of him.

The film seemed to drag a bit in the middle, I only point it out because the beginning and the end of there film had such a quick pace that when it slowed down in the middle the story seemed to stall too.

This is especially hard with a cast of mostly unknown actors and actresses, and a setting out in the middle of nowhere.  Yet this box office flop is quite a good movie, and for Anton Yelchin, provided a great leading role to follow-up on his supporting roles in two Star Trek blockbusters.  Coming out in early 2014 to little fanfare, this film tries to ride the coattails of the numerous superhero franchises by portraying a simple man who works as a short order cook, while occasionally using his ability to see dead people to help solve crimes.  The titular character, Odd Thomas, narrates the film as it progresses, occasionally breaking the fourth wall by telling us, the audience, about his skills, how they complicate his life, and how he uses them.  Over the course of the film, he uses his ability to see spirits to prevent a horrendous crime, but at great personal cost, which defines the tragedy of the plot.  The romance in the movie is between Odd Thomas and his girlfriend, a waitress at a mall ice cream shop; a romance whose ending is the ultimate expression of Odd's powers.

It did not, however, detract from the fun ride ""odd Thomas"" provided.

As I have stated in other reviews, I do not give a recommendation because there are too many variations of tastes out there, but the five star rating from a guy who usually avoids mysteries (A.C. an exception) and horror movies should say volumes.

6165125,4,B00HHYF59S,"Odd Thomas is a somewhat odd film yet one I found to be quite original and entertaining. Odd is able to see the dead but this is no remake of `The Sixth Sense' he also sees things called `bodachs' which are sort of see through monster things that feed on death and mayhem. When a bewigged stranger turns up in town he knows that back water Pico Mundo is in for a pretty bad time.

He wastes no time in engaging the local Police Chief (Wilem Dafoe) who always takes him seriously for his part time crime busting skills. He then has to do what is described as an `epic battle' of good vs evil. This is based on a novel by Dean Koontz - so you know it is going to be paranormal and have a few frights along the way.

I actually really liked this the CGI is all excellent and the cast are all up to muster Anton Yelchin plays Odd in a believable way given the circumstances and his girlfriend played by Addison Timlin provides ample support as `Stormy Llewellyn' - great name that. This was a lot better than I had expected and much of that might be down to director Steven Sommers who brought us `The Mummy' series.

I felt the plot, direction, and flow of the movie were fine.  There are a few plots/conflicts that you can see coming but I still had fun getting there.  The only con really is that the twists and turns of the movie happen without little setup or foreshadowing.  I'm sure in the book the author had time to set everything up but in a movie, with time constraints it's hard to do proper set up justice.  In any event, I was satisfied with the movie, enjoyed it, and will probably read the books so I can continue to follow his journey...",1400976000,,842,4.225

6165139,4,B00HHYF59S,"Seeing Dean Koontz's books ransacked by clueless filmmakers, I began watching on Netflix with fear and trepidation. The first 10 minutes I felt a little out of balance - I ""Oddly"" wasn't comfortable with the look and feel. But as the film ran on, it began to break in like a good pair of leather shoes, I suddenly didn't notice the discomfort I had in the beginning. By the end, I was inspired and felt like it was one of the best adaptations of any novel to film I had seen - ever. Unfortunately, there were some special effects that were so bad that it was a little distracting (maybe not finished? More on that later), but regardless of the why, I had to dock it a star for some bad CGI.

But don't let that stop you. If you haven't read an Odd Thomas novel (and there are many - go buy them right now), it might take awhile to get used to the cute and quirky dialogue that is the staple of an Odd Thomas story. But don't judge, just hang on and you will be rewarded as you get into the rhythm of the film. It may be the most fun you'll have watching a movie this year.

Those of us who have journeyed with Koontz through his writing career have expected terrible things to happen with his stories. I personally thought Phantoms was a very good film, but others disagree. At least it wasn't savaged like his other adaptations. So, with the the perfect director at the helm of Odd Thomas, filming going well, and Dean thrilled with the results, disaster hit with some ""Hollywood"" financial shenanigans causing the theatrical release to be cancelled and the film sent to direct-to-DVD sales hell. I would assume that they planned to use some of that theatrical advance to finish and perfect some of the effects. But have no fear, the story trumps some occasional bad CGI, so although not as many will see it and I missed the experience of laughing and crying with a theater audience, it's still a great film and well worth your money and time.",1400803200,,1944,4.382271468144045
6165140,4,B00HHYF59S,"As others have said, I've been reading Dean Koontz for more than 25 years.  Watchers was the first and is still my favorite.  On the other hand, many of the movies that have been made from DK's novels are total crap, or at their best, just not too bad.  Phantoms wasn't bad (the movie) and Hideaway was ok.

But in this, Anton Yelchin is perfect for Odd Thomas.  Stormy was really believable as the sweet, but tough, Stormy.  The production values are very high, compared to the silliness of all three Watchers movies.  Maybe someone could REMAKE Watchers with characters actually much like the novel!!! What a concept!  :)

In fact, this movie was good enough to make me start reading all of the Odd Thomas series!  And THAT'S high praise.

It had a super cast with an intriguing story line and an ending that you didn't really see coming. Nice. The primary female actor who played Stormy -- Addison Timlin -- was the only downside to this movie. I really abhor women who try too hard to act sexy. It ruins a perfectly good character. A woman who has to act sexy, isn't, and only comes off looking ridiculous. Her best part was at the end. Still, the remaining characters made up for that one bad one.

The actor who plays Odd is really likable and makes up for the ""meh"" performance of the actress who played Stormy.  This movie might be more enjoyable for someone who hasn't read the book, and could inspire them to read it afterward to see what they missed.  I'd recommend reading the book first, though, and go into the movie with somewhat low expectations.  It not nearly as bad as some reviews make it out to be, but not as good as it could have been.

Though I'm familiar with Dean Koontz' work I have never read the Odd Thomas series so when I saw this come up on Netflix I was entering it as a pure, Odd Thomas virgin.

What I saw was a mixed bag. I felt there was a great premise here and who doesn't like a nice, predictable story about seeing ghosts and trying to help those ghosts solve problems? Quite original in that aspect. Don't think I've ever seen anything quite like it barring The Sixth Sense, The Ghost Whisperer, Hulu's new series Deadbeat, Dead Like Me... er... yeah.

Here are the things that stuck in my craw (I'm very hip with the new lingo kids use these days).

There's only so many times I can hear character say, ""Nothing about you is normal, Odd!"" I'm paraphrasing of course but these responses to various situations throughout the movie were peppered throughout and I wanted to drill a hole in the back of my head and pull my eyeballs out. I'm being melodramatic of course. And figurative just in case anyone's confused.

The ""I love yous"" between Stormy and Odd plus their ""witty"" banter (barf) was enough to make a full prediction that she would bite it at the end. The interaction between these two were so sickeningly sweet that I got the diabetus. I recovered soon after but it was a heck of a ride.

It was never clear (to me at least) what the relationship between Willem Dafoe's character and Odd. Was it just a professional relationship or was he Odd's father?

All throughout the movie (and yes I know they tried to backtrack and do a Sixth Sense review) it was never alluded to that there were 4 conspirators. It seemed like they popped up for convenience and to ""shock"" the viewer when all it really did was annoy. I face palmed about that for a long time.

And I guess finally is the overabundance of exposition. It seems like they really crammed a lot into the movie and to save on time we get lengthy voice overs trying to explain the rules of the universe Odd lives in.

In conclusion this is a pretty film with some nice visuals even though it wasn't exactly an adventurous style. The story was lacking, the acting subpar, but I will say the final ending of the movie was nicely done and emotional to boot.",1399939200,6,2228,4.467980295566503
6165181,5,B00HHYF59S,I had read several of the novels in the series yet the movie still had a few surprises. It was very well acted and they kept the storyline true.,1399939200,,144,4.0

I grabbed it up and headed home to watch it.  Odd Thomas was just plain fun and it was perfect to share with my 13 year old daughter.  The move doesn't take itself too seriously.  I think I realy liked it because it wasn't as dark as shows such as Supernatural.  The acting is not the best but I get the feeling Willem DaFoe was really having fun being so campy. I must say Odd Thomas is protrayed in about the same way as I did in my mind. This is definitely not Academy Award material but well worth a $10 price tag and 1.5 hours of mindless movie watching on a Saturday afternoon.  [Just a side note, I originally only gave it 4 stars but since we ended up watching it two more times in one week and my college daughter and her friends loved it, I am changing my vote to 5 stars.]",1399852800,,957,3.9274611398963732

We book readers expect so much from our books-turned-movies. We get so invested in the characters and the emotions we are able to draw from them. Often, because of this, we can be difficult to please. But this movie had as many of the good points as I personally needed to relive my Odd Thomas reading in a comparatively timely manner! I enjoyed it as well as I enjoyed reading the book....and as well as I enjoy listening to the audio book!

Having read much of dean koontz' work (am an English teacher) the director even translated his literary style well on screen: church scenes with lots of votive candles, old bungalow style homes, and good people against insurmountable evil. If you find the dialogue corny or the humor tacky, then you've never familiarized yourself with the series, some of the very same traits that made odd endearing in the first place.  I, too, think this will become a cult classic, like The Big Lebowski.  Nobody got that movie at first either, and now they have festivals celebrating it.",1399680000,,751,4.889763779527559

6165195,4,B00HHYF59S,"If you are a Dean Koontz fan you might not like the movie since about the only thing Odd Thomas has in common with his book character is that he helps the towns people. If you want to see an entertaining movie without the prejudice of the book character because you don't know him then this is the movie to see. Odd Thomas is short order cook and Odd sees things in the supernatural realm and he helps solve crime. And this is because he sees dead people. He does not avoid them, he pays attention to what they need and tries to solve the mystery of their death, which can be tricky since the 'dead don't talk' according to Odd. But he does try to bring them peace and justice. The police know him, try to work around his quirky way of helping and solve many murders because of this. But Odd also sees other worldly things and that is dangerous because some things don't want to be seen. Standing next to him is Stormy whom he has known since they were children and knew they were meant to be together forever. Stormy knows all about him and often helps him when she can even though he tries to keep her out of that part of his life. But Stormy is stubborn and she loves Odd and would never dream of letting him go into danger without her.

But something evil has come to the small desert town they live in. Something so big that even though Odd can see it coming, he dare not acknowledge it because of the consequences to him and those around him. Now he is in a race against time and a very angry ghost and hordes of demons to try to stop the evil that will change everyone's lives forever.

Like I said, it's not a bad story, it's kind of quirky and somewhat endearing. It does have some violence, can't get away from that but not gratuitous and some great special effects.",1399593600,,1776,4.220588235294118

This had the kid from the remake of Fright Night. (Which was also surprisingly good.) I think he's going to be the Nathan Fillion (sp?) of his generation.",1399593600,,306,4.350877192982456
6165198,4,B00HHYF59S,"...but I'm not sure if others will enjoy.

Dean Koontz has a very distinct style of writing, and coupling that with his character Odd Thomas, and the ""Odd Thomas"" series of books have a distinct light-hearted tone.  This movie shares that tone while also being emotionally powerful in its final moments (just like the book).  And I've spoken to a few friends that have not read the book, and they said this movie was ""cheesy and silly.""  What they didn't understand is that it was meant to feel the way it felt.  This is not your typical horror film, but it works, if you're able to distance yourself from any pre-conceived notions on what a horror film should be.  It's very true to the story and tone of the book, and this movie is a fun ride which culminates in an emotional powerful finale that will leave you breathless.",1399593600,,825,4.503355704697986

I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. Yelchin does a great job as Odd Thomas. He is never an action hero. He inhabits his strange world with honor and valor. Stormy is caring and plucky. Their relationship is believable and true to the text. I applaud the director's choice to give a nod to Elvis but not allow him to overpower the story. Many other points were dropped in to my delight! The choice of how to bring the bogats to life is really creepy and wonderful!

And I was worried about this one.  The book was wonderful and made me cry.  And as strange as it sounds... was recommended by a friend of mine who odd enough name is Todd.  And he never reads books, so to have him recommend a book to me... was odd enough!

I will also say this movie was better than I expected it would be.  It got tense, it went off the book rather well.  and it has its funny moments.  I was worried about the actor who played Odd (whose only other movie I saw was Charlie Bartnet??? ) and he's not a bad actor.  He played the part of Odd very well I thought.  From reading Dean Koontz Facebook, this was a lower budget film.  Not bad for a low budget.  And like the book, the ending made me cry.  So if you have already read the book and like me, cried... keep the tissues nearby when watching this movie!  If they do make squeals, I would like to see them as well.  If they are done like this one, won't be too bad.  The book will always be better.  But again... this movie was better than I expected.

I loved each character brought to life! But the bodachs? I was thinking, ""How are they gonna show that?!"" And it was like, ""WOW!!!"" I was surprised how they portrayed them without them looking or sounding like an.....oddball on film.

That being said, I have to say that the movie did stay true to the heart of the first book.  I though Anton Yelchin as Odd was a great choice, bringing the character that I envisioned to the screen.  Granted, I picture him more with a comb-over; thank you graphic novels.  My only gripe with the movie was the character of Stormy.  Now don't get me wrong, I liked how Stormy was depicted here, but she seemed a bit too ""dead-panned"" at times.  Otherwise, she was true to the character.

For those commenting on the fact that there was too much exposition:  You clearly haven't read or at least enjoyed the books then.  The fact that we hear Odd's thoughts throughout the adventure is half the fun of the story.  That and the fact that it adds some needed humor to many darker moments that prevail in the plot.

Overall, the was a really enjoyable movie for a fan of a really enjoyable character.  I wouldn't mind a tv mini-series based on it to continue the stories that take place after.",1399334400,,1117,4.502487562189055

It's nice that Dean Koontz and the writers saw fit to allow Odd to be comfortable with his 'gift'. Too many movies and programs have the hero at odds with his/her abilities.

6165234,5,B00HHYF59S,"Now, Ive been an avid fan of the book series by Dean Koontz since the first novel was published in 2003.  When I first heard a film was being made Odd Thomas and that Stephen Sommers was directing it, I was as excited with anticipation.  I mean Stephen Sommers was the director of The Mummy and The Mummy 2, which are movies I certainly enjoyed.  Of course, I knew the success of Odd Thomas would depend largely on what actor played the lead role and who played his soul mate, Stormy Llewellyn.  If the actors portraying these two characters got it right, then it was a natural assumption the rest the film would follow suit.

Anton Yelchin was picked for Odd Thomas and its perfect casting in my opinion.  He manages to capture the soul, the humor and the essence of Odd very quickly.  The role of his girlfriend, Stormy, was played by Addison Timlin, who surprised me with her ability to win me over.  I didn't really know of her until this film, and I swiftly came to the conclusion that she was ideal as Stormy.  This is definitely a woman any man would fall in love with.  Rounding out the main cast is Willem Dafoe as Police Chief Wyatt Porter and Patton Oswalt as Odds best friend, Ozzie Boone.

For those of you who haven't read the novel, or seen the movie, the story centers around Odd Thomas, whos a short-order cook in a small caf in the town of Pico Mundo, which is located somewhere in the desert of central California.  Odd also has psychic powers that he uses to help the local police in nabbing dangerous criminals.  When a stranger arrives in town, surrounded by dozens of spirits (bodachs) that only Odd can see, the short-order cook realizes that something terribly bad is about to happen.

Odd starts following the bizarre man around and soon discovers that his personality is totally evil.  Even worse, the guy has friends in Pico Mundo, and all of them are planning to do something catastrophic that will literally kill hundreds of people.  Odd has to figure out what the calamity will be so he can stop it.

The movie is well acted and filmed with excellent special effects.  Unfortunately for me, I had to view this movie twice in order to appreciate its higher qualities.  Many people have preferred to the film as a comedy, but I saw it as somewhat of a lighthearted story with a very serious theme.  In fact, the second time I watched it, I had no expectations and therefore, could simply enjoy it for what the movie was: a very entertaining film.  Its the best adaptation of a Dean Koontz novel Ive ever seen, and even though I knew what was going to happen at the end, I still found myself tearing up.

The regular DVD of Odd Thomas had absolutely no Special Features on it.  No commentary, no behind-the-scenes stuff, no interviews with the performers or the director, or on the making of the film.  I don't know who put the DVD out, but it looks as though they didn't want to spend any more money than necessary on getting this movie out to the general public.  This was a shame.  If ever a good movie needed the director and actors discussing what happened to the film and why it went straight to video, its this one.  An interview with Dean Koontz would also have been nice.

All in all, I have to give this movie a high recommendation.  Its one I definitely want to watch a third time.",1399161600,,3320,4.441322314049587

SPOILERS

Two of the three pretty young women in the film end up dead, and very attractively dead, to boot (think dead and running around in high heels). There's no great reason for their deaths, except to convince us the hero is Tragic and the villains are Bad.

Willem Dafoe's character's few scenes with his wife are fun. There's that. They seem to be leading a rather cute life, albeit one that's constantly interrupted.",1399075200,,722,4.901639344262295

I love the Odd Thomas series of books, so I was weary that the movie would not be able to capture the essential elements that make Odd Thomas such a likable character. I was pleasantly surprised that Odd's innocence and his good intentions to be a force for good were capture perfectly by Anton Yelchin. What I feel is the essence of the first novel is the interplay between Odd and Stormy. It is playful yet passionate. The chemistry between Anton Yelchin and Addison Timlin was perfect. Coincidentally, the casting of Addison Timlin was perfect from her looks to her attitude toward her ""Odd one.""

With that being said, the major drawback of this film was the computer generated graphics. We're all used to CG images in movies these days, but the execution in Odd Thomas left something to be desired. The first scene where this is apparent is the when Odd is flipping his lighter than air pancakes. This looks utterly out of place and a little cheesy. Moreover, the bodachs were not how I imagined them from the book. They were more shimmery than smoky.

Overall, I would recommend this movie to Odd Thomas fans, and casual observers alike. It has a solid story and great acting.",1399075200,,1250,4.6008968609865475

The Good things:

I loved the casting of the lead actor.

I loved that they were very faithful to the book

Willim Dafoe, what more do I need to say?

Things I did not love:

The casting of Stormy... dreadful. No chemistry between the two leads and it's all important. Also, um... just no. I did not like her at all, especially the way she dressed. she is just not my picture of Stormy.

I missed Elvis :(

The casting of Ozzie Boone... um.. just wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong on every level.

The Bocachs. HORRIBLE CGI and not at all as described in the books.

I didn't even know this movie had been released. Clearly there will not be a 2nd. It was like a made for TV movie. I'm guessing maybe this was meant as a pilot? Surely not for studio release.",1399075200,,823,4.1847133757961785

Now I can say that finally his initial novel in the series has been adhered to as closely as possible. Though the novel had humor, it had more chilling suspense, raised more goose-pimples than the film, but Koontz readers should be able to put aside their individual imagined imagery of characters, locales and events and thoroughly enjoy the movie.",1399075200,,539,4.625
6165246,2,B00HHYF59S,"A very slow quirky movie till the very end. It's somewhat entertaining but not very exciting. It's actually pretty predictable and generic. The highlights of the film being that the main character has the ability to communicate and interact with the dead. I grew tired of the Stormy and Odd cutesy couple after about 5 minutes and it never goes away. This is a movie is more of a supernatural,love story/mystery. As generic as this movie was it will probably get 4 or 5 stars rating from people that are easily entertained. This movie isn't worth 5 stars, it's not worth 4 stars it's worth about 3 stars at best. It's told with an interesting narrative but the story drags its feet. I just couldn't find it engaging enough to where I could sit through the whole thing without pausing it to go and do something else. I kept watching for Willem Dafoe even when a movie is boring he's interesting. The actor that plays Odd is pretty good and that's about all I got from the film. This is another love story masked as some kind of supernatural comedy horror. The movie should be called Stormy and Odd because it's mostly about their relationship as much as it's about what's happening in the town. If you could care less about their boring romance you automatically forfeit 60% of what the movies about.",1398988800,,1299,4.579399141630901

6165252,4,B00HHYF59S,"It's very hard to adapt a book to the big screen--and to do so while staying true to the book is even harder.  While it will always be a challenge to recreate a written character with an actor ( who can never look as what is conjured by a reader's imagination) this film did a terrific job, finding an actor who effortlessly capture's Odd's naivety, stoicism and sense of responsibility.  The film of necessity had to narrow down the scope of the story, but I think the love story deserved more attention that it recieved--especially given how pivotal that relationship is in Odd's long term development.  The CGI was well done--and not over done.  Some of the photography was quite striking and the story was easy to follow while progressing smoothly with well-drawn characters. You won't need to have read the book, and the changes (other than what I already mentioned) were relatively minor and necessary within the scope of a film. I hope to see many sequels!",1398902400,,963,4.714285714285714
6165253,5,B00HHYF59S,Even after reading the book the movie kept me riveted from start to finish.  This film is destined to become a cult favorite in my opinion.  Anton Yelchin was incredible as Odd.

The film, Odd Thomas, is expertly acted, and moves at a nice and easy to watch pace.  Not too much hand held jerky filming (thankfully, as I dislike that style very much).  The characters are well defined and consistent.  The ""seeing of dead people"" is done in an effective manner.  Without giving away any spoilers, I will just say the plot surprised me very much, and the ending really got to me.

There are some gruesome elements, but not to the level of a slasher movie or too much gore.

Overall, an enjoyable movie for those who like comedy mixed with action and some horror elements.",1398902400,,678,4.376
6165255,5,B00HHYF59S,"And the answer is -- NOTHING! I loved the novel and want to say that Dean Koontz has written some wonderful books, contrary to what his detractors say. And fyi, I've been around long enough to remember when Stephen King was considered a hack by his detractors before he amassed so much wealth, which commutes to power in this world of our making. And just for the record, I love Stephen King's books. He could make a best seller out of the phonebook (yes, I went there). But I digress. I waited a long time to finally see 'Odd Thomas' made into this movie and I wasn't disappointed. I've read the reviews and I concede that there might be some not - quite polished parts in it, but they didn't bother me or detract from my viewing experience. Stephen Sommers (who also gave us 'The Mummy', 'The Mummy Returns' and 'Van Helsing', to name just a few of his credits) wrote the screenplay, directed, and produced this film. I think he did a great job wearing all those hats and performing all those tasks. He's done this all before (and obviously successfully), as his movies are constantly being shown on t.v. I have to mention here that the special effects were awesome! I love Anton Yelchin (who also portrays Chekov in the 'Star Trek' movies by J.J. Abrams). He is a talented young actor with a diverse list of screen credits and is one of a handful of child actors who successfully made the transition into adult actor. If you're a fan - girl like me, check out the two part mini movie he starred in for the videos to two of the Broken Bells songs from their most recent cd 'After The Disco'(in youtube's search bar, type: Broken Bells - The Angel and the Fool). He was the perfect choice to play Odd Thomas. He embodied all of Odd's qualities and personal traits and brought the character to life for me. Addison Timlin was also the perfect choice as Stormy Llewellen. She brought her to life for me as well. I have to also mention Patton Oswalt, who portrayed Ozzie Boone. Patton is a stand up comedian, writer, actor and voice actor (he was the voice of Remy in the Disney Pixar film 'Ratatouille'). It was fun to see him as Ozzie and it made me wish AGAIN for more sequels (which, I understand we will NEVER see because of all of this movies legal woes) as there are many books in the 'Odd Thomas' series.
If you're like me, you probably know that you can't always believe all the b.s. you read or hear from critics, even if one of them is Roger Ebert. Some things have to be experienced first hand and then judged. There's a lot of crap being produced in Hollywood that gets over promoted and then favorable reviews.

This is not really a spoiler, but more of a warning for those who really empathize with characters in life or on the screen and don't want to be sad at the finale of the movie. Either way I think you will enjoy the movie, it's really well done and the characters esp Odd Thomas are very relatable and likable. The movie flows at a really close to pitch perfect rate and tone!! Now if you don't mind feeling super sad don't read any further. If you feel like you like to be surprised in a negative way or just don't care then DONT READ ANYMORE. However if you don't want to be sad then There is something you must know or at least have a small awareness of while watching this movie. OK if you are sensitive and have lots of empathy you must know to be awareThere is something really sad toward the end of the movie after the climax and right after what seems to be the epilogue when all is well.

6165266,3,B00HHYF59S,"I like some of Stephen Sommers' work. The Mummy movies and ""Deep Rising"" were genuinely decent. Then came ""Van Helsing"" and it seems to have been down hill since.

Here's the scoop. Odd Thomas (Anton Yelchin) is a young man in a small-ish California town. He has clairvoyant capabilities and a girlfriend who loves him dearly. His capabilities tell him there is going to be a mass murder in the town and he needs to put said capabilities to use to thwart the tragedy.

This reads more like a TV pilot than a movie. (Note the final scene.) The tone is not serious enough and the humor peppered throughout has been done way better in any number of movies, including the aforementioned Sommers flicks. It also lacks any visual flair. It's very plainly shot. Much of the budget seems to have been spent on the CGI of the ""bodachs"" wraith type entities that are drawn to disaster. The acting is even mid-grade TV. Yelchin has been better and even Willem Dafoe, whom I generally like, seemed to have no emotional investment in this project. And the writing. This is so full of lapses in logic it boggled my mind. The dialogue isn't much better. Dafoe must have choked on his final lines.

This isn't a painful watch but I ran it because of the overall good user reviews. Now I'm asking myself what these other folks were watching.",1398729600,,1324,4.554621848739496

I can't believe how to the letter they were, just as I imagined. Just like Odd and Stormy were. The Pico Mondo Grill owner seemed too young however, and . Ozzie never left the house and was huge....NOT AT ALL like the actor who portrayed him. But that's it, and even with that they did a Fab job. I cryed my eyes out at the end. Balled like I lost my husband. I haven't cryed like that since I read the book yrs ago!! GREAT JOB. I GIVE IT TEN STARS!!

Great casting all around. Anton Yelchin, Addison Timlin, Willem Dafoe all spot on. Especially for Dafoe who's character casts an echo back to The Boondock Saints.

The inclusion of the Elvis cutout in Odd's apartment as a nod to the Elvis character in the book was appreciated.

Bringing a well loved novel and character to the screen is a real challenge. It's like trying to translate a painting into a ballet. Some things must per force be lost in the translation. But in this case you barely notice what's missing as you are too busy appreciating what's there.

Not much was left out from the book, some of the backstory of Odd's parents, but that took nothing away from the movie and would have been a disorienting dark place to go if more had been said, and a few other small details.

That said, some movies about books can leave you horribly disappointed.  Odd Thomas does not.  It sticks very close to the book's storyline and the casting is dead-on.  It even did a far better job of showing me the bodaks than my imagination ever managed.  A truly good, fun while still serious movie.",1398124800,,448,4.6075949367088604

I think he is a great actor and I loved him in Star Trek and I loved him in this. I also love Willem Dafoe and the choice they got for Stormy. I think they had great chemistry on screen and the special effects were really good.

This picture needed something fresh, maybe a little grungy, but instead the filmmakers opted for glossy and cutesy. It bounces along like an afterschool special and by the end of the yarn you'll be wishing these terrific actors were all working for the cause of a much better film than this. To see a supernatural thriller that has spring in its step AND holds your interest, watch Keanu in CONSTANTINE. They figured out the formula. These folks didn't.",1398038400,,609,4.865384615384615

Odd is funny, and I pictured someone very young looking, although this actor has the kind of innocent face you would expect Odd to have.  My picture of him in my head was different than what I saw on screen.  But that is always the way when you read the book first.  It's very hard to recreate because in a book everyone envisions their own idea of what people look like.  I do think they were right on with Stormy, she is a perfect recreation of what I would have expected.

6165330,5,B00HHYF59S,"I have been a fan of the book series and was thrilled when I heard they were coming out with a movie.  I anguished while keeping up with the production - loss of budget, delays, lawsuits when one of the partners pulled right when distributing to the theaters.

IN SPITE of all that, they did a great job with the movie.  Sure there are elements missing that were in the book, the frequently visiting sad ghost of Elvis, but this was not a pivotal element and can you imagine what Graceland would have charged for the rights?  Besides there is a fun nod to him in the movie.

Anton did a great job portraying Odd and while Willem DeFoe in no way resembles the description of Sheriff Porter, he's a great actor and I think the chemistry between him and Anton was great.

For those who have no knowledge of the Dean Koontz books this is based on, fear not, there's enough narration throughout the movie by Odd to keep you informed without being OVERLY ""narrative"".  While it's great Koontzian suspense, there's good humor and I dare anyone to keep a dry eye during the last 10 minutes of the movie!

Take a chance and at least rent the movie on Amazon Prime (or that other online service) then come back here and buy it.

Sadly the disk has no behind the scenes or extras but as I mentioned they put this together, wrapped it up and shipped it out under continued financial duress.  Perhaps if enough folks purchase it we might see an ""Ultimate Directors Cut Extended Edition"" sometime in the future!",1397952000,,1497,4.450549450549451
6165331,4,B00HHYF59S,Odd is DK's best character and this movie stayed true to the original story minus Elvis.  Fans of paranormal movies will find this entertaining with lots of constant action and honest human interactions. OT is the hero we all want in our world. One who sees the dangers coming and acts to protect the rest of us at their own risk. Jack Bauer lite with a third eye.

The acting is wooden, Dafoe phones it in, and the premise is predictable and not at all scary.  It is not even very funny when it wants to be funny.  It is just bad.  Too bad, as the Odd Thomas stories could make for a good movie franchise, but not with this director.

The special effects weren't as bad as they could have been but I don't feel they were as good as the trailer portrayed them to be. By 30 minutes into the film, I was waiting for someone to come rip every strand of my hair out of my head: I would NOT recommend this film to anyone...ever...anywhere...ever.

Relating worthy character development, ""Odd Thomas"" also delivers a sensational blend of suspense and comedy.  Additionally, the cast is terrific, especially Anton Yelchin and Willem Dafoe, and I never imagined seeing Arnold Vosloo (The Mummy) as a character like Tom Jedd.
Engaging his audience each moment of this thrill ride, writer/director Stephen Sommers can count Odd Thomas as another success!",1397606400,,663,5.355769230769231

6165353,3,B00HHYF59S,"This movie is based on an excellent book (which became a series of books) by Dean Koontz. The initial book is dear to my heart, because the character of Odd...as written...is so endearing, quirky and heroic; we learn how he came to be such a person. Not only is Odd fleshed out, but so are the supporting characters of Stormy, Little Ozzie and Chief Porter. There has to be a back story/history to these individuals for me to 'care'. I just loved the relationship between Odd, Ozzie and Chester (the cat!) in the novel, but Ozzie is reduced to this casual character in Odd's life with all of a sixty second appearance in the film. As others have mentioned, the ghost of Elvis was a frequent companion of Odd's and added such a bittersweet aspect to the story as well.

I certainly understand the reasons a novel can cover so much more detail, as opposed to the film version, but I felt a much better job could have been done. If I hadn't read the novel, I would have probably enjoyed the film much more, but instead ended up missing seeing SO MUCH of what made the story special to me.

I do feel Anton Yelchin did an excellent job as Odd. With what he was given to work with, he still managed to bring the character to life.",1397606400,,1225,4.344978165938865

I'm happy to say I was pretty pleased (3 1/2 stars). The movie stayed very true to the book and covered most of the most memorable moments very well.
Though the actor that played Odd wasn't quite what I pictured while reading the books, he did a nice job and I'd be glad to see him in the role again if they make any sequels (And I think I'm in love with the girl who played Stormy :P ) There was plenty of action, drama  and even some humor to keep the story moving at a quick pace.

This movie was much, much, much better than I expected. I really enjoyed watching this. It is not a low budget / badly directed movie like some other books made movies I've watched. You have to see this if you ever read the book and even if you havent, watch it because it's that good.",1397174400,,450,4.172413793103448

6165387,5,B00HHYF59S,"Great movie that follow the book pretty well (as much as a movie can). I was bummed that Elvis's ghost was not part of the story, but it was a nice touch to have the full size cardboard Elvis in Odd's home.

The casting job for Odd and Stormy was perfect!

Great movie if you read (and liked) the book, which is where I am. It may be a little more difficult to follow if you are not familiar with the book.",1397174400,,406,3.9390243902439024
6165388,3,B00HHYF59S,"The movie started off strong, but by the end we almost had to turn it off due to the deplorable acting on the part of Odd's girlfriend (some unknown bit of stuff that looks like every other bit of stuff in Hollywood right now, which is to say she looks a bit like Jersey peasant stock). Anton Yelchin is such a talented young man, with so much potential. If you can ignore her (which is kind of hard because her character keeps trying to turn a phrase, unsuccessfully) you might enjoy this film. It has some funny moments, some quirky moments, and could have been great. Gone are the golden days of Hollywood when even if a woman couldn't act, at least she was stunningly unique and beautiful.",1397174400,,693,4.421875

6165390,3,B00HHYF59S,The movie left out many things that was central to the book.  Dean Koontz created Odd Thomas who is a beloved character to many.  The movie did not capture Odd Thomas's unique and magical character.,1397174400,,198,4.628571428571429

6165392,4,B00HHYF59S,"Set in a fictional small town of Pico Mundo, Odd Thomas follows the strange adventure of Odd Thomas (perfectly played by Anton Yelchin), a young man who can not only see ghosts, but tries to do something about it. He can also see bodachs, something like evil spirits that foreshadow death. And today Odd notices there are so many of them in the town. Something terrible is going to happen, but how can he stop that?

Despite several twists and turns, the storyline itself is pretty simple. The entire tone of the film is whimsical, jumping from thriller to comedy. What makes the film work is obviously the excellent performances from the stars Anton Yelchin as Odd, and Addison Timlin as his lovely girlfriend Stormy Llewellyn working in an ice cream shop. Their chemistry is genuine.

The film, based on a Dean Koontz novel, is written and directed by Stephen Sommers known for The Mummy. And like The Mummy, special effects are impressive, especially those of bodachs. Perhaps the film could have been better with more time on Odds interaction with the dead and less on the mystery part, but still Odd Thomas is an entertaining ride.",1397088000,,1136,4.761421319796955

I was ready to watch the movie but my brother handed me the book ""Odd Thomas"" first and then said after I finished it, he would let me watch the film.  I loved the book and the movie brought the quirkiness of Odd Thomas to life for me.  Yelchin is a perfect choice in playing the character and brings a real charm to the role.  I can tell the budget on the film wasn't much but it doesn't take away from the film at all.

6165403,2,B00HHYF59S,"I'm afraid that Odd Thomas doesn't live up to its potential, even with Willem Dafoe. It's a campy send up of the theme, 'I see beasties that no one else can.' Said beasties show up just before something terrible happens and loiter about to feed on people's fears when the event happens. The story unfolds predictably. I got the feeling that folks phoned in their performances.

Odd Thomas may be entertaining for younger viewers ages 12-15, but I aged 67 turned it off after about 30 minutes.",1397088000,2,492,4.655172413793103

6165407,4,B00HHYF59S,"Movie Review: Dean Koontz hasn't had much luck adapting his books. Intensity was turned into a somewhat decent mini-series but other than that for an author who has achieved so much on page, he has not done well on film. Maybe thats not really important, anyhoo, Odd Thomas was a really good Red Box Rental, the movie followed the book well and I thought the visual effects were adequate but not necessarily over the top. For those of you who don't know Odd Thomas, he's a man who can see dead people, and unfortunately has a gift for seeing disaster. I am not sure why the production company chose not to release in theaters because for a movie that was released straight to DVD it more than measures up, its creepy and romantic.

The story and the cast depicted the book' storyline very closely and I enjoyed all of it. The special effects were good and the animation of the bodachs was creepy and scary and it added to the spooky feeling you get when you watch a good scary movie. Some of the acting just seemed to be done without much enthusiasm but the actor that played Odd Thomas nailed the role.

If you are a fan of Odd Thomas and of Dean Koontz you owe it to yourself to see the film.  The movie got bad reviews from the Hollywood critics but like usual, I disagree with them.  I enjoyed  the film and so did my wife. We love a Odd Thomas and we loved the film. That is why I rated it 5 stars.

6165424,5,B00HHYF59S,"I really enjoyed this movie based on Koontz's book by the same title.  As I usually deside, the book is better than the film version.  Partially, that is because Koontz is such a great writer and his phrases and descriptions are so wonderful.  They did inclue some dialogue directly from the book.  They also had a portion of another of his Odd Thomas books in this film.  The special effects of the evil creatures was wonderfully done.  Would love to see this made into a series!!  I bought this from Amazon Prime.  So far, I love the idea of owning a movie but not having to find a place to store it in my home.  Seems to work in the ""cloud"" like Kindle and Audible--which I like !!",1396915200,,684,4.28125
6165425,4,B00HHYF59S,"This is an offbeat supernatural thriller base on the Odd Thomas series.  It attempts some of the macabre humor found in the book but falls short.  Like most movies today it depends upon the special effects, (they are excellent), at the expense of the plot.  A good example was Odd, has a card board cut of Elvis in his room, he actually was a ghost companion in the book.  If he didn't fit into the plot he should not have appeared in any fashion, it served only to remind you how thinned out the plot and characterization is in the movie.  Over all I enjoyed this and would recommend it to Odd Thomas fans, short of making it a mini series it probably couldn't have been done better.",1396915200,,684,4.3125

It turned out to be a true treat, and I hope that there will be more to follow as there were so many likable aspects.  Definitely something good too watch!",1396915200,,502,4.091836734693878

While some parts of the book were changed slightly or glossed over, this necessary evil didn't hurt the final product. The casting was exceptional, particularly Anton Yelchin as Odd. You may remember him as Chekov in the two more recent Star Trek films.

It is an odd quirky story, all light and shadow, impossible evil counterbalanced with the promise of ultimate good. Even after having read the book a couple of times, I found myself laughing and crying in all the right places.

The final scene is wrenching. Have the tissue box near at hand.",1396828800,,653,4.769911504424779
6165437,5,B00HHYF59S,"When I saw this movie, I was skeptical and almost reluctant to buy it as Hollywood absolutely massacred ""Watchers"", but did a fairly credible job on ""Phantoms"".  So, seeing who the director was (Mummy and Mummy 2), loving the Dean Koontz books - ALL of them! - and recognizing the star from a Terminator movie and (I believe) the Fright Night remake, I decided to try it.

Now, it's been quite a while since I first read Odd Thomas. so I can't be absolutely sure it remained absolutely faithful to the book, but it had to come awfully close as I recognized most of the characters and the parts they played.  I think the male lead (no, I can't remember his name!) did an excellent job.  I had a small problem with the written character because he was just a little too polite and mild for my liking, and the character in the movie didn't come off quite as milquetoast.  He was still very nice and polite and sweet, but had a slightly rougher edge that was more realistic and I liked it.

I kept hoping that they might change the ending as the one in the book made me sad, but I warned my son what might be coming and come it did - which didn't make him happy, but it did stay true to the book.  We really loved both of the Stormy characters
 - the written and the portrayed.  The actress did a great job.

Willem Dafoe was - as usual - terrific.  He played the police chief extremely well as he does just about everyone he brings to life.

I would say, even if you've never read the books, you will like the movie.  It was well paced, beautifully directed, perfectly cast with a crew who did a tremendous job bringing this unusual book to life.

Makes me wish that someone with as much talent as the people on this movie would consider doing a remake of ""Watchers"".  It was the best Dean Koontz book ever and could be a movie that would blow you away.  (HINT, HINT, HINT Hollywood!!)",1396828800,,1882,4.2740112994350286

6165443,4,B00HHYF59S,"I had never heard either of this movie, nor the series of Dean Koontz books (starting in 2003) on which the characters are based.  Also I wasn't really familiar with the director or actor so I had no idea whether or not I would find this appealing.

For a fairly low-budget, low-publicity production I found it definitely fun to view!  Imagine a cross between ""Back to the Future"" and ""Sixth Sense"", with a little ""John Dies at the End"", and you might come close to the type of film this is.

The DVD DOES (thank God) have subtitling, making it easy to catch everything being said.  Alas, it lacked any special features at all (except for a few trailers for other films).

The main character's first name (fictional of course), actually IS ""Odd"", which he explains right at the beginning.  The storyline is constantly interspersed with Odd's self-narration (which the audience listens to as if we're in his head).  For a guy who sees dead people, he is curiously upbeat, hopelessly in love with his lovely girlfriend, and seems almost immune to fear (as in when everyone else is running AWAY from tragedy, he's running full-tilt TOWARD it, trying to prevent bad things from happening or apprehend a killer (often given the urgent advice of the recently-departed looking for a little justice).

I can't say a lot more without giving away plot details, but will say this much: like in ""Sixth Sense"", he does occasionally have difficulty separating whether he's seeing a living or a dead person, but it does not use the ""sixth sense"" plot twist at the end, of finding out that he himself is dead.  More than that I can't say, except it's a mashed-up action-romance-comedy-supernatural thriller suitable for teens and above.  I enjoyed it.",1396828800,,1735,4.7885906040268456

I don't think Odd's character had time to develop before other events happened.

6165454,5,B00HHYF59S,"I do not typically write reviews but I felt compelled to put in my 2 cents about the long delayed film version of Odd Thomas.

The film is quite good and it is such a missed opportunity that it did not get the full 2012 theatrical release that it deserved due to Hollywood bs and legal battles.

I am a huge fan of the Odd Thomas books, and I felt the film adaptation did justice to Odd. The interpretation of the bodachs and some of the choices made by the director slanted the film slightly more towards horror and away from paranormal urban fantasy than my personal takeaway from the books, but it worked as a package. My boyfriend, who was completely unfamiliar with the books, quite loved the film ... Despite the fact he rarely likes anything,

I wonder if any of the other Odd books might find their way into film. Anton makes a great Odd, and the books only get better, so perhaps in this day of Amazon and Netflix Originals the Odd Thomas franchise won't die.",1396656000,,968,4.366666666666666

Anton's Odd Thomas was fun and believable in the world that Koontz built.  We had a fun time and will be watching this movie again.  I wish it had a special features section.

After the debacle that was the film Watchers I have often wondered why Dean Koontz would ever let Hollywood near one of his books again. He is a fantastic writer but the movies often fail. When I heard that Odd Thomas was now a movie I thought it was such a shame! Why would he put us through the torture of another book destroyed on screen? However, this was an excellent adaptation. Elvis' ghost is missing, sadly, and the portrayal of Ozzie Boone is way off. Beyond that, however, the movie is pretty true to the book and very entertaining.

I haven't read the books so I can't really compare which is probably better as the books that I have seen turned into movies rarely live up to my imagination. The main actor Anton Yelchin is quite likable and it is a good thing because much of the movie relies upon his narration. I think it could have benefited from a judicious trimming of much of the narration, but it works in any case.  The movie had enough twists in it to make it interesting although I wouldn't say this is high cinema. I feel like in many cases if the movie has a good ending that many of the movies shortcoming can be overcome. This movie had a good ending.

6165488,2,B00HHYF59S,"Anton Yelchin (Fright Night, 2011) stars as Odd Thomas, a high school student who can see the dead. The director made a great choice in casting Yelchin; his performance is on point. Everything else about this movie sucks.

The screenplay is throwaway. Willem Dafoe is wasted. Odd's girl Stormy (Addison Timlin) is very annoying. Everything is too scripted. Instead of introducing these characters one at a time, Odd Thomas plays like a sequel. There's a much larger story behind this misadventure, and the director ignores it.

Odd is working at his gig as a short-order cook when a suspicious looking character stumbles into the diner. He is soon followed by a pack of demons, who look to be lifted straight from Constantine(2005). They look identical to the demons hunting Keanu Reeves except for their semi-transparent, metallic skin. Did the director use the same CGI models? It sure looks like it. The budget doesn't seem to have allowed for proper skin textures.

The books must trump this lame movie because Dean Koontz wrote an entire series based on Odd Thomas. A sequel is uncalled for since I couldn't make it past the first half.

The movie and the book is a love story between Stormy and Odd with a lot of Dean Koontz tossed in. It is a contrast with Odd's purity and the evil which surrounds him. Odd sacrifices himself for good. He believes in something or someone who will bring about that good. He lives on eternal hope.

Also, in the book, Elvis Presley (as a ghost) was a very important character, and the only sign of him in the film was the cardboard cutout in Odd's room.

This movie feels like a TV movie--the sort they put out when they hope to make a television series from it.  It is basically a good adaption to the book, which I have read.  They did change the story--if my memory is correct--about Odd Thomas's mother.  They didn't go into Stormy's issues.

Other than that, it basically followed the plot line.  The guy that plays Odd was pretty decent, though he was more cutesy in the way Michael J. Fox was when he was young.  I always pictured Odd being more of a nerdy version of Billy Bob Thornton.  I think one of the perks of this movie is the actors, who for the most part really pulled it off.

My only complaint--they did not have Elvis haunting Odd.  Though the movie did have some humor, Elvis was a big part of making this story funny...and I didn't realize how much I depended on the humor to ease the tension of the sometimes grim story line.

Oh, and another warning--don't watch this while you are eating if you have a problem with bugs.  If you have a problem with bugs, be warned that this movie will feature bugs coming out of people's mouths.",1396396800,,1200,4.3558558558558556

The blending of Odd's strange visions with the mundane world was very well done. Anton Yelchin is a thoroughly convincing and charming Odd Thomas. The movie is a rollercoaster ride from start to finish. Though, if you've not read the books, perhaps I should warn you that you'll want some tissues handy for the ending.

I'm hoping that they'll make more movies based on the Odd Thomas books because I really enjoy them! If they can keep this flavor, they'd be great, I'm sure. I worry that it won't happen, though, because this movie was very under-advertized. I never saw a single commercial for it and only found out about it when a fellow Odd Thomas fan mentioned it on their Tumblr blog. I think that lack of publicity will probably hurt its finances and jeopardize further movies. Also, while I love Willem Dafoe, it really needs to be Anton's name under that title.

The special effects were spot on, the story engaging, and the acting believable. The only reason I considered giving this movie only a four star was Stormy's character drove me crazy.

I had really enjoyed reading this first book of the series and I'm excited to read the rest, but I'm curious to see if they will continue making films for the rest of the series. Despite my skepticism, I watched this film and was pleasantly surprised at the special effects and how the characters were portrayed. It was all just like the events in the book, except for some missing parts. One big missing part was Terri and the relationship that her and Odd had with each other. The character of Terri lead to the discussions about Elvis and I believe that that gave the book a light heartedness and even Odd had some what of a relationship with Elvis because they understood each other. Maybe that's really not a necessary part to include in a film, but I quite enjoyed the interactions between Odd and Terri and Odd and Elvis.",1396310400,,979,4.4748603351955305

Apparently, by choosing a smaller production company, Koontz was able to have more control.
This production of ""Odd Thomas"" definitely won't be up for any academy awards, and much of the subject matter may be lost on people who aren't familiar with the Odd Thomas books. However, as a die-hard fan of Odd Thomas, I was so happy to see the characters come to life in accurate portrayals, that I was able to overlook the so-so script.

As the author himself has publicly stated, actor Anton Yelchin was perfectly cast for the role of Odd Thomas.  The screenplay was good, as were the special effects.  For the squeamish, read the book first so you know when to close your eyes when those scenes come up in the movie.

Over-used jump cuts that you see in too many horror flicks - none of them made me jump. At the end of the movie, the twist (won't give it away) didn't make me feel sad since I never felt anything for these characters.

My wife was afraid that it had gratuitous gore (which we both hate), but nope! My wife is sensitive to anything more than a quick boo, but she enjoyed it. The scariest thing was the creatures that nobody but Odd (yelp, that's his name!) can see. They look like cellophane wrapped and ball in the shape of a human form.

Sometimes les is more. This adaptation of Dean Koontz novel had a lot of potential. Anton Yelchin makes a likable Oddand when the writer/director allows him to be just a guy, hes really appealing. But it seems like the filmmakers decided to go quirky (with a capital Q) in order to avoid any potential comparison with THE SIXTH SENSE and the result is so frenetic and over-cranked that the actors have no chance to connect with their audience.  Willem Dafoe is great as a small town police chief who likes Odd, even if he doesnt understand his abilities, and he and Yelchin play off each other well, but he (like the other actors) is playing second fiddle to some ectoplasmic creatures.

Koontz story is intact but the execution of the tale will try audiences patience. The original novel spawned a number of sequels but its unlikely this movie will have a follow-up.",1396051200,,986,4.687861271676301

The movie is true to the book.  some things have been changed.  like others, I was a bit disappointed with the Oz character.  But understand that you can only pack so much into a movie - the whole book is just not going to make it.

While I remember only snippets of the book's plot, I recall even now that I thoroughly enjoyed it and I adored Odd. So I couldn't wait to see this, though I was a bit nervous. How well could they capture Odd's essence on film?

Very well, much to my relief. Odd is as charming, quirky, and downright lovable a character on film as in the book. Stormy is pretty spot-on as well, though there were a few quick snippets of dialogue that felt rather contrived.  Despite this, their relationship and love for each other was very believable, and they were easily likeable characters. I also enjoyed seeing William Dafoe in this one- he's the only actor I recognized, but everyone was well-cast and the acting was good-to-great. No big duds stinking up the film.

The special effects were terrific, and I didn't notice any dead spots that felt like filler. A particular scene in the book that got a bigger-than-usual emotional reaction out of me evoked the same in the movie, even though I already anticipated it this time around. I thoroughly enjoyed this one, even though I knew where it was headed. I hope they move on to make movies of the other books in the series, and may they be as good as this one!

My wife and I watched Odd Thomas, the movie, this evening.

We were riveted from the first scene to the end, astounded by the faithfulness of the adaptation, and rocked to our core at the ending.

Fantastic direction, an incredible screenplay, and superb performances bring this Dean Koontz book to life in a way we never thought possible. This is the most enjoyable adaptation - especially of a sci-fi/thriller book - I've ever seen.

Instead of trying to figure out how to translate the narrative in Koontz's books into action on the screen they presented the thoughts the same way Koontz doe in his books - with first-person narrative. Odd Thomas' thoughts have always been a major part of any Odd story.

Maybe that is what make a Koontz tale what it is - the insertion of his personality into the story narrative. I wish more of his Odd Thomas books could get made into movies, but the internet buzz seems to think if this movie goes direct to DVD instead of through theaters (which it did) then the revenues will be lower and no sequel will follow. :-(",1396051200,,901,4.590062111801243

Lately Odd has been seeing ""bodachs"" who feed off of misery and pain. They are a portent to a great disaster, one Odd works to avoid as he believes it centers around ""Fungus Bob"" (Shuler Hensley).

The film is different from your typical horror film involving contact with ghosts. The dialogue is refreshingly light which made the film easy to watch and digest.

I have been fan of anton yelchin since CHARLIE BARTLETT and for the first time in a while, willem dafoe gets a likeable, noncreepy character to portray.  The supporting cast were also written in very well, with two of the main villains coming off as hilarious at times.
Given the quality of this film, it really shouldve seen the light of a theatrical release, if even just a limited one.

Dean Koontz's first Frankenstein was brought to the screen, but his name was not in the credits. He signed onto 'Odd Thomas'.

Nonetheless, as a true fan, it has to say something that I thought this movie was fabulous the first watch.  I felt it really stayed true to the story and the character.  There were some modifications, and it was fascinating to see Hollywood's portrayal of a ""bodach.""  I am genuinely pleased that this movie is so good and genuinely hope the series is continued.

Odd Thomas is a quirky but charming and funny character with unusual supernatural skills when it comes to the dead and awful.  This movie is nonstop, never a dull moment.  I thought the acting was great.  It has a compelling story line that's not just the hyped, ""I see dead people"" theme.

The character of Odd Thomas definitely has his own sense of humor - some here have called it childish - I disagree.  Obviously you need to have suspension of disbelief when reading or watching fiction - so, let's say this is someone's reality.  Would you not develop a very specific sense of humor?  I don't know that the character could have survived without it.  Bottom line, both the book and movie are fantastic.  Enjoy the ride!!",1395705600,,718,4.582677165354331

Five minutes ago I finished watching this movie and I was stunned at how well written, acted, and directed the film was. The storyline was captivating in true Dean Koontz fashion; and although I cannot compare it to the books, my fellow reviewers say that the movie stayed true to the book.

This rarely happens to an avid reader such as myself, but I actually enjoyed the movie MORE than the book.  They did an excellent job with the casting of the main character Odd Thomas and I was on the edge of my seat invested in what was happening even though I already new what was the outcome was going to be.

The characters in this movie act like they have been trapped in a Nickelodeon kid's show for the bulk of their lives.  In a horror/thriller that should be taken seriously--especially considering that there are demonic monsters everywhere--the good characters are spouting the lamest dialogue I have ever heard.  It's all a joke to these people.  They call each other cute and cuddly names like 3rd graders in love.  Just weird, distracting, and a complete destruction of suspension of disbelief.

There is a great action scene in the beginning where Odd catches a child murderer.  From their on it goes downhill.

If you LOVE Dean Koontz (the author of the book of the same title) that much, you should probably give it a try.  If you are looking for a serious supernatural thriller, this one is off the table.",1395273600,,1045,4.727777777777778

There is a funny moment when Odd and Stormy are in the church sacristy and she makes a hand gesture to Odd, and he asks are you telling me to go ahead or up yours? Also a hilarious sight gag where Tom Vosloo staggers in front of a tire shop, brandishing his amputated arm. The diner scenes are well done.

6165580,4,B00HHYF59S,There is a unique element here where the main character is a trusted element in the lives of his friends and family. The audience is spared the tired cliche' of the tortured loner who has to fight upstream through every person they meet to save the day because no one believes them. This character is more or less a whole person who has embraced their circumstances which frees the story up to really explore its own premise.

(He has panned most and denies existence of others.)  The casting could not have been better.  I hope to see other Odd movies with Anton Yelchin, though he probably would not like being billed as ""Yelchin IS Odd.""

The only thing my wife and I missed was Elvis, but The King's inclusion would have required another 30 min and might have interrupted the action.  Tough dude as I try to be, I had a real hard time not crying at the last scene with Stormy & Odd.  Will watch it again when wife isn't around.",1394668800,,704,4.2164179104477615

6165598,1,B00HHYF59S,"Odd Thomas was primarily a character driven book.  Odd explains a lot about Odd in the book.  We read about Elvis and his many powers to see the dead.  There are long sections about Odd's parents.  If you recall the book, then you will also recall that Odd is a passive character, and there wasn't a lot of action in the story.  This book instead appears to be the movie ""Pleasantville"" and Odd is Gomer Pyle, a simpleton character who is remarkably pleasant.  Odd was just pleasant and simple through the entire movie.  His girlfriend, Stormy, was also pleasant and simple through the entire movie.

There just wasn't a wide range of  emotional expression in the movie by  any of the characters.  I don't even think it was the fault of the actors.  It was just a book that did not translate well into a movie.  In an attempt to try to translate the book into a movie, Odd had to give us a lot of narration, and it did not come off very well.

The action was limited to the ghost of Fungus man tearing up the church,  and the very limited action at the end.

If you love Odd Thomas, this is not the movie for you.  Unfortunately, it is only Odd Thomas fans that would even consider saying it was good, and that is primarily because what was present was pretty true to the original story.",1394323200,16,1287,4.317991631799163

They couldn't have casted the movie better. A bit more work could have gone into production, as the effects seemed a little half baked, but like magic, the story breaks the tears every time. A kid so unassumingly good and a world so unjust as to depend on him for help only he can bring, only to deliver one blow after another. Poetic in a tragically humorous sort of way. You don't read or watch many characters with as much depth as Dean Koontz's Odd Thomas. When I get rich and famous, I will personally fund the next one.",1394236800,,683,4.221374045801527

I was scared when I was meant to be and cried even though I knew how it all would end.

6165610,4,B00HHYF59S,"As in 98% of all movies based on books, the book will always be better.
So many great details, subplots and dialogue allows books to win out nearly every time.

In this case, the book is still better...but not by much.
For fans of the book, the movie is a great translation. The sense and feel of the characters and situation were well portrayed and directed in this adaptation. The core essence of Odd Thomas and his relationship with Stormy is perfectly captured for this fan of all 6+ books.

For folks not familiar with the material, watching this on the big screen may prove to be difficult. Some of the monologue and dialogue leaves one wanting to push the pause button, re-read the subtitles and then go, ""Oh...that's what the character is trying to say."" With a book and blu-ray/DVD you can pause and re-read and figure out what exactly happened.

Thus no fault of the movie, it's the accurate content the movie is based on that makes one scene in particular (up in the church bell tower) a bit difficult to follow the heavy banter between the characters.

Yes, no Elvis ghost in here, which is an unfortunate direction of the movie. If they have more Odd Thomas movies (I hope they do!!) we need Frank's ghost and ghost dog for certain. Sometimes these ghosts are key to helping Odd take the next step in solving the mystery.

Otherwise, I found nothing wrong with the movie. Good visuals and staying true to the books. It's the best Koontz story adaptation I can think of off the top of my head.

A must watch for fans of the book.

In fact, he generally attempts to avoid dangerous encounters unless he absolutely has to.

6165628,4,B00HHYF59S,"Let us all be honest. No one should give the movie adaptation of a book 5 stars. It's just not possible to transmit all the details of a book that takes 4-6 hours to read, into a 90 minute film. The actors will probably look nothing like what you pictured in your head while reading. There's no way to guarantee that the lead actors will have chemistry on screen. The screen writer is bound to cut or modify your favorite part of the book because it really has no bearing on the arc of the story.

However, Odd Thomas does deserve 4 stars for doing a much better job of adapting this story than other recent films based on books. I sat down to watch this movie, and rarely did I have something to truly nit-pick about. (With the exception of Oz... HORRIBLE casting decision!!!!)

The movie is faithful to the book, it's entertaining, and I hope they make a couple more Odd Thomas films.",1394150400,,886,4.363636363636363

The movie, I thought did a great job with the boadochs which was one thing I was skeptical about.  Great job, I will even watch this movie again, something I seldom do.

6165634,4,B00HHYF59S,"RLJ/Image Entertainment brings Dean Koontz's best-selling supernatural thriller ""Odd Thomas"" to life for the big-screen. Judging the movie on its own merits without having read any of the novels, the low-budget movie is an entertaining ""who-dun-it"" featuring ghostly and ghastly guest stars. It feels like it might be better suited to being a weekly television series.

Odd Thomas (Anton Yelchin) is a short-order cook in the seemingly lovely little town of Pico Mundo, California. However, both Pico Mundo and Odd Thomas harbor dark secrets. Odd has a ""gift"" for seeing dead people and sensing evil. The town is a haven for brutal murders, supernatural mayhem, and a feeding ground for the festering demonic specters known as bodachs. Odd teams up with his girlfriend Stormy Llewellyn (Addison Timlin) and Detective Wyatt Porter (Willem Dafoe) to solve a string of killings that somehow tie together.

While I was watching ""Odd Thomas,"" I was jolted by my recollection that Stephen Sommers directed it. The SAME Stephen Sommers who produced and directed the blockbuster ""The Mummy"" movies and helmed ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra."" You'd never know it from the independent atmosphere this carries.

You can tell ""Odd Thomas"" was a labor of love for Sommers and the proof is in the credits. Not only did he direct, but he produced and wrote it. There are rumors of a lot of drama in production, but the director saw it through to the end and worked with the budget put before him.

Although the budget might've been small in comparison to Stephen Sommers' other franchise films, the special effects of ""Odd Thomas"" are actually close to on par with those blockbusters. In comparison to the CGI seen today, they're a tiny bit aged but get the job done. The only noticeable digital creatures are the bodachs and they actually look a heck of a lot better than the Scorpion King did in ""The Mummy Returns.""

""Odd Thomas"" isn't rated, but does include violence, gore, adult situations, and language. For all intents and purposes, it should hold a PG-13 rating at the most. There's nothing too graphic and no nudity is included.

I felt ""Odd Thomas"" reflected some Christian beliefs well. The character speaks about how he believes in Heaven. The bodachs are obviously demonic forces that are attracted to evil, much like the fallen angels read about in the Bible. Odd also tells the killer's victims they're going to a better place. They dissolve into either glittering dust or flowers and float off after they've made peace.

""Odd Thomas"" might not be as good as it should've been had it been given more financial backing. For what it is, I found the movie charming, gleefully campy in places, and ripe for another entry in the series if this one can just pay back its budget. It's not often Dean Koontz has liked the movie adaptations of his books, but he actually likes this one.

""I'm just happy. You never know if anything's going to be a success or not, but I can watch this again. And the rest of them I couldn't watch again. Some [of my movies] I couldn't watch the first time,"" Koontz told website io9. If anyone knows if his book was adapted correctly, it would have to be the author that created the world and its characters. I still think it would work great as a weekly TV series, but I'll settle for a movie every year.",1394064000,,3327,4.753899480069324

Because of the length of movies stuff was cut, I don't want to give any spoilers, those who have read the book will see what I am talking about. This movie would have been excellent, but, as I said earlier the charm didn't come through. The relationship between Odd and Stormy was not as intense as it should have been. It is hard to really like a character when you don't have the time to know and understand them. Unfortunately, my husband (who has not read the book) didn't enjoy the movie as much as I.

There were several things changed or left out of the book which is also understandable but does take away from the movie if you have read the book first. Also one of the most love able characters from the book (Elvis) wasn't present which, again, is somewhat understandable. Plus there were some ""they can't do that!"" moments.

While I understand the need for the movie makers to modify the story, leave out Elvis, etc. these points do make the movie a 3-3.5 stars for me. It was enjoyable but if you have read the book first it won't compare as many other book to screen adaptions don't.

I will also point out that if I had made a movie out of the book it would have probably been 3-4 hours long....so not many w",1393545600,,969,4.148936170212766

The story dragged slightly in the middle (very slightly) other than that it was very interesting and had enough pace to keep me interested. I really liked the main character. The actor I have enjoyed in other movies and he was fantastic in this role. Dafoe was also good but when is he not.

If you like interesting mystery and murder with a touch of the supernatural and oddities of the Odd :), Then feel welcome to watch this movie it won't let you down.

Also reminded me slightly of Men in black. For some strange reason.",1393545600,,568,4.390476190476191

I don't think that when (or if), this gets released at the theaters, that it will be a blockbuster.  It doesn't have the pacing or feel for that, but I enjoyed it.

Which is probably why I am disappointed that this has more of a campy, made-for-tv feel to it, than it should have.  The Bodacks aren't sufficiently creepy, and fungus man reminds me of the Edgar suit from Men In Black.  Disgusting, but not sinister.  The girl they have playing Stormy belongs in a high school theater group, but the guy they have playing Odd isn't bad.  That being said, they stayed very true to the book, which is awesome.

CGI is used sparsely for a few creepy supernatural effects, and the physical violence is short on gore and high on bullets, perfect for the storyline but probably not enough to satisfy horror film fans paying first run full price at the theater. Plot driven, the character development is minimal, and the villains and there motivations are little more than sketched in, rendering it entertaining but a bit emotionally unsatisfying.",1393372800,,659,5.055045871559633

This movie seems to be a ""barker"" from beginning to end.  The Director starts off trying to make it a comedy.  Mix in some really bad acting, poorly recorded voice-overs, lousy sound, bad scripting and you end up with: ""Hideous Adaptation of a Good Novel""

I mean really, why does a good novel rate such disrespectful treatment.

6165767,3,B00HHYF59S,"Let me open by saying I love the Odd Thomas books and have read every one.  One of the things I like about them is the unique atmosphere.  Odd is a very strange guy, so a strange universe for him is fitting.

I liked this movie.  It was very well done, and I think they captured Pico Mundo very nicely.  I didn't love the movie, though, and I'm disappointed in it.  The character of Odd is supposed to be pretty strange in almost every way.  In this movie, he's a totally normal, well adjusted guy next door who seems pretty cool.  Oh yeah, and he can see the dead.  In the book, Odd is ANYTHING but normal and pretty cool.  And his ""gift"" isn't just some oh-isn't-that-interesting quirk in an otherwise fairly normal guy.  Also, Odd's relationship with Stormy is supposed to be almost completely chaste.  No, they aren't rolling around together, but the normal boyfriend/girlfriend kissing isn't in keeping with the book.  They don't engage in physicality because Stormy is so fragile in many ways because of her abuse.  Stormy here in the movie looks and acts like she should be on the pep squad.

Other than the huge differences in characterization, I think this movie is pretty good.  I was actually watching it and wondering if maybe the problem was my interpretation, and everything here was like the book.  Still not sure if that's the issue, but I like that books the way I know them.",1393286400,3,1392,4.548387096774194

I seen a number of Koontz books made into movies (e.g. Watchers - done terribly) and this is by far the best adaptation  of  any of his books to a movie.  The best part is they adapted most of the actual dialog in the book to the movie script without screwing around with Koontz's fantastic wit.  Oddie was Oddie and Stormy was Stormy - no ""based on"" but complete re-write of the characters here.  Spoiler alert - if you're not a Koontz reader stop reading NOW!  The way they handled the mall scene with Stormy through to the end was incredibly well done an touching!  My ONLY complaint - with all the Elvis impersonators and FX available they could have done MUCH better than an Elvis cutout in Odd's room.  At first I didn't like the casting of Willem Dafoe as Chief Porter but he brought the Chief alive just fine.  Move on to ""Forever Odd"".",1393286400,,905,4.333333333333333

I don't think they conveyed the importance of Odd & Stormy's relationship well enough, though. And, Stormy seemed a little too artificial, somewhat 2 dimensional.

Fungus man... looked more like D'Onofrio in MIB(during the alien transition) than his written description.  The Bodachs.... not even close.  The visual accuracy in these characters was imperative to the tone of the story.

It follows the book very well, nails the details, and as my headline suggests, has something for everybody: mystery, romance, horror, humor, tragedy.  I only hope they keep going in this vein and continue with the series!",1393027200,,271,4.869565217391305

6165871,3,B00HHYF59S,"""I may see dead people but then, by God, I do something about it."" Odd Thomas (Yelchin) is a fry cook with a secret, he sees dead people. Most of the dead people he sees are harmless and just annoying but when a stranger shows up with a group of ghost bodachs Odd knows that is up to him to stop them. Along with his girlfriend Stormy and the sheriff (Dafoe) Odd must stop the destruction before it's too late. Before I begin I should say that I have never read the book so I didn't know what to expect from this going in. The movie itself wasn't that bad but it did have one problem. A movie like this with this subject matter shouldn't take itself as serious as it did. Movies like Dylan Dog, Dead Before Dawn and R.I.P.D. all have the same basic idea and they were all more comedy then anything which made them cheesy but watchable. This one stayed away from the comedy aspect and I think that hurt it, to me anyway. I think that trying to be a straight action/horror movie wasn't the way to take this one. Overall, a movie that was OK but I think suffered by taking itself too seriously. I give this a B-.",1393027200,,1109,4.162790697674419

6165874,5,B00HHYF59S,"everyone has their own taste but I am a huge fan of the odd Thomas series by Dean Koontz. This adaption was well done, well cast and was very enjoyable to watch. It follows very closely to the first book of the Odd Thomas series there are a few differences but that is always to be expected. The part of Odd Thomas is what had me most worried as the character in the books is so original and you cant help but love him. I thought Anton Yelchin did a great job with Odd as good as could be expected. If you have read the books and loved them like i did then this movie should not disappoint, just go into knowing that adaptions from books always have some changes and don't judge it to harshly.",1393027200,,693,4.102941176470588

With only a few omissions from it's original story, this movie stays true to Odd and will leave you wanting more in the end. It's been a long time since I've seen a movie based off a book and been truly happy with with the end results. This movie is great. If you are not already an Odd Thomas fan your about to become one!

I really loved it. I hadn't read the book, but needless to say, I went straight to the Kindle store and downloaded it right after the credits. Stormy was my favorite character. I can't wait to read the book and get to know the wonderful side characters better. I'm sure I'll gobble up the whole series.",1392940800,,466,4.4941176470588236
6165891,5,B00HHYF59S,"First I would like to say, not every book turned to a movie will live up to your expectations as a reader, but don't harp on a movie because they didn't turn every word in the book into the 'movie magic' you might be expecting. With that being said I think that they have made a pretty good film. I think that they left enough room for not only the watcher to be imaginative when it comes to aspects of the story but also they left enough room for the main character to grow into our expectations and develop a sense of purpose. The tail end of the movie being where those items previously mentioned are laid out before the audience. Again, if you didn't like the movie because it doesn't match your expectations afters reading the book, refer to the statement made in the beginning. However if you are on the fence and wish to have some more background about the series, or have watched it and really enjoyed it, I encourage you to read the books.",1392940800,,948,4.331460674157303
6165892,3,B00HHYF59S,"One of my favorite books from my favorite author, I was beyond the moon when I saw this was made into a movie. Maybe that's why I was a little disappointed.  Odd Thomas is such an amazing character, I truly don't know who could have done him justice.  Also, the relationship between between Odd and Stormy in the books is just so effortless and charming. The movie came across as a bit forced.  All in all, it was worth watching.",1392940800,13,429,4.3375
6165893,4,B00HHYF59S,"It was a little bit predictable, and little lacking in some acting but overall different and decent. Great atmosphere too.",1392940800,,122,5.15

6165895,5,B00HHYF59S,"This movie was better than my expectations, the writers created quite an original story line.  It wasn't a gory movie, just more thought provoking.  I recommend it because it held my interest, even though it could be on the light side at times for a true horror buff.",1392940800,,267,4.541666666666667
6165896,5,B00HHYF59S,"I did not have good expectations going in to this movie, because of so many disappointments due to awful creative changes Hollywood make from the books. Stephen Sommers did a great job directing with this adaptation. It only had very small changes, and nothing that changed the plot. Anton Yelchin played Odd Thomas flawlessly. He really captured the mannerisms and quirkiness from the Odd Thomas from the book. Addison Timlin was great as Stormy as was Willem Dafoe as the Chief. All in all, this was a great movie. Great pacing, great acting, awesome effects on the bordachs and some really good chills. This movie should have been a major  release. It is leaps and bounds better than a lot of other movies I have seen in the theater lately.  I highly recommend the movie and the Dean Koontz Odd Thomas books.",1392940800,,811,4.704225352112676
6165897,4,B00HHYF59S,"This was a wonderful adaptation of the book.

Like Lord of the Rings...It was too short and some changes were made(Some I understand being needed for the visual element and time and some I don't) But what was done was so close to the book that you have to see it.

The 2 main characters were perfect in the parts they played.  The whole feel of the books in way the world works around Odd and the balance of serious and humor was dead on.

I can't say what this would be like if you haven't read the books....curious to see a review from someone.",1392940800,,546,4.171428571428572

6165911,3,B00HHYF59S,"Anton did nice job as Odd, but I didn't feel the chemistry between him and Stormy as much as I""d like. And some of the Chief's dialogue was really not working in flick version. All of us who love the ODD novels, clearly, have high expectations for any treatmentss of Koontz's excellent character and supernatural adventures he undertakes. This one was okay. It didn't follow the novel precisely (which I understand for the screen, things get compressed or altered for effect).

It's not awful and it's not great, hence the 3 stars. But one can enjoy it and have fun with it.",1392854400,,574,4.627450980392157

Others here have explained the story about Odd Thomas being a short order cook who see's dead people and battles demons and badguys, with a pretty girlfriend  named Stormy Lywellen by his side. It was true to the book telling of the story. There are  no big stars here except Wiliam Defoe. But all the other young actors Like Anton yelchin who plays odd Thomas are  real good.(I think anton yelchin  played Chekov in Star trek too)The young actress playing Stormy Lywellen was right on too. She is a good and lovely actress!  I really enjoyed the watch and hope they continue making quality Odd Thomas movies. If they do. I for one will be watching.",1392854400,,687,4.5528455284552845

I was literally sucked in five minutes in. I really enjoyed it from beginning to end and look forward to more in this series. I'm going to read it now as well. I can't really think of much to say that doesn't give it away for those who haven't watched or read. Just give it a shot, it's worth it!",1392854400,,525,3.861111111111111

Anton Yelchin carries this film more than Stephen Sommers directing ruins it.  CGI effects range from TV quality to pretty well done.  Some good moments in the film made it worth it.,1392854400,,352,4.453125

And the script was so true to the original story that it was truly like seeing the novel come to life!

That being said, this movie was excellent (got to see it online) - much better than any Koontz to film movie has been to date. The plot seems to follow the book rather well (at least to the best of my memory - I read Odd Thomas when it first came out and only the once). The real gem of this movie, however, is Anton Yelchin. He gives life to Odd in a way that even the books were lacking and makes the character that much more likeable.

Hopefully, this does very well in sales and maybe we'll get the other books to film as well. I can only hope that if we do, they are as well made as this one!",1392681600,,816,3.7941176470588234

6165965,4,B00HHYF59S,"This is how you should make a movie! I have always liked Anton and the roles he has played in and adding Willem Dafoe to this cast blends young with mature talents of the horror/fantasy genre. Its fun, witty ,silly, highly stylized with great effects and as an added bonus a pretty cool storyline. Can you imagine a horror/fantasy movie with good direction, great effects, good acting and a cool story in the same movie? Well, believe it or not this has it all!!!
As I stated in my title I would love to see this turned into a TV series especially if they could get Anton and Defoe to play their screen roles in the series. A show the entire family could enjoy together and talk about afterwards.
I can't believe that I broke my rule on not buying into the ""Watch it now before its in theaters"" hype amazon throws at us for even higher fee's, but I did and am quite happy with spending the extra to watch ""Odd Thomas""",1392681600,3,917,4.30635838150289

6165983,3,B00HHYF59S,"Fast paced, moves along quickly and so do the actors.  Not much depth put into this one.  Definitely looks like it was made for TV.  I'm sure a TV series is coming.",1392681600,,164,4.0625
6165984,4,B00HHYF59S,Odd Thomas has a gift and that gift is somewhat strange. He was born with it and the fact that his mother gave him this name doesn't make it any odder. Odd ran a life of simplicity of service to others and the dead. He worked as a fry cook in a small greasy spoon for people who loved him unconditionally. Despite his odd gift he managed to live a fairly normal life. His one and only love Stormy was the light of his life and losing her to some bloodthirsty criminals almost destroyed him. But he found the strength to carry on but he couldn't do there. So he set out on his own to find himself and in so doing he found more dead to help. I can't wait to see more series in this line. Odd Thomas is some serious good writing. It's pretty straight forward so the creative license that any director or writer might have with the scripting has to be better than what others have done to Koontz other books such as Watchers. This time there isn't much room for change. Which I liked because after all Odd is Odd and there's no changing Odd.,1392681600,,1037,4.164179104477612

Hopefully the start of a great sequel.",1392681600,,161,4.678571428571429
6165987,4,B00HHYF59S,The adaptation of Odd Thomas from a Dean Koontz book to movie is by far the best of all his book to movie adaptations. The only thing I was disappointed by was some missing characters but it was understandable.,1392681600,,210,4.410256410256411

6165990,3,B00HHYF59S,"Not fair to write a review before watching the whole movie. But. I read other reviews and they said it could not get any closer to the book...  Other movies of DK's books were a dud for me. This one is going that way. It ""may"" follow the story line...
 As I remember the Odd character, he was not Sugar Ray Lenard with his fists, I don't recall him being a fighter at all! Well he is  now. And Stormy, yes a knock out in his eyes, and pretty to others  but this girl is not her in my mind. I never saw her as a girl next door type of beauty.
 I should have known when I herd him (Odd) say something like ""The dead talk to me and I do something about it"" A little to macho for Odd. At least the Odd I came to like.
 So I just watched the end. ehhh,  I changed my stars from don't like to OK. I would not go any higher then OK.
 If you didn't read the book I'm sure it will be entertaining. And if you did, as long as you don't have a real strong image of Odd and Stormy you should be OK.",1392681600,,986,3.7294685990338166

6166021,4,B00HHYF59S,This stayed pretty true to the book with the exception of the famous deceased singer who hangs around with Odd in the first few novels (I won't spoil it in case you want to read the book).  I think those who enjoy the books will enjoy the movie.,1392595200,,245,4.104166666666667

I have grown to love.  At one of my grown kids's home they have rented it twice from Amazon.  The second time they had their siblings over to watch it also. It is the equivalent of a PG13 rating.

Created with quirkiness and style.  The director left his ego at the door and presented Odd's world in all it's simplicity and complexity with grace and respect for our courageous hero. It would have been a blockbuster if it had been given a wide release in the theaters!  No wonder Dean Koontz was thrilled when he first watched the completed movie.  It would make a spectacular TV series but I am hoping for the miracle of the first ever blockbuster theatrical release sequel to a movie that went straight to rental & DVD.",1392595200,,804,4.398648648648648

The movie started with a great chase scene and took off from there with non stop action, comedy suspense and great fx. It has the standard script, one you've seen a million times, the reluctant Shero was extremely annoying, despite that, the movie is still a worth while watch.",1392595200,,347,4.612903225806452

6166050,5,B00HHYF59S,I think they did an absolute great job in adopting this to the screen. I am still not too sure about how I feel about the way it was released.

The story is wonderful, if sad, but I never thought Odd could be brought to the screen. I have never been so happy to be wrong. I hope the sequels are coming too! NEVER thought I would say that!!!!",1392508800,3,416,4.085365853658536
6166053,5,B00HHYF59S,"This movie was beyond my expectations. Like other reviewers stated, I was hesitant to watch it because movies adapted from Dean Koontz books in the past have been very disappointing. The acting was on par, the actors that played Odd and Stormy were perfect for the parts and I couldn't have imagined better. The movie stuck to the story line relatively well, with a few minor difference, but they did not detract from the story. I recommend watching this movie, maybe on a date night because it has everything, action, suspense, romance and comedy.",1392508800,3,548,4.840425531914893

Both myself and my father really liked the books, and we both thought Sommers did a good job bringing it to the screen.

6166059,5,B00HHYF59S,To say that I love Odd Thomas is an understatement- I read every book and I fell in love with him in every sense of the word. I did not have high hopes for the movies because movies can never do the written word justice- especially when the words are so great. I did love this movie. It was true to what made me fall in love with Oddie-the same things that bring me back to his life's journey and the people dead and alive he encounters.,1392422400,,437,4.0344827586206895

I missed the ghost of Elvis but the life size cutout was a nice nod to the book.  I love Odd Thomas and I hope the other books are made into movies just as well.",1392422400,,432,3.7666666666666666

I am not sure how the movie will be perceived by the masses but I hope everyone gives this movie a chance - it is worth it I think. I hope they plan to continue with the series.

Odd was a pleasant surprise the movie stayed very close to the book.  I was of course disappointed at the things that were left out to keep the movie from being ten hours long.  Anton Yelton does a great job of being Odd.  I enjoyed the way he brought out Odd's  quirks and honest love of life.

 Odd was done very well.  There were changes yes, but none that harmed the heart of the story. Elvis may not have been his companion, but he did appear.  Honestly,  I was set to be disappointed. And honestly, I can say I was entertained all thru the movie. special effects, great.  Story line - great.  True enough to the book, and could still stand on its on for those who've never read Odd Thomas (Seriously, who would never read Dean? He rocks!)

Anton Yelchin is a talented actor and he made me see  the Odd One.  William DaFoe is again a favorite and very talented actor. I'll watch the movie again before my rental is over. When it hits theaters I'll be there to see it - nothing like an entertaining movie, popcorn and a soda.

Lets hope they treat future Koontz books to media with the same quality, respect and attention to the details that make the book great. Pass the popcorn and hit play  there Odd One!",1392336000,,1166,4.438679245283019

The Comedy aspect isn't that funny and does not really fit into a crime-sci-fi-horror scenario. Its one genre too many. The acting, especially by Odds girlfriend is poor. She`s very pretty but nothing more .The fictitious is overdone so that you can't really identify with anything that is happening and therefore stop caring.

I think this movie might have impressed me if I were a kid or teenager, but it won't impress the seasoned sci-fi-horror watcher.",1392336000,,595,4.721153846153846

His books can be so intricate, reality within reality, play of time, play of space especially. I was reluctant to read the first Odd Thomas book, cause it sounded too out there for me, but so many friends and co-readers loved it, I did. Definitely a different character, but despite occasionally getting irritated by his simplistic goodness, he grows on you, and I continue to read his books. That they found an actor to portray him so close to the character in my head, I'm amazed.  Anton Yelchin really delivers the character and deserves a lot of praise.  And Addison Timlin actually works with Anton so well with her delivery of Stormy. They portray difficult characters to portray- just really simple, good people with exceptional experiences. In today's society they would be perceived as down right dorky, yet......It's a thin line Koontz treads when he writes of Odd, but it shows his talent as a writer that one keeps on reading.  And I agree with them leaving out Elvis-I think more mainstream movie goers would have found that too much. A really well done adaptation of the book! I'm now trying to think if the other Odd books could be done-the first one was one of  Koontz' simpler works, and that undoubtedly helped with the translation to screen.  I would definitely watch Anton Yelchin continue with Odd's journeys!! He was great!",1392336000,12,1485,4.696153846153846

How could i not give it five stars?
Thank you",1392336000,,94,3.75
6166157,5,B00HHYF59S,This is a must see movie...at first I wasn't going to rent it but glad I did. I really enjoyed this movie.,1392249600,,106,3.8636363636363638
6166158,5,B00HHYF59S,"Good movie that kind of reminded me of ""Frighteners""... It was both funny and creepy... and a movie you could watch with your kids.(In my opinion... if the kids were around 13 and up)",1392249600,,183,4.411764705882353
6166159,5,B00HHYF59S,"I have read the whole series so it's been awhile since the 1st book & from memory, this film hits all the main points in the time given. Hmmm. No pun intentionally intended...  :-)  Yes, there were parts left out, (shucks, another unintentional pun) but it would take a mini-series to effectively cover the entire 1st book & a TV series to cover the rest of the Odd books. Absolutely delighted w/Anton Yelchin's portrayal of Odd Thomas. In my mind, he fits my mental picture of Odd perfectly. As does Addison Timlin's Stormy. Both just lovely. The creepy bodachs were well, even creepier than I imagined; the special effects of the house from hell, definitely worked for me. I for one, hope to see more of Koontz's 2nd most lovable character, Odd Thomas, brought to screen again. I say 2nd most lovable because my 1st favorite & most lovable is Einstein, the golden retriever from ""Watchers"". (They should remake that movie adaptation to match the endearing success of this one.) On a side note, just finished reading the latest Odd Thomas book (""Deeply Odd"") not too long ago & got such a kick out of the new character (""Edie"") that Odd teams up with.
So, I don't typically spend more than $3.99 to watch a movie online, but had been eagerly waiting for Odd Thomas for what, a couple of years now? Found it today at Amazon & immediately forked out the $10 to watch it. IMFHO (in my frugal humble opinion) absolutely well worth it for the entertainment & plan to watch it again before my rental is up. And yep, here I knew the whole durn story & still had to have a hanky in hand at the end of the movie just as I did when I finished reading the book.",1392249600,58,1651,4.427631578947368
6166160,3,B00HHYF59S,"First off I have read every Odd Thomas book, just to get that out of the way.  All in all I thought the movie was fairly faithful to the book with  a few glaring exceptions.  Why take out Elvis?  Why reduce Ozzie's character to a mere cameo appearance?  The movie was short enough that both these could have been kept in.  Those are the two major omissions but there were a few other things.  They didn't go into Odd's background with his parents enough.  and there were a few odd changes.
Odd didn't seem like the Odd I had pictured when reading but then again that's the great thing about books.  Everyone who reads a story will see things a little differently in their mind. Honestly, the movie was much better than I expected from a (basically) straight to dvd movie.
The bottom line is that I think most people who liked the books will like the movies other than the few who want everything to be exactly like they see it when they read the books.  If you haven't read the books you may like it even more since you don't go in with a preconceived idea of what the characters should look like or sound like.  Hope they do more of these.",1392249600,,1140,4.280373831775701
6166161,5,B00HHYF59S,I enjoyed watching this Odd Thomas movie. I really liked the way they did the creatures. I was however disappointed that Odd used a gun in the end. The fact that Odd never uses guns was a big part of his character.  I do hope that we see more Odd Thomas movies. There were some changes but I thought the movie stayed very close to Dean Koontz book. The movies never do the books justice.  Dean Koontz is my favorite author and I am a big Odd Thomas fan as well. It would be great to see all of the Odd books as movies.,1392249600,,518,3.9711538461538463
6166192,5,B00HHYF59S,"I never read the books, this was my first exposure to the Odd Thomas series and after watching it, I promptly bought the first book for Kindle.  At the writing of this review I'm halfway through the book and its a faithful adaption.  Anton Yelchin is a wonderful choice for casting and as I read the novel I hear Mr Yelchin's voice in my head as narration.  There are differences of course between book and movie but from what I've seen so far the movie is plenty satisfying and I felt my rental fee was money well spent.",1392249600,,521,4.295918367346939
6166193,5,B00HHYF59S,"Odd Thomas has been my favorite book for years. I was extremely excited and nervous when I found out a movie was finally done for it. Butchering of this story would have torn me apart.

Of course there will be differences. Not everything can be verbatim, and honestly, who would want that? I believe the adaptation was as true to the book as I have ever seen. I don't think I have seen a film adaptation as well done as this.

Above all, the characterization was the most important detail I was looking for. I have very, very high opinions of Odd's character. Koontz made his character perfect and I was unable to believe that the film could be so true to Koontz' detail, persona, tone, attitude, etc. But I was extremely happy with actor's portrayal and the director's vision that kept Odd Thomas the lovable, modest, simple guy that he was created as.

I'm glad to say that not only is Odd Thomas my favorite book, but my favorite movie as well.",1392249600,,947,4.46242774566474

6166196,5,B00HHYF59S,I am a huge fan of Dean Koontz and especially of all the Odd Thomas books. As such I didn't have a whole lot of enthusiasm for a film adaptation but I decided to watch it anyway. I was so thrilled that I did as the movie is simply wonderful. Yelchin plays a perfect Odd Thomas and Stephen Sommers did an amazing job with the whole thing. I am definitely going to watch this movie again and I recommend it to anyone with a couple of hours on their hands.,1392163200,,453,4.044444444444444
6166197,5,B00HHYF59S,"I think this was a wonderful adaptation of the Odd Thomas book series by Dean Koontz.  Coming someone who has read all the currently published novel except for the most recent, I believe Anton, the actor who played Odd, did a great job in expressing the character's personality and enough though there for a few overly dramatic part, I.e. the slow time fight scenes, I think it was an enjoyable movie for Koontz fans and others who like a little dark horror and mystery.",1392163200,,470,4.595238095238095

I had the vib of Frighteners meets Donnie Darko but better! Total roller coaster ride with a sweet love story even made the dialog enjoyable and showing you can have fun with it and not be hoaky!

6166220,1,B00HHYF59S,"Don't get me wrong, I KNOW that books are always better.  But the premise of the books, as Odd's friend and world famous author repeatedly advises, is to keep the tone light, let the story carry itself.  None of that is evident here.  It's what makes the stories fun to read.  This Odd did not play well to the character in the books at all.  And whatever did happen to Little Ozzie (all 400+ lbs of him)?  He isn't even mentioned in this film, which diminishes the character development for Odd in general, contributing to the lack of character development at all.  The transition of his parents relationship and mom's different future per the film almost makes sense, except that if it wasn't for mom's unhealthy obsession with guns Odd never would have gone back to look at Fungus man's wound and wouldn't have discovered the tattoo, Satanic cult connection.  Fair enough, the ""items"" in the fridge were not true to the story, but that was probably in favor of good taste (writing is one thing, seeing, something different altogether).  The sheriff does not look at all like his text character, and his demeanor is off too.  He was like a father to Odd, not annoyed by him and his ""gift"" as the movie seems to portray.  If you haven't read the books it probably wouldn't make sense, and if you did it is just annoying and frustrating.  I hope there are no follow ups to this abortion.",1392163200,6,1387,4.548387096774194
6166221,3,B00HHYF59S,"Somewhere along the way...I don't know whether it was the third book or later...I simply got tired of the Odd Thomas series. Heck, it feels like there have been twenty or so of the books. The first one held my attention. I cannot remember the second one, and I felt the last Odd Thomas book was a severe waste of my time. I don't know whether or not this carried into my viewing of the film or not.

I guess I'm just suffering from Odd Thomas fatigue. Still, the movie is better than most...not as good as many. The ending seemed contrived by both the scriptwriter and the actors. And, where was Little Ozzie in the movie? I can understand writing Elvis almost out...a standup cardboard cutout is better than a ghost...but I have to disagree with those who said the book was honored throughout the movie.

If you still are loving the Odd Thomas series, you'll probably love this movie. If you are still only reading the series to see if Dean Koontz will ever turn the corner, then you will find this movie boring.",1392163200,,1013,4.440860215053763
6166222,5,B00HHYF59S,"This was a very good adaptation of the book.  I did miss Elvis, but I agree with what another person had said that it would have detracted from the true purpose of this story.  Stormy & Odd's relationship is totally captured by Yelchin & Timlin and I have to admit I had doubts with Dafoe as Sheriff Porter, but he did not disappoint.  In the end, I cried, even though having read the book numerous times, I knew what was coming.

The book series is a wonderful page turner. Anton Yelchin was wonderful as Odd. I hope he makes a sequel as I loved ""seeing"" Odd portrayed. If you are not familiar with the books, I would read it before you watch the movie.
Quirky and adorable, Odd Thomas is that mix of supernatural, sci-fi and love story that makes the genre worth following. So to the powers who be, loop us in, and make more Odd films.",1392163200,,566,4.25

It was one of the most suspensful movies I have ever seen with out being too much. I was taken by suprise. You really captured Odd's character and Dean Koontz's indepth thrillers.
