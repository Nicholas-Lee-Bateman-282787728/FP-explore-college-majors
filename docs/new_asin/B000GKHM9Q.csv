8133286,1,B000GKHM9Q,Does not play on my device because it was made in the U.K.!!!  Customers should be made aware that DVDs made in the United Kingdom will not work in the U.S.!!!,1401062400,,159,4.129032258064516
8133287,1,B000GKHM9Q,"I paid $40 for this for my nieces birthday.  It would not play in the blue ray or regular dvd player.  She was so sad.  We eventually got it to work in the computer but she is only 2, she can not sit in the computer chair alone.  Waste of money I should have bought the books.  Lesson learned.",1391472000,,293,3.8983050847457625
8133288,3,B000GKHM9Q,"I can't say whether or not it works, because I have yet to receive it...instead of getting this in the mail, I got Dr. Who.
Thanks to all the reviews on here, I prepared myself by first buying a DVD player that supports most regions.
But I am still waiting to find out if everything is going to work.
I gave 3 stars because I simply don't know what I'm getting yet, and because of the order mess up.
I will gladly come back to give a higher rating at a later date if this series is what I am expecting it to be.",1377820800,,511,3.923076923076923

8133291,4,B000GKHM9Q,"This might be five stars. I'm giving it four. Why? Not having seen it, I can't be sure. Why haven't I watched it? Because although the Amazon blurb says ""All Regions"" it's Region 0 PAL format and doesn't play on US standard Region 1 NTSC DVD players. It says this on the box. Of the UK and for the UK. I hope Amazon changes the info to reflect this point. And I hope they make a colonial export version. I'll give more info about this set to the lucky Brits who, of course, will want it, at the end of this review. But what of the colonies?

The good news is that there are Mr. Men cartoons that do play stateside. But they are not this set. Not even this show. They're from a new ""Mr. Men Show"" that ran on Cartoon Network, and which is one of the freshest new 'toons for kids of all ages. It was made by Renegade Animation, and aired as recently as 2011. Darrell Van Citters, Supervising Director, explained that they tried to make something that the great many Mr. Men fans would take to by not changing it too much, and yet bring a fresh take and a bit of an update. In this they brilliantly succeeded. One difference is that in this Brit box set, the cartoons are all titled after Mr. Strong, Little Miss Naughty or some other character. In the Renegade US series, the titles are ""Science"" ""The Fair"" and so on, which enables them to use more of an ensemble of characters. So far, here are the US-playable DVDs, each of which contains six episodes and numerous extras: Mr. Tickle&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mr-Men-Show-Mr-Tickle-Presents-Tickle-Time-Around-Town/dp/B002H6NVP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mr. Men Show - Mr. Tickle Presents: Tickle Time Around Town!</a>; Little Miss Sunshine&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mr-Men-Show-Little-Miss-Sunshine-Presents-Fun-in-the-Sun/dp/B002H6NVOW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mr. Men Show - Little Miss Sunshine Presents: Fun in the Sun!</a>; Mr. Bump&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mr-Men-Show-Mr-Bump-Presents-Planes-Trains-Dillymobiles/dp/B002QT1EWG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mr. Men Show : Mr. Bump Presents: Planes, Trains & Dillymobiles</a>. I greatly hope entire seasons come out on DVD.

But if you're at a pub in the UK, quaffing a delightful Bass, enjoying shepherd's pie, and wondering what DVD to bring back to the flat, as you naturally would be, this might well be your choice. it's a double disc 40th anniversary set of the 28 episodes of Mr. Men which aired in 1974-'75 in the UK, and (on the second disc), 13 episodes of the spin-off, Little Miss. All of which were based on Mr. Tickle, invented by Roger Hargreaves in 1971, and the rapidly expanding cast in ever more books which took the world by storm, appealing to kids of all ages.

To sum, on whichever side of the pond you dwell, Mr. Men and Little Miss DVDs await your discovery. They make great gifts for kids, which, you'll note, gives you also a reason to watch. Not that you need one. Hopefully this set will come out in Region 1 so as to be enjoyed in the US, and the Renegade 'toons make it over to the Mother Country. If that isn't international cooperation, what is?",1310515200,11,3242,5.27906976744186
