8514888,5,B007D3R98I,"I encountered the Brazilian group Jammil and their band at the So Paulo airport, and they presented me with this DVD. Back home I discovered that they are a well-known Ax, popular Latin/light rock group from Bahia. The DVD's first section is an anthology of their music videos, all well-produced, fun, and even charming. The music itself is joyous, cheerful, and foot-tapping rhythmic. The second part is a fine travelogue with a woman guide, and at times with the two musician leads playing acoutstic guitar, of the gold trail from Parati/Paraty on the coast [between Rio de Janeiro and So Paulo] to Cunha and the further old colonial inner cities in the mineral fields of the state of Minas Gerais. I was in Paraty and it was nice to see it and the beautiful coast again in the documentary. Together, this DVD would make a delightful gift for the traveler and for those who want a taste of the spirit of Brazil.",1350345600,,913,4.6419753086419755
