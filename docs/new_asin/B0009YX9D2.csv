8070597,2,B0009YX9D2,"The tag team match between The Dancing Fools(Disco Inferno & Alex Wright) against the team of Jim Neidhart & The British Bulldog was a rather pedestrian tag match with the requisite goofs and timing issues. The Chris Jericho-Fake Goldberg match was a super dud. The Norman Smiley-The Cat match was agony for both the ears and eyes. The Rick Steiner-Scott Steiner match was a pretty good brawl until Buff Bagwell(who was in Scott Steiner's corner) got his neck broken. Don't worry he's okay now. The Cruiserweight title match between Silver King & Juventud Guerrera was not very good but at least they were trying. The Raven's Rules match between Raven & Perry Saturn was not great but still a pretty good hardcore brawl. The Curt Henning-Dean Malenko match was a one-sided nightmare. The Konnan-Scott Hall match was pitiful. The Wargames match between Team Hollywood, Team Wolfpack and Team WCW was pretty good wrestling wise but awful entertainment wise. I give this PPV a 4 out of 10.",1348617600,,986,4.910179640718563
8070598,5,B0009YX9D2,"This is one of the greatest Pay-Per-Views I've ever seen especially for a WCW PPV! The matches are excellent, here's the card:
Disco Inferno and Alex Wright vs. British Bulldog and Jim Neidhart-Good opening match, fair to watch
Jericho vs. Goldberg-I thought it was pretty funny when Goldberg came out, short match no excitement except when Goldberg comes out
Norman Smiley vs. The Cat-Pretty good match, I hate the Cat and Norman Smiley is the man, fair to watch
Scott Steiner vs. Rick Steiner-This is a excellent match until Bagwell gets hurt but I loved wathcing this one
Silver King vs. Juventud Guerrero-OK Match it's fun to see the cruiserweight moves but it is a boring match overall
Raven vs. Saturn-Excellent match, maybe the best on the card, I loved watching it
Curt Henning vs. Dean Malenko-It's an alright match and it's not bad to watch but not great either
Team WCW vs. Team NWO vs. Team Wolfpack-I love this match! The Warrior is great and DDP is the man but it is really entertaining to watch, especially when the Warrior comes out!
Overall-Great Pay-Per-View! Exciting and fun to watch and one of the best WCW PPV's ever! I loved it!",1042588800,3,1151,4.731343283582089
8070599,3,B0009YX9D2,"In my opinion, this is one of the worst Fall Brawls ever made. The main event wasn't very good and the undercard was even worse. One of the reasons the main event was so bad was the finish: DDP giving a Diamond cutter to Stevie Ray. Plus, The Warrior made a less-than-stellar comeback with a one-minute chest pounding and then running off. The best thing about this event was that it set up the main event for 1998's Halloween Havoc: DDP vs. Goldberg for the heavyweight title. That was a great match. This video is not recommended.",1001116800,,532,4.494845360824742
8070600,4,B0009YX9D2,"I don't remember much of this show in Winston-Salem, NC.  But Goldberg and  Sting got into a fight and the ICP was there!  They are awesome!  I think  this PPV's great and wish my video store had it, then I'd rent it all the  time and see if I was on!  Goldberg looked at my sign when he walked off  camera, it said, ""Too Many Fireworks"".  Anyway, if you get this  you can probably here me yelling ICP when everyone else is quiet.  But  forgetting myself, this video really is great!  THIS WAS WHEN WCW WAS  BETTER THAN WWF!!!!!!!!!!",965520000,,533,4.252525252525253
