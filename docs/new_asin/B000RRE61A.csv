""Coonskin"" is film, by the one and only Ralph Bakshi, is reportedly a satirical indictment of blaxploitation films and negative black stereotypes, as well as a look at life black in modern America (modern for the day, I mean--1975). Paramount dropped it like a hot potato that just burst into flame.

But this is a Bakshi film, controversial, thrilling, and a must-see almost by definition alone. Not just another random ""shock-jock"" of a movie which tries to shock for the sake of shock. It's by Ralph Bakshi. Anyone who knows the name knows that if HE made a movie, he has something big to say...

Although it's roots are based in cheap blaxploitation, ""Coonskin"" isn't just another campy knock-off of mainstream white film or any kind of throwaway flick. ""Coonskin"" wants to be more. It aims it's sights higher and fries some much bigger fish.

The movie doesn't just poke fun at the genre. Nor does it just indict black people, but actually seems to show love, beauty and heart in the strangest places.

""Coonskin"" tells a story out of some convicts awaiting a jail-break. The fact that it's even possible to break out of a prison in the ""Coonskin"" world alone makes it old-fashioned.

One of the inmates tells a story about a trio of black brothers in Harlem named Brother Bear, Brother Rabbit, Preacher Fox who want respect and a piece of the action and are willing to get it by any means necessary. The Italian mob is running all the real action.

Big name black musicians star: Barry White and Scatman Crothers, as well as Charles Gordone, the first black playwright to take home the Pulitzer. Something big is happening here obviously.

The movie plays out like a descent into this world, this side of the racial divide. From an angry, hip, deep, soulful black man with a hate in his heart and a gun in his hand.

Bakshi's films never know the meaning of the word ""subtlety."" This one looks like it's never even heard of the word. But maybe a subject like this needs extremism. Real sledgehammer satire. Some subjects can't be tackled gently.

Bakshi is god dammed merciless. Here, no member or minority of the Harlem scene appears unscathed.

The characters here are ""animated"" to ""real"" all depending on what the mood and situation are. The animated characters and the human ones all share the same reality and are meant to be taken just as literally.

Bakshi never just shows ugly caricatures just for shock value. He always has something to say. Nor is blackface is gratuitously. Here, unlike in Spike Lee's ""Bamboozled,"" he seems to be using it to try and really say something.

Like 99.9% of all of Bakshi's films, this one incorporates animation and live-action. Usually at the same time. Bakshki isn't just being gimmicky here. All of this technique is all intertwined, meshing together while saying something.

Somehow, this one feels inevitably dated. Many of these types of films (Bakshi's included) are very topical, very spur of the moment. They reflect the certain trend for the day, but looking back of them years later, there's just an unmistakable feeling of nostalgia (as well as timeless truth).

Even though the music, clothes, slang and the city clearly looks like photos that belong in a time capsule, the attitude, the spirit and the heart remain the same no matter what f--king ear it is. Anyone who's really seen the movies, the state of things and has been in company of the people know what I'm talking about.

Even some of the of the black characters are a bunny (junglebunny), a big ol' bear and a fox. One of the most sour and unsavory racist characters is a dirty Harlem cop who's hot on the trail of these ""[...]"" after the death of a cop. But for him, it's not just business. Nor is it for the rest of the brothers who wear the shield. It's just pure sadistic racist pleasure of hurting blacks.

The sequence involving the Godfather and his lady is one of the most moving pieces in the whole film, of which there are many. It plays out like an opera or a ballet.

The promo line: WARNING: ""This film offends everybody!"" This is not just hype. Proceed with extreme caution.

You have been warned...

8202406,4,B000RRE61A,"Preview For The Ralph Bakshi . com Forums for the upcoming June 2012 release of Coonskin, which marks its first ""official"" release (Note that this is an update of my previous review of the Blax DVD, hence the 2009 post date).

==========================================================================================================
As a few of you on the site may know, doing my part to help get Coonskin released on DVD has been a pet project of mine for quite a while now. At one point, I even had several lengthy conversations with the person at Xenon in charge of releasing, urging him to listen to the fans of the film; all of us here; the many others who had signed the online petition; talked with him about how influential the movie was to so many celebrities, from Wu-Tang Clan to Quentin Tarantino. Things seemed hopeful for the first time in terms of movement toward a release. Then out of the blue I heard that they scrapped the plans. Fast forward several months, Shout Factory had acquired the rights, & it looked like they were moving forward with a release themselves. That one never saw the light of day either, so I thought the project was left for dead. Then something showed up in my mailbox. I won't get into the how I acquired an advanced copy, but let's just say I am stoked.

Without going too much into the movie itself (we can save that for an entirely different review), it is safe to say that ""Coonskin"" has been on my short list of favorite films since I first saw it 23-24 years ago.

Let me first start off by saying that I think it is a bit of a tragedy that the film has never come to DVD in an official capacity (until now that is), & part of me is just happy to have a copy to enjoy that isn't sourced from some 3rd generation VHS tape, like the crappy quality Blax bootleg DVD that has been floating around for the last few years.

This copy definitely comes from a much higher quality source, & as the DVD cover says, it is remastered for High Definition this time around. Don't let this give you an inflated sense of what the final product will look like, as Bakshi intentionally kept things mighty gritty in terms of the visual presentation originally, so things like high grain film still look like high grain film. Personally, I've always been a huge fan of grittiness for art's sake, so it doesn't bother me in the slightest, though some will inevitably complain because it doesn't (& never will) look like a high definition film shot in 2011. I can safely say that the film has never looked better, & in widescreen for the very first time. Colors look nice & vibrant as well, if a little too much on the red side. This was also present on Mr Bakshi's personal film print of Coonskin that I saw last year in Austin, so the source for the DVD may have come from the main man directly.

Xenon almost got the film presentation spot on, though I tend to believe that the original film's aspect ratio should be kept intact. The DVD is presented in 16x9 (or 1.77:1) aspect ratio, as opposed to the original aspect ratio that the film was presented in, which is 1.85:1. It is a slight difference, mind you, & hardly noticeable, but I would have preferred to see the director's original intentions intact.

Sound couldn't be better considering, & the original 2.0 mix is perfect for the lo-fi animated style of the film. Also, I noticed that some of the pops I had been used to hearing in my VHS copy were not present, making for a nice surprise.

The only real place where the release lacks (& sadly in a big way) is the extras department. Nice animated menu has Play & Chapter options, with no extras present, except for an unreferenced trailer for the movie Sweet Sweetback's Badasssss Song. No deleted scenes (which we've seen the German versions of on this site), no trailer, no alternate takes (which we know also exist), no commentary. I would venture to guess that Mr Bakshi had zero involvement with the release (except for maybe the source print) considering the lack of extras. Knowing him, if he had been involved, we'd have an interview at the very least, if not a treasure trove of extras. Being a fan of the film for so long, & after waiting such a ludicrous amount of time for an official release, it is a shame that Xenon did not put in the effort to ensure that it got the royal treatment (keep in mind that the copy I have is a full 5+ months prior to release, so it is possible that there will be extras by the time retail copies are on shelves). If not, who knows, maybe at some point we'll get treated to a deluxe Anniversary Edition blu-ray like Wizards is getting.

Overall Rating: 4/5
Movie: 5/5 (goes without saying)
Presentation: 4/5 (1 point off for incorrect aspect ratio)
Sound: 5/5 (as good as can be considering the source)
Extras: 1/5 (seriously, Xenon?)",1261872000,15,4823,4.529276693455798
