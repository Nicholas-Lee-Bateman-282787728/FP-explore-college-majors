8198981,5,B000R7G63G,This DVD/CD set is great. I loaned my out years ago and forgot who I loaned it too. I had to have another.,1462924800,,106,3.652173913043478
8198982,4,B000R7G63G,"About 10 years ago I reviewed a DVD from Producer Mark Waldrep's AIX record label, featuring string-wizard John McEuen. It featured HD sound and HD video, as well as a feature that let you choose the camera angle. (All this was before the advent of Bluray.)

Though this 47-minute performance video was released in 2005 by AIX, it is now getting wider distribution through Naxos, which is why I just discovered it.

This is a double-sided disc which has high def surround sound on one side (and required a DVD-audio player. The other side is the DVD-video which is what I'm reviewing here.

John McEuen and Jeff Hanna were (and are still) part of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, of which I'm a big fan. Hanna's son Jaime and one of McEuen's two sons, Jonathan - actually first cousins - formed a band called (what else?) Hanna-McEuen in 2005  and only released one album before disbanding. The central band of musicians on the DVD project - recorded at the Colburn School of Performing Arts in California - consists of guitarists McEuen and Phil Salazar plus four of their friends on mandolin, and basses (both acoustic and electric). Along to support them are McEuen's dad, John, and his performing brother, Nathan, plus the aforementioned Jaime Hanna. They take turns soloing and , with the exception of 4 songs, the numbers performed come from the various members of the group. If you liked the NGDB, you'll certainly like this production.

There are bonus features too like Artist Bios, photo gallery and some interviews. When you choose ""Performers"" there is a hyperlink for each one. The one for Jonathan McEuen contains a 1.5 minute interview (not very insightful and recorded in a noisy place), plus a text bio and photos and links to a 7-minute performance at McCabes  (that includes some of the others on the DVD) and a 20 minute performance at another club. There are the only real videos - since if you click on other performers you get the same hyperlink if they were on it. So you basically get 27 minutes of ""bonus performances"". Still a nice addition.

The list of other titles printed in the DVD's insert - there really aren't ""liner notes"" per se - list a solo DVD by Jonathan McEuen. I've seen both he and his brother perform ""showcases"" at the International Folk Alliance (and I've seen ""Papa"" McEuen many times over the years) and so I'm looking forward to discovering that title next.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful

8198983,5,B000R7G63G,"More video than audio, this release has a video side that will be playable on all video players and an dvd audio side that will be playable only on special players. The music is a project that started from Jonathan Mceuen, and who invited his duo team from Hanna-Mceuen fame, and then other players gathered around, including Mceuen's father from The Nitty Gritty Dirt band for this very special and impressive recording.
Guest include Phil Salazar, Tom Corbet, Orest Balaban, Randy Tico and Mark Searcy
This is a string disc, all the players play on string instruments, without any percussion or any wind instrument. There is a banjo, a mandolin and a fiddle, as well as two or three guitar in each track. Most player also sing some leads and all sing.

""She told me she'd be waiting
I'm not so sure she is
I heard that there's another man
Who claims that she is his

The lowlands were my home when I was but a child
They will be my deathbed when I've passed my time""

Sings Mceuen on ""Lowland"" written by Gary Scruggs, and make it a classic country song, with its part of lost love, despair, cheating, and the endless and lost look for love.

Most songs here were written by members of the band but they sound like Hank William classics played by a twenty first century band. The music is highly controlled and at the same time dynamic and convincing. Songs include the most classic themes of country music since its existence: The Mexican border, prairies, open spaces, lost love, trains, travelling, hills and lowlands. Phil Salazar plays in all tracks an incredible violin and when he's plays solo you can believe that the devil went down to Georgia and had a deal with him. World Of Hunger is a specially original and unexpected track, merging klezmer, arabic music and country.

The Hanna-Mceuen duo have released three recordings, this one is the most acoustic of them, the other two are more related to what we call the alt.country americana scene. Only the Self titled cd had a regular distribution two, the other two are dvd-audio/video discs, apparently targeted to the audiophile buyer. It's a real pity that the Brand New Olpry doesn't have a cd release. I must admit that in half of the songs I was sure these were Merle Haggard or Hank Williams songs I had heard a thousand times, only to find that they were written by this team. This is the best country music I have heard in the twentieth century and it's no wonder that in 2005 they had three songs in the country charts. This cd really deserves your attention and the Hanna-Mceuen team, together and separately, are artists to keep a watch on and follow in the future of American music.",1220832000,,2657,4.608879492600423
