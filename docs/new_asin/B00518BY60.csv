8452392,3,B00518BY60,"This is a well done documentary on the Aegean Bronze Age. There are two problems with it: 1. They fail to mention several key theories, like the Thera Theory. 2. Some information ois incorrect. 3. They spend way too much time with Crete and Mycenae and the Cyclades get the short end of the sticks. It's good and has some rare pictures, but is also oversimplistic about Mino/Cycladis/Pelasgian religion. We know far more than they mention in here. Buy Bettany Hugh's The Minotaur's Island, which in itself is flawed, but better than this.",1388448000,,538,4.795698924731183
