8442899,3,B004V4RVJO,"I definitely learned things from the video, but it is a little slow and dated looking. Since buying the DVD, I've seen other videos on YouTube that are equally good and more recent.",1455408000,,181,4.515151515151516
8442900,5,B004V4RVJO,"Go to the skate shop and ask about how to ride, they probably will tell you just practice.  This DVD gives instructions in good easy steps a kid can follow.",1391126400,,156,4.2

8442903,3,B004V4RVJO,"This DVD also is found on you tube under ""Learn to Skateboard"".  The two skaters who produced this very fine video are both very experienced (one is a skating champion), dedicated and excellent teachers (one male, one female). Every possible subject is covered from safety, choosing and assembling a board, equipment, etc.  Really very, very good.

The DVD is divided into 7 chapters, all available free on you tube, plus there is a ""Learn to Skateboard"" website that sells the DVD for $10, but also offers the option to download it for free (though you need a high speed connection).  The authors are so dedicated that they encourage you to download it for free, copy it and give it away.  That's dedication.  Good production values, very competent and well explained and demonstrated.",1341360000,3,786,4.916666666666667
8442904,1,B004V4RVJO,"video is cool.  can't believe it's $2.99 to rent, $2.50 to purchase yet it is a FREE video.  Also, it would be great if Amazon figured out how to separate ratings for the product itself and Amazon's handling of it.",1326758400,,214,4.325
8442905,5,B004V4RVJO,"I saw this on you tube and you can actually watch it on there, but after watching it? I had to have it in my DVD collection. The videos is basically Skateboarding 101. But in my case? Skateboarding for dummies. It breaks down and totally disects skateboarding from the basics. Even the ratings of the wheels and the hardware. If you want to learn how to skate, this is the only dvd you will need. Everything is covered.",1324684800,,419,4.384615384615385
8442906,5,B004V4RVJO,"LEARN TO RIDE A SKATEBOARD  was a GREAT video! It's aimed to teach just about anyone who is getting on a board for the 1st time!  They go into such good detail and take it nice and slow.  I bought this video for my daughter, who just turned 9.  She's been wanting a skateboard for a while... I finally gave in. I have apsolutley NO experiance what so ever!! Sooo I wanted something that would help her along.. teach her the basics, then I came across this video! It taught her everything she needed to know to get started. She even learned a few little tricks!  We both LOVE it!",1303689600,,578,4.218181818181818
