7824052,3,6302315999,"Mediocre/Not Terrible Suspense Yarn has Debbie Harry (fresh from her late 80's ""Def Dumb & Blonde"" incarnation) as a phone-sex operator who hears a murder and tries to solve it. Production standards are decent for a made-for-cable movie of that era.

There is rarely any real suspense, and Debbie appears uncharacteristically pallid and frowsy throughout (you'd think with a face like Debbie's, they'd have bothered to light and style her more carefully),  but for Harry fans, the compensations are that she gets to sing two songs (she's playing a nightclub singer), and as the star, she gets a LOT of screen time. This makes up for a lot of ""Forever Lulus"" (Debbie has made a LOT of movies wherein she gets prominent billing for what amounts to a cameo).

If you're not especially gaga about Ms Harry, then you may find yourself getting fidgety as the plot weebles toward it's predictable conclusion. In the end, there's not much to recommend ""Stranger"" besides Debbie and the novelty of the premise. If you want to see Debbie in peril, a more successful model would be David Cronenberg's ""Videodrome"" (1983) in which she plays kinky radio therapist Nicki Brand, opposite James Woods. She's much more beautiful in that film, which is far more stylish, intriguing and suspenseful than ""Intimate Stranger"", which I can recommend for Blondie completists only.",1516060800,,1357,5.022222222222222
7824053,4,6302315999,"Frustratingly, all the other reviews seem to relate not to Alan Berliner's 1991 documentary, but to the Deborah Harry thriller of the same name.  This seems to happen a lot on Amazon, and can lead to awful confusion.

Intimate Stranger (1991) An interesting character study of the film-maker's maternal grandfather. The man was a stranger not only to his grandson, but even it seems to those who knew him well. A Jewish man from Egypt, he seemed to feel most at home in the world with his Japanese business partners. Comprised almost entirely of old home movies and still photos, with overlaid voice overs of family and friends, it is a portrait an enigma; beloved by his business associates, but resented by his family, who felt ignored and forgotten. Autocratic at home, gregarious while playing at being a diplomat. And maybe even a little crazy. Beautifully made, it gets us deeply involved in the riddle of a total stranger, even if it always stays, like the man, slightly distanced.

Alan Berliner has repeatedly used his own life and family history as fertile grounds for his films.  If you like this, I'd strongly suggest checking out more of his work, particularly ""Nobody's Business"".",1373155200,,1194,4.896039603960396
7824054,3,6302315999,"One of the more frustrating aspects of being a Deborah Harry fan is supporting her acting career. Though she's a decent actress and captivating screen presence, too often one has to suffer through 90 minutes of dreck to catch the two or three wonderful moments Deborah is on screen. For every ""Videodrome"" or ""Hairspray"" in her filmography, there are twice as many wastes of celluloid like ""Drop Dead Rock"" or ""Forever, Lulu."" This made-for-cable thriller isn't a great movie, but it's entertaining solely for Deborah's star turn as a phone sex operator who ""witnesses"" a murder over the phone. The cops, of course, don't believe her. Street cop James Russo overhears her being laughed out of the police station and decides to do some amateur sleuthing in hopes it'll help him get promoted to detective (like I said, not a great movie). It's pretty much a by-the-numbers, mediocre thriller, with Deborah getting stalked by the killer as she tries to discover his identity. Suspense fans will be disappointed, but Deborah Harry fans will be in heaven as they listen to her talk dirty to strangers in her flat, deadpan voice (""My eyes are blue--blue like the California sky,"" she breathes in the same tone of voice used to open the Blondie song ""X-Offender""). Better still, Deborah's character is also a struggling singer, so she gets to sing a couple songs, the best being a forlorn cover of ""Piece of My Heart.""
One other group that'll love this movie: smoking fetishists. There's barely a scene Deborah is in where she's not lighting a cigarette--with matches, never a lighter. Even the opening credits begin with an extreme close up of her bringing a match to the tip of a cigarette. I can't watch this movie without wanting a cigarette myself.",1045008000,6,1746,4.8624161073825505
7824055,5,6302315999,"FOR BLONDIE FANS, ASIDE FROM THE PLOT WICH IS COVERED BY OTHER REVIEWS, IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE SHE PERFORMS ONSTAGE WITH AN UNKNOWN BAND IN A SMOKEY DIVE IN GOTHAM CITY & HER VOICE'S GOLDEN ESSENCE IS STARTLINGLY  CAPTURED. IF FOR NO OTHER REASON, THESE PERFORMANCES ARE WORTH THE PRICE OF  ADMISSION, NOT ON ANY LP'S MIGHT I ADD!",950659200,10,330,4.576271186440678
7824056,3,6302315999,"I FOUND THIS MOVIE HARD TO WATCH AT TIMES BECAUSE OF THE SLIGHTLY CLAUSTROPHOBIC ATMOSPHERE THE FILM HAS. EVEN THE CAST (WHO ARE ALL GOOD ACTORS) SEEM SLIGHTLY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE SCRIPT, MAYBE THATS WHAT THE  DIRECTOR HAD IN MIND. WHAT'S OBVIOUSLY INTENTIONAL IS THAT DEBORAH HARRY  HAS BEEN MADE TO LOOK AS BAD AS POSSIBLE IN JUST ABOUT EVERY SCENE SHE'S IN  (AND SHE'S IN JUST ABOUT ALL OF THEM). SHE OBVIOUSLY DOSENT MIND SHEDING  THE GLAMOUR GIRL IMAGE FOR FILMS. THIS MOVIE WOULD PROBABLY MAKE AN O.K  RENTAL FOR GROWN-UPS",943315200,,531,4.728260869565218
