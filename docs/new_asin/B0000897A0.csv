7980567,3,B0000897A0,"But that was the 1960s not 1997.  ""Asro Boy"" has merit because it was one of the first animes brought to the US from Japan by a US company.  It's a real classic!  I'm writting this because of a mistake in my review for volume 3.

The art is good.  The character design is good.  The girls remind me of the girl designs in ""Betterman"" only more provocative.  The story line is OK.  A bit mundane and unrealistic.  I judge it against the ""Gundum"" sagas and ""Escaflowne"".  Classic mecha animes.

The dubbing stinks.  It's laughable.  There was no effort to sync the voices to the mouth movements of the characters for the most part.  To me it's distracting and ruins the anime.  Of course I may be spoiled by proper ADR engineering and scripting like Lex Lang's fine efforts.

Now for my mistake.  I recomended ""Tokyo Warriors"" to those who like this anime.  It should have been ""10 Tokyo Warriors"".",1195603200,,896,4.49375
7980568,5,B0000897A0,"I love Obari's character designs to death and am generally entertained by his animation, but after volume one I was a bit skeptical about this series.  Volume 1 just seemed kind of dry and at its pace made me feel like any hope for a resolving of issues by the end of volume 3 was doubtful.  And yet a lot of volume one seemed like needless filler.
Volume 2 doesn't exactly answer a great deal of the questions, but the plot flows well, stays on track, and sets a course for a tie-in of answers in a major past event or two.  I REALLY enjoyed this volume after finding the first mediocre and if Volume 3 does a good job, this could really be one of my personal favorite anime series.
Plus, looking back at even the mediocre volume 1 it almost seemed that way due to the introduction of plot elements that look to be coming together.  Everything has a purpose, so if volume 3 ties it together well I can see this title getting future viewings.  Recommended to any Obari fan!",1046563200,,973,4.295081967213115
