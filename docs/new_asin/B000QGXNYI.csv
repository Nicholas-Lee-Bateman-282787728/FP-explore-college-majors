8196477,5,B000QGXNYI,"This is the Susan I remember! Informative, motivational, offering alternatives if you can't do a particular move, easy to understand, great with count-downs and letting you know what was coming next, perfect 'speed' for those not advanced!!! I like how she mixes up the exercises and does not 'kill' your arms or your legs all at once, which can make moving to the next exercise a challenge. Great pace, and great alternatives. She does have some non-conventional 'tips,' like no exercise shoes needed, and drink water if you are thirsty. She basically says you do not 'need' x-amount of water a day. That I slightly disagree with, but obviously as with any exercise video, you may not agree 100% with all the info offered.

But a great solid workout and beginner-friendly with moves that are do-able and you do not have to feel like you are a cheerleader or a dancer to participate.",1444003200,7,883,4.771241830065359

8196482,3,B000QGXNYI,"When Susan reappeared I was so excited, her pink dreads and new energy was catching, soon though she was back to the old Susan cutting her hair to a boy cut and her blogs got to be such a bore, I don't know how many times she blogged about packing and moving, she had had so many great ideas, then  she turned bitter acting, very negative in describing her life and the people who were out to get her, she went for 2 months not blogging on her daily blog, fans were wodering if something may have happened to her, anyway if I heard her say she lost all that weight and never found it again I will scream. She started off with a bang but has fizzeled out, made so many new tapes now no new ones, some reason her heart and energy just isn't in it anymore, just wants to make money,  To bad I used to just sit and listen to her and get excited about loosing weight",1281484800,4,861,4.029239766081871
