8022941,3,B00025X1W2,"I remember this flick when I was a kid and I liked it as much now as I did then. The martial art style(used by our hero) depicted in the film seems to be one suited for in fighting. The kicking style used by the main villian is cleverly choreographed. Although, and obviously, that style of kicking won't be used in real fighting but it is fun to watch. At times the plot/dialogue does drag on and you are just waiting for the next scene just to move the story along. In conclusion, it is a good buy for someone who likes old school kung-fu flicks.",1219708800,,548,4.179245283018868
