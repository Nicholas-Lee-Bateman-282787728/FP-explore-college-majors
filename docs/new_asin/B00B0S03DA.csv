5540530,5,B00B0S03DA,While in Korea I caught this on the local station. I watched it and immediately fell in love. You can't find these types of movies in the US and with the quality of production and acting. This film quickly became one of my favorites and I will be sure to get a copy of this. Its a great film and takes you on an emotional roller coaster. Love the fact that its about friendship and love. What a great film!,1359763200,,406,4.0875
5540531,5,B00B0S03DA,"I have been a long time fan of Korean movies/music/dramas. I recently came across this movie on Netflix. I wasn't expecting much I just wanted to watch something before I went to sleep. Little did I know that throughout the movie I would be laughing my a** off and by the end of it, crying like a baby.

This movie is my new favourite. It's so cute and serious. It pulls you in and makes you love the characters. It's not like any normal movie I've ever seen. It's beautiful and hilarious. I'm definitely buying this one so I can watch it over and over again.

5540532,5,B00B0S03DA,"This transaction was very easy. I had been looking for this dvd set and bought the product right away when I saw it. After I bought it, only a few hours later it had already been shipped. I received the shipment about a week later, and the product was in perfect shape, just like described. I have already finished watching the movie, since it is one of my favorites and can't wait to buy another one. Very happy with the overall product.",1359504000,,438,4.353658536585366
5540533,5,B00B0S03DA,"Have long been a fan of Korean films of various types.  Sunny ranks up there with My Sassy Girl & A Moment To Remember  as a delightful film experience.  Production values are excellent as you would expect from Korea.  The chemistry of the cast & the clever editing between the young girls & the older ones, made this a memorable movie experience.  You will not be disappointed with this film, if you love Korean cinema.",1357171200,,420,4.546666666666667
5540534,5,B00B0S03DA,"I can understand the review by ""Pearls of Wisdom,"" but, as a guy of a certain age, my take on this film was a bit  different.  I have been through so much in my life, lost and gained so much, but I always knew there would be (in the words of another movie) a ""before"" and an ""after"" no matter what happened.  Well, these days my ""before"" is beginning to outweigh my ""after"" with a vengeance.  It seems every morning I get up to the ""after"" getting smaller and smaller, and the ""before"" getting exponentially larger and larger.  In other words, I now carry a very big ""before,"" and with little or limited ""after"" to do something about anything I might still wish (prior to ""getting my ticket punched"") to recapture or to alter about my ""before"".

This seems the stealth message of this movie.  We never know how much time we've got left.  How often I've wanted to embrace and reassure the little boy going through so much in my childhood, to let him know that things will get better.  He went a lot of years alone and not at all sure about whether things would improve.  But he kept trying, and I'd like to let him know that the mature and relatively accomplished (at least pretty much close to as accomplished as he's ever going to get) version of himself would be there years later to successfully fly his banner.

The trajectory of life is brutal, filled with wrong turns, missed opportunities, and aching regrets--and they pile up rapidly on the tail end of life.  The approach to the end is an inherently lonely journey, for one finds him/herself progressively ever more on his/her own as things begin to conclude.  I see the movie as basically about young people struggling to let the good within themselves out, while at the same time they find themselves simultaneously distracted by calls for the worst within themselves.  Will there be time to do it?  We can't all hold out very well against such pressure, but the girls in this movie seem to have stuck together in order to learn to do just that.

We see them as mature women struggling with the struggles of mature women, suddenly thrust into a kind of rerunning the tapes of their youth.  Throughout the movie we find ourselves gaining a surprizingly deeper understanding of the core humanity of nostalgia in this process--something I was not able to permit myself in my youth (for then . . . I felt as if I would live forever).  Do buy the movie and watch it with a generous heart and an open mind that is not overly frightened by the existential anxiety that accompanies anyone undergoing life's trajectory.

Please forgive the schmaltz of this review of this emotionally gripping tear-jerker masquerading as a comedy; but it's the Xmas season, I've got an ill 94 years old mother whose girlhood could easily have fit into the spirit of this movie, and I've experienced too many passings of key persons in my life (as did the ""protagonist"" in this movie).  How I wish there was still time to gather the scattered and disappeared strands of my youth!  That was the gift SUNNY sort of gave its members.",1354406400,8,3064,4.564899451553931
5540535,5,B00B0S03DA,"I recently say the director's cut for this film at the Las Vegas Film Festival .  I went in late and didn't know what to expect, but was immediately drawn in and laughing.  It's the story of a woman runs into an old high school friend and discovers she is dying of cancer.  She then goes about getting to gather the old high school gang of girls called Sunny.  There are flash backs to the thing they did in high school as well as adventures they go on as adults during this quest to reunite the group.  It is the ultimate chick flick and even with sub-sitles you will want to watch it over and over.  I know I can't wait to purchase this item.",1344556800,8,644,4.112
5540536,5,B00B0S03DA,"I've watched this movie a bunch of times on Mnet and decided that I had to own it.  I'm glad that I do. It's one of those that you repeat watch and still enjoy every time.

It's about the friendships and lives of seven young girls as they deal with high school and life as it fast forwards to the future.  if you are fortunate enough to have friends like this  when you were young and/or have when you are older, then you are very fortunate indeed.",1387411200,,448,4.114942528735632
5540537,5,B00B0S03DA,"I had originally seen it on TV with my Mom and we both fell in love with it, it was so hard to find it anywhere else so I was so glad amazon had it and at a great price without any damages!",1382745600,,189,3.4186046511627906
5540538,5,B00B0S03DA,"Friendship is like family to some of us. Life does not always grant us equal and happy pathways. A wonderful (and wonderfully made) film about a group of friends coming together 25 years after a loss...to help one member of the group face a significant and consuming illness. There is, however, no shortage of love and laughter. Don't be embarrassed when you admit to your own friends and aquaintances that you have enjoyed watching this film many times over, as I certainly have!",1382313600,,480,4.795180722891566
5540539,5,B00B0S03DA,"I love the way the director made fun of korean drama cliches (""we are siblings!"").  The story is so heartwarming at the end.",1380672000,5,124,4.391304347826087
5540540,5,B00B0S03DA,"Love it. They captured the details well in the different decades so going back and forth in time was seamless. I haven't laughed so hard in a long time. The swearing was like in the movie my cousin vinny. Normally wouldn't so much swearing but in this case it added to the humor. The grandma, from the 80's, was a riot.",1378771200,,319,4.245901639344262
5540541,5,B00B0S03DA,one of my favorite movies! had to wait a bit for it but it definitely came and now i've watched it everyday since!,1378166400,,114,4.0
5540542,5,B00B0S03DA,The story is so true to what true friendship is. The way the girls found each other when they got older.,1375142400,,104,4.0
5540543,4,B00B0S03DA,"My husband and I enjoyed watching this movie, but we both thought the considerable amount of bad language was unnecessary. Outside of cuss words, the friendship was like a warm blanket. The leader of the group was likeable and admirable, as well as the strength that came out of the main character. The humor in the story was funny and made the movie fun. We both laughed a lot and then cried too, due to the painful situations. I wanted to recommend the story to more people, but the potty language would probably do more harm than good. The violence was inappropriate, but it was fun to see justice done. In my heart, it's a 5 star movie, but professional critics might not agree with me.",1371686400,,690,4.484126984126984
5540544,5,B00B0S03DA,What an excellent ensemble cast.  The casting director did a spectacular job arranging the right young ladies in the teen group as well as the ahjumma group.  The chemistry between the two groups made this an enjoyable and worthwhile movie.  I have personal experience in group dynamics as watching this movie brought back a lot of pleasant as well as sad memories for me. Give yourself two hours and take this time to view this most delightful heartwarming movie.  I will be a fulfilling 2 hours of Sunshine Sunny!!!!,1371427200,,518,4.786516853932584
5540545,5,B00B0S03DA,"A very cool movie whether you are male or female, my friends and I laughed ourselves silly. Touching, funny and easy to follow, a great experience for any adult. Much better than what Hollywood has churned out in the past fifteen years.",1368489600,,236,4.642857142857143

8560407,5,B00B0S03DA,"10/10 AMAZING CONDITION SO FUN AND QUALITY!!

If you've ever seen the movie ""Now and Then"" starring Rosie O'Donnell and Christina Ricci and like a thousand other actresses, this is the same format. Some middle aged women meet up during the present day while the main character reminisces about their past friendship in high school dealing with gangs, school, friendship, overcoming jealousy, and heartbreak.

If you're not a fan of Korean dramas this won't be for you, as the comedy is very based on funny faces and sillier jokes. Also if you've got little ones I recommend not watching this in front of them if they can read, a very important part of certain character traits is that they are fans of swearing (this is usually funny as they try to be creative and learn new swears and use them against an opposing gang to one-up each other), so do keep in mind there is that. Underage drinking (soju is very popular in Korea and two of the characters get drunk and cry about who's prettier) and smoking is also shown several times in the movie. No sex or drugs, so you don't have to worry about that. But there is violence a few times, it's very fake in a few scenes and used for comedic effect, and then another scene has another character lunging at the main character and then cutting another's face (only blood is shown and it's unrealistic but scary)

But I cry every time I watch it because friendship movies do that to me. I love this movie so much, I find the girls so cute and funny! It reminds me of my own time in school.",1455148800,,1533,4.448398576512456
8560408,5,B00B0S03DA,Really amazing. Leaves a lasting emotional impact after all the laughs that may just bring you to tears.,1421193600,,104,4.833333333333333
8560409,5,B00B0S03DA,"This is by far one of the most well written movies I've ever watched. Usually movies that has a lot of flashbacks are headaches for me, but the transitions from the past to the future is smooth and easy to follow. I would recommend this to anyone who likes those quirky  comfy movies with a good storyline.",1415404800,,306,4.368421052631579
