3702347,5,B001MVWM6Q,I love girlfriends and i have pre-ordered this as well. I wish they would just come out with rest of the seasons and stop taking their time. I hope girlfriends get picked up by another station because its great and I love them .I would watch it all day everyday cause they are sooooo real!!!!!!!!,1231977600,,296,4.4
3702348,5,B001MVWM6Q,"Girlfriends - The Complete Sixth Season is another stellar season from my four favorite gals! I believe this is the last season of Toni, sad to see her go she was muchly missed in the last two seasons. Tracee Ellis Ross is such a firecracker! I love her character Joan, holiday-obsessed, wants to be married neurotic. I highly recommend this highly-addictive t.v. show. Enjoy!",1231286400,,376,4.890625
3702349,5,B001MVWM6Q,"I agree with Leon.  I already have the DVD 1-5 Season Episodes.  Can't wait until this Season 6 is delivered. I pre-ordered it.  ""Girlfriends"" was the most underrated T.V. show.  I used to watch it ALL the time. The women used to get themselves into some funny situations.  I used to laugh my a** off until tears rolled down my cheeks.  I was so sorry to see the show cancelled.  What a shame. What a loss.  Between Toni and her materialistic/self-centered/gold-digging self and ""Joan's"" mothering and old-fashioned/Victorian attitude about sex (she was the Ice Queen) and her ""6-day rule"". this show was so hilarious!!!  Thank God for DVDs!  I can now enjoy this show over and over again.  I even adopted Maya's famous line ""Oh, Hay-ell No"" in my everyday conversations when I didn't agree on something someone said (Smile)

3702351,5,B001MVWM6Q,"It's sad how Tonio was so jealous of Joan in this season! She finally got to see what's it's like to need your friend & not have her available to cater to her like she use to! It was good to see Joan finally having fun! I didn't understand why Tonio & Mya didn't get it,Lean was ok with her being the IT GIRL & tried to make Tonio understand but of course Tonio wanted things to be about her! I never liked Tonio she is selfish & self centered,she's the type of person that only cares about herself & thinks everything & everybody revolves around her! I was glad when her character was cut! It really urked me that she acted as though she could never get Maya's son name right for six seasons,really!",1436313600,,700,4.192592592592592

3702360,5,B001MVWM6Q,"I tried to scoop up all of the seasons of Girlfriends because it was one of my favorite sitcoms that embodied sisterly love,support,breakups and forgiveness. These DVDs a just a token of a gone but not forgotten remembrance of a show that many have enjoyed, and can continue to with a new generation of women.",1400976000,,309,4.636363636363637

3702363,3,B001MVWM6Q,"In this season Joans ""J SPOT"" Gets turned around Wayne brady makes numerous and cute guest appereances. the spinn of whic should be used very lightly the gam starts here and bores the life out of you and makes you change the station then you remember your watching a dvd. the main character for the game was the actor who played lynn's brother. the season was very short if it wasn't it sure felt like it there are only 3 discs and the dvd case broke the second time i opned it and i know it wasn't the sellers fault. there have been other cases from this set that have broken. This season feels so short and un interesting that it left me feeling like ""THATS IT""?! I mean really? no nothing? this has alot to do with the production being done while the show was on air. the dvd should be alot cheaper sadly the first 2 dvds are alot better. the story lines maybe slow to get to the point but its just a flat cake. of course there are good things but. i didn't orgasam at the last episode. it was a real big disapointment. when i saw these episode on tv they just show the contuniations the next day. but it really wasn't a big deal. the seasons bad. it started off ok it rekindled some type of light then snuffed it out at the end. this dvd sucks",1382140800,2,1247,4.135802469135802
3702364,5,B001MVWM6Q,I love this it takes me back....I love Girlfriends...I have added it to my collection.  If you loved girlfriends you must get this collection,1374969600,,141,4.875
3702365,4,B001MVWM6Q,"The writing this season took a turn and was definitely heavier on the drama as:

(1) Joan struggles to keep her restaurant afloat - although realistic this dragged on mainly because Joan really had no love interest to allow her multiple stories until near the end of the season;

(2) Toni & Todd's separation, divorce & custody battle;

(3) Maya & Darnell reconcile and remarry but struggle to redefine their marriage;

(4) Lynn begins a relationship with a woman - this was the most ridiculous, drawn-out and uninteresting story line of the season;

(5) William dates a much younger woman - hilarious story line as William tries to change the girl to fit his ""image"".

Disc #3 contains the strongest episodes which detail the breakdown of Joan & Toni's friendship - the saddest episodes are the last two; it also contains a spin-off episode for THE GAME, a new comedy.

Once again we get short changed on features and I wish they had one about the departure of the Toni Childs character (played by Jill Marie Jones).  I was very sad to see her go because although outrageously selfish & narcissistic, I loved Toni.  I know there was probably controversy behind the scenes but the loss of such a strong character should've been addressed in a respectful way for fans of this series.",1347062400,7,1282,4.713004484304933

3702371,4,B001MVWM6Q,Loved GFs until Jill was cut/left the show.  This is her last season and the DVD was amazing.  Joan went from dud to diva to pompus ans self centered. Yes Joan not Toni.  Please see Jill Marie's last performance1,1264550400,6,212,4.384615384615385

3702373,5,B001MVWM6Q,"I love Girlfriends and I'm so excited that I almost have the complete series. I was reading a review from this website that stated the carjacking was included in this season; I was really upset about that until I recieved it and watched it! It is included its on the third disc, but u have to watch all the episodes to get that scene in. If you just choose a episode then it will cut that entire scene out! I just wanted future buyers to know that!!!!!!!!!!!!! Girlfriends is the Best show ever!",1247529600,7,495,4.333333333333333
3702374,4,B001MVWM6Q,"I was so looking forward to watching Toni's last season...but it is very disappointing.  It's obvious why her character was eliminated, not sure whose decision that was but in my opinion the entire show should have been cancelled at this point.  The first five seasons Joan had been relentlessly criticized for not having more fun and for not really dating, she always put her eggs in one basket with some loser; this season she actually is having fun and because Toni has issues and needs her ""friend"", Joan is portrayed as inconsiderate and selfish -- what kind of crap is that?  Maya isn't criticized for enjoying her life, and neither is Lynn...this was not good writing.  Plus Jill Marie Jones' acting is missing something as well, her usual bitchy character takes herself & things much too seriously and gets offended much too quickly in the 6th season.  It is obvious something is wrong with the mechanics that absorbs it on-screen and it goes downhill from here on out.  Do yourself a favor -- do not purchase beyond season five...you'll be very disappointed.",1242604800,5,1067,4.835164835164835
3702375,1,B001MVWM6Q,"Based on the merits of Season One, I bought the remaining five seasons.  That was a BIG mistake.  ""Girlfriends"" followed the same path as ""MASH"".... it went from comedy to drama... but in a shorter time span.  Some episodes were so dramatic that they were absolutely painful to watch.  The characters ""Joan"" and ""Lynn"" are both AWFUL.  Joan is so neurotic and unattractive (i.e. Rosanna Rosanadanna hairdo, BIG eyes and nose) it is not funny.  Lynn is an unfunny, selfish, inconsiderate, lazy parasite who avoids work and grown up responsibilities.  ""Girlfriends"" would have been a much better show if Joan and Lynn were written off in the first season and the show remained a comedy.

This is the last season of the series.  Friends of mine keep saying ""It was a great show!  I don't know why it got cancelled.""  I know why.  It went downhill....steeply.  ""Girlfriends"" became more of a soap opera than a comedy.  Maya, Toni and William are the only funny characters, when there is some humor in a show.

The last episode of season six is real painful to watch.  Nothing amusing about it.

Do yourself a favor and stay clear of seasons 2 through 6.  SEASON ONE IS GREAT!  BUY SEASON ONE!",1241827200,5,1188,4.6521739130434785
3702376,5,B001MVWM6Q,"ok. i LOVE Girlfriends i have all the seasons up to season six.  But this is something i had to share....  i know all dvds are not flawless, and please don't get me wrong this is not a put down or trying to tell people not to buy it, its just a laugh....  In season 6, disc 3 last show,  aprox  02:15:33 into it... Lynn takes the stand in toni's court case.... as she is talking the camera moves into the court room...  then it shoots toni next to her lawyer... PAUSE...  if ypu look behind them, you will see LYNN, maya, and toni's mother.... OK but lynn is on the stand talking...  :)  i know all shows have thier gliches, but it was so funny, i had to rewind it three times to make sure i wasn't crazy!

Anyway, girlfriends is the BEST!!! love it , i wish it would never end!",1240012800,3,778,4.026143790849673
3702377,5,B001MVWM6Q,"I love Girlfriends, it was an absolute great sitcom.  The cast, Tony, Maya, Jone, and Lynn were the perfect picks for this wonderful show.  Season seven, without Tony was not the best, but it was ok and when it comes out, I will definitely buy it to finish off my set.  I found season six to be one of the most interesting seasons, not as funny as season 1-5, but definitely one of the best seasons to watch.  It showed how much the girls had grown.  The custody battle with Tony & Todd, Jone's owning her own restaurant/club, Lynn professional music career, Maya's book and her new home in an upscale neighborhood.  It showed a different side of the girls.  Tony embracing motherhood, Jone trying to fit in, Maya and Darnell making strides, and Lynn, well, Lynn is just Lynn, what can I say.  All in all, a very balanced season and I loved it.  Definitely worth the money.",1239408000,4,873,4.440251572327044
3702378,5,B001MVWM6Q,Wow!!!! Girlfriends is and still will be my favorite tv show. I miss them. Hopefully a reunion will come soon. I'm a fan 4 life. Amazon you guys rock 4 making this available 4 purchase. Keep doing a (five star ***** fantastic job.,1238976000,,230,4.372093023255814

3702380,5,B001MVWM6Q,I love the show and have purchased every season as it has come out I can't wait for the next one to be released.  The show was cut short in season 8 HOWEVER I will still buy it as well when it comes out.,1238371200,,203,3.6136363636363638

Hands down!

I heard season 7 and 8 are okay....but i'm proud of the production of this show. I will invest in all copies. I now own season 1-6 which i watch faithfully. I recommend watching this show from the beginning. Again the writing is brilliant and consistent.",1238198400,,377,4.529411764705882
3702382,3,B001MVWM6Q,"Now I understand why they took it off the air. I loved Girlfriends but this episode wasn't one of the greatest. Season's 1-5 were great but this one well.... it started to get boring and a little corny.

I plan on getting the whole season though because I already own 1 -6 and want to complete the whole set.

All 4 girls made the show, once Toni left it just went down hill from there!!!",1237939200,,388,4.16
3702383,5,B001MVWM6Q,"I was so excited that this season of Girlfriend was finally released. The only problem that I didn't like, is that the episode with Toni being car jacked.

3702384,5,B001MVWM6Q,"I am a die hard girlfreinds fan. So naturally when they took the show off the air i was mad, i mean there are hardly any T.V. shows that are similar to it. Friends and sex and the city have some similarities but it doesn't compare. Girlfriends focuses on 4 african americam women and there triumphs and struggles to make it in today's society. I can relate to that because it's not easy but you do what you must. I watched every episode when it was in syndication and now that it's not i still have the option to watch every episode on DVD. Great DVD, i recommend to any and everyone over 13.",1237766400,,592,4.201754385964913

3702388,5,B001MVWM6Q,"I love this show, own the 6 seasons on DVD. This season never aired in syndication, so I missed seeing this pivotal year in the lives of my girlfriends (and yes, that includes William and Darnell). This show features strong, yet imperfect, multifaceted African American women and men trying to make sense of their lives. Girlfriends never got the respect it deserved precisely because it highlighted its characters humanity, courage, and wit. I miss it terribly. And yes, I love Toni, but the show was just as amazing after her character left, with some of the best story lines and slickest production values in their eight year run. EIGHT YEARS ON THE AIR FOR A BLACK SHOW IS MONUMENTAL! I crave the last two seasons on DVD! Bring on Seasons 7 and 8!",1236297600,,751,4.654135338345864
