7993820,2,B00009WVTG,"Well, somehow I had gotten the idea that this was a documentary about the war against the Taliban in Afghanistan.  Nope.  It was a cheesy B-movie about a soldier who meets up with beautiful journalist and they go off and get into trouble together.
As B-movies go, I supposed this was average.  But when all is said and done, I don't think this movie would even qualify for a spot on Mystery Science Theater 3000.",1067212800,12,412,4.466666666666667
