8057806,3,B00096J1MI,"First of all- the title ""Dancehall"" is misleading- there's some good reggae tracks on here- but MOSTLY ROOTS- not aggressive dancehall.

""Dancehall Riddim Driven"" is poorly mixed- It has a very flat sound- favoring the highs, lacking the bass tones (c'mon it's reggae!!- also the instrument balance is poor (drums are especially poorly mic'ed).  The sound is salvageable thru a good sound system- but dry it's pretty disappointing.

The video is OK- better than older Jamaican releases- but by no means HD- and the color could be bolder.  The ""special features"" are essentially ads for VP records (discographies, fans, history-with 1 repeated Sizzla tune in 5.1- same as from concert).

ARTISTS (2-4 songs each)

1. Morgan Heritage- nice one drop.

2. Marcia Griffiths- bland dated steppers.

3. Tanya Stephens- 1 bland pop- reggae/1 mediocre dancehall.

4. Sanchez-1 OK gospel dancehall/1 one drop.

5. T.O.K- dancehall-BUT toasting over a terribly recorded backing track (very amateurish).

6. Elephant Man- strong dancehall- 2nd song better (great band)- wish there was more.

7. Beres Hammond- pleasant roots- but light .

8. Sizzla-Awesome heavy dancehall- nyabhingi drummer for one song- what the whole dvd SHOULD BE -wish for more ****

Frankly, ""Reggae on the River""has a better mix of dancehall & roots, as well as MUCH better sound and picture!

The DVD features Sanchez, TOK, Marcia Griffiths, Sizzla, Elephant Man, Beres Hammond and others and is a top rate production.  Everything from the menu screens, to the concert chapters, to the extras was first rate for a DVD.  Gone are the days of rough cuts from Jamaican companies putting out less than stellar quality.  VP leaves no ends untied with this production.

The quality of the entire DVD looks close to HD when viewed on a Progressive scan DVD player!!!  It is the best quality concert vid I have seen from ANY record company bar none!!!  My only complaint is that each act only plays 2-4 songs and then they move on but I assume this is because VP had so many acts to get on stage at this concert as they did in Radio City in NY when I went there live...

Go out and get Riddim Driven now!!!  Haile Selassie-I says so!!!  Jah Rastafari!!!",1121644800,,1045,4.280612244897959
