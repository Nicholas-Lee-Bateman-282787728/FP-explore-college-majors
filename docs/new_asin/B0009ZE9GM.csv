2343949,4,B0009ZE9GM,"Its about time an Anime worth my time has come along.  Dumas' classic tale is one of my favorite stories of all time, and I've loved almost every interpretation thus far.  What surprises me is how true to the spirit of the novel this remains despite the sci-fi overtones, and what an effective choice Albert's point of view is within the episodic format.  I know the story already, and still find myself hooked and curious to see how events unfold, which is the hallmark of a great adaptation.

  Unlike the novel, we do not learn the secrets of the Count's early years and relationships first (which leaves only the means of his revenge to satisfy the audience), but are introduced through Albert, making this a coming of age story as well.  In but 4 episodes, layers of secrets are being pulled back and revealations (clear to fans of the story) are hinted at.  This could prove to be a brilliant choice, as it establishes a mystery surrounding the Count himself, which was never present in even the original novel, but removes some of the high adventure by focusing on character drama.  Still, damn fine storytelling, anime or otherwise, and the rescue from the Bandits of Carnivale suggests that there's plenty of satisfaction ahead.

  The visual style is jarring, but works to capture a unique cyberpunk/rococo vibe that slowly feels natural, and does a great deal to hiding and enhancing the limited animation that always comes with genre.  Of course, with the Genre comes shoddy English voiceovers.  After Porco Rosso, and especially STEAMBOY, I think the bar is raised considerably for Enlgish period anime to have appropriate voiceover.

  I'm cautiously optimistic about this one (if it ends well, consider this a 5 star review):  there's a possibility it could go the route of many anime series and become a convoluted mess towards the end, but I have faith in both the Dumas story that has stood the test of time, and the bang up job the director and studio did on this first episodes.  Bring on Vol. 2!",1132963200,4,2016,4.75792507204611
2343950,5,B0009ZE9GM,"I recently rented this title via Netflix, and although I wasn't sure what to expect, I walked away thoroughly pleased with this title, in fact I plan to buy a copy fairly soon, which is somewhat rare for me as I only buy anime that I consider grade-A material.

The visuals of course are amazing, everything is highly surrealistic and there tends to be a slight edge of eeriness to everything that really helps draw you in.

The story and setting, while not as faithful to the original as some may like, is still true to the spirit of the original novel, and in many respects is probably one of the best renditions of the classic novel, at least in recent times.

If I had to find any faults, I would have to say that, occasionally, some computer generated animation being used isn't quite up to par with the more traditional elements.  However, I would consider this to be a nit-pick.

Long story short, this is a darn good recreation of a darn good classic novel.  So unless you're a movie critic, or looking specifically for flaws, I imagine that you'd enjoy this.  However, I wouldn't watch this with your children.  There's nothing too scandalous in it, but there are frightening images as well as a few risqu&eacute; scenes.  Combine that with the complex plot and the subject matter, and most young children are likely to be overwhelmed.",1131494400,5,1344,4.61344537815126
2343951,5,B0009ZE9GM,"I'm a lover of the Count of Monte Cristo. It still tops my list as one of the world's most important works of fiction, and many I think would agree with me.

So when I found out that Gonzo has remade the Dumas classic, I felt a cringe run up my spine. Never has there been an anime based off of a classical work of literature such as this, or at least I have yet to see one. I felt I was forced as a fan of the original to be skeptical of the anime version.

I was wrong, and I realized this very quickly. Not from actually seeing the anime itself, but from seeing Samurai 7, which is also a remake of a classical work of entertainment (Seven Samurai by Akira Kurisawa). Gonzo spun its own magic with the samurai remake, one that doesn't attempt to mimic Seven Samurai but to add a new vision to the classic. I figured from Samurai 7's example that Gankutsuou would likewise add a new vision to the Dumas classic.

Here, I was right. After watching the first episode, it was clear that Gonzo had in no way attempted to remake The Count of Monte Cristo, but instead went for a different interpretation of it. It turned out magical, in the end. The style of story-telling, while certainly jarring at the beginning, is unique in that it doesn't exactly follow the Count but one of the supporting characters who observes from the outside the Count's quest, and who suffers through his own conflicts. It also starts somewhere near the middle of the Count's journey, after he attains his status. The setting is futuristic, with the first episode based on a Las Vegas-style moon and eventually moving to a futuristic Paris later on (though I haven't yet got there in my viewing). The animation style, which is hard to describe, follows its own rules and fits in well with the setting and story. It adds a lot to the atmosphere, as well.

I'd recommend this to all Gonzo fans, as it will, I think, turn out to be one of the best to come from the studio. I would also recommend this to fans of the Dumas classic open to new things. It may at first seem a bit much but as the story progresses you'll sink into it quickly. This is Gonzo's magical interpretation of a classic.",1131408000,30,2164,4.349009900990099
2343952,5,B0009ZE9GM,"Gankutsuou -The Count of Monte Cristo, is a revolutionary anime in it style and scope.  For the most part, Gankutsuou features no solid colors.  What fills the space between the lines in this show are layers upon layers of textures and fabric samples.  All of which are digitally overlapped and interwoven to create one one of the most interesting kaleidoscopes ever.  And having spread the story over the vastness of space verse the usual France and mediterranean has opened and universe of possibilities for where the show can take you.  Welcome to the future.",1130803200,,562,4.9361702127659575
2343953,5,B0009ZE9GM,"Wow. This anime just blew me away (I was captivated from the very first episode) and now is one of my all-time favorites. This anime really goes all out visually, combining patterned overlays and 3d imagry to create a rich visual atmosphere that is gripping. The 'moving patterns' may be a little much for some people the first episode, but after that it becomes really easy to flow in the wonderful world created here and watch it entirely undistracted. It is really fun to see the way the period style is meshed with a sci-fi environment. Immense detail has gone into every scene to maintain high-quality animation.

Having watched the entire series I can say the storyline is supurb and not at all lacking. It veers dramatically from Dumas' original plot, but not to any detriment. It is the Count of Monte Cristo re-invisioned, told from the point of view of Albert. There is a higher focus on the younger characters, and each of these is treated with care to create a depth and emotion. Director Mahiro Maeda really flushes out characters like Franz and Euginie who don't play such a large roll in the original. I loved the novel; and then the anime made me love the characters all the more.

This is a thrilling drama with lots of romance and scandal thrown in which will leave you eagerly awaiting each new volume.",1128384000,8,1321,4.641025641025641
2343954,5,B0009ZE9GM,"Gankutsuou should be allowed to stand on its own merits. Comparing it to the classic novel from which it draws its characters and much of its plot robs a viewer of the innovative, unique, and emotionally charged experience this series offers. The Count is no longer the main character in this retelling. Focus shifts to young Albert and his relationship with his best friend Franz, his betrothed Eugenie, his parents, and the Count himself. The Count is not the hero (nor the antihero). Albert is our hero. The Count becomes a sexy, dangerous, sympathetic villain forcing Albert to grow up and fix his father's mistakes.

It is a brilliant, tragic, occasionally melodramatic tale that stands the best chance of pleasing fans of character driven dramas. There is nothing light-hearted about this series. The plot drives on, darkening at each twist, until you stand with Albert near the end, sharing his desolation.

In addition to a lush, operatic soundtrack and the groundbreaking visuals, Gankutsuou has much to offer to yaoi fans. Though much of the main male characters' intimate interactions can be explained away as French foppishness, there is an important subplot involving Franz' romantic feelings for his best friend. This combined with Albert's infatuation with the Count and his intended make for a heartbreaking love quadrangle that may just have you rivetted.

I can't recommend Gankutsuou more to lovers of lush design and dark tragedies. It's a truly unique work of art.",1127606400,8,1485,5.128099173553719
2343959,5,B0009ZE9GM,"This anime is simply gorgeous. The storyline is no mystery, as it follows the Counte of Monte Cristo, but its amazingly done. Youre not expecting it at first, so visually it comes as an immediate assault to the eyes, but give it just a little bit, trust me, and it flows! Beautiful, and pulls at your heartstrings!.",1169769600,,315,4.543859649122807
2343960,5,B0009ZE9GM,"When I first discovered this series, I'd seen it on a shelf in a DVD store and immidiately judged it pretentious and boring, leaving it sit on the shelf to collect dust.

A short time later my younger brother bought the first disc and raved about it. I expected to be let down by bad dialog, poor animation, and and rediculously rehashed story that no one would be surprised by.

The term ""Don't judge a book by it's cover"" comes to mind.

First off the art style of the series uses a paletting technique rather than traditional paint texturing on things like clothing, hair, and backrounds. Thus the texture will remain in place even as the object moves. While it's visually jarring at first, the eye quickly becomes used to the effect, and it lends itself quite nicely to adding to the detail of the various settings and backdrops of the various environments.

The majority of the characters are supposed to be high society, wealthy individuals so when this effect is used on clothing and hair, I think it helps to give the impression of extravagant wealth and eccentricity.

The soundtrack was very very well thought out. It makes use of theme and variation. Some of the key moments in the story are made that much more tense by a simple chiming tune building to a crashing cresendo. Considering that both the opening and closing themes are in english, one can appreciate the attempt in emulating western musical styles for a western story. All in all the opening and closing themes are not overplayed at all, with the opening theme used only briefly to symbolize a bond between characters.

The use of CGI throughout the film was also put to creative use and despite how others may feel, I don't believe it was over used or cheesy at all. Starships and location backrounds make up the majority of the cgi effects of the series, but the most obvious use was the mech duels.

Yes, I said Mechs. There are two scenes where duels are fought in cgi mech suits. When this was initially a corny idea to me, I quickly appreciated how much attention was given to those scenes. The formalites of a traditional european duel are presented in much more detail than I've seen in any other anime (or animation -period.) as well, as the fencing stances and styles. The joint movement of the cgi seems awkward at first, with elbows and wrists of the mechs seeming herky-jerky when in movement. But I quickly realized that this was done on purpose to show the need for expertise in piloting, as well as giving the impression that this armor was built during a futuristic renaissance.

The dialog is well enough written. They did put effort into trying for a more victorian era dialog style, but it mixes only so well with the futuristic backdrop.

The mediocre dialog however is made up by some spectacular voice acting in the dubbed version. (Although, there are a couple of points that I think the Voice Director left the studio. It's pronounced ""Mar-key"" not ""Mar-quiz"".)

Outside of a few pronounciation hiccups here and there the voice acting is excellent

The story. No Gonzo did not stick to the traditional Dumas tale of the Count of Monte Cristo, as the story is told mostly from Albert's view point. While many may not initially like this idea, (Albert was a fairly minor character from the book) the character's personality differs somewhat from the Albert in the book. However, none of the characters, with the exception of perhaps Albert, play intrisically different roles from those they play in the book. While situations play out with similar end results, the overall plot manages to be intense, stimulating, and once in a while will throw you the plot-line curveball that will raise your eyebrows.

Admittedly, the story moves slower at the beginning, but as the plot takes some unexpected twists and the situation becomes more and more tense, the story telling draws you in and any complaints that you might have had die off.

By the end of the series, you won't be able to put each DVD in your player fast enough.

Make no mistake; this is NOT a direct from the book translation. This is an interpretation. This is not like the kind of bastardization that Disney does to classic tales like The Hunchback of Notre Dame. It's a new and fresh vision on an old and rehashed story.

It's worth every dime spent on it.",1168041600,8,4318,4.670619235836627
2343961,5,B0009ZE9GM,"Whether you are a huge anime fan or not, this story will draw you in and capture your interest. Very well done and the artwork is really amazing. You really should add this to your anime collection.",1163980800,,198,4.378378378378378
2343962,5,B0009ZE9GM,"I first learned of this anime series from articles I read in anime magazines. I love the work of 19th century novelist Alexander Dumas, I love anime and the artwork and character designs in the articles made the combination of the two look intriguing.  But little did I know how remarkable the actual series would turn out to be! Mahiro Maeda's Gankutsuou is an anime TV series unlike any I've seen before and in its totality, I consider it a modern classic of the genre.  Combining the latest advancements in computer animation techniques with traditional hand-drawn animation, Mr. Maeda has created a totally new canvass for the eyes and imagination to savor. The images in this anime are quite a departure from the CGI animated films of recent years, made most popular by the American Pixar studio movies like Toy Story, The Incredibles and Cars.  They are rich in detail and initially almost overwhelming in their vibrancy but their artistry and the story they encompass quickly enthrall you.

Gankutsuou re-envisions Mr. Dumas' classic story of betrayal, lost love and vengeance in a futuristic setting, told from the point of view of young French aristocrat Albert de Morcerf, who meets the mysterious Count while vacationing on Earth's moon, Luna, with his best friend, Franz d Epinay.  Their encounter sets up a chain of events that shakes Albert's world and the society of Paris to its very foundations.  At the center of this upheaval is the Count of Monte Cristo, a charismatic figure of immense wealth and resources but who also comes to Paris with an unknown agenda.  As this secret plan is slowly revealed to Albert over the course of the series, Gankutsuou becomes not just the story of the Count's obsession but also how Albert changes from a naive and impressionable young man forever.

Mr. Maeda's animated version of the Count is surprisingly faithful to how the characters in Mr. Dumas' novel are first taken with the distinctive look of the Count: to Albert's friend, Franz's view,...""if anything was likely to induce a belief in the existence of vampires, it would be the presence of such a man as the mysterious personage before him.""  A beautiful Venetian Countess, an acquaintance of Franz's (featured in the first episode of the series), went on to describe him further: ""Oh!  It is the exact personification I was led to expect.  The coal-black hair, large bright glittering eyes, in which a wild, unearthly fire seems burning--the same ghastly paleness (a faded blue complexion in the anime)."" The Count of Gankutsuou is a most striking figure.

From a storytelling perspective, Gankutsuou succeeds in giving the classic tale of The Count of Monte Cristo a new sense of drama by changing the story's focus from the Count's to that of Albert, a character innocent of the dark past that this mysterious newcomer to Paris shares with some of the most powerful members of the city's elite, including Albert's parents.  This change in point of view adds to the Count's already impressive personae, making him more alluring...and more dangerous.  To someone like myself, who is familiar with Mr. Dumas' novel, Gankutsuou's alternate perspective brings new life into a story more than a century old in its enduring appeal.

Just as Mr. Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo remains a triumph of romantic adventure since its publication in France in 1844-1845, Mr. Maeda's Gankutsuou is a triumph of Japanese animation.  It is a worthy companion piece to its classic inspiration.",1159747200,4,3494,4.97766323024055
2343963,5,B0009ZE9GM,"After reading the poor Amazon Editorial review I just had to write something to do this beautifully done anime justice.  The way they did the animation in this will take some a moment to adjust to but it is truly stunning.  Nothing is bland, all the outfits the characters wear, the sky, even the wallpaper is fun to look at, a feast for the eyes.

The story is very good, it uses the classic Count of Monte Cristo as an outline but has several aspects that make it original in its own right.  I won't go into the details but it's wonderfully played out although there are a couple episodes where it feels like it drags but everything is building up to the last few episodes in which everything comes together (or falls apart ;)).  The main characters are well developed throughout the series so you feel a certain attachment to most of them.

The only thing I wasn't too big on in this series is the music. The closing credits song is about the only memorable piece in the series.  The music isn't bad but nothing really stands out.",1155081600,3,1033,4.405263157894737
2343964,2,B0009ZE9GM,"Albert is a French aristocrat visiting the moon city of Luna during Carnival which is much the same as the festival here on Earth, where revelry-goers give themselves up to every form of debauchery they can think of. Albert is accompanied by his best friend (ardent lover?) Franz and some other young playboys making the rounds of the city's nightlife. While attending an opera Albert first encounters the mysterious Count of Monte Cristo, a blue-skinned long haired demon eared vampire looking humanoid. While some of the rich think the Count is a con man, Albert sees something very attractive about this mysterious figure and wants to get to know him better. Albert will find that the Count likes to play God with human lives, but cannot believe that even he is being toyed with in a secret plot of revenge by the Count.

The first thing that strikes you about this series is the visual style. The characters clothes have patterns imposed upon them instead of being colored which distracts your eye instead of impressing them. You find yourself following their clothes instead of the faces, which is very annoying. Even their hair is a tangle of cg animation shading that makes the show look like it's working too hard for the wrong reasons. I mean, while Gankutsuou can by visually daring, it forgets about pace and character and rising action. Volume 1 deals mainly with the Count insinuating himself into Albert's life and uncomfortably trespassing into the world of the French aristocracy. The homoerotic overtones of the show are unneccesary and should have been reserved for a yaoi anime, and again draws attention to all the wrong aspects of storytelling. In the end, Volume 1 tries to hard to seem different with its visual elements like clothes and hair and thereby sacrifices more important elements.",1153872000,,1813,4.92483660130719

I've never read the book nor heard of the story before, so I did not know what I was actually buying till I watched the show. I have seen a good many, animes before. I'M A HUGE ANIME FAN-however- this anime is one of the best I have ever viewed. True, the animations CG effects are a little odd at first glance, but they fit so well with the futuristic view of the story.  The different patterns, coloring, and texturizing really make the story come alive.  I personally love to draw and have a deep respect for art- so if you're like that too- you'll love this story.  Speaking of, the storyline is very interesting, and it keeps you wanting more episode after episode.  I almost can't wait for volume 3, since I already have 2.  The Count himself is very mysterious, you find yourself wanting to know so much more about him, and his hidden past.  But that's another thing that makes this anime so amazing- almost addictive.  On top of this, it's done by GONZO!!  This Studio Is Unbelievable!!  They always do a great job and this time is no different. This series as a whole is excellent.  A must-have for anyone who likes classic stories, but aren't afraid of a little extra added mix to it.

Well, I am glad I gave it another try. After the first show I was drawn into the story line and the Art started to take hold. The plot and sub plots start to grow. I will not say what happens in it. That takes the fun out of the show. If you like good art, vampires(not sure if they exist in this show!), Culture, and a plot that starts to suck all your attention and you beg for more.

8070775,5,B0009ZE9GM,"Wow. First word said after playing the last episode of this series.
It was near flawless of an anime. Usually a heart of stone I have.
Have to admit, I cried towards the end. Anyway.

First and foremost. What you actually see before the anime, the art box.
Its a great box, has metallic effects on some parts. The DVDs fit nicely.
Certainly worth buying.

Now the anime. Look at my first paragraph for emphasis. Everything about
the series was top notch. The story, the characters, the artwork, the voice
acting in English (Perfect if you ask me). Excellent soundtrack. Only small
con, easily overlooked by the end. Is that, the middle portion of the anime
is a little dry. But the characters keep you going. The last 3 disks felt
like one movie cause I did not want to put it down.

Conclusion. Buy it, you will then know what a real anime is. It doesn't follow
any common trend that you see in a lot of today's anime for popularity. It
strictly uses characters, story, unique art style (trust me, its unique)
and music to truly entertain you. Give it a shot, you will not regret it.

8070776,4,B0009ZE9GM,"After reading voluminous original novel by Alexandre Dumas I was convinced, that if you make the dramatization of Dumas' novel work better particularly for TV drama one successful formula might be to let Albert play the lead role and the count being viewed as a mysterious figure. This animation just did what I had been dreaming and focused more on vengence latter part, which took the similar course with 1998 French TV drama starring Gerald Depardieu. The first volume contains the episode 1-4, which starts from the Albert's encounter with Counte of Monte Cristo at the entertainment outpost at Moon colony called Luna. Monte Cristo in this drama is very vampire-like and the drama setting itself is attired with sci-fi which might fit the taste of modern young adults. The animation style is also very unique. Fabric-patterned animation style may give the viewers a bit of surrealistic feeling which can make them forgive otherwise absurd story plots. And what I like most is Monte Cristo drama has been given full time with a number of unique characters  unscathed. So far I have seen up to episode #8 of the drama but I cannot wait to see the rest of the episodes.

Verdict: Futuristic, vampire tasted adaptation.

8070778,5,B0009ZE9GM,"Gankutsuou is based off of the classic ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" by Alexandre Dumas. In this beautifully drawn and portrayed version of the timeless classic, we see the exciting tale of the Count unfold with a futuristic twist. Set in the distant future, the Count returns once again to seek his revenge.
What really sets this anime apart from others is the way the plot is exposed. It's so thick and twisted that you can't help but be sucked into it. Also, though the anime stays true to the basic plot of the book, Gankutsuou has it's own twists and unique story line that will captivate anime fans and readers all over again. Accompanied by stunning scenery, gorgeous artistry, and a slew of intriguing characters, Gankutsuou will thrill you like no other anime you've ever seen.
Whether you're new to the timeless literary classic or a returning fanatic like myself, Gankutsuou is an anime you can't afford to pass up!!

8070779,5,B0009ZE9GM,"After having watched all of the episodes I can say that I am very glad I stuck past the first few episodes. The story becomes really interesting once the revenge sets in, you get a much better feel of all of the characters. There are only a few people who I could hate or love all the way through, they do a good job of showing everyone as human, with their own feelings and reason. One thing I like (which is a problem in some titles) is that the story never feels rushed, it really works well and ends smoothly.

The art style is amazing and is more than just eye candy. They use an interesting style of prints for hair, clothes, and backgrounds. This not only goes to accentuate the characters as people but also shows you their class and importance. When you see a poor part of town there is nothing but watercolor, everyone is dull and flat, when you see Paris or Luna and the people there- everything is popping, sparkeling, extravagant.",1183420800,,943,4.388571428571429
8070780,5,B0009ZE9GM,"First, let me say that the unusual style of the series is at first a little off-putting. Once you fall into the story, however, you don't notice that style as much, and that's really how it SHOULD be - unusual style can't hold my attention for long.

It's Count of Monte Cristo in space, (mostly) from Albert's perspective. We get to experience the Count's revenge through Albert, which adds a bit more suspense, I think. I'd never read the book, but was, like most people, familiar with the story.

The Good: The story, characters and animation are all top drawer. The Count's character design is very attractive, too. I came to care about the characters and feel sorry for them during their inevitable downward spiral, through their poor choices. What's especially good is that the story doesn't ""dumb it down"" and spell out certain things (such as a character's love for another), but leaves the viewer to decide.

Plus, the climax is one of the best I've ever seen.

The Bad: There is some CG work here which isn't very good at all (robots fighting), and could have been done without. But it's a minor quibble.

The Ugly: None!

NOTE: This is NOT a series for kids. There are issues of sexuality, death, sacrifice, brutal betrayal and a little incest. It's a very adult theme, but very enjoyable.

Also, the box for this first volume is really lovely. It's kind of shiny with golden touches and looks really nice on the shelf!

Mahiro Maeda has managed to recreate a classic tale, using a medium never tried before, and pull it off seamlessly. The style of animation is nothing short of breathtaking; there are times when you're so engrossed in the grandeur of it all that you're able to reach that Zen like level that all cinematography strives for, and you find that you've become completely lost in the film. There's even a small feeling of loss when each episode ends, leaving you slightly short of breath.

One caveat: I didn't watch the English version, so I can't really comment on how well it was dubbed. Because this series was so dialogue heavy, the subtitles were distracting at times, but if the dubbing is up to par, I won't hesitate to watch it all over again, because I'm sure that I missed out on a quite a bit by having to read my way through.

The Bottom Line: Not to be missed, even if you're not an anime fan. This is truly deserving of all 5 stars.",1175212800,,1158,4.273972602739726
8070782,4,B0009ZE9GM,"I am a huge fan of Dumas and The Count of Monte Cristo in particular. I also like many different movie genres. As such, this set worked for me. I would caution purists, however, to start slowly as this set is not for everyone.

The series is told from Albert's point of view. It's set in the future. It begins in the middle of the book. And, it does have some homoerotic overtones (Albert and his best friend, Franz d'Epinay). That said, I thought the adaptation stuck fairly close to the actual plot of Dumas' work...more in keeping with the Depardieu French version of the film than the Chamberlain version of the early 70s or the remake with Caveziel (both great in their own right.)

The only thing that was jarring for me was the depiction of the Count. He's drawn as a vampire (in anime, this means blue skin). He has vampiric teeth and is a very remote and cold figure (readers of the book will recall that Dumas' description is almost vampiric...perhaps influenced by Stoker.) So, while the depiction was on point with the original work, it was odd to see. This, because I have been conditioned to expect handsome men in the title role, not ""vampiric"" actors!

I think fans of the book should try this version if they are adventurous and open to different artistic forms and visions. Start, however, with the first DVD/VHS tape and see how you feel before continuing.

Anime fans w/an interest in classic literature (although some argue the point when it comes to Dumas) may well be pleased and find themselves interested in returning to the source material.

If the novel is taught to students over the age of 15 or 16, I think this version could be shown (along with the Caveziel or Chamberlain versions), in order to provide the students with an opportunity to compare/contrast the material.
