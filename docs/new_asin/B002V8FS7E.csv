It's a South Korean film half filmed there and in the US and the acting is quite good.

 Jung Yu-Mi is so adorably cute in her role as the eager college student trying to research large boars. 'Chaw' (pronounced ciao, means trap in South Korean) is some sort of mutant boar terrorising a local village. It goes for about 2 hours and I watched it over the course of two nights and really it doesn't seem to drag too much, it's witty and tongue in cheek without being ridiculous and pays respect to the creature feature genre. These movies are notorious for horrendously dodgy looking creatures but even the boar looks and moves realistically, for the most part.

 I laughed out loud when right at the end when the camera pans away the serious straight cop pulls his jacket up so you can see the outline of his ass in skin tight brown leggings. A perfect example of the spirit Chaw was made in.",1463702400,,1129,4.4396135265700485
