8335980,3,B001QLCDCU,"This has three movies in it, so some would consider this a lot of bang for your buck.  A lot of these films reminded me of John Waters' oeuvre.  If you liked ""Pink Flamingoes,"" then you may really love this.  Many low-budget flicks are short in time length, but at least two of the three flicks are 90 minutes.  I became attracted to Sonny Landham due to his sexy sacrifice scene in ""Predator.""  Here's the thing:  SONNY LANDHAM IS NOT NUDE HERE!  Don't view this if you think you'll see his whole body like you do in his hardcore blue-movie work.  Still, in so many of Landham's acting jobs, he plays violent characters who die.  Here, he plays a rich guy and the character does not meet a tragic ending.  Too often, sex comedies only show female nudity.  That is the focus, but there is some male nudity here.  In fact, it's frontal male nudity.  Here's something hilarious: THE ONLY COPY OF ""THE SWITCH"" THEY COULD FIND WAS ONE WITH SWEDISH SUBTITLES!!!!  LOL!  My guess is that few of us Americans can read Swedish.  If you hate seeing subtitles of languages that you don't speak, then you'll want to avoid it.  However, I didn't find it distracting.  In fact, I heard the English language has some Swedish influence and you could see it in some of their words.
This may be a timely work as well as actor Harry Reems died a few weeks ago.  RIP, HARRY REEMS!",1365465600,8,1361,4.415322580645161
