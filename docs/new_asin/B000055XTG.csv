1394334,5,B000055XTG,"Tremendo concierto!!, se lo recomiendo totalmente, canciones bien arrechas donde se confirma una vez ms que RATM es la mejor banda de Rock. Excelente material con el Ejercito Zapatista de Liberacion Nacional y reportajes adicionales.
Rage Against The Machine are the best rock band....",984528000,2,285,5.5
1394335,4,B000055XTG,"Will Rage Against the Machine (RATM) go down in history as one of the greatest live acts ever? Only time will tell, but this DVD is testimony that they are serious contenders.  And with recent news that lead singer Zack de la Rocha will be leaving the band, this may be the final testament of RATM at their peak.
The energy is nuclear in this concert.  RATM does not hold back and the crowd is bursting at the seams of the enormous venue.  Especially in the popular ""Bulls on Parade"", the roar from the crowd will send chills down your spine.  You have not heard RATM until you have heard them live, but playing this DVD on a high quality sound system comes close.
Chances are, if you are reading this, you are already a fan.  If you are not already a fan, this DVD is an excellent introduction to the Rage phenomena.  Here, you can truly appreciate RATM as the speaker for an entire generation of angst.
There are two quirks to this DVD that may bother some viewers.  First, snippets of political documentary are spliced in between songs of the concert footage.  In these snippets, Zack describes his leftist political views in an abbreviated documentary-style format and one understands better the source of his piercing anger.  If you are a strong-minded right-wing politician, you will hate this DVD even more than their studio albums.  The inverse is true for left-wingers.
Second, there are two audio tracks that each have a shortcoming.  In the high-quality 2-channel audio track, the energy of the crowd is very much evident, but the ""F***"" words are muted.  In the lower-quality but enveloping 5-channel Dolby Digital track, no lyrics are muted, but the crowd noise is almost completely absent.",983750400,20,1703,4.735593220338983
1394336,4,B000055XTG,"three things keep this dvd from earning 5 stars.  thing number one:  censorship.  rage is highly against censorship of any kind, so i find it very ironic that many of the swear words are cut from the dvd.  while only slightly annoying, it does take away some from the performance.  thing number two:  the propaganda documentary.  while i enjoyed these, i found it annoying that they were interspersed throughout the concert.  i would have preferred to be able to watch these separately and be able to watch the concert as a whole without the documentary pieces.  i also got the feeling that some songs may have been cut out, but i have no way of knowing for sure.  thing number three:  the dvd seems to be rather rushed together.  while the editing and the picture quality were very good, the packaging is lacking.  there is no real track listing anywhere.  there is a song list on the back cover, but this does not include the documentary footage so you don't know what track number is what song without going to the menu and looking.  also there is no insert in the case.  while this is a very good quality dvd, i would have liked to see some extras.",983577600,10,1152,4.466346153846154
1394337,5,B000055XTG,"This was definetly the best concert I have ever been. Rage rules, and if you like rage, you need to watch this concert. The crowd was very crazy, and rage played excellent Buy the DVD, it is excellent.........",983404800,2,209,4.526315789473684
1394338,4,B000055XTG,"I have only seen Rage live once (Lollapalooza 93) and apparently that was all I was intended to see of this explosive act seeing as every time I had tickets for another gig it was cancelled (93 club tour and the Rhyme and Reason tour).  That makes these shows on DVD all the more essential for those of you who never got to see Rage live.
Before Lollapalooza I had never heard of them.  The day after I bought the CD and wore it out.  Never has a band put out such solid albums as Rage, each one diverse but focused, pounding their political message into your head with every heavy beat and power chord.
This DVD (most of which aired on MTV after the release of 'The Battle of Los Angeles') encapsulates the live Rage experience but ultimately forshadows the demise of this great band.  At points Zack seems tired and listless, simply saying the lyrics instead of screaming them like the demon-poet of the past.  And the unfortunate addition of some hokey video effects (slow motion, delay) really reminds you that this is video and not just a straight live performance.
Those points aside - The Battle of Mexico City is a strong performance from an amazing band.  Tom Morello and Timmy C thrash through each song with reckless abandon, sweat spilling from every pour from start to finish.  And the addition of the documentary footage on the Zapatistas narrated by Zack is important in keeping with Rage's committment to the underdog and overall very interesting and informative.
We can only hope that Rage continues to release DVD's of old shows (particularly the Democratic Convention show) so that new fans and old can see what this band was all about live.
I don't think they will be the same (live) with another lead singer.  This marks the end of an era.",983318400,,1760,4.600638977635783
1394339,5,B000055XTG,"Great rock concert, captured very well.  Except for a few cheesy slow-motion effect edits, this DVD is fantastic.  Sound is very good, (crank it up), just enough crowd shots to give the feeling of being there, closeups of the band are intense, and their playing is solid.  This is one of the best rock concerts I've seen on DVD yet.",983145600,,332,4.5
1394340,5,B000055XTG,"If you've never been to a rage concert, you can finally see what it's like with Battle Of Mexico City. This concert simply rocks. Turn up your sound system, get in front of the tv and start moshing in your living room when rage rips through there awesome playlist. They deliver each song with unmatched power, matching that of this insane Mexico City crowd. The qaulity of the dvd is great,from the picture quality, sound and presentation of it. If your a Rage fan, undoubtedly you'll be getting this soon, and if your not, then jump into what is the raw power and energy of a Rage Against The Machine concert.",982886400,4,610,4.504504504504505
1394341,5,B000055XTG,"let me preface this review by saying that i am 21 years old and a fanatic of ALL forms of music. unfourtunatley my generation has produced very few music artists of any signifigance, in any genre of music. the small amount of truly talented artist in this day and age rarley have any new ideas or anything meaningfull to say.... That is not the case with Rage Against The Machine. They rank very high on my list of the great music acts of all time. And that is what is so unfortunate about the departure of front man zach de la roche.  But you can still see RATM at the pinnacle of there careers in this DVD. I personaly feel privlidged to live in a society where one of the greatest live bands of all time can capture what is proboly their greatest live preformance on on a media such as DVD.  We don't have a DVD video of the Doors at the wiskey-a-go-go, or of billie holiday in the clubs od harlem, or of robert johnson in the whiskey shacks on plantaions of the deep south, but we do have RATM live in mexico city. I would suggest that fans of great music, ecspecialy of great live music, purchase this DVD. you will not be disapointed.",982800000,2,1140,4.248847926267281
1394362,5,B000055XTG,This is RATM at their best.  What a show and what a crowd!  This dvd has a letterbox aspect picture and has PCM 2.0 and Dolby 5.1 Surround sound.  The sound for some reason goes a bit lower during some of the songs but it's not that noticeable.  I think this is the best of their three dvds.  The surround sound is pretty good for an older dvd.  Get it!,1212105600,,353,3.9714285714285715
1394363,5,B000055XTG,"I am only doing the review for this dvd and not all three that I bought, which they were all three of Rage's dvd's. I don't think you should really take my review as a legitimate review. Rage is my favorite band of all time. Zach and Tom are two of my idols and inspiration, so of course I am going to have a really bias review for all three of their dvd's I bought. If I was getting paid to tell the truth, I would say this...All three of Rage Against The Machine's dvd's are the raw deal! They are pure rock on all three of the dvd's. Tom is slashing it up, as does Tim (who does his chiming in at times for backup vocs). Brad is completely emotional on the set. He plays like its the last time he is ever going to play again; but does this every time he plays! Blood, sweat, tears, are constantly dripping down all of them as they play their hearts out. Then there is Zach. If this band had somebody such as Maynard, Cornell, Serj, or any other vocalist; then Rage would SUCK! Zach makes completes this band in ever way possible. The pure, untamed, unrestrained, raw, and unconfined emotion that flows through his veins is the only reason you need, to buy any one of their three dvd's. Trust me on this you will not be let down if you buy one, plus they are all really quite inexpensive. Each one comes with bonus stuff that's awesome! One has a interview with Marcos! One has Mexico City trip with Tom and he visits Lenin's home there before he died. The list goes on and on. Just buy one, and honestly for the $40 bucks I spent on all three, it was far out better than pinchin or cinchin your junk in a zipper!! You should get one.",1205107200,,1636,4.147798742138365
1394364,4,B000055XTG,"This is a good concert video however some faults included the band members' lack of energy (thus the reason for my headline), and camera tricks (freeze frame, in particular, being used to a large extent)

  Special features are SOMEWHAT bland: Tom Morello giving a 3 minute tour of mexico city; a one-on-one interview with Zack interviewing famous political author Noam Chomsky(which is actually pretty interesting to watch, like politics or not); Subtitles to each song which can be manually toggled ON/OFF; and my personal favorite, a pre-show segment that just shows rage chilling out backstage. This DVD would have gotten 3 stars if it were not for this. 4 minutes or not this is very interesting just to see the band chilling out backstage and not rallying/protesting. It's a much different Zack De La Rocha then you see on stage.

  I'll let you interpret the songs, although I personally prefer the live versions of ""Freedom"" and ""Guerilla Radio"" on this DVD myself.

  Also, check out and read my review for ""Rage Against the Machine: Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium"" (the DVD), which I think has a better overall performance (and more interaction between Zack and the crowd), alhough this is more energetic because Zack's a year younger in this than in the former.

1394366,5,B000055XTG,This DVD truly highlights the skill that Rage Against the Machine had and only makes fans want the band to get back together. Watching this makes you feel as though you are really at the concert. Overall - SICK! BUY IT!,1171756800,,219,4.365853658536586
1394367,5,B000055XTG,"RATM is one of the greatest bands ever. It's not even debatable. I miss them, their music, and their message. This is of course a must have for any Rage fan. I can't find anything bad to say about this dvd or anything Rage put out. I highly recommend you pick this up if you don't own it.
By the way, this dvd is NOT out of print. There are some sellers, here on Amazon, who are trying to rip off us Rage fans by charging $45 and up for this dvd. Those sellers should know that this dvd can be found, BRAND NEW, for 13 bucks or less. Don't believe me? Check out pricegrabber. Note to those sellers: just because Amazon doesn't carry this dvd, does NOT mean it's out of print.",1144713600,2,675,4.082706766917293
1394368,4,B000055XTG,"This is a very good DVD of RATM. The song selections are good. The video shots are clear and closeup. The song selection includes Calm Like A Bomb, Bulls On Parade, and Killing In The name of. I have just two concerns about this DVD, and I think that anyone who plans on purchasing it should be made aware. First, the DVD has ""freeze frames"" inserted periodically throughout the video. It is hard to explain but the best way I can try is that it looks as though the DVD is scratched and skipping. This does not effect the sound, it took a few times of watching to get used to. It's just some video trick used after production, a type of enhancement. It just doesn't work well with a live show like RATM. The second problem I have is with the sound on Bulls On Parade. All of the other songs except this one seemed to be mixed great. The vocals on Bulls on Parade are almost nonexistant and are what an engineer would call ""at the back of the mix"". In other words the music is way to loud for the vocals and therefore are drowned out. Other than that this is an good DVD. If I didn't own any RATM DVDs, I would suggest getting one of the others first.",1140566400,9,1150,4.161434977578475
1394369,5,B000055XTG,"RATM fan or not, the intensity and energy this band gives off in their live performances is undeniable.  It is this same energy and intensity that initially drew me to them, wheich led to learning more about the substance of their messages, which led to an understanding of other views and opinions previously foreign to me.  The live footage in this DVD in Mexico City is incredible, and the additional featurettes can open your mind to what they're about.  Good stuff.",1128384000,2,470,4.777777777777778
1394370,5,B000055XTG,"RATM holds it down in Mexico! The dvd was dope because it has Professor Chomsky on it, explains the struggle of the People in Chiapas, and Globalization.",1117324800,3,153,4.703703703703703
1394371,2,B000055XTG,"Argg!!  Rage Against the Machine is an awesome band and can kick the crap out of you any time you spin one of their albums.  But I scream out in frustration every time I watch this DVD.  The reason?  They couldn't just play their footage.

For some reason, some stupid fool had to insert a large number of random little things of slow-motion and quick cuts to black and white.  I was nearly screaming at the TV every time it happened.  You'll be rockin' out feelin' the energy of the crowd and Rage and for some reason at some totally unclimactic and random moment it will cut to slow motion.  Incredibly annoying.  I would have give this 1 star, but I don't think I can do that with Rage Against the Machine on it.",1116633600,7,715,4.276119402985074
1394372,5,B000055XTG,"One day in Mexico City a concert broke out.  Rick Rubin caught it on DVD. RATM supplied the live performance amongst five thousand lucky ticket holders. Strong lyrics. Strong riffs. The Battle of Mexico City DVD captures Tom Morello's guitar wizardry and Zack de la Rocha `s lyrical stage presence during a live concert.  They were made to play together. (In concert)
  The DVD shows RATM's musical and political force at the height of their popularity.  The Mexican government policies are secondary to the music of RATM on this day.  All in attendance were on one page.  They were together, fighting for a voice to be heard through a band's live performance.  The Rage lyrics seem to fit word for word.  ""Know your enemy"" and ""Killing in the name "" with ""pocket full of shells..."" comes to mind.
  One drawback, the DVD is edited for strong language. What, at Rage concert? WTF, get the unedited version, if one exists.  The five thousand in attendance were jammed packed in a concert warehouse. This concert takes place in the face of the Mexican government.  No one was going to stop it.  No one did.
  Even if you are not a rock and rap lover, this DVD should be in everyone's musical collection.  This part of musical history should not be missed.  RATM is no more.  All RATM fans can only hope for a reunion.  RATM fans will never let the music die.
  This DVD also includes Zack `s interview with Noam Chomsky, Professor of Linguistics at MIT.  Zack calls him "" most quoted intellectual alive today.""  The DVD features a full-length concert and video journal of the trip in Mexico City.",1088121600,,1594,4.630824372759856
1394373,3,B000055XTG,"Rage Against The Machine are one of the BEST live bands ever. But there are many flaws to this DVD.The live concert is great,but why did they include the dreadful ""Zapata's Blood"" instead of ""Bullet In The Head""?Also,every song with cussing except ""Killing In The Name"" is edited. The worst thing is the slo-mo shots. Zach and Tom are known for their stage presences,why put in slo-mo?Also,the docunmentary footage is in between songs. Why couldn't they have had this has a bonus feature?Also,there is absolutely NO connection between the band and audience. Zach talks to the crowd a lot on the other 2 DVDS,why not this one?The intro sucks to. They should should have shown the scene they describe on the back of the box. This is an OK DVD,but the other 2 are much better. The 3 stars is for the live show alone.

1394376,5,B000055XTG,"[April 29, 2003]
First it starts with the opening of the show, ""Testify"" and ""Guerrilla Radio"". You may have read in other reviews that songs are censored, and that is mostly false (read below). A ""song"" is censored, namely ""Guerrilla Radio"". I was disappointed, but it's not really a big deal that all that's audible is ""Turn that .... .."" when every other song is completely uncensored. I have no idea why, but it might have been a condition set by the label for them to even have the show, and is made up by everything else. For other songs, it can be hard to make out some words because this was a LIVE SHOW.
Then the first documentary (of 4) starts, and they are well done, sometimes giving essential background information for understanding the songs. I had no idea who Emiliano Zapata was or what the Zapatista movement is about before watching this DVD.
The rest of the songs and documentaries continue without disappointment. The slow motion thing going on after a few seconds of close-up on band members is annoying, but not worth mentioning except that other people have.
There are some ""bonus features"" to look forward to after watching the whole thing:
 Zack interviews Noam Chomsky.
A Mexican guy named Marcos talks about globalization and the importance of independant news media.
Both of those are good.
 Tom Morello goes on a tour of Mexico, which isn't all that great.
Tom Morello dominates the footage of the band getting ready for the show, with a few appearances by other members of the band.
Files you can access with a computer about everything they talked about in the documentaries. They actually care about this stuff, which is great.
[Added on May 2, 2003]
I was playing it on my computer, and realized that there's another audio track!  In that one Guerilla Radio is uncensored.  The whole show actually sounds better in that one too.",1051574400,3,1862,4.72
1394377,5,B000055XTG,"Words can't describe how great this DVD is.  One of the best bands of the 90s, RATM know how to rock.

The songs are awesome too- I can't pick a favourite.",1048377600,2,307,4.241379310344827

The documentary was great, and it helped with them doing a show in Mexico city. I admit the VHS picture was better meaning in the DVD, Zacks head is cut in half, you can't see Tom Morellos head and his guitar at the same time, same with Tim C. And Brad Wilk looks like he's not hitting the cymbals at all. The DVD may have all the extra bonus stuff, but if your a true Rage fan, you look for quality concert footage, so I recommend the VHS.

I mean, Zack's head is always in half (can't see his forehead), you can't seen Morello's head AND guitar at the same time (same for Commerford), and Wilk seems to by hitting cymbals too high for this cut-off picture to see. I've seen the video, and it does not have this insane flaw. Get the video, you'll see more which makes for much better viewing. And don't worry about losing extra features; do you want quality viweing of the actual concert? Or do you want to have 4 inches in hieght (accomponied by 40 inches in length) taken away, just to see a few pathetic extra features? Trust me, do not make my mistake.
The footage of the concert itself is fantastic. But then again, the video has that right? And with full viewing? Wow, this DVD is obselte! Progress? ...people just don't know when things are perfect.

1394381,4,B000055XTG,"At a time where more and more bands are releasing and overwhelming amount of live DVDs and videos of particularly awful quality, both of Rage Against the Machine's live releases stand out in the crowd as two of the best band DVDs money can buy.  Although I prefer their first, self-titled video to The Battle of Mexico City, this is still an excellent purchase, and any hardcore Rage fan would be hard-pressed NOT to enjoy this peice of work.
First off, the songlist is outstanding...Rage was a band never really known to waver much from a classic live setlist, and this show is no exception, but none of the songs could be considered 'throwaways', either.  The songs span the most-loved and best-known tracks from their first three albums, paying special attention to the Battle of Los Angeles record, since this show was recorded just after its release.  For me, personally, the stand-out tracks are ""Know Your Enemy"", ""No Shelter"", ""Bulls on Parade"", ""Calm Like a Bomb"", ""War Within a Breath"", and, of course, the closing ""Freedom"".  I heard somewhere that Timmy C is playing 128th notes on his little bass solo on ""Know Your Enemy"", which I must say, is pretty damned amazing.  This performance had a wholly energetic crowd completely mesmerized by Rage's performance.  I think the show, in its entirety, is just over an hour long...not bad at all.  With fourteen songs in all, there is nothing to get upset over here.
Here are the only gripes I have with this DVD.  While outstanding, it certainly isn't perfect:
1.  The sound quality.  While not bad, and still better than the majority of live DVDs out there, sometimes the balance of the sound just isn't up to par.  There are some songs where Timmy C is practically inaudiable, or where Zack's lyrics seem to be muted out...I usually have to turn my stereo up to a pretty high level to enjoy listening to their performance.
2.  Camera work.  Again, this isn't a terrible quality, some of the directing just could've been done better.  Especially when compared to the cinematography of the first video, the camera on this one just doesn't measure up.  Not awful, but not great, either.
3.  Censoring.  This actually isn't a complaint, but a lot of other reviewers might've mentioned how Zack's 'offensive' lyrics are intentionally muted out from the soundtrack...turn the settings of the DVD onto Dolby Digital 5.1, and this is no longer a problem.  Now you can hear Rage in all their vulgar, 'damn the man' glory.
4.  Subtitles.  Although this is a rather pointless downside to the DVD, whoever typed up the subtitles to each song must have never listened to Rage before, much less actually consulted the lyrics to each song before transcribing them.  Not recommended for the deaf or hearing-impaired...or anyone who assumes the subtitles are even remotely correct.
5.  Extra feature footage.  Although I'm definitely glad that the additional documentary footage was included, did it have to be inserted in between songs on the live performance?  I would've watched them anyway, just not in the middle of the live show, preferrably.  This can be a minor irritation while attempting to watch the show all the way through, but anyone inclined to push the 'Next Chapter' button on their remote won't have any worries.
Overall, this is one of the best live DVDs I've ever seen a band release, and like I said earlier, if you're a Rage fan, it's extremely unlikely that you'd be disappointed in buying this peice of work.  While it doesn't capture the band at their prime, it really is one of the best shows they've probably ever done, and from a band that will go down as one of the best live acts in rock history, that's really saying something.  If you are new to Rage, or simply want to get deeper into their music, picking up this video would be a great way to explore them further.  Unforunately, though Rage is one of my all-time favorite bands, I was never fortunate enough to see them live (it seems that this affliction holds true with many of their newer fans, as well).  However, this DVD is about as close as you can get to actually being in the pit, mere yards away from the band members themselves.  Pick up a copy of this DVD as soon as possible, you won't regret it.",1039305600,,4236,4.708276797829036
1394392,4,B000055XTG,"The Battle of Mexico City gives you a full-length concert performed my Rage Against the Machine and intermission footage about the followers of Zapata (Which is interesting at some points). The DVD is pretty good. It gives you dolby digital 5.1 but at some points the sound gets really low. The crowd is loud, Zach's vocals are loud, and intro's to some songs are are loud, but the rest of it gets pretty low. If this is a concert, then they should have recorded this properly.

1394394,2,B000055XTG,"It's really too bad that the editors of this viedo were more interested in the crowd and circa 1990 Bon Jovi camera angle changes every 2 seconds then they were the guys.  No, it's not bad, but it fails to convey the energy like the previous DVD did.
If you had to buy only one Rage DVD, buy the one before this one.  It illustrated the energy as well as the crowd far better.
This DVD is so polished it's uncharacteristically synthetic for Rage.
That said, the sound is outstanding and they're still angry.  And they use the media mogules against themselves which I respect.",1012435200,,575,4.457142857142857
1394395,5,B000055XTG,"I bought this dvd just to see Testify live (my favorite song at the time), but performances like Bulls On Parade, Sleep Now In The Fire, Freedom, and Know Your Enemy, make you really notice what a talented group they really are. Just when you think Tom's at the top, you hear something even more challenging. This dvd documents Rage at their finest. Just the political message in No Shelter makes you think about if we really need those 'dope nikes'. Every Rage fan NEEDS to see this.",1005436800,,484,4.511363636363637
1394396,4,B000055XTG,"This DVD is a visual example of how tight of a band RATM really is. From song to song on this set, Rage's fury spills out into the crowd. The intensity of the show is incendiary on this Mexican stage, especially given the political circumstances of Mexico at the time and RATM's conflicting political agenda
.
This disc also features some mini-documentaries of injustices performed by governments of The United States and Mexico, narrated by Zack De La Rocha. These only help to amplify the feeling of anger and rebellion you get watching the band pound out their revolutionary rhythms onstage. Some of the features of this disc that would take away from the five stars that I almost gave it are:
1) The annoying slow motion shots. They are distracting and really take away from the intensity of the show.
2) The fact that Sony censored out most of the 'Fxxx's and 'Sxxx's that are in the lyrics. This really takes away from the overall vibe of the disc and pretty much goes against the intent and message of Rage Against The Machine.
3) The hype on the back cover of the case. If you are going to hype up the show in this manner, you should include the pictures of the crowd outside and how high the tensions actually were. When watching the video, they show none of this which was (a very brief) let down.
I was very glad to see that there were no backstage interviews after the show. I think the way they left you with the intensity of the closing of 'Freedom' was fitting for a band that pulls no punches.",999734400,,1509,4.451263537906137
1394397,3,B000055XTG,"Okay I am going to start with why I did only rate it 3 stars: 1: There is an error with this dvd, and the error is that the sound goes faster that the picture and the sound is changing sometimes from low to high. 2: There is slo motion every 30 second in every song. The music or the show is not bad but it is the sound quality that doesnt sound right. If you are an big Rage fan then you should get this one. I personaly have watched this dvd three times in three days and I love it so much.",998611200,,492,3.7403846153846154
1394398,3,B000055XTG,"I'm a huge rage fan, sadly, this DVD is just ""okay"".
Good Things: * good set/song list.  * good video/audio quality.
Bad Things: * all footage is from one concert. * the venue was small and Rage seems to be lacking energy or dare I say, rage. * director resorts to ... MTV camera tricks to make up for the lack of energy. * Too much preaching in between songs with Zach overextending some analogous movements that don't really make sense.  Its kind of embarrasing.",998092800,3,464,4.447058823529412
1394399,5,B000055XTG,"I am 37 and I love these guys! There live performance will make you get up and take notice. A great band with a real message! The band is tight, precise and like watching a bomb go off! I can't get enough! Too bad they have broken up, but will always be a fan of Tom and Zach......should be interesting solo careers! Thanks Ratm. Will wait for the reunion........",997142400,,363,4.27536231884058
1394400,5,B000055XTG,"After getting that... video Revolution U.S.A, Rage fans have waited for another concert video release.  Their first was an excellent concert of their first two albums, and also included a bonus cd of The Ghost of Tom Joad.  4 years later, we have finally gotten the ultimate Rage concert footage release:  The Battle of Mexico City!
This video is amazing!  Rage was considered to be one of the great live performers of our time, and this video shows it.  Every one of their shows, including this one, is so energy filled.  Even moreso here, as this was Rage's first concert in Mexico, and was very big due to their support for various political causes.
The video starts off with the 3rd single of their Battle of Los Angeles album, Testify.  It is an awesome song, and really got the crowd going.  Next came Guerilla Radio, which is undoubtedly the hit song off of BoLA.  Both of these songs are excellent, and we get to hear the amazing guitar work of Tom Morello, who along with Buckethead and a few others, is the greatest guitarist of this time.  Next up we have People of the Sun, which is a great song.  The crowd went crazy for this song due to its subject matter about the political problems in Mexico.  3 more OK songs off of BoLA come next:  Sleep Now in the Fire, Calm Like a Bomb, and Born of a Broken Man.  At the halfway point, we get one of Rage's best songs ever:  Bombtrack.  Everything about this song is amazing, from the opening, to the hard, energy filled vocals, to the amazing guitar work.  We then get my personal favorite RATM song:  Know Your Enemy, simply amazing.  Bulls on Parade, War Within a Breath, Killing in the Name, Zapata's Blood all follow up until the energy filled conclusion with Freedom.
This is one amazing video, that includes all of Rage's best songs.  Also included on the DVD is a documentary on the political status of Mexico and a nice photo gallery.  So don't waste any time, testify now and buy the Battle of Mexico City!",989020800,,1972,4.48314606741573
1394401,4,B000055XTG,"this video contains some intense stuff, just like it should. the music ranges from the first album to the third, so there's something for everyone. my only problem was the wierd camera stoppage, sometimes the footage stops and then picks up several frames later, and at some key points. you get used to it though, great buy.",985046400,,324,4.701754385964913
