4208487,5,B003VADRTW,"I like this show and the video is no let down.  I always enjoy Adam.  I don't think I can eat like that, but then that makes a good show and Adam seems to be a good MC.",1290470400,,168,3.3947368421052633
4208488,5,B003VADRTW,Watch Adam try to kill himself eating things that are really bad for you.,1412812800,,73,4.285714285714286

4208492,5,B003VADRTW,We love Man v Food.  We have planned vacations around some of these restaurants!  Only problem with the show is it makes us hungry.,1395532800,,131,4.416666666666667
4208493,4,B003VADRTW,I chose 4 stars because I like to look for overlooked food joints to eat at when I'm traveling. The host is funny and has charisma. He can eat a lot too.,1395187200,,153,3.8125
4208494,5,B003VADRTW,I like the way he describes his food challenges and how he prepares for them.  If  I go on vacation I know where to stop for Great food now!,1394064000,,140,3.793103448275862
4208495,5,B003VADRTW,"Let me just say, that my review is not based on my super sized, 90210, 8th grade crush that I have on Adam... In season 2 of MVF, You get to experience foods and local cultures from Island to Island ( Puerto Rico to Honolulu) and every place in between.

The way that Adam connects with each cook and is able to show case thier passion for what they make is truly a talent and makes you feel like you are right there with him taking that first bit of what ever amazing dish was just created.

Let's not forget about the challenges ... OMG!!! Some are so painful to watch, Like episode 16 (Suicide Wings Jesus Christ) My butt hurt just watching it ...

So in short, If you love food, Good food, Bad for you food, Something a bit unsusal and old classics re-vamped, Give MVF2 a try, You will not be sorry that you pushed play!",1393459200,,824,4.169811320754717

4208498,4,B003VADRTW,"Entertaining, if you want to see large amounts of food devoured then it may be something to watch to pass time. Kid friendly also!",1392681600,,130,4.458333333333333
4208499,5,B003VADRTW,"Watching this show is almost as fun as eating.

Vicarious compulsive overeating at it's best.

I want a Man vs. Food videogame.",1390176000,,127,4.7272727272727275
4208500,4,B003VADRTW,"I've seen this and the other seasons a couple of times each, so that tells you something. I didn't give it 5 stars because I don't think that it is a classic that will stand up to the test of time, but it is a fun, entertaining, wholesome, family, show.",1389657600,,253,4.08
4208501,5,B003VADRTW,"Great show, I love seeing new places with great local food.  Makes me want to travel and eat and get fat.",1389139200,,105,4.0
4208502,5,B003VADRTW,It's a great show. Sheds light on smaller businesses. It can help bring them business when people are in town to visit,1388880000,,118,4.409090909090909
4208503,2,B003VADRTW,Adam can be overly enthusiastic. It hurts my stomach watching all the things he forces himself to eat. I do however like to see the locations and maybe go to some for normal sized portions.,1388534400,,189,4.428571428571429
4208504,1,B003VADRTW,"The host is an anti-foodie (if there is such a thing) and a complete buffoon. The very thought of creating a show in which the idiot host could possibly eat himself to death should be illegal. This show should never have been allowed to air. It goes against every
principal of health. Furthermore, his taste in food, food locations and food choices are very poor! WTF Travel Channel???? -- Mario Bataglia or Wolfgang Puck he ain't!",1388361600,,431,4.684210526315789
4208505,5,B003VADRTW,This is a good fun show to watch.  Like one of the other reviewers said I am always hungry when I watch this show.  It has a lot of fun food places to see and the host is pretty funny.,1387756800,,184,3.575

4208507,3,B003VADRTW,I would have liked it better if I could have seen the whole show. After several attempts to view it over a few days and the show stopping to re buffer I finally just gave up. I like the show but can't watch anything on Amazon anymore.,1385164800,,234,4.0
4208508,2,B003VADRTW,"See another review I did for another season or link with Man vs Food.

4208525,1,B003VADRTW,I bought this thinking it was something I could use in the High School culinary Arts program.  The language is unappropriated for school.,1305417600,,137,4.956521739130435
4208526,5,B003VADRTW,I am a health teacher and I use this DVD set to look at caloric intake and all the different ways that restaurants have these challenges.  It is crazy to think that someone can eat this much.,1297123200,,191,4.162162162162162

8406521,4,B003VADRTW,"In addition to a big final food challenge, Adam also visits various restaurants and eateries in each city that has an interesting or unique food offering. Adam is the agreeable sort where everything he eats on the show is super-duper delicious and with him giving an orgasmic reaction.  Season 2 follows along the same pattern as the first season so if you've watched the first season then you know what to expect. Here are the cities that Adam Richman visits:

Disc 1
San Antonio
Las Vegas
Charleston
San Francisco
Durham
Honolulu
Sarasota
Philadelphia
Ballparks(3 different minor league towns)
Springfield

Disc 2
Boise
Washington, DC
Baltimore
Detroit
Brooklyn
Alaska
Little Rock
Tucson
New Brunswick
Hartford

Disc 2 also has some bonus features of extra footage from certain cities, these segments last a few minutes each. While I am not a huge fan of Richman, I still enjoyed watching season 2 because of the interesting places and crazy food items(and of course the insane food challenges).",1427846400,,997,5.060975609756097
