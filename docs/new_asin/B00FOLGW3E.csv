6016449,3,B00FOLGW3E,"First, let me say that if I was awarding stars based on the quality of these films, this collection would get a big fat zero. However, for sheer entertainment value, this collection gets....ummm, well, how about a one? But don't let that persuade you.  I love to sit around with friends and laugh at the idiocy of low budget horror movies. It is a blast. And for cellar-dwelling budgets and over-the-hill actors, this collection goes beyond my wildest expectations! My favorite is House of the Black Death. Yes, it has everything, Lon Chaney, Jr. with horns and a cloven foot! John Carradine spewing never-ending lines of deranged dialogue, Belly dancers that make up their dance moves as they go along...and along...and along..zzzzzzz.... And a coven of witches that simply move about or act in whatever way the director is yelling to them from off camera. You don't hear him, but you know he's there!  There's even a werewolf! Of course we only see him for a split second as he dies from......wait why did he die? Oh well. Disappearing props, the film flipped around so that right is left and left is right, and an amazing variety of plots that all seem to occur at the same time but never really get resolved. All this and much more awaits!  Drink plenty of coffee so you can stay awake through this mish-mash. And try to watch all three movies. You may not be able to do it, but give it your best shot.",1418601600,8,1406,4.571428571428571
6016450,4,B00FOLGW3E,"Odds are that if you are even on this page, you know the type of films Jerry Warren is known for. The 4 stars doesn't imply these movies are on par with anything by Michael Powell, George Kukor, or Carol Reed. These are what they are Drive-In B movie and dreadfully low budget (there is good low budget, see Detour).

The DVD by Kit Parker Films/VCI Entertainment is extremely well made. The movies are well represented with high quality prints of each. These movies couldn't look or sound better than what you have here and given the nature of these movies, you'd almost never expect this much care to be taken to release these movies on DVD in any form, much less a good form. You can contrast these with the public domain prints of other Jerry Warren movies (Incredible Petrified World, Terror of the Bloodhunters, Teenage Zombies) and you do get something worth your money here (IF you are looking for low budget horror/sci fi from the 50s and 60s).

There isn't much in the way of extras here but what is here is enjoyable. It is an audio reenactment of a portion of an interview with Bri Murphy conducted in the early 90's for a horror mag. You get alot of information about Murphy who did a ton of work on Warren's first films and eventually married him. There's alot of talk about Man Beast and the Incredible Petrified World but neither is included on here.

As for the movies, only House of the Black Death looks to be a complete Warren film but it isn't. Harold Daniels directed the majority of House of the Black Death and Warren did brief insert scenes. Attack of the Mayan Mummy and Creature of the Walking Dead are made up of parts of movies Warren bought cheap then shot some new footage to tie them together. Turns out Manbeast was the same thing too (Warren made a movie around stock footage of rock climbers, this is on the first collection). This set isn't as entertaining for me personally because these spliced together movies are painfully dull.

Recommended DVD if you are interested in these types of movies because you will get your money's worth.",1397692800,15,2073,4.549597855227882
6016451,4,B00FOLGW3E,"If you like cheesy schlock movies from the 50s and 60s, like I do, this is a fun collection.  They're not good movies, mind you (at least not Warren's renditions) but they're fun for fans of junk movies.",1393804800,3,203,4.342105263157895

8617438,2,B00FOLGW3E,horror writers have criticized jerry warren for his bad horror pictures.the reputation is well deserved.they are mostly talky with occassional burst of action.the best movie of the 4 was House of the Black death which i could give 3 stars for. It is about a family of fueding witches and werewolfs. Lon chaney is the warlock trying to steal leadership of the devil cult from John Carradine. Special effects are minimal,1496534400,,418,4.901408450704225
8617439,5,B00FOLGW3E,"Don't expect Oscar worthy epics here...

However, if you are a fan of truly awful, badly dubbed, patched together movies (part old Mexican horror films, part US footage for an American audience), then the Jerry Warren Collection, Volume 2 is for YOU!  There is something captivating about how atrociously bad these films really are.  Definitely NOT for every taste, but you can't beat it for the price!",1496361600,,402,4.970149253731344
8617440,2,B00FOLGW3E,"Oh brother.  I love cheesy low budget horror and science fiction, particularly that which was produced prior to 1970.  These flicks however, are barely watchable rubbish.  There are many other DVD options of this sort available, buy them instead.",1468886400,,246,5.256410256410256

8617446,4,B00FOLGW3E,"Jerry Warren possessed genius of a kind, though one might wonder WHAT kind.  He said he did it because he wanted to make cheap crap that made money, though it had to be obvious he wasn't making much money.  It might have been because he was inept, though what Jerry Warren  did with the camera or 'Movieola' wasn't completely without flair.  Or it might have been because he yearned to be a great filmmaker, as Ed Wood or Phil Tucker had.  No.  The trouble lay deeper than that.  Warren seemed driven to impose his own demented vision upon the on the world.  He wanted, I believe, to be REMEMBERED;  to let it be known that HE was the one responsible for the unforgettable  'Incredible Petrified World' or 'Wild Wild World of Bat Woman.'  NO OTHER INDIVIDUAL IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND could ever have impressed themselves upon the world asJERRY WARREN could, and he wanted no one - ABSOLUTELY NO ONE - to EVER forget it!!  My only regret about the 2 volume set of Jerry Warren masterpieces issued by Kit Parker Films is that there are only 2 volumes.  I live and breathe and pray for the day when Volumes 3 through 20 are eventually released.",1423353600,8,1142,4.458937198067633
