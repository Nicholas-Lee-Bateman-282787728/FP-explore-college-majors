6258839,4,B00ID8H98C,"I saw this when it was touring around the US last year, and although I knew most of the information contained in this, the vintage HD photographs of Bettie were stunning on the big screen. It features some great vintage footage and lots of never-before-seen photos of Bettie, which alone justifies a viewing for fans. You won't SEE elderly Bettie (she never allowed recent photographs as she didn't want to ruin her own image) but you will HEAR her as she tells you about her entire life from her days as a child to her years after modeling. Fans of burlesque, retro culture, pin ups, beautiful women or rockabilly should enjoy this one. Bettie is an American underground pin up icon and whether you're casually curious about her or you're her biggest fan, this film is definately worth a watch (or maybe a purchase).",1398297600,36,817,4.680555555555555

6258843,5,B00ID8H98C,Battie Page was one of a kind human being beautiful person. And I'm glad she is finally geting paid for her work.,1501027200,,113,4.181818181818182

6258845,5,B00ID8H98C,Amazing if u are a true Betty fan. You will finally be able to know her truth. She is the narrator. Some of her story is sad. Some is amazing. It's a must have..,1498435200,,161,3.764705882352941
6258846,4,B00ID8H98C,"She was the ultimate pinup (and part-time fetish model) and then modelling's mystery woman. This may in fact be too much info about her life, but it's interesting anyway.

6258848,5,B00ID8H98C,This in depth documentary sets the story straight!  I was amazed at some of the information in the documentary!  I had no idea she dated Richard Arbib and that he designed a watch especially for her!  There are so many details to the documentary.  The musical background and the way that the story comes together through the use of cartoons and vintage footage is amazing.  This biopic did leave out her months in Haiti but other than that this is a bittersweet Valentine to Bettie!  If I could I would give it 100 stars!  It is a shame this did not receive at least a nomination for an Academy Award!,1493683200,4,601,4.409090909090909

6258850,5,B00ID8H98C,"If you are an admirer of burlesque and curvaceous models, with Bettie Page as the queen of retro modeling, this detailed biography definitely reveals all, but in a good way that makes one admire her even more!!!!!",1488844800,2,213,4.783783783783784

6258863,3,B00ID8H98C,"Bettie Page is my favorite pinup. There is no one like her in the genre. Although we hear parts of her story in her own voice and see some wonderful rare photos, the film has an amateurish feel. With access to Bettie and the great material it could have been so much more.",1485475200,,272,4.150943396226415
6258864,5,B00ID8H98C,"This was a well done documentary! I watched the whole thing from start to finish and then watched the added bonus features.
Some of the bonus features are footage that did not make it into the main feature. I liked all of it. When this was being made, Bettie was up in her age, so, with her telling the story for it, she had to rely on her memory. I'm not so sure she did the audio commentary part years before, but it is possible. When you watch the movie on her life, the images coincide with her commentary. So, strictly taking the audio from interviews is highly unlikely. At her age she probably could not recall exact details for every single incident that may or may not have taken place, but I give her credit for trying to tell all of us what happened in her life. It came out really well.

I am a fan of hers since 1990. I have a few of her vintage magazines from the era she was most popular, the '50s up to her retirement at age 34. I believe she retired in 1957. She was born in 1923 and passed away in mid Dec. 2008.

The Blu-ray is high quality. I have played it on the Sony Ultra 4K player and UHD 4K TV. It looks really good for most of it, some vintage archival footage is taken at the source, so it doesn't come up pristine. The photos of Bettie are wonderful to see, most had never been published before until now. I like the music with it and the photographers that took her photos as well are in it discussing how she posed, etc.
Bettie herself is discussing most of the documentary as it progresses. The segments were kept at a reasonably fast pace, so some editing may not have been done in the desirable way others may have done it. Still, I liked the entire program from the beginning to end.

6258889,5,B00ID8H98C,"If you ever wondered what happened to Bettie Page, this will clear it up. Mostly. She had serious mental problems and ended up in an institution for about ten years a the end of her very public career. The disk is her history before her mental breakdown. She didn't have a happy childhood. She was a fantastic model who became known for nudes and bondage photos. Some burlesque work also. She made most of the outfits that she was photographed in. Her life after the institution is not covered. She was interviewed for this documentary but is not shown (her request).",1463356800,,567,4.623762376237623
6258890,5,B00ID8H98C,"To many of us, Bettie Page is an icon, a beautiful woman captured in time. But she was a human being just like us, and in this documentary we see how human she was. In an interview taken before she died, Bettie tells us of her childhood in Tennessee and her molestation by her father, her rocky marriage to her teenage sweetheart (and eventual divorce), being discovered in New York by a Coney Island African-American cop, her career in Irving and Paula Klaw's Movie Star News, her session in Congress interviewed by Senator Keufaver, her disastrous second marriage, finding religion, her stint in and out of mental hospitals, and the rediscovery of her fans and her influence on pop culture as a whole. Interspersed with her interview are comments by Paula Klaw, noted pinup photographer Bunny Yeager, Hugh Hefner, and many others. For a sneak peek into the life of one of the most beautiful cultural icons, this documentary is a must.",1460937600,9,936,4.783950617283951

6258894,5,B00ID8H98C,"If you enjoy the films or photographs of Bettie Mae Page at all, this is a must see. It's her last interview set to many, many previously unseen and also famous photographs of her.  It basically tells her whole life story and even includes, a little morbidly, footage taken during her funeral.  As a Betty fan myself, I enjoyed this and tried to take screenshots of it, but Amazon doesn't let you do that. Too bad, because I would've liked to of added her to my pictures of her on the Internet.",1455580800,3,494,4.358695652173913
6258895,4,B00ID8H98C,"I'm a big fan of Bettie Page and originally saw this film as a rental.  Have become Facebook friends with Mark Mori who produced and directed this documentary of Bettie and have been waiting for the price to come down on the Blu-Ray, as I wanted a Blu-Ray copy rather than dvd which is how I originally saw it.  For those who are interested in Bettie, this film should be at the top of your list.",1455235200,,396,4.197368421052632
6258896,1,B00ID8H98C,I thought the movie was very poor in quality.  Much of the movie was not in blue ray as I had expected.  So I returned the item and received a refund.  I would not recommend this Blu-ray DVD unless someone is just interested in seeing photographs of Bettie Page which most of the DVD was about.,1454025600,,294,4.214285714285714

Now I will have to change the area back when I view  a disc mfg for USA use.  Supposedly you can only do this a limited number of times.  My computer said 5 times.  Don't know what happens after that.  Goes up in smoke I guess.  But the video was pretty good.  I am old enough to remember Bettie Page in all her glory.,1438214400,,437,3.875

6258921,5,B00ID8H98C,"I have seen several films on the enigmatic and fascinating Bettie Page.  This, by far, was my favorite.  It was most thorough and fair, it dealt with her life challenges in a sympathetic, yet fair, manner.",1421193600,,205,4.666666666666667

6258923,3,B00ID8H98C,The photos were stunning but the production of the documentary is terrible. The audio is horrible. There are times you can hardly make out what Betty is saying because the tacky music drowns her out. It's like the producer had a $500 budget to make this documentary. The vintage photos and film clips are the only reason it's worth watching this. Hope someday someone reproduces this documentary who knows how to edit.,1419984000,3,418,4.819444444444445
6258924,4,B00ID8H98C,"I enjoyed the movie-documentary style, and very in depth ""pictography"", which gives a clear idea even of who her photographers are at any given time in her life as solely as a model.  I particularly love the Bunny Yeager photos that show her more voluptuously and muscular, and who Bettie was comfortable around naked. She ended up a Playboy ""Bunny"" and thereafter begins a sort of pornographic career with bondage and sexuality, but not sex.  She took many nude photos as did some actors of the time.

I loved how intelligent she comes across in the beginning and how hard she worked for the Vanderbilt scholarship, ending up Salutatorian.  Wow Factor!  There is a period of years when Bettie Page disappears that I would have liked to know more about, and I feel a certain mystique that can be capitalized upon, but I don't think such a meat and potatoes woman has obvious ""Sphinx Without a Secret"" tendencies, in spite of her mental difficulties, voices, trauma, and spirituality - no doubt.

But what also is clear is that Bettie Page had been a model all the time, always posing and practicing posing, and loved making love; and the incidents of her life in San Francisco, New York, Miami, and Tennessee where she was born just carried out the inevitable and Revealed All about this fully local American woman from the hills and valleys of Tennessee.",1419638400,,1355,4.74468085106383

6258940,3,B00ID8H98C,"I was disappointed with this. While I haven't watched all the extras, I will say the documentary is badly edited, really badly edited. You will have a scene run for 30 seconds to a couple of minutes. That scene will abruptly end and the next scene will start with a totally different film score and archival footage. There are just to many 1 to 3 minutes shorts scenes which reminds me of being in stop and go traffic. This literally looks and sounds like this was the editors first time editing a film.

Its nice you get to hear Betty's narration, but she has changed her story in regards to her life over the years so I 'm sure some of the stories shes tells are inaccurate. The archival footage and pictures of Betty are interesting and it is interesting to hear her story however inaccurate ""some"" of it is.

I give this a mild recommendation. If the editing had been more professional this would be must have for Betty fans. I would recommend renting or streaming this as it won't hold up for repeat viewings. My real rating would be 2.5 stars.",1405728000,6,1049,4.430051813471502

It covers Bettie Page's later years after she leaves modeling and film. The earlier segments cover the same territory as the biopic The Notorious Bettie Page; however, they offer also interesting commentary about mid-20-c social context. I am glad to have watched Bettie Page Reveals All. Bettie herself is a commentator in the movie. She did not always give many interviews, so her words are valuable.",1402531200,14,521,5.214285714285714

6258983,5,B00ID8H98C,"It was fantastic to finally hear the voice of the stunning MS Page, after gazing at her amazing face and form these many decades.
This is one GREAT film if you're a fan of this beautiful lady. I'm pleased that her final years were more comfortable money wise and she found out how much she meant to so many people that never knew her personally",1400371200,19,344,4.3076923076923075
6258984,4,B00ID8H98C,"A very tastefully done documentary about one of the most famous ""Pin-Up"" girls of the 1950's.  There are numerous interviews with people that knew her and even better a lot of both still and movie pictures of this very beautiful woman and some commentary that she made with a friend that had been tape recorded.",1400284800,4,311,4.654545454545454
6258985,2,B00ID8H98C,"The movie was shot well and the story was interesting, but the sound on this movie was so poor, I struggled to hear the narrative. Music was continually played against ALL the people interviewed and  was too loud. It really ruined the movie.",1400198400,14,241,4.604651162790698

6258987,5,B00ID8H98C,"I'm sure many of Bettie Page's legions of fans would agree that they fell in love with her the moment they laid eyes on her.  For me, that happened in the mid Nineteen-Eighties when the late comic book artist Dave Stevens helped to stir up a revived interest in her.  Even though her whereabouts were unknown at the time and she was obviously many years my senior, my impression of the sweet personality conveyed by her images always made me feel like maybe I could have won her heart, if only we had been contemporaries.  I'll bet a lot of guys had similar feelings.  This excellent documentary brought back a lot of those bittersweet feelings, and at the same time made me very happy that Bettie got a chance to tell her story before she died.  Even as an older woman in her eighties, she isn't ashamed to admit that she enjoyed her sexuality as a younger woman.  And even though deeply religious, she was still proud of her career as a pin-up model.  She lived a life that had no shortage of hardships, and yet she clearly had no regrets.  This documentary is a loving portrait of a beautiful woman who truly had a Joie de vivre, and it's a joy that carries over to the viewer.  This is one movie I will revisit time and time again.",1399852800,32,1235,4.358078602620087
6258988,3,B00ID8H98C,"Lots of archival footage used to illustrate early life not a lot of live interviews. She had a fascinating, strange, tragic existence. Entire documentary is basically narrated by Page herself and she gets the last word. Worth a watch.",1399248000,7,234,5.0256410256410255
6258989,5,B00ID8H98C,"This is a ""must see"" for all fans of Bettie's.  Lots of  photographs/film footage of Bettie---comments from many people who knew her---and, best of all, we get to hear Bettie talking about her life and experiences.  She sets the record straight and clears up many events that have become clouded with untruths, misconceptions, and fables.

As I said, any fan of Bettie's will find this informative and entertaining.",1398988800,6,415,5.0588235294117645

Why am I torturing myself by looking at her scantily dressed or totally nude? That's the powerful allure that this woman has had over men since she came upon the scene back in the 1940s. Bettie Page and Marilyn Monroe, two women who will have a lock on my heart forever, in this world and the next.",1520035200,,444,4.235294117647059
8641076,5,B00ID8H98C,"An outstanding bio on a fabulous woman. I had no idea how detailed this movie went. From her childhood until her death in 2008. Do not assume this is a sleeze movie, it's not. It has numerous photo's of her throughout the movie. But her narration of facts from lies is quite interesting. She came across as a very passionate woman with a heart of gold. After watching this movie you will not look at her as ""Candy to the Eye, but a beautiful person in the heart"". I highly recommend this movie.",1515628800,,494,4.32258064516129
