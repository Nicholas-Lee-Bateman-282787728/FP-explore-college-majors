1197354,3,B000009EJZ,"An eight-year-old boy discovers a family of tiny people living beneath the floorboards of his Victorian country home, but no one will believe him. Eddie Albert plays Pod, the pintsized patriarch of the Clock family, who does everything he can to protect his wife and daughter when their secret is in danger of being revealed. Treated like vermin instead of the magical miracles they really are, the Pods wriggle through narrow escapes after being chased by a dogged cat and a tenacious ferret. TV remakes followed in 1977 and 1992, and the first big screen version was released in 1997 (starring Jim Broadbent as Mr. Clock).

Somewhat slow due to too leisurely script-writing, but not bad -- especially for 70s nostalgists.

1197356,4,B000009EJZ,"I have read the reviews and the description at IMDB but I just don't recall the last name ""Clock"". The basic premise is the same but more than a few details seem to be different. For instance Hominy Lupe was mom's name not Homily Clock. The young girl was Arietta not Arietty Clock. They sure made the most of everything that they ""borrowed"".
They also live in mortal fear of encountering the cat or even a mouse. Altogether a pretty good story. It's a real challenge just staying in one piece. Man, I couldn't live like that. I saw this on TNT during my college days. Very episodic.
This one guy makes a bow and arrow out of little tooth picks and shoots the cat with it. Of course the cat is very large to them but still lets out a loud ""MEEOWW"". He's also got big teeth and great big claws.
Very interesting movie probably the very same one that I saw.",995673600,4,855,4.251533742331288
1197357,4,B000009EJZ,"A sickly eight year old boy (Dennis Larson) is sent to stay with his aunt in the countryside. Underneath the floorboards of her home resides a family of miniature people who refer to themselves as ""Borrowers,"" considering they ""borrow"" small objects from humans to furnish their ""apartment."" When our little hero catches sight of one of them, the mother and father of the Borrowers family grow rather paranoid, knowing that human boys are curious creatures and fearing this one might expose them to the others who up until this moment did not know they existed. Yet, the twelve year old daughter (Karen Pearson) of the Borrowers family has no fear and ends up befriending the tyke. But what are they to do when the nasty maid catches on that mice-sized people have been stealing from her employer?

This story does not align at all with the original book outside of the time period and names used.  They had the boy just visiting his Great Aunt from Boston.  Seriously?!

The movie is shaky and grainy, and just hard to watch, and that's a shame.  This version stays closer to the feel of the book and its illustrations than the later production starring John Goodman. Some people may complain that the production values are primitive, and they are.  The movie is from the 70s, but in my opinion that just makes the production quaint.

1197433,2,B000009EJZ,"The music is horrible/boring, the acting and filming is poor, and it is very obvious where they used green screen effects.  It's a real shame because the books about the borrowers are pretty good - I loved them when I was a kid.  Also, the borrowers are supposed to be kind of a cross between mice and people - they have tails and kind of mouse-like facial features and this movie left that out so they were just tiny humans in this movie, so it didn't make sense when the mother borrower saw her first human and thought they looked ugly.

Maybe Disney or Pixar will remake this someday and then it'll be good to watch, but I'd pass on this movie version - I don't think even kids would like it.",1348790400,,695,4.25

Unfortunately you will never see anything like that in the video.  The colors are muddy and muted throughout the film.

This is all a sad thing because it is a classic film from Hallmark Hall of Fame and deserves a much better presentation than what it got from ""Digivew Products""  I would suggest avoiding anything with their name on it.  I know I will.  And unless you REALLY want this film, I can not suggest you buy it in it's current form.",1321228800,,614,4.232758620689655

is a high quality theatrical production, in my opinion on the
same level , for example, as Francis Ford Coppola's 1993
production of ""The Secret Garden."" It is a wonderfully done piece,
sure to be enjoyed by children and adults of all ages.

Our copy came on one of the discs in the 50 Movie Family Fun Pack
by Mill Creek, ordered from Amazon. While the color may not be
up to that of  a fully restored film, it was of acceptable quality,
without visual or audio noise, and the sound was fine.",1295136000,3,558,4.304761904761905
1197437,5,B000009EJZ,"This is regarding the Digiview edition ISBN #  872322001276.
This is the best available DVD of this Hallmark made-for-TV movie starring Eddie Albert, Tammy Grimes and Dame Judith Anderson as originally broadcast December 14, 1973.

AUDIO:  The audio is in original 2-channel stereo, and is clean, crisp and without any muffling or muddying as on other editions.

VIDEO:  The movie is made in a combination of film for outdoor scenes and video for indoor or studio scenes, as is typical of British television of the 1970s (see Monty Python, Benny Hill, etc.), but is NOT typical of American production at the time.  The reason is for both time and budget:  Video studios had a simple Lumi-key or Chroma-key system of matting one shot into another, e.g. weather maps and news graphics.  (Years before the invention of ""Ulti-matte"" and green screen technology.)  This was done in real-time with the principal photography -- set up the effect and record, much faster than the 3-stage process of traveling mattes used in motion pictures.  This mix of media together with the largely British cast have led to the false belief that this is a British program.  It is not; it is American.  The BBC would not tackle The Borrowers until the series of 1993-1994.

COLOR:  The color level on this disc is extremely washed out, almost black-and-white, but is easily remedied by cranking up the color level on your TV to about 3/4 level.  Then it will look fairly normal.  I wish they had done this simple chroma adjustment when mastering the DVD.  (Remember to set it back down when finished!)

ASPECT RATIO:  The other reviewer who complained of a distorted aspect ratio must have been referring to some other edition.  This Digiview release is presented in the original full screen 1:33 aspect ratio, and displays perfectly on a standard 4x3 TV.

""DIGITALLY REMASTERED"":  This is the biggest point of contention, and requires some explanation:  DVDs and CDs are a digital medium, therefore any time something is recorded on a disc, it is by definition ""digitally mastered.""  If a DVD says ""Digitally Mastered"" they're just blowing smoke, since that's the only way discs are made!  But this says ""Digitally RE-mastered.""  That sounds good, but is a little vague.  A better description would be ""Digitally Enhanced.""  A comparison of this Digiview DVD with an earlier VHS version shows that this Enhanced DVD has a vastly improved matte-and-key effect.  They have evidently used today's digital effects computer technology to ""paint"" and clean up the matte and key artifacts around the edges of actors and backgrounds, so they look perfectly sharp and crisp!  (Only one shot with a rack-focus was impossible to fix because of the deliberate blurring.)  Except for some missing shadows, the effects shots now look almost as good as any on live television today.  The stereo audio track may also have been digitally enhanced.",1289088000,22,2909,4.995833333333334

1197456,3,B000009EJZ,"I remember seeing this when it first aired on Hallmark Hall of Fame. Yes, the special effects weren't the best but it was awhile ago; these days (as with the '97 version) they could do better. Still, it has its charms and there's good acting and backing music (if a bit mellow by today's standards--Rod McKuen, etc.) They could indeed have made a sequel or a
TV series. (Later there would be versions done for TNT & BBC, and a theatrical film, in the 90s.) The picture and sound aren't perfect but it's like watching an old movie on the late late show: you excuse the imperfections and try to concentrate on the plot, etc. (Cheap price at least, and I did order from amazon.)

They could have tried to go to an original master film/tape and maybe this was the best version they could find (?) It's digital because they converted it to digital media but certainly is not remastered.

The color is horrible and the film is extremely grainy. I would still recommend it because it is the only ""classic"" version available. I'm looking forward to the longer (and better) version with Ian Holm to be released on DVD.",1128038400,10,365,4.462686567164179
7905442,1,B000009EJZ,"I love the movie but the quality of the disc was very bad. It looked like it had been re-recorded from an old VHS, grainy and blurry.  It was watchable but barely.  I'm glad I didn't pay a lot for it.....it's advertised as ""digitally remastered.""  Well it's a lousy job of remastering.",1518480000,,285,4.4423076923076925

7905446,1,B000009EJZ,"The story is a classic and this movie would have been great. Unfortunately, a terrible direct dub ruined it. One reviewer likened it to someone recording it from a DVD on their cell phone. That is far to generous. This was, in my opinion, a direct dub from an aging VHS tape recorded at EP/SLP. The system used was likely a home dubbing console. All the trade marks are there. Faded colors, lack of image sharpness (aka: image haze) and the horizontal jitter. A direct dub from film can be just as bad. However, the faults are a bit different and very recognizable. Jitter tends to be more vertical than horizontal; image haze is irrelevant since the sharpness of an image does not change as film ages; color fade can occur, but tends to worst at the beginning of the film and best at the end. And finally the most significant trait of direct film dubs is the terrible white balance. Film requires a much higher white balance than other media. As a result, direct dubs from film always results in extreme white balance issues. Outdoor scenes frequently suffer from complete white out.",1496188800,3,1084,4.6217616580310885
