8595057,1,B00DNJ9A42,This is not a film. I would call it a home video project.  It doesn't look like a film. The audio is awful. To put it honestly the production value is on par with what you would see on an episode of America's funniest home videos. The director tries to promote this as a bad film but bad as in fun b movie bad. No its not that either. It's  like as in sh+it equals sh*t bad. Don't waste your money. You can find great home made horror on YouTube for free,1517702400,,454,3.9239130434782608

8595059,5,B00DNJ9A42,"This movie will not make you want to go wandering around the countryside alone. Not that you should be doing so anyway, but you get my point. This hick starts killing people, which sounds simple enough, but it's the most disturbing sort of killing people ever. Nothing is scarier than a crazy redneck",1374969600,,300,4.679245283018868
8595060,4,B00DNJ9A42,"I watched this movie a while back & I thought it was a lot of fun, I't reminded me of an old Troma film, in fact Lloyd Kaufman is in this movie. I use to love to rent any horror movie I could find in the eighties & whenever I found something that was shot on video & bloody I knew I was in for a treat, this movie took me back to those times & was certainly a treat indeed.",1373155200,,373,3.617283950617284
