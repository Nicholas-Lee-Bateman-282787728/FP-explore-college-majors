Comes on DVDR and, while professionally done as in not some crappy label sticker or scribble with a felt pen, @ $40 it wouldve been nice to be told upfront ya know? Still, such cool stuff i would buy it again and feel it more a fault of Amazon than Mr. Friedman.",1327881600,,329,4.076923076923077
8154876,1,B000K7UBZW,"This DVD is impossible to follow without tabulature. It could take you an hour to figure out one riff. I was so annoyed that I emailed Marty Friedman. I told him, if you just add some tab it would be a great DVD. I asked him to send me some tab, NO REPLY yet. $43.50 with tax I can throw it in the garbage. What too much trouble to provide some tab for your customers.",1304899200,,368,3.92
8154877,5,B000K7UBZW,"I've only gone through the first couple licks on the dvd and it's already opened up my options on the fretboard. For a while, i've been stuck improvising only within scales, and basically Marty gets you out of that tendency with new notes and new ways to play them. Something I've really needed badly.

Other than the intro, this dvd is all business. One lick after another, first played fast, then slow, with separate close-ups of both hands. Again, I've only gone through the first handful of chapters and Marty has already influenced my lead playing. Very excited about this dvd.",1299715200,,582,4.762376237623762
8154878,4,B000K7UBZW,A great tool to improve your phrasing. If you improvise but always sound the same no matter what scale or mode you use this DVD will help.,1297814400,,138,4.148148148148148
8154879,5,B000K7UBZW,"I must have shelled out for a hundred of these darned instructional DVDs.  As a professional player with 15 years experience, I am constantly finding myself in one rut or another.  I wanted an instructional approach that didn't eat a ton of my time, that gave me new and interesting ideas right away, and that was above all PRACTICAL.

Marty delivers.  The content speaks for itself, but even the way the DVD is designed makes its use incredibly easy.  There are 99 tracks, each dedicated to a ""phrase.""  He doesn't talk your ear off about it; he just illustrates, slows it down, and repeats a few times, close-up on left hand, then close-up on right hand.  Then on to the next.  0% B.S.; you just get in there and do it.  I have owned this DVD for 48 hours, and it has already made a massive impact-- and I've only learned 10 phrases!

This DVD will shock you out of the routines of ""scale"" playing by SHOWING, instead of TELLING you how to break the ""rules"" a bit and make some interesting sounds.

Thanks, Marty!  I really hope other guitar players will adopt this approach to instructional videos.
