6262876,3,B00IF8Q404,in today's history not as amusing as it was.,1407715200,,44,4.0
6262877,1,B00IF8Q404,"I recall this being a funny movie, and it is, but the video quality is bad. Very bad quality.",1406851200,,93,3.9473684210526314
6262878,2,B00IF8Q404,Movie was good but the reproduction was messed up.,1405036800,,50,4.666666666666667
6262879,1,B00IF8Q404,"One of the worst quality video transfers I have ever seen.  Done by an amateur.  Pixillated and heavily artifacted.  ""Grainy"".  Bugs and errors in the DVD menuing and interface.  Really appalling color loss and horrible clarity.",1401840000,6,228,5.222222222222222
6262880,2,B00IF8Q404,I have seen poor copies of films from CHEEZY FLICKS before but they seem to have surpassed themselves in poor dubbing this time. It is a shame as this was a wonderful and very funny well made comedy with an outstanding cast. I give the film 5 stars but the transfer does not even deserve a zero. I hope in future that someone puts out a quality version of Viva Max.,1400976000,12,365,4.154929577464789
6262881,1,B00IF8Q404,Appears on your screen as if it was copied from awful television broadcast.  The VHS product has a much better image.  Horrible copy of wonderful movie.,1400803200,9,152,4.8076923076923075
6262882,1,B00IF8Q404,"Looks like a VHS transfer to me. There are some promos on the disc for other movies from ""CHEEZY FLICKS"" and they look even worse. I wonder if the region 2 release is any better?",1400716800,9,178,4.114285714285714
6262883,3,B00IF8Q404,"Although I'm very happy this longtime favorite is finally on DVD, I'm not happy that the DVD was done with no remastering and no additional features -- production notes, interviews, etc. -- after all these years. It does have a movie trailer. The video and audio quality are poor, like my old VHS copy. But we are enjoying it. One star for the DVD release, 4 stars for the movie itself. If you are a native Texan, you will enjoy the inside humor, especially about Baylor University. Also, seeing Peter Ustinov, Jonathan Winters, John Astin, Harry Morgan, Keenan Wynn, and others is a treat. EDIT: It seems the trailers section of the DVD is a mishmash of trailers for other movies, such as Convoy.",1400544000,14,697,4.629032258064516
6262923,5,B00IF8Q404,Love this movie. I saw it as a teenager and it was hilarious. I loved Pamela Tiffin one of my favorite actresses . Thank you again for finding this great gem .Cathy,1486080000,2,164,4.15625
6262924,1,B00IF8Q404,Very poor transfer looks like a bad DVD transfer would not buy from this vendor again,1485993600,,85,4.375
6262925,5,B00IF8Q404,The DVD arrived as described and in the shipping arrival time specified.,1485561600,,72,5.083333333333333
6262926,4,B00IF8Q404,Love it,1479340800,,7,3.0
6262927,5,B00IF8Q404,Item arrived timely and was as described.  Thank you very much.,1470268800,,63,4.7272727272727275
6262928,2,B00IF8Q404,"Funny, forgotten movie. Unfortunately, the recording quality is low and fuzzy.",1468972800,,78,6.181818181818182
6262929,3,B00IF8Q404,"The movie was as I remembered it from years ago.  However, the quality was terrible.  It was blurry and the colors were mostly purple and green.  No tweeking of my TV helped.",1468713600,,174,4.375
6262930,5,B00IF8Q404,A great cast and a fun ride.,1461024000,,28,3.142857142857143
6262931,5,B00IF8Q404,Funnier than I remembered!,1455753600,,26,5.75
6262932,4,B00IF8Q404,You can't dislike Peter Ustinov in a movie! It's a clever story with great characters. Enjoy!,1454284800,,93,4.875
6262943,1,B00IF8Q404,Fantastic movie but the worst transfer I have ever seen.  I got a better transfer from my VHS to a DVR than this.,1453248000,,113,3.9130434782608696
6262944,3,B00IF8Q404,"I loved the movie, but the quality of the DVD is atrocious.  The sound is good but the picture is extremely muddy.  There are dropouts throughout, and even one place where part of the same scene is repeated.  There has to be a better print out there somewhere.",1452470400,,260,4.375
6262945,1,B00IF8Q404,"My son bought this for me...The transfer is horrible...The movie is jerky, sometimes out of focus & sound is horrible....I wish my son could get his hard earned money back...Why the hell doesn't Amazon check the quality of the DVD's before they allow them to be sold on their site?",1448323200,,281,4.64
6262946,5,B00IF8Q404,very good entertainment,1446854400,,23,7.0
6262947,5,B00IF8Q404,i can not find odd ball movies like this . love it,1442534400,,50,3.25
6262948,4,B00IF8Q404,"I had not seen this movie for 30 years. I'd remembered it as a funny picture, and it still is. If you like movies like ""The Russians are Coming"", you'd like this",1439424000,,161,4.0625
6262949,5,B00IF8Q404,"Fantastic what if story. The picked only serious actors for this politically correct film on manifest destiny. Peter Ustinov is General Maximilian Rodrigues de Santo. Although the story revolves around him many others help carry the story such as John Astin Sergeant Valdez who keeps the general out of trouble and Jonathan Winters as General Billy Joe Hallson of the National Guard.
This film was actually made in San Antonio. Written by Lehrer, James

Basic story is Mexican general is going to retake the Alamo as an act of heroism for his men.",1436486400,,547,4.881720430107527
6262950,5,B00IF8Q404,"I saw this movie years ago and was happy to be able to find it on DVD. The picture quality isn't all that good but it is still as funny as ever. The password, ""Richard Widmark,"" has been a family tradition for years.",1435363200,,216,4.046511627906977
6262951,1,B00IF8Q404,"Okay, I just had go back after some thought as to what was the point of all this?  Well, as Ustinov said after being shot at nearly the very end of the film, ""There is only so much that a man can take.""  Ustinov portrayed a very proud well meaning but very sensitive man whose pride was hurt so he takes over the Alamo to prove that his men are loyal to him and that he is not an inept general.  It is only after being shot, that he proves his worth and his point. This film of course was made when everything was fair game to make fun of namely the subject of stereotypes and in this case its a lot of the stereotypes about Texas and Mexico and of the people who live there.",1431388800,,675,3.948529411764706
6262952,3,B00IF8Q404,Funny movie great looks of San Antonio back in the late sixties. How time flies Filming at the Alamo is no longer allowed.,1431302400,,122,4.3478260869565215
6262963,3,B00IF8Q404,Resolution quality was poor. Like it was copied from a VHS tape.,1429056000,,64,4.416666666666667
6262964,2,B00IF8Q404,"This is not the real deal.  It is mastered from a VHS tape.  I mastered this myself a few years ago from a VHS tape using Adobe Premier and I can't tell the difference between mine and this one.  It is a great tongue -in-cheek comedy with great performances by Peter Ustinov, John Astin and Jonathan Winters - especially John Astin.  If you must have this movie - OK.  Hopefully a legit version mastered from original sources will be done.",1426550400,,439,4.4375
6262965,4,B00IF8Q404,A very funny story that doesn't come around at all on TV or cable,1425254400,,65,3.7142857142857144
6262966,4,B00IF8Q404,Disappointed with the music. NOt the dealers fault.,1417305600,,51,5.5
6262967,5,B00IF8Q404,"Bound to richly entertain.  An imaginative plot (which I won't spoil by describing here). Stellar actors and intertwining military and paramilitary actions that will keep you laughing, yet a touching emotional drama underneath.
The rich setting? The Alamo in San Antonio!",1417305600,,271,5.609756097560975
6262968,5,B00IF8Q404,Super old classic movie.  Well written comedy with a fantastic cast,1416355200,,67,5.090909090909091
6262969,3,B00IF8Q404,"Excellent film, almost cult classic nowadays, tarnished only by the poor quality ""cheezy flicks 2014"" transfer, from what looks like an old video master, poor color-quality-and skips with the playback at 3 places (that I noticed) with a terrible ""tear line"" drop out cross screen at the opening....this is clearly the 'dump a cheapie' version sadly...oh well, a tide us over until perhaps a blu ray remaster does it justice...the NTSC VHS version quality,  bees-whisker better...nice to be able to get it, with options limited.",1410134400,,527,5.2
6262970,3,B00IF8Q404,Sort of a dumb movie that I bought on the recommendation of a friend.  We have different taste.,1409788800,,95,4.277777777777778
6262971,3,B00IF8Q404,Good classic ; Bad copy. Costly  for that type  of burn,1408579200,,55,3.909090909090909
6262972,4,B00IF8Q404,its an out of date funny movie. the premise is a hoot. it actually upset a lot of people,1408060800,,88,3.6842105263157894
8641809,2,B00IF8Q404,"Great forgotten comedy with superior comedy cast.  Funny, funny, funny.  BUT the picture quality is terrible.  Small screen presentation of a wide screen film apparently dubbed from an old VHS tape.  The old VHS was probably sourced from a drive in theater print that had been run through the projector 25 thousand times.  I was hoping to find it on BluRay.  Or at least a decent copy of standard DVD quality.  Will keep looking for a clean copy of this one",1524614400,,457,4.567901234567901
8641810,3,B00IF8Q404,"One of my favorite movies of all time.  Ustinov and Winters are amazing.  But agree with the many other reviewers that the DVD copy is horrible.  Almost looks like someone filmed it off a TV playing a VHS.  I suppose this is the only way to get a copy of the movie, but wish there was a real studio version.  At least they did a decent job on the cover art.",1521676800,,357,3.971830985915493
8641811,3,B00IF8Q404,Movie is good! Copy a little choppy,1520985600,,35,4.142857142857143
8641812,5,B00IF8Q404,very funny,1509753600,,10,4.5
8641813,1,B00IF8Q404,"The product itself was as advertised. No issues there. The movie, however, was horrible. Like it should be on MST3K horrible. I wanted to like it, I really did, but it was terrible. I was sort of hoping for a ""The Russians Are Coming! The Russians are Coming"" type of comedy. Nope. I see that some folks love the movie, and I understand that we all have different tastes. ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" is one of my favorites, as is ""Smokey and the Bandit"" and any Bugs Bunny cartoon.
This movie...not so much.",1507593600,,510,4.322916666666667
8641814,4,B00IF8Q404,Funny. Wonder if you could do a movie like this today?,1498348800,,54,4.0
8641815,4,B00IF8Q404,"Hilarious movie from my childhood. Although nowadays some of the racial
stereotypes might seem offensive to some (lack of Latinos in key roles) it also makes fun of Anglo Texans (Alice Ghostly, Harry Morgan, Jonathan Winters) but it's a great premise carried out by a host of 60's character actors. Not that good of a transfer and no subtitles for elderly folks but I've been looking for it off and on for so long, that, I enjoyed the heck out of it.
Also too I've never seen anything with Peter Ustinov in it that I didn't enjoy. And Jonathan Winters for that matter.",1492387200,,568,4.524271844660194
8641816,5,B00IF8Q404,Item as described.  A little corny but I was in town when they were filming the movie.,1490227200,,86,4.0588235294117645
8641817,3,B00IF8Q404,"Wish I could select 2.5 stars since the original move is good, but the audio/video quality and some unnecessary editing of this version totally killed it. What got me the most was the editing. In one scene the General and Sergeant both clearly say ""whorehouse"" and both times the whore part of that word is muted. There were also times where it seemed like the fast forward button was accidentally hit during the editing and copying of the movie.",1490054400,,446,4.658227848101266
8641818,2,B00IF8Q404,"Very poor quality.  It appears to be broadcast TV captured on home VHS and then converted to DVD.  Noticeable skips and slow spots.  Poor audio quality and poor picture quality.  Very sad, because I love the movie itself.",1487548800,,221,4.7368421052631575
