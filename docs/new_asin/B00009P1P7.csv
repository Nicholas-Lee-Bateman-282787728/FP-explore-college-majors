7992318,1,B00009P1P7,I liked the cars and the hair styles and clothing the best. I wonder why when the main character returned to the house and called for the butler and maid they could not be found. He looks up to see the light shaking. Was it implied they were....  it was a strange movie,1517270400,,269,4.0754716981132075
7992319,2,B00009P1P7,"Somewhat interesting but it never quite gets off the ground.  It's fun to see the cars and styles of that era, and the music too, though the pace is a little slow.  Plot problems include nothing happening when the guy is run off the road and killed (spoiler alert!) - I mean, the police never come, no one is to blame, no one is really that upset.  And the ending, though sad, just doesn't seem like justice was done.  I tried to give it 3 stars but the sound quality was so poor that I had to turn on the closed captions in order to understand the dialogue.  If this movie is worth having available on Prime, then couldn't someone remaster the soundtrack?",1475366400,,656,4.300813008130081

7992321,5,B00009P1P7,"High School Caesar is a B-Film starring John Ashley. Teenage gang goes bad, going from cheating on tests, extortion, and murder. Hosted by the Fabulous Mamie Van Doren. She is funnier than Elvira. I have met Mamie and she is so nice to her fans. I admire her for her stand on women's and gay rights. A living legend and one of the last stars of the Golden Age of Hollywood.",1395619200,,373,4.267605633802817
7992322,2,B00009P1P7,"This movie is so predictable and cheaply made, but Reggie Perkins did an excellent job singing ""High School Caesar.""  He also sang the title ""Date Bait Baby"".  Reggie and I worked in Miami Beach area during the 50's Rock n Roll days.  His singing is good....(when he's good,) but it can be bad when he's bad.  For instance, I played keyboard and Reggie had a terrible habit of starting a song in the wrong key.  Once he got started there was no way of getting him in the right key.  Our band, ""The Rockin Maniacs"" solved the ""off key"" problem by giving him strong introductions to every song he sang.  That did the trick and soon his singing was very good.  Like I said,  ""Bad movie"" but I think Reggie did a good job in the opening credits singing ""High School Caesar"".  Personally, I thought the music in ""Date Bait Baby"" was better.

7992323,3,B00009P1P7,"This movie is one i had wondered about finding for years. I was an extra in it when i was 17 years old back when it was filmed in Chilicothe, MO. in 1956. It is not as I remember but then that has been many years ago. I thought  that I would not even be found in it but I was, just in one scene toward the end but it made it wortth every cent I spent. My best friend was also in the movie, she is in 2 scenes. We neither had speaking parts but that didn't matter. The movie is not a real popular movie but who cares, when they were part of it?",1174348800,2,543,3.6810344827586206
7992324,2,B00009P1P7,"Yawn! I love JD films (and not in that annoying, condescending ""ironic"" way! Screw you Mystery Science Theater!)...Anyway, this is just below average. Everyone is far too polite. There aren't any hot rods or custom cars. The clothes aren't that great. No cool slang. The dancing is dull. It's sorta neat to see John Ashley before he went on to the Beach Party movies, but really this just doesn't have much going for it. If you're looking for some good JD/Rockabilly/Hot Rod 50's films, I'd recommend ""Running Wild"", ""Rock Baby Rock It"" or ""High School Confidential"" for starters. Enjoy!",1141776000,2,587,4.9393939393939394
7992325,4,B00009P1P7,"If you liked ""High School Confidential,"" if you sat through ""Teenage Strangler,"" if you couldn't get enough of ""Girl's Town,"" daddy-o you'll dig ""High School Caesar."" In this  lawless tale of teenage delinquency, Mat Stephens (John Ashley) leads a  ring of beatnik greaser thugs down a dragstrip destined for disaster.  Teenage rebellion fostered by the conspicuous absence of parental  supervision leads to hijinks on the road, at the malt shop and in the  locker room.  Stephens, a spoiled rich kid, rigs a high school election  and, with his Jerry Lewis-esque sidekick Cricket, holds the hallways  hostage.  After a tragic drag race, Stephens confronts his true nature in a  ""far-out"" denouement that will leave you reeling with laughter.  This movie is above and beyond the typical teenage exploitation because it  not only maintains a wonderfully awful B-movie story, but also entertains.  Look for Ashley in other great camp fare such as ""Beach Party""  and ""Bikini Beach."" A definite must for B-movie, drive-in fans.",963014400,17,1022,5.228395061728395
