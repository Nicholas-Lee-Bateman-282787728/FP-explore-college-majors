8133441,5,B000GNOGR4,Hilarious documentary with low production value but a lot of heart.,1426723200,,67,5.181818181818182
8133442,5,B000GNOGR4,"Despite the hopelessly rundown surroundings these people live in and the obvious substance and mental health issues some appear to struggle with, they still have joy, purpose, humor, opinions and feelings.  This is an interesting, funny and touching documentary.",1422921600,,262,5.717948717948718
8133443,1,B000GNOGR4,This is not the Southbridge I remember.  I don't know how this could have won an award at any film festival.,1403827200,,108,4.142857142857143
8133444,3,B000GNOGR4,"I moved to Southbridge when I was nineteen, and never warmed up to the town. When people said, ""Oh, you're from Southbridge?"" I quickly pointed out that I'd grown up elsewhere, and had only lived in Southbridge for X amount of years. I did that for NINETEEN YEARS -- half my life to that point -- and finally told myself, ""Start saying you're FROM Southbridge, or MOVE.""

I moved.

Having said that... Since my move, I've worked in Southbridge, and my sister and mother live there now as well. So I'm very familiar with many of the people and places in this documentary. I found it a bit unsettling to watch. There are some real offbeat characters in the film, resulting in some intentional or accidental humor, but at times you have to wonder if there was an innate mean-spiritedness in showcasing some of the town's weirdness.

I'd recommend the film, but with reservations.",1216166400,,876,4.675324675324675
8133445,5,B000GNOGR4,"A harrowing array of toothless prophets, minimum-wage morlocks, stew bums, and old-timers huddle together against the implacable sucking maw of ennui that pervades a Massachusetts city in decline. There is indeed truth in the heroin-fueled philosophies and right-wing ramblings of these characters. Greater Southbridge is a story of redemption, nickel and otherwise. (Keep your eyes peeled for the inexplicable cameo by Abe Vigoda at a Boston night club.)",1193616000,,455,5.705882352941177
8133446,4,B000GNOGR4,Rod murphy did a great job on this film. i coudn't stop watching it !. It was funny and at the same time pulled at your heartstrings. Would love to see a where are they now version !,1175299200,,182,3.8157894736842106
8133447,5,B000GNOGR4,"I accidentally caught Greater Southbridge at a film festival in 2003 (where it won the audience award) and loved it.

GS is a documentary about life in a small Massachusetts town. It focuses on some of the odd, eccentric people who live there. The film's stand-out personality is ""Jerry"" who is passionate about recylcing aluminum cans and wants to start an all-girl band.

If you are a fan of American Movie, Crumb, or documentaries about interesting, eccentric people, you'll love Greater Southbridge.",1165881600,,503,5.121951219512195
