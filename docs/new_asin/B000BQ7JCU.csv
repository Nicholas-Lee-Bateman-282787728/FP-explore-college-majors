8091070,4,B000BQ7JCU,"La Ciguena Distraida Viruta y Capulina A REALLY FUNNY DUO from Mexico's cinema during the 60's. Pleasant to revisit my childhood @ a Sunday matinee on a big screen theatre. Viruta y Capulina were the equivalent to a spanish Abbott  Costello funny  comedic duo. Their banter would elicit just the right kind of innocent childish laughter THOSE WERE THE DAYS OF TRUE CLASSIC COMEDY FUN NOT INSULTS LIKE MODERN COMEDY. A funny story of 2 sets of twins switched at birth. One pair of twins rich, the other pair humble and a hilarious case of mistaken identities to keep you laughing for 90 minutes!!! Viruta y Capulina were a comedic mexican duo that had a long film career & they even had a weekly variety show comparable to that of Ms. Carol Burnett with special guest stars & singers. In their movies they would always be paired with really beautiful young actresses also popular at the time. In La Ciguena Distraida they act with 2 of the most gorgeous ladies in mexican cinema during the 60's: Ms. Rosa Maria Vazquez (el bom-bom!!!!) & Ms. Emily Cranz who was also a singer (ultra sexy!!!!) BUYER BEWARE: THE CASE THE MOVIE COMES IN AS SOLD BY THE MANUFACTURER SAYS A ""COLOR"" FILM BUT ACTUALLY IS A MOVIE THAT WAS SHOT IN BLACK & WHITE. ONLY THE PICTURES ON THE COVER HAVE BEEN ""COLORIZED"". Still the film & sound transfer are clear, could have used subtitles to reach a wider audience that are fans of true classic comedy. GRAB THE POPCORN & HAVE A FUNNY HILARIOUS TIME WITH VIRUTA y CAPULINA!!!!!",1422489600,,1499,4.58955223880597
8091071,3,B000BQ7JCU,"La Ciguena Distraida/The Absent Minded Stork(1966)is a fun comedy starring Viruta and Capulina, even if it is a rehash of Vagabundo y Millonario(1959). Viruta and Capulina play two country bumpkins who walk to Mexico City. When they're mistaken for two rich, powerful, identical looking twins also named Viruta and Capulina, all hell breaks loose!
In the plus column, the namesake theme song(La Ciguena Distaida)is very catchy and super sexy babe Emily Cranz adds a sense of fun to the movie.
This DVD is worth the money!",1236384000,2,521,5.069767441860465
