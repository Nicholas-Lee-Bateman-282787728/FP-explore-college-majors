2456314,4,B000CCBCI0,I don't mind the fact that CBS/ Paramount have given us the same DVDs that they already released in the single season box sets. That is fine No probs there. We could have been given the full series of the Brady Kids too. But my big complaint is the packaging that I was so excited about from the time I first had seen internet pictures of it. I think being that they had the discs that it would not have been to much to ask to have made the packaging a lot more sturdy and also the disc to be held in much better casing. The outside shag carpet is great but the Brady Bunch Flower on front and the side view would have been awesome to have been made to look like it was one of those retro puffy stickers! That is what it looked so good that way. I just think it cost Paramount 3.00 to make a box to carry discs they already had released. I still ove the set and am aware of the bonus disc. I wish Paramount would send us all  amuch sturdier more thought out case and packaging for the discs. Some seem to have problems with damged/ scratched discs.,1175558400,12,1048,4.06280193236715
2456315,4,B000CCBCI0,"Well it was almost complete.

The packaging looks beautiful, nice and psychadelic sixties style.

By all means buy this, if you love the original series. All the episodes are complete. It saves a lot of searching for season by season releases. It's just a pity they didn't include all the Brady Kids episodes.

OK FANS. LET'S KEEP ASKING THEM TO RELEASE THE BRADY KIDS SERIES IN FULL (all 22 episodes).",1175558400,3,402,4.714285714285714
2456316,4,B000CCBCI0,"Brady fans rejoice!  The entire series, all 5 seasons, of The Brady Bunch is finally available in one compact, shag-a-riffic DVD Collector Set.

Let me start off with a word of warning for anyone who has purchased any of the individual season sets: The first 20 discs that comprise all 5 seasons are the exact same discs that you will find inside the individual season sets; Same disc art, same previews, same discs period.  The 21st disc, however, is the all-new ""exclusive to this set"" DVD of special features.  On this disc, you'll find the movies ""The Brady 500"" (the pilot for the series ""The Bradys"") and ""A Very Brady Christmas"" in addition to a 2-part episode of ""The Brady Kids"" cartoon.  ""The Brady 500"" runs 88 minutes, ""A Very Brady Christmas"" runs 94 minutes and each cartoon runs a little over 21 minutes.  All together they total 3 hours 45 minutes of Brady wonderment, not available anywhere else.  For the closing logo enthusiasts out there, you will be saddened to know that the original closing logos on both movies have been replaced by the current CBS Paramount logo.  The cartoons do have their original Filmation and Paramount logos though, followed by the current CBS Paramount logo.

Now, the packaging... The Complete Series comes in a thin, clear outer box, with a small hole on the front so you can feel a bit of the ""shag carpet"" covering 3 sides of the inner, more sturdy box.  Once you remove the clear outer shell, you'll find that the inner ""shag"" box opens like a cigar box.  The inside flap houses a booklet that slides in from the top.  This booklet serves the same purpose that the slim cases for the individual seasons do, to list which episodes are on which discs.  Everything is great up to this point, until you see how the discs themselves are packaged.  All 21 discs are housed in what can only be described as an ""expandable/collapsable file folder"" style sleeve, which is held in place with a clear plastic lid (same material as the outer box).  Basically, the disc holders are 21 small, flimsy ""card stock"" sleeves, glued together at the bottoms.  Unfortunately, the glue used to hold these together is a very soft, gummy glue that left a sticky residue on a handful of my discs.  Even worse, by housing the discs in sleeves, half of my discs arrived with light to medium scratches on them.

On the individual season sets, Paramount uses 2 slim cases, each holding 2 discs.  Since the episode discs are the same in this set as in the individual seasons, I almost feel that it's better to get them that way.  But, individual seasons means no ""special features"" disc.  Plus, this complete series set does come at quite the savings compared to purchasing the seasons individually.

So, the question you need to ask yourself is ""How big of a Brady fan am I?""  Is the extra disc worth 20 other possibly scratched, sticky discs?  If you are a completist or collector, the answer should be a definite yes!  If you're a casual fan who owns any or all of the individual sets, it might be a firm maybe.

But, as for me, I'm glad I bought it.",1175299200,317,3077,4.579524680073126
2456317,4,B000CCBCI0,"Growing up in the '80s, I used to watch the show in reruns. Cheese factor aside, I still loved the Bradys. Who wouldn't be envious of all those kids and their assorted adventures, in a spacious house that was mysteriously never the tiniest bit messy despite all those kids? Mom Carol was always home, graciously sporting the latest '70s fashions and doing nothing in particular, necesitating the presence of housekeeper and all-around family adviser Alice. Dog Tiger bounded about on the Astroturf lawn, and someone - Carol? - in this eight-person household actually had time to curl little Cindy's pigtails every morning.

What, you mean I can only give this item five stars?  But a DVD set like this deserves at least ten stars!  It's so nice to see the complete episodes, for a change.  I really liked it when Greg had to take Bobby to the drive-in on his date with the new girl, Rachel (Hope Sherwood).  Bobby asks, ""You wouldn't want sweetie-pie to get wet, would you?""  (He just opened an umbrella, because it might rain.)  This was the ""Big Bet"" episode, one of my all-time favorites!",1143072000,9,597,4.258928571428571
2456331,5,B000CCBCI0,"I have to agree with other criticisms about the packaging.  The shag carpet was badly conceived.  And the inner arrangement of the DVDs is pretty awful, too.  The DVDs just kind of slide into these flimsy thin card stock-type flowers.  And it isn't really obvious figuring out where each disc belongs.  However, this set comes with the extra spin off episodes.  So that's a plus.  I bought this for my kids (10 and 11)  for Christmas, and they watched it all through Christmas vacation.  Our local TV station has been showing Brady Bunch reruns on the weekends, and my daughter was always disappointed if she had to miss it when it was on.  I grew up watching the Brady Bunch, but now that my own kids are enjoying it I realize there's a reason why this show has had staying power.  It's a simple concept, but it's well written, there is good chemistry between the characters, and I like how the kids articulate their emotions as they deal with various problems.  This one ended up being one of the best and most used Christmas gifts of the year.",1484006400,2,1046,4.50531914893617

I grew up with the Brady Bunch so it's really fun to share and relive it with my kids. The shag fabric-covered box is pretty flimsy, and the discs are separated by thin paperboard flaps inside that do not instill confidence for any protection. I'm not sure how long this set will last due to this flimsy-ness, unfortunately. But from what I've read this set has some extra episodes/shows that the other set offered on Amazon doesn't so we went with this one despite complaints about the packaging. I suppose even if we only watch all the discs through once, it's still worth the price because it is great time together with my kids laughing and explaining things like what a telephone operator was!",1471478400,,805,4.629370629370629

2456353,4,B000CCBCI0,"Is The Brady Bunch an embarrassing, outdated relic from our childhoods  or is it actually an endearing show with great characters and a lot of charming moments?

Thats what I was wondering myself, and after watching a number of episodes from each season I have come to a definitive answer: The Brady Bunch is a blast from the past in all of the right ways.  Most of the stories have great set-ups and genuinely lighthearted, funny moments.  The actors were all perfectly cast and they each grew into their roles  even Susan Olsen as Cindy!  The Brady Bunch is not high entertainment nor was it ever meant to be.  Its great escapist fun that manages to sneak in moral lessons and goodwill all in under a half hours time.

One thing that actually surprised me watching it again is seeing just how much the kids fight and how often Mike and Carol have to referee some pretty thorny situations.  Robert Reed remains my favorite actor and character on the show; although he has been portrayed as something of a doofus in a lot of spoofs, by-and-large Mike Brady was a pretty firm dad who got annoyed with too many shenanigans, and his little pep talks are usually spot-on (if a bit simplistic at times  see the Hawaiian episodes finale for a perfect example).  Carol has to deliver some super-corny lines, but again, shes not as grating as shes been made out to be.  Florence Henderson seems like a woman with a great sense of humor.

My one big frustration with the series is that I wish Eve Plumb, who played Jan, would be a little more game when discussing the show.  Even in the fifth season  she was just so endearingly awkward (while simultaneously turning out to be a really cute teenager).  Ms. Plumb is cagey and borderline rude when people ask her for anecdotes, and I wish she would just say something positive.  My guess is that she was cast because of her acting chops and slightly quirkiness, and as the series continued these qualities of hers were exploited by the writers and producers.  Still, Jan / Eve had a charming demeanor and I wish shes do more to own the fact that yes  its actually her on the screen  and that yes, some of her personality came through!

Oh yes, and Id consider forking out a bit more for the shag carpet version.

LIL' UPDATE: Having now seen some of ""The Brady Brides"" and ""The Bradys"" episodes, I have to give Eve Plumb a complete pass on not wanting to do reunion events.  After the cancellation of the original run, what the Schwartzes allowed happen to their creation is disgraceful.  Another caveat I'd give to the original review is that I may have overstated the overall consistency and love with which the characters were treated.  Ann B. Davis was given some atrocious jokes to deliver, while Jan's character shows some glaring inconsistencies over the run of the show.  In season three, she turns out to be a paragon of virtue when fessing up to not getting the best grade on a school paper.  But then a mere two years later she's acting like a complete scumbag when running for class president (or is it miss popularity?).  So it's best just to take the series on a show-by-show basis, understanding that there are some truly lame episodes.",1461196800,,3191,4.570422535211268

2456386,5,B000CCBCI0,My daughter was introduced to the Brady Bunch by a teacher in 3rd grade and LOVED this as a gift. My complaint is that it isn't available on Apple TV (or wasn't at that time) to take it on the go easier.,1429660800,,203,3.857142857142857
2456387,2,B000CCBCI0,"seems like sometime around january 2014 the packaging changed a bit to get rid of the glue problem.  Although the set I just received had no glue issues (I am not even sure there is glue in the sleeve at this point--not that I could see anyway), the discs were scratched and had fingerprints.  So I guess they (the distributor) took their glue-returns and repackaged the surviving disks?  Not really sure...All I know is that my 'new' set didn't appear new at all despite being shrinkwrapped...even the inner packaging had dirt and smudges on it..",1429574400,,547,4.7368421052631575

2456400,4,B000CCBCI0,"I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because of the way the dvds are packaged.  The outside packaging with the carpet is cute.  However, inside the discs are held in thin cardstock flower holders.  It is sort of like a Rolodex.  Each flower is constructed of two pieces of card stock and glued together.  So far I haven't run into the problems with the glue on the discs as others have stated.  (We haven't watched all discs yet).  I think it's possible that some people may accidentally be putting the discs back inside where the two flower pieces are glued?  We are on the last season and it's more difficult getting to the last season of discs.  Sometimes all of the flowers don't always fold back into place like they should.  I was worried after reading the other reviews about the glue but I'm glad I decided to give this a try.  The price is good too.  I bought the set for my 8 year old daughter since I loved this show when I was her age.  She loves it too.  If you decide to buy this set, just be careful when taking out the discs and putting them back and you shouldn't have any problems with the glue.  I will update this later if I run into any problems.",1424736000,10,1167,4.217194570135747

The one thing I don't love is the impractical packaging. While, so far, all of the discs have played just fine, I would have rather had less shag carpeting and more protection for the DVDs.  The case doesn't stay closed.  The shag carpet container does not slide easily into the plastic box that holds the whole thing shut.

After unsuccessfully trying to watch episodes on youtube, I searched on Amazon and found this lovely compilation.  I bought this for myself to celebrate my birthday and we watched several DVDs together as a family.  Shortly after I bought this, my kids were sick and spent a lot of time in bed watching movies on portable DVD players.  What did they reach for?  The Brady Bunch.  I think each kid has now seen all or nearly all of the episodes.  They loved it enough to keep watching on their own, even when their mom wasn't forcing them to.  Anyway, long story (""of a lovely lady..."") short, this is well worth owning if you are a big Brady fan.",1420416000,4,806,4.398648648648648

I felt sorry for Jan as she was the middle kid like me but I loved her hair.  I used to wish I had long blonde hair like that.  Cindy seemed awfully big for the way they dressed her and her hairstyle.  The things they made Marsha do on the show had to cause her trauma as a teen, but but this show had good morals and brought back amazing memories.  The boys were also typical of what kids were like back then.  The parents were helpless without Alice's help.  I liked Alice, she was very kind and seemed part of the family.  I love this DVD set and absolutely loved the green shag carpet that the set was wrapped in.  What a brilliant idea!

For the price Amazon is selling this at, it's a very good value. 121 episodes, fun packaging, bonus disc, and remastered quality all make for good value. My girlfriend and I have been watching the Brady Bunch on Directv, and the quality on these discs is substantially improved. Even the earliest episodes, which is what we started with.

2456475,1,B000CCBCI0,"This series was obviously written, produced and performed as a device to occupy time between commercials.  The characters personify the era of plastic personalities, the storylines never relate to the reality of the nation and the world in its time, and the situations are intentionally one-dimensional, probably designed to appeal to a juvenile audience.  Did anyone ever notice that the mother of three girls never once, in five years, helped her daughters with their hair, their makeup, their wardrobes?  Instead, it is obvious that this family was staged and sustained by a fashion-conscious wardrobe department at their studio.  The final disc, the final episode is the lamest.  The series just quits and disappears.  No finality, no future.  Since we paid for it, we watched all of it.  But now we never have to do that again.

2456515,5,B000CCBCI0,"Absolutely the best DVD--movie or series--I have ever purchased!! The picture quality far exceeded my expectations and needless to say, the content was superb. Each time I watch an episode its as if I'm right there in the Brady household with the Brady's. I was only a casual observer of the show when it aired back in the 1970's, an opinion that has dramatically changed as I now enjoy the show immensely. Perhaps some of this change is merely due to nostalgia, but most of it is due to the appreciation of watching a truly high quality show. One free from the violence, hatred, obscenities , disrespect and sexual connotations that permeate the air waves today!

I was also pleasantly surprised by the elaborate manner in which the discs and accompanying materials were packaged. While I was expecting  a simple box containing a stack of DVD's, instead I received a most unique and quite beautiful carpet covered box quite worthy of being on display by itself!

In closing, I would HIGHLY recommend ""The Brady Bunch"" to anyone interested in a source of good, clean wholesome entertainment which--as an added bonus--also demonstrates the way of life from a most cherished and beloved bygone era sorely lacking in todays pathetic world!",1395100800,2,1236,4.904306220095694

2456578,5,B000CCBCI0,"Once I got past the Breaking Bad purchases for Christmas in a good way, I decided to treat myself to this charming sitcom, which ran on ABC-TV from 1969-74.  Of course, in researching reviews previously made regarding the glue issue, I had concerns about how this would play out for me come XMAS morning.  Well, here it is, XMAS morning...and I am happy to report, knock on wood, that there is no glue issue on any of my discs.  I have played only one episode on one of the discs thus far, which was the XMAS episode from the series' first season.  Be it that particular episode aired in 1969, I was surprised when I made the selection that a cast photo came on first.  Originally, I thought it was something inherent in the DVD itself...until I learned that it was an original tag of the series being presented ""IN COLOR"".  Gee, imagine that!!!!!!  I never truly saw that coming at all!!!!  But I also remember that TV Guide used to have the color insignia next to its color program listings as late as this year before eventually dropping that distinction not long thereafter.  But to have a Brady Bunch episode lead with an ""IN COLOR"" tag is truly a pleasant surprise indeed!!!!  I am looking forward to reacquainting myself with this series I remember fondly in my youth as I welcome The Bradys into my TV DVD collection and my home as well!!!!!  This is going to be a lot of fun!!!!!",1387929600,3,1388,4.446640316205533

The discs were between paper flowers, still a little flimsy because the discs can just fall out if you aren't careful, but that's better than the glue issue people were having.

The worst case scenario is that I have 21 defective discs and I'm out 43 bucks.  But, I kept my fingers crossed and received the package in short 3 days.  I thoroughly examined everything.

Instead of repeating the description of how the discs are packaged (as many other customers have kindly done), I'd just like to note that I really cannot -visibly- locate where the glue would be used in the ""floral"" sleeves.  Even with my obsessive-compulsive disorder, I am convinced that this packaging is fantastic.

MAYBE the current batches of this Brady Bunch collection have improved in response to numerous complaints?  As for the few recent complaints, those unfortunate customers may have received the defective leftovers... If you're amongst those individuals, I encourage you to exchange your set.

That being said, once you receive this set and see how the discs are packaged, one would have to believe these were inserted into their individual pockets by hand hence some discs appear to have slight oil residue from someone's finger as they packaged some of the discs.  They are loose within these pockets which would go on to explain any slight scratching which may be occurring.  My extras disc was included...I read one review which stated they did not receive their extras disc.  The shag carpet case is AWESOME!!!  It has to be seen in person to truly appreciate it.

2456640,5,B000CCBCI0,"I held out on buying this set for the longest time for two reasons: I'm not a Brady superfan (I like the show but I can easily go years without watching it and not have withdrawals) and the reviews about the packaging terrified me. There's nothing worse than spending a boatload of money on a huge DVD set only to have not work. I am happy to report that all the problems others encountered with glue and unplayable discs did not happen to me. I don't know if it's because Paramount fixed the shoddy packaging or because I didn't buy this via Amazon (perhaps Amazon gets a different batch?), but there are no glue issues and my disc play fine.

All that said, I won't bore readers with an in-depth review of the actual show. If you're over the age of ten, you likely know what The Brady Bunch is about. Episodes are sweet, simple and a bit campy. There are many instances of bad hair (Greg and Mrs. Brady) and awful clothes (all the men!) and a good solid lesson to be learned at the end of each episode (ie don't play ball in the house, fire safety is important). The Brady Bunch is one of those great, feel good shows that you can throw on and just let the sugar syrupy goodness rush over you.

The main draw for me was the special features. I've been longing to rewatch the 1988 television film A Very Brady Christmas for years now and I finally(!) have the entire movie on DVD. Yes, it's a very corny and attempts to bring the Bradys into the 1980s is kind of hilarious but there is something comforting and downright sweet about it. Also included are two episodes of the animated series The Brady Kids. I wasn't alive when this originally aired and, I presume, this never aired in syndication or in a very limited market because I've never seen it. It's your run of the mill, somewhat terrible Filmation cartoon version of the show. It's interesting for the purpose of nostalgia but this is not one of the many Brady spin-offs that I think people are chomping at the bit for. Last on the special feature list is The Brady 500, a two hour television film which is actually two episodes of the huge failure that was The Bradys. In case you're not in the loop, the success of A Very Brady Christmas lead to creation of comedy/drama series The Bradys that aired briefly in 1990. It was intended to be an updated version of The Brady Bunch with touches (or shall I say huge slaps) of dramatic elements as hour long dramas were popular television staples at the time. While I was fully aware of A Very Brady Christmas at the time it was released, I don't recall The Bradys. Judging by how long it lasted, I'll venture a guess that other people weren't aware of it either. Without giving too much away, The Brady 500 takes a few risks storyline-wise that probably left audiences a bit confused and weirded out. Bad things just don't happen to the Bradys and it's a bit disconcerting to see them facing bad things. The Brady 500 is a bit painful to watch because some of the acting is terrible (as is the theme song that is poorly written and bellowed out by Florence ""Mrs. Mike Brady"" Henderson) but it's an interesting and somewhat odd period at the end of the Brady sentence.

Now, for the bad aspects. I honestly don't have an issue with anything that is on the discs. All the episodes look great and are seemingly in tact. What I don't care for is the on the outside as I do not like the shag carpeting packaging and the cheapo box. I've always been more interested in the material on the discs that what the packaging looks like. For a while there, a lot of studios were releasing kitchy box sets (think the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Full-House-Complete-Series-Collection/dp/B005DVIP94/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Full House: Complete Series Collection</a>&nbsp;with a box shaped like the Tanners' house and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Golden-Girls-25th-Anniversary-Complete-Collection/dp/B003YKDPCI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Golden Girls: 25th Anniversary Complete Collection</a>&nbsp;with a box shaped like Sophia's purse). I never went for these because I know part of the (high) price in sets like these goes towards the ill conceived cutesy boxes that are fun to look at in passing but typically irritating to deal with in real life. The Brady Bunch set is no exception. The shag on the outside of the box of my set is already falling off in bits. Nothing says awesome like finding neon green bunches of lint on your clothing and carpet. Inside, the discs are held in a hot pink paper daisy that fit into a cardboard square. As I stated previously, there is no sticky glue on my set so I have no beef with the paper daisy but it is rather cheap looking and feeling. Thus far it holds the discs surprisingly well but I would have preferred something more standard and a lot sturdier. A small quibble in the grand scheme of things however.

Overall, this is a solid release that I think most BB fans enjoy. Very few channels reair the series and I'm happy to have them at my disposal along with a few cool bonus features. Now, if only we could get Paramount to release The Brady Brides, the remainder of The Bradys and the awesomely bad Brady Bunch Variety Hour!",1365206400,4,5272,4.752183406113537

2456649,5,B000CCBCI0,"I grew up with ""The Brady Bunch"". I loved the show, I loved all of the characters and my first crush was on Cindy.(don't give me that look, I was only 6 years old at the time!!) Of course as time passed I kind of left the Brady's behind (or thought I had) and moved onto other things.

A few months ago while channel surfing with my daughter I saw a block of ""The Brady Bunch"" coming up and wanted to show my daughter what I used to watch when I was a kid. We pop on the first episode and it's one of my favorites; Greg is making a movie about the first Thanksgiving and of course all of the Bradys' get involved, and before long my daughter and I are laughing out loud.

That was it, I was hooked again! And better yet, my daughter loved the show as well!!

We began taping the two episodes which played daily, but I began to notice that the episodes that aired were edited for time. Sometimes entire sub-plots were removed?! So I jumped onto Amazon and saw this set and knew I had to get it.

This set is fantastic!! From the unique outside packaging with the shag carpet, to the booklet which is included, to the bonus disk featuring a couple of the Brady made-for-tv movies, this is a box set that any fan of the show will love. I noticed that several reviewers didn't care for the cardboard flip-flower thing that actually holds the disks, but I prefer it to having a bunch of plastic shells. The entire flip-flower thing is easily removed from the box, and each disk slides in and out of it's slot easily (unlike the last few ""Simpsons"" box sets) so even with regular use, the disks shouldn't scratch.

If you are a fan of the show, then this is a must own!!",1360281600,,1664,4.2037617554858935

I watched this show as a kid and I loved it.  Now I watch it with my own kids and they love it too.  It is a welcome relief from the typical ""Family Channel"" fare where parents and adults are portrayed as dolts to be mocked by their children.

Although many people regard the series as mindless fluff, the show deals with many important social issues some of which maintain their relevance today.  Topics like gender and race relations are covered, albeit from a late sixties network TV perspective.  I also think the show deals well with children's issues such as self image.

2456686,1,B000CCBCI0,"Bought this from a 'Trusted Amazon Seller'. The shag carpet is a clever idea, but at some point after the marketing team sent their concept to production, something went horribly wrong. For starters, the logos and photo credits on the front and back of the carpet are made from what looks like cheap, home printer quality card stock, simply glued to the carpet. Mine were near falling off when I opened the box. As for the inside - The booklet comes in a handy, sleeve-type pocket, which is decent enough. Now here's where the wheels fall off... The DVD's themselves are housed inside a thin, card stock ""paper accordion"", with each disc inside its own ""pocket"". The accordion is held together with a diabolical adhesive glue, and every single one of the discs were literally stuck to the paper. When I attempted to remove them, (by peeling them off), I discovered that each disc had the glue residue on it. Every... single... one. I then immediately boxed it back up, contacted the seller, told them the product was unacceptable, and wanted to send the entire thing back for a full refund. They told me that since the package was opened, they would not reimburse me, but would allow me to do an even exchange for another set. Since I knew the next set would be exactly the same, I promptly said no and asked them how I could possibly have known the discs would be defective without actually opening the package?! They then suggested that I... (get ready for this one)... ""go to WalMart and buy some compact disc cleaner for five bucks to clean off the glue""! After falling on the ground in stunned amazement, I contacted Amazon directly, told them the whole story, and after filing a claim, I got all my money back.

2456721,1,B000CCBCI0,"If you're a fan of ""The Brady Bunch,"" I'd recommend buying each season individually.

I ordered this when it was priced in the $50's (deal of the day) a couple of years ago.  When I finally got around to watching it, I found out that there was glue/glue residue stuck to a bunch of the disks.  The result?  Those with residue wouldn't play correctly (they skipped).  Try as I might to clean them, I could never get all of the glue residue removed.  This is the problem with ""cutesy"" packaging.  Yeah, it looks great.  So often though, the disks inside are damaged.  Look at how many complete series end up having damaged disks.  It happened to me with the complete series of ""ER"" (only available on R2 disk...I bought it on Amazon.com/uk).  Some report it with ""The X-Files""  ""MacGyver""  ""The Wire"" and so on and so forth.  I wish studios would stick to the basics like they did with the new ""Home Improvement"" complete series.  Each season of ""HI"" is in its own individual case (they're exactly the same as the season-to-season releases), with some clever knickknacks thrown the box set in for flare.

Unfortunately (unless you can buy them separately on EBAY or somewhere), the complete series is the only place you can get ""A Very Brady Christmas"" on DVD.  Same goes for the extra episodes of the Brady spin-off series.  Trust me, they're not worth it.  Apparently a bunch of people have had success with the complete series.

2456725,5,B000CCBCI0,"""The Brady Bunch"" which aired from 1969 to 1974 was and remains one of the most beloved of all TV shows. I like to think of the Bradys as friends with whom we all could relate to and hope that their special problems might mirror our own. Sure they seem dated and very controlled for the time, but somehow reflect an innocence and style of good moral upbringing despite the ever-changing world around them. Greg, Marcia, Jan, Peter, Bobby and Cindy all have the problems that many children deal with today and we follow their stories with amazement. The circumstances might be hokey or impossible at first, but the messages are still very clear and hold true, even today. Mr. Brady and Mrs. Brady and Alice, all support and understand the difficulties and situations that they witness and never fail to live up to their love for their children. Maybe this is why the show has such a grip on so many fans... In this boxed set, you have all 117 episodes and you will doubtlessly remember something from collecting all 94 redemption stamp books or ""Oh, my nose!"" Enjoy!",1305244800,,1065,4.610526315789474

2456733,5,B000CCBCI0,"I loved this show as a kid and I still love it as an adult. I had this DVD collection on my wish list for several years now and when Amazon offered it as a Gold Box special several weeks ago I could not resist. clocking in at almost 50 hours of pure Brady entertainment it is truly a set worth purchasing. I am reliving my childhood all over again growing up with the Brady Kids, Susan Olsen and I are about the same age, so I truly grew up with then Brady kids. they were the perfect family that to me set the standard for all families of the early 70's. Who can forget such episodes like ""The Cincinnati Kids"" when they all go to Kings Island Amusement Park and ride all the cool rides. or what about their trips to the Grand Canyon and Hawaii. Those were the good ole days of television.

I felt it was my duty to address the issues other reviewer has complained about concerning the packaging. first of all I have learned from experience that some people are looking for something to complain about and aren't happy unless they find fault in everything. With that said does the packaging have issues? Yes, but the issues aren't nearly as bad as other reviewers claim them to be; out of 20 or so disks in the collection I found a very small amount of glue on the edge of 1 DVD which was very easily wiped off with a little alcohol and a soft cloth. The only other issue is the actual sleeves the Disks are stored in; yes they are cardboard and you should probably store them somewhere safer. This seems to be a problem with all the studios that produce an entire series/movie collection in one gimmicky massive set(i.e. M*A*S*H Martinis & Medicine Collection); while they are really neat to look at they are very impractical to store the collection in over the long run. So just buy a safer storage solution and use the fancy box as decoration on a high shelf.

Those who own dvds know they can be somewhat fragile, and box sets are notorious for packaging them poorly. This set is THE WORST I have ever seen. Inside the box you will find a stationary 'flip book' shaped like a flower. The discs are stacked between flowers with NOTHING holding them in place - not even pegs for the center of the discs. Also, the manufacturer has adhered the flowers with the rubbery substance used to hold credit cards in place when mailed. This results in a sticky residue that is on the edge of all the discs and had to be meticulously cleaned from each disc before they would play. ARGH!

Buyer beware!

Bad packaging might not seem so terrible, but think about it - every time this set is moved, all of the discs slide around inside. Over time, this will certainly scratch some of them. This is unacceptable on an expensive set like this.

Other than that, you have all the episodes of the show with minimal special features. There have certainly been quite a few things produced about this show over the past hour decades (something like a bazillion). Why there is practically nothing on these discs is a mystery.

Overall, not a great product, even if it was a great show.",1279756800,9,1434,4.521235521235521

But, unless i missed a review or two, no one has mentionned that during most episodes of the first season (i haven't watch the other seasons yet), there are some scenes with less quality and much more noise that have been inserted between good ones, for..let's say 10-15% for an episode. I think it's probably because these particular choosen scenes were too damage on the master prints they used for each episode and they had to relate on lower quality prints to make sure each episode was complete.

It might not be very noticeable on crt tvs, but on anything else it shows. I thought at first this was only for 1 episode but it seems to be constant for many more. So you can get clear and colorful pictures for a few minutes and then, just for 15-20 sec, about the length of one or two particular camera shots, the picture all of the sudden became more noisy...to get back to great quality for the following scenes...and then it can starts over again 12-14 minutes later.

I was a bit nervous as I opened the package....it was delivered on a day that was 99 degrees outside, and I knew the potential for melting, tacky glue was high.

And what can I say about the shag carpet box?  A stroke of genius if you ask me!

Of course the content (the episodes) speaks for itself!  I loved The Brady Bunch growing up and it's like taking a trip down memory lane each time we watch (my kids, 10 and 5, love it)!  And the quality of the actual video is very nice as well.

I can highly recommend this dvd collection to any Brady Bunch fans!  Buy the collection...watch the dvds...be happy!  :-)

After nagging my very loving boyfriend, he finally purchased my Brady Bunch dvds. I'm in Brady Heaven! I feel like I have my very own Brady channel. I've been watching it on TVLand, but they seem to skip certain episodes. I received the package last week, and I'm only on the third season... it's different than TVLand, because there are NO commercials. I love the intro, where they're standing on the stairs, and it says ""IN COLOR"" at the bottom. That brought back memories from watching in the early 70s.

I was a little disappointed that the set is just the individual seasons shrink wrapped together. There was no booklet, like the one that's included with the shag carpeting cover. I wanted that set, but after reading all the reviews where they said the discs had glue on them, or they were unplayable, I didn't want to take the chance. I have Barry Williams's ""Growing Up Brady"" book, and I have ""Bradymania"", so I guess I can live without the booklet.

2456757,5,B000CCBCI0,"Nearly anyone who has owned a TV in the past forty years knows of ""The Brady Bunch"", the series that holds a place in American pop culture and a series that refuses to die. This complete series boxset features every single ""Brady Bunch"" episode, all 117, plus a disc that features some neat bonuses, including the 1988 Christmas TV movie ""A Very Brady Christmas"" that helped to bring new notoriety to the series. The only complaint I have about this boxset is the shoddy packaging. Paramount, unfortunately, carelessly produced this set, and like many have said discs have ended up being scratched because of the way they were housed. I actually bought the series in all the season individual boxsets, but had to purchase this set because of the bonus DVD. If you can spare the money and want to take a chance on the discs not being damaged buy this set. If your contented in having all the show's individual boxsets pass on buying the complete series set.
 ""The Brady Bunch"", despite its popularity in syndication and on the TBS Superstation in the '80's and early '90's, never entered the Top 25 while it was originally shown on ABC from 1969-1974. It became the perfect half hour sitcom when it began to be broadcast everyday after kids were home from school: that is when I discovered the Bradys. A simple series with simple characters and storylines, ""The Brady Bunch"" will always live on in the hearts of viewers for years to come.
 There have been two outstanding books written on the ""The Brady Bunch"": the first was ""Growing Up Brady"", written by Barry Willimas who played Greg. That book has a ton of information on the show and features an episode guide as well as air dates. The second is Maureen McCormick's splendid and outspoken memoir, written in 2008 called ""Here's The Story"".

It's interesting to see the issues that were considered controversial from epidosde one (1), the ""blended"" family attitudes from the hotel clerk to the rare seen episode where their neighbors adopt three (3) boys as a multi-racial family.  All the series are well put together and a big hoot to watch in the technical logistics such as what they wear, the cars and the street view shots.  I even caught some of Jan's clothes on Cindy later on in the show!!! THATS GREAT! How much more could you be like family? These creators were great risk-takers and good story tellers.

2456761,5,B000CCBCI0,"It is really nice to have the box set with the Brady Bunch,it is great family fun to sit and watch them again, and the bonus that comes with them, I wanted this set for the bonus disc that has the Chistmas Movie, but it would have been nice if they would have added the Brady Brides to this set also, and some of the variety hour, like they did with the cartoon , but still great to have ...The only problem I had with this set is the flip book accordion pockets that holds the disc , 2 of the disc had a little glue on them and 1 had a tiny scratch, so I wiped the glue off with a soft cloth, and put them in plastic cases. I still gave it a 5* because the series is great and it included the bonus disc .

This was a true bargain!  None of my discs were scratched or had the glue residue on them fortunately.  I grew up watching The Brady Bunch and got hooked again on re-runs!  It is lovely to feel 11 or 12 again and I plan to get my grandkids hooked when they are old enough. I highly recommend this set.",1240099200,,392,4.342465753424658
2456764,5,B000CCBCI0,"I had no problems with the packaging, as others have said. Mine was fine, discs were fine and played great. I think the packaging was what really sold me on buying the whole series instead of the individual seasons - it's halarious! Everyone I've showed it to has gotten a kick out of it, and of course it's great to see all those episodes again.",1237593600,,346,4.338461538461538
2456765,4,B000CCBCI0,"It's a must-have for fans, and the shag carpet packaging is awesome! However, I only gave this 4 stars instead of 5 cuz I'm not crazy about the inner packaging... they have cardboard sleeves for the DVDs rather than the ""traditional"" disc holders. Some of them can be hard to get out of the sleeves sometimes. But the content of the set itself is great!",1237248000,,353,4.446153846153846
2456766,5,B000CCBCI0,"I found nothing wrong with the packaging.  In fact I like it and find it hilarious.  It has been a big hit on my shelf too when friends have come over.  Yeah, if I flung it across the room, the discs would fall out.  Be gentle with it and it won't give you any problems.  None of my discs were scratched or had glue on them.  And owning all of the Bradys is fantastic.  I highly recommend this set!",1233273600,,398,3.962025316455696

2456768,5,B000CCBCI0,"I am so excited to own this DVD box set of the Brady Bunch! I had been watching old VHS tapes of shows off Nick at Nite, and only had about 2/3 of the episodes, so many of these I haven't seen in years.  As for editing, I found my vhs versions had many more scenes edited out and was glad to see so much extra footage on the dvds.  The remastering on the color is excellent!  I love it!
I've been reading other reviews about the design of the box...I actually really like the whole design and had no problems with scratches or glue, but  I did notice the way it was shipped...one little bag of air, and just the item...no packing foam or even packing paper to keep it from moving around.  I was lucky with my shipment, but can understand if other orders have been received damaged.
All in all, my experience with Amazon.com has been great!  My order arrived within 5 days, and I could delve into the wonderous world of the Brady Bunch!",1229472000,,935,4.224719101123595

The disks come in an accordion like sleeve that's a really flimsy thin cardboard.  Seems like it would come apart very easily if not handled with care.  As long as I keep my kids away from it, it should be OK.  Otherwise, I have no problems with it.",1223942400,2,389,4.422535211267606
2456772,4,B000CCBCI0,"The Brady Bunch - The Complete Series is highly entertaining for the whole family. I never cared for the 1st season, the kids were really annoying and pathetic especially Marsha and Bobby. I think the last 2 seasons were the real gems but just like everyone I didn't like Oliver, what a pest!! If you enjoyed watching this classic on t.v. then might as well buy the whole series, have a ball with this one!",1221436800,,406,4.426666666666667

Being a father of two girls (4 and 6), I look for nostalgic shows to watch with them. The Brady Bunch is good clean fun. I skip over the later episodes when the older kids start dating...hey I'm a protective father!...but the show really teaches kids about accountability, honesty, equality and family values. I am really happy to get this for a gift. I noticed that you save some money vs. buying the seasons individually (my wife is a smart shopper!). Plus, you get two full length Brady Movies (Brady Christmas and Brady 500). In addition to that, Amazon.com offers FREE SHIPPING. It is cool deal and at the same cost as taking the family out for a nice dinner and to the movies. Did I mention the cool retro case and episode guide? Sweet...",1217462400,3,879,4.46583850931677
2456775,5,B000CCBCI0,I bought the Brady Bunch DVD series for my 8 year old son's birthday.  I wanted him to watch something other than what's on TV these days.

2456786,5,B000CCBCI0,"First, let me address the packaging.  I was worried about buying this, because some of these reviews said that the way the discs are packaged would leave a sticky residue on a lot of the individual DVD's.  I opened it when it arrived and feared the worst.  But instead, what I found were 21 perfectly packed DVD's in immaculate condition.  I checked every single disc, and there was nothing on them at all.  I checked near the bottom of the packaging, and there was no glue anywhere to be found.  I couldn't have been happier to see this.  There were only two problems.  First, I bought it as a gift for my mother, and I opened it to investigate.  So I'm sad that I'm giving it to her opened.  Second, in fear that the the case would be an unsuitable storage environment for the discs, I bought a CD zipper case to go along with them.  Unfortunately, it seems to be unnecessary.

The packaging is great, and even though I bought these for my mom, I might have to borrow them sometime, because I love the show as well.  And the price right now, $89.99, is really hard to beat.  Buy it!!!",1200614400,5,1086,4.311881188118812
2456787,5,B000CCBCI0,I grew up watching The Brady Bunch and now that I have 9 year old twins I wanted to introduce them to the show.  My kids love the series and have already found their own favorite episodes.  A great purchase.,1200528000,,207,4.15
2456788,5,B000CCBCI0,Fabulous to share this great show with our kids in this comprehensive set.  You will love it!,1200268800,,93,4.470588235294118
2456789,5,B000CCBCI0,"I purchased this set for myself and my 5 year old fell in love with the Brady Bunch! We watch one every night before bed!  I decided to give it as a gift to our friend's daughter. Now she is HOOKED!  It's every episode and optional commentaries on a couple episodes.  A real treausre!
The shag cover on the box is super groovy  A must have set for sure!",1199318400,,353,4.072463768115942
2456790,5,B000CCBCI0,"The packaging of these DVDs is very creative.  I can not get over the number of individual DVDs included!  The first disc has commercials before the main menu appears and we were not able to skip over them.  The remaining DVDs do not have this problem.
It was nice to be able to watch the shows without commercial interruption.  We could have done without the ""Here's the story...of a lovely lady...that was living...""  before each and every episode, but that can be skipped over.
These sure brought back a lot of memories for me and my kids really enjoy them!",1198886400,,560,4.56
2456791,4,B000CCBCI0,"I was excited when I saw this box set.  Finally, the complete series out on DVD (without having to buy it one season at a time).  I bought this because it's a better price than buying one season at a time, and for the bonus DVD.  One downside with the bonus is that ""The Brady Girls Get Married,"" the first Brady Bunch movie, wasn't on the disc (which is severely lacking.  I wish it was released on DVD or at least on VHS.  My collection's imcomplete).  I don't really care about the Brady Brides and the Bradys TV series (short-lived, each about 10 episodes or less), but since it included the Christmas and the Bradys movies, I wish it had included said movie.

I agree that the packaging is lacking.  Although the flip file rolodex type format is a cute idea, it doesn't really hold up to scrutiny.  There's a high probability of disc damage (which ruins discs) due to them not being properly stored.  I read that another reviewer purchased a small capacity CD wallet (24 disc) to store hers in (which I think I'm going to do myself).  I'd also recommend purchasers do that.  It's cute packaging, but I'd rather have safe storage rather than cute.

All in all, I'm pleased with the set, thus 4 stars (good set, but lacked a bit in minus one movie and the packaging).  It's worth the purchase.",1196380800,4,1296,4.436440677966102
2456792,5,B000CCBCI0,"This complete 5 season set of The Brady Bunch is an amazing deal.  The price you pay for all 5 seasons plus a disc of awesome extras is unbelievable.  The packaging is fun, creative and user friendly.  Love the shag carpet lining on the set and the booklet inside details all the episodes.  Many criticize the cardboard storage case that holds all the discs and say the glue gets all over their discs and that discs are scratched.

I love the way the discs are held.  It is very important to handle all dvds with care and it makes sense to do that here.  Pull them out and place them back in by the edges.  None of my discs are scratched and there is nothing that gets on the discs that would cause any damage to my dvd player.  I find this set a pure delight.

For the show, I grew up with the Brady's and it is very emotional to watch the early years when family values and true caring is shown thru very simple but heartfelt tales.  The seasons develop to have the kids center stage as they mature very well looks wise and acting ability wise.  No one will ever forget MARCIA, MARCIA, MARCIA.

This box set is a must for those of us who grew up with this wonderful family and for those who did not - discover them now.  The magic is still alive.

The show lived on in many different forms for decades after its weekly run ended.  There is a Christmas movie reunion, a drama series episode and cartoons just to name a few of the extras.  As I said, don't be scared off by those who dislike the packaging.  It is not cheap and the discs arrive in excellent condition.

The Brady Bunch is a television classic!",1194307200,10,1610,4.219672131147541

""The Brady Bunch"" is only the best sitcom that ever made it to American TV. I grew up watching this classic program and can proudly say that I know every single show by heart. I can see a show for just a split second and know the exact and precise plot; is this a gift or a curse? But, that doesn't mean these shows ever get boring. There's always room for ""The Brady Bunch"" because this happy family can bring a smile to anyone's face.

The late and much-loved Robert Reed played the Brady patriarch, Mike Brady. Mr. Brady was always the sense of reason. Every time I see him I instantly think of Carol saying, ""Whatever your father says."" Or, I think of the kids saying to Mike (after he kindly put them in their place, so to speak), ""I never thought of it like that..."" Robert Reed was an awesome actor. Because he played the part very seriously. He didn't care that it was only a kid's show. No, to him it was a real family. And, not too many guys can pull off a perm but Mike looked pretty hot. Before joining ""The Brady Bunch,"" Robert Reed was on the classic '60s detective drama, ""The Defenders.""

Speaking of hot, Florence Henderson was one hot mama; playing Carol Brady ne Martin (and her maiden name was Tyler.) It was never established, but I have always believed that Carol was widowed. She wasn't divorced, because at a time in American culture this was still a controversial subject. (Of course in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Brady-Bunch-Movie-A-Very-Brady-Sequel/dp/B00008Z45F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Brady Bunch Movie / A Very Brady Sequel</a>, she is a divorce, but that's certainly not the same storyline.) Carol was the world's best mom. She was always there for her kids, but she didn't baby them. Carol treated all of her kids like adults. One of my favorite eps with Carol was during the ep ""Every Boy Does It Once."" Bobby wanted to run away because he didn't feel needed or wanted, and Carol says, ""it's a big world out there; you didn't think I was going to let you go alone."" Since, ""The Brady Bunch"" Flo has kept busy. She had a couple talk-shows and has acted in movies. She even wrote a cookbook,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Florence-Henderson-s-Short-Cut-Cooking-America-s-Favorite-Mom-Helps-You-Get-Dinner-On-The-Table-Fast/dp/0688163777/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Florence Henderson's Short-Cut Cooking: America's Favorite Mom Helps You Get Dinner On The Table Fast</a>. But no matter what she does, she will always be most loved for being Carol Brady.

A member of the Brady Family that is tremendously underrated is Alice Nelson (Ann B. Davis.) I just loved Alice. What can I say about Alice that you don't already know? She was always there when the Brady's needed her and never around when they didn't. But she wasn't viewed as a ""maid."" Nope, Alice was a bona fide member of the family. Alice was seamstress, chef, nursemaid, listener, friend and at times even surrogate mother for the entire Brady Family. I don't think the Brady's could ever survive without Alice and Alice could never survive without them. And didn't Alice's dishes always look so good? I don't think she cared about carbs or fat-grams. There's also a great cookbook that Ann B. Davis wrote,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-s-Brady-Bunch-Cookbook/dp/1558533079/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice's Brady Bunch Cookbook</a>. In the '50s Ms. Davis was best known as the lovable, ""Schultzy"" from her two-time Emmy-winning role on ""The Bob Cummings Show.""

Greg was the oldest Brady brother, played by Barry Williams. Greg enjoyed singing, playing the guitar, baseball, and surfing. And Greg was always girl-crazy. One of my favorite eps with Greg is ""Our Son, the Man."" This is the one where Greg moved into Mike's den and gets a ""groovy"" new outfit to impress a senior at school. There are many books about ""The Brady Bunch,"" but Barry Williams wrote the very best book that I have ever read,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Growing-Up-Brady-I-Was-a-Teenage-Greg/dp/0967378508/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Growing Up Brady : I Was a Teenage Greg</a>. Barry, aka Johnny Bravo, even had his own CD:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Return-of-Johnny-Bravo/dp/B00001OH4D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Return of Johnny Bravo</a>.

Marcia was the oldest Brady girl, played by Maureen McCormick. For lack of a better word, Marcia was perfect. She was a cheerleader, a writer on the school newspaper and she had more friends and boyfriends than she knew what to do with. She also had the most perfect blonde hair in the world. Marcia also had a really beautiful voice, remember when she sang? In 1997 Maureen played country-singer, Barbara Mandrell in a critically-acclaimed movie. Maureen even released music into the `90s that has somewhat of a country flair,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/When-You-Get-a-Little-Lonely/dp/B000008P0B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">When You Get a Little Lonely</a>. And, earlier this year Maureen was on ""Celebrity Fit Club"" and got into fit shape! I understand Maureen is currently writing a book that will be out next year!

Peter (Christopher Knight) was probably the most thoughtful Brady boy. He was always around to lend a helping hand and he always felt remorse when he did something wrong. Remember ""The Personality Kid"" ep? Peter tries to come up with a new personality because he is afraid that no one likes him. But he learns that even saying ""pork chops and applesauce"" can't buy him friends if he doesn't like himself first. Of course, Chris Knight is well-known now by an entirely new generation, thanks to ""The Surreal Life"" and his very popular reality-show, ""My Fair Brady.""

Jan, aka Marcia's little sister (Eve Plumb) was one of my very favorite Brady's. I always felt bad for Jan. She had to spend her entire childhood living in Marcia's shadows. Jan tried everything to branch-out and be her own person; she tried being a pom-pom girl, a painter, a tap dancer and even a writer. All with no success; because Jan was always the perpetual loser. Of course Jan uttered the most famous lines on ""The Brady Bunch,"" when she said, ""Marcia, Marcia Marcia."" Don't worry Jan, I still love you. After ""The Brady Bunch"" ended, Eve became the ""Brady"" who was most reluctant to talk about her past. She even branched out into many different roles which were the complete opposite of the sweet and shy Jan. She was in the '79 movie Little Women. One of Eve's best roles was playing a nun in a series of eps on ""The Facts of Life.""

Bobby was the youngest Brady boy, played by Mike Lookinland. Bobby was the type of kid that a parent had to always watch because he was slick. He would do something when no one was looking. He also had a tendency to snitch; remember when he became a safety-monitor and started using his authority to his own advantage by busting all of his bothers and sisters, not to mention the kids at school?

Speaking of snitches, Cindy Brady was the youngest Brady child; played by the considerably more intelligent Susan Oleson. This child was purely dumb a as a doorknob which only made her more funny than the rest. Cindy also had an incredibly large mouth; she would repeat anything and everything she (over)heard. She was referred to as ""the baby"" at least once by Marcia and I think that was more because of the way she behaved than because of her actual age. Before being cast as cute Cindy, Susan had a bit part in one of The King's last movies, The Trouble with Girls.

And rounding out the cast is Sam ""the butcher"" Franklin (played by the legendary character actor, Allan Melvin also famous for another ground-breaking '70s sitcom, All in the Family - The Complete First Season.) And, towards the end of Season Five, Cousin Oliver (child character actor, Robbie Rist) joined the family. Also members of the extended Brady Family were Tiger the Dog (real name: Tiger) and Fluffy the Cat (pilot ep, only) (real name: unknown.) Cindy also got a couple of rabbits in the last ep that she wanted to sell, named Romeo and Juliet (real names for both: who cares.)

It really is hard to say who my favorite character is because I feel like I know them all so well. They Brady's are like a member of my own family. How can I choose one over the other? I suppose if I had to choose, I would pick Jan and coming in at a close second would be Cindy and Alice, tied.

""The Brady Bunch"" was always extremely educational for children. I started watching ""The Brady Bunch"" in the late `80s when I was 7 or 8 and it really taught me a lot. I didn't come from a large family, but perhaps I learned from ""The Brady Bunch"" the importance of family and the importance of sharing with others. I also learned more basic lessons in history. For example, when my family went to HI, I already knew about Pearl Harbor & the USS AZ (courtesy of ""The Brady Bunch."") I also learned about Early American History, specifically Benedict Arnold, as he was spoken about more than a couple of times.

There was another very important lesson that ""The Brady Bunch"" taught me. I learned that just because a family was not physically related didn't mean that they couldn't love each other just as much and be just as close as any other nuclear family. The Brady's were a blended-family (I hate the word step, and as Carol said to Bobby, as she pointed towards the steps leading upstairs to the bedrooms, ""those are the only steps in the house..."") that was no different from any other family. Through ""The Brady Bunch"" I learned that family can really be whatever you make of it.

It took me years to realize that ""The Brady Bunch"" was (supposed to be) in actuality a children's TV show. I used to think that this was how all families lived and I thought that this was how all `70s TV shows were. Of course, I was very wrong. But wouldn't it be great if we all lived in a Brady World!

""The Brady Bunch"" never ""jumped the shark."" Of course there were better eps at times. But there is not a single season that is worse than the others. This is very rare for long-running sitcoms that produce in excess of 100 eps (the Brady's did 117.) ""The Brady Bunch"" was always consistent because each season was top-quality television entertainment. Below, is a list of all the eps from the entire run of ""The Brady Bunch.""

The Hustler (original air-date: 3/1/1974)
Mike's boss sends him a pool table.  Jim Backus has another part in this classic series as Harry Matthews.

The Hair-Brained Scheme (original air-date: 3/8/1974)
Bobby sells hair tonic that turns Greg's hair orange-blonde. Meanwhile, Cindy starts selling bunnies. When neither one can turn a buck, they both decide to bleach their bunnies and sell them back to the pet store. This is the last ep of ""The Brady Bunch"" and unfortunately Robert Reed refused to appear in this show because he thought it lacked continuity.

The performances of the entire cast was always first-class. Especially the acting of the children, it was impressive to watch them because they were such talented actors and actresses, even at such young ages. It's not uncommon for child actors to just be glorified props. But, not on ""The Brady Bunch."" I don't think Sherwood Schwartz would ever have stood for that. When Cindy cried, I thought they were real tears, not ""crocodile tears."" When Marcia made snide remarks to Jan, such as, ""don't get mad at me if boys don't find you attractive,"" you could hear the meanness in her voice. When Peter was afraid to participate in the glee club you could see the blatant sadness and desperation written all over his face. When Alice slipped and fell (on the kids' game board,) it really looked like she almost broke her neck.

Another aspect of the show that I know is imperative is how Mr. and Mrs. Brady always believed in their children and always encouraged them. When Carol saw a pack of cigarettes fall out of Greg's coat pocket (""Where There's Smoke,"") she immediately believed him when he said they weren't his. There was absolutely no question about this. When Marcia wanted to get Davie Jones (""Getting Davie Jones"") to perform at her school, instead of telling her that she was chasing waterfalls her parents even helped her! When Mike thought that Greg wanted to be an architect he was the proudest man in the world; and even after he saw that Greg had no talent, he still tried to help him. When Carol told Marcia that they believed she was telling the truth (""The Slumber Caper,"") she was ecstatic to see that her parents believed in her. And, Mike even went to Marcia's school because he believed in his daughter and he wanted to find out what exactly happened. When Bobby tried to win a trophy his entire family went out of their way to help him. If I got a buck for every time Carol and Mike encouraged Jan during all of her identity-breakdowns I would be a rich person. And, at the end of the day, it didn't matter to the Brady's that there kids weren't perfect. It didn't matter because to them, what was most important was just getting in the game and giving it a good try.

The DVD's include the full eps; there are 2 ""Complete Series Sets."" I prefer this set just because it has that groovy-retro '70s look. Sherwood Schwartz, creator of ""The Brady Bunch,"" is to put it mildly, a genius. I am certain that there isn't a more wholesome TV show that the entire family can enjoy!

""The Brady Bunch"" is only the best sitcom that ever made it to American TV. I grew up watching this classic program and can proudly say that I know every single show by heart. I can see a show for just a split second and know the exact and precise plot; is this a gift or a curse? But, that doesn't mean these shows ever get boring. There's always room for ""The Brady Bunch"" because this happy family can bring a smile to anyone's face.

The late and much-loved Robert Reed played the Brady patriarch, Mike Brady. Mr. Brady was always the sense of reason. Every time I see him I instantly think of Carol saying, ""Whatever your father says."" Or, I think of the kids saying to Mike (after he kindly put them in their place, so to speak), ""I never thought of it like that..."" Robert Reed was an awesome actor. Because he played the part very seriously. He didn't care that it was only a kid's show. No, to him it was a real family. And, not too many guys can pull off a perm but Mike looked pretty hot. Before joining ""The Brady Bunch,"" Robert Reed was on the classic '60s detective drama, ""The Defenders.""

Speaking of hot, Florence Henderson was one hot mama; playing Carol Brady ne Martin (and her maiden name was Tyler.) It was never established, but I have always believed that Carol was widowed. She wasn't divorced, because at a time in American culture this was still a controversial subject. (Of course in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Brady-Bunch-Movie-A-Very-Brady-Sequel/dp/B00008Z45F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Brady Bunch Movie / A Very Brady Sequel</a>, she is a divorce, but that's certainly not the same storyline.) Carol was the world's best mom. She was always there for her kids, but she didn't baby them. Carol treated all of her kids like adults. One of my favorite eps with Carol was during the ep ""Every Boy Does It Once."" Bobby wanted to run away because he didn't feel needed or wanted, and Carol says, ""it's a big world out there; you didn't think I was going to let you go alone."" Since, ""The Brady Bunch"" Flo has kept busy. She had a couple talk-shows and has acted in movies. She even wrote a cookbook,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Florence-Henderson-s-Short-Cut-Cooking-America-s-Favorite-Mom-Helps-You-Get-Dinner-On-The-Table-Fast/dp/0688163777/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Florence Henderson's Short-Cut Cooking: America's Favorite Mom Helps You Get Dinner On The Table Fast</a>. But no matter what she does, she will always be most loved for being Carol Brady.

A member of the Brady Family that is tremendously underrated is Alice Nelson (Ann B. Davis.) I just loved Alice. What can I say about Alice that you don't already know? She was always there when the Brady's needed her and never around when they didn't. But she wasn't viewed as a ""maid."" Nope, Alice was a bona fide member of the family. Alice was seamstress, chef, nursemaid, listener, friend and at times even surrogate mother for the entire Brady Family. I don't think the Brady's could ever survive without Alice and Alice could never survive without them. And didn't Alice's dishes always look so good? I don't think she cared about carbs or fat-grams. There's also a great cookbook that Ann B. Davis wrote,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-s-Brady-Bunch-Cookbook/dp/1558533079/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice's Brady Bunch Cookbook</a>. In the '50s Ms. Davis was best known as the lovable, ""Schultzy"" from her two-time Emmy-winning role on ""The Bob Cummings Show.""

Greg was the oldest Brady brother, played by Barry Williams. Greg enjoyed singing, playing the guitar, baseball, and surfing. And Greg was always girl-crazy. One of my favorite eps with Greg is ""Our Son, the Man."" This is the one where Greg moved into Mike's den and gets a ""groovy"" new outfit to impress a senior at school. There are many books about ""The Brady Bunch,"" but Barry Williams wrote the very best book that I have ever read,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Growing-Up-Brady-I-Was-a-Teenage-Greg/dp/0967378508/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Growing Up Brady : I Was a Teenage Greg</a>. Barry, aka Johnny Bravo, even had his own CD:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Return-of-Johnny-Bravo/dp/B00001OH4D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Return of Johnny Bravo</a>.

Marcia was the oldest Brady girl, played by Maureen McCormick. For lack of a better word, Marcia was perfect. She was a cheerleader, a writer on the school newspaper and she had more friends and boyfriends than she knew what to do with. She also had the most perfect blonde hair in the world. Marcia also had a really beautiful voice, remember when she sang? In 1997 Maureen played country-singer, Barbara Mandrell in a critically-acclaimed movie. Maureen even released music into the `90s that has somewhat of a country flair,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/When-You-Get-a-Little-Lonely/dp/B000008P0B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">When You Get a Little Lonely</a>. And, earlier this year Maureen was on ""Celebrity Fit Club"" and got into fit shape! I understand Maureen is currently writing a book that will be out next year!

Peter (Christopher Knight) was probably the most thoughtful Brady boy. He was always around to lend a helping hand and he always felt remorse when he did something wrong. Remember ""The Personality Kid"" ep? Peter tries to come up with a new personality because he is afraid that no one likes him. But he learns that even saying ""pork chops and applesauce"" can't buy him friends if he doesn't like himself first. Of course, Chris Knight is well-known now by an entirely new generation, thanks to ""The Surreal Life"" and his very popular reality-show, ""My Fair Brady.""

Jan, aka Marcia's little sister (Eve Plumb) was one of my very favorite Brady's. I always felt bad for Jan. She had to spend her entire childhood living in Marcia's shadows. Jan tried everything to branch-out and be her own person; she tried being a pom-pom girl, a painter, a tap dancer and even a writer. All with no success; because Jan was always the perpetual loser. Of course Jan uttered the most famous lines on ""The Brady Bunch,"" when she said, ""Marcia, Marcia Marcia."" Don't worry Jan, I still love you. After ""The Brady Bunch"" ended, Eve became the ""Brady"" who was most reluctant to talk about her past. She even branched out into many different roles which were the complete opposite of the sweet and shy Jan. She was in the '79 movie Little Women. One of Eve's best roles was playing a nun in a series of eps on ""The Facts of Life.""

Bobby was the youngest Brady boy, played by Mike Lookinland. Bobby was the type of kid that a parent had to always watch because he was slick. He would do something when no one was looking. He also had a tendency to snitch; remember when he became a safety-monitor and started using his authority to his own advantage by busting all of his bothers and sisters, not to mention the kids at school?

Speaking of snitches, Cindy Brady was the youngest Brady child; played by the considerably more intelligent Susan Oleson. This child was purely dumb a as a doorknob which only made her more funny than the rest. Cindy also had an incredibly large mouth; she would repeat anything and everything she (over)heard. She was referred to as ""the baby"" at least once by Marcia and I think that was more because of the way she behaved than because of her actual age. Before being cast as cute Cindy, Susan had a bit part in one of The King's last movies, The Trouble with Girls.

And rounding out the cast is Sam ""the butcher"" Franklin (played by the legendary character actor, Allan Melvin also famous for another ground-breaking '70s sitcom, All in the Family - The Complete First Season.) And, towards the end of Season Five, Cousin Oliver (child character actor, Robbie Rist) joined the family. Also members of the extended Brady Family were Tiger the Dog (real name: Tiger) and Fluffy the Cat (pilot ep, only) (real name: unknown.) Cindy also got a couple of rabbits in the last ep that she wanted to sell, named Romeo and Juliet (real names for both: who cares.)

It really is hard to say who my favorite character is because I feel like I know them all so well. They Brady's are like a member of my own family. How can I choose one over the other? I suppose if I had to choose, I would pick Jan and coming in at a close second would be Cindy and Alice, tied.

""The Brady Bunch"" was always extremely educational for children. I started watching ""The Brady Bunch"" in the late `80s when I was 7 or 8 and it really taught me a lot. I didn't come from a large family, but perhaps I learned from ""The Brady Bunch"" the importance of family and the importance of sharing with others. I also learned more basic lessons in history. For example, when my family went to HI, I already knew about Pearl Harbor & the USS AZ (courtesy of ""The Brady Bunch."") I also learned about Early American History, specifically Benedict Arnold, as he was spoken about more than a couple of times.

There was another very important lesson that ""The Brady Bunch"" taught me. I learned that just because a family was not physically related didn't mean that they couldn't love each other just as much and be just as close as any other nuclear family. The Brady's were a blended-family (I hate the word step, and as Carol said to Bobby, as she pointed towards the steps leading upstairs to the bedrooms, ""those are the only steps in the house..."") that was no different from any other family. Through ""The Brady Bunch"" I learned that family can really be whatever you make of it.

It took me years to realize that ""The Brady Bunch"" was (supposed to be) in actuality a children's TV show. I used to think that this was how all families lived and I thought that this was how all `70s TV shows were. Of course, I was very wrong. But wouldn't it be great if we all lived in a Brady World!

""The Brady Bunch"" never ""jumped the shark."" Of course there were better eps at times. But there is not a single season that is worse than the others. This is very rare for long-running sitcoms that produce in excess of 100 eps (the Brady's did 117.) ""The Brady Bunch"" was always consistent because each season was top-quality television entertainment. Below, is a list of all the eps from the entire run of ""The Brady Bunch.""

I love this particular show soooooo much. The kids take Alice for granted one too many times and she quits.

The Cincinnati Kids (original air-date: 11/23/1973)
The Brady's take a trip to King's Island, an amusement park in OH. This is another ep that doesn't seem to come up in syndication too often; or at least not as much as the rest.

The Hustler (original air-date: 3/1/1974)
Mike's boss sends him a pool table.  Jim Backus has another part in this classic series as Harry Matthews.

The Hair-Brained Scheme (original air-date: 3/8/1974)
Bobby sells hair tonic that turns Greg's hair orange-blonde. Meanwhile, Cindy starts selling bunnies. When neither one can turn a buck, they both decide to bleach their bunnies and sell them back to the pet store. This is the last ep of ""The Brady Bunch"" and unfortunately Robert Reed refused to appear in this show because he thought it lacked continuity.

The performances of the entire cast was always first-class. Especially the acting of the children, it was impressive to watch them because they were such talented actors and actresses, even at such young ages. It's not uncommon for child actors to just be glorified props. But, not on ""The Brady Bunch."" I don't think Sherwood Schwartz would ever have stood for that. When Cindy cried, I thought they were real tears, not ""crocodile tears."" When Marcia made snide remarks to Jan, such as, ""don't get mad at me if boys don't find you attractive,"" you could hear the meanness in her voice. When Peter was afraid to participate in the glee club you could see the blatant sadness and desperation written all over his face. When Alice slipped and fell (on the kids' game board,) it really looked like she almost broke her neck.

Another aspect of the show that I know is imperative is how Mr. and Mrs. Brady always believed in their children and always encouraged them. When Carol saw a pack of cigarettes fall out of Greg's coat pocket (""Where There's Smoke,"") she immediately believed him when he said they weren't his. There was absolutely no question about this. When Marcia wanted to get Davie Jones (""Getting Davie Jones"") to perform at her school, instead of telling her that she was chasing waterfalls her parents even helped her! When Mike thought that Greg wanted to be an architect he was the proudest man in the world; and even after he saw that Greg had no talent, he still tried to help him. When Carol told Marcia that they believed she was telling the truth (""The Slumber Caper,"") she was ecstatic to see that her parents believed in her. And, Mike even went to Marcia's school because he believed in his daughter and he wanted to find out what exactly happened. When Bobby tried to win a trophy his entire family went out of their way to help him. If I got a buck for every time Carol and Mike encouraged Jan during all of her identity-breakdowns I would be a rich person. And, at the end of the day, it didn't matter to the Brady's that there kids weren't perfect. It didn't matter because to them, what was most important was just getting in the game and giving it a good try.

The DVD's include the full eps; there are 2 ""Complete Series Sets."" I prefer this set just because it has that groovy-retro '70s look. Sherwood Schwartz, creator of ""The Brady Bunch,"" is to put it mildly, a genius. I am certain that there isn't a more wholesome TV show that the entire family can enjoy! Remember, you are what you watch!",1193875200,43,33405,5.160555555555556
2456795,5,B000CCBCI0,"For a lot of people (including me), watching classic TV sitcoms from the 70's is not just a guilty pleasure but a temporary escape from reality. Having said that, NO OTHER TV SHOW provides a departure from the real world more than the Brady Bunch. A family of 9 (yes, I count Alice) living under one roof and actually getting along? Try finding that in this day & age. But that's why reruns of the show are still on TV to this day. The show's unique nostalgia and charm never seems to get old.

I ordered this collection as part of my week long birthday celebration (along with taking a week vacation from work). When it arrived, I couldn't believe my eyes - The Brady Bunch box set in SHAG carpeting? How 70's is that?! Even the packing is true to the era. Of course the real deal is what's inside the box - Every episode from all 5 seasons, the movies (The Brady 500 & A Very Brady Christmas) and a double episode of The Brady Kids cartoon - 21 discs total with an episode guide. And it was only $89.95!

I spent each day of my vacation watching an entire season - and it was fun! I watched everything - the trips to the Grand Canyon & Hawaii (both 3-part episodes), Jan's middle child issues, Marcia's popularity & dating issues (boy, did she grow up hot!), Peter's voice changing, The musical episodes (Adios, Johnny Bravo) and more - A thoroughly enjoyable week-long stroll down memory lane!

This Brady box set is a must own for any fan of this classic show - if they don't own it already. Five Stars!",1193702400,3,1507,4.336879432624113
2456796,5,B000CCBCI0,"Glad I waited for the complete series.  Well worth the wait.  Despite other buyer's reviews with the inner sleeve, I took a chance and ordered it.  When I received the set, all dvds were in perfect order.  Can't get enough of the Brady Bunch.",1193097600,,242,4.431818181818182
2456797,5,B000CCBCI0,It has been great to watch Brady Bunch again.  It's as good as we remember.  Now our kids are enjoying it as much as we did when we were their age.  We have REALLY enjoyed the DVD's!,1189555200,,182,3.864864864864865
2456798,1,B000CCBCI0,I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS BOX SET DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE ADHESIVE FROM EACH OF THE BOG FLOWERS THAT HELD THE DISCS IN GOT GLUE ALL OVER EACH DISC AND RUINED PLAYBACK QUALITY. RETURNED FOR REFUND!,1189555200,11,205,4.282051282051282
2456799,5,B000CCBCI0,"We are a couple in our late thirties who both grew up watching the Brady Bunch.  It's great, wholesome family entertainment.  We have two children, 5 and 2.  Both of them love watching the DVDs.  The youngest relates to Cindy and the oldest thoroughly enjoys each episode.  There are lots of DVDs and they come in nice little case (takes up very little space)!  Also included is a booklet summarizing all of the episodes.  We have watched the first two seasons and look forward to watching the remaining episodes.  This may sound like a lot of money, but I assure you, it is well worth it!  Buy these!  If you liked the Brady Bunch as a kid, you will not be disappointed!",1185321600,,671,4.426229508196721
2456800,4,B000CCBCI0,I bought this for my girlfriend and we have both watched many of the episodes. This DVD set plays great! The colorful discs have six episodes on each one. They are not double-sided discs which is nice. They all play clear and do not stick or skip. The only problem I would say is the DVD case that the discs are in. They are inside some cheap plastic thing that can easily come apart. What's worse is that there is adhesive that can damage the dvd discs. We put the discs in a small cd holder (that holds about 25 cds) and put the cd holder next to the episode guide booklet that comes with the set. I think fans will enjoy the episodes. They play clear and there are no commercials (about 24 minutes long per episode). The special features are nice too. Keep on groovin'.,1185148800,4,772,4.258503401360544
2456801,4,B000CCBCI0,"My children loved the first season DVDs of the Brady Bunch so much, I bought this box set for a long road trip. I had read about the flimsy packaging but decided the price was right.  I'm very glad I bought it. The DVDs come in an accordion-style package inside the box, and I simply pulled them out and put them in a nice CD carrier for the trip. Out of 20 discs, 2 had faint marks on them, which did not affect their ability to be played. If you are a collector who wants pristine packaging, this is not for you.  If you are a parent who wants to make it through a 3000 mile car trip without hearing ""Are we there yet?"" a hundred times, this box set is a bargain.  It's cheaply constructed, but all the great material is there, including my favorite episode: ""Mom always said, 'Don't play ball in the house.'""",1184976000,61,811,4.185897435897436
2456802,2,B000CCBCI0,"This is not about the show which i love, but about the packaging. They should have taken all of the individual season set boxes and put them into one big outer box like Land of the Lost. I just got this and the paper sleeves are bad. The glue is peeling and some of my discs are sticky. Good idea with the shag and i like the enclosed booklet but the disc holders are bad! I hope they change this because the discs can be damaged very easily in this set.",1183334400,27,454,4.0
2456803,5,B000CCBCI0,"I love it, love it, love it! I've been waiting for years to once again laugh along with those Bradys. The wait has been worth it. Bradys never disappoint! Great fun to see the fashions and hear the lingo of the time.
My kids (12 & 8) are obsessed with the show and don't find it cheesy or ""square"" at all! Good, clean family TV!",1182902400,,328,4.061538461538461
2456804,5,B000CCBCI0,"Unfortunately we can not buy this series in Europe, so I had to buy them in the USA.
This series is as good as I remember it.
Fantastic, I can recommend it to everybody.",1182038400,,169,4.0
2456805,5,B000CCBCI0,"I am a lifelong Brady Bunch fanatic.  This collection is the best I've seen.  It includes all episodes over the 5 year series, interviews with cast members and producers, and a bonus CD with 2 episodes of The Brady Kids cartoon and 2 Brady shows done in the 80's (The Brady 500, when Bobby is a race care driver, and A Very Brady Christmas, when Mike gets trapped in a collapsing building).

The Brady Bunch is a piece of a Americana and wholesome to boot.  Strongly recommended.  My kids are already hooked, thus ensuring another generation of Brady Fever!",1181779200,,557,4.585858585858586
2456826,5,B000CCBCI0,"I just got mine today and absolutely love it!!!!! Real Genuine Green Shag Carpet surrounding the entire case.
Whats great about this set is that its all the episodes neatly tucked away in an organized wallet type storage case, I disagree with posts that say its flimsy because i toally disagree and can say its not flimzy at all. I love the packaging. What I like about the set is that its the same as if you bought them separately but they throw in a bonus disc which i happen to love. I personally had A Very Brady Christmas on my Tivo for the past 6 months but was able to delete it because paramount included it in its bonus features. I know this means nothing to you but its a great movie becuase it came out in the 80s and had all the kids grown up and was very much a family reunion it did so well that they resurrected the brady bunch a made a go at it again
i don't think the ratings did as good as expected but the pilot the brady 5oo is included and in many ways
is a follow up to a brady christmas
however maureen mcormick is not in it where susan olsen wasn't in a brady christmas
anyways they are good stand alone movies
but they do go hand in hand nicely
it would be nice if paramount would put the bradys out on dvd
its not the same
and alot of poeple are sentimental about the bradys but it still was cool
also included on the bonus disc are 2 brady kids cartoons

my recommendation is to do what i am doing
start from the beginning and go forward

it already has gone down as one of the best shows in television history regardless of time

again bravo bravo for paramount home video putting the entire series out in one set",1181606400,,1641,4.105919003115265
2456827,5,B000CCBCI0,"What I really like about the dvds, are that I remember all of the episodes from my childhood, and it brings back so many wonderful memories.  Due to the longer commercial interruptions when it is on tv, some of the show has been cut off.  Now that I have the dvds, I can see the full show as it was intended.  I would highly recommend this to anyone, both those who have memories of the show, and those future generations with whom you can share this wonderful gift.",1180742400,,466,4.2727272727272725
2456828,5,B000CCBCI0,"I am very pleased with the purchase. Yes, the package is a little flimsy and the dvd's can fall out if you aren't careful. There wasn't any sticky residue on the dvd's as I previously read about and NONE were scratched.",1179705600,5,219,4.365853658536586
2456829,5,B000CCBCI0,"I bought this for my wife since it was her favorite show growing up--we're in our mid 30s. I have found out that my six-year-old and two-year-old daughters and I like it at least as much as she does. The ""Brady meetings"" and other aspects of the shows themselves are a little corny, but what a wonderful break from today's shows, especially ""reality"" TV! It's wholesomely entertaining and a must buy.",1179014400,,400,4.647887323943662
2456830,5,B000CCBCI0,"roughly 35 years later, the Brady Bunch holds the same appeal to and fascination for my daughters (ages 5 & 7) as it did for me... and quite frankly, the show seems much more wholesome than other stuff on TV nowadays (did i actually WRITE that?), especially since the older one has moved beyond PBS but isn't quite ready for those so-called 'tween sit coms.",1179014400,,357,4.507692307692308

2456833,5,B000CCBCI0,"This set is still much better than the original ""Brady Bunch"" season sets because you get the ""Christmas Show"" bonus show + tons of more bonuses and the price is only $89.99 for the WHOLE entire season of ""The Brady Bunch"".. Who cares that the discs are made in mexico, the picture quality is supurb and the price is fantastic!!! I have no complaints about this set because it meets all of my needs and is a nice collectors set... Online at other websites this exact set sells for over $120.00 and on Amazon it is priced @ only $89.99 with FREE SHIPPING! The discs play just as well as the other ""Brady Bunch"" set and you will save a ton of money on this set and again the remastered picture quality is excellent. The shag carpet is not my favorite thing about the set and I don't like the way the discs are housed in the case but all in all this is a fantastic set to own and a MUST HAVE for any ""Brady Bunch"" fan. I know a lot of fans that are selling there original sets on the auctions sites an opting for this one because of the BONUSES. Highly recommended!!!",1177891200,70,1064,4.195121951219512
2456834,5,B000CCBCI0,"Not having bought any other Brady Dvd's before I saw this one and decided it was a sound investment, even though other review's made complaints about the packaging. I recieved it all the way in Australia via airmail and have to say every disc was perfect without a scratch and the box itself was very cool, better than it looks. I find the file system disc holder pretty efficent considering there's 21 discs. The extra's on the disc's are unreal and a week later I'm still watching great stuff.

The only problem that I'm finding is it's hard to explain to friend's that as a 28 year old I still watch the Brady Bunch and love it.",1177286400,7,631,4.3931623931623935

Aside from the fact that there's a sticker that says ""Discs made in Mexico"" and there's glue on the edges of some of the DVDs (I had to remove it with finger nail polish remover then wipe off with water), AND the fact that the DVDS have about 6 or 7 minutes of advertisements for other DVD sets (I didn't pay to see advertisements and waste my time), it's overall okay.  I bought the set for the episodes not the pretty packaging, extra advertising etc.  I suppose if the discs were ""Made in Mexico,"" the container must've been ""Made in China.""  I swear, there's nothing ""Made in America"" anymore!  What's happening in this country anyway?  Brady Bunch DVDs made in Mexico?!?!
