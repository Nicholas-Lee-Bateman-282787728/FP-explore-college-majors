8324624,5,630443250X,Our daughter was about 5 or 6 when she received this tape originally and somehow it wandered away.  I replaced it with this new copy and she was overjoyed.  Very nice storyline and songs with captioning to sing along.,1388016000,,217,4.538461538461538
8324625,2,630443250X,"my son is in love with these characters, but since watching these sing alongs, he has now become very interested in the bully characters and their choice of words.  while most songs are perfectly fine, there are two that he (3 at the time, now 4) does not need to be singing.  one is about ""when you're big"" you can push others around and step on little people's toes etc.  it is sung in a mean voice and is about bullying others.  the other is ""i need you like a hole in the head"" a song that is a verbal spat between two characters who are saying mean things back and forth.  my son just does not need to learn such mean words at this age, nor does he need to become enamored with a mean dino character.  i'm sure others may not take to it the same way, but if i would have known about these 2 songs, i would not have gotten them.  it is ""missing"" when he asks to watch it.",1284854400,3,875,3.9942528735632186
