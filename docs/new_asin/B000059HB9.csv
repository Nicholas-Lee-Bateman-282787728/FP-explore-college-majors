7933545,1,B000059HB9,"Although Rufus is on the cover, there isn't much of Rufus on this DVD at all.",1130544000,16,77,3.875
7933546,5,B000059HB9,"If you're wondering what is on here that is Rufus-related...

Preformances of:

-Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk

-In A Graveyard

Plus an interview that lasts about 10-15 minutes. Its really interesting.",1118707200,15,202,5.633333333333334
7933547,5,B000059HB9,"This is another fine Circuit release.  Quirky interface, but well worth the trouble.  Intimate Wainwright performance in his cramped studio.  Malkmus' is in fine form for a couple short solo songs. The Soft Machine and Red Krayola bring their obscure and freakish weirdness out of the 60s and 70s (respectively) to this fine release.",1041292800,7,333,5.12962962962963
7933548,5,B000059HB9,"I haven't even watched the whole DVD, but I watched the section on Rufus Wainwright, and that made it five stars.  There is a pretty good interview with him on here and two performances.  It's really interesting and I always love watching him perform live.  If you like music at all get this because with Rufus Wainwright you can't go wrong. Also, there is a pretty good section on At the Drive in.  So if you like them buy it too.",1012521600,18,431,4.283950617283951
