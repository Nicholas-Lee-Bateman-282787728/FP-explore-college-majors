Yes, the video recording is a little fuzzy, and the camera work could have been better in a perfect world, but this DVD gives you the unique opportunity to experience a Beck concert from the hight of the Midnite Vultures tour. High energy, a great backing band lineup and a great selection of songs from Mellow Gold, One Foot In The Grave, Midnite Vultures, and best of all, an amazing set of songs from Mutations, make this DVD a must-have!",1423353600,,485,4.34065934065934
