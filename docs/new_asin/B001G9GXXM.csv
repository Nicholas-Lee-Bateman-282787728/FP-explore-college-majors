8304604,5,B001G9GXXM,"The reviews above aren't even for this movie.  Those were just confusing!

The movie I watched, Swing State (2016) is relevant, well executed and the writing is hilarious. I love the ensemble of characters....well done!",1478390400,,219,5.228571428571429
8304605,4,B001G9GXXM,"A lot has been said in the other reviews, but I'll speak to what I thought the great strength of the film was. This film shows both a more realistic view of campaigning then you are likely to get anywhere else (it is brutal) and it also shows that politicians are human. I saw the film and have recommended it to others, but if you have no interest in politics, I'm not sure what you'll get out of it. I really just enjoyed the political humanism.",1292803200,,447,4.209302325581396
8304606,3,B001G9GXXM,"That other review says this documentary was amateurish, self-indulgent, and it's implied that it's pass'e.  I disagree.  This is a decent work for the right audience.  If you are a poli.sci.-aholic or a campaign-aholic, then you will enjoy this.
This work is done by the son of Fisher who was running for the No. 2 job in Ohio in 2006.  As a son of the candidate, he has access to his father and other Democratic leaders in a way that the normal press does not.  If Chelsea Clinton had made a documentary about her mother's run for senate in 2000, that would have been interesting too.
Sometimes, film is wasted on interviewees taking off microphones, etc.  Still, this was impressive for a first-time effort.  Clive Barker is lauded now, but his student work lacked half the quality that this documentary did.  I imagine that Fisher the Son could have a strong career in the news media.
Most men don't like to admit to crying, but Fisher the Son admits that was his reaction when his father lost a previous campaign.  Fisher's daughter says to her father, ""If you get filmed with a gun to impress the NRA crowd, then I'm not voting in this election!""  That takes strong political conviction to oppose one's father so openly.  The work has moments of magic like that in it.
The director shoots himself and his father shirtless often.  Really, I wonder if both are proud of their burly, hairy chests (and they should be!).  However, I wonder if shirtlessness was the signifier of how the director has access that other media does not.
This work was no worse than ""Politics Texas Style"" or ""Taking on the Kennedys.""  It's a poli. sci. tool and not for the NASCAR or ""Jerry Springer Show"" crowd, though Springer is seen here.
Finally, the special features section has a piece on the late Congresswoman Tubbs-Jones.  As the opponent in the election was an African-American man trying to become one of the few people to break the color line to governor's mansions, this work really left race along a lot, or much more than any coverage on the 2008 presidential election would.  For those interested in the important subject of Black women in elected office, this is another reason to peep this work.",1251763200,3,2194,4.674479166666667
8304607,1,B001G9GXXM,"This is a painful self-indulgent ""documentary"" (term used loosely) by Lee Fisher's son Jason Zone Fisher.  The movie is more self-serving to a young wanna-be film-maker who uses this movie to promote himself, try his hand at comedy, and abuse his family access.

I would write more, but wasted 2 hours of my life on this horrible horrible film...and this short time is only invested so you don't make a similar mistake.

This film his little to nothing to do with Ohio, it's all about a young film-maker who appears in the movie more than his father.  And it's not worth more time than it took to read this review.",1244937600,4,614,4.554545454545455
