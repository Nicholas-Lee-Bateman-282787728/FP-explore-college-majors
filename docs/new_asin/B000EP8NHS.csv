2526282,4,B000EP8NHS,"This video has a variety of clips from Pete Maravich's days at LSU.  You get a good idea of his shooting, dribbling, and passing skills.  I'd recommend it for any fan of Pistol, but you'd also want the The Night of Pistol Pete on DVD which shows his best game as a pro.  His LSU highlights are definitely more flashy than this pro highlights.",1180310400,2,342,4.3125

8112479,5,B000EP8NHS,"There's not much I can add to the reviews I've read about this tape except to say that for anyone wondering why Pistol Pete is a legend, this video may answer that question.  I saw him play when I was in college, so I was aware of Pete's artistry on the court, but seeing this video nevertheless makes my jaw drop even today.  Two of my grandkids who are beginning basketball and show potential were the recipients of this DVD, and I know they were inspired by it, so I'm doubly happy I laid down a few dollars for what a lot of training guides could take a lot longer to do.  God bless you, Pete!",1486166400,,597,4.129310344827586

8112481,3,B000EP8NHS,good clips of Pete playing for LSU but poor narration and quality; best part for me was Pete's testimony as a bonus feature. Many people interviewed and never know who they are including 2 women that I had no clue what their significance was in the film.,1467244800,5,254,4.425531914893617

8112483,3,B000EP8NHS,"What people tend to forget was that Pete Maravich was part of the vaunted ""Three M"" trio: Pete Maravich at LSU, Calvin Murphy at Niagara, and Rick Mount at Purdue. When they became eligible to play as sophomores, NCAA Division One men's basketball had never quite seen anything like them all at the same time. I still remember Niagara's Calvin Murphy being ""held"" to 52 points at Philadelphia's Palestra by La Salle College's great defensive guard and future ABA star Roland ""Fatty"" Taylor. Murphy was simply mind-boggling, and La Salle (Ken Durrett, Larry Cannon, and Bernie Williams were also on the team) beat Niagara (who also had Manny Leaks) that night. Murphy was also a great baton twirler. I kid you not.",1457568000,,713,4.852459016393443
