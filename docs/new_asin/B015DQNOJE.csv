7433475,2,B015DQNOJE,"I really enjoyed it until ""Special Ranger Rick"" and his bad acting got involved then it went down hill into really bad acting, unamazing ninja moves etc.
It was really entertaining before that, so watch it, and stop as soon as the army ranger jacket wearing ninja shaman shows up then just turn it off and assume everyone died and you could get 4 stars out of it. ;-)",1486512000,2,367,4.333333333333333

If there is, please ask for a refund on your tuition because it didn't really work the first time it was introduced. And it certainly isn't working after the hundredth introduction.

Now, combine that with Sorority Sisters finding the Ouija Board, well, you've got filmmaking gold. Oh, and make sure during the first session (and this is crucial and will be on the final) that each participant accuses the other person of moving it.

This is another cabin in the woods story. Michelle (AnnaMaria Demara) who takes meds has bad dreams about girls with bad hair and nasty contacts. They are so bad she wakes up with her high beams on. On top of all of that her bf Randy (Grant Alan Ouzts) has been cheating on her. She heads out to the family house and her four Delta sisters show up to comfort her...and play Ouija board in the demonically possessed cabin.

Dana (Michelle Nunes) has a bf Brian who she thinks is different from all the other guys.

Kelly (Jamie Strange) is our token blond who get nervous when they talk about Randy. She just broke up with her boyfriend who was ""just a guy.""

Jackie (Kate Siegel) likes Kelly who doesn't return the love.

Sharon (Kati Sharp) makes the film worth while. She likes to play jokes.

The film goes very well building character. I really started liking Sharon and then it happened. Possession is 6/10 ths of the film and it wasn't very good. They gave the possessed girls goofy make up and sped up the camera when they moved as if they had broken bones or something. The film had a 5 star build up and then went stupid with too much too soon.

8733273,1,B015DQNOJE,"Noticed the trend of changing movie names (was Demon Legacy) in hopes of losing the bad reviews.  Some cloud effects were good, otherwise playing fast motion stop action with the camera is NOT a special effect.....I thought it was a fakey looking witchcraft related movie and not much to keep me awake.  Giving this a 1 is equivalent to a 2 out of 10 rating which is probably too high.  One star for being mostly all female movie.",1486598400,3,430,4.487179487179487
