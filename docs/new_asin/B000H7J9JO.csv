8180539,2,B000H7J9JO,"This is a story about 2 Navy cadets (Ricardo Montealbn and Abel Salazar), their personal lives and professional careers. It is also a story about honor, friendship, making decisions and their consequences. Filmed in 1945, the atmosphere of world war is present in the background.

As for the DVD itself, let me describe the version I purchased: CineVisin by Image Entertainment. it has only one feature: PLAY. What is very upsetting is that the soundtrack is entirely dubbed! I was hoping on hearing the very young Ricardo Montalbn's voice in his native Spanish. This DVD is not remastered. Thus the overall 2 star rating. I would try my luck with a different better quality product hoping it is NOT dubbed.

SPOILER: Though the drama unfolds somewhat predictably, I was not too happy with the part of the ending that honors the dishonorably discharged deceased cadet.",1341964800,,868,4.979310344827586
