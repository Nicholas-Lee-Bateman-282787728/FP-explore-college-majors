4070243,5,B0035ECHJ0,"""Disgrace"" is a fine, literate adaptation of the novel by Nobel Prize winning author, J. M. Coetzee.  The novel is a beautiful near-masterpiece, so I hoped that the film would be strong.  John Malkovich heads the cast, playing a lecherous professor (David Lurie) at a university in Cape Town.  When he isn't soliciting call girls, he's seducing co-eds.  After his most recent relationship with a student turns bad, he decides to leave town for awhile and visit his daughter, Lucy (Jessica Haines), who lives in a remote rural area.  Things take an unexpected turn, causing David and Lucy to both examine their lives and make some surprising choices.

The film explores a number of issues, including the lingering affects of Apartheid in South Africa as well as forgiveness and how we use each other to fulfill our emotional needs.  However, it is most definitely not a heavy-handed morality play; ""Disgrace"" is subtle and nuanced.  The movie's understated tone sometimes belies the emotionally explosive issues upon which it touches, which makes it that much more powerful.  Instead of catharsis, we are offered a cerebral examination of these problems.  Malkovich is perfectly cast here, and along with a fine South African accent he does a splendid job of capturing the many facets of the characters, from leering lothario to exquisite tenderness.  The rest of the cast is also very good, and I think that the film benefits from consisting primarily relatively unknown actors.  The film didn't receive much attention when it was released and was criminally overlooked during awards season.  Don't let that prevent you from discovering this wonderful, thoughtful film.

The DVD is a bit light on extras, consisting of brief interviews with the cast and crew and an un-narrated behind-the-scenes peak at the filming.  Make sure, though, that you watch the end credits and pay attention to the song lyrics.",1273276800,5,1905,5.1
4070244,5,B0035ECHJ0,"Let me begin by saying this film may be one of the best of the past year. The performance by John Malkovich gives us another reason to extend to him a title of superb actor. And, probably no one else could fill his shoes in the film.

The film is taken from the book by Nobel laureate J.M. Coetzee. He won the Booker Prize for this novel. I have not read it and find I must. Coetzee is one of those authors you remember, and as far as I am concerned has not won the acclaim he deserves. The film takes place a few years after Apartheid. There is no longer the legal stigma of socializing or dating among the races. Malkovich is a professor of Romantic Poetry at the U of South Africa. He is arrogant, pig headed even, and thinks of no other except himself and his needs. He has an affair with a young student, and while it is not rape, she obviously does not enjoy it. He is found out and is asked to leave the university. He shows no regret except that he was found out.

Malkovich goes to visit his young daughter, Lucy, in the country. Here, things are simple, she raises dogs, and has a farm of flowers and veggies that Lucy tends. Lucy is a Lesbian and had a sig other who seems to have left. She also has a black man who lives on the farm and helps her out. Malkovich cannot understand this arrangement, the man walks in and watches television whenever he wants. Certainly things have changed. Lucy is very independent, and has her own way and manner of living. A horrible incident occurs and things will never be the same. However, life does go on, and the times and situations change and Malkovich has a new understanding of life such as it is.  He asks for forgiveness from the family of the student of whom he had an affair. But, not all has changed and as we see, Malkovich, the Professor, retains his own way. Throughout this film questions keep rising, is this the right thing for Lucy to do. What would I do. What is happening to the Prof, Malkovich. How can things remain the same but be so different?

The acting is superb. Lucy is played by Jessica Haines with such a fine, free base of understanding.  Her farm manager is an African named Petrus, played by Eriq Ebouaney. His acting shows us a man who is sure of his place. Other characters are sure footed and superb. In one instance Malkovich, whose job it is to help a vet attendant care for and put down animals that have no home, helps to put down a dog that he has shown great affection. I could not help but shed tears at this scene. Was Malkovich looking for some sort of atonement. The entire film has a feel of moral ambiguity. How do we place ourselves in surroundings and cultures new to us and find a place that is real and OK.

The final scene is perfect, this is just the way things are. Superb, superb, one of the year's best films.

Highly Recommended.  prisrob 05-08-10

Coetzee, this movie does a fairly good job of portraying the book.  John Malkovich stars as the professor, David, who has serial affairs with women, the latest one being an imprudent one with one of his students.  When she reports him to the Capetown university's administration, David pleads guilty and resigns from his position.  He travels to a rural area in South Africa to stay with his daughter who is a lesbian and has just broken up with her partner.  The movie very deftly shows the palpable awkwardness of the new apartheid and the painful aspects of a woman living alone.

The book more clearly discusses apartheid and its role in events that occur, while in the movie a lot is left up to the viewer's summation or prior knowledge of South African history.  Though I think that John Malkovich is an excellent actor, I had a very hard time picturing him in this particular role.  He just didn't seem to fit with the character that he portrayed.  The woman who played his daughter does an excellent job.

It is difficult to give much of the plot details because of spoilers.  However, I found the movie riveting.  I recommend reading the novel first so as to have a better understanding of what is happening, and also for background information.",1272931200,5,1441,5.248908296943231
4070246,1,B0035ECHJ0,"I kept waiting for this movie to reach some kind of enlightenment, but instead it was terribly depressing all the way to the end (aided by the same kind of haunting music over and over).  Depressing and disturbing.  If rape, attempted suicide, misuse of power, violence and mental illness aren't enough to take you down, maybe the constant putting dogs to sleep, shooting and burying them will do it.",1272672000,11,400,4.782608695652174

This is a painfully insightful and politically charged movie that will be much appreciated by discerning viewers.",1272585600,19,488,5.243589743589744
4070249,5,B0035ECHJ0,"John Malkovich nails the role of a pompous Cape Town literature professor, David Lurie, who glibly spouts Byron and Wordsworth. And he certainly loves the ladies. He uses his status to initiate an affair with an attractive student, who becomes the reluctant recipient of Lurie's affections. She is a young coed; he's fifty-two. When the scandal breaks, Lurie gets booted out of his cushy faculty post and seeks refuge in his daughter Lucy's home.

Lucy lives in a remote region in the East Cape on a small plot of land. She raises dogs and sells flowers to scrape together a modest living. It seems Lurie and his daughter had long been separated; they scarcely know each other when the ""disgraced"" professor comes knocking. A big part of the film is how their relationship develops.

Turns out Lucy lives in an area that lacks law and order. Hooligans roam without check. This is post-apartheid South Africa at its worst. Horrible things happen in this film. It seems that people must protect themselves in this region; Lurie and his daughter are not good at self protection.

The film is also about how Lucy is trapped by forces beyond her control. She must accept bitter realities in order to survive. She also feels that she has carved out a life and is determined to stay. Perhaps a lot of money would help, but money is scarce, although the ex-professor can afford a trip to Cape Town where he pays a prostitute.  So the arrogant Lurie must take a crash course in Life 101, South African style. He must get his hands dirty, in both a literal and figurative sense. He also finds romance in the arms of a woman who is quite a contrast to the aforementioned coed.

Jessica Haines most convincingly portrays Lucy. She acts in a completely natural manner; it's as if she is playing herself. She strikes no poses.

It's a great film, perhaps a bit overlong. The cinematography is stunning, capturing the pretty urban life of the comfortable in Cape Town, the grinding poverty of many South Africans, and the stark beauty of the remote rural area where Lucy lives.",1272412800,10,2062,4.698060941828255
4070250,4,B0035ECHJ0,"Only recently united, South Africa has for centuries been a country divided.  But a change in politics does not mean a change in human behavior.  Many are emotionally imprisoned by the demons of old apartheid beliefs. DISGRACE, an indie hit new on DVD and Blu-ray this week, is a drama that explores this dark terrain.  Oscar nominee John Malkovich stars.

Based on the best-selling Booker Prize-winning novel by the 2003 Nobel Prize laureate J. M. Coetzee, the book (and movie adaptation) charts the tumultuous path when forbidden desires tragically collide with social and racial prejudices.

In the film, directed by Steve Jacobs, Malkovich is a detached, somewhat cynical, acerbic, slightly arrogant, detached University of Cape Town professor David Lurie, whose world abruptly changes when he is fired for seducing a young female college student.  He retreats to his estranged daughter's remote farm where a sudden explosion of violence forces Lurie to deal with his life amid the unsettling complexities of the new South Africa.  The story and film raise numerous questions.  The metaphors and ideas and especially Malkovich's chilling portrayal are all operating on a high level.  And the film looks great with its sunny S. African locations that further burn the heart and eye.

In 2006, The London Observer called Coetzee's book ""the greatest novel in English in the past 25 years.""  The movie does justice to the book's gritty, gripping drama of brutality, survival and hope.  Author Stephen King considered the movie among his ten best of 2009 and Roger Ebert gave it four stars, calling it ""one of the year's best films.""

4070251,4,B0035ECHJ0,"A fifty two year old art professor much less attractive than lustful finds himself in a reality of post-apartheid South Africa as his white daughter submitted to group-sex with Afro-men to secure her independence from a native Euro-ghetto by doing own farming.

It is a sharp ""Alice in wonderland"" picture where yesterday superman is a nonentity for past outcasts commending his life today.",1267574400,7,390,5.190476190476191
4070252,5,B0035ECHJ0,"After having read J.M. Coetzee's complex, disturbing, shocking and controversial novel, one could not directly see how this story could be transformed into an appealing screenplay and still less into a convincing movie.
It's heavily charged with all kind of sexual contacts, unforced and forced ones (by someone who is in a dominating position) and even with pure rape. It deals also with the eventual outcome of those contacts, like pregnancy and parental love.
Moreover, the story unfolds against the violent background of open racism in a country known for its apartheid.

Steve Jacobs did a formidable job in turning the harsh and sometimes bitter and terrible realities into a moving, emotional and ultimately sublime movie, which matches the book.
The director was impressively helped by his cast and in the first place by John Malkovich, whose (physical! and mental) interpretation of the very uninviting character of a sexually driven university professor is certainly one of his most memorable. He was superbly seconded by Jessica Haines as his fiercely independent daughter as well as by the rest of the cast.

A must see for all movie lovers and for all admirers J. M. Coetzee's work.",1266364800,46,1195,5.123076923076923
4070253,1,B0035ECHJ0,"Welcome to the inane world of white self-loathing. Dismising the physical and sexual violence against women, the wonton maiming and murder, and the economically debilitating theft and looting that plagues modern South Africa as the legacy of apartheid is just too convenient. Never mind that the majority of these crimes are being committed by men who came into the country after apartheid was lifted, the third-rate production values of this film are enough to belie its message as the most insipid of PC drivel. Please, suck on your lemons in private until your teeth fall out, and then count that as the down payment on your reverse-racist dues.",1442448000,2,648,5.0092592592592595
4070254,2,B0035ECHJ0,"Well 'Disgrace' is certainly the right title for this movie. It IS a disgrace.

The issue at hand is the systematic killing, the literal genocide, of white South African farmers that has been occurring since the ending of Apartheid, a story the western media refuses to touch, Nelson Mandela being a secular saint and all. (A myth that holds true only If you don't look into his actual history.)

The movie (I haven't read the book) refuses, however, to take a stand. Evil is evil only if whites commit it. So any evil committed by blacks in this story must be balanced by evil committed by whites. John Malkovich's character (David Lurie) represents the supposed evils of Apartheid. Apartheid, of course, was the system that kept white civilized people in charge of an actual functioning society; a society that has been in retrograde ever since it ended. South Africa is now the murder capital of the world.

The first forty-five minutes (I'm guessing, I'm not watching this crap again to find out) of the movie is to establish Lurie, a college professor, as ""a monster"". He has sex with a prostitute who actually rejects him, forgoing his future business! And he preys on one of his female students. Lurie comes on very strong, a characteristic completely at odds with his character at the end of the film, and completely at odds with how white, European men act in general. It's really quite ridiculous. No man who acts like this would have been able to attain Lurie's level of professional and educational achievement. The studiousness and reflection of the professor are at odds with the predation and impulsiveness of the rapist. And of course by the feminist standards of the day we are supposed to consider his encounter with the student a rape. It is not. She never refuses him. But no question, he overplays his hand.

The student and her boyfriend complain to the school, Lurie loses his job, then decides to spend some time with his lesbian daughter on the farm.

Cut to the chase, she is raped by three blacks, Lurie is dowsed in alcohol and set on fire, his car stolen, the dogs she's boarding for extra money are killed. The movie spends the rest of its time justifying the actions of the three blacks. Like I said, it's an aptly named film.

True to the current western zeitgeist, where victimhood is a recognized, even celebrated path to power, we witness Lurie's daughter resplendently bearing up. She endures one indignity after another, because what doesn't kill a feminist only makes her stronger and more beautiful, right? She refuses an abortion, opting to give birth to what will be a half-black baby that may turn out to be a half-wit as well (this latter is unmentioned, of course), owing to the mental retardation of one of the rapists. She allows that rapist to live on her property, and even defends him when her father beats him for peeping on his showering daughter.

In order that she may be protected from future rape and pillaging she agrees to marry her black handyman and give him all her land. Her father tries to talk some sense into her but she will not have it. She refuses to leave her beloved South Africa, hoping that it will one day get its act together and that the races will live in harmony to rival a Coke commercial. (Yeah, well don't hold your breath, we in the US have been waiting for that day for at least 150 years. Here's a hint: ain't gonna happen.)

It is actually laughable, the degree of absurdity that this woman will embrace to stay in this place. We are told that South Africa is beautiful. It looks like hell to me. Which is possibly the biggest problem with this film. Why on Earth would this woman cling to this life? She lives alone (except for her handyman who lives elsewhere on the property). She works hard at a subsistence existence. She has no love relationship. (Why is this character a lesbian? That element is not explored at all. It is completely superfluous.) She has no real friends. She lives under constant threat: she knows she may be killed, and fully expects to be raped again, simply because she's white. Both her father and her personal pet dog (as opposed to the kenneled dogs she was boarding) were nearly killed, both had to go to the hospital. No sane white person would stay on one of those South African farms. The movie fails to make the case for why this woman would stay. It makes no sense that she would be willing to live ""like a dog"", her own words, for no reward ... other than the much desired victimhood, and secular sainthood mentioned above.

The daughter represents hope for South Africa's beautiful, multicultural future (sarcasm). We in the west are infected with the disease called the myth of progress. We are simply unable to believe that things don't always get better. Things do not always get better. Anyone with open eyes can see that things get worse all the time, everywhere you look.

Racism is endemic to human nature. And that will not change within any time frame meaningful to anyone reading this. The attempt to balance out the evils of the genocide of white farmers in South Africa by symbolically attacking Apartheid, represented by David Lurie, is racist in itself. Whites created the nation of South Africa, bringing some semblance of civilization to even the darkest corners of that region. Apartheid was how they maintained that civilization. Now that it's gone, South Africa -- unless it's rescued by the Chinese, depending on what exploitable resources it has -- will sink back into barbarity.",1429920000,3,5522,4.701137538779731

He acts and looks his post-modern self, expressionless, emotionless, like a zombie, nothing like the prof Coetzee imagined, torn between contrary impulses.

The themes and ideas being mostly contemptible, I do not believe it can elicit pleasure from anyone. Didacticism belongs in documentaries, caricatures in comedies. The book, by the way, is merely a more subtle, detailed allegory than the movie.

As in the novel much of the film then relates the professor's experiences living with his daughter on a remote truck farm deep in the hinterland, in a sparsely populated, somewhat arid but spectacular landscape with hills like blue elephants ringing the horizon. The precariousness of his daughter's position, and her determination to atone for the larger disgrace of Apartheid, her father's helplessness when she is brutally attacked, are powerfully conveyed. The film is less successful with Lurie's initially reluctant then deeply committed involvement with an animal rescue clinic, the sorrowful satisfaction he begins to take in the grim task of putting down stray dogs.

4070270,5,B0035ECHJ0,"Great movie, but very disturbing. The movie taskes place in South Africa.

I am not sure what the book was intended to show, but if the intent was to show appeasement because all these ""poor"" adolescents suffered under the apartheid regime, that is wrong. If it is right to gang rape a woman because the grand parents of the black adolescents suffered under the Dutch colonialism, then we need to write another book how this attitude brings women's rights back two centuries.

Like I said it is a very disturbing movie. The Amazon website describes the movie as: ""DISGRACE stands out as a gritty, gripping drama of brutality, survival and hope""! Hope? Hope for what? For having thugs going unpunished after raping a decent woman who works hard for living because somehow their grandparents suffered? What kind of hope this movie portrays? I HOPE that Amazon will reconsider posting reviews by some pseudointellectuals and get some professionals with common sense.

David Lurie (outstanding performance by John Malkovich) is a university professor ""teaching"" poetic literature. He is taking advantage of a female student who is timid and was not taught the right values at home. He is pushing himself on her and she never says no. That is not the main issue of the movie because universities throughout the world are loaded with low life professors like David Lurie who really don't do much through their life because somehow they got a tenure position at a University to hide from society. John Malkovich is absolutely PERFECT in the role of a sleazy professor taking advantage of the students in many ways, including the nonsense that he is ""teaching"" in class. The parents of the girl complain against him and he is pushed out of the University because he really doesn't want to be there. After that, he is going to visit and stay with his daughter who lives in the middle of nowhere. His daughter just got separated from her girlfriend and she is alone, sad, and afraid. One day three young adolescent thugs show up at her property and perform unspeakable damage (physical and emotional) to her and to her father. And we are in for about 90 minutes of a very disturbing movie that tries to show us that it is OK to forgive and it is OK if that happens again, it is OK if they think they ""own you, after raping you"" because according to the history is justified. If you buy this attitude then you will enjoy the movie. Otherwise you will be like me, feeling a malaise throughout the entire movie.

Warning for dog lovers! If you are like me and like animals and dogs in particular, there are several hard scenes to stomach. If you like Hachi (the movie), then you will think that these very violent (emotionally) scenes (at the farm during the attacks by the adolescent thugs and at the veterinary clinic) are unnecessary. However, I think these scenes attempt to describe the lifestyle and the mentality of the major characters (including David Lurie) and probably the everyday life in South Africa. As much as Dark Tide (a really bad movie) was a great advertisement for a trip to South Africa, this movie really doesn't make South Africa and their everyday life look good and a destination where somebody will like to spend some time.

Five stars because of the performance of all actors, the subject, and the direction. The message is clear to me. Don't agree, but need to make your own opinion after going through the movie.  It is a great experience for me to see a movie like this because I know how a pacifist thinks/feels. It took a lot of restrain to keep watching it. More than once I wanted to shut the blu ray or put another movie in, but I made it to the end. Make sure you watch the extras. They are very enlightening.",1350432000,3,3735,4.6600910470409715

I think that the South African accent came across as very stilted and this influenced my opinion of the man. In the book this was not so.

One reviewer or commentor mentioned maybe it was the author of the books intention to point out what white South African's are allowing themeselves to go through is basically out of control but that's not the impression I had after watching the movie. I came out with a sense that it was portrayed as it's ok for a young white female to be gang raped by 3 black south african youth's and mistreated and have her father set on fire and to just cave in and accept it as ""the way things are"". The entire time I watched this movie I was hoping to see retribution by the father of the young woman as one would expect a loving father to do but alas, the father and daughter accept there mistreatment at the hands of their black African neighbors. I don't know if the author of the book/movie director was trying to say ""hey, these evil white oppressors deserve this"" or ""Hey, stand up for yourself as it's as much your country (whites) as theirs (blacks)"" but I'll leave that debate to others.

4070277,5,B0035ECHJ0,"David Lurie, performed with agonizing acuity by John Malkovich, is a scholar of English Romantic poetry at a University in Cape Town, an admirer particularly of Byron, about whose life in Italy he's fitfully trying to compose an opera. Our first look at Lurie in the film finds him lecturing, as bored with and contemptuous of his students as they are of him. Oh no, another burnt-out professor, another victim of mid-life self-disgust! Ah, but Lurie is also a sexual predator -- Lord Byron's Don Juan, Mozart's Don Giovanni -- who forces himself upon a mixed-race student and is quite properly bounced out of the university. Malkovich's Lurie is insufferable, a narcissist so arrogant in manner that one hopes to see him disgraced. How much reality can such a smug jerk bear, you ask. Can Don Juan survive his own futility and insignificance? But Lurie has a daughter (the mother divorced him years ago and lives in Holland) whom he apparently loves and who seemingly accepts his love despite her restrained scorn for his disgraceful behavior. The daughter is a Lesbian, but her partner has left her. She lives on a remote farm, with a market garden and a dog kennel, and now-jobless Lurie goes there for emotional refuge, like a dog licking its wounds. It's a dangerous place, rural South African, but the daughter is as profoundly committed to ""finding a way to live in intolerable times"" as other South African writers have depicted themselves to be. Bad stuff happens predictably; the daughter is raped, Lurie beaten and set aflame, all the dogs shot, and life is supposed to ignore its own yesterdays and accommodate its griefs on account of their inevitability. After the hideous violations of humanity called History in South Africa, Justice can only be unjust.

""Disgrace"" is essentially a double vision of Don Juan in Hell. David Lurie's struggle to ""find a way to live"" with his intolerable humiliation is inseparable from White South Africa's struggle to ""find a way to live"" with the results of its cultural rape of Black South Africa over centuries of history. The two themes are stunningly well intermingled in this complex and excruciating film. And how should we take the ending? The daughter is pregnant from the rape, Lurie can't persuade her to have an abortion, he flees from her farm in despair, and then he returns on her terms. Hey, I've told too much of the script, haven't I? But at least I can leave you to formulate your own interpretations.

This is an Australian production, based on a novel by J.M. Coetzee. Malkovich is the only internationally know actor in it, but the rest of the cast is supremely skillful. I haven't seen a more powerful movie in years.",1321574400,3,2689,4.830802603036877
4070278,5,B0035ECHJ0,"Note: Major details of the film are given, but this review does not take away the viewer's own visceral experience.

Disgrace--the title of this film, is a title both direct and symbolic. It depicts a new South Africa, one that disallows apartheid, one that shows--through transparent subtlety--how black South Africans can ""take back"" their country. Of course, the acting of John Malkovich pushes this subtlety through the gauzy haze of old prejudices into a reverse and perverse form of new racism.

""Think of where we are"" is spoken by all of the major characters in contexting various events. But this destructive racism committed by both sides is not the only theme in this transforming film that shows consequences of, not only behavior, but the thought processes behind that behavior.

The film opens by introducing the terrain of the major players: South Africa's veldt country. It's dry but can be cultivated through irrigation. Cultivated by irrigation. Into this landscape comes David Lurie, an English professor who recently lost his position because of his ""lurid"" activities. David was fired because of a sexual encounter with a beautiful young student. He arrives at his daughter's house in this landscape. She makes a living at growing flowers and vegetables in this soil. She is a planter. She also has a kennel of dogs (companions to people). And, most importantly in title context, Lucy is lesbian. The last major character, though minor in play time, is Petrus, a black South Africa reflective of the new success and power of his people. He lives in a shed and has free roam of the land and even the daughter's house. A new South African reality--at this point neither good nor bad, but David raises alarms at this freedom he sees.

Then comes the initiating incident, one that incites a new direction, raises horrible alarms: Lucy is raped by three black thugs, who kill all the dogs, steal her major possessions, and burn David by throwing gasoline over him and igniting it with the flick of a match. A new reality of South Africa--violent, hostile behavior by black South Africans who have not been educated or even trained for freedom. Their thoughts and behavior ooze from a rancid, bitter past--take what you can and destroy what you can.

On the other hand another breed of black South Africa has learned insinuation. He works on Lucy's land with a promise of obtaining his own land from her generous spirit. He is a hard worker, indeed. The viewer can see that in most of his scenes. However, that old worm in the apple has plans for more and insinuates himself toward that end.

It is Petrus behind Lucy's rape--through the actions of his wife's mentally deficient brother. The barren lesbian learns she is pregnant (irrigated) and makes a deal with Petrus: her land in exchange for protection, her baby to lock her into his family and thus protection. There's more--and that takes the viewer to the title again: disgrace. What is the disgrace in this tragic story--her rape, her acquiescence, David's own brutish behavior, a changing of the guard to right a wrong, thus a right to make a wrong?

""Disgrace"" is a painful film to watch, but the viewer learns a little more about ""the human condition,"" one reflecting growth, but unlike the healthy growth of Lucy's plants, to a propagated version. Is it better? Worse? Is it just Is?

The film is based on the novel of the same title by the South African writer J. M. Coetzee.",1319155200,4,3454,4.842372881355932

4070285,5,B0035ECHJ0,"This film adaptation of the prize winning novel by South African author J.J. Coetzee is an introspective study of a time and a place and a people during a time of change.  I read the book in 2001 and reviewed it then.  Now, ten years later, I had forgotten some of the details of the book but its impact on the screen startled me awake to my memories of reading it.  This is not a happy story, but it is intensely moving and the casting of the film was excellent.

John Malkovich is cast in the leading role of a middle-aged English Professor who bores his students, patronizes prostitutes and pushes one of his students into an unwanted affair with him.  After this affair is discovered he is disgraced.  He then goes to the countryside to live with his grown daughter where there are few white people and  a rising tide of unrest as the social structure is rapidly changing due to the end of Apartheid.  His daughter lives alone, volunteering at a dog kennel and selling produce.  Suddenly, there is an act of violence which turns their lives around.

The John Malkovich character is not a likable person.  He is flawed, stubborn and vulnerable.  And yet he's a human being with all the warts and foibles that make him real.  And in many ways, his daughter is very much like him.  This is a well crafted story with every minor character having a purpose and outstanding performances by the whole cast.  Yes, this film it is sad and depressing, but it was so well crafted and the story so strong that it left me with a deeper understanding of human nature as well as a snapshot of life in South Africa.",1295222400,,1603,4.441780821917808
4070286,4,B0035ECHJ0,"As with most movies John Malkovich contributes to, ""Disgrace"" is excellent.  His portrayal of a shamed college professor, David Lurie, who 'resigns' from his job following an incident involving one of his students is memorable.  His aloof obnoxiousness comes across in a big way.

Although Malkovich has the lead, Jessica Haines' portrayal of his daughter Lucy is key to the movie's theme.  After Professor Lurie's resignation, he moves to a rural, but dangerous area to stay with Lucy.  As Lucy, Haines has the difficult job of trying to get the audience to sympathize with the seemingly implausible decisions she makes after she and her father are victimized by a gang of young thugs.  The movie then focuses on the relationship between father and daughter during this trying period.

The plot may seem a bit disorienting, but the film is based upon a novel of the same name.  The setting is post-apartheid South Africa and as a viewer, you are able to see the contrasts between pre- and post-Mandella South Africa, especially the differences in status of the white minority population.  The racial relations between the rural neighbors also affects how the storyline plays out.

If you're looking for a fast-paced movie, this is not the place.  However, if you're looking for a solid drama with an interesting plot, you might enjoy taking a gander at ""Disgrace"".",1286496000,3,1365,4.995575221238938
4070287,5,B0035ECHJ0,"One reviewer on Amazon of the printed book said he found a copy thrown away on the roadside.  He picked it up and read it.  Amusingly, he said that after reading it, decided to dispose of ""Disgrace"" properly this time: by tearing it up and putting it into the proper place - a trash bin.

$30 (price on Amazon at the time of this review) is a costly gamble, even for an exotic art house Blu-ray.  In contrast, a wildly more entertaining Blu-ray package, like the entire season 1 of Spartacus: Blood and Sand in Blu-ray costs only marginally more at $35.  I mentioned Spartacus because I had a hard time deciding which fictional story was harder to believe: Disgrace or Spartacus.

For scenic beauty of rural South Africa in Blu-ray, Disgrace is worth the money.  In time to come, such scenes would need help from CGI.  The Australian movie company filmed the movie in South Africa.  Australian terrain is similar, but the ""ambience"" would not be right.

(Zhang Yimou, the Chinese film director, once complained that it is increasingly harder to shoot movies set in rural Chinese areas.  The increasing cost of transporting film crews to places far away from cities, lack of hotel accommodation and facilities in outlying areas, logistics and so on, can make a movie shot in a simple remote village prohibitively expensive.  A satellite dish or a condominium block in the background kills historical authenticity.)

Disgrace is true to the text, although it has been massively abridged in the movie version.  I have not experienced a John Malkolvich movie moving along at such a fast pace.  As a movie, Disgrace is a straightforward story.  It is a bullet point summary of JM Coetzee's novel, without much of the allegorical nuances.

Visual depiction of intense culture shock and outrageous societal violence is nicely done in Disgrace, just as Spartacus tests boundaries for graphic violence.

Three scenes stay in my mind:

1. The University class taught by John Malkovich was poorly represented by black students.

2. John Malkovich was badly burnt on the face and body, but at the clinic, the white man was ordered to queue behind 20-odd black patients who look like non-urgent routine follow-up cases to me.  Never ever going to happen in real life. Ultimate fiction.

3. In the ""Behind the Scenes"" special feature, it is still the white man doing the directing, and the black man doing the moving of the props.

If you are intellectually inclined, you will enjoy looking for facets of the story, which are metaphorical parodies, as you would with ""Animal Farm"".  The metaphors chosen by the author could not be more unfortunate in being odious.  The Booker and Nobel committees somehow consider them politically correct.

After watching the movie, I understood more than from the book, why white folk fled in droves to Australia and New Zealand.  JM Coetzee himself never gave a reason why he emigrated from South Africa to Adelaide, a super-white city in Australia, after being awarded the Nobel Prize.  Disgrace, after all, is supposed to be a story of hope for a post-apartheid South Africa - but the author emigrated.

As a work of fiction, many scenarios are more improbable than those in Spartacus, so it is left to the actors in Disgrace to make the audience suspend disbelief.  John Malkovich raised the bar for all the other actors.  I see an uncanny physical resemblance between John Malkovich and JM Coetzee, or do all white folk look the same to us. I am keeping this movie as a great cinematographic record of rural South Africa in a chapter of South Africa's history.

This movie is unusual in that it actually adds more dimensions to the book, which I previously did not believe could be made into a fascinating movie.",1285372800,3,3739,4.830188679245283

His lack of participation in his ""trial"" by merely stating he was guilty reminded me of ""The Stranger"" by Camus. I actually found his ability to resist the collective coercion to make an appearance of remorse interesting. He dismissed them as they dismissed him.. so to speak. And that is bad, very bad. His daughter accepting rape on a regular basis by south african youths as her ""punishment""? or redemption is just nauseating. A healthy organism will not voluntarily put up with such abuse.
