8574200,2,B00BUT6ODW,"I purchased this movie because it said it featured Phil Ochs and Abbie Hoffman. Ochs says one line and is only featured for 10 seconds. The same clip of Ochs is available in ""There But For Fortune"".  Hoffman is only featured for a little over 10 minutes. He does give an interesting, but highly edited speech.

The rest of the movie focuses on ""troubled"" youth in New York. But they're really just some spoiled, bratty kids who are hopped up on dope and don't want to work or go to school. One is really creepy and tries to sell spooky drawings to a newspaper.

I would recommend this title to anyone who has $22 and one hour to spare. But even then, - just buy porn or something. This isn't worth a dime and should be available for free use.",1394668800,,742,4.285714285714286
8574201,3,B00BUT6ODW,"For anyone interested in hearing something new from Phil Ochs, this is not a place to start.  It is mostly point of views from various people from the movement.  Not enough of Abbie Hoffman and Phil Ochs, but Abbie does have a couple interesting comments, especially his talk to the parent association.  You can see he even surprised himself with what he had to say.  This is an extremely dry video and should only be purchased if you need it for a class or a die hard from that period of time.",1377475200,2,494,4.336956521739131
