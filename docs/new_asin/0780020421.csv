And excellent series, of which I would love to see more!

Billington's excellent ""The Icon & the Axe"", a study in Russian culture and philosophy, is a wonderful companion work.",1165449600,,267,4.215686274509804
7789685,4,0780020421,"Face of Russia, the boxed set, offers the most comprehensive look into Russian art, history, and culture available thus far.  However, it is not thorough enough to evoke a five star rating, simply because of the enormity of Russia and its history.
The tapes are an excellent way to get an over view of Russia, and even follow some elements further in depth.  It does not, however, give a comprehensive overview of Russia.
One of the highlights of the film is that it travels outside the big cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg, showing Russian culture from many perspectives, including the rural one.
The narrator brings us to some of the most beautiful cathedrals and shows us some of the most brilliant works of art known to man.  His descriptions and enthusiasm are not lost on the audience.  The narrator pulls us into each subject enticing us to learn more.
I suppose that is the main problem.  With the excitement of the narrator for his subject, and my present interest in Russian culture, this set left me thirsting for more information.
Hopefully, some day, we will see a comprehensive set of videos released on Russia, it's history, art, and culture.  Until then, this set will have to do, supplemented by other various sources.
Do not fear this tape set if you are not particularly familiar with Russia.  I sat down to watch it, and my 12-year old sister sat down beside me, just as interested.  It is a wonderful series for everyone!
Enjoy! 6/5/02",1023235200,6,1459,4.716535433070866
7789686,5,0780020421,"This 3 tape set is beautifully directed by Murray Grigory, and written and hosted by James Billington, who obviously has much affection for his subject matter.
Tape # 1, ""The Face on the Firewood"": This starts with the extraordinary icon ""Lady of Vladimir"" and spends time exploring how icons survived through time and many wars, and gives many examples, including my favorite, Rublev's ""Trinity"". It also shows how modern art was influenced by this art form, showing pictures by Kandinsky and Malevich to prove the point.
Other subjects covered are church bells, onion domes, Stalin's destruction of sacred objects, and the Russian tendency to make things bigger than necessary.
Tape # 2, ""The Facade of Power"": Starts with the Kremlin, and then moves to St. Petersburg, showing how it was built, and it's elaborate, lavish palaces...then to the baroque mid 18th century Church of St. Andrew in Kiev, so far removed from the old churches of Russia. Gone were the intensely spiritual icons, replaced by ornate gold and European style paintings.
It also explores the magical writings of Gogol.
Tape 3, ""Facing the Future"": The resurgence of religion, the music of Mussorgsky (with marvelous clips from a 1954 filmed version of ""Boris Godunov""), and the films of Sergei Eisenstein...it also includes clips from Georgian director Tenghiz Abuladze's amazing ""Repentance"".
This tape is perhaps my favorite, with it's emphasis on music and film.
A great set for anyone interested in Russian culture, each tape is 55 minutes long, and extremely educational as well as entertaining.",1000857600,12,1574,5.200787401574803
7789687,3,0780020421,"A beautiful tour through the art,culture, history and religion (yes, that too!) focusing on contemporary problems, the difficulties of change in a still suffering land. Of particular interest to me was the resurrection of  Russian religious life, poignantly demonstrated by the rebuilding of the  Church of Christ the Saviour (destroyed by Stalin). An excellent  introduction to understanding the many enigmas of this land with something  for everyone as Billington provides a good narration with and excellent  introduction to Russian culture. Music fans will be delighted with the  glimpse of Mussourgsky,  and a brief interview with Rostropovich.  Literature is not neglected either. A beautiful show!",943401600,12,704,5.701923076923077
