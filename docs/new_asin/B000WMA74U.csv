2983956,2,B000WMA74U,"I was very upset especially when I watched the superbowl dvd. First, no even quick intro to let us know that the game we are about to watch is superbowl 34. They show Curt Warner and straight to the opening kickoff nothing even resembling an introduction. Once a field goal, or extra point is hit or missed,right away it fades to black and goes to the next play or kickoff. You would expect to at least let the broadcaster finish his sentence and show the score before going to the next play. It goes a little like this ""the field goal is good- 2 seconds later- the kickoff on the way""  The superbowl dvd also has alot of plays missing, they don't show the complete drive that leads to the rams second field goal which is big because there is a dropped pass in the endzone that leads to the rams having to kick the field goal. On that drive,they show the first down play then seconds later they show the rams kicking the ball off with 3 to 4 minutes taken off the clock and the rams going from up 3-0 to 6-0. If I would've known this I would not have ordered the dvd's, especially when after each game the game ends quickly and you don't even see the final score on the screen like you normally would after a game, its really bad with the superbowl when you see the amazing final play, then seconds later THAT'S IT.",1240531200,3,1315,4.239043824701195
2983957,4,B000WMA74U,"I bought these DVDs as a native St. Louisan and Rams fan, and have enjoyed them tremendously.  Just watching the first quarter of the Divisional Playoff game against the Vikings was reason enough to put a smile on my face.  Watching Warner, Faulk, & Bruce steamroll through the Vikings defense like they're not even there is loads of fun and makes you nostalgic for the glory days of the Greatest Show on Earth (or Turf, as Warren Sapp would later call it).

I do agree with some of the other comments about the abrupt transitions following scoring drives; it's quite odd to not let Pat Summerall even finish his sentences before fading to black.  Something else was even more bizarre, though.  The DVD package comes with a sticker on the front stating that this commemorates the Rams run to ""Super Bowl XXXV"".  What the fudge?!  Every Rams fan knows Super Bowl XXXIV was the one that ended with Mike Jones' tackle.  SB XXXV didn't even feature the Rams, it was Ravens over Giants, for Pete's sake!  Stuff like this gives the impression of a slapped-together product hastily assembled in an Indonesian sweatshop by malnourished orphans and put out for a quick buck.

Still, it's definitely worth the money for me to see these classic games again and relive the exhilaration of the Super Bowl THIRTY-FOUR run.  Loved it!  Go Rams!",1203638400,3,1329,4.730434782608696
2983958,1,B000WMA74U,"FYI - These games are not complete.  The Super Bowl game has 13 plays edited out of it, including nearly all of a Rams scoring drive in the second quarter.  The fades to and from commercials are the most abrupt I've seen yet.  They don't even let the announcer finish a sentence.  Also, the disc ends with the most exciting final play of a Super Bowl, and they cut it off immediately after the official rules Dyson down.  A couple of different replay angles sure would have been nice.  Oh yeah, one other thing - the aspect ratio is listed in the product detail as being 1.66:1.  It isn't.  It's actually 1.33:1.",1202515200,36,612,4.401785714285714

The makers of this DVD could not even wait for certain sentences out of the broadcasters mouths to be finished before they fade out to the next segments.  Many replays are gone and there is no pre-game coverage.  The thing that disappointed and actually shocked me the most though was on the Super Bowl disc. Just over 5 seconds after the game ends, the DVD ends!!!  After the most memorable finish in Super Bowl history, there is absolutely no coverage of post game or celebration of ANY kind!!!  Why???  Most people who are interested in purchasing this collection are probably Rams fans.  Did they think we would be bored by watching the COMPLETE broadcast?  If you already have a decent copy of these games recorded from television, do yourself a favor and hold on to those instead of buying this.  If you are a casual fan, I suppose it's better than nothing.",1199059200,28,1003,4.712643678160919

The local economy nor the Exchange sell such an item, so that added to my thrill. Well once I viewed the video I was surprised to find no footage of O J Simpson, just career stats. Contrary to 1994 and all the media hype surrounding his ex-wife's grusome death, O J was the measuring stick that all running backs were measured. I think the person or persons who put this video together aught to be ashamed of themselves for snubbing the first player to rush for 2000 yards in a season. All that I can say is that films do not lie and he is definately one of the top 5 running backs ever to put a uniform on.",1113436800,,740,4.181818181818182
2983963,4,B000WMA74U,"This is a pretty good documentary of football. It shows the intimidators, the underdogs and the best plays of the NFL. I think that there aren't enough hits on this DVD. It talks alot about the history of the game which is great if you like that stuff. If you have an all time favorite player, then he is on this DVD. Basically you will like this DVD if you are a fan of football. If you are looking for big hits then look somewhere else though.
NOTE:  This DVD is the worst organized DVD I have ever seen.  To find all the bonus footage, you have to scroll through hundreds of players in a hit or miss kind of way.  It almost seems that they crammed too much on this DVD. Also, the DVD is seperated into chapters and you can't rewind from one chapter into another.  That makes it hard to watch something at the end of a chapter.

8223860,5,B000WMA74U,"I'm a lifetime Rams' fan and this is the collection of a lifetime. The 1999-2000 Rams are one of the NFL's all-time teams and they are the Rams who rewarded my loyalty. This collection evoked all the excitement and thrills I remember experiencing during this Rams team's Super Bowl progression. And surprisingly, it documents a Rams team that was not the magnificent, stupendous, dominating, infallible team 15 years had erected in my memory. If you're anything like the Rams' fan I am, you remember the Super Bowl Champions as incredible, unstoppable, destined, ""The Greatest Show on Turf.""
Brilliant as they were, these Rams got sloppy and over-confident during the last quarter of their play-off game against the Vikings. The victory over Tampa Bay was not the calculated, crafty, last-play theater my memory has held it to be for 15 years. And the Super Bowl was not the dominate finale my fans' memory has carried for more than a decade. The Rams beat a very, very good Titans' team which earned its thrilling, last play opportunity to win the game.
To be sure, this collection documents that Kurt Warner is a spectacularly skilled QB, Marshall Faulk is as Hall of Fame worthy as any running back who ever played in the NFL, and Dick Vermeil assembled and coached his players and his staff as intelligently, wisely and to their optimum capability as any coach, ever.
But this Rams team was not as perfect or invincible as my memory wants them to be. And this DVD collection is all the better, all the more precious to me, as faithful and staunch a Rams' fan as lives, for documenting that. This collection makes these, my beloved '99 Rams, the Super Bowl Champion Rams of 2000, legitimate. They weren't fated, destined or supreme. They were a team that played their best when their best, for six spectacular months could, should, would and DID make them champions.
That game winning play was the result of a season's work. You can see it as one, game-winning, season-making play. Or you can see it as the climax of a season's work, the thousands of plays that set the stage for that play. As a Rams' fan, I believe the team earned that play. And this DVD collection is proof of that.
To be sure, there are valid complaints and criticisms to be made of this collection; but none of the complaints of missing footage (for all the effort and commitment by NFL Films, video deteriorates) and grumbling and grousing for replay and post-game footage,
can diminish how accurately, how completely, this collection documents the '99-'00 Rams as one of the most exciting and championship worthy teams in the NFL's history. By season's end, after all the play-off games, and at the Super Bowl's conclusion, this collection proves that this Rams' team had, not just the league's best offense, but a defense worthy of the offense they defended. The ""Greatest Show on Turf"" scored enough to win 16 games. And that offense won the Super Bowl (and the NFC Championship game, the game which I regard as the most exciting, memorable of the 800+  Rams' games for which I have been ""ALWAYS a Rams' fan) because their defense...defended. To wit, Kurt Warner led offenses ""won"" two more Super Bowls, but Warner has only one ring because, in the end, his team's defenses couldn't protect the leads their offenses created.
I would have paid the price for this set JUST to have the official, NFL Films' record of that epic, spectacular game against Tampa Bay. But...BONUS!...I got the rout of the Vikings and the Titan-ic Super Bowl as part of the package.
But its that victory over the Buccaneer's that keeps climbing into my DVD player's tray.  And more than anything, this is what speaks to the value of this DVD collection:

...I know the plot, I know the script from memory, I know how the ""story"" ends. But this DVD set is of the source material of my memories. I wasn't at any of these games, I watched the television broadcasts of them. So these DVDs replay the games exactly, EXACTLY as I saw them: No distortions, elaborations or diminishings intrude. For me, this DVD set recreates perfectly my experience of the '99-'00 Rams march from desperation to Oct. 18, 1999 (""Who IS This Guy""...look it up) to the most unlikely touchdown (Warner to Prohl) in NFL Championship history to their defiance of ""The Music City Miracle.""  I love that experience.

And its here, for me, for all Rams' fans, on this video. Forever....",1435449600,,4408,4.749347258485639
