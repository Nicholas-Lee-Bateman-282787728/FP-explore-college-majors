8534046,4,B0091D47YC,"Well acted with an interesting plot. Not sure I'd call it a ""war"" more like a scrimmage where the cartel loses a battle with a special police unit but they certainly don't lose the war. I'd rate this a B+ film that is entertaining and worth a watch. Nice LA locations with some great cars and a nice yacht. Recommended.",1515110400,,319,4.333333333333333
8534047,4,B0091D47YC,"Too bad it was mono audio and not stereo or 5.1 surround. The picture was excellent: 16:9. The story was excellent. The action and violence was very good: lots of shooting, punching and kicking.",1511308800,,194,4.735294117647059

8534050,1,B0091D47YC,"Might actually be a good movie - who knows? I made it thru 8 minutes before quitting. The fatal flaw is - it is completely unwatchable due to that overused, hackneyed ""shaky camera"" style of filming. When the hell are directors gonna get tired of it? It's a distracting cheap trick to cover lack of truly good directing/editing.",1359331200,,328,4.672413793103448
8534051,5,B0091D47YC,"This was a pleasant surprise, expected way less and was totally caught off guard.  Sound track, visuals / photography... all amazing for a low budget film. Shot in So Cal, if you know the area even better. (like a native San Franciscan watching a Dirty Harry movie, it just makes sense)  Plot works, lots of blood and good looking women, hard not to love this movie and have watched it twice already. (first time I never left the couch for the entire movie)  Parts are full of suspense, other scenes have almost a Pulp Fiction like feel to them. Hard to explain but totally cool. All said and done, a boatload of ""flick"" for the money.",1355702400,3,635,4.456896551724138
