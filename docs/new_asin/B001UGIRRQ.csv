3798260,4,B001UGIRRQ,"I'm reviewing the CD/DVD combo, and most of it is really nothing new to fans of BLS. The CD is really nothing special, since we're just a few years removed from Kings of Damnation, but it's got a Pride & Glory song (Machine Gun Man) and a bunch of BLS ""greatest hits"" tracks then a few unplugged type versions of songs (The Blessed Hellride, Spoke In The Wheel, Stillborn).

The best part is really the DVD disc, except that most is regurgiated. It's got live tracks that have been previously released on the 2 live DVDs (4 total) plus music videos (Stillborn, Suicide Messiah, In This River, Fire It Up, New Religion), a good interview that's pretty comical and entertaing plus some live acoustic versions (slightly amped it says) of The Blessed Hellride, Spoke In The Wheel, We Live No More and Stillborn.

All-in-all if you're a BLS fan you've seen and heard most of this but it's still a very nicely packaged, cheap collections of very good stuff. Nothing to bitch about here really. Throw on your sleeveless leather BLS vest, pound your chest and spit in your living room floor as you rock this at max volume you f'n beserkers.

Zakk is just givin' the dog a bone here.",1241136000,6,1174,4.5545023696682465

Also, for those who does not own every album from BLS  [it's not my case...] this cd/dvd is an excellent way to get songs from all of Zakk's carreer. I specially enjoyed the inclusion of the acoustic versions and the BLS guitar picks in the box! :)
