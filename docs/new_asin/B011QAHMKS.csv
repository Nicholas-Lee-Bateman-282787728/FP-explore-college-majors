8724920,5,B011QAHMKS,"This must rank as one of the most successful concerts yet delivered within this complete series. That impression is gained, not only by observing the particularly enthusiastic, responsive but well-behaved audience, but also by an awareness of considerable numbers of alternative CD recordings made over many years of the individual items on this very popular concert program.

Rattle is clearly on top form and brings an enquiring mind to bear on each individual item but without ever losing spontaneity. This is a valuable combination that cannot always be guaranteed. Consequently there is much subtle detail brought out in the quieter and more reflective moments of The opening Berlioz overture, the Debussy Prelude, the Dukas' Sorcerer as well as Bolero. This is balanced by impressive corporate playing by the orchestra at climatic moments, of which there are many.

The Labeque sisters are the featured soloists for the night and deliver a contrasting pair of pieces. The Poulenc Concerto for 2 Pianos has an abundance of spiky moments typical of the composer as well as moments of lyrical tenderness. Both of these elements are brought out strongly and with evident virtuosity. The more 'tongue in the cheek' side of the piece is less apparent as the very opening makes clear. This remains a fine and distinguished performance if emphasising the drive rather than the humour of the work. Much the same can be said of the Saint Saens Carnival. These hens are more battery than free ranging and the swift animals, usually described as wild asses, are particularly focussed on speed! However as the piece continues the interpretation relaxes considerably and there are plenty of good humoured moments which are much enjoyed by the crown who supply plenty of interim applause.

Rattle supplies the bass drum in the concluding Berliner Luft.

Technically this is a stereo offering good stereo which benefits by a lift to the volume to add more body to the sound. This is a match for CD sound of the same period in 'live' situations. The visuals are involving in an established manner nicely combining a range of performer and audience shots giving plenty of relevant detail without intrusion. This is good SD recording rather than HD. Heard as audio playback without visuals for example, the disc comes over as good competitive sound.

The lack of HD recording was apparently an unfortunate slip-up where there was no immediate HD team available for the occasion. Bearing in mind the quality of the music making and the sheer enjoyment of the occasion, this is a particular shame but no good reason to withhold a high ranking for the disc.

This then is a stand-out example of these Waldbuhne concerts which should give enormous amounts of pleasure to most purchasers",1446249600,,2769,5.034934497816594
