You can literally fast-forward 43 minutes and miss NOTHING.

Oh, what happens for the first 43 minutes you ask? Well, beyond a poorly edited introduction with a narration that contradicts itself, it's mostly comprised of the unlikable characters talking/improvising about ghosts while they go to a mansion that may or may not be haunted. Following this, a literal 30 minutes is spent with the characters walking around the house while a dimwitted cop exposits a thoroughly stupid story about the house. Then, they set up cameras. This is literally all that happens within 43 minutes of the movie. And really, by the hour mark, the only thing the movie has offered is a sex scene with some CG fire.

None of the characters are satirical extensions of Scooby-Doo, they do next to nothing and the filmmakers didn't even once try to make light of their ghost-hunting group or even try to achieve/parody what even the synopsis says the movie is about! Hell, the guy with the sack and chainsaw on the cover isn't even in the movie!

If you watch this, get ready for zero surprises, lots of bad camera work that seems like nothing was planned and they just shot on the fly, terrible/obviously forced improv, plot points that go nowhere and terrible editing.",1473465600,,1313,4.79646017699115
