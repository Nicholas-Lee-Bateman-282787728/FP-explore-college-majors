8498720,5,B006IJOADK,Seen this movie on television and enjoyed  it very much. Tried to purchase the English DVD but could not find it. When I saw the Blu--ray available I purchased it but did not realize it was the German version. I returned it and later found that it had the English version on the same Blu-ray. I went ahead and reordered and was happy I did because I really like the show. I only purchase the ones that I know I will watch again and again. If you like the pirate shows fantasy you should like this one. I really do like Adrian Paul as an actor.,1395014400,4,543,4.122641509433962
