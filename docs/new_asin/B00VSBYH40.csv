7101336,5,B00VSBYH40,"Most TV shows spun off from movies are uninvolving and uninteresting (""Blade,"" anyone?), and utterly fail to embody whatever made the original story interesting.

But such wasn't the case with ""Stargate SG-1,"" spun off from one of the few good movies Roland Emmerich ever made, about a massive alien ring that allowed instant interstellar travel. Starting as a simple exploration series, the series expanded into a brilliant tangle of politics, aliens, and Earth's spirit and guts -- excellent writing, acting, and a sense of humor about itself and its characters.

The Stargate has been inactive for a year... until a bunch of Egyptian-styled warriors come through and kidnap an officer. General Hammond (Don S. Davis) pulls Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) out of retirement, and sends him to Abydos to find out what happened. O'Neill is reunited with Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) -- only to have Daniel's wife and brother-in-law abducted by the evil Apophis. A rescue attempt sparks off a war with the Goa'uld -- aliens who have been impersonating human gods for many centuries.

So the team SG-1 -- made up of O'Neill, Jackson, scientist/pilot Sam Carter (Amanda Tapping) and Apophis' ex-slave Teal'c (Christopher Judge) -- explore through the Stargate, finding plenty of hostile aliens, strange allies (the Unas, the Asgard), and humans scattered all over. Not to mention the gate-builders, who have ascended to another plane. Frst they battle the arrogant Apophis, then the devil-imitating So'kar, and the malignant half-energy Anubis and his army of undead warriors. The Goa'uld power structure starts to splinter, and new secret organizations make power plays on Earth, as SG-1 uncovers the hidden legacies of humanity's ancestors.

Even after the Goa'uld storyline ends, things haven't ended for SG-1. Cameron Mitchell (Ben Browder) is given command of SG-1, and manages to gather the disbanded team back together, with the help of a quirky alien mercenary, Vala Mal Doran (Claudia Black). Together, they find that the Milky Way faces its most deadly threat ever -- the Ori, evil ascended beings who demand that everyone worship them... or else.

Previously all ""exploration"" sci-fi focused on people on ships. ""Stargate"" avoids the usual space opera approach -- even when ships are introduced, the main focus is on walking through a big stone ring that instantly zaps a person to another planet. It's also full of real military, political battles (both on and off Earth), and a very plausible reason why everybody in the galaxy (more or less) looks just like us.

It's graced with elaborate, opulant sets, solid special effects, shoot-'em-up action from Marines and Air Force, and some truly kinetic space battles (including one that resembles the climax of ""Star Wars IV""). The storyline stumbles somewhat in the last two seasons, with the sudden switch in villains and cast. But all ten seasons are sprinkled with very warm human moments -- Daniel's farewell to his wife, Sam bonding with a doomed little girl, and Teal'c's struggle for freedom.

Best of all is the snappy script. Some of it comes from Teal'c (""Undomesticated equines could not remove me""), but mostly from the tart-tongued O'Neill (""Well, I guess we all start shooting. There's blood, death, hard feelings... it'd suck""). Other characters get great lines too ("" I think the circle means 'the place of our legacy'...or it could be 'a piece of our leg', but the first seems to make more sense"").

The cast is nothing short of brilliant -- Anderson does a quirky, disrespectful, pop culture-lovin' guy with a hidden tragic past, while Tapping and Shanks are great as an enthusiastic geek and a smart, capable military woman. And Judge is absolutely astounding as Teal'c, who slowly turns from a stoic, tragic warrior to a warm legendary hero. Corin Nemec had a one-season stint as Daniel's ""replacement,"" and he makes a nice, eager young newbie, while Ben Browder channels much of O'Neill's quirkiness when Anderson left. Black is kind of annoying at times, but she's admittedly quite funny and quirky, with a tragic past of her own.

""Stargate SG-1"" is undeniably the best TV spinoff, and one of the best ""exploration"" shows to make it onto the air... and stay there for a whole decade. Definitely worth seeing, from beginning to end.",1439337600,14,4319,5.106232294617564
7101337,5,B00VSBYH40,Excellent series.  I've watched the entire series at least five times and still see something new in each episode each time I view them.,1439251200,3,136,4.666666666666667

7101343,5,B00VSBYH40,"An entertaining sci-fi collection spanning 10 seasons.  The characters will grow on you, perhaps.  45 minute episodes w/o commercials are do-able and small delights.  Seldom did I find an episode I thought, ""Move on, this is boring.  Write better stuff.""  Perhaps you will find yourself analyzing their moves like I did, wondering if there was a better way.  Well, it's not the most outstanding stuff I've ever watched, but some of the episodes were certainly fun.  I watched everyone of them by now--and in a few years I plan to do it again!",1505001600,2,542,4.763440860215054

When I ordered the product from westcoastmedia, the delivery was prompt and on time, with no order/delivery problems.  The only problem so far with DVDs is the sound track is a bit low, need to turn the volume up quite a bit to hear the dialogue.  If I play audio thru Stereo system, can get good volume.

The English subtitles do NOT work....which is extremely problematic for me, as I wear 2 hearing aids. However, If I spoke French, no problem.  I do not understand how I purchased NEW dvds and ENGLISH is NOT offered as a subtitle.  I believe if you are selling this here in the U.S., you should mention that ENGLISH subtitles are NOT offered.  I would definitely NOT have bought it.  :(  I know it is not our machine, as the subtitles work on everything else.  :(  So now I am stuck with TEN seasons of watching with NO SUB TITLES!  :(",1465344000,18,658,4.327868852459017

Came back next night and can't get past the first episode on the second disk or any disk without having remote control up and down arrows. I lost my remote and usually can FF through first or second episode to view latter episodes. But these just Loop back to beginning of first episode on disk. So must have a remote.

I don't mean the disk within the boxes, but the episodes on the disk themselves.  Its as if the company didn't realize that each episode builds upon those that came before it.  Theyre just randomly on the disk.  In other words, Season One Disk Two has episodes that are from completely different seasons of the series.  Additionally, the show appears to be in Blue Ray.  Either that, or my HDTV has found a new means to upscale the video of these disk far more than it has for any other disk.  It even managed to make them wide screen.  I hadnt purchased this earlier because I couldn't find the series advertised on Blur Ray.  The set doesnt indicate that its Blueray anywhere on the packaging or disk themselves.  This was the first purchase of what I thought were regular DVDs since I had switched to Blueray in the first place, which was when Blueray first came out.  I used to have Sonys original Blueray player, but moved on because it couldn't update itself over the Internet.
