6045430,5,B00G2O4PQS,"For a low budget first film by Matt Adams this was pretty good. I see him doing greater  films in the near future.
I could see how Matt, all the actors & actresses, crew did a great job in this film :) Loved it !!!!

6045433,1,B00G2O4PQS,The three who said it was good or had potential must be related to whomever created it.  Watch something else.,1388102400,12,110,4.5

6045436,5,B00G2O4PQS,Loved it. Didn't expect the surprising twist. Hope to see more from this up and coming director Matthew Adams. Definitely worth buying.,1382486400,,135,5.181818181818182
8620230,2,B00G2O4PQS,"I did not like this movie. This was an amateurish production at best. The dialogue was forced and it appeared at times the characters were reading their lines from a script. The background music also at times was too loud drowning out the dialogue between the characters. The plot was silly and not believable. This movie had it all: profanity, sex, drugs, and gross, graphic violence, but the suspense was lacking. To be honest I was waiting for the characters to be knocked off by this ""maniac"". Even the ending was weird when we find out who the killer is. I do not recommend this movie.",1487980800,,590,4.5754716981132075

8620236,1,B00G2O4PQS,"This is certainly one of the worst movies i have ever seen. It's so bad it isn't even worth watching even if you happen to enjoy low budget movies, as i do.
Every single aspect of this film is crap. It watches like a rough cut. The sound is terrible, it is often hard to make out the awful dialog.
The camera work is atrocious. Every single shot is bad.
The writing and direction are the worst part. The ending is so nonsensical you would have to disregard the laws of physics in order for it to make any sense whatsoever.
Ignore this one unless you want to go down the rabbit hole to see just how bad cinema can get",1414972800,,616,4.099173553719008
8620237,1,B00G2O4PQS,"Does this review contain spoilers? Yes. Should you care? No.
So there's this scene where this drug dealin' brother of one of the four campers who form the ""heart"" of this ""movie"" is walking through the desert for as yet unexplained reasons, and he hitches a ride with this longhair sheriff we met about half an hour back. They ride about, oh, an eighth of a mile and then the sheriff begins to have an exceptionally unconvincing Vietnam flashback, and then they smoke a joint and then the drug dealin' dude is like, ""Later, bra, I better hoof it from here!"" And then in the next scene or so he shows up and his friend Brandon, played by an actor who has trouble depicting apathy well, says, ""How'd you show up here so fast?""
And the drug dealin' brother is like, ""I hitched a ride with this longhair sheriff who freaked out about Vietnam.""
And at this point at least that makes me smile for a microsecond, which sets off signals that allow certain crucial arterioles to widen and allow oxygen back into my brain, saving my life after what seems like about seven hours of the main four actors ""going it alone"" with their performance skills, aided faithfully by the worst sound pickup I have ever heard south of Begotten. For a while I thought I had been watching two scrunched up paper wrappers from McDonald's drinking straws slowly expand in a pool of dirty water until I realized this was only a metaphor for the performance I was seeing by two quite attractive young women in bikinis. Soon afterwards one of the women engages in a sex scene with Can't-Play-Apathy-Boy that was, in fact, the only poorly acted sex scene this reviewer has ever witnessed.
What follows is about five minutes of what vaguely resembles the sort of raunchy F grade slasher movie that is the least we are owed for having paid money for what real Amazon reviewers are calling an exciting debut from a horror director with great potential. The killer, or should I say ""killing machine"" to quote the Amazon blurb, is dispatched in about fifteen seconds by a young woman with the physique of a pleasingly curvy string bean. She then pulls off his mask and discovers he is...Apathy Boy. Oooh. A ""twist."" *yawn* yay. are we done?
Nope. There follows a good four-minute chunk of exposition. Isn't THAT a payoff. Something about Brandon being mentally ill. And then a promisingly gruesome flashback scene marred by the fact that the actor playing 10-year-old Brandon has approximately three times the body mass index of the actor playing full grown ""killing machine"" Brandon.
And then in the last scene for some reason our pretty blond string bean is being held captive by Brandon's own personal evil general practitioner, a man who has clearly been hybridized out of genes from Ira Glass and Woody Allen and then cured for 87 years in whatever it is the use to toast tobacco. End of movie.
Care to watch?",1411948800,12,2876,4.652259332023576
