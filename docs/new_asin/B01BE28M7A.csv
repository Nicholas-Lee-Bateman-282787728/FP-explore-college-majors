8749937,5,B01BE28M7A,"One wonders who makes these decisions, but here, more than a year after first airing, Showtime has failed to issue an American edition of Masters of Sex Season 3 (2015) on Blu-ray or DVD.  The season has long been available in various boxed sets overseas.  In order to obtain Blu-rays of this excellent series you will have to go to Paris, France for this All Regions edition which features English language dialog and subtitles.  You will pay a bit of a premium to obtain the program this way, and the text on the box is French, but otherwise this is a perfectly suitable edition for American viewers.",1477785600,10,602,4.607476635514018
