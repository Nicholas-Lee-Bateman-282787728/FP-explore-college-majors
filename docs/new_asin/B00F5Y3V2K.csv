It was only recently after some research that I found out this show was originally from France.  You can find only a handful of English dubbed episodes on YouTube.  It's a shame there was not a well archived North American version to be rereleased.  In English the show was titled ""Spatakus and the Sun Beneath the Sea"".  I am hoping this is at least English subtitled.  I won't know that until I get my new region free Blu-Ray player to know for sure.  This set is from Region 2(which I knew before I bought it) so it won't work in Canadian and USA Region 1 DVD players.  I don't know what Nitwit thought of these region zones considering how the market is now so global.  I will update when I get my player.

Update:  I'm sad to say now that I can watch it, there are NO subtitles of any sort so unless you are fluent in French or already know the gist of the show you are out of luck.",1438041600,8,1013,4.086294416243655
