8238138,1,B0010PI6LY,"I received this as a gift, and was very disappointed that so little content was included.  When the gifter realized how little of Lidia's great cooking show was included, she (the gifter) INSISTED on returning it.  I think that the producers of Lidia's show are missing a HUGE opportunity by not putting a season's worth of programs in a DVD collection.",1386633600,3,353,4.770491803278689

8238140,1,B0010PI6LY,"As much as I enjoy the Lidia's Italy TV show on PBS, and think that she does a superb job of presenting Italian cuisine and food culture, these discs are an insult to her audience and the intelligence of the public in general. It's not that the programs are bad, they are in fact some of the better episodes from her fine and always educational series. It's that you are paying for a four disc set, repeat A FOUR DISC SET, and then come to find that there's nothing on the discs but one 30 minute episode per disc, and the video quality isn't even all that great. Four discs should have had one entire season of the show, or at least four to six 30 minute episodes per disc. Shame on you Amazon, and shame on you Tavola Productions. Avoid this vastly over priced disc set.",1275955200,30,772,4.258503401360544
8238141,3,B0010PI6LY,Same comments on these DVDs. Edit out the commercials. Buyers of DVDs should not have to pay for commercials.,1235174400,26,109,4.7894736842105265
