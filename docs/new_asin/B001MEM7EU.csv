3697958,3,B001MEM7EU,"American Scary is a tribute to the golden age of the horror hosts. It contains some footage and interviews featuring Mike Price (Baron Daemon) and Alan Miliar (Dr, E, Nick Witty.) Although I was very excited to view the footage from so long ago, I found it somewhat disappointing.

Because it was less of a historical treatment of the genre and more of a collection of random three-second interviews interspersed throughout the DVD. No mention of Boris Karloff's contribution or the early spook shows and radio broadacasts. Also, many pioneers in the horror host filed like Sammy Terry, Nightmare, Al Lewis (Grandpa Munter), Zumbo were callously omitted.

It seemed to be geared for an audience with a very limited focus, limited interest in history and even greater limited attention span. I am still hoping for a more through treatment of the idiom in the future. There is additional footage of Baron Daemon and Monster Movie Matinee available at:

3697959,3,B001MEM7EU,"The long, long wait for this release made unreal expectations for the quality. The nuts and bolts of the video and editing are just fine but the content is just not there. The focus is on modern hosts recalling past hosts instead of interviewing the pioneers directly. Oh there are some nice spots here and there but for $20 I expect quite a bit more.

Good first effort but not great. Hopefully American Scary can serve as inspiration for more projects of this type.",1236038400,7,467,4.559523809523809
3697960,3,B001MEM7EU,"American Scary is the first documentary to spotlight the Horror Host phenomenon in America. The DVD is very professional and the filmmakers have done an admirable job of researching some of the original hosts from the early days of television, but what is really lacking is more footage of the horror hosts themselves. I grew up watching Pittsburgh's Chilly Billy Cardille back in the 1970's and while this host gets his due, he is only one of a limited number of hosts really given any airtime. We spend a lot of time watching a lot of ""interviews"" with ""fans"" of these icons from days-gone-by when what we really crave is more archival footage of these wonderful shows. By the end of this DVD I found myself feeling a little cheated and wanting for more horror hosts.",1235520000,15,769,4.661764705882353
3697961,5,B001MEM7EU,"This is the story of television horror shows and their hosts.  During the sixties and seventies, these shows and their often wacky hosts became something of a cultural phenomenon, though in recent years, they seem to have faded away.  For a look at a bit of weird Americana, you should see this documentary.",1376265600,,307,4.773584905660377
3697962,3,B001MEM7EU,If you gew up watching these hosts showing old movies on TV then this is enjoyable to watch once. I think it could have been expanded more considering how much can fit on a DVD. Major hosts like Zacherly and Elvira should have gotten more time and interviews.,1360713600,,259,4.416666666666667
3697963,5,B001MEM7EU,If you are a fan (if you buy this you must be)you will love this DVD. I throughly enjoyed it. The only thing it lacked was Dr. Shock (Philly horror host from the 70's).,1291680000,,168,3.9705882352941178

3697965,3,B001MEM7EU,"Yes Being a Horror host Myself I was very excited to see this , It was done very well and professionaly but it left out so much, there was no mention of Bowman body or sammy Terry ect  you would have to buy Virgina creepers to fill some of the gap this movie had, and then somebody needs to recognize people like sammy terry and Dr scar two of the best hosts ever, i give it 3 stars for at least getting this out there, People need to remember the good ol days. If your a horror host fan this is good but a little dissapointing as well but worth having.",1270512000,5,553,3.981981981981982
3697966,2,B001MEM7EU,"Great movie well played out. How it cannot have the SON OF SVENGOOLIE is a reason not to buy the movie.
Sven has been on for nearly 30 years and is loved in Chicago.",1258070400,5,165,3.8823529411764706
3697967,4,B001MEM7EU,"Excellent overview of not just a grassroots American phenomena, but a wonderful moment in time when television was local, before everything got sliced up and homogenized by the greedheads.  Not everyone can be covered, and they do a nice job talking around the lack of Elvira, but this is a lot of fun.  I especially liked the opening clip (it could have been Vampira, for chronology, or Zacherle, for popularity, or Svengoolie, for cult appeal, but I thought it was a nice choice that summed the whole thing up and gave it a humble face) and the title sequence, which is just grand!  Good work.  Now everyone go buy VIRGINIA CREEPERS on DVD!",1257379200,,642,4.654867256637168
3697968,5,B001MEM7EU,"If you grew up in a time when TV wasn't a huge conglomerate and reality crap spilled over the airwaves, you'll love this very good look at local tv horror hosts throughout the years. Everyone is profiled from Vampira to Commander USA. The interviews are excellent and the clips are priceless. I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who remembers this from their childhood.",1241481600,2,372,4.828125
3697969,5,B001MEM7EU,"I really enjoyed this DVD, particularly the vintage clips of horror hosts like Vampira and Zacherle.  I also liked the way they link the old hosts with the current ones, including the effect of MST3K's success.  It isn't perfect, though; the producers were unable to get actual MST3K material and I would've liked even more classic clips.  Still, what I got was very enjoyable and, with any luck, we may just get a ""special edition"" re-release someday.

Highly recommended!

8321265,5,B001MEM7EU,"Nearly everyone of a certain age grew up with a Saturday afternoon or late night horror host. This film is a valentine to all of those wonderful afternoons spent watching ""The Killer Shrews"" or ""The Giant Gila Monster"" and kindred films. For me it was Doctor Shock out of Philadelphia, who merits a mention. Focusing on a  few horror hosts, the film still manages to cover a wide swath of history and geography. Not just nostalgia, the film explains why hosts have diminished to near invisibility today and salutes the new generation of entertainers who are trying to bring them back. Highly recommended.",1440547200,2,604,4.864077669902913

8321269,4,B001MEM7EU,"Cool to see all the horror hosts talk about their art. Should've been more than 3 seconds of Joel Hodgson (of Mystery Science Theater 3000) as to me - thats one of the most important evolutions of the Horror Host genre - taking it to a whole new level of interactivity and hilarity, No longer just a host, with small skits but hosts that watch the movie with you and make it 100x better and hilarious! Grew up watching MST3K (parents watched it on comedy channel - they were huge comedy fans and one of the first people in Salem, MA to have a cable box - show started on CC in 1989 - the year I was born, so Ive literally been watching it for all 25 years of my life haha.

I thought it Mystery Science Theater 3000 was rather understated in the documentary given it revolutionized and brought the whole art to an entirely new level never seen before. Kind of trumped/one upped the whole Horror Host thing IMHO. In retrospect - Elvira is kinda cheesy compared to the intellectual, smart/knowledgeable comedy of the MST3K and the successors - Rifftrax with Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy (Servo/Professor Bobo) Bill Corbett (Crow T Robot/Brain Guy) are still going strong recently topped the number of MST3k episodes over 178 Rifftrax out!) and Cinematic Titanic - hopefully someday they'll come back! currently on indefinite hiatus - which was Joel Hodgson (Joel Robinson), Mary Jo Pehl (Magic Voice/Pearl Forrester), Josh (OG Servo, Dr Erdheart), Frank Coniff (TVs Frank), and Trace Beulieau (OG Crow T Robot/Clayton Forrester) .",1414368000,,1525,4.754716981132075

8321272,5,B001MEM7EU,"I have not enjoyed myself so much in years.  I grew up watching late-night horror shows but sadly my local area in the 1950s and 1960s did not have a Horror Show Host the likes of these.  I envy those who did and only wish this documentary was five hours long instead of only two.  I loved it!!! Yes, yes, yes.",1383350400,3,310,4.049180327868853
