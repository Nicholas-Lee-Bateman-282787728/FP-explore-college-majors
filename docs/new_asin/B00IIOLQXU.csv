6265446,5,B00IIOLQXU,"These videos are awesome.  They keep you moving through out the entire 30 minutes and you don't even think you are working out that hard but you really do sweat a lot by the end of these workouts.  Jessica Smith is awesome.  I love the Dance Walk - it is very similar to Leslie Sansone's 30 day workout with the ""step step run run run"" which I love love love!!",1399852800,9,360,4.114285714285714
6265447,5,B00IIOLQXU,"Easy walking talk. good music.  one on one.  pretty setting and some different moves.enjoy the fact that it can either be an hour or half that,",1399334400,2,143,4.461538461538462
6265448,5,B00IIOLQXU,"This is a great set of walking workouts.  Each DVD has 2 different 30 minute workouts, so you get a total of 6 workouts to choose from--a complete library of walking workouts!  Jessica Smith is an excellent instructor--she's low key, but enthusiastic and encouraging.  The workouts are mostly low impact, but when she adds in higher impact moves, there is always one of her exercisers who models low impact.  These are my favorite type of workouts--low impact, but high intensity.

This set has such a nice variety.  The Strength and Balance DVD has a strength workout that includes intervals of walking and working with weights, and a more relaxing balance walk that you do barefoot.  The Tone Your Trouble Zones DVD includes one workout that focuses on your glutes and thighs, and a second that focuses on your abs.  The Dance Walk DVD has one dance walk with a variety of dance styles and a second latin-themed walk.  This one is fun and does not have complicated choreography.  Every workout gives you a solid 30 minutes and really gets your heart going.

I recommend these workouts as a nice alternative to Leslie Sansone's workouts.  Each one has more varied moves and gives you a solid workout in 30 minutes.  Jessica is energetic and engaging and the outdoor setting (facing the water) is a nice change of pace.",1399075200,15,1319,4.757709251101321
6265449,5,B00IIOLQXU,"Jessica is over all an amazing instructor.. These DVDs are really amazing..  Each DVD comes with 2 workouts so you get a very nice variety.. I have been working out with Jessica for awhile.. Prior to these I was doing Leslie Sansone but started to get bored with the repetition and the continued ""walk, walk , walk"". Jessica offers a refreshing spin on the traditional walking workout.. I feel like i really workout out when I am done because i actually Sweat!! The nice thing about these particularly workouts is that they are only 30 min long and they get the job done..Kudos to you Jessica smith. :)",1398211200,32,602,4.574074074074074
6265450,5,B00IIOLQXU,"This is a fun and awesome workout! It looked so easy while previewing the video, but I worked up a big sweat! I like the video series as well.

I do a lot of high impact workouts with friends as part of my weekly schedule, and these workouts are like a breath of fresh air on the althernate days!

6265452,5,B00IIOLQXU,"This programme is easy to follow, promotes &encourages you to want to participate every day. I admire the fact that JS doesn't have Experts working out with her. It's everyday people who modify movements & occasionally fumble over the most testing of moves! Most importantly, JS connects with each one of us through the camera. Finally, one significant difference to other instructors- Jessica completes the whole programme herself. I see so many where the instructor will do a few reps them stop to walk around the other people doing the exercises- you rarely see them complete a whole set, let alone a complete programme! Jessica Smith is highly recommended & a pleasure to move with!",1397952000,9,686,4.973913043478261

'Strength & Balance' includes HIIT, Cardio, Dance, Kickboxing & Pilates...'Tone Your Trouble Zones' includes lots of lower body toning...'Dance Walk' includes 2 extra fun, easy to follow, dance workouts & that will work your total body.

They are fun, easy to follow, 2 different levels of low impact and high impact. The dance walks are my favorites because it is actually easy enough for anyone who wants to dance and can't get all those fancy moves. You really get your moneys worth and Jessica is an excellent instructor and has great cuing. She is very personable and even has her mom exercising with her in the videos. I can't say enough how much I enjoy exercise because of her.",1397174400,14,576,4.443396226415095
6265455,5,B00IIOLQXU,"Wonderful workout program. I did Jessica's tube videos last summer but got busy and stopped for some silly reason. Finally purchased Walk On 3 DVD set as a motivator to start exercising again to lose 30 pounds. Today is day 3. A bit sore, but I will keep going. Really appreciate seeing Debbie on the videos doing the low impact versions. As I get stronger, I will step it up. Seeing real people in the videos makes it more welcoming and doable. Thank you for these sensible workouts and your positive and encouraging attitude. Some of us will never really like to exercise, but I don't dread my evening workouts now.  Will be buying more DVDs in the future.",1501632000,5,658,4.529411764705882

6265461,5,B00IIOLQXU,"This set of workouts has variety which keeps it from getting boring. I don't find them to be difficult to do, but I still got sweaty doing them. You get out of a workout what you put into it. She shows different modifications so you can make it easier or harder depending on your fitness level or how you are feeling that day.

It is filmed outdoors in a beautiful location by the water, it has variety (including workout with weights) and the music is quite good.  Debbie shows the low impact modifications.

I can enjoy my walks indoors without feeling like it's a chore because Jessica makes it really easy and fun. The back ground  of the video  recording  brings summer to my workouts. I have very bad knees but still able to get a great workout  from her modified  version.  I truly  becoming  addicted to a daily  morning walk with Jessica and her Mom. Thank you very much.",1423353600,3,474,4.333333333333333
6265472,5,B00IIOLQXU,"I have been using Jessicas YouTube workouts at my second workout of the day.  Sure, Id get up and work out intensely first thing in the morning, but then Id spend my day sitting hunched over a computer.  Jessicas YouTube workouts were just the thing to get me up and moving in the afternoon.

I wanted to support Jessica for providing so many free workouts and so I bought her Walk On 21 Day Set.  Well, I loved that series so much; I just had to have the rest of her DVDs.  This set does not disappoint.

In fact, I love Jessicas workouts so much that I have been doing them exclusively for the past month.

Why I love this set:

* It works!  I have lost inches in my legs and waist.  What???? That didn't happen for me when I was working out very intensely with heavy weights and extreme cardio.

* Since the exercise isn't super intense, Im not famished and looking to eat everything in sight when Im finished the workouts.

* I have more energy that carries me through the day.

* Its a mood enhancer.  No matter how tired or how cranky I am, I am smiling and happy after doing a Jessica workout.

* Jessica.  What can I say?  She is just so sweet and real and encouraging.  Its as though you are just hanging out with her and happen to be working out.

* The setting.  Jessica, her Mom Debbie, and a third exerciser are working out by the Miami waterside.  Its so nice to see water, palm trees and boats as a backdrop.

Now, here is my take on each DVD in the set.

DANCE WALK
This DVD has two 30 minute dance walks:  Latin Dance and Dance Walk.  This was actually my least favorite of the series.  It seemed really easy to me.  Since I have done this DVD a few times, the workouts have grown on me.  I use these workouts on recovery days or on those days when I don't have a lot of energy.

TONE YOUR TROUBLE ZONES
This DVD has two 30 minute routines:  Buns and Thighs Walk and Flat Abs Walk.  I especially like the Flat Abs Walk because I hate working my abs, but I know its really good for me.  With this routine, you are having so much fun that you don't even realize you  are working your abs.

STRENGTH & BALANCE
Stride and Strength is the first 30 minute workout of this DVD.  I have a new found love of Jessicas metabolic training, e.g. doing aerobics with light weights.  Unfortunately, this workout had a big annoyance factor.  One of the background exercisers, Lisa, was totally off-beat and was always working the opposite side that Jessica and Debbie were working.  Jessica stresses that it doesnt matter what side you're working or if you are exactly on the beat, but this was very distracting.

Fusion Walk.  Jessica really shines with this type of walk.  You are working out barefoot and doing some lovely, graceful flowing movements.

If you love walking, you will love these workouts.  Jessica has so many different twists on walking, you won't get bored.  This set also gives you room to grow.  You can start with Debbie, who is doing a less intense version of the move.  You can eventually progress to the advanced moves, which may involve a bit more impact and bigger movements.",1422835200,12,3104,4.338568935427574
6265473,5,B00IIOLQXU,Good work out.,1421884800,,14,4.0
6265474,5,B00IIOLQXU,"Jessica has a rare on-screen personality.  She appears kind, understanding,genuine and lively.  She is someone most would like to call their best friend. Unlike many fitness trainers, she is able to communicate and empathize well with her audience. She is definitely habit forming,  Though perhaps not appropriate for the seasoned athlete, she has a great appeal to the mass majority of people who want to keep fit with doable, yet challenging at home exercise.  As a registered dietitian, I regularly recommend her workouts to clients. Her you tube videos cover every sort of exercise from yoga to ballet to weight lifting.  But these DVD's are great for getting you off the couch and increasing your heart rate.",1421712000,14,713,5.05982905982906
6265475,4,B00IIOLQXU,These worked out well for me.  I love the different workouts.,1420848000,,61,4.545454545454546
6265476,5,B00IIOLQXU,"This is a great set of DVD's. I used to do Jillian Michaels workouts (quick results - but increased risk of injury and NOT fun) and force myself to run for miles and it was so boring. I hated working out, and eventually I just stopped doing it because it was always so dreadful. I was in a horrible car accident and was only able to do yoga for about a year. After losing my strength and endurance I've turned to Jessica Smith's online videos and this DVD set to help me enjoy exercising again. If you want a fun way to exercise - then I would recommend this. Additionally, I love her positive attitude and energy, it's catchy and contagious. For overall wellness for your mind, body, and soul - Jessica Smith is perfect if that's what you are looking for.",1420848000,3,756,4.330985915492958
6265477,5,B00IIOLQXU,"I really enjoy Jessica's workouts and much prefer these to any of the other DVDs I have at home - she keeps it real, has a calm voice, is easy to understand and cues the moves well.  You get a really good workout, even if you opt for the lowest impact moves.  Between the 3 DVD set and the 4 DVD set, and the additional information Jessica posts online, you get an amazing variety to chose from - keeps your workouts interesting which, in turn, keeps you body moving !  Early days for me yet .... but so far so good !",1420675200,,517,4.049019607843137
6265478,5,B00IIOLQXU,All workouts very good.  I combine one of these with a stretching workout  (Classical Stretch) each day.  It seems to keep me strong and flexible.  Easy to follow and fun moves.  Suitable for all levels.,1420588800,2,203,4.685714285714286
6265479,3,B00IIOLQXU,"I love Jessica Smith, but these workouts are a little boring and definitely do not work for all levels. These are really beginner-level workouts or, for more advanced exercisers, for recovery days. The outdoor set is nice; I also like that she works out with her mom, who modifies the moves. But her YouTube walking workouts are more fun and challenging, and, even though I am not a big fan of Leslie Sansone, her workouts are more challenging than these. So if you are looking for a way to ease into a fitness program, these are right for you. I think there are better choices out there for anyone with an intermediate fitness base or above.",1420329600,8,642,4.543103448275862

6265484,5,B00IIOLQXU,"So far I am loving these workouts!  They are only 30 minutes each and you finish feeling refreshed instead of worn out. Everything is gentle on the knees and I find Jessica's style to be really pleasant.  I have used Leslie Sansone's Walk Away the Pounds, which are also good workouts, and I have to say I like these WAY better due to the fact that they have lots of unique movements to keep things interesting and Jessica isn't as ra-ra cheerleaderish (still motivating though).  The other great thing is that there are 6 separate workouts included so you won't get bored so easily.  I have made a commitment to work out to these once a day for the next 30 days along with eating healthy.  I will report back with my results.",1419811200,3,726,4.428571428571429
6265485,5,B00IIOLQXU,"I decided to try Jessica Smiths DVDs after using exercising with Leslie Sansone for several years.  I am in my early 60s and fit.  However, I require low-impact lower body moves due to knee issues.  Jessica is cheerful and positive without being irritating.  Seeing her beautiful smile and brightly colored tops while I exercise is uplifting.  Her instructions are clear and the timing is accurate with rare exceptions.  I enjoy both of these routines and I only have to modify a couple of moves due to my knee issues.  This DVD is great if you only have 30 min to exercise, as a warm up and cool down are included in each segment. Once I mastered these routines, I added the Walking for Weight Loss, Wellness & Energy DVD to my collection.  I find those two walks more challenging than the Dance Walk and Latin Dance Walk routines, but equally enjoyable.",1419033600,3,855,4.6158940397351
6265486,5,B00IIOLQXU,"I can not say enough good things about Jessica Smith as an instructor. I have all 7 of her DVDs, plus I've done nearly all of the hundreds of FREE videos on her YouTube Channel. You won't be disappointed and you have nothing to lose (except weight and stress and who doesn't want that?) by trying her free workouts.
What I love is that she is really invested in people and she wants people to succeed with their fitness goals. She offers free monthly schedules (if you want to use them), plus she uploads new videos every week AND she does a Q & A every week. There really is something for everyone....walking workouts like these, plus pilates, yoga, barre, strength, cardio, HIIT and all with modifications for different fitness levels.
Jessica Smith is the REAL DEAL

I really love walking workouts, but I quickly got bored with Leslie Sansone's. Jessica's are different...she adds so many interesting moves, especially ones that do double duty for toning abs without having to get down on the floor. If you want to work your abs (have you ever heard of anyone who doesn't?) in a painless but effective way, you will love these workouts.",1418774400,6,1139,4.666666666666667

I do wish there were a few additional DVDs in this set (or more workouts on each DVD); I thought the price was a little high for the relatively low number of workouts you get.

6265502,5,B00IIOLQXU,"Update to original review....I was contacted within a few hours of posting this review from Jessica Smith's company offering a replacement due to the problem with the Dance Walk dvd.  What great customer service!  I've only done a couple of the segments on this dvd set, and already know that I love them!  I have two other of Jessica's workout DVDs, and chose her walk DVDs over others because her DVDs are my favorites.  She is very pleasant and does not get tiresome like many other instructors out there.  Highly recommend!!

The is a quality control problem on the Dance Walk dvd included in the set.  It will not play.  The other 2 dvds work fine.  I initiated a return through Amazon and immediately ordered another dvd set.  It arrived promptly, but guess what?  The Dance Walk dvd won't play in that set either.  Apparently there is a QC problem on Dance Walk dvd only.  I will have to send this one back, too. I'm afraid to reorder again, and will just wait awhile I guess.  Too bad, as I loved this workout.

6265509,5,B00IIOLQXU,"I've tried Richard Simmons Sweatin to the Oldies and they are good but they are just too much for me...too fast and too many moves where I feel like I'm failing no matter how hard I try.  But with Jessica Smith's work out I am able to do it since it's less hectic and less moves so I end up feeling like I've done something which makes me want to do it again! It's great for someone who is older, out of shape or has physical limitations like arthritis or a back condition because her Mom is doing it as well at the reduced pace etc.  I also just like her attitude.  Again it just depends on what your personal likes and goals are but this is great if you are just starting out and need/want to feel accomplishment quickly!  I have only tried the Dance Walk set but am looking forward to trying the other 2 sets as soon as I've built up to it.",1411689600,3,843,4.0602409638554215
6265510,5,B00IIOLQXU,"I am a female in my mid-fifties, and an thoroughly enjoying these DVD's. ( I have used many of Jessica's free workouts on the internet before, but it is nice to have the ease of simply popping a DVD in and not have to go searching on the net.)  I have found these workouts to be varied enough to prevent boredom, as well as I do enjoy Jessica's personality and voice.  I also appreciate that she has her mom working out with her - great encouragement, plus it's fun to see if I can ""out do"" mom and keep up with Jessica!  Another thing that let's me know these workouts ""work"", is that I wear a heart monitor when exercising, and several of the workouts get my heart rate up to the top level.  All in all, a purchase that I am VERY glad I made!",1411603200,6,744,4.075342465753424

6265512,5,B00IIOLQXU,Love all of the workouts in this set.  She really knows how to give a good workout.  I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to get healthy and fit.,1410566400,,156,4.166666666666667
6265513,5,B00IIOLQXU,"I am a long time walker and also love to exercise at home.  I have tried several dvd's by a variety of instructors  over the course of many years.  This set has quickly become my all time favorite!!  Jessica has created six routines that are safe and fun and that move at just the right pace.  The music is just right and the setting is beautiful and inspiring.  I also love that her mother is one of the exercisers, and I appreciate that she demonstrates effective modifications of the movements.  These workouts leave you feeling great!!  I love them and highly recommend them.  Thank you Jessica!!",1409961600,4,600,4.584905660377358
6265514,5,B00IIOLQXU,"Glad I purchased this...have tons of Leslie Sansone's workouts (which I like), but Jessica Smith's workouts are a great alternative.  Jessica's workouts are more challenging with varied moves than Leslie's. I've definitely improved my fitness level with Jessica's DVD's.  This is a great DVD set...particularly love the Dance Walk.  Over the years I've worked out almost exclusively with  ""walking"" dvd's, but I've incorporated more ""dance"" moves added to the walking,,,it truly is more fun. Love Jessica's friendly demeanor and enthusiasm.  Also enjoyed the fact she included her Mom in these workouts, and as one would expect, Mom does the moves at a lower intensity. I think most adults would find the workouts useful ... but no workout is perfect for everyone...but certainly the trick to enjoy most workouts is to improvise somewhat  to suit your fitness level.",1409961600,7,866,5.2846715328467155
6265515,5,B00IIOLQXU,I really enjoy this workout.  It's helping me to build muscle and shed pounds.  I'm 48 and not in very good shape.  I've lost 25 pounds since May.,1409788800,6,146,4.142857142857143
6265516,5,B00IIOLQXU,The videos are fantastic and well rounded and she has a rotating schedule on her website so that you are sure to use all the workouts and have a well rounded schedule!!  Definitely recommend this series!!  :D,1409702400,,208,4.594594594594595
6265517,5,B00IIOLQXU,"OMG, this was a killer for me.  I've been walking with Walk at Home for years and usually do at least 3 miles a day.  i did the ab workout from Tone Your Trouble Zones first and thought I would die.  I try to do one of these workouts each week just to shake up my routine with Leslie Sansone.  Jessica is great on the cues and I like it that her mom does the low impact moves.  I hope Jessica will continue to produce walking videos; I'll get them all!!",1409097600,4,453,3.934065934065934

But I have been a home fitness exerciser for many years and I love getting in and getting it done. Jessica Smith gets it...she understands you don't need to cry uncle to get in a great workout, her Total Body Balance DVD is in a class by itself but her walking workouts aren't far behind..basic, simple, effective moves that get the job done. Regardless of gender, you owe it to yourself to try Jessica's DVDs..I really don't even like calling these workouts, because they just don't feel like work...so much fun!!",1405296000,19,602,4.742857142857143

6265523,5,B00IIOLQXU,"I love walking workouts and, in my opinion, Jessica Smith has the best. This DVD set has something for everyone. Even though the focus is on walking, she never misses an opportunity to throw in standing abs work and other upper body toning moves. The great variety of workouts and the options offered for folks of all fitness levels are also big pluses. I've always hated working out in the past but now I can't wait to exercise each day!",1401148800,17,438,4.4875

She is a great motivator, very pleasant; and all of her DVD'S are challenging, effective and she is just overall a great instructor. I love the outdoor setting, her cueing is always on point.  I look forward to working out with her daily.  I am looking forward to more of her DVD'S in the near future.  I also enjoy working out with her Mother, Debbie.  I love the Mother and Daughter team.",1400025600,5,480,4.230769230769231

8642402,5,B00IIOLQXU,"I was looking for a different kind of workout being 45yrs old I was tired of doing extreme heart pounding workouts that leave you exhausted and fatigue afterwards especially if you haven't worked out in several months. I read the reviews and decided to give this a try. I have to tell you I was very impressed I got an extremely awesome workout. The moves to me were easy because I have done my share of workout dvds I didn't even preview the exercise sessions I just jumped right in and followed along pretty well. Jessica is very sweet just happy you're moving and encouraging you not to stress if you make a mistake. Even though the moves are easy don't think you won't get a thorough workout where you sweat, get your heart rate up but doesn't leave you drained or exhausted. Another thing I like you don't need a lot of space to do the exercises because you're not sprinting around the room. All sessions are 30 minutes, which is more than enough for me and the whole dvd targets every part of the body. I highly recommend this product for the price you can't beat it. I bought this because I needed to get back into a exercise routine that would get my heart rate up, loosen my stiff joints, help with my blood pressure and cholesterol along with a healthy meal plan this was EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED. I will definitely purchase more Walk On dvds.",1527984000,4,1350,4.404

Perfect for someone who wants to keep in shape, but is not an exercise guru... at my age (mid 50s) I just need to keep moving and keep my metabolism hyped.

8642404,1,B00IIOLQXU,"I threw this one away after doing it once.  Not sure what happened as I really like most of Jessica Smith's other DVD's.  It was boring, lacked inspiration or creativity and made my body hurt during and afterward.  I find ""Walk Strong Building Balance + Inner Strength"" and ""Total Body Balance"" (minus core stretch section and with modifications for people with bad backs and lax ligaments) and ""Walk On 21 Day..."" (also with a few modifications) to be safe and satisfying workouts so this was very disappointing.  Hard to believe the same person created them.",1526688000,,560,4.863157894736842
8642405,5,B00IIOLQXU,"I love Jessica Smith's videos.  I love that they are workouts that I can do and modify as needed.  Most importantly though, I love that she is so likeable, like she is actually there working out with me.  The workouts make me feel fabulous and NEVER make me feel inadequate in any way.  I have a few different sets of hers and would recommend her any time to anyone no matter what physical shape you are in, and would continue to purchase others.",1526601600,,446,4.337349397590361

Jessica's workout dvd's (I own like 8 of them now) are perfect for me. Perfect to use with my Fitbit as well. You don't need to pound yourself into the ground to get an excellent workout. Her workouts are easy to follow, yet surprisingly challenging. Who knew that walking could be this much fun!?
