556125,3,6303073778,"OK, let's get this over with; none of us would even consider watching this movie if it weren't for the fact that it was directed by a young Alfred Hitchcock.  Indeed, it's doubtful that the movie would have even survived into the 21st Century if it weren't for the director who was to go on to much greater heights.  Yet Hitchcock WAS the director and we KNOW he was a masterful director so he must have done a GREAT job, right?  Well, not really.  I found myself interested somewhat in ""The Farmer's Wife"" because there is a fair amount of humor in it.  I don't know if I laughed out loud but I smiled a few times.  I considered asking my wife to waych it and see if she thought I'd end up the same way.  However, the one real problem with this movie is that it is TOO long.  Frankly, I breathed a sigh of relief when I thought the movie was over.  ""Maybe it wasn't all that long afterall"" I told myself.  Yet when the film actually did end about 10 minutes after I thought it would, I had to admit, a lot of it belong on the film editor's floor.  For the record, this is a silent movie (Hitchcock directed England's first ""talkie"" shortly after he made ""The Farmer's Wife"").  Silent movies need good expressive acting to succeed and I felt that this movie had that.  It was proably it's stregth (along with the humor).  It's the story of a widower who decides he'll take another wife and how he is angered when his choice of spouse isn't receptive to the idea.  He goes through several disappointments all seemingly in the same day before he discovers the obvious choice.

I got this movie as part of an ""Early Hitchcock"" set.  In that sense, I have no qualms that I bought the DVD.  I would have been disappointed to have bought this by itself.  I liked it well enough but I doubt (due to its' length) that I'll ever watch it again.",1156809600,5,1835,4.281976744186046
556126,2,6303073778,"Even though the film originally ran about 97 minutes, and even though Amazon's info shows the running time to be 93 minutes, this Laserlight's DVD version of THE FARMER'S WIFE runs 129 minutes.  Apparently, the wrong film speed was used in transferring the film to DVD, stretching the film by an additional half hour.  The film's tempo is therefore slowed down a great deal, and the pacing and timing of the various comedy scenes are very much ruined.  The DVD does have decent picture and sound (mono) quality.
This dated and predictable film was nevertheless well-acted by Jameson Thomas as the farmer and Lillian Hall-Davis as his housekeeper.  Hall-Davis also starred in another Hitchcock's silent comedy ""The Ring"" (a much better film), also available as a Laserlight DVD.",980035200,29,777,5.046875

Y esto es precisamente lo que demuestra este box set. El arte de la cinematografa puesta en las manos del genial Hitchcock. Ni que hablar de la produccin: Siete discos, cada uno en su propio estuche, excelente sonido, y todo el material subtitulado (includo extras, introduccin y trailers), adems de que los discos son multizona. Cabe destacar que esto no fue obra de una gran empresa sino de LaserLight Video, pero es algo que los grandes estudios deberan tomar como ejemplo, hartos ya de ver pelculas con extras sin subttulos. Si a eso le sumamos el costo del set, nos encontramos con una joya que no podemos desperdiciar. Muy recomendable.",969840000,4,851,4.68
556128,2,6303073778,"I have nothing against silent films. In fact Clara Bow's 'It', Lon Chaney's 'The Phantom of The Opera' and Louise Brooks's 'Pandora's Box' are amongst my all-time favourites. But with the exception of 'The Lodger',  Hitchcock never really got going in silent films. 'The Farmer's Wife'  certainly had the potential for an easy going, enjoyable comedy, but NOT  when it lasts over 2 hours. I challenge anyone to watch this film in one  sitting without their eyelids feeling increasingly heavy. On the plus  points, Laserlight has dispensed with one of those embarrassing Tony Curtis  introductions, and has provided us with a newly recorded (and very good)  score. The picture quality is also very good. If you're tempted to buy this  DVD because it's a Hitchcock film, I'd say don't. It is only worth a look  to anyone with an interest in silent films or a genuine Hitchcock  enthusiast.",961891200,13,887,4.9324324324324325

556130,4,6303073778,"For the hard-core Hitchcock fan, I recommend getting this set of eight of his early films plus an episode of the TV show. The best of these (39 Steps, Lady Vanishes, Blackmail) all bear the Hitchcock stamp of his finest  work inthe 50s and 60s. I especially enjoyed Easy Virtue (1927), an  unremarkable film on its own - I had never seen it before, yet could start  seeing signs of his masterpieces to come. Although none in this collection  is as excellent as North by Northwest or Psycho (although 39 steps isn't  far off), where else can you get this much Hitchcock for $30? Buy it!",961286400,13,585,4.481132075471698
556220,4,6303073778,"Quite good for a silent.  Not many breaks for ""dialogue"" but none is really needed.  Hitchcock does a great job of silent story telling.  AND, of course, the very subtle Hitchcock humor is there in his early exploits.",1389139200,,217,4.657894736842105

If you're looking for what most people would think of as ""Classic Hitchcock"" with lots of suspense, intrigue and dead bodies, then you'll be bitterly disappointed.

556224,4,6303073778,In this day of DVD and Blu-ray I don't general consider purchasing anything on VHS. Some years ago I rented a copy of Hitchcock's THE FARMER'S WIFE on VHS and it was this version released by Republic Picture. There is NO sound track at all but the picture quality and the projected speed are excellent. So rather then do a hit and miss on finding a decent copy of this delightful romantic Hitchcock silent I jumped at a chance of getting a copy that knew had a decent transfer.

This movie came out in 1928, just before ""talkies"" started to become to norm.  This movie is well acted, funny at times, and has a good musical score.  This movie is one of my favorites from Hitchcock's silent film years.  Try it.  You might like it or you might not.",1352505600,,537,4.3
556227,1,6303073778,"Format: Movie
Director: Alfred Hitchcock
Distributor: unknown
Release Date: March 2, 1928

For me Alfred Hitchcock has always been a hit or miss director and in this case he is definitely a miss. The film is about a farmer named Samuel Sweetland whose wife dies so he starts looking for another wife to take her place. Throughout the film he ends up asking five different women to marry him which really makes the viewer feel like Samuel is simply looking for a wife just to have a wife rather than him actually having any genuine feelings for the women. The story is really boring and extremely predictable. For the movie being around one and a half hours it really feels like it drags on with a lot of unnecessary parts.

The acting is another flawed part of the film. Jameson Thomas plays Samuel but he really doesn't create enough emotions for the character. He just seems like a guy who keeps trying to go after one lady after another so you really don't feel that he has enough feelings for these people for you to care. He also insults every woman that turns him down which really doesn't help you sympathize with Samuel. Lillian Hall-Davis plays Araminta Dench (a housekeeper) and she does the best acting job in the movie but not as good of a job as she did in The Ring (1927, Hitchcock). All other actors in the film with the exception of Gordon Harker as Churdles Ash (a handyman) do a horrible job which doesn't help this movie at all.

There really aren't any special effects shots in the film. As for the music, it is really bad and is hard to listen to. None of the music seems in the right place and even when it is the music is truly horrible and hurts my ears beyond belief.

Even though Alfred Hitchcock has provided so many movies that I have enjoyed over the years this is one of his biggest duds. The story is predictable and boring, the film feels far to long, the acting is really bad, and the music makes me want to mute the television. So this film really isn't worth your time no matter what your interests are. For a worthwhile Hitchcock silent film check out The Ring (1927, Hitchcock).

556228,3,6303073778,I know there have been several versions of this story.  I went back a little too far and got a silent movie.  My mistake.  I would rather have chosen the version made in about 1940.,1173657600,,181,4.114285714285714
556229,4,6303073778,"Believe or not, this is a slapstick comedy, in spite of the fact we are talking about an early Hitchcock.

I wouldn't say it is his best but, for a movie made in 1928 (I think) it is wonderful. More humorous than many of his others.  If you like silent movies you will love this one and if you have never watched a silent film I would recommend giving this one a try.  Chaplin or Keaton are probably the best to start with.

The only reason to watch this movie is to laugh at the dated sexism and interesting acting from the time period. But the story and pacing is so bad, I could easily rate this 0 stars.

This is how movies were way back in the stone age apparently. If you are a student of film, then this may be for you. For all of you used to more modern style movies with color, with real dialogue, with action, something that gets the blood moving, try something else.
