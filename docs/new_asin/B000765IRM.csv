8044862,4,B000765IRM,"What happened to the second lesbian love scene in the shed in this movie?  Who excised it, axed it, censored it?  Why?  The Cinemax (?) version, still showing in about the year 2000, had that love scene in it and was one reason for the purchase, but now my feeling is somebody ripped me off, not that that's a rare occurrence these days.  Let me please explain my disappointment, if possible without going off the rails, about censor- ship; the FCC and Ajit Pai; intelligence versus ignorance; religion versus free thinking, et cetera, ad infinitum, ad nauseum!!!!
  My gender is male and my age is octogenarian, just so you know.  That second love scene is one of love, tenderness and kindness, and not couched in eroticism as shown nowadays.  My experience with beautiful lesbian women taught me how women should be treated, id est, treated with utmost respect, not the pawing, groping, feeling ways even, or ESPECIALLY by, politicians.  Be a predator and hide out in D. C.?  That scene is the most tasteful scene of any movie portraying lesbians to my knowledge.
  Much...a LOT, really...of my relationships have been with lesbians and/or bi-sexual women and have actually been the only truly successful ones. They have treated me better than anyone else in my short eighty (80) years.  But my kindness and senses of giving and helping extends to everyone, not only the feminine gender.
  Well, that's my opinion, and yours are welcome, too, especially if you disagree; it's easier to learn from criticism than agreement.  Even children should be taught to disagree about anything and have evidence to support their disagreement.  To me, it's a good feeling to learn because of countervailing evidence.  Like one guy said:  ""I wanna' be different...like everyone else"".  The first step toward wisdom is to admit one's ignorance; we are ALL ignorant...about something.
  Sooooooo..........where's the beef, er, the second scene; where'd it go?  By whose phoney authority?  Censorship by some sanctimonious one?",1520467200,2,2012,5.064024390243903

Okay.  Whatever cheese you're expecting from a 1994 flick with this title, lol... yep.  Still.  It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  Maybe a little fun campy bad if you're in the mood for that.  It's kinda like a Lifetime Movie Network story... with a few naked scenes, hot bad girls who really don't look bad at all, and guys like Matt LaBlanc saying lines like ""Stay cool Daddy-o,"" lol.  The one lesbian sex scene was actually done well compared to the rest of the movie and the girls were certainly pretty.  Though they all looked between 15-17 years old.  Like, genuinely.

Set in the 1950s, Donna Patterson is a pretty girl who lives with her little sister and a perverted uncle who is always trying to molest her like every 5 minutes.  When she goes out on the town with bad boy Vince (played by a young and hunky Matt LaBlanc) in a stolen car, she takes the blame for the trouble they get into and ends up in a reformatory for girls.  The ""warden"" is mostly interested in prepping her girls to be star athletes so she can compete with and beat out the school that did her wrong as a former principal or didn't hire her or I don't know what... so there are a lot of athletic/running scenes as the girls prep for that.

In the meantime, Donna bonds with a tough Hispanic girl named Carmen Pea who seems genuinely lesbian... and they kinda fall for each other. They have some genuine chemistry and it brought an unexpected relationship layer to the story that I didn't think it'd have.  It's a bit unrequited, ultimately (it's the 90s), but they get that one surprisingly honest bit of intimacy with each other.  But make no mistake... this is all camp, lol.  Some nudity.

Interesting note... the actress who plays Donna (Aimee Graham) is Heather Graham's younger sister.

Not worth buying... look for it on Netflix or watch key scenes on YT.",1402185600,,1865,4.4674556213017755
8044865,4,B000765IRM,"It's about what I expected, a lot of drama, but the bottom line is during the last few seconds of the scene you get the lesbian sex... which was well done.  Took 90 minutes to get there finally.  A better value would be to rent a XXX tape and just get to the point!",1370995200,,265,3.888888888888889
8044866,2,B000765IRM,"If you like the politically correct style WIP films of the '90s, then you will like this one too.  It was too PC for me.  Only saving grace was that it has some sapphic t&a.  The film is very weak, otherwise.  It fails as a drama.  It's schmaltzy.  Has little to no action, or violence.  And scores almost a zero for subversiveness.",1353715200,3,332,4.258064516129032
