8384057,5,B002Y4Z4RO,"I ordered this DVD set because I love Jack Lemmon in  ""The Long Way Home"". For me it is the A+ rating on this set but I enjoy watching the other stars in the other 3 movies included. This was a great buy and I am very happy to have found it here. Thank you Amazon!",1394150400,,264,3.7142857142857144
8384058,2,B002Y4Z4RO,"My husband and I love to watch comedies, which is why we ordered this ""Comedy Collector's Set"".  The movies included are like Hallmark movies and not bad, but they are certainly not comedic. Also, we chose this collection thinking these were 4 Jack Lemmon comedies. Actually, Jack Lemmon only appears in one of the movies. And it is not one of his comedic roles. We are disappointed in the set.",1368662400,3,394,4.628571428571429
