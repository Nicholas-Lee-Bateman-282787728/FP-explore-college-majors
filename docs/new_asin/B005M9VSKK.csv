4834309,5,B005M9VSKK,"I had the privilege of seeing this movie debut at the Imagine film festival in AMsterdam with Tim Muskatell in the audience.  I have seen some work by this producer before and was very impressed how he can take a low budget and make a great horror flick.  As a fan of the horror genre, I recommend this flick",1320451200,2,308,4.203389830508475
4834310,5,B005M9VSKK,"CHOP is the directorial debut of Trent Haaga.  If you like low-budget films, I probably don't need to explain who he is; look up Trent on the IMDB and you'll see 40 listings for him as an actor in everything from Troma flicks to HBO's LIVING AND DYING, to Chris Seaver's MULVA: ZOMBIE ASS KICKER!  On top of his plethora of acting gigs, Trent is a producer, a writer (if you haven't seen it, you need to see DEADGIRL - one of the most twisted ""zombie"" flicks ever made), and has his hands in just about everything that goes on a film set.

CHOP is a really dark and twisted tale of revenge.  Lance Reed, a seemingly innocent everyman, is picked up by a seemingly random Stranger on the highway when his car breaks down, and conversation in the vehicle quickly escalates to kidnapping and the forced murder.  The Stranger wants Lance to remember him, and the horrible deed that Lance committed, and now the Stranger has Lance committing his own horrible deed and has the blackmail setup he needs to truly begin his revenge.

I'm not going to go any further into the plot of CHOP, because it needs to be experienced.  I do not want to ruin any of the surprises the film holds, and to say any more about it would definitely ruin one or another... there's just too many twists and turns to be able to avoid giving one away!  Screenwriter Adam Minarovich has crafted one of the most twisted revenge stories I've ever seen; and though he's not listed as a writer, the script seems to have a bit of Trent Haaga feel to it - I would be very surprised if Trent didn't have a least a little influence on the written word here.

What really stood out for me was the direction.  For a ""writer, not a director"" Haaga sure knows how to balance the visual requirements of the screen with the actor's needs.  The composition, camera work, movement, etc., all were great - CHOP balances safely between being too static and too dynamic; there is neither the ""put the camera on a tripod and let the actors carry it"" feel of Kevin Smith, nor is there the ""let's do a million camera movies"" of Darren Aronofsky.  On the other side of the director's chair, Trent was able to glean some of the best performances I've seen from the cast I'm familiar with.  Will Keenan shines as Lance, he is spot-on as the normal, everyman, and the darker man hiding beneath that exterior; Jeff Sisson's turn as Jeff is equally striking; Timothy Muskatell is amazing as The Stranger.  Muskatell presents a character that is calmly psychotic, collectedly off his rocker; the performance becomes even more impressive when his reasoning for revenge is finally shown, and the extent of his madness is truly revealed.

Overall: awesome.  Just awesome.  And when I say ""awesome"" I don't mean ""awesome"" in it's every day, nonchalant sort of way most people associate with that word, I mean: I am literally in awe of how good this flick is.  CHOP balances comedy and horror flawlessly, the plot has more twists and turns than a high-speed chase on a San Francisco street, the technical aspects are all amazing, and overall CHOP is as close to a ""perfect"" indy film as I have ever seen.  If CHOP is not destined to be referred to as a ""cult classic"" then I have no idea what that term means.

4834311,5,B005M9VSKK,A great under the radar horror revenge gore and a little comedy type flick! A must see for anyone that loves horror.,1403913600,,116,4.318181818181818
4834312,5,B005M9VSKK,I've never seen anything as bizarre as this!  I loved it!  A must for horror/gore fans.  Great acting...fantastic tongue-in-cheek humor.  It was thoroughly entertaining...but not for the squeamish!,1393286400,6,197,5.928571428571429
4834313,1,B005M9VSKK,1/2 star if possible. nothing more to be written except had to write more than fifteen words. it sucked. don't bother,1357948800,,117,4.619047619047619
4834314,5,B005M9VSKK,"The title makes one believe this is simply a gross slasher film. In the first few minutes you are sucked in with the dark humor and quirky characters making this more of a cerebral mind fest...with a little bit of axe murdering.

My first question is, ""Was that a 4 door racing Volvo with a rear tail fin?"" Did they ever make such a vehicle?

Will Keenan stars as Lance, our pathetic ""victim"" who is hounded and forced to do things. Tanisha Mukherjee plays his wife. Camille Keaton (gang raped in the original ""I Spit on Your Grave"") plays Mrs. Keenan. ""B"" actor Timothy Muskatell does an excellent job as the bizarre tormenter of Lance.

This is an excellent dark comedy horror film with decent soundtrack, great script, good quirky characters, and a touch of dismemberment.

4834315,5,B005M9VSKK,"Chop is an independent movie, done really well. I really enjoyed it. It's horror with a bit of dark comedy and silliness thrown in. The idea is great and the movie keeps you on your toes. What's going to happen next, or should i say what's going to get chopped next. I was cringing and laughing throughout. Highly recommended!",1334620800,,326,4.5423728813559325
4834316,4,B005M9VSKK,"Chop is an independent horror-comedy that is like Saw with a dark sense of humor. It's not perfect, but it is an interesting film. I really wanted to know exactly what was the motive behind all the horrible things that were happening. Directed by Trent Haaga and starring Will Keenan, both of which have starred in some Troma movies.",1332806400,,333,4.661016949152542
4834317,4,B005M9VSKK,"Not a bad low-budget movie. While a bit derirvative of hostel and saw movies, it still has enough quirks and turns and energy to make it worth seeing.",1329004800,2,150,4.392857142857143
4834318,5,B005M9VSKK,"CHOP is unlike any horror film I've ever seen.  From its opening moments to its jaw-dropping end, director Trent Haaga (a TROMA films icon) assaults us with gore, blood and truly bizarre set pieces that lead to a chilling denouement.
Will Keenan plays Lance, a seemingly innocent young man whose orange and white Volvo with a spoiler (!) breaks down.  He gets a ride from a seemingly friendly pickup truck driver (Timothy Muskatell) and that's when all the rules are broken and a nasty tale of revenge begins.
Haaga infuses the film with steady doses of dark humor including two morose detectives.  We realize early on that Lance must have done something horrible to the stranger and we want to know what it was.
Keenan and Muskatell are excellent in their roles making us wonder who the heck is nastier.  And when we finally discover what Lance did to earn the stranger's wrath, it's stunning in its simplicity.
Kudos to CHOP for its bold departure from the typical torture flick.",1328227200,,981,4.752941176470588
4834319,5,B005M9VSKK,"I bought this movie because it sounded interesting, but when I watched it I was suprised at it being so fantastic.  It dosen't shy away from the grusome parts in the story, but has enough humor to keep you from getting numb.  A few good twists in the plot and a few especially disturbing characters....definately worth a watch.",1327622400,3,327,4.620689655172414

8479226,3,B005M9VSKK,"Chop is a hilarious horror comedy, in need of a better special effects budget. A character looses some fingers, but it's very clear that they just closed them into a fist and wrapped them. I mean, you can see the outline of their fingers. Unfortunately, this really hurts the ability to suspend disbelief. Other than that, it's very funny with some great twists and turns.

Despite my one criticism, I did enjoy the movie and would suggest it to anyone with a dark sense of humor and a strong love for horror.",1480204800,,509,4.532608695652174
8479227,2,B005M9VSKK,"I had heard good things about this movie so I was excited to finally watch it. Now after I have Im not excited to say I'm sorry I did.

Both lead characters are unlikeable and annoyingly obnoxious. You care nothing for either and if any emotions root for both their demise. Over cute and under delivers. Some points for the writers ideas but after first viewing it probably will be my last.

The donut chick is one of the worst actresses in the history of Hollywood but she can chop my leg off anytime.

Watch Tusk instead a better movie about regret, ressurection and karma and chopping body parts off for a legitimate reason. I am the walrus koo koo ca chew.",1431648000,,660,4.39344262295082
