The topic of detoxification is a very timely one for me (and I imagine, for many people) and Marie & Sheila present their material in a thought provoking manner.  I am glad to know I can refer back to this information anytime simply by re-watching the DVD.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1275868800,,387,4.347222222222222
8401395,5,B003O3YOJ8,I feel very fortunate that Marie Manucheri made these dvd's available so those of us who can not attend the workshop may still learn from our home. I loved the dvd! It is very imformative & fun. It also moves quickly so there is no dead air time.  A wonderful workshop that every healer & individual looking to grow and make improvements in health will benefit from. I would buy it again!,1275782400,,388,4.388888888888889
