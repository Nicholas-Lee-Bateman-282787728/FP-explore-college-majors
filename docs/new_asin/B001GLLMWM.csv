3702613,5,B001GLLMWM,I like this movie.  It's one of those Harlequin's from back in the day.  The story line is interesting and keeps me involved until the end.,1436832000,,139,4.3076923076923075

3702617,1,B001GLLMWM,"I like the movie and had seen it before.  I had taped the movie but had somehow lost the last twenty minutes or so of it.  However, the quality of the one you sent me was bad and it got stuck in several places.  When it was finished, and after looking at it closely I found there were a lot of scratches on the back of it.  So therefore, the quality of the dvd was very poor...

I would really love to have a better one...Thank You...Hilda Lowry",1375660800,,445,4.011363636363637
3702618,4,B001GLLMWM,This was a good movie but not one I would watch over and over. But I did enjoy it somewhat.,1360713600,,91,3.6
3702619,4,B001GLLMWM,"Another Woman is my favorite Harlequin movie. I like the story line of a married couple struggling with real life issues and how they are worked out. I have read several books along the lines of an accident and then resulting amnesia and I enjoyed them as much as I enjoyed this.
  Justine Bateman was a good choice and she clicked well with Peter Outerbridge.
  Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",1306368000,2,398,4.337837837837838
3702620,5,B001GLLMWM,"From the First time seeing this movie, i liked it, yes some may say it's a chick flick, but in all actually, it's a very powerful and moving movie, I myself had my husband to watch it withh me and he's not a chick flick fan, I asked him to tell me wheather he liked it or not, he said it did keep your attention wondering what's going to happen next. but there was at the end an emotional part that he said he thought to be a little more for the crying types.
and thats my review.
I gave the movie an A, because of the action, the suspence, and also the romance it had in it, and by romance i mean to say how this family was bought back together by the love for each other.",1267488000,2,673,3.8840579710144927
3702621,5,B001GLLMWM,"I used to read a lot of romance novels, but now that I am back in school, I no longer have the time. As a  woman I often dream of true romance because I seldom see it in real life. Sometimes it's necessary to dream to forget all the sordid things that are happening every day in different parts of the world. This movie helps me do just that. The first time i saw the movie, Another woman, it was on the Hallmark channel. I liked the fact that it was a clean movie; the type that you could watch with your children, and anytime it came on afterward, I watched it again. I was never too tired to watch it. I finally decided to buy my own copy. I was a little disappointed by the DVD because a nude scene had been added to it. You could tell that it didn't come from the original movie because the actors were totally different. The nude scene was completely unnecessary. It really didn't fit in but I still like the movie.",1252713600,15,921,4.116666666666666
3702622,5,B001GLLMWM,"a very good movie. i really enjoyed it. good acting and the story held my attention. a very good copy, good picture and good sound.",1239840000,3,131,4.28
3702623,4,B001GLLMWM,Good movie! Worth watching. I thought Justine Bateman did an excellent job in this movie. She held the plot together. The nudity wasn't really needed. Would have been even better if she had been partnered with someone else. The scary guy was kind of lame. I liked the young girl and maid.,1505779200,2,288,4.5576923076923075

3702627,5,B001GLLMWM,"I really enjoyed this movie, I felt the love between the two main characters. Although predictable, it was definitely my favorite Harlequin movie so far! I have been binge watching Harlequin movies  for my 3 day Labor day weekend!",1504310400,,230,4.897435897435898
3702628,5,B001GLLMWM,"I enjoyed the movie.  The filmography was beautiful with old cars, pool scene, airplanes, huge cabin in the woods and a mansion!!!!  It had lots of flashback scenes.  And, you could tell it was made-for-TV movie and there were breaks for commercials. The plot was interesting....hate that  her bed side rail was not up in the hospital room of an unconscious patient and he walked with a cane on same side as the injury...should had a consult with a nurse for those details.",1504051200,,473,4.662650602409639
3702629,2,B001GLLMWM,"Too predictable. The book this is based on my be better. Her husband Peter, I believe almost stopped loving his wife. Could be longer more drawn out. I've seen better; (Regarding Henry), same type of movie only better. Rent it at least once. The movie needs to go into more detail about the characters lives and motivation - their actions towards one another. The sex scene not necessary, it detracts from the movie almost.",1480636800,,423,4.72972972972973

8322346,4,B001GLLMWM,"Very nicely done.  Justine Bateman does an excellent job and the supporting cast is very good.  There were some times when I found myself asking  ""Why don't they just ask the right question?"" but I understand why they had to develop the plot as they did.  Still, enjoyable and entertaining.  A fun and uplifting movie with a sympathetic depiction of marriage and a message about the importance of loving through all difficulties.",1513382400,,429,4.902777777777778

It kept me guessing on what happened and who the bad guy or guys were.",1507766400,,208,4.225
