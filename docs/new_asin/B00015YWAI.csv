1974225,5,B00015YWAI,"This video is amazing.  I would have to say this is the best skateboard footage I have ever seen.  Its long, which is great, and it never gets tired.  I have owned this since it was first realeased and almost watch it daily.
There are cool sections in which special effects have been utilized to create something new in skateboard video.  But the main footage is excellent.",1081123200,8,373,4.522388059701493
1974226,4,B00015YWAI,"What a great way to mesh skating and cinematography.  Many of us have been waiting for a video like this to came out for a long time.  I first saw the preview for this video on the ""from our friends"" section of Spike Jonez's director series dvd.  From the opening shot...I was amazed, and the green screen effect on the skateboards! Wow!  Watch and enjoy!",1074816000,11,355,4.415384615384616
1974227,2,B00015YWAI,"YEAH RIGHT (Rhino) is a feature length film from the Girl Skateboard company directed by Spike Jonez (among others) over a three year period. Lots of fish-eye lens shots showcase 22 contempo street boarders doing their thing in urban settings accompanied by an explicit hip-hop track.  There's also a clean version.  The coolest segment is street boarding with the boards digitally removed. And I liked the ball-busting, rib-cracking, brain-dinging wipe-outs, although they were few and far between",1074211200,2,498,5.454545454545454
1974228,1,B00015YWAI,"A friend of mine was given this video and we watched it. If you want to watch what seems like an eternity of kickflips, manuals, hand rails, and nollies over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over.......... again, then this is the video for you.

I swear, those are the only tricks shown in the video, over and over and over and over.... you get my point i hope.  this video sucks.  kickflips and hand rails are not skateboarding so this was pure torture for me to watch.  if you want a real skate video get ""ban this"" from powell.  yeah, i'm old school.  again, this video sucks.  it's like a couple kids learned kickflips, manuals, nollies, and hand rails, and then spent the summer taping themselves doing them, over and over and over and over. the only good part of the video is where one dude does like a little layback slide and that's it.

even if you are new school and love kickflips, manuals, nollies and handrails, there has to be a better video for you. AVOID THIS ONE AT ALL COSTS.  i would have given it infinity negative stars, but that's not an option.",1196467200,,1119,4.29047619047619
1974229,5,B00015YWAI,This is one of my favortie skate vids.  The video boasts great skating and really explores some interesting editing with Spike Jonze behind the lens.  Everybody has nice parts showing off the different styles of skating on Girl.  There are interesting montages and even hefty Chocolate parts.  Overall a great video.,1146960000,,316,5.137254901960785
1974230,5,B00015YWAI,"This video has nothing but great skating and with the help of spike jones has brought this film a type of artsy look in some of the edited footage.  My Vhs of Yeah right broke which is why I had to re purchase it, but for dvd.  To all the people who hate this video, it's because your stupid and don't know great skating when you see it.  I don't know how some people find it boring, when many of the Chocolate skaters appear in this vid.  This brings a unique style and diversity to the video.  I recomend this video to anyone who loves skating! R.I.P Keenon...",1143590400,2,562,4.166666666666667
1974231,5,B00015YWAI,"This video is absolutely awesome.  The best sk8 video I've ever seen, and i've been watchin' sk8 vids since as far back as bones brigade and the search for animal chin.  What's so amazing about this vid is that you don't even have to be in to sk8-boarding to enjoy it....it's for everyone.",1138665600,,289,4.433962264150943
1974232,5,B00015YWAI,"This skate video has it all, it's pretty long, but still, they manage to grasp my attention with genius little things like the greenscreen skateboards...

if you haven't seen this one, get it, it's a must!",1130025600,,205,4.694444444444445
1974233,1,B00015YWAI,"I purchased these ""Explicit Lyrics"" and ""Clean"" after seeing a trailer for one of them, but actually the two films are IDENTICAL or AMAZON mixed them up. I quote:

Yeah Right! [EXPLICIT LYRICS] (purchased on 09/08/2005)

Yeah Right! [CLEAN] (purchased on 09/08/2005)

Which, means the compay (Yeah Right) is just socking money.

Besides that, although I am not a freak skater only a lover from the 90s during my teenage years and the intro is done really well, the rest of the film is boring.

I think the quote in the middle from the one dude that skated for a couple of 411 movies (which I assume now have to be better) sums up the Yeah Right production - boring repetitive shots of each skater ""proving"" that they can to the required amount of tricks to join the Yeah Right club. sad really.

Any film where one gets either a story (of any sort) or closer to the actual skaters will be fantastic. Believe me, I bought this stupid video twice for over 50 dollars....whatta waste.

1974234,5,B00015YWAI,I love love love the special effects in this video.  You can tell that they really had fun with it.  This definetly added a something more than what the average skate vid would.  The skating is incredible as well.  Definetly a must buy.  And might I add again that the skating is fantastic!,1128297600,,290,4.39622641509434
1974235,5,B00015YWAI,"This video will surely impress.  If you need some new tricks to try or you're just getting started, this video will provide the means and the motivation to get you going. The tricks are amazing, the music sets a good tone, and the editing keeps the movie going without making it look repetitive.",1124323200,,295,4.566037735849057

8007019,3,B00015YWAI,"Same parts in HD quality, but the soundtrack has been completely butchered with what I think only Anderson, York, McCrank, and Koston keeping their original songs in their respective parts. I was kind of pissed but it's a classic and if you skate you should have this video to show your kids what was going down at the turn of the millenium.",1456531200,,341,4.516129032258065
8007020,1,B00015YWAI,It skips right during Eric kostons part that sucks it's the best part of the movie! If it didn't do that I would be ok.,1390435200,,119,3.8
8007021,1,B00015YWAI,"It did not work at all! So horrible. And now I can't return it, because I've had it for too long. Wish to give it back",1388707200,,118,3.576923076923077
8007022,5,B00015YWAI,It took me three buys to find the dvd with the soundtrack that I like and this one is it..I first watched with the accompanied soundtrack that comes with this edition and is very nostalgic for me (although in all actuality the original soundtrack may be better).,1387324800,,262,4.595744680851064
8007023,4,B00015YWAI,"This is a fun video to watch especially if you are into technical skating i.e. ledges, manuals, and flip in flip out tricks.  Lot's of skilled skaters on the Girl and Chocolate team including but not limited to Marc Johnson, Keenan Milton, Paul Rodriguez, Eric Koston, Brian Anderson, Mike Carroll, Rick Howard, Jeron Wilson, Brandon Biebel, Jereme Rogers, Mike York and more.  This is an edited version of the original film, which I was not aware of upon purchase. I was a little annoyed only because I enjoy the original tracks (about half the tracks are the same) versus the ""enhanced soundtrack"" of which not all of the skater's tricks are synchronized with the music.  4/5 stars, video was shipped a few days ahead of estimated time.  Overall very decent purchase for the price and condition of the video.",1327622400,,810,4.805755395683454
8007024,3,B00015YWAI,"I thought it was time to upgrade from my VHS copy, but was really disappointed with this version distributed by 'Rhino Transport'.

The skating is all there, but the soundtrack is way different. Only Brian Anderson, McCrank, and Koston have their parts with the original songs.

I suppose if you never seen Yeah Right before it would be ok. But watching Gino, Mike Carroll, and the Girl Montage to a different song - this version just ain't right.",1310601600,5,447,4.717948717948718
8007025,5,B00015YWAI,"Great combination of music, skating, and movie-like filming. A great DVD to watch at home or as background music/movie at a get-together or a party. Marc Johnson is my favorite on the DVD so far!",1292198400,,195,4.6
8007026,5,B00015YWAI,"I have seen a different version of this. The only thing i remember is Jereme Rogers skating to Michael Jackson's Don't stop til you Get Enough.  Being a music fan and a MJ fan, i liked that particular version better.
I think every skater in this vid has extremely smooth lines and a huge bag of tricks.
That being said it takes a great amount of skill to perform these with style. check out RiCk M.'s part. also Carroll and Koston have great control and style with their boards.

And to those of you who complain about the length this is a 2in1 movie. it contains both Girl and Chocolate videos",1255910400,,594,4.342342342342342
8007027,5,B00015YWAI,Are you going to see the best skating ever in this video?  No.  Will you see a video that will have you highly entertained even if you are not a skater?  Yes!  There are definitely other videos with better overall skating but none are as unique and as imaginative as this.  Look at this as a regular movie or TV show and not as an exhibition of the worlds greatest skaters.  I have seen every guy in this video in other videos do some serious skating so don't think they are just trying to hide behind special effects. Watch and enjoy!,1248048000,,535,4.247524752475248
