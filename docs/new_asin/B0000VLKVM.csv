1954447,5,B0000VLKVM,"This is a great movie, by a VERY talented first time director, which grabs you from the brilliant opening credit sequence and never lets go.  This film works on so many different levels, I don't understand how it was so overlooked by the arthouse crowd.  The performances, the miniDV cinematography, the score...the script...it's all right on the money.  Buy it or rent it...JUST WATCH IT.  You won't be sorry.",1080432000,2,410,4.898550724637682
1954448,5,B0000VLKVM,"I've been waiting on Manic since it was in production, so I've had a long wait. I must say it was worth it.
I really have no complaints about the film; the acting was great, especially from Joseph Gordon-Levitt- who really proves what a good actor he is, Don Cheadle, and Zooey Deschanel. The story seems very accurate, haunting, and at times heartbreaking, as it paints a very realistic picture of teens with problems. There's no fluff here.
Direction was great. Jordan Melamed's debut proved to be a good one- and I look forward to more by this unknown director.",1078185600,2,564,4.65
1954449,3,B0000VLKVM,"After bashing in the head of a classmate with a baseball bat Lyle (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is involuntarily committed to a psychiatric ward for troubled teens. Throughout his life Lyle has been expressing anger as a result of being beat up by his father when he was younger. But now that he is committed he doesn't let go of his ways easily as he feels that his anger is rightly justified. It takes some time for Lyle to let down his guard and befriend the other troubled teens. He eventually forms a close friendship with his roommate who is charged with molesting young children and a lonely big-eyed girl who suffers from terrible screaming nightmares every night. There are lots of scenes showing the mundane activities of life of patients inside the psychiatric ward. When they aren't playing basketball, reading existential philosophy, or slam dancing to Rage Against the Machine they are often found in group therapy. Each patient has their own story to tell including histories filled with suicide attempts, drug abuse, cutting, extreme violence, and other self-destructive acts. The method of filmmaking is experimental and can put some viewers off. Often the frames are shaky and unstable and appear to be filmed with a handheld device. This appeared to give the effect of being a personal observer inside the ward. This aspect didn't bother me at all but what did bother me was a general feeling of uneasiness when the film was over. I felt as if the pieces of the plot puzzle failed to come together properly. I was strangely unsettled about the lack of explanation of the motivations of Lyle. It seemed as if in one scene he is lashing out his anger, the next he is a saint while trying to calm down others, and then he returns once again to betting up others - and all this happened without any proper explanation. As a result his actions often came off as being unrealistic and one-dimensional. In addition, I had trouble with the overall plot and the intentions of the filmmakers. If there was an intended message of this film it dearly failed. I felt that it didn't do anything but continually spinning its wheels. I've been anxiously waiting for MANIC to be released on DVD but now that I've seen it I hate to admit that I feel let down. I was expecting so much more.",1075852800,4,2283,4.695760598503741
1954450,5,B0000VLKVM,"In a day when armed guards lurk in our schools and teens get tried and sentenced as adults, the film Manic opens a portal into teen rage, pain, and the existential demands of growing up. The acting, script, and phenomenal cinematography come together to grab the viewer's guts with razor talons-this is an easy movie to avoid, to turn away from, but those who dare to watch it, and to find their own anger and rage challenged, cannot watch it unscathed.
The movie opens with Lyle (3rd Rock's Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who plays a phenomenal role in this movie), in his late teens, having wounds sutured and his facial bruises attended to. He's anxious to go home with his mom, but two burly psych techs grab him, pump him with a tranquilizer and cart him off to a youth psychiatric unit.
Intense as this may seem, the opening credits disturb the viewer even more intensively. Lyle is in the clinical therapist's office, being interviewed. Between each question, the screen goes black and a set of credits is posted, while the sound of a fight turning into a beating runs in the background.

This sets the stage for a movie that uses digital cinematography, fast cuts, cine verite, and unexpected color to portray the chaotic life of the disturbed. Scene color schemes were actually drawn from several key van Gogh paintings, one of which plays a key role in the movie. Story lines and subplots develop. Lyle's murderous rage surfaces over and over again, challenged, each time, by his therapist. In one particularly charged scene, the therapist smashes a chair during group and asks, ""Does that feel better? NO! So now I have to smash something else!"" He hurls another chair, ""Feel better yet? NO! So now you have to do what we all have to do, you have to live with the feelings!""
Ironically, this movie is more about anger management than the movie, Anger Management. This has all the intensity of a gritty, no-holds-barred war movie. And that's no accident, it's about the war within, the battle between a teen and his pent up rage. Ultimately, it's an existential movie, examining the choice to live or to die, made in the solitude of one's soul. Whatever the situation, whatever our escape plans are ... ""wherever we go, there we are."" Manic suggests that the only place freedom can be found is locked in engagement with oneself.
Although does go a little ""Hollywood"" at the end, this is not one of those horrid dramas which suggest that once the hero confronts a key past trauma in a cathartic moment everything turns around. In fact, the therapist, played by Don Cheadle, explicitly denies this: ""You may have some epiphanal moment about your father and escape your rage. It's more likely you're going to have it all your life, and have to learn to live your life without destroying yourself or others.""

If the movie has a major shortcoming, it is that the psych staff is too helpful. My experience with locked wards finds it highly improbable that Lyle would have been allowed to continue in his room, with his group, after a violent outburst. Most psychiatrists and therapists don't have the courage of Don Cheadle's character, to allow potentially dangerous situations to continue in this litigious day and age. Lyle would have been lugged off to a higher security ward, possibly sedated, and denied the interactions he needed to begin his healing process. But I criticize the mental health system, not the movie, here.
Finally a movie that dares to tell the truth. It never falls into the cliche of trying to be a One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, and it beats Girl Interrupted and 28 Days in intensity and veracity. Carl Jung wrote ""enlightenment consists not in the seeing of luminous shapes and visions, but in making the darkness visible."" Manic has the courage to show us a piece of that darkness, yet in gazing at it, we find a certain luminosity. In the last analysis we're left with a movie about rage, about having the courage to feel the pain behind the rage, and daring to go on living, finding freedom not by banishing the demons within, but by learning to live with them.",1073606400,52,4090,4.718881118881119

1954523,4,B0000VLKVM,"Manic is a great movie.  It's very sad and unnerving in spots, but I would definitely recommend this movie to people who have a strong stomach.  The performances by all the actors are really good.  I might of changed the ending to be different for me, but the way it ends isn't bad.  I highly recommend this movie, but it would be a hard one to watch very often.",1426464000,,362,4.202898550724638
1954524,5,B0000VLKVM,"Sensational verite-style drama about life in a crisis center for troubled teens. Don Cheadle, Joseph Gordon Levitt, and Zooey Deschanel revel in their early brilliance.

1954525,2,B0000VLKVM,"I couldn't get into the movie, even though the setting is very real.  I've worked on a child psych ward and there is so much more dysfunction to delve into than petty schoolyard brawls.  I don't feel the film captures what it's like to have manic depression.

I like the main actor but he's very one-dimensional in this film... truth is I never finished the movie so maybe it picks up.",1423612800,,385,4.394366197183099

1954527,5,B0000VLKVM,"Very visceral movie about a group of problematic teenagers brought together. Some scenes reminded me of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.
Filmed on a low quality camera, this was Gordon Levitt/ Deschanel collaboration, and it could not be further apart from (500) Days of Summer.
There are parts that will make you want to look away or stop watching, and some others will make you feel like you were actually part of the group.

1954530,4,B0000VLKVM,"Very engaging and another great by actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt. I liked it for not trying to be overly depressing or optimistic, more bleak than anything else. Zooey Deschnell (sp?) is lack-luster as usual but the therapist played by Don Cheadle more than makes up for it.",1402704000,,271,4.913043478260869
1954551,4,B0000VLKVM,Mental health professional Don Cheadle has his work cut out for him in this film about deeply troubled teens in a lockdown psych ward. Joseph Gordon-Levitt does an excellent job portraying a teen who cannot control his rage.,1401408000,,224,4.921052631578948

1954553,5,B0000VLKVM,Joseph Gordon Levitt is very underrated as an actor. While it s true that his older work 500 Days of Summer and 10 Things  I Hate About You was aimed to a younger audience' his newer stuff is great for adults. Manic gave us a true look at the mental health  issues of younger people. He must do a lot of reseaarch on his parts. Not to mention how good looking and likeable he is.,1398124800,,379,4.04

1954555,5,B0000VLKVM,"Picked this because I had a bonus based on a brief description...Then, I was pleasantly surprised. While it is not a thriller or an extreme movie, it is realistic enough to keep you involved, and the story kept my interest throughout. I felt like I was watching ordinary life, but extraordinary things happened and kept me in suspense. I recommend it, especially if you are interested in stories of people experiencing institutionalization.",1396828800,,440,5.125

1954558,5,B0000VLKVM,"I decided to watch this solely for Gordon-Levitt as I find him to be a brilliant actor. Fortunately, I was treated to not only a wonderful performance from him but also a film beautiful in its subtlety, rawness and performances from other actors, especially Cheadle. It isn't a perfect film but it still gets 5 stars from me as 5 stars means, ""I love it,"" and that I do.",1393545600,,370,4.3768115942028984

1954597,5,B0000VLKVM,"I would not be able to get too into describing what makes this movie so great, in my eyes, without spoiling it. However, I will try to convince you to watch it.

I will start with this: This movie is NOT easy to watch. It has a raw look and feel to it, which was entirely intentional. It can feel very emotionally driven, and some will find that there is little to no resolution. That is where the title of my review comes in. When you watch this movie, pay CLOSE attention to the conversations and the characters relationships. There is a lot going on in this movie from underneath which is difficult to perceive without actually paying mind to it.

There is resolution in this movie, and it will feel too little for most people's tastes, at first. But you will find more when you pay closer attention. This movie is about emotionally troubled teens. These teens have a variety of complex problems and living situations. This is where this movie truly excels. This movie gives an honest and realistic perspective to the lives of the patients and their caretakers. Unfortunately, something so honest, like this, can be difficult to appreciate and be entertained by.

Still, I love this movie. If you've seen One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, you may think you've already gotten the gist of this movie, but I assure you that this one is very different.",1377561600,,1350,4.593360995850622
1954598,4,B0000VLKVM,"Plot: 'manic' Levitt gets sent to a mental health facility after almost killing a fellow student. The rest of the movie circles around other youths in the facility and the staff trying to help as best they can.

I watched this movie for Levitt who gives a pretty good performance, but the movie often lacked realistic substance. The facility in the movie seemed more like a come and go as you please daycare than an actual mental health facility. Suffering from a disorder myself, each character had relatable points throghout the movie, but something often felt missing. The only consistent and sound acting IMO was from Cheadle, mainly because when I was hospitilized many years ago I had a case worker much like him. You could just see in his eyes he wanted to say F-it and walk away but something always made him stay.

If you're a psych major, are interested in a somewhat fair example of mental illness and healthcare or just follow certain actors then watch this. I give it a B-/ C+.",1377561600,,990,4.619318181818182
1954599,4,B0000VLKVM,This film is shot with a very raw look but it helps you connect with the characters more. Some big stars in here that are still getting their career started. I wish more films would cover these types of issues in society since there are real and we cannot ignore them. This film shows us that they are real people even though they may have some serious issues.,1376524800,,360,4.3088235294117645
1954600,3,B0000VLKVM,"Lyle Jensen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has a few issues with anger management. Most of the time, he's in complete control, but one day, during a baseball game, he loses it and almost kills someone. Lyle's not quite eighteen yet, so he's sent to a psychiatric hospital, where he learns that compared to others, his problems are nothing. I've said it before and I'll say it again, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is the single most underrated and under appreciated actor in all of Hollywood. I've seen a lot of his films, some are great and some are awful, but the fact remains that he always gives a strong performance and makes even the worst movie that much better. Manic was a rare inside look at a youth psychiatric facility, but there wasn't much of a story behind it. Of course we meet Lyle and the other patients, finding out why they're there, but there really isn't a point to it. The quality of the film further decreases with the way it was filmed, as every scene features constant movement from numerous angles. Similar to these camcorder films, I honestly found it pretty distracting, not to mention nauseating. The best part of Manic though is clearly the performances. This was released in 2001, before any of the stars were household names, however after seeing the film, it's easy to see why they all became popular. Don Cheadle is another actor that doesn't get the recognition he deserves, playing the Doctor in Manic, he is the glue that brings everyone together. Even with JGL's performance, this film is a mess of nonsense without Don Cheadle. Manic is somewhat disturbing and filmed in a way that makes it hard to watch, but the performances are just about as good as it gets and make this film worth seeing.",1376092800,,1715,4.700996677740863

I've seen this scenario played out too many times already. If you haven't seen any mental patient movies in your lifetime, maybe you'll appreciate this flick. Who cares to listen to a group of kids with behavior problems do nothing but whine about how they've been dealt a bad hand in life? It's an 1 and 45 minute movie listening to ridiculous arguments, a lot of fighting, hostility personal issues, and a doctor trying to help the lost souls. This movie was filmed like a documentary, but was not. Had this been a documentary about the recovering process of kids with psychosis, this could have been a more interesting film. If you do sit through this movie, I guarantee you'll be looking for some of your anxiety meds. I give the movie two stars only because the acting was fantastic. I've read the other positive reviews and I agree with most of what was said. Maybe I didn't like this movie because I've seen this played out on the screen way too many times already and I'm bored with it. It's really not a scenario you can enjoy watching over and over because you know everything that's going to happen and outcome too. If this movie revealed something new, maybe I'd feel different.

But for me, the ending left me with too many unanswered questions and that will ruin a movie every time.

Teenagers fifty years ago dealt with the same issues and our councilor(Don Cheadle)and his assistants are believable.

1954662,2,B0000VLKVM,"Manic (Jordan Melamed, 2001)

As fond as I am of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, he couldn't save Jordan Melamed's first (and to date only) feature, Manic. I'm not sure anyone could have, save an editor with a much lighter touch than the one recruited to cut this film.

The story centers on Lyle (Gordon-Levitt), a teen who gets sent to a hospital's psycho ward after a violent episode during which he severely beat a fellow teen with a baseball bat. David Monroe (Don Cheadle), the doctor overseeing the ward, has a lot of patients with issues to work with, so once Lyle gets to the ward, the film shifts into ensemble mode. There's Chad (Michael Bacall, who also co-wrote the screenplay), an affable agoraphobic with whom Lyle quickly bonds; Kenny (Cody Lightning), Lyle's roommate, who's in for molestation; Sara (Sara Rivas), the goth with anger issues; Tracy (Zoeey Deschanel), the introvert working on her self-esteem; etc.

I'm pretty sure you can see the problem already-- clich abounds in this film. But that might be forgivable (certainly, where this sort of thing is concerned, it's miles better than, say, Girl, Interrupted) if the movie actually told a coherent story. This one tries to, but fails so miserably I can only place the blame on an editor who was told, ""this movie must be x number of minutes long. Make sure it gets there."" There's a difference between the artistic creation of impressionism in film and just hacking out large pieces of character development, setting, scene, and anything not relating to plot (especially when the plot is so necessarily thin). As I said before, though, I'm just assuming; if the script was actually written this way, then the blame must be placed squarely on Bacall and co-writer Blayne Weaver, who have a lot to learn about that wonderful goblin known as continuity.

There are the bones of an excellent film here, but it never boils enough to really congeal into a soup. **",1212105600,2,1926,4.844984802431611
1954663,4,B0000VLKVM,"Manic follows juvenile psychiatric patient Lyle (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) to Los Angeles's Northward Mental Institution, where he is admitted after beating another student with a baseball bat during a fight.  In a hauntingly realistic portrayal of mental turmoil, the movie follows the painstakingly slow (or non-existent) progress for Lyle, suicidal Tracy (Zooey Deschanel), self-injuring goth rocker Sara (Sara Rivas), bipolar rich kid Chad (Michael Bacall), and sexually abused Kenny (Cody Lightning).  Don Cheadle portrays staff therapist Dr. Dave, a man who struggles against his own feelings of futility and ineffectiveness.  The teens have angst, their families are near the breaking point, and those charged with fixing the out-of-control teens lack all the answers.

Director Jordan Melamed shot the film on hand-held digital video in an actual mental hospital, strongly adhering to the essential intentions of the Dogme 95 movement.  As such, film is not a barrier between the viewer and the action on screen.

Manic is never sensationalist; rather, it uncovers truths that lurk in the lives of nearly all families.  There are no trite life lessons, no jaw-dropping ""crazy person"" performances in hope of an Oscar nod, and the end isn't tied up with a big pretty bow.  The movie does end with a sense of hope, not for banishing all trauma and difficulty, but for the ability to control and manage it within our lives.",1202860800,16,1424,5.269911504424779

I consider this my favorite movie of all time because (for once) I can actually relate to the characters on a very deep level.  Its a very accurate depiction of what its like to fear yourself.  To wish that you could rope in that dark side of your mind and control it, but sometimes you can't.  That deep need and desire for an outlet for all the strife and pain and anger and hurt and sadness.

This is a very real movie.  I love the way it is filmed.  I love the way it is written.  I love the way it holds me, fixated on the screen, until the very end. See what you think.",1175212800,,773,3.8417721518987342

I've never watched a movie that was filmed entirely with a hand-held camera, so for the first few minutes the scenes made me a little dizzy because they jump around a lot. But, it's the way they filmed this movie that really made it stand out. It gave it a realistic effect, very raw and in-your-face. I thought the acting was really well done, and I could immediately feel a connection with the charactures as the movie progressed. I've been through a very similar experience in my life, and the way the film was depicted was precise and hit home for me. A few of the charactures in this movie had actually been in Psychiatric Hospitals, and had gone through group therapy and experienced mental illness first hand, so that gave the movie an even more accurate feel. The struggles are very real, it really is a true look into the lives of people who are not so perfect, but are more like you and me than you may realize.",1174608000,,941,4.413793103448276

1954688,3,B0000VLKVM,"I was in a psych ward earlier in my youth for a short time and so i have some experience in a place such as the one that this film takes place although it didn't have a teen ward where people of a similar age group stayed instead all ages were just thrown together unlike in this film.

the film which is about a teen played by joseph gordon-levitt (who has come a long way from his days on 3rd rock from the sun) who finds himself in a downward rage filled spiral that eventually leads him (by way of a vicious beating with a baseball bat) to what i would describe as a new age psych ward... i say ""new age"" or ""experimental"" because it seems to be more about therapy and discovery rather than your typical throw someone in a facility and dope him/her up and nothing much else which is the way most normal places are... this place however tries to really help the troubled teens breakthrough their own troubles and look within themselves to try and deal with things and try and look at life in a different way... the head guy in charge is played by don cheadle who is always solid.

the story basically follows gordon-levitt as he goes through life in the psych ward.. and the people he meets and his struggle with everything.

the cast who portrays the group of troubled teens does good job at presenting the viewer with the type of people one would find in such an experience... one not familiar with the subject i think would believe that in such a place it is just a bunch of complete psychos biting their own hands and mumbling about president lincoln which isn't true for the most part... you will find all types of people from the severe to the slightly disturbed to the person who may be dealing with alot at that time but eventually would get through it and i think the way it was done in presenting this type of balance was good to see.

i came away very moved from the story and i think that's the sign of a good film if you are touched in some way after it fade's to black.. if you come way moved like where you feel the need to come on amazon and write your feelings on what you just experienced hehe... so ya i think it did what it set out to do.

i especially thought michael bacall's performance was great (he also cowrote the story) and i very much liked the ending and was really touched by how the girl's painting matched with the bus i felt all tingly when that hit me.

so go out and rent or buy this and give it a chance maybe you will like it.. maybe you won't all i can say is i did.",1162684800,6,2508,4.171487603305785

This movie gives the effect more of any other movie I saw (girl interrupted, one flew over the coo coos nest) what being in a psych ward is really like. Jordan Melamed said that he wanted to capture the darkside of what it is really like inside one of those places and he definitely got his point across with this movie. There are a couple of things in this movie that would obviously not happen however they needed to be put in I think to make the movie more interesting. This movie is a must see expecially for those poeple that don't see the way of life for alot of people out there. The whole point to this movie is, unless you fix your troubles within you will never be free no matter where you go.

1954690,3,B0000VLKVM,I recently caught this movie on The Movie Channel. I think as it stands the movie was a solid tale filled with surprise performances.  I found myself reminded of the novel A Million Little Pieces several times while watching.  If you can find this movie at your local video store to rent or at a bargain price point it is worth it the time.,1150588800,,340,4.296875
1954691,5,B0000VLKVM,"This movie, Manic, is the first movie in a long time that I was eager to watch. I know it was released back in 2003 or 2004, and I've seen the movie case at video stores but never bothered to look and see what it was about. Well, you know on those really lazy days when there seems to be nothing to do, and you're just flipping through the channels on TV desperately trying to find something to watch? On one of those days, I saw a movie coming on entitled ""Manic"", and I figured due to the title it may have something to do with manic depression, (which would make the movie interesting since I have it), so I decided to hit the information button to get a plot sypnosis. It sounded good so I watched it. I'm glad I did.

The movie is centered around Lyle (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a teen who had an abusive father and has a huge anger problem. From the beginning, you hear noises that sound like someone being beaten, which is exactly what's happening, as Lyle beats another teen across the head with a baseball bat at a game, and you learn that the teen he beats has to get his jaw wired shut. These actions get him a place in a psychiatric ward, seeing as he needed help controlling his anger and his self-abuse, as he also cut himself and sometimes burned himself with cigarettes.

The other teens at the ward are very realistic with their problems. Chad (played by Michael Bacall) is suffering with depression and also has a cutting problem. Another teen, Kenny, was sexually abused and as a result molested young children himself. One girl, Tracy, has terrifying nightmares that make her scream when she tries to sleep. Mike is a teen who in his own words, likes to smoke, drink, and likes to fight. Sara is a girl who also has a cutting problem and has depression. The doctor, David Monroe, (played amazingly by Don Cheadle), works with the teens and you can tell he actually cares about them. David doesn't feed nonsense to his teens though, and he doesn't lie to them. He tells Lyle in the film that his anger will most likely be with him for his whole life, but he's got to learn how to live with it and express it in a less destructive way, or he will keep on until he hurts someone he cares about or maybe even kills himself.

The script, dialogue, scenes, and all the problems presented are very realistic. I myself actually have many of the problems that the teens have in the film, especially an anger problem just like Lyle, so I know that the emotional scenes are not overacted or overdramatic. Lyle makes a rival with Mike in the film, and many of the more serious scenes in the movie are where Lyle lashes out at him in a very believable manner. Viewers with anger problems, like me, can empathize with Lyle and his feelings. I believe anyone who has had problems like anger, cutting, and/or depression can connect with this movie on a deep level just like I did.

Some people complain about the way the movie was filmed. Yes, at times the camera angles may become annoying, as this is a lower budget film. The angles make the film appear a little like a documentary, even though it is not. If you can get past the way the camera moves, and just focus on the story and what's happening, this should not be a big deal. The acting in the movie is great in my opinion. Michael Bacall did a great job as Chad. Don Cheadle does an amazing job in the film. His emotions are especially felt in one scene where he goes into a rage ironically in response to an altercation between Lyle and Mike. They couldn't have picked any other actor to play Lyle better than Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who is definitely a promising actor. He portrays Lyle very well. The film also avoids cliche's. In reality there are no happy endings where everyone turns out just fine at the end of some terrible period of their life. This movie shows that, making it even more realistic in it's approach. The movie shows the true issues that teens have in their lives that so many movies do NOT show, and it shows those issues perfectly. Even though there are some problems not shown, it doesn't take anything away from the movie.

One only problem I have with this movie is something other reviewers have mentioned: the film just ends, leaving us with no answers. No loose ends are tied up. You don't find out what happens to any of the other patients in the ward. It just kind of leaves you hanging to guess for yourself. But other than this, there really isn't anything else I could complain about. The acting is great, the script and dialogue is nice, and the overall story is very realistic. People like me who have very similar problems to the characters in the movie may appreciate this movie more than others who don't, but I believe anyone can enjoy it. It's powerful, gripping, and you won't forget about it for a long time after watching. Give Manic a try.",1150070400,2,4846,4.428251121076233
1954692,5,B0000VLKVM,"This is an unknown great film that should be much better known - starring some very talented actors.  Led by Don Cheadle, brilliant as always, the cast creates a pretty real status of a group of teenagers stuck in an asylum and trying to deal with that fact, their pasts and what's happening to them now.  I highly recommend this film!",1147564800,,335,4.475409836065574
1954693,3,B0000VLKVM,"It had that quasi improvised feel like a Cassavetes movie, and I wondered especially about the one scene where compassionate Don Cheadle hands out pieces of paper to all the teens, questions which he jokes were given to him by Yoda.  Improvised, or just really banal, I can't make up my mind.

You can see it all coming a mile away; as soon as Lyle and Chad start making plans to take off for Amsterdam with Chad's trust fund (Amsterdam!  Like the end of HAROLD AND KUMAR GO TO WHITE CASTLE) you know something will happen to destroy their dreams and since Lyle's the star, you know that fate will come down hard on Chad.  Chad, played by Michael Bacall, is a mess, but you knew that going in especially when the credits announce that Bacall also wrote this movie!  You know he's going to write himself some juicy, scene stealing speeches.  Bacall also wrote the later, far more interesting teen film BOOKIES.

I loved Joseph Gordon Levitt in MYSTERIOUS SKIN and was hoping to see more of his good side on display as Lyle, the boy who injured a teammate with a baseball bat.  He's good here, but after an hour or so I felt like I'd seen everything he had to offer and the rest of the movie was just serving time.  Now I'm not even looking forward to seeing BRICK as I had been before turning on MANIC.

It was sort of like CUCKOO'S NEST meets BREAKFAST CLUB, especially the scene where the boys play b-ball while the girls put Goth makeup on each other.  To sum it up, this is a listless, well-intentioned social drama with a lot of over-the-top acting by a cast of actors of whom, roughly half are awful, the other half outstanding.",1144195200,,1633,4.41
1954734,2,B0000VLKVM,"I was a bit disappointed when I saw this movie because I expected it to be so much MORE and it wasn't. It does offer a brief look into an adolescent psychiatric ward that is realistic- but I would have liked it if the movie really showed the people struggling in the psych ward with different specific disorders. We have some severely catatonic schizophrenic people...and then there are those who self destruct by cutting and burning... there are a handful of those who struggle with anger management..and a girl who has severely scary nightmares. What about the other things? The opportunity to put in other disorders & conditions such as bipolar.. or eating disorders.. or even someone who struggled with multiple personalities- I think the directors could have made it a lot more interesting if they took more time to make it.

I am not saying it is unrealistic because I did spend some time in a psych ward..and there was things such as level drops and prohibiting the use of shoelaces on our shoes and of course- anything sharp. There was even the occasional person that would try to smoke in the bathrooms. However, it's hard to make a movie like this because it feels like so much more of a documentary than a movie...and I really didn't like that.

We learn the subconcious of our past can also play a role in our lives...chronically depressed or not.  Each character gives us a look into what can happen when we let our sicknesses get out of control, as well as what can happen if we always fight it.

1954736,5,B0000VLKVM,"I am currently a mental health care worker that works in a facility like this. I can't believe how relistic this movie is compared to the real thing. Sure there are some moments in the movie which a professional will say that ""it wouldnt work like that"" or ""That should have been handled differently"" however, overall the movie was awesome. The main thing I liked about this movie was the therapist and his drive to help even though everything he tries usually leads to failure with the kids he works with. Working in this field, I know EXACTLY how he feels. How can you reach people who don't want to be reached? It hurts so much and is very draining to care about those that don't care about themselves. I understand all of the theories of how to help people however there are those that it doesnt matter what you try. It doesnt matter to them... they have already given up on themselves. This movie shows all of that. I highly relate to the therapist of this movie. This movie would be great to use in regards to mental health staff training and even during group therapy with trouble kids - especially teens. I think it would be helpful to let kids see other kids act the way they do at times and see what they feel about it - what comes up for discussion. See there I'm in the process of trying to figure out another way of helping. Its a constant cycle. Keep trying and trying. One sad thing about this movie is that there are some kids that are helped in real life. I don't want anyone to read this post or watch the movie and feel this type of care is worthless because it is not. I have made a difference in the lives of many kids. I wish this movie would have shown one kid having a break through that led to success. It didnt. That was the missing component of the movie. It's an amazing feeling to make a difference in someone's life - to save someone's life by showing them a better way of living. It's a great feeling to get through to them. I wish the movie would have shown that. Another thing I didn't like is that the regular mental health care worker, not the therapist, was shown more as a bouncer in the movie. If something went wrong they were there to restrain and the therapist did all of the mental health care work. In real life treatment, that is totally not true. Most of the time it is the regular mental health care worker doing the day to day routines and working with the real problems. The therapist just comes in for their weekly group and individual sessions. I wish they would have shown the value and the drive of the workers that work on the floor taking care of the kids. With that said, this is a great movie most people probably couldn't relate to.
