8722201,5,B010EAJA9W,"I bought this directly from nis America
And I absolutely love this anime with its fantastic animation/quality and a great twist of romance and comedy that will leave you on the edge of your seat after every episode",1505952000,,214,4.657894736842105
8722202,4,B010EAJA9W,"This is a beautiful show, that has flawed characters grow as the episodes go forward. Other reviewers have mentioned the glaring 1 star review; I'll add on to that. This is a drama show, obviously this is not that 1-star reviewer's genre since every show he recommended to watch aside from Spice and Wolf is a comedy. Take that as you will.",1499212800,,340,4.5
8722203,5,B010EAJA9W,"For some reason, some guy gave this show a 1 star review, siting how the main male character, Hikari, acts like an abusive jerk to the main female character Monaka.  Also, the conservative factions of both the surface and the undersea communities we're extremely adversarial and reactionary.

He's right.  That's how the show started.  Mr. one star then made the argument that this means the creators of the show condone this kind of behavior.  Then why, I wonder, did the remaining 23 or so episodes focus on growth and change beyond this state?  It makes me think the reviewer stopped after the first three episodes.

Well too bad for them.  They missed a pretty good show.  I'd give it 8/10 for most of the series, but the last three episodes push that to a 9/10.  The closest I can match that grade on Amazon is to give the show 5 stars, so, there you have it.

...and to recommend Negima?  Really?",1482624000,5,902,4.53416149068323
8722204,1,B010EAJA9W,"Im appalled at this shows reviews, 3 so far, which totally failed to address the shows content. Yes, the animation quality and landscapes are first rate. The character design is quite average, especially noses being chopped off. The music was just not bad for me.

Regarding what really matters, content, its plain poison by promoting toxic values at a higher rate than Ive seen in all other anime. Many anime are surely grosser than Lull in the Sea (LIS) such as Speed Grapher or Elfen Lied, which make clear their content is only meant for insane people, no exaggeration. LIS -on the other hand- comes across as an artistic AND positive series, of which there are not really too many such as Aria the Animation (and sequels), Honey & Clover, Ristorante Paradiso, Tokyo Godfathers, Blue Spring Ride and Bunny Drop.

LIS is very strong on portraying dysfunctional or plain condemnable behaviors as totally acceptable, even examples of empathy. LIS main topics seem to be the trials of dealing with people different from you and your kind and the trials of life-lessons: tolerance, controlling your anger, realizing that other people are not as evil as they come across and that at the end they're human just like you. All of this sounds great. In LIS the trails belong to a group of 4 teenagers who live under the sea (simple fantasy to draw more audience) and happen to start taking classes above the sea in a coastal town because their school just closed down. Thus, the main conflict and attraction here is the clash between sea and surface people.

 LIS starts with Hikari Sakishima, a boy who from the very beginning heads to his new school full of hatred and rage, which he lashes on his friend Manaka Mukaido. Theres hardly a time when Hikari does something other than hating, scolding, offending, fighting and making hideous faces.

LIS does the service on showing that all Hikari does is being a typical human, which is just copying what he sees around: a beautiful town full of hate-filled and highly repressive and conservative people or more exactly a criminal mob. They drag his older sister Akari to the towns temple and pull her head down because she is dating a guy from the surface. Hikaris dad couldn't tell the mob the basics because obviously that town is so backwards that basic respect simply doesnt exist there. This dad himself calmly sided with the mob, gracefully but still agreeing with the mob.

Hikari by his part lashes at Akaris boyfriend calling him criminal and giving him a physical beating! This series is quite draining to watch, yet reviewers are so brain-clogged that they said nothing so far. Akari is an adult, I say it just to stress the offense of the situation where both men and women are explicitly banned from dating until they go straight for marriage. The landscapes may be awsome but the situations feel pretty much like Afghanistan and the like.

If you rationally believe Hikari needs severe psychiatrist therapy and seclusion in a mental institution (or going to jail) you won't find a single soul in the entire series who thinks so too, not even from his sea buddies who are nice and calm. Not only Hikari is forgiven for his behavior he is actually praised and even loved for it under the disguise that he cares. Hikaris surface classmates are not that much better than him and they also get similar approval by semi-hero Tsumugu who claims that they are not bad people. No one is entirely evil but a part in all of us is surely evil at different degrees in different times. People like Hikari and his surface classmates badly need someone to confront them and -yes- they also need a big deal of patience, support and approval in some very careful way, a quite way different one from the plain approval portrayed in LIS.

This is a sick pattern  shown sometimes Japanese shows: the defense of hatred, violence or simple disrespect as forms of caring for others. These shows cannot even claim this behavior is misguided love; they present it as real love when in fact their claim of love is only a tool to justify their misbehavior. Deep down they know the truth by showing failed relationships. In LIS, Hikari never gets to fulfill his love with Manaka (the same one hes always trashing) and LIS only ends up with an open ending as to what may happen in future to them, an ending that happens in some other shows with jerks. Sometimes they don't even get hopes of getting the girl such as in Lunar Legend Tsukihime.

Theres evidence that these anime series reflect values of real Japanese or Far East people, such as the real-life movie Fear and Trembling, Fortunately not all Far East people are like that.

Some fans may say that Hikari is still able to apologize himself, which he also does in a dramatic and conceited form, again typical of some anime.
There are still many options if you want positive and better food for your mind along with fantasy. Try these series:
-Devil is a Part-Timer
-Spice & Wolf
-Kanon, maybe Air
-I couldn't become a hero, so I reluctantly decided to get a job
-Maoyou
These last 2 shows have a lot of fan service and some flaws, but their value stills holds. The equivalent of female fan service is in shows such as Amnesia and The Wallflower
Other shows for most audiences:
-Is the Order a Rabbit?
-Colorful, the Motion Picture
-Sasami-san Ganbaranai
-Negima!? Magister Negi Magi (the other version is rather lame)
These last two series, Sasasami and Negi, come across as silly series but they actually underscore and mock many oppressive traditional Japanese values.",1453507200,2,5557,4.724458204334366
8722205,5,B010EAJA9W,"This series is an amazing one... however, with that aside, I want to do a review on the actual product here.

This price here on Amazon is extremely high. Do make sure to purchase it through NIS America's website instead, it will be over $30 cheaper as well as come with a bonus item.

Now, why is this product great? Overall, it is just a very high quality box set. Usually, I prefer OST (original soundtrack) CDs over an art book when it comes to box sets. However, if a series happens to have great visuals, I'll prefer the art book as long as it's a high quality one (unlike Aniplex).

With A Lull in the Sea, I was a little torn between which I'd prefer. While the visuals were absolutely stunning and enough to warrant wanting an art book, the soundtrack was just simply amazing as well. Like really. One of the best I've ever heard.

That's why I consider this box set great. It includes both the OST and a nice art book. All bundled up in a beautiful chipboard art box. Together with the series on Blu-ray, as 1080p truly IS the way to enjoy this series to its fullest, this box set is nothing short of perfect.

I purchased this through NIS America's site, and the bonus flag it came with was awesome as well. Do make sure you grab it from there if you happen to purchase this amazing product.",1450051200,6,1302,4.297959183673469
8722206,5,B010EAJA9W,"I finished watching the first cour in a night. I watched it around 10 pm and finished around 7 - 8 am. I was addicted to this series and made a vow to buy it to support it whenever it had an official release in America. The soundtrack and animation are to die for. Gorgeous sceneries, backgrounds, everything. Crisp and clean. Cannot wait to rewatch this on the TV screen. It's a definite must-watch and buy for any fans.",1436054400,2,421,4.341772151898734
