7840528,5,6303182127,"This was the first yoga tape I worked with. I think it was a very good introduction to this type activity. Linda explains a lot and is extremely good at talking to you about how to attain an asana as well as what you should be looking for as far as the feeling each one should give you, and what it should not. It is instructional and good for a beginner.
  There are two weaknesses. First of all there is no cool down at the end which is as important as any of the other positions. The other is the neck roll. On Linda's later video she says this is not done anymore. But this was my first exposure and it drew my interest into yoga by not being too intimidating. And for that, it is important. She does not require any props (not even a sticky mat) which I like also. The tape is 45 minutes long but she talks a lot and after I became familiar with her method I can now do the class without the tape (isn't this our ultimate goal) in about 30 minutes so it fits into my busy schedule and I can play whatever music I choose.
  This class leaves me feeling balanced and exercised without being worn out. When I have been unwell, this is the first video I use to resume my exercise routine. It is gentle and effective.",995760000,4,1217,4.100840336134453
7840529,5,6303182127,"I specifically ordered this video because of the reviews which said it was simple for beginners.  I must say it was worth every penny and more.  Linda's instructions are clear, her demonstration is taylored to even to  those of us that are way out of shape. I will be purchasing the rest of the  series.",947808000,11,303,4.454545454545454
