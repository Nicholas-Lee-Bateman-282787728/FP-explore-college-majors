7968328,5,B00006G8JE,"I have always loved Christmas specials and movies. For years I was at the mercy of the program directors of the networks to show these classics (and hope that they didn't show the God-awful colorized versions). These are truly endearing. In this day and age of reality tv and low-grade morons trying to get famous by doing stupid, nasty things, these classics may appear to be sappy and lame. However I think that sometimes we need movies with a happy ending, no foul language and no idiotic people doing stupid things, simply to clean the palette and maybe to remember how far we have fallen as a culture.",1219622400,3,606,4.62037037037037
7968329,4,B00006G8JE,This the best of the classic holiday films... much like Christmas Vacation... your true holiday spirit will bubble through as you watch this again and again. This a great story of faith & love...its a story for all ages as well. Jimmy Stewart is great.,1040688000,3,252,4.622222222222222
