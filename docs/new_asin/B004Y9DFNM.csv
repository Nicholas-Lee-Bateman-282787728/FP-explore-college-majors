8448001,5,B004Y9DFNM,Two of my favorite performers. Argerich is superb.,1440288000,,50,5.375
8448002,5,B004Y9DFNM,"First of all the program is perfect. Starting with Dvorak's a lovely little piece, the inspiring contemporary piece, followed by the well-known Franck piece for cello/piano and finished with Shostakovich 9.

Performance is perfect too.  Lucerne Symphony Orchestra conducted by Neeme Jarvi is so vivid and energetic.  Argerich and Maisky know the music even with the world premiere contemporary piece.  They were very well prepared.

I wished to be there that night, but this fabulous Bluray recording makes me feel almost I were.",1347148800,4,529,5.325301204819277
8448003,5,B004Y9DFNM,"This technically and musically superb Accentus disc featuring Neeme Jarvi and the Lucerne Symphony Orchestra generously offers music by Dvorak, Cesar Franck and Shostakovich's 9th symphony, but really the focus of attention is on Mischa Maisky and Martha Argerich performing the World Premiere of Rodion Shchedrin's Double Concerto for Piano and Cello, specially written for and dedicated to this pair of super soloists.
  Shchedrin titles it ""Romantic Offering"" and regards it as a concerto for two protagonists, male and female. To my ears this is a concerto for two lovers. The first movement opens delicately with some soft notes from the piano answered by a deep sigh from the cello... and the dialogue begins. Themes are expressed and tossed from one partner to the other and passions build up, though still somewhat restrained, the bass notes and taut rhythm pulsating like repressed desire. Emotions run high in the 2nd. movement, allegro. There is no holding back now. The cello sings the lyrical parts whilst the piano continues its urgent and insistent rhythmic line, the bass notes coming fast and furious. Tension mounts. Things come to a head and the movement ends dramatically with a high shriek from the cello and massed strings that is nothing short of a cry of ecstasy ! Then follows a poignant silence before quiet notes from the piano introduce the last movement. Now the cello part is full and melodious and Maisky with his fabulous touch and rubato shows why he is so highly sought after. The movement echoes the themes of the first two and ends gently on a hushed note. Loved it. This is music that grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go. Argerich plays the very difficult piano part with bravura and as for Maisky, wow, what can I say. Will this become standard repertoire ? I certainly hope so .
  Back to something more familiar and the next work has Maisky and Argerich collaborating in Cesar Frank's sonata for cello and
piano (original: violin and piano). The lyrical writing for the violin suits Maisky very well. With his fabulous technique and expressive
playing, he shows why he is so highly regarded as a cellist's cellist, and here he simply mesmerizes with beautiful and limpid
lyricism. The cello sounds even better than the original violin and Argerich's sensitive pianism simply made the sonata sound even more exquisite. I just know I will listen to this magical performance again and again.
  As if these two fabulous musical offerings are not enough, we have Neeme Jarvi leading the Lucerne Symphony Orchestra in a glowing account of Shostakovich's ninth, a version that is as good as any and in fact better than many. The clarinets and flutes impress in the second movement, but it is the opening of the largo fourth that is really special: trumpets, trombones and tuba blaring forth followed by a bassoon solo too beautiful for words. Ensemble playing from the orchestra is top notch and all in all this is a most satisfying performance.
  For fans of Maisky and Argerich, this is obviously a must have, but for anyone who loves great music,  this must also be highly recommended.",1322092800,6,3128,4.886792452830188
8448004,5,B004Y9DFNM,"Martha Argerich is the grand dame of the piano and her reputation for great performances has not diminished with age or health.  Unfortunately her guest appearances with the major orchestras around the world are often cancelled at the last minute (at times allowing fascinating new artists to step into her spotlight to the delight of otherwise disappointed audiences).  So it is with excitement that the releases of her performances at festivals on DVD give the double pleasure of hear AND seeing this wizard of the keyboard.

This DVD was recored live in February 2011 at the Lucerne Concert Hall - the raison d'etre being the premiere of a work written by Russian composer Rodion Konstantinovich Shchedrin especially for Martha Argerich and Misha Maisky, often her partner in performances. That particular piece, The Double Concerto for Piano and Cello, 'Romantic Offering'', is accessible and flashy and, as we have come to expect from this composer, the percussive elements are a main focus (refer to his Carmen Suite).  In the last movement the work stresses lyricism and it is here that Argerich and Miasky glow.  The other work that truly gives Argerich and Miasky the opportunity to display their considerable talents is the Csar Franck: Violin Sonata in A major, as arranged for cello and piano.  The full range of the long collaborative experiences shines in their execution of this only semi-interesting piece.

The concert opens with a rousing performance of Dvo'rk's Scherzo capriccioso with Neeme Jrvi conducting the Lucerne Symphony Orchestra and the final work is a very solid and exciting reading of Shostakovich's Symphony No. 9, a work Jrvi always performs well.  In all, the DVD captures an exciting concert - a world premiere for the guest artists, the opportunity to actually see Argerich with Miasky, and  Jrvi's obvious compatibility with the Lucerne Orchestra.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, August 11",1313280000,10,1930,5.193548387096774
