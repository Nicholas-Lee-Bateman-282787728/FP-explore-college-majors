8177346,4,B000NDI4WU,"Don't trust me too much on that because I'm a FLEISCHER fan and my judgments are colored. Nethertheless our own JULIETTE GRECO, who was ZANUCK's mistress at the time ,leading to the companion film THE BIG GAMBLE and the former HUSTON's ROOTS OF HEAVEN ,is rather good. ORSON WELLES could be good too, he had starred in FLEISCHER's COMPULSION (and as the uncredited narrator as the opening of THE VIKINGS, remember: ""the wrath of the Vikings!"", as did BRADFORD DILLMAN, his co star in this new film.
The story is rather complicated and I don't remember it well. It has to do with adultery , murder and trial. What else could you expect in
PARIS?
Consider it as a three star movie and buy the DVD. Black and white CinemaScope, and Panavision were the greatest thing that happened to the movie industry ,and buy COMPULSION a really great movie, from a great book
for the same reasons).",1237766400,4,882,4.624203821656051
