For once, a really nice script plus some martial arts and a feel-good movie with a great beginning, fun middle, and excellent ending. SCI-FI movies are usually not this satisfying. Although it was released in 1995, it could be a big block buster for the future. They referenced 2002 - 2008 as wars in Russia and how they had special high-powered drugs, like heroin, injected in mega doses to our US soldiers to win these wars. Well, it's 2017 and we are still in a war against drugs. The beautiful love story between the lead male and his charge was very tender. It was photographed as though it were a foreign film. But it was touching and kept me on the edge of my seat. This has to be the BEST movie Lorenzo made. Love it. 10 stars.",1501113600,,820,4.262820512820513

8049108,1,B0007N1JM8,"I bought this because sadly I do enjoy Lorenzo Lamas in Renegade.  I had no expectations for this movie but if you have netflix, blockbuster or something rent it.  This has to be close to one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  Definately an hour and half I'll never get back",1292630400,,276,4.269230769230769

8049110,4,B0007N1JM8,"Don't miss this fantastic sci-fi/action movie from 1995!  The story is set in the (then) near-future year 2008 and stars Lorenzo Lamas (""Renegade"", ""The Immortal""), Kari Wuhrer (""Sliders""), Chris Sarandon (""Fright Night""), and Peter Coyote (""Time Rider"", ""The 4400"").  Since Amazon.com has neglected to provide a plot summary, I'll quote from the back of the DVD case: ""Action megastar Lorenzo Lamas battles the brains behind a criminal Virtual Reality (VR) empire in this suspense-packed, sci-fi adventure.  The year: 2008.  Virtual sex and drugs have replaced real experiences--while dramatically increasing crime.  Enter metro vice cop Bobby Chase (Lorenzo Lamas), a Russian Cartel War vet.  Aided by high-tech optic implants--replacing the eyes he lost in battle--Chase has vowed to bring VR crime master Reginald Matthews (Chris Sarandon) to justice.  Moonlighting as bodyguard to gorgeous virtual sex goddess Pamela Travis (Kari Wuhrer), Chase learns of Matthews' plans to manufacture female sex slaves.  After discovering Pamela is the next clone subject, Bobby enters Matthews' lasest VR game, HELLRAISER, for a no-holds barred fight to the death.""  I LOVED THIS MOVIE!  This DVD will be in my collection forever.",1242950400,6,1221,5.586956521739131
8049111,5,B0007N1JM8,"I've enjoyed this film by Lorenzo Lamas for several years, having first watched it on television, taped it, and rewatched it numerous times.  Finally, I purchased it!  Lamas as a cop with prosthetic eye implants is terrific, and this is an exhilerating B-movie action role!  With fast-paced action, Lamas is the perfect eye-candy for an enjoyable rainy evening.",1180483200,4,361,5.189655172413793
