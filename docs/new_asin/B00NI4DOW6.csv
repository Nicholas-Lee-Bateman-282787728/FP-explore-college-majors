Id say a show Definitely worth Owning.

Overall Rating 5/5
A notebook falls from the sky and this if found by a bored, high school genius Light Yagami.  The rules written on the inside cover include the title of this review, ""The human whose name is written in this note shall die.""

It's a story about shinigami, death gods, and guy who believe's he's the one true judge, jury, and executioner.  An amazing show that pits the clever and dangerous Light Yagami against the great and secretive detective ""L"".  For a show that has this much death, there really isn't many fights to speak of.  The battle of wit and cunning drive the show to a unique drama and intensity that really can't be missed.

The total show has 39 episodes.  I cant say I know the exact episode but part way there is a major change.  Ignore what you may have read online.  The show completes at episode 39.  It's still a solid show after this major event and of course it doesn't conclude until the end...

Theme Songs 4/5
This series has some great music, a good opening and ending. Fast paced, I didn't skip them.
Theme Songs [2nd op & ed] 5/5
The 2nd opening & ending themes are excellent.  The power and intensity of these songs make them some of the best themes across all anime.

Ending 4/5
NO spoilers, the total end was solid enough. It's about what you expect or the opposite.  The end concluded what it should, nothing more and nothing less.",1502668800,,1514,4.434782608695652
6657038,5,B00NI4DOW6,"Ahh, Death Note! An amazing anime, almost a masterpiece, so much of a masterpiece in fact that there are many iterations of it. Including films and a full Japanese Drama, also a new movie coming this year 2017 on Netflix! This box set definitely is a great way to watch the original, it includes the English Dub (A very good one at that!) by Viz Media! and the Subbed version, both openings and endings, with no credits on them, a great option. Sound and quality on these DVD's are amazing, the BluRay is definitely much cleaner, but if you cannot find the money to afford that one, just settle for this one. All in all, an amazing way to rewatch or experience Death Note for many times over!",1502150400,2,692,4.4140625

Blu Ray does this series justice as you can see both vivid and dark, gothic colors.  You also have your preference of Japanese, English, Spanish, French, and Portuguese spoken languages as well as subtitles.

Very well written story with very memorable characters; especially in the roles of Light, L, and Near to name a few.  Highly recommended!",1485129600,4,500,4.8352941176470585

6657060,5,B00NI4DOW6,"Great story! If your into movies of battle of the minds? Then this is the series for you!

The intro  of the show is something hard to describe. The show begins with hard rock music. Even though the music is in another language, it just not a cup of tea that can be easily swallow, but other people may like. If you over look the intro of how the show goes. The whole story is base on the battle of the minds. The story is about a book call the ""Death Note."" The book grant the user the power to kill people, but there rules. As the show moves on, you learn what the rules of the ""Death Note."" Written below are some of the rules:

1. The human whose name is written in this note shall die. This note will not take effect unless the writer has the subject's face in mind when writing his/her name. This is to prevent people who share the same name from being affected.
2. If a Death Note owner accidentally misspells a person's name four times, that person will be free from being killed by the Death Note. However, if the Death Note owner intentionally misspells the name four times, the owner will die.
3. If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of the subject's name, it will happen.
4. If the cause of death is not specified, the subject will die of a heart attack.

The show came out in 2007, it is about a high school student ""Light"" who found book call ""Death Note."" He read what was inside, first thoughts it was just a book someone made as a joke. After testing and finding the book to be real. He began on killing criminals. People who are awaiting trials, or wanted by the FBI, CIA, so on. He believed he can shape the world. If only the criminals are just dying, many people may be fine with that, but the law is the law.

That battle of the minds takes place between the student Light, and high level detective L. The art work of the show is Goth-infuse, but can be describe as a cat-and-mouse case thriller.",1482969600,,1932,4.210810810810811

6657064,5,B00NI4DOW6,"As someone who has only been watching Blu Rays for maybe a year now, I've become spoiled by the improved sound and picture quality. That said, I'll still by the DVD of something if I don't feel like spending the extra money. I'd I'm buying a Blu Ray, it needs to either be a movie or show I care for very much, or a visually gripping movie that's just not done justice in standard definition.

Deathe Note falls into both those categories. It's one of my favorite anime for its amazing game of intellects, and the music and visuals are gorgeous. Maybe not as dynamic as something like Bleach or Soul Eater, but this anime isn't about flashy effects or powerful, epic finishing moves (unless you count the Death Note, I guess). If you like something like Sherlock versus Moriarty, you'll probably enjoy this, even of you don't like anime. If you are an anime fan, all the better. Like I said, it's not about big epic fist fights or sword clashing  (not to say it's entirely deprived of action), it's a thinker's anime that observe's intellect, human flaws and morality.

I highly recommend getting this on Blu-ray, but if you can't afford it, buy the DVD. My only complaint is I wish there was more Death Note. The last third of the show isn't quite as strong in my opinion, but still very good and on par. Bottom line, if you like anime and like shows that make you think, BUY THIS.",1482624000,6,1382,4.454545454545454

In retrospect, perhaps this occurrence is appropriate for a Death Note.

I finally had a chance to watch this series on Netflix, but I am so far not impressed. The problem is that there is a good premise,  that is ultimately unsatisfying to watch due to so many parts of it that are beyond ridiculous. Some include Yagmi having access to his father's police database from his house, apparently untraceable, and no time logs? That's just one of many things. Much of the dialog between L and Light consist of conjecture, analysis, and conclusion, rarely does it ever have any decent internal logic that actually makes sense.

6657097,5,B00NI4DOW6,"One of the best anime thrillers, supernatural, detective series of all time. Here is my review for Death Note the Complete Series! Enjoy!

Plot and Characters: (minor spoilers only) One day in a relm called the Shinigami world, a board Shinigami (aka Reaper of death) Ryuk drops a mystical note book that when any humans name is written in the book shall die. A high school student at the time and genius Light Yagami who is wishing to do better justice in the world finds the book. Skeptical at the time when he finds the Death Note, takes it along with him. When he sees a girl getting harassed by some bikers he writes down the bikers name and the biker dies of a heart attack. Then he kills another vandal by him getting hit by a truck. Shocked at what he done he goes into an ally and pukes. Finding out that the Death Note is real, goes home and looks at other criminal names and starts killing them off. When Light takes a break he is met by Ryuk the Shinigami who tells Light he may kill as many people as he want with the note book and do everything, Ryuk will leave once and for all when either the note book is destoryed or Light dies which ever comes first. So now Light goes on a complete power trip and thinks as him self as a mortal god who will kill he finds all to be evil and make the perfect utopia. After so many killings Light takes over the name as everyone called him Kira which translated in the anime means Killer in japanese. Then not soon after Light/Kira faced with the worlds greatest dective of all time, a boy called ""L"" who vows to find Kira and stop him from killing once and for all. This starting the ultimate Cat and Mouse game. But the true question is who is the cat and who is the mouse?

Pros: Amazing, super awesome, top of the line storyline here. It is so well written and thought out I watched the whole series three times from start to finnish and still got sucked into the story each time and love it still. The characters are extremely well developed, the action is going strong, the music in the series is awesome! This series containing all 37 episodes is feature with both english and japanese dubbed and subbed. The extra's are trailers for other anime's, behind the scenes of Death Note with the english cast and theme and ending songs without titles. The box it comes in is very nice but flimzy at best, the box shows Ryuk's face, one the back it gives a few details about the show and some pictures from random episodes like all dvds back covers generic like. Two of the most reconized english dubbed cast members Brad Swaile who played the main character Light Yagami, And Brian Drummond plays Ryuk the Shinigami. Brad Swaile also played Rokuro Okajimi, Brian Drummond plays Benny from the Black Lagoon anime series (check out my review for it please!!!)

Cons: The only con I have with the series is the box, one day I accidently dropped the box on the ground and the paper of the box tore slightly, so be very careful with the box and how you handle it.

Over all: This is one of the best anime series of all time, its a total Thriller and will keep you on your toes guessing who will get who in the end. BUY THIS SERIES!!!! it is the best around!!!!",1459814400,,3207,4.313432835820896
6657098,5,B00NI4DOW6,I already love this Anime and now to have the complete series it's perfect. You have the options to choose between English or Japanese and it also has subtitles. .. you can't go wrong here,1457740800,,188,4.4
6657099,1,B00NI4DOW6,"Death Note is one of my all time favorite Anime shows. The Anime itself deserves 5 stars. This release, however, only deserves 1 star because it has one fatal flaw that I can not look past. There is no subtitle option to select only translations for onscreen Japanese text. The onscreen text translation is only available as part of the spoken translation. Being able to understand the onscreen Japanese text plays a part in following the story and is integral to the enjoyment of the show.

So, how does a dub fan watch the show? You can have the subtitles off and every time there is Japanese text onscreen, you can rewind, pause, change to English subtitles, play, pause, switch subtitles off and play again. Sounds flawed, doesn't it? Alternatively, you can leave the subtitles on. But that is also flawed as you don't need them. To make matters worse, if you leave the subtitles on, the text for the spoken words does not match the spoken English but rather the Japanese, as can be expected. So now it is almost as if you have a narrator repeating everything in his own words.

I had been waiting a long time for the Blu-ray release, mainly because the original DVD release has this problem on the first few single disk releases. They fixed it half-way through the show. I had hoped that they would have sorted this out for the Blu-ray release, but they stuffed it up instead.

There is one positive for this release though. The image quality is slightly better than for the DVD release. It isn't true HD quality, but it is an improvement. The video is noticeably less blurry than what a DVD player's up-scaling can achieve.",1457654400,14,1629,4.610344827586207

6657102,5,B00NI4DOW6,"My father bought this for me and I was extremely pleased that it wasn't the DVD quality episodes on a Blu Ray. The scenes and intro are very crisp compared to the DVD copy and there's a huge difference. The only downside to this Blu Ray remaster is that it still uses stereo on the Blu Ray BUT its always been stereo in English and Japanese ever since the first release. The copy I got had English audio and no subtitles enabled by default. It has Japanese and a couple other languages for audio and also subtitles for each as well.

The DVD edition has 4 episodes on each disk and the Blu Ray edition has 8 on each disk. So 10 disks in all for the DVD box and 5 for the standard Blu Ray box.

I have made 2 sets of screenshots comparing (almost the same time on each) the DVD to this Blu Ray remaster. The difference is very noticeable and its very well done.

This Blu Ray edition is in a slim container of just over 1/2 inch and comes with a nice sleeve to match.",1457136000,33,966,4.073684210526316

Will recommend it to any Anime fan looking into something dark or if your one of those people wanting to be away or scare insane nutjob groups like PTC (Parents Television Council) or 1 Million Moms then this is definitely right in your alley.  Though then again most or all anime would be right since anime life isn't essentially seen in a good light.  Though only for those having a death wish I can recommend and these groups as said are nothing more than hysterical is all I can say and overreact to anything.

6657115,2,B00NI4DOW6,"I appreciate that the anime is trying to cater to those with high intelligence (which is why I did not give it a one star).  It is nice to come across shows and movies that make you think and use your brain.  Too many shows and movies are soooo dumb.

HOWEVER, this anime has too many plot holes that I actually find it insulting to my intelligence.

Each episode adds new ""How To Use It"" rules to the Death Note.  Which are contrived in order to fit the plot of the episode.  Just keep it simple and stick with the original five Rules.
There are more than one Death Notes that end up in the ""Human"" World.  Since Ryuk wrote the Rules in his Death Note, only his should have the Rules in it.  So how did the other Death Notes also have the Rules in them?
The main character, Light (the ""hero""), is supposed to be a genius, with an IQ well above my own above average IQ.  However, I find many things he does as plain dumb, hence makes me question how much of a genius the character (or the author of the manga) really is.
I find it impossible for the Detective L (the ""anti-hero"") and his successors to make their deductions based on the evidence (they have at hand), which many are contrived.
I also find some of the things L and his successors do as plain dumb as well.
Also, no matter how intelligent a person is, I find it hard to believe that Light can outwit Shinigamis more than once.

I love intelligent shows, and I am willing to over look some plot holes.

6657121,5,B00NI4DOW6,"Overall I am happy with my purchase, I was already a fan of deathnote and wanted to own the series. However, I do want to address the issue of video quality for the DVD. I had heard this series had a video quality issue because of the way it was animated and it is unfortunately true. It has nothing to do with the animation quality itself, which is amazing, but with the limit of the video size. Since it was animated at standard definition, it's native resolution is 480pi. This was a problem for me when I was watching it on my 32 inch lcd TV as the animation was blurry and and pixels could be spotted. When i first watched the series it was on my computer, and I had none of those problems, probably because the limitation of the animation size did not show up my standard monitor.

If you do end up watching this on a modern tv or a good computer monitor, you probably will come across what I experienced. The problem was enough for me to wonder if I had received a defective or bootleg product, but after much research, I concluded i had not and it was actually a limitation of how the anime was made. Now that's not a deal breaker for this anime at all, because the series itself is amazing and one of my favorite of all time, however it does make it a shame the animation can't be enjoyed on modern systems.

I will say it does seem to get better as the episodes progress. I don't know if it's because you simply get used to the animation, or because the actual quality of the animation improves. All that being said, you can't go wrong with this purchase for 20 bucks.",1447804800,9,1578,4.239202657807309
6657122,5,B00NI4DOW6,"An awesome series.  It's basically about a very bore but brilliant kid that's bored in life because he can't find a big enough challenge for himself.

So, he goes on a god complex and decides to kill every criminal he decides deserves to die he sees fit on the news day in day out, but is rivaled by an equally as brilliant investigator that challenges his every move.  So the morale of the story is, if you could kill anyone in the world without the fear of being charged with murder whose name would you write in the death note?

6657125,4,B00NI4DOW6,"Death Note has some of the best character development out there. Everyone of the characters have a personality even the minor ones, they each have subtly. The idea of the show is good, it is one that we have all thought of, if I had the power to kill, who would I kill. The show does a good job of showing every side of a choice. How we as people try to justify our decisions. It is a character study, one that forces you to question the actions of the lead character. You are often rooting for him to succeeded, even when some of his actions are heartbreaking and morale wrong. My only real complaint is the second act of the show is a bit slow and not as interesting as the first and final act. But it makes up for it with great characters and well written dialog.",1446422400,,766,4.147651006711409
6657126,4,B00NI4DOW6,"I have had the first volume of the two volume set that Warner Bros put out 3-4 years ago and have long wanted to upgrade so that I had the complete series. I came across this complete series repackage and got excited.

I love Death Note. I think it is a well written series with a great cast of characters (except for one ""girlfriend""). I know that so many reviews describe the series itself so I will try to focus on the package itself.

The outer packaging is basically just a cardboard box. Contained within were two dvd cases containing both volumes of the series. This is where the major disappointment reared its ugly head. The second DVD case was broken. The inner trays for the discs were loose, the last 2 DVDs had marks on them, and the cover art was torn slightly. I found out that the cases the DVDs were shipped in were extremely fragile and the 2nd case was broken during transit. The 1st case was intact, thank god. I replaced the case itself but I am still disappointed that companies that produce DVDs would allow this quality of packaging.

The DVDs themselves were excellent in terms of presentation. There are 10 DVDs with the first 9 being the series itself and the 10th being a bonus disc. When I popped in the first disc, I was happy to find that the encoding from the volumes of 3-4 years ago were contained on these discs. In essence, it is the same menus and quirks in terms of subtitles (you have to turn on the English subtitles in order to read the Japanese script). The intros for the menus from the separate volumes were the same and the menus were what I had lived with for a long time.

The episodes themselves are English dubbed by default but can be switched for Japanese audio with English subtitles if you are a purist. As I mentioned above, you have to turn on the subtitles if you want to read what is written in Japanese during the episodes themselves. All the special features are still here from the separate volumes.

Overall, this is a good upgrade of an existing set, just be warned that it could get damaged during transit. I just wish they hadn't downgraded the cases themselves so that they would become more fragile",1446249600,3,2164,4.44080604534005

The bonus on each DVD is commentary for each english voice(s), so don't understand why the scripts weren't transcribed directly to the english subtitles. I can understand the japanese voice scripts used for the japanese subtitles. An otherwise story ruined by an oversight or mistake.

However,there is a complexity to the main characters and storyline which makes it interesting/appealing for the person who enjoys this genre, or for an avid reader or someone who really understands/appreciates characters/literary development, etc.  While I do not care for this, I do enjoy listening to my daughter and her friends discuss and critique the characters, storyline and  themes, etc.  I feel like at least they get something positive out of it.  A quick gist of the storyline, though.... The main character writes death notes - he names a person and how he/she will die, and then... it happens, exactly as he wrote the death note.

Problems arise for our protagonist, Light Yagami, when he must avoid being found out by his friends, family and the police/authorities (one of which is his own father). This anime series is particularly great, since the ideas in it can be applied to the real world. For instance, what if evil-doers were executed by the hundreds? Would this establish a crime-free society? I certainly think so. The anime itself is not alway serious and there are comedic scenes (along with a very small amount of fan service).

6657165,5,B00NI4DOW6,"This is by far, hands down, one of the best anime series ever made and can be enjoyed by fans and non fans of anime. It has a great cast of characters, great set up story, great plot that gets deeper the further it goes, tons of twist and turns that leaves you at the edge of your seat wanting to find out what happens next, and finally it has a great deal of OMG moments. The premise is simple, one of Japan's top smartest, brightest, and popular high school student who is kind and honest stumble upon a blank notebook that was accidently dropped by the god of death and anyone who's name is written in the book will die, but there are rules in how to use the book. What does he do with the book? Should he get rid of it or use it? What are the consequences for finding and using the notebook? What do you think? I have heard so much about this series and I'm glad that I finally got to watch it and I must say that it's a must see if have never seen or heard of Death Note you will not regret it.",1429574400,3,999,3.9504950495049505
6657166,5,B00NI4DOW6,"One of the best anime thrillers, supernatural, detective series of all time. Here is my review for Death Note the Complete Series! Enjoy!

Plot and Characters: (minor spoilers only) One day in a relm called the Shinigami world, a board Shinigami (aka Reaper of death) Ryuk drops a mystical note book that when any humans name is written in the book shall die. A high school student at the time and genius Light Yagami who is wishing to do better justice in the world finds the book. Skeptical at the time when he finds the Death Note, takes it along with him. When he sees a girl getting harassed by some bikers he writes down the bikers name and the biker dies of a heart attack. Then he kills another vandal by him getting hit by a truck. Shocked at what he done he goes into an ally and pukes. Finding out that the Death Note is real, goes home and looks at other criminal names and starts killing them off. When Light takes a break he is met by Ryuk the Shinigami who tells Light he may kill as many people as he want with the note book and do everything, Ryuk will leave once and for all when either the note book is destoryed or Light dies which ever comes first. So now Light goes on a complete power trip and thinks as him self as a mortal god who will kill he finds all to be evil and make the perfect utopia. After so many killings Light takes over the name as everyone called him Kira which translated in the anime means Killer in japanese. Then not soon after Light/Kira faced with the worlds greatest dective of all time, a boy called ""L"" who vows to find Kira and stop him from killing once and for all. This starting the ultimate Cat and Mouse game.

Pros: Amazing, super awesome, top of the line storyline here. It is so well written and thought out I watched the whole series three times from start to finnish and still got sucked into the story each time and love it still. The characters are extremely well developed, the action is going strong, the music in the series is awesome! This series containing all 37 episodes is feature with both english and japanese dubbed and subbed. The extra's are trailers for other anime's, behind the scenes of Death Note with the english cast and theme and ending songs without titles. The box it comes in is very nice but flimzy at best, the box shows Ryuk's fact, one the back it gives a few details about the show and some pictures from random episodes like all dvds back covers generic like. Two of the most reconized english dubbed cast members Brad Swaile who played the main character Light Yagami, And Brian Drummond plays Ryuk the Shinigami. Brad Swaile also played Rokuro Okajimi, Brian Drummond plays Benny from the Black Lagoon anime series (check out my review for it please!!!)

Cons: The only con I have with the series is the box, one day I accidently dropped the box on the ground and the paper of the box tore slightly, so be very careful with the box and how you handle it.

Over all: This is one of the best anime series of all time, its a total Thriller and will keep you on your toes guessing who will get who in the end. BUY THIS SERIES!!!! it is the best around!!!!",1428710400,6,3145,4.33446519524618

6657185,5,B00NI4DOW6,"I will admit that I haven't watched much anime.  A college friend of mine exposed me to some, and now my wife is exposing me to more.

Since I am not an anime expert, I will approach this review as a fan of fiction in general.  In that respect, it's an excellent, intelligent story that belongs in whatever the video equivalent of a literary canon would be (the manga could be in the actual literary canon, as far as I'm concerned).  It explores the human condition as it relates to having power that should never be in the hands of a single human being.

Granted, that power comes from a death god in this series, but it could have and has come from human beings, as well.  Kings and queens, despots and dictators, cult leaders and medieval church leaders have all had the power of life and death in their hands, and many have abused that power.

Aside from the commentary on concentrated power, the story is told intelligently, showing the evolution of Light Yagami from a believer in justice to a preserver of his own power, going through the thought processes of L and other investigators, operating well within the framework of the rules created for the Death Note.

I hope to get as much out of other anime as I have out of this series.",1424044800,,1242,4.440528634361233
6657186,5,B00NI4DOW6,"I'll admit it. I saw this series for the first time on Netflix so I'm not as familiar with it as others are but I figured I'd write my own review anyway because there's something I have to clear up. For those wanting a blu-ray release, there isn't even one in Japan. And there's a reason for it. This is a digitally created animation, therefor whatever resolution they animated it at is where it's going to stay. I'm going to assume, given the year it was released, it was animated at 480p SD. The reason why other series such as Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, and Cowboy Bebop have gotten the blu-ray treatment recently is because those are cel animation. That means they were hand drawn and laid to film. The resolution on those are basically limitless, so a blu-ray release is justified. Death Note, however, would need to be upscaled to HD and sometimes this can make it look WORSE. Therefor Death Note would not benefit from a blu-ray release and it's likely we'll never see one unless of course they do an HD remaster.

Onto the actual review, I'm not gonna go too in depth because if you've never seen it then it would suck if something were to be spoiled for you. Besides, if you're reading this you probably already know what it's about. All you need to know is, even if you're not a fan of anime, you should enjoy this. You'll be in awe at how complex, well written, and well executed it is right off the bat. You'll also be surprised at how smart and intelligent the characters are. All of the characters' thoughts are expressed out loud so you know the reasons for their actions or the conclusions they come to. This not only makes the series much more easy to follow but also establishes their theories in a realistic way so it doesn't seem like they're pulling them out of thin air. If you're a fan of mindgames and manipulation look no further. The characters don't waste any time questioning if their actions are right or wrong. One of the best aspects of the series is that it lets the viewer decide what's right and wrong and doesn't tell you who you should root for. This makes it very difficult to just simply pick a side. Almost everyone I've asked has given me a different answer when I asked who they rooted for throughout the series. It's also very well paced and all of the side stories and characters have a purpose so if that was a concern don't panic. It's a fairly unique experience so if you want something similar to it you're going to end up disappointed. I've been searching for another anime like this one for a long time and haven't found one. People have recommended me anime such as Monster and Code Geass because I enjoyed Death Note but they're really nothing alike at all.

The audio options are English and Japanese 2.0. So those wanting the dub, it's included. It comes in two separate DVD cases (one for each season) in a slip cover. There are 5 discs in each (37 episodes across 9 discs plus a bonus disc). Each case has its own unique box art. The packaging is quite nice. It would've been cool to have an episode guide with character bios and artwork but I'm not gonna complain. All in all, I'm very satisfied with this release and I think everyone should have it in their collection.",1423699200,60,3227,4.440134907251265

8678360,5,B00NI4DOW6,"Death Note is not just the greatest anime I've ever seen, but it is one of the greatest tv series I've seen.

 I'm not someone who watches a lot of anime, but back in middle school I loved Dragon Ball Z.  It used to come on cartoon network every day at 5, and me and my friends watched every episode.  I also have fond memories of a few other shows that used to come on after Dragon Ball Z like Outlaw Star which is amazing as well.

I first heard about Death Note on a forum post in reddit, and I decided to give it a try.  The first episode was good, but didn't really get me that interested, but then after the plot got really rolling in episode 2, this became an addiction. Death Note is the story of a Teenager who discovers a book, and it has the power to kill anyone whose name is written in it.  He soon becomes the most wanted man in the world, and is hunted by a computer hacker genius named L.

Death Note is the Breaking Bad of Anime.  Both shows feature a protagonist with questionable morals, who just keep digging their own graves deeper and deeper as the show goes on.  The only complaint I have about Death Note is that there is a shocking twist about 2/3rd's of the way through that almost ruins the show. I really think the show should have ended right there, but it keeps going, but it becomes a lot less interesting.  Even with that flaw, I still gave it a five out of five because the show is just that good.

Obviously anime is an acquired taste, and this show is not for everyone.  There are some daemons and fantasy elements that may not be of interest to some people, but you really should give it a chance and watch the first few episodes at least.",1531958400,,1675,4.148606811145511

8678362,5,B00NI4DOW6,"When it comes to anime from a westerner's perspective, Death Note is typically one of the names that pops up to both the uninitiated and experienced enthusiasts alike. Both the suspense and mystery prove particularly enticing through its 39-episode length. I could pick apart the series a good deal here, but I'll condense it for those skeptical or unsure: it's great, riveting, and well-produced, though unfortunately the story suffers in the final third of episodes. This selection is very controversial among Death Note fans, which can be considered a hopeful note since you might actually find yourself in the camp that isn't too bothered by the changes. Nevertheless, keep this in mind, but don't let it prevent you from enjoying what is one of the best anime from its time.

Moving onto the set itself, there's not a whole lot to say other than it's well made, high quality, and chock full of several extras and special features such as commentary episodes, behind-the-scenes footage, textless credits, and multi-lingual audio. Some sets you will pay upwards of double the price for half of what you get with this bundle, so good on the producers for treating the fans right.

If you're not familiar with anime and are interested in perhaps giving this series a shot: please do so. Buy this set, and you more likely than not will be satisfied with your purchase and hopefully find yourself introduced to such a fantastic medium of creative expression and entertainment.

8678364,5,B00NI4DOW6,"Given the power to kill anyone with just the swift stroke of a pen, would you do it? Would you have the desire to play God or should that power be allowed to no one? Death Note, an anime released between 2006 and 2007 (based off the manga released between 2003 and 2006, which was written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by Takeshi Obata), ponders these questions for a bit with its intriguing premise, but what makes this series so special isn't that it tries to answer age-old philosophical questions  in fact, it doesnt really try to, it just sets them up for the viewer to ponder. No, what makes this series so special is its ability to make the audience constantly sucked into the events going on, whether its as tense and nerve-wrecking as a scene where a father threatens to kill his own son or as simple as a tennis match between two newly-acquainted friends  not many shows can make the audience intrigued by such simple set-ups. The series has many strengths going for it, but I believe that its main drawing power is its ability to pull the audience in, but like any great show, it has more than one thing going for it.

 Firstly, the characters are superb. The main character, Light Yagami, is a 17-year-old high school genius who doesnt have much going on in his life, until a Shinigami (God of Death) decides to quench his own thirst for excitement by dropping a Death Note into the human realm  as we are constantly reminded, any human whose name is written in this notebook will die. Of course, Light finds this notebook (spoilers for episode one to continue) and, as the Shinigami Ryuk claims, it was just by chance  it wasn't fate or destiny, just luck that this random kid found it. What really took me by surprise me about this opening episode is that instead of spending a great deal of time focusing on Lights internal confliction about whether or not to use this godly power, he makes up his mind rather quickly; he will root out evil and become the God of a new world of justice. Its rather shocking at how quickly he makes up his mind, but that ends up being one of the best parts about the series, because as I stated earlier, it doesnt want to spend time on the age-old philosophical questions that we have all heard. The show is really about the dynamic between Light, anonymously known as Kira after his killing becomes known throughout the world, and the worlds greatest detective who is determined to catch him: Batman!

 Actually, its not Batman  its some dude called L (as in the letter). We don't know much about this guy, just that he is known for his ability to solve every case thrown at him, but this is the crux that the entire show rests upon, this battle of wits between Kira and L. Who will win, the genius high schooler who is determined to make a world of justice through any means necessary, or the freak detective (with a penchant for sugary sweets) who is also hell-bent on winning? In most shows, you simply root for the protagonist and are usually pretty confident that they will win, but the writing of this show is so on-point (I watched it dubbed, but man is it a good dub!) that you totally believe that either of them could win. There aren't many evenly matched hero-villain combos that are quite this good, aside from maybe Batman and Joker in their various adaptations, but this show definitely has one of those combos. But another interesting aspect is that who should we really consider the villain in this? Sure, Light is the protagonist so, from that perspective, L would be the antagonist, but at the same time, Light is a murderer in the eyes of the law and we see a lot of the show through Ls thoughts, providing us with this dual perspective. I just love how the series handles this dynamic, as it constantly makes you think about what will or will not happen in the end  I finished this show in a couple weeks, but I couldn't imagine waiting a full week for every episode. It is just that captivating.

 Aside from the constant desire to always want to know what will happen next and its two great main characters, this show also succeeds in many other areas. There are quite a few side characters, who range from OK (but far from awful  like Misa) to cool (Watari) to pretty interesting (Lights father, the police chief). None of these characters hold a candle to our leads, but they help to flesh out the world of the show and provide some different angles to look at certain elements. Aizawa, for example, starts off as a seemingly simple cop, but eventually goes through one of the best character arcs in the show, and Matsuda also has some tense moments as well (and hes seen by many as the fool of the group). Its not the greatest cast of characters in the world, but they are pretty good and Ill be remembering them for years to come. (Also, L is one of my all-time favorite characters, ever, and Alessandro Juliani does a fantastic job with his voicework in the dub  nothing short of excellence from him.)

 It should be noted (no pun intended) that although this show involves Shinigami and a mystical notebook, it is very much grounded in realism, or as realistic as you can get with those qualifiers. I liked to compare it to Batman (again)  obviously, hes far from a realistic superhero, but for the genre that he is a part of, he is certainly more realistic than an alien from another planet being raised by farmers. Because of this semi-realistic approach to the series, one might be inclined to wonder why it being an anime benefits the story it tells at all. Simple: Madhouse, the animation team behind this, is amazing for providing beautiful visuals and stunning animation for even the simplest scenes. Light is about to write in the notebook, you say? Lets have him whip that pen in the coolest way possible when he does it, with the swiftest arm motion possible! Someone is clearly nervous with the present-situation? Lets see those drops of sweat pour down their face! Madhouse is wonderful at providing detail to what many could see as scenes that don't deserve it, but they make sure to give it their all. Not to mention, theyve also done a wonderful job with utilizing color throughout the series. Whenever Light goes into Kira-mode, his hair and eyes change to a reddish color (not in-universe, mind you, but just for the audience to see) and it provides a great visual cue for us to see that hes planning something or something is about to go down. Fun Tidbit: Light not only changes color when this happens, but his face also gets more angular, which is similar to how Saitama (the One-Punch Man) gets angular facial features when he goes into his full-on serious hero mode. I thought that was an interesting aspect to note, especially since I saw One-Punch Man first. But yeah, Madhouse is amazing and the show does a great job with maintaining its partial realism!

 That about covers everything that I wanted to mention with this show  its quite good and I would certainly recommend it to anyone who wants to see a show with beautiful animation, fascinating characters (L!), and an intriguing premise not bogged down by predictable questions. And I didn't even mention all the great aspects of the show (the music is great - the Kira theme that plays when people are dying from the notebook never gets old!). Is it perfect? No, but what show is? There are multiple points throughout the show where I just could not understand what was going on because of how much info-dumping there is (but this show makes info-dumping look good most of the time) and Im sure people have made a list of plot-holes in the show, but to me, thats just being pedantic. As a whole, the show is great from beginning to end and I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone with an open mind. Maybe it isn't the best anime ever created, but it would certainly serve as a great introduction for anyone who wants to get into that realm of entertainment. Its dark premise that never wavers from its original intentions provide the foundation for a show that constantly makes you question everything that is happening and who you should or shouldnt side with  and I wouldnt have it any other way.",1523664000,,8164,4.5590443686006825
