8229279,4,B000XRZ9HO,Solidly woven classics will always pass the time test. Fresh today means same in two years or two generations. My Father's Glory and its sequel are recommended in movie venue to family of all life ages. Target audience for youthful enrichment would be range of grade school age through sixth. Teachers of a mind set certainly expand on this in any direction. Viewers carry these memories forward to their families to come; joy with importance indeed.,1351036800,,450,4.934210526315789
8229280,5,B000XRZ9HO,"Wonderful two part story of a young French boy remembering some of his childhood experiences in southern France near Marseilles. Most of the story centers around his memories at the family's rented country cottage during several seasons around the year 1900. The focus centers on his father and mother, his aunt and her later husband who became his  ""Uncle Jules"". Added to this cast is his friendship  with a boy and soul mate he met during their country vacation. The movie throughout has so many tender touches of a gentle family life, all presented in a humorous and entertaining way. All characters are very believable and likable. Both movies are a French production with a French Cast, but with English dialog along with English Close Captioning.
It's a ""Making you Feel Good"" movie, that one gladly comes back to from time to time, when the impact of the previous viewing has somewhat faded. The two parts should be viewed in chronological order when viewed as a set, although each disk can stand on its own.",1322179200,,1016,4.8

8229282,5,B000XRZ9HO,"In 1990, writer director Yves Robert (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/War-of-the-Buttons-1994/dp/6303954294/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">War of the Buttons (1994)</a>)  adapted the delightful novels of Marcel Pagnol, ""The Glory of My Father"" and ""My Mother's Castle"" to critical acclaim for the big screen.  Too bad, that these two incredibly delightful films have still tended to remain a French mainstay.  Well now, both have been wonderfully transferred to DVD in all of their glory of an Era that has sadly slipped away, even from French Cinema.

""My Father's Glory"" and ""My Mother's Castle"" are two films, each dependent on the other, to tell the charming and almost idyllic childhood of successful novelist and film director Marcel Pagnol.  Both films are SO charming and warm and full of life and  detail about the childhood and family life of a schoolteacher and his family and extended family in 1900 Marseilles. ""Father"" is a man of the new age, atheistic, warm, beloved by all, adored by his wife, and mostly his son.  The first film details Marcel's idolizing of his Father and the family's Summer Vacation in the Hills of Provence.  The colour and cinematography are superlative, and the story is engrossing, infectious, warm and sun-drenched in humour and love.  The second film, ""My Mother's Castle"", commences at the end of the first and chronicles the amazing feat of the family as they return to their beloved Summer home and how they must sneak through wealthy estates (""Mother"" is particularly afraid of one castle along the canal). Each situation, each character, each camera shot, each actor is such perfection that it is impossible to sing the praises of such artistry any further.

Yes you read subtitles!!!  These films are absolutely worth the effort and the time!

These films CAN be found on VHS, formatted for television.",1209081600,8,2194,5.81875
