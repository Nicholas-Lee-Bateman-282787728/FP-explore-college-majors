5007237,5,B006NF0FME,"I have been looking for solutions to my neck and shoulder pain for many years.  I have tried acupuncture, deep tissue massage, yoga and other approaches.  But I haven't found anything that works for long.  Now, at last, I have.  I would like to thank Mary Bond for her DVD and the amazing way she has shown me how to address my posture and thereby my pain.  I don't have to go to a bodyworker or a class and spend huge amounts of money over many years.  I feel better with one DVD!  I have to admit that it isn't magic.  I do practice some each day.  But I don't mind when I can feel myself getting better and often pain-free.  I highly recommend this.",1335052800,19,652,4.144

Mary is a fabulous teacher.  She has created a truly unique set of experiences and exercises that are not boring or difficult -- and they work.  The program starts with a wonderful example of how posture is more than just putting your body in a particular position.  Then there are sections on finding your base of support (important for sitting posture), enhancing breath capacity, engaging your core, getting grounded, and using your arms.  (I tell you about my favorite exercises in this video.)  I highly recommend this program for people who want to have better posture and for any professional who teaches posture.

5007239,5,B006NF0FME,"I'm not a body worker or a health professional, so I initially wondered if the DVD would go deeper into concepts that would address health issues I might find difficult to process without a solid understanding of anatomy. I've found that with other books and DVD's that claim to offer body health solutions.

Instead Mary's DVD was a breath of fresh air, while her credentials are amazing and I know she teaches health professionals, physical therapists, etc....where I think she shines is in communicating in very easy to understand, layman terms. Bravo!

Finally, someone who really stands a chance at actually making a difference in people's lives by telling it to us straight and helping us understand the inner workings of our bodies with illustrations and exercises we'll not soon forget. I recommend it and advise you take your time to absorb each chapter and integrate it into your daily routine. It won't require you do more work, just increase your sense of awareness in everything you already do.",1330646400,16,1007,4.952662721893491
5007240,5,B006NF0FME,"This DVD is the best thing on posture I've seen out there, and I have LOOKED. I've had shoulder and neck strain for years from playing a musical instrument and from hours at a computer. I'd always heard people talk about posture as ""sitting up straight"" or ""putting your shoulders back"" or ""tucking your pelvis under"" (not to knock Tai Chi or yoga, but those practices are not ""practical"" for living your life in the real world).  The way Mary Bond talks about posture gets you thinking about how you USE your body, not just how you look when you happen to catch yourself in the mirror.  She helps you figure out ways to EXPERIENCE yourself differently, which then leads to your wanting more of the ease that comes from tuning in.  The sitting lesson, for example, immediately gives you the feeling of the difference between sitting on different parts of your 'sit bones' and the way to ease strain in your shoulders and neck.  WHODATHOUGHT?  This lady knows her stuff.  I want to give this DVD as Christmas presents to all my friends, but it's Valentine's Day.  A perfect gift of love.",1329091200,20,1086,4.595854922279793

8501354,5,B006NF0FME,"Heal Your Posture: A 7 week workshop has helped me so much!! I just received it two weeks ago and am very excited about the wealth of activities and new awareness it provides. As a bodyworker informed by structural integration, I use Mary's activities to help my clients strengthen their understanding of their body, rediscover their underlying strength, power, and balance, and to help them maintain the work we've done. I've had the honor of being Rolfed by Mary, and each time I see her she sends me home with another activity to do that demonstrates a more balanced, centered, and conscious way of moving and being. Many of these activities are in the DVD, and can truly revolutionize our somatic experience of ourselves. Cannot recommend it enough. Mary's teaching style demonstrates her curiosity, respect, and reverence for movement. The DVD is easily understood by lay people, but complex enough to inform advanced practitioners. The DVD is well matched with The New Rules of Posture, as I bounce back and forth between the two. Thanks Mary!",1370217600,3,1049,4.965909090909091

8501356,1,B006NF0FME,"Talking in slow motion.  The DVD will challenge your attention span.  You need a lot of patience just to get to the end of this video.  If there was something useful it was hard for me to catch. $49.95 down the drain.  This top price should be a red flag....But do not get me wrong: Mary Bond is certainly well  meaning.  She wants to improve not only your posture, but also your breathing, back, feet, core,  performance, and more.

8501357,5,B006NF0FME,"As far as fundamentals of movement, this is well substantiated.
However, I found it stiffly, and so boringly, presented.  I think it
is far overpriced.",1359072000,5,151,5.04
8501358,5,B006NF0FME,"Rolf Movement Instructor Mary Bond has a gift for relating ideas on functional ease in movement to daily life, offering ways to practice whether at dinner, while brushing your teeth, changing a light bulb, or standing in line . She did this in her book The New Rules of Posture: How to Sit, Stand, and Move in the Modern World (Healing Arts Press, 2006; now also available as an ebook), and she offers more in her recently released DVD Heal Your Posture: A 7-Week Workshop with Mary Bond, which I consider an invaluable resource for both Rolfers and our clients .

For practitioners with less Rolf Movement training, the DVD gives a great overview of how to pull things together in a session using movement cues and suggestions, while demonstrating how to do session-directed imagery and very light hands-on tactile aid with clients . For those with more movement background, it helps synthesize, integrate, and clarify what can be a dizzying wealth of movement information . By her example, Bond shows us how to talk to clients about movement: how to check in with them, put them at ease, get a feel for their level of embodiment, and put things into terms that relate to their everyday lives . Sparkling and affable, she makes it all look easy .

At the beginning she asks, ""when is your posture the best?"" She then asks participants to experience it, not talk about it . Great advice to clients and Rolfers alike, I believe . Bond likens the experience of ""good posture"" to that of greeting your most trusted friend: ""Feels good right?"" Posture, then, is seen as a response, not just a position . The DVD sometimes refers to passages in The New Rules of Posture, and asks us to re-read parts of it . This could be challenging to some, and inviting for others . For clients wishing to reinforce work done in session, or just explore things on their own, it could be part of an optimal educational experience. Among the many juicy bits of information and beautiful examples of how one could address the whole body through movement work are a discussion of the pelvic floor in a seated position (includes the oft-asked: ""how should I sit in a chair at the office?"") and strategies/demonstrations for movement work ranging from breathing in relation to the feet to the elusive notion of `core support' and maintaining appropriate
lumbar curve .

Bond clearly knows how to connect with people while delivering top-notch concepts . For example, she discusses connecting a sense of posture with the sense of self in relation to `what's going on .' She mentions her `second rule,' paraphrased as follows: Posture is always a response to the questions ""Where am I?"", ""What's happening?"", and ""Am I safe?"" Depending on one's answers, there is the potential to lose the sense of spatial or weight orientation, or both . The ideal, then, is to adapt to `what's going on' by improving this orienting activity . I noticed that throughout the DVD Bond is careful to give spatial as well as weight-oriented cues, which is useful to catch the attention of viewers who are more ground-oriented, as well as those who are more sky- oriented . In all of the segments, she offers good positional and imagistic variety for clients to model .

Though coming from a place of deep study, experience, and complexity of understanding, Bond's approach is extremely practical, whether for a Rolfer or a client . She elegantly demonstrates a way of working with feet, using materials readily available from the hardware store, to awaken the ""magical powers in the cuboid bone"" to help a client find the stabilizing portion of the foot - a wonderful lesson for folks with collapsed arches!
Her explanations, demonstrations of gentle hands-on work, and directed imagery to deepen the message are brilliantly simple and clearly build one on the other, like a slowly building musical fugue .

The DVD has wonderful animated graphics, notably those depicting the motions of the spine while breathing in a supine position with feet on the wall . These really enhanced my mind/body connection with the material presented . I also liked that the clients in the video are both men and women, and that much of the informational aspects are conveyed through client/practitioner dialogue . Though clearly very `scripted' in tone, these both deepen understanding and show us a model for interaction with clients using these movement ideas in session . A handy thing about the segmented DVD format: you can pause it and go do something that helps you process the information - like watching the segment on breathing, then pausing to wash dishes while noticing your breath at the same time . Bond's is a nice voice to have in your head, one that will actually help you live with more grace and ease .
