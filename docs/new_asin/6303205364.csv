597119,5,6303205364,This Movie is so funny I cold watch it everyday and still laugh my head off! If you haven't seen this movie I recomend it to anyone who needs a good laugh!,1029628800,2,155,3.875
597120,5,6303205364,"We watched this movie for last eight years,ever since our twin daughters were little. To this day,they find it an absolute theraphy,no matter how they,or us,feel. It never dates and rates with the Griswald's as Must Watch every XMas.
Get it. It was great to be able to buy our own copy through Amazon.",1028592000,,301,4.592592592592593
597121,5,6303205364,"This is most definitly one of the funniest movies ever. Martin Short plays Clifford, a little boy who goes to visit his Uncle Martin (Charles Grodin) in L.A. When Uncle Martin promises to take Clifford to Dinosaur World, and then breaks his promise, Clifford does everything he can to make his Uncle's life a living hell. Clifford's mission is to get to Dinosaur World (""The only place where a boy like me can be happy..."") and he will stop at nothing to get there!!! HILARIOUS!
I highly recommend this film.
*If you are thinking about showing this to kids, I'd recommend it for ages 10 and up. It is rated PG, but there is one scene of brief nudity, so parental guidence would probably be a good thing.",1016496000,3,703,4.5
597122,5,6303205364,"Clifford is the funniest movie I've ever seen in my life.  Martin Short is hilarious.  However, I recommend this movie for people who can stand obnoxious behavior.  Nearly everyone I know hates this movie because it is so frustratingly obnoxious.  I love immature humor, though, and I rent it constantly and never stop laughing.",1012435200,2,328,5.018518518518518

Though not many people know about it, I must say it is one of those movies you can watch over and over and it's still funny. I've loved it since I was in the 5th grade and now that I'm about graduated, I still find it humorous. I so recommend it. I promise you will not be disappointed.",1010188800,3,383,3.923076923076923

When uncle Martin breaks his promise to Clifford to take him to Dinosaur World thats win the fun begins...He makes a fool of his uncle in every way and the funny thing is he seems so innocent..Clifford will get to Dinosaur World by 'Any Means Neccassary'.,1001289600,2,476,4.482758620689655

597238,3,6303205364,"Nothing to do with the big red dog character that is one of the alternative DVDs on the product page, 1994's Clifford is about an uncle trying to convince his fiance that he really does like and want to have kids, jumping at the chance to look after his ten year old nephew that he hasn't seen since he was a baby.  Clifford however is a brat, and once you become his enemy (ie don't take him to Dinosaur World like you promised) he will set out to humiliate and ruin you.  The main gag of this one is that a ten year old is played by an obviously adult actor in 40 year old at the time Martin Short who just wears a private school AC/DC type uniform the whole movie, and has his hair ruffled by every adult he comes across.  He does get up to some serious mischief such as getting his uncle arrested, but they are all pretty lame compared to similar bad kid movies with actual child actors playing children.  Still it's entertaining enough to pass the time, it's just nothing special. You can understand why this sat on the studios shelf for four years before being released in 1994 and you've probably never heard of it.  The Dinosaur World ride at the end looks like where all the money went, I have to admit that ride looks cooler than any ride I've ever been on at an amusement park.",1484611200,,1288,4.240816326530612

Martin Short and Charles Grodin have an amazing chemistry on screen. Every antic Clifford commits, his uncle Martin is right there to rub his face in it. Clifford does some of the most outrageous things to get his way and it is hilarious. By the end of the film, Uncle Martin unhinges a bit and gives Clifford a taste of his own medicine.

I can watch this movie any day of the week. It is extremely quotable and the performances are very solid for such a under the radar movie. Highly recommended if you can turn off your brain for an hour and laugh at a grown man playing a 10 year old boy.",1429488000,,758,4.220689655172414

597676,5,6303205364,"Martin Short, the adult actor, plays a pre-teen problem child in this comedy. Clifford's uncle is trying to convince a would-be fiance that he wants kids, which carries the plot-line as Clifford is a nephew from hell, but his uncle can't complain without looking like the bad guy. The humor in this movie is weird to say the least. My siblings and I watched this a lot growing up and when we try to show it to people in adulthood we get very mixed reactions. Most people find it funny, but say at some point how weird it is. Clifford's vocabulary and diction is not typical of a kid. He says stuff like, ""Thank you ever so kindly"" and while hyperventilating, cries out, ""A whole gang of chocolate! I need it badly!"". When his uncle picks him up at the airport, he pretends to be sleeping, and upon waking as if from a nightmare shouts, ""Don't reject me!"" This is part of what makes the movie funny, because his uncle is totally weirded out and no one else seems to catch Clifford in all of his manipulative weirdness. Generally, people who like Martin Short or humor like Chevy Chase's or Steve Martin's (sarcastic quips, goofy facial expressions) will like this movie. Moving a generation forward, the weird factor of this movie is similar to Billy Madison, so if you were a fan of that movie, you'd probably like this (more family friendly) movie. The extremity to which this ""kid"" goes to get his way, and the creepy stuff he says, work for the movie because the ""child"" is actually an adult actor. If a real child had been cast in this movie, it would have been in poor taste and really uncomfortable. Just one example is the brief scene where he explains that he knows what a ""rug"" is because his teacher used to wear a hair piece. Clifford says he and the other kids would play with it at recess and follows up with ""Miss Gathercole, the art teacher, used to borrow it too...That would be for different reasons..."" and glances sideways at his uber creeped out uncle. If an actual ten year old actor said that line it would be really really off, but Martin Short pulls off such a funny character. Everyone I've watched this with has gotten a laugh out of it, so it seems to appeal to a broad audience. Definitely worth a watch!",1410998400,2,2232,4.459657701711492

597679,2,6303205364,"This is one strange little film. A major flop when released in 1994 (after sitting on the shelf for 4 years), ""Clifford"" has garnered a bit of a cult following. One look at the plethora of rave reviews right here on Amazon acknowledges that fact. As much as I love the cast, I'm jealous that I just can't jump on the bandwagon. ""Clifford"" is assuredly not a good movie; but it's undeniably watchable and often entertaining.
  The by-the-numbers direction doesn't factor into that, nor does the bizarre script. Does Clifford (Martin Short) actually have a heart of gold under his Damien-like exterior? Does the film itself want to be a nasty, biting satire or a feel good family flick? It seems that nobody in charge of production knew those answers. However, that doesn't affect the comedic all-star cast. Short, famous for his sketch comedy talents seen on 'Saturday Night Live' and 'SCTV', plays a 10 year old brat who's too precocious for words...and has a destructive mean streak. The talented Mr. Short isn't everyone's cup of tea, admittedly; if you are a fan, you'll appreciate how he single-handedly creates an amusing character out of a poorly written script.
  Thankfully, ""Clifford""'s producers got the casting part right. The best evidence of which is Short's co-star, that brilliant King of the Slow Burn, Charles Grodin. A few years before this was made, the far superior ""Midnight Run"" introduced Grodin to the masses. So instead of being a highly respected but somewhat neglected character actor, the majority of the country's film-goers were always ready and willing for some Chuck. ""Clifford"" is certainly no ""Heartbreak Kid"", but any movie that casts the riotous Grodin in a starring role must have some brains behind the scenes. And as always, he's hilarious playing to type as the beleagured Uncle trying to deal with his horrific newly-arrived nephew. Mary Steenburgen has the relatively thankless role as Grodin's finacee, too dim to see the pitchfork and horns behind young Clifford's halo. She does as much as possible, though, and looks absolutely gorgeous. And as an always reliable safety valve, Dabney Coleman plays a variation of his usual persona: arrogant, salacious, wealthy, and likeable despite himself due to Coleman's skill and charisma.
  It's not possible for me to recommend ""Clifford""; but if you find yourself up late, and it's starting up....why not?",1396051200,,2393,5.076335877862595

On the other hand, I think of the Martin Short movie; I recently replaced my old VHS copy with a DVD, so my family can enjoy it over and over. Short plays the title character - an obnoxious, ingeniously wicked, self-centered brat - who wreaks havoc in the lives of his parents, his unfortunate Uncle Martin, and anyone else who dares cross his path. Clifford has his mind and heart set on going to Dinosaur World, and woe be unto anyone who gets in his way. Clifford turns his Uncle's life into a nightmare, alienating him from his fiancee, getting him falsely accused of a bomb threat, and making him out to be a buffoon at a dinner party. Oh yes, Clifford learns his lesson the hard way when he pushes Uncle Martin too far. There are certain scenes in the movie my family looks forward to even though we know they're coming. I highly recommend this one!",1224547200,,939,4.402298850574713

Martin Short(Clifford)is obsessed with going to Dinosaur World, which is where his uncle(Charles Grodin)works.  Clifford is extremely annoying to his uncle, who asks, ""Why can't you act like a normal boy?""  Clifford has a small toy dinosaur who he confides in as a sort of alter-ego.  He calls the toy Stefan.  If you want to see a movie that will have you bursting at the seams, buy this movie.  You won't be disappointed!

598159,4,6303205364,"""Clifford"" was ready for release in 1991 but it's distributor, Orion, was on the verge of bankruptcy.  Despite the box office and critical success of ""Dances With Wolves"" and with ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey"" in the can Orion made too many blunders.  Being Woody Allen's distributor probably didn't put any money in the coffers.  ""Love Field"" with Michelle Pfeiffer and this film collected dust until the court matters could be settled.  When ""Clifford"" was finally released theatrically in 1994 it was savaged by the critics and ignored by the public.  I never thought too much about this movie until a critic for ""Entertainment Weekly"" named it as a guilty pleasure.  By happenstance I came across the film at a local video store when they were liquidating their stock.  To be frank I was expecting ""Problem Child"" but ""Clifford"" is more akin to ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure"".  Credit the comic mastery of Martin Short for finding within the rotten kid he is playing some endearing qualities.  It also helps that Short has great reparte with Charles Grodin as his harried Uncle Martin.  With those unfamiliar with Grodin it would behoove them to check out his work with Robert DeNiro in the underrated ""Midnight Run"".  Mary Steenburgen is wasted, though, in the stock girlfriend role.  Great script that has consistently funny gags and lines.  Why didn't this film find it's audience in 1994?  Probably because they marketed it as a family film which it definitely isn't because there are too many risque elements in it.

I'm not a --huge-- fan of Martin Short but I do get a kick out of most of his antics, and considering myself a heterosexual male, I'll openly admit I don't think I've ever been attracted to a man as much as Charles Grodin (in a completely non-sexual way). Thus, it's that much more disheartening that this movie always works at barely working... It never crosses the line into complete debauchery, but it rides it with the type of hard-headed stubbornness Short's Clifford exudes.

Grodin goes as psycho as he can in the midst of a demon child considering it's a PG rated flick (and it'd never get away with a PG rating these days... it's too twisted), and it's always mildly amusing, but their dynamic just isn't that funny, sad to say. Short's Clifford, likewise, is curiously nasty and perverse (with his obvious sexual fancy for Steenburgen -- just look at that face whenever he's around her), but his exuberance in bringing this unique spawn to fruition rarely hits the the funny mark.

Maybe it's just me. Maybe it's not.  I'm a fan of most the people involved in this disaster, but none of their real strengths are overly apparent. Even still, while I readily admit I don't find 'Clifford' too much of a riot myself, I won't put those off who find it delectable... If nothing else, 'Clifford' is unique.

First of all there is barely a special effect to make Martin Short appear to be a [...]old other than the fact that he's always photographed half the size than everyone else. (mainly by sitting lower) No CGI here. I find this hilarious.  Clifford is also a twisted sugar freak who will do anything to get what he wants.  My favorite aspect of Mr. Short's performance is the face he makes everytime he tips the audience that he's about to do something insane.  It is that priceless expression that always makes me want to show others this movie.  Charles Grodin and Mary Steenburgen make a great supporting cast but this is Short's tour de force.  I don't know a lot of people who've seen Clifford but it seems like it should have a cult following.

The boy just about puts his uncle in the funny farm with frustration and rage from the boy's pranks.  It is truly funny to see this little boy win this struggle over the accomplished adult.  Charles Grodin is fabulous at expressing the frustration over the boy's immaturity, scheming and selfishness.  But you know, even through the conflict, you can see that Uncle Martin really does like the boy.

Maybe you would have to have a 8 year and a 10 year boy to understand this movie.

The plot is set up splendidly from the beginning, where the boy wants to stay with Uncle Martin because Uncle Martin promised to take the boy to Dinosaur Land, and Uncle Martin wants the boy at his house so he can convince his finance that he truly loves children so he can save his engagement to Miss Sarah.  Uncle Martin gets a rush project at work and cancels the Dinosaur Land trip, and then the boy begins to plot against his uncle to punish his uncle.  That's when the fun gets going.  The boy makes an absolute fool of his uncle in a bunch of scenes, gets his uncle thrown in jail and nearly ruins his uncle's engagement to the sweet Miss Sarah.

Of course, all is well that ends well, and Uncle Martin and Sarah get married, with the boy as ring bearer.",1106611200,,1462,4.338235294117647

The entire cast blends perfectly. The laughs are hysterical and classic. We quote lines from this movie regularly in our household. I am laughing just thinking about this movie. I was surprised to see negative reviews but there are some people out there who lack imagination and a sense of humor.

This movie is about crazy Clifford(Martin Short), whos father gets in a dilema while on his way to Hawaii for a busimess trip. Hoping he will get some peace from his menace of a son , Clifford's father decides to call his brother Martin(Charles Grodin)in Los Angles, to watch him while he is on his business trip. Not knowing the torture that awaits him, Martin happily watches over Clifford. But he soon realizes that Clifford is a crazy, out of control menace, whos only thought is about going to Dinosaur World ( an amusement park he has always dreamed of going to.) In the end, Clifford and Martin gain a mutual respectfor each other. This is a great comedy for the whole family. A must see.",1102464000,,776,4.433566433566433
598256,5,6303205364,I have WAITED and WAITED for this movie. My family has said it was a sick obsession and that no way would this obscure movie make its way onto DVD; so glad they are wrong. This movie is an instant pick-me-up and never fails to put a smile on my face! It was this movie that made me fall in love with Martin Short and decide that he could be funny doing anything! It isn't a movie for everyone...my family doesn't quite understand why I have tears running down my face from laughing so hard but for those who do get it....this is pure genius. CLifford and Stefan's adventure is a timeless classic in my book!,1100736000,2,607,4.241379310344827

598258,5,6303205364,"The idiot who claimed the DVD version was edited, needs to lay off the funny stuff !!! Ok, So I was the irate poster of ""WARNING: MGM DVD BUTCHERS CLIFFORD !!!""  I am writing this to retract that previous post.  After purchasing a used copy of ""Clifford"" on VHS, I was baffled to find the same exact version as that on my DVD version, missing the same exact scenes I had complained about being ""deleted"" from the DVD release.  After doing research on the internet, and searching Yahoo, using ""Clifford"" and the exact lines I had remembered seeing in ""Clifford"", as televised on Comedy Central, I came upon this info at IMDB: [...]
The hysterical scenes I had seen (and loved) are only available in the televised version of ""Clifford"".  These were excluded from the final print in the original Theatre release, and all following home video releases.  I had only ever seen ""Clifford"" on Comedy Central, but watched it at least ten times on TV over the years.  The scenes that were cut are stil gems, and flow with the story perfectly. (For example ... The scene where Clifford's Father asks Clifford where he got his walkman from at the airport ...  ""You Stole It Didn't You !?  My God, Is There No End To Your Madness !?"" ... proceeding that, was the scene where Clifford, on the televised version, had posed as a Deaf Child, with a sign around his neck, to collect money ... after being outed by a woman who speaks sign language, Clifford is seen in a store purchasing the Walkman in question with the money he had collected ... ""No, a kindly old priest gave it to me, Da."")  I wish the producers of this movie hadn't edited them.  They were great.  Oh well.  Check out the above link I have provided if you are interested.  So the blame is no longer on MGM DVD.  For Those familiar with Clifford only from the Theater and Video Rentals .... BUY AWAY !!!  It's the same movie you know and love ... and still one of the bestest movies in the whole wide world.  So disregard my previous post.  To quote Clifford:
""I don't like those men, Miss Sarah.  They're Liars. And everybody knows that liars eventually get caught ...""

598319,1,6303205364,"Once again, MGM/UA delivers us a full-screen only release.  Most other studios actually give you double-sided discs with full screen and widescreen to appease both camps.  Stick it to MGM... Clifford is an hysterical black comedy, but they won't get my sale... like they lost me on Remo Williams and Real Men.  WAKE UP, MGM.",1079740800,8,324,4.8545454545454545
598320,3,6303205364,"Clifford (1994) was directed by Paul Flaherty, who also directed Who's Harry Crumb? (1989) and was a writer for SCTV, for which Martin Short appeared on, and also wrote for numerous other of Short's projects, finally sees a DVD release...sort of...the film stars Martin Short as the title character Clifford, a manipulative ten-year-old boy infatuated with dinosaurs and a theme park called Dinosaur World.  Charles Grodin plays Clifford's Uncle Martin, and Mary Steenburgen is Martin's fiance Sarah Davis.

It seems Clifford's Uncle Martin and Sara are having problems in that Sara wants to start a family right away, but Martin doesn't seem serious about it.  Then Martin sees an opportunity to show Sara how great he is with children by taking in his nephew Clifford for a week.  Clifford, wanting to go to Dinosaur World so badly gets his Uncle Martin to promise to take him, but Uncle Martin must break the promise due to a deadline he must meet for his work.  This sets Clifford off in that he creates pranks, simple and elaborate, to get back at his uncle for lying to him.  You see, Clifford is extremely intelligent, cunning, obsessive, and pure evil, in the way a ten-year-old boy can be, especially one who doesn't get what he wants.

The chemistry between Grodin and Short is really very good, the two battling wits and Grodin's character never quite realizing the depth of the boy's ruthlessness until it's too late.  Short is creepily convincing as a ten year old boy out for revenge for not getting what he wanted, basically ruining his uncle's personal and professional life in a few, short days.  There are a number of truly funny scenes and dialogue throughout the movie, and it's quite entertaining.  Grodin plays a role he has basically perfected over the years, a straight-laced character in unusual and exasperating situations.

I was disappointed with this release in that it was only available in a full screen format.  Also, there was a notable lack of special features, the disc only containing a trailer for the film.  I wasn't looking for like ten hours of stuff, but maybe some production notes, or a look at some of Martin Shorts other projects.  Another reviewer has stated that some scenes are missing from the original release, but I am not sure if that is true as I haven't seen this film in a long time, but it does run 90 minutes which matches the what the IMDb has listed as a running time.

598321,4,6303205364,"As far as the movie goes, this one's a classic. Martin Short plays an amazing role as a 10 year old boy who terrorizes his Uncle. But it's partially due to his Uncle's putting his priorities in the wrong place. He delays Clifford's trip to Dinosaur World. The whole idea behind the movie is hilarious, and the comedic bits are overwhelmingly funny. However, It has been rumoured, only by someone on this site, that there are multiple scenes that have been cut out of the DVD. I decided to email MGM about this, and they have yet to return my email. Still waiting for confirmation on this, but I'm dreaded that it might in fact be true. I never thought Clifford would come to DVD, and then I saw Charles Grodin on David Letterman, and he asked ""So is this Clifford on DVD."" And he's like, 'Oh yes, yes, Clifford's on DVD, it's everywhere.' So I went to check and there It had just come out 4 days prior. I was shocked that one of the bestest movies of all time had finally arrived, but now am more shocked that they may have deleated beloved scenes from this film. Hoping this rumour is false, but I don't know why it would be out there in the first place if it wasn't. Sadness.
Oh yea, it would get 5 stars if it wasn't for this whole scenes deal. But if you haven't grown to love them already, then you won't be disappointed if they're not there, so go buy Clifford.",1078876800,3,1367,4.281853281853282
