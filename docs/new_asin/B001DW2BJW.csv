3540802,5,B001DW2BJW,"This is an excellent set of DVDs that compares  movies about crooks, and cops, and the actual people and events they represent. Lots of footage from the movies and quite a bit of factual information. One of my favorites, ""The Law Gang-AKA the FBI"", is based on the movie ""G Men"", and J. Edgar Hoovers""s FBI. It more or less affirms the contention that sometines the only  difference between the crooks and the cops is that the cops wear a badge, or in some cases,  an evening gown, although that bit of information was not disclosed in the segment. All in all, this collection is a great value for the money. Very good quality picture and sound.",1231891200,3,645,4.495726495726496

3540869,3,B001DW2BJW,"The overall rating of this DVD set is somewhat limited by the source material which is being reviewed. And film review programs are only so good themselves.

The soundtrack is by new age composer David Arkenstone who has a flair for the dramatic and I wanted to note this. The music he composed here is appropriate for the material and often has an ominous tone. It is very well done and does add a touch of class; also shows that the producers were not just turning out quick shoddy product. They did their best to make quality shows.",1422403200,,535,4.459183673469388

3540872,5,B001DW2BJW,"I've read some of the 2 star reviews and get the point, but it is not that big of a deal.  Sure, Buchalter called it the Committee, but nobody else did.  LOL.  They were Murder Incorporated, period.  The only annoying thing was the same 3 minute clip before each new story.  Besides that, they should have went into dept about the Mafia vs the KKK, and how the Mafia was used during the WWII.  Besides that, they cover a lot of ground and for the few bucks this DVD costs, it is an informative steal.",1392076800,,500,4.2105263157894735
3540873,5,B001DW2BJW,"This is an excellent documentary consisting of 3 Discs and 10 hours detailing the differences between the Hollywood Movies from the actual crimes of Organized crime during the 20th Century. I deals with a lot of the sccial issues and government banning things that the underworld was prepared to supply even though illegal.
Just as the period avter the Civil War until the end of the 1800's there is an overabundance of fiction and ledgend incorporated in the movies,books and magazines that make it separation fro what really happened,virtually impossible to sort out.
 These DVD's do a very good jobof it ,using parts from movies as well as the media to show the fiction vs truth. It is very well constructed and the quality is excellent.
 There are several other Reviews that cover pretty much what to expect in the DVD's,so there's no need for my repeting.
 An aside,the bosses,and families still exist in organized crime in the US as well as here in Canada.
 Yesterday December 30,2012, saw the massive gangster style funeral in Montreal of Vito Rizzuto .For the 3rd time in just over 4 years,the main Italian church hosted a funeral for Canada's reputed first family of Mafia power. A cortege of 11 limousines followed the hearse carrying the body of Vito Rizzuto,the multilingual don who ran an international crime syndicate that frustrated Canadian law enforcement for decades. Nicknamed Montreal's Teflon don for his ability to avoid incarceration,he was finally nabbed by U.S.  law inforcement for his role in a triple 1981 Mob  murder. His son and father were murdered during the 6 years he spent in prisn. He returned to Canada in 2012 and the bodies started to pile up. 6 rivals were shot and one was poisoned with cyanide. At the time of his sudden death at 69,he had regained control. The story will undoubtedly continue...",1388448000,,1838,4.893890675241158

3540875,3,B001DW2BJW,"Hollywood vs. the Mob, 2008 DVD

This set of three DVDs claims to present ""fact vs. fiction"". But Hollywood produces drama and entertainment, if you want history read a good book. ""Little Caesar"" was the first gangster movie from Hollywood that presented the story from the gangster's viewpoint. The ""mafia"" was based on the historic feudal system. Patronage is well-known in business and politics. [The 1920 census showed more people living in cities than on rural farms. The ""closing of the frontier""?] Mobs seem to be based on large urban cities rather than small rural towns (where they are known as ""gangs""). The ""Five Points"" area in Manhattan had a bad reputation since the Civil War; they were destroyed as part of ""urban renewal"" around 1950. The commentary explains how this movie was based on true crime history. [Any good drama is best based on actual events.]

This DVD doesn't tell how organized crime was used in strike-breaking (instead of private agencies), newspaper circulation wars, and other business rivalries. Note how one gang takes over another like some competitive business. That mayor of Chicago was a friend to organized crime. [Don't Big Corporations control the political system in Big Cities?] Using a movie as an example seems flawed because it is fiction and not history. Prohibition in 1920 offered opportunities for entrepreneurs to provide desired consumer goods. The 1921 recession caused problems for ordinary people. Why did the Chicago elite hobnob with criminals? Shared interests? The 1932 film ""Scarface"" featured the tommygun. [An early message movie?] The tommygun was invented by a Brigadier General of the Army to provide a useful tool for close-range combat. It was bought by the Post Office (guarding the mails), the Coast Guard (defense against smugglers), and local police departments. The military version in WW II proved quite useful to Commandos and others. Why was there ""lawlessness"" in the ""Roaring Twenties""? Why was the government indifferent to gang rule in the cities? Who benefitted/

Many of those gangsters were born or raised in this country (of recent immigrants). The XVIII Amendment was followed by the rise of organized crime. [A copy of the business corporations and cartels of society?] Banning the sale of alcohol did not lead to less crime and more prosperity as promised because it mis-diagnosed the problems of society. Harsh working conditions led to ""industrial drinking"". Saloons were the meeting places for working men. The shooting of Dino in ""Scarface"" is like from some opera or play. Was it based on the Borgia family? Is there room in this country for such types? [One book explained why tommyguns were sought by the mob: there was no law against their possession by anyone. Illinois legislatures received campaign contributions to keep it that way.]

I think this set would have been better if it contained the complete films used in these DVDs. The explanatory commentary would not have to be repeated. Movies are dramatic entertainment, even if based on true events. If the Great Depression caused a crime wave in the 1930s what caused the crime wave of the 1920s? [They don't tell the Great Depression created the Stock Market crash of October 1929, not the other way around. Just look at current events for proof.] FDR gave Hoover and the FBI greater powers. Originally the Secret Service (as it name implies) was in charge of counter-espionage since the Civil War. That changed in the 1930s because the Secret Service (part of the Treasury Department) investigated Senators and Congressmen and sent them to jail for various crimes (as in today's world). Warner Brothers made many movies ""ripped from the headlines"". They are often worth watching today (such as ""High Sierra""). Stories based on true crimes seem better than one derived from a writer's imagination. The nine movies are on three discs: 1) Little Caesar, 2) The Public Enemy, 3) Scarface; 4) G Men, 5) Marked Woman, 6) Loan Shark; 7) The Black Godfather, 8) The Purple Gang, 9) honor Thy Father.",1342828800,,4049,5.065967016491754
3540876,2,B001DW2BJW,"If you know anything concerning the history and the bio's of the criminals covered here you'll discover that the narrator constantly make comments that are false.  It's almost like he doesn't know what he's talking about.  They're just minor technicial mistakes but True Crime fans with knowkedge on the subject might find it annoying.  For example when he states Lucky Luciano's real name he gets that wrong.  Then he says the Luciano and Lansky called their paid killers ""Murder Inc."" which is incorrect.  The press labeled the killers as ""Murder Inc."" and from what I studied they refered to themselves as ""The Combination"".  That said, you still might enjoy the movies being compared to the real life situation.  But every episode opens with the same first 3 minutes and every episode uses the same old footage over and over again no matter what's be commented about. I found that annoying.  Overall, because I am a True Crime fan as well as a fan of the Ganster movies discussed, I'd give this 2 and a half stars but since I can't give half stars I had to give it 2 because it's just not a 3 for me.",1327363200,6,1104,4.568527918781726

3540878,4,B001DW2BJW,"Hollywood VS the Mob (2008) from Mill Creek Entertainment, is a
unique and remarkable documentary series, made up of 9 DVD's, each
lasting 90 minutes or longer.

Each episode relies on a stunningly crystal clear footage and
flawless editing, coupled with a well researched, agreeable and
intelligent narrative.

The merit of this series, is that is never loses sight of reality,
and with entertainment as well, at one point labeling the
Abrahamic mobs in America the Kosher Nostra (as compared to the
Cosa Nostra.)

Fleeing a continent where the quality of life of individuals was
pigeon-holed by social class, and agricultural jobs, America was a
unique opportunity for precisely the opposite.

For example, an episode analyzes the accuracy of the movie 'The
Purple Gang' (1959), with actors Barry Sullivan and  Robert Blake.
That movie is hard-hitting even 50 years later, in 2010, showing a
victim having cement boots added,  payoffs suggested to
detectives, and ""Rat Pack"" scare tactics.

The gang comprised 3 brothers, led be Abe Bernstein, who ran the
clique for 5 years during the 13 years of Prohibition - before
rivals from St Louis took over. The existence of this gang isn't
altogether surprising, as 250,000 Abrahamic immigrants arrived to
America by 1880, and 2.5 million more from 1880 to 1924, among a
total of 20 million arrivals of all backgrounds during that span.

It is said that movies at the time, portrayed underworld members
as cold-hearted, spontaneous, irrational killers, some film scenes
showing people pushed in front of trains, down flights of stairs
or being strangled. They also sanitized the ethnicity of members,
through the use of Anglo-Saxon names in place of actual ones. For
example, the financier Arnold Rothstein trained, mentored and
funded underworld operations, later to a lesser degree by Meyer
Lansky. Those movies that the time, suggested  society had
delinquent elements, in some cases with low IQ's, with behavioral
and mental issues, examples being WILD ONE, or REBEL WITHOUT A
CAUSE, EASY RIDER.

Othter mobsters were shown to be clever, relying on double-book
accounting, pristine offices, intelligence business models  and
legitimate business fronts for their underlying, underworld
operations.

As with narcotics, the Purples ""cut"" the Canadian liquor with much
cheaper, easier to manufacture and lower-grade content before
retail. Between them, the Purples were responsible for 500
gangland rubouts in Detroit.

The various aspects of the underworld are discussed, from the
""muscle""  to commodity transportation lines (Windsor to Detroit),
payoffs, meat packing and truck union rackets, factory shakedowns
(odor attacks, fire, disruption of supplies), casinos, numbers
rackets (""bolita"") vehicle theft, narcotics, kidnappings, pension
fund-raiding etc.

Other Abrahamic mobsters included Bugsy Siegel, Mickey Cohen in
California, Dutch Schulz in NYC, Lefty Rosenthal. No mention is
made of Lepke Buchalter, or Mendy Weiss, Al Tannenbaum or Hymie
Weiss, in Murder inc.

The morale of movies called out to the public to resist apathy,
instilling honor, a civic duty, patriotism and a desire to take
the witness stand and speak up when called upon or identify
suspects in lineups.

The focus of the series is on those suppliers of slot machines,
casino games,  narcotics, escort services and not on the
consumers. There is also a lack of discussion of the political
machinery behind  important public figures, that often are in
close contacts with the underworld.",1268611200,3,3514,5.391224862888483
8295132,2,B001DW2BJW,"I found this dvd very misleading. I thought it was going to be a documentary on how the lives of certain mobsters were portrayed in the movies and whether or not the portrayals were close to the truth or not. Instead, it turned out to be an analysis of 9 movies (mostly from the 1940's and 1950's) almost in their entirety, with an occasional comparison to the real-life characters.  For mob/gangster enthusiasts like myself, there is very little  new information and each segment is quite lengthy. I would recommend this one to fans of the gangster movie-era featuring Robinson, Cagney,and  Muni who would like background info to the movie scripts. Other than that, I wouldn't recommend this one.",1523404800,,697,4.889830508474576

8295140,4,B001DW2BJW,"This three DVD set is a series about Hollywood's take on mobsters through history. Don Kraus is excellent as the narrator of the entire series. Each disc has three episodes on it.

Disc one: ""The Mafia Comes To America"" where they focused on E.G. Robinson's performance in the film, ""Little Caesar.""
""The Irish Gangs"" episode is focused on James Cagney's performance in ""Public Enemy."" The final episode on disc one is entitled ""Al Capone's Chicago Mob"" with the original 1930 film, ""Scarface.""

The second disc features ""The Law Gang AKA The FBI with the film, ""G Men."" The next episode is entitled ""Lucky Luciano's New York Mafia"" with the film, ""Marked Woman"" about prostitution. The final episode on this disc is ""The Rackets"" with the film, ""Loan Shark.""

The final third disc includes the episode, ""The Black Mafia,"" with a seventies film, ""The Black Godfather. ""The Jewish Mafia"" was explored in the film, ""The Purple Gang,"" with Robert Blake. In this film, the characters names were changed from Jewish to non-ethnic names in Detroit, Michigan. The final episode is entitled ""The Godfathers"" with a film entitled ""Honor Thy Father"" about Italian mafia godfathers. Joseph Bologna stars in this film.

Remember Hollywood took many liberties in depicting mobsters and Mafia over the decades despite the Hollywood Code of morality. The narrator tries to differentiate between truth and fiction in each episode with clips, old news footage, and photographs.

This nine episode series would be a great gift for those interested in mafia history and Old Hollywood films. This set makes me want to see the films in entirety.",1425600000,,1624,5.067415730337078
