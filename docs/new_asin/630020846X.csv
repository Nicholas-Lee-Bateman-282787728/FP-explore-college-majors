7805085,2,630020846X,"My vhs tape had very poor picture quality, almost unwatchable.  Since these sellers offer no picture, I`m wondering if it is by the same company.  I love Barbara Steele and I think the movie was good, but It was hard to follow because of the poor quality.  Not a good buy for the price. Would have rated it much higher if the quality was better.",1285804800,2,345,4.276923076923077
