a shame how beautiful  Jeanet  Leigh end the the film.
The best of the film is the Invitation to the dance  Ballet by Carl Maria Von  Weaver.",1376352000,,229,4.090909090909091
5055964,5,B007549XXY,"I came across this movie playing on TCM one day years ago but it was almost over and so I never got to see the beginning of the movie.  I never saw it play again on TCM.  I searched for it on line only to discover that it had never been released on VHS or DVD.  A review said that it wasn't very popular when it first came out because it was heavy on dialogue. But in my opinion, it was the dialogue and actors that I found so interesting.  It also tells the story of events that happened after WWII in occupied Europe, whihch is something I found intriguing as well.  I was very happy to see that it was recently released on DVD.  It's a great, classic movie.  Love it!",1362700800,11,670,4.03030303030303
8510370,2,B007549XXY,"That was the title of a 1938 travel book, ten years before this production, but it does hint at my chief problem with this film.  Why two-star such a quaint 1940s period piece that seemed so correct after 1989?  Not because of the cheesy characters (though played by good period actors like Walter Pidgeon and Angela Lansbury).  Nor because of the cornball plot, with its clichd battle between reason and faith. Unsurprisingly, faith has won out in the rightward yank of this film and its era; another example is the film sanctification of Hungarys Cardinal Mindzsenty in Guilty of Treason, released the following year.

In Col. Hooky/Walter Pidgeons monologue, he puts his foot down to fume why he should facilitate the forced return of poor, persecuted refugees whose only crime is that they do not wish to live under Communism.  Ah, if only it were that simple; and all the 1940s DPs as innocent-pretty as Vivien Leigh, or gentle souls like the good Russian professor and his cleaning-lady wife.  I knew such a DP, from Romania, who heroically jumped from a moving prison train carrying him to Siberia.  Who came to the USA, found sponsorship, and became an educator in his community.  Only he was a former Iron Guard who served the Nazi-aligned government of Ion Antonescu.  This film nicely ignores such issues as it ridicules Soviet concerns with criminal elements: all the films dirty old Russian colonel *really* wants is getting his paws on Miss Leighs tender young flesh.  As if protecting such innocents from vicious commissars and their gulags was the real reason for the cold war.

As we learned to our sorrow and pity the Western Allies lifted their canvas curtain to allow thousands of Nazi collaborators into their zones, many outright war criminals, from the likes of Klaus Barbie to next-door killers like Ivan the Terrible Demyanyuk of Cleveland.  And they were aided and abetted all too often by the Catholic Church and the Pope of the period, Eugenio Pacelli/Pius XII, in whitewashing their pasts (as this film with the whole issue.)  Productions like Red Danube closed the popular Western mind to the very idea that European DPs could be anything other than homeless, persecuted wretches deserving of all open doors and hearts.  All contrary observation was mere Red propaganda.

The truth is that the West, the Soviets, and the UN collaborated fully in one of the greatest DP catastrophes in postwar history, ongoing as Americans watched this film in their hometown theaters:  the ethnic cleansing of the German populations of East Prussia, Poland, the Sudetenland, and along the Danube Basin.  It was the scapegoating of Germans from Stettin on the Baltic to Trieste on the Adriatic (to use Churchills phrase) that produced a population displacement of 12 million with deaths of over a half million.  Youd never know it from this film version of Danubian history.  The real Volksdeutsche  like Volga-German Vivien Leigh  were being cleansed from the Iron Curtain, not swallowed into it.  The winsome little Mickey Mouse, on whom Walter Pidgeon bestows a whole pack of smokes for said street urchin to sell on the black market, was likely as not such an expellee.

This 1949 movie has fairly decent production values; its script is intelligent if opinionated; one might think my own judgment too harsh.  But films like this had serious consequences.  Its intent was, of course, to awaken the West to its humanitarian mission and stand up for its values and traditions; even if pushed so unwillingly into cold war by Soviet excess (despite a military-industrial network fed by war and still hungry).  Rest easy, Colonel Hooky: the enduring tradition continues.  America is in Afghanistan to empower girls, Iraq enjoys its new democracy, while NATO bombs Libya and gloats over Qaddafis roadside lynching to enforce human rights.",1517961600,,3849,5.011006289308176
8510371,5,B007549XXY,"A great movie with great moral elements as we see Janet Leigh as a Ballet dancer which by the way is a beautiful Russian form of dance that is so elegant and aesthetically artistic, this dancer we see happens to be a woman of faith and we see her praying and making the sign of the Cross in an extremely reverential manner in a way to make us lament the days that we live in that are devoid of such pious Christian expressions. Through the help of a Mother Superior of a monastery in a Traditional way where we see nuns in veil, helping the dancer to try to evade the atheistic soviet military chief that searches for those who should be deported to Russia. It is interesting to see how the U.S.and west traded places with Russia, as Russia returned to its Christian Orthodox roots while the U.S. and the west took up atheism and are becoming increasingly anti-Christian. We should learn from this movie how horrible it was to live under an atheistic oppressive regimes and learn to be friends with Russia as Russia is one of our friends and we can learn a lot from them in how to overcome atheism as they did. Beautiful movie with strong Religious tone and artistic elegance.",1492214400,,1176,4.449074074074074
8510372,5,B007549XXY,"This movie is an amazing look at post-war Vienna. The cast is superb and the story is so relevant to the political times we are living in, complete with a mention of the power grab for oil. I highly recommend this very well done historical movie, especially for anyone foolish enough to think that the Russians are our friends or that WWIII is conceivable. In fact, maybe this should be required watching for all of us.",1487894400,,419,4.526315789473684

The disc arrived with a line stating that ""This disc is expected to play back in DVD video 'play only' devices, and may not play back in other DVD devices including recorders and PC drives.""  I only have a PC drive and it did not work.  By the time I found a friend who had a non-recording DVD  player, it was too late to return the product. It did not even work on the DVD player.",1449878400,2,443,4.0
8510376,5,B007549XXY,Lots of old stars.  Good story.  I can't remember seeing this movie before.  I don't think it has been shown very much.  It has a lot of dialogue and it's important to listen to it carefully.  Not for anybody that likes action.  Takes time to unfold and doesn't follow the typical Hollywood formula.  It twists and turns.  Found it very entertaining.,1446163200,2,350,4.622950819672131
8510377,5,B007549XXY,A spell binding story with excellent plot and exceptional acting performances by all.  Wonder what happened to the little beggar girl.  She was adorable.,1439424000,2,153,5.333333333333333
8510378,4,B007549XXY,"Europe near the end of WWII and the military and civilian lives that inter-sect.  Janet Leigh and Peter Lawford are an attractive triangle as the
Russian ballerina attempts to escape with her beloved British boyfriend.  Good turns by Ethel Barrymore as a Mother-Superior of a convent
trying to assist the lovers, Walter Pidgeon as an American  senior officer caught between conscience and military dictate and finally, Louis
Calhern as a stern Russian military officer who changes in views and perspective as situations and conditions redefine themselves in the final days of WW II.  Good script, good cast and MGM ""magic"" make this an interesting impressive motion picture.  One to definitely view and thereafter,
consider very, very carefully.",1426118400,4,745,5.333333333333333
8510379,4,B007549XXY,"Great post-WWII film in the days of Vienna with each country having their military sector, like what you find in THE THIRD MAN.  This story's about a Colonel trying to keep Soviet refugees from having to be re-patriated against their will.  The U.N. finally passed a resolution by the end of the film so this would no longer happen.  But the drama,  story,  and star power make this film very interesting.  A rare one.  Walter Pidgeon,  Louis Calhern(excellent as a Russian officer), Angela Lansbury early in her career (Gaslight times),  Janet Leigh,  Peter Lawford early on,  Ethyl Barrymore as great as ever.  A rare gem for me.  I saw it on TCM,  but am glad it's also available here.",1422921600,5,688,4.6722689075630255
