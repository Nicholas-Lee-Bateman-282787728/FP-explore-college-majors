8387809,4,B003331GIQ,"Found this at the local Hastings. Had heard about it. A crib sheet on the Korean Three kingdoms could help a non Korean viewer, and since access to the script is via subtitles, a lot of the points will be missed. However things get clearer on a second viewing. One of the better ""war is created by men for their own crazy reasons "" films I've seen. Could be interesting to those fortunate enough to enjoy KBS's ""King of Legend"" which is sort of a prequel to the events depicted here.",1321142400,,483,4.318681318681318
