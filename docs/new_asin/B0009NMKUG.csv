2302906,5,B0009NMKUG,My 15 month old son just loves these videos. Great when you need a few minutes of quiet time.,1168300800,3,93,3.9473684210526314

8063629,4,B0009NMKUG,"Two of the discs are good and my son loves them but the ""San Diego Zoo"" disc doesn't have any singing or much commentary in it.  Just shows a bunch of animals and doesn't keep his attention very long.  But overall 2/3 isn't bad for the price.",1389225600,,242,4.127659574468085
8063630,3,B0009NMKUG,"This DVD set was nice, but nothing fantastic. We ordered it because our son was watching the free Baby Genius shorts on our cable ""on demand"" over and over. I got this to take w/ us on a car trip. It worked out pretty well. 1 of the DVDs is the exact same videos that are shown on the free ""on demand"" channel from our cable provider. Those are his favorite. The other 2 DVDs are of a zoo and something else. I don't know b/c he won't watch those ones. We could have just purchased the 1 on its own and been fine. He enjoys the kids singing and dancing to the nursery rhyme songs. The graphics and production level are very minimal/basic, but for kids, that is ok. He loves it. A good DVD set for young kids, does offer some educational value.",1255392000,2,743,4.13103448275862
8063631,5,B0009NMKUG,I've had this since my baby was 4 or 5 months old.  He's been watching it many days a week since then and he is now 23 months old.  He likes the first DVD with the nursery rhymes and he comes out and asks for it to be turned back on several times a day.  He especially likes the monkeys jumping on the bed!,1243555200,,306,3.75
8063632,2,B0009NMKUG,"I bought this for the nursery rhyme DVD because my 20 month old loves to listen to Mother Goose rhymes and we thought he would enjoy the DVD in the car. If B-I-N-G-O, She'll Be Coming Round the Mountain, and Vinko the Dancing Bear are what you're looking for, this DVD is for you. If you want classic Mother Goose...choose something else. The bonus music CD does include Itsy Bitsy Spider, Pat-A-Cake and others. I wish the creators had put those rhymes on the DVD. The other 2 DVDs are okay but don't include narration that helps explain what your child is looking at. I'm not sure why this won awards.",1232496000,,603,4.441441441441442
8063633,2,B0009NMKUG,"My granddaughter only liked the Favorite Nursery Rhymes disc.  I wish I had known that the other two DVDs were totally different from the Favorite Nursery Rhymes DVD.  The other two don't involve the Baby Genius characters as much, and the songs aren't very catchy and are too slow.  Does not keep my granddaughter's attention at all.",1232323200,,334,4.824561403508772
8063634,4,B0009NMKUG,"My daughter is about 13 months and until recently, we really didn't let her watch much in TV.  We were on a long trip and we decided it would probably help her with sitting for the trip if we put in a DVD for her to watch.  Well, it would catch her attention for periods of time and she would be capitvated by the shows.

She really enjoyed the animals the most and it helped us to keep going longer and get through the trip.  Now we have family movie nights once a week where we all sit around and watch G rated movies together.  I'm not an advicate of the TV watching my daughter, but I do enjoy watching shows with her now and having the family time together.",1214784000,,662,4.061538461538461
8063635,4,B0009NMKUG,My opinion of the Baby Genius products is so much higher than other educational DVD's.  My son loves them all!  IT's amazing what he retains from the stories!  It's quite wonderful!,1208736000,2,181,4.774193548387097
8063636,5,B0009NMKUG,"Love it!  Especially the 'San Diego Trip to the Zoo.'  My son is 20 months old, imitates all types of animals, and the trip to the zoo, was an instant hit!  The package has 3 bonus CD's - all Baby Genius quality.  The DVD's have children, Vinko and DJ, and so many wonderfully educational images - my son truly enjoys watching them, without being overstimulated.  Perfect for long car rides!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1203292800,,412,4.828571428571428
8063637,3,B0009NMKUG,I bought for my 13 month old daughter.  She loved the Nursery Rhymes on Comcast and that's included in this DVD set.  She does not like the other 2 DVDs in the set at all (she's now 20 months.)  The Nursery Rhymes shows live action images with the singing: Children singing and dancing; in B-I-N-G-O lots of different breeds of dogs doing doggie things.  Animation also appears throughout the DVD and the animated stars also have live action sequences as people in costumes.  It's very energetic and the songs are easy to sing along to.  The San Diego Zoo DVD shows images of the zoo with classical music and the animated characters only appear as pop ups walking across the bottom of the screen or something like that (I haven't seen it in a long time.)  It is boring.  The Four Seasons is even worse as it shows nature scenes to classical music.,1191715200,3,847,4.490196078431373
