4709508,5,B005IKD6ZS,"A fun and lovely Christmas story, `G'-Good for all Generations. Mandie (Kelly Washington) is secretly  Cherokee because the period holds a prejudice. She's needing learning, etiquette, and social status ways. She struggles with rules. Her roommate at Heathwood's School for Girls in NC, Polly (Amanda Waters) is more typically the upper crust expected at the school. Joanna Daniel plays the headmistress Heathwood well, being this story's Grinch. There's a secret behind her attitude to Christmas, and it is hidden in the off-limits attic. Attics can hold lots of scary and surprising things, as the film proves. The film has several youth actors, the occasional overacted scene, but overall, it's quite believable and heartwarming.

A superb actress first timer, Joy Chapman plays Miss Prudence, an adult helper with the schoolgirls. Amazingly she has other duties including: Director, Producer, Writer, & Editor. She's not the only multi-tasker. Owen Smith is Prod., Writer, orig music, & Cinematography. Ken Smith acts as Farmer Earl after having built sets. It's a family affair in story and reality. That's what makes these low-budget films to endearing. Not always perfect Hollywood, but close enough and hats off to the cast and crew. Well done!

I've not read the books by Lois Gladys Leppard. All I can review is the film, not how closely it is adapted. I expect the spirit of the author's theme is realized. The film's overall theme seems to be HOPE at Christmas. A hint at faith-based characters. There is also effort given to demonstrate the unfairness of prejudice of all types. Mandie lies for a good cause--is that right? She's also cleverly deceitful at times, causing humor. Sometimes the beautiful scenery, even looks at period props including many quilts, offer as much interest as the mystery of the attic.

SUBTITLES (CC) ARE AVAILABLE. Bonus is big. 60min behind scenes; 14min bloopers; 1600 photos `that's a lot'; 7 trailers; and guides. Feature is 107min. filmed in GA representing NC.

Some historical Christmas sweetness, via story and visuals, as tasty as Figgie Pudding. I'm now ordering ""Mandie & the Secret Tunnel""-2009 & ""Mandie & the Cherokee Treasure""-2010. My wife is considering looking into the books, after enjoying ""Mandie and the Forgotten Christmas.""
She said the film is a 5 star, and I have to agree. Don't rent, it's a keeper, a new viewing tradition.",1320969600,21,2394,5.143958868894601

4709517,1,B005IKD6ZS,"This movie is an abomination to the Mandie Book Series.  It doesn't follow any one book in particular.  It was mostly going for book 4 - Mandie and the Forbidden Attic in which Mandie and her new best friend Celia (a wealthy girl also attending the school) find a poor mute girl in the attic.

In the movie, however,  Mandie is attending Miss Heathwood's school with Polly Cornwallis - Mandie's annoying neighbor who in actuality doesn't attend the school until much later in the book series, and together Mandie and Polly find Celia hiding in the attic.  What?! Considering that Celia is a key character in the books it is absurd that they wrote her in as the poor urchin hiding in the attic.

It also seems they cast Miss Prudence and Miss Hope in opposite roles as Miss Prudence in the older stuffy sister.

Everything about this movie was awkward.  Particularly the story line but also the acting and casting.

If you want a heartwarming story read the books!",1448928000,4,963,4.617647058823529
