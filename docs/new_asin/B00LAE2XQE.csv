8664834,1,B00LAE2XQE,"Ok. Theres no plot to this movie. 90% of the action is done horribly. The action is bad because it uses slow motion and motion blur. It will make you sick. You won't even know what's really going on during action scenes. The final fight is the only thing not affected too much by this. And it's just a horrible fight.  The acting is cringe. It's not the worst ever but every actor in this movie is bad. It sounds like this was recorded on a Iphone, cheap camcorder and old security cameras. This is one of the movies where you watch it for 10 mins and you either turn it off or laugh at how bad it is. Most of the movie is spent in a warehouse. Most of the characters just start randomly killing each other.  The lighting in this movie is very bad. I rate this a zombie ass out of 10.",1485475200,,784,4.051612903225807

8664836,1,B00LAE2XQE,"There is a chemical released to create mutants, then they are nuked, but there is no real signs of that. A group of survivors are hunkered together when the ""new guy"" shows up. In this case it is Shinji (Andre McCoy) a quiet special ops type who wears his sunglasses at night. There is some poorly developed drama within the group made worse because the acting was bad. Perhaps the worse in the group is Kat (Isabella Marie Brown-Quigley) who believes everyone hates her because she is just 18, and not because of her acting.

The script gives out information and then brings it together in the most boring way possible. Most of the film was done in a warehouse. We do get a long lecture on how rat poison works. The mutants are walking dead, but are killed by normal methods.
