The package did contain two discs, however, there were two of the same disc!",1421452800,,244,4.545454545454546

The water looks so pure and indulging I wanted to jump right in! They have created something that can set any mood. As for me at night time, I like to have my radio on with some good music, some candles going and have something on tv that isn't regular tv.. this sets my closing evening to a perfect end with the most beautiful waterfalls and cascading rivers.. I cant tell you how worth this DVD collection is. It is a must get! They make them themselves and do a great job and capturing the most Refreshing Waters. If your looking for something like this look no further cause you have found it. You will not be disappointed!

Thanks for making this DVD collection I will be looking forward to seeing what else you offer!",1303084800,,896,4.397590361445783
