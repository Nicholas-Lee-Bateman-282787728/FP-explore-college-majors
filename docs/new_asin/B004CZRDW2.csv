Now if only Amazon could get ""Young and Dangerous"" with Mark Damon and Lillie Gentle. Same time frame.
This take me back to great times in my young adult hood. Love it!!!",1491264000,,324,4.0
8424628,5,B004CZRDW2,"I was picked as an extra when the film was shot in Japan in 1955. I have watched the movie since I bought it and there I am in a dance scene in a night club. I was in the Army at that time and only 23 years old. It was a great experience for me along with about 15 other members of our unit.
I was so pleased to find this film on Amazon. I have pictures with Chuck Connors, Aldo Ray, Dick York, and the Japanese lady movie star, as well as the Director, and other cast members. They treated us real nice and we ate with them as well as had conversations about the States. The Army assigned us to the movie for a week and it was something I remember to this day when I was a movie star.",1477353600,2,685,3.797202797202797

8424632,5,B004CZRDW2,For the older at heart. Black and white post war WW2 leaving your hatred behind. Aldo Rey shows how a tough guy can be bigger and better than than he thought he could be.,1362009600,4,170,4.029411764705882
8424633,5,B004CZRDW2,...not bad for a black and white movie released in 1955.  The Aspect Ratio listed was 1.33:1 but to my surprise it was in widescreen format.  Picture is pristine and the story line is decent.  Not bad at all.,1330041600,8,208,4.282051282051282
8424634,1,B004CZRDW2,The packaging and disc felt like your standard bootlegging operation. It was a terrible transfer and very expensive. But I understand it's also a rare movie that won't make that much in return for them. Your standard East meets West love story of the time.,1324166400,,256,4.711111111111111
