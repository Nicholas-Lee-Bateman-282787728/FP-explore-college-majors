2165265,4,B000641ZRW,"This is a fine ""B"" movie appropriate for the Friday night horror movie fan.  The movie combines elements of terror (not of the modern gruesome, bloody sort) and of a murder mystery.  For those who may have enjoyed late night horror films with their parents when young, this film will be viewed with fondness.",1398470400,3,308,4.685185185185185

2165268,3,B000641ZRW,"This movie is not for everyone. But, if you like old school films from the B movie shelf, you should give this one a try. Todd Slaughter was a favorite of mystery lovers and his ""over the top"" acting adds to the delight.",1389657600,3,220,4.1395348837209305
2165269,2,B000641ZRW,I would go for the Arcanum version of this film as the print quality is better and it's paired in a double feature with Tod Slaughter's MURDER IN THE RED BARN. A MUCH better value.,1105920000,5,180,4.171428571428572
2165270,4,B000641ZRW,"This 1940 George King production from British Lion Studios is a delightfully evil if somewhat hokey little horror film. The setting is Paris, France in the year 1880, and a series of murders has the populace in mortal terror of ""Le Loup"" (""the wolf""). Why the killer is described as a wolfman is beyond me because in each case, the victim sees a horrifying face in the window and is stabbed in the back with a dagger. When M. de Brisson's bank is robbed during one murder, he fears he will be ruined financially. Then a new client, Chevalier Del Gardo appears to entrust a substantial amount of money to his care; the Chevalier's motives are far from noble, however, as he wants the hand of the young, beautiful Cecile de Brisson in return for his help. Cecile is in love with ""lowly"" bank clerk Lucien Cortier, and Del Gardo attempts to frame him for the murders. Several additional murders are perpetrated during the course of the story, and Lucien's last opportunity to prove his innocence involves a great new discovery made by a ""mad"" (yet noble) scientist. This scientist has successfully used electricity to reanimate dead animals, and he is convinced that he can do the same for a dead human; in this manner, one of Le Loup's victims will be able to come back just long enough to name his murderer.

I found this to be an excellent early horror flick. Some elements of the plot are a little ridiculous, but the actors play their parts exceedingly well and do not at any time overdramatize and thus undermine the story. Tod Slaughter plays the evil Chevalier Del Gardo to the hilt and could rightfully make reference to a truly evil cackle on his acting resume, John Warwick as Lucien Cortier shines as the quintessential hero determined to clear his name and nab the true killer, and Marjorie Taylor is delightful as Cecile de Brisson. The special effects, such as they are, are also very effective, particularly the coalescing image of the hideous ""face at the window."" The introductory text that introduces the motion picture sums the movie up quite well; The Face at the Window is an old-school melodrama ""dear to the hearts of all who unashamedly enjoy either a shudder or a laugh at the heights of villainy.""",1102982400,,2221,4.680306905370844

8038119,4,B000641ZRW,"Lovely Paris circa 1880, a hideous face appears in a window while a man falls with a knife in the back.  A bank has been robbed, dooming the bank owner to ruination!  Who could have done the dastardly deed?  Who indeed.  Meanwhile, a simple clerk in said bank wants the hand of the bank owner's daughter.  Unfortunately for him, so does creep du jour Tod Slaughter (as Chevalier Lucio del Gardo).  Gardo wants even more than that!  He promptly frames the clerk for the bank robbery and the murder.  Can the hapless clerk out maneuver the skunk or will he be caught by the incompetent cops?

I've just recently discovered Tod Slaughter, villain extraordinaire.  I think he's a hoot.  He overworks every scene he's in but does it with a peculiar finesse that I find fascinating.  He also has an evil chuckle he doesn't use sparingly.  He's obvious but I found his style of acting highly engrossing.  I wish they had more of his movies available on DVD.

As for the quality of the print, its par for the course, not as good as it should be but better than nothing.",1440979200,,1061,4.481675392670157

8038121,3,B000641ZRW,"Anyone who stayed up past midnight on Friday nights to watch old horror theaters will wax nostalgic.  This 1940s vintage horror/mystery takes place in late 19th century Paris.  The backdrop is a series of murders attributed to ""the Wolf"" that always follow a mysterious face at the window.  Is it a werewolf?

The plot follows a well-worn path, and the characters are at best stereotyped.  Uninspired acting is acceptable to move the plot.  Still, if you're in the mood for this genre, you'll probably enjoy ""The Face at the Window.""",1412121600,3,533,4.866666666666666
8038122,3,B000641ZRW,"It was a night full of heavy rain and thunderstorms yesterday. We decided to watch some scary films from 1939 with the lights down low while our dog hid by us from the thunder.  The two movies we chose were available free to Amazon Prime members.  The first one we watched was 'The Face at the Window' (1939).  The second was 'Human Monster' also from that same year.

'The Face in the Window' takes place in Paris probably in the1880s.  The story concerns grisly murders that are committed right after the victim sees a gruesome werewolf-like face in their window.  Soon after that vision they're found with a knife in their back accompanied by an eery howling sound.  While these murders are being investigated another side story is going on.  The partner of a rich banker has eyes for his associate's much younger daughter.  This creepy and lecherous character is played with gusto by actor Tod Slaughter.  The daughter he wants for his wife is in love with a young penniless bank clerk in her fathers employe.  The evil older man must find a way to get rid of his young rival.  The story is slow at times, still most fans of 1930s crime/horror films should enjoy it like we did.  I would not call it a great film; it is entertaining with some genuinely scary scenes.

Both films together make a good lights out, stormy night, double feature.  I hope some of you will check them out if you've never seen them and you like these sort of films.",1408665600,9,1445,4.503846153846154

The big plus for me though is that I thought the audio was very good for a movie made in 1940, Sometimes the audio is so bad on this age of movie that it is hard to enjoy it.",1404604800,,325,3.591549295774648
