8313426,3,B0011ZCUX8,"I started tracking these guys after their first feature, Containment. Even though it had poor production values and probably cost next to nothing to make, the story was something I've never seen before, completely original and unpredictable, which is next to impossible in today's market (I'm pretty sure everyone else hated it because of the cheesy creature effects and poor quality though ;). Needless to say, I (at least) was euphoric to see that a new film was on its way out.

I finally got it and popped it in the DVD player. I see that they've improved on their production practices a bit, but they're not quite on the top dollar mark yet. If you can see past the low-budget bliss, the film does stand to deliver some pretty good qualities for an indie film and this DVD has some special features (commentary, trailer) for those who feel like the film wasn't worth $10. I personally do not judge based on budget, because 90% of the films out there (including Hollywood blockbusters) could've been better with more money, so I rate mostly on story and execution.

I do have mixed feelings about the film's content in its entirety though. It stems from the same genre as torture porn (capture and kill) movies. Plenty of clad leather bondage gear and needles are involved as the main character suffers through some interesting torture scenes (the drill to the head did have me at the edge of my seat). In the end there is a HUGE payoff and the originality strikes hard. The killer in the movie is quite unique and the ending goes through more twists than that mess of wires behind my computer (and no, I don't own a Mac).

But all-in-all, it was just ""pretty good"" for me. I'm not sure if the genre is just getting stale or what. It was a good capture and torture film on a budget, no doubt. I'd give 4 stars for that...if it had been one of the first. However, I think I've seen one too many of these films.

I'd say it's worth seeing if you enjoy those capture and kill movies, serial killer movies, or indulge in films with surprise endings. It excels in the storyline and the fx are nice for a film in this budget range. If you're freaked out by needles and other sharp objects, then you should definitely see this one. Otherwise, I'd hold out till it hits the bargain bin, or rent it.",1210550400,,2294,4.480861244019139
8313427,5,B0011ZCUX8,I found that the character of Dr. Allan Smith played by Robert Strouse could have been better utilized throughout the film.  The lack of this character could have seriously jeopardized the film.  All in all a good film and I look forward to seeing actor Robert Strouse in future roles.  I highly recommend this film to horror buffs everywhere.,1210118400,,343,4.779661016949152
