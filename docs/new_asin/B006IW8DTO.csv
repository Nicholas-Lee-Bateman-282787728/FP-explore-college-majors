4991836,4,B006IW8DTO,"IN DARKNESS is based on the true story of a group of people who survived the violent destruction of the Jewish ""ghetto"" by escaping into the sewers of Lvov, Poland. For 14 months they endured unimaginable hardship surving through the help of a Polish sewer worker named Leopold Socha.
Although there is nothing much new in this story, it is still rivoting. There have been countless stories about a small group of Jewish men and women surving the horrors of Nazi evils in World War II. This is just one more story, and of course, all the stories of survival againts all odds are worth knowing.
Dozens escape into the sewers as the Nazis are exterminating the ghetto and killing randomly and dragging everyone else to concentration camps. When the encounter Socha on his rounds in the sewers, he offers to help only 11 and for a price. He can't save everyone but he can take 11 away to a more secluded area.
Here is where the story of mistrust, deceit, compassion and heroism take over.
Director Agnieszka Holland takes us on another harrowing story of survival during World War II. The group fo 11 whittles down to a smaller group and Socha must keep his secret from the world as he also must feed several extra mouths during a time of food shortages. Although we see the people living in the sewers, the story seems a bit sanitized. How did they deal with the filth and the horrific odors. We see kids treating the rats as almost pets. Despite the horrific environment, life goes and on and people still have the desire to have sex and be physically close. It is amazing.
There is a twist to this story that can be found in the Extra Features on the disc. Here is where the real gem of the film shines. Unbeknownst to director Agnieszka Holland, one of the survivors of the sewer was still very much alive. Krystyna Chiger was a small child with her brother and parents in the sewers. It's surprising that Holland did not discover this fact until AFTER her film was completed. In one of the extra features, Holland interviews Chiger about her experiences in the sewer. Chiger had no input in the making of the film but praised Holland for its realism and accuracy. I could have spent hours listening to Chiger tell her story. There have been countless films about the Holocaust and how groups of people survived the horrific odds. These films usually end with written words on the screen to give a brief synopsis of what happened to the survivors. How fascinating it would be to follow the survivors after their ordeal. How did they cope with the horrors? What was life like after the war--to have lost everything and everyone?
IN DARKNESS is a testament to survival and the will to live.",1339977600,10,2689,4.580912863070539
4991837,5,B006IW8DTO,"Over the past year and a half, I have been reading and writing about the agony of eastern Poland and especially the people of Lwow in the years 1939-1948.

So this film, based on the actual survival of a handful of Jews in the Lwow sewer from about February 1943 to June 1944, has been on my must-see list for some time.

I watched the DVD over the past two nights--it was really too emotional for a single sitting. It is one of the finest films I have ever seen, and I don't think that's only because of my interest in the city and its inhabitants. The evolution of the sewer worker from a fairly unpleasant thug at the beginning to a smiling hero at the end was a remarkable bit of acting, and totally convincing. The incarcerated Jews are almost as unique, especially the little girl with her ragged red hair ribbon (shown peeking out of the sewer in the movie poster and DVD cover), and just as believable. I suspect that most American viewers will be baffled by another major character, the handsome Ukrainian militia officer who is a pal both of the Polish sewer worker and the German occupiers. Suffice it to say that he was the ultimate winner of the conflict for the city, since Lwow is now the city of Lviv in western Ukraine, and has been pretty much cleansed of both Jews and Poles.

4991838,5,B006IW8DTO,"Robert Marshall,  the author of All the King's Men, collected the memoirs of survivors from the Ukrainian city of Lvov and combining them with his own research wrote a trying account of a group of Jews who spent 14 months in 1943-44 hiding in the city's sewer system. His book, ""In the Sewers of Lvov: A Heroic Story of Survival from the Holocaust"" recounts the lives of  twenty people, including two children and a pregnant woman, descending into their own Inferno--the ledges, caverns, and underground rivers of the catacombs beneath the city streets. How they coped with the feces, the rats, the darkness, the deaths of half their numbers, even with delivery and infanticide, is an unbelievably cruel documentation of truth. Marshall dedicated his book to the memory of Leopold Socha, a former criminal who became a Ukrainian sewer worker and made it his life's atonement to save a few Jews out of the murdered millions. Tragically, soon after he was able to bring ""his Jews"" back to daylight, Socha was killed in an accident. This extraordinary story has been adapted for the screen by David F. Shamoon and is recreated for us by the genius of Agnieszka Holland's direction.

The film is dark not only in content but also in the lack of light: most of the two and a half hour film takes place in the underground sewers where little light is available. The acting is immensely fine - especially Robert Wieckiewicz as Leopold Socha, the Catholic, petty thief, dissolute Polish sewer worker who saved the lives of a dozen Jews by hiding them underground for 14 months, Kinga Preis as his sympathetic wife Wanda, Krzysztof Skonieczny as Socha's partner Szczepek (Socha and Szczepek began their desperate business knowing the Nazis would pay $500 for each Jew they turn in but they in turn bargain with conman Jewish leader Mundek (Benno Frmann) and for an even steeper price, they provide food and other resources to the underground Jews living in the sewers. The actors who portray the Jews - adults and children - are equally suberb.  The cinematography is by Jolanta Dylewska and the spare but touching musical score is by Antoni Lazarkiewicz.

Though Holland takes us through the terror and misery these people suffered, she adds at the end of the film some facts that are appalling. In addition to offering the numbers of the Jews slaughtered  during the war and the eventual division of lands and homes destroyed by the Nazis, she adds some facts that are heartwarming, such as in 1978 Socha and his wife were awarded the title ""Righteous among the Nations"" by Yad Vashem in Israel.

This is a very powerful film, brilliant in every aspect and one that deserves very wide attention to the peoples of the world. In Polish, Ukrainian, Yiddish, German with English subtitles. Grady Harp, June 12",1339632000,6,2798,4.841004184100418

4991840,3,B006IW8DTO,"""These are my Jews, my work."" This is the true story of a Polish soldier named Leopold Socha (Wieckiewicz) who risked his life in the 1940's in order to help a group of Jews escape death. His job as a soldier was to travel around the sewers of Lvov looking for people that are hiding and turn them in. After reaching a group they offer him money for him not to say anything. He returns often to get more of the bribery but eventually keeping them safe becomes about more then money. I am usually a sucker for true stories, especially ones that have a significant historical aspect to them. This one is very emotional as well as very inspirational. Much like ""Schindler's List"" and movies like that, this one really shows that no matter what your orders are humanity will ultimately win out and you will do whatever it takes to save a life. This movie really makes me want to learn more about this story and more about the reasons why this took place. Knowing nothing about this story I was on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen to both the Jews and Socha. The only real thing wrong with this movie is that it was pretty slow moving and a little repetitive. There were sometimes that I was looking at the clock and that took me out of the movie but it was still powerful enough to suck me back in. Overall, very emotional and inspirational and a movie that should be seen. I recommend this.  I give it a B.",1339286400,12,1425,4.297397769516729
4991841,4,B006IW8DTO,"""In Darkness"" (2011) was directed by internationally acclaimed Polish film director, Agnieszka Holland, and is based upon a true story.

In the Nazi-occupied Polish city of Lwow in 1943 a group of Jews burrow through the floor of their house into the sewer system in preparation for their escape from the ghetto. They come face to face with Leopold Socha (Robert Wiekiewicz), a Polish sewer worker and thief who agrees to assist them for a price.

When the Nazis liquidate the ghetto, the group escapes into the sewers with Socha and his partner, Szczepek (Krzysztof Skonieczny) as guides. Socha is reluctant to hide such a large number of people and forces the Jews to pare down the size of the group.

Conditions in the sewers are hellish but the Jews survive with the help of Socha. He keeps his secret from his wife, Wanda (Kinga Preis), and from his friend, Bortnick (Michal Zurawski), an officer in the Ukrainian forces assisting the Nazis. Over time, Socha's feelings for the Jews turn from indifferent to protective. He confesses his activities to Wanda and she fears for her family's safety.

It's anything but a pleasant existence for the Jews in the dark, squalid sewer. Raw sewage runs knee deep and rats are everywhere. They don't trust Socha and bicker amongst themselves. There is no privacy in their cramped hideout. A couple engages in sex only a few feet from their fellow escapees. Two strike out on their own into the sewers only to be murdered by the Nazis. Chaja (Julia Kijowska) delivers a baby which she promptly smothers because of the infant's crying.

When the stress of hiding the Jews becomes too much for Socha he abandons them for a short period, but returns to their aid after he discovers the two children who are lost in the sewer maze. Mundek (Benno Furmann) leaves the sewer and enters into the Janowska concentration camp to find Klara's (Agnieszka Grochowska) sister but she refuses to leave the camp for the hideous sewer. The Jews finally run out of funds to pay Socha, so he buys them food with his own money.

When a heavy downpour floods the sewer, nearly drowning the Jews, Socha rushes to save them. A suspicious Bortnick spots the Jews' supplies in the flowing water and realizes his friend has betrayed him but can't escape the flood.

The Germans are pushed out of Lwow by the advancing Red Army and Socha and his wife greet the surviving Jews as they emerge from the sewer to daylight.

The story takes place mostly underground so darkness is the film's overriding (and at times overwhelming) characteristic. Holland has the viewer share the absolute misery of the sewer. The acting is extremely good, especially Wiekiewicz's poignant performance. Agnieszka Grochowska is such a wonderful actress; a sorrowful beauty in much the same mold as Juliet Binoche. Kinga Preis and Julia Kijowska give noteworthy performances. Don't blink or you'll miss small parts by two lovely Polish actresses, Weronika Rosati and Maja Bohosiewicz.

""In Darkness"" is a very moving film. Holland handles the Polish-Jewish relationship very frankly and honestly. Anti-Semitism was quite prevalent in interbellum Poland. The Polish Catholic Church was an ardent supporter of the popular and rabidly anti-Semtic National Democratic Party (Endecja). Popular sentiment favored deporting Poland's Jewish citizens. After the Nazis occupied the country, many Catholics were indifferent to the plight of the Jews while some even viewed the persecution and genocide favorably. Yet, tens of thousands of Poles were involved in rescuing Jews. While some were motivated strictly by money others felt a moral obligation. But like Zegota co-founder, Zofia Kossak-Szczucka , some of the rescuers still believed that the Jews should leave Poland at the end of the war. Many of the rescuers kept their activities a secret from their anti-Semitic Catholic neighbors out of fear, even after the war ended.

This film is a striking testimony to the courage and sacrifice of those Poles, like Leopold Socha, who risked all to aid their fellow man, often despite personal and societal prejudices.

""In Darkness"" was nominated for an Academy Award as the Best Foreign Language Film of 2011. One of the two children who survived the ordeal, Krystyna Chiger, documented her experiences in ""The Girl in the Green Sweater: A Life in Holocaust's Shadow,"" published in 2009.

The DVD includes an interview of director Agnieszka Holland along with a conversation between Holland and survivor, Krystyna Chiger.

4991842,4,B006IW8DTO,"""In Darkness"" (2011 from Poland; 144 min.) brings the true story of how a group of Jews in Nazi-occupied Poland take shelter in the large underground sewer system of the city, with the help of a couple of locals. As can be expected, many troubles ensue. I don't want to spoil the plot and you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first, there are a number of very graphic scenes in the movie (just as an example, in one of the first scenes of the movie, we see Nazi soldiers chase down a group of (naked) women running for their lives into the woods--later we see that none survive), so be aware that this movie is not for the faint of heart. Second, the movie's title accurately reflects what this is about, as a significant portion of the movie plays out in the underground sewer system, where of course there is little to no light. Last but not least, this movie takes its time to develop both the main characters and the story line, so this is not for anyone in a hurry.

This movie was nominated for an Oscar for Best Foreign Movie, and it certainly deserved that honor (it did not win, though). I left the movie theater where I saw it this past weekend full with haunting images in my head from this movie. Many movies before have brought Jewish survival tales from WWII, and this more than adds to that long roster. In sum, an important topic, and a great and haunting movie. With this, I've now seen 3 of the 5 Oscar-nominated best foreign movies (the others being Bullhead and A Separation). I hope to get a chance to see the remaining two (Footnote; Monsieur Lahzar) in the near future. Meanwhile, if you like quality foreign movies, ""In Darkness"" is highly recommended!",1332028800,71,1717,4.464968152866242
4991843,5,B006IW8DTO,"""In Darkness"" is a 2011 Polish film nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2012 Oscars. It tells the true story of a sewer inspector in Nazi occupied Lvov (then Poland, now The Ukraine) who agrees to shelter a group of Jews escaping from the death squads intent on exterminating them. The film is based on the 1990 book ""In the Sewers of Lvov"" by Robert Marshall.

Lvov was a thriving city prior to the war, and at the start of the war it was annexed by the Soviet Union and Jews from German occupied Poland fled to the city. The Lvov Ghetto became one of the largest Jewish ghettos in Nazi occupied Poland with more than 200,000 people. Aided by the Ukrainian militia, the Nazis accelerated liquidation in 1943 when the story begins. Ultimately less than 1,000 people survived.

FWIW - Although not a part of this film, it's worthy to note that Simon Wiesenthal (1908-2005) was one of the survivors. Wiesenthal gained international fame after the war as one of the most successful Nazi hunters.

""In Darkness"" is reminiscent of ""Kanal"", a 1956 Polish film about the Warsaw Uprising - a 2 month struggle by the Polish resistance movement to liberate Warsaw from Nazi occupation while the Russians were advancing That film takes place in September 1944 and follows a platoon of 43 resistance fighters as they make their way through the city's sewer system to escape a Nazi offensive.

""Kanal"" was the second of 3 films by Andrzej Wajda (1926) about this period, a period in which he himself was a resistance fighter. Wajda (1926) has 4 Oscar nominations for Best Foreign film - ""The Promised Land"" (1975), ""The Maids of Weilko"" (1979), ""Man of Iron"" (1981), and ""Katyri"" (2007) and won a BAFTA for ""Danton"" (1982). He won the Palme d'Or at Cannes for ""Kanal"", ""Man of Marble"" (1977), ""Bez znieczulenia"" (1978) and ""Man of Iron"" (1981).

The director of this film, Agnieszka Holland (1948) worked with Wajda early in her career as a writer and served as an assistant on the critically acclaimed ""Danton"" (1982).  In this film she directs with such skill that she makes you feel the hopelessness and dread which the fugitives must have felt. Holland was nominated for an Oscar and a BAFTA for her work on ""Europa Europa"" (1990) and for an Emmy for ""Treme"" (2010).

The film is relentless in its tribute to the survival instinct, both with respect to the fugitives living in the sewers for more than a year, and the Polish worker and his family who keep them alive at the risk of their own lives.

The NY Times called the film ""suspenseful, horrifying and at times intensely moving"" and said ""the visual contrast between the worlds above and below ground is handled beautifully and evocatively."" Rex Reed in ""The Observer"" called it ""beautifully filmed, sensitively acted and expertly written"" and said ""It's harrowing, sometimes difficult to watch and wrenchingly moving to the point of tears. It is also brilliant. Do not miss it.""

Bottom line - a powerful film.",1330732800,52,2970,4.751456310679612

4991873,1,B006IW8DTO,"ANOTHER film about how khazar-jews were supposedly hunted almost to extinction by Germany? REALLY?

I think the most courageous movie by a filmmaker would be to bring an account of the over-150,000 jews serving in Germany's Wehrmacht to the silver screen. Now, that would be courageous. ...but that would go against the narrative that Germany was evil and anti-jewish.

Films like ""In Darkness"" are there for the purpose of keeping this hollow, false narrative -- of khazar-jews somehow being a poor, oppressed, hounded, huddled mass -- alive by repetition. What the film industry will never explain, is that Germany was already financially aiding khazar-jews to emigrate to literally anywhere they wanted because the National Socialist Party was no longer tolerating communist subversion in Germany. When you consider the simple fact that communism was foisted on Russia by khazar-jews like Lenin and Trotsky (and close to 90% of USSR commisars and the high command being khazar-jews) and that they then tried the same subversion in Germany after WWI, is it any wonder that Germany accepted the military service of some jews while forcing the emigration of others?",1463961600,,1165,5.258064516129032

4991939,5,B006IW8DTO,"Five stars is supposed to say, ""I love it!"" but that doesn't seem an appropriate response to a movie about such harrowing events and circumstances.  It's hard to shake the notion nowadays -- especially in the age of Pixar and bromances -- of movies as anything but entertainment, but you have to do that as best you can with a film like this.  Poldek Socha (Robert Wi'ckiewicz) is no Oskar Schindler, with his wealth and social connections to the Nazis.  Socha is a sewer inspector in Lvov, who discovers a group of Jews -- and extended family, in effect -- during an inspection.  They have created an entrance to the sewers from their house, and escape into them just as a round-up is beginning in the ghetto.  Basically, he allows himself to be bribed by them, but when they run out of money, he doesn't cease to help them.  There are risks for him, of course, for the Polish authorities are cooperating with the Nazis and suspect that the sewers are being used.  Luckily, they don't suspect Socha -- at least not until it's too late.  Visually, the movie does a superb job of creating a sense of the dank filth and claustrophobia of the sewers.  There are Hollywood-ish moments -- the big rainstorm that pulls Socha away from his daughter's first communion because he realizes the threat it poses to the Jews is perhaps the most obvious one, and very suspenseful it is.  The cost to Socha is suggested powerfully, especially in the wake of his killing of a German soldier, but most engagingly in the representation of the relationship between Socha and his wife, Wanda (Kinga Preis), who instinctively feels for the Jewish victims of the Nazi occupation but is frightened and worried by her husband's growing commitment to them.  After the rainstorm, Wanda, angry at Socha's leaving the communion service, walks out -- the house is empty when Socha returns, tired and stressed.  The scene between them when she walks in is wonderfully and credibly played, testimony to the way the characters have been represented throughout.

Underground, the early bickering and tensions related to status among the Jews soon gives way to a serious focus on survival.  There's a love interest that develops, there are children who get lost, and a baby is born. And if rats in the slimy dark freak you out, prepare to be freaked.  As plot elements, some of these might strike the viewer as standard narrative shaping that is perhaps more a matter of convention rather than truth, but visually none of it is glamorized, and such scenes create focuses of empathy that perhaps a more documentary treatment could not manage.  The alternations of stoic endurance, near-hysteria, depression, sexual frustration -- it's all there.  And in Socha and Wanda, we have characters who just do the right things without theorizing about it -- they just keep on doing, for when they stop to reflect, they tend to tell themselves they're crazy, so they stop reflecting.  On the Jews' side, there is a developing of trust with Socha that takes time, and there are interpersonal tensions among themselves that aren't sentimentally resolved in every case.  All in all, I found it moving, absorbing, and very well put together by Agnieska Holland.  The filming in the sewers, which seeks to do justice to the literal darkness while still letting us see enough, is very well managed.  Jolanta Dylewska was the cinematographer and deserves great credit for her work.",1440201600,,3430,4.839041095890411

It was the battle not just of saving the Jews but for this somewhat callous man to save himself by deciding what it truly right in life and by amassing the courage to risk your life to save those who do not deserve to die.  Sometimes people set out to do something heroic, and other times heroism finds the person.  This movie was truly the case of the latter.  With that said, the film was dark, literally and figuratively.  The underground scenes were hard see people in, and the sex and violence were quite horrific.

4992030,3,B006IW8DTO,"After reading ""In the Sewers of Lvov"" by Robert Marshall and ""The Girl in the Green Sweater"" by Kristine Keren (both of which I heartily recommend), I became convinced that the story of the Lvov sewer rescue headed by Leopold Socha was one of the great stories of the 20th Century. It is really one of the defining stories of the Holocaust--it is so brutal, but so amazingly human as well. So, it was with great anticipation that I watched ""In Darkness""--and I felt tremendously let down. If the director had just had the common sense to tell the absolute TRUTH of what happened, I am convinced that the movie would have been far more successful than it was. Why invent characters and leave out powerfully moving details that are COMPLETELY TRUE? Example: the movie portrayed Ignacy Chiger as a retiring, nervous man when he really was an EXTRAORDINARY person whose sheer will kept his family intact and saved them (with the great help of Leopold Socha). Further, Leopold Socha is an AMAZING man--any decent movie should focus on what MOTIVATED him to save 10 complete strangers, and continuing to risk his life (and that of his wife and daughter) to do so after their money ran out. In reality, Socha's background was as an orphan and he was a poorly educated thief, for goodness sakes! I really believe that the director didn't want to credit the main reason that Socha did it--religion. I'll give one example of a powerful scene that was left out of the movie: the little 5-year-old child, Pavel Chiger, had a bad throat problem, and his mother mentioned that she so wished that she had some eggs and sugar to help him; Socha heard this and found the eggs and sugar (very tough items to find during the war), and returned at great time and risk to bring them to the family. What compassion and humanity in the depths of war, coming from a man who had been a fairly hardened criminal! The amazing thing about this story is that there are multiple sources that can confirm what actually happened, so why this film sees a need to INVENT anything, is utterly beyond my comprehension. I do applaud the movie for bringing this intensely compelling story to a wider audience--I just hope that a more authentic movie will be made in the future--because the TRUTH of what happened will move audiences FAR FAR more than the unfortunate amount of baloney contained in this film. Schindler's List is a compelling story and a fine movie, but Leopold Socha's rescue of Jews is even more powerful and would be so compelling in the hands of a truthful filmmaker.",1392336000,7,2549,4.65410199556541

IN DARKNESS is enhanced by excellent acting with excellent scripts: These characters are all very real. By necessity, of course, a huge portion of the film takes place in the sewers themselves, never once venturing outside the immediate area of Lvov. I sometimes wished for some view of what was happening in the war outside--a few brief news flashes or something. Yet, the focus on this claustrophobic setting certainly affords some empathy with the Jews in hiding, which was probably deliberate on the part of the film's creators. 145 minutes long with some fairly uneventful sequences, IN DARKNESS requires some patience; nevertheless, I think that something important would have been lost with much shortening of this film.

The Special Features, particularly the interview with the real-life Krystyna Chiger, extraordinarily well-played by Milla Bankowicz in the film itself, are definitely worth watching afterward.",1364428800,,1990,6.129032258064516
4992089,4,B006IW8DTO,"This largely excellent film relates the true story of what happened in tne Nazi-occupied former eastern Polish city of Lvov when the Germans decide to empty the Jewish ghetto in 1943. A group of Jews breaks into the sewers from the basement of their building and the first person they meet is Polish sewer inspector Leopold Socha (wonderfully portrayed by Robert Wieckiewicz), who agrees to protect them in return for money. He leads the group to a stinking underground cellar where they must deal with the dark, the filth, numerous rats and boredom as well as the stress of knowing they could be betrayed at any point. Socha extorts a high price from the group and fires off anti-Semitic insults when they complain about their plight. People in the film variously speak Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, German and Yiddish, reflecting just how uneasily mixed together the population was. Socha relies for protection on a revolting Ukrainian colonel, a rabid Jew-hater who thinks the Nazis are the best thing to ever happen to the city. Socha has to remain friendly enough with the colonel to stay safe while distracting the officer as he hunts the refugees he knows must be hiding underground somewhere. The colonel's men and the Nazis are casually brutal and think nothing of executing (or threatening to execute) anyone who is in the slightest bit inconvenient. At one stage Socha tells the group he is fed up with their whining and will desert them, since his double life is becoming too dangerous. Gradually though he starts to consider the Jews as people he must protect and keeps on feeding and protecting them, even when their money runs out.

The film though is partly let down by a script that verges on the simplistic. At the start of the film Socha's wife tells him that Jews are good people who deserve to be treated as well as anyone else - this at a time when Poles' attitudes towards the large Jewish population were complex and conflicted, to say the very least. In the cellar, one of the escapees says German troops will die in Stalingrad, even though the battle had ended months before the ghetto was emptied. At the very end, when the survivors emerge from the sewers and blink at the son, Socha's wife turns up with a cake to celebrate their survival and you'd think you were watching a birthday party. Odd moments like this detract from but fortunately do not undermine a powerful film.",1363046400,3,2402,4.7601918465227815

4992091,4,B006IW8DTO,"I loved director Agnieszka Holland's ""Europa, Europa"" which is a fact-based drama recounting the wartime exploits of a young Jewish teen, Jupp ( portrayed by Marco Hofschneider), who loses members of his family in Nazi occupied Europe, spends some time in a Bolshevik orphanage, and finally ends up amongst the Nazis, masquerading as an Aryan. Though it's been many years since I've watched ""Europa, Europa"", I remember it as being a nail-biter, full of suspenseful moments.

""In Darkness"" is another Holocaust-themed Polish drama (English subtitles are available) by the same director and proved to be another riveting and suspenseful watch. Written by David F. Shamoon, the story is based on factual events described in the book, ""In the Sewers of Lvov"" by Robert Marshall. The central character in this story is Poldek (Robert Wieckiewicz), a man who has made a wartime career out of stealing and looting from abandoned homes. One day, he and his criminal pal, Szczepek (Krzysztof Skonieczny) are stashing their loot in the sewers when they stumble upon a couple of Jews who have dug a hole into the sewers and are planning to hide out in there. This has become a necessity as the Nazis and their Ukrainian underlings are liquidating the ghetto on daily basis and measures are being stepped up to exterminate the Jews. Always the opportunist, Poldek sees this as a money-making enterprise and convinces his younger sidekick to go along with the scheme. He agrees not to give the Jews away on condition that they pay him 500 zloty a day. When the time comes for the final liquidation of the ghetto, Poldek shows up to help the Jews, numbering around twelve or so in all. Poldek's job though is not made any easier when an ex-prison mate named Bortnik (Michal Zurawski) shows up, now donning the uniform of the Ukrainian militia.

The story is set primarily in darkness, matching the title of the movie. Some of the most intense scenes take place under cover of darkness and shows how humans can be stretched to their limits under the most trying and horrifying of circumstances. Poldek's Jews (I refer to them as such because there are many other Jews who escaped into the tunnels, but only a couple were chosen to be guided to safety under Poldek's supervision and protection) are a mixed lot - the homewrecker, the adulterous husband who chooses his mistress over his wife and daughter, the spirited young man, the upper class Jewish couple, a grieving sister, and many more.

The movie is compelling for several reasons - it was interesting to see how Poldek's character evolves from a purely mercenary character to one who begins to help the Jews out of a sense of moral obligation. The Jews in hiding also show their individual personalities and try to exercise their natural human instincts - children singing to while away the time in the dank, filth encrusted tunnels, a couple engaging in furtive and desperate coupling, a woman pleasuring herself, these and many other scenes are haunting and stark, conveying the desperation of the time.

The lead actor's strong performance and the dramatic cinematography with the stark interplay between light and darkness makes this a compelling and touching movie.",1361750400,3,3215,4.937153419593345
4992092,5,B006IW8DTO,"This a Polish language film with English subtitles that is really well done.  There's plenty of occupied Europe during World War II movies out there, but this one stands out for two reasons.  One it isn't afraid to hold back on the viewer experiencing the struggles, fear, apprehension, and moral dilemmas of both the Jewish victims as well as the Polish citizens who if they choose to hide or even help their Jewish neighbours, will not only be killed themselves but so will their children as well.  The tension portrayed by the actors and the understanding the misery of the living conditions is done extremely well by whoever made the sets, as is the decision to film the stuff underground with little light (obviously it would have been darker in real life but I don't think any viewer would complain about this artistic licence needed to allow enough lighting to see what is going on).

The other reason In Darkness works is because when telling the story, they don't make the hero out to be a saint with no faults.  In fact initially Leopold Soha is on the bad side of the ledger as a thief pilfering houses and hiding stuff in the sewers to sell after the war .  He also initially decides to hide a group of Jewish people not because it is the right thing to do, but as a way to take their money.  Of course his conscience kicks in over the fourteen months but still the fact that these Polish filmmakers are prepared to make a film about one of their own hero citizens where the character stills has realistic faults makes this a better movie in my opinion. Hollywood, UK and Australian movies, we just don't like to speak ill of our heroes when telling a tale, especially a war one, our filmmakers (and even history teachers) much prefer to take a romanticised view of someone, maybe afraid of the backlash for that person's family or who knows what the reason is, I guess that's just our culture.  Recently I watched a similar true tale set in Warsaw made for US TV called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Courageous-Heart/dp/B003Q3FCW4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Courageous Heart</a>, about Irena Sendler who also used the sewers to help Jewish people (especially children) escape the Ghettos and the train to the concentration camps. Anna Paquin did a good job but that character was faultless throughout the entire film.  I think the fact that the Polish were prepared to make one of their heroes a bit more everyday human, over how the Americans did for the Polish hero in their movie, made In Darkness a better movie and one you could more put yourself in their shoes and wonder what you would do, because you could relate to this more authentic portrayal.  I'm not saying Courageous Heart isn't a good movie and worth watching, it is, but the viewer just seems to experience more in understanding the hardships and terror outcomes possible with choosing to help hide the Jewish people with In Darkness, from the way it was made.

In Darkness is set in the Polish town of Lvov and is certainly one of the best films dealing with this topic.  Don't be put off by the fact you need to read a good movie.  You really don't even notice you are reading subtitles after a while.",1360540800,,3233,4.741532976827094

4992098,5,B006IW8DTO,"One of the heroes to emerge from Poland during World War II was a man named Leopold Socha, a Polish sewer worker from Lwow who used his knowledge of the city's sewer systems to shelter the Jews from Nazi Germany and the Ukranians who collaborated with them.

The story of Leopold Socha would be written by Robert Marshall in 1990 in the book ""In the Swers of Lvov"" which received a film adaptation courtesy of director Agnieszka Holland and screenwriter David F. Shamoon.

Considered as one of the most prominent Polish filmmakers, Agnieszka Holland had worked on films such as ""Europa Europa"", ""Olivier, Olivier"" and ""The Secret Garden"". In America, she had worked on TV series such as ""The Wire"" and ""Cold Case"" and also collaborated with Krzsztof Kieslowski for the screenplay on the film ""Three Colors: Blue"".

With her work with ""In Darkness"", the film would receive rave reviews from film critics worldwide and would be one of the five nominees up for ""Best Foreign Language Film"" at the 84th Academy Awards.

VIDEO:

""In Darkness"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  While there are several scenes that are shot outdoors, the majority of the scenes are shot inside the sewer system or inside the home of Leopold Socha. So, one can expect to see a lot of black and very little light.

For the shots in the sewer, black levels are nice and deep and just enough lighting from flash lights or lanterns to feature the family members in hiding.  There is a good amount of clarity to show the grime on the characters, close ups are highly detailed and outdoor sequences looked very good, I didn't detect any banding or artifacts while watching this film.  Overall, video quality was great!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""In Darkness"" is presented in Polish 5.1 DTS-HD MA.  The musical soundtrack is wonderful while dialogue is crystal clear, there was good use of surround to showcase the ambiance.  From the water drips in the sewer, rats running through the tunnels to the sounds of a cathedral or noises from outdoors, ambiance plays a big part of this film.  There are also films of gunshots and mine blasts but ""In Darkness"" is primarily a dialogue-driven film and for this film, the lossless soundtrack is perfect!

Subtitles are in English and English SDH.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""In Darkness"" comes with the following special features:

  An Evening with Agnieszka Holland - (29:23) A moderated Q&A featuring Anne Thompson fielding audience questions to filmmaker Agnieszka Holland answers questions regarding the film, the production and post-production of the film and more.
  In Light: A Conversation with Agnieszka Holland and Krystyna Chiger - (28:01) A fantastic interview between filmmaker Agnieszka Holland and one of the Jews saved by Leopold Socha, Krystyna Chiger.  A fantastic interview featuring deleted scenes but also the film festival in which Holland introduces Chiger to the audience.
  Theatrical Trailer - (2:02) The theatrical trailer for ""In Darkness"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

I've watched quite a few films within the last year that dealt with Nazi occupation and genocide but I have never watched a film like ""In Darkness"" and because it is a true story and that the sole survivor of this entire experience, Krystyna Chiger, is still alive and validated Agnieszka Holland's film as being authentic (even though Holland never knew that there was a survivor from the sewers of Lvov).

The opening moments of the film and seeing many Jewish people, families, young children being gunned down, to naked women running through the forests from their Nazi aggressors and then seeing a shot of all women massacred, to the many men who were forced to crawl like dogs to their camps, there are images that resonates strongly within you.  Images that bring Holland's film to life.

But through this film, we see the journey of Leopold Socha, while a Polish sewer worker and he and his wife were both awarded the titled of ""Righteous among the Nations"" (an honorific title for non-Jews who risked thier lives during the Holocaust to save Jews) by Yad Vashem in Israel, the film shows how Socha's original desire was to make money off the Jews because of his knowledge of the sewer system.  He is a flawed character but at the same time, for anyone who has a heart, there is redemption.  Losha was a man who brought these people hope, even at the risk of him or his family being killed.

We see the change from a man who wanted to use the Jews he hid to take care of his family but then a change when he sees how fragile they are, the stench of death that surrounds the city and seeing close and personal but learning that he had the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of these 10 individuals and also the children that were with them.

While other films have shown much more dread when it comes to the hiding of Jews from the Nazi's, ""In Darkness"" shows us the will of those wanting to survive but also those who were not willing to stay in the sewers and would rather take their chances of fate in the camps.

Holland goes to great lengths is showing how those hiding in the sewers lived a life of uncertainty, unsanitary conditions, always knowing that the Nazi's and Polish collaborators were always going to be searching in the sewers for any Jews, but also showing how loved one can be intimate, even when there were people around in close proximity, no matter how uncomfortable it may seem.  And we see many heartbreaking moments as families are separated from families and one pregnant woman among those hiding in the sewer, having to make a decision of what to do with her newborn.

There is no doubt that ""In Darkness"" is a heartbreaking film, a powerful film.  Yes, there are other films that goes even further in showing us the tragedy of the Holocaust, films such as ""Schindler's List"" that are extremely powerful and heartbreaking, but in the case of ""In Darkness"", it's a heartbreaking but moving film that is not only based on a true story, it's a different take of one man who risked his life to save a group of people and not banal at all.

Was there anything that I disliked or had some doubts about the film?  Probably one instance but not sure if its fact or fiction.  It revolved around Mundek Marguilies wanting to see if his girlfriend (or wife), Kiara Keller's sister is alive in the camps.  Kiara's sister was one of the people who went into the sewers but was the one who was forced to go inside, when she didn't want to be there.  She was the first to run away from the sewers and take her chances and was taken to a concentration camp.

In the scene, Mundek leaves the sewers to attempt to bring Kiara's sister back to the sewers, so he sneaks into a concentration camp with other men under tight security by the Nazis.  Because of the many armed Nazi soldiers all around, I'm not sure if he was able to go in and escape the camp so easily (otherwise many others would have done the same).  So, it made me wonder if this actually did happen or not.  That was probably the only instance where I questioned the film.

As for the Blu-ray release, ""In Darkness"" is a film that looks amazing on Blu-ray.  Picture quality is great, the lossless audio is good but this is a film that deals with ambiance from within the sewer system, so dialogue is clear, you can hear water running through the surround channels and surrounding noises from the city that can be heard underground.  And as for the special features, the one-on-one discussion between Krystyna Chiger and Agnieszka Holland was fantastic, especially when you find out that Holland never knew there were any survivors while making this film, until after... she found out the little girl she had featured in her film was still alive.  And the featurette does show Holland introducing Chiger to an audience for its first screening.

Overall, ""In Darkness"" is another magnificent film in the oeuvre of filmmaker Agnieszka Holland.  A film with an incredible message of hope, persistence and the human will to survive.  Highly recommended!",1352419200,,8042,4.7309899569583935
4992099,5,B006IW8DTO,"You may be saying how many more movies can they milk out of the Holocaust? How about a movie on more up-to-date genocidal atrocities like the war in Central Africa in the '90s thru the '00s?

Well, fret not. It took the Poles to produce one of the best war movies let alone one that takes a well-known story--the Nazi ghettoization of the Jews in Warsaw and subsequent purge sending them all to the concentration camps...or did they send all? That is what this movie is about--those Jewish survivors and their Polish ""helpers"" who saved them (at first for profit and only later for humanitarian reasons).

The movie pretty much takes place in the sewers beneath the Warsaw ghetto and city center where the Jews were kept hidden for over a year and a half until the Russians liberated Poland in 1945. The actors are all first rate as is the sets which seem so realistic. The drama is very intense at times and there are some great twists both sad and filled with relief as well.

Finally, the lone extra called ""In Light"" pairs the director with one of the actual survivors (at that time a young girl and now, of course, a much older woman). This is well worth watching as both speak in English and maybe it's because it's not their native language you'll definitely be even more moved by their conversation. Just bring some Kleenex along for that.",1350518400,,1347,4.5578512396694215
4992100,4,B006IW8DTO,"The name of Agnieszka Holland is, or was, something special to me. Back in early 1990s I watched some of her works including ""Europa Europa,"" ""Olivier, Olivier"" and ""The Secret Garden,"" and was fascinated by the Polish-born director's skills in creating characters that are all too human. But something happened to her films since then -""Total Eclipse,"" ""Washington Square"" and ""Copying Beethoven"" - they all look gorgeous, but something was missing. Something like soul.

Nominated for Oscar (Best Foreign Language Film), ""In Darkness"" is based on a true story of Leopold Socha, a WW2-era sewer worker-turned-petty thief in the Nazi-occupied city of Lww, Poland (today's Lviv, Ukraine), who decided to hide the Jewish families in the city's sewer system. His original motive was for money - and he could have ""sold"" them to the Nazi - but Socha chooses to protect them no matter what it takes.

Concealing fugitives turns out more difficult than Socha thought, especially when he has his own wife and daughter to live with. For the Jewish families, hiding in the rat-infested sewer is far from comfortable. ""In Darkness"" they both have to overcome the numerous challenges that seem not to end, and through the process they show not only heroic acts, but weakness.

""In Darkness"" is Agnieszka Holland's best film since her stunning ""Europa Europa,"" another Holocaust-themed, based-on-truth movie. The film is overlong and its story melodramatic, but is worth checking out for the credible central character and claustrophobic photography of the dim-lit sewer.",1350259200,,1559,5.253012048192771

4992103,5,B006IW8DTO,"So many Holocaust movies: ""Schindler's List,"" ""The Reader,"" ""Shoah,"" ""Europa Europa.""

I knew ""In Darkness"" would be frightening, depressing, and disturbing.

So, I didn't want to watch ""In Darkness.""

Big mistake. ""In Darkness"" is a masterpiece. It's better than ""Schindler's List."" Yes, it is disturbing to watch, but it is great art, and great art, even as it moves us to tears, rewards us. You already know about the horrors of the Holocaust. The gift of ""In Darkness"" is that it transports the viewer to a better realm, where the best of humanity shines in the worst darkness we humans have produced. That best of humanity is not just Socha, the rescuer, but the filmmakers who, through their art, tell the world Socha's story.

""In Darkness"" has a verisimilitude, indeed a ""darkness,"" that other Holocaust films do not. No one in this movie would look appropriate placed on a pedestal. Everyone here - Jews and rescuers - is a deeply flawed human being. The Jews hiding in the sewers look and act the way people hiding in sewers would look - filthy, hungry, and bedraggled; they are sometimes petty, jealous, and vengeful. The film is dark and claustrophobic. The Nazis are not sexy and thrilling. They are murderous scum. Not only do characters speak Polish, Yiddish, German, Ukrainian, and Russian, where appropriate, they also spoke Balak, a dialect typical of Poles living in Lwow. Krystyna Chiger, who survived the sewer, said she found the film so real it was hard to watch.

None of the actors are well known outside of Poland or Germany, so I was able to invest in them as the characters they were playing in a way that I could never invest in ""Schindler's List,"" which, of course, featured big stars I'd seen in other films - Ralph Fiennes, the handsome lover from ""The English Patient,"" was suddenly giving an Oscar-bait performance as a fat Nazi; Ben Kingsley was no longer Gandhi, but a Jew in a concentration camp.

Robert Wieckiewicz as Leopold Socha gives one of the very best, most absorbing, most believable film performances I have ever seen. Wieckiewicz is utterly believable as a petty thief who makes one right choice that leads him onto a path that awakens his soul. He starts out as a rough guy, an opportunist, who isn't ready to be as cruel as life invites him to be. The Nazis are paying bonuses to anyone who turns in Jews. Socha, already a petty criminal, who had initially helped Jews for money, could have made the choice to hand Jews over to the Nazis, for even more money. He didn't. He decided to do the next kind thing. And the next. And the next. And he becomes of the most moving, heroic people you will ever see onscreen. If Socha's entirely believable transformation doesn't make you cry ... you are tougher than I am.

Benno Furmann is especially memorable as Mundek Margulies, one of the Jews who escapes to the sewers. Furmann has pale blue eyes that shine out intensely in the dark sewer scenes, communicating outrage, sorrow, panic, and caged macho. The tense dynamic between him and Socha electrifies their scenes. Theirs is a male-male relationship utterly beyond what any current Hollywood ""buddy"" movie could hope to portray.

Kinga Preis is quietly moving as Wanda Socha, Leopold's plump and freckled, earth-goddess wife. Maria Schrader as one of the Jewish women in hiding adds poignancy without doing anything showy. Michal Zurawski as Bortnik, a Ukrainian who does the dirty work for the Nazis, is very handsome sickening, and terrifying. You can see that Socha could have turned out like his old friend Bortnik. But, somehow, he didn't. Why? Because Bortnik was Ukrainian, not Polish - and thus treated differently by the Nazis? Because Bortnik was more handsome? We don't know. We just get the sense that before he made the one choice that set him on a path that would turn him into a beast, Bortnik was probably much like his old pal, Socha.

""In Darkness"" is a feature film, not history lesson or a documentary, but for this viewer it dramatized aspects of the Holocaust, and of humanity, that other Holocaust films have failed to adequately address, or to address at all.

I've never seen a film that brought home to me so vividly the mass killings of Poles that Nazis carried out. Of course I know about these killings, but, as Joseph Stalin allegedly said, ""One death is a tragedy. A million deaths is a statistic."" ""In Darkness"" depicts a mass hanging of randomly selected Polish civilians, killed in retaliation for the death of a German. This scene was orchestrated in such a way that it grabbed me as dry statistics on the page never have.

""In Darkness"" defies revisionist histories of World War Two that insist that Poles did nothing to help Jews and that Poles were enjoying the high life during the Nazi occupation. ""In Darkness"" makes clear - Nazis treated Poles with special brutality. Dramatic tension is never lost, even as the viewer learns something he would never learn from something like ""Schindler's List.""

""In Darkness"" focuses on a Pole who rescued Jews. This defies popular uses of the Brute Polak stereotype to rewrite World War Two history.

Never for one minute, though, does ""In Darkness"" stop being a big, involving, tense, movie-movie. You care about the characters. You are swept along by the action. You hold your breath during scenes of suspense. You root for success. You tear up when things go wrong. After all that has gone before, the final scene, as humble as it is, is overwhelming. This is just a great film. See it.",1349308800,4,5518,4.777544596012592

Rating: 4.5 out of 5.0

Like 'Schindler's List', 'In Darkness' is told from the perspective of the survivors. And since there were so few survivors of the Holocaust, it's been said that such a perspective gives the wrong impression about what the Holocaust was all about. Are we to draw a message of hope when hope was extinguished in the vast majority of cases? In other words, the survivors were the exception to the rule. Still, it's through the perceptions of the survivors that we can gain an inkling of what the Holocaust was about.

Veteran director Agnieszka Holland wisely made the decision to film 'In Darkness' in the native languages of the characters. Hence, its verisimilitude feels superior to such English language films as Schindler's List. Most critics agree that Leopold Socha, the petty thief and sewer worker who saved the lives of 11 Jews, who spent over a year in the sewers of Lvov, Poland (now Lviv, Ukraine), is a complicated, well scripted character. When we first meet him, he's completely surprised when his wife Wanda informs him that Jesus was Jewish. What's more, his comment, ""Give a Jew a finger and he'll take your arm"", is pretty typical of many of his fellow countrymen at the time. Socha may harbor some basic prejudices, but what motivates him is pure profit. Hence, he has no problem risking his own life, as long as there's the potential for significant financial remuneration.

Similarly, the Jewish characters are hardly depicted as saints either. Janek chooses his mistress Chaja over his wife and children when he enters the sewers. We meet Mundek, a hustler, who we see early on get punched in the face by a Polish man, who's angry for selling him a counterfeit watch. Klara is seen beating her younger sister, Mania, who wants to return to the ghetto with the full knowledge that the Germans are in the process of wiping out her neighbors on the streets above. More less than stellar behavior emerges including Janek having sex with his mistress while the other survivors can see and hear them in their beds, and Janek and a compatriot abandoning the group and leaving Chaja, who ends up concealing her pregnancy and then smothering her baby.

Some critics felt 'In Darkness' employed too many underdeveloped, 'stock' characters, where only Janek turns out be the true 'villain' amongst the sewer dwellers. Even Mundek, adopts the heroic mantle, when he leaves the sewers to search for Klara's missing sister. And the Chigers, with their two cute kids, prove to be closest to saintliness in the depiction of the Jewish victims here. Nonetheless, I would argue that the characterizations of Socha's 'Jews' are less important than the film's plot, which moves along like a suspense thriller, not only educating us about the mechanics of the Holocaust, but conveying the sheer terror which the survivors experienced.

The film's exposition neatly provides us with a series of iconic images that set the stage for more and more horrors to come. After Socha and his partner, Saczepek, burglarize the German officer's home and make their escape, they can't avoid catching a glimpse of a group of naked Jewish women being forced to run through the forest at the behest of German soldiers pointing machine guns at them; gunshots are heard and we see all the women lying dead in a field. Next cut to the ghetto, where German soldiers cut and tear off the beard of a religious Jew, who screams in pain. Even more importantly, we're introduced to Socha's ex-prison buddy, Bortnik, now a member of a Ukrainian militia, collaborating with the Nazis. The film makes the important point that in the Eastern European countries, often members of the local populace were directly responsible for doing the Germans' dirty work.

Perhaps the most disturbing scene in the film is the liquidation of the ghetto. Holland brilliantly conveys the horror first from Socha and Saczepek's perspective. As they run through the sewers, we can hear the machine gun blasts and screams of terror from above. Only then does the camera shift upward (as if we've penetrated through to the street) and we're able to see what's going on above. Holland then focuses on Klara running to find her children--she only has time to catch glimpses behind her, as various people have already been killed or are in the process of being mowed down.

What will grip you about 'In Darkness' is how the stakes are continually raised from scene to scene: Socha's 'Sophie's Choice' decision to save only 11 people; Socha almost being mistaken for a Jew by Ukrainian militiamen and saved by Bortnik; Mania's disappearance; Bortnik informing Socha about the smell of onions in a toilet and then almost finding Socha's group; Socha finding the other group dead; Janek's breakdown; Mr. Chiger's revelation about the jewelry; Janek leaving the group; Mundek choking Socha; Mundek and Socha killing the German; Socha finding the children (which which leads to his transformation); Socha finding Sczepek hanged following the German's reprisals; the discovery by the Polish man of Socha's group and how he moves them to a new location; Mundek almost getting killed by the German officer and then sneaking into the work camp; Choja killing her baby; The flood and Socha's final confrontation with Bortnik, leading to the arrival of the Russians and the group's liberation.

Not everything works in the film. For example, how does Socha happen to be in the right place and the right time twice? (at the very moment Mundek is discovered by the German soldier and when he also overhears the Polish man screaming about how he's found Jews in the sewer).

The cast is quite strong, including Robert Wieckiewicz who's completely believable as the tough and bigoted sewer worker turned righteous Gentile. Being half-Catholic and half-Jewish, director Holland has sympathy for all the victims here but never sugarcoats reality. 'In Darkness' is a disturbing film which needs to be seen.",1347148800,2,6004,4.965174129353234

4992111,5,B006IW8DTO,"This is based on the true story of Leopold Socha (Robert Wieckiewicz) who during war torn Poland worked as a sewer inspector in the Polish town of Lvov (it is now Ukrainian called Lviv). He supplemented his income by burglarising houses and selling the goods on the black market - this included many former houses of the Jews that had been sent to the ghettos or worse.

Then the Nazis come to take everyone, the Jews have anticipated this and had already seen the sewer as a sort of refuge. Socha and his accomplice have already seen this as a possible way to make money, so they strike a bargain with the Jews that in return for payment that they will be looked after. What started out as a money making scheme soon becomes something more for Socha as he sees the terrible events unfold as the war staggers to its ultimate conclusion.  We also get to see the brutal effects of even `casual collaboration' and the arbitrary `justice' meted out by the occupiers.

This is a Polish, German and Canadian co production and is in Polish, German, Yiddish and Ukrainian so obviously is sub titled, but this should not put you off. All of the performances are compelling and the tension and fear is palpable through out. The creeping madness of being shut in a sewer for months is not covered up and the filth is omnipresent. One can only begin to imagine how horrific it must have been. Socha and his family were named as ""Righteous among the Nations"" by Yad Vashem in Israel for their efforts.

This is not a war film in the normal sense but is a tale of true heroism and suffering that is caused by war and is a brilliant compliment to the many new films that are being made about the struggles of ordinary people caught up in a war they did not understand and showing extraordinary ability to overcome the situations they are forced in - highly recommended.",1342569600,3,1854,4.492581602373887
4992112,3,B006IW8DTO,"Positives:
A well researched book provided the storyline for this movie in which 21 Jews in a small, what was then Polish town, attempt to escape imprisonment and possibly death from Nazi occupiers by living in the sewer catacombs beneath their town. With the help, and a bit of bribery at first, of a Catholic Polish sewer worker they subsisted for 14 months until the Nazi retreat from the approaching Soviet troops. Eventually ten survived to be able to see the light of freedom.
What is most interesting is that neither the author of the source book or the film's director were aware during planning and production that there was one survivor still alive, and that she too was not aware of either the book or the movie.

Negatives:
The movie's script almost seemed to whitewash and/or ignore Catholic Pole and Ukrainian Nazi collaboration.
I am wary of stories that paint a simplistic and generalized ""black and white"" portrait of human nature and in this case to show all the German soldiers as sadistic, if not evil, killers unusually frequently of women and children, and then to show the  Jewish population as almost saintly. Albeit, the atrocities of the Holocaust permit some liberties in retelling that period. Be that as it may, that license seems to have carried to our present times in the subjugation and impoverished strangulation of the Palestinians by Israel. Irony of ironies!",1341532800,,1395,4.906779661016949
4992113,4,B006IW8DTO,"Based on true events which took place in the Polish city of Luvov in WW2, this gruelling arthouse film revisits the emotional and factual territory familiar from Anne Frank's diary and Schindler's List. It seeks out rare fragments of human integrity and benevolence which have been all but extinguished under the Nazi boot in occupied territory. It is not a nice film, and the story is frighteningly familiar.
When the Jewish ghetto in the city is liquidated, and the people are either shot on the spot or shipped to a labour camp, a group of Jews flee into the city's sewers. A neer-do-well sewer worker (who moonlights as a looter) discovers them and strikes a bargain: he'll feed and find a safe haven in the rat-infested, stinking hellhole for a dozen of them. And they must pay him to stay alive.
So begins an appalling underground incarceration which lasts for over a year and which rasps away every aspect of sophistication from the disparate group. At first the sight of a rat is enough to cause shrieking hysterics. Later, the children pluck the animals from their shoulders without a second thought. Yet despite the relentless tension and misery, the majority of the refugees retain their better qualities: on the whole they seek to protect, to nurture and to survive as a group. They may indeed be starving in darkness, but their lives are not without light.

Although `In Darkness' makes for stressful and occasionally grim viewing, it is not without its lighter moments of humour and blackly comic insight. In particular the scenes between Socha, the sewer worker who turns out to be the Jews' saviour, and his wife are entirely life-affirming. Acts of momentous bravery pass become almost unnoticed, when the most basic act of procuring food might reveal the secret and condemn another dozen lives.
There are also some heart-stopping segments where the Ukrainian occupying force or Nazi officers come close to discovering the truth. And the film throughout is punctuated with explicit violence, nudity, death and sex, handled in an entirely matter of fact manner. Anyone could be killed at any time: that's exactly how it was. And the film's portrayal of that fact shockingly stark.

This isn't a comfortable film to kick back and watch for relaxation. It reflects the grim determination of the protagonists to keep on living against all odds and inhuman cruelty. The filming and acting are so accomplished that they scarcely intruded into the audience's consciousness, we were so wrapped up with the fate of the hidden and their protector.
You're guaranteed an emotionally-charged encounter, if not an exactly enjoyable evening.

4992114,5,B006IW8DTO,"""In Darkness"" is a first-rate film based on the true World War Two story of how Jews hid from Nazis to try to survive in the sewer system of what was then the Polish city of Lvov; they were aided by Catholic Polish people living in Lvov. In the actual film, there is one man who risks his life to save a dozen Jews from certain death. The plot does begin a bit slowly; they could have edited out a few minutes here and there but then again the acting; sets; cinematography and casting were all so well done that this becomes a minor quibble.

When the film begins we meet several Jewish people in the Nazi-created ghetto in Lvov: among them are Paulina Chiger (Maria Schrader); her husband Ignacy (Herbert Knaup); their two children Krystyna (Milla Bankowicz) and Pawel (Oliwer Stanczak) and Yanek Grossman (Marcin Bosak). The Nazis have begun to systematically slaughter the Jews and in desperation Jews dig a secret hole so deep that it reaches into the city's sewer system. The Jews believe they might be able to hide in the sewers of Lvov to escape Nazi imprisonment and death until the war is over.

However, the Jewish people are ill prepared to exist for any length of time in a sewer system; and some of them are discovered by an anti-Semitic city sanitation worker named Leopold Socha (Robert Wieckiewicz). Leopold instantly senses the opportunity to exploit the Jews, taking all their money in exchange for protecting them and giving them a bit of food when he can. All Leopold really wants is lots of money for himself, his wife Wanda (Kinga Preis) and the rest of his family to live comfortably for the first time in quite a while. Of course, this is quite dangerous for Leopold; the Nazis are offering 500 zlotys for each Jew captured and if they ever discovered that Leopold was hiding Jews he, anyone helping him and his family would surely be killed. Leopold's friend Bortnik (Michal Zurawski) is just one of the people helping the Nazis catch and kill Jews.

There's more to the plot than what I've given you here; I assure you that the action begins to move along faster as the film progresses and there are suspenseful moments that are quite well done. I must also add that the film sometimes depicts graphic violence and anyone who is uncomfortable with that may want to think twice before getting this motion picture for their collection.

""In Darkness"" is essential viewing for anyone studying the Holocaust; Jewish history and World War Two in general. People who appreciate foreign dramas based on true events will not be disappointed by this picture. For a most personal, candid and detailed account of this true story, look up Mrs. Krystyna Chiger, the last living survivor of this experience; her comments shed light on the Jews' horrific 14 month life in the city's sewer system.",1340841600,3,2807,4.699186991869919

Amazingly, after the film was done, the director, Agnieszka Holland, discovered that a key character in the film version of this true WWII survival story--the little Jewish girl (Krysia Chiger)--was still alive.  The two women met in Warsaw in 2011, and their conversation is replayed in one of the film's supplemental features.  Here, Mrs. Krystyna Chiger-Karen  (she had married Marion Karen, a survivor who had been helped by Oskar Schindler)  spoke movingly about how ""everything"" that the director ""put into the film was true.""

Agnieszka Holland can go toe-to-toe with the best of today's international film directors, and ""In Darkness"" is a testament to that truth, as well.

The film does not give you some characters to like, and it dragged slowly, so I lost interest quickly.

The plan, to dig from a house above the sewer system into it; is a clever and promising start, which quickly falls apart for being an incomplete plan. In real life; the Jews would have been more cautious and cleverer and not broken through into the sewer beyond a peep-hole until they were ready to go, and would have gone at night instead of the daytime, and would have traveled through the sewer-system outside the ghetto to the edge of the city, and headed for the countryside, rather than hide in the sewer. I know the Jews had close, large, extended families, but the plan was doomed to fail with such a large, noisy, crowd of people going all at once.

The intent of the film is to show the immoral Poles extorting money from the Jews in return for not turning them in to the Germans; and in many cases only delaying such. The film never went anywhere.
