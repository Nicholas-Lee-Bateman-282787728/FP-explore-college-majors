8447151,1,B004XMBSUW,"I got this disk and it was virtualy unuasable, the back of the disk was like nothing I have ever seen, Im not even sure how to expalin it. The back looked horrible but I thought perhaps it was still usable since it was still a smooth surface no real scratches but I popped it in the DVD and nothing. It looked black and slpottchy on the back of the disk. Again I have no idea how to best discribe it.

However in the sellers defence I have gotten several other P90x disk that came from the same place that were in great condition this was the only product I bought that looked like this.",1356048000,,587,4.104347826086957
