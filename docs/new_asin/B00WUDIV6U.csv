8714313,3,B00WUDIV6U,"The film opens with young Angel killing a little girl and a psychic who apparently didn't see it coming. She is sentenced to life in prison. Due to circumstances we discover later, she (Jenn Murray) is released 15 years later and starts killing again which included flashbacks to her abused childhood. There are cops who are quietly trying to get her, which included a bad guy played by Christopher Sciueref who had one of the ugliest grills I have seen in the movies. The killings and stabbings were done off screen, all we got to see were the results. Minimum gore.

Based on the book ""Core of Evil"" by Nigel McCrery.",1483056000,,619,4.576576576576577
