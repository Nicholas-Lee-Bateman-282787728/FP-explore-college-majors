8743843,5,B01945D8VE,"Excellent pricing on two beautifully re-mastered Blu-rays sold as a set. Luminous monochrome on both. The Red House is not a film noir, more a borderline Gothic horror, but, nonetheless, highly enjoyable film of the late 1940s. Suddenly is pure film noir, with Frank Sinatra and Sterling Hayden. Zero extras. So what!",1509753600,,317,5.115384615384615

8743845,4,B01945D8VE,"The two movies in this package are very good copies, much better than any of the Public Domain copies that were put out over the last 20 years.  The aspect ratio on Suddenly is the correct one and the picture and sound quality are the best I seen. The Red House is the nicest copy of this film I have seen and it is a forgotten gem.
I only gave 4 stars because even though you get a DVD and a BD of each film at a very nice price they do not have SDH, even though they have Spanish subtitles.  All the discs have English CC but I have not been able to find how to activate CC on a BD player.  I do not believe they are required to have it.  If anyone who reads this can help me as far as activating CC on a BD player.  I have a Samsung, a Phillips and a LG BD player an none of them have anything int he menu about CC only Subtitle language on one of them.",1479254400,,856,3.7597765363128492
8743846,5,B01945D8VE,"EXCELLENT RECONSTRUCTION OF DAMAGED FILM, ESPECIALLY ""THE RED HOUSE"". GREAT FILM BUT FINALLY I COULD VIEW IT CLEARLY WITHOUT RUINING MY EYESIGHT.",1461369600,2,145,5.636363636363637
