8603133,5,B00EA3Y1UI,"Being a housewife will never be boring if you turn to this adorable program for some great tips on sparking up an evening, special occasion, or just because with that special someone.
After a cocktail and a luscious batch of chocolate macaroons, (which she provides the recipes for), its fun time! The video is shot in Peek-a-boos apartment which appears cozy and very pet friendly.
This program is fun and easy to follow along to. There is nothing really complicated about the routines, as there is no technique taught, simply follow along, so if you want technique, Peekaboo offers other instructional videos.
Aside from user friendly, you may use simple props you may already have at home such opera gloves, apron, oven mitt, pasties, sexy stockings and sexy high heels. Wherever the mood strikes, be it kitchen, dining room, or living room, the cute routines are so adorable and easy to learn. All three routines include a demonstration and step by step follow along instruction. They are divided into kitchen cook and dance routine, living room sip and dance, and the dining room is a fancy, sexy routine. The music is fantastic from Shim Sham Review, Music of New Orleans. Be it apron, oven mitt, or boa and sexy corset, this program will delight your special someone as you offer them a special drink, a sweet tart, and you!",1388448000,3,1331,4.816593886462882
8603134,3,B00EA3Y1UI,"Peekaboo Pointe's light, fun & down-to-earth personality alone makes this DVD fun to watch. When I saw the video clip, I was like ""Wow,"" I have to buy this and learn a few fun burlesque moves from this woman.

The beginning segments are about what Burlesque is & isn't, and a little bit of background about Peekaboo Pointe herself (she is the Stripper Housewife & what that means) lifestyle-cooking-sharing recipes. It's cute, light hearted, & fun. I enjoyed her persona. I was looking forward to learning the routines.

But when I got to the actual instructional for teaching the Burlesque moves, there were no actual dance moves taught. The content of the instruction consists of Peekaboo Pointe going through the motions of stripping down with commentary (about eye contact- touching your self, etc) to entice your partner for ""one on one"" contact in different parts of your home. I thought this was going to teach an actual burlesque dance rotuine (like a choreography) while stripping down. I guess I misunderstood the content of the video clip.

I wish I could have given it a better rating because Peekaboo Pointe, herself is really good-I love her. But the instructional content wasn't completely what I was looking for, unfortunately. That being said, even though, I would still recommend this to others- it's good DVD to buy if you are looking to learn some info & tips on how to ""take it off"" for your other half at home.",1388016000,6,1432,4.813008130081301
