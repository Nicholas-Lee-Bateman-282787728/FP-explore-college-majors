They tell you exactly why they do what they do and you will have some ""AH HA"" moments. They get down into some details that most hunters would not consider. They have a lot of detailed strategic and tactical knowledge. They let you know that these videos do not contain nearly the amount of details in their books, ""Precision Bowhunting"" and ""Bowhunting Pressured Whitetails"". These videos are very informative and engaging. But, because they are not comprehensive(they don't contain all the information), I gave them a 4-star rating instead of a 5-star. They are definitely worth the money if only to actually see on video how they execute some of their tactics. I'm looking forward to reading the books!",1312588800,,810,4.963235294117647

This is an education in the Art and Science of Bowhunting Whitetail deer. I am a licensed Hunting and Fishing Guide in New York and would recomend this series to any future clients and several of the past as well. Many of the tactics in the DVD's were discussed in the two books; Precision Bowhunting and Bowhunting Pressured Whitetails, but these DVD's let you ""See"" the techniques both through in-the-field examples and use of a whiteboard. I have changed location on 5 stands this week (2nd week of October 2007) based on what I have learned, and re-learned by watching the series. This series is great for the novice and the experienced hunter going through bowhunter burn-out. Some times you have to take a step back or to the side before you can move forward. If your serious about bowhunting, these DVD's are for you.
Don't buy these if you want to see 27 kills in 2.5 hours; buy them to increase your skills as a hunter in the ""real world of bowhunting.""",1192579200,7,1080,4.595854922279793
