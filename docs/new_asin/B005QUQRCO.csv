4860009,5,B005QUQRCO,"Jennifer Galardi will rock your socks off! Seriously though, I love her. She's fun, energetic, and I don't feel stupid or cheesey while doing one of her DVDs. Some reviews say her moves are too hard, I will admit, You do have to be a little coordinated (I have some-what of a dancing background so I may just pick up moves better, I don't kow) Anyways, the moves are a little tougher than a grapevine and other classic workout dance moves, this is because the routine she does isn't lame at all!! Its actually fun. The beauty of it is, its on a DVD, you can rewind, pause, even do it over as many times as you would like, nothing in this DVD is too hard that you could never do it, and not only that, its a workout DVD, its meant to be fun, so you can mess up and laugh at yourself in the privacy of your own living room. Don't take it too seriously.",1344902400,,850,4.095808383233533
4860010,4,B005QUQRCO,It took me a few tries (and even then if I get tired during the workout...) to get the steps but if you have done a few other workouts you should be okay. By the third segment my heart rate was way up and a nice change of pace from the usual weights or walking.,1343520000,,261,3.7636363636363637
4860011,1,B005QUQRCO,"This is not for beginner dancers like I thought, the moves are difficult to follow plus its hard to see how they are doing it (which leg). I'm not elderly or anything but this is hard to follow, I've done tae bo (which I like a lot) and zumba which are easier to follow than this. I'd rather turn the music up, dance myself and sweat it out, it would be a lot less complicated than this and much more fun.",1342137600,,405,4.012345679012346
4860012,5,B005QUQRCO,"I started a weight loss competition with my friend for 11 weeks, attempting to lose 20 lbs.  I had Cardio Hip Hop and enjoyed it and decided to see if Jennifer Gilardi had another one.  Bought this video and love it!  Its a really fun workout and very effective-I lost 19.2 pounds and alot of inches from my stomach and butt!  Love this CD!",1341446400,,340,4.265625

4860014,1,B005QUQRCO,"I gave this away after one try because the moves are too hard and fast for me to follow.  The routine might be great for young people who can dance, but it's not suitable for older, slower exercisers.",1330905600,2,200,4.2631578947368425
4860015,5,B005QUQRCO,I love love love dvd. This is probably my favorite of the 3 Hip Hop dance off the inches dvds. Jennifer really makes this a body blast workout. I didn't it yesterday and I can feel it in my arms and core today. This video is very fun and some of the moves are a bit challenging. This is a great workout that doesnt even feel like a workout :D,1330560000,,342,3.9
4860016,5,B005QUQRCO,"I absolutely love this exercise video--Jennifer makes working out enjoyable by building routines around hip hop dance. Her warm demeaner (picture Rachel Ray on the dancefloor instead of in the kitchen) and perfect cuing are so inspiring; Jennifer makes me feel like I'm dancing like a pro...even though I'm NOT a dancer by any stretch of the imagination. I have several of her videos and love them all--but this is the best.

4860017,4,B005QUQRCO,"Jennifer Galardi (the instructor in this DVD) has previously released two other hip hop DVDs in the ""Dance Off the Inches"" (DOTI) series:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dance-off-the-Inches-Hip-Hop-Party/dp/B000TJ6OZ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dance off the Inches: Hip Hop Party</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dance-Off-the-Inches-Cardio-Hip-Hop/dp/B003QLEARE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dance Off the Inches: Cardio Hip Hop</a>.  While I think that both of those workouts are superior to this one, I still have to concede that this is a highly effective cardio sculpting workout.

The DVD is broken down into six sections: Warm Up, To the Club, Groovin', Kick it Out, Cool Down, and Step Guide.  Here is my breakdown of each part of the DVD.

Warm Up - Jennifer does some easy light cardio dance moves to start the blood moving in your body.  She then moves into hip roles and chest isolations to warm up those respective parts of your body.  This section is short and to-the-point, getting you ready for the workout to come.

To the Club - This is by far the fast routine, and it's focused on teaching you fun, cardio dance moves that you can take to the club.  There aren't too many different moves to learn (about five), but they are all slightly complex authentic dance moves.  There are some sliding moves with your feet, some stomping steps, a few hip rocks and rolls, and some hops included in this routine.

Groovin' - In this routine, Jennifer slows down the tempo but tells you to emphasize your movements and really make them big.  There are definitely a larger variety in moves in ""Groovin'"", but none of them are extremely difficult. It's a more hard-hitting routine that will probably make you a little bit sore in the morning.  Moves included have you doing a lot of stomping and tapping to each side, some more hopping, a wiping motion with your arms going across your body, some lunges, ball changes, and single single double rhythms.  If you don't know any of the terms I'm talking about, don't worry; Jennifer will clearly explain everything in the step guide later.

Kick it Out - This is the final of the cardio workouts and is by far the most complex and difficult.  The movements taught here almost all have complicated rhythm changes, and I found myself messing up a lot.  These moves include kicking (obviously), twisting, complicated scuffing combos, and step touches with swinging arms.  I thought some of the transitions were a little bit awkward, but I still enjoyed being challenged in this workout.

Cool Down - This was fabulous.  The stretching included here was amazing; Jennifer expertly relaxes nearly every body part you just worked.  There's nothing else to say except that this was the perfect end.

Step Guide - This is a 20-minute tutorial where Jennifer breaks down some of the more difficult moves for those struggling to learn (or practice before ever starting the workout).  Jennifer will show you the move tempo before expertly dissecting each movement.  She starts with the feet, then moves to the arms, then puts both together slowly, and helps you master the movements.  She includes 2 moves from ""To the Club"", 4 moves from ""Groovin'"", and 4 moves from ""Kick it Out.""

Overall, I definitely got a great workout with this DVD, but I do have to admit I liked Jennifer's other DOTI workouts better.  This DVD isn't actually choreographed by her, so if you're expecting her signature moves, you won't get that here.  Regardless, you will still have a great time getting funky with the authentic dance moves taught in this effective workout.  I will definitely recommend it as a fun hip hop workout!

4860018,5,B005QUQRCO,This is a fun workout that you can put either minimum energy into or maximum energy for a full-body work out.  This is a much better alternative to typical aerobics and makes working out enjoyable!,1427328000,,197,4.628571428571429

4860020,4,B005QUQRCO,I appreciated the promptness of my order.  I loved the workout along with the step guide.,1408060800,,89,4.5625

4860022,2,B005QUQRCO,"I have three other videos of Jennifer Galardi's, and I LOVE them. They're super fun, she's a great instructor, really knows how to break down the moves so you can learn them easily. And, I usually really like her style of hip hop. Fun, playful, none of the more edgy, crotch-grabbing, hard street style that's raunchy dirty. She keeps it feminine and sexy.

So, I needless to say I was very excited when I saw this video at Target. I purchased it immediately and put it on as soon as I got home.

When I started watching it, I thought, WHA!?  What are these moves? Most of them don't even seem like dance, but more like just basic aerobics class moves. V step, V step with lifted arms, and other ""aerobicky"" moves. I quickly scanned through the whole thing and saw more of the same. Just weird. It didn't even seem like hip-hop to me. There were a couple sexier dancy moves in the entire thing but for the most part it was just completely blah and unoriginal, and I didn't even feel like I would be learning barely any actual dance moves with this one.

Anyway, I would give it one star, except like all her videos, the quality is great, her energy is great, and it's just a well done video apart from the actual dance part.

If you really know NO EVEN BASIC MOVES AT ALL, are extremely uncoordinated (I am NOT a dancer and have barely any experience and this still seemed like it would be unbearably boring to me) and need to start just with being able to get used to moving your body to rhythm, then this could be the video for you. Otherwise, try any of her other Dance off the Inches videos, which are fabulous.",1398211200,3,1615,4.316831683168317
4860023,3,B005QUQRCO,I have been a hip hop dancer for years so I ordered this thinking that it might keep my interest but its on the boring side.  Same thing over and over! If you are an experienced dancer this probably isn't for you and if you know nothing about dancing it's probably not for you either cause its very fast paced and hard to keep up with,1393545600,,334,4.0606060606060606
4860024,5,B005QUQRCO,"Dance Off The Inches videos are getting me through the winter!  I have three of them that I rotate through.  This one is the fastest paced so I would recommend trying Hip Hop Party first.  But even if you start with this one, Jen works through the moves one at a time and then combines them until you have the whole sequence.  The cuing is excellent, and the cool down is just right.  I had no idea when I started doing these videos what dancing regularly could do for my abs, it's amazing!  So much fun you don't feel like you're exercising.",1391212800,3,542,4.264705882352941
4860025,5,B005QUQRCO,"I spend 5-6 days a week with Jennifer and have been since I think 2008!  She took me from 185 to 155!  She calls the routine great, she is fun and has a personality you don't mind spending 45 minutes a day with.  I had been doing her earlier two workouts and was looking for something new and found these two new workouts.  The music is great on this one.  Please put it on amazon online like her other two.  I take these on my iPad everywhere would love to have the two newest on amazon online.",1379721600,3,495,4.051546391752577

4860027,5,B005QUQRCO,"My favorite Jennifer Galardi Dancing off the inches video!
This one is a bit challenging and took me a few times to get good enough at it that I worked up a good sweat. The difficulty level is higher so you don't get bored. Its so much fun before you know it the cool down comes and its over. I get so amped up I pop in a second DVD!",1365724800,3,333,3.7714285714285714
4860028,4,B005QUQRCO,"I have other Dance Off the Inches DVDs, and I love Jennifer Galardi as an instructor, but I found the choreography in this DVD a little difficult and felt I didn't get a really good workout until after the 2nd or 3rd time around. After that, I really worked up a sweat and got more into it. Requires reviewing the workout prior to doing it if you really want to feel like you've done something other than just stumble around.",1365120000,2,425,4.325
4860029,3,B005QUQRCO,"I am still having trouble getting some of the moves; but if I don't mind looking silly and just letting go (because I'm not getting all the moves... I'm not coordinated),  I still get a pretty good workout.",1363305600,3,206,4.421052631578948
4860030,5,B005QUQRCO,"This is my absolute favorite workout.  I have all the Dance Off the Inches Hip Hops, and this is the best one, in my opinion. It's so much fun that I look forward to the part of the day when I pop in the DVD, which is unusual for me.

First off, a word about the instructor. After going through a lot of dance workouts, the videos by Jennifer Galardi are now the only ones I buy because I think she does a great job of telling you how to do the moves in the way that both looks the best and gets the most out of your exercise.  Her talking throughout the video is much more engaging and full of substance than the brainless ""good,"" ""great,"" ""okay"" filler that comprises the entirety of what some other instructors say, and she seems much more like a friend than some cookie cutter model trying to motivate me out of jealousy rather than aspirations of wellness. I adore her.  I see that some people do not, so I suppose it's a matter of personality. She's more tomboyish than a lot other instructors and that's one of the things that makes me like her style so much.

This video has three routines.  All of them are very 90s indeed, so be prepared for that--it didn't bother me at all.  The first is ""In the Club.""  For me, it required a little more coordination and a little more time to learn than the others, but it's fun once you get the hang of it. There's sexy-looking twists and hip bumps, and you get to hop around some. Now, disclaimer--can you take these moves to the club?  The same way you can take any other obviously practiced, contrived, pre-scripted dance routine to the club.  Can you? Yes. Would it be awkward? Unspeakably.

The second is ""Groovin'"" and, if I really throw myself into it, I'm never able to do the last routine because ""Groovin'"" is EXHAUSTING. This and ""Kick It"" are where you really get the work out.  You'll be jumping around and putting every last bit of your energy into it.  Oh--and it's so much fun.  You feel like you're awesome doing it. There's quick, dramatic movements and tons of upper body, and it has you moving around all over the place.

""Kick It""'s got a lot of energy in it as well.  The first move in it is awesome--you get to cross your arms and kick all over the place in true hip hop style.  There's a scuff move in the routine that's a little awkward, but most of it is natural, downbeat-emphasizing goodness.  If you make it to the end, you'll throw yourself on the couch and be unable to move for 10 minutes as you recover, but you'll have had a great time.

A few things that, though little, if you're like me, they matter a ton.  First, the music is awesome.  Usually the music is merely functional to me, but here it's a real perk.  It's perfectly chosen for the routines.  For instance, the ""Groovin'"" music is kind of electronic sounding, matching the kind of robot-looking moves in places of the routines.  ""Kick it""'s full of beat box that matches the high energy, more ""street"" kind of moves the routine has in places.  All of it's catchy and it makes you want to move.

Second, none of the background dancers annoy me. This is unusual.  In fact, I really like them.  They're almost as fun to watch as Jennifer.

To sum up--some moments of awkward, but it's so much fun and such a great, energetic, exhausting work out that it will turn exercise into something you look forward to and see results from.  Can't ask for anything more!",1363132800,5,3400,4.367834394904459
4860031,5,B005QUQRCO,"I do this workout on a regular basis, and when I get tired of it I go away for awhile but always come back.  Galardi is a really great instructor and her isolation warmups help me to not get as sore afterward.  There is a warmup and three 12-15 minute routines.  She is really good at building up the moves slowly so that you master a particular move before combining it with the ones before.  And even though at times in the beginning I sometimes wonder 'Is this difficult enough?,' by the end I'm ALWAYS sweating.  Good stuff.",1362873600,,528,4.346938775510204

And, it's not even a very good cardio workout.  It might be OK if you are new to working out and looking for something lighter and a slow pace to learn the moves, but if you are already in shape, skip this one.  I tried to pump it up by doing jumping jacks and high knees every time they were marching in place, but it truly wasn't worth it.  The music was lame and the instructors were just so-so.

And she is hands-down the best instructor out there, so far as I've seen.  She explains everything so well, and she knows the human body and body mechanics so well.  I bought Hip Hop Jam before this one, and really liked it.  This one is even better!  You feel like an actual hip-hop dancer, because the moves flow so smoothly and are fairly intricate.  It took me doing it a few times before I had them down.  It's great choreography that's fun to do once you get it.  And somehow, I like these backup dancers better than the ones in Hip Hop Jam.

So, I got this workout  a while back because I thought ""Well, I always do hard-core, straight up exercising"", so I wanted to try something like this, dancing, instead of your basic jump squats, push ups, etc., like I like. Got home, did this, and I got confused. It's probably because...well, I don't' dance, lol. But I eventually got the hang of it...kind of. By the end, I wasn't sweating that much, didn't feel my muscles...just not that great. Then again, I really wasn't expecting that. I was expecting more of a cardio-like burn, but didn't even get that. It seemed a bit fun, but I don't' care for it because I don't feel like I'm getting a good workout. I have gotten other dance videos, and they are the same. You would probably love this...if you're a dancer and are into that...but if you are like me, and like a straight-forward classic workout like planks, burpees, stuff like that, you won't. I should not have gotten this. I just wanted to see if it would change how I feel about dance workouts...I'm done with them. I'll stick to Jillian Michaels.",1429488000,,1067,4.557291666666667
