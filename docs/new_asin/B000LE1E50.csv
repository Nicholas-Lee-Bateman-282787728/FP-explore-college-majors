2708847,5,B000LE1E50,"Just picked this one up the other day. AWESOME!!! If you even liked the TV series even a little bit (and c'mon now - ya gotta love Julian, Ricky and Bubbs!) this is a great laugh. Loved it!! It's was pretty cool to see some Canadian musical talent in the show too!. Alex Lifeson (Rush), Hugh Dillon (Headstones) and Gord Downie (Tragically Hip) play the parts of a cop, club-owner and another cop, respectively.

Just crack open the beers, put the feet on the table and get ready to laugh your socks off.

Yes, it might be considered to be ""low budget"" but that truly is one of the magic things about TPB. And, always remember: ""A dope trailer is no place for a kitty!""",1172016000,19,669,4.344

2708889,5,B000LE1E50,This is the set to have. If you aren't having a good time with what happened to the show without Clattenburg and Barrie Dunn then simply get this set. It's the pre-Netflix stuff.,1511049600,,178,4.424242424242424

I open the box and the collector bix that 2 DVD boxes are in is also in perfect condition. Here's where things go wrong...I take the two individual DVD cases out and both have HUGE cracks across the top and side where the cases open. Obviously this damage was done before shipping since every ounce of the packaging was perfect. 3 DVD's were ruined. So my now ""NEW"" collection is incomplete. The other DVD's are awesome, and the picture quality is superb. To say however that I was disappointed in having 3 DVD's in the set useless to me is an understatement.",1438387200,,683,4.472

It kind of grows on you.  On a scale of 1 to 10 I would give it a 5 or 6.  The acting is good and makes you really think you are watching a documentary of losers in a trailer park.  It is well done for what it is.  Knowing what it is, I would not have bought it.

The premiss is that these two Trailer Park Guys are being followed around by a film crew doing a documentary about trailer parks.  So it has a Cinma vrit feeling through out.

It seems so peaceful like part of the neighborhood. I know people have different taste in comedy and the movies, but I really like the trailer Park boys, because it is so real and I have been watching them ever since they came out. And overall, my favorite character is bubbles with those glasses and his kitties, and the actor that plays Mr. Leahy. There is nobody ever in my opinion that plays a better alcoholic or drunk like he does not even put money on that one, but overall this is a great comedy, but what I suggest is actually watch from the very first season to really appreciate how these movies even came about and what they are about.

You have to have some familiarity with the underbelly of society (i.e., drug-dealing, misguided, hard-drinking, always an angle, and usually living in sub-par housing - like perhaps a trailer park), to really appreciate this series. I found it hilarious, but then, I was in the music industry for years, so these guys are all too familiar to me!  ;)  Unforgettable characters, really clever subplots, and humor as black and sticky as tar (yep, that kind of tar...), make this one crazy watch. It is way, way out there - and I am riveted! By the way, Ricky and Julian, if you are ever in Hawaii - don't stop by!  Oh, OK, you can stop (but you can't stay).",1409270400,,800,4.428571428571429

Thankfully the other two films, Say Goodnight To The Bad Guys & Countdown To Liquor Day were much better by following the documentary style filmmaking. Also, Trinity is portrayed by a different actress . . . she doesn't work.

And finding a replacement case that hold 8 discs is really tough. would have been awesome in like three 4 disc boxes and 1 five disc. but one 9 disc and one 8 is really tough.

2709711,4,B000LE1E50,"Out of jail after 18 months, Ricky and Julian come home broke and jobless to nothing but their friend Bubbles in ""Trailer Park Boys: The Movie."" Although the movie doesn't follow the storyline of the television series, the director (Mike Clattenburg) and the characters remain as Ricky (Robb Wells), Julian (John Paul Tremblay), and Bubbles (Mike Smith), showing their lives in Sunnyvale Trailer Park through the use of comedic characters, a humorous plot, and a documentary filming style.

The actors hilariously play their character roles. Ricky makes it obvious that he dropped out of school at a young age, saying things like ""Thank you, your honor"" to a minister and calling a judge ""your majesty."" The other main character, Julian, Ricky's best friend since childhood, has a tough guy appearance but is very selfless. When Ricky makes two guys cry, Julian is the one to comfort them. He is always seen in a tight black shirt with a drink in his hand, no matter where he is--driving, in the movie theatre, and in court. Bubbles, who is often the third wheel to Ricky and Julian, has over a dozen cats and lives with them all in his shed home.

The plot is simple:  Steal change and stay out of jail. Stealing change is easy to do and impossible to trace. Although they think they have come up with a great scheme, the Trailer Park Boys don't think clearly. While trying to take quarters from parking meters, the boys discover they brought the wrong tools. Instead of leaving--or even getting different tools--Ricky backs his beater car over four meters and tosses them in his trunk while pedestrians stop and stare. Without surprise, the meter change wasn't enough to live off. Instead of robbing all the meters in the city, they decide to do ""The Big Dirty"" and steal a huge change ball from the movie theatre. The plan was being executed with success--until a fire alarm goes off and people flood out the doors and surround the guys. Although the main point of the movie is to watch the guys steal change, the laughs aren't always involving money. At one point, Ricky was making toast with tongs and a blow torch. It's safe to say Sunnyvale Trailer Park isn't very classy, but that adds comicality.

The movie could be considered a ""mockumentary"" because it parodies the documentary form. Clattenburg used this form because it makes the film funnier; this way it is possible to hear what the characters are thinking when something big is happening in their lives. During an interview, Ricky explains that he's living in his car because his girlfriend, Lucy (Lucy Decoutere),  kicked him out because he's not dealing drugs anymore, so they're having money problems. During her interview, Lucy explains that she still loves him, and she'll visit him in his car, but he's in the doghouse. This information wouldn't be known without the character interviews.

There are many surprising, laughable elements that went into this movie. The characters alone are enough to make the movie worthwhile, but when you add the ""mockumentary"" and plot to that, it makes it even better.",1379894400,,3076,4.849523809523809

I've watched all seven seasons, the two movies, and the various other specials well over a dozen times each. The other night, my best friend and I were browsing through Prime when I saw this glorious piece of cinematic history under the comedy category. Quickly in my excitement I nearly screamed at my BFF, ""BRO, HAVE YOU SEEN THE TRAILER PARK BOYS MOVIE YET?!?!?""

No was his answer, and with that knowledge I quickly hit play. To this day, I still crack up every single time I watch even the shortest clip of TPB, and luckily my best friend found the humor just as entertaining as myself. By the end of the movie, he was beet red, and complained of how sore his stomach was from laughing so hard. At one point, he started dry heaving from laughing too hard.

No matter, Clattenburg does this well, his keen sense for comedy overcomes the hopeless trailerpark life, the screwy thinking so brilliantly portrayed by Trembly, Wells, Dunsworth and pals and highlights the background of the simple set.

The p.o.s. car the original 3 came in starts rolling backwards and into the store front of a cigarette store, so they steal all of the cigarettes.... they get arrested after hilarious dialog.  while in jail the main character Ricky, is playing on the inmates 'hockey team' and one of the guards hates Ricky so instead of letting them play against the guards 'hockey team', the guard gets it so Ricky and Julian can get out of jail before the ""big game"".  Once they get out they want to do 'the big dirty' (the 1 last big illegal heist before they become legit, so they can make some serious cash) they decide to steal parking meters. Ricky learns his wife became a stripper and had a boob job and is now a lesbian.  Their daughter, who's like 10, steals BBQ grills and sells them at the local flea market for money for her cigarette addiction she has. And that's just like the first 20 minutes of the movie.

This movie is ok but doesn't have the same feel as the series...You just do not feel as connected to the characters as with the show. For me, it felt more forced and not as ""natural"". Also, there were some added elements that I personally don't feel were needed, namely the nudity. The show relies on the good scripting and funny story-lines...no need for boobs there. I felt it was a sell-out for the movie to go to that level and it was disappointing. Overall, although the camera work wasn't as ""mockumentary"" feeling as the series, and maybe the quick wit and funny lines weren't as often as the series, it is a must-have to round out your Trailer Park Boys collection. I highly recommend for Trailer Park newbies: Try the series first---it will give you the true magic of the Trailer Park Boys.

I now watch the show every Thursday night, then write e-mails to friends, who don't get the show, to explain what the episode was about. They in turn tell other friends, who now are all interested in the series.
  The main thing I got from the TPB Movie is that it was made for people who haven't seen the series. Many things in it were repeats of things that had appeared in past episodes. For instance: Ricky's daughter, Trinity, is about 7 years old in the movie. In the series, the young Actress who played her would have been about 15 at the time of the movie. They got a new, youger Actress for Trinity, and they repeat something that happened in Season 3. Ricky and Trinity are both trying to stop smoking and are both wearing nicotine patches.
  Since I'm a fan of the series, I probably would have been better off getting DVD's of the actual series. I guess the movie creators thought that continuing the story from where the series left off wouldn't be as productive as having a re-hash of bits and pieces from the past.",1279065600,,1106,4.433497536945813

2709903,4,B000LE1E50,"This a great way to jump straight into the riotous world of Julian, Ricky and Bubbles and discover Canada's funniest show ever.

Over seven series Director Mike Clattenburg and his writer/actors have developed the wild, woolly universe of Sunnyvale Trailer Park to near operatic comic proportions.

The mockumentary style works marvellously here, as does the cleverly constructed story and character development. But the main weapon is the remarkable cast, who are often brilliant in their roles. Front and centre is rum and coke fueled, low end criminal mastermind Julian (John Paul Temblay), volatile loose cannon Ricky (Robb Wells) and guiless cat lover Bubbles (Mike Smith). The chemistry between these three is true lightening in bottle TV magic. And they've got great opposition from alcoholic trailer park supervisor Jim Lahey (John Dunsworth) and his boyfriend/offsider Randy (Pat Roach). The more Lahey drinks, the more becomes like a demented white trash Captain Ahab, with Ricky as Moby Dick.

And it's so damn funny. Sure it's full of dope, guns, drinking and other  mayhem, but the secret weapon is the wonderful warmth and likability of the hilarious characters. At it's core 'TPB' is all about love, loyalty, family and friendship. Plus mightily funny use of the f*bomb.

Just needs Conky for the sequel.",1250985600,,1319,5.261904761904762

2709907,5,B000LE1E50,"I'm always the first to flinch whenever the term ""white tr*sh"" is used, but I accidentally stumbled upon this movie, and it was all I hoped Rhett Ellis's novella ""The Greatest White Trash Love Story Ever Told"" to be.

There is joy, crime, a lot of booze, smoking, trailers, strip joints, a gang of colorful characters, and some unexpected sweet moments of tenderness.

I was wondering about the quirky comedy timing that struck a note of familiarity, and the moment I saw the prisoners playing hockey (using lunch trays as protective shields and gallon milk jugs as hocky masks) it immediately became apparent this is no American prison.

Ricky and Julian are Halifax trailer park buddies who land in prison after a heist that begins with an ATM machine and ends with...a backseat full of cartons of cigarettes.  They get educated in the brick and learn about ""the Big Dirty,"" that one job that will retire their career as criminals.  In  characteristic downsizing that is a necessity in trailer park living, the duo downsizes their version of the Big Dirty into something even less substantial than ATM machines.  Along the way Ricky tries to regain the interest of his girlfriend, who strays to become a stripper while he was in the joint, while Julian falls in love with another stripper.  All this while the gang has to deal with an evil trailer park supervisor who is a former cop.  As the story goes on, it becomes apparent that Ricky is more obsessed with returning to prison to head his cell mates' hockey team against that of the prison guards'.

Julian, with his ubiquitous glass of rum and coke (I actually have friends like that) and Ricky, with hilarious pompadour make a good and convincing team for a reason: they are childhood friends in real life as well.  Throw in the entire gang (many who have been involved in each other's projects in the past) and you get a solid rapport behind the TV series that led to this movie.

The film is also shot in beautiful 16mm color film, interspersed with handhelds, resulting in something that is a cross between Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers and some of William Eggleston's most sublime moments on dye transfer.

Fans of Canadian comedy (who can ever forget Boys in the Hall?) will definitely have a good feel for this film.  As for the rest of the folks who insist that art can only be measured using classic literature as a yardstick, they will do well to note that which the canon of Western literature itself has mined for comical and dramatic material over hundreds of years: the color and richness of the human story in the nether regions of society.",1228262400,,2618,4.700218818380744

The Boys get oot of jail (kicked oot early, so Ricky can't play goal in the guards vs. inmates ball hockey tournament) and hatch a plan for The Big Dirty, one last heist that will allow them to retire. They're all set to steal vast quantities of change .. why change? Duh .. it's completely untraceable! As can be expected, things don't go 'exactly' as planned and our boys run into trouble with the law.

Another difference between this movie and the show is in the ending. At the center of every TPB plot is a similarly bizarre money-making scheme that goes awry. Of course, the movie is no different but the ending might be a little happier than hardcore TPB fans are accustomed to.

The movie is not canon with the show, you can see a list of a few differences between the movie and the show on wikipedia.

Filmed in beautiful Nova Scotia the cinematography is absolutely amazing. Sets include a trailer park and a prison, I know .. not so beautiful. But a nice, peaceful blue sky sat over many scenes that perfectly fit our Boys' usually frenetic action (I mean 'perfectly fit' in the way that their nice, serene theme music fits them perfectly). ;)

Overall, I thought the movie struck a good balance. TPB fans should enjoy it and first time viewers won't have to know the show to enjoy the movie.",1175990400,29,1800,4.475609756097561
2709930,5,B000LE1E50,"I've been a huge fan of this show. I own all the seasons and have already watched the 6th season, i'm so what addicted to it. Now when showing this show/movie to my friends theres a couple of things i do first. I'll show them the first season and second season to have them get the jist of the show. Simply being the show is so diffrent from anything in america that it takes some getting used to. But after a while you will quickly begin to enjoy the show. I've never met anyone who watched the whole first season and be displeased. Afterwards they'll love the movie as dearly as i do. I have shown the movie to a few before they seen any of the show and had mixed reviews. But never has someone whose watched a little bit of the show not like the Movie. Overall the movie is great, everyone from the shows i back on except trinity. The girl who plays trinity is an awful actress however shes not in it too much. You'll really enjoy this show if you're a true Trailer Park Boys fan.",1175644800,8,983,4.151832460732984
