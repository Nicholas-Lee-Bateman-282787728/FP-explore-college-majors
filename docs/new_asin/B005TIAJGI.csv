8486219,5,B005TIAJGI,"I had forgotten this series existed and one can see the same producers and writers that wrote ""McHale's Navy"" also did this show.  The discs are fine and the company gives a disclaimer stating the quality of the discs are from old prints.  Really the quality is fine.
The storylines are interesting in that the mechanics are all WAVES, including a male who has a female name.  I've watched 1/3 of the shows and are enjoying them.  I love old 50s-60s TV shows, especially Westerns and military shows, especially comedies like this one.
If you enjoy ""McHale's Navy"" and other 60s shows, you'll enjoy this one too.

8486221,4,B005TIAJGI,"Producer Edward Montagne spun this silly gender-battle service comedy off from his popular McHALE'S NAVY. It lasted a single 32-episode full season, trounced by Ed Sullivan's variety acts. It deserved better, for there's early, slapsticky, empowerment of women (""girdle gobs"") here, a faint anti-Vietnam War sentiment as well as much confusion over proper gender identifications and behaviors in the South Pacific naval theatre in 1944. Kathleen Nolan is nominally the star, as a somewhat emancipated WAVE heading a protofeminist motor pool, but bespectacled Edward Andrews, then just 50, steals every show as Nolan's nemesis Cdr. Roger Adrian, a blustering misogynist sybarite who finds the ""lousy war"" interferes, like those pesky girdled WAVEs, with his enjoyment of French cuisine, fine wines and his private golf links, houseboat and sauna.

There are no guest stars, because the ensemble cast are so tight and skilled in nattily and nuttily paced pratfalls, slapstick and burlesque skits as well as a barrage of verbal barbs. Andrews and Nolan are supported by three players (coincidentally, none heterosexual) who are consistently funny and spot-on in suggesting the complexities of gender roles in wartime: Dick Sargent, Sheila Kuehl James (Dobie Gillis' Zelda Gilroy) and George Furth. These regulars are further backed by really familiar sitcom talent in the reassuring presences of Arnold Stang, Doris Packer and William Smith (Smith gratuitously does a shirtless scene, throwing the entire cast into a dither of conflicted yearnings for naval beefcake).

Montagne hired revolving teams of gag writers, directors and DPs (Russell Metty shot one b/w episode), and the series has solid thematic and visual consistency, making good use of the Universal backlot for island exteriors. These prints are in terrible condition, the day-for-night sequences indecipherable, but the soundtrack (canned laughter postdubbed) has survived crystal-clear. The series actually plays better today in bargain DVD revival than it did in 1964-65. Service comedies are no longer topical, attitudes have changed (glacially) over gender biases, we know more about the cast's backstories and career arcs, and slapstick/verbal sitcoms where the two modes are so naturally integrated just aren't made any longer. BROADSIDE (the sexist title is a triple entendre) is broader than it need be, dumbed down for prepubescent viewers, but it was very well made by its creators and is worth revisiting if you'll read between the predictable lines and sight gags and reflect on the coded messages this frivolous entertainment really is conveying.",1437436800,,2622,5.5361596009975065
8486222,4,B005TIAJGI,"Fun episodes, but when they say ""slight imperfections,"" they have stretched the blanket a mite.  The focus is gone, as a lot of screen shots on the web show, and night scenes are almost invisible.  This is one series that need ""Digital enhancement.""",1423699200,,249,4.767441860465116
8486223,5,B005TIAJGI,"This 60's Comedy TV-Show is very good. The actors of this Show: Edward Andrews, Dick Sargent and Katleen Nolan are very good. A brilliant Show.",1420675200,,143,4.76
8486224,5,B005TIAJGI,Arrived on time and plays perfect. I love this lesser known series. It is very funny like the Mchales navy tv show was.,1408406400,,119,4.217391304347826
8486225,5,B005TIAJGI,"This is a show that will probably never see a legit pro release. Here you get 29 of 32 episodes. There's some quality glitches here and there, but the DVDs are viewable. thank you!",1340323200,5,180,4.323529411764706
