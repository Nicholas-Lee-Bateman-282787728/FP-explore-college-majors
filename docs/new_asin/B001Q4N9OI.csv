8335008,4,B001Q4N9OI,This is an overall good example of Chrissie Hynde's vocal range and songwriting ability. From a dreamy ballad to a hard rocking song it's all here.,1273449600,,147,4.6923076923076925
8335009,1,B001Q4N9OI,"Hi Folks,

the other reviewers are right...
this is a VH1 show that looks to be bootlegged and on top of it the 4x3 aspect ratio
has been artificially made widescreen so the image is not  only 5th generation fuzzy and grainy but stretched...YUUUCK
am I still glad I have this ..of course...Chrissie and her boys rock but would I be happier if it was a legit licensed release with the direct VH1 footage...ABSOLUTELY..

be warned.....its like a bad VHS from  the 70's but any footage of the Pretenders is a day to celebrate for me...OH and GET THE NEW DVD..LIVE IN LONDON its fabulous!!",1266451200,4,585,4.542857142857143
8335010,2,B001Q4N9OI,"This dvd is merely a very grainy transfer of a VH-1/Hard Rock concert.  Viacom's lawyers should look into this because the VH-1 logo is in the bottom right corner of the screen, and there's no way VH-1/Viacom would've ever licensed out shoddy product like this.  It's really no better than a pro-shot bootleg - very grainy/fuzzy.  The case claims it's in 5.1, but when i put it in 5.1 on my system, i basically got the SAME sound out of every speaker - i highly doubt this is 5.1.  Sound is overall decent though, but the terrible picture quality sinks this release.  The performance is good, though, but the disc only runs around 42 minutes or so, so this thing is pricey for what you get.  You'd be better off with just about any of the other legitimate Pretenders DVD's - the Wiltern one is excellent, and there's a new Blu-ray just out.  You'd be far better off buying this:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pretenders-Loose-In-L-A/dp/B0000C2IUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pretenders - Loose In L.A.</a>",1266105600,6,1049,5.245508982035928
8335011,3,B001Q4N9OI,"After following this great woman and her different band line-ups for 30 years now, it's nice to have this in the collection. But I've seen much better shows than this one recorded in NYC. Since Adam and Andy are no longer playing with her, it's just good to have them on video. They were her longest running band-mates other than Martin and inducted into the R'n'R Hall of Fame with her. So hats off. and it's just o.k. in my opinion.",1260921600,,434,4.37037037037037
8335012,3,B001Q4N9OI,"I wish I had known this dvd consisted of only 9 songs played live. The quality of the dvd is very grainy. However, if you are a fan of The Pretenders its probably worth having. Bottom line...the price (nearly $18 when purchased) was a bit expensive for the quality and length of this dvd.",1250380800,10,288,4.351851851851852
