6389443,5,B00JRXHEAA,"Let me warn you up front, this series is not for the faint of heart.  The subject matter covered is rape, kidnapping, and murder.  There were brutal and emotional images of beatings and one murder.  I found myself cringing and holding my breath.  In fact, the last time I was so emotionally affected by a program was during my viewing of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Broadchurch/dp/B00HGE90Z4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Broadchurch</a>.  Happy Valley took me hostage for six hours where I could not take my eyes from the screen.  When the final credits rolled I felt emotionally drained but at least I could breathe freely again.  This is not a series where I will rewatch the episodes over (and sometimes over again depending on the series).

Sarah Lancashire, (The Paradise, Last Tango in Halifax) gives a stunning performance as Police Sergeant Catherine Cawood, a tough and hardened copper who's given up her life as a detective because of family matters.  And that is putting her situation mildly.  Lancashire has won my respect with her considerable talent amply displayed in this role.  I kept thinking to myself, wow!

We are introduced to Catherine at the scene of a threatened suicide-by-petrol taking place in a playground.  Cawood arrives with a borrowed fire extinguisher in hand and when the high as a kite young man begins telling her his reason for setting himself alight, (his girlfriend has broken up with him), she replies, ""I'm Catherine, by the way!  I'm forty-seven, I'm divorced, I live with my sister, who's a recovering heroin addict, I have two grown-up children. One dead and one who doesn't speak to me. And a grandson! So.""

As the story unfolds from there, we learn the details behind Catherine's statement.  Little by little, over six episodes, we see why Catherine's husband divorced her, how her daughter died, why her son doesn't speak to her, why her sister lives with her, and how she came to have custody of her eight year-old grandson.  Catherine's story is incredible and her strength is admirable and inestimable.  I found myself admiring her immensely and feeling intense sorrow for her at the same time.  This story touched me deeply.

I do not want to go into details of the story because I don't want to ruin one minute of this program for you.  I will tell you as much as the video case reveals.  Kevin Weatherill, played by Steve Pemberton (Whitechappel,) instigates the kidnapping of his boss' daughter, Ann, when he becomes bitterly angry about being turned down for a rise in pay. The man to whom he suggests the abduction, Ashley Cowgill, is someone he trusts not to harm the girl. However, Kevin has no idea who and what Ashley is nor does he know that in Ashley's employ is one Tommy Lee Royce, just out of prison for drugs crimes, and believed to be responsible for the death of Catherine's daughter.  Royce is cruel and his involvement in the kidnapping sends everything spiraling out of control.  Kevin and Ashley are out of their depth.  Catherine, knowing that Royce is out of prison on her patch, will not rest until justice for her daughter prevails, even if that means taking matters into her own hands.  Let's just say that things get messy.

Catherine's life is filled with personal and professional trials.  Her grandson is disrespectful, slinging insults at his gran that made me want to send him to his room, and constantly in trouble at school. His behavior causes Catherine to question if she is doing right by him.  Her ex-husband has remarried and has nothing to do with their grandson but still pursues Catherine for dinner and more.  Why?  She is haunted by the image of her daughter's disfigured and dead body.  Why?  I liked how I kept looking for the answers to the why's.  In addition, as the sergeant of Happy Valley's police force, Catherine's job is a stressful one, to say the least.  Even so, she slogs along day by day as more and more is heaped upon her.

Clare, Catherine's sister, quietly and masterfully portrayed by Siobhan Finneran, plays a huge and pivotal role in Catherine's life.  I found myself hoping for more back story about the two sisters.  I wondered what their childhood was like and about the life events, which shaped them.

This series is one story shown over six episodes.  There is no murder mystery to be solved.  We know who is doing what but we don't always know why.  I particularly liked how plot points were doled out bit by bit so I had several ah-hah moments.  I found myself analyzing all the characters and looking for their motivation at every turn.  I loved this!

I was also wowed by Catherine's capable handling of hooligans.  She was fearless in facing violence and dished out a bit of her own when the situation called for it.  And the situation called for it more than once.  I couldn't help but pull for her throughout the episodes and almost pray that everything would turn out for the best for her.  I wanted a happy ending for Happy Valley in the worst way.  I guess a happy ending is in the eye of the beholder.

All in all, I was completely taken in by this program and while at times the brutality sucked the breath out of me, I was enthralled and compelled to go the distance.  I want to see more of Catherine Cawood.  I hope there are further seasons in this series.

There are subtitles, which is immensely helpful, even for those with an ear for the strong accents of Great Britain.  The brogue is thick and spoken quickly.

Edited: 8/28/2014 Folks, this series is now on Netflix.",1404000000,81,5558,4.774396642182581

6389447,5,B00JRXHEAA,"Best British cop show in years. Sarah Lancashire is great as the down to earth as Catherine a Police Sargent who is divorced, has a dead daughter, lives with her sister who is a recovering drug addict and who is raising her dead daughter's son. The series is set in and around Halifax in West Yorkshire a former  area surrounded by beautiful countryside . I doubt if this show could  be made in America as the leading actress would not be allowed to be a glamorous  as she is in this British show. In fact Catherine is an outstanding police officer, hard working, brave, intelligent and compassionate. All this despite the problems of her home life.

If you like this show try the British Cop shows, Line of Duty, Luther and No Offence  all are in the new dark, gritty and at time brutal and horrifying style. Morse and Midsummer murders they are not. You made need a multi region DVD player to watch some of them. However it works both ways I live in Britain and need one to watch American DVDs not available in Europe.",1499299200,,1020,4.433155080213904

Sarah Lancashire is so believable in her part as a police sergeant Catherine Cawood, she deserves every award possible as well as the show deserves the same. Sally Wainwright wrote Sarah;s role specifically for her and it was right on the mark. It is an intense drama series with harsh language and situations, but is so compelling I watched the whole series at once and will watch I'm sure several more times. The second series is just as good as the first and I am waiting for series 3, hopefully it will come out soon. I think the BBC puts out the best TV dramas.",1475712000,2,589,4.412844036697248
6389463,5,B00JRXHEAA,"Extremely intense. Harsh subject matter. Real cops/detectives who have real problems in their own lives. I worked for a big city police dept/detective unit so I know these people. All the acting is great but especially Sarah Lancashire, the main cop/sgt., James Norton (as a horribly damaged baddie---you may remember him as the wonderful Anglican pastor/detective in ""Grantchester""). He absolutely delves deeply into the character of this messed up rapist/murderer. James Norton is such a gifted actor that when he weeps in fear toward the end, you actually feel sorry for him, despite his prior horrible acts. The actors playing the Gallagher family are brilliant. The child actor playing the grandson of Sarah is fantastic, all his facial expressions speak clearly about his confusion, anger, etc.
The direction is firm. The cinematographer captures West Yorkshire in all its gritty splendor.
Warnings: there are some extremely violent scenes, bloody. The rape is not shown but the after-effects are.",1475625600,3,1003,5.3949044585987265

6389466,5,B00JRXHEAA,I really liked this show and recommend it highly! I did occasionally have trouble understanding the dialogue but I just turned up the volume and paid closer attention. Excellent cop thriller!!,1470268800,,192,5.225806451612903
6389467,5,B00JRXHEAA,"In the first few minutes of Happy Valley we know that police sergeant Catherine Cawood is 47, has family troubles and is razor sharp in making observations of the criminal element; right down to pasty skin.

It doesnt take long to understand that no one is happy in Happy Valley. The title makes reference to the Calder Valley of England as the location of much drug importation.

If you haven't seen Sarah Lancashire in Last Tango in Halifax, please do. It shows the range of Lancashire. And if youve watched James Norton in Grantchester, prepare yourself for a complete turnaround of character. He is as evil as he is good, if troubled, in Grantchester.

All the acting is superb in this gritty British crime drama. But oh, the writing! This is a well-told story written by creator Sally Wainwright, who also does some of the direction. Throughout the story are great subtleties that allow us to know how these women feel. The scene in which the kidnapped girls mother tells Cawood what has happened to her child is incredibly good. She speaks the words no mother can bear to say almost hoping the sergeant doesnt hear them. Although there are good male roles, make no mistake; this is about strong, determined women.

In another scene the accountant (Steve Pemberton) and his wife try to reason what they could do with the ransom money. They are everyday people talking about whether to deposit it in saving accounts or bury it! This is remarkable writing and acting. Normal people attempting to be abnormal; it doesnt make sense in their world.

The financial desperation of this one mealy-mouthed accountant with self-confidence issues sets his neat little life and that of his family into spiral. When his boss won't give him a raise, he decides to kidnap his daughter for ransom. To this effect, he meets up with a local drug importer, his thug friends and hatches the plan.

From there is all goes south!

One of the thugs is truly evil. Tommy Lee Royce (James Norton) raped Cawoods daughter eight years ago resulting in an unwanted child; a boy. Unable to live with what Royce did to her, daughter Becky committed suicide and Cawood and her sister Clare (Siobhan Finneran), a recovering heroin addict and alcoholic, are raising the boy. As you might expect he has behavioral concerns and aggressive outbursts.

There is violence in Happy Valley. Most of it happens in darkened rooms or in exterior shots at sunset, but it is intense. Although rape is implied, it is not shown.

Happy Valley is scripted drama at its best. See it.",1468886400,,2538,4.763097949886105
6389468,5,B00JRXHEAA,"Without question, the best written and most beautifully performed series I have ever seen.

The whole show is outstanding (though season one was just slightly too dark to stomach -- let's have some comic relief every now and again for chrissake!!!!), but season two is better than season one and the last episode of series 2 has some of the best writing/ staging I've ever witnessed.  A woman (cop) holding another woman who is near death, trying to save her, yet reading her her rights at the same time, while embracing her with love.  It flattened me.

6389484,5,B00JRXHEAA,"Excellently written and performed police drama in the tradition of Prime Suspect written and directed by the enormously talented Sally Wainwright. DO NOT come to Happy Valley expecting Last Tango in Halifax. Happy Valley is serious and violent, like real life.

SPOILER ALERT:

Filmed and set in the Calder Valley, this BBC production stars Sarah Lancashire and Siobhan Finneran, who play, respectively, Yorkshire police sergeant/ former homicide detective Catherine Cawood and her recovering substance-abusing sister Clare. Happy Valley is dark, intense, unapologetic, at times, brutal and violent.  The first season deals with kidnapping, rape & multiple murder perpetrated by a vicious psychopath (Tommy Lee Royce) who also fathered Catherine Cawood's grandson, a dyslexic, volatile and troubled 8-year-old named Ryan.

Because Catherine decided not to put Ryan up for adoption, her marriage disintegrated as did the relationship with her son Daniel.  Cawood and her younger sister Clare share a household with Ryan, providing him with a stable and loving home. Cawood's daughter/Ryan's mother Becky hanged herself 6 weeks after Ryan's birth, at the age of 18.  While Catherine describes Ryan's conception as during a ""brutal rape"", Catherine's living child, Daniel, reveals that Becky wasn't the model daughter that Catherine remembers, and that there was, in fact, a connection between Tommy and Becky, which he describes as ""infatuation"" on his sister's part.

Even as the viewer is left wondering if Ryan was fathered through a casual encounter between his parents,  we have a clear sense of Catherine's character as she reminds us  that however Ryan came to be, it's ""not his fault"". Cawood is stubborn, can be verbally impulsive, even impetuous. But there is no doubt that she is selfless to a fault. She cares deeply for the police officers she supervises as she reminds them that being a police officer is about having compassion for the people they serve.

Season 2 opens with psychopath Tommy behind bars, but still dangerous since he's able to groom vulnerable women to carry out his vendetta against Catherine Cawood, whom he blames for his mother's death, even though she was likely a victim of a serial murderer targeting prostitutes.  Tommy's paranoia and bitter hatred of Catherine Cawood become even more evident while he's working to turn Ryan against her. With the help of one of the women Tommy manipulated, Ryan's now under the impression that Tommy, his biological father, really isn't guilty of the things he was put in prison for doing. The season concludes with Tommy reading a hand-written letter that Ryan mailed to him without his grandmother's knowledge despite a no-contact order in place to protect him.",1458432000,,2737,5.283410138248848
6389485,5,B00JRXHEAA,"Another BBC drama hit from Ms. Wainwright, If you liked season 1, you will love season 2. I thought Scott and Bailey was the pinicle of her talents but I was wrong. Riveting drama at its finest with more ticks on the boxes left in limbo from season 1. This well acted and directed drama as always gives you a few belly laughs while tugging at you emotional limits. With a few familiar faces from Cornation Street, Band of Brothers and Scott and Bailey they show their range of talent.

Anyway, the overused safe plot of a kidnapping for ransom with usual discord and disconnect between perpetrators and hostage's family. Outside of one or two camera angle enhanced fight scenes not much happens as far as violence. It is the UK so guns are a no-no (supports the argument for gun registration) thus knives are the weapon du-jour.

6389512,5,B00JRXHEAA,"Happy Valley is an intelligently written crime drama with an absolutely wonderful lead. Sarah Lancashire is just brilliant as Catherine, and the supporting cast is excellent as well (particularly Siobhan Finneran as Catherine's sister Clare, a recovering heroin addict). This show does not shy away from unpleasantness, in the town and in the people, and as other reviewers have mentioned, it does contain violence, but doesn't LINGER on it. Just as a benchmark, I found Wire In The Blood horrifyingly violent, and had to stop watching midway through, even though I am a big fan of Robson Green. Happy Valley handles the violence better.

I must admit I am delighted to see a middle-aged woman as the star, it's a nice change from the very slick crime dramas in which the female investigators are young and physically flawless.(It irked me when the creators of Trial And Retribution replaced Kate Buffery (""Pat"") with Victoria Smurfit (""Roisin"") because Buffery was not glamourous enough and refused to ""glam up""). Catherine is not perfect. Her personal problems sometimes get in the way of her making clear-headed decisions. Sometimes her hair is messy and sometimes she doesn't wear makeup. When the plot dictates that she must be weary, she LOOKS weary. When she tangles with the villain, she gets hurt, unlike the many heroines who suddenly launch into into heretofore unknown-to-the-viewer martial arts skills. Catherine is entirely believable.

I recommend this highly, and I am very much looking forward to season two of Happy Valley.",1445040000,4,1541,5.16

6389530,5,B00JRXHEAA,"Sally Wainwright is the creator of the Scott & Bailey crime drama and the bittersweet dramedy Last Tango in Halifax.  She is a very, very skilled writer.  Sarah Lancashire is one of the principals in Last Tango in Halifax.  She and Wainwright have now combined their considerable talents to bring us Happy Valley, a gritty crime drama set in a valley in Yorkshire which is happy because of the drug-induced moods that characterize its populace.

Lancashire plays Catherine Cawood, a former detective who has stepped down to the role of sergeant because of family needs and pressures.  Her formerly-heroin-addicted sister is played by Siobhan Finneran, who most will know as Coras maid Sarah OBrien on Downton Abbey.  Catherine and her sister Clare are raising Catherines troubled grandson, Ryan, the son of her daughter Rebecca who was raped by a neer-do-well named Tommy Lee Royce and then, having given birth to his son, committed suicide.

Royce (played by James Norton, the rev. Sidney Chambers in Grantchester) has just gotten out of prison and has joined forces with a local drug dealer, Ashley Cowgill (Joe Armstrong, the scary mirror image of his father Alun Armstrong, the great British character actor).

Kevin Weatherill, an accountant at a local company, hopes to see his daughters attend a top flight public (i.e. private) school but needs a raise from his boss, Nevison Gallagher.  When Nevison at first balks at the idea, Kevin approaches Ashley Cowgill and suggests that he kidnap Nevisons daughter and rip off Nevison for a hefty ransom, part of which Kevin will pocket and use for his tuition bills.

So you see where this is all going.  With Royce now in cahoots with Cowgill, we have a kidnap story which will involve the valleys drug culture, its rich, its poor and its general sense of desperation in the face of economic realities.  Catherine will renew her relationship with Tommy Lee Royce and her family, her community, and her very existence will be seriously threatened.  In short, we have a 6-hour miniseries that has been plotted by a pro who also knows the local territory like the back of her hand.

The result is a heavyweight crime drama with lots of blood, lots of suspense and a sense of realism that is both compelling and disturbing.  Block out the full six hours before you begin to watch it, because you will not be able to stop once you begin.

Highly recommended.",1423353600,7,2405,4.857843137254902
6389531,5,B00JRXHEAA,"Sgt. Catherine Cawood is the toughest cop on TV hands down! From the tongue in cheek title to the Bugg theme song, I love this show so much! You have seen this kind of drama and family issues from a male cop perspective but Sara Lancashire brings this home as a female cop with incredible strength. I watch a LOT of cop shows and this one is amazing. Watched this back to back with The Fall and where Gillian Anderson's cop is conflicted has a slightly vulnerable and sociopathic fascination, Sara Lancashire's cop is dogged, determined and battling demons based in the futility of cleaning up her little town and keeping her unraveling family together.  Every character in this story is authentic and believable. Even the villan, superbly played by James Norton are completely genuine. So much so that it is hard to see him as anyone else but Tommy Royce for me now. Despite the tempation to find a sympathy for his pathology, he is totally wrecked.

Cudos to BBC for bringing us woman protagonists who show that not all women who go down into the scary basement end up victims. I'm a big fan of Scott And Bailey series but their story occurs after they have moved up from the street cop hard life. I Love Lanashire's stoicism, strength and sense of right and wrong! Unlike American TV girl cops who Kung fu in their cat suits, never have cuts or bruises or shoot their past rapists then get their dream boyfriend, the BBC seems to realize that woman are tough and fight for their family, their self respect and despite all the damage, just keep enduring. I guess that's why we've never had a female President. Please keep this stuff up BBC so those of us on the other side of the pond in fantasyland can have the kind of quality TV we can't get over here! Viewer tip: keep those subtitles on. The genuinely Yorkshire accents are tough for us Yanks.",1423353600,3,1850,4.519402985074627

However, she is supported by an equalling brilliant cast in this dark tale of evil lurking beneath the seemingly prosaic world of the post-industrial, West Yorkshire market town of Hebden Bridge.

Catherines domestic life is tangled with tragedy at its core and she seeks to assuage the guilt she feels through her police work and the raising of her young grandson. But the release from prison of Tommy Lee Royce, chillingly played by James Norton, who Catherine blames for the suicide of her daughter, sparks a series of dramatic events of Jacobean proportions!

The unbeatable team of actress Sarah Lancashire and writer Sally Wainwright has produced a refreshingly intelligent protagonist, a complex but 'followable' plot and a supporting cast whose backstories actually pertain to the drama at hand. From the opening scene  where Lancashire, a Yorkshire cop wielding a fire extinguisher, tries to talk a methhead out of offing himself with fire on a playground, to the closing shot of her gazing solemnly out over the gorgeous Yorkshire countryside, you'll find yourself wishing for a second season, and that it come quickly. This is the only series I found compelling enough to 'binge-watch'.  I felt the series was written by an adult, for adults and - shockingly - about a regular, everyday adult women as the central character. What a relief to see a middle-aged, brave-but-flawed, caring but steely woman getting it done. Can't wait for season two.....",1421193600,4,1121,5.245810055865922

6389542,5,B00JRXHEAA,"BBC has always been good in regard to writing and acting. For many years though their production values have been lacking. Over the past 10 years or so they've really stepped it up on that end which has given them the whole package. This is a testament to how good the BBC has become.

Here's the scoop. In a rather sleepy English town bad things are brewing. The vice president of a company, who thinks he deserves more money, has arranged for the kidnapping of his boss's daughter. But he just isn't cut out for this sort of thing. At the same time a female police sergeant sees that a man responsible for her daughter's suicide (due to the daughter's rape) has been released from prison. These two stories end up becoming one.

It's difficult to convey how good this really is. Much has to do with the fact that the plot itself is good and it's supported by characters who have their own back stories that affect the way they deal with the plot points. The police sergeant Catherine Cawood, played extremely well by Sarah Lancashire, has a lot of luggage. She's divorced, living with a sister who is a recovering drug addict and playing mother to her grandson who is the offspring of her daughter's rape. The casting as a whole is impeccable. The V.P. who commissions the kidnapping is a spineless little puke who realizes right off that he's way out of his depth. I didn't feel as though I was watching an actor. I felt like I was watching a real person. All the actors are THAT good.

The plot unfolds like a blooming flower with each petal revealing some new fact or twist. It's well shot with good attention played to this seemingly idyllic place with a dark underbelly. The sergeant's grandchild becoming the obsession of his real father (and part of the kidnapping crew) was forced and forced the ending. But I have to forgive it that in light of all the other strengths present here. This is a remarkable effort up there with ""True Detective"" and ""Broadchurch."" If you like crime thrillers, this is about as good as it gets.",1415491200,7,2034,4.536784741144414

6389544,3,B00JRXHEAA,"Spoiler alert:  Happy Valley isn't happy.  It's a place that might have been created by the Cohen brothers if they lost their sense of humor.

Let's hope the ghastly world of Happy Valley doesn't resemble reality, anywhere.  But if it does, the thought of a single policewoman on foot, chasing a truck driven by two drug dealers, with nothing but a baton is both idiotic and terrifying.  And that is, by far, not the worst of it.  Even if you enjoy Happy Valley's level of explicit violence, which makes Dirty Harry look like SpongeBob Squarepants, the final showdown is surprisingly subdued.  In other words, Happy Valley manages to be both too explicitly violent and then arguably, not violent enough.  Without spoiling the fun, I'll tell you that by the end, you'll surely agree the baddest bad guy deserves an excruciating death.  He even provides the means.  But no.  After the viewer is brought to a point where anything imaginable would seem morally justified, there's a brief tussle and he's off to the hospital.  A sequel, perhaps.  Interestingly, the folks telling this cheery tale draw the line at depicting sexual assault but honestly, I don't know why.

Yes, it's well acted and the story, although predictable, is a good one.  But it's very sad and ugly.  Let no one say folks in the UK are not up to the task of showing bad things done to good people in the most sadistic way.",1414022400,7,1391,4.68595041322314

I won't go into plot details on this gritty, great crime drama - other reviewers have amply covered that.  I'd just like to say that this show is riveting and you will want to allow time to binge-watch it.  Sarah Lancashire is outstanding as dedicated, troubled cop Catherine Cawood.  The other performers are excellent too.  While the plot's resemblance to the movie ""Fargo"" is undeniable, it stands on its own merits.  If you like shows like ""Fargo"" or ""Breaking Bad"" you will most likely enjoy this one.  Be aware that the Yorkshire accents can be difficult to understand if you don't watch a lot of Brit TV shows.  We had no problem with it but my brother said he used the subtitles/captioning feature.

I hope the rumors of a second season are true; I'd love to see more!  Check it out; very highly recommended.",1414022400,4,995,4.533707865168539
6389546,5,B00JRXHEAA,"I watched this all of last evening on netflix. I had planned on watching one episode! So it was riveting fair. This is a UK tv police based drama. It is very gritty, realistic and violent. It is also excellent. But those who do not like a lot of violence may be put off. There are three scenes looking back at a young girl's suicide and other scenes involving another young girl's kidnapping and multiple rapes, just to name a few. This made me like the series more rather than less though.

Sarah Lancashire gives a solid performance as Police Sergeant Catherine Cawood in Yorkshire. She is one tough cookie and she needs to be. Catherine's own family has had to make massive readjustments in the wake of her own daughter's death and Catherine's decision to raise her daughter's child. When a girl in her community is kidnapped, this crime cuts uncomfortably close to the upheaval in Catherine's own family.

The villains in this story are also excellent. This is just one crime over all of the episodes not one crime per episode. I liked this, being able to fully get into the one crime rather than bouncing around. In that sense it is like ""Broadchurch"" which was also wholly concerned with only one crime.

This was recommended to me by a friend who ordinarily watches NO mystery or crime shows (whereas I love them). I am amazed she made it through the violence in this but she explains that the story was just too good for her to stop watching. I concur.

6389553,5,B00JRXHEAA,"Purely by chance I binge watched Last Tango in Halifax and loved it. It was recommended by a friend. So just browsing through Amazon Prime instant video, I saw a series called The Paradise and binged on it too without realizing for two episodes that the manager of the ladies department was Sarah Lancashire. She was spot on in both series. Then I accidentally found Happy Valley and recognized her from both the above and had to binge watch it too. Her best performance yet. She's a no-nonsence former detective who is still on the police force, but had to take a less stressful managerial  position because of family issues you will find so challenging, and wonder how she can juggle all these problems without burning out. But she is not afraid to overstep her boundaries and become entangled in a kidnapping scheme that goes bad and involves a man who caused a great tragedy in her home life. Suffice it to say, Sarah Lancashire is so compelling in this role that you will have to push that play button six times in a row because you get so immersed in her personal and professional life. I want to thank Amazon for their Prime instant video, which is just one of the perks of the Prime membership. I would recommend this program to anyone who does a lot of shopping on-line for convenience or because of physical challenges they have like mine which makes shopping a huge chore. Amazon has everything, or seems to have. I've used my Prime perks for four years now and have made over 700 purchases which come to me in only two days with no shipping fees and let's me watch thousands of movies, tv series, and keeps track of every transaction I make in 'the cloud' for free in case of problems I may have in the future.

6389554,4,B00JRXHEAA,"If you like ""Brit Grit"" (gritty British crime) you will definitely like this one. It is very fast-paced and intense, and deals with some very tough issues. The series is well-written and unlike many cop shows, we get as much of a look into the private lives of the law enforcement people as we do the crimes and criminals. This is a review of the Netflix presentation which I watched on my Roku device (Happy Valley is a BBC/Netflix production). There are six one-hour episodes which will be difficult to watch at six different times; the series is so enthralling that you will want to do a marathon viewing session.

I may be biased as I have always enjoyed books, programs and films about Great Britain and it's people, particularly those set in the present day. This series is set in Yorkshire and features many northern accents, but none are incomprehensible, and the average viewer should not have much trouble understanding the dialogue. If you do, you can choose the subtitles.

The series focuses on Catherine Cawood, a middle-aged, divorced police sergeant who has a grown son, an ex-husband who has just lost his job at the local newspaper, an eight-yr. old  grandson who lives with her, and is the result of a rape of her daughter by the evil Tommy Lee Royce, who is being released from prison. The daughter hung herself not long after her child was born. Many in the family, her son and husband included, were against Catherine's decision to raise the boy, rather than put him in (foster) care. The last resident of the home is Catherine's sister, a recovering heroin addict.

One of the great things about this series, and many British series, is that they do tend to employ rather ordinary-looking people in key roles. I would say that this is deliberate. The average woman is not terrifically beautiful, nor is the average man tremendously handsome. Because we do not have physically ideal people in the roles, we can relate more to them. What they say and do seems much more credible. Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous this is not! The acting by all of the characters is superb. Particularly outstanding is Steve Pemberton as the wimpy accountant who wants to send his girls to a more exclusive school than he can afford on his present salary. When he seeks a pay rise (we in US call it a pay raise), and his boss turns him down, he takes some desperate and ill-advised measures. The character, and his idiotically egregious behavior, will remind you strongly of William H. Macy (""Jerry Lundegaard"") in the Coen's epic Fargo.

There are quite a few unsavory characters in the story, and a theme which runs through it is: how far is one willing to go to gain such-and-such? The guy who ran the caravan camp, Ashley, a married man with two daughters, was sweetening his take by handling drugs on the side. His brassy, bleached-blonde wife was all too accustomed to his nefarious activities, and the scenes of her warning him about transgressing the law were particularly noteworthy. ""If you've sold us down the river, I""ll""......you get the point.

Several other reviewers legitimately raised the point that the women police in the show were constantly and needlessly putting themselves in dangerous situations. For example, not calling for back-up, or not taking a firearm for defensive measures. This is a valid point, but there may be the beginning of an explanation in the fact that England is a much safer country than the US. Guns are much harder to obtain, criminals may not have as much access to them, so cops don't feel the need to carry. Also, it was a small town; in some of those small English towns the typical 'crime' might consist of vandalism or petty theft. As to Catherine's rash decisions to singlehandedly confront Royce, she obviously 'saw red', particularly when Royce zeroes in on her grandchild (and his son!).  Remember, this is the guy who basically killed her daughter. She did state that she wanted to--I'm paraphrasing here--""grind his scrotum into the dirt with [her] filthiest pair of boots!"" Her rage at this guy was so great that she would probably have done him in and then tried to cover her tracks. Or so she said, on more than one occasion. [SPOILER ALERT] But in the end, even after he beats her to within an inch of her life, she has the self-control to NOT kill him.

The young female police constable (played by an actress who WAS probably too beautiful, though she was a bit 'de-glammed' for the role) did act carelessly in handling the road stop involving the speeding white transit van. We were all screaming for her to pay heed to the yellow mini Cooper which, for some reason, also stopped, but she did not catch on. But again, I would suggest that the furthest thing from her mind was that she would be run down deliberately. This sort of thing would just not happen in and around a sleepy Yorkshire town.

The Brits do these crime things quite well. Statistically very few actual murders or serious crimes take place in England, yet look at how many British crime writers/books/TV shows there are. Perhaps they look at our US murder rate, and all of the horrible and heinous things we Yanks do to each other, and transpose it to their situation? Whatever it is, it makes for gripping entertainment.....",1410480000,3,5265,4.714130434782609
6389555,5,B00JRXHEAA,"In Short: Sergeant Cawood is one tenacious woman. Her own daughter, a rape victim, hung herself weeks after giving birth to a son. The product of rape. Cawood cares for her grandson as she decisively handles neighborhood crime. Too soon her daughters rapist makes bail. Feeling it imperative, she resolutely endeavors to keep tabs on him and steer her grandson out of his path. Of course, there is also a kidnapping and the death of one of her officers.

""Happy Valley"" is another great crime drama and thriller. Cawood is relentless and brave and I love it! She doesn't lack a sense of humor either. And the bad guys... they are definitely bad. All of the cast did a wonderful job. The plot is gripping and sinister. There are a few violent scenes and some strong language.",1409270400,,774,4.649635036496351
6389556,3,B00JRXHEAA,"Happy Valley is a well-observed ""slice of life"" style drama, the plot of which other reviewers have covered amply. For me the most interesting aspect of the series is that it explores in excruciating detail what Hanna Arendt called ""the banality of evil."" Basically this is a story of petty scheming, stupidity, incompetence, and uncaring cruelty that wrecks lives for no meaningful purpose whatsoever. As things go wrong, it's the ruthless psycho-rapist who takes control and who thereby escalates an awful situation into an absolutely terrible one from which there is no return. You could arguably take this series as a metaphor for the rise of any despot: Stalin, Hitler, Pol Pot, Putin... this is merely misrule writ tiny in a Yorkshire valley; the same phenomenon wrecks millions of lives when it occurs on the political level. And the despots all begin just as the psycho-rapist does: as petty criminal types who push and push whenever they see an opportunity, seeing others merely as tools to be used and discarded whenever necessary.  In short this is hugely insightful into basic human nature and for that reason, above all others, worth watching despite the emotional discomfort it will cause in normal, sane, people.",1409011200,3,1227,5.074257425742574

6389559,3,B00JRXHEAA,"Very good series.  But there are aspects that really strain my sense of real police procedure.  This cop goes after a bunch of cop killers -- and doesn't have the good sense to call in her position during the worst and most dangerous parts of her tracking the bad guys.  She's got no police sense.  Most of these cops seems to have no police sense.  They are kind of thick for cops.  Chasing murderers and kidnappers, and no one even straps on a weapon just in case.  The cops do bad work, which is why they keep getting into trouble.  NYPD Blue -- not.

But great acting.  A good story.  Lousy police work.

The main woman is in my opinion a bit miscast.  She's too old (my age) to be that tough. And it seems like she is being asked to take on big trouble almost single handedly.

Worth seeing.",1408838400,3,796,4.22

Troubles are found
In this trouble town
Words do get 'round'

Lyrics to 'Trouble Town'- by Jake Bugg, theme song of Happy Valley

'HappyValley' is one of those towns so misnamed, that you wonder as you drive through, who in their right mind named this town. In Series one it took me until Episode 3 to really get into this series. Until then, it was one of those series with an interesting but violent story lines. But, then, the adventures and personalities of the characters hooked me. It is one of those series where you really come to care for the characters.
And, now in Series two, the series has really hit it's mark.q

Sally Wainwright, who wrote 'The Last Tango In Halifax' wrote this series, and it has more of the tough, brutal, real scenes, we don't see in The Last Tango. The characters are very real, very complex and some are downright nasty. Sarah Lancashire plays Catherine Cawood, you will note her from 'The Last Tango In Halifax'. She is a Police Sargeant in this area, and this is her life. Her daughter hanged herself in the first series, and Catherine took in her grandson. Clare, Catherine's sister, played by Siobhan Finneran, (O'Brien from Downton Abbey), is superb in this role. She is a recovering drug and alcohol addict, working in a Mission and helping to care for the boy. The boy's psychopathic father plays a large role in this series, and a nastier piece of work you will never see. In season 2 he us finally in prison, but still up to no good. All of the police are well played and realistic. The area of Yorkshire in England is as beautiful as it is deadly.

Police Sargeant Cawood has a mess of trouble coming her way. You might think after the last series, she would be due an a diet life. No break for Catherine. An older woman is found dead and mutilated, and then more women are found. A respected detective having an affair gets in over his head. Catherine's young grandson and Catherine's sister, find themselves in difficulty. Through out it all, the police department stays ahead of the game or at least on an uneven keel. Lancashire is put to the test even more, and her character is often in over her head. The acting is superb, Lancashire deserves any and all accolades coming her way, no make-up, dishes end hair, she comes across as a true professional right on the edge. Several actors from Downton Abbey are here, and they pull their weight. In six episodes this series delivers a true punch.

6389561,5,B00JRXHEAA,"HAPPY VALLEY, (2014).  This new, contemporaneously set British mystery/ police procedural television series was made by the combination of the BBC and Netflix.  It comes from  Sally Wainwright, recently the creator of LAST TANGO IN HALIFAX and SCOTT AND BAILEY, two new tremendously entertaining shows that lead me to say: Who says there's no such thing as good things come in threes?

This dark, suspenseful police drama stars Sarah Lancashire, LAST TANGO IN HALIFAX, THE PARADISE, CORONATION STREET, LARK RISE TO CANDLEFORD, as Yorkshire police sergeant Catherine Cawood, a strong-willed officer coping with the suicide of her daughter and struggling to raise the young son her daughter left behind. When the man she blames for her daughter's death is paroled, Cawood embarks on a mission to bring him down, unaware that her target is plotting another heinous crime.  Soon, a staged kidnapping spirals out of control, turning into a brutal series of crimes.  Catherine finds herself involved in something significantly higher than her pay rank, and too close to home for comfort.  The series, currently only available in Region 2 format and streaming, comes with subtitles, thank goodness, else whatever would those of us on my side of the pond do with the flavorful Yorkshire accents and idioms?

Catherine is a no-nonsense tough police sergeant who is not afraid of a fight, and heads a team of officers in a rural Yorkshire valley that is overcome with illegal drugs.  She had been a detective, but her daughter's suicide and the necessity of raising her grandson Ryan led her to seek demotion back to sergeant.  She is a middle-aged woman with the instincts and insights of a true detective, who lives with her recovering addict sister; her son's not speaking to her, and she seems to have an on-again off-again relationship with her--remarried--ex-husband Richard.  She is a riveting, intensely watchable, creation.  Lancashire, who is seamlessly into the part, is ably supported by Siobhan Finneran as Catherine's sister Clare, and, in the cop shop, by Sophie Rundle as Kirsten McAskill, her protg, whose death will start the unwinding of the various conspiracies afoot.  George Costigan, unforgettable as Joe Bevan in SCOTT AND BAILEY, plays local businessman Nevison Gallagher.  The handsome James Norton, RUSH, BELLE, makes a nasty, violent bad boy, Tommy Lee Royce.  Joe Armstrong is another distasteful local villain, Ashley Cowgill. The episodes are:

1. Royce, whom Catherine blames for her daughter's death is released.  A hasty nefarious scheme hatched by a disgruntled employee shatters Nevison (Nev) Gallagher.
2. Catherine gets a hint as to Royce's location; Helen Gallagher, who is dying of cancer, is shocked by her daughter's abduction.
3. Tommy brutally takes control of the situation when Officer McAskill, Catherine's young protg, pulls over the villains' van which is missing a rear light.  His actions will have devastating consequences.
4. Catherine and Royce meet face to face when he discovers he is Ryan's father.  A more sinister discovery leaves her fighting for her life.
5. Catherine is in depression over her inability to find Royce; law enforcement closes in on Gallagher's employee.
6. At Catherine's birthday party, her drunken son Daniel, from whom she has long been estranged, gives her his view of their past family history.  She fears her grandson Ryan is spending time with his father Royce.

The photography is fine; Yorkshire looks forbidding, busy, beautiful.  The plot is tight, turning, twisty, riveting: I binge watched the six virtually hour-long episodes at a sitting - not at all easy to do.  Wainwright, who has recently penned two tremendously involving and powerful Yorkshire-filmed shows, here turns out a third.  Although, mind you, at the beginning of her career, she did give us THE AMAZING MRS PRITCHARD, which I found positively meretricious: it may be time to pull the curtains on that one.  But I tell you, the two locally born women, Wainwright (Yorkshire) and Lancashire (not-too-far Lancashire), are, seemingly a dream team who can put no foot wrong when they work together.",1408665600,3,4142,5.201807228915663

6389563,5,B00JRXHEAA,"After watching both series (with the third on the way) of Sally Wainright's Last Tango in Halifax -- twice each -- I looked for her other work. I found Happy Valley (an off-putting though ironic name), also starring Sarah Lancashire, a top actor who plays a police sargeant in a small town (the jazzy theme song says 'the best thing about it is when I leave it') used to acting-out drunks and car theft, a very different role from her 'head of a respected private school' in 'Halifax'.

As police sargeant 'Catherine' is outraged when the brutal rapist and cause of her daughter's death isn't charged with that but with a lesser charge for which he's served eight years and just been released.

Catherine has brought up her daughter's eight-year old son, played by an excellent actor, Rhys Connah. All the actors are excellent.

Sally Wainright's themes, both in '...Halifax' and Happy Valley, are women being raped and abused and their getting back at their abusers, and the complications revenge entails. For anyone who has been treated in this way these are satisfying stories. Halifax has a lot of small but spot-on humor, and Happy Valley doesn't.  But HV winds up in a healing and satisfied way. There is a series 2 and 3.

Sally Wainright is an excellent dialoguist and story plotter, both. Her incisive and empathetic understanding of the intricacies of multi-generational family life raises these two series way above the usual. Directing is seamless in both series.
(The only thing distracting in Happy Valley is Catherine's sister's big, obvious wig. Why a wig? Why this one?)",1404691200,34,1587,4.884758364312268
8653624,5,B00JRXHEAA,On a previous review somone wrote too violent. To each his(or her)own. I worked for a police dept for over 30 years. The writer of this show was spot n! Some people(not all)are sick individuals. Unfortunately they take it out on those who cannot defend themselves. A side they also have  in this show is how it affects the officers who deal w/both victims and suspects. Not all stories have happy endings and the happy endings we get are sometimes entertwined w/loss and disappointmnt (like the rapists who was nevercharged w/rape and is released to do it again).I love this show and ALL the actors in it. It also reveals  the lighter side of the job and how different people handle violence in different ways. I love the part where the victim starts fighting like a mad woman when she realizes the Sgt maybe losing the fight with her rapist and how they both beat him down. AT LAST they actually show what a woman would actually do in such a situation and not stand in a corner crying doing nothing to help the person who is their last chance for freedom.

8653626,2,B00JRXHEAA,"Of course the acting is superb all around.  The problem with this series is the really unnecessary graphic violence.  Apparently BBC viewers did comment on this, and it has validity.  The first three episodes are excellent if one can get past the horror.  Episodes 4 and 5 spun off into ridiculous territory as so many of these TV series unfortunately do, thus ruining an otherwise outstanding story frame.  The overly personal intertwining of killer and police officer became tedious, unrealistic and plain not believable.  Boring is how it felt and we probably won't pursue seeing this series.  Writers really have to know when to draw the line in a story and not extend the ""cash cow"" so it lacks quality.  This is what happened here.",1530403200,,737,4.84
