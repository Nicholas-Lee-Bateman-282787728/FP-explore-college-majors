3921838,4,B002FE5XTC,"Aaw must leave her home in the forests of Thailand in order to try and make enough money to afford her grandmother's medicine, using any means necessary. This leads her into the seedy underbelly of Bankok, where she is forced to sell her body and dance at a local bar. After being repeatedly used and abused, Aaw casts her grandmother's spells to exact revenge against those who wronged her. But when she fails to follow her grandmother's three basic rules, the magic turns against her and transforms her into a bloodthirsty demon! Paul Spurrier's dark possession tale is deeply rooted in Thai culture and superstition, bringing a unique new twist to the saturated supernatural theme. P. offers a strong moralistic undertone that revenge is never the path to righteousness, no matter how much someone has been wronged. The decisive use of color sets a clear mood for each of the exotic locations, with the lush greens of Aaw's forest home contrasted against the cold grays of the city and the strip club's saturated reds. Unlike the cliche black-haired, pale-skinned ghosts that have populated Asia's ghost films over the last decade, Aaw's alter self is a terrifying cat-like demon with glowing yellow eyes that protrude from the darkness only moments before she strikes. The weight of the film's success lies in the young actress Suangporn Jaturaphut's phenomenal performance, who shows an incredible range as she bounces between playing the innocent peasant girl, a wild seductress, and ultimately a fearsome killer. As frightening as it is well-made, P. is one of the scariest films to come out of Thailand since SHUTTER!

8369000,5,B002FE5XTC,"Breaking Bad in Bangkok. Director Paul Spurrier takes a shot at the horror film genre in this  thriller about an upcountry village girl with Cambodian roots who migrates to the Bangkoks famous bar scene. This theme has been endlessly albeit artlessly developed by other filmmakers, and is standard fare for Thai audiences, who are connoisseurs of the genre. But here Spurrier aims freshly to take delight in the detail, and that means faultless accuracy including uncommercial use of Cambodian-flavored Thai language throughout, all  to catch the real spirit,  so to speak. My village-born Thai  wife hugely enjoyed the film and said she was amazed at its precision; Even the laundry in the apartment is hanging the right way"" she said, having lived the life herself. The story happily skips the usual moralizing stereotypes as sweet Dau transforms from loving child caring for her ailing grandmother to Sin City innocente, and then to something else entirely. Grannie has a few Cambodian prophylactics for her to pack in her little bag and before long Dau is deploying her wicked tricks in Bangkoks red light bar scene. A few leering suitors are briskly dispatched with Odyssean resolve. But what happens to poor little Dau in this process? My wife said that she found it hard to accept that such a wonderful child could go so creepy so quickly, but then that's the way a lot of folks felt about Walter White, the anti-hero of the celebrated TV series Breaking Bad. Viewers whether old hand expats or armchair travelers will like this deft blend of fantasy and reality bubbling in a steamy corner of Asian life but ever so easily downloaded from Amazon Prime for less than a tenner.",1383177600,,1683,4.894736842105263

As her co-workers begin to supplant her efforts, the girl falls back on her grandmother's magical training to get even. Unfortunately, she ignores grandma's warnings, and drifts into the dark side of magic. This leads to demonic possession, murder, and mutilation. Another Asian horror gem...",1369353600,,579,4.918367346938775

The you hero/villan is likeable and you feel for her, but at the same time I was shocked by her circumstances.  I think you'll like this one.",1362787200,,318,4.431034482758621

8369005,3,B002FE5XTC,"If you are a long time fan of horror movies you will be disappointed in this one since it is very predictable from start to finish.
Special effects and film quality do not match up to the brand name.
OK for first time viewers of horror films but not for old-timers like me who are fans of imported horror films.",1331683200,,311,4.2
