The ""Brotherhood of Destruction""
--- An action-packed collection of explosive car crash stunts ---

The stunts performed by the Brotherhood of Destruction as they tour the country would make most Hollywood stuntmen quake in their boots. Mark Hager is their leader -- a world-record smashing stunt driver with a PhD in the science of breaking things. After eighteen years of mayhem, Hagers damage-path has sent hundreds of cars to the junkyard and occasionally himself to the hospital.

Now Marks protg and long-time safety crew member, Brad Baldino, has stepped up to join the car-crashing ranks. Strap yourself in and join the BOD as they crash the countrys largest and most prestigious events and venues (i.e. Alamo Dome, Reliant Stadium, Lowe's Motor Speedway) as the Brotherhood of Destruction.

Take a behind the scenes look at what it takes to prepare for and perform one of these crowd pleasing stunts. Viewers are guaranteed to hold their breath as they watch a never seen before drivers-eye-view of the ride these guys take off their ramp, through a barrage of pyrotechnics, and ultimately crash-landing in a row of parked cars.

Est. Running Time: 43 minutes

Plus over 25 minutes of bonus music videos, including stunts from Hagers early career, as well as, his infamous 213-foot bus jump at a Charlotte Motor Speedway NASCAR event.

Featuring music from The Kottonmouth Kings, Humble Gods, Mower, Judge D, One Session, Last Laugh, Too Rude, Dirtball, Sub Noize Souljaz, 5 Billion Dead, and Slowly Taking Lives.
