8708966,1,B00V2W3R3M,The DVDs DO NOT WORK. The movies themselves are timeless pieces of world cinema. The physical dvds simply don't play the movies. They are glitchy every 6 seconds. It would be over priced at $1.,1465084800,2,193,4.542857142857143

If you search for other content that's sold under the ""Star Entertainment"" studio (a 100% fake company BTW), you'll notice that reviewers mention them as bootleg. This is no different. Do you really think legally licensed Ghibli films that typically sell for around $20 individually would somehow legally sell 17 films for $90?  For this garbage, $90 is a complete ripoff, I'd probably buy the set for $15.  No more.  Furthermore the official US licenses of various Ghibli films are owned by different companies (Fox Video, Disney...) and there's no way they would collaborate to such a fashion to sell such a compilation for so cheap. Even if you try to argue that they somehow have a legal Malaysian license, they don't (the whole ""official"" hologram"" BS is exactly that ""BS"". If you search for them all you'll get is a small set of results on sites they (illegaly) sell like Amazon. Do everyone a favor and don't buy these bootlegs and support the legal business...and do yourself a favor by not buying a collection with horrible aspect ratio, subs and/or video quality.

This is *not* a licensed Studio Ghibli product. In fact, it's not even a particularly good bootleg. The DVDs are amateurishly mastered; this means the DVDs internal labeling structure is screwed up, in some cases the wrong subtitles were included, language codes are often incorrect, etc. Worst of all, the original videos were ripped at reduced bitrate MPEG2 (the video codec used in DVDs) in order to make 2-3 videos fit on a single dual-layer DVD. Unlike modern MPEG4-based codecs, MPEG2 doesn't handle reduced bitrate gracefully at all, meaning there is a direct and noticeable impact on visual clarity. To put it plainly, the video quality is horrible. People saying the video quality is flawless either have very poor quality screens, eye problems, or are simply speaking out of ignorance. The raw audio was extracted from the original DVDs, however, so that at least is lossless and will sound exactly like the real licensed product. Which, by the way, you should be buying instead of this knockoff.

I realize this box set is much cheaper than buying all of the real Studio Ghibli videos one at a time, and there's some appeal there. But the difference in quality alone is worth it, not to mention the special features, and the fact that you're not buying pirated media. Don't kid yourself, that's exactly what this is.",1460160000,20,2464,4.840855106888361

8708971,1,B00V2W3R3M,I am extremely disappointed. It had good reviews when I bought it. I bought this as a gift and when if arrived I opened it up to see the condition and test whether or not the discs worked. The first thing I noticed was that the discs were in poor condition. I tested the discs in my computer. My computer attempted to read the discs and then immediately rejected them. Whatever is wrong with these it is not worth it. I should have known the price was too good to be true. I will be returning these as soon as possible.,1451260800,15,519,4.148514851485149
8708972,5,B00V2W3R3M,"I messaged the seller and requested to have this ship faster. I needed it for Christmas because this was my daughter's ""big"" gift. The seller responded quickly and shipped ASAP and DHL. I got it VERY fast.
The set itself has great graphics on the box and on each DVD. I am very pleased with the overall appearance. It was packaged well in bubble wrap and a box. There was no damage in shipping.
So far we have watched My Neighbor Totoro and Ponyo both of which we already own on separate DVD's. Totoro did pause in one spot but kicked back on quickly right where we left off. There are no other issues thus far. My 14 year old daughter loves these movies and she is pleased with the quality. My 2 year old son was captivated by them as well. These movies really kept his attention which was surprising to me. I will update my review when we watch more of the DVD's.",1451260800,,865,4.248484848484848
