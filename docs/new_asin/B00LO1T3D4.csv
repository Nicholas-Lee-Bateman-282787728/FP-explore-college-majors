6493742,5,B00LO1T3D4,"Remember seeing this in the movie theater as a kid.  Started hunting for this title a few years back, as the first anime that I have seen.  Finally found it available on Amazon.  A little rough as compared to today's anime, it has an engaging story of Satsuke who trains to be a wizard.  The dvd is of good quality, but is copy protected, which on certain DVD players the video has a slight glitch or two.  Played perfectly on my Sony DVD player with excellent video quality.",1449964800,,475,4.3522727272727275
6493743,5,B00LO1T3D4,My husband talked his dad into taking him to this when it first showed in 1961.  They both loved it then.  My husband was thrilled to get this for his birthday this year for old time's sake!,1431907200,,190,4.108108108108108

6493745,4,B00LO1T3D4,"A historical book on Japanese anime suggests that this may have been the first anime ever to make commercially broadcast to the states.  It was a very limited release, but we had a large theater that had just opened called the Holiday Theater in Fort Wayne.  They were known for showing unusual stuff.  One of their early pictures my Dad took us too there was Shane, which I thought was a new movie at the time but the theater opened about 1959 or 1960, and Shane was a 1953 release, the year of my birth.  Despite the limited run of prints in the US, this movie made it to Fort Wayne.  My Dad, who had been through Brazil, India, Burma, and China during WW2 as a cryptographer, developed a love for Eastern philosophy and culture, especially Chinese.  For years after I used to think this was a Chinese film I'd seen as around a seven year old.

This film would mean more to me than most people because I was impressed by the philosophy of the story.  Today it seems a bit shallow, but then I sensed something different.  Apart of the namby, pamby, Disney type fare, this movie had a real philosophy.  The feel was kind of a Karate Kid type of philosophy way before that time.  It means more to me because my late father took me too it, and because I thought he had a purpose in doing so.  That to interest me in the culture he loved.  I don't know if he even knew it was Japanese and not Chinese, I didn't till a few years after his death in 2005.  By then I had already collected hundreds of anime series and was a full blown fan, I thought he might have been a little intrigued by the fact he showed me my first Japanese anime over 40 years before.

The movie itself is well drawn and animated, but has a certain harshness to it, it has a true sense of danger, so kids prone to nightmares may not be the best choice.  This is not Disney, so don't expect the same reaction, but if you're kids are anything like I was it may help shape your view of the world and how people learn and react.  For kids the story is pretty good and action filled, despite some embedded philosophy, there is no heavy handed political or social messages here.  As a point of history as an anime collector this is a must have though.  I recommend it, but mostly for children, although adults at least would probably not fall asleep during this one.  Not exactly Studio Ghibli, but then the bar is set pretty high there, somewhat ahead of it's time at least.",1419120000,2,2437,4.26797385620915
6493746,3,B00LO1T3D4,"Remember this from my childhood. Still has magic but storyline not as interesting as newer movies.

Great as nostalgia.  glad I am able to own it and watch whenever I want.",1418169600,2,172,4.516129032258065

6493748,4,B00LO1T3D4,"I saw this when I was about 10 or so and it made a very big impression on me. All I could remember was this boy who was training to be a magician (shades of Mickey M!!). Somehow this film stuck in my mind and it was really a ""loner"" story. I could still identify with this film, but it sure ain't Disney!!

The body count is high as the good guys battle the evil witch and her minions. It is actually quite violent but in an unexpected way with plenty of blood etc. Something a bit amazing for the time and probably still would hold it's own against any live action movie of today.

The animation was good, especially for a Cinemascope film, reminiscent of Disney but with evil lurking underneath.

I'm glad I got it for it is part of my childhood (I'm in Australia).",1414800000,2,767,4.204081632653061

8667042,5,B00LO1T3D4,"Back in the early 1960s, my father was stationed at NAS Patuxent River in Lexington Park, Maryland.  As a young child of 7 or 8 years, (I can't remember which), I went to the Navy base theater one Saturday afternoon with my weekly allowance of 25 cents.  It was a dime to get into the theater, and 5 cents each for a soda, a bag of popcorn and a candy bar.  The movie being shown there was Magic Boy and after a diet of Disney, Max Fleischer and Tex Avery cartoons, I was totally blown away by this film!  And now, so many years later, it is finally available on DVD!!  I couldn't be happier to revisit one of the films from my youth that had such an impact on me and my young, developing sense of personal honor.  I still feel lucky to have a father who also encouraged this aspect of my personality and was wise enough to allow non-conventional methods such as a foreign film like Magic boy to aid in his teachings to me.  Is the movie dated?  In some ways, yes. But it is still a great film about personal responsibility that would be a good character building lesson for today's youth.",1474243200,,1089,4.2270531400966185
8667043,4,B00LO1T3D4,"This is a really great feature cartoon especially good for small children to pre teens. This was the first Amime ever seen in the United States in the early sixties. It is in cinemascope and has beautiful japanese art work. This is the Star Wars plot before Star Wars! A young boy wants to learn magic to battle the evil witch and her henchment that terrorize the village, the boy and his sister live in. He goes on a journey to find a great master magician to teach him his secrets. There are lots of cute animals that join him on his journey. Finally after training,the boy is ready to battle the evil witch who has taken his sister as captive. Aided by a handsom prince who wants to save the boys sister,the story leads us to the big battle of who has the greatest magic. A wonderful and colorful way to learn about Japanese culture and artful story telling. Adults will enjoy this too. Different than Disney and american animation features. A breath of fresh air with great style you may not have ever seen. I saw it as a child and always remembered the song ,music and wonderful story.",1451606400,,1090,4.4278606965174125
