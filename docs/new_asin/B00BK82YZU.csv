5635548,5,B00BK82YZU,"Very good foreign film about a couple hundred Polish soldiers defending a peninsula near Danzig/Gdansk, Poland in the first few days of WW 2 in Europe. I don't specifically know the history of this battle. But the storyline seems good, there's moral dilemmas, fear and bravery in battle, insubordination and difficult choices for the Polish. There are quite a few good action scenes. It's a foreign film, so don't expect something like Saving Private Ryan, Defiance or U571. In My opinion, if Your a fan of WW2 or Foreign films. This is well worth watching. Like a lot of foreign WW2 films I've seen it is longer and has noticeable dubbing. It would fit in the top ten or 20 (I watch a lot of foreign and foreign WW2) foreign films. I'll watch it again a few times I'm sure. I was slightly surprised they didn't mention the Communists attacking Poland from the East. Since they mentioned Britain and France declaring war on Germany. If those poor Polish Souls only knew what was in store for them for the next 50 years. Good film.",1377561600,39,1030,4.603260869565218
5635549,3,B00BK82YZU,"""If we go to war no one will back us up."" September 1st, 1939, the Polish city of Gdansk is an important port city that the German's are looking to take control of. Trying not to scare the entire country the army decides to send a small group of 600 soldiers against the Germans with only one goal, hold out for at least 12 hours. When it becomes clear that no support is coming for them and with dwindling supplies and medical aid they have to decide to fight till the last man falls or surrender. This is a true story of the first battle of WWII. This is not a terrible war movie at all and is worth seeing but it is pretty slow moving and the war scenes leave something to be desired. The movie is interesting though and really makes you understand what the Polls went through in the beginning of Hitler's advance but it is just a little too slow in some parts to stay fully focused on. Overall, a true war movie that is worth watching but don't expect wall to wall excitement. I give it a B-.",1376784000,38,996,4.16580310880829

5635558,4,B00BK82YZU,"SPOILER ALERT:  The good guys lose!

This is one of the most depressing movies I've ever seen.  This perhaps somewhat fictitious dramatization does, however, depict the gloominess, horror, confusion, betrayal, tedium, and atrocity of war - the historic Battle of Westerplatt in particular.

A Polish military officer is tasked with holding Westerplatt indefinitely until the Nazis attack, then for twelve hours once they do.  The presumption that the Nazis will attack Westerplatt is proven correct on September 1st, 1939.

The Polish officer obeys his orders, and fights off the Nazis for twelve hours.  Then the hours become days and a week of grief, heart-ache, terror, betrayal, politics, abandonment, and agony.

In spite of an insubordinate junior officer's insistence that they never surrender, the epileptic, hallucinating commander finally prevails, and surrenders.

The dramatization dissolves into what appears to be actual imagery of the surrender of the Polish to the Nazis.

Although I thought this film was very well made, my wife found the voice-over work very annoying.  We both agreed that it was one of the most depressing movies we've ever seen.",1467244800,,1165,5.3812154696132595
5635559,2,B00BK82YZU,"I bought this movie instead of renting it.  That was a mistake.  I will never watch it again.  This movie is controversial in Poland as many believe that it attacks national heroes and distorts the truth about Westerplatte which has been called Poland's Thermopylae.  For Americans, this symbol of Polish resistance, fortitude and heroism may be likened to the Alamo and this movie to the 2004 American movie THE ALAMO with Dennis Quaid and Billy Bob Thornton. The legends of both are obviously not the whole truth but attempts to examine those legends raise the ire of many people.  The famous line from the John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart movie, THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE comes to mind, ""When the legend becomes fact, print the legend""  Unfortunately the similarities end there, THE ALAMO was entertaining even if controversial.  WESTERPLATTE is not.  It is very slow and some of it doesn't even make sense, part of which may be  attributable to bad subtitles.  The combat scenes are ludicrous.  In many instances, a handful of German troops seem to almost stroll up to the Polish positions.  The actual combat in this battle was intense.  The Polish defenders were under almost unrelenting attack from the ground, air and sea.  This movie shows the Poles under the stress of combat without showing the reason why.

The acting is fine.  Some of it is outstanding.  The attention to detail in uniforms and weaponry is very good.  The music and cinematography are very good.  Alas, the movie is not.  For a person interested in WW2 or Poland the movie may be worth renting.  Those seeking only entertainment should look elsewhere.  The older black and white Westerplatte movie is much better.

I streamed this movie via Amazon so can not comment on any dvd's.",1466553600,15,1763,4.842281879194631
5635560,4,B00BK82YZU,"The acting would appear to be uninspired,  anti climatic ,unless in War there are no actors , just average people , that are forced to face extraordinary unpleasant circumstances, of War. The films theme attempts to convey the Historical Fact , that Hitler was not taken seriously,  and the unpreparedness of all concerned., as well as the  problem of incompetent officers , wearing Uniforms, that have no Military ability in War, like the Major of the Polish Garrison who is obsessed with his clean Uniform,  never leaves his office ,, goes insane during the fighting and is overbearing and condescending toward subordinates. The overall effect is not about the battle scenes, but the degrading  psychological process of War, that the Garrisons Soldiers had to fight against,  including their own mad Major, and the Germans.
The Movie begins showing the  placid daily routine of that time and place in Poland. The Major of the Garrison then arrives at his Quarters to find a Minister waiting for him, which was the politics of the day. The Minister explains that in case of War, the Major and the Garrison should resist for 12 Hours. This makes no sense to the Major who has a Military mindset , and is thinking in Military Terms of conducting War. The actors do not elaborate about what is happening,  which is the way things back then, for Soldiers who were making History acted, the actors do not provide the hollywood effect , of explaining everything, to the audience, if thats what  makes a good war movie.
The Movie portrays  War from the Command level on down , and how each individual confronted it. The battle scenes could have been better, with more fantastic effects, instead of the uncertain events  that are happening without any explanation, that may have the audience questioning the films Direction.  In terms of faithfully reproducing the unfortunate events of those days, this film captures it exactly without false heroics.",1460764800,,1944,4.929447852760736

5635568,5,B00BK82YZU,"This is a very good film that asks the question: when does brave resistance become futile sacrifice? There are plenty of battle scenes, but at the heart of the film is the conflict between the officers over whether to surrender.

Whether you'll like this movie depends on your taste. If action and impressive battle scenes are most important to you, then maybe this won't be your cup of tea. But if you like films that present a dilemma without spoon-feeding you an answer, then you will probably like this movie.

This film was made for Poles, who know about Westerplatte. It's not essential, but you'll get more out of the movie if you learn a little about the battle before you watch it.

The film has been criticised for its portrayal of the commander Sucharski (who wishes to surrender). I'll leave the historical debate to those who know more about it, but I do not think the film portrays him as a coward. There are scenes when he does not flinch when bombs explode nearby - scenes intended, I think, to show he is not a coward. A medical breakdown is not cowardice. His concern for his men is sincere. He is the only one who knows that there is no chance of help arriving. Both of the main characters are sympathetic figures - that is what makes the film so good.",1440374400,,1271,4.469827586206897

5635606,3,B00BK82YZU,"The Battle of Westerplatte was the first battle of World War II during the Nazi invasion of Poland. Though doomed from the start, the 200 soldiers garrisoned at Westerplatte held out for seven days, thus serving to inspire a nation as a symbol of resistance. In the process of enduring a naval bombardment, assault troops and dive bombers, the defenders of Westerplatte kept well over 3,000 German troops busy, buying time for other parts of Poland to prepare their defenses. The fact they didn't stand a chance only served to reinforce, in the eyes of Poland and the rest of the free world, how vital it was to stand up to Hitler.

Its great subject matter for a film, and writer/director Pawel Chochelew has come up with a winner for the most part, even managing to inject some truly artful moments into what could easily have been just another World War II film. The problem is the special effects mostly, and the staging of the battle scenes, in part. Lets face it, audiences are more sophisticated about CGI effects these days , so if you're going to use them, they have to be well done. The above-mentioned dive bombers are a particularly good example of bad special effects.

In Poland, the title of the film is slightly different, translating as THE SECRET OF WESTERPLATTE. Apparently the secret is that the men defending Westerplatte were actually commanded by Second in Command Capt Dabrowski, and not by Major Sucharski. While this is of only passing interest to audiences simply looking for a good war movie, it does aid the human interaction during the siege.

Apparently Major Sucharski had some sort of mental breakdown during the battle, which paved the way for Capt Dabrowskis taking over command. The scenes depicting Sucharskis breakdown (here interpreted as epilepsy) are very well done and the director manages to find a way to bring something fresh to the war movie genre. Interesting as this is, the poor special effects and sometimes ineptly shot battle scenes (the German soldiers frontal beach assault looks ridiculous) undermine these efforts at originality.

In the end, ones enjoyment of 1939 BATTLE OF WESTERPLATTE will be determined by what is more valued: interesting human interaction or battle scenes.",1397433600,2,2235,4.952

5635612,3,B00BK82YZU,"This show looked promising.  I had never heard of this battle, or even Westerplatte prior to seeing the trailer.  So I jumped at the opportunity to see the show.  After seeing the first moments of the presentation, I realized that this was the story of the very important port town on the Baltic sea at the tip of the Danzig Corridor which had been contentious for years.  So I knew immediately that the Nazis were focused upon acquiring this strategic possession as soon as possible in the late thirties.  The stage for this theatre of conflict had been carefully prepared early in Hitler's script.

Fortunately, the insight of Poland's plight during this century is common knowledge.  We all are aware of the Non-aggression pact, (Ribbentrop-Molotov agreement) signed in August of '39, and how it essentially created a demarcation line through the middle of Poland prior to the German invasion on September 01. Then that was followed by a Soviet grab of the eastern half of the country a few weeks later.  We know that Stalin had been somewhat worried about the overall intent of the Reich's intentions toward his domain for a number of years prior to the signing.  Stalin had directed his foreign minister to relay guarantees to the German's leadership of soviet support in the event that Deutschland was ever to be threatened.  Stalin was reassured by acquiring this new buffer zone that when added to his later conquest of the Finnish lands; increased his ""comfort level"" of territory between the obviously imperial designs by the Nazi leadership.  We also know that Poland's unenviable geographical position of being between Germany and the Soviet Union, was the root of much suffering during the first half of the twentieth century.

We knew that Stalin was nothing more than a paranoid thug who probably couldn't even spell the word ""Communism.""  Any true socialistic movements died with Lenin in 1924, and with the determined eradication of the remaining members of the Central Committee in the years that followed Lenin's demise, and the ice pick assassination of Leon Trotsky in Mexico City during this pivotal year of 1939.

Also, Goebbels, Himmler, Hitler, and the rest of the German sadists were never in any doubt as to the eventual disposition of the soviet domain of the Ukraine, Belarus, the Caucasus, and the three Baltic states. These areas were always intended as ""Living Space"" for the Germanic peoples.  Poland's destiny was never in any doubt as being earmarked in this same manner by Hitler.  This is the Basic information that allows the viewer to understand the setting of this movie.

These two maniacal leaders were just ruthless, killers seeking more power.  The conflicting dogmas of Fascism, and Communism probably never seriously crossed the minds of Stalin & Hitler.  They simply pursued the quickest path possible in all territorial acquisitional endeavors.

I saw the show as essentially being a portrait of Polish Nationalism and the integrity of it's military force, and people.  The Polish are, and were a great people with unique perspective's.  They were determined to fight the Germans in 1939! This unheralded conflict for control of this critical harbor town as descripted in this presentation is a good indication of how this moment in time probably occurred.

But, as a movie being watched now; ""The Battle of Westerplatte"" will flat put you to sleep after about thirty minutes!  I held on thinking it would get better, and even straightened up in my chair when the German battleships started firing upon the fortress. But, the thing was very predictable with few surprises other than the obvious determination of the Polish soldiers to not surrender regardless of the hope of success.

The movie is was obviously made using a foreign language, but has an English language option.  But little effort is made to sync the English words to the German speakers.  Also, the available English subtitles do not match the actual audible English words that you hear.  It's a bit like watching those Japanese Godzilla movies that were made in the late sixties - the actor's mouth barely moves, yet entire sentences are heard!

If one views war as periods of boredom punctuated by brief periods of fighting, then this film nails it.  While the film does focus on the emotional aspect of war and the often conflicting roles of duty,responsibility, and reality in such situations, there is too much time spent on silent brooding faces.
  That said, it is still worth watching from the historic aspect.  There are two versions on the DVD, one English and the original one.  Whichever option you decide upon, I'd recommend the Polish audio with English subtitles and NOT the dubbed (English) option.",1385424000,3,713,4.949579831932773

Sucharski was a Virtuti Militari recipient for actions in the Bolshevik War. He is made to appear as a fool and poltroon. He was neither.
This movie has little action, whereas in reality the defenders were under constant German attack.
The director seems to think he is directing ""Hamlet."" Bloody stupid or bloody slander I cannot figure out which.
It would be worse than a waste of money to buy this film.
An accurate account of the Battle of Westerplatte is given by the late W.S. Kuniczak in his book ""The Thousand Hour Day,""
a best seller for months. It should have been made into a film, but it never was. Where Pawel Chochlew got his
ideas is all unknown to me. But it is effectively a slander of some of the bravest soldiers to fight in WWII. 186 defenders,
the same number as the Texicans at the Alamo. And they were fired at point blank by a battleship, a brigade of Danzig SS,
armored trains carrying tons of petrol for burning out the fort, etc. The bravest of the brave. And the makers of this film have
slandered them all.",1382054400,125,1135,4.435406698564593

5635622,5,B00BK82YZU,"Poland is a country of nearly 40 million smack in the dead centre of Europe.  Millions more around the world claim full or part Polish decent.  Yet very little is known of its history.  Surprisingly few even know that the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 marked the beginning of WW11.

The German blitzkrieg invasion gave no quarter.  The Soviets also joined their then German allies by invading the hapless country from the East.  The French and the British only declared war on Germany but did nothing to aid the Poles, who fought for over a month before capitulating, but never formally surrendering.  Poland kept up the fight by having in place the biggest resistance army in occupied Europe.  Many of its men and women formed the free Polish forces that fought alongside the British in almost all theatres of the European war.  From 1943 they also formed the Free Polish 1st and 2nd Polish armies that fought alongside the Soviets, and participated in the attack on Berlin in 1945.

The movie Westerplatte is dubbed and, therefore, should be more accessible to a broader English speaking audience. Those expecting a huge big budget action film along the lines of the epic Battle for Warsaw 1920, as directed by the Polish director Jerzy Hoffman, would be disappointed as the action is interspersed with a storyline about the men involved in this struggle.  But then again not all war films need to be 90% very graphic battle scenes like the well made Russian WW11 film ""Fortress"", although this particular film does have its fair share of action sequences.

The film presents as a well told story of Polish troops, based on a Baltic Sea peninsular near the Free City of Gdansk, holding out much longer than the required six hours against repeated German infantry attacks, heavy artillery and the bombardment by the German Navy's Holstein and the superior German Air Force.  Instead of six hours they held out for days and the German infantry losses were high.  The film depicts the battle scenes and the psychological conflicts endured by the men, particularly their commanding officer portrayed by Zebrowski.  There is also a struggle between him and his second in charge, who wanted to fight to the death.

It is, overall, a well made movie depicting a WW11 story that deserves to be told, and shown to an audience interested in the lesser known stories of WWII.  I highly recommend it as a story of soldiers cut off from the rest of the world and fighting against an enemy with the upper hand in being able to attack from land, sea and air.

PS

I understand that an earlier Polish film about the Battle for Westerplatte was made decades ago - 1959, I believe, but is as yet not available on DVD to my knowledge.  I would be interested if anyone could tell me about its availability online.",1381536000,16,2809,4.7407407407407405

5635626,2,B00BK82YZU,"I expected a movie about the defense of Westerplatte, but what I watched was an interpretation of morality. Does anyone really know what the soldiers who were defending Westerplatte were thinking as the battle progressed? I am not sure that the historic value of the battle is adequately addressed by this movie. There is always the intent of the director to consider when critiquing a movie, so if the intent of the director was to have a morality play then his goal was achieved. If his intent was a historic account of the value of the battle then I believe the movie is a failure.....From a technical perspective; the overvoicing was BAD, and the language translation was not good.....Furthermore, why does a war movie need an interpretation of morality? War is in its self immoral. How can a soldier fighting to survive be expected to consider the moral implications of his dutiful actions? There is certainly a line that a soldier should never cross, such as was crossed by the Germans when they pillaged and plundered, but true soldiers are moral beings whom are caught in the midst of war. Their only choices are to fight, die, or surrender. The battle of Westerplatte could have been a little more about the fight to survive and how that fight serves to defend a country. One thing this movie does do very well is demonstrate how surrendering before all arms are expended is as immoral an act as is war.",1378598400,5,1412,4.69758064516129
5635627,2,B00BK82YZU,"I'm a huge WWII film buff and wanted to like this film but it totally missed the mark with me. The story of the start of WWII and the Poles being attacked by Germany certainly is compelling as a staring point, but I had to fast forward theu sections of this film I disliked most of it so much. First; the battle scenes are rather poor. Their is a lot of ""Poles fire 3 rounds--5 Germans fall down"" kind of action which is not compelling. Then the main story line of two contrasting leaders of the Polish defense constantly at odds with each other could have been great but...the one leader is totally brave & gung ho, and the other has severe shell shock or some other condition and is disappearing from leading his men just when they need him most over & over. This aspect of the film gets repeated many times and becomes downright annoying after awhile and ruins any good points of the film in my view. Other 'new' movies on WWII are out now like ""Storming Juno"" which is a terrific little movie, but this film just isn't worth your time.",1378339200,7,1039,4.333333333333333
