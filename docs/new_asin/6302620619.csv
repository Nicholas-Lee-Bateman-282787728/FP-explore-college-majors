A Mexican policeman is on Johnnys trail. Miss Williams, the ranch owner, arrives in town with her men. Johnny fights the man who shot his hat. Miss Williams plans to build a dam on the canyon to create a water supply; she has government permission. John is offered a job. Mendez is there too. Ranchers are losing beef but don't have proof, says Mr. Small. John overhears talk about bringing something across the border. There is a dance in town that night.

Can they stop that dam from being built? Manuel Mendez has a plan. But Joan loves another and doesnt believe Mendez. John and Oscar follow two riders to Lonesome Canyon. Cattle are run across the border, a profitable business. Joan is missing, who might have done it? John doesnt know, but they don't believe him. John rides away and is followed by the crowd. Oscar said Mendez has Joan, they went across the border. John follows, he is caught by Mendez men and taken to Mendez. John finds Mendez with Joan, there is a fight. John tries to take Joan away, there is more fighting and throwing dishes in the cantina. John and Joan race away, then followed by Mendez gang. Shots are fired at them. Mendez is really Rusty Walker, a wanted outlaw. Dick Martin was stabbed, not shot by John. Oscar will be a witness to this. John will take a job with the Sundown Ranch. A happy ending seems likely.

This is a good story with some surprises at the end where identities are revealed. It seems that scenes were deleted to cut the running time to under an hour. Does the countryside look familiar from other movies made in this era?",1506729600,,1974,4.402739726027397
