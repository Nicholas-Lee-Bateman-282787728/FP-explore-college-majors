8011259,5,B0001EJKBK,"This is an excellent video, especially for those who have only heard the prosecution's side of the story. O.J. does a good job of debunking the prosecution's main claims regarding such issues as the blood evidence, the Rockingham glove, his alleged stalking of Nicole, his alibi, his Ford Bronco, what Allan Park really said he saw, and the eye/earwitnesses. If you want to verify that O.J.'s points are valid, I recommend reading Joseph Bosco's book ""A Problem of Evidence,"" Donald Freed and Raymond Briggs' book ""Killing Time,"" and Gerald Uelman's book ""Lessons from the Trial: The People v. O.J. Simpson.""

As for the Bruno Magli shoes, O.J. saw pictures of a pair of those shoes during the trial. So it's not surprising that he knew something about their features. By the way, subsequent research found that Bruno Magli soles are not nearly as rare as the prosecution claimed they are. Bruno Magli did not make their shoe soles; they bought them from a company named Silga Gomma. Long story short, 21 other shoe companies bought the same soles that Bruno Magli used.

I'll just a mention a few points in O.J.'s defense:

* The blood that was collected from under Nicole's fingernails did *not* match O.J.'s blood, nor did it match Nicole's blood or Ron Goldman's blood.

* The autopsy evidence made it very clear that Ron Goldman struck his attacker(s) very hard several times. Yet, when O.J. underwent a full-body examination before he was arrested, he had no bruises on his body.

* O.J. had no cuts on the night of the murders that could have left blood in two places that were miles apart. When the LAPD examined O.J.'s hands on 6/13/94, the day after the murders, they only found two cuts on his left hand: a half-inch cut on his left middle finger and a quarter-inch cut on his left index finger. The evidence is overwhelming that those cuts occurred in O.J.'s Chicago hotel room when he smashed a glass after being notified of Nicole's death. No one who saw O.J. at the LA airport, on the flight to Chicago, or at the Chicago airport saw any cuts on his hands. One of those witnesses was looking specifically at O.J. hands because he wanted to see if he was wearing a championship ring.  Chicago authorities found broken glass and blood in O.J.'s Chicago hotel room. So what cuts on O.J.'s body dripped blood on Nicole's driveway, on Nicole's back gate, in the Bronco, on one of O.J.'s socks, on O.J.'s driveway, and on the floor near the entrance to his house?

* The sock blood and the back-gate blood were clearly planted. Several experts saw/examined the socks weeks before the LAPD claimed to find blood on one of them, and not one of those experts saw blood on them. What's more, the first crime report on the socks made no mention of blood being found on them. Only several weeks later did the LAPD claim to find blood on one of the socks.

Much the same is true of the back-gate blood. Only three weeks after the murders did the LAPD claim to find blood on the back gate. Amazingly, the back-gate blood was in better condition and contained far more DNA than the blood that was collected from around the bodies the day after the murders. How could this be when that blood would have sat exposed to the elements in June-July weather, on metal, in Southern California? Clearly, it was dropped from a blood vial onto the gate and then collected; it could not have been there on the night of the murders.

Both the sock blood and the back-gate blood contained EDTA, which is used in blood vials, proving that that blood did not come directly from a human body but from a blood vial. The prosecution's claim that EDTA is found in similar amounts in human blood was debunked by Dr. Frederic Rieders at the trial. The prosecution also floated the idea that the EDTA in the sock blood came from laundry soap, but Dr. Rieders noted that there was no EDTA on the sock, only in the sock blood.

* As for the five drops of O.J.'s blood that the LAPD claimed they found on Nicole's driveway, there is good reason to believe that the blood that was tested was not the same blood that was collected from the driveway. LAPD criminalist Andrea Mazzola initialed each of the bindles for the blood swatches she collected from the driveway, which was standard chain-of-evidence procedure, but the swatches that were presented by the LAPD were in bindles that did not have Mazzola's initials on them. which obviously suggests that the swatches therein were not the same swatches that Mazzola collected from the crime scene.

Some other odd things about the five supposed O.J. blood drops on Nicole's driveway: They did not follow the trail of the bloody footprints as they should have; they had no ""direction of travel""; they appeared to have been dropped from about 2 feet above the ground; and they were very oddly mixed in quality. Few books on the O.J. case ever mention that DNA experts have noted that the DNA of O.J.'s two youngest children, who lived at Nicole's house, would have been virtually identical to O.J.'s DNA--and virtually impossible to distinguish from it. It is entirely reasonable to assume that those two kids played on the townhouse's pavement and occasionally scraped a knee or elbow or otherwise cut themselves and left blood on the pavement.

* O.J. offered to take a polygraph if the prosecution would agree in advance to allow the jury to see the results. The prosecution refused the offer.",1503273600,,5418,4.667714884696017
8011260,4,B0001EJKBK,"Mr. Simpson was very convincing in this interview, but I feel that he may have slipped up at one point when talking about the absence of any blood being found on the carpet on the stairs inside his home. He said, ""the Bruno Magli shoes HAD ridges on the bottom, so any blood trapped in those ridges would have transferred to the carpet, but no blood was found"".  This sounds like someone who has owned or worn these shoes. If not, one would say, ""Bruno Magli shoes HAVE ridges on the bottom..."".  He has maintained that he has never owned or worn Bruno Magli shoes. But in this interview, he basically says that the Bruno Magli shoes HAD ridges on the bottom, so IF he had committed this crime, blood would have surely been trapped in those ridges and would have transferred to the carpeting when he entered his home. No blood was found, therefore this is partial proof he is not guilty. I replayed this part a couple times...the way he says it sounds like someone who was wearing those shoes that night. Judge for yourself.",1486080000,,1024,4.470588235294118
8011261,5,B0001EJKBK,I bought this Vhs  and watched it all. This man was found not guilty by a jury of 12 of his peers. Still the public although he was cleared of a double murder charge want this man guilty today. No one that i have ever heard of  has been treated like O.J. For the last 14 years or more when a jury finds a person Innocent are they not guilty by the law. This video made me see O.J. In a different light.,1208304000,6,402,3.8313253012048194
8011262,1,B0001EJKBK,"Interesting only if you know the fact of the case. OJ distorts the truth of the evidence at every turn, and even denies things and twists them although they were established as facts at the trial. It shows how manipulating he truly can be. It is a pathetic attempt to confuse viewers from what came out in the trial, and if you don't know about alot of the case you'd swear he was telling the truth.
The only part of the video that was interesting is after the interview, OJ will guide you through Rockingham, to various areas where evidence was found, so you will see the actual places in the house, although OJ's commintary is outragous and unbelieveable.
  I think it shows what a liar he is, but is interesting to listen to him try to convice us of his lies.",1193529600,5,762,4.359154929577465
