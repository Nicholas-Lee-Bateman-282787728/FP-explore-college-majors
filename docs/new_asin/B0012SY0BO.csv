8535808,3,B0012SY0BO,"A collection of short comedy films from the silent era.  The gem of the set is the first film, an two-reel version of the very funny Raymond Griffith film ""Hand's Up"" (1926).  The full film is available on DVD from Grapevine.  The other films in the set range from amusing to dire.  If you're interested in silent comedy, it'd be better to start with Buster Keaton, Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy, Charley Chase.

As other reviewers have noted, the music is generic and typically doesn't match the action on screen.  That said, the tunes don't distract too much.",1515715200,,557,4.690721649484536
