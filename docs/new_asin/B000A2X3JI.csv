2354665,1,B000A2X3JI,"I was very disappointed in this installment.  I liked the first 2 versions but found this dull and boring.  Endless scenes of walking down corridors waiting for something to happen...  Also, there was no character development so you have nothing invested in any of the roles or actors.",1174262400,,285,4.895833333333333
2354666,1,B000A2X3JI,This was probably the worst excuse for a scary movie I have ever seen.  And who was smoking in all the halls???  It is totally predictable and the shower scene is way too long and the water must have been very cold. The movie must have been shot in one weekend in about 4 rooms of a Canadian high school.  You keep seeing the gym and the same hallway full of lockers no matter where they ran.  Looked like a cartoon looping the background.  Overall I would not recommend this movie other than for a good laugh.,1167782400,2,510,4.216494845360825
2354667,3,B000A2X3JI,"I've just seen all three of the Brotherhood movies. I'm not really into horror movies, but I think they were actually kinda entertaining. ""Brotherhood 3 - Young Demons"" is the scariest of them all, and less homo erotic than the first two ones. To be honest, the movies aren't high quality, but it contains young sexy high school/college kids. So what else can you ask for? If the three Brotherhood movies were part of a TV series, it probably wouldn't be so bad, and something I might have been watching from time to time (the movies aren't that long either, only about 80 minutes each), but as three independent movies: I've seen better. Some good looking people starring in it, but nobody I've seen or heard of before.",1121731200,2,720,4.6328125
2354668,2,B000A2X3JI,"A TOTAL  waste of time.

Unless you have absolutely nothing else to do, this film is a collossal waste of time. No scares, not even remotely scarey  moments.

If you have seen the BROTHERHOOD  II, then this is where this trashy series gets worse.

Nice settings, not a scarey film. But it has a good  idea at its core.

However this film is more vacuous than anything Troma could  dream up.",1102464000,2,390,4.380281690140845
2354669,1,B000A2X3JI,"This third entry in the homoerotic DeCoteau series is awful for the following reasons:
*It has no plot
*DeCoteau, known for his relentless use of slomo to pad his films with shots of his studly heroes parading around is used so much in this film, it's like the whole movie is in slowmo
*It's snowing and there's thunder and lightning, in the school too
*80% of the movie is devoted to watching the hooded demon casually pursuing the kids in slomo
*The kid who plays Roger has Sardonicus syndrome, always grinning, completely awful acting
*Oh yes, completely awful acting and directing
*Studly guy takes a shower in his underwear
*It's just an awful awful movie!",1076284800,4,661,4.756521739130434
2354670,4,B000A2X3JI,"I have seen all three Brotherhood movies, and I own a copy of each.  I love DeCoteau's films and understand that they are ment to be B movies from the start, thats part of the fun afterall.  Actor Kristopher Turner (who played Lex) was outstanding, and deserves nothing but credit for his contribution to the movie; hopefully he will be back in some of Director DeCoteau's films.
Unfortunately, this movie did have some drawbacks, most notably the long drawn out chase seens through the high school, and the lightening in the background got old after awhile too.  Most of the actors did a so-so job in their roles, the worst job coming from Ramses (Lex's brother.) Despite some really bad flaws in this third take of the Brotherhood series, I still liked it.",1055462400,,758,4.684210526315789
2354671,1,B000A2X3JI,"Pass this one by, it's not even worth renting...I regret to report that there is only one homoerotic scene, in which a gym bunny showers in his briefs, the camera gazing longingly at his muscles. Everyone else, male and female, keeps his/her clothes on. Cut-rate special effects, non-threatening villain, fair to poor acting, etc.",1031529600,8,330,5.12962962962963
2354672,2,B000A2X3JI,"""Voodoo Academy"", ""The Frightening"" and first two ""Brotherhood"" films took occult horror themes and used casts including several scantily clad young men to help David DeCoteau build a niche oriented toward women and gay male audiences.
""The Brotherhood III: Young Demons"" has less plot, sympathetic characters, and skin display than its predecessors.
The story line is something like this.
Lex (played engagingly by Kristopher Turner) leads an unauthorized role-playing game at school after it closes Friday nights. The participants dress up in costumes with weapons to seek a prize planted beforehand. The one finding the prize is the winner. Participants may pretend-kill each other. Lex hides away throughout with a microphone and broadcasts taunts and clues to the players. The game is meant to be fun.
This Friday's game is different. On Thursday night, two of Lex's henchmen plant the prize (a Necklace of Anubis) and various scary props and booby traps. A masked, robed, Darth Vader-like figure stalks the two oblivious henchmen. At school on Friday, Lex's archaeologist brother, Ramsey (played by Paul Andrich), gives Lex a find, a codex on magic, written by the Magi using excellently printed Egyptian hieroglyphics. Fascinated, Lex later leafs through the book, which subjects him to undefined forces, giving him the knowledge that his two henchmen will not be participants in tonight's game. Offsetting this, one of the female players has invited a football jock date to play. Lex will manage four men and two women in tonight's game. This time, it will be ""for keeps"".
The bulk of the movie seems taken up with players walking slowly through school corridors filled with fog. Stalking the players are the masked figure and the figure's assistants. (Since the filming was in a snowy Manitoba, I'm not sure where the audience thinks the fog comes from.) No matter how scared or motivated the characters are, few move faster than a brisk walk. There are lots of slo-mo, loud heart beat sounds (Was this the end of ""The Tell-Tale Heart""?), and ernest prowling. No one seemed very directed to find the prize or even to know much about what the prize was. Sound effects substitute for suspense. Plotting is thin.
For this audience, the camera does linger on one showering male participant and does glance at one shirtless henchman. The other characters all remain demure. This is a smaller offering than for ""Voodoo Academy"", ""The Frightening"", and the first two ""Brotherhood"" movies.
The resolution is quick and leaves some holes. The mask comes off, and there is some reference to the magic of the era of Pharaoh Ramses II. One wonders for whom the henchmen really work.
The Full Screen presentation is appropriate for ogling and not needed for any material landscapes or widescreen shots.
The soundtrack is suspense-supportive, not tuneful. There are lots of lightning storms, giving strobe effects. The compositions and camera work are usually all right.  The makeup and blood effects are much more realistic than in ""The Frightening"".
The DVD has the movie's trailer and offers Spanish subtitles. There is no commentary track (a shame, since David DeCoteau makes good ones), outtakes, deleted scenes, nor a making-of.
Although the acting is mediocre overall, Kristopher Turner has the looks, voice, and talent to deserve another opportunity in a better film.
I'm hoping Brotherhood IV has a better plot, more sympathetic characters, and more eye-candy. The series concept has promise and needs better execution, despite the low budget.",1031184000,6,3546,5.177700348432055

8073506,1,B000A2X3JI,"THUMPING HEARTBEAT PLAYS THROUGH MOST OF MOVIE, OVER THE DIALOG ON SOME PARTS. AVOID THIS EVEN IF IT WAS FREE

Okay the first 2 are great and I was really looking forward to watching this one. However this one has the most annoying sound track in the world wanted to scream, a freakin agravating heartbeat plays throughout most of the movie and on some parts with dialog,and louder than the dialog which means having to turn it up to hear it, it adds nothing to the story. Whoever added that needs to be locked up to protect innocent unsuspecting human race muwhahaha, I liked the actors though. I rarely give bad reviews don't like doing it but and I never thought I'd say this I did enjoy doing it on this

Reccomendations for really great scary movies

Occult teenage horror movies these are really good with some killer heavy metal music. 1 ( Trick Or Treat, featuring Trick Or Treat and other songs performed by Fastway. I highly reccomend the soundtrack to this movie I bought it after seeing the film freakin awesome band. Gene Simmons of Kiss plays the radio station DJ, Rock on )..2 ( Black Roses, featuring the song and video Me Against The World, by Lizzy Borden ) are awesome filled with heavy metal music movies ) 3 ( Killer Party, featuring April Your No Fool song and video, performed by White Sister...4 ( The Craft ) starring Feruza Balk...5 ( The Lost Boys ) Corey Feldman, and Corey Haim are in these, love them, this has some nice 80's music )...Drama suspense murder ( The Skulls ) movies

Suspense, drama, crime, murder movies starring kids for people who haven't tried these yet 1 ( Childs Play ) all of them...2 ( The Good Son ) starring Mcauly Culkin who is really diabolical in this one...3 ( Dadys Girl ) the girl looks so angelic and is creepy and scary as hell",1375315200,,1789,4.478527607361963

8073512,1,B000A2X3JI,"The Brotherhood movies are usually interesting; quirky but unique and intriguing.  Brotherhood I, II and IV can each stand on their own merits and are destined to become cult classics but not so with Brotherhood III.  If III had not carried ""The Brotherhood"" in its title, there would be no link to the others.  The movie simply fails to live up to its predecessors or successors.  The characters are poorly defined as well as the plot.  The villain looks like a Darth Vader rip-off and his objective is unclear.  Smoke appears randomly in the movie and the lighting is dark to give the film a more menacing look.  Instead, it looks like laughable and amateurish.

The plot: a group of students stage a ritual game while a Darth Vader-ish killer stalks the halls of the school.  As the students are killed one-by-one, the remaining few assume the murders are simply part of the game until they too become victims.  Personally, I would save my money and skip this film.  See The Brotherhood I, II or IV instead.  These three are EXCELLENT!",1194739200,,1038,4.6740331491712706
