5064286,5,B0079ILHRG,"The Murdoch Mysteries take today's crime scene investigation shows and push them back to the 1890s. But if you think the investigative methods used then were all very primitive, think again. Detective William Murdoch and his cohorts on the Toronto Constabulary (police force) employ ""finger marks"" (fingerprinting), dye on paper money to catch a bank robber, phone tapping, autopsies and other techniques to catch killers. Murdoch isn't afraid to push the envelope, even building contraptions to aid in his detecting work. Working alongside him is coroner Dr. Julia Ogden, Murdoch's former lover who now is seemingly out of reach. You'll see plenty of yearning looks from Murdoch when he works with Dr. Ogden, and one great fantasy scene when he actually does something about it.

Murdoch is a thoroughly decent fellow who crosses himself when he sees a body and always does his best to be polite. This is my first viewing of this series -- I haven't seen the first three seasons -- so at first I found him a bit too wooden, even for Victorian times. Gradually, though, I began to see the storm of emotion under that stalwart (and very handsome) exterior, and I was hooked.

The 13 episodes in this set run the gamut, from attacks by what appears to be a vampire to a visit with an autistic woman -- they called them ""idiot savants"" in those days -- whose construction of an exact scale replica of her street uncovers a murder that she didn't have the verbal skills to tell anyone about. There's a primitive gun silencer in one episode and a sort of witness protection plan in another.

There's a great cliffhanger at the end of the season that leaves several loose ends waving in the breeze. It's all great fun, and I look forward to seeing Season 5 when it comes out on DVD.",1338163200,19,1776,4.685897435897436
5064287,5,B0079ILHRG,"Season 4 cover the cases of Station 4 with Detective Murdoch.  In this season there is an emotional crisis for Murdoch as well in regards to his love life.  This is a wonderful series that combines humor, history and intriguing crimes.  Several characters reappear from time to time making the world feel familiar and complete.",1337817600,,327,4.909090909090909
5064288,5,B0079ILHRG,"UPDATE: This set is also becoming available in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Murdoch-Mysteries-Collection-Seasons-1-4-Blu-ray/dp/B00ANGICW4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Murdoch Mysteries Collection: Seasons 1-4 [Blu-ray</a>] & regular DVD set making it a great buy if you need all 4 seasons. And season 5 is now available for ordering. Season 6 is airing, and will be DVD-available later.

Award gathering Toronto detective from late 1890's who manages to use inventive forensic modes now common in today's crime solving venue. Historic aspects of the show are as good as period sets and costuming. Historical personalities occasionally cross paths with Murdoch (Yannick Bisson). Novel adaptations of Maureen Jennings' writing, this has become a show demanded for continuation. Always intriguing, always satisfying to the eyes and mind. An intellectual and entertaining hot fudge sundae, if they had those in 1897. Sprinkled overtop is bits of Victorian romance too.
Crabtree (Jonny Harris) returns as does Brackenreid (Thomas Craig), beautiful romantic Dr. Ogden (Helene Joy), & Higgins (Lachlan Murdoch).

5064290,5,B0079ILHRG,"Haven't purchased season 4, it is too expensive and I wonder why.
I have purchased through Amazon all the seasons of  Midsummer Murders, Inspector Lewis, Poirot--and many more, at very affortable cost, recently I purchased the NCIS series 1 through 8, at the pricing under $200.00, which I thought was a great deal.
Therefore, I do not understand why the pricing for Murdoch Mysteries Season 4 is so expensive and beyond reach for many.
Not sure if my ""venting"" will be read--but I just wanted to share that I wished I was not 'Hooked"" on the Murdoch Mysteries series--since I cannot continue to view the upcoming seasons due to the cost.
Thank you",1332460800,71,648,4.734513274336283

5064310,1,B0079ILHRG,"This should be a good series, especially if you like classical mysteries.
BUT,
 there is no mystery, because the PC powers force the writers to conform.
Thus, no matter what the story, evidence, clues, the same person is ALWAYS guilty:
The Rich One.
You will be introduced to various characters early in the episode, as is the way with classical detective stories.
As soon as there is a Rich character, you will know, that is the guilty one.
AND,
The Rich character will also be a hypocrite.

It is a real shame.
And it makes you wonder, how does it actually happen ?
Somewhere along the production line, maybe from the producer or the studio, the order comes down:
The Rich are guilty, no matter what else.

So there is almost no point watching the show.",1483920000,,755,4.536764705882353

I feel an attachment with the characters, and love to see the introduction of celebrities such as Jack London, Arthur Conan Doyle, Henry Ford, Buffalo Bill Cody, Alexander Graham Bell and others. I love the humor, and the way the characters are developing. I don't always agree with the opinions of the characters with certain issues, but it's interesting to watch how those issues affect the way Murdoch thinks. I also love the introduction of new inventions, what they are named, and Crabtree's ""vision"" of how they could be used in the future. Great show.

Recurring characters include Dr. Francis, the prima Donna doctor who replaces Julia,  and a nosy young journalist named Paddy Flynn. The season is notable for the wide variety of crime settings and backgrounds. Stories include Confederate gold, vampires, Sicilian organized crime, and an Alice in Wonderland party. Serious issues examined include revenge on criminals, medical experimentation, autism, and the religious life. Guest characters include Julia's sister and William's sister and Anna Fulford. If there is any weakness, it is that Julia's boyfriend Darcy is poorly developed. However, this is redeemed by fine acting by Victor Garner in the first episode and the excellent Dial M for Murder which had two big surprising twists.",1471737600,,926,5.386206896551724

5064392,3,B0079ILHRG,"I love this series although the minimal of emotion expressed by the lead actor is a little frustrating. Other version of Detective Murtaugh is more of a tortured soul, not a fellow severely challenged with expression of any emotion. It is difficult to distinguish this from just bad acting since any emotion he expresses seems prescribed and scripted. Other than that frustration, the show is delightful, much to the presence of other endearing characters such as Constable Crabtree, Dr Ogden and their red headed station boss who offers quirky insults of every character during each episode.

The hero is not perfect; he's not winning the fair maiden and the boss is up and down but generally sort of on his side.  The supporting cast all are doing a fine job.  The period setting is excellent.  The use of historic characters like Nicola Tesla, Harry Houdini and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is exceptionally interesting.  Toss in the crime fighting technology like finger marks and the use of cameras.  You won't be able to guess how each episode will play out.  So in sum, a very well done program.

5064799,5,B0079ILHRG,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first three seasons of Murdoch Mysteries but only had an opportunity to see a couple from Season 4 before it was pulled from the list of ""Prime Instant Video"" offered free for viewing. If I choose to purchase any DVDs Murdoch Mysteries would definitely be high on my list of purchases - the episodes are engaging and do not include the sex/language/adult situations that are found in most of today's offerings on TV.",1410480000,,441,4.740259740259741
5064800,5,B0079ILHRG,We love Murdoch Mysteries and can't wait to see each episode.  Yannick Bisson does an excellent job as Inspector Murdoch of the Toronto Constabulary. His keen mind is fascinating looking back from our time into his as he uses what is known in his time along with his innate curiosity to solve mysteries through scientific means. The supporting characters are great too.,1410480000,,369,4.951612903225806

5064825,5,B0079ILHRG,Love this show!,1410307200,,15,4.333333333333333
5064826,5,B0079ILHRG,"The series is a period piece (Victorian Toronto) about a brilliant detective with the Toronto constabulary. What's fascinating about the show is how it deals with historical events such as the introduction of electricity, the role of women, the anarchist movement, etc. Murdoch is the detective, and he has a romantic interest in the female pathologist/coroner who is his intellectual equal. However, the romantic theme running through the series is rather tiring, because for two smart people, Murdoch and the doctor just keep misreading each other. More frivolously, Murdoch has the longest eyelashes ever. I am quite envious of them. He is quite a handsome man (Yannick Bisson).

My gripe is with Amazon. I was watching the series as a prime offering on Amazon. From one day to another, the series went from prime to non-prime. When I called Amazon support, I was told that the series had expired and that nothing could be done. Not to be deterred, I found another streaming provider, Acorn TV, which I stream through my Roku.

My determination to find another provider shows you how much I like this show. But this experience with Amazon was like being betrayed by a good and trustworthy friend.",1409961600,2,1199,4.960199004975125
5064827,5,B0079ILHRG,I believe the original Canadian network that airs this show has season's 5 and up available to stream for free. Too bad I didn't get to finish season 4. It's why I signed up for Amazon Prime since netflix only has the first 3 seasons.,1409961600,3,234,4.222222222222222
5064828,5,B0079ILHRG,"Great series but why is it no longer listed as part of Amazon Prime?

5064830,5,B0079ILHRG,"Fantastic series. After watching all the shows on netflix, we discovered two more seasons on Amazon prime.

5064843,4,B0079ILHRG,"Season 4 of this historical mystery series set in late 1800s Canada picks up where the previous season left off. The show combines cleverly plotted mysteries with forensic methods based on the science of the time, history and social issues.  This season's episodes maintain the high production values and good performances that fans of series have come to expect. I was pleased that the science in most of the season's episodes had less of a steam punk vibe than in Season 3.  Also welcome was the show's inclination not to take itself too seriously with humor just as prevalent as in earlier seasons.  There is seriousness aplenty, though, in the interrelationships of the main characters, including some momentous developments as the season draws to a close. We streamed this series in HD from Amazon Prime on an Ethernet-connected Xbox 360 and experienced high quality video and audio. Established Murdoch fans will enjoy Season 4.  Newcomers to the series are encouraged to begin with Season 1 in order not to miss the evolution of the continuing characters.",1409616000,,1062,5.017045454545454

5064848,4,B0079ILHRG,"Interesting historical mystery series. You may be off put by the wooden acting, but it is probably more a matter of Victorian mannerisms, than of bad acting.

5064982,5,B0079ILHRG,"LOVABLE ANACHRONISMS! I won't go into great detail about seeing 21st-Century CSI and Forensic crimesolving techniques depicted as all having actually been invented by the Toronto Constabulary in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Watching these episode after episode with my housemates/best friends, I've been repeatedly startled by the arrival of dawn and half asleep at work all day because I just can't stop watching! My Yank sister-in-law has on her Mum's side all Canadian heritage and she comments repeatedly that she ""always knew the Canadians were a century ahead of everybody anyway"" and that her late Mum would've loved this series. My half-brother (her husband) and I hail from Northern Ireland and are very fond of Canada (we dwell in the States, three cheers for Syracuse, not far from Buffalo, a location featured occasionally in the series too); so we generally agree that the odd advanced insight here & there could very well have conceivably happened in Toronto; why not, BUT this series takes it SO much too far that we have had to come to the conclusion that the series's writers knew perfectly well that they were going that far with the ""way ahead of their time"" bit AND that it's actually completely, blatantly, intentionally done that way, set as a kind of Steampunk CSI Canucks (I sincerely hope that calling Canadians ""Canucks"" is NOT a Racist sounding term, I'm still getting accustomed to some customs; if it is, I EMPHATICALLY do NOT intend it that way; I am as I have said an admiring fan of Canada!).

So, whilst that's all fine with me, what I do have to say that IS a CRITICISM of the series, however, is that a certain female forensic pathologist has the most perfect hunk of morally beautiful, gorgeously manly, wonderfully devoted male detective in love with her and wanting desperately to marry her and she is so RIDICULOUSLY, infuriatingly determined to throw his love away and trample his feelings in the dust and completely break his heart, that I am simply FURIOUS with her; I started out all admiration for her too, but after the umpteenth time she has done her best to smash his tender devoted chivalrous heart under her laced-up high heels, I have reached the conclusion that she just doesn't deserve him!

Truly! I have ZERO idea WHY the idiot woman is so determined to throw his love away: she told him she had an abortion and he got past it; she ran away to avoid saying she is now sterile and he found her and said they can adopt; he overcomes every hurdle and races to the railway station with ring-box in hand ready to go down on his knee and he just misses the train; he finds her in Buffalo and without even giving him a chance she announces she is marrying a man whom she very clearly doesn't love (which, by the bye, is horribly unfair to HIM as well as to poor devoted Murdoch!) for no clear reason other than that she is a neurotic wreck who is determined NOT to give in and marry the man she actually loves, or possibly the writers are just waaaay overdoing the drawn-out-heartbreak bit...if there was a Season 89 (with everyone elderly and the world around them finally just starting to catch up with their advanced forensic and policing techniques!), she'd still be breaking his heart; I can just picture it, he begs her to marry him before they both die of old age and she stares longingly into his eyes and says, ""I can't marry you, even though my 19th husband whom I didn't love just died...because I...just can't! I'm sorry, Murdoch; I can't!"" Yah yah, you idiot woman; WHY is it you ""just can't""??? Because your family are snobs and he is ""only"" a Detective??? It is already getting old. There is no sane reason WHY she has to behave that way and literally flee from her ""one true love"" as she herself called him at one point...it has long since passed the point of being suspensefully romantic and has gotten maudlin and supremely, hair-pullingly annoying. If she's so bloody Liberated for her era then why the blinking hell can't she just get over her weird hang-ups and marry the adoring and adorable bloke already?!!!

By the latter part of Season 4, I and my friends have agreed that it is BY FAR the absolute number one most irritating and negative thing about the series. It's got so bad that even the snobby and obnoxious Brit forensic pathologist whom the Toronto Constabulary had to scramble and hire on in a hurry to take her place when she fled without warning and left them in the lurch (I mean, really, thanks a lot, Doc, how unprofessional too; don't give them a heads up or anything; she doesn't just treat Murdoch like s***e, she treats her bosses that way too!!) said it; that really got me when EVEN HE pointed out that her behaviour in regards to Murdoch and her job there didn't make sense! It's the Worst-Kept Secret in the Office: EVERYBODY knows she's in love with Murdoch, and even some of the Bad Guys they're chasing figure out that he's crazy in love with her, and ohhhh, she just can't cope with the thought of marrying a man and being in love with him too. The visiting French detective that suggested Murdoch have her as his Mistress instead: ""You make babies with your wife, and make love to your Mistress!"" EVERYBODY, even his tough-but-tender boss, is giving him love advice, which is in itself something that would be far more likely to happen now than about 120 years ago; but it does him no good with HER weird behaviour.

I just think the series either ought to stop milking the damn broken-heart situation or resolve it already, that ONE aspect of the series has gone so far past being entertaining that it is beginning to border on actually wrecking the series, and that'd be a real pity, my friends, because the series, despite (or possibly partly because of) its lovable anachronisms, is truly great otherwise...and so, just about (almost) enough venting from me about her. We'll see what the episodes I've yet to watch show developing about this problem...as it is, I personally am not going to forgive her character for her ridiculous behaviour without there being some truly good explanation for it - hidden trauma in her past would work for me, but it'd better be a serious one and she'd better apologise to Murdoch on her knees, and I seriously doubt that'll ever happen!

As for the anachronisms, I find myself eagerly looking forward to finding out what the next one is going to be. Finding out how ludicrously advanced the Toronto Constabulary is has become one of the very most entertaining aspects of the series. ""Oh, look,"" my friends and I will say, ""the Canadians were more than a century ahead of the rest of the world in THAT, too!"" But about poor devoted Murdoch's unfortunate  love life, we'll say, ""Oh, she's at it again! Another way to break his heart while smiling sweetly and talking in that increasingly annoying gaspy little voice...Murdoch, get over her, she doesn't deserve you!"" He has had plenty of other ladies interested in him, but he only has eyes for her...

It's awful to admit it but I'm starting to think her character should get killed (maybe all that silly gasping she does every time she speaks could actually turn out to be from Consumption~Tuberculosis?), except that it would leave the TC high & dry without a really talented forensic pathologist AND it would truly destroy poor devoted Murdoch. Better he should get over her or at least try a little Tuff-Love and essentially tell her, ""I've offered you my unconditional love, and you've told me I'm your one true love BUT that you just can't be with me. I don't get it. You can't explain it. Fine. Whatever. I've had it with you. You really want me out of your life, or you're playing twisted games? Either way. You've got your wish. I'm over you!"" I know I have had enough of her antics; they are NOT entertaining AT ALL. I'm already well over her. I am also possibly nattering on for WAY too long about it. I only do that when I'm very annoyed.

So, enough said then on that.

Summary: Overall, this is a very enjoyable and intelligent series. The anachronisms are the centre of the show! Other than the forensic pathologist (her utterly illogical, increasingly maddening character), I decidedly like it.

So, I will try to pay attention to the entertaining anachronisms and try to ignore the flighty selfish idiot forensic pathologist and her silly gasping little whispery voice as she breaks Murdoch's heart for the 127th time.",1407715200,,8426,4.664199192462988

Good, well researched science.  Nice tie-ins to real history and historic people.

He always figures out who done it AND how they done it using and inventing unheard of technology for his day.  His love interest is a female coroner (really unheard of in that time period) which gives me a chance to cheer her on - you go girl!  Now most soap opera style shows have star crossed lovers who never get together but of course that scenario draws us in as we wait and hope for the time when they realize that they are meant for each other marry and live happily ever after.  I love the period backdrop, the costumes, horse and buggies and recurring characters.  A Victorian who done it soap opera that appeals to our 21st century perspective.

An early episode concerned the topic of abortion.  The episode we watched last night had a juvenile sociopath as its criminal mastermind.  The real joy in watching the show is the character development.  Although Detective Murdoch is the star, Constable Crabtree, Dr. Ogden, and Inspector Brackenreid add color and valuable help.  And, while the show is set in the past, there are plenty of shoutouts to modern day (for example, a recent episode has Murdoch developing a primitive sonar instrument to find a sunken ship).",1404604800,,687,4.870689655172414

(We live on a sailboat)  If your a boater it makes for great entertainment because you can take it out in the cool cockpit and get out of the hot cabin.

5065292,5,B0079ILHRG,Polished who done it in late 19th century Toronto. Not creepy like Grimm but good use of industrial revolution technology to solve crimes.,1403222400,,138,5.043478260869565
5065293,5,B0079ILHRG,Great program!  characters are believable.  too many relational scenes with Julia.  Stick to being a super sleuth.  I'd like to see him more like an Adrian Monk.,1403222400,,161,4.851851851851852
5065294,5,B0079ILHRG,"Great show - love the interaction of the characters - love the story lines - LOVE LOVE LOVE the incorporation of science into each story!  Adorable how George says ""In the future, I can see . . . "" and of course we know he is correct!  Watch first FIVE Seasons all in a row!",1403136000,,274,3.963636363636364
5065295,5,B0079ILHRG,All of the episodes have great plot lines and show how forensics grew to what we know today.  Excellent acting as well.,1403136000,,119,4.409090909090909
5065296,4,B0079ILHRG,Love the mysteries and languge in this series.  Murdoch and Ogden's love story provides a fun counterpoint. Officer Crabtree is cute and fun to watch.,1403049600,,150,5.0
5065297,5,B0079ILHRG,Just good mysteries with some very clever lines.  The nods to future inventions adds to the enjoyment of this series.,1403049600,,117,4.85
5065298,5,B0079ILHRG,I have never been to Toronto and would like to check it out. It is amazing how there is so much crime in such a little city at that time period.,1403049600,,144,3.6774193548387095

5065301,5,B0079ILHRG,I absolutely love this series because of the clever scripts that weave historical facts and people into their turn of the century murder mysteries.  Yannick Bisson plays the role of William Murdoch in such a handsomely reserved manner that can make any woman fall in love with him.  I adore the way Thomas Craig plays Inspector Brackenreid as if he is a Scottish thug (toughie walk and salty language).  I hope the show's actors do not tire of their characters any time soon.,1402790400,,475,4.698795180722891
5065302,5,B0079ILHRG,I love the series! I will be sorry when I've seen them all.  I hope season 6 will be available on Prime soon.,1402790400,,109,3.739130434782609

5065305,4,B0079ILHRG,The innovations by Murdoch of his version of modern technologies are what make this series so interesting. The characters really grow on you after only a few episodes. The costumes and props are first rate as well. I highly recommend this excellent series.,1402704000,,256,4.976744186046512

5065328,4,B0079ILHRG,"We have come to be cautious about each episode we watch as a family.  Most episodes are fine but some have scenes that we would have liked to have known beforehand, as we watch with our young children.

A parents guide would be very helpful!",1401926400,,241,4.333333333333333
5065329,5,B0079ILHRG,My wife and I enjoy the Murdoch Mystery series.  Good acting and interesting stories.  Murdoch uses modern science to solve mysteries.  It's a great period piece set at the turn of the century.,1401840000,,193,4.787878787878788
5065330,5,B0079ILHRG,It is enjoyable to watch a mystery show where  most of the show is blood and gore.  Some shows are easy to solve on your own and others throw a real twist in the plot.,1401840000,,167,3.742857142857143

He is handsome besides!",1401753600,,293,4.653846153846154
5065333,5,B0079ILHRG,"A combination of grand adventure, steam punk feel, and a great detective series. The clues are often there if you can catch them, but the main suspect sometimes becomes the next victim, and the motives are often much more complex than you think.
They also deal with some really deep issues, like religeous beliefs and predjudices, and hard life choices. This isn't just your average shallow murder of the week stuff. Plus you get to meet some really cool historical figures, like HG Wells, Tesla, and Henry Ford. I highly reccomens takeing a look for yourself.",1401667200,,560,4.84375

There's great personal side plots and all the cast is terrific.",1401580800,,270,4.469387755102041
5065336,5,B0079ILHRG,"I watched Season 4 with HD on Prime. I would recommend it to anyone. It is fun to watch, the ladies wear gorgeous Victorian styled costumes and the story lines are fresh and intriguing. And there is no violence as we usually find in USA made films...other than showing some ""dead"" bodies and blood and etc, but not shoot'em up gun fights or violence for violence sake. Just fun to watch.",1401494400,,387,4.464788732394366

5065338,5,B0079ILHRG,"Weaving history with mystery and adding a touch of humor makes Murdoch Mysteries a must watch. It's like the narcotics used so freely in the 19th century, very addictive.",1401494400,,170,4.896551724137931
5065339,5,B0079ILHRG,"This had been one of our favorite shows on Netflix. We were very happy to find additional seasons on  Amazon.

5065346,5,B0079ILHRG,Interesting twist by setting this in the days of old.  Modern times CSI shows have nothing on this series.  Enjoy the cast and how they play so well off each other.  Also the techniques of crime detection they introduce into the shows.  By accident I missed Series 4 & when I started Series 5 it was entirely apparent that I hadn't purchased so I haven't watched all of 5 yet.  When I finish 4 then I will watch 5.,1400976000,,414,4.189873417721519
5065347,5,B0079ILHRG,"I love mysteries.  I especially love mysteries that are set in the Victorian and Edwardian eras.  Murdoch Mysteries satisfy on many levels--as mystery, as romance, and as family fare--much less violence, blood and gore than your typical modern fare.  Everything is handled tastefully.

The stories also mix in bits of history by casting historical figures of the time into the plots--like Henry Ford, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Buffalo Bill.  The cast is terrific!  So what's not to like?  I hope this show continues for decades.",1400889600,,526,5.117647058823529

5065349,5,B0079ILHRG,"Fun mystery series set in Toronto, Canada. It's interesting to see a police detective and medical examiner using forensic science in it's early stages. Also how they relate problems and uses of technology then to problems and uses now. For example, people using telegraph wires to ""hack"" into messages and cause all sorts of mischief. Does have a bit of blood etc., with the autopsy scenes but overall a clean, fun show.",1400803200,,420,4.847222222222222

Murdoch is a well done period piece..alot of new technology was being developed at the turn of the 20th century, esp electricity.  Murdoch solves murders with his knack for science in a time when forensics was not even heard of.  His best help..a female doctor who is the medical examiner, and of course love interest just out of reach.  Good stories of suspense, with a twist...Something you can watch with anyone!",1400630400,,634,4.906542056074766

5065387,5,B0079ILHRG,My husband and I love watching this series.  It's interesting as they integrate their time inventions and speak possible future ones that we know did occur.  The romantic chemistry between William and Julia is more realistic and the side-kick George is just as much fun to watch.  We hope the great stories continue and keep us surprised!  All the actors are great and they bring to the show something different.  If one was gone it would upset the whole show!,1399852800,,460,4.7

We very much like the development of all the main characters, and each of them is allowed their moments to shine. Although Detective Murdoch and coroner Dr. Julia Ogden are the main characters, Inspector Brackenreid and Constable George Crabtree are fun to watch. Each character has become dear to us, and it will be a jolt to finish the series. (We  laugh about the Canadian-American rivalries in the series).",1399420800,,507,4.964705882352941

This is perfect for the fans of Downton Abbey AND Sherlock Holmes and there are so many episodes filled with ""cutting edge modern"" technologies way before their time (a bit of a leap of fantasy but all the better) and famous historical figures woven in (Tesla, Ford, etc).

The story employs a plot device in which Detective Murdoch uses futuristic methods to detect crimes - that will of course all come into being in the 21st century.

The characters don't evolve much at this point but that's okay because we're already comfortable with them. The mysteries are a little less spooky than those of the early seasons but still provide enjoyable diversion. My continued complaint is that the characters' social mores are too modern for the era but I imagine the intent is to make them easy for modern viewers to relate to. Murdoch's fascination with scientific advancement continues to add an interesting layer to the episodes.",1398124800,,564,4.947368421052632

Forensic science is in it infancy but not unnoticed by Murdoch because of his constant reading in the greatest and news thoughts on an array of topics. Taken in two episodes and you will be hooked with the laughter of Constable Crabtree and the rough ""get it done"" chief inspector.

This one always seems to leave you like you've learned something more and felt better somehow.

Ever since I came across it, I have had a hard time not binge watching the full series straight through.  The acting is great.  The writing is clever, with solid, twisty mysteries and sly humor.  It gets into interesting aspects of turn of the century history that the average person doesn't think about.

5065476,5,B0079ILHRG,"I am addicted to this series.  The stories are set in Toronto, CA and if you like early era detective stories and the idea that many of our current crime scene investigational procedures may have been ideas from the late 1800's - early 1900's, you will love these stories.  I have always been a No. 1 fan of Nicola Tesla's inventions and now Detective Murdoch ranks 2nd for me.  The writing is exceptional and I can't even describe the acting.  It is awesome.  The language and social interactions from that era is superb.  Wish we still had them.

I really love the guy (Yannick Bisson) who plays Murdoch.  He fits the character superbly, as do the other cast members.  Everyone is ""prim and proper"" in their actions.  I am looking forward to watching the seasons after this one.  They just keep getting better and better.",1397088000,,823,4.606896551724138

to life in the late 1800's",1396742400,,141,4.68
5065494,5,B0079ILHRG,"This is an incredibly well written series, with very clever plot twists and just the right amount of humor.  In solving early 20th century murders, the plots manage to foresee the issues affecting 21st century society.  They also cleverly introduce famous people of the day into the plots.  Everyone from Arthur Conan Doyle to Henry Ford to Alexander Graham Bell have shown up in the Toronto police station.  Plots have addressed clean energy vs. fossil fuels, religious minorities, gay rights, debates over abortion and birth control, individual rights vs. national security.  It sounds dry but it's not.  The characters are so good and the writing so unencumbered that one wonders whether a series such as this could even be made in the uptight U.S.  One extremist group or another would raise a boycott and fuss and the network would kill it.",1396656000,,845,4.950354609929078

5065509,5,B0079ILHRG,I love this show.  Watching Murdock invent things we have in the future is amusing.  His side kick constable is also very good.  Just wish he'd get together with the Doc already.,1396569600,,178,4.5
5065510,4,B0079ILHRG,"I find Murdoch vastly interesting for several reasons. First and foremost I enjoyed reading Maureen Jennings wonderful Murdoch mysteries books, and the tv series is even better. The time is turn of the 20th century when many new scientific discoveries were being introduced, and Murdoch is very ready to embrace them in his detecting. In  one episode he invited Tesla ,who was in New York, to Toronto for help in a case. In another, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle assists the investigation.  Unlike Sherlock Holmes,  Murdoch does have romantic interests which widens the scope of the plots.",1396483200,,582,5.041666666666667
5065511,5,B0079ILHRG,"This is a great series set in the turn of the 19&20th century in Toronto, ON. Murdoch brings in a lot of future technology not yet developed.

5065513,5,B0079ILHRG,"The time period, geographical setting,  humor and the characters perfectly portrayed is what makes this show so great . Best is the depiction of the main character, Murdock,  and how all the others relate to him. I love the captain,  his side kick constable and the love of his life. (who I am patiently waiting to see him reunited with) what I enjoy the most is there are no cliffhangers, each episode concludes that hours storyline BUT you always want to come back for more.",1396396800,,476,4.576470588235294

It is fun to watch and reminds me of BONES as you have a lot of other stories going on in each episode about the supporting characters.
Can't wait for Season 6 to be available.
I have recommended this series to friends and they have started watching also.",1396396800,,446,4.235294117647059
5065526,5,B0079ILHRG,"I love this refreshing show that has a unique perspective on this period and the geographical area of Toronto.  Season 4 is maybe a little more drama than mystery, but is also an opportunity for those who have followed Murdock and crew through the past seasons to really see how the characters evolved.  The writers do a good job inserting humorous remarks and content to help keep the  shows moving and interesting.
Also, though I have not validated historical fact, the writers also bring you through the evolution of industry, medicine, architecture, and science, for which the late 1800's seems to have been a phenomenal time period.
And yes, the mystery is still there.",1396396800,,674,4.894736842105263

5065569,5,B0079ILHRG,"I have seen all five seasons of this series and loved all of it.  Difficult to describe.  Possibly nineteenth century CSI with a modern update.  The stories are interesting, the characters become very important to you, and the actors are amazing.  This is one of those series that you know will have to come to and end but you'd really rather it go on, and on.  The combination of nineteenth century morals and behavior mixed with the twenty first century crime solving techniques is very enjoyable.  For those sensitive to ""rude"" language this is a recommended series, but keep in mind that the crimes they're solving are just as horrendous as the crimes being solved in today's society.

There are 2 more seasons (6 and 7), but they are not available on the Kindle at this time. This is a Canadian produced show so it's difficult to find in the US.  I've purchased season 6 as a DVD and hope to get it mailed to me in the next few days.  I have never done that before.  That's how good this series is.  Highly recommended to anyone who loves a good detective mystery that also has wonderful characters plus a touch of romance and humor.  By the way - in the US, this show is on the Ovation channel but it's not always on at the same time and they jump around between seasons, at times.  The only time that seems set is Saturday night at 8pm central standard time.  PS - Amazon is amazing.  I got my DVD today!  Thanks.  I look forward to watching it.",1394755200,,921,4.112359550561798

So, buy it, enjoy!  My only complaint is that a Canadian TV series ""season"" is only 13 episodes.  In the UK, (like Downton Abby) it might be 8 or 9 episodes.  In the US it is typically at least 26 episodes.

5065648,4,B0079ILHRG,"I really like Sir Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes.  That said, I look for that quality in a mystery.  Therefore, I appreciate the ingenuity of the writers to have a mystery without all the gore and horror most of the crime shows today.  They let your imagination work, instead of flashing all the images across the screen.
The characterization is well developed.  Each actor brings a personality to their role.
Constable Crabtree brings the lateral thinking into the scene.  A lot of off the wall ideas, that assists in the analysis of the crime.
Inspector Brackenreid is the quintessential head of the police at that time.
Detective Murdoch the analytical brain, it is fascinating to be swept along with him to solve the crime.  See how he uses, then unknown, techniques to assist.
This is a nice reminder that the forensic science we use today had to be invented and developed by someone.  We get to be the fly on the wall and watch perhaps how ""cutting edge"" technology was developed.
Would I recommend this?  Yes, just sit back and take a trip to a time when life was simple and you had to work hard for your rewards.",1394582400,,1119,4.616161616161616
5065649,5,B0079ILHRG,"We absolutely LOVE Murdoch Mysteries.  For a murder mystery series there is a refreshing lack of graphic violence and/or blood & guts.  I have no idea how historically accurate it is, but it is really fun to watch Murdoch try to convince everyone that 'finger marks' can help solve a crime.  It is also fun to hear Constable Crabtree make random comments about things that may be popular in the future and have the others shoot him down (even though the things he's suggesting are now part of our culture like the game Clue, or Paint by Numbers, etc)",1394582400,,550,4.5353535353535355
5065650,5,B0079ILHRG,The characters are unique and engaging. The plots are always fresh and historically believable. The dialogue is witty. The turn of the century sets are plausible.,1394582400,,162,5.269230769230769
5065651,4,B0079ILHRG,There is nothing inappropriate in it for the purpose of getting better ratings. It's a good murder mystery that introduces the forensics innovations of that time period without being offensive or raunchy. My girlfriend also thinks Murdoch is attractive.,1394496000,,253,5.512820512820513
5065652,5,B0079ILHRG,Plot includes Sherlock like deductions from Detective Murdoch as he solves the latest murder as well as twists and turns in his personal relationships.  All around great series.,1394496000,,177,5.321428571428571
5065653,5,B0079ILHRG,Great mysteries with good characters and a twist in every plot.  Interesting view of the late 1800's from a police point of view.  Enjoy!,1394409600,,137,4.666666666666667
5065654,5,B0079ILHRG,"This show is set near the end of the 19th Century in Toronto, Canada. Murdoch is an Irish-Catholic Police Detective. The mysteries are clever, and historical characters such as Buffalo Bill, Arthur Conan Doyle, H. G. Wells, Nicola Tessla and others are brought in occasionally for extra fun. Note: this review applies to all seasons of Murdoch",1394409600,,343,5.035087719298246
5065655,5,B0079ILHRG,"Love the whole series; have seen 3-1/2 seasons so far, looking forward to the rest. So much fun to see what William will ""invent"" next!",1394409600,,135,4.44
5065656,5,B0079ILHRG,"I watched Seasons 1-3 through Netflix, fell in love with the series and went in search of additional episodes/seasons.  Found Seasons 4 & 5 on Amazon that I could stream.  The stories/characters are so well written and acted that you feel as though you are looking back in time and have to remind yourself that it's a TV show.  I love the way 'new fangled' items are introduced and period personage (Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Houdini, Tesla - just to name a few) come to Toronto and become part of the story line.  Definitely worth getting hooked on the series ... but watch from the beginning, don't start with Season 4 or you won't completely understand the undercurrents between the characters (not that you won't enjoy the show, but you have to see how the relationships have developed).",1394409600,,789,4.695652173913044
5065657,5,B0079ILHRG,"Highly engaging and very entertaining.  A well written, well acted neat, clean weekly series.  I enjoyed the first three seasons so was immediately pleased when the 4th season became available.

For my tastes the episodes are each a joy to watch and capture my attention throughout. I'm not much of a TV watcher anymore, but The Murdoch Mysteries have rekindled my interest and I look forward to sitting down with my wife after our day has wound down and watching each episode before retiring for the evening.",1394409600,,509,4.827586206896552

5065661,5,B0079ILHRG,Humorous and intelligent.  Great stories.  The subplot with Murdoch and Dr Ogden keeps you guessing.  We just can't get enough of this show.,1394236800,,140,5.0
5065662,5,B0079ILHRG,"This series came to me via a suggestion from Netflix, and I was hooked right away.  It's set in Canada and produced by the CBC.  The main character William Murdoch is the perfect handsome nerd with a brilliant mind for inventing and detecting as well as a bumbling love interest in the coroner, Julia Ogden.  Add in the chief inspector Brackenreid and Constable Crabtree, and it's a great core cast.  The stories are inventive and do a great job of blending history in the making with today's science and inventions.  For example, they always refer to ""fingermarks"" rather than fingerprints, and when they find a 2-way mirror in a hotel room, they ponder how that might one day assist in police interrogations.  Watch this series, it's one of the best I've ever seen!  Netflix has 3 seasons, and Acorn TV has up to season 6.  After that, you can probably watch season 7 on CBC itself.

5065677,5,B0079ILHRG,"The plots are engaging, the characters are interesting, the 1890s scenery is delightful.

5065678,5,B0079ILHRG,"Yannick Bisson is perfect to play Detective Murdock.  He is sort of a stuffed shirt type, but soooo likable.

5065680,5,B0079ILHRG,Season four is the most recent in the Murdoch Mysteries that I have viewed. I thoroughly enjoyed each episode in this period series. The play on words and the subtle interaction between characters make this a series that will be fun to revisit. The murder mysteries kept my interest throughout.

5065683,5,B0079ILHRG,"Great series, a Sherlock Holmes of 1900 in Canada. A detective who was ahead of his time. There is danger, intrigue, deductive reasoning and even a hint of romance.

5065699,5,B0079ILHRG,"I have been really enjoying watching this show. Its set in old time Toronto, Canada. The character portrayals are very well done and endearing.  It is great fun to watch Detective Murdoch come up with fascinating, brilliant inventions that already exist in our time frame. I always enjoy watching a well done detective show where the lead character is so good that he can solve any crime, no matter how stumped everyone else is. There are enjoyable characters on this show. The adorable slightly bumbly side kick. The beautiful, smart, strong, ahead of her time, coroner, love interest who is smart enough and clever enough to make a good mental match for Detective Murdoch. The burbon drinking, slightly tough, failable, but likeable, chief. This is a thoroughly enjoyable show. If you have a chance, you should watch it. I had the best time watching episode after episode here on Amazon.

This show is currently running on TV. Including brand new episodes. When it is on TV here in America it is called Artful Detectives. Amazon goes by, what i believe is, the original Canadian title, Murdoch Mysteries. Enjoy!",1393804800,,1113,4.914893617021277
5065700,5,B0079ILHRG,I GAVE THIS SERIES SUCH A HIGH RATING BECAUSE I LOVE HOW THE DRAMA UNFOLDS. I ALSO FEEL LIKE THESE CHARACTERS COULD OF EXISTED EASILY IN THE PAST. I ENJOY THAT IT IS A CLEAN SERIES IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.,1393804800,,205,3.9047619047619047

5065702,5,B0079ILHRG,"Murdoch Mysteries excels at careful writing and attention to detail.  It avoids the crutch of special effects and delivers an entertaining, cerebral yarn.
The character of Det. William Murdoch is multifaceted and evolving.  The choice of material is fetching and timely.  It is a period drama that transcends time.
In all, this series is all that is good in television programming and shames the pabulum we are force fed in the United States.",1393632000,,442,5.027397260273973

5065716,5,B0079ILHRG,I like most of the plots and how the actors make that period come alive.  I did not know that much about Toronto or History from the Canandian point of view so that was interesting.  The acting is exceptional and of course the romantic angst between the two leading characters is endearing.  For the most part it is moralistic and refreshing...return to a simpler time where women looked and acted like women!,1393459200,,409,4.652777777777778
5065717,5,B0079ILHRG,We love this series.  Watch it or buy it.  Well worth it.  Production quality is excellent and always the Canadian references.  Love it.,1393459200,,136,4.782608695652174

5065719,5,B0079ILHRG,"This show is my guilty pleasure.  It's not fabulous and doesn't have the ""steampunk"" vibe that I was looking for, but Bisson is easy on the eyes and Harris has developed into a solid second banana who has grown out of being the slapstick comedy foil and into a good partner in storytelling.",1393372800,,290,4.471698113207547

We have enjoyed the fun twists and turns of the plots, embedded with Murdoch's ingenious inventions and familiar faces from history that pop up from time to time.

I really enjoy that episodes are about 45 minutes in length yet there are dominant themes that follow all the way through the series.  Murdoch and Julia are really quite pathetic in their interactions and Darcy is totally oblivious to their 'electricity"".  Crabtree and the inspector are very appropriate supporting cast.  The tales are a little ""cheesy"" at times but this is a refreshing change from the garbage we are fed on network television.",1393113600,,506,4.91764705882353

5065796,5,B0079ILHRG,"I stream a lot of mystery series on my internet TV.  The Murdoch Mysteries is outstanding, and it just keeps getting better.  The characters start out well defined and just keep growing.  The plots are intricate, the tie-ins with historical figures add panache, and the scientific inventions are icing on the cake.",1392768000,,314,5.0
5065797,5,B0079ILHRG,"My wife and I have been watching this show for 3 series and then it ended on Netflix. So we bought a Roku 3 and can watch series 4 and 5 plus lots of other of our favorite shows more current episodes on Amazon.

Anyway, this series is excellence. It takes place at the turn of the century - 19th to 20th in Toronto.
This is a Canadian series.

Some scientific breakthroughs are a bit contrived but they illustrate just how far we have come during the 20th century fighting crime and also our social attitudes.

I highly recommend it!!!",1392768000,,535,4.33
5065798,5,B0079ILHRG,"I love this series & I don't know why. Murdoch is so repressed. But he's brillant, clever, & ever true. Well written with a great  supporting cast. Personally I  relate to Murdoch's boss, hence the slapping reference in the caption. The only thing I get upset about is when is the next season up to bat.",1392681600,,303,4.392857142857143
5065799,5,B0079ILHRG,"I have found that these mysteries are intriguing. I find myself working to solve the case.
I like that  they have found the antique equipment. don't know if these items were actually used during
that time period.",1392681600,,212,4.72972972972973
5065800,5,B0079ILHRG,Seriously.  This was so brilliantly done and the cast was perfect. I wish there were more of these to watch.,1392681600,,108,4.4
5065801,5,B0079ILHRG,"I really enjoy this show. Murdock is honest and stead fast but still human and compassionate. There isn't gore in these shows. And I like how they make reference to things in history. For instances when Murdock is in upper Canada and meets Jack London and makes the statement  he would returned if he had ""a call to the wild"" and mr London liked the statement. These shows are fun to watch.",1392681600,,390,4.416666666666667

5065803,5,B0079ILHRG,"Set in 1890s Toronto with an excellent cast of regulars complemented by guest appearances of celebrities of the day, think Tesla, Henry Ford, Arthur Canon Doyle...and great mysteries. What's not to like. Oh, and don't forget the constant use of Toronto's wealth of houses and other structures still in use over 100 years later. BBC quality sets and costumes. Really a treat for mystery fans, especially those who love what the BBC has done with Miss Marple, Hercule Poirotte, or Sherlock Holmes.",1392595200,,495,5.048780487804878
5065804,5,B0079ILHRG,"The program is fun to watch for several reasons.  The late 19th century context, mannerisims, and costumes are interesting.  Having the series filmed in Canada instead of the USA is refreshing. The formality of the relationship between William and Julia seems so quaint in comparison with today's ""hook-up"" mentality. We especially like how Murdock develops forerunners of many forensic techniques in current practice.  Having just viewed a TV show on the applicability of Sherlock Holmes' methods including his laboratory to current crime labs, we were all the more enchanted by this duplicate endeavor within the Murdock plots.  We wonder why Murdock has been so non-assertive in pursuing Julia.  How difficult his high moral creed is for Julia.",1392595200,,747,5.35042735042735
5065805,5,B0079ILHRG,"Woven into these mysteries which take place at the turn of the 20th century is watching the advancement of criminology techniques by way of science. The characters are very colorful, and the audience gets a great mystery, romance ( between Detective Murdoch and medical examiner Julia Ogden) and the complete description of how the murder was solved through Murdoch's advanced knowledge of science. We also see real characters in history making appearances. It is quite entertaining.",1392595200,,483,5.368421052631579
5065806,5,B0079ILHRG,This series is lots of fun.  Interesting historical mystery series with an ongoing romantic angle.  This Canadian production is first rate in every respect!,1392595200,,156,5.458333333333333

5065808,5,B0079ILHRG,What a fantastic series they bring in famous people from the past and everything is authentic and correct. I noticed a pencil on a show that had been sharpened with a knife because there were no mechanical pencil sharpeners at that time. The cast is wonderful together and you can tell they genuinely care about one another.,1392595200,,324,4.701754385964913

5065835,5,B0079ILHRG,"My husband and I love this show! Sometimes we just get tired of all the explicit violence of the usual crime solving dramas, and just want to watch a show with great writing & acting minus the shock & gore of the most heinous criminal minds. Of course Murdoch and his team are still trying to solve a murder ,but they use a lot of historical references ( showing the infant stages of how we now "" get the bad guy""), great writing, great chemistry between the characters ,and even some humor to do it.",1392336000,,500,4.273684210526316

5065838,5,B0079ILHRG,"we love Murdoch Mysteries; got hooked on characters and forensics, tho' plots are a bit strained and there seem to be some anachronisms.  wish we could get closed captioning -- which we got with seasons 1-3 on  Netflix! glad nonetheless to get post season 3!",1392249600,,258,4.711111111111111
5065839,5,B0079ILHRG,"This season was just as entertaining as the first three seasons.  The historical background is excellent and we love the things that George thinks might become popular later - such as adhesive tape.  We have started the 5th season now through my Kindle Fire, but still watch the earlier season for the second time on TV when it's on.  The fourth season is well worth your time watching.  It is well written and keeps you trying to figure out the culprit while you enjoy the interaction between characters.",1392249600,,505,4.704545454545454

5065844,4,B0079ILHRG,The cast and characters blend beautifully in this series. The old culture attempting to jump into a more modern century makes the viewer aware of the advances that we have achieved to solve crime. Will Murdoch rid himself of his stiff stuffiness and reach his ultimate goal ... Julie?,1392076800,,284,4.816326530612245

5065883,5,B0079ILHRG,We are really enjoying this series. So happy that we can get this Canadian show from Amazon. Started out watching it on Netflix but they aren't carrying these recent seasons. It's another good reason to have an Amazon Prime membership.,1391990400,,235,4.9
5065884,5,B0079ILHRG,"Delightfully entertaining, great plots, excellent actors.  I love the turn-of-the-century Toronto setting.

Murdoch and the new pathologist do not get along, complicating Murdoch's efforts to solve crime. Adding to that is the loss of Julia, who has moved to the States, so Murdoch is a bit discombobulated at the start. Things begin to improve as Julia returns as pathologist, now if she just hadn't gotten herself engaged to Darcy........",1391990400,,505,5.023809523809524

5065887,5,B0079ILHRG,"Murdoch is an uptight Canadian Detective, series set early part 20th century, who has extraordinary deduction powers in the cases that come his way.

5065896,4,B0079ILHRG,"There is a new production company for the Murdock series  for Season 4.  The sets, plots and numbers of characters have expanded.  An interesting example is the model of cityscape of Victorian Toronto which is used film backdrop.  I just found out that the Murdoch series is still being produced and running in Canada and Murdoch and Dr. Ogden are still not yet ""together, romantically"".  I am already getting a little tired of the push-pull, will they or won't they be together over the first four years.  But, to think this goes one for another three years really seems to stretch it.",1391731200,,586,4.696078431372549

5065924,5,B0079ILHRG,"Murdoch Mysteries is an addicting mystery set in Toronto at the turn of the 20th century.  The writers cleverly insert period characters like Nikola Tesla and Arthur Conan Doyle and bring in the technological changes happening at the time.  Murdoch is an appealing hero, although very slow on the uptake on the wonderful coroner, Dr. Julia Ogden; repeatedly managing to miss opportunities to start a romantic relationship.  The supporting characters are uniformly good, and this is a wonderful series to watch.",1391472000,,510,5.271604938271605

5065939,3,B0079ILHRG,"For anyone interested in science, the best thing about the series is the clever way that real inventions are threaded into the plots. The worst thing is that brilliant, ethical people (Detective Murdoch and Doctor Ogden) are presented as nerds with no social graces to speak of and nearly everyone else as morons. The ending of Season 4 is almost unbelievable, and I am undecided whether I want to see the change of venue for Season 5.",1391385600,,435,4.662337662337662

5065967,4,B0079ILHRG,Murdoch is a quirky series not meant for everyone.  the story is corny in so many ways but if you take it for what it is and get a kick out of a turn of the century MacGyver (with a touch of Monk) who occasionally meets historical figures while solving crimes then this is for you.,1391040000,,281,4.017857142857143

The writing is just excellent, smooth, not too ""cop-ish"".  The characters are human and oh so different one from the other.

Murdoch gets Five well earned stars.",1390176000,,386,5.0
5066042,5,B0079ILHRG,"I find them much more enjoyable in many ways.
Let me first say that I LOVE current day action films but the way current-day technology is presented at its birth makes for a subtler, almost more interesting story because it can give us an idea of how they were introduced and people's reactions to them (not always positive).  Murdoch, himself, is, of course, ""different"" from his fellow officers because he's a bit refined, uses his intellect to solve crimes, and puts the law and what's right above all else - even his own happiness.  His superior officers, in contrast, are brawny, annoyed with him and it all makes for good character interplay.
In short, It's a different - just as the pbs show ""Sherlock"" is different to Basil Rathbone's Holmes.",1390176000,,749,4.753846153846154

Detective William Murdock solves intriguing mysteries using state of the art new inventions like finger printing, lie detection and many other techniques he invents.  Along with a great supporting cast the series mixes cozy, historical and romantic in unique challenges for Murdock with each episode.  My only complaint is Amazon streaming is awful!

Update - We just finished viewing the last episode of season 5 but where-oh-where are seasons 6 and 7?  Amazon should not leave us with an incomplete series.

5066142,5,B0079ILHRG,Love the way the writers weave historical bits and pieces into the plots. Enjoy the fresh ideas of creating a show that doesn't smack of Hollywood Smut and tainted characters. So refreshing! Too bad Hollywood is clueless and so unoriginal. Must be a reflection of their character no doubt!,1388793600,,289,4.918367346938775

It also gives a great opportunity to explore cultural changes that have taken place since then, and while it can sometimes view things a bit anachronistically, most of the time it presents those issues in a poignant, thought-provoking way.  Great acting, great writing.  I can't stop watching.",1388793600,,497,5.036585365853658

The cases are mysterious enough for my husband and the romance is just enough not to satisfy the romantic in me without hijacking the whole theme of the series.

It has the humor of 'The Thin Man', the thrill of the hunt and the deduction genius of Sherlock Holmes and Charlie Chan all wrapped up into one.  The methods that Murdoch and Constable Crabtree employ to unravel the clues to each case is spell-binding.  I didn't particularly enjoy the situation between Murdoch and Dr. Ogden there for a little while, but that seems to be working itself out.

5066194,3,B0079ILHRG,"There is nothing less rewarding than a main character whose development depends on increasing stupidity. Nothing in Murdoch's character leads us to think that he is less than a decent thinker who would surely decide that he must confront the irrationality in his life. Furthermore where is the interest? Lazy writing and obvious ploys which keep no one guessing seem to dominate this season. I still give it a three because, in spite of all this, the series does manage to keep a certain entertaining quality in the plotting, although character development is dismal. Season five gets to be even more irrational, but I can save that for another review.

Watch the season, but don't expect much in the way enlightenment or joy.",1388361600,,726,4.902439024390244
5066195,5,B0079ILHRG,"This a charming series set at the turn of the century with perfect period costumes and a plot woven in with actual historical characters and events.

Detective Murdoch has a mind like Sherlock Holmes, but is handsome and debonair.  His heart belongs to Dr Ogden and his love is returned, but their timing never seems to work out.....stay tuned.

The rest of the cast is amazing.  The show depends on the strength of the plot and the talent of the actors, not on special affects or gore.  Very little salty language, and is respectful of Murdoch's and others' religious beliefs, very refreshing.

Although each episode is self contained, you won't want to miss the development of the characters.  I highly suggest starting from the beginning of the series.  Enjoy!",1388361600,,763,4.8604651162790695
5066196,5,B0079ILHRG,"It's not just season 4 you should watch, but, every season!!! This show is so much more then a one hour mystery series. It is also a history lesson about turn of the century Toronto Canada.

The acting is great, the direction great and the sets are so well done. Some of the stories in this series are a little humorous and some mystery intense. The actors stay steadfast in the characters they play and you get to like that fact, no one all of a sudden becomes someone very different as the series goes on.

If you like ""Murder She Wrote"" you will love this! But in my humble opinion, it's 100 times better!",1388275200,,608,4.278260869565218
5066197,5,B0079ILHRG,"Murdoch is one of the classiest private eyes who originated scientific investigation along the lines of Sherlock Holmes. I enjoy the morality of the era, the costumes in the show, and the performances of the main cast. All first rate.",1388275200,,234,4.875
5066198,5,B0079ILHRG,"Among my all-time favorite mystery/police procedural TV shows. The violence is never ""on-screen"" even though some of the crimes are quite gruesome. A good blend of plot, characterization, and early (1910) police science.",1388275200,,220,5.696969696969697
5066209,5,B0079ILHRG,"Fun, fascinating. Glad Dr. Julia is back, thought we lost her. It gets better every single season. Thanks Canadian Broadcasting!",1388275200,,128,5.45
5066210,4,B0079ILHRG,"We can squeeze Murdoch in between Sherlock Holmes and the CSI bunch. Unlike those many characters, however, we find a devout Roman Catholic who is in love with the medical examiner, yet unable to relate to her in any romantic way. That relationship, of course, is a technical device used by the writers and producers to keep up watching. For all these TV shows are character driven. Murdoch is a character who is easy to like, and for a woman, he's easy to be infatuated with because the actor, Yannick Bisson, is very good looking.

The plot lines are very much in synch with the usual CSI types: murder mysteries which are solved with the use of science. Except this science is circa early 20th century.  One hundred years back. The CSI of today, I think, is overly confident. As is usual with TV, the writers must give us a murder, investigate it and then solve in, all within 48 minutes.  It's not real science, though it is based on what is happening in the world of forensics in this part of the century. Murdoch's science is primitive, to our way of thinking, though it's probably closer to what is used in most police departments. After all, how many can afford the science labs depicted in the CSI brand?

What makes Murdoch more entertaining is the human relationships he is involved in. The ME, Julia, his sidekick in the police department, Constable Crabtree, and the Inspector, Brackenreid, a hard drinking Yorkshireman who can hold his liquor. They are all strong characters in their own right.  The show is based upon a series of novels written by Maureen Jennings. Actual historical characters make their way through the episodes, people like Annie Oakley, Nicola Tesla, H.G. Wells, Jack London, and so forth.",1388275200,,1725,4.736666666666666

5066265,5,B0079ILHRG,"I discovered Murdoch Mysteries on Ovation TV (under the name ""The Artful Detective""), where I doubt it will get much promotion and it will be very difficult for the U.S. audience to discover in the ""high numbers wasteland"" of cable TV. This series is a terrific mix of slightly-steampunk Victorian costume drama, MacGyver-tech police procedural, X-Files-meets-Scooby-Doo unmasking of the supernatural, and clever mysteries and secret histories sprinkled with quirky comic moments and all the struggles of true love. Murdoch Mysteries has the addictive quality of genre TV even as it defies or transcends all categories. It crosses the intelligence of British TV with the pacing and eye candy of American TV, and produces a miraculous hybrid.

Murdoch Mysteries is set in Toronto, which for most U.S. viewers will be the equivalent of another planet, but this isn't ""alienating"" at all - the time period is familiar enough that the location could be Any City in the Victorian Era. Better yet, this series is Mom-safe: the humor doesn't go near the toilet (though it often finds its way into the morgue) and the modernizing values are cloaked in old-fashioned courtesy. In fact, I bought this series for my Mom for Christmas, and I know she's going to love it. Yet there's plenty for younger demographics to enjoy, from clockpunk gadgets to shipping favorite couples. (Though I must admit that the show occasionally teeters into rather awkward fan service on the shipping front - I'd rather see the passionate kiss than Constable Crabtree musing on when those crazy kids will get together.) Also, there is enough ""angst"" and outright depressing turns of events to enthrall the moodiest of Millennials. What more can the sick-of-reality-TV jaded American TV watcher ask?

Murdoch Mysteries is now in its 7th season in Canada, where the show is a big hit and the quality remains high. I just hope it will somehow be discovered by American viewers soon so the syndication money will pour in, and this wonderful show will continue for years to come.",1387152000,,2043,5.041420118343195

The period (late 1890's) dress  and scenery are very well done and make an interesting format for the stories to take place in.

Season 4 is the weakest so far in Murdoch Mysteries, a series I thoroughly enjoy.

5066315,4,B0079ILHRG,"While the production values on some of the scenes (ones involving cgi or fancy camera work) can be almost laughable sometimes, the rest of this series is quite enjoyable. A set of strong core characters and period setting keep me entertained, even if the mysteries aren't necessarily always top-notch who-done-it's. Throw in guest appearances from historical figures and some cheeky pop references (""the Murdoch identity"") and it's all good fun. This is also a very wholesome show, with some minor references to sex and regular murders, but nothing graphic or explicit is involved. Finally, the main character has a good set of values that he sometimes questions, so he doesn't come across as cartoonishly wholesome and feels ""real"".",1385942400,,733,5.220338983050848

5066358,4,B0079ILHRG,It is a good series -- a little hokey at times but overall good.

The series is just plain fun, focusing as it often does on the introduction of then-cutting edge (now often taken for granted) crime-solving techniques.  Something else, which I really appreciate, is that the actors actually enunciate, and it is easy to understand what they are saying!",1384819200,,338,5.3584905660377355
5066363,5,B0079ILHRG,"This series is slightly quirky, a bit like a more modern Sherlock Holmes, and the characters are completely likable, even the slightly grumpy ones. Very well written - a mystery to solve (TITLE?), but not too heavy on blood and such - more a story line. It's seti in a time period when all sorts of advances were taking place, both in medicine and tech as a whole - and the writers 'introduce' some of them in delightful ways.",1384819200,,426,4.405063291139241

It is nice to see characters that embody the strengths, weaknesses, talents and frailties of actual human beings. What is more, the characters grow professionally and personally from situation to situation and season to season.

There is a vaguely steampunk quality to some of the inventions but they are entirely plausible within the historical and scientific context of the time. Historical characters such as Arthur Conan Doyle, Nicola Tesla, Harry Houdini, and HG Wells add richness and plausibility to several of the stories.

If you are looking for smart, dynamic, humorous, and frequently evocative drama, look no further. This series should satisfy your cravings quite nicely.",1383782400,,793,5.387096774193548

I am a sucker for the Victorian era, and the fact that the series is set in Toronto, Canada, gives it a different slant. Great mysteries, humorous characters, and the clever (if contrived and not necessarily accurate) introduction of modern-day technology as  inventions of the titled character, make this a very entertaining show. Also, I would kill for Yannick Bisson's eyelashes. :)",1383264000,,478,5.115384615384615
5066410,5,B0079ILHRG,Witty detective series with well developed characters. I especially Sargent Crabtree whose character has expanded over the series to be an intregal part of Murdoch's sleuthing while maintaining a sweetness and a boyish charm. Many of the plots are crafted to reflect an old time take on modern life such as the one depicting the telegraph communications of people cloaked in anonymity that parallels chat rooms and on-line relationships. Or the one where microwaves used in a murder have Sargent Crabtree musing that someday these waves could be used to cook yams.,1383091200,,564,5.141304347826087

Toronto, early 20th century, proves to be superior to NYC or LA.  It is also refreshing to experience elevated intelligence, solid characters, steady morality and gentle behavior rather than the endless crassness of Hollywood.  I'd much rather my 15 year-old watch this solid series featuring characters of sensible morality than be immersed in the depraved crap from Left Coast, USA.",1382140800,,513,5.283950617283951

If you've never seen the series, look for and watch the earlier seasons first as there are some ongoing story lines.
A very entertaining and refreshing change, especially if you like ""period"" pieces and the turn of the 20th century in particular. Not quite as scientific and invention driven as I first thought, so steampunk fans will find it lacking in that department. All in all just a pleasant whodunnit with fun and amusing characters.

We love the way they bring in historical figures of that era and of course Yannick is so easy on the eyes. This series is comfortable to watch because it isn't dark like some of the other British mysteries.  A very big plus for my husband I is the Closed Captioning, we are in our eighties and  have 8o year old hearing so CC is a must for us.

5066646,5,B0079ILHRG,love this show. Nice to see a new take on turn of the century law enforcement. Interesting to see how some of these tools came into use. Although Murdock didn't invent them I sure the same ideas started in simular ways.,1373328000,,219,4.365853658536586

It is witty and the characters have remained the same.  They have a lot of attention to

It really is a great show.  Highly recommended",1373241600,,285,3.982456140350877

5066692,5,B0079ILHRG,"I love Murdoch mysteries. I love the way the writers tie famous people from history or inventions in with the plot. One of the things that kept the series fresh was the ""almost but not quite"" relationship between Murdoch and the doctor.  I was really thrown a curve when the doctor got married. Was it brilliant or stupidity on the part of the writers to do this. Time will tell, but whichever it was, it made me wanting to come back for more in season 5. I will just have to wait patiently until it is covered in the Prime cost.",1373068800,,529,4.237623762376238

It's a great break from today's overhyped, canned, formulized, suspense shows that seem to dominate the media.

5066728,4,B0079ILHRG,"Murdoch Mysteries is set in turn of the 19-20th century Toronto.  Murdoch is a clean living well educated sleuth who devises technology tools to aid in catching criminals.  The devices  anticipate present day technology, for example scanning and digitizing photographs of criminals for transmission over telegraphy/telephony and distant image reconstruction.  Well known historical figures regularly pass through the installments: Arthur Conan Doyle, Nicola Tesla, Buffalo Bill.  At times the dialogue is a bit corny, but all in all the show is well produced and very entertaining.  And, the depiction of violence is kept to a minimum.  We enjoy it.",1372550400,,649,5.494949494949495
5066759,5,B0079ILHRG,Have watched from Season 1 and find the writing great characters well played and the premise of the beginnings of forensic science for use in solving crime well done.

5066760,5,B0079ILHRG,"Murdoch Mysteries typically take up social and scientific issues that we recognize from the twenty-first century and thus give the period charm of this series an added lustre of relevance. The clothing, furnishings, and architecture are a pleasure to watch, but it's the characters that make this series so compelling. Detective William Murdoch is a modern-day knight, and Dr. Julia Ogden is his lady, struggling with issues of work and love, trapped not in a tower but in a marriage to the wrong person. The love story of these immensely likeable characters drives this series.

Grisly crimes are solved by noble men and women. Period charm is balanced by a timeless story.",1372377600,,674,5.017857142857143

I love the show, but the video keeps stopping and starting, making it very difficult to watch. This seems to be especially true in the evening hours. My internet connection shows to be at full strength, so I don't think that is the problem.
I don't plan to renew at the end of my trial run if somrthing isn't done to improve the quality.
I love Amazon for everything else....products etc., speed of shipping, but am VERY disappointed that I probably won't renew the Prime membership.

It has historical interest, who dun it interest, and a little romantic interest.... even a little (I suspect) tongue in cheek spoofing of the detective genre.  And some nicely developed characters, like the constable, the inspector, and of course Murdoch.  What it doesn't have is obscene language just because it can, and gratuitous violence.

5066828,5,B0079ILHRG,These period mysteries are always entertaining.  I think they are elegant and the romantic tension between the two leading actors is quite entertaining.

5066902,5,B0079ILHRG,My husband and I watch this show together.  it is a crime show set in the early 1900's.  Innovative detective.,1369785600,,110,4.45
5066903,5,B0079ILHRG,These episodes are FANTASTIC!  They skillfully combine a real mystery with subtle comedy...I wish they would make 100 seasons!  Keep 'em coming!,1369785600,,144,5.5

While the themes presented are late 19th century issues, they are still contemporary in this 21st century world.

5066940,5,B0079ILHRG,Starting with the first season you are pulled into the family of Murdoch.  As it happens at times work becomes your family and his is a little dysfunctional but loveable at the same time.  This is such a great season with things heating up so I highly recommend watching it.,1369267200,,274,4.46

5066943,5,B0079ILHRG,I like this series not only for its entertainment value but also because the writers seem to be able to fabricate good story-lines without reliance on gratuitous sex and also while limiting political correctness: though P C occasionally rears its ugly head. I also think the acting is good and I particularly like the characters.,1369180800,,329,5.0

THE REVELATIONS OF INVENTIONS YET TO COME IS SO INTERESTING. THE TIME PERIOD THE SHOW IS SET IN IS ONE I FIND GREAT INTEREST IN NOW THAT I HAVE WATCHED THIS SHOW.

5066948,4,B0079ILHRG,Enjoyable series with an inventor/detective as a twist. Won't keep you up at night which I consider a plus. People not computer graphics dominate which is also a plus.,1368921600,,167,4.793103448275862

5066965,3,B0079ILHRG,"Compared with today's American crime shows, this series verges on being cute and cuddly.  I'd say sample it before you buy it, as it may be an acquired taste.  Despite the gory murders involved, the show is so neat and clean that its episodes might meet the requirements for segments in ""Sesame Street.""  Even the fake blood sparkles as though it's just been mixed.  At the same time, the plots are varied enough to hold one's attention.  And some long-standing social issues crop up now and then that are dealt with in ways that might be appropriate for the late 1800s, when the show is set.  The cast is overall quite attractive, especially Detective Murdoch and his colleague and frequent romantic interest, the coroner Julia Ogden.  It occurs to me that TV coroners, both Canadian and American, are more often women than is the case in the real world, where I believe medical examiners are almost never women.  Of course the Murdoch Mysteries would become rather less neat and clean if Detective Murdoch's romantic interest were not as she is.",1368835200,,1047,4.777777777777778

5066967,5,B0079ILHRG,"The characters are so lovable, each is his/her own right. While there is some fanciful use of techniques by Murdoch, the use of Victorian era culture gives a glimpse  of the life my now departed grandparents were born into. Yes, it is frustrating to watch Murdoch and Julia continue to narrowly miss connecting as lovers but the adventures of each show are quite entertaining and remind us that the growth in scientific knowledge and social awareness of that time was breaking new ground and saw no limits. You can't help but laugh at the comments of Crabtree conjecturing on ""someday.""",1368748800,,586,4.86
5066968,5,B0079ILHRG,Good acting and set designs.  A great showing of the time.  Topics are great for the whole family.  Shows the early days of science with a good mystery story.,1368662400,,158,4.379310344827586

5067000,5,B0079ILHRG,"The writing is consistently well done; the characters have grown and developed over the seasons to the point you both anticipate and care about what happens to them.  Quirky use of well known BBC TV actors works as well.  The show would not be what it is without Constable George Crabtree (both as written in the script and acted by the actor).  Also, you gotta love a show that has a police constable named Henry Higgins.  I'm hoping some day Constable Higgins gets his own series, with Higgins as his side-kick. He'd be an early 20th Century Jessica Fletcher.",1368144000,,561,4.636363636363637

5067003,4,B0079ILHRG,"It is refreshing to view a series from ""days gone by"" - people respecting each other, no smut, etc.  The way the writers include things that took place in history is great, such as inventions, electricity, etc. contribute to wonderful episodes!  LOVED Yannick Bisson in Sue Thomas F.B.Eye and he's good in this series also.  I don't think it was ever aired in the U.S.  ~ our loss.  A lot of awesome actors/actresses hail from Canada - keep them coming!",1368057600,,453,4.6125
5067004,5,B0079ILHRG,"One of the best acted, produced and entertaining shows EVER. And we've been watching TV for over 50 years. Books are a let down, which is unusual; it's usually the other way around. Definitely worth every penny.",1368057600,,211,4.72972972972973

5067040,5,B0079ILHRG,"My Husband and I just love the TV series. Everyone does a fantastic job, we are drawn in, and feel as if we are right there. It wonderful to watch an entertaining show, that is clean, no language, and no sex scenes. I'm glad that the show is being renewed for another 2 years and doesn't follow the book exactly, in regards to William Murdock as womanizer in the book and Dr. Ogden an older lady. Love the chemistry that they have for each other and hope that they will eventually marry. I don't know why the main character can't be happy, and be married with children. William Murdock deserves all these things, after watching show after show, you really want William to be happily married. Since he really loves Dr. Ogden  deeply and she truly love him the same.  I get a big kick out of how they included future inventions, technology, and even games, into pretty much each show, usually by George. Quite a funny show, but serious too.",1367625600,,938,4.47953216374269
5067041,5,B0079ILHRG,"If you have ever been to Toronto, you will be surprised that it never snows on Murdoch Mysteries. Maybe there were no murders or thefts during the cold months in Victorian Times? Be the times they were a changin'. Forensics determining the difference between animal and human blood, the first uses of meth for military purposes, the fact that abortion was a fact-of-life even in Queen V's day, use of photo surveillance, even a nod to modern day photo-shopping. William Murdoch is early day 'MacGyver', a well-read man with few, if any vices.

Many of the stories link to our current times, sometimes in very amusing ways, sometimes in very scary ways,  so the history lessons won't put you to sleep. The romance is slow, but the characters are outstanding. My favorite show in 15-20 years. American TV has nothing to compare since ""QED"" in 1982, and that lasted 6 whole episodes.",1367625600,,880,4.782894736842105
5067042,5,B0079ILHRG,"The main character is reminescent of Sherlock Holmes who actually makes an appearance in one episode along with other notable historical figures real and fiction.

I haven't seen season 5 yeat and a not sure about the change in venue, but look forward to it nonetheless.",1367625600,,430,5.1

There is some action thrown in as well, but it is all very family friendly.  It has some tongue in cheek where it makes allusions to future technologies and fads such as paint by numbers or the microwave.  It is very multi-layered and highlights some interesting nuances in regard to human behavior.

5067180,5,B0079ILHRG,"Murdoch Mysteries is one of our favorite shows - it's very well produced and the actors do a wonderful job creating interesting and realistic relationships.  Mostly though, it's the writing that brings it all together allowing the actors to bring these characters to life.  I love watching shows about a time period that I'm not familiar with - it's interesting to see how the technology of the time is introduced as well as the social beliefs of the time and how they change the way people live their lives.  This show is entertaining, action packed as well as educational - a perfect combination!",1366156800,,598,4.786407766990291

5067183,5,B0079ILHRG,"I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys intelligent plots, science and references to contemporary methodology and products, beautiful turn of the century clothing - woman and men, sexual tension between the main male and female characters, conclusion and culmination of the case through investigation, science, and follow-through.
I'm disappointed though, that Seasons 5 and 6 are not available for free streaming.",1365897600,,425,5.761904761904762
5067184,4,B0079ILHRG,"The series seems to have run out of plot lines, with Murdoch now unrealistically developing half the forensic devices of the past 100 years. Helene Joy now seems to be pretty much carrying the show. I believe the phrase is that the show has ""jumped the shark.""",1365897600,,260,4.553191489361702

5067226,5,B0079ILHRG,We love mysteries that are not crude and sexually explicit.  Murdoch mysteries are cleverly done.  There is suspense and an ongoing romance that leaves you wanting to watch the next episode.  The methods used by Detective Murdoch are very interesting.  We have come to love the characters in the series and would highly recommend watching it.,1365724800,,342,5.053571428571429

5067229,5,B0079ILHRG,"Really enjoy this series....after finding this on Netflix I have been watching ever since.  The quality of this show should be a mentor for other tv shows.  The characters, the settings and of course the acting is excellent.  The plots are fun and truly enjoyable. Don't miss this program. (:o)",1365465600,,294,4.84

5067231,5,B0079ILHRG,"Lots of ""suspension of disbelief"" here (mostly around technology that was sort of around...but probably not in Toronto), but over all a very entertaining show.  Caught the first three seasons on NetFlicks, the next one on Amazon Prime.  Cannot wait for the next couple to come out.",1365465600,,281,4.957446808510638

5067243,5,B0079ILHRG,"Great series.  This isn't my favorite season due to drawn-out pining for Dr. Ogden, but otherwise it's always fun to watch this modern tv series take on issues in its Victorian setting.  I enjoy the references to Victorian inventions and literature, as well as allusions to modern detection methods; though my husband, a history teacher, is a bit more critical of its accuracy.  The characters continue to develop their personalities and relationships, which is one of the main reasons I like this show.  I'm bummed at how often the killer is a victimized ""good guy"" who feels no other way out but to kill a really ""bad guy"" so that ""justice"" means the nice guy gets hanged.  I guess I expect a little of this postmodern irony, but it doesn't make an episode's conclusion very satisfying.  Overall, though, the mysteries are varied and interesting, and the solutions are not usually obvious at first, which is nice.  It's clean enough that I can watch it while my kids are still awake.  My current favorite show.",1365379200,,1012,4.775862068965517

5067246,5,B0079ILHRG,"I have watched the entirety of the five seasons and I can say that I was enthralled the entire time. The depiction of Victorian life is amazingly detailed. The manners and mores of the age are convincingly portrayed. I especially enjoyed the ingenuity displayed by the scientifically minded hero as he applies his knowledge of science to the infant science of forensics. Heavy issues involving women's rights, abortion, racism, religious intolerance and corruption in politics are handled with realism and sensitivity. I was also extremely fond of the treatment of Canadian views of America. It is very interesting to learn for how long the USA has been feared by Canada and what historical events have given rise to such fear.
Enjoy!!!!",1365033600,,737,5.099173553719008

5067248,5,B0079ILHRG,"I discovered this series two weeks ago on Netflix.  I had to purchase the fifth season through Amazon Prime but it was worth it.  What a gem!!  The series is still in production and showing on Canadian television (CBC).  Season 6 is winding up this month.  The historical facts are accurate (as far as I can tell), the directing is original, the story lines are well thought out, the characters are flawless. I have watched every episode to date and can choose neither a favorite (although there are several contenders) or a dud!  It is fascinating to see how much society has changed on so many different levels since 1900.  I envy the Canadians!!",1365033600,,648,4.631578947368421

5067252,5,B0079ILHRG,"I found this show just recently and watched every season except for the current.  The premise is great, the stories are suspenseful, and frankly Inspector Murdoch is extremely handsome, and intelligent.  The character is surrounded by characters you will grow to adore, and the constant guest appearances of historical figures of the era is delightful.  A must watch if you like mysteries, and scientific mystery solving.",1365033600,,421,5.348484848484849
5067273,4,B0079ILHRG,If you are a fan of Sherlock Holmes and modern police procedural dramas you'll like this unique blend of both.  It is set around the turn of the century and the hero is on the forefront of technology as it existed then.  He has a scientific bent and strong deductive reasoning ability (like Sherlock).  He invents devices and methods for solving the crime that are a main stay of forensics today.  I get a kick out of the introduction of new ideas and inventions that although not regarded as such at the time are revolutionary.  The appearance of real historical figures and the tableau of everyday life in late 1800's Canada is informative and entertaining.  The murder mystery around which each episode is based holds up well.  The one drawback though is the character of the hero.  He is wooden and one dimensional for most of the series.  The writers would do well to hasten his evolution into a fuller character with an idiosyncrasy or two.  The romantic angle is forced and more distracting than enjoyable.  Overall a fun watch and a good buy.,1364947200,,1050,4.6521739130434785
5067274,5,B0079ILHRG,Plots are very creative although bordering on the absurd at times.  But it's great fun so who cares about the latter.,1364860800,,117,4.571428571428571
5067275,5,B0079ILHRG,"I read and watch mysteries of all types, most of them more contemporary. But I was lucky to find Murdoch (have watched seasons 1-3, now on 4) which is a slower, period series with great characters and ""unusual murders"" to solve. I really appreciate the writing and the inclusion of ""new"" inventions in the plots, along with a good dose of humor and the development of the main characters. I'm thoroughly enjoying Murdoch and hope it continues for a long time.",1364860800,,459,4.679012345679013

5067278,5,B0079ILHRG,"Great writers keep getting better it seems with this show. My Wife and I watch an episode each night. The ensemble cast is great and all contribute in solving murder cases. A dose of romance is injected too. The best Canadian TV we've seen, and from what we have seen it's better than most American shows that are tuned for younger action-craving fans. Don't miss!",1364601600,,364,4.615384615384615
5067279,4,B0079ILHRG,"Detective Murdoch and his sidekick Crabtree are fanciful investigators of murder in Toronto.  In the investigation of their crimes Murdoch's scientific dabblings lead him to develop tools and methods to aid the investigations which include everything from using coal dust to recover ""finger marks"" to devising a machine to monitor sound waves underwater (sonar). Allow his inability to express his love to his colleague, pathologist Dr. Julia Ogden (also very cutting edge for her time) is the frustrating undertone of the series.  The characters of the Toronto Constabulary are lovable and quirky. And although the topic of murder is not funny and the series is not a comedy, it does take a lighter aire and does not have the blood, guts and violence of most crime dramas.  Sadly this is the last season I've watched because despite enjoying the series, I refuse to pay $2.99 per episode for subsequent seasons.",1364601600,,912,5.066666666666666

5067284,5,B0079ILHRG,"I started watching with Season 1, being from the States and not being familiar with the series. You don't have to be a fan of historical dramas to like this show. Very addictive, at least for me! Bits of humor here and there as well. Wish they carried it on US TV, but, if we remade it, they'd ruin it by making it overly dark or gory.

Season 5 is available for purchase (they are currently in Season 6)...tried to view it on the CBC site, but it keeps saying content is unavailable. Too bad NAFTA can't help with that. :)",1364515200,,523,4.178217821782178

Murdock is a detective that uses primitive forms of science that would not be known until later in the 20th century. The science as well as social issues are premature for the time frame but very valuable when fast forwarded. The characters Murdock, Dr Julia Ogden, the Chief Inspector, and Constable Crabtree are regulars and play very well together. The scenes depicting period Toronto are delightful as well as beautiful. Try to watch the series in order, 1, 2, & 3 then 4 as they do tie together.",1364428800,,595,4.730769230769231

The chemistry between the main characters is palpable, the stories are compelling, and the writing is excellent.  Murder mysteries set in victorian-era Toronto may seem like an odd premise at first, but give it a shot.  I guarantee you'll find yourself saying ""just one more episode.""

Not only are the characters well developed and fun to spend time with, but the story lines are clever and well thought out. The relationship between William and Julia is compelling and you can't help rooting for them.
We especially enjoy George Crabtree. The sweetly naive constable adds humor and warmth to every episode and who can resist Inspector Brackenreid. He reminds me of a crusty uncle with a soft under belly! ( In fact I had one just like him!)
We also appreciate all of the historical references and characters.

5067335,5,B0079ILHRG,Another Great show.  Please get more like this and JAG for Amazon Prime.  This show kept my interest throughout the seasons.,1363392000,,124,4.857142857142857

5067337,4,B0079ILHRG,Murdoch and the back story in Canada with period history makes for interesting mystery plots. Bisson fills it well and adds character to the part.,1363305600,,146,4.88
5067338,5,B0079ILHRG,"Characters written with depth & intelligence gives us all a show that has no equal on regular network television. Even though the label compares it to ""CSI"", ""Murdoch Mysteries"" boasts little of the gore, and much more intellectual stimulation. Historical tie-ins give the viewer more to entice the imagination. The mysteries are complex, the characters multi-dimensional and the settings are beautiful.",1363219200,,403,5.622950819672131

as Murdock uses basic knowlege and ingenuity to invent early crime detecting tools.",1363219200,,166,5.384615384615385
5067341,5,B0079ILHRG,"Very enjoyable dynamic between Murdoch and Ogden.  What is with you William?!  Definitely not a brain busting mystery, but interesting characters in Victorian era Toronto.",1363219200,,171,5.8
5067342,5,B0079ILHRG,So very glad to see it has been a renewed series.  Like to watch and see how it might have been done 100 years ago.,1363219200,,115,3.6

5067345,5,B0079ILHRG,"Murdoch Mysteries is a great series if you like a good clean, low-keyed ""who dunnit?"" program.  It has just enough suspense to keep your interest, yet it is without all of the gory violence in most of today's mysteries.  The storyline of his love for Dr. Odgen is also a good addition to keep the viewer's interest.  The introduction of characters-famous authors, scientists_ as they appear briefly in the mysteries adds a nice touch.

i love the series!",1363219200,,454,4.782051282051282

5067364,5,B0079ILHRG,"Murdoch Mysteries has got to be hands down my favorite show. Its got thrill,comedy,and lots of characters to fall in love with!
Dr. Odgen is my favorite. Set in victorian era, Murdoch (Yannick Bisson) is solving crimes with a futuristic twist.
This is a must show. I tell all my friends and family to watch. defiantly not a show for the younger kids but has some good morals.
cant wait to purchase season 5!!!",1362614400,,409,4.54054054054054
5067365,5,B0079ILHRG,"Detective Murdoch operates in a division of the Toronto constabulary at the turn of the century.  He is an enterprising and forward looking young man who delights in the new sciences of detection.  The character meets many of the scientists of the period and uses their ideas to help him in his work.  The characters are completely believable and human, and often very funny, sometimes very sad.  The acting is perfect and the time line of the actual case is believable and much more consistent with actual investigations of our time.  I would really recommend this series to people who like their mysteries well written, well acted, and beautifully set in a very well researched time period.",1362614400,,692,4.880341880341881

Well worth it but really do they have to be so expensive!",1362355200,,156,5.038461538461538
5067370,5,B0079ILHRG,"I was pleasantly surprised with this series- Victorian Toronto with hints of the future fighting crime. A detective who is a strict Catholic that forces some unique approaches to some issues. Very ""proper"" in their interactions and stiff- but that is what makes it fun.
A decent hour spent and the whole family can enjoy",1362355200,,320,4.836363636363636

5067373,5,B0079ILHRG,Watched the first three seasons over streaming video service and discovered I was addicted to the series. Season 4 was not available on stream so I bought the DVD. Was not disappointed. Season 5 is out but costs way too much. I will have to go cold turkey or watch reruns.,1362268800,,272,4.352941176470588
5067374,5,B0079ILHRG,The characters really grow on you and the story line often takes unexpected twists.  Murdoch exemplifies living a good and righteous life in an inspiration way that will make you want to be a better person.,1362182400,,206,4.722222222222222
5067375,5,B0079ILHRG,What a great season and what an amazing ending!  Just can't wait for the fifth season!  Wish there was less with Dr Ogden. Like her character but the relationship no longer makes sense.  But the growth of Murdoch's character is so good.  Though not as many historic figures the regular characters are grown and matured so well.,1362096000,,327,4.684210526315789
5067376,5,B0079ILHRG,What a wonderful show. Want to see Season 5 now. Can't wait. You won't regret watching these amazing actors. Very much worth the price.,1362096000,,135,4.666666666666667
5067377,4,B0079ILHRG,"Even though this series is considered a drama, I still enjoy its ""campy"" moments...and there are many.  The characters are all well developed and likable.  The George Crabtree character is a delight with all of his off-the-cuff comments that tie into the future as we already know it.  Even the stiff and very proper Murdoch is an appealing guy.  Much of the ""fun"" of the series are Murdoch's crime-fighting inventions.  Using the technology that existed in that era (end of the 19th century), he conjures up crude versions of our modern day technology such as night-vision goggles and sonar.  Real history appears in many of the episodes, along with real historical figures that have a part in the fictional mystery.  A very enjoyable, light-hearted mystery.",1362009600,,759,5.024
5067378,5,B0079ILHRG,This has been a fascinating series from the beginning.  The character of Inspect. Murdoch as well as Coroner Julia Ogden are rich and interesting.  The elementary crime solving techniques of Murdoch are believable and intriguing.  I will be so sorry when this season ends.  Is there hope for another season?????,1362009600,,311,5.16
5067379,4,B0079ILHRG,This series is well acted and has interesting plot twists.  There is a good balance between the murder mysteries and the personal relationships of the characters.  There is also a good dose of humor in the mix.,1362009600,,210,4.648648648648648

5067382,4,B0079ILHRG,Too many of today's television series are based on atemping to make their portrayal of violence and gory death as realistic as possible.  This series demonstrates that it is possible to create an interesting and entertaining program without resorting to such titillation..,1361923200,,272,5.476190476190476
5067402,5,B0079ILHRG,I love this show i have seen all five seasons and hope there is a number six. I would like to see what happens between Dr. Ogden and murdoch,1361923200,,140,3.8620689655172415
5067403,5,B0079ILHRG,"The mystery plots are creative, unique, and interesting; the program also adds humor and compassion and a look at Toronto, Canada in the 1890's. Many of the episodes show the science which led to inventions we enjoy today.",1361836800,,222,4.868421052631579
5067404,5,B0079ILHRG,The characters in the series are engaging and personable.  The stories are believable and creative.  The tongue in cheek inventions are an added bonus.  Watch more than one to get into the characters and you'll watch them all.,1361836800,,226,4.894736842105263
5067405,5,B0079ILHRG,Interesting and fun to watch.  My wife and I both love the series.  Can't wait for other seasons to become available.,1361836800,,117,4.523809523809524

5067432,5,B0079ILHRG,The series is great. I enjoy the lack of bad language and the women who don't have to show skin to be attractive.,1361491200,,113,3.9565217391304346
5067433,5,B0079ILHRG,The show reminds me of the old Star Trek shows. Always using some of political or social comment. Plus reference to modern technological progress.,1361491200,,146,5.125

And the inclusion of all the inventors, inventions and celebrates of the time is priceless. Watching the solving of a crime with the forensics of the time and the references of future techniques is extremely clever. Left me wanting to watch one season after another. Which brings me to a question for you; where is season six?",1361145600,,461,4.703703703703703

5067440,5,B0079ILHRG,"It's slow enough moving that all the nuances can be caught, full of historical tidbits, and has the hokey romantic push pull that is none the less interesting.  I wish Amazon had season 5.",1360800000,,188,4.529411764705882
5067460,5,B0079ILHRG,"I love this series. All the people in the mix of a actors and actresses interface beautifully in each episode. The way they bring historical figures into the scripts gives a sense of ""being there"" to see some people thar have always been my personal role models in life. My hat is off and my head is bowed with thanks to the producers, cast and crew of Murdock Mysteries. I would think it a tragedy if this series does no go beyond 10 seasons and when it does it should end gratefully. ..  not abruptly.",1360800000,,503,4.294736842105263

5067464,4,B0079ILHRG,"The addition of the historical accurate context makes this series stand out. Characters are likeable and acting is by and large good (although I wish Murdoch would be a bit more outwardly expressive when he's wrapped up in his inner life). The relationship between  Julia and Murdock is so frustrating -- even in the 1890s, would former lovers be so reticent to speak their minds?",1360713600,,380,4.846153846153846

5067480,5,B0079ILHRG,"This show reminds me of the mysteries I watched at the movies or listened to on the radio, as a youngster.  A Sherlock Holmes type of entertainment, if you will.  For the ones I've seen so far have not been so gruesome as so many of this type usually are.  I like the time frame, as people then were still using their manners.  Dr. Ogden's, (Helene Joy) role is also done very well, though I rarely watch the details she has to show being a pathologist.  I look everywhere but at the bodies being exposed.  I like the fact that these policemen/constables did not carry fire-arms and wish it could be that way this day & time.  I particularly like Mr. Murdock explaining his method of sleuthing, and the facts that were known at that time & the devices he makes & uses & what they will eventually come to be known as, and who first made such a contraption is very interesting to me.  I think this show could be viewed & understood by any member of the family 7 yrs old or older, it being very educational in many ways. Besides all that Mr. Yannick Bisson is extremely easy on the eyes to watch.  :)",1360540800,,1097,4.260869565217392
5067481,5,B0079ILHRG,"Murdoch Mysteries is a great who-done-it set in Canada at the turn of the century.  With a female coroner (absolutely unheard of in 1880's), Murdoch solves murder mysteries while becoming the forerunner to most of today's modern inventions.

An interesting, thought-provoking, bemusing & well-acted presentation!",1360540800,,372,5.607142857142857

5067509,5,B0079ILHRG,"The characters are so well done....fun and great casting. A totally enjoyable mystery series that weaves in the world-changing inventions of the times; a nice twist. I even got swept up in the romance between Murdoch and Julia, which I thought would detract from the plot, but it has pulled me in! Yannick Bisson plays the upright, solid, repressed male of the age with perfection. He frames this conventional persona with intelligence, compassion and a sense of justice that allows glimpses into the his true dreams and desires- and his goodness.  Julia, the independent woman physician is as frustratingly reticent about her feelings for him as well. Constable Crabtree and the chief- Brackenreid- round out the terrific cast. Altogether, a most delightful way to escape for a bit and enjoy a good tale or two!",1360454400,,812,5.014814814814815

5067521,4,B0079ILHRG,Sgt Murdock's reserved no sense of humor super intellect and strong Catholic beliefs in a protestant city makes for some serious fun at sometimes his own expense.  Then add abeautiful uninhibited co worker that the very uptight serious murdock is take with and you have some very interesting dynamics. You will find his use of science and the development of modern forensics very interesting.  Highly recommend it for some light entertainment.,1360368000,,443,5.225352112676056

Inspector Murdoch's personal relationship with Julia, the pathologist who seems so well matched to him in many ways, seems thwarted by a series of almost unbelievable coincidences worthy of a Thomas Hardy novel.  These newer episodes in an absorbing series seem shorter, terser and tighter and the explorations of a teenaged sociopath and Canadian army volunteers during the Boer War being victimized by a British military figure in his experiments of chemically induced aggression seem all too possible.  I found the acting first rate.",1359331200,,808,5.5528455284552845

While set in Toronto, it has the flavor of the best BBC detective stories (Foyle, Morse, Campion, et al). The M.E. is a woman doctor --very forward thinking for the late 19th century It's always interesting when the inspector has to solve a crime without all the 21st century means to do so. Inspector Murdoch is an inventor and creates machines to help solve crimes. His use of ""finger marks"" is very forward thinking for the times. The cast is very likeable and not stereotypical at all.

5067558,5,B0079ILHRG,"Season four (4) of the Canadian television series ""Murdoch""  continues its excellence of intriguing ""murder/mystery"" presentations that are set in Toronto during the ""Victorian era"".  Detective/policeman Murdock (brilliantly played by Yannick Bisson) is an extremely shy but very ""forward looking"" sleuth that relies on and believes in the ""new"" (such as ""blood typing"" and finger-prints or finger marks as they were called) crime solving methods.

On four (4) discs in thirteen (13) episodes that run about an hour each the audience is privy to some very well written directed and fabulously acted but nasty ""Victorian crimes"".  The very nice detective Murdock, mentioned above, useing some very inventive methods, brilliantly solves the horrendous crimes.  He is surrounded, of course, by some very fascinating characters that help or hinder his crime-solving brilliance.

The ""supporting"" characters in Season four (4) are all wonderful and very enduring, to me. I simply adore Murdock's ""love interest"" Julia that is fabulously acted by Helene Joy.  Although the two are ""torn asunder"" this season the two still manage to help each other. Julia (as acted by Joy) is a delight--she brings a ""quick wit"" and extreme crime solving skills as a very knowledgeable pathologist to the series.

If you enjoy good well written and acted mysteries that are set in ""times gone by"", do purchase Series four (4) of ""Murdoch""; it is delightful.",1354924800,2,1434,5.314159292035399

These programs are clean and interesting as the plots deal with many different issues, I appreciate Murdoch's singleness of mind when solving a crime.
Of course the chemistry between Murdoch and Dr. Ogden dosen't hurt things either as well as the relationship between Murdock, Brackenridge & constable Crabtree which at times I find rather humorous.
The only thing I find sad is that the 5th season will be the final season of Murdoch Mysteries.

(the reason for 4 and not 5 stars!). Anyway, the plot and ending for season 4 was somewhat predictable since Murdoch has been doing his romantic dance with his love.

5067627,5,B0079ILHRG,"Detective Murdoch is like a Canadian Sherlock Holmes with a lively attractive cast and plenty of ""new"" science set in Toronto in the early 1900s. Murdoch refers to finger prints as 'finger marks' as they are only just beginning to be used in forensics. Characters from Tesla to Arther Conan Doyle show up with regularity and there is much adventure, mystery, great humor and a little romance thrown in for good measure. Each episode is a tiny morality play that can be quite thought provoking. There are some serious considerations on the values and mores of the time period and we can enjoy the very different perspectives while being thoroughly entertained. There are numerous 'take offs' like the ""Murdoch Identity"" which is an homage to the Borne Identity and ""Mild Mild West"" for ""Wild Wild West"" in which we can observe early scientific discoveries we now take for granted. I highly recommend this series to anyone with a curious mind who enjoys period pieces, science, humor and all round good entertainment.",1345248000,,1015,4.941520467836257

Those seasons were afflicted with a kind of cutesiness -- oh, look, he's inventing that -- and while it was a little interesting, it did make me want to gag from time to time. It was the historical setting and background that kept me interested. Season 4 has improved considerably. The plots are tighter and more interesting, and the characters have developed. The dialogue is still a little stilted, but hey -- you can't have everything, hence four stars. The chief inspector is becoming a better character, as is Murdoch's sidekick George. We'll see how they resolve the romance between Murdoch and the Doctor -- it can't drag on forever, especially considering the circumstances at the end of the last episode. All in all, if you've enjoyed any of the previous shows, I believe you'll enjoy these. Murdoch isn't Midsomer Murders or Foyles War, but how many shows are?

Plodding, slow, dull, boring, perhaps even a cure for insomnia? I've watched every show. Season 4 was the worst. I kept nodding off in the middle of each episode.

The romance between Murdoch and Ogden . . .  gone. Unless you count staring meaningfully at each other for 5 seconds of each episode.

Plus, Ogden's engaged now, don't you know? Surprise, huh? That was fast.  Too bad Murdoch, engagement ring in hand, missed the train that swept Ogden off to Buffalo at the end of Season 3. And . . .  this may just be me, but I probably would have caught the next one.

So, after suffering through episodes like the Love Bandit, (and note to production company: really? really? really? I hope you weren't expecting me not to know who the bandit was within one second of hearing his voice. Plus, the height thing kinda gave it away too), Vampire on the loose(not), Nuns on the Run, (this episode you meet Murdoch's sister, who, in the span of 45 minutes goes from icy to dicey to making Murdoch cry(and no, as interesting as it sounds . . . it wasn't) and then the fatal last episode . . . well, fatal as in I won't be buying the 5th season, because instead of missing the train this time, Murdoch misses a wedding. Whose wedding you may ask?  Well, Ogden's of course. (And this after she leaves a note for Murdoch telling him if he'd only show up at the altar before she takes her vows, she'd jilt her fiancee.  I know, right?)  Well, ok, he might have missed the wedding because he was busy turning in his badge. Duty first. Romance last.

The whole theme of Season 4? DUTY, DUTY, DUTY!(work, work, work)  For me, that was boring, boring, boring. Even Murdoch's sidekick, what's his name, was dull. Always talking about his book. They never gave him an interesting story line.  No, instead they gave it to the Chief. He decides to run for alderman. Ok, hit me over the head with a bat right now. That lasted about six episodes.

Not worth $41.00.  Unless you need a sleep aid.",1343001600,,2030,4.433962264150943

This being said I was disappointed in the last episode, but I do anticipate the next series",1339459200,,333,4.842105263157895
5067635,5,B0079ILHRG,"I have purchased all of Murdoch Mysteries 1 thru 4 that have been put on DVD. I am whole heartedly with the majority of the people that have reviewed this item and am sorry that Season 5 will be the last in this series. I think this series is fantastic and would like to see more of it. I am sorry that the Canadian station that puts this out doesn't think people want to see a series such as this but they are wrong. I hope another Canadian station would pick this series up.

I like a few other series that are on TV but there is so much violence and this is a refreshing change. Goodbye Murdoch after this summer and will purchase the last season when it finally comes out.",1339286400,,676,4.121212121212121
