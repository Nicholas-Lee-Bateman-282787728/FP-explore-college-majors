patrick swayne play a good role with his kids. But the kids were driving him insane. This movie deathly need to come on dvd it would be a better picture and better sound. The dvd makers need to create a version of this movie fast hopefully it should come out this year or next year that will be will good if it come out between that time. When it come's out I'll will be happy.",1030406400,5,502,3.98019801980198
1850852,4,B00008L3TK,"Mr. Patrick Swayze has done some interesting films, but here he is strangely vulnerable but at the same time comfortable and okay with himself.

I do tend to mix this film up in my mind with ""Distant Cousins"" also with Brian Bonsall (who I think is one of the finest pieces of little-boy actor ass on the market in the 1990s) but Patrick carries the film exceeding well as a man who tries to do the right thing but somehow becomes a victim of himself, ultimately deciding that showing his children that doing the right thing and being a good person is best, even at the expense of his personal freedom which he demonstrates at the end.  The children come away with a decent, loving and caring Dad and Patrick realizes that he can continue to go straight because he has these children who love him deeply and unconditionally in spite of his flaws.  A solid, well-written and acted film.",1489276800,,885,4.51875

1850899,3,B00008L3TK,I didn't really fine this very funny or even good. This is one of Patrick's worse movie that I have seen that he made. He is a crook and his two kids. He tries to do this heist and tries to push his kids off on everyone. He end up taking them with him and one thing after another happens. In the end he ends up going back to prison for two years. I just didn't like this movie and I'm a big fan of Patrick's.,1410220800,,408,3.755813953488372

1850914,5,B00008L3TK,"Patrick Swayze plays Jack Charles a criminal who wants to pull off one major crime for once in his small time career, until one rainy night after he sees a gypsy he gets an unexpected visitor, his estranged teenaged daughter. She recounts the horrors she encountered at Bigelow Hall, an orphanage run by a corrupt official. Jack tells her he won't do anything making her beg to at least try to get custody of her brother so she and him can escape, the court denies the petition and she convinces him to watch the compound to discover his daughter was telling the truth. Enraged Jack takes the bus, frees his son and a pregnant girl making the warden swallow the key. He takes them to Las Vegas where his mother lives only to learn she has no intrest in raising his children, and they leave. Meanwhile on their way to New Orleans Jack is forced to learn things about his children, such as their hardships, hopes, ambitions, heart-breaks, and dreams. He also learns why the warden wants his daughter back, because she could get him locked up for child molestation. In the end he learns that no matter what he's about, no matter what he says or does they are still his children and he's still their father. A very good family film.",1377734400,,1228,4.511210762331839

1850917,4,B00008L3TK,"What can I say, I get a kick out of this movie.  Yeah it is absurd in some ways and the story is somewhat predictable, if you like the ""Smoky and the Bandit"" style you will like this.  It stars Patrick Swayze as a tough convict who kidnapps his own kids from a dasterdly Foster Care Center in rout to ""The Big Final Score"" and then the mayhem begins.  Also in the cast is a young Halle Berry as a newspaper writer trying to help Swayze, Sabrina Lloyd (Sliders), and Brian Bonsell (Whose The Boss) as the unrully kids.  There is plenty of car chases, twists and turns, and laughs as this old school cross country chase movie from 1993.",1358553600,4,634,4.258333333333334

I was super happy when I finally put my thinking cap on and searched Amazon! They had a good variety of new and used formats to choose from. This movie is mostly family friendly and has a little bit of everything to offer. It will make you laugh, cry, and hang on to the edge of your seat.",1315526400,2,425,4.195121951219512

1850939,2,B00008L3TK,"This movie is offensive and probably would be beyond hurtful to children actually caught up in our foster/adoption system.  However, the biggest issue this film has is that it is totally boring.  Although the script was written with an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink mentality it fails to capture the interest of child or adult.",1156723200,3,329,5.431372549019608
1850940,3,B00008L3TK,"Ah, what could have been?  Interesting premise: 2 kids in foster care/reform school (?) break out to find real dad (Patrick Swayze) to take them across the country to New Orleans.  Real dad turns out to be a con artist one step ahead of the law and some bad guys.  Movie then disintegrates into bad chase movie punctuated by dysfunctional family squabbling as dad doesn't really want anything to do with kids.  Meanwhile there's a plot about abuses going on at the state children's facility and a reporter (Halle Berry) who's doing an investigation, and covering their cross-country flight (which has been labeled a kidnapping).  Much confusion later, kids eventually reunite with Dad.  Crappy dialogue abounds, and Swayze chews up the scenery as an over-the-hill rocker/con man suddenly saddled with a teenage daughter and a younger son.  Josh Lucas has a cameo role (one of his first movies) as the daughter's object of affection; he plays a college intern who befriended her at the facility and she mistakenly confuses his friendship with love, and he just happens to live in New Orleans...so this is really why the girl wants to go there.  Sabrina Lloyd of Sliders plays the girl, but I can't remember any of the characters' names; that should tell you something.",1141948800,4,1267,4.915492957746479
