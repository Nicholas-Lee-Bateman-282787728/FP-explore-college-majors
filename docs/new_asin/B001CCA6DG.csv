3507659,2,B001CCA6DG,"I bought this DVD on heavy recommendations... and must now go beat my friends unmercifully. This film illuminates a classic truth: ""Just because you CAN do something, doesn't mean you SHOULD do something"". The director goes crazy with the stop-motion and wire effects... and ends up with a boring compilation of one mess after another. I do mean ""mess"". If this achieved ""cult"" status, then all I can say is that would-be cultists are scraping by on some lean fare!

I'm sure the director is trying to say something here about a gay man's feelings of isolation in society and disenfranchisement... and perhaps the subtitles didn't help any... but this was simply his love affair with (SUPREMELY dated) special effects work. Nothing more. I swear, I don't even think this was very good EFX work for the time period in which it was made. I remember amatuer stop motion work from the 70s on public access channels that looked more interesting than this stuff.

Oh, and I don't think I've ever seen a Japanese man's mouth open wide in a rictus of shock/horror/fear so often in a movie before. This was the actor trying to emote, obviously, but ended up looking nothing more than ridiculous.

After all the urgings I received to get this movie, I thought it might well become a gem of my library. Instead it goes to the bottom of the barrel.

Yes, I ""got it"" alright. I simply didn't think ""it"" was worth much at all.",1184716800,,1412,4.636
3507660,5,B001CCA6DG,"This movie is just cool to watch - and hear! Heavy, industrial music and sound effects, black and white, guaranteed to put you 'in a metal mood'. After you've seen it, you won't be able to get certain images out of your head. Don't spend too much time trying to figure out the ""plot"" (or lack of it..), just allow yourself to be amazed, freaked out and sucked in by this trippy, crazy, horrific little gem.",1184025600,,406,4.355263157894737
3507661,5,B001CCA6DG,"This was a very difficult film for me to watch, and I would not recommend it for the faint of heart or those that are not able to objectify films with intense amoral visual imagery.  I believe that the film is saying something important, but I've never been able to say precisely what.  The film maker has a real talent for letting us stroll through some of his deeper inner states.  Andre Tarkovsky is the only other film maker that I've ever seen do a better job of this, and its hard to compare the two because their styles are very different.  I first saw this film on VHS from a rental store in Lincoln, NE about ten years ago.  About three years ago as I was trying to describe it to a film-afficiando friend of mine, I got curous about seeing it again, hopefully now on DVD.  Fortunately I was able to find it and the exprience was vastly improved seeing it from a good transfer to DVD.  For film buffs with an eye toward unique visual artistry, I would recommend this very gritty art-film without hesitation.",1171670400,,1016,4.372340425531915
3507662,4,B001CCA6DG,"As a fan of original quality films - and a hater of pretentious arthouse trash - I'm concerned about the constant references to David Lynch's Eraserhead here.  Yes, both Tetsuo and Eraserhead are weird films shot in black-and-white.  But after that, the similarities end.  Instead, let's run down the differences:

Tetsuo = kinetic, interesting, good acting, solid special effects, understandable, satisfying, and engaging

Eraserhead = slow, boring, bad acting, horrible special effects, insoluble by design, pretentious, and annoying

Shinya Tsukamoto made Tetsuo as a kinetic, interesting, and engaging film.  The opening sequence immediately grabs the viewer, and the female flesh-metal zombie scene - a classic horror sequence in its own right - basically earns the viewer's attention for the rest of the film.  David Lynch made Eraserhead as a slow, boring, and annoying film.  The opening sequence is nothing short of irritating, and after 30 minutes the viewer's patience is taken to the limit when inflicted with such an utter waste of celluloid.  Some dude pops his head into space, only to then walk around aimlessly for minutes on end, encountering nothing of importance or interest.

The acting in Tetsuo, although over the top, is pretty good.  The actress who played the flesh-metal zombie was awesome, and the lead actor was admirable.  The acting in Eraserhead was abominable in every possible respect - I've seen trees that were less wooden.

The special effects in Tetsuo were used advantageously.  The camera work was sped up during the chase scenes and the stop-motion animation was fantastic, providing the metal effects.  Eraserhead mishandled almost everything.  The decapitation scene was pitifully fake, and the stop-motion was pointlessly wasted on - get this - a worm.

Finally, the difference that truly sets Tetsuo and Eraserhead apart is the simple fact that Tetsuo is mostly understandable, comprehensible, and thoughtful.  It's truly a revenge story that touches upon the relationships between man and machine (i.e., flesh and iron).  Eraserhead is just dim-witted - as if the filmmakers were shooting random takes that were thoughtlessly spliced together to the detriment of comprehensibility.

In the end, Lynch isn't even in Tsukamoto's class here.  Tsukamoto is a master who is excellent at balancing originality and entertainment while avoiding the pitfalls of pretentiousness and incomprehensible artistic nonsense.  Lynch is simply a hack who likes to make a film that only he can remotely understand because he doesn't bother to include the necessary communication to the viewer.  Perhaps he should have kept this tripe in his basement.  And perhaps the reviewers on this website could have refrained from drawing parallels between Tetsuo and Eraserhead.  It would have saved me 90 minutes of torture.

The fact that Tsukamoto succeeded in making the outrageous endeavor known as Tetsuo entertaining is simply amazing, but experiencing Lynch's dismal failure known as Eraserhead adds a great deal of emphasis.  Movies that are both crazy and entertaining are difficult to make.  So please stop comparing a master with a hack, lest you morph into a flesh-metal zombie.",1166054400,,3208,5.372745490981964
3507663,1,B001CCA6DG,"This movie was just a long, boring art film.

It was more of a series of scences and montages, as opposed to a plot and story.

If your a film student, or like pretentious art films, then you will probably enjoy this one, its ripe with imagery you can descontruct, and compare to fritz lang.

3507664,3,B001CCA6DG,"This bizarre film is disturbing, troubling me that the main character is in an irriversible predicament. Wishing he could shed the metal that kept growing on his body, I found meaning in his painful transformation. Seeing that his pain never went away and that he desired to continue pushing the 'normal' world away left me without the typical 'happy ending.' There is meaning to the madness of this film, but there are several scenes that will stay with you after turning off the DVD player.",1147132800,,492,4.8
3507665,3,B001CCA6DG,"I'm always on the hunt for bizzare, weird, perhaps even avant-garde filmmaking and very rarely do I ever encounter it. Thankfully there is Tetsuo - The Iron Man, a film that could have only been made in Japan since it caters so well to Japanese fears and sensibilities like the mechanization of society and twisted mutations of the human form with technology.

An easy Western example that could compare to Tetsuo would of course be the world of David Cronenberg, especially his films like Videodrome, The Fly, Existenz, etc. However things are quite different in Tetsuo, because director Shinya Tsukamoto does not rely much on any narrative coherence unlike Cronenberg who usually has a strong narrative core underneath. Cronenberg also goes for a heavy psycho-sexual vibe in his work while Tsukamoto relies on some truly weird, almost homo-erotic elements in his Tetsuo movies, especially so in this first one. Let's just say that these characters don't understand women very well. The whole idea of the world enslaved by tech is a theme very much at the forefront of this film, like as if the human soul has abandoned the body completely and the body therefore is engulfed in a war with the technology surrounding it. This is a terrific film to analyse for pseudo-intellectuals and they might tend to make more of it than there really is, ( don't be like them, just enjoy the visual mayhem! )

This first Tetsuo is far more inventive than the sequel, but overall starts to wear pretty thin as the running time moves by. There is so little narrative as I said that it may very well be too boring for the average movie fan. But if you're adventuresome and are looking for a new visual experience, you're certain to find it here. The black and white cinematography is one of the many alluring elements to be found here and the ending is quite insane. I might get around to adding this movie to my collection in the future.",1145750400,,1922,4.717261904761905

The music brings alot more intensity to the movie, as soon as the film begins youll have an idea of what your getting your self into. If there is any true meaning too this movie I wouldnt want to know because its what you expierence while watching Tetsuo that will get you to either love it or hate it. If you like your cinema beyond normal and totally out there you cant miss this.",1145059200,,627,4.105691056910569

3507668,4,B001CCA6DG,"This film is either hated by those who simply ""don't get it"", or loved by self-proclaimed film buffs and art students. The film is a horror film about a man who cuts himself with an electric razor, and through a completely bizzare infection, starts to become metal himself. This ""infection"" also causes him to have frightening nightmares that allude to him being a homosexual, and homosexuality is the underlying message. ""Tetsuo"" is a film that clearly has something to say, but it delivers the message poorly. Metal and Homosexuality have little to no metaphorical connection, so it really becomes confusing. Later, this man has to confront another man who he hit with a car, and infected him with the same ailment, and that man is the physical symbol for becoming open with his sexuality. The ending actually gives a message that homosexuality is destroying society, or will destroy it. All in all, it's decent as a thriller, but as an art film, it falls flat.",1139011200,,963,4.842424242424243
3507669,2,B001CCA6DG,"A man morphs into metal...that is all I can comprehend.

There are truly some interesting scenes in here and the first half hour feels like it was pulled straight out of my nightmares (some of my more stylish ones), but the rest of the movie really has no direction or at least with all the stop animation, I couldn't tell. It's a short film, only a little over an hour, but by the time it was over, I felt like I had just gotten through watching Gone With the Wind.

For the gorehounds out there, there's very little gore in this movie (with the exception of one or 2 scenes), but there is much to compensate. For fans of dubbing: My friends and I were appalled at the lack of the dubbing option on the special edition (English subtitles only) until we discovered that there is very little dialogue.",1135900800,,800,4.3624161073825505
3507670,5,B001CCA6DG,"WARNING: In the last paragraph I reveal the film's ending

I am usually annoyed by ""this"" meets ""that"" comparisons. But in this case I find it appropriate.

If you struggle with films outside the mainstream, then this film is not for you. It seeks to redefine the vanguard of film-as-art (rather than sheer entertainment) and lies far, far from the mainstream (art tends to prod boundaries, challenge norms, and stimulate emotions/intellect whereas entertainment just stimulates).

This film is so far removed from normalcy; I am having trouble forming an opinion about it. What is this movie about?!? Perhaps it is a comment regarding the degradation of the human psyche brought on by a self-perpetuating industrial modernization. Maybe the protagonist is coming to terms with his homosexuality. I think the latter a more viable interpretation. I would imagine the emotions depicted in this film are the very emotions a gay person would feel in a society where the stringent mores established over 2 centuries ago and covertly enforced via the fear of disrespect and banishment are just now starting to relax...slightly.

I have found that the vanguard is more fully appreciated by those steeped in a genre. Thus, I'll leave interpretation or criticism to pundits. I will say this, this film exhibits a strong parallel with zombie films.

Rather than interpret or assess this film I offer my impressions:

Character's bodies are quivering sweaty and always in pain...constantly in motion. Morphing into the jumbled mass of rusty and discarded metal pieces that comprise their environment.

Spaces are claustrophobic, dilapidated, lonely, and abandoned industrial factories lit by segregated fixtures of florescent white light. Shadows engulf whole objects rather than giving shape or softness to figures. All scenes shot outside or in any un-cramped area are sped up removing any sense of relief from claustrophobia in these potentially spacious shots.

Horrific metal phalli protrude in sexual rage, penetrating, torturing, killing.

The relationships between all the characters are typified by violence and/or sexual rage.

Tetsuo's body is eventually overcome by metal and is physically and psychically joined with the protagonist who's quest is to convert all humans to maniacal human-shaped metal creatures. ""Through our love, the whole world will become metal. Mwuhahahahaha!""",1133827200,,2383,5.451086956521739
3507671,2,B001CCA6DG,"my somewhat lower rating is for the entire package - my perception of the total value of this release. I must admit i have kinda an issue with this being refered to as a ""special edition"".I was quite disappointed in the (lack) of supplements. You get the movie itself(just barely over an hour long),a few excerpts(?) from other Tsukamoto's films and some trailers for other Tartan ""asia extreme"" titles. You also get some basic text on the director and a few actors. The outer slipcase is cool,but is it worth an additional 10 bucks?

  Bottom line,I feel that this is an important film,worthy of a special edition ""treatment"" but got short changed here. Even a brief interview with Shinya woulda been appreciated!",1132012800,,714,4.836065573770492

3507673,2,B001CCA6DG,"The rating is for the lousy transfer of the new Tartan DVD release.  TETSUO is one of my top-ten favorite movies of all time.  Purchasing this new release represented a quadruple-dip on this title.  First was a bootleg vhs tape back in the early 90's followed by the official Fox-Lorber tape, then the first DVD.  The main reason, other than my love for the movie, for buying again was for the new 5.1 sound mix because TETSUO has a great soundtrack.  Tartan did a great job with the remix.  I love it!  It's really impressive in my home theater.  But the image doesn't live up to the audio, especially projected on my big screen.  It looks like they just did a cheap transfer of the PAL master (Tartan is a UK company, I believe) to NTSC because it's riddled with artifacts like ghosting during fast movements (there's a lot of that in this film) and the image is very soft and contrasty.  The old Fox-Lorber DVD from '98 has more image detail, especially in shadows, and none of that ugly ghosting.  I assumed that since it's 2005 now and most DVD companies have kept up with the state of the art, knowing that audiences are more discriminating about audio/video quality, Tartan would live up to our expectations.  But, no.

I see that there are several sellers dumping their old discs here at Amazon.  I recommend that you just pick up one of those rather than Tartan's shameless release...",1123804800,,1393,4.564516129032258
3507674,5,B001CCA6DG,"""Tetsuo: The Iron Man"" is one hell of a strange film. Produced in 1988 in Japan, The film is directed and constructed from the imagination of Shinya Tsukamoto the director of such bizarre films such as ""A Snake of June"" and ""Vital"".  Tetsuo: The Iron Man"" can best be described as a Japanese film that would best resemble the work of David Lynch's film ""Eraserhead"".  Although the stories are completely different from another ""Tetsuo"" is shot much like ""Eraserhead"" and is shot on a very similar if not the same kind of black and white film stock.

  To compare ""Tetsuo"" anymore to ""Eraserhead"" however would be wrong, as both stories are a lot different from one another.  I found ""Tetsuo"" not to be as shocking as ""Eraserhead"" however it does have plenty of gore and weirdness to go around. Oh and it is in fact a shocking film, but not as effective on the human psyche as ""Eraserhead"" is. ""Tetsuo"" does in fact have some very strange and bizarre sexual content such as a penis turning into a ""killer drill penis"" and a strange sex scene involving some other weird stuff, as well as plenty of other sexual references.

  The overall style and the uncomfortable feeling I got from watching this film is what appealed to me.  It's at times a hard film to follow, but overall the plot is pretty simple.  There is a lot of detail in the film however that must be pay attention too in order to really appreciate  the artistic merit of the picture.  The acting in the film is very good, and thank god that actors did pull off their roles well as the film probably would of suffered if they didn't. I also have plenty of praise for director  Shinya Tsukamoto, whom managed to pull off this bizarre story and help his actors and crew get though it.

  Effects wise, this film mush have been a bitch to shoot, I mean were talking a lot of stop motion photography, wrapping people up in all kind of metal and throwing tons of make-up and prosthetics on, it must of been a real pain in the ass to pull off. But in the end they did it and the great special effects are what make this film.

  Overall I really enjoyed ""Tetsuo: The Iron Man"". I can't recommend this film to everyone, however if you into David Lynch films or David Cronenberg films, you'll probably enjoy this flick. It's a must for all Asian Horror Fans to add this DVD to their collection.",1122681600,,2347,4.4392523364485985
3507675,5,B001CCA6DG,"If you stop and think about it, we have a lot of little things to be thankful for. For instance, it's a good thing that:

1) Snow and rain isn't made of flesh-dissolving Acid;

2) Spiders don't routinely grow to be larger than a Shetland pony;

3) Flies don't spread Ebola Zaire or Black Plague;

4) Mosquitoes don't inject you full of bleach;

5) Nothing even approximating what befalls the hapless young Tokyo businessman hero of Tetsuo: The Iron Man can happen to you during the course of a typical business day. Breathe a deep sigh of relief, right now.

""Tetsuo"" is that rarest of cinematic treats: a film so closely approximating and approaching the realm of pure Nightmare that it is, perhaps, easier to appreciate than to enjoy. In that regard it shares much in common with other lapidary treats of pure warped weirdness, like Lynch's ""Eraserhead"" (which it most strongly suggests) and Elias Merhige's ""Begotten"".

But what is ""Tetsuo"" about? We first glimpse the Metals Fetishist (played by director Shinya Tsukamoto)traipsing back to his lair in what appears to be a derelict warehouse, or junkyard. He produces what appears to be a gearshaft, slices open his leg, and begins to insert the shaft into the raw, gaping muscle; then he sews up the wound.

Time passes, and then---surprise!---on taking off the bandages, our Fetishist discovers the wound to be gangrenous, rotten, infested with maggots. He freaks! He bolts into the street! He is infused with unearthly speed (or so he thinks)! He runs out into an intersection and gets nailed by a car and (after the cheesy musical interlude which made me vaguely queasy) gets liberally splattered all over the street.

At that point the focus and physical moorings of the flick shifts dramatically: to the hapless businessman (played pitch-perfect by Tomorowo Taguchi), his mistress (Kei Fujiwara, uncomfortably hot in a role that should be anything but), and a bespectacled, doomed woman on the subway.

Playing like a kind of misbegotten spawn of ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Metropolis"", and ""The Thing"", the nightmarish, vertigo-inducing balance of ""Tetsuo"" is absorbed with the issue of the Man-Machine, the nexus between flesh and technology, as the apartment of our nebbishy protagonist becomes an abbatoir of diseased flesh and fecund metal.

To say anything more would be unfair to the movie and its unwitting new viewers, but it is worth noting that Tsukamoto plots the infernal union of flesh and iron along two graphs: fecundity and speed. As the damned Fetishist at last understood, the steel quickly overwhelms the feeble flesh housing the brain's finer impulses, but---perhaps parasitically---provides the flesh with speed and strength and prodigiousness denied to the merely mortal.

""Tetsuo"", made in 1988 on a shoestring budget, is a movie that begs to be seen, but it isn't one that is necessarily enjoyable: I can appreciate what Tsukamoto was attempting, and the scale of the achievement---given the budgetary and technical limitations---is astounding. But be warned: as our own age lumbers into a world where flesh and machine truly synthesize, ""Tetsuo"" appears prophetic, and is certainly not for the squeamish.

Here be nightmares.

3507676,5,B001CCA6DG,"This dvd is fantastic everybody sshould own it,and it,s  somewhere between a modern-day nightmare and a techno-fetishist's ultimate fantasy, this extraordinary film from Shinya Tsukamoto (Vital, A Snake of June) caused a cult sensation when first released. As a young man gradually mutates into a metal-being, the film takes a surreal journey into a dark and disturbing world where self-inflicted body transformations and post-human women form the fabric of a strange new reality. Likened to the work of David Lynch and David Cronenberg, Tetsuo: The Ironman molds explosive violence, bizarre imagery and jet-black humor into a cinematic experience like you've never seen, highly recommend it to my friends and family.",1116460800,,717,5.5181818181818185
3507677,4,B001CCA6DG,"One of my friends always talks about life having no inherent value. He claims that the only thing that makes life so special is its inherent complexity. This movie seems to paralell this thought, but take it into a different more dark direction.

A man has a nightmare (maybe not, reality and fantasy in this movie are about as interchangable as Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum) about metal growing out of the body of his lover, and she chases him down and subjects him to a metallic sexual humiliation, then when he wakes up the metal is coming up from him. Remembering a car accident that he was involved in seems to bring the metal closer to meaning, but not quite.

What does it mean? Anything? Some people believe that this movie is a metaphor for being a homosexual in Japan and the dehumanization that follows. Some people believe that the movie is about the increasing dependence that we have on technology and metal. Or perhaps it is about life and the fact that machines can do it all the same as we can, in fact we are pretty much machines. Maybe it was about plastic surgery and body alteration? This is only a fraction of the possible interpretations, but watching the film you can surely find some that nobody mentioned before.

The stop motion animation was annoying. Hate to say it, but it was. There was really little to no reason for it except for budgetary constraints, and I have seen it done better in 50s Sci-Fi movies. But apart from that the movie looked good. It might disturb some people, it might confuse others, but the grey, black and white scenes paralelled the colors of metal and the subject matter with poignant accuracy. The movie was hardly shocking for me, but to those with non-jaded eyes this can be pretty intense.

This is a movie worth seeing. Maybe just to say that you saw it, maybe just to remark to your friends on the lurid images, but maybe, just maybe to actually enjoy it and attempt to deconstruct its intricacies, because truly this movie can be enjoyed (understood I think is a better word here, some people who will like this movie might not enjoy it) on more levels than most schlock that come out now on video and DVD.",1116374400,,2169,4.525510204081633

 In Tetsuo by Shinya Tsukamoto, the body is taken over by iron. Again the question of sexuality is high on the agenda as is evident in the scene where you see a male sex organ shaped like a huge iron drill spinning ferociously, hinting that love in our day often consists in the realm of the senses generated by genitalia and that a man's sex organ is nothing but a machine in such a context. We are just as inorganic as the machines that surround us and the iron and metals that make up those machines. As the man slowly transforms into iron, he experiences excruciating pains, to which we have grown so much numb. It seems to me that Tsukamoto's primary concern is the recoverty of the body, which in his case is almost always expressed with the imagery of sex, violence and pain.",1077667200,,1042,4.572192513368984

Shinyo Tsukamoto uses fast cuts, weird camera angles, and the black-and-white film to great advantage in Tetsuo. Every frame is overloaded with detail, and the metallization of people in the movie is more a weird combination of tubes, wires, and cables than anything else. Visually, this movie is unique, and Chu Ishikawa's soundtrack fits it perfectly. You will just sit there, and say something like: whoa, what the heck is going on!!
Tetsuo II is completely different; hard to believe Tsukamoto also directed it. It is worth seeing only to fill in some of the holes the first movie leaves in the story. But unfortunately, the hyperkinetics and great visuals are completely gone.
I did not give Tetsuo 5 stars because of an overly graphic section about midway through the movie; it is a humorous section initially (you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it), but Tsukamoto takes it too far. Otherwise, Tetsuo is a great movie.",1061164800,,1189,4.828431372549019
3507685,4,B001CCA6DG,"this is a great cyberpunk sci-fi horror flick.  though rather short, the excitement and intensity is nonstop.  the soundtrack adds tension from the opening credits throughout the show.  if you are into alternative type, splatter punk movies that are twisted, this is a must see.  next to ""Possession"" and ""Wicked City,"" this is one of the stranger movies around.",1044921600,,362,5.084745762711864
3507686,2,B001CCA6DG,"What the director managed to accomplish with such a small budget is mindblowing, however this is one of those one-idea films which would have made a great short subject, but just doesn't have enough ideas or characterization to justify its actual length.
This film is open to a great deal of interpretation because it is so lacking in any real character development or clear motivations.  Psychotronic Magazine thinks it is some sort of message about ""salaryman"" (I assume Weldon means the mechanization of society).  Others see in it an analogy about a man accepting his homosexuality (which, given the rather obvious symbolism of the last scene, appears more accurate to me).  But really, it is little more than endless scenes of two guys merging with machines and constantly transforming into different configurations of metal and wire and struggling for dominance over each other as their wires, etc., merge with each other.  It is filled with memorable images, especially the disgusting (and, depending upon your interpretation, morally repugnant) scene of the one man (I'm not sure which of the two is Tetsuo!) killing his girlfriend in a very sexual manner (I suppose the purpose of this scene is to show him rejecting women, but it appears more to me like he is just deciding she's a mere sexual object for his own use).  Frankly, I think this film has much less depth than most people read into it and is little more than a gore film with one inventive idea played to death.
What little ""plot"" there is (especially the ending) is somewhat reminiscent of Cronenberg's Shivers (an ""all hail the new flesh"" sort of thing), but Shivers is vastly superior considering there are actually characters and plot development in it.  Get Shivers instead, which is brave enough to actually make its themes clear.
The only way I could bear sitting through Tetsuo again is to view it as a purely visual experience and just watch it in small clips for its interesting effects (so it doesn't become boring through repetition), but if I want to look at disturbing artwork, I'd much rather go to a Francis Bacon exhibition.",1025740800,,2113,4.888268156424581

3507688,5,B001CCA6DG,This is one of my all time favorites. This is the film that inspires me to make films. I keep going back to it over and over each time I see somthing new. This film blows Eraser head out of the water.,1022976000,,200,3.7857142857142856
3507689,4,B001CCA6DG,"First of all, let me state something that nobody seems to want to say explicitly; this is one unnerving movie with some of the most unpleasant scenes I've ever seen, and that includes Cronenberg.  Also, there's an undeniable homoerotic subtext to the whole thing (and I'm not inferring; it's pretty clear, despite the lousy subtitle job Image subcontracted out.)
As far as comparisons go, this is a lot like the work of Jan Svankmajer, in terms of effects and narrative feel (and I suspect Tsukamoto knows the work of Svankmajer well.)  But the material is about as far from Svankmajer's social concerns as you can get.
I don't claim to know Japanese society that well, but I DO know it wasn't (and still isn't) nearly as tolerant as the US, and ""Tetsuo"" is a strong reflection of that.  The main character is a man who is torn apart by guilt over a crime he has committed, and also for his failure to conform to societal standards.  He is terrified of women, and he also resents them (epitomized in two extremely gory and unnerving scenes.)  And because, one feels, that he's told that he's unnatural and inhuman, he BECOMES unnatural and inhuman, literally an iron man.
This is not a upbeat story; this is a story about a man who has destroyed himself and achieves the power to take the society that caused it down with him.  Even finding love isn't enough for him. This is a movie about a man who is twisted and warped by society, and who will destroy everyone thanks to that society.
Personally, I found it fascinating, but unless you've explored Jan Svankmajer, David Cronenberg, David Lynch, and others extensively, I would be careful about approaching this.  Put it this way; if you weren't bugged by ""Crash"" but found it interesting, ""Tetsuo"" won't be too much for you.",1010966400,,1777,4.676282051282051
3507690,4,B001CCA6DG,"let me start out by saying that most people should not see this movie or even try to. if you think that you can just turn it off when it gets disturbing and forget about it, you're sadly mistaken, because when you've seen just one sick part you'll be pretty revolted for a good amount of time even if you shut it off that second. this is only for people who enjoy art that is basically a shot at convention and a sort of revelry in surreal and disturbing imagery without necessarily needing a coherent or logical storyline, and if you're not among those people, stay far, faaaaaar away. for film students and people inclined to surrealistic/philosophical/absurdist art, this is an absolute necessity. the thing i loved about 'tetsuo' is that after the whole admittedly odd film, i came away with a feeling of having really aesthetically experienced something:a descent into the bizarre and the taboo that i felt concluded on a note of vitality and defiance that is touching. ""we can put an end to this...world!"", one of the 'metal men' screams to the other. it is not a pointless exercise in gore or depravity, but a frantic and urgent exhortation to fight against the dehumanization that is inevitable in a mechanistic, nightmarish, high-tech civilization. in a sense these two unfortunate victims of an insane and impersonal society do something positive with their horrendous fates, in that they set aside their petty personal battle and heroically turn what has destroyed and mutilated them against itself and thereby become more human than when they were both simply flesh and blood. of course, this is only my individual interpretation, but i feel pretty certain that the message of this movie is along those lines. one the other hand, i did feel some of the scenes were needlessly disgusting and that the director inadvertently made a lot of the movie so repugnant that what could have been a real, universally recognized cult classic will only be accessible to the toughest and most philosophically sensitive people out there, which are few indeed--too few for 'tetsuo' to ever gain even the slightest notoriety or communicate it's worthy message to the majority of viewers. even lynch, who i also have a great deal of admiration for, knows that while he can get away with a great deal of scenes that are utterly perverse and sadomasochistic because of his incredible flair for the surreal and mysterious, he has to let his viewers come up for air every once in awhile and take that unfortunate but absolutely necessary reversion to the mundane without which the subtlety indispensable to a great film is lost. but for those who love the artistic creation of really disturbing but beautifully artificial realities, this movie will be a gem and certainly a must buy. so in that sense, 'tetsuo' is one of the best movies of our time.",1006300800,,2839,4.843621399176954

I don't know what kind of audience the director is aiming at or what he's trying to prove, but man, whatever he wanted to do he must have done it well because this is also one of the most entertaining things on celluoid I've seen as well.  Clocking in at about 70 minutes, this movie doesn't waste it's time with nuisances like color, diagloge, or even a plot.  Here's what I picked up at least I think this is what's happening.  There's this crazy nut and he puts a screw through his leg or something and decides to talk a walk.  (Best time to take a walk is right after you stab yourself in the leg)  So he walks around and gets run over by another guy.  The guy who killed him doesn't do much, apparently this is acceptable in Japan.  But he probably wishes that he didn't do that now, because he now has...a metal whisker.  I kid you not, his ironic payback is A METAL WHISKER! WHY?  But on a more important note, what do you do when you have a metal whisker? Pull on it, of course.  That wasn't a good thing cause now he's squirting blood all over the place.  When will those nutty japs ever learn? This doesn't effect him too much, he doesn't even care when some lady on a subway turns into a metallic zombie for no apparent reason and trys to get with him. No, the tale isn't over yet, next thing he knows his wang is replaced by a giant rotating screw.  Naturally, this pleases his wife and she wants to test it out immediately.  Big mistake, cause know she's squirting blood all over the place.  Them japs, them crazy, crazy japs.  But blood isn't enough, she also needs to turn into cottage cheese and form into that crazy metal zombie.  OOOOKAY!

3507696,3,B001CCA6DG,"Do androids dream of electric sheep? Maybe. This, then, could be their nightmare. Or what passes for a bad peyote trip for them. Ferric and feral, Shinya Tsukamoto's 1989 debut, where an unassuming Salaryman (Tomoro taguchi) mutates into a bio-mechanical living weapon,  is a fractured-reality must-see. Set in a neither-here-nor-there Japan only a fever-wracked noggin could hallucinate, this isn't Japan as hypermodern sci-fic megacity. Rather, it's blighted underside.  Its scummy industrial backdrop is all derelict factories, corroded steel, tarnished chrome and frayed cordite. Lynchian deja vu might set in but ""Tetsuo: The Iron Man"" exists in its own techno-erotic purgatory, and one that gets farther under the skin than ""Eraserhead"" ever did.  Tsukamoto's closer kindred spirit seems to be David Cronenberg. Tsukamoto  seems taken  with the same apocalyptic neuroses as Cronenberg : men terrorized by their own malfunctioning bodies, the evolutionary possibilities of changeling flesh. But Tsukamoto's far less arctic and cerebral. Basic instinct confronts the abstract by assigning order to the chaos. And the retina-scorching transmutations can get so out-there, you might want to believe they're metaphors: for the dichotomy between the organic and the inorganic,a familiar tsukamoto kink. Or maybe it's all a blackly comic send-up of the mechanisation of the social psyche. But such rationalizations neither deepen the mystery nor heighten the rush. Tsukamoto doesn't really want us to decipher the enigmas. It's the text, not the subtext, that matters. He's pushing a different kick: the pure, twisted and unsettling sensation of watching the Everyday splinter into the irrational, pulling us into a state of anxiety whose very lack of balance is its chief psychoactive. It's the adrenaline of entropy, the poetry of confusion. It's blood and energy, full-on. And Tsukamoto's arsenal certainly has explosive. It's like fragmentation grenades to the brain pan. It's vast. It's hyper. It's ultraviolet and futuristic. But.  Tsukamoto , soon enough, ODs on his own momentum. Watching ""Tetsuo:The Iron man"" in one go can get as exhausting as memorizing Calculus equations while doing High-Impact Aerobics on a ton of caffeine. Everything verges on sensory overload in the final 4th. Shortcircuit. Then you crash.  But before that happens, you'd have gotten your chromosomes mad-scrambled by what is still , ten years or so down the line,  one of the most unforgettable chunks of weird science, death-metal nihilism and low-tech rage against the machine.",973036800,,2564,5.556410256410256

Instead, the high-contrast, starkly  grey-and-black imagery passes at different speeds, with occasional pauses  for single words of dialogue (mainly 'OOF!' and 'USSS!'). There's a really  nasty sex scene too, one that will make you wince and laugh out loud at the  same time.

3507700,5,B001CCA6DG,"Director Shinya Tsukamoto's TETSUO is the cult movie by excellence. Preceded by a hellish reputation, invisible in most countries and presented only to a few happy ones in one or two festivals, TETSUO is now in the  Image DVD catalog. And, if you dare to, it's worth multiple  viewings.
Shot in black and white, this movie is not the kind of horror  movie we are accustomed to nowadays. If you can stand the first five  minutes of the movie, you won't be able to quit the room during 67 minutes  ! The argument of TETSUO is quite simple : we will see how an ordinary man  is going to change himself little by little into an iron monster.  Vengeance, alien invasion, dream could be the cause of this horrible  transformation.
The rythm is suffocating, not because of a Michael  Bay-like hysterical editing but rather because Shinya Tsukamoto knows  perfectly well that very often the rythm of a movie is the result of the  anxiety of the audience that anticipates the scenes before they happen on  the screen.
I would say that if you have appreciated PI, you'll love  TETSUO. And if you are a movie lover, you'll have a great time to count the  very discreet homages to classic horror movies or themes that Shinya  Tsukamoto has hidden in his film. At last, the animated parts of the movie  are surprisingly well integrated.

The use of biotechnical persons was different and interesting, but too random with arts that didn't even make sense.  5 if i coulda been on the edge of my seat, if you buy it, have a snack ready.",1221868800,,304,3.8870967741935485
8286562,5,B001CCA6DG,"This film is absolutely brilliant. Tsukamoto's genius shines through this gritty and rusted masterpiece. His way of filming is unique and beautiful to say the least. There is also some really impressive stop motion animation to be seen in this film, though its fairly brief. The sound track is also a masterpiece, if you can find it on cd, i highly recommend it.
