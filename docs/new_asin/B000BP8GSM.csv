2434722,5,B000BP8GSM,"Dragonwyck, a Gothic romance based on the novel by Anya Seton, stars Vincent Price and Gene Tierney. Price plays Nicholas Van Ryn, an aristocratic distant relative of Miranda Wells (Tierney), a farm girl who has strict religious upbringings. When Miranda is invited to go to meet Nicholas Van Ryn, it sparks romantic and dreamy aspirations for the girl, being spellbound and enticed by the world outside her simple Connecticut life. After Miranda's father (Walter Huston) meets with Nicholas Van Ryn, he gives his consent, albeit somewhat reluctantly as he and Van Ryn have vastly different ideas land and politics. Nicholas is captivated by Miranda's beauty, and the two set off to Dragonwyck castle. Once there, Miranda discovers that the Van Ryns are an odd couple to say the least. Nicholas is aloof from both his gluttonous wife and his little girl, Katrine, and he spends hours up in the tower room alone. A dark ambience exists within the walls of Dragonwyck, which Miranda can feel almost immediately. There hangs a portrait of Nicholas' great grandmother, which captures Miranda's attention, as it seems to have eyes on all who visit the room. The servant woman has her theories about apparitions and unhappy tidings within the house, and gives an ominous warning to Miranda on her first night there: ""And one day you'll wish with all your heart you'd never come to Dragonwyck."" After the mysterious death of Mrs. Van Ryn, Miranda later comes back to marry Nicholas. Now she begins to see things as they truly are in the creepy mansion, and the ugly, true character of Nicholas, and his motives become apparent.

  Although a bit overly melodramatic at times, this film is made in the true Gothic form: you have a nave girl going to a dark and mysterious castle, a deceptive villain, murder, family secrets, seeming apparitions and ghosts, a general creepy atmosphere and unsettling music score. Price, as Nicholas, takes over the film during the last parts, where his seemingly gentlemanly persona begins to evaporate and turn chilling, desperate, and maddening.

  As far as extras, there is a fascinating background documentary ""A House of Secrets"", which examines the novel that the film was based on as well as methods used by director Joseph Mankiewicz to bring this classic to life. Probably the most insightful aspect of this documentary is just learning about Vincent Price's work in preparing for the role. Also included are radio productions of Dragonwyck, performed by the two stars. Price and Tierney have great onscreen chemistry, so it is easy to see why they worked together four times on screen.

  I only recently discovered this gem. This is a definite keeper for Vincent Price fans, or those who enjoy films done in the Gothic tradition. The extras also are worth the price.",1279324800,12,2803,4.985010706638116

2434724,5,B000BP8GSM,"""And one day you'll wish with all your heart, you'd never come to Dragonwyck.""

Joseph L. Mankiewicz gave Dragonwyck a dreamlike mood so intoxicating those who had read Anya Seton's wildly popular second novel in The Ladies Home Journal were willing to forgive a few important changes and flocked to see it. Viewers were held spellbound from the moment the lights went down and Seton's darkly romantic story came alive with its gothic atmosphere and exquisite period settings. Beautifully photographed by Arthur Miller and with a magnificent score by Alfred Newman, Vincent Price and Gene Tierney became Miranda and Nicholas from Seton's book. Price even dropped thirty pounds to mirror the character Seton had written. Tierney's gorgeous elegance and youth played perfectly against Price's aristocratic countenance in this wonderful mood piece.

Ernst Lubitsch was slated to direct but a massive heart attack relegated him to producer only. His meddling proved too much for Mankiewick, however, and Lubitsch, whose talents lent themselves better to films requiring sophistication more than mood had his name removed from the final cut. Movie lovers today will find it hard to argue with Mankiewicz's arguments or filmmaking decisions, as it is an enthralling example of the genre. Walter Huston, Glenn Langan, Anne Revere, Spring Byington, Connie Marshall, and a young Henry Morgan, long before Dragnet, round out a fabulous cast. Included for fans are two separate radio versions of Dragonwyck to enjoy; one with Tierney and Price; the other with Price and Teresa Wright. Watching Dragonwyck will no doubt prompt many to wish the book were included also.

Miranda is a young girl living on the family farm in Greenwich not big enough to hold her dreams. Her father has misgivings about letting her go to the Hudson at the request of Nicholas Van Ryn to care for his daughter. A relative who is barely so in any sense of the word,  Nicholas and Dragonwyck seem a faraway but lovely dream to Miranda. When she convinces her devout father it is divine direction, he reluctantly acquiesces, but she will discover in time that some things in life are best kept as dreams. On a romantic steamboat trip across the Hudson to the grand and imposing Dragonwyck the viewer can feel the attraction between them. All charm and elegance at first, Miranda falls under her so called cousin's spell and the life of gentry. It would be grandly romantic if Nocholas was not already married.

A wife who only wants Nicholas to love her and a wonderful daughter starving for affection yet spurned because she cannot carry on the Ryn name would be disturbing enough on their own, but time will reveal an eerie musical presence at Dragonwyck only little Katrina and Nicholas can hear. Miranda is confronted by snobbery as well, but takes comfort in the acceptance of Nicholas. Dr. Turner cares for Miranda from a distance while opposing Nicholas for his treatment of those who farm his land but will never own it. A death which seems suspicious and a tower overlooking the Catskills will bring things to a head and make for a fine ending, filled with promise, as though Miranda has woken from a bad dream.

A gothic romance and period piece intensely lovely in its presentation, augmented by fine performances, this is a film classic in every sense. For fans of this genre, a must see film.",1270425600,9,3369,4.953982300884956

2434727,5,B000BP8GSM,"This smoldering, sensual Gothic combines a haunting score, moody atmosphere, and an almost hypnotic early performance by a young, good-looking Vincent Price.

Innocent country girl Miranda (Gene Tierney) is astonished to find she is kin to the rich Van Ryn clan. Invited to visit their splendid mansion, Miranda is immediately entranced by the dark-eyed, seductive Nicholas, the master of the house called ""Dragonwyck.""

Small touches make the film work -- Price's voice is satin smooth, but his possessive looks and attentive manners also spell out the fact that his interest in his ""little country cousin"" is much more than innocent.

With her sensual face and luminous gaze, Tierney is ideal at showing a girl's transition from wide-eyed innocent to adoring wife, and her agony at discovering Nicholas' true nature is mesmerizing and heart breaking. The gothic horrors of the story are a convincing metaphor for one young girl's sensual awakening.

Release this film at once! American Gothic fans are tired of just leafing through the original ""DRAGONWYCK"" novel, written by Anya Seton in 1944.",1133308800,31,1097,5.287356321839081

Yes and it is exactly the same dvd! Proves again that Amazon considers itself exempt from the normal laws of a free market.
Concerning the movie itself, I immensely enjoyed seeing the picture again. I love Gene Tierney and I love Vincent Price. They were in four films together and this one shows the most interaction between them. Price's name appears third from the top (after Tierney and Walter Huston) but it is his movie. The characters he would later play in the Poe pictures directed by Roger Corman are all variations on his portrayal of Nicholas van Rhyn. The film is in black and white but it is hard to believe that color would have added anything to it. The acting, costumes, set design and the Alfred Newman score are all first rate. Having praised it, I should point out that the film is, nevertheless, flawed. Scene by scene there is nothing to fault, but put it all together and something is  lacking. This troubled me until I finally figured it out.
This is the first film directed by Joseph Mankiewicz and he must have been under tremendous pressure. It was a big budget movie for 1946, and came out at a time when audience tastes were changing swiftly, making it hard to predict what films would  be successful. Moreover, Mankiewicz was not the first choice of the studio as director (even though he wrote the screen play). Ernst Lubitsch was. But Lubitsch had a heart attack and was not up to the physical strain of directing - so he was put on the film as a producer. This put Mankiewicz in an impossible position. If Dragonwyck was successful, Lubitsch would get at least half the credit; if it failed, Mankiewicz would get all the blame and this probably would have been the only movie he ever directed. Mankiewicz eventually drove Lubitsch into disassociating himself entirely from the movie - which appeared with no one credited as a producer - a very unusual situation!  Unfortunately, what drove Lubitsch out was a complete disagreement on what the movie was about. Lubitsch apparently wanted to break with his usual sophisticated comedies and do a ripping yarn of a Gothic horror story. Mankiewicz feared that a horror movie would bomb with the audience and wanted to play it safe with more of a ""woman's movie"" centering on Tierney's character. The result is a weird combination of both genres. The first half of Dragonwick is a costume romance with almost every scene shot from the perspective of a young New England farm girl. The second half of the film (after Tierney's character marries Prince's character) is completely different, and is when Price blossoms out. To understand what you are missing, listen to the commentary which comes with this dvd. There was a scene meant to appear early in the film in which the audience is clued into Nicholas' Van Ryn's character. One of the commentators reads the entire scene, which is fascinating. Van Ryn emerges as a proto-Nazi who believes that the weak must be eliminated with no more emotion than cutting a withered branch from a plant. Tierney's character is not present when this speech is given, and therefore does not know what she is in for by marrying this guy!  If only that scene had remained in the picture (and Lubitsch fought, unsuccessfully, to keep it). It would have established one of the essential elements of a good horror story: the audience knowing about a danger hidden to the protagonist, usually played by an attractive young woman. Mankiewicz wanted the audience to step into the young woman's shoes and only know what she knows, so we never get to see that vital scene. More's the pity. The loss of it makes Tierney's character less sympathetic, not more so. In the end, Lubitsch was right (he usually was) and Mankiewicz shot his own movie in the foot.",1440028800,,3920,4.701601164483261
