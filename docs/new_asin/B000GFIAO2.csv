8131281,4,B000GFIAO2,"""Lakshmanrekha"" is bollywood movie from 1991. Many of the Bollywood movies from this time (esp if Jackie Shroff is in it) will be an action movie not unlike something that Hollywood would have made at the same time.

The main difference might be the language they speak. And Bollywood movies usually have more of a 'tearjerker' theme of lost relations, and they last longer.

""Lakshmanrekha"" is a sleuth/action movie with a very thick plot. It pans out to about the 2 hr 40 minute mark. I suspect a lot of viewers will turn off during the course of the movie and find it boring.

That said, if you are willing to concentrate on the plot and what keeps happening, you will find it to be an excellent action movie with a lot of 'cat and mouse' going on. There are a lot of stunning scenes and thrilling action sequences. The director definitely put a lot of work into this.

You will see plenty of 'big photos' of girls on the DVD case but they hardly figure in the movie.

Danny Denzongpa is excellent as a psychopathic criminal, who likes to sing songs with his victims as he kills them, and Pran suits as the 'values and morals' old father.

If you like your 90's action movies with a thick plot, and maybe some disco dancing in the garage, Lakshmanrekha should be a good choice for you.",1383523200,,1288,4.436440677966102
