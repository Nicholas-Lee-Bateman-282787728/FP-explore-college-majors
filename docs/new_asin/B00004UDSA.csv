7923908,5,B00004UDSA,"I purchased this to help some of my students, who happen to have learning disabilities, to study at their own speed in addition to the help that I given them.  It must be used with a highly motivated student who really WANTS to learn.  That's the one student to whom I loaned this CD.  It's excellent at describing and explaining geometrical theorems and concepts.  The student, who is extremely bright, is getting a great deal out of this CD.  If I remember correctly, it's not explained by the same person who does the chemistry CD, but it's every bit as good.  I would recommend this highly to anyone who has a motivated student who can work on her/his own and will be responsible about learning from the CD on a regular basis.  It's also great for teachers who want to brush up on their geometry knowledge and skills a bit .",1448496000,,828,4.443708609271523
7923909,3,B00004UDSA,I thought it would have more lesson in it. It would be good for a reference guide.,1439856000,,82,3.8823529411764706
7923910,4,B00004UDSA,A great home-school or refresher video - they have many various ones. They are dated but a fun way to learn... better than dated and boring.,1326412800,3,140,4.423076923076923
7923911,5,B00004UDSA,"This program is very thorough and very easy to understand, even I as an adult finally get it! I purchased this program for my daughter who was struggling with geometry. She learned the concepts as taught in this dvd, now she is breezing through her high school geometry textbook with ease. It's like having a personal tutor. I highly recommend this product.",1192060800,9,357,4.774193548387097
