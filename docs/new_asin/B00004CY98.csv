7920106,5,B00004CY98,"This is the second and to date final Dallas reunion to continue the plot of the show.  Unfortunately, without the touch of Lenny Katzman, the film is missing a lot of goodness.  However, I still rate it 5 stars and say it's good enjoyable fun for Dallas fans.  JR, Bobby, and Sue Ellen are at it again, while Ray Krebbs and Carter McKay also return.  Again, the main problem here is that this was not followed up on-it is not a good conclusion to the series like JR Returns could have been, and it is a shame this is the end of Dallas.  It would be nice if they could make one more, but if it was also bad then perhaps they are wise to stop right here.  I say more Dallas is better than less, at any rate!",1194739200,,705,4.0359712230215825
7920107,2,B00004CY98,"Considering that most of the original cast, along with important characters that came in later, were either dead, involved in other projects, or had no interest whatsoever in the project, there was no reason for this lackluster ""reunion"" film, other than to grab ratings for CBS.  Only original stars Larry Hagman (""J.R.""), Patrick Duffy (""Bobby""), Linda Gray (""Sue Ellen""), and Steve Kanaly (""Ray"") appear in the film, a very weak story about control over Ewing Oil.  George Kennedy, a late-in-the-show addition, returns as ""Carter McKay"".

Though some years separate this one from the last first-run episode of the long-running drama, it's still a bit unnerving to see a gray-haired Hagman trying to be the businessman-lothario that the world loved to hate.  Hagman now looks more like patriarch ""Jock"" (the late Jim Davis) and the thought of either sharing a bed, respectively, with the much younger Tracy Scoggins is enough to make one turn off the VCR.

For fans of the series, as well as all others, this is one ""re-visit"" best left alone.",1138492800,,1045,5.017341040462428
