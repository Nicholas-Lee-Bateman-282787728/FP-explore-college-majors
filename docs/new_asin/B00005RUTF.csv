8204832,5,B00005RUTF,"Misora Hibari's performance at the Tokyo Dome took place only months before her death at the age of 52. She had been performing professionally since the age of 8. She recorded over 1,200 songs and acted in 160 movies including a series of movies where she portrayed a young samurai warrior. You will hear squeals of delight from the audience when she sings songs from those movies and makes the moves of a samurai. Misora was... still is the ultimate entertainer! I found myself immediately captivated by her interaction with her audience. The energy and emotion that colors her performance is amazing. Although I know nothing of the Japanese language, I can see why Misora Hibari is still considered the best female performer of all time in Japan. Every year there are memorial concerts in her honor. Do yourself a favor, order a copy and enjoy the majestic Misora Hibari!",1364860800,,873,4.826666666666667
