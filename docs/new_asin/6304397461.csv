Connery bring credibility to the film--without him it would drop several stars, though Alfred Lynch was considered the actual star. It is also a great chance to see that Connery had comedic acting chops early on. This cover is absurd (the woman is not in the film) though it shows the original ""On the Fiddle"" title, a British expression for ""On the Take"". Don't expect a blockbuster movie, it is just good old black and white fun.",1469318400,,599,4.504587155963303
7871094,3,6304397461,"The download was flawless and as described but I wish I had not invested in it.  I guess it was a good learning experience about how hard stars have to work before they become stars.  There are other doctored-up titles similar to this under ""Sean Connery.""  I imagine that the property owner(s) probaby took everything that Sean ever walked across the set on, and turned it into a ""Starring Sean Connery"" cover.  Even the art work was a lame attempt to invoke the early ""Bond"" posters.  Not worth watching unless you are a 90 year old nostagic Englishman.  I am going to see if Amazon will let me return the download for a credit or something.",1467158400,2,643,4.5

7871096,4,6304397461,"I had never even heard of this movie, so I bought it on a whim and was pleasantly surprised. This is one of Sean Connery's first films. Set during WWII, he plays a not too bright private and Alfred Lynch plays his smart  scheming friend. The two of them get into all sorts of trouble with the  ""brass"" and the ""birds"". Somewhere along the way they  also manage to become WWII heroes. I highly recommend this film to anybody  who enjoys a war movie with a few laughs.(Kelly's Heroes, 1941) Also a  great movie if you want to see Sean Connery B.B.(before Bond)",962323200,22,558,4.378640776699029
