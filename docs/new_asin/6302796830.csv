This begins in 1882 St. Joseph Missouri. A man shot Jesse James! People grab souvenirs. Jesse and Frank rode with Quantrells Raiders. They show scenes of rural life. Frank works his farm with two mules. In town men talk about the Tilden-Hayes election of 1876. They show a card game in town. The gang robs a bank, then flees from the gunfire of the citizens. [No Gun Control then.] The Pinkertons get close but they get away. The Governor of Missouri gets funds from the railroads and express companies (the victims of robberies). They visit Uncle George and his young wife in Kentucky. Frank explains why he must be ever on his guard; he just wants a peaceful life. They show a horse race.

There is a shooting exhibition to raise funds for the fire brigade. Jesse shows his skill with a revolver. Too good for a farmer? The Governor of Missouri offered a deal to the James Boys: surrender and get a plea deal. Do they trust him? Jesse doesnt. Tom Hill acts up in a tavern, then is overpowered and captured. He is offered $10,000 and freedom to betray the James Gang. Frank will go to Sedalia to talk to Major Anderson about that deal. The James Gang rob a train and kill the conductor. Frank doesnt want to continue the outlaw life. Elsewhere there is personal conflict and a shooting. Jesses favorite cousin is dead! What does Governor Crittenden have to offer? Robbers spent their money on gambling, liquor, and women.

Dick Little surrendered. The Ford brothers are alone with Jesse James. I just shot Jesse James! Former soldiers visit the grave. Bob Ford tells about the shooting to paying customers. Charlie Ford plays the part of Jesse James. [Could this act be popular today?] Will the shooting of Jesse affect Franks trial? The trial is a media event. General Shelby testifies, he regrets his past actions. Dick Little tells about the shooting of the conductor. Frank James is acquitted. Ten years later Bob Ford owns a saloon in Colorado, the Omaha Club. Frank travels there. A man has a grudge against Bob Ford, there is another shooting. Later Frank joined Cole Younger in a Wild West Show. Frank died peacefully at home in 1915.

You can compare this movie to the 1939 movie The Return of Frank and Jesse James for its outlook. This seems more realistic and restrained, and less dramatic. One book said some of the stories about the James Gang were similar to the stories of Robin Hood from centuries ago. If people are oppressed does this make them sympathetic to outlaws? Could this explain some of the unrest of today, such as the 1992 Watts riot? Any bank robbery removes cash from an area and adversely affects local commerce. There was no FDIC to insure depositors, the stolen cash came from local residents. The James Gang never robbed local banks. One false note is the use of paper money exclusively; most people preferred specie, cold cash, over notes. [In The Searchers one character has a bag of newly minted double eagles to suggest he was a bank robber.] People complained about the movie Bonnie and Clyde for glorifying these robbers and killers. How was that different from this movie?",1430524800,,3165,4.6768402154398565
