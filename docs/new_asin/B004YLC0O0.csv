8448497,5,B004YLC0O0,"This DVD contains three different pieces (well five really, as ""Three Songs About Motherland"" -as you would expect from the title- itself has three distinct parts). What they all have in common is they're in some way about Russia.

Chris Marker's ""One Day in the Life of Andrei Arsenevich"" I'd heard about and been seeking for a couple years, but this is the first time I found it on DVD (rather than VHS tape, which is no good to me). It portrays Andrei Tarkovsky in some detail, and includes a lot of footage about his shooting of his last film ""The Sacrifice"". Most of the material was new to me (however a few bits of the filming of ""The Sacrifice"" looked somewhat similar to other things I've seen from a different camera). It's a sort of paean to a friend (look elsewhere if what you want is in-depth film criticism).

Sergey Dvortsevoy's little-known documentary ""In the Dark"" is about an aging pensioner in Russia who doesn't much feel like he's 'useful' to society. Besides growing old and feeling useless, another way to view the film is as a commentary either on 'modern' society or about 'environmental' attitudes and possible disaster. The director almost makes a point of _not_ arguing for -or even presenting- any particular point-of-view, leaving you free to interpret his film however you like.  This short documentary was made a few years before his better-known feature-length sorta-fiction film ""Tulpan"".

Marina Goldovskaya's ""Three Songs About Motherland"" presents a lot of 'talk' from lots of different people in Russia today. (Although Ms. Goldovskaya lives in California, she seems to feel right at home in Russia, and repeatedly presents bits of breathtaking honesty that must have been difficult for _any_ filmmaker to elicit, and to portray Russia in a comfortable matter-of-fact way that almost no Western journalist could match.) The first part is intercut bits of interviews with several old people who all remember working for the government as teams of young people to build the city they now live in. The intercuts happen quickly and smoothly, leading to the surface impression that all the people are saying pretty much the same thing. But listen a little closer, and you'll find almost every statement by one person is diametrically contradicted by  someone else right after the next cut. Opinions vary all over the map from ""Stalin was a monster who killed my relatives for no good reason"" to ""I still have Stalin's picture and I miss him and folks shouldn't be crybabies"". The second part is about Anna Politkovskaya, the prominent Russian journalist who had reported so much on Chechnya and was shot dead a few years ago. Most of the footage is of very relaxed homey times with her (i.e. 'in the kitchen') quite a while before her death. This is footage that was already in the can; it's not a retrospective. We get a real sense of Ms. Politkovskaya as an individual person. The third part is about a city in Siberia. It started out as a cold empty wasteland where political exiles were sent, and has grown until it's now a boomtown with lots of industry, marriages, and babies, and doesn't look at all like the stereotype of Siberia. Like ""In the Dark"", ""Three Songs About Motherland"" leaves you to ruminate on your own, without hitting you over the head with any pre-determined ""morals of the story"".

I recommend this to two different audiences: i) those who want to absorb a variety of ""slice of life"" views of Russia today, and ii) cinephiles who want to see some out-of-the-way short films that may not otherwise be easily available on DVD.",1335571200,9,3585,4.849673202614379
