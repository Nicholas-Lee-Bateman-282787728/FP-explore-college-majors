Giselle does a wonderful job at flowing from pose to pose.  I struggled with some of the poses but in time, you will feel stronger.  I think that this dvd will be a welcome addition to anyone's dvd collection.  If you love Pilates, then get it. You won't regret it.  Great job Giselle.",1365206400,,415,4.324675324675325
8453440,5,B005208Y74,"This DVD is a mirror image to her class she offers in person. She is clear in her directions of positions, and if you find yourself not sure, you can always look. She also offers positive words all throughout the DVD, especially when moves are tough and you find yourself not wanting to finish them. You can definietly feel the burn of certain positions and when you are through you find yourself feeling accomplished. I would recommend this DVD to more advanced yogi's.",1312243200,,470,4.674698795180723
8453441,5,B005208Y74,I feel so much stronger from doing this Pilates workout. I can see the difference in my body. It really does firm and shape. I look forward to coming home from work and doing this workout. This is my favorite exercise DVD. I feel like it exercises all the muscle groups. It is a total body workout. It really works your core muscles.,1311984000,,333,4.301587301587301
