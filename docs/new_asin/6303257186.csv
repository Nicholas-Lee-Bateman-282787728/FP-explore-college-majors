606565,3,6303257186,"The Black Bird, 1975 film

The film begins with a history of The Maltese Falcon from 1539 to 1940. In 1975 San Francisco Sam Spade Jr. runs the business located near the waterfront. The neighborhood has changed a bit. A fat man was killed in the lobby of Spade's office building. Spade has a visitor with a $50 bill. Dukay wants the replica for a museum in London, so Spade will search for it. Its not worth anything. A new visitor asks about the previous visitor. What is that bird worth? Effie is a valuable employee with a long history. Spade goes to that address. Will someone play a trick on him? Will Spade fall for it? [Note how the office door opened.] ""Maybe they won't find out about it."" Spade is released, that woman was a professional!

""The Rhythm Room"" is like a scene from the 1940s. Spade meets Wilmer Cook to talk about the sale for $1,500. A telephone call draws him away. A woman warns him of danger from three Hawaiians. She slips him a big .44 revolver! There is a comic chase for action. Spade returns home to find a visitor. That woman returns to warn him of danger from those Hawaiians. ""I'll drive."" Anna has an accent. She is the legal owner and wants it back to save a children's hospital. Will she do anything? ""Was it good for you too?"" Spade discovers where Dukay is and goes to his room. Will there be a load of paper work? Spade discovers a hidden paper. There are more comic scenes back at Spade's office. That paper is written in Arabic. ""Is the bird safe?"" ""Be careful."" Spade visits an expert, the message is written in Aramaic. The Hawaiians take him to Litvak, who offers $50,000 for the black bird.

A visitor, Gordon Immerman, gets on the yacht, rescues Spade and brings him to Anna. Anna tells Spade more about the Falcon. There is a clue to the real fortune. The next day Spade returns to learn the message. Is there a hidden clue in the language? Spade retrieves the Black Bird, then decides to measure and weigh it. ""I don't believe I'm hearing this."" Litvak exults, then collapses. There is action, and Immerman returns to stop the Hawaiians. ""Who turned off the lights?"" Where is the bird? Buried at sea! Can a diver find it? Not if a big shark gets it.

The original story was an example of a futile search for unearned wealth. This parody has the same message. The story is funny, but the ending is less so. Did you find it incredible? [It echoes the ending of ""The Sign of Four"".] They could copy sentences from the original, but not the ending. A better script makes a better story. But there is no other parody around. [This version in EP produced fuzzy images.]

Over 2,400 years ago a Greek philosopher devised a non-destructive test for gold. Weigh the object, then put it in a water-filled vessel and measure the water displaced by the object for its density. The female falcon is bigger than the male tercel. Falcons were used for hunting for many centuries. The improvement in firearms made them obsolete (except for the few who choose to follow this ancient sport).",1285977600,,3024,4.490909090909091

606567,4,6303257186,"I'm with Point Dexter--this should be a double feature with The Maltese Falcon.  (I just watched it that way.)  I saw it when it first came out, remembered it ever since, and recently bought a copy of the VHS tape through Amazon.  It IS hilarious.  Not 100%?  So what--it's good fun.  As a general thing I ask God to spare us sequels--but this is a fine *parody,* which is a bird of a different color, if I may mix my metaphors.",1180396800,4,428,4.222222222222222
606568,5,6303257186,"I first saw this movie in the mid '70's and I just howled at it. Being familiar with ""The Maltese Falcon"" makes it even funnier. In fact for maximum impact,I recommend watching TMF first and then ""The Black Bird"". The writers skewered every scene in the original. ""What good is torture without the threat of death behind it?.... It's fun!"" This film also includes one of my favorite character actors, Lionel Stander, who does a great job as the tough guy. Add former Playmate Connie Kreske, three big Hawaiians and priceless dialogue and sight gags and you got 5 stars. I thought the ending was in perfect keeping with Sam Jr's luck. All together a classic movie that slipped through the cracks. Anxiously awaiting the DVD.",1139097600,18,723,4.746031746031746
606569,4,6303257186,"George Segal stars as Sam Spade Jr., a hard-luck private detective whose legacy from his famous father includes a harridan of secretary (Lee Patrick, reprising her role as Effie Perine from Bogart's 1941 film), a rattrap office in a neighborhood that's gone to hell, clientele of dubious bona fides, and the figure of a black bird that may -- or may not -- be the real Maltese Falcon.

The film is so rich with wacky characters, great running gags and plot twists that it nearly defies description. It's all the more astonishing, then, that the conclusion is so stunningly bad (and thus rates four stars instead of five). My guess is that it's the ending that gives it such a bad reputation but, if you can overlook that, you'll find a real gem.

It can't appear on DVD soon enough for me.",1104796800,10,789,4.549295774647887
606570,3,6303257186,"In THE BLACK BIRD the son of Sam Spade inherits the old family detective business in a seedy neighborhood in San Francisco. After Caspar Gutman's body is found near the detective's office, a renewed search for the elusive Maltese Falcon is begun in earnest. Junior also inherits his father's secretary, Effie Perine. Wilmer Cook gets involved with the new search along with some other eccentric characters.
The movie was produced by George Segal who doubled in the role of Sam Spade, Jr. The supporting cast included Stephane Audran, Lionel Stander, Lee Patrick, Elisha Cook, Jr., Signe Hasso and John Abbott.",1052179200,3,609,5.1

7841757,4,6303257186,"I suspect the reason this funny film isn't on DVD and might never make it to DVD is that it is very politically incorrect.  There's a number of jokes done on his last name in the presence of black people and at least once he bewails having an office in a black neighborhood.  Segal is great in it, there are a lot of funny moments and a lot of references that will register with fans of ""The Maltese Falcon"".  But I doubt that the offensive moments can be overlooked.

""Birth of a Nation"" is on DVD but tolerated, I imagine, due to its importance in the history of film making.",1471046400,3,577,4.218181818181818

7841761,5,6303257186,"I saw this film a few times. It is hilarious and compared to a lot of the miserable slop being issued on DVD it is as yet unavailable. The movie has a huge following so the excuse cant be that it won't sell. Is it in copyright court or something? Thats what kept the movie Walkabout u/a for so many years. This also applies to Strategic Air Command with Jimmy Stewart staring in it too. Everyone wants to see it but nobody is producing the DVDs. Id ""Surf Nazis must die"" can be on DVD, I don't think I'm asking for too much. Get on with it!!!!!",1400803200,5,544,4.093457943925234
7841762,2,6303257186,"If the classic '41 version of THE MALTESE FALCON had been completely true to the book, it would have given Same Spade's secretary, Effie (played by Lee Patrick), the last word--and it would have been a good one, because even though she's been proven wrong about villainess Brigid O'Shaugnessey's true character, she still has some sisterly feeling and compassion towards a woman who had proven to be a heartless schemer and cold blooded murderess.  Her sudden quasi-revulsion towards Sam is a a fascinating turn of events, and a richer, more evocative ending than the Shakespeare quotation that Humphrey Bogart utters at the end of the film.  (Not that that's BAD really, but it's a rather obvious device when you think about it.)

So Lee Patrick (along with co-star Elisha Cook Jr.) reprises her role in this film--and seemingly clocks in more screen time in this spoofy sequel than she got in FALCON.  But the demure, cool and elegant secretary of 1941 has changed a lot.  She's a real harridan in this '76 film comedy.  Why does Sam Spade, Jr. even keep her around (well, we sort of find out WHY a bit later on in the film, but the personal tensions are rife).  I'm sure some will find this bit of stunt casting delicious, and it could have been, if the writing and direction had just been a little bit sharper.  It's nice, in a way, to see a neglected actress get a bit of work later in life.  (She died about six years later, in fact), but one wishes her a better vehicle.

And speaking of elegant actresses, you wish a better vehicle for Stephane Audran too.  A veteran of a number of French art house successes (several directed by her then husband Claude Chabrol), she--like Deneuve--was trying to make some inroads into Hollywood in the 1970s.  Unfortunately (and ALSO like Deneuve), she wound up in a weak comedy that did nothing to display her considerable talents (and charm) to an American audience.  It wasn't until a decade later when she made the Danish hit BABETTE'S FEAST and had a significant role in the BRIDESHEAD REVISITED series that she began to receive any significant recognition on these shores.  Here she's not much more than an Agent 99 with a French (supposedly RUSSIAN) accent.

THE BLACK BIRD could have been a lot better.  There are some pretty good sight gags, and George Segal shows off his comic side as well as anyone could, considering the dialogue he's saddled with.  Most of the rest of the cast is wasted too, including tough guy Lionel Stander and Signe Hasso, doing the kind of part that sharp featured European actresses seemed to always land in the 1970s (like Lotte Lenya in the Bond movies).

I hate to be a directorial snob, but screenwriter/director David Giler was mainly a TV director--and it shows.  Interestingly, he never helmed another cinematic film again.  Surprising to see a Mankiewicz listed among the credits too (Don, this time, who apparently wrote the original story).  Even with that connection, I'd be surprised to see his nephew Josh ever introducing this flop on Turner Classic Movies.  'Cuz, yes, we know not everything on TCM is really a ""classic,"" they do have SOME standards after all.",1356912000,2,3157,4.754128440366973
7841763,4,6303257186,"George Segal plays Sam Spade Jr. as a very irritated detective, just trying to make a living and get through the day.  The script is full of great throwaway lines--e.g., Spade to his waiting room full of clients:  ""I'll see the first person with a ten dollar bill in his hand--and that's cash, we're not taking food stamps anymore.""; to a driver who almost hits him:  ""Get outta my life!""  The running gags of his parking mishaps and the deterioration of his car are great.  There are lots of interesting characters--Immerman, Effie, hotel detective Prizer, the Maitre D' at the Monicker, Kerkorian at the pawn shop, Connie Kreski as the professional assassin who ""...works out of the Phys Ed department at Berkeley"".  Spade's conversations with them are funny and layered with wit and sarcasm.
But when Spade meets Anna things drag badly and, Litvak is just too over the top.  And the ending is too silly to be satisying.
I give this movie four stars because I've watched it a dozen times and the dialog still makes me laugh (and groan enjoyably).  But my wife doesn't get it.",1346976000,3,1077,4.691489361702128
7841764,3,6303257186,"Not many film buffs are aware of this quite obscure little movie, I guess. Which is a pity, as it actually is quite funny and decently made parody of the so much better known classic, The Maltese Falcon. Available only on video, I think it really should be distributed in DVD format for a wider audience. It deserves more recognition, as much more inferior parodies are being churned out from movie companies every year. There are several funny scenes in the movie, and the dialogue is often hilarious. To like and appreciate this film, I'd presuppose three things: 1) that you know the original ""Maltese Falcon"" 2) that you find MAD magazine movie parodies funny 3) that you dislike the all-too-raunchy and too fastpaced American movie ""comedies"", calculated to appeal to infantile and brainless modern teenage moviegoers.",1306713600,9,823,5.014598540145985
