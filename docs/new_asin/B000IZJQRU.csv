2664488,3,B000IZJQRU,"Overall I enjoyed this movie. As in most Bollywood  movies ( atleast most of the ones I've seen over the years) there is some over the top comic relief (the Haha Father and the coke bottle glasses wearing friend) which personally I could do without.

Also, there is the usual  singing and dancing which I sometimes enjoy, not so much in this movie except for Akshay on the ship.

Overall, the storyline is pretty good and there were surprises and twist and turns and even the fighting and action scenes were belivable.",1439078400,,518,4.5978260869565215
2664489,4,B000IZJQRU,Very nice and entertaining. Does not take much to guess the crook. Then the twists & turns.,1438214400,,91,4.411764705882353
2664490,3,B000IZJQRU,"Not too bad, a good twisted plot, but acting wasn't the best.",1436745600,,61,4.166666666666667
2664491,2,B000IZJQRU,I usually try to do a thorough review but this movie was just annoying and slimey more than any one thing  that I hated. I've watched and read plenty of spicy to even wild plot movies and just couldn't dig this one. For believability factor I just couldn't buy that Deol would forgive Akshay just because he saved Akshay's  life later. He would of beat the stew out of him and then dragged Priya away from the slime ball because at no time was she even suggested as being unfaithful. She was being stalked by the other creepy couple and I just can't see him saying oh what the heck it's all water under the bridge that you said you wanted to sleep with my wife. Let's shake and pretend it never happened...If they were all French maybe they wouldn't kill each other but they still wouldn't be friends again...2 thumbs down.,1336521600,,823,4.407894736842105
2664492,3,B000IZJQRU,"The plot of this movie is twisting and full of surprises. At the end of the day it's a love story, but there is wife swapping, murder, and more along the way.

It's rated 14, about the equivalent of PG-13 in the U.S. There is a lot of suggestive dancing and themes, and a couple of female bare backs.

The biggest problem with the movie is the side characters, who are much more annoying than usual. There are two couples, and the men keep talking in abbreviations and then explaining the abbreviations. It doesn't add anything except length to the movie.

It was filmed in Switzerland, Mauritius, and aboard a cruise ship, and there is some very neat scenery, especially wild beaches in Mauritius.

If you can get this at a bargain basement price or rent it and you can stand some over the top characters, it's probably worth watching. But I wouldn't buy it again.",1296864000,,865,4.5256410256410255

2664498,4,B000IZJQRU,"Disk itself by EROS had such a poor quality. I would ask the seller for any other distributor.
The movie is another collaborative work of the director duo and Bobby Deol which has worked wonderfully  in the past.
The script is not without flaws, the music is a bit annoying.
What pulls the movie up is the star cast, all four did an excellent job. They all fit their roles and do them justice.
Overall it's a good movie.",1456099200,,420,4.3164556962025316
