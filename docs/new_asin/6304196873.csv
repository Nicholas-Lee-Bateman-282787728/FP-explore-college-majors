805534,5,6304196873,"This is a most excellent presentation and dramatization of issues that exited and to some extent still exite in the New York City public school system.
Glen Ford, Sidney Portier and the other actors really demonstated very professional acting skills. This movie should be studied and used as a prototype for concerned teachers and pricipals. Students and parents alike will have a good reference for measuring social progress and academic in the NYC school system

This is a most excellent film production about social and academic progress or the lack thereof in the New York City school system. The acting was superb and Glenn Ford and Sidney Portier along with the other actors demonstrated high professional skill. The main producers and writers were definitely visionaries because similar problems still exit in New York City's public schools. The movie would serve as a very good protype for teachers, students, principals and parents. It deserves to be watched by anyone interested in measuring what happens in schools public schools when teenagers are neglected.",1481673600,,1070,5.257309941520468
805535,4,6304196873,"The Blackboard Jungle, 1955 film

Is there a problem with ""juvenile delinquency"" in our schools? Is ""rock and roll"" destroying the youth of America? Would Hollywood exploit this concern? The film starts by showing an elevated subway train in New York City. Richard Dadier applies for job as an English teacher at North Manual High School. ""There is no discipline problem."" The students assemble to meet the new teachers. Some students have an attitude problem. Dadier takes charge of his class. Later he rescues a new teacher from unwanted attention, and establishes a reputation. One teacher is devoted to jazz music; is he too naive? Two teachers take a short cut and are ambushed. The police arrive to rescue them. It was too dark to identify anyone.

Dadier sees other classes where students care about their education. Dadier wants to reach young minds. Unattended children do not get a decent home life, and join gangs for companionship. Is it just a lack of parental control? They have to work long hours and can't be home all day. [No church or relatives?] Some students hijack a newspaper truck. A teacher brings rare recordings to class - someone gets an education about this. The teachers have different ways of coping with their students. Dadier is challenged by this school. The students have a discussion about ""Jack and the Beanstalk"". What is the real meaning of this story? Can students be reached by ""visual education'? What about reading, writing, and arithmetic? One scene shows Miller working on a 1930s car, a side-valve six with an oil bath air cleaner.

Dadier's wife is brought to the hospital. Ann has some worries about something. Their son is born premature. Richard learns about the poison pen letters and considers quitting. Their pay rate then was $2 an hour, many earned far more. [Teacher's unions have solved this problem.] A crisis develops when West is caught cheating. Most of the students back Dadier, and two will be brought to the Principal. ""Everybody learns something in school, even the teachers.""

""Evan Hunter"" went on to write many more novels, as well as ""Ed McBain"". But Aldous Huxley wrote an earlier novel about a class-based educational system - ""Brave New World"". Were there such schools in the 19th century? This film has remained entertaining and educational. Was it based on the author's experiences? The name ""Hunter"" may be a tribute to his college.",1474416000,,2406,4.948019801980198

805606,4,6304196873,"I first saw this movie when it was first released 60 years ago. I thought it was a good movie then and I still think so, although for vastly different reasons. While it was considered a hard-hitting, pull-no-punches movie in 1955, when one considers the out-of-control situation in many schools today, to me it seems almost tame.
In 1955, I was attending an inner-city school and ten years later, I graduated from an inner city high school. None of the schools that I attended were anything like the blackboard jungle depicted in the movie. Teachers were respected and education was explicitly seen as the path to upward socioeconomic mobility. Of course, back in those days, rules and standards were enforced by various means, up to and including corporal punishment.
Unfortunately, many of the schools of today  and not necessarily only those in the inner city - increasingly resemble the school in the movies. In fact, the thugs of today are worse. They no longer carry switchblade knives; they carry guns, sometimes including automatic weapons (i.e. machine guns). However, both in the case of the fictional school and real schools of today, the root cause of the social breakdown was and is the same  lack of discipline.
Just as in the movie, in which the principal was willfully blind to the situation in his school, the educational bureaucrats of today, whether they be local, state or federal, seem not to be able to see the obvious: that instead of throwing money at the problem, all that is necessary is to get back to basics  the 3 Rs and discipline. They seem to act as though they have a professional interest in continuing educational chaos. Of course, that's only my rather jaded and cynical opinion.
One thing that, so far, I have not seen any comments on is the attempted rape of one of the female teachers, Mrs. Lois Hammond. The scene was set up like so: It is the end of the school day and Mrs. Hammond is going down the stairs. She briefly pauses on the stairs to adjust her stocking, showing a quick flash of leg. One of the thuggish students sees this, immediately grabs her, and forces her into the empty school library. The movies protagonist, another teacher named Richard Dadier, sees her dropped shoe in the hallway; he rushes into the library and rescues Mrs. Hammond. The movie implies that Mrs. Hammond, by immodestly showing her legs when fixing her stockings, actually excited the student and so caused her own attempted rape. The movie goes even further. When Mr. Dadier tells his wife about the incident, she explicitly asks or states whether the attempted rape was her own fault. I realize that blaming the victim in rape cases was common in the 1950s and actually for decades afterward. I just think its interesting that it hasn't (so far) been commented on.
One more thing. Sidney Poitiers character, Gregory Miller, is shown in the auditorium with some other black guys, practicing a song for the upcoming school show. Theyre singing a Negro spiritual called Let My People Go. One might call that benign stereotyping. I think that it would be more likely that a group of black guys in 1955 would be singing one of the doo-wop songs of the period. Doo-wop was very big in the black community at that time. OK, its a minor quibble, but I had to get it off my chest.",1443398400,,3302,4.709342560553633

805728,5,6304196873,"I consider this an excellent 5-star movie. The following is not intended as a criticism, but only as an observation. And it may only be of interest to those concerned with the accuracy of movie transfers.

Because of the difficulty of finding new VCRs for sale, I have been gradually replacing my movies on VHS with DVDs. However, when I acquire a DVD to replace an existing VHS in my collection, I always play a few minutes of the beginning of the movie in both formats to verify that the DVD is of, at least, equivalent quality to the VHS it will be replacing. Unfortunately, this is not always the case.

When I performed this routine procedure with the movie ""Blackboard Jungle"", I got quite a surprise, But first, I should mention that my DVD copy of ""Blackboard Jungle"" is part of a 7-DVD set released by Warner Brothers and titled ""Controversial Classics"". My VHS copy is an MGM/UA Vintage Classics issue.

Now, to relate what I discovered. When I viewed the first scene of the movie on VHS, immediately following the opening credits, an elevated commuter train travels across the screen from right to left on a straight track. While that train is still in view, a second train appears crossing the screen from left to right on a straight track that is much lower than but parallel to the first track. I thought it was a neat scene of opposing movements, and it stuck in my mind.

When I then watched the opening scene of the movie on DVD, I was surprised to find the scene with the 2 trains had been replaced with a totally different scene showing only one train traveling from left to right across the screen on a curved track!

I wonder why the opening scene had been replaced, and which was the ""original"" scene that had been approved by the director? Now, admittedly, the replacement of the opening scene doesn't have a major impact on the story. However, I now wonder if I had the time and the equipment to watch both copies of the movie side-by-side in their entirety, how many other changes would I discover? And if I did this with other movies I was replacing, how many other movies would I discover had been similarly ""re-edited"" when they were transferred to DVD?

My own theory for the change in ""Blackboard Jungle"" is as follows. Since the subsequent scene appears to show Glenn Ford getting off a public bus, maybe the scenes with the train and the bus were meant to imply that Glenn Ford had traveled from the suburbs by train and bus to get to the inner-city school where he was going to teach. And the scene with only one train going in one direction gave more of that impression, whereas the scene showing 2 trains traveling in opposite directions detracted from the intended impression.",1438905600,,2712,4.5699588477366255

Packed with great stars, a credible script and plausible plot, ""Blackboard Jungle"" also features Sidney Poitier in one of his first film roles, as a troubled student.
Ironically, a dozen years or so later, Poitier starred in ""To Sir, With Love,"" where HE plays the 8idealistic teacher in a rough London school.

806145,5,6304196873,"Blackboard Jungle is cited so often in rock bios (Keith Richards, Bill Wyman, Ron Woods, Bobby Keys) that I simply had to see it. Sure, after a long scrolling introduction set to wild rock drumming you do get the opening sounds of Bill Haley and his Comets doing Rock Around The Clock, which is good fun, but you really don't hear much more rock music in the film after that at all  once more in the middle, in an instrumental piece, and once at the end (the producers had paid $5,000 to use it three times), although theres a bit of jazz at one point a propos of the book, which cites jazz as the music of the film. The film shows a bunch of creepy juvenile delinquents in class getting tough and nasty, tough yet nave new teacher (played by Canadian actor Glenn Ford) learning the ropes as a new teacher (and walking them through awful top-down lessons), young thug nastiness, knife fights, and sympathetic character turnarounds who oppose the bad-to-the-bone villains, with the teacher Mr Dadier (daddy-o!) using a Jack and the Beanstock cartoon to impress his students and win them over! Sydney Poitier is good as the only black kid in the class (it seems  a few are seen later on), whos also the most handsome, and the natural leader (Vic Morrow, as the drunken, crazed gang leader is less leaderly). Plenty of tinges of racism, which even back then they were pretending was an old-fashioned way of thinking. Ford, of course, has a winging, scrawny wife who gets frantic and is generally no fun. Jamie Farr, who plays Corporal Klinger in M*A*S*H, credited here with his real name Jameel Farah, played the smiley Santini in the film. Some good action, some great ideas, and some great in-class dialogue! A blockbuster and revolutionary social realism film that really busted things open, and not just about rock n roll!

For the 2005 50th anniversary DVD edition theres great commentary from Paul Mazursky, Jamie Farr, the films assistant director Joel Freeman and Glenn Fords son Peter Ford (Glenn was probably too weak to attend, having suffered a series of strokes at the end of his life  he died in 2006). The commentary starts off with Jamie Farrs tale of how he came to be cast in the film, Paul Mazursky pitches in, explaining mechanics like how it was all filmed on back lot, gives lots of names, tells studio stories, identifies Jim Baccus wife Henny Baccus, talks about how there was dancing in the aisles in Boston when the movie started, had to show the film without the music of the opening, giving personal anecdotes like how the New York actors were picked up from the airport in a limo although they had never seen a limo before, director Richard Brooks was an ex-Marine and very tough, get my gun, wheres my gun, shoot that man, get him out of here. Mickey Rooney was wanted for Glenn Fords role, but nobody thought it appropriate. Took four hours to convince Glenn Ford to lose his long hair (which he never grew back after that!). Steve McQueen was considered for the Artie West role that went to Vic Morrow  now that would have been great! The boys were excited to see Erroll Flyn, Bette Davis, Barbara Stanwyck in the commissary! American censorship offices like the Legions Of Decency and others were against so many parts of the film, especially the adulterous hints, or how bad the film made American schools look. They wanted to film a school in Moscow to provide negative contrast (!!!), eventually putting in a superfluous scene of a wretchingly good American school to provide positive American contrast. Was nominated for Directors Guild awards, but not for an Oscar. After Blackboard Jungle, Bad Day At Black Rock, The Next Voice You Hear, MGM made more stark films with serious themes, less family fare. Mazursky cant bear to watch the gratuitous good school scene, which was not in the book and had to be written in by Richard Brooks at studio urging. Film shot over four weeks for close to $1.5 million (more that what Mazursky paid to do Harry And Tonto, he adds) from November 15th to December 20th 1954, and they worked on Saturdays. The film was banned in 15 countries anyway. This is emboldening the Communists and is making us look bad, were some of the things said at the time. The movie seemed revolutionary, nobody had made a movie about bad behavior in schools, although  Mazursky knew all of this was real as he was from a tough school in Brooklyn, and his wife worked in a school in East Brooklyn, Maruzrsky had just gotten married, went to the school and did some research. The guy from Naked City, Horace MacMahon, plays the detective in the film also. Rafael says stinkin instead of finkin, like they did in the book. Anytime you wanna come by, just come over, the guys say to each other in the commentary. Hes high on Sneaky Pete. They wanted to film it in colour, but didnt. Wanted to film it in Chicago, but didn't have the budget. In the film they used Jack and the Beanstalk, in the book it was the allegory 51st Dragon. Ford was in demand as an actor, but badly needed for this film  he finished Interrupted Melody on a Friday, Blackboard Jungle started on a Monday. When asked who the modern-day Glenn Ford is, Mazursky says it must be Tom Hanks, Farr backs this up by mentioning the Jimmy Stewart stutter and the likability. Paul Mazursky hinted at hanky panky happening at Trader Vics during the shooting, but didn't give details, pissing everybody else off. Talked about memoirs that everyones writing. Had to change the detail about Ann losing the  baby, as in the book, and its born premature. The school was named Manual Trades School, changed to North Manual High School for some silly reason, although its referenced earlier in dialogue. Had submitted it to Venice Film Festival, but US ambassador to Italy Claire Booth Lewis said she would not attend because she objected to the film, and it was pulled. The guys laugh hard over the following lines from the Jack and the Beanstalk scene:

The cops would have kept the loot for themselves.
Not the FBI!!

Extras were from a tough school, they needed policing. The crying kid with the tie was Tommy Ivo, who went on to be a famous race car driver. Jamie Farr asks Paul Mazursky if he thought about ever being a writer/director/producer at the time, while he was working in a health food store, and if Richard Brooks influenced him as an artist, says that Brooks helped him get his start with his first agent. In the scene when someone threw a ball at the blackboard, the ball actually hit Glenn Ford in the throat, he didn't flinch  ex-Marine. Mazursky was close to Vic Morrow. Poitier was 27, Vic was 25, although they were mostly cast to look the same age. MGM was able to make Ben Hur on the profits from Blackboard Jungle. They tell the story of how Rock Around The Clock was chosen for the soundtrack - Brooks and Ford would have planning meetings, they hadnt picked music for it, because although jazz is mentioned in the book they wanted something more contemporary. Theyd heard lots of albums and records from Fords son, Brooks brought in Rock Around The Clock, and they both agreed on it.

to think back to my high school yrs.& started remembering the gawd-awful disrespectable treatment that one student in particular bestoyed on a first year math teacher! She simply chose to ignore the almost daily ensults & Stopped her Teaching

806521,5,6304196873,"Said to provoke violence, this film about 1955's brutal and vicious NYC school system remains taut and effective to this day. The direction by Richard Brooks is groundbreaking. Based on Evan Hunter's novel, Brooks tackles the idea of contempt for authority within the school system as a problem with a distinct solution. That solution comes in the form of an idealistic new teacher played with effective restraint by Glenn Ford. Sidney Poitier and Vic Morrow portray the two major protagonists from the class of intimidating and delinquent juveniles. Sidney Poitier is the one weak link that Ford realizes he can reach. Poitier is antagonistic and disturbingly introverted but not truly dangerous. Vic Morrow is malicious and a real threat. Vic Morrow's performance is intense, riveting and absolutely convincing. Vic Morrow's talent as one of our finest actors seems long forgotten and certainly has gone unrecognized for too long now. His performance here is testament to that and adds to the shock value of this film. The very effective acting is convincing setting a benchmark for this genre on society's problems in urban education. In all, that is the point of this film.

In college, I came into information that challenged that image. There was teachings that the 1950's were archaic and backwards. I concluded, it depended on who you were.
This ""pre-Martin Luther King, Jr. Civil Rights movement"" film proves both perspectives are right and both perspectives are wrong. It also proves Shakespeare was also right when he said ""Times may change, but man remains the same"".
We are the same in the way we view society, race, crime and sex. I think this film also proves that today's pseudo intellectuals that you see on CNN, MSNBC or read in the Huffington Post are deluded. We're no more or less smarter, enlightened, tolerant or intolerant than we ever were.
We are people and we are flawed. We always have been and we always will be.
This beautiful film should be shown to ALL public school kids and to today's modern liberal to show them they do not possess a new enlightened perspective of American life.

West does everything in his power to stop Dadier from getting through to these kids, but Dadier will not give up. Even though he's been made fun of, threatened, beaten, and almost fired over false accusations. Although, Miller is reluctant to help him, he starts to realize how sincere Dadier is about helping his students, and Miller becomes his main asset in the class. Still, West starts to threaten his pregnant wife into paranoia, Dadier has had enough.  Dadier confronts him the next day in class. West is separated from his crew by Miller and it's just him and Dadier. West pulls a knife on him, but is too scared to do anything beside cut his hand once. Dadier disarms West and sends him to the office, signaling the end of West's reign of terror and the start of a new learning experience for the rest of the kids.

It was before it's time touching on racism and school violence. The character of Dadier demonstrates good character by yelling at everyone for using racial slurs, and saying doesn't matter what color your skin in, we are all the same.

806708,5,6304196873,"Blackboard Jungle is a fantastic movie, the acting was spot on and the plot is very well setup.

Glenn Ford who plays Richard Dadier, the main character that is a new and up incoming teacher takes on the task to try to teach a bunch of inner-city rascals. But he tries to find a light at the end of the tunnel by asking the only African-American student, Gregory Miller (Sidney Poitier), to be the leader and to set up his pupils to be good and to listen in class.

This tactic does not work very well for Dadier. After he finds a student trying to sexually harass a new female teacher, his whole class seems to turn against him. Then he finds himself getting beaten in an alleyway by thugs and anonymous mail being sent to his wife stating that he has been having an affair, when this is a complete lie.

At first, he suspects Miller for doing these terrible things. But one day in class, as one of his students is being a little too defiant, he sends Artie West (Vic Morrow) to the principal. Then out of the blue, Artie pulls a switchblade and points it to Dadier, daring him to come closer. Another student comes behind Dadier, trying to ambush him, but he is put down by Miller knocking him onto the floor. As Artie backs into a corner feeling hopeless, he looks towards his classmates and friends for help with Dadier, but they stand there like ghosts while watching this altercation take place. While Dadier begins to get closer and closer to Artie, Artie takes a quick slash and nips Dadier's hand. This does not stop Dadier from reaching Artie, but as he begins to ponder while looking into this criminal's eye, he realizes that he was the one who did all of those horrible things to Dadier and his family. While Dadier is explaining all of the menacing things Artie did, like the alley beating and the mail to his wife, Artie begins to panic and then Dadier sees it as a good time to strike. He grabs Artie and slams him against the chalkboard multiple times and the knife drops. The Hispanic, known as Petey, grabs it, then Artie looks to him and tells him to help him with Dadier. Petey lifts his hand up and stabs the desk to tell Artie that he is not a criminal like him and his ally.

As you can see, this is a very twisted and exciting plot. It keep you watching it for the entire 101 minutes. If that does not, then the cutthroat acting of Sydney Poitier and Glenn Ford will definitely be another major factor.

806709,3,6304196873,"""Blackboard Jungle"" is a 1955 movie that portrays an undisciplined high school in New York. After Richard Dadier becomes an English teacher to a class of unruly teenage boys, he decides to try to tame them. After a series of unforeseen events, including being attacked by a gang, almost getting stabbed, and his wife being harassed, he gains the respect of his peers and students.
 Before watching, I imagined this film would be a ""West Side Story"" meets ""Grease"" kind of movie, but to my disappointment there were no musical numbers. There were, however, arguments in the classroom spurned from skin color and ethnicity. In 1954 Brown v. Board of Education ruled that segregated schools were not equal. If the director stayed true to the 1955 setting, North Manual High School would just have been integrated; I do not understand why the group of black students in the class was not ostracized more. There were points in the movie where some racism was shown, but Gregory Miller, a black student, was characterized as a class leader, despite his skin color. Although I understand that not every white person vocalized, or even had, any racial prejudices, I feel race should have been more of a plot factor.
 There was a lack of respect for teachers in North Manual High School, as shown in Dadier and other teacher's classrooms. This is still an issue in today's schools; it is caused by a lack of discipline from parents and teachers. The movie shows how the female teachers earned mediocre cooperation by evoking pity from the students. One teacher vocalized his disgust and contempt for his students; he had completely given up on his class and decided that no one had any motivation to learn. Some teachers today still feel that way; they have had one traumatic experience and write off everyone else as unmotivated and lazy. Although most schools are not as violent as the one shown in the movie, the characteristics of the teachers, for better or for worst, still exist.
 ""Blackboard Jungle"" did not feature any female students, only the boys created trouble for teachers. If this movie was remade for the twenty-first century, the classroom should be all girls and show the ways that teenage girls create drama and trouble for teachers. A movie like ""Mean Girls"", although in a comedic way, accurately portrays the behind-the-back type of drama that girls today use.  I am positive that not all girls in the late 1950's were nice and respectful; showing how girls use hostility could have added more depth to the movie.
 The film was, for the most part, a good movie. I found the beginning hard to understand but I quickly found myself following the trials and tribulations of Dadier. The movie soundtrack was youthful and controversial, like the students, and added to the historical significance of changes in society. This movie earns seven out of ten stars for creating a realistic look at a public school during the Civil Rights Movement.",1358294400,,2951,4.870517928286852
806710,5,6304196873,"The movie, Blackboard Jungle, was an excellent movie with its great moral teaching that you can never give up on anything. It demonstrated this through Richard Dadier accepting a job at North Manual High School and after finding out it was ""the garbage can"" of education he still precedes in teaching the kids life lessons. To my surprise this movie was not based too much on racism even though it was made in 1955 making the movie, in my opinion, a lot better because all that came out then were movies based on segregation. I am not saying that those movies were bad instead I am saying that it was kind of overdone. To prove that this movie was ahead of its time in its racial perception the director makes Gregory Millar, a black student, a leader and not only a leader but also a protagonist. Then the director goes the whole nine yards and makes Artie West, a white gang leader, the antagonist.
  Now although this did make the movie different and unique it was not what I liked the most about it. The part in the movie I loved most was where Dadier points out how low in wages school teachers make yet he still continues to teach to the very best of his ability. He even goes and makes a pact with Millar saying he won't quite if Millar doesn't quite as well. I understand that money had literally no role in this movie but since now that money runs the world I just wanted to show how money hadn't corrupt the world yet. Altogether I give this movie a five out of five due to its racial perception, the willingness of a schoolteacher to make a change in the lives of many students, and the lesson learned which was never give up.",1357689600,,1637,4.34640522875817

806836,4,6304196873,"Film noir as a genre came in all shapes and sizes, mainly the best being the crime noir saga. Occasionally though other subjects received royal treatment, as here on the troubling rise of juvenile delinquency in the cities (and maybe elsewhere too) of America in the film under review, Blackboard Jungle. Although a re-viewing of this classic noir reveals some pretty ham-handed notions about the subject of JD's and about schools it still has some ""socially redeeming qualities."" For one, as the vehicle that connected film with the emerging be-bop rock sound being heard on the AM radio in the early 1950s, at least as heard in some places, through the use of Billy Halley and the Comets' smash hit of 1955, Rock Around The Clock. Beyond that some of the performances, especially that of Sidney Portier, as a young alienated, ""talented tenth"" black student who could go either way, fame or crime also sticks out.

The plot of this thing though even for its red scare- moral uplift-we-had better-get-a-handle-on-these-troubled-youth-or-the-Russkies-will-beat us time seems well, corny. Corny because the characters from Glenn Ford's worldly-wise but idealistic and frustrated young teacher to the white (represented by Vince Morrow), black (Portier), Spanish and other city ethnic group students are wooden when I compare them to my own similar working-poor neighborhood (minus the blacks) of the time. In short, youth here are merely misunderstood and with the right formula (some version of tough love and a peek at Ozzie and Harriet) they will, except those few rotten apples who we will put in stir for good, change their ways.

A little plot summary will give you an idea of what I mean. Ford, hires on in a deeply troubled urban (New York but could have been a lot of places, including on a smaller scale my hometown, North Adamsville) school beset by racial, ethnic, class and social tensions. He is just idealistic enough, like many before and after him, to try to make a difference despite the heavy odds against him. Of course the first rule of teaching, thugs or princes, is who rules the classroom. For much of the film that is an open question as he seeks allies among the motley crew of students, especially Portier. Of course not everybody makes it, student or teacher alike. The be-bop jazz-loving nerdish math teacher (played by Richard Kiley) and the Irish gang leader thug (played by Vince Morrow)to name two. But in the end the key figures have an epiphany and the uphill education struggle goes on.

Moral uplift and due regard for the efforts of generations of teacher to make a different aside you can see where the holes in the plot shine through. The hard reality is that, like at my school, the thugs were weeded out long before high school, or they ran the show, mostly the former. This brings to mind a character from my working class streets, ""Stewball"" Stu (we never called him that to his face because we would have been shivved but that is what we called him among our younger set because the guy was a heavy, heavy whiskey drinker, day and night, walking or driving). Stu dropped out, or rather was kicked out of school, in the ninth grade, I think. But he had a ""boss"" '57 Chevy when they were the rage, about ten million girls around him (and no ""dogs"" either) and all kind of criminal enterprises running. The reason that he got kicked out of school? Oh ya, he threw a teacher, and not a small one out the window, fortunately it was only from the first floor. And they never did squat about it. So see that moral uplift stuff is good for the 1950s movies but just yawn stuff in the real world. Oh ya, Stu's luck ran out later, like sometimes happens but in the 1950s he was the be-bop max daddy king of the jungle. And no blackboard jungle either. Later, fortunately, more realistic troubled youth films were made, like the film adaptations of S.E. Hinton's works, and made without the heavy-handed cautionary tale.",1324339200,,3952,4.75801749271137

Glen Ford is the teacher and the classroom is populated by some future stars when they were very young. People like Vic Morrow and Sidney Poitier are fun to see in this story.
The sound track includes Bill Haley music that was considered pretty hot stuff at the time. I understand that the movie was banned in some places because it was too wild for its time.

806839,4,6304196873,"Today's schools can be a lot scarier than the one Glenn Ford steps into, but this movie's message - teachers can have an impact - remains true.

That was the message writer-director Richard Brooks developed when he adapted the best-selling novel by Evan Hunter a/k/a Ed McBain. Growing up poor in Philadelphia, Brooks had been to tough schools and understood how one teacher could change a life. According to the new book ""Tough as Nails: The Life and Films of Richard Brooks"" (available from amazon.com), that happened to Brooks. He never forgot the teacher who taught him how to read and thus opened a new world for him.

Funny thing was, none of MGM's big contract stars wanted to be in the lead role. Among those turning it down were Robert Taylor and Mickey Rooney. Glenn Ford's career, though, was in a downturn at the time and asked for the part. And he helped make the movie one of the most memorable looks at teen life in the 1950's.

The depiction of juvenile delinquency in ""Blackboard Jungle"" sparked huge controversy, too, and some communities sought to ban the movie because they feared it would lead to violence. Some even called it communist-inspired because it didn't portray schools in a positive light.

""Blackboard Jungle"" is remembered for many things. It was the first movie to feature a rock and roll song, ""Rock Around the Clock,"" which Brooks personally chose for the soundtrack. (It wasn't until the movie came out that the song hit No. 1.) ""Blackboard Jungle"" was a huge hit, MGM's top earner that year, and on a shoestring budget to boot. It helped make a star out of Sidney Poitier, one of the kids in the classroom. And it helped Brooks gain more control over his films.

Keep an eye on the classroom and look for future writer-director Paul Mazursky, future ""Combat!"" star Vic Morrow (he won the part over Steve McQueen) and future ""MASH"" TV star Jamie Farr.

""Blackboard Jungle"" is an eye-opening snapshot of the class warfare (including women!) and racial strife (including Hispanics!) that was eating away at the overall good fortune that most of postwar America generally enjoyed.  These were the beginnings of the disenfranchised youth who became the iconic juvenile delinquents (but nothing like Fonzie) and paved the way for similar movies about hot-rods to hell, motorcycle gangs, and James Dean's work.  And in my opinion...all this paved the way for the Beatnik era and then the Sixties hippie culture, but I digress.

The actors and actresses (future stars!!) are good and realistic, the storyline is taut, and the setting (Anytown, USA) is depressing, just as it should be.

That solution comes in the form of an idealistic new teacher played with effective restraint by Glenn Ford. Sidney Poitier and Vic Morrow portray the two major protagonists from the class of intimidating and delinquent juveniles. Sidney Poitier is the one weak link that Ford realizes he can reach. Poitier is antagonistic and disturbingly introverted but not truly dangerous. Vic Morrow is malicious and a real threat. Vic Morrow's performance is intense, riveting and absolutely convincing. Vic Morrow's talent as one of our finest actors seems long forgotten and certainly has gone unrecognized for too long now. His performance here is testament to that and adds to the shock value of this film.

Glenn Ford is Richard Didier, at first glance, a  milquetoast English teacher. His mettle is quickly tested by angry, violent, young punks posing as his students. He rises to the challenge, including a vicious physical attack, to win them over with his refusal to quit & his courage.

Sidney Poitier and Vic Morrow are standouts as the hoods, and in the most harrowing scene (for me), they smash another teacher's prized jazz record collection.

  BLACKBOARD JUNGLE is the story of Richard Dadier (Glenn Ford), a rookie teacher newly hired at Emmanuel High School, an inner-city school that one of the veteran teachers aptly, we soon learn, refers to as a `garbage can.'  Dadier - immediately and inevitably `Daddy-O' to his class full of juvenile delinquents - is an idealist of sorts who, against the stream, believes that he can reach and teach the kids.  In the class is a glowering Vic Morrow and an apathetic Sidney Poitier - Poitier's character is apathetic, that is - and various other representatives of inner-city hoodlums.  It's in this corrosive environment that Dadier's liberal idealism is buffeted and, finally, put to the acid test. Ford, Morrow and Poitier are outstanding in a story that seems quite dated today.  Although it presents itself as an unblinking expos of juvenile delinquency, there's an awful lot missing from this one - parents are never seen, nor students' homes nor, surprisingly, does there seem to be any female students.  Perhaps, as is suggested on the commentary track, the school was originally supposed a trade school but changed when the powers that be checked what side their bread was buttered on.  As it is, there's seems to be no reason given as to why these kids are so rotten, or whether anyone but Dadier really cares about them.
  Still, BLACKBOARD JUNGLE is a great leap forward from Hollywood's last examination of troubled youth, namely the Dead End Kids, aka the East End Kids, aka the Bowery Boys.  The kid/boys began their career in the 1930s in a number of Warner Brothers' tough guy movies - Dead End with Humphrey Bogart, Angels With Dirty Faces with Jimmy Cagney, They Made Me a Criminal with John Garfield - before des-ing and dos-ing themselves into America's heart as the Bowery Boys in a popular and prolific series of b-flicks in the 40s and 50s. If the Bowery Boys were wise cracking punks whose golden hearts were only a little obscured by the grime of the slums, director Richard Brooks's jungle denizens are outright sociopaths.  Rapists and murderers, stalkers and racial bigots, urban terrorists with a blood lust for intimidation and a virulent disdain for authority.
  Mazursky, Farr, Ford and Freeman tell us, on the comfortable and reminiscence filled commentary track, that Robert Taylor and Mickey Rooney (!?) were considered for the lead role.  It's impossible to imagine anyone but Glenn Ford in the part.  Ford ably conveys the gentle idealism and intelligence that the untested Dadier begins with.  Ford also had the toughness, the ability to express contained rage that burbles to the surface after Dadier has spent a couple of semesters in the garbage can.  In short, he was perfect for the part. BLACKBOARD JUNGLE may not contain Ford's best performance, but it's the best I've seen.
 If the movie doesn't deliver the promised penetrating insight into juvenile delinquency, it dealt honestly with its subject and opened the topic up for a nation-wide discussion.
  Besides the commentary track, the dvd also includes a trailer and a pretty weak MGM cartoon titled Blackboard Jumble and featuring Droopy.  Ah, well, I guess it's nice that they included a cartoon so directly related to the feature presentation.",1119657600,22,3566,5.018675721561969
807046,4,6304196873,"""The Blackboard Jungle"" raises many interesting questions about the root causes of student apathy and delinquency in the inner-city schools.  At the same time it seems to wallow in the most extreme behavior of students i.e. a near rape of an attractive female teacher, multiple assaults on teachers, a student brandishing a switchblade in the classroom.  One character is enigmatic to me, the Artie West character played by Vic Morrow.  Not to say that Morrow doesn't play the character well because he is sufficiently menacing but it seemed over-the-top for the film.  There is much to recommend in this film particularly the starring role of Richard Dadier played by Glenn Ford.  Ford's solid acting keeps the film from veering into melodrama.  A young Sidney Poitier as Gregory Miller, a gifted student whose superior intellect is wasted in this apathetic environment, does a charismatic turn.  In a note of irony, in 1967 Poitier portrayed a teacher attempting to make a difference in an inner-city school in what I feel is a superior film, ""To Sir, With Love"".",1116460800,5,1065,5.017045454545454

807048,5,6304196873,"Restless post-war youth may have hit the road on Brando's motorcycle, but it wasn't until this film that they found their sound. From driving downbeat to throbbing close, Bill Haley's title tune promises a party around-the-clock -- from twelve midnight to broad daylight -- to which teens of the day responded with uncaged delight, raucous cheers, and spontaneous twirling in the aisles. A full year before Elvis, a new generation was on its feet, the legendary youth culture was born, and Rock and Roll was here to stay. America would never be the same -- a mighty heavy load for one modest B-movie from famously conservative  MGM!

Needless to say, the film is an absolute must. Minimize the story line which veers from 50's-style social realism to mild reassurances from writer-director Richard Brooks, (this was, after all, the height of the Cold War and the restrictive production code). Instead, concentrate on the seminal images and associations, so vividly presented, whose residue continues to the present day: Rock-music -- unruly youth -- alcohol and violent sex --  menacing urban underclass. And in two of the most symbolic scenes -- the  trashing of Richard Kiley's record collection and the  thrusting arms through the iron bars --there are serious overtones of barbarians at the gates, against which Glenn Ford's reflex liberalism appears tellingly inadequate. From this point on, only communism was more feared than the spread of Rock-and-Roll and its seditious offspring, juvenile delinquency.

Sure, there are better films from that era than Blackboard, maybe even better teen movies. But, arguably, none are more significant to the course of popular culture. For a brief accidental moment, a little movie from Hollywood not only reflected emergent trends from deep within society, but mobilized them as well. With: a grimly determined Glenn Ford, an arrogantly sinister Vic Morrow, a decidedly unthreatening Sidney Poitier, and in a usual thankless supporting role, the great John Hoyt, whose memorably cruel face was born to preside over either prisons or high schools, take your pick.",1092009600,5,2106,5.252976190476191

807050,4,6304196873,"1955's ""The Blackboard Jungle"" remains a poignant, relevant portrayal of life in America's public schools.  The story of WWII vet turned English teacher (Glenn Ford)as he struggles to reach a class of apathetic teens who do not want to be reached, the movie takes us from Ford's unsuspecting classroom debut through his efforts to lead a normal home life despite the pressures of his new job and finally to a climactic showdown with his most evil of students.
The movie's cast is thoroughly excellent.  Ford is at once tough and terribly vulnerable as the embattled new teacher, Margaret Hayes is all patrician slinkiness as For'd wanne-be paramour, Sidney Poitier is convincing as the slowly mellowing student, and Anne Francis is even sexier than she was in ""Forbidden Planet"" as Ford's supportive but insecure wife.
There's much to appreciate in this film.  Partly intended to help comat the growing problem of juvenile delinquency in 50s America, the film tries hard to achieve realism and generally succeeds.  The students in Ford's class are disillusioned, lazy, suspicious, arrogant, obnoxious, and sometimes dangerous--which is exactly how teens are in real life.  The only typical teenage bad habit that's not portrayed (or at least suggested) is cursing, which of course 50s moral standards would not allow on the big screen.  But if they don't swear, Ford's students have no trouble finding other ways to be both annoying and anarchic, just like real kids.  Interestingly, Ford discovers (much like this reviewer did) that sometimes the best way to reach apathetic kids is with a cartoon.  Sad.
Another great thing about this movie is its approach to the politics of the school world.  The movie's teachers argue and struggle not only with their students, but amongst themselves.  Moreover, the encroaching dangers of multiculturalism are, perhaps inadverdantly, accurately addressed as Ford must deal with ethnic divisions amongst his students which some are eager to exploit for their own gain, as when Ford is unfairly accused of racism simply because of some careless word choices.  In today's schools Political Correctness is indeed the rule, often to the detriment of real learning and growth, so at least one of the film's pertinent warnings has gone ignored.
Though some might find ""The Blackboard Jungle"" dated, it is in fact as timely in all the important ways as it was in the 50s.  The American educational problem continues to undercut many of society's more noble aims, and it will do so as long as the powers that be refuse to take the necessary steps to reach a solution.  Teens must be taught there are absolutes in life and be expected to live up to them, not encouraged to simply indulge their every whim.  Perhaps if enough of us adults in liberated America come to realize this for ourselves, we can at least begin to convince our children of it.",1031961600,6,2878,5.0062893081761

807052,5,6304196873,"I first saw this movie in the early 70s on TV and have rented it numerous times since the advent of VHS. It is an eye-opening portrayal of Richard Daddiere, an eager navy veteran who giddily wins his first teachng assignment at a hopelessly urban hellhole of a school. Right from the start though, one can immediately sense that his altruistic belief in the nobility of teaching will be reduced that of a desperate corrections officer doing his best to quell a daily uprising. And this does become the case very early into the film and serves as the film's central conflict. His first day of class begins with one of the punks hurling a baseball within inches of his head the first moment he turns his back on them, blasting a cracked hole into the blacboard. Daddiere wryly retorts with, ""Well...whoever threw that will never play centerfield for the Yankees."" This is our introduction to the likes of Artie West, more than convincingly played by the late Vic Morrow, a vicious punk whose demeanor instantaneously reveals that it is lkely that he'll not live a day beyond his twenty-first birthday. Then there is Gregory Miller, smoothly played by Sidney Poitier-a cool black cat who knows the score and is inherently decent. Daddiere smells this in him and encourages him to put his keenness to good use rather than waste his potential by being a lowlife like West and the rest of hs ilk. But Miller's race justifies his roguery, and he remains a sympathetic character for the duration. Then there is Bilozzi, a frightened punk and who takes sides with West because he's too afraid to be his own man and think for himself. I really admired this film, as it credibly depicted one man's quest to teach the unteachable, even though he well realizes that it is an unwinnable battle. Glenn Ford's performance is astonishingly good. His character seethes with a relentless desire to achieve his goal despite whatever these delinquents do to deter him. Louis Calhern also turns in a wonderful performance as a jaded, veteran history teacher who serves as a type of Greek chorus for Daddiere, constantly reminding him from the start that all that is does not glitter. When Daddiere insists to him at one point that ""If only I could just reach them...get inside their minds!"", Calhern wittily replies, ""Mind? A mind would indicate the presence of a brain!"". For anyone considering teachingin the New York City public school system, please watch this film SEVERAL times, for despite the fact that it is almost fifty years-old, it is by no means a dated film.",971136000,10,2550,4.784580498866213

Hot Toasty Rag, November 12, 2017

Glenn Ford is a teacher, sent to a boys high school in a bad neighborhood. After a disastrous first day, hes temped to leave and try and find work in another area. But, as he and his pregnant wife Anne Francis know, theres no position available anywhere else. If there were, he would have gone there in the first place. So, as his fellow teachers Louis Calhern, Margaret Hayes, and Richard Kiley, advise him, he just has to keep his head down and survive the school year. Theyre not teaching boys who have dreams of college, a career, or a lustrous life; their students are hoodlums who get in daily fights and bring knives to class.

Glenn Ford was such a prolific actor and made memorable classics in several genres, but Blackboard Jungle is one of his most iconic roles. Hes naturally sincere and passionate and delivers his lines so convincingly its as if he thought of them on the spot instead of reciting Richard Brookss script. When he tries to help the lost-cause students, you're inspired, when he singles out one of the kids to try and get an ally in the classroom, you see the same potential, and when he finally looses his temper, you're similarly enraged.

While there have been dozens of remakes throughout the decades about a do-good-er teacher who is sent to a school in the slums and tries to make a difference, Blackboard Jungle was the first. It was particularly gritty for its time, but even now its still extremely suspenseful and hard to watch. As if the boundary-pushing subject matter wasn't reason enough to make this classic famous, it propelled Sidney Poitier to stardom. It wasn't his first movie, but the film was nominated for four Oscars and became very famous. In case youve never seen this film and naturally assumed Sidney was cast as the noble teacher because of his famous classic To Sir, with Love, which is one of the more famous remakes in the genre, hes actually one of the unruly students! So if youve only seen him in strictly good-guy roles, you might want to rent this one and see him in a different part.

Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to gritty violence I wouldnt let my kids watch it. Also, there may or may not be a rape scene.",1510444800,,2288,4.6004901960784315

7864435,5,6304196873,"I enjoyed this movie greatly and was surprised by it.  I am a high school English teacher and a big rock and roll fan, so this one has been on my must see list for years.  Heres what stood out :

***PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD

-Notable character subtlety uncommon for films from that era (even great ones like *Rebel Without a Cause* or *The Wild One*).  The viewer never quite knows where Glenn Fords Mr. Dadier will go next.  Will he get angry?  Will he laugh at the students jokes (jokes made at his expense)?  Whats happening with his shifting emotions?  Will he suddenly reveal his own muted racism (as he does at one point toward Sidney Poitiers Gregory Miller, an African American student whom Dadier champions)?  Ford keeps you guessing  its a great performance.  (This can be said of Sidney Poitier, Vic Morrow, and other cast members as well.)

-Although the film exhibits that 1 1/3rd speed fast-paced rhythm and high drama that appears in any pre-New Hollywood movie that Ive seen, theres also a stunning presence of realism as in people who actually talk the way people talk and behave like people behave.  This film is real.

-Remarkably progressive  theres actual discussions of education philosophy at a time when most certification programs were just rubber stamp pathways to the classroom.  This can be noted in the acknowledgement from Dadiers professor that the theoretical university classes did nothing to prepare the teachers for the actual classroom (or at least a classroom with reluctant learners).  These ivory tower criticisms of education programs continue to this day.  Also, theres a discussion on how to engage students.  The visual learning being discussed parallels todays progressive strategies, such as cooperative learning and effective use of technology.  Theres also the argument that students really are hungry to learn under the right conditions.

-I was stunned to hear the N word twice and I wonder how the filmmakers pulled it off with the film studio or any would-be censors.  As we know, 1950s America was seeped with racism, but this ugly fact wasn't something Hollywood or the broadcast networks wanted to admit, much less confront.  Quite remarkable to see such gutsiness and candor in this film.

-Despite the willingness of the movie to shine a light on racism as well as growing concerns about juvenile unrest, theres still a cringeworthy sexist lecture that Dadier delivers to his wife Anne regarding how his intelligence and her good looks is what makes them a great team.  In other parts of the film women are presented in standard gender roles for the time, so not much headway is made there unfortunately.

-Two other elements that would be easily recognized in todays schools : 1) Administration and staff that is rusted or burned out, but - in some cases - can still be persuaded to care ; 2) The consequences of teen illiteracy.

-The acknowledgement that some kids just may in fact be so damaged that they will damage others, and simple human compassion and understanding may bring about greater injustices when dealing with such individuals.  This is seen with Vic Morrows Artie West, who ultimately is held accountable for his nefarious actions.  Its a breakthrough moment for Dadier because he realizes West must face consequences.  No teacher can succeed if s/he is not willing to put his or her foot down on the Arties of the classroom.

The Blackboard Jungle respects teenagers and teachers, and is one of the most honest films I have ever seen, which is all the more impressive considering the era in which it was made.  This should be required viewing in all education programs.",1502496000,2,3640,4.914754098360656
