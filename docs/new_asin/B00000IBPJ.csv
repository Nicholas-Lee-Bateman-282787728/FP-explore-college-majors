7910141,3,B00000IBPJ,"Low budget for sure, but it grows into an effective little film. You know towards the end of Night of the Living Dead where the red necks are shooting anything that moves? It has some of that flavor. Though I'm sure another Romero film, The Crazies, had a more direct influence. The infected army team does a good job of drawing you into their plight and the night time fire fight is the most authentic I've seen since Viet Nam. This is a tidy little film and a good deal for the price.",1251417600,,486,4.236559139784946
7910142,3,B00000IBPJ,"Despite other bad reviews about this filmm, I consider it to be a difficult plot at the start with a bit of poor sound quality, but after a few minutes the sound is great in digital & after twenty minutes the plot certainly livens up to a full blown, believable action film, you really have to put yourself in the actors positions to make this film fantastic, note: my copy was sent to 'england' where it was opened, unwrapped & maybe watched by the customs authorities who then forwarded it on with inspected stickers all over the case. buy it, it could be you.",988329600,3,562,4.413461538461538
7910143,1,B00000IBPJ,"Im a bad action movie fan but this is bad and i mean really bad. The picture quality and acting are subpar, it's just hard to watch but i did. I can watch movies over and over,doub't i'll sit through this again. Gave it  one star 'cause i had to, Spend your money on ROGUE FORCE, much better bang  for your buck. Stars Robert Patrick (the other terminator from terminator  2)",953942400,,375,4.253521126760563
7910144,5,B00000IBPJ,This is an intresting movie. The cast is great although Denis Hopper is predictable. They have these weird gestures and expressions that add to the movie. Pause the movie every minute or so and you will be in for a great  suprise of bubbling laughter.,921542400,2,251,4.5777777777777775
