I am Jewish and I liked that the film showed an agricultural side. I was hoping to learn more about his family and life. You do get short snippets about his family, but for a documentary- I guess I wanted to know more. It looked like the film was filmed by a friend of his perhaps? It would have been nice to see him in more settings beside the barn and in the local bar singing. Perhaps a Shabbat dinner?",1498521600,,608,4.066666666666666

There is so much talk these days about ""following your bliss"" and here's a guy who is actually doing it with his vocation as a cowboy, his folk music, and in helping to raise his daughter!  All in all a very inspirational and well made (thank you, Bonnie Burt and company) documentary!",1424044800,,297,4.381818181818182
