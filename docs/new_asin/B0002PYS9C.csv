8030295,3,B0002PYS9C,"As a tremendous fan of 1920s German horror and of Conrad Veidt, I struggle with how to recommend Student of Prague.  ""Uneven,"" is truly the word that best comes to mind.

The Production:

It's easy to look at a lackluster production like this one and say to oneself ""well, it was 1926,"" and yet Murnau's Faust and Lang's Metropolis were being produced at the same time.  Granted, those were monumentally expensive films, but this one still feels unimpressive in its scope.  If not for a few particularly sytlized shots from director Henrik Galeen and the contributions of lead actors Conrad Veidt and Werner Krauss, this film really wouldn't have felt all that different from its 1913 predecessor.

The Acting/Directing:

As stated above, Galeen pulls off a few truly impressive Expressionist shots in the film, and yet there are still too many visually uninteresting scenes that just lull.  Veidt brings great passion to the role, but it's really Werner Krauss as the Faustian tempter who makes his mark on the film.  I never cared much for Krauss in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cabinet-of-Dr-Caligari/dp/6305075492/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</a>, but he truly makes the film with profound and enthusiastic wickedness that Galeen seems to savor with his camera.  I'd say this film is worth viewing for that performance alone.

The Release:

I give Alpha tremendous credit for rescuing this film and, for the time being, there aren't any other versions to choose from.  The image is passably clean and viewable, but the soundtrack utterly kills me, featuring an overly repetitive synthesizer and entirely out of place Spanish guitar that do not correspond to the action of the film nearly as much as they should.  Sometimes a bad soundtrack can utterly kill the pace, dramatic action, and coherence of a silent film, and I think that is the case here.  It was truly laborious getting through this film, and I think that soundtrack, along with inter-title cards that would be impossible to read on anything other than a wide screen TV, are largely responsible for this.

Overall:

I'd hardly call this a must-see film, and if, by the time you are reading this review, there's a restored version out there that wasn't done by Alpha, I'd definitely recommend getting it, but, in the meantime, this is a pretty middle of the road DVD to pick up, both because of its content and because of what Alpha has done with it.  Some fans out there can't get enough of Conrad Veidt, and others will absolutely appreciate Werner Krauss' command performance, but this was hardly a film that I consistently enjoyed, and I don't expect your mileage to vary greatly.",1359849600,,2726,5.1289592760181
8030296,3,B0002PYS9C,"this review obviously has to be in two parts. the quality of the movie and the quality of the CD rendering of that movie.

(CD Rendering) the music added to this was just monotonous, unimaginative and brooding. seldom if ever matching the flavour of the movie....but then the movie's flavour was kind of weird too.
I've several of this companies CD movies and had pretty good luck so far but I had to reload this one several times...but that might be a fluke, but I reloaded the movie and each time I had to reload it 4 or 5 times to get it to actualy load. Still I was able to so.
Once again in translating the movie...assuming this was translated...they destroy the original dialogue cards and put in black screens with typewritten dialogue. so Sadly the original flavour is gone, and to make it worse the typed words were quite small, almost difficult to read. and no imagination even in the font used.

(The movie itself)I wonder sometimes if they make movies because they can...they come up with an idea for a special effect and then play with it even if their premice is just rediculous. ( I won't spoil what they did) The footage seems in almost perpetual telescope view...as it was dark around the edges a large proportion of the time. Though the story wasn't hard to follow, it was just a weird story, with no reason for the events to have taken place....no logic, and it seemed driven by a dark mind to just screw up someone's life for no reason whatsoever. Lets make some faustian guy pick some guy out of a hat and make his life weird...heck let's just ruin it. There was one part where the what...Villan? does some strange antics and you wonder what's going on...and the action appears to follow his antics. It was at this point I realized it was clever and at the same time downright strange and I knew then I was in for a somewhat bizzarre film. One bizzare effect was when the Villan closed his eyes...his lids were really weird.

This is an early...weird horror? artsie film? If your into weird... hey fill your boots, if you looking for something that makes sence, has a happy ending, the villan gets his just deserts and the hero rides off with his girl type movie...look somewhere else. Truly the product of a darkened soul.",1328486400,,2244,4.522167487684729
8030297,5,B0002PYS9C,"The story of the Student of Prague is everyone's story in that it answers that immortal question:

What would you sell your soul for?

For Balduin, played by the estimable Conrad Veidt, the sale price was a mere 600 pieces of gold (I wondered why not 666 pieces?) which turned out to be enough money to improve his material station such that he was able faithfully court the woman of his dreams.

As I say, and as this movie shows, Balduin only improved his material station with the money.  As can be seen throughout this film the original poor Balduin was rich in character and abilities and it was only through his own eyes that a lack of money left him...well...lacking.

It's therefore both interesting and ironic that the way in which this movie visualized Balduin's lack of soul was by eliminating his mirror image.  Interesting enough, this movie did this trick through the time honored (but still effective) technique of connecting two idential rooms with nearly identical actors miming on both sides of ""the mirror"" thereby creating the trick.

On the whole I actually found this film stronger for the problems with the DVD quality.  These silent movies, especially the silent horror movies, gain an added gravitas when one is forced to view them as Alpha presents this video here with its obvious fog and visual production issues.

For those who like this movie I would also suggest F W Murnau's very excellent Faust wherein the title character (a la Christopher Marlowe and Goethe) makes his own deal with the devil with his very own set of similar consequences.",1320192000,,1574,4.8
8030298,5,B0002PYS9C,"The Student of Prague(1926) is one of the darkest and most emotional of the classic silent horror films,and a true masterpiece of cinema.
Unfortunately,Alpha Video has released a mediocre print of the film which hardly does it justice.

Many on here have already commented on that,but I must make one thing clear:it's also the only print available in North America.
So,until a new print becomes available,I will reccomend this film,for Alpha at least bothered to release it!

Originally filmed in 1913 with Paul Wegener(The Golem) and inspired by the short stories,""Tale of the German Student"" an ""William Willson"",this film version brings much more depth than any previous version.
Directed by ""Nosferatu's"" art director,the brilliant,enigmatic,Henrik Galeen,the movie follows the story of a young student who is in poverty and is hopelessly lost in love.
Along comes a mysterious man named Scapinelli,who offers him 600 pieces of gold in return for the student's reflection.
At first,things work fine for the student,until his doppelganger begins to tear his life apart...

Brilliantly handled,with a wonderful use of shadows and atmosphere,as Conrad Veidt(the student) world begins to colllapse around him.
Veidt is very sympathetic in the lead role,able to inject much pathos and humanity,and equally sinister qualities in his alter ego.
Werner Krauss,Dr. Caligari himself,is also well suited in the role of Scapinelli,the Mephistopheles character to Veidt's Faust.

I'm not quite sure why Kino or Image hasn't released this classic,yet,but hopefully we will see one of this(and it's 1913 blueprint)on better DVDs in the future.
Still,glad to have seen it at ALL.
Very classic horror film.
Highly reccomended.",1226966400,,1713,5.501901140684411
8030299,3,B0002PYS9C,"Alpha Video has released both versions of this interesting German silent film:  the first one made in 1913 with Paul Wegener in the lead role, and this later 1926 remake starring Conrad Veidt.  Obviously, filmmaking techniques developed rapidly in those 13 years, and silent films of the mid to late 1920s are much more in step with the modern day film format we are used to, making this 1926 version much more appealing to most viewers.  The picture quality, while significantly better than the 1913 version, is still a little poor in general, and the modern synthesizer music, while appropriate to the eerie theme, is not always well suited.  Nevertheless, the story itself might have enough value to outweigh these poor production aspects, especially for those fascinated by the horror/supernatural theme.  Based on an old novel, ""The Student of Prague"" is an intriguing story about a young man, a university student, who is broke and desperate, and succumbs to the offer of a strange and sinister man who offers him a large amount of money.  It turns out that he has, as it were, sold his soul to the devil by allowing the evil stranger to take the student's mirror reflection; his second self.  After this event, the student no longer has a reflection in any mirror, which is a general theme that has re-occurred in horror/supernatural stories for a long time, and no doubt is rooted in ancient black magic rites involving mirrors.  Having made a pact with the devil, the student's second self now appears as an apparition and it begins to ruin his life.  German Expressionism techniques of dark shadows and strong contrasts add to the eerie atmosphere, and Conrad Veidt plays the role whole-souled - even when his soul steps out of the mirror and takes on a life of its own!  After watching this 1926 version, I was able to go back and appreciate the 1913 version of ""The Student of Prague"" much more, even though it is only half the length of its later remake.  Anyone keenly interested in this theme and German silent films who can overlook poor production quality on budget-priced labels might also like to compare both versions.",1149811200,18,2138,4.798365122615804
8030300,3,B0002PYS9C,"Unfortunately, this is the only version of this film available on DVD, and like every other Alpha Video release it's a poor quality transfer from a video tape, complete with what look like VHS artifacts and no speed correction.  The music is the same repetative synthesizer drivel used in Alpha's 1917 Student of Prague DVD, and except for a few chance moments it does not match the action on screen.

The film itself is WONDERFUL.  One of my favorite silents, next to ""The Man Who Laughs.""  Conrad Veidt's expressive performance carries the film with his depiction of both Balduin, a very complex young man struggling with his desires and limitations, and of his shadow self, given it's own life through a deal with the devil.  Great cinematography and unusual camera work (for 1926) reminds me of Bunuel's ""Fall of the House of Usher,"" another high quality horror film from the same period.  There are some genuinely crepy scenes with the double and very emotional moments as Balduin realizes the full extent of what he's done.

In short, this DVD ranks five stars for content and zero stars for Alpha's lack of effort, but in my opinion is worth the low price to see such a fabulous film however flawed the presentation.",1130025600,17,1223,4.767772511848341
8030301,1,B0002PYS9C,"This is an excellent film, which unfortunately has not been given a decent treatment by the distributor.  I was very disapointed in the quality of the release- the picture quality is poor, inter-titles appear to be missing, and the score which has been added is just a repetition of long synth chords that don't match the action on-screen.  It's a shame, because a film like this one deserves much better.",1102896000,24,405,4.771428571428571
