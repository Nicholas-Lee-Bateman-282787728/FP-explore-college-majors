7912227,4,B00000JGOM,"Tokyo Blue plays out like any buddy cop movie with a pair of mismatched partners.  It just so happens that those partners happen to be two drop dead gorgeous women.  As an anime fan I noticed how Mika and Rin acted a lot like Kiyone and Mihoshi from the Tenchi Muyo series, but with a decidedly sexier twist.  Mika's the more serious of the two while Rin is the entertaining goofball.  The plot isn't anything to write home about but the verbal banter between Mika and Rin alone is unquestionably worth the price of admission.  On the technical side of things I wish a DVD version of this would come out with the original Japanese language track (though the English isn't bad).  The sound needs work because I found myself having to turn up the volume significantly.  I'd recommend this one over the sequel.  Mika and Rin are definitely the two sexiest cops I've ever seen.  If you love cop movies, action and beautiful women, then this one's for you.",1075420800,4,951,4.547058823529412
