8284790,1,B001BTOBHW,"I didn't realise James Blunt is a popular British singer; I also did not realise Mr. Blunt would include large clips of himself singing, as much or more of him singing than Kosovo itself.
THIS FILM WAS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. It's painfully obvious Mr. Blunt is  quite in love with himself-if I wanted a music video I certainly would not pick this. This is not a documentary. The closet thing to investigative reporting in this flop is the comment by Blunt himself: that British soldiers felt sorrow when disarming Serbs knowing ethnic Albanians would come in for the slaughter, with no way to defend themselves.

WASTE OF TIME, WASTE OF MONEY, YOU WILL LEARN NOTHING!",1301356800,,667,4.791304347826087
