846002,2,6304308604,This  DVD  is  ok  I  did  not  think  that  is  one  of  Joan  Crawford's  better  roles.,1284681600,3,90,3.75
846003,5,6304308604,"Joan Crawford followed up her performance in ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"" with this project. In actuality, ""The Caretakers"" was filmed weeks before ""Baby Jane"" went into production in 1962, and the producers and movie studio thought wisely about releasing ""The Caretakers"" after the former's release. Coming out in theatres in August, 1963, Joan plays a tough-as-nails head nurse in an insane asylum where she clashes with a reputable and kind psychiatrist, played by Robert Stack. Joan continues her descent playing strong, articulate women, and her character believes the only way to help patients is through padded cells and straight jackets. The psychiatrist wants the patients treated with dignity and respect, and this is where both he and Lucretia (the Crawford character) clashes. The movie is extremely graphic for its time as it dramatizes what goes on in mental wards. The film opens with a woman (played beautifully by Polly Bergen) named Lorna going crazy in a movie theatre, and her ultimate confinement in an insane asylum. Bergen actually steals the film from her co-stars as her performance as a woman bordering on the insane is both brilliant and bone-chilling; her scenes could be used in acting classes. Others in the cast include Susan Oliver as a kind and sensitive new nurse; Constance Ford as Lucretia's second-in-command nurse; Robert Vaughn as the husband of Lorna; and Janis Paige who plays a prostitute harboring a terrible secret. Most have forgotten ""The Caretakers"", but it is a well-acted and well-written film. The movie was nominated for an Oscar for Best Cinematography and this marks the first time it has appeared on DVD, after being released on VHS in 1996. ""The Caretakers"" comes in letterbox format.",1270857600,17,1744,5.166077738515901

846005,2,6304308604,A bit hokey for present day.  It plays like a made-for-tv pilot film through out.  The ending scene where staff and patients walk into their new facility is tailor made for continuing the characters in a television series.  I'd be real surprised if that was not someone's purpose.,1169337600,,280,4.791666666666667
846006,3,6304308604,"Joan plays Nurse Lucretia Terry in this 1960's shocker. Lucretia Terry is an unsympathetic and careless nurse, working in a mental hospital. I think the film would have been a lot better if Joan's character was developed more. It also lacked some type of substance and there wasn't really a climax. My favorite scene is when Joan is giving the self-defense class. She looks so cute in the black leotard. If you'd like to see Joan in a picture that she made later in her career (her older ones weren't all bad), then I recommend ""Straight-Jacket."" Nevertheless, even a bad picture (like ""Caretakers"") is still good if Joan Crawford is in it!",1142899200,6,640,4.723214285714286
846007,4,6304308604,"I won't say that ""The Caretakers"" is the greatest film ever made, but it is certainly not the worst. ""The Caretakers"" is the story of the struggle between a progressive doctor (Robert Stack), who wants to create a ""day hospital"" for ""borderline"" patients, and the old regime headed by Nurse Lucretia (Joan Crawford) and her team of nurses (including the terrific Constance Ford). All of the actresses who portray borderline patients are fabulous. Polly Bergen is Lorna, the woman tormented by the death of her son. Janis Paige plays Marion, the stubborn, hard tempered patient who encourages mischief among the others. Barbara Barrie is the mute patient who nearly burns the clinic down. Particularly good is Sharon Hugueny, who plays Connie, the sweet, lonely girl who, in a particularly poignant scene, pretends to read a letter from her mother, filled with lines about how much her family loves and misses her, only for the letter to be brutally exposed as a fake by Marion. Diane McBain and Susan Oliver are good as borderline nurses. There are many good scenes in ""The Caretakers"", but the overall film seems campy (the music seems better suited to ""Batman"" than a film about mental illness) and a bit anti-climactic, but still I recommend watching it to see the great performances given by Crawford, Ford, Paige, Barrie, and Hugueny!",1006992000,9,1339,4.982142857142857
846008,3,6304308604,"I was intrigued by this movie long before I ever saw it.  I had read many reviews of it (unfortunately, many disparaging ones), which whetted my appetite, and because I am a die-hard Joan Crawford fan, I eventually ordered it.  I thought, ""How bad can it be?"" Well, I'll say this right off.  It isn't as bad as everyone seems to think.  In fact, it's really quite good.  It is true that Joan Crawford's role (as a tough, conservative head nurse at the psychiatric hospital in which the film is set) is small, but her strong presence is still remarkable.  Everyone is very good, including leads Robert Stack (as a progressive-minded doctor at odds with Crawford) and Polly Bergen, as the patient through whose eyes the story unfolds.  Excellent, also, is Janis Paige as a loud-mouthed nymphomaniac in the ward. The direction is good and the theme (progressive care for mental patients vs. strait-jackets and shock treatments), manages to triumph in the end despite a few admitted cliches in the story.  The moody, atmospheric photography and evocative score by Elmer Bernstein do their parts in making this a film worth seeing, especially if you like to watch good acting and have a general interest in psychology, as I do.",984268800,8,1222,4.813397129186603

7868226,4,6304308604,"A complex study of women undergoing treatment in a state mental health care facility.  Their private lives and past associations are explored and
used as stepping-stones back to normality.  Robert Stack, often described as cold and detacvhed on scren, rre-invented himself here and provides a warm, compassionate and urturing performance.  Joan Crawford is ansoluter perfection as the nursing supervisor in conflict with the changing
times, polly bergen is very, very good as the distrurbed housewife who blames her child's death upon herself, robert vaughn is touching and quite
moving as Bergen's concerned and loving husband and herbert marshall is a most thoughtful hospital administrsator who debates the professional decisions made withjin his life.  Janis Paige, Barbara Barrie and Sharon Hugeny are equally impressive and most convincing as well.  Well worth the
viewing..",1425772800,,880,5.636363636363637
7868227,5,6304308604,"Got these flicks in the mail and just watched The Caretakers. So loved it! It's wonderful to see such a fine independent movie. Well-acted and an engrossing storyline. Thanks for making a smart, engaging, and original vampire story. Can't wait to watch Spirit Stalkers.",1419206400,,269,5.136363636363637
7868228,4,6304308604,I love watching the opening scene of Polly Bergen having a breakdown at the movie theatre. Joan Crawford is fiery in this post Baby Jane role. Movie arrived in very good condition with pristine packaging.,1418169600,,204,4.857142857142857
7868229,5,6304308604,A very good Movie overall.  Well worth buying for sure.  Susan Oliver and Robert Stack were brilliant!  I Liked it very much.,1361836800,,125,4.590909090909091
7868230,5,6304308604,"Joan Crawford makes The Caretakers for me. Constance Ford is also very good in a supporting role. As the head nurse Joan shows a lot of the drive she had to become a top star, in the way her character reacts to changes at the hospital.",1361750400,,235,4.130434782608695
7868231,1,6304308604,"Although I loved the movie, I would encourage no person to purchase this dvd. First of all, the sound quality is absolutely awful. I would expect with a dvd transfer to have dvd quality audio, the technology is there they need to stop cutting corners and finish the job. Further more, if you purchase this particular dvd, you will be purchasing a dvd-R, which is a cheap copy of a dvd. The picture quality is acceptable, but everything else about this supposed dvd is subpar. If you purchase it you will be wasting your money and will surely be dissapointed.",1344124800,2,558,4.59
7868232,3,6304308604,"Joan Crawford was the draw for me to be interested in the movie.  I also have always liked Constance Ford, who I think is very talented.  Certainly, the film depicts the evolution of treatment for mentally institutionalized patients, in contrast to ""The Snake Pit"" made roughly twenty years prior.  Polly Bergen's breakdown in the movie theatre is unforgettable and frightening.

Canterbury State Hospital is scary in and of itself, with the old elevators, and locked wards, and the symbolism--the comittment order with someone stamping in bold lettering ""INSANE"" all over the document legally confining Polly Bergen.

My only mild criticism (other than wishing Crawford had a more prominent role) was seemingly so much time spent in the ""borderline"" group therapy sessions, where the film seems to bog down a little and hence become repetitious.  A lot of the patients' predicaments are drawn out and protracted, yet only give a cursory glimpse into their lives.  I would have liked to have seen more debate or discussion amongst Crawford and Ford, v. Stack and the ambiguous administrator.  Nevertheless, it's worth watching and owning!",1304035200,2,1138,5.248618784530387
7868233,3,6304308604,"An enjoyable melodrama with some insight into how those with mental issues were treated. This was Ms Crawford's next movie (completed) after ""whatever happened to baby jane"" and she is fab as a steely and determined nurse. The movie is worth watching for the judu scence alone",1293580800,2,276,4.8936170212765955
