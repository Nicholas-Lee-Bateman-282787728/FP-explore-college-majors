2530629,5,B000ERHFW0,"This is my favorite of the three I bought. I was a total beginner and its been only one month.. already my boyfriend is saying, ""wow you got good so fast.."" - and i feel it too - i feel much stronger and the moves feel more and more natural to me. I like that Ansuya describes each move clearly and simply - what a nice contrast to other teachers who are way over word-y. Just remember to reverse each move - Ansuya doesn't remind you but this never bothered me. This is a great value - more expensive than other dvds i bought but it feels like i could study it forever! Thank you Ansuya, your natural feminine essence is inspiring... and your skill and experience shine through!",1234051200,12,679,4.271317829457364
2530630,4,B000ERHFW0,"Ansuya has great technique and it's a pleasure watching this dvd.
Still, I find it hard to actually learn her moves - but that could just be me of course. I wouldn't recommend this dvd to a beginner, though. Basically, all she does is say 'this is how the move is done' and then shows it. I would have liked a bit more instruction.
(And, on the contrary to an earlier review, to which I agree on most points, I did find the 'bloopers' funny ;) )",1225756800,7,445,4.126436781609195
2530631,5,B000ERHFW0,Ansuya is my wednesday night teacher.  I practice to her religiously every wednesday in my living room.  I use so many of her combos in my choreographies.  She is an excellent teacher.  Very easy to understand.  I love all of her dvds.  The other reviews on this page are excellent.  I would recommend Ansuya for sure to anybody who wants to learn fun moves for their routines.,1206576000,8,377,4.537313432835821
2530632,5,B000ERHFW0,"I have never done this (belly dance) before.  That being said, I like this video.  I like the way she turns around so you can see her from all angles.  I would recommend this video. Once I get rid of all the bones in my body, I will be just as fluid as she is.",1197936000,12,260,3.690909090909091
2530633,5,B000ERHFW0,I also think this is a great practice dvd. In the beginning she shows beginner moves and moves on to layering. Even a more advanced bellydancer would get something out of this. It is a little higher priced than alot of bellydance dvds but there is alot of information here. I like that she shows the moves from the back too.,1189123200,13,324,4.327868852459017
2530634,5,B000ERHFW0,This is a great dvd is you are beyound the basics and are ready for adding layering.  Ansuya is just phenominal!,1188604800,3,112,4.333333333333333
2530635,5,B000ERHFW0,"I'm a belly dance student who takes lessons at the famed Serena Studios. Many people are teaching belly dance who have bad technique coupled with no teaching skills.

Ansuya has excellent technique and great personality which is why she is one of the belly dance superstars.

Good video for beginners.",1184889600,34,301,5.0
2530636,5,B000ERHFW0,"This is the practice companion I was looking for. Gorgeous drills and quality instruction. No more, no less. No ""no-brainers"" like ""warming up"" or stretching. No uncalled-for choreography. No excessive talking. No long pauses between exercises. Ansuya goes straight to the point.

This program is very well thought-out. Ansuya patiently repeats each isolation for you a number of times, but makes sure you don't get bored with it, by moving on to a different isolation right on time. Then she leads the whole set of exercises at a somewhat higher tempo - twice. Then layering is practiced, giving you another 3 rounds of exercises. During the first round, each figure is repeated a few times again, followed by a brief shimmy review, and then the two are combined. The next 2 rounds you drill them only combined. So whether I am in the mood for a quickie, or feel like exercising for a while, I never have to think how to organize my workout. I never have to pause to rewind or skip sections. I simply follow Ansuya, knowing that I can rely on a balanced workout no matter when I stop.

Is this video a good place to start for an absolute beginner? I believe it's the best video for both total novices and advanced students! Don't be intimidated by the title. Ansuya proceeds quite wisely. She does an excellent job of teaching the correct posture. More difficult figures are first broken into components, and each component is drilled-in. The pace feels just right. Ansuya starts reasonably slow (but definitely not so slow that it makes you feel impatient), and gradually picks up speed. She provides many, many helpful verbal pointers. Even if you ignore the whole layering part, you'll still get plenty of exercising. The camerawork is perfect: everything is seen very clearly.

I consider Ansuya the most graceful Cabaret style bellydancer, and it gives me immense pleasure to learn from the Master. It also helps that she is one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen, so I just can't take my eyes off her. Her voice and intonation are exceptionally pleasant too.

That said, could this DVD have been even better? Yes:
1. During the first round of exercises, Ansuya turns around a little too often (trying to show how the moves look from each side). I think a better solution would have been editing with ""two Ansuyas"" on the screen shown from two different angles. This would allow *me* to decide when it's time to switch attention to another angle.
2. Doing circles, she doesn't tell you when you are supposed to reverse the direction (and it's not easy to tell just by looking at her, as she turns several times, so it's confusing). You may end up practicing one direction while overlooking the other.
3. The sound volume changes a few times during the program.

But I've quickly adapted to these shortcomings, and I find this workout to be the closest to ideal I've come across so far.",1152662400,160,2899,4.732673267326732

8113534,5,B000ERHFW0,One of my absolute favorites. I hope she doesn't up her price on these videos of hers because I would recommend them to any adept dancer...,1399507200,,139,4.384615384615385

8113536,5,B000ERHFW0,Ansuya does a great job with this video! She breaks down a lot of basic moves and then drills them. Really helped me learn how to do camels/body rolls. Also teaches combos clearly and easily. My teacher had loaned me this video and then needed it back so I bought my own!,1364947200,,271,4.230769230769231
8113537,5,B000ERHFW0,I have purchaced several belly dancing DVDs. This is the best. she really breaks own each movement in detail and with enough repetition to really learn it. No rewinding ever two minutes.,1361750400,,186,4.84375
8113538,5,B000ERHFW0,"great price, very valuable learning dvd, with ansuyas' great style of instruction. i love how she shows moves from several angles and explains layering in classroom like setting,gypsy.",1316822400,,184,5.607142857142857
8113539,2,B000ERHFW0,"This was the first in a series of bellydance DVDs I've purchased recently. It was fine for practice, but once I bought a couple of others I realized how bland, not well-thought-out and kind of lazy this DVD is. The drills are unimaginative, you get some good basics practice in the beginning but the explanations aren't that thorough if you're a beginner, and both the structure and the content pale in comparison to other DVDs I've purchased. If it were $20 cheaper, I'd say go for it, but as expensive as it is I wouldn't get it again. In fact, since all of the material she covers can be found on my other DVDs, I will probably sell this one back. I have no problem with Ansuya- she was engaging and her performance at the end was great, and I plan at some point in the future to purchase her ""Hot Combinations,"" but I feel like ""Lavish Layers"" wasn't worth the money I spent on it.",1307059200,15,885,4.337349397590361
8113540,3,B000ERHFW0,"this is a good dvd however, she doesn't spend much time on each view so it is hard to make sure you are doing it right.",1301443200,,119,3.6153846153846154
8113541,3,B000ERHFW0,"You can tell that the instructor is professional and appreciates practicing the moves through repetition. However, I became very bored with it after an hour. She taught certain moves that I caught on to very quickly and spent too much time on practicing each move. Then, each move that was taught was later enhanced with a shimmy (fast shaking). Repetition is good because it is hard to add the shimmy with it, but it was so boring to me.",1258848000,4,438,4.556962025316456
8113542,5,B000ERHFW0,"This is an excellent drills DVD. This can be used by a beginner, but it is fantastic for dancers who have the basic moves and are learning to layer them. I'd recommend you work with a live teacher when first learning layering because it seems like it is easy to lose your bellydance posture while doing two moves at once. That being said, this will help you improve your stamina, and your layering. I'm very pleased with this DVD and I own quite alot of them. This is a perfect bridge to use when moving from isolations to layers.",1244937600,3,530,4.363636363636363
