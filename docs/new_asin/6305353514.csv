7888489,5,6305353514,"pulp is one of my favorite bands, and i knew before watching this video that mr jarvis cocker is awe-inspiringly intelligent and interesting...but i didn't know he danced!!  not only does this show include some great songs (mostly from ""this is hardcore""), but jarvis dances through the whole thing.  and this is not self-conscious, utterly choreographed, intently concentrating dancing.  oh, no.  jarvis dances with complete abandon and wild jubilation.  his dancing is the highlight of the video.  the songs are great, but the dancing is the icing on the cake.",982713600,2,562,5.188888888888889

Pulp, namely Jarvis is so entertaining and so energetic that by the end of this video the only disappointment is that there is no more  to watch. Pulp fans get this immediately. Jarvis is in fine form.",953683200,4,286,4.296296296296297
7888491,5,6305353514,"This video simply is a brilliant piece of artwork, music and entertainment. It shows Jarvis, maybe the greatest entertainer on earth at his very best. It is a must for all  Pulp-fans, it combines this great  music with motion and atmosphere. I think I must have watched it about 60  or 70 times.!",947203200,4,296,4.547169811320755
