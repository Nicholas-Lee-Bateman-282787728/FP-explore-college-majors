Personally I found that most of the vision around this level of networking is almost an enmeshment of personal and business life.  In the book the author argues that this is how he is most happy.

As an introvert I find the idea of texting friends during seminars... just to keep the contact warm a little disconcerting.  For me time with people is draining, not exillerating as it is for the author and most extraverts.  I simply don't have the energy to devote so much of my existance to casual relationships.

While I appreciated the book, I think this is a book for the ""connector"" personality type described in Malcom Gladwell's book tipping point.  This is a person that loves people, but spreads themselves so thin they can never connect deeply with anyone.

The auther talks about suddenly finding himself divorced and how he used his connections to quickly find someone else to be with.  For me this was very sad and seemed to emphasize the inbalance in the authors life in regards to truely understanding other people.",1276387200,,1146,4.661691542288557
8178005,2,B000NIWG6U,"You are better off spending your money on the book, which is excellent.  The DVD is too short for the money.  In addition it gives only a cursory introduction to the material.  In the book, the author goes into much greater detail and outlines the methods to work his principles into your daily life.",1185840000,7,300,4.518518518518518
8178006,5,B000NIWG6U,"I was a non-believer in the whole networking strategy to business success, I was so blinded by my own ego that I didn't see that business and life success are both intimately tied to having better and more relationships with people.  Keith's coaching in Never Eat Alone helped me realize that there are ways to ""network"" for your benefit without being sleezy, rather by being generous and genuine.  This books learnings are so foundational to success and tactics so easily put into practice that I've employed them in the building of my small business and its been a major factor in my success.

My favorite sections to Never Eat Alone (the ones that continually reverberate in my head) are:

- Build it before you need it

- Don't keep count

& Share your Passions

There is no more useful business book or video on the market today.",1179273600,2,834,4.63265306122449
