8232527,4,B000YFDPBM,"Shocking but seems a little biased - This coming from someone who despises Cheney/Bush and wishes they would be hanged for their  war crimes. That being said, if only half of what is in this is true it's incredibly shocking and disturbing.  Anyone who actually cares about why we destroyed millions of peoples lives will already know most of the truth but this documentary will surprise you with just how far our government and it's corporate puppet masters will go to make a buck.  Warning - it's not a feel good movie. Unless you like to be reminded that your are part of the expendable peasant class.",1413676800,,603,4.616822429906542
8232528,1,B000YFDPBM,"There is a forged document that is distributed on the CD that accompanies this video.  That ""Memorandum to General Groves"" not only has nothing to do with depleted uranium, but also is forged.  Douglas Rokke and Leuren Moret, two of the characters who appear in this DVD have pushed this forged document on as evidence that the US first conceived of using DU as a radiological weapon in 1943.  That is totally preposterous.  DU is not a radiological weapon.  DU kinetic energy penetrators were developed because nothing else would penetrate modern tank armor and the Soviets had thousands of modern tanks poised on the German border that were expected to Blitzkrieg their way to the North Sea if there was no way to stop them at the beginning of World War III.  Saddam Hussein had thousands of modern Soviet tanks and a battle hardened Army but DU gave the US/UK tank the ability to shoot farther and penetrate the Iraqi tank's armor with one shot and one kill.  That brought a lot of American/UK tank crew members home alive and unhurt.  Saddam wanted to make the US/UK look like bigger ogres than he was and he wanted to eliminate this weapon that had destroyed his formerly potent armored force so he began spreading big lies about depleted uranium.  Rokke has also falsely claimed Israeli use of DU in 1973; they did not face modern tanks; they faced WW-II, Korean War vintage tanks and they did not need DU, which had not even been fielded by the US Army yet and he claimed it was used in Lebanon in US provided bunker busters.  Any careful researcher will quickly learn that there is no DU in any bomb and that there are no DU-tipped bunker busters.  They will also learn that Rokke is a fraud, claiming to have been far more important than he actually was.  He never tells you that he was a Reserve First Lieutenant who knew a little physics who got attached to the DU clean up group, no he tells you that he headed the group and that members of the group got sick and died from DU.  That is not true and he was the most junior member of the group, not its head.  Rokke also appeared at a rather interesting gathering where he was introduced by Dave Von Kleist, who is behind the production of this DVD and who heavily pushes it through the on-line American Gulf War Veterans Association.  I urge any of you who are Jewish or who have Jewish friends to visit this blog, where they exude joy over the way they treated a couple of Rabbis who were conned into coming to this American Free Press/The Barnes Review Neo Nazi event where Rokke is introduced by Von Kleist.

A reviewer also has gotten it really wrong when he claims that DU kinetic energy penetrators emerge flaming from the barrel of the cannon.  They do not become pyrophoric until they hit the target armored vehicle.  DU is not pyrophoric unless it is in fine particle form.  It does not become pyrophoric while the penetrator is enroute to the target tank.  The A10 30mm penetrator is also shrouded in aluminum and remains that way according to reports from the Balkans where large numbers of intact aluminum shrouds were picked up even up to seven years after they had been fired by the A10 aircraft.  The M1A1 Abrams Tank's 120mm DU penetrator is a sabot; that means that part of the round falls off when it leaves the barrel; that part that falls off keeps the DU penetrator from contacting the cannon's barrel and keeps the penetrator intact until it hits the target tank.

To learn more about depleted uranium, go to [...]  or the Yahoo Group DUStory.  Message 88 has links to international scientific reports and they have photos of intact aluminum shrouded 30mm penetrators etc.",1229904000,2,3663,4.572741194486984
8232529,5,B000YFDPBM,"I sought out this documentary because it is one of the very few that discuss depleted uranium. This stuff is the toxic waste from nuclear weapons and power plants, and it has a half life of more than a BILLION (with a B!) years. Troops are told that it is safe, despite the fact that it continuously emits ""low"" levels of ionizing radiation. They travel inside vehicles armored with it, and they use it for munitions because it's heavier than lead and hence armor-piercing.

DU is pyrophoric, bursting into flame upon impact. It burns in the target, emitting radioactive smoke for all to breathe. We have now converted tons of the stuff (U238) to microscopic particles all over Iraq and eventually dispersing around the globe to affect us all. There is a vast increase in birth defects in Iraq and, to a lesser extent, in returning troops.

Are our troops safer with or without DU? Is the world a better place with or without it? I think depleted uranium ought to be headline news with angry mobs demonstrating, and yet our media ignore it and few people ever hear about it. Watch & learn.

I appreciate and respect several detailed 1-star reviews and suggest that you read them AND WATCH THE DVD and then form your OWN opinions. Reviews by more veterans would be helpful.

This DVD touches on the military's history of chemical, biological, immunological, and radiological experiments on soldiers and then moves on into the first & second Iraq wars.

The movie's website offers a FREE DVD to any U.S. veteran.

I don't know why veterans have given this DVD such a hostile review when it advocates for their benefit. From my perspective, this documentary is intended as a service to spread awareness of our government's abuse and neglect of our veterans with the hope that we give them the better treatment they deserve. 50,000 of our heroes died in Vietnam, but MORE THAN 50,000 Vietnam Vets have since committed suicide! 200 soldiers died in the first gulf war, but 200,000 have applied for disability.

Veterans issues are not a conservative/liberal issue but rather a unanimous agreement that they deserve our gratitude, respect, and enduring support. The political agenda in this DVD is only to demand that the chicken hawks in Washington be held accountable for their treasonous abuses of our military personnel.

(A friend of mine died of bone cancer 20 years after being marched to ground zero at a Nevada atomic test site, and we believe that radiation was a likely cause.)

The movie says that Gulf War Syndrome from the FIRST gulf war is likely related to our destruction and consequent aerosolization of chemical and biological munitions that we supplied to Saddam (to fight Iran) in our haste to destroy the evidence. Rumsfeld was CEO of Searle (Pharma) when he went as Bush's WMD ""sales rep"" to meet Saddam shortly before the alliance soured.

In Iraq (2003), they say, chemical alarms were ignored, MOP suits were crummy, soldiers were often ordered not to suit up, etc.

You won't find this perspective in the news. Watch it here!",1227744000,15,3046,4.816091954022989
8232530,4,B000YFDPBM,"Of course the content of this video is for viewer to judge. And you should judge for yourself if content of what is presented is true or at least worth keeping in mind. Whatever the case, this video presents (presumably) evidence to prove that military have experimented on its own soldiers. They tried new questionable 'vaccinations' which led to sickness of soldiers.

If this sort of stuff is interesting for you (not necessarily if you believe it), try also ""History's Mysteries - Mind Control: America's Secret War"" by History Chanel. That video is about CIA experimenting on public.

Whether you agree or not, I think it is worth watching. At least you can take with the grain of salt.",1223251200,4,691,4.798319327731092
