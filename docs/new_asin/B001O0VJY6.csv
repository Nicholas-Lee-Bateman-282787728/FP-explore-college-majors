The individual chapters provide a close-up look at  the work of modern quilt artists, with a couple of chapters on historic quilt-making methods. Bonus extras include high-resolution image files of over seventy award-winning quilts and a PDF file listing methods and inspirations for each one.",1235520000,,404,5.2153846153846155
8328645,5,B001O0VJY6,"This video documentation is a wonderful highlight of the featured artists and the magnificent array of quilts on display at the annual quilt festival in Birmingham, UK.  The narrators take you step by step thru each chapter, and clearly explain the artists and sections featured in the production.  I enjoyed the interview with hand quilter Lilian Hedley and the demonstration workshop from Phillppa Naylor as well as Dorothy Caldwell from Canada whose work is so inspirational.  The Festival of Quilts really is a textile and quilting arts show, and this DVD does a great job illustrating the diversity of talent on display and amongst the teachers. The close-ups of all the winning quilts with the names of the winners by category was very well put together.  A reference for design inspiration from the enclosed image files is helpful for quilters.  Maybe more examples of quilts would give a broader view of the field in Europe.",1230681600,3,932,4.987096774193549
8328646,3,B001O0VJY6,"The Birmingham Festival of Quilts is one of the world's largest with over 1200 juried quilts on display. This film showcases the featured artists from the 2008 show, including segments filmed in their studios. I think the dvd would be better titled Featured Artists from the 2008 Festival of Quilts. With a clearer title I wouldn't have expected I'd see the show itself. Worth a look.",1230595200,,384,4.833333333333333
