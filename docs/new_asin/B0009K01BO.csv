8174968,4,B0009K01BO,"NUTHSELL: ""GENIUS ENT."" ALSO OFFERS THESE 7 TUNES WITH 7 MORE TUNES ON 1 DVD CALLED CARTOON CLASSICS!

In a thin secure plastic case, we get 7 looney tune cartoons, an hour's worth, that are promised to be remastered, featuring ""WOODY WOODPECKER"", ""LITTLE LULU"", ""BABY HUEY"" and some lesser known characters. Some are in color, and they were made mostly around World War 2.

About the remastering: these don't look nearly as clean or new as the newly released ""Golden Collection"" and ""Spotlight Selection"" by Looney Tunes. Of course, this DVD is much less expensive, having been produced by ""Genius entertainment"" the company that owns ""American Movie Classics"" and ""TV Guide"", a company that offers a large number of older films on DVD [mostly public domain] for very low prices, but still mostly decent quality transfers and which are mostly excellent values.

7 EPISODES:

--*-1] Woody Woodpecker -""Pantry Picnic""
--*-2] Little Lulu - ""Cad and Caddy""
--*-3] Mighty Mouse - ""Wolf! Wolf!""
--*-4] Mutt and Jeff - ""Westward Whoa""
--*-5] Mutt and Jeff - ""Slick Sleuths""
--*-6] Baby Huey - ""Pest Pupil""
--*-7] Baby Huey - ""Quack-A-Doodle-Doo""

Most of the series put out by Genius entertainment are pretty good, including this one. But they do have these episodes included on 1 DVD titled ""Classic Cartoons"" which adds 7 more cartoons and plays for over 2 hours. The UPC for that title is ""7-96019-76009-6"". I found it at a DOLLAR TREE in southern Indiana last year for $1. on an end-cap, in the front of the store, where they still sell similar products throughout the U.S. in most DOLLAR TREE'S.

The cover-art has a large mostly red ""Woody Woodpecker"" holding ""Mighty Mouse"" in his palm with ""Little Lulu"" waving from the seated position atop the letter ""S"" for ""CLASSIC CARTOON'S'"", with her legs crossed as she waves with her right hand.
