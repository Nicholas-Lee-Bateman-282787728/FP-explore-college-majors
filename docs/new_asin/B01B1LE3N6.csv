7616616,5,B01B1LE3N6,"Dolph Ziggler is a hard hitting, street smart, no nonsense, rough and tumble cop with a hardcore take no prisoners attitude and a mean superkick. Kane (who may be of the Corporate or Demon variety) is a staunch police chief or other similarly ranked official with an exceptionally strong grip. These stars will have to somehow work in proximity to get police things done and team with a lady cop that might actually just be from the legal team to beat down a Russian arms dealer and defuse a bomb before the COUNTDOWN reaches zero and the bomb does what bombs do best.

7616618,3,B01B1LE3N6,"We have a bomb strapped to a kid somewhere in the city that only an unidentified dead man knows the location of, and we have 6 hours and 42 minutes to find him. Ray (Ziggler) is a detective who hasn't been the same since he lost his son. He keeps crossing the line and is finally facing suspension. When he finds out that a young boy has been kidnapped and strapped to a bomb he ignores his suspension and sets out to find him before its too late. Now, facing a deadline Ray and IA officer Julia Baker (Isabelle) put their differences aside in order to save the boy. This is a movie that has a great plot, it is very tense and exciting to watch it unfold. The one thing it is missing are the actors to really pull off the drama needed. Going in, since this is a WWE movie that is to be expected but it still seemed to hurt the movie. That said though, this is perhaps the best WWE movie to date. Overall, a movie with a great and tense story that actually makes up for the lack of dramatic acting and is actually pretty good in spite of itself. I surprisingly give this a high B.",1459814400,,1079,4.09433962264151
7616619,5,B01B1LE3N6,"Ray (Nick Nemeth) is an unorthodox Seattle detective who makes his own rules. He gets suspended by Lt. Julia Baker (Katharine Isabelle) while pending an investigation which will lead to his termination. While he laments over the loss of his son three years ago, he gets a call back concerning a child kidnapped by the Russian Mafia and has a bomb strapped to him demanding a $2 million $112. 35 ransom. They specifically want him. Ray is not reinstated and is tailed by Baker to report on any breaches of conduct. With the clock ticking on the boy, Ray goes very rogue and drags Baker into his antics.

This is a modern day ""Dirt Harry"" type of story. Instead of a crazy guy, it is a Russian, and instead of a little girl being buried, it is a boy with a bomb, but you get the idea. Katharine Isabelle was excellent in her role providing a subtle sexuality and good chemistry with Nick Nemeth. Action with a good blend of humor and drama.

This is a good film for those who like a vigilante cop film without any heavy thinking. 4 1/2 stars

7616644,1,B01B1LE3N6,"When Vince McMahon first dreamed up the idea to turn his WWE empire into a movie studio, the first question I had was ""How many crappy ways is he going to come up with to set each story in a wrestling arena""? With the exception of some animated Scooby-Doo movies WWE Studios has avoided the corniness that would come with having wrestlers play themselves. Until now, that is, in the weirdest WWE Studios action flick yet, Countdown, which stars Dolph Ziggler and Kane as cops infiltrating a wrestling show to stop random generic badguy #1000. In terms of plot it's as by-the-numbers as any of these movies have been, but the details are where it gets strange.

Ziggler, who those that follow me at DailyDDT will know, is a WWE superstar that has long since worn out his welcome in my eyes. Claiming to be the guy who ""steals the show"", he's actually the guy who grinds it to a screeching halt with his charisma-free displays. Unfortunately, he doesn't inspire much in Countdown, either, playing bad boy cop Ray Fitzpatrick. We know he's a bad boy because of his messy hair, five o'clock shadow, and the fact that he shoots his own partner so as not to blow their cover. The act netted him a major gun dealer, but it also put him on the radar of Lt. Julia Baker (Katherine Isabelle, serviceable at best) of Internal Affairs, who suspends him immediately. Meanwhile longtime WWE superstar Kane aka ""The Big Red Machine"" aka the ""Chief of Operations"" stands around like a bump on a log as Lt. Cronin.

Mere moments after stomping out of the police headquarters like a wannabe Mel Gibson, Ray is called back in because some guy with a grudge against him has strapped a bomb to a kidnapped child. With only six hours until it explodes, it's up to the rebellious Ray to defy orders and save the day. Why the cops would order him NOT to save the kid doesn't make any sense, but that's what we're left to contemplate. He ends  up working alongside Julia like some makeshift mixed tag team, but this team is totally oil 'n water like Team Hell No, which Kane would know something about.  The odd couple paring of Ray and Julia has no spark at all, though.

Here's where things get more ridiculous than usual for a WWE Studios film. For some reason the investigation leads them to a WWE live event, and it must be a sucky one because The Ascension are there. So are the New Day, the Lucha Dragons, and more, but what's crazy is when Rusev, totally playing himself, shoulderblocks the snot out of Ray while he's chasing a suspect backstage. So wait, what now? Ziggler, as a non-wrestler character, is getting harrassed by WWE cameos? How does that logic work? What alternate space reality is this? Of course, Ziggler manages to pull off some of his signature wrestling manuevers because fans need that or something, and Rusev's gal Lana even puts him over by saying ""Now THAT is a real man"". It's the best push Ziggler's received in months.

What's surprising is how little action there is. There's less physicality than the opening 20-minutes of Monday Night Raw, and what there is can only be described as mediocre. John Stockwell used to be a competent director, but his talents seem to only be in ocean-based flicks like Blue Crush and Into the Blue. He doesn't get much help from Ziggler, who should be better at reading scripted material considering that's his job every single week. And yet he's fairly dull here, and not even his trademark helps.  As a part-time stand-up comedian, Ziggler should be able to bring a few laughs to the table, but the screenplay by Richard Wenk (who wrote Denzel Washington's The Equalizer) is dry and humorless, except when it's unintentionally funny. A brawl between Ray and Cronin is intriguing only because you keep waiting for Kane to hit a tombstone piledriver then make flames shoot out of the floor. It doesn't happen, sadly, because that would be the only thing about Countdown worth remembering.",1470182400,,3933,4.650359712230216

If you are expecting bad acting, look elsewhere. Gone are the days of 80's schlock and Hogan making critics lose their lunch. Dolph and Kane do an excellent job with multiple others appearing in cameos. Look for what Ziggler and Rousev do in this movie. Very appropriate for their ""real life"" ring feud.

7616688,2,B01B1LE3N6,"Here we go now, people. Confession time, I do like a lot of these WWE movies, no really I do, I am entertained and there is plenty of action and for the most part you take what you can get as far as the story and acting goes. WWE loves to play with the ""I am a cop and my kid died"" thing. That should tell you right off that the story is typical and not too original. The ""good Cop"" that is doing all the wrong things but getting results. The lady cop who begins to believe in his conspiracy theories. and the Captain who wants to believe but won't. Kane as the Captain, not bad. Dolph Ziggler as the Good Cop needs to have a few acting lessons (besides what he gets at the WWE) he's angry all the time and grunt and kicks and growls and scowls and that is about it. Now the worst, Katharine Isabelle, purely awful. All she does is wear tight pants and keep her hand on her gun, lousy actress. Put her and Dolph in the same scene and you will scream for relief from the agony.",1462752000,,976,4.01025641025641

7616726,3,B01B1LE3N6,"Ray Thompson (Dolph Ziggler) is a rebellious narcotics cop, who was put on suspension after shooting his partner Det. Kendricks (Josh Blacker) during a bust against a russian dealer Nikoali (Alexander Kalugin) by his Lt. Cronin (Kane), received a package at the station leading to an online feed of a child named Anatoly (Luke Roessler) being held hostage with explosives strapped to his body under the ransom of over $2 million to be delivered at a WWE live event but plans go south & the receiver is killed before the bomb is disarmed. Thompson must now team with Internal Affairs agent Julia Baker (Katharine Isabelle) to find the child & disarm the bomb in less than a few hours while dealing with different issues such as his past effecting the investigation in more ways than one & discovering that this issue goes deeper than just a hostage & ransom.

I enjoyed the movie as the plot was simple enough to follow & I thought everyone played their roles well but I have to admit one thing was really annoying was the constant flashing to various WWE stars in the ring during a chase scene that had nothing to do or wasn't around the superstars themselves but in the end it's not something I would watch more than once so it's good for a stream/rental.",1461283200,,1256,4.607142857142857

8749012,2,B01B1LE3N6,"I've seen a few of these low budget made by WWE studios films, and this would easily be the worst of them.  Granted you're not expecting much, they share the same sort of poorly written scripts as Lifetime or Hallmark channel made for TV movies, but also have a bit of a cheesiness to them and no real character development, they don't build why the hero is a tough guy, he just starts out as one on the screen and is really only a tough guy because his physic is huge.

The plot of this one basically revolves around your typical action cop movie character who doesn't go by the book, doesn't care about procedures as long he gets the results, even if it means the guy you caught going back on the streets or endangering the lives of other officers.  Nic Nemeth, best known for his WWE identity Dolph Ziggler plays that role in this one as Ray, who has been suspended and told in all likelihood he's going to be fired for shooting his partner, so a Russian mob guy who claimed he was a cop would believe that he wasn't and go through with an arms deal.  His boss is played by another actor best known as a wrestler Glenn Jacobs but doesn't really do anything in the movie in his couple of minutes of screen time other than look out of place with you thinking, gee crime must be pretty much non existent in Seattle, these cops must have a lot of time of their hands to be lifting weights all day. The other main character is the female internal affairs cop, whose division is despised as much as a parking inspector by the other cops.  She is played by Katharine Isabelle, hadn't heard of her before and likely won't see her again if her acting performance in Countdown is anything to go by. Her character is a tough take no nonsense from cops or the public but she wasn't convincing as that. Plus the wardrobe person on this one has a lot to answer for, when do you ever see cops while on the clock, wearing jeans?  Even if you wanted to argue perhaps undercover, well she's wearing a huge shiny gold badge on her belt.  The other minor police and Russian gangsta actors also deliver a pretty lame performance, how much of this is their acting or a bad script is debatable.

The film starts with a guy talking Russian for a fair while, there's no subtitles and I'd originally thought maybe somehow they'd released a Russian language sound tracked film but eventually our main character turns up asking for some guy in English.  There are fight scenes such as the one in front of the yellow police caution tape where the actors clearly aren't even coming close to connecting with each other.  Apparently Russian consulates have next to no security in Seattle as well.  Basically Russians are portrayed as incompetent fools in this film which even make your cold war era propaganda full movie Russians look smart.  The stuff that goes on with the kid and the bomb attached to him is too stupid to bother to mention.

Whilst you know you aren't going to be getting an A grade action movie under the WWE film studio brand, you should be able to expect at least a B grade action movie.  You don't get that here.",1487030400,,3107,4.399650959860384
