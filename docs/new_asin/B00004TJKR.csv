7922633,3,B00004TJKR,The movie failed my expectations. It was boring and the storyline was hard to believe. The casts lacked sex appeal and the acting was so fake and unappealing.,1472688000,,158,4.678571428571429
7922634,1,B00004TJKR,Laughably bad. Not erotic at all. Feminist themes for those who care. Turned it off way before was over. Don't do it.,1397606400,2,117,4.363636363636363
7922635,4,B00004TJKR,"This is not particularly a guys film. The pace is slower and no men banging away or using their tongue badly and thinking it's great. Also, seems there is no orgasm faking or big hair or high heals in bed or fake shrieking after 10 seconds of sex. Porn but not insulting to women. There I said it.",1372291200,2,297,4.137931034482759
7922636,4,B00004TJKR,"For the most part, I enjoyed this dvd. There are three segments, the first is depicted on the box cover, a very good looking nicely toned man is forced into masturbating for a group of women, with the assistance of his girlfriend. If you like CFNM, clothed female, naked male or humiliation, you will enjoy this part.
The second one has two females (""lesbians"" - thrown in their just to help with your Amazon searches) exploring their sexuality. They also experiment with toys.
The last one was the most interesting for me, swingers, or lifestyle enthusiasts, a couple blindfolds the wife, and shares her with another couple. Very seductive, erotic, fun. The man in the trio is not attractive, but the subject is fun, none the less!
I would buy again!",1356998400,3,751,4.740458015267175
7922637,4,B00004TJKR,It was good from beginning to end starting with the opening encounter with the two women. I won't give away the end but it was every man's fantacy come through. Quite graphic and entriguing yet left something to the immagination. Tastefully done.,1297900800,,246,4.880952380952381
7922638,3,B00004TJKR,"Indifferently produced yuppie porn. But at least the actors are all (with  the exception of Carol Queen) young and appealing.
Each segment is  introduced by a lady who explains in great detail how deep and cool the  following story is, which is mildly insulting to the viewer. This narrator  has a stiff and wooden public speaking manner. I think she might be the  editrix of ""Libido"" magazine, who are the people that produced  this video.
This tape was worth renting for $5 because of the first  segment which involved a naked man being ""forced"" to masturbate  in front of a crowd of women. This was ""hot"" for me. The crowd of  women spectators was interesting, too. It included a number of celebrities  from the Good Vibrations, kinky-sex-is-cool crowd. Betty Dodson, the  ladies-masturbation guru, is present, wearing purple hair. And Kim Airs,  Brookline's favorite daughter, puts in an excellent star turn disguised in  male drag as a leering, podgy, dirty old man.",968025600,12,971,4.956521739130435
