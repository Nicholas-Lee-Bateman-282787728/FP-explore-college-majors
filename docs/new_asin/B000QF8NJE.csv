Some of the so called outdoor scenes were so faked (The sky: you could make out the seams that they had pieced together). I was sorry I paid for this movie and was glad to see the end of it.",1321401600,,267,3.7857142857142856
8195946,4,B000QF8NJE,"For this story/movie there are many versions. The one I like the best is
under the same name but the Taiwan version 1983

You can find the beginning of the movie on you tube.
That's my favorite version
This version is the second best.
There's another one but, I don't think its as good.
It stars Adam Cheng.
Other than the 3 versions mention the rest of them suck! They over do the martial arts fighting by computer and outrageous flying, over doing the wire work looks cool but, when you over do it way too much it sucks!
A better version of this movie is the one with Jet Li - Kung fu  master.",1314057600,,595,4.165217391304348

8195948,5,B000QF8NJE,"Although this series supposed to be the third chapter of the trilogy, the storyline mainly about Chang Mo Kei and his parents (at the beginning). It shows about Chang Mo Kei love ties to many ladies until he decide to stick with one. Besides that the story almost have no relation with the previous two (Legend of the Condor Heroes and Return of The Condor Heroes). Therefore if you think that this is going to be the continuation story, then you will be disappointed. There are some part of the show that still ties with the previous series such as the history of Emei sect plus the true secret of the two weapon (Dragon Sabre and Heaven Sword). A character supposed to be the descendant of two main characters from Return of The Condor Heroes also appeared to maintain the connection. However, overall, this series is rather different than the previous two.

There are many Kungfu styles paraded throughout the whole series that come from different sects. The English subtitles also pretty good and clear. I have other TV series with supposedly English subtitles but not really good. Compare to that, the subtitles in this series is much better.

If you love watching adventurous show plus quite a bit of drama along the way, then this show is a good one to watch. Just be prepare to spend so much time watching them. If you are like me, I can't wait to see what happen next and will keep popping up the next dvd in.",1292284800,3,1418,4.556862745098039
8195949,4,B000QF8NJE,"This movies has some of the best actors in the business.  The story isn't bad either.  However, the special effects is average.  Overall, I would rate this movie a C passing",1246320000,2,173,4.516129032258065
