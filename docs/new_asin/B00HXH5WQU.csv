6242668,5,B00HXH5WQU,"Warner Archive has done it again by releasing yet another of its famed film series on DVD.  All 9 of the MGM films are included across 5 discs. I purchased mine directly from the Warner Archive for $10 less than here. My set is pressed, not burned. Trailers are included as is a failed tv pilot (30 mins) from 1961 with Lee Ayres returning to the role as a more mature Kildare. These films are great fun and Lionel Barrymore steals every one of them. Loaded with MGM up and comers like Lana Turner.

I hope Warner gets around to the Barrymore/Dr. Gillespie films made after Ayres was unfairly sacked from MGM as a conscientious objector during WW II (he served with distinction as a non-combat medic 1942-46).

Warner is also releasing the Richard Chamberlain tv series from the early 60s to DVD.  The series is much more serious than these early films. I purchased season 1 from Amazon, and to my shock the set was also pressed and not burned!",1390953600,27,944,4.502923976608187
