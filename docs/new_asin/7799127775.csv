1116970,3,7799127775,"The works of Hayao Miyazaki are always populated by unique characters and unbridled creativity in fantastically magical worlds. Ponyo is no different. However, where his other films like Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle play upon more adult themes and oftentimes truly terrifying villains, Ponyo remains very safely in the realm of whimsical childhood adventure, and sadly abandons the heavy adversity found in previous efforts. Still mildly entertaining, gorgeously picturesque, and wonderfully perceptive to the subtleties of childish innocence that evoke poignant humor, Ponyo clearly targets a very young audience.

The son of a sailor, 5-year old Sosuke lives a quiet life on an oceanside cliff with his mother Lisa (Tina Fey). One fateful day, he finds a beautiful goldfish trapped in a bottle on the beach and upon rescuing her, names her Ponyo. But she is no ordinary goldfish. The daughter of a masterful wizard (Liam Neeson) and a sea goddess (Cate Blanchett), Ponyo uses her father's magic to transform herself into a young girl and quickly falls in love with Sosuke; but the use of such powerful sorcery causes a dangerous imbalance in the world. As the moon steadily draws nearer to the earth and Ponyo's father sends the ocean's mighty waves to find his daughter, the two children embark on an adventure of a lifetime to save the world and fulfill Ponyo's dreams of becoming human.

Ponyo proves once again that it's very difficult to base a movie around a child main character. And considering the lead is five years old, legendary animation director Miyazaki must overcome an especially large obstacle. Unfortunately he is unable to infuse any reasoning into this imaginative but empty fantasy. Sosuke is given the largest challenge of his life and the formidable task of restoring balance to the universe when a hole in the fabric of reality is opened. Conveniently, he never actually has to deal with difficult trials, tests of his capability or proof of his love for Ponyo. Since he is only five years old, it would be a particular nuisance to demonstrate love as anything beyond a simple spoken phrase.

The biggest problem with the film is the lack of any real conflict. Granted that it's targeting a notably young audience, but Ponyo plays out as little more than a series of events that progressively get weirder as Miyazaki starts to explore the supernatural and unusual fantasy - all without explanations or a basis in popular mythology. Never does believable danger creep into the picture, nor a frightening villain or emotional tribulations. It seems unnecessary to include a single skeptical character (Toki, voiced by Lily Tomlin) for a timid dose of realism, one who actually questions the phenomena taking place - and she's presented as a crotchety old wretch.

At least the animation during the numerous underwater sequences is complex, creative and visually stunning. Apparently so much effort was contributed to these scenes that the human animation is startlingly simple and occasionally ugly. The best part of Ponyo is the music, movingly presiding over the grandest tsunami moments and causing milder segments to briefly become more stirring. Ultimately Ponyo is designed for the smallest of children - what it won't teach them is to avoid talking to elderly strangers with wild orange hair and candy-cane-striped suits who emerge from the sea.

1116971,5,7799127775,"Nobody can make stories like Miyazaki. He has done another masterpiece with ""Ponyo"". Colors are stunning and the artwork is as good as it gets. I bought the Japanese version with English subtitles because I didn't want to wait for the Disney one. Mainly this is for my 4 year old grandson but I like it too. I will read the words to him when he comes for his visit next month. He loves ""The cat returns"" and ""Totoro"" so I know he wll love this one. Ponyo will be enjoyable to all ages so go treat yourself and get this one.

1117216,5,7799127775,"Have you ever seen a movie that made you satisfied at the end? For me, Ponyo was that movie.
Ponyo is an animated movie created by Ghibli Studio that is about a magical fish, named Ponyo, who leaves her sisters and father to see the world. She meets a boy named Sosuke and become friends. However her father (who hates humans) punishes her by taking her back to their home and puts her in a bubble. Ponyo then decides she wants to become a human so she can be with Sosuke and is determined to get back to him.
Ponyo is a very detailed movie. The music and animation was the best part because the music was atmospheric and the animation was satisfying and gorgeous! The movie kept me in suspense and I wanted to know what was going to happen next. I definitely laughed, even when I rewatched it. The main characters are definitely relatable. For example, any child can relate to Sosuke when he couldn't find his mother.
After watching this movie, it starts to make me wonder if humans really are as bad as Ponyos father thinks. He dislikes humans for polluting the ocean. This hasn't really affected me, but it definitely make me think about how humanity should stop problems like this. I think that people should take care of the ocean more and stop throwing waste into the ocean.
Also after watching the movie, I wondered how Sosuke was able to accept Ponyo the way she is. Ponyo is a fish, but Sosuke still loves her no matter what form she is in. I feel like most people who watched the movie will love Ponyo as a fish or human. I think it is important to accept someone the way they are no matter how different they are.
This movie will make you happy and anyone will enjoy it. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it. The main characters are relatable and funny and the music is relaxing! I hope that this movie is able to tell people to think more about the ocean and how we can stop polluting it. I also hope this movie can tell people to accept people even people who are different. If you were Sosuke, would you be able to accept Ponyo as a fish and a human?",1519948800,,2086,4.310432569974555

1117276,5,7799127775,"Studio Ghiblis deluxe Ponyo DVD Set is an extraordinary sight to behold. This vastly entertaining Miyazaki creation enchants you with its spellbinding animation style. Ponyo was released in 2008 in Japan (2009 in US) and garnered several awards including the Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year. The English language version includes such voice over talent as Cate Blanchett,  Matt Damon, Tina Fey, Liam Neeson, Lily Tomlin and Betty White.

Ponyo tells the story of a five-year-old boy, Sosuke, who finds and becomes friends with a puzzling goldfish that he names Ponyo. Later on, he discovers that Ponyo is actually a goldfish princess who desires to become a human. Throughout their journey they overcome her fathers displeasure of humans. Ponyo becomes so transfixed and loving towards Sosuke that he must undergo a few challenges set forth by her parents to see if he is worthy of her affection.

The DVD set includes two discs, a Blu-Ray and a traditional DVD. It includes over five hours of riveting bonus features, such as Feature Length Storyboards; Behind the Microphone; The Five Geniuses Who Created Ponyo; Interviews with Hayao Miyazaki and Toshio Suzuki (Producer); Theme Song Press Conference and Theme Song Music Video; Opening Event at Hibiya Scala-Za Theatre; Hayao Miyazaki Press Conference; Creating Ponyo; Ponyo and Fujimoto; The Nursery; Scoring Miyazaki; Producers Perspective: Telling the Story; The Locations of Ponyo; Original Theatrical Trailers; TV Spots; and even an exclusive booklet with statements from the director.

In the Creating Ponyo special, Miyazaki tells us that Ponyo was made for a younger audience, such as five-year-olds, because he wanted to make a movie that was easier than My Neighbor Totoro for young children to understand.  Miyazaki believes that five-year-olds are more perceptive than they are able to describe. He later states that Ponyo represents someone who has been released from the constraints of society. By watching this special, we learn how much respect Miyazaki has for children.

The Producer's Perspective is an interview with the producer, Toshio Suzuki. In this special we learn all the steps that go into making a Studio Ghibli film. First Miyazaki and Suzuki review Miyazakis image boards and decide which is the best. The storyboards are then sent to the animators. He later states that their method hasn't changed over the past 30 years. He finishes by saying that well developed characters are the foundation of any Miyazaki film.

In The Nursery special, Toshio Suzuki states that it was Miyazakis dream to establish a Studio Ghibli nursery for the employees children and, during this production, it became a reality. Suzuki goes on by saying that the storyline changed halfway through production from being totally set at the nursery to also taking place at an old folks home and the house on the hill.

This highly rich Ponyo DVD extravaganza is a must have for any Studio Ghibli fan. I give it 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 5 to 18.

(He's a wizard Harry.) and she escapes and falls in love with a little boy. It's adorable and fun for all ages. No scary things, no adult themes. It reminds me of a Little Mermaid but without the drama llama stuff. Though kids might not get the entire gist of the plot. Still lots of fun!!",1518220800,,435,4.129411764705883
1117280,5,7799127775,"If the intent was to create or mimic a fable the feeling is there.
Imagery shows the beautiful and potentially dangerous relationship we have with the ocean.

Things about the movie I didn't like: the Public Service Announcement thrown in about people being bad and littering in the ocean. Yeah, some do. Do we need to talk about it in the movie? Perhaps. Maybe that's why the guy was ready to kill all humans... which he forgets by the next scene where he tries to marry his fish child off to the human baby. So that seems a little abrupt to me. Early childhood betrothal is a weird topic, but if little guy knows who he wants to marry when he's 6 then good for him, I guess.

Ponyo the fish girl falls in love with Sosuke who rescues her out near the beach of his house.  I don't know why it speaks to me so, perhaps the unadulterated joy and determination of the two protagonists at their ages, esp. when she's riding the fish in the storm chasing Sosuke and getting ever so closer.

1117649,4,7799127775,"Audrey Shabbas's Student, Levvy: Ponyo is a lot more realistic and funner to watch, than Disney's Little Mermaid/Ariel's Beginning. Ponyo is not sugar coated, and you are constantly wondering where this story will take you next.  Disney's stories are predictable and follow the same old story pattern. The mysteriousness of Ponyo's father was a little scary at first, because he was mysterious. . . was this an evil character? . .  . this character was a man or a woman?  You begin with thinking that this character is evil. .  . but then see that this character is just very worried about his daughter and even about the fate of the planet. . including their ocean home. The thing I didn't like about Ponyo was the ending. It could have gone a little longer.  It leaves you wondering, for example,  what was going happen when the Dad comes home.

This review is part of my home-schooling class on Japanese anime films.  We researched anime as a genre and have seen all of Hayao Miyazaki's films remastered into English.",1506297600,2,1020,4.691011235955056

I watched this with a friend, and liked it so much I bought it for my nephew. Him and my sister both loved it, too.",1494460800,,371,4.470588235294118
1117991,5,7799127775,"I am a longtime fan of Ghibli films and I have them almost all on disc, but I often watch movies in bed on my laptop. It's a very nice machine but it lacks a disc drive, so I stream, which works for most films and shows I may ever want to watch outside of some very old and/or obscure films. I am sure there are a lot of folks in similar situations - on tablets, phones, etc.

It has always made me sad that Ghibli, even though they partnered with Disney here in the states, hasn't offered streaming. Even the films I bought which are released by Disney - who offers most of their flicks in DVD+Blueray+Digital versions - doesn't offer the Studio Ghibli films in digital or on their Disney Movies Anywhere program.

Well, for the longest time it was hard to get the soundtracks outside of importing expensive (and questionable/possible bootleg) CDs until I iTunes came around so maybe streaming select Studio Ghibli films on premium channels through Amazon Prime + subscriptions will open Studio Ghibli's eyes to offering streaming of their films. Although I would love to have granted access via Disney Movies Anywhere - since I've bought all the films already - I would gladly repurchase my most favorite films (Ponyo! Howl's Moving Castle! Kiki! Spirited Away! Oh, all of them!) separately if they were ever offered on Amazon Video to buy.

If you want streaming Studio Ghibli films outside of this limited time (but still amazing) offering that is available through having a Starz channel subscription then please leave a comment! :-) More Ghibli films on Amazon Video! And to buy, please! Yes, please and thank you! :D <3",1494028800,,1626,4.698245614035088

We are thrilled to have it back where it belongs, and with most of the really popular movies being so affordable there is no reason not to rebuild the collection.

The story is a wonderful retelling of the Little Mermaid, and as with other Studio Ghibli movies, just sit and get lost in the art and the story.  The quality is wonderful and the fact is, the weird and wonderful should be part of our lives.",1480723200,4,590,4.288288288288288

It would be a cute little love story if both Sosuke and Ponyo where not such bestfriends, they both would go to great lengths to make sure one another was taking care of even if that meant jumping into a raging rush of water that's pretty close to covering your little head.

It's difficult to describe beyond that because I think your enjoyment is highly dependent on ""what you bring to"" this film experience, and, for an adult, at least, it lends itself to many subjective memories and experiences calling the shots on your reactions.  To me, that's what makes it great--it's possibilities are so rich for each viewer.  Kids will just enjoy the pure fancy and fantasy.  Gorgeous Miyazaki animation has never been more imaginative.  So very much worth your time to consider, especially if you're already a fan of the Maestro of Ghibli.",1473033600,,736,4.951219512195122

I was shocked that she remembered the title. She's never asked to re-watch a movie. To be sure, I pulled up the cover image, and she squealed, ""Yes! Ponyo! Again!"" In awe, I ordered a copy. As much as I want to limit her screen time, realistically, she's watched this 1-2X a day since we bought it. I could probably recite it word for word by now. The first thing when she wakes up, ""Mommy! I'm hungry. Breakfast? Watch Ponyo?"" And when it ends she begs, ""More Ponyo!"" To be fair, if she's hooked on a movie, I'm thankful it's this one.

This Disney edition with both Blu Ray & DVD is great and the quality cannot be beat.  Don't settle for the poor quality Miyazaki bootlegs that sometimes appear on Amazon - part of the wonder of Miyazaki is the artistic detail put into his films which doesn't translate well in those bootlegs.",1471737600,,404,4.373333333333333

The Artwork and imagery is really beautiful and fun for kids as well as adults too! Ponyo was one of those must buy films for my young son .. he just adored it! I highly recommend!

****SPOILERS AHEAD****
For those of you who want to know more about what the story is all about ... Read on!

Ponyo is a little fish, Her mother is like Mother Nature of the Sea and her Father is like a wizard who loves the sea. She really wants to be free and leave the bottom of the ocean to explore the world. She finds herself hurt and in shallow water near the shore. That is when a little boy finds her and picks her up in his little sand bucket. He Helps her and with the help of magic and Ham Ponyo becomes a little girl. Things get a little Topsy Tervy, there is a lot of fun, cute adventure ahead and then a Happy ending. The story is about Love, Family, Kindness and sacrifice. Everything that I like to see in a film that i introduce to my son.

If you think about it, the movies you watched as a kid have a deep effect on most people. You remember ideas, feelings, and concepts well into your life. I hope this is one of those memorable films for my son in 30 Years! I highly recommend watching with some Popcorn & Pocky!! Just Perfect!",1471305600,10,1351,4.090566037735849

1119684,4,7799127775,"Synopsis: Ponyo is a goldfish who lives under the sea with her wizard father and many goldfish sisters.  One day she ventures to the surface to satisfy her undying curiosity about the world above the surface.  She meets a boy named Sosuke there, and a strong bond of love develops between them.  She gets into her father's magical elixirs, miraculously acquires legs and goes to live with Sosuke on the land as a real human girl, but Sosuke must make a commitment to her, or she will dissolve into sea foam, and the world might end (not really sure about that last part, it wasn't very well explained)

Spoilers, but really, there's not much to give away, its Ghibli's version of Disney's version of the Little Mermaid.

Story: 6.0  This, as the poster says, is the Little Mermaid.  Well, kinda.  Hans Christian Anderson's The Little Sea-Maid was actually a tragedy, and had an appropriately tragic ending.  Now, there's nothing wrong with doing a Miyazaki version of the Little Mermaid, but I still can't give it high marks for originality, unlike many of his other movies which had brilliant stories.  Really, the thing I had the biggest problem with was that Miyazaki set everything up to follow the Anderson version, even adding the sea foam element, but at the last minute, the great ""test"" ended up being nothing but an underwhelmingly simple question.  Lots of buildup, and then the story Disneyed out, lacking the courage to stick with the Anderson ending.  Just like Disney, they take Anderson's The Little Sea-Maid and tack on a happy ending, but this was obviously tacked on with little effort.  Perhaps if the ""test"" had been more of an ordeal I could have accepted it. We might as well have been watching an animated version of one of Shakespeare's tragedies, but everybody lives in the end, with nothing more than a single line of dialogue to explain the difference.

I understand that this was supposed to be a movie for five year olds, but Miyazaki seems to have forgotten that five year olds don't pay for movie tickets or buy DVDs, their parents do.  This movie, unlike his other works, has little to offer older audiences.  It doesn't have to end with the mermaid dead, but you could have at least let the tension build so audiences felt relief when the expected tragic end was avoided.

Animation: 8.0  The animation here is not as strikingly beautiful or detailed as Spirited Away, but it's still gorgeous.  The character designs are typical for Ghibli.  Perhaps the best of the visuals appears about half way into the movie, where Ponyo has acquired the magic she needs to become human and she runs along the surface of the stormy ocean to get to the land and see Sosuke.  It's impressive, and worth watching the movie if just for this sequence.

Sound: 7.0  The Japanese cast definitely put more emotion into their performances.  I wish Disney would hire more professional voice actors rather than going for big names.  Not that Liam Neeson or Cate Blanchett did a bad job.  Actually I enjoyed their performances.  It's just that they are so recognizable, and also that there are so many truly great voice actors and actresses out there that could have done this, possibly better.  A good example is during the scene where Sosuke and his mom are driving in the storm, trying to get home from the Senior Center while the waves crash around them.  Tina Fey's performance is good, but Tomoko Yamaguchi was superior, vocally conveying the peril of her situation where Fey sounded more ""in control.""  The music was almost entirely orchestral, and fit the feel of the movie.  There were very few vocals.  The credit song, ""Ponyo on a Cliff by the Sea,"" is cute and fun.  Overall, it's a good soundtrack for the movie, but not one I would buy.

Characters: 7.0  Characters are where Miyazaki has always excelled.  He is such a keen observer of human behavior, especially that of children, that his animation captures them like magic and this is no exception.  However, when re-creating the story of the Little Sea-Maid one character was left out, and that robbed the story of its necessary tension.  In the original, there is another girl.  The Prince has to choose between the Mermaid and a human Princess.  It's a triangle, and that is of course why the ending fell flat.  Of course he was going to choose Ponyo, there was nobody else.  Also, Sosuke has a dad who is captain of a ship.  The part seems to have been added just so Matt Damon could have half a dozen lines in the film.  Add to this that earlier in the movie, Fujimoto, Ponyo's dad, states that he wants to rid the world of all the nasty humans, but now he's fine with his daughter becoming one and going off to live with them.  That's a hell of a flip-flop to let go completely unexplained.  Unfortunately, Fujimoto's miraculous change of heart seems to be the only development we get from any character in the show.

Overall:  7.0  There were moments of pure magic in this film, as there are with all Miyazaki films.  It was beautiful.  While there may have been issues with the story, the animation and sound were still worthy of a Ghibli film, and that makes it worth watching.  I recommend it, but only to those who have already seen all the others.  If you still haven't seen Spirited Away, Mononoke Hime, Nausicaa, or My Neighbor Totoro, see those first.",1451865600,,5342,4.669882100750268

1119916,4,7799127775,"Loosely based on the Hans Christian Andersen story ""The Little Mermaid,"" Brunhilde (Noah Cyrus) is a goldfish living in the ocean with her many sisters and her father Fujimoto (Liam Neeson), a wizard and former human. Brunhilde has a dream to become human and when she travels to the surface she almost gets captured in a fishing net. She is rescued by a young boy, Sosuke (Frankie Jonas), who promptly renames her ""Ponyo"" and she quickly starts falling in love with him. But her protective father is against the idea of her mingling with people.

Out of all the Ghibli films, this is the only one that was made solely to target kids. This may leave some adult viewers a little disappointed as this movie lacks some of the deeper meanings and themes and complex characters that characterize other Ghibli films. The animation also comes off as a little more cartoony with lots of use of bright colors. But, if you can look past that, this is still quite a good movie with cute characters and a fun story. People who like animation will appreciate the effort that went into this, which was done in a traditional 2D animation style.

1120240,1,7799127775,"The box specifically says that the bluray has the original Japanese voice overs, but it does not. There is no Japanese audio track on the bluray whatsoever.  Not only is that a deal breaker for me, but if the Japanese audio is supposed to be there and it's just not, it's a defective product.

The DVD does, however, have a Japanese track and two English sub tracks (one for the English dub and one that's a more direct translation presumably).  But I'll note again that the box says that both discs have a Japanese track.

This is a great movie, one of my all time favorites, but this is an incomplete version of it.

As for the special features there's really not much of interest.  There's one section that gives you an ""interactive"" tour of other ghibli properties, basically an extended advertisement with no interesting information.  Then there's an interview with Miyazaki, as well as the producer and the soundtrack composer.  These are nice, but short.  There's also a short doc on the town that inspired the setting in Ponyo.  All of these you could probably watch in half an hour. You can also watch the film with the original story boards displaying in the corner. Would be nice to be able to see them full screen and just flip through them though.",1442361600,,1260,4.609865470852018

In the beginning, Ponyo escaped from her father and met Sosuke, a human boy. Fujimoto chased Ponyo .
In order to see Sosuke, whom she loved, Ponyo made a typhoon and a tsunami. She ran along the top of the crashing waves wild sound of Richard Wagner's ""Volkyrie.""
Tiny -- but strong and powerful -- Ponyo, her sister's' joyful dance and huge Gran Mamare were all creative in Miyazaki's great imagination. Hayao Miyazaki made ""Ponyo"" when he was in his sixties. He must have done it for his grandchild.",1435795200,,752,4.5777777777777775

A lot of screen time is dedicated just to the spectacle of it all and I feel like I might be missing something, here. Definitely paced slow enough for small children.

1121352,4,7799127775,"The ocean is a good subject for Hayao Miyazaki, who often threads environmentally-conscious messages into his stories. In ""Ponyo"" the issue of humanity's impact on the sea takes on the creative and unexpected form of an explosive oceanic revival, rather than a slow, ugly degradation. Miyazaki's script, as is usual for Studio Ghibli movies, assumes a lot of intelligence on the part of its audience, which includes many children who are perhaps infrequently exposed to topics like the Cambrian period and the moon's gravitational interaction with the ocean. More often than not, animated movies talk down to kids and try to hold their attention with frenetic action and gags. But Miyazaki understands that young people have a great capacity for appreciating wondrous and sublime things, and especially for internalizing fun facts about the world, as anyone who ever went through (or is still in) a dinosaur or a space phase will remember. Thus the kids in ""Ponyo,"" a young boy and a fish who can take the form of a girl, at one point rattle off the names of the long-extinct, Devonian-era creatures gliding beneath their vessel. Water, so pervasive in the story, seems to take on a new texture in every scene, and its different looks convey its diverse qualities from the tranquility of a moonlit sea to the curious physics of bubbles to the inescapable, town-destroying violence of a tsunami. The dramatic tsunami sequence, which plays to a song that sounds like The Ride of the Valkyries, is poignant in light of the destruction that visited Japan a few years after the movie's release.

There are times, and they have become more frequent in recent years, when Miyazaki struggles to bring his fantasies to believable conclusions. ""Howl's Moving Castle"" (2004) suffered from a nearly incomprehensible ending, and the problem is not wholly overcome in ""Ponyo."" The culmination of this movie has the 5 year-olds make major decisions that, in reality, could hardly be demanded of them. By comparison, the younger sister in Miyazaki's definitive ""My Neighbor Totoro"" (1988) was around the same age and acted more in accordance with it. In ""Ponyo"" the children's behavior seems to be increasingly at the service of the story's environmental message, and this prevents them from becoming quite as real and relatable as the girls from ""Totoro,"" ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" (1989), and ""Spirited Away"" (2001). Nonetheless, ""Ponyo"" is further and welcome evidence of Studio Ghibli's unrivaled mastery of the animated medium.",1423267200,9,2516,5.15158924205379
1121353,5,7799127775,A movie for even the smallest children in the house. Even better than Totoro. You will be singing it forever.,1423267200,,109,4.5

When I was around 10, my mom found someone who got her copies of Ghibli movies, which she grew up with. I remember the big grin on her face when she brought this home and immediately popped it into the computer. I always had a great taste in movies, and Ponyo is to this day one of my favorite Ghibli movies. There is a certain magic to it that had kept it's hold on me. I had never experienced a Japanese movie before, let alone a Ghibli movie, so it was a whole new world for me. And I can safely say that Ponyo was one of the best places to start.

What really got me was the art style, to begin with, as I wasn't familiar with it yet. The art and the colors just popped perfectly, and as someone with synesthesia , that is one of the most important things, alongside the music, which is absolutely beautiful, and again, just pops, from the water noises to really everything. Please note that I saw the version that had the English dub with the lossless soundtrack.

Now, in regards to the story:

Ponyo's storyline, which I won't completely detail because it's already there for you, is a great take on a classic. Perfect for children of all ages, it's simple enough yet captivating to keep children glued to the seat, and even the parent too. The love between Ponyo and Sousuke is childish (in a good way!) and adorable. Yes, it does have some slight conflict, if you can even really call it that. But the movie kind of takes you away from that to show you the little things that really stand out and just make it overall even better. Unlike the Disney movies most children are probably used to, Ponyo isn't just about the conflict or beating whichever villain - it focuses on the bond between two children (er, rather, one child and a goldfish), and how with enough strength in not only yourself, but in others, you can defy fate. And if that isn't beautiful, then I don't know what is.

As for the video, Ponyo is wonderfully done, and it shows how well drawn it is. As I said before, the bright colors and art style that are unique to Studio Ghibli give it a perfect magical feel, and everyone from 4 to 40 can find this enjoyable.

Now, for the thing I've been dreading to talk about: the audio.

The English version is perfection, and the audio is flawless, the cherry on top being that it is a lossless soundtrack, so you're not missing out on a single beat. HOWEVER, the Japanese bluray version here is NOT the lossless version. For people like me, that is a problem because I want the Japanese version as well, and I can pick up very easily that something is missing and it will annoy and upset me.",1407369600,,2653,4.315261044176707

1122420,4,7799127775,"The ""inspired choice"" of using big-name hollywood actors for voices, a rising tradition in big-budget animations, fails here. In Japan, voice-acting is a respected and coveted discipline, and the artistic integrity of it is important. In Japanese, the voices were appropriate and made me laugh, or cry, at moments, purely on delivery alone. In english, the voice acting was 'ok' at best, and distracting (Liam Neeson) at worst.
Visually this is a stunning film, and the plot, while it loses something in it's third quarter, is at least original, despite it's origins.
You can't really trump a Miyazaki film for explorative imaginative scenes, and the best of these are during the water-boating/flood sequences, with a plethora of extinct sealife exposed.
Despite a weak end and lack of an antagonist or any real danger, a solid recommend from me. Just watch in Japanese if you can deal with subtitles.",1404604800,,901,5.094594594594595

I was shocked that he sat through all but the last five minutes of Ponyo - he was absolutely enthralled.  It is a cute movie and the story is just different, which I like.  The dubbing was great.

1122522,3,7799127775,"This is a film for five year olds and feels like it. I've seen it twice now and it still lacks the sense of wonder and mind-blowing awe of Kiki's Delivery Service, Castle in the Sky, Spirited Away, or even My Nrighbor Totoro (all much better films).  It does not have the zing of Howl's Moving Castle, which was superior to this. Ponyo is a strange re-write of The Little Mermaid, it is yet another Miyazaki's environmental films. While it is enjoyable, it just didn't work for me. Some of the colors seem to be more muted, the characters more low key, and the magic not so magical. Even with the story of the balance of nature being out of whack, the Moon coming towards Earth, the waters flooding the land, what I wanted was more of the Mother Sea (Cate Blanchett) character and not so much of Ponyo (Noah Cyrus). A 5 year would be excited by this film, while I wasn't. I still love Castle in the Sky, Kiki's Delivery Service, Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, Porco Rosso, but not this one. I watched all the extra features on the DVD and played with the interactive menus on the second disc, and I was very interested in what Miyazaki had to say and interested in where he got his ideas. I especially liked the documentary on Seto Inland Sea, which he visited and is the setting of Ponyo.

But I was disappointed with it because it felt like there wasn't much of a plot.
The innocent true love bit kinda irked me because it didn't fit! It felt more forth and sudden. They didn't understand. And in the beginning and the end it was more like the forming of a strong friendship then romantic love. I think also the parents of Ponyo and the well should have been explained better. After all her father was talking about when it was finally filled that the human race would come to a end or something along those lines.

I thought Ponyo was a sweet movie.  Didn't quite see the connection to The Little Mermaid though.  Very fanciful and also quite bizarre.  Loved the scenes where the prehistoric fish were following the submerged road.  Did find the wizard/scientist/evil whatsit a bit confusing, half the time he looked like an old lady in drag.

My little sisters even love this move (they made me buy this along with Castle in the Sky); I am really glad that they have taken up my love of Ghibli films!

1123387,5,7799127775,"My son recently started collecting the Miyazaki films on blu ray and I've had the pleasure of viewing them with him the last few days. When my children were much younger, I had purchased Totoro for them and we all enjoyed that film for years as a family...and we still do. Naussica, Castle In The Sky, Spirited Away, and his entire body of work is breathtaking in their own right. However, for my money, I'd have to say Ponyo is his most visually stunning film. The colors are a feast for the eyes (moreso on blu ray) and while this may be yet another reimagining of ""The Little Mermaid"" story, it is an incredibly sweet and charming tale.

My children are now young adults and even though they show little to no interest in the Disney fare of their youth, they still love the Miyazaki films...and with good reason. Somehow, Miyazaki is able to tap into that dearest of human traits we all long for...the wide eyed wonder of innocence. He does so without sugar coating his material, nor does he speak down to his audience. He doesn't rely on juvenile humor or overtly sappy sentimentality.

This film, in particular, is a prime example of this talent. Even as an adult, when you first hear Ponyo declare ""Ponyo loves Sosuke!"", it warms the heart because it comes off not only as incredibly sweet, but totally sincere. The English voice cast is well matched, but I must say I was most impressed by Tina (SNL, 30 Rock) Fey's portrayal of Lisa, Sosuke's somewhat frenetic mother. Fey doesn't have one of those voices that sticks out in your head, as is most common in animated fare. Hers is a simple and earnest voice which delivers lines with complete believability. Liam Neeson and Cate Blanchette are also quite charming in their roles, as are Betty White, Cloris Leachman, and Lily Tomlin.

Ponyo is a delight from start to finish and it makes me long for more traditional hand drawn animation. Even though Miyazaki is now retired, I've no doubt that Studio Ghibli will continue the long standing tradition of excellence.",1388793600,,2022,4.658263305322129

1123547,4,7799127775,"If you like Miyazaki's movies, you will like this one.

I've been very impressed with the relationships in Miyazaki's movies as he seems to understand the difference between love and physical affection, and all of the relationships in his older movies have been about real love, not infatuation and lust like we see in about every other movie and song for the last 40 years.

It seems Miyazaki decided to join the cultural deception a little in this movie.

It's not a big deal, the movie is cute, but I don't think they needed to say at the end of the movie that little kids need to be kissing to show love for each other.  Then they top that off with the ending song with lyrics like ""maybe I might love you so hold me close"" and chanting ""Kiss and hug! Kiss and hug""

Call me old fashioned if you want, but I hope you're not surprised at the alarming number of kids at school having babies when movies are teaching them to be dating before they are even in school.",1382918400,,967,4.320441988950276

1123549,4,7799127775,"This is the kind of movie you should watch when you're feeling down. Its so joyfully magical and the story is so simple and heartwarming.

Ponyo immediately gave me the feeling of an old classic Disney film such as Pinocchio. The music is gorgeous with one very cute theme in particular, but a little old-fashioned at times. The song during the opening credits actually sounds operatic.

The colors are very bright, but the animation is a bit simpler than usual Ghibli fare. I like the way the characters are illustrated, whether they are being portrayed in a natural light or in a comically odd one. But the art is not always what it could be. There is a lot of water in this movie, but it does not look very real or very beautiful; the simplified light reflections and the lack of shine make it look a little too cartoony.

Ponyo does lack a weighty element like the one that made My Neighbor Totoro more emotionally engaging, but the characters and the way they live are hardly less real. Like most Studio Ghibli films, Ponyo is full of those natural moments where you recognize yourself in the characterizations on the screen.

The second half does get a little nonsensical, but I think that Ponyo is the kind of story that can be best enjoyed by children, who don't always require a perfect plot framework to appreciate the fun moments that make this movie so special. This is the kind of movie that I wished I could have watched when I was a little kid.",1382227200,,1459,4.515151515151516

We opted for the dual format set because we have BR at home but only DVD in the minivan, and every good child-appropriate film must be playable in the van... and as much as I'd like to, I haven't been allowed to install an HD system there!

In reaction to other viewers...

1st, not of the same that Miyazaki-sama quality.  You know what?  Live with it.  This film was intended to be for younger audiences, and it CAPTIVATES THEM!  And even old farts like me still like it, too.

2nd, no Japanese audio on the Blu-Ray disc.  Uh, not sure what you ordered, but mine came with English, Japanese, and French on both the BR and DVD.

I highly suggest, if you have children of any age, to check out these Hayao Miyazaki and Disney collaboration films.  They are hidden gems.  The great thing about them being less known is we have a unique movie library for my kid's friends to be amazed at, although I do hope more people can enjoy them I kind of like being the only people on the block with these movies.

1124498,5,7799127775,"Brunhilde is a fish-girl who lives in the sea and one day gets the taste of BLOOD!  Sounds like the start of a bad B-movie of horror and bad special effects but it isn't.  Nope, this is Studio Ghibli.
Brunhilde is renamed Ponyo by the little boy who saves her, and feeds her ham.  Ponyo falls in love with the boy and refuses to stay in the sea, to the point where she ends up re-starting a massive evolutionary boom within the sea.  She returns to land, bringing with her animals who have not been seen for millions, in some cases billions, of years.  She also ends up flooding the local island.  And makes the Moon start to slowly fall to Earth.  No, not joking.  Her father must now try to figure out how to restore the balance before things go totally out of control.  It turns out that Ponyo can live as a human and the world will be saved if she can pass a test.  If not she will turn into sea foam, which if I remember right can happen to mermaids in myth, and, I assume, the Moon will crash into the Earth and we all die.
Ponyo loves Sosuke, the boy, the balance of nature is restored and everybody lives.
Now, let me say I like this film but I don't love it.  I love Howl's Moving Castle and the other films by Studio Ghibli and I enjoyed this one also.  The characters are cute, the artwork and landscape is wonderful and I enjoyed some of the magic and wonder the creators brought to the film.  Now, I was not too happy about Liam Neeson as the father Fujimoto, he seemed wooden, and sometimes I wondered at the reaction of the adults to many of the events in the story.  I mean, look, ancient sea creatures are appearing, the land is being flooded, the night sky is raining stars, and the Moon is coming down!  I was waiting for  many of the adults to start screaming in horror, crying in the corner, and babbling about the coming of the Deep Ones.
But kids will enjoy it!  Just have lots of ham afterwards, they will want HAM, and don't eat any seafood for the next few weeks.  And stay out of the water.  ENJOY!",1365984000,2,2025,4.186046511627907

1124628,4,7799127775,"Miyazaki has been a favorite of mine for many years. If there is one artist I can say has never let me down, it is Miyazaki (well, him and Tolkien, so you see how highly I regard his work). Every one of his movies are amazing, from his epic masterpieces Princess Mononoke and Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, to his more down to earth family affairs such as Spirited Away and My Neighbor Totoro. So how does Ponyo stack up against the other films in Miyazaki's arsenal?

Well, not as well as I was hoping, though far from bad.

Ponyo is something different from Miyazaki, a kind of movie he hasn't really done since Kiki's Delivery Service. This is a movie aimed at children and children alone. It's a big change from Howls Moving Castle which, though enjoyable for kids, was aimed as much towards young adults as it was towards children. Ponyo is Miyazaki's take on the story in The Little Mermaid. A young goldfish, Ponyo, meets a boy named Soscay and decides against her father's wishes that she wants to be human. What follows is a dazzling display of color and artistry that puts to shame most children's movies made in America today. Let's face it, American animation is mostly garbage with no style, no vision, and no heart. If Ponyo is anything, it's a visually stunning work of art from a studio and director who don't mess around. Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki have been turning out amazing looking films for decades and Ponyo is simply the tip of the spear. Its visuals and creativity are outstanding in every way imaginable. It just leaves you lost in the moment in a way no other children's movies, with the exception of the better Pixar movies, can.

More than anything else, though, Ponyo is a cute film. Ponyo's character design is just perfect to portray a little girl of her age, and with her level of naivety considering she IS a fish who just recently learned to be human. Soscay's interactions with his mother during the first half of the film (and her interactions with her husband) are so real and heartwarming I couldn't help the giant smile that crept onto my face. This is a heartwarming film.

However there is a downside to this film. Miyazaki has always been one for incredible plots that, to the outside viewer, seem to make little sense. Trying to explain the plot of Princess Mononoke or Spirited Away to someone who's never seen those movies is next to impossible. But even those films had their right foot firmly planted in reality despite their fantasy settings. The people in those movies seemed like real people, and their problems like real problems. The plots, though fantastical, made perfect sense within the worlds they've created. Although it may seem like a trivial thing to point out in a children's movie, Ponyo to be blunt is just nonsensical. For instance Soscay's mother, Leslie show's an alarming lack of concern for her five year old son who she leaves at home during a flood so bad it leaves her entire home town under water. Not only does she leave him there, but not once did she seem to worry about his safety. Miyazaki is famous for his incredible portrayal of realistic strong, independent women in his movies, so it's a real shame that Leslie didn't a) have a bigger role in the film, or b) act all that realistic once the second act began. She's an extremely likeable and well-crafted character at the beginning of the film, but somewhere along the way it seems the writers forgot about her and just used whatever excuse they could to get Soscay and Ponyo alone together. Again, this may sound trivial considering it IS a children's movie, but again I would like to point out this isn't just ANY children's movie, it's a MIYAZAKI children's movie, and that normally means it's a family movie that everyone can enjoy. It also seems to me that the characters of Soscay and Ponyo could have been used better had they been a bit older. The plot centers around Soscay needing to love Ponyo in order to bring balance to the world (or something), but creating a love story like this around two five year olds just seems odd. Creating a love story between  two young adults, ala Castle in the Sky, would have been more credible and would have made the stakes more real.

I just don't see many adults enjoying this film, or at least not enjoying it in the way they might enjoy Spirited Away or Castle in the Sky with their children. Don't let my negative tone fool you into thinking I didn't like Ponyo, by its own merits it's a good movie and certainly better than the trash most children's films are these days. Hence the positive rating. But I come to expect a bit more than just good from Miyazaki, which may not be fair I know, but when a director has such a consistent record of excellence, when I get merely good it's a bit of a letdown.

So if you're going to see Ponyo, and your over the age of say sixteen, watch it with a kid. Any kid. I guarantee they will love it, and you'll get a kick out of watching them love it.

1125409,5,7799127775,"I am overwhelmed with emotion as I sit here contemplating what to write about Ponyo. That might sound silly, but it's true. Here is an animated film which focuses on two children who are about 5-years-old, but the story works for any adult who is open to being moved by its charming characters. To be precise, one of the children begins life as a fish, before undergoing a transformation.

Director Hayao Miyazaki is some kind of magician. If you have ever seen My Neighbor Totoro, Spirited Away, or Princess Mononoke, you'll know what to expect from Ponyo. It's closest in feel to Totoro because of the ages of the main characters. Miyazaki's animations look like watercolor paintings rather than the 3D worlds found in Pixar's releases, but although they are less real, they have more warmth and heart than the world's second-best animation studio. I don't say that lightly.

If you're put off by the title, or the fact that the film was made in Japan, set aside those fears immediately. The Blu-ray comes with the original Japanese dub (although only in 5.1 Dolby Digital), and an HD dub from Disney for the US market featuring actors you mostly already know.

Ponyo has a special place in my heart because it is the first Studio Ghibli title that I ever bought. I had borrowed one or two before from my local library, but this first glimpse of Miyazaki's work in HD is something I will never forget. The experience begins with five minutes of action without any dialog, and the colors, imagination, movement, and sheer beauty of the animation will take your breath away. If Kubrick had made an animated film, the first five minutes might look similar.

After the initial sequence, we meet Sosuke (Frankie Jonas). He's a small boy who discovers something while he's playing by the beach; it turns out to be Ponyo (Noah Cyrus), who he mistakes for a goldfish. She's trapped in a discarded bottle, so he helps her break free. When he cuts his finger in the process, she licks the wound and heals him. Yes, Ponyo is a magical creature. The taste of human blood changes her nature. Sosuke takes care of her and keeps her in a bucket, but she is later returned to the ocean.

Ponyo's undersea world is just as fascinating as the one above. Her father, Fujimoto (Liam Neeson), is some kind of wizard who makes elixirs and helps keep nature in balance. He doesn't trust humans and fears for Ponyo's safety, so he's reluctant to allow her to leave her home. What he doesn't know is that Ponyo has come to love Sosuke, and wants to transform herself into a human girl so that she can be with him.

The two most common complaints I have heard about the film are that it is intended for small children and the story is hard to follow. I have never had trouble following the plot, and I think it will work for anyone who doesn't dismiss it as being too childish without even seeing it. This is a film for parents as well as children.

Miyazaki is an incredible study of human nature and knows exactly how to depict emotion in his drawings. I would say that it's almost impossible to watch without being moved in a positive way. Like Totoro, the story takes place in a world in which people care about each other. There are no villains of any kind. The story relies on events to drive it, and it's never boring. Notice how supportive Sosuke's mother (Tina Fey) is when he tells her that he's rescued a fish and that she has turned into a girl, or the respect that Sosuke has for his elders. There are a lot of good messages here for children (and adults).

I want to mention two more scenes before I stop talking about the plot. The first is one of the purest expressions of joy I have ever witnessed in a film, and shows Ponyo running along on top of the waves as she tries to reach Sosuke. Look at the expression on her face. She only has one thought, and it's driven by love. The other scene shows Ponyo and Sosuke recovering indoors after being soaked in a storm. It's meaning might not be immediately apparent, but if you have ever been cold or wet, remember how good it felt to be warmed by a meal and a hot drink. Miyazaki includes these scenes because every human being can identify with such feelings. Instead of being bombarded by action and conflict, we are shown a world in which real things happen, and the scenes are stronger because of it.

Ponyo is a magical story. It's hard to watch without breaking into a grin, and that feeling lasts for the duration of the film. If you decide to watch it and find that it touches you in the same way, I urge you to check out Miyazaki's entire catalog if you haven't already done so.

The Blu-ray presentation is excellent. The image can't be faulted and the US dub sounds great. The only tiny criticism is that the Japanese dub is not lossless, but at least it is present for those who insist on seeing films in their original language.",1355788800,2,4881,4.480314960629921

1125411,4,7799127775,"Studio Ghibli's 'Ponyo' is a magical story inspired by The Little Mermaid. The story is about the love between two individuals who inhabit two very different worlds and how they cross the barrier to be with each other. The animation is as gorgeous as it usually is in Studio Ghibli films, and the story is quite enchanting.

Ponyo is a goldfish who lives in the ocean, but wants to see more of what the ocean and the world have to offer. So one day she escapes from the watchful eye of her father and begins to explore the ocean, only to find herself swept away to land where she is rescued by a young boy named, Ssuke. Ponyo and Ssuke quickly grow attached to each other. However, Ponyo's father, fearing that she was kidnapped by the human boy, forcibly takes his daughter back. The father is not the villain of the story, but he is someone who has had bad experiences with human earlier in his life. He is naturally overprotective of his daughter. Poor Ssuke is desolate without Ponyo and Ponyo too feels saddened by the turn of events. But Ponyo is a plucky little goldfish, and having tasted a bit of human blood when she was on ground, transforms from goldfish to human and sets out to return to land and to Ssuke. The rest of the story swims along quite magically to a wonderful conclusion.

Ponyo has been compared to My Neighbor Totoro, and I can see that. Unlike other Studio Ghibli films, there is no real environmental message here, though there is some mention of balance. The film is just an enjoyable, sweet story (and certainly far happier than the original Hans Christian Anderson telling of The Little Mermaid).",1355011200,,1629,4.5563139931740615

The artwork is amazing (as is typical of the company), the characters are entertaining, and even the acting is great (fortunately it seems these children inherited the acting talent from their families).  While I have heard many people complain that it was more focused towards children, there's nothing to stop any adult from enjoying it.",1350259200,,620,4.660550458715596
1125783,2,7799127775,"I very nearly tossed the disc, ala frisbee style after being unable to switch to Japanese audio.  Only French or American dubs on the Blu-Ray. And the American dub is NOT good.  There are a few good voice over roles, but the instant Ponyo starts talking, it's like nails on a chalkboard.  So I wanted to hear the original Japanese.  Hum...

So I checked the box, and it listed Japanese audio for the 2nd disc.  DVD.  Not Blu-Ray.  Hum...  So then I put that disc in.  And found that I could not switch automatically to the Japanese.  I had to go through several menus, then restart the film.  Then skip manually to the chapter I wanted.  Then the subtitles were off (knowing quite a bit of Japanese, this was obvious), so luckily I was able to put the correct subtitles on (instead of captions).

A one star rating is kind of harsh, but I balanced the rating out to two stars.  It really deserves one star because:

YOU CANNOT WATCH PONYO ON BLU-RAY WITH THE ORIGINAL JAPANESE AUDIO!!!!

So that makes getting the Blu-Ray version of Ponyo a huge mistake for purists or true foreign film aficionados.  The other reason that I gave a one star rating is that the film isn't good enough to warrant raising the star rating.  I would give the film 3 stars normally if not for the huge slap in the face to those of us wanting Blu-Ray quality with the lossless Japanese audio.  Being a huge fan of Miyazaki, I can see that perhaps his creativity began running in a different direction in the end.  This was his last directed film, and though it was a decent film, even the newer Ghibli film Arietty (written by Miyazaki but not directed by) was much better.  It's not a bad film, just Miyazaki's weakest link.  Compared to his other masterpieces: Nasuicaa, Totoro, Laputa (Castle in the Sky), Kiki's Delivery Service, Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, and Howl's Moving Castle, one can safely say this film falls short compared to all of these.

It's a film about love and friendship, and it seems to start as a film against humanity's pollution of the seas.  But this never really pans out other than a few early shots.  It's the lack of depth that is the problem; the deeper and more complex stories are what raised the bar of his previous films.  In the end, Totoro is probably the most complex film with the subtle and hidden meanings which remind me of Spirit of the Beehive and Pan's Labrynth (and better than Pan's I think).  Kiki might have more in common with Ponyo than the other films do, but even Kiki has a little more to it, and more likable characters.

The animation was stunning.  I liked that Miyazaki wanted to go back to colorful, hand drawn animation with storybook looking backgrounds.  This was a huge plus.  But the positives can't outweigh the negatives.

Film - 3 stars
Failing to include the lossless Japanese audio on the Blu-Ray - 1 star

In ""Ponyo"" the boy is unsupervised playing by the water, people are underwater in various circumstances and through magic able to survive, the mother drives the car extremely fast and the boy is not always buckled up, and Ponyo licks the boy's blood.

1126019,4,7799127775,"Background

""Ponyo"" is a movie created by Hayao Miyazaki. It was released first in Japan in 2008 and then in the United Stated in 2009. ""Ponyo"" is Miyazaki's 8th film released by Studio Ghibli. The first has been nominated for many awards and won some of them, including the Japanese Academy awards for Animation of the Year. It is a hand-drawn animation unlike many of the animations produced today by companies like Pixar. Also, the movie was inspired by Hans Christian Anderson's ""The Little Mermaid.""

Story-line

""Ponyo"" is magical. It is about a girl, Ponyo, and a little boy, Sosuke. Ponyo is a mermaid. Her mother is Goddess of the sea and her father, Fujimoto, is a wizard of the sea. Fujimoto was once human, which explains Ponyo's human characteristic. Ponyo runs away from home and washes up on shore. Sosuke finds her and keeps her as a pet. When Fujimoto finds Ponyo, he forces her back home. Ponyo then uses majic to turn herself into a human.  In order for her to remain human Sosuke must fall in love with her.

What do I think?

Overall, I think Ponyo was an execellent movie. It was very alive and very captivating! I have seen many of Miyazaki's other movies such as ""Princess Mononoke,"" ""My Neighbor Totoro,"" ""Spirited Away,"" ""Kiki's Delivery Service,"" and ""Howl's Moving Castle."" All of these movies were to my liking. They all incorporate some form of magic! That and the animation, I believe, helps keep the viewer captivated.

However, I did think that for this to be specifically a children's movie some parts of it were a little vague. Like in the beginning, even as an adult, I didn't understand much of what was going on. It took me a little while to catch on. As an adult, I was looking for more lead-ins and more background information on Ponyo and her family, even on Sosuke and his family. Also, the main characters were 5-year olds. They are not qualified to make a decision about love. Not yet. Atleast the little mermaid was a teenager! Other than that I had no problems with it. I am trying to keep in mind that I am viewing through the eyes of an adult, but even through the adult lenses I remained captivated, and I believe a child will too. My three year old children enjoyed it, just the same!",1344124800,,2234,4.57

1126413,5,7799127775,"My wife and I watched Ponyo one night on a whim. I'd seen a Miyazaki film a few years back and thought we could give this one a shot. I did not regret it. I've watched it one or two more times since, and have bought this movie for my wife.

Ponyo is a beautiful story. It is beautifully written, it is beautifully animated. I love it. It is such a human movie. It has frustration, love, commitment, reconciliation, etc. The characters are so lovable. They remind you what is good in people.

Again, I loved this movie. My wife did too. I'm sure kids would love it as well. Do yourself a favor, contact the inner kid in you, and show them this movie.

Hope this review helped. Let me know in a comment if you have any questions, or need to know any more reasons why you should watch Ponyo.",1329782400,,788,4.171052631578948
1126414,4,7799127775,"Miyazaki has done it again: created a charming and engaginge animation, one with a spirit all its own. Fans will recognize elements from his earlier efforts, including his passion for biomorphic flying machines (flying through water this time, but still) and strong little girl in the leading role. It also presents something of an eco-fable, with seas rising as they threaten to do in our real, warming world. But, as in Miyazaki's previous films, even familiar elements combine to make a unique story.

""Ponyo"" has been likened to Hans Christian Andersen's ""Little Mermaid,"" probably by people who remember only the disneyfied version of the story. Yes, the water-girl loves the boy of dry land. This story, however offers a lighter spirit and happier ending than the dour Nordic tale. It also blends in, perhaps, a scrap of ""Sorcerer's Apprentice"" and possibly others. That hardly makes this a derivative work, however. The plot as a whole, along with the imagery that carries it, comes across as fresh despite its familiar elements.

Although adults can enjoy Miyazaki's animations at many levels, he intends them for kids, too. This time, the target age appears to be five or so, the age of the boy (Sosuke) who costars in this feature. As such, the mood stays lighter than in some of Miyazaki's other films, and there's a big kid-power message as well. His light touch keeps the serious issues from becoming grim, though. This is an entertainment before anything else. Although not as striking as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Princess-Mononoke/dp/B00003CXBK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Princess Mononoke</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spirited-Away/dp/B00005JLEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spirited Away</a>, it certainly entertains.

The bonus-jonas and Cyrus hand-me-down cheapened the whimsical and mystical qualities of this film. The theme song, alone, should have been a dead giveaway. An auto-tuned fanservice? Really, Disney? What part of a small demigod's quest to be united with a small boy--and ham--told you that you should make an auto-tuned pop song? Ridiculous. This film could have been good, or at least less campy. If the English scriptwriters hadn't botched the plot, and if the voice-casters were less interested in loading a DVD BLURAY case up with familiar (and overrated, overdramatized) disney pop star names, and were more invested in conveying the magic of studio ghibli--a formula and institution which has proven itself true over the years--then I would be rating this higher, instead of posting what I'm sure will be a very ill-received review.",1325462400,,921,4.987012987012987

With Ponyo, he remembers the story, the depiction of human emotions.  A lot of it was fantastical, but he is most influenced by how Sosuke loved and cared.

I have to admit that when I first watched it, I wasn't too interested - not used to the style of animation and seemed strange to hear English used to voice over Japanese.  However, after seeing it a few times and actually getting into the storyline, it is very imaginative and sweet. A great magical story that emphasizes the innocence - and determination - younger children have, which is often dismissed/overlooked.  Originally it was watched via streaming on another vendors site; however, it switched to DVD only rental after a few weeks so my daughter could no longer watch it.  I purchased the DVD as both of us missed watching the movie.  It has a great cast for the English version and you do get used to the voiced-over dialog not matching up.

1126679,5,7799127775,"Like Japan's answer to `The Little Mermaid', `Ponyo' is every bit as enchanting and as memorable as that Disney classic.  With sharply used animation that is beautiful to look at while wholly nostalgic (this isn't your average 3D CGI spectacle), `Ponyo' creates something original and authentic.

The film follows a young Goldfish Princess who is washed ashore after attempting to escape the domineering control of her human father, an evil wizard who hates humankind for destroying to ocean.  He is married to the Ocean's queen, a magnificent being who is far more levelheaded and endearing than her husband.  This young Princess winds up stuck in a bottle and is found by a young boy named Koichi.  Koichi is living alone with his mother while his father, a sailor, is away at work.  Koichi is enamored by this creature, a fish with the face of a human, and while he is warned by others to get rid of the fish (when creatures with faces come out of the sea, there is a tsunami), he keeps the Princess, especially when she begins to turn into a little girl.  He calls her Ponyo, and soon Ponyo and Koichi are the bestest of friends.  Sadly, Ponyo's decision to leave her aquatic home sets the world off balance, and as the Moon is pulled closer to the Earth, the waters begin encroaching on the land with devastating force.

At the core of this film is a beautiful story of friendship and love that blossoms between two souls; Ponyo and Koichi.  They share a need to escape their current predicaments.  Ponyo feels oppressed and conditioned by her father's fears and loathing and Koichi internalizes his feelings about his father being gone and his mother slipping into depression.  They use each other to forget about their worries and `be kids', which is such a beautiful sentiment used in this film.  Both Ponyo and Koichi just want to be kids.

A shockingly rewarding film, `Ponyo' is one of the best animated films I've seen in a long time and is certainly a joy to be seen and remembered!",1317600000,,1995,4.662857142857143

1126683,5,7799127775,"The music is very much like classical music, and with the opening sequences we get an underwater symphony of light and sound, a Ghibli Nemo but with strange boats, creatures, and magicians. Nice just-under-the-water scenes, where the surface gloats suspended above us like a sun-glowing tent. The main villain/father figure looks like Alice Cooper, but he speaks Japanese, of course. The little five-year-old Sosuke is a sweet little boy, and he loves Ponyo, the little goldfish he finds. His mom, Misa, drives along mountainous roads such as you'd see in Amalfi in Italy quite a lot like Lupin did in the Castle of Cagliostro, or like the raiders to in Laputa, both Studio Ghibli films directed by Miyazaki Hayao, the director of this film. There are great scenes of wind and sea power, and our modern world is dwarfed by the spirit of nature (of course). The story get a little strange, when we learn that this little goldfish could set the entire balance of nature a-kilter, and cause the moon to collide with the earth (?!?!), but this is not all that important to the story, and it's more about the love between Sosuke and our little magickal childe, Ponyo. The scenes show Ponyo discovering ham, instant noodles, shortwave radio, power generators and honey tea. The film coughs up words like ""Devonian Sea"", which apparently is a geological period and system of the Paleozoic Era, spanning from 416-359 million years ago when the pectoral and pelvic fins of lobe-finned fish evolved into legs as they started to walk on land as tetrapods and had names like Cycloptopus and Devonychus. Go figure! One of the best parts of the story is an encounter with Ponyo's mother, a monstrous (and monstrously beautiful) sea spirit who is bliss personified. The story is fun and touching, and at the end one father says goodbye to go back to his home in the sea while another returns to his home from the sea.",1314316800,,1902,4.78419452887538

Having seen it a dozen times, the film's gentle story of innocent love and friendship, coupled with gorgeous, artful images of a Japanese seatown have grown on me.  While I would watch Spirited Away or My Neighbor Totoro when my kid is not around, I am thankful to Miyazaki that he produced a film appropriate in tone, story, message and editing, for young children.  We are one of those families that tries to minimize exposure to mainstream kid's movies, mostly because their pace is too fast, with too much emphasis on action and stories revolving around adult love and marriage (e.g., the Disney princess films).  Ponyo takes it's time, but delivers magical moments and a pleasurable stillness that I have never seen achieved in US animated films.  As many times as I have seen it, I still delight in it's funniest and most touching moments.

I especially don't buy the scene where the two main super cute little kid characters recite from memory the scientific names of ancient sea creatures with the rapidity one would only expect from a seasoned paleoichthyologist.

The English translating the Japanese is different from the English on English which you can be interesting to follow. He calls his mother Mommy in the English/English selection and ""Lisa"" in the Japanese/English version.

Great for kids and for adults who long ago got over the feeling that kids movies are for kids.

A cute movie which started my collection of H. Miyazaki's films. One reason his films are so good here is because Pixar has taken a special interest and did the work on the English version.

Even Americans are likely to find it hard to digest and for English, Australian and other ""English"" speakers - have a pack of Immodium handy!

The film itself is a beautiful Japanese take on the Little Mermaid, and how delightfully it is done. The Japanese can really do these things so differently, (as one should expect of course), and with such style. I urge everyone to look at the extras, especially the Japanese cast recording session and the Miyazaki interview where he makes his points so well.

There is only one way to watch this and that is with the Japanese track, (lossless 6.1 in region B countries) with subtitles. The American dub is horrible and that is why I have marked the final score down as kids will need the dub. What a shame.

1127120,5,7799127775,"Like all Miyazaki films, Ponyo is an adorable story - one you and your children are likely to remember for a lifetime. It's the story about a young goldfish who lives in the sea with many sisters, and her father, the alchemist, Fujimoto. Ponyo's mother is a beautiful sea goddess, Gran Mamare who seems to belong more to the sea than to her family, although she's there when they need her.
Ponyo is a very curious goldfish, and one day, while out exploring, she gets stuck in a jar. The jar floats up along the shore, where a little boy, Sosuke, finds the jar, and tries to get Ponyo out. Fujimoto goes out in search of Ponyo when he realizes she's missing, and as Sosuke is running up the hill to his house - where his mother has been calling him, Fujimoto notices that Sosuke is carrying her. He panics because he's not very fond of people, and fears what will be done to his daughter. Oh...did I mention Fujimoto is a man?  LOL  I think they explained that a bit in the movie, but not in any great detail.
After Sosuke finds Ponyo, she falls in love with her, and she wants to become a human girl. So that I don't ruin it all, I'll just tell you that the Sea Goddess has the power to make it happen, but it depends on whether Sosuke can love Ponya enough to make it happen.

1127122,4,7799127775,"Knowing where to start with a review of `Ponyo' is a tricky one. It is a film with a great deal going for it, but with some minor flaws as well. This is loosely based on `The Little Mermaid' and like that film this is aimed towards kids. With this in mind it is less disappointing for those (like myself) who are fans of the more adult themed films from Ghibli, like `Spirited Away' and `Howls Moving Castle'.

There is a slight departure in the animation style of previous Ghibli/Miyazaki films. This isn't quite so gritty or fantastical and it is more simplistic in general. If you are used to the lush renderings of films such as `Totoro' then the blank, bold colours will disappoint you. The style here is much simpler, with less brush strokes and artistic nuance; but once you get used to the animation style of this particular film you can quickly become engrossed in the fairytale.

Like many modern Ghibli films there is all star vocal dubbing, with stars such as Liam Neeson and Cate Blanchett and these fit in reasonably well with the animation. There are also typical Miyazaki environmental themes, without them being rammed down our throats, and there is the occasional mention of man kinds pollution of the sea to ponder upon. The charm so prevalent in Ghibli characters is on show here as well and Ponyo reminds me of the kids in Totoro at times. Miyazaki's love of flying machines is also represented as well, although the main flying machine is a winged boat that `flies' under water.

This has a simple storyline, which you would expect from a kids film, and the ending was mildly lack lustre, with a test for Sosuke that isn't especially taxing and for more adult viewers or parents watching this will feel slightly anti-climatic. But saying that and despite my earlier reservations about the animation, this is still a reasonable Ghibli film and taken in it's own right and considered as a kids film, this isn't too bad overall. I only hope the next offering from Miyazaki is aimed towards adults and returns to the lush animation of his roots. 3  - 4 stars.

1127125,4,7799127775,"Every so often, I want to watch a movie that actually has some taste and quality behind it, and when I want that, who do I go to?  Well, Pixar, obviously.  But aside from Pixar, a second choice is Hiyao Miyazaki; a master filmmaker and storyteller from Japan.

Now, before I say anything else, I feel I should say that I place Miyazaki second, not because he's not a good storyteller.  In many ways, I consider him a better storyteller than anyone else in the world today.  The drawback to his movies, which always impedes my ability to enjoy them is their subject matter.

Miyazaki has a fascination with the strange and bizarre, which is no crime.  Disney does too, but where Disney focuses largely on the realm of fantasy, Miyazaki's films too often use the occult as their backbone.  Kiki's Delivery Service was about a witch, Castle in the Sky prominently featured magic crystals and spells, and most of his other films (Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro, Princess Mononoke, etc...) are steeped in eastern mysticism and bunk spirituality if you look at them too closely.  I consider them all entertaining, and in most cases, fun romps through a welcoming fantasy land, but I hesitate to show them to children, because of the mixed messages that this kind of world view sends.

I only start out with this objection to get it out of the way, because this element is as deep in Ponyo as in any other Miyazaki film.  Magic potions of some type seem to drive the film's alpha plot, not only giving Ponyo and her father their powers to start with, but creating one of the biggest floods in history, and nearly destroying the world.  It's implied that Ponyo's father keeps these potions for constructive purposes, though, so it's not specifically ""bad guy magic,"" like with a character like Maleficent.  However, the worst thing is the character of Ponyo's mother.  She's a mighty, inhuman being who seems to embody and control the ocean, which I normally wouldn't have a problem with.  I'd just think she was a superhero.  However, midway through the film, she saves a bunch of ships from sinking with her powers, and sailors on those ships not only call her a ""goddess,"" but begin to visibly pray to her.  Needless to say, I won't be showing this film to kids without a major footnote or something.  We frown on paganism in my family.

That having been said, as a movie, Ponyo is really quite lovely, if a bit misguided from time to time.  The background music is absolutely stunning; some of the best I've heard in any film for a long time, although the characters themselves don't sing; another typical staple of Miyazaki films.  The animation is very beautiful too, with a lot of gorgeous panoramas of harbors, undersea vistas and raging storms.

The tale involves a little, red fish, mutated by a magic potion, who gradually grows more powerful, until she decides to escape from her father; the potion-making Fujimoto.  She washes up on shore, gets caught in an old jar, and is liberated by a boy named Sosuke, who she befriends.  Eventually, Ponyo is recaptured by her father, but decides to use her magic to metamorph into a human and escape.  She accidentally absorbs her father's strongest magic potion, causing a massive flood as a result, and going to find Sosuke.  However, Ponyo is still only a little girl, and doesn't understand all the damage she's doing, which is why Fujimoto tries to track her down after this.  Eventually, he meets with her mother (the water being I mentioned earlier,) and she offers to let Ponyo remain human, if Sosuke loves her enough.

Ponyo and Sosuke need to navigate the flood she caused, but she gradually starts to lose her magic powers, and turn back into a fish.  Soon, Fujimoto shows up and takes them to meet Ponyo's mother, who says that Ponyo can remain human forever, but she has to give up her magic.  She also tells Sosuke the truth about Ponyo, and asks him if that's alright, and if he still loves her, even knowing that she's really a fish who turns into a person.  After they each make their choice, the film doesn't last much longer, but it's implied that things will eventually get back to normal.

As a story, Ponyo is told much like Spirited Away; a lot of things happening at once, and hardly ever are real explanations given for them.  The audience needs to figure certain things out for themselves as the film progresses, and the potential for confusion is high, but in a way, all that does is change the tone of the film to less of a storytelling vehicle, and more of a piece of artwork.  Unlike Spirited Away, this film impressed me with its dazzling sights and beautiful music, and that's a strong word in its favor already; especially when the film specifically makes that it's point.

Ponyo herself is an unusual character.  In a certain sense, she's shrill and often foolishly endangering people.  Bottomlessly selfish in her quest to get her way, and frankly, I don't find her all that cute, though she does sometimes like to help people when she thinks she can without sacrificing her dreams.  Thanks largely to that, I didn't find her a detriment to the movie either.  As a character, she's pretty basic and believable, and she brings out the best in her co-star Sosuke; a nice, responsible little boy who helps out his mother.

Fujimoto left an impression on me too.  He's not menacing in any sense, in spite of his powers, and often, he even comes across as just foolish and inept.  However, he's also not really all that villainous, though he does express a desire to see ""the human race"" brought to heel at one point.  Aside from abducting his own daughter and imprisoning her in a bubble for being young and foolish, he doesn't really do anything bad, and his status as a bit of a bumbler makes him a sympathetic character as well, though it does mean that this movie lacks a real antagonist, unless you count Ponyo herself.

My overall impression of this interplay of the characters within the setting of the story was more like an impressionist painting than a fairy tale.  Rather that being clear or direct with its plot points, or trying to tell you about what's actually going on in Ponyo's world, and what kind of adventure she's having, the film spends lots of time instead trying to be beautiful and inspire awe with its sound and visuals, and I certainly will not claim that's not a valid way to do things.  In a sense, I found it refreshing.

When it comes to the messages that this film delivers, I admit that it was hard to find one that really stood out.  I've been told that environmentalism is present in this movie, but I just don't see it.  The environment is beautifully-rendered, but barely features into the plot itself; it's a film about magical creatures interacting with normal people.  I guess you could say that the message is something like ""don't mess around with magic potions.  Somebody always gets hurt.""

However, in addition to this central message, there are also others; messages about family, about commitments made to the people you love, and how important it is to do our best to fulfill them, and to not torture ourselves when the option is taken out of our hands.  They're all subtly-delivered, but they're all there.  That having been said, I only have one more thing to bring up.

Near the end, when Sosuke is approached by Ponyo's mother, she explains to him that Ponyo was a fish who turned into a human, and wanted to know if Sosuke still loved and accepted her, even knowing that.  Two questions are hidden here; does Sosuke like Ponyo as a person; and not just because of her magic?  Furthermore, can Sosuke continue to love Ponyo, even though she's not of the same race as him?  This subtle question about racism was very well-delivered in the Japanese subtitled version of this film, though I'm afraid the delivery was a bit less artfully done in the english dub.  You see, the phrase they used was ""accept you as you are,"" while in the Japanese, it was something like ""Love and accept Ponyo for what she truly is.""  I need to say that I prefer the more direct translation.  Why even bring this up?  Well...

The problem is, America is a cultural warzone right now, and a lot of terms and expressions have been co-opted by one ideology or another to serve their nefarious ends.  At the moment, ""accept you as you are"" is a very loaded term, and has connotations in America which are just as negative as calling Ponyo a ""comrade.""  I only bring this up to be thorough, however, and because it slightly impeded my enjoyment of the film when I watched it in English.

Lastly, I feel I would be remiss if I didn't mention the remix of the ending theme that was done by the english dub, which is in a very different music style, and is much more discordant than the original Japanese version (which is also included, if you want to watch it with subtitles.)  I didn't think it was a movie-destroying problem, but I know fans of the original would want me to at least bring it up.

For all my complaining, though, my overall impressions of the film were very enjoyable and positive.  I can't give it a perfect grade, but it was a very good film, and when I have a couple hours to myself, with not much else to do, I may just decide to go swimming with Ponyo again.",1293926400,,9286,4.593446601941747
1127126,3,7799127775,"I, among many other people, love Miyazaki's work. In fact I own some of his films. Ponyo, however, is another story. Back in 2007 when I heard on imdb.com and saw a trailer on youtube.com that Miyazaki was in the project of another anime film I thought ""Awesome! Can't wait to see"". Seeing the Japanese trailer I thought ""Cute. Chibi-like anime (I like). Japanese actors seemed great. When's it coming to America?""It's been about two years later when John Lasseter (PIXAR/Toy Story) among with other producers and other workers from Disney became affectionately involved in this film when somebody realizes, ""Hey, you know what? This story is very similar to our Little Mermaid.""

That's when the American/English actors/actresses were in the project voicing these characters. I honestly believe that the American producers, or whoever is in charge of choosing actors, could have done a better job picking the right actors for these characters, but they feel like since Hannah Montana and The Jonas Brothers came along the same year Ponyo did somebody thought lets get the youngest sister of Hannah Montana and the youngest brother from the Jonas Brothers to be in this film and make a song for the ending credits. How cute.

Something tells me that the American producers/agents were on a extreme tight schedule so they thought ""Cool lets get these two youngsters as the stars - easy money"". As for the other actors - I don't want to say they did awful 'cause then I be an idiot, but I must say that some (NOT ALL, but some) could've done better. I mean some of the American actors were just sticking out like a sore thumb. It's noticeable and sometimes it can be an eye sore. I mean compared to Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, and Howl's Moving Castle they actually, in my opinion, had actors Americans knew which one was best for each role. Heck, I never would have thought Billy Bob Thornton and Jada Pinkett Smith would be in an anime, but I think they did well.

Story - like I mentioned, Ponyo is like Miyazaki's version of The Little Mermaid. Is this good or bad? I'll explain - Like the story it begins under the sea (lol), but instead of a castle it starts with what looks like a boat with fins. Ironically the father of Ponyo, Fujimoto, hates humans, yet he's driving a boat that can submerge and float. How hypocritical. So escaping, Ponyo encounters a five-year-old boy named Sosuke and the two of them become the start of the story. Their friendship leads the townspeople in jeopardy when the town experiences heavy rainstorms, tsunamis, and floods, so the two of them must journey on a small boat Ponyo magically bloated from Sosuke's toy boat. They search to find Sosuke's mother (Lisa), who watches the local senior citizens. So far so good. They finally find land and walk when they find Lisa's car leaving Sosoke helpless, which cuts to the next scene. At the bottom of the new sea (Thanks to the flood) the local senior citizens are fine and walking like their young again. Lisa talks to Ponyo's mother, which I'm assuming tells her everything what's going on. So Fujimoto arrives to tell Sosuke that everything's going to be alright and leads to the finale of the story where Ponyo and her mother agree that she wants to stay with Sosuke. Finally the ending settles with Ponyo, as a fish, bounces in the air and lands perfectly safe on Soskue's lips, giving a kiss at the ending. So I'm suppose to assume that these two are destined to be in love for the rest of their lives.

All I can say is that overall this movie is half-and-half (Good and bad). It's like the first half of the film had a great star, encounter, and chemistry with the characters and with story, but all of that kind of backfires the audience leaving them with questions about most things occurring in the story. I think what bothers me the most are the American producers who felt like to me that they did it quick just to get it over with to get on with their other projects. Some of the American actors weren't so great. In fact why would there be pre-teen actors portraying a five-year-old boy and girl. That's what gets me. The musical score by Joe Hisaishi was fantastic. I love nearly all of his work. The animation was also great. Similar animation styles from his early works like My Neighbor Totoro. Finally the ending of the story felt awkward and not entirely fulfilling. I hope I haven't upset any anime fans or anybody else. I'm just speaking what I felt about this movie. Again I love Miyazaki, but this movie wasn't that great.",1292544000,,4537,4.646326276463263
1127127,5,7799127775,"This is a great family movie if you have toddlers.  My son is 2 and he absolutely loves it.  He wakes up in the morning and it's the first word out his mouth, ""Ponyo"".

He takes her and spends a day with her he names her Ponyo, and after a day she in turn wants to be human and eat ham just like the boy.  The fish's father disapproves and the movie transforms into this magical masterpiece.  Personally I enjoy watching it too; the colors are so vivid and the storyline is easy to follow.

When we go on long trips (6 or more hours in the car) we take the movie and wait till the little one is about to melt down in a toddler frenzy and we put the movie for him and it calms him down immediately.

But Ponyo is perfect. It finds a tone that is rare and priceless in children's movies. On one hand, it has a strong dramatic side, with exciting magical transformations and intense forces of nature. On the other hand, there is no antagonist, nobody in the film is evil. Ponyo's strict father is never really scary. His visual design makes him look like a stage magician or an eccentric inventor; it's easy to see that he's essentially kind. All the other characters are unreservedly good, even the grumpy old lady at the nursing home.

Sure, at some point your kids will grow older, and then you'll have to teach them that the world isn't always (or ever) like this. For example, at some point you might show them&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grave-Of-The-Fireflies/dp/B00006HAWP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grave Of The Fireflies</a>. But when they're really young, Ponyo is what they really need. There's enough action and adventure, so this isn't Barney, and some of the visuals are unworldly enough to keep the movie from being a syrupy cute-fest. But there's no fighting or cruelty, and the underlying message is decent and good for children. To find something else with those qualities, you'd have to go back to the old&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Moominland/dp/0374350302/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Moominland</a>&nbsp;books.

Additionally, the protagonist Sosuke is a fine example for children. He's not entirely quiet and obedient, but he loves both his parents very much. Even at his age, he already has a nascent sense of obligation. Adults talk to him in a way that makes him feel grown-up and responsible, asking him to protect his mother. He admires and tries to emulate his father (and there is a father -- he may be absent, but he works hard for his family). Lastly, he is admirably brave, venturing forth over a submerged seascape and into a dark tunnel and overcoming his fears.

You can still see some of the rough edges that are present in all of Miyazaki's work. The storyline is a little loose. Why exactly does it upset the balance of the universe when a little goldfish decides to be human? I would have thought that the piles of underwater trash would do more harm in that regard. And what is exactly is the test that Sosuke is supposed to pass? We only see him going through the tunnel. Sosuke's father is transported to a strange place with countless other lost ships, but nothing is really ever made of this place, and he easily returns at the end. But in this film, all that might actually be for the best. All we really need to know is that Sosuke perceives that his father might be in danger and that he has to be responsible. Whether or not there is any actual danger is beside the point.

Miyazaki's grotesque side also shows through when Ponyo grows ungainly chicken-like stick arms. But this, again, is temporary, and she gains a completely human appearance very shortly afterward. Quite harmless, compared to the half-hour long sequence of the masked being vomiting black goo in Spirited Away. It's eclipsed by the number of majestic visual set-pieces, like the colourful underwater parade at the beginning or Ponyo's chase after Sosuke (riding a school of giant liquid fish, no less) after becoming human.

Ponyo herself is an old archetype of children's literature, the Magical Friend who is more powerful, outgoing and fun than the protagonist, yet utterly devoted to him, and often lacking in direction, only reaching her potential in the protagonist's presence (Astrid Lindgren had a lot of those characters -- recall&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pippi/dp/0142402494/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pippi</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Karlson/dp/0192727729/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Karlson</a>). She does most of the work helping Sosuke find his mother, but only because Sosuke supplies the determination. She doesn't have a lot of personality other than enjoying ham, but again, this helps to make Sosuke responsible for his own decisions.

You go through a dark tunnel, and at the end your father comes home and your mother gives you a hug and makes dessert for you, and even the unfriendly wizard turns out to be a fundamentally nice guy who even asks you to try to remember him warmly. As long as you love your parents and protect your friends, everything will turn out fine. All the time mankind spent making art and poetry, and that's still the purest image anyone ever came up with. You want your kids to grow up to be decent people, this is the first step.",1289692800,,5137,5.691003911342895

1127413,2,7799127775,"Wow, I am going to be hated for this.  This is my first ever unfavorable opinion of a Miyazaki film, and it saddens me greatly that I did not enjoy it.  But I honestly did not enjoy ""Ponyo"".  The artwork and animation are both great, so I give it 2 stars for that.  But...

  I didn't like any of the characters very much.  Miyazaki's usually rich character development seems missing here.  Maybe this _was_ meant for 5-year olds, I dunno, but I just couldn't make much sense of hardly anything in the movie.  It jumped around from one place to the other and I just couldn't come to care about any of the characters very much.  The slight plot didn't do a whole lot for me, and I'm growing ever more tired of ""ecological messages"", especially when voiced by known Hollywood Liberals, and wrapped in dealings with Moon/Sea/Whatever gods/goddesses.

  I thought that Ponyo's father was just creepy, and his mumblings did little to explain anything, and at times just seemed forced to provide enough convenient narration to keep things moving.  So much of ""Ponyo"" just feels like it needs a lot more fleshing out.  Her mother was left just too much of a mystery for me as well.

  Sosuke's parents are likewise cyphers.  His mother's driving was insane, and his Dad is more or less a vapor on the sea.

  So much is just rushed along.  The fate of the world depends on the love of a young boy for a fish/girl/goddess???  Hrmmm...  So what happens to the moon & other disastrous things approaching, why do the old ladies feel better, what's going on...???

  I don't mean to hurt anyone's feelings or take a child's movie too seriously, I just want to express that though I consider myself a huge Miyazaki fan, I was disappointed with this one.  It's just nowhere near the level of ""Totoro"" or ""Spirited Away"" or ""Princess Mononoke"", to me.

  And I wondered if it was just too ""Japanese"" for me, so I asked a Japanese friend, who had told me before I watched it that she hadn't liked it, if I was just ""not getting"" it. She told me that she hadn't understood a lot of it either, didn't like the movie, and thought it was a big mess, so I don't think I have this opinion just because I'm a big dumb American.  But that's a sample size of only 2.

  Well, anyway, this is just my personal opinion of one movie by an otherwise superb director and animator.  I hope that others continue to enjoy ""Ponyo"", but I don't think it should be blindly accepted as terrific just because it's ""a Miyazaki"".  If I was 5 again, maybe I'd love it :)",1287964800,4,2529,4.427015250544662

Between the exceptional animation, inspiring characters, and heart-warming story, this film successfully captures an audience of 1-100 and beyond.

The visuals in this film are awe-inspiring... from Ponyo running gleefully along huge waves comprised of water-fish, to the magnificent sea spirit portrayed in soothing, powerful colors, to the elderly running free of their wheelchairs in an aquatic orb reminiscent of ""Eden""... this movie is guaranteed to light up the hearts and faces of any child.

The storyline is such a beautiful portrayal of childhood innocence, and the enduring nature of unadulterated genuine love. Ponyo shows no hesitation in trading magic for humanity in the name of love, reminding us all that power and possessions are of little importance.

The characters are almost personifications of positive emotions. Ponyo herself is the epitome of the most unwavering, naive, pristine joy we could all use a little more of in our lives. Be it a light bulb, a bucket, or HAM, everything is an exciting new discovery that ""blows her mind"" in the most wonderful way. Sosuke is inspiring in the way he doesn't question anything, and just allows life to take him on a beautiful journey. ""My fish is now a little girl""... ""That prehistoric fish has come to life""... ""The elderly can run again""... none of these concepts seem far-fetched or unbelievable in any way to Sosuke. Sosuke's mother is wonderfully dysfunctional yet determined. When Sosuke sees Ponyo running atop waves in the midst of a storm of biblical proportions, she stops the car in order to look for the little girl, trusting her 5 year old son in a way few parents trust their children.

All in all, this movie is a must-watch for any family. I personally watched it with a group of friends and family ranging from less than 1 year old to 35, and we all shared the same hysterical giggles and elation.",1287619200,,2376,5.799426934097421

1127422,5,7799127775,"If you're already familiar with the films of Miyazaki, Ponyo will strike you as being a lot lighter and simple -- feel great fluff.  However, if you're new to Miyazaki and just looking for a good film to watch with your child, you're likely to be blown away.

On the one hand, Ponyo is far from Miyazaki's greatest work.  It lacks depth, dramatic tension, and even a comprehensible plot.  A lot of this simple but unique spin on The Little Mermaid simply doesn't make any sense.  Fortunately the stunning characters and their idealic rural/coastal Japanese setting keep you entertained enough so as not to really notice.  This is a beautiful, beautiful film about a sweet boy, a sweet half fish/half girl, and their incredibly sweet childhood love for each other that's more than platonic, less than romantic, and somehow truer than any other love in the world.  The fact that Ponyo's dad lives in an air bubble under the sea, yet must spray himself with water so as not to dry out on land, doesn't seem to matter as much in contrast.  It doesn't even matter so much that, at the end, we really have no idea how Saske loving Ponyo is going to stop the underground well from bringing the moon closer to the world in order to make the tides rise and destroy all of humanity, which her dad planned all along but now wants to stop for no apparent reason(??????).

In the end, it was never the plot that really mattered, just the characters.  Ponyo is a charming film that reminds us how magical a world childhood can be, shows us how parents, the elderly, and even neighbors can play a positive role in such a world, and enthralls us in endearing animation all the while.  And, while the starr-studded vocal credits seem entirely unnecessary, they do an excellent job of conveying the voices of this world, particularly Noah Cyrus as Ponyo.

Ponyo may lack the depth and epic magnitude of Miyazaki classics like Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke, but it more than makes up for it in beauty, innocence, and tear-inducing happiness.",1283731200,3,2028,4.665730337078652

1127662,4,7799127775,"Ponyo (which is also known as Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea) is a film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki.  For this film, Miyazaki chose to make a completely 2D film, and not utilize any 3D computer effects.  This approach gives Ponyo a very distinct feel when compared to some of the more recent films that have been produced by Studio Ghibli.  However, I believe that the simplicity of the animation really works well with the story being told in the film.  Ponyo is a very family-friendly film, and can be enjoyed by both younger and older viewers alike.

There is one bonus feature on the first DVD, which is a roughly three-minute documentary titled, ""Disc Introduction - Meet Ponyo.""  This documentary features Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall, who were involved with producing the English dub of the film.

The second disc in the set has a set up menu as well, which allows you to choose between English and Japanese audio.  The features are split into two sections: ""Original Japanese Storyboards"" and ""The World of Ghibli.""  Just like on Disney's previous releases of Studio Ghibli films, the ""Original Japanese Storyboards"" is simply a version of the film with storyboards.

The menu for ""The World of Ghibli"" is split into two sections: ""Behind the Studio"" and ""Other Ghibli Worlds Preview.""  It starts out with five documentaries, which run anywhere from 2-5 minutes, discussing various aspects of producing Ponyo (and some also briefly touch on some of Miyazaki's other works).  These subtitled documentaries feature either Hayao Miyazaki or Toshio Suzuki (the producer).  This is followed by a nine-and-a-half minute excerpt from a Japanese documentary about where Ponyo is set.  This is followed by a roughly eight-minute documentary about how Joe Hiashi scored some of Miyazaki's films.  Then, there are the original Japanese trailers (which are two trailers that run for three-and-a-half minutes).  The final feature in this menu is ""Behind the Microphone,"" a six-minute long documentary about recording the English dub of Ponyo.

The ""Other Ghibli Worlds Preview"" has sections for My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service, and Castle in the Sky.  Each one has a short documentary featuring Miyazaki.

On this disc, there is also ""Enter the Lands.""  In the menu for this feature, there are elements from all of Studio Ghibli's films, but only elements for Ponyo, Kiki's Delivery Service, My Neighbor Totoro, and Castle in the Sky can be selected.  For Ponyo, there is a character quiz.  For the other three films, you see a short promo, and then 3-4 page menus with clickable elements (characters give you character bios, and other items react when chosen).

If you are a fan of Miyazaki, or you enjoy the films of Studio Ghibli, then you should see Ponyo.  Even though some of the features on disc two of the Disney DVD set are a little disappointing, this is a DVD that should be in the collection of any anime fan.

1127665,5,7799127775,"This 2008 movie by Studio Ghibli (Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle) was directed and written by Hayao Miyazaki and is loosely based on The Little Mermaid.  The story follows a little fish-girl, Ponyo, that runs away from her father and wants to turn into a human and be with a little 5-year old boy, S'suke, that she meets.  The story ensues as Ponyo attempts to become human and threatens the environmental balance of the world.

I had high expectations for this movie as I fell in love with Spirited Away and Miyazaki did not disappoint me.  I have never seen 2d animation that can compare to the quality in Miyazaki's movies.  Ponyo takes it to a completely new level with the style and scope of animation.  The detail of the water, colors, and fish is artistic and majestic to say the least.  Animation aside, the story and plot of this movie keep you enthralled and excited to see what happens next.  I think it's a good recommendation for an animated movie that draws you into the plot and characters so much that you forget it's animated.  Ponyo and he friend seem so alive that it was easy to become immersed in the story.

The only portion to disappoint me in this movie was the last song during the ending credits.  I thought the music throughout the story was lilting and pretty like what I was watching and then this last ""theme"" song comes on at the end of the credits like a childish and obnoxious TV show.

That being said, I loved this movie and highly suggest you see it.",1279497600,2,1491,4.481481481481482

My daughter liked ""Ponyo"" though she was not as enraptured with it as she was with Totoro (she did not request a repeat viewing like she did with Totoro). The storyline is interesting enough, though it is reminiscent of The Little Mermaid. A little fish named Ponyo (looking a lot like a little girl) lives in her father's underwater kingdom with thousands of other fish siblings. A misadventure puts her in the path of a little boy named Sosuke, and the pair bond almost instantly. This close connection proves to be a key element in the plot as when Ponyo gets separated from her mortal boy, she does all she can to get back to him, causing imbalance in the two worlds in the process. The rest of the story focuses on what happens to the pair and how everything is resolved.

I loved the colors and the fantastic imagery and animation. There is an abundance of vivid imagery and my young daughter was captivated by what was happening on screen. Ponyo as a character has a lot going for her - she is adorable and young children can easily relate to her precocious nature. The plot does get a tad confusing in parts if only because there is so much going on in the story, but in general, the story flows well. I still prefer ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" (note: this does center on a young ""witch"") over ""Ponyo"", but if you're looking for engaging children's animated features (ages 5 and up), you can't go wrong with these three. They are also the best bet for younger children in Miyazaki's range of animated features as some of the others can be rather dark for younger viewers.",1279065600,2,2470,5.531746031746032

Friendship, caring, sharing and so many other good qualities are emphasized in the movie.  There is even a large focus on a senior center and the relationship between a small boy and the elders, all done with such emphasis on good manners and love.  Granted a fish does not turn into a little girl but that bit of magic is overpowered by the fabulous mothering skills of Souski's mother who just tucks that little girl into her love and caring of her son and grows her family.

If you want a good film which teaches great values with so much ease, then this is a film you need to show your preschoolers.

As A Miyazaki fan this was movie was very disappointing to me. Normally there is a very strong story driving his amazing art that make it all fit together in a way that grasps you and pulls you in, with Ponyo this is not the case. The entire time I watched this film I found myself wondering if this was really a Miyazaki film. It looked like one and thanks again to the master Joe Hisashi but id didn't feel like one of his films. None of the characters were particularly likable or dislikable for that matter they were just simply there. The attempts at cuteness wroked for about the first 20 minutes after that it just took time away from what could have been used for a better story or more characters development. The only reason this is a two star review as opposed to one is because of the great soundtrack and amazing visuals. All in all the movie while nice to look at for a short period of time ended up being just plain boring with a weak story and even weaker characters and character development. If you must see this movie please rent it first, if you like it more power to you.

But Spirited Away was made for a younger audience, and I thought it was fantastic it is one of my all time favorites. And I don't know if it is because he is getting older, but the animation didn't look as sharp as say Howl's Moving Castle, or Kiki's Delivery Service which are all fantastic films by the way.

1127883,4,7799127775,"From Hiyao Miyazaki(who if you didn't know created the Oscar-winning Spirited Away)is this his latest movie which is an original story, although slightly inspired by The Little Mermaid and some elements of The Frog Prince. This is his eighth film that he's done through Studio Ghibli, which he co-founded, and was fortunate to be released in U.S. theatres through Disney.

A 5-year old boy named Sosuke lives right on the ocean with his parents. His father is a fisherman who usually isn't at home, and his mother Lisa works at a senior citizens center. One day, Sosuke catches a strange looking goldfish he calls Ponyo which licks a cut on his finger and heals him. The fish gets away, but is really the daughter of a strange Willy Wonka-dressed man who is some kind of keeper of peace in the seas. Ponyo uses her magic to transform into a human girl, although sometimes she looses her composure which causes her to change into a slightly frog-like creature. She runs into Sosuke who immeadiately recognizes her as the fish he caught, and is taken in temporarily by Lisa during a huge typhoon which floods the entrie area. Lisa leaves to go look in on the old ladies at the center, leaving Sosuke and Ponyo to set out the next morning in a toy boat that Ponyo makes bigger with her magical powers. They then encounter Ponyo's father who takes them to his underwater refuge, where Lisa and all the old ladies from the center have been kept to save them from the flood. There, they encounter Ponyo's mother who is essentiually a cross between a goddess and Glinda the good witch, and lets them know that Ponyo can stay with Sosuke and his mother. The movie ends with the balance of nature being turned back to normal, because somehow Ponyo accidently caused it to happen with her magic.

I'd have to say I very much enjoyed this movie. It's Miyazaki's first movie intended for children since My Neighbor Totoro, and it comes off as such. There isn't any dark overtone like some of his last films like Howl's Moving Castle or Princess Mononoke, and is done purely for sheer fun. Granted, the plot didn't seem to have too much of a main direction to it, but Miyazaki makes up for it with his stellar visuals. The dub is pretty fair with the usually roster of celebrities that Disney gets for its movies, including Tina Fey as Lisa, Matt Damon as Sosuke's father, and Cate Blanchett as Ponyo's mother. I'd say Liam Neeson was miscast as Ponyo's dad, and it could have done without the Jonas Bros. and Cyus siblings being cast as the main characters, but was still acceptable. I'd recommend this film as a mainstay for someone's family, although traditional anime fans might find it a little hokey.

Loosly based on the classic film 'The Little Mermaid', Ponyo is a gold fish that knows there is more to a simple life than just staying under water in the care of her sorcerer father (who strangley enough it not fish like at all). With a little intuition she escapes to the surface and takes on a human form. The she finds a little boy names Sosuke, a boy who's favorite thing in the world is to help people. When he comes upon Ponyo he wants to care for her too and they form a very special bond. Now the two of them need to fight and let her father understand that the world of the sea and the world of the surface can live together in peace so long as both worlds understand just how important they are to one another.

This film is such an enjoyable on, because of the fact that it has gone back to the magical roots that make Ghibli films so amazing. The scenes where the water looks like faces crashing onto the last is so creative and all the bright colors and the innocence of the characters make the film more enjoyable. 'Ponyo' is the very first Ghibli film to be shown on a wide release of U.S. movie theaters. It is about time too. While there haven't been such great films since 'Spirited Away', 'Ponyo' is a sign that hopefully as the studio reaches it's 30th annuversey there will be some new films that are just as magical as the greats that came before it.",1274486400,,1650,4.218354430379747

However I found Ponyo to be a very light innocent film that is not seen today. While watching, I was genuinely happy and smiling for the majority of the film.

Artistically, like Hayao's other films, it is bar none the most beautiful drawn world in today's animation. Think of Ponyo as if The Little Mermaid met My Neighbor Totoro, with the originality of Spirited Away, and that should give you an idea of what to expect.

Voice acting is very good, with Liam Neeson outperforming everybody else as Fujimoto, the father of Ponyo. Tina Fey also does a surprisingly stellar job as Lisa, the mother of Sosuke.

The Soundtrack is yet again perfectly fitting and portrays the scenes well, Joe Hisaishi did another tremendous job.

So if you haven't already, pick up Ponyo and prepare to let your mind wonder and enjoy the last film made by the great Hayao Miyazaki!",1274227200,2,1047,4.643243243243243

1128215,5,7799127775,"As soon as my daughter saw Ponyo, she fell in love with it. She loves My Neighbor Totoro, The Cat Returns, Spirited Away and Kiki's Delivery Service, so this was pretty much a safe bet with her. Getting the movie's already a good deal, but the plush Ponyo included here is of great quality, and easily beats any other Studio Ghibli plush I've seen [at least here in the US].

You can see right there in the stock picture how big Ponyo is since it's right next to the dvd in the packaging. It's made of a very soft, huggable material sure to comfort any child, and it's super cute. The material is easy to clean if anything gets dirty, and the construction is very sturdy. Of course there will be some issues with a longer 'skirt' here and there (that's quality control for you), but can you really turn away such a cute character even if it's suffering from such a thing? The plush Ponyo alone runs for about the cost of this set on most sites, so getting it included with the movie is great. While I would've liked them to give the blu-ray the same treatment, it's good to have on dvd since it's beautiful to watch on either format. And hey, most parents don't let 3 year olds handle 'expensive' movies, eh?

The dvd includes the usual special features that other Studio Ghibli dvds have- an interview with Miyazaki, a short featurette and a storyboard presentation of the entire movie. This is always a very important special feature for those interested in animation, or like to see the movie in a different format and seeing how it came together before the animators stepped in. And of course, the movie's in Japanese and English with Japanese, English, Spanish and French subtitles.

If you or your child(ren) love Ponyo, this is a must. I wish Disney would've given the recent re-re-releases of Kiki's Delivery Service and My Neighbor Totoro the same kind of gift set. Now I'm kinda jealous that my daughter has her own Ponyo. Maybe I need to order one more?",1273104000,8,1964,4.526760563380281
1128216,5,7799127775,"I haven't seen all Miyazaki's films (I'm in the process of doing it) but the four I've seen until now are masterpieces. Hayao Miyazaki may be the greatest animator in the world, his films combines beautiful, detailed hand-drawn backgrounds and stories that engage you with excellent stories and great characters. The films that I've seen so far are My Neighbor Totoro, Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away and Ponyo (all excellent).

I've read some reviews that this is a light effort from Miyazaki. I disagree. I think that the master animator divides into two categories: the all innocent, sweet and simple films (My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service and Ponyo) and the much more complex, ambigous ones (Nausicaa, Castle in the Sky, Porco Rosso, Mononoke, Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle). Both categories are excellent in their own right and serve to satisfy people of all ages.

Ponyo is an excellent film. Here in Ecuador unfortunately Disney understandably does not release Studio Ghibli films in theaters. While that's a shame, I understand that this films are not all quite embraced by the public in the West (although their following is increasing), so I have to buy it through Amazon. I was impressed by the beautifullness of the film. From the beginning it takes your breath away by showing you stunning scenes of the sea and the land. The story is really simple but I think that is one of the many strengths of the film. The characters are great and the two children behave properly as five year old should. Miyazaki takes inspiration in The Little Mermaid but give the film his own identity which we all have learn to love.

Ponyo is a sweet, simple, beautiful film that will lift your spirits and will make you smile thoughout it and after it. 5 stars. Totally recommended.",1272844800,2,1797,4.885245901639344

I recommend this film to anyone with or WITHOUT a child, along with any of Studio Ghibli's previous works. These movies are amazing for all ages and all types of people, though I CAUTION: WATCH IT IN JAPANESE WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES. The Disney dubbing job is absolutely awful with a cast that doesn't fit the characters at all, but were instead selected for 'political' reasons.

1128223,5,7799127775,"Hayao Miyazaki is one of those rare directors who can take the magic of nature and childhood, then somehow capture it for the screen.

And his tenth Ghibli movie ""Ponyo"" is no exception -- it's a reimagined tale of a ""little mermaid"" who wants to become human so she can be with a little human boy she loves. It's a simple story told in a simple manner (occasionally TOO simple), but it has a lush oceanic beauty and an innocent sweetness that really capture your heart and imagination.

A little boy named Sosuke finds a tiny ""goldfish"" with a human face on a beach, trapped in a bottle. He names her Ponyo, and goes to great lengths to care for his little fishy friend.

But then the sea wizard Fujimoto, Ponyo's overprotective dad, appears and snatches Ponyo back into the sea -- and she decides that she wants to become human so she can be with Sosuke. Having tasted a bit of Sosuke's blood, she sprouts chickenleggy limbs and starts to change, but inadvertently disrupts a magical well that causes the moon to drop, the seas to rise over the land, and prehistoric magic to rise once more.

Sosuke and Ponyo are delighted to be reunited, despite the raging storm that is engulfing the city and causing ships to go missing. While the children go searching for Sosuke's missing mother, Fujimoto struggles to fix the balance of nature before the entire world is destroyed, with the help of Ponyo's sea goddess mother. The only hope of restoring balance lies in Ponyo and Sosuke -- and if Sosuke's love is not true, then Ponyo will be reduced to sea foam.

Compared to Miyazaki's other movies, ""Ponyo"" is a very simple story -- it's basically a boy-meets-fishgirl story, with lots of children running around being adorable and exquisite looks at the sea. Even its theme is simple -- the story is dependent on on true selfless love and how it knows no boundaries of age, experience or even species. Not to mention parents letting go of their children.

If there's a downside to the story, it's the lack of internal conflict. Example: the ""test"" that Fujimoto and the sea goddess use for Sosuke... well, it's far less impressive than it seems.

And Miyazaki does not disappoint animationwise -- he conjures a waterworld of luminous sea life, sparkling ships, prehistoric creatures, finned submarines and a town that has been swallowed by the sea (complete with boats floating over the rooftops). It's an exquisite piece of work that turns the ocean into a magical, otherworldly realm where wizards work in coral-encrusted towers and shimmering jellyfish take little mermaids to the surface.

Ponyo herself provides a lot of the movie's charm -- she's effusive, hyperactive, has a babylike fascination with the human world (""HAM!""), and an array of handy magical powers. Sosuke is a likable lad who is fascinated by Ponyo and her world, and Fujimoto makes a enjoyable anti-hero -- spindly, gaunt and with a mane of messy red hair, he's like a rock'n'roll embodiment of parental stress.

As for this particular edition, it comes with a plushie ""fish"" Ponyo -- very cute and fuzzy, and an appropriate addition to the DVD. After all, if it's more childlike, why not include a toy?

""Ponyo"" is simpler and more childlike fare than most of Miyazaki's past films, but it's still a sweet and lushly-animated piece of work. At the very least, it will transport you to a magical childhood.",1272153600,,3377,4.767123287671233

1128535,4,7799127775,"This is a beautiful movie, but I don't think it's one of Miyazaki's best.  I think it's great that Miyazaki sometimes makes movies for younger kids (Totoro and Kiki's Delivery Service) and some movies that are for adult fans (Princess Mononoke).  This movie is definitely written for the younger audience.  I'm giving this probably a higher rating that I would have just because I think it's well made, great animation, great music, pretty good voice acting.  But I really don't like the story line.  For one it just doesn't hold together very well, at first I think it's a story about a boy who's father is not a home very often and he's dealing with an over-worked and over-stressed mom and finds a magical friend in the form of a fish.  Then it starts to morph into a little-mermaid type of story where the little fish-girl's father is a crazy lunatic of a ""former human"" and has a sea goddess as a mother.  And it ends rather abruptly with the two declaring undying love (or else the little girl will die)... don't forget that the two lovers are only 5 years old or so.  I know some Asian cultures still accept arranged marriages between children (they wait until they are older to get married, it's just decided when they're little) but still, I thought that was kind of a rare deal these days.  Ok, aside from the creepiness of kids declaring undying love, there's just too many stories going on here and it gets a bit confusing, a bit overwhelming and seems disjointed.

1128541,5,7799127775,"I'm a long time fan of Miyazaki's work, and saw Ponyo in the cinema, so have been waiting for this DVD for some time.

This is the story of a small fish who escapes from the submarine of her father (a sea-wizard) and happens to taste a drop of blood from a young boy and becomes human-like for a while. The boy, Sosuke, names her Ponyo, and the main story is all about the friendship and love that develops between the two of them (and Ponyo's fondness of all things human, like ham sandwiches, of all things). But their relationship also disrupts the natural balance between sea and land, and disasters in the form of floods and a typhoon loom to threaten everyone, not just the innocent friends. So the story is not just about a developing friendship, but the responsibilities that come along with that, to the people in the fishing village, to the elderly people in the retirement home (where Sosuke's mother works), to the creatures in the ocean, and beyond that to the planet itself. All, of course, is resolved in the end.

Beyond the story, however, Ponyo has some of the most amazing animation scenes, especially of the raging waves that lash the shore in a typhoon, coming alive into wild creatures of fury. I thought this might not translate so well to a smaller screen, but I was not disappointed. The disc is really a beautiful rendering. You can turn down the sound and still have a fine time simply viewing the animation, one beautiful image after the other.

Some who've seen Miyazaki movies before may get a sense of deja vu - Ponyo seems a lot like Mai from Totoro,
the Sea Wizard seems a lot like Miyazaki's other long-nosed European-ish characters in Howl's Moving Castle, and there are many other similarities too numerous to mention. But what do you expect - it's the same artists doing the drawing (and yes, this is hand drawn animation at its best), so you'd expect some stylistic similarities. But there is enough new here to surprise and delight, and if you've never seen a Miyazaki movie before, then it will all be new.

The one thing I dislike is the silly English translation of the theme song at the end, so I greatly appreciate that the disc retains the original Japanese soundtrack, where the original is much more appropriate.  The extras on the 2nd disc are nice for Miyazaki fans, but it's the movie itself that is the real value here.",1270944000,,2370,4.580188679245283

However, Ponyo does not stand up to them in terms of story to me.  While I find the story to be only alright, the quality of the animation is wonderful.  Disney did a great job on the transfer.  I definitely recommend watching the Japanese audio version as I can't stand Noah Cyrus's voice as Ponyo.  Liam Neeson's voice also doesn't quite fit, but everyone else is cast well just like most of the dubs of Miyazaki's films in past years.  I highly recommend this film and blu-ray for parents with kids.

Some people have complained about the art style he used in this film, that it's not detailed and slap-dash. These people are stupid. The art is obviously done with meticulous effort to emulate the style of classic art that would have been popular in the time that the original source material, ""The Little Mermaid"" by Hans Christian Andersen, was written. While the story is updated, the art is classic, beautiful and painterly.

My favorite thing is how Disney packages their Blu-rays with the DVD of the movie (and just the movie, of course). This is enormously convenient, since I have PS3 at home, but don't have a BD drive in my laptop, desktops, or any other portable player.

The details and humor make it an interesting movie for adults to watch, but five year olds go bananas over it. Truly. One of my grandson's friends insisted on being called Ponyo for quite a while! The story is akin to Hans Christian Anderson's Little Mermaid, but Miyazaki adds his own touch, pulling in many generations--the women in the elder care facility, two-career parents, and, of course, children. If you have been to Japan, you will recognize the little touches of modern Japanese life, as well as the Japanese appreciation of imagination and nostalgia--even ecological lessons abound. It is traditional Japanese artistry beautifully brought to a twenty-first century level.

I found the American voices a bit too recognizable for my comfort and thus a bit distracting. Since I enjoy learning about Japanese culture and language, I liked the film even better when I switched rhe settings to Japanese with English subtitles. (Sorry, Disney marketing).

Yes, it's for a younger age group, but kids are pretty sharp and I felt that the movie was dumbed down unnecessarily. The visuals are fantastic, but the story plods along, and after a while I was just waiting for it to be over. I never felt any connection to the characters and just plain didn't care what happened to them, which to me means the movie missed its mark. Also, some things happened that seemed totally nonsensical--for example, the mother drives with her son through flooding streets and a dangerous storm rather than follow the official's advice to evacuate. Why put your son in danger like that? Other things happened and I felt that there was no explanation given for them, leaving the story feeling choppy. I wouldn't bother to watch this movie; I felt that it skated on the reputation of an admired artist and didn't deserve the credit it received.",1270512000,10,940,4.634730538922156

Wow, that sounds a bit priggish, but I'm having a hard time verbalizing that I did NOT like this movie, and think it wasn't on target for little ones.

I did NOT like how the child was the go-between in the grousing between the parents.  I did NOT like when the Sensei let the child leave alone in clearly bad circumstances.  I did NOT like when the parent left the kids alone, driving across flooded roads, etc.  The pacing was odd, and seemed to lurch a bit.  I guess I wish they had suspended reality entirely, than this odd amalgam of normality mixed with high art.  Talking teapots worked better somehow.

The english versions of Whisper of the Heart, Kiki, Totoro, and all the rest are superb - real works of art in themselves. Magnificent!

But the english production of PONYO is trash!  What a catastrophe!

What went wrong here ?!

Let's set aside the fact that the kid actors are approximately 250 years too old for the parts they are playing.

I think the primary problem is that the screenwriters in english went wrong:

The script in English actually tries to explain - believe it - fairy tale mechanisms.

So, imagine you're watching Snow White...

She takes a bite of the apple, and one of the characters says ""Ah hah, Because of the GENETIC POISON and the dwarf's TIME CONTROL DEVICE, that's why she will GO TO SLEEP...""  Ridiculous!

Of course, newsflash, FAIRY TALES DON'T MAKE SENSE. ""Crazy"" things happen in fairy tales, just like in dreams. Pigs build houses of straw, cows jump over the moon, kisses change frogs .. it's a fairy tale.

I feel that this explains the fundamental problem with the english version of Ponyo.  The screenwriters in english rather bizarrely try to ""explain"" a (totally phantasmagorical) fairy tale.

The movie is PRETTY HORRIBLE in english.

It's reminds me of ... those very awkward ""orchestral versions"" of Beatles songs - just doesn't work.

The french version works great, as does the japanese version.

Also, perhaps because the movie is operatic, a stunning interplay of sound-visuals, it just doesnt work unless the voices ""fit"" really well.

It's a catastrophe!  We've been watching the french and japanese versions for months (they were released earlier) and the english version is very sad!

Most of the people who watch this film will be two years old - consider just flipping it to the french or japanese track when playing the movie for your two year old! The pacing, feel, everything is then flawless.

As for the movie itself - everything that can be said has already been said.  Miyasaki is a visual and conceptual genius on the level of Michelangelo or Homer.  The film is one of the most important works of visual art - ever.  It is ""the end"" of animation, nothing can surpass it - as everyone now knows the film was produced completely manually, on paper and celluloid - just like a movie in the 1960s, no computers at all. It's difficult to believe you are looking at 180,000 individual stunning drawings, each one a masterwork in itself.  The ""feel"" of ""water"" in the movie has never been found in any other art or depiction of water. The ""epic"" scenes of Ponyo on the waves and so on are now instantly formed in to human civilisation like the statue of David or the cave paintings in Lascaux.  Blah, blah, blah, it's an unlimited masterpiece - there is no doubt!

But, what the heck went wrong with the english screenwriting!  Bummer!

My prediction: within 20 years, someone will produce a different english-language version of Ponyo (phew!)

Regarding the Blu-Ray, the production technically is simply as good as it can get, the work of the world's greatest technical geniuses obviously.  The miracle of BluRay.

A note for the many overseas buyers who are having the english-language version shipped to them.  Don't bother, it's trash, just get the french or japanese version - just joking!  Technical tip - if you have trouble or if it is slow launching the disk in English, launch it in French and simply then change to english-soundtrack.  With the endless combinations of firmware versions, etc etc, this may be necessary and fixes your problem.

The ""new generation"" (6th gen?) of blu-ray players just released, eg the LG 350 model (which is all of 100 bucks) plays the disk stunningly and loads fast...as my children say ""it's not a dream, it's bluray...""",1269734400,,3825,4.811349693251533

1128867,3,7799127775,"I liked the visuals, It was like watching an impressionist painting at times. However, the plot was very screwed up. The Dad served only to eat up screen time and add confusion. The ending was pretty abrupt and anticlimactic. They spend the whole movie building suspense about ponyos mother, and setting her father up as the villan, only to have it nd with the dad basically ""yes dear""ing as a form of plot resolution. I think one of the problems(and a constant problem with alot of the directors movies) is that they were trying to shoehorn to much plot into to small a length of time. IMO this would have been alot better as a short run tv series, they would have had more time to properly explore the kids relationship, both fathers relationships to their kids, etc.",1269561600,3,769,4.579710144927536
1128868,5,7799127775,"Beautiful animation from Miyazaki again.

1128869,4,7799127775,"Ponyo is one of those films that needs to be viewed multiple times to get the full effect (just like many of Miyazaki's works).  When I first saw this in theaters my initial reaction was ""well, that was okay"", but now that I have the dvd and I've had the chance to watch it a few more times (and notice some of the more subtle details), I must say that it's growing on me.

The plot basically involves a ""goldfish"" who leaves her home under the sea and is found by a five-year-old human boy named Souske.  He names her Ponyo, and they develop a friendship.  However, her father, Fujimoto, is a powerful wizard who attempts to get her back.  She later uses her magic to become a human girl, but her powers throw nature out of balance, causing a large storm.  Eventually, her father and her mother (a sea goddess) devise a test for Souske.  He passes and Ponyo is allowed to stay with him as a human.  And that is basically the plot in a nutshell.

Like many other Miyazaki films, Ponyo is character-driven rather than plot-driven.  The plot itself is pretty simple, and the ending seems too easy compared to other hardships faced by characters in other Miyazaki films, but there is deep and rich characterization present.  I especially found the relationship of Souske's mother and father to be interesting, as well as the characterization of the grumpy old woman, Toki.  I find it interesting that she's the most cynical, and is also the only one to notice or care about the strange qualities of Ponyo.  Fujimoto is the closest thing to an antagonist that this film has, but like all of Miyazaki's antagonists, he is not one-dimensional.  Yes, he is a bitter, human-hating individual who is too controlling, but at the same time, he has some good qualities to him--he genuinely seems to love his daughter and care about her.  He even says at the end of the movie, as a sort of apology, ""try to remember me kindly, if you will"".
At first I though this film was rather heavy-handed in it's environmentalist message, but then I realized that the only character in this movie who pushes the message is Fujimoto, and he is clearly bitter.  The sea goddess (the one who should rightly be most angry) doesn't seem that bitter or angry at all.  In fact, she seems to always keep a sense of good humor about her.  This is especially evident when Fujimoto is getting all stressed out on the boat and she just tells him to stop worrying so much.  In an act of good faith, she even restores some vitality to the seniors at the end of the movie.  In the end, everyone ends up happy and in good spirits.  Overall, I like how many characters are left morally ambiguous.  This is a hallmark of many Miyazaki films, and I love it because it really makes you think.

I also like how Mizaki plays with some of our sensibilities by turning them upside down.  For example, he kind of plays with the mind of the viewer by swapping the parent-child dynamic between Souske and his mother, Lisa.  He often seems to be the responsible mature one and she often comes across as immature (but still fun and loving).  This is especially evident in how she drives like a maniac, leaves him alone during a storm, and in how she throws a tantrum when her husband has to work overtime and can't come home for dinner.  Souske's maturity is especially apparent during this latter scene when he has to tell his mother, ""I know dad doesn't always keep his promises, but he loves us and does his best for us"".  I also like how fantasy and reality are deftly blended together; as evidenced by how many of the adults seem not to notice or care about the fantastical elements (ex.-Toki sees Ponyo's ""human face"" and the other seniors aren't alarmed by it, Souske's mom rather quickly accepts the idea that the human Ponyo used to be a fish, etc.).  None of this is ever explained, and it's all meant to be taken in and accepted in a surreal sort of way.  Aside from all the interesting themes, characters, and whatnot, this is a genuinely funny and cute film.  There are many funny moments interspersed to keep things light-hearted.

Lastly, this film is graphically and musically beautiful.  As everyone is aware by now, Ponyo is entirely hand-drawn, and while this may be a dying art, at least Ponyo is proof that it's going out with a bang!  I especially love the imagery of the ""living"" shapeshifting waves.  The music is also quite lovely; the opera singing during the introduction is rather beautiful, and Ponyo's theme song during the credits is funny and cute.  Disney has added a remixed version of the theme song in the later credits that I don't really care for, but you don't really have to listen to it anyway since it's in the end credits, so I guess it doesn't really matter.

The last thing to discuss is the technical specifications of the release.  First off , I bought the blu-ray/dvd combo pack.  The thing you should know about this is that the special features are all located on the blu-ray, so if you only have a dvd player then you might want to get the 2-disc dvd set instead.  The combo pack, however, would make a good set for someone who's transitioning from dvd to blu-ray.  As for the special features themselves, they are pretty good.  Of note are some interviews with Miyazaki about his inspiration behind Ponyo, a section detailing the locations that inspired the setting of Ponyo, interviews with the voice cast, and a segment on composing music for this and other Miyazaki films.  In the past, Miyazaki films often had very little in the way of special features, so the Ponyo release is definitely worth getting if you enjoyed the movie.  So, there's my two cents.  If you haven't yet seen the movie, rent it first and see if you like it.  Enjoy!",1269388800,3,5740,4.53988326848249
1128870,5,7799127775,I always seem to worry needlessly when Disney is releasing a Ghibli movie in the US.  They always do a great job and Ponyo is no exception.  I haven't checked out the dub yet but if it is anything like past releases it should be good.,1269388800,,234,4.065217391304348

They like to keep those things separate so they can generate more income.  But this gift set is perfect for Ponyo!  After watching the film, how can you not pine for one of these Ponyo Plushies?!

You may want to be careful, however.  The construction of the plushie may differ in quality.  For example, mine has a shorter ""skirt"" than the one I saw at the store about a week after I recieved mine.  But that's a personal pet peeve and shouldn't bother anyone that isn't very nit-picky about their stuffed toys.

Now if only Disney did this with Totoro...",1269388800,4,669,4.426229508196721
1128872,5,7799127775,"This movie, though not the best of Miyazaki's, is very interesting.  It reminds you of being in a dream.  The mother of the boy, Sosuki, is very courageous.  Sosuki is a very positive, honest child.  They both meet their challenges with enthusiasm.
The story is NOT predictable between the beginning, where Sosuki finds the fish, and the end, where Ponyo and Sosuki accomplish their goal, and is full of some very fantastical surprises.  There is only a trace of ""The Little Mermaid"" theme to it.
For most of the movie you really don't know whether Ponyo's father is the villain or not.  The many other characters in the movie round out this dream quite well, especially the old ladies.  Sosuke's father has some charm, too, and Ponyo's mother tops it off amazingly.

Ponyo on the otherhand is a more stunningly realized and tighter movie with innocence to spare.  My partner and I just watched in amazement at the colors, the music, the themes, the hidden little messages, nuances... Sigh... :)  It's childhood and adulthood realized in one wonderful work of art.

It is visually stimulating, the story is sweet, imaginative and it has a happy ending.

""Ponyo,"" a.k.a. ""Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea,"" is perhaps the most innocent and wondrous of Miyazaki's films. It's said to be loosely based on ""The Little Mermaid"" (even the DVD package suggest this) but it really only bears a passing resemblance to either the Andersen or Disney versions. Like other Miyazaki films, it tells its own story by its own rules and requires that you allow yourself ""into"" an almost alternate universe that coexists with a realistic world. Sorry to be so pithy, but it's hard to describe these films adequately. They need to be experienced.

Big name stars perform the dubbed English version and most of them agreed because of their love for the director's previous work.

Among these is Liam Neeson, who appears on camera on one of the bonus features on the two disc set. Tina Fey says she was channeling the movie moms she grew up with. We see the cherished Betty White in recording sessions (she plays one of three ladies in a nursing facility, the other two voiced by Lily Tomlin and Cloris Leachman). Especially remarkable are the performances of young Noah Cyrus (Miley's sister) and Frankie Jonas (the Jonas Brothers' little brother) as the two leads. It's difficult enough to match the voices in an overdubbed foreign language film, it's quite another to add emotion and depth.

My children loved this film. It was their first introduction to Miyazaki, which can be an acquired taste for some. If you enjoy and admire the work of Pixar, you can't deny the extreme (and eagerly credited) influence of Miyazaki on Pixar character development and storytelling in particular.

The two DVD discs also include a storyboarded version of the film and lots of short features about the music, voices, characters and setting of ""Ponyo.""

My only question -- where was the U.S released soundtrack album, including the Cyrus/Jonas version of the song?",1268352000,,2138,4.87603305785124
1129176,5,7799127775,"The latest Studio Ghibli masterpiece (would they even be capable of producing a bad movie?) is based on Hans Christian Anderson's ""The Little Mermaid"" but reworked into a new, distinctive take.  Under the sea is a once-human wizard, now a magical being, loyal to nature and indignant over man's treatment of the Earth.  He has hundreds of children, strange little fishes with faces, whose mother at first remains unseen (I'm trying not to spoil the surprises of later in the movie).  When one of these fish - an especially adventuresome little girl fish - is washed up on land and rescued by a little boy named Sosuke (who keeps her in a bucket of water and names her Ponyo), the two become inseperable.  Then little Ponyo becomes infused with human blood - after she licks a small cut on Sosuke's finger to heal it, and is changed.  She can become human, and yearns to stay on land with her beloved little friend, Sosuke.

  The little pair finds themselves at the center of a global crisis when the world, already out of balance, becomes much more so when the wizard's Water Of Life is accidentally unleashed upon the ocean.  To say too much more about the plot would be to rob the viewer of discovering how this wonder-filled story unfolds on their own.  It has hugely memorable characters, focuses deeply on the bonds between people - between Sosuke and Ponyo; between Ponyo and her parents and her numerous sibling fish; between Sosuke and his mother; between Sosuke, his mother, and the father who has to be away at sea for long periods of time; between Sosuke, his mother, and the old ladies at the senior center she works at; and so on.  It's full of whimsey, comedy, awe, and a pure, magically innocent little love story.  The animation and the use of color is fantastic, and the worlds and events represented in that animation are amazing - the undersea home of the wizard; walls of water being pulled skyward toward the moon; massive ocean waves transforming into huge, titanic-sized fish and back again.  The beautiful animation is complimented well by great voice acting.

1129177,2,7799127775,"Earlier today I ordered this Blu-ray. I made the mistake of not checking if the Japanese track was in a lossless format. There was no information about this on this site. The scanned picture of the back cover isn't very good so it isn't easy to ascertain if the Japanese track was lossy of lossless. I went to [...] and noticed there that the Japanese track is, in fact, only the lossy Dolby Digital. Since amazon is now shipping my item I cannot cancel the order, but I want to warn other people about this. I am sure that the picture quality is great and being a great Miyazaki fan I am sure that the movie is equally great.
Being a great Miyazaki fan I always listen to the original language track, NEVER the dubbed track. I did try and listen to the dubbed track of Kiki's Delivery Service at one time and it was horrid. Changing the music to fit the English language is truly dreadful. I have also discovered on other dubs of Japanese anime that quite often important plot points are distorted or directly incorrect. I have all the other Miyazaki films on DVD and I never listen to the dubbed track. Listening to the Japanese track has it's charms since everything about the movie and the way everything and everyone work to make movie great make sense when listening to the original track. That goes for everything, not just Miyazaki's movies or anime in general.

So if you are a Japanese anime fan and are used to listening to the original track be aware that the Japanese track is in Dolby Digital and not DTS-HD Master Audio. Only the English dub is in DTS-HD Master Audio. I must also say that I am extremely disappointed that Disney made this gigantic mistake when making the Blu-ray. I can only hope that won't do the same mistake when issuing the other Miyazaki movies on Blu-ray. Learn from Pioneer when they issued a truly magnificent release of Akira!",1268352000,10,1868,4.510324483775811

Granted, it's not Miyazaki's greatest movie or my favorite (Kiki's Delivery Service), but still well worth seeing. The transfer is great on the standard version (I watch on a Sony Bravia with HDMI connection). Don't think of it as a Little Mermaid ripoff, because it's not. A wonderful story of acceptance that kids will love, and even those over 50 (like myself)",1268179200,,444,4.855263157894737
1129179,2,7799127775,"I thought long and hard before giving the film this score, but there are simply too many things that make Ponyo not work for me. This latest animated movie from Myazaki, who needs no introductions, had the intriguing premise of the sea. He spoke of the sea being a character in itself. I was intrigued to see the movie. I knew it had two children as the frontline, but being a fan of My Neighbour Totoro, I knew that Myazaki has an unreal insight into the mindset of children.

The very first scene of Ponyo is breathtaking. Hundreds of fishes and jellyfish accompanied by breathtaking, oceanic music, finally zooming in on a man in a pinstriped suit, creating a bubble around his ship. We later find out that he is the father of one of the main characters, the fish girl Ponyo who wants to become human after befriending Sotsuke, a 5-year old boy living in a house by the sea. She is able to do this with a mixture of her father's magic (which she's inherited) and Sotsuke's blood (a drop of which she licked when he cut himself).

The problem with Ponyo is the vagueness of the story. There is practically no sense of conflict to the story at all. There is no substantial threat to the characters, and they have very little development. That the characters are so young shouldn't justify this, if we remember Mei in My Neighbour Totoro. Also, Ponyo's father is so at odds with practically everything in the movie's universe, it's hilarious and off-putting at the same time. Ponyo herself is, personally, creepy rather than cute (and her numerous little siblings are no different). I don't understand how nobody finds it peculiar that Ponyo, supposedly a goldfish, has a humanoid face (and Sotsuke shows her to quite a few people). It's even weirder when Lisa (Sotsuke's mother, whom he oddly always refers to by name), an intelligent woman, sees Ponyo eat a slice of ham in whole (as a goldfish) and isn't at all surprised about it. The only really developed character, and the warmest, is the grumpy old woman at the retirement home where Lisa works.

What Ponyo lacks in substance, it makes up for in visuals. The movie's highlight in my opinion is where Lisa and Sotsuke are driving down a road continually drenched in waves, on top of which Ponyo is running. These waves take on the form of giant fish.  A wonderful piece of animation. The many underwater scenes are beautiful, with underwater creatures big and small swimming. Something about the overall production values of the visuals feel a bit unfocused, though. The morse code scene is then hilarious.

On the whole, however, Ponyo feels like a lot of elements that just don't work together. Sotsuke faces no real trials like other young Myazaki protagonists have faced. None of the characters feel like they serve any real purpose other than to bring Sotsuke and Ponyo together. The film's subplot of Ponyo's magic causing a rift in the natural order and causing the moon to come closer (which explains the flood) is never sufficiently delivered to the audience.

I was simply expecting a better delivery from a master storyteller like Myazaki. Ponyo may only really work for the smallest children, but that's excluding a large part of Myazaki's fanbase. He's one of those filmmakers whom I respect for continually showing people that animated movies can be for people of all ages. Ponyo obviously aims at a lower age group, but I just hope that the children will be more drawn into Sotsuke and Ponyo's story than I was (there is so much courteous and/or cute dialogue that I felt downright embarrassed at points).

Decent, but definitely not the brightest spot in Myazaki's repertoire.",1268179200,42,3650,4.756714060031595

This film is very pleasant but not groundbreaking. The transfer is good.
What enrages me though and loses this item 1 star is the decision by the wretched Disney (the anti-Ghibli in my opinion - oh the irony of it being them who have control of Ghibli's work in the west) to include an HD audio soundtrack for the (American) English dub but only a Dolby Digital 5.1 track for the (much preferred) Japanese original audio!
WHY?! This defies all logic and is an insult to those people who truly understand how a Ghibli movie should be presented. Disney are the McDonalds of the audio/visual world and treat their customers like nothing more than an income stream. Another case in point is the incredible number of unskippable trailers on Disney disc releases. How insulting to force me to watch the same trailers EVERY time I watch the movie I've paid for.

1129181,4,7799127775,"When I first heard of Disney dubbing Studio Ghibli's films for the U.S. market, I have to admit I approached them with trepidation.  I needn't have worried, they did a beautiful job with ""Princess Mononoke"", ""Kiki's Delivery Service"", ""Spirited Away"" and the rest.  So when I picked up ""Ponyo"", I had heightened expectations.

As usual, the voice acting was first rate.  Clearly everyone involved with the project cared about the product that would eventually find its way to the shelves of video stores across the nation.  Ponyo itself is a beautiful film for the family.  I saw it in Japan.  You could call it Hayao Miyazaki's twist on Hans Christina Andersen's ""The Little Mermaid"", but that would be a disservice to the innate storytelling ability of Hayao Miyazaki.  There's far more here than a western tale told in Japanese style.  This is a story told with heart, al all to rare thing nowadays.

BUT

There was one thing I objected to, enough to take a star away from what would otherwise have been a perfect review.  The film ended with a despicable re-mix of the ""Ponyo"" theme, featuring (gag) AUTO-TUNE.  Oh, the pain... the pain...

So, I loved the film.  But the soundtrack will not be on my shelf.  Auto-tune is an abomination, and needs to return to the pits of hell from whence it ascended.",1268092800,,1306,4.712389380530974
1129182,5,7799127775,"What a precious film ""Ponyo"" is! The colors and its beautiful story really captivate you. Helmed by Academy Award-winning director Hayao Miyazaki, at the Japanese animation film Studio Ghibli, this astonishing movie follows the tradition established by Miyazaki and Ghibli, with wonderful animated films like ""My Neighbor Totoro,"" ""Kiki's Delivery Service,"" and ""Castle in the Sky.""

One of the main characters in the story is Sosuke, a happy kid who spends his day going to school and returning home with his mother Risa, who works in a senior-care facility, which is located next door to Sosuke's school. His father, a sailor, is seldom home because his job is very time-demanding. Their house is located on a cliff in a picturesque Japanese coastal fishing village. One day, Sosuke discovers what appears to be or looks like a goldfish at the beach downhill from his house. He picks it up, puts it in a bucket with water, and names her Ponyo. However, it happens that Ponyo is the daughter of a powerful wizard and a sea Goddess.

With time, the wizard takes Ponyo away from Sosuke, which breaks her heart because she loves Sosuke - and she also wants to become a human.  She escapes from her father's custody, unleashing drastic changes on our planet as a result, causing tsunamis, sending earth into pre-historic times (with its fauna and flora), and getting the moon very close to the earth, leading to possible, eventual crash. Only true love will allow the balance of nature to be restored.

""Ponyo"" is just awesome. The animation is mesmerizing, as well as its attention to detail. Based on Hans Christian Andersen's classic `The Little Mermaid,"" this is a film that all the family will treasure for generations to come.  The fantastic Blue-ray edition includes documentaries in which the world of the Ghibli Studios and the film's characters are profiled, interactive games, and more. A DVD copy of the movie is provided on a second disc. In addition to PONYO, the Disney Studios also released DVD editions of ""MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO,"" ""CASTLE IN THE SKY,"" and ""KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE"" on March 2, 2010.

1129183,5,7799127775,"I was introduced to the works of Director, Hayao Miyazaki less than a decade ago. At first glance, his work may seem ""different"". My first experience with Miyazaki's work came with the best animated film of 2002, ""Spirited Away"". I have to admit, this is not the best film to use as a doorway into the world of Ghibli, as ""Spirited Away"" rides that ""different"" line a lot harder than most of his work. However, after my next experience, ""My Neighbor Totoro"", I was completely hooked. These are films that, when watched with unclouded vision, will open up your movie world to a whole other arena you never imagined possible. I am more calm and relaxed when I watch a Miyazaki film, than when I watch any other Director's work. There is a serenity present in the worlds he creates that cannot be found anywhere else.
""Ponyo"" is no exception, and in fact may be the piece that best represents that feeling I have when watching a Miyazaki film. The colors are vibrant, and the animation pristine. There is incredible value given to the art of traditional hand-drawn animation. It begs the question to enter our minds as to why that form of art has been, for the most part, abandoned. The music, (from composer Joe Hisaishi) is transcending. Mr. Hisaishi is to Hayao Miyazaki what John Williams is to Steven Spielberg. The marriage of their work is meant to be.
I cherish the innocence of the story. The characters, while experiencing extraordinary things, remain emotionally deep, and memorable. The scenery is as inviting as ever. You feel at times, as if you have become a permanent part of what you are viewing. It leaves the realm of animated film, and becomes something real, if only inside of you.
This is Miyazaki at his absolute best. If you have not been introduced to the works of this amazing Director, this is a fantastic entry point, and should be taken with no questions asked. In the opinion of this reviewer, this was the best film of 2009.",1268006400,,1952,4.644508670520231

1129185,5,7799127775,"It's wonderful to live in an era when one of the all time legends of entertainment is still actively producing works. I imagine that in years to come people will look back with tremendous fondness to the days when Hayao Miyazaki was still directing and it's a blessing to know (or at least hope) that more films are yet to come. I had heard after `Howl's Moving Castle' that Miyazaki might be retiring from directing but Ponyo laid that rumor to rest. According to Wikipedia Miyazaki is signed to direct at least two more movies but at 69 years of age you never know.

Ponyo is the story of a tiny mermaid who runs away from home only to end up in the bucket of a young boy who assumes she's a goldfish (despite her obviously humanlike face). Her father, Fujimoto, a human who now shuns humans and lives beneath the ocean tries to retrieve Ponyo using various water based magic at his disposal. Ponyo has other ideas in mind as she uses her own magic to try and become an actual human girl. Unfortunately all of this mucking around has created a rift in reality that threatens to bring complete disaster on everyone.

If you've watched more than a few Miyazaki films you'll notice that like Walt Disney he has a particular artistic style that the animators at Studio Ghibli adhere to. The first thing I noticed about Ponyo was that the art seemed a somewhat different. It's a bit rougher or perhaps more simplistic, particularly with the characters of Ponyo and her father Fujimoto, than what I've seen in previous movies like Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke. The backgrounds by contrast are absolutely lush and gorgeous and retain the dreamlike quality that is a trademark of Miyazaki films. Most of the film takes place in charming little coastal city in Japan based on the actual city of Tomonoura. The rest is underwater and it is positively glorious. It absolutely teams with life and naturally this is all hand drawn animation. It's almost impossible these days to find animation that is 100% hand drawn but unless I am mistaken there is not a CGI frame to be seen in the film. I have to applaud the effort of the animators here in drawing some if the most dynamic, vibrant images ever.

Miyazaki, like Pixar, has never produced a bad or even mediocre film only varying degrees of great. I felt that Howl's Moving Castle was below average on the Miyazaki scale and Ponyo is only somewhat better. My wife, on the other hand, felt that that Ponyo was every bit as good as Miyazaki's very best. For me the weakness was in the story which had a flaw or two. In particular it was hard to draw a distinction between what was supposed to be reality and what was supposed to be fantasy. Let me just say that the town in the movie undergoes a dramatic event, one which would generally be an utter disaster and yet here there seems to be no harm done. It's kind of like when Wily Coyote falls of a cliff and creates that ring of dust only to be up and around in the next scene. Miyazaki is generally pretty consistent in his stories and in this case it was hard to tell the boundaries. I also felt that the animation wasn't as strong as in the previous three Miyazaki films save for the backgrounds which are absolutely top notch. I don't regret for one second adding this film to my personal collection sight unseen and any nitpicking doesn't take away from the fact that this is a great film.",1268006400,,3394,4.4975688816855754

However, when I saw the reviews for Ponyo I hoped he might like it, so we watched it together today.

Wow! It is rare for him to be so completely enthralled by, and emotionally involved in, a movie. He enjoyed every little nuance of the movie to the fullest (giggling at every instance of 'HAM!'), and when Ponyo's father took her back to her home under the sea he was seriously NOT happy. When she busted out her little chicken arms and legs and ran back to her beloved Sosuke on the backs of her behemoth fish/sisters, he was almost giddy. I truly enjoyed the film and didn't want to look away at any point - the story was enjoyable in its simplicity and the artwork completely amazing - and I especially did not want to miss my son's reactions throughout.

1129280,3,7799127775,"This film is a quality family film with the usual Miyazaki combo of cute characters, morally-ambiguous ""villains"" and an eco-infused adventure along the way. Since ""My Neighbor Totoro"" Miyazaki hasn't made a film quite as accessible to children as ""Ponyo."" (It also logs in at about 15-20 minutes shorter than most Miyazaki films.)

One of charms that has drawn me to Miyazaki's work is the exquisitely hand-drawn feel of the pencil line art that have always been painted in a graphically rich two-shade process. The backgrounds are often enchanting pieces of watercolor-style art that could stand as lovely art even apart from the bonus you get with charming and mysterious animated characters. Fortunately, as the age of computers has sped up the production process and reduced the costs of 2D animation, even the previous digitally painted Miyazaki/Ghibli film ""Howl's Moving Castle"" still preserved a tremendous level of the artistic quality that the earlier hand-drawn, hand-cel-painted films had.

""Ponyo"" on DVD is a stunning transfer compared to previous Miyazaki DVD releases. There is hardly any artifacting on the DVD transfer. The only bad detail is the hiccup where the film transfers out to play English intro/credits or Japanese intro/credits depending on what language has been chosen. Blu-ray is even more pristine a picture.

Unfortunately, this more pristine quality shows off that Studio Ghibli compromised too greatly on the digital conversion of the hand-drawn art. Line art looks overly black, rigid and sterile at times, like it was auto-traced with vector-art animation software. The softer nuances of the pencil art upon which it is based are lost most of the time. The digital painted ""cels"" are clean, but overly flat and without grain, and frequently missing the elegance of the two-color shading style that has been used consistently in previous Miyazaki films. Backgrounds at times look like cheaper digitally airbrushed backgrounds, which really stand out as horrid compared to some of the nice ""Ponyo"" backgrounds. ""Ponyo"" is very bright and colorful, yes, but below the art standard of previous Miyazaki films. Some scenes are so bad, and some characters so consistently poorly rendered (like the ""bad guy"" father Fujimoto) that ""Ponyo"" art comes off more as a glorified Saturday Morning Cartoon, and not as a lilting, nuanced, subtly elegant masterwork like has come before.

""Ponyo"" is a charming and worthwhile film to see, for sure, especially if young children are in tow. But of all the Ghibli films to get Hi-Def treatment no film has come up so short in showcasing the Studio Ghibli masterful, artistic 2D animation heritage as ""Ponyo"".

The film which is budgeted around $34 million dollars made over $199 million worldwide.  Where his 1988 film ""My Neighbor Totoro"" was Miyazaki's tale for older children, this time around for ""Ponyo"" he wanted to create a film for young children and was inspired from Hans Christian Anderson's ""The Little Mermaid"".

VIDEO:

Magical, beautiful and everything that you can expect from Hayao Miyazaki.  I was completely in awe when I watched this film.  In this day and age, we tend to put so much into CG animated films and rarely do we see hand drawn quality animation anymore.  I'm so glad that Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli continues to show this creative style through this film. The hand painted backgrounds are absolutely beautiful, the character design continues that Miyazaki look and style but looks absolutely fluid during its more action-oriented scenes.

Presented in 1080p High Definition, detail can be seen on the painted backgrounds.  Vibrant during the day scenes with trees that are full of detail and water reflecting the trees, cliffs showcasing the detail as shadows and detail showcasing the curvature and the little pieces of grass that are placed within the rocks.  The scene with the storm and the crashing features Miyazaki's handiwork as he created the water and his waves all by himself.  It's an amazing sight to see.

There are no compression artifacts, edge enhancement, aliasing, banding or any problems in picture quality for ""Ponyo"" whatsoever.  ""Ponyo"" achieves perfection!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Ponyo"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS Master Audio (48 kHz/24-bit) and in Japanese and French 5.1 Dolby Digital.  First the good.  The English dub track is fantastic.  You want an immersive soundscape, ""Ponyo"" delivers.  From the sound of the ocean, bubbles popping, the rush of the waves, the sounds of trees rustling, the sound of rain, sea animals swimming in the water and most of all, a beautiful musical score by Joe Hisaishi.  This soundtrack is absolutely divine.  Great use of front and center channels with dialogue and music that is crystal clear.  The surround channels and the use of LFE as the sound effects bring ""Ponyo"" to life.  This lossless soundtrack is perfect!

Now the bad.  There is no lossless Japanese audio soundtrack.  The Japanese Blu-ray release has a lossless soundtrack but what happened to it for this Blu-ray release?  There is no doubt that audiophile purists who want the original Japanese soundtrack are going to be upset by this and one can hope that if Disney does bring out a Miyazaki release on Blu-ray in the near future, that a lossless soundtrack is included for both the English and Japanese audio.

Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Once again, Miyazaki continues to prove to us that hand-drawn animation is absolutely beautiful and there is no need to join the pack and create a CG animated film.  ""Ponyo"" succeeds on all levels - storyline, animation, music and its soundtrack.  I absolutely loved this film!

Before I saw the film, I figured that people were so used to Miyazaki's more serious work and for him to try to go back to something similar to ""My Neighbor Totoro"" was going to be difficult in this day and age but with ""Ponyo"", he managed to pull it off.  The world he creates is magical, the characters are just enjoyable to watch.  From every scene, I was literally just loving the animation and the painted backgrounds and to find out that Miyazaki actually drew the sea and the waves himself using 170,000 separate images is amazing.

In terms of any deep messages on society or ecology, in ""Ponyo"", we see how trash and waste has been collecting on the ocean floors and Ponyo being stuck in a bottle lying in a wasteland under the sea.  For Fujimoto, as he tries to maneuver underwater, waste and garbage is everywhere.  So, it was great to see Miyazaki convey how people have mistreated the ocean with their garbage and incorporating it to the storyline.

The Blu-ray is absolutely beautiful when it comes to picture quality, lossless audio and also contains a good number of special features.  If there was only one thing that prevents this Blu-ray release from reaching perfection is the lack of a lossless Japanese audio soundtrack.  But both English and Japanese vocals are well-done with the English track featuring all-star talent with Tina Fey, Liam Neeson, Cate Blanchett, Betty White, Cloris Leachmen, Lily Tomlin and Matt Damon providing their voices for this film.  Even Jonas Brothers sibling Frankie Jonas (as Sosuke) and Miley's younger sister Noah (as Ponyo) do a great job as the primary vocals.  The Japanese soundtrack features two of Japan's top celebrities with George Tokoro lending his voice for Fujimoto and Tomoko Yamaguchi as Lisa.  And also Hiroki Doi (Sosuke) and Yuria Nana (Ponyo) do a wonderful job providing the main voices for the Japanese audio track as well.

Overall, Hayao Miyazaki is truly a remarkable filmmaker and ""Ponyo"" is a true masterpiece.  Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli show no signs of waning and they manage to capture the magic that I have felt when I was younger when I first watched Ghibli classics such as ""Nausicaa"", ""My Neighbor Totoro"", ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" and ""Laputa: Castle in the Sky"".  This Blu-ray release is highly recommended!",1267488000,64,8567,5.018452803406672
1129283,4,7799127775,"Alright, I've heard many good reviews of Ponyo and a few negative ones. I can definitely see what there is to like, because there is much, but I also see where the film could have fallen short in the eyes of many viewers. I am not a strong fan of anime, but my friends are. I do like anime though; I think many artists and storytellers have achieved great things through their works in anime but, for me, nothing compares to the works of Hayao Miyazaki. He seems to capture a magic in his visuals paired with his song choices and overall tone. I am a huge fan of Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, and Howl's Moving Castle, and I have become a fan of Ponyo. The reason I give this movie four stars is not because I do not like it, but because I felt it wasn't as strong as Miyazaki's other films. The four stars is based on a comparison which I probably should not even have made. This is why I say: if you're buying Ponyo because you love Miyazaki and you love the intricate details in the storytelling as well as the epic storyline (like Princess Mononoke), you will not get it here. This movie is more contained, simpler. Does that make it a bad movie? Heck no! On the contrary, Ponyo's simplicity is what makes it so great. It is the kind of movie that tells a simple enough story, but manages to bombard your eyes with beautiful, colorful images that are not simplistic in any way. I do recommend this movie; but don't do what I did: don't go in there expecting a two hour epic anime like Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke, because it is not those movies. Allow yourself to be taken in and don't expect too much, because sometimes too much is not a good thing. Ponyo is just enough. Enjoy!",1267401600,,1694,4.313479623824452
1129284,5,7799127775,"I haven't loved a Miyazaki movie since Princess Mononoke. Everything about this movie is amazing, especially the visuals. I was compelled from start to finish and I can't say enough great things about this movie. The video quality of the blu-ray is absolutely gorgeous; true reference material.

With that said, I had this blu-ray pre-ordered until reviews came out and reveled that only the English track is given the DTS-HD MA treatment. The original Japanese is given a measly Dolby Digital 5.1 (DVD audio.) I cancelled my pre-order immediately. I buy blu-rays because I want the full HD treatment and clearly Disney doesn't care about purists like myself. In my opinion, dubs are rarely ever good and this movie is no exception. Regardless, the original audio track is clearly how the movie was intended to be presented and the original track should never be treated this poorly.

I may buy this blu-ray down the road because I love the movie itself so much but only a crazy sale price will make this appealing to me.

So if you're a film purist like me, beware of the blu-ray.",1267142400,5,1081,4.770053475935829
1129400,5,7799127775,"I adored this movie. If you are a true Miyazaki fan, you will too. Its got less of a plot in it than other films such as Howls, but its still amazing. It sucks you in with that true Miyazaki feel. I always get a comforted feeling when Im watching these films, and this one was nothing different. Love love loved it!",1266883200,2,315,4.096774193548387
1129401,4,7799127775,"Hayao Miyazaki loves and respects children; he knows them well and gives them far more credit than many of you seem to.  Bambi's mother being burned to death frightened the heck out of me as a kid, not to mention all of the other ""acceptable"" Disney films where characters meet violent ends, but I apparently survived this childhood trauma and matured into a healthy adult.  Parents, your children are NOT as delicate as you want to believe they are.  While not quite as compelling as Princess Mononke in my opinion, Ponyo is a beautiful movie that the whole family should enjoy together.  And here's a spoiler, both parents live!",1266883200,2,630,4.752293577981652
1129402,1,7799127775,"This is the first film in quite a few years that I have so thoroughly disliked.  Many admirers claim ""it's hand-drawn, not the cold, heartless work of computers!"" or ""the symbolism is so important and you obviously don't get it,"" or ""Miyazaki's a master!"" or ""you need to attend to what's not being said as much as what IS being said."" I still say any film that has a father-figure dressed like a bad drag combo of Ann-Margaret and Cher, any film that has a mother ignore warnings and outrace a flood in her crappy car and then LEAVE her very young child alone (with a strange fish!) in said flood in order to check on a bunch of old folks who are in an institution miles away with other guardians, any film that allows 5-year-olds to determine their destinies in love, and any film that so clearly wimps out at its climax is hooey.  Enjoy the magic!  Revel in childhood innocence!  Accept the unacceptable!  Yep, heard and read it all before. Ponyo's annoying and endless repetition of ""Sosuke"" and ""ham"" is grating (not cute), and the ecological message is heavy-handed.  Miyazaki is more interested in emotions than conflict; yet, without conflict, emotional impact is lost.  Again, I'm supposed to believe that this boy and fish are drawn (pun intended) together? Are fated soul-mates? Kids, get back to me in 20 years and let's see how you're doing. Yes, I hear the collective intake of great indignation, but for me, this was an exercise in tedium and sappiness.",1266796800,52,1468,4.666666666666667
1129403,4,7799127775,I saw this movie with my nieces back in August 2009 and they enjoyed it a lot. I'm looking forward to getting Ponyo on DVD but I shouldn't have to put up with a DVD that skimps on extras and I shouldn't have to buy the Blu Ray pack to get it. I look forward to being able to buy Ponyo by itself on a letterbox format DVD. I hope enough people yell at Disney to tell them to get with the program. Put essentially the same content on all editions they produce.,1266624000,3,458,3.935483870967742
1129404,5,7799127775,"As a long time fan of Hayao Miyazaki, I was overjoyed when I learned that he had created yet another one of his masterpieces, and now it's going to be released at the beginning of next month!

I actually had the chance to watch the full movie before I bought it,  and I have to say it's just as charming, sweet and at the same time entertaining as any other of his masterpieces. In fact, I am in college and I'd rather watch this movie than Princess Mononoke sometimes (even though Princess Mononoke was a stellar film also). Once again we see that he has placed an ecological lesson for us in the guise of a children's movie which is wonderfully delightful if you're a grown up kid as well. That's perhaps the best part of this movie: it doesn't just entertain, but it brings up important issues that we in the real world cannot afford to ignore.

Ponyo is not only irresistibly adorable, she is a very determined little goldfish whose desire is to be human, which I think too many people take for granted. FIve year old Sosuke is beyond precious in his efforts to take care of Ponyo, and both children can bring you back to a time when everything was much simpler.

And then of course, there's the part that Miyazaki-sensei is known for more than anything: the sheer beauty of his work. Even though this is a children's movie, no corners were cut in the animation of this film, in my opinion.  Just the opening scene alone of the jelly fish rising in the ocean is mesmerizing to say the least.

Now having said that, I only have one warning: DON'T LISTEN TO THE DUB!

Well, the Disney dub was at best OKAY, but it was certainly no substitute for the original actors.

To conclude without revealing too much, this movie is a must have for any Hayao Miyazaki fan, or anybody who's never even heard of him before.",1265500800,3,1812,4.404191616766467
1129405,5,7799127775,"A wonderful gift to your film library.  I cannot add anything that hasn't already been said about this amazing film.

I understand the frustration of not getting the toy but, I'm sure that Disney has done their homework.  This film - geared toward the young (as mentioned by Miyazake in one of the reviews) - will sell to families.

Especially now, those families - most likely - aren't upgrading to Blu-Ray and are sticking with their old DVD players until times get better.  Me?  Single and unemployed.  For as much as I want the Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack to plan for the future, I will stick with the DVD until I have a good job under my belt and a few credit cards paid off.

I was at a Goodwill in Prescott, Arizona in September and spoke with a Mother that uses the VCR tapes donated as her library for her young daughter's viewing.  As a gauge, Walmart doesn't even stock VCR's anymore.

So - young son or daughter and a regular DVD player?  That's the market for the toy.",1265241600,14,976,4.396648044692737
1129406,5,7799127775,"In an age where the majority of children's movies have inappropriate language or potty humor, sexual suggestiveness, stereotypical gender roles, and a good deal of violence and fighting, the films of Hiyao Miyazaki are a breath of fresh air. My children are 4 and 6 and they absolutely LOVED this movie. We saw it in the theater twice. As others have said, the animation is incredibly beautiful. The characters are unique, the story is imaginative and wondrous. Sure, maybe every detail is not explained, but this is a children's film -- children don't need every detail to be explained. The story moves along in a dreamlike way, much the same way that a child's imagination flows.

As far as the film being scary, my four-year-old was a bit frightened of Ponyo's father at first. However, this movie is so tame compared to most children's movies today. My children were much more frightened by the baby who burst into flames in The Incredibles and the monsters who scare children in Monsters, Inc. than they were by Ponyo. I think it is partly because Ponyo is so surreal and dreamlike where many children's movies have an element of reality to them. There is no doubt in the viewer's mind that this film is make-believe -- perhaps this is why it did not scare my children as much as other Disney films.

Anyway, I highly recommend this movie, particularly for children ages 4-7. The animation is extraordinary, the characters are loveable, and it is overall just a refreshing change from other children's movies today.",1264118400,5,1520,4.819923371647509
1129407,1,7799127775,"Ponyo is not a great and perfect film by any means. I love Miyazaki's works but this one is not quite on target. But I still will buy it because it does have charming Miyazaki touches, and the characters are drawn from faces we love from Totoro and all of Miyazaki's films. What I find especially objectionable is Disney's marketing ploy: the Ponyo plush looks cute, but why is it only available with the DVD, and not the blu-ray? I contacted Disney and got the sorry but plush only with the DVD...which tells me nothing new. I am willing to buy into the combo pack where you get both the DVD and Blu-ray together,but how much more sweeter would it be to have that Ponyo plush included?",1263859200,20,686,4.409448818897638
1129408,5,7799127775,"The mother Lisa has the most poignant line in ""Ponyo,"" saying the equivalent of ""When you find yourself surrounded by magic and wonder, you don't try and understand it you just enjoy it.""

To me, that is the theme and lesson of ""Ponyo"" (""Gake no Ue no Ponyou"" or ""Ponyo on the Cliffs""). After dabbling in darker themes and more adult-orientated fare like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Princess-Mononoke/dp/B00003CXBK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Princess Mononoke</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spirited-Away/dp/B00005JLEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spirited Away</a>, Miyazaki has returned to the lighter, simpler themes of the magic and mystery of childhood as found in his groundbreaking&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Neighbor-Totoro/dp/B002ZTQV8Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Neighbor Totoro</a>. One can always tell the target audience for a Miyazaki film by the age of the main character: ""Spirited Away"" was made for 10-year olds, ""Princess Mononoke"" was made for teenagers. The lead characters in ""Ponyo"" are 5 years old.

Like ""My Neighbor Totoro,"" ""Ponyo"" is a film based on a childlike sense of joy and imagination. There is no need for a ""villain"" or some arbitrary conflict or threat for the children to overcome. Like Satsuki and Mei, Sosuke and Ponyo are pure at heart, and open to exploring the wonders around them. They feel their emotions without cynicism or thought, instead living in the moment and experiencing its joys, sorrows and fears.

Which is not to say there is no depth here. In ""Ponyo,"" Miyazaki has blended two unlikely sources; Richard Wagner's pounding opera&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Die-Walkure/dp/B00092ZAOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Die Walkure</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Der-Ring-Des-Nibelungen/dp/B000QFBW6K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Der Ring Des Nibelungen</a>&nbsp;and Hans Christian Anderson's melancholy fairy tale&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Little-Mermaid/dp/0786803835/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Little Mermaid</a>. The essential set-up comes from ""Die Walkure,"" where the god Wotan holds the goddess Freia captive, and is also the possessor of the Rhinegold Ring which grants vast magical powers so long as one gives up all possibility of love. As a nod to this, the name Ponyo is giving by her father is Br&uuml;nnhilde, one of the Valkyrie who feels the power of the Ring and must make the choice between love and paradise. This story is skillfully blended with Anderson's ""Little Mermaid,"" about a sea creature who must win the love of a human or be reduced to soulless sea foam.

Miyazaki essentially presents two movies. The front film is basic, colorful and easy to understand for children. The animation in ""Ponyo"" is some of the best that I have ever seen, with Miyazaki personally drawing much of the underwater and ocean scenes, utilizing the influence of classic Japanese ukiyo-e pictures. Miyazaki has said that ""Ponyo"" is his most technically complicated film, using more unique images than any previous film.

The second, deeper story is something that can only be assembled from fragments and snatches of conversation. For example, the wizard Fujimoto, Ponyo's father, was a human being who fell in love with the ocean goddess Gran Mammare, and struggled for centuries to burn away his humanity and become consort and protector for the entity he loved. More than anyone, he understands the sacrifices and struggles awaiting Ponyo when she loves someone not of her world. These story/sub-story elements are one of the things I love so much about Japanese film, where more expectations are put on the audience to read between the lines and to give thought to the unspoken as well as the spoken

I am not sure how much of this deeper story survived the translation into English, as I watched the film in Japanese. There are some nuances that probably went missing, and I am curious as to how some of the scenes were handled, such as when Lisa sings Sosuke a part of the theme song to ""My Neighbor Totoro"" to cheer him up when his father is not home. Some other things, such as the significance of tunnels in Japanese folklore (considered the realm of female Mountain Gods who are prone to jealousy, it is assumed that the tunnel would not take kindly to a water deity passing through. However, outside the tunnel is a statue of Jizo, the protector of children, which sends a visual clue to the audience that Sosuke and Ponyo are going to be alright.) also might pass unnoticed or appear confusing to Western audiences, although every Japanese person would inately understand this without needing to be told.

Miyazaki proved in ""Ponyo"" that he is still the greatest director of animated films alive. I am so thrilled to have seen this movie, and I know I will watch it again and again.",1263427200,16,5062,5.860244233378562
1129409,3,7799127775,"Ponyo has about the most beautiful animation I have ever seen in a movie. It is simply stunning. It seems to live in a world somewhere between Anime and Japanese woodcuts. The large stunning blocks of vibrant colour almost live in themselves and most of the actual things which are chosen to be animated are stunning to - however this does little to hide what seems to be a stilted story which I feel sure has lost something in the translation both of language and culture from Japanese to English.

This is the retold tale, Japanese style, of the little mermaid. Brunhilde is the daughter of a mad scientist and the sea/earth mother. She is a fish like creature who lives in her father's ship in a bubble under the sea. But she wants more, and in the opening scenes escapes inside a jellyfish, the most beautiful scene to open a movie with.

She ends up being saved from certain death by a little boy, Sosuke, who takes her to school but loses her back to the sea in a rather child-frightening scene where the scientist summons up some fierce and sinister looking waves.

Ponyo (or Brunhilda to her father) returns to Sosuke determined to be a girl. She drinks her father's elixirs and unbalances the world in the process. The tsunami scenes are both fearfully frightening again for some young children, and hilarious - Ponyo - now a little girl runs along the top of the waves.

It all is resolved and the earth mother talks to Sosuke's mother and Sosuke says he will love Ponyo forever and all is well with the world again.

The story just didn't seem to flow. The mother and earth mother talking for long hours. The Old lady who refused to go under water and is taken down anyway, Sosuke and Ponyo's long, seemingly pointless trip in the boat. The very strange prehistoric fish which swim, seemingly threateningly, under their boat. And why does Sosuke say ""pre-cambrian"". I know what Pre-Cambrian is, but is there a point that they are there? Is there a point that he knows? why aren't there just fish there? Is this because the balance of the world is out? But then why does Sosuke, a 5 year old know?

Sorry, but for me the movie was full of these sort of questions. What was this or that all about? Some is explained but very often I think there is something really important been missed out somehow.

Anyway. It was an all right movie to watch. My 7 year old quite liked it, the 6 year old found it very frightening, and I found it frustrating and full of unexplained things.",1263081600,7,2484,4.482300884955753
1129599,5,7799127775,"This film has been well summarized and reviewed so let me keep this personal...

I have been a fan of Miyazaki's work for more years than most folks in the states have known he existed.  Like most fans I thought the peak of his artistic achievements were Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away.  However after having children and rearing them to the age that I thought it worthwhile to begin exposing them to these films (my boy is 6 and my twin girls are 4) I have found a new dimension by which to judge these films.  This new dimension is the simplicity of the stories being told and how well their message can be absorbed by young children.  What I have found is that Miyazaki's genius runs deeper than I had originally thought in my art snob anime days.  The genius is in the simplicity of some of his stories and how well he is able to strike the balance wherein a story is palatable to younger viewers (4-6) but no less relevant for an adult viewer.  And when looking through his body of work you can often find that love for the beauty in simplicity in the worlds he creates.  These are simple stories that take place in a larger fantastic world, and all the intricacies of that world need not be explained ad nauseum to the view, we are there for the story and must simply accept the fantastic and magical elements within that story without weighty explanations.

Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea is a perfect example of a simple story that is told in a way that is both poignant and beautiful to behold.  The story is well explained in other reviews so I will leave those bits out and say simply that it is a joy to watch for the whole family and after multiple viewings with the children I find myself just as drawn to the screen as they are.  The story lacks the complexity and maturity of Princess Mononoke because it doesn't require it.  The characters are bright and lovably innocent though they exist in an imperfect world were parents have many responsibilities and sometimes can't make it to dinner because of work.  Sosuke is a brave and mature little boy whom you can tell has been shaped that way by the adversities of his family life.  For me the character demonstrates that even in a family where work requires much of the parents time that the love they exhibit and express to their child makes up for raising him in an imperfect situation, which I feel is a theme in many other of Miyazaki's stories such as My Neighbor Totoro.  Ponyo is vibrant and always excited in the new world of possibilities that she has found above the water, and though she inadvertently causes some havoc in the world around her, her good natured frolicking tends to make you forget that she is the cause of most of the stories upheaval.
As in most of Miyazaki's stories there is no true antagonist and the conflict is limited mostly to the natural fallout of Ponyo's transformation.  This however does not take away from the story in my opinion as is usually the case with these movies.  Miyazaki's movies typically end in a spirit of resolution and understanding rather than victory over an enemy which I feel is a great lesson for the kids to understand the concept of moral ambiguity and trying to resolve conflicts through understanding rather than the violent destruction of an uncompromising evil.
Pony has definitely become the favorite movie for now in the house and the kids cannot stop watching it and after having it a few weeks I find myself no less impressed by its charm and of course its visually stunning animation.  I would recommend all of Miyazaki's work to anyone young or old but in particular I would recommend this for houses with younger children as your experience will be enhanced by observing them as they take in all the visuals of this wonderful fantasy story (And be sure to sing along with them to ""Ponyo, Ponyo, little fishy in the sea.."").  If you enjoy Ponyo I would strongly recommend you follow it closely with ""The Cat Returns"" and ""My Neighbor Totoro""",1262563200,4,3986,4.534170153417016
1129600,5,7799127775,"Hayao Miyazaki is one of those rare directors who can take the magic of nature and childhood, then somehow capture it for the screen.

And his tenth Ghibli movie ""Ponyo"" is no exception -- it's a reimagined tale of a ""little mermaid"" who wants to become human so she can be with a little human boy she loves. It's a simple story told in a simple manner (occasionally TOO simple), but it has a lush oceanic beauty and an innocent sweetness that really capture your heart and imagination.

A little boy named Sosuke finds a tiny ""goldfish"" with a human face on a beach, trapped in a bottle. He names her Ponyo, and goes to great lengths to care for his little fishy friend. But then the sea wizard Fujimoto, Ponyo's overprotective dad, appears and snatches Ponyo back into the sea -- and she decides that she wants to become human so she can be with Sosuke. Having tasted a bit of Sosuke's blood, she sprouts chickenleggy limbs and starts to change, but inadvertently disrupts a magical well that causes the moon to drop, the seas to rise over the land, and prehistoric magic to rise once more.

Sosuke and Ponyo are delighted to be reunited, despite the raging storm that is engulfing the city and causing ships to go missing. While the children go searching for Sosuke's missing mother, Fujimoto struggles to fix the balance of nature before the entire world is destroyed, with the help of Ponyo's sea goddess mother. The only hope of restoring balance lies in Ponyo and Sosuke -- and if Sosuke's love is not true, then Ponyo will be reduced to sea foam.

Compared to Miyazaki's other movies, ""Ponyo"" is a very simple story -- it's basically a boy-meets-fishgirl story, with lots of children running around being adorable and exquisite looks at the sea. Even its theme is simple -- the story is dependent on on true selfless love and how it knows no boundaries of age, experience or even species. Not to mention parents letting go of their children.

If there's a downside to the story, it's the lack of internal conflict. Example: the ""test"" that Fujimoto and the sea goddess use for Sosuke... well, it's far less impressive than it seems.

And Miyazaki does not disappoint animationwise -- he conjures a waterworld of luminous sea life, sparkling ships, prehistoric creatures, finned submarines and a town that has been swallowed by the sea (complete with boats floating over the rooftops). It's an exquisite piece of work that turns the ocean into a magical, otherworldly realm where wizards work in coral-encrusted towers and shimmering jellyfish take little mermaids to the surface.

Ponyo herself provides a lot of the movie's charm -- she's effusive, hyperactive, has a babylike fascination with the human world (""HAM!""), and an array of handy magical powers. Sosuke is a likable lad who is fascinated by Ponyo and her world, and Fujimoto makes a enjoyable anti-hero -- spindly, gaunt and with a mane of messy red hair, he's like a rock'n'roll embodiment of parental stress.

The extras are pretty promising on this blu-ray, and they seem to be the same as the regular DVD edition's extras (rather than stiffing or one or the other group of buyers) -- a slew of documentaries and interviews (including with Miyazaki himself), storyboards, explorations of the story's background, et cetera. And most striking is the ""World of Ghibli,"" an interactive creation which apparently allows people to ""enter"" the worlds of various Miyazaki movies -- ""Ponyo's,"" ""Kiki's,"" ""Castle in the Sky's,"" and so on. And given how luminous and lush the colors are, the movie itself should be spellbinding visually.

""Ponyo"" is simpler and more childlike fare than most of Miyazaki's past films, but it's still a sweet and lushly-animated piece of work. At the very least, it will transport you to a magical childhood.",1261094400,5,3803,4.8474576271186445

To me, that is the theme and lesson of ""Ponyo"" (""Gake no Ue no Ponyou"" or ""Ponyo on the Cliffs""). After dabbling in darker themes and more adult-orientated fare like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Princess-Mononoke/dp/B00003CXBK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Princess Mononoke</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spirited-Away/dp/B00005JLEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spirited Away</a>, Miyazaki has returned to the lighter, simpler themes of the magic and mystery of childhood as found in his groundbreaking&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Neighbor-Totoro/dp/B00003CXCZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Neighbor Totoro</a>. One can always tell the target audience for a Miyazaki film by the age of the main character: ""Spirited Away"" was made for 10-year olds, ""Princess Mononoke"" was made for teenagers. The lead characters in ""Ponyo"" are 5 years old.

Like ""My Neighbor Totoro,"" ""Ponyo"" is a film based on a childlike sense of joy and imagination. There is no need for a ""villain"" or some arbitrary conflict or threat for the children to overcome. Like Satsuki and Mei, Sosuke and Ponyo are pure at heart, and open to exploring the wonders around them. They feel their emotions without cynicism or thought, instead living in the moment and experiencing its joys, sorrows and fears.

Which is not to say there is no depth here. In ""Ponyo,"" Miyazaki has blended two unlikely sources; Richard Wagner's pounding opera&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wagner-Die-Walkure/dp/B00092ZAOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wagner - Die Walkure</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Der-Ring-Des-Nibelungen/dp/B000QFBW6K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Der Ring Des Nibelungen</a>&nbsp;and Hans Christian Anderson's melancholy fairy tale&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Little-Mermaid/dp/0786803835/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Little Mermaid</a>. The essential set-up comes from ""Die Walkure,"" where the god Wotan holds the goddess Freia captive, and is also the possessor of the Rhinegold Ring which grants vast magical powers so long as one gives up all possibility of love. As a nod to this, the name Ponyo is giving by her father is Brnnhilde, one of the Valkyrie who feels the power of the Ring and must make the choice between love and paradise. This story is skillfully blended with Anderson's ""Little Mermaid,"" about a sea creature who must win the love of a human or be reduced to soulless sea foam.

Miyazaki essentially presents two movies. The front film is basic, colorful and easy to understand for children. The animation in ""Ponyo"" is some of the best that I have ever seen, with Miyazaki personally drawing much of the underwater and ocean scenes, utilizing the influence of classic Japanese ukiyo-e pictures. Miyazaki has said that ""Ponyo"" is his most technically complicated film, using more unique images than any previous film.

The second, deeper story is something that can only be assembled from fragments and snatches of conversation. For example, the wizard Fujimoto, Ponyo's father, was a human being who fell in love with the ocean goddess Gran Mammare, and struggled for centuries to burn away his humanity and become consort and protector for the entity he loved. More than anyone, he understands the sacrifices and struggles awaiting Ponyo when she loves someone not of her world. These story/sub-story elements are one of the things I love so much about Japanese film, where more expectations are put on the audience to read between the lines and to give thought to the unspoken as well as the spoken

I am not sure how much of this deeper story survived the translation into English, as I watched the film in Japanese. There are some nuances that probably went missing, and I am curious as to how some of the scenes were handled, such as when Lisa sings Sosuke a part of the theme song to ""My Neighbor Totoro"" to cheer him up when his father is not home. Some other things, such as the significance of tunnels in Japanese folklore (considered the realm of female Mountain Gods who are prone to jealousy, it is assumed that the tunnel would not take kindly to a water deity passing through. However, outside the tunnel is a statue of Jizo, the protector of children, which sends a visual clue to the audience that Sosuke and Ponyo are going to be alright.) also might pass unnoticed or appear confusing to Western audiences, although every Japanese person would inately understand this without needing to be told.

Miyazaki proved in ""Ponyo"" that he is still the greatest director of animated films alive. I am so thrilled to have seen this movie, and I know I will watch it again and again.",1260921600,2,5072,5.855209742895805
1129603,5,7799127775,"As a fan of Hayao Miyazaki's many other animated films, I thoroughly enjoyed Ponyo. Though it is slightly more childish and innocent than Miyazaki's other stories, it was a pure delight!

As I suspected, Ponyo is loosely based on The Little Mermaid. She is a little fish who washes up on shore to have a young boy discover and befriend her. Sosuke and Ponyo soon become very close friends and they share an innocent love for each other. But Ponyo longs to be human (hence the little mermaid reference) and her father, Fujimoto, who watches over the sea, is worried this transformation will upset the balance of nature. Sosuke must prove his love for Ponyo for things to go unscathed.

Obviously what makes this movie is the beautiful artwork. It is so imaginative and breathtaking; half the time I was simply admiring the art. The story is very different from Miyazaki's other films. Whereas Spirited Away is more of a lesson and a deep, moving, story, Ponyo is much more lighthearted and fun. I could not stop laughing throughout the movie!! When Ponyo yells HAM you will laugh just as hard, trust me. And her little mannerisms, along with the innocence of childhood, are just delightful and make you want to giggle the whole time.

Ponyo is a definite must-see for all Miyazaki fans, of course, but also for anyone who appreciates well-drawn art and a simple, fun story.

HAAAAM!",1260921600,4,1381,4.741666666666666
1129604,5,7799127775,"I love all of Hayao Miyazaki's movies and I loved Ponyo. This was the first movie in a theater that my squirmy 3 yr daughter ever saw and she was simply entranced and actually sat through the whole thing. I recommend this wondrous charming movie to any age group and any person. It is artful and marvelous.

Now given all that is this particular DVD version the English dubbed one that was seen in American theaters? It is very confusing. The Amazon page gives the American Actors as the principle players in the animated movie and then says it is Japanese with English Subtitles. I am very hesitant to buy this version for my kids since it does not appear to know what it actually is.",1260921600,2,685,4.436507936507937
1129605,4,7799127775,"Ponyo is a young fish-girl who loves to explore, but her father, a great wizard of the sea, fears the chaos her untamed powers could unleash upon the world.  He's right to worry, since she, like every young undomesticated child, is an elemental force of nature who has little respect for the boundaries that grownups take so seriously.  She escapes and meets up with a young boy whose imagination at least is a match for her magical powers - and it is love at first sight.  Not romantic love but something more innocent and pure - like the youthful love of nature.

It starts out strong - and contains some of Miyazaki's most delightful and exuberant imagery, as when Ponyo runs blissfully upon the backs of her sisters who are at once giant fish and enormous waves.  The story itself as it develops has gaps, moments that don't all add up, and unexplained elements.  As another reviewer mentioned, for example, the test that Fujimoto and the sea goddess devise for Sosuke is somewhat anticlimactic, unlike the tests faced by the heroine of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spirited-Away/dp/B00005JLEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spirited Away</a>.  I had the suspicion several times that perhaps Disney cut things out for its U.S. release - since the plot lacked some of the depth and richness in its backstory of many of Miyazaki's other works.  A bit of searching shows I was wrong - this is the film Hayao Miyazaki intended.  He is quoted in the L.A. Daily News as saying: ""I intentionally tried to simplify things for this film. I figured that this movie should be seen by 5-year-olds, since they are the main characters. So I made the storytelling easy to understand. I figured they could watch it later as adults and understand the more complex parts of it, so I didn't foreground those elements.""  In hindsight he may be right -- from a young person's perspective what matters is just the magical relation between two young children, and from their perspective everything else, the fate of the cosmos, even, hinges on that.

Like most of his films, there is an ecological message here, that humans tend to ignore the wonders around them and treat carelessly the gift of the earth.  Here it is expressed in an entertaining and magical story that will be easily understood by children.  While, from the perspective of an adult viewer, I found this film less fully satisfying than masterpieces like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spirited-Away/dp/B00005JLEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spirited Away</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Princess-Mononoke/dp/B00003CXBK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Princess Mononoke</a>, or even the delicate and rich&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Neighbor-Totoro/dp/B0001XAQ0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Neighbor Totoro</a>&nbsp;- which is the closest in spirit to this film - still it contains some remarkable and beautiful imagery and delightful moments.  Well worth watching, and a very lovely and simple introduction to the work of one of the most inventive and important animated storytellers alive.  There's no one else quite like him, and we're lucky to have another Miyazaki film, especially given his initial plans to retire upon completing the Academy Award-winning&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spirited-Away/dp/B00005JLEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spirited Away</a>.

Directed by Hayao Miyazaki (2008)
-----------------------------------------
I had the great fortune to see this film in a large, modern movie theatre, with a lot of little kids in the audience for a mid-afternoon matinee. It was a marvelous movie, totally ""age appropriate"" for the enchanted five- and six-year olds, as well as their appreciative adult attendants. Miyazaki's films can sometimes be a little too weird or sinister for this age group, but this time he managed to temper his dark side a bit and make a film that still celebrates nature and respects its dangerous side, while not also creeping the bejeezus out of little viewers.

The film is set by the oceanside, and this wave-washed setting affords Miyazaki many opportunities to evoke the power of the natural world, as well as to frequently overwhelm the viewer's senses. (It was gorgeous and evocative on the big screen; I wonder how much of this will translate to video...) Although some of Miyazaki's older fans may grumble about him babying-down his material, ""Ponyo"" is clearly a great film, probably better than naysayers might think, and certainly one of the best films made for small children in the last twenty or thirty years. The character animation is a bit rough, but the backgrounds and overall design of the film are rich, sensual and majestic, and Miyazaki's key themes come through loud and clear. Highly recommended!

1129607,4,7799127775,"Among my favorite anime films are Hayao Miyazaki`s ""Princess Mononoke"" and ""Spirited Away"" (won Best Animated film); those two films are truly masterworks of animation accompanied by a very intricate storyline. ""Howl's Moving Castle"" was good but I thought it was a bit of a mixed bag. Miyazaki's eighth film for Japanese animation company ""Studio Ghibli"", ""PONYO On The Cliff"" (full title: Gake No Ue No Ponyo) has been imported by Disney to U.S. shores on a limited theatrical run. The way to approach any of Miyazaki's films is to temper your expectations; although honestly, hearing about another Miyazaki film is just so delightful that any Miyazaki fan would become excited. ""Ponyo"" is more a family-friendly film that uses the traditional hand drawn animation instead of CGI. This has been promoted as Miyazaki's last film.

Sosuke (voiced by Doi Hiroki) is a young boy who lives with his young mom Lisa (voiced by Yamaguchi Tomoko) in a small house on a cliff that overlooks a small port in Japan (Based on Seto Island) One day, he encounters a magical sea sprite/goldfish that he found on the beach who he names ""Ponyo"". Taking the magical creature to wherever he goes, the two have such a good bonding because of a certain cured meat called ""ham'. But as soon as the two become close, Fujimoto (Tokoro Joji) a former human who has rejected the surface world who has become a sea sorcerer who collects magical elixirs is hot on Ponyo's trail. He takes Ponyo back (who he calls Brunhilde) back to the depths, but Ponyo now desires to become human and to be with Sosuke; a desire so strong that she breaks out of Fujimoto's undersea lair that causes the his elixirs to be unleashed on an unsuspecting world that causes a major storm that threatens the island. Fujimoto seeks out the aid of Ponyo's mother, a water element dubbed as the Mother of the Sea (voiced by Yuki Amami) to try and put things back to normal before the sea engulfs the surface...

Written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, ""Ponyo"" is a film with a very simple premise that borrows some elements from ""The Little Mermaid"". As with Miyazaki's past films, the film has strong messages about ecology and environmentalism that focuses on the well-being of the world's oceans. The opening scene with all the pollution, debris and garbage in the ocean makes a very strong commentary, these sequences give justification as to why Fujimoto would leave the life of a surface dweller. Fujimoto has taken it upon himself to try to repair the damage this has caused, but all appears to be fruitless as the oceans are damaged faster than he could anticipate. Some of the environmental messages may appear too heavy-handed but Miyazaki is a master of fantasy-storytelling and he manages to overcome the film's flaws.

The film's central focus falls on the friendship between Sosuke and Ponyo. Sosuke exhibits this optimistic innocence that is just so full of life. Ponyo as the sea sprite is just so cute and adorable.
I admit to a certain extent, that the film does take its time getting to its goals. However, the first half is also full of charm, warmth and endearing scenes that would please any viewer of any age. Once Ponyo reverts to a human however, the film gets into gear as the viewer is treated to an animated visual marvel that is quite refreshing to see in these days dominated by CGI animation. Seeing a colorful, great visual achievement using traditional cell animation is so cool to look at, Miyazaki still proves that one doesn't need CGI to deliver a good animated film. Miyazaki has the eye to deliver something truly fantastic as well as bizarre and outrageous; Miyazaki intentionally made the drawings to resemble the use of crayons and pencils to make them superbly reflective of a child's imagination. The animation work is truly charming that retains the look of a kid's coloring book given life and motion. The animation work by Katsuma Kondo is excellent for the film's tone.

Child actors Nara Yuria and Doi Hiroki do magnificent work as Ponyo and Sosuke. I will NOT give credit to the English voice cast by Disney at all, since I saw this in its original form. Anime is meant to be seen in Japanese, English dubbed work is often abysmal. Nara Yuria is magnificent as Ponyo. Her voice portrayal fits the infantile charm and wit exhibited by her animated counterpart. She sounds so cute and adorable on some scenes, it comes as no surprise that Doi Hiroki would fall for the magical sea sprite turned human. Tomoko Yamaguchi is also awesome as Sosuke's mom. Tomoko is a model and I could just feel her `vibe' as her youthful, energetic young woman. I was a little confused as to why Sosuke kept on referring to her as Lisa instead of mom, but perhaps this is just a reflection on the more modern Japanese family. Comedian Joji Tokoro is great as Fujimoto. His character is full of weird potential but sadly, Miyazaki doesn't really flesh his character out more thoroughly. I would have loved to see more of the relationships between Sosuke and his father as well as more of Fujimoto's background. Everything did feel like they had to take a back seat in favor of the visuals. I also would have liked more undersea world detail as rendered by Miyazaki.

In this world, Ponyo represents the oceans and Sosuke represents the surface world. There are some parallels to the friendship between the two to the relationship between Fujimoto and the Mother of the Sea. Miyazaki seems to be giving the viewer that for the world to succeed, man and his environment need to work in unison. Man needs to respect and love his environment for what it is, and not change anything for his own selfish motives. Love, sincerity and compassion are needed to save the planet.

Miyazaki Hayao's ""Ponyo"" is a little light in the dramatic areas and ends up better as an adventure `exploration' film than an actual undersea journey. It will not match ""Princess Mononoke"" and ""Spirited Away"" in raw brilliance. The film does suffer a bit within the limits it imposed on itself, Miyazaki's talent still shines through and I hope that this isn`t his last film. Miyazaki has crafted another modern fairy tale that can be appreciated by the young and old alike. It is a timeless story of friendship, love and adventure that exhibit's an endearing warmth that cannot be soon forgotten.

1129815,5,7799127775,"Hayao Miyazaki is one of those rare directors who can take the magic of nature and childhood, then somehow capture it for the screen.

And his tenth Ghibli movie ""Ponyo"" is no exception -- it's a reimagined tale of a ""little mermaid"" who wants to become human so she can be with a little human boy she loves. It's a simple story told in a simple manner (occasionally TOO simple), but it has a lush oceanic beauty and an innocent sweetness that really capture your heart and imagination.

A little boy named Sosuke finds a tiny ""goldfish"" with a human face on a beach, trapped in a bottle. He names her Ponyo, and goes to great lengths to care for his little fishy friend.

But then the sea wizard Fujimoto, Ponyo's overprotective dad, appears and snatches Ponyo back into the sea -- and she decides that she wants to become human so she can be with Sosuke. Having tasted a bit of Sosuke's blood, she sprouts chickenleggy limbs and starts to change, but inadvertently disrupts a magical well that causes the moon to drop, the seas to rise over the land, and prehistoric magic to rise once more.

Sosuke and Ponyo are delighted to be reunited, despite the raging storm that is engulfing the city and causing ships to go missing. While the children go searching for Sosuke's missing mother, Fujimoto struggles to fix the balance of nature before the entire world is destroyed, with the help of Ponyo's sea goddess mother. The only hope of restoring balance lies in Ponyo and Sosuke -- and if Sosuke's love is not true, then Ponyo will be reduced to sea foam.

Compared to Miyazaki's other movies, ""Ponyo"" is a very simple story -- it's basically a boy-meets-fishgirl story, with lots of children running around being adorable and exquisite looks at the sea. Even its theme is simple -- the story is dependent on on true selfless love and how it knows no boundaries of age, experience or even species. Not to mention parents letting go of their children.

If there's a downside to the story, it's the lack of internal conflict. Example: the ""test"" that Fujimoto and the sea goddess use for Sosuke... well, it's far less impressive than it seems.

Oddly enough, making the transition from The Shining and Full Metal Jacket to Ponyo was not as abrupt a break as one might imagine. This movie is lighthearted and fun unlike the aforementioned films, but like those films this production very much demonstrates a dedication to creating powerful visuals and emotion at the expense of 'realism' and traditional narrative; a trait that both Stanley Kubrick and Miyazaki have in common.

--- Note: Spoilers Abound Beyond This Point ---

This is a basic boy meets girl story- or at least the fairytale version of one- complete with the inevitable happy ending. Ponyo is a magical fish-girl who runs away from her idealistic and tyrannical father, a powerful wizard who lives in the sea. She is found by a five-year-old boy named Sasuke who makes a literal blood-bond with her; Sasuke first makes her his pet, and after she learns to speak with him he embraces her as his friend. Sasuke's mother accepts Ponyo into her home first as Sasuke's magical pet, and when she returns to Sakuke after being abducted by her father, she accepts responsibility for Ponyo transformed into a little girl just as easily. After a test of love (arranged by Ponyo's mother, who is some form of sea goddess), Ponyo is fully transformed into a human, and Ponyo and Sasuke grow up together (presumably) happily ever after. The End.

From what I can see, the main criticism of this film has been that the story frankly does not make much sense, at least when one gets to the fine details of the tale. This seems to me to be a fair point; I myself could not make heads of tails of the story from any logical perspective. Ponyo's father, the alchemist who lives in the sea is introduced and exits without any real background explanation; the sea goddess appears and explains that 'we all come from sea foam'- and although this is demonstrated visually, the mechanism by which these creatures are transformed otherwise is left to the viewers imagination. Ponyo somehow triggers an ecological cataclysm/new epoch/renaissance where the moon draws in close, the sea levels rise, and prehistoric sea life appears (?) - and once again, no satisfactory reason for all of this is provided, or even hinted at. If this was a science-fiction story, I would have to call it a complete failure.

But this is not science-fiction, or even traditional fantasy; this is a fairy tale, this is mythology, and Miyazaki's mostly visual narrative makes this clear with the bold confidence of a veteran filmmaker throughout. The true magic of this movie is that while the plot itself might be full of holes as wide as the ocean, the characters feel believable and human throughout. Sasuke's mother in particular is a well-written and attractive character, and her relationship with Sasuke's absentee father shows the strains of a real marriage without ever lapsing into melodrama. There is as much here for the adults as the kids, and Miyazaki balances the adult and child perspectives with an even hand.

Complaints about the film's visuals are, from my perspective, fully unfounded. This is a gorgeous, gorgeous film, and is a stunning example of what 2-D animation can do that no other medium can master. The visual narrative that Miyazaki has built his career around- the narrative of transformation- is fully explored here, even more so than in Howl's Moving Castle, which seemed to take this concept to the logical limit at the time.

In this movie, however, transformations are taken beyond any logical limit and into the logic of dreams or that of the spiritual world, or the world of magic; and in the final analysis these are all the same thing. From the beginning the sea itself is presented as a character, as a living thing - it is even animated in the same bright, flat cel-colors that the other characters are (look at the water in Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke for a counter-example to this style). The first time we are shown the painterly landscapes surrounded by the cartoon sea this fact is made immediately clear, at least to those familiar with the language of traditional animation.

In short, in absence of much in the way of traditional narrative the visuals themselves are called upon to tell the story, and the story they tell 'works'; and it works quite well on an emotional, pre-conscious level. Water transforms into fish, and the fish into waves, and back again; Ponyo herself shifts between forms seemingly at will. What makes the human characters human in this film seems to be that they are fixed to a single form. The narrative truths of the story are all there, but folded fully into the visuals rather than exposition.

Now, one shouldn't walk away from this review thinking that this is somehow the animated equivalent of a Fellini film. Miyazaki himself stated that he made the movie for a five-year-old child, and the strong reliance on visuals to tell the story, along with the emphasis of emotional over objective truths should be understood with this goal in mind. But unlike most entertainment made for small children the objective seems to be to expand the mind rather than pander to a limited understanding; to appeal to the nobler instincts rather than the base. But like mentioned earlier, there is much to appreciate here for viewers of all ages.

In summary, I believe this movie to be a masterwork, rather than a 'lesser' Miyazaki film. I frankly do not think that he could have even pulled something like this off in the 80's when Studio Ghibli was first founded; the absolute boldness and even-handedness of this ambitious work is something that only a mature director could achieve. Again, it's designed for younger viewers than something like Princess Mononoke or even Spirited Away, and this should be understood upon viewing it. But this is a film that clearly achieves every goal that the filmmaker set out to reach, and it does so in a lyrical, beautifully poetic style.

If this truly is the last film that Miyazaki directs (a tune he has sung many a time before...), this will remain as much a testimony to his vision as any of his other creations.

Highly recommended.",1252195200,,6316,4.7897153351698805
1129823,3,7799127775,"[FOREWORD: Boy, did I have an amusing theatrical experience.  When I was going to the theater to see this film, I went inside the auditorium, and there were actually children watching an anime movie for once. I must say it's rather appropriate, but at the same time, I then had to deal with their constant whining and begging for mom's milk during the film's important scenes.  Truthfully, they didn't bother me too much as their distractions didn't ruin my movie experience in any way.]

Oh, Miyazaki.  You never let me down...until now, but only a bit.  A slight bit, a minute splinter under my skin...yet it still bothers me.  When I read about ""Ponyo"", the next Studio Ghibli project, I wasn't too impressed.  The film didn't look like it'll rekindle the flame that Miyazaki's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/award-winning-film/dp/B00005JLEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">award-winning film</a>&nbsp;sparked, and its sole objective is to appeal to the general audience; to Disney's marketing-focus credit, the film did manage to do okay in the U.S. box office.  My admiration for the director usually does away with my negative first impressions, so I watched ""Ponyo"" with my mind as clear as the open sky.

The story is an amalgamation of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/certain/dp/014036708X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">certain</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/fairy/dp/0698400011/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">fairy</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/tales/dp/0794519172/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">tales</a>&nbsp;with a touch of ""An Inconvenient Truth.""  It's straightforward: boy meets girl fish, girl fish loves boy, girl fish wants to be human like boy, girl fish becomes human, then the ocean ecosystem is disrupted, causing damage beyond geological proportions due to the actions of girl fish.  A simple tale, indeed.  Usually, the premise screams out thrills, suspense, and a compelling adventure, but color me surprised because the movie doesn't have any; it has the adventure part, but it wasn't all that exciting which sadly reinforces my initial impressions.

Although I try my best to suspend disbelief, I did unsuspend when the human characters aren't so bothered by the unusual chain of events.  Sosuke, the male lead, I can believe due to his youth and innocence, but his mother seems all too humble about the sight of a goldfish WITH A HUMAN FACE AND EATS HAM IN ONE BITE; I don't know about her, but I would be amazed by that.  The rest of villagers acted the same way (not just for the fish), in fact, the only character I can identify with is the cranky old lady because even she notices something is wrong with this whole thing.

Ponyo herself is an intriguing character, though.  Although the US trailers did their very poorest to hide her human form (the trailers for ""The Last Unicorn"" and even ""Shrek II"" kept that surprise hidden), when she became one, she possesses magic that does unusual things: she can make things five times its size, she can cure the sick by rubbing her face on their faces, not to mention she can control the ocean if she likes.  She's a flipping miracle worker, a divine creature whom I am totally not comparing to certain&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/religious/dp/B00028HBIO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">religious</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/figures/dp/0792154649/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">figures</a>.  Conversely, her mother, The Goddess of the Sea, provides no significant purpose for the whole film.  She was mentioned as a serious threat, but all she did was play a beautiful spectator.  Another thing, if she's the Goddess of the Sea, why didn't she stop that tsunami her daughter is causing?  What, was she wasting time at home watching Grey's Anatomy or the show's equivalent in Japan?

I'm aware this isn't the type of Ghibli film that would tug my heartstrings with the characters' obstacles for them to walk the path of self-worth.  This is a lighter film, something for everyone who's afraid of a little danger.  There were previous Ghibli films that were also light in tone, but this film neither has the obstruction of ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" nor the wonder of ""My Neighbor Totoro.""  There was a lot of magic, but not a lot of mystery; the movie constantly shows off on its vibrant displays that there's no subtlety.  Some circumstances, such as the elixir scene and the caution about the moon falling, were abruptly told just to keep the momentum.

Personally, these young leads didn't really learn anything from their experience.  Ponyo's wizard of a father said Sosuke must overcome a challenge to test his love for Ponyo, but I don't know what challenge it is; all I saw was those two walking in a tunnel.  Finally, there was the climax which was really a simple ""yes or no"" question, something the kid could've answered 30 minutes ago because he sure he didn't act any different than he was at this point.  Also, outside of the scene where Sosuke's mom acts like a proper parent and drive flooded roads during a heavy tsunami with her son unbuckled (mother of the year), the film lack any kind of tension as the film rather sails away for a good second-half, literally.  I know this is a G-rated movie, but come on, at least startle me a bit.

To its merit, ""Ponyo"" is amazing to look at; the use of watercolors is simply exquisite, so kids are going to like what they see.  However, I don't praise a film for looks like I used to.  Sometimes, I want something more from my film than just how it dresses itself.  The story isn't enlightening to grab my attention, the characters weren't interesting to grow attached to them, and I felt indifferent about the marvels it showed.  Even as an animated film by Hayao Miyazaki, I can't give it a free pass.

By the way, Disney. That Ponyo theme remix...shame on you.",1251676800,14,6053,5.454935622317596
1129824,5,7799127775,"My son CJ is almost 3, and I have been waiting for that *perfect* movie to take him to.  Today, we went to Ponyo.

Ponyo is delightfully drawn.  I had read a review on another site that said it looked ""old fashioned"".  Not everything is Pixar; not everything needs to be.  It was nice to see an animated film that was illustrated similarly to animated films of my childhood.

Ponyo held CJ's attention for (almost) the whole movie.  He loved all the fish.  Some elements have the potential to be scary for some children, however (but really, what Disney movie doesn't have scary elements?).

I give it a 5, and CJ says, ""Ponyo, again?  More movie?"" so I think he would give it a 5, too!! :)",1250899200,7,690,4.362204724409449

1129911,4,7799127775,"Miyazaki has done it again: created a charming and engaginge animation, one with a spirit all its own. Fans will recognize elements from his earlier efforts, including his passion for biomorphic flying machines (flying through water this time, but still) and strong little girl in the leading role. It also presents something of an eco-fable, with seas rising as they threaten to do in our real, warming world. But, as in Miyazaki's previous films, even familiar elements combine to make a unique story.

""Ponyo"" has been likened to Hans Christian Andersen's ""Little Mermaid,"" probably by people who remember only the disneyfied version of the story. Yes, the water-girl loves the boy of dry land. This story, however offers a lighter spirit and happier ending than the dour Nordic tale. It also blends in, perhaps, a scrap of ""Sorcerer's Apprentice"" and possibly others. That hardly makes this a derivative work, however. The plot as a whole, along with the imagery that carries it, comes across as fresh despite its familiar elements.

Although adults can enjoy Miyazaki's animations at many levels, he intends them for kids, too. This time, the target age appears to be five or so, the age of the boy (Sosuke) who costars in this feature. As such, the mood stays lighter than in some of Miyazaki's other films, and there's a big kid-power message as well. His light touch keeps the serious issues from becoming grim, though. This is an entertainment before anything else. Although not as striking as Princess Mononoke or Spirited away, it certainly entertains.

1129912,5,7799127775,"It has been widely agreed that Hayao Miyazaki is a master at his craft when it comes to combining rich animation with thoughtful story lines and similarly imaginative characters. His movies, from NAUSICAA, TOTORO, KIKI, LAPUTA, and MONONOKE to the recent HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE are all not only gorgeously rendered in terms of art, but in terms of movie-making as well. Can this man do no wrong? Not really, but it is impossible to expect everyone of his movies to always be five star marvels. His newest film, PONYO, an unashamedly family-friendly tale of a ""goldfish out of water"", is as lushly animated and alive with interesting characters as you would expect... and yet this is the first film of his which treads into ""lesser"" territory. Don't get me wrong, PONYO is not a bad movie by any means. As mentioned, it is a sight for the eyes and is as charming and adorable as TOTORO and KIKI. The problem is that the story doesn't stay afloat to satisfy anyone eager for another engrossing, in-depth plot.

For its opening hour, PONYO is Miyazaki storytelling at its finest, in which a rowdy and overeager young goldfish (who later becomes named Ponyo) makes a forbidden trip to the human world where she is subsequently adopted by a boy her own age named Sosuke (modeled, interestingly, after the director's own son). This does not please Ponyo's father, a mysterious wizard named Fujimoto, who is very angry at the humans for their destruction of the sea (this environmentalist theme is not much different from Miyazaki's other films)... a problem he very much intends to rectify by creating jellyfish from the prow of his submarine. He separates the pair and tries to talk Ponyo into staying underwater with him. The goldfish, however, has already tasted both Sosuke's blood (healing a cut on his finger) AND some of the human food (ham, which she becomes inexplicably addicted to), and of course steals into her father's forbidden potions, transforming into a hyperactive young girl (who is the spitting image of Mei from MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO). This triggers a dangerous tsunami which threatens to engulf the entire world with water. Conspiring with his wife, Gran Mamare, a diaphanous sea goddess who alternatingly shifts from super-sized titan to human-size form, Fujimoto decides to test the two youngsters' love for each other. They do this by elevating the sea to the level of Sosuke's house, prompting the youngsters to set out across their now ocean-infested world in an over-sized toy-boat (made possible by Ponyo's own magical powers).

It is at this point where PONYO begins to run out of steam. Although Ponyo and Sosuke are adorable and the scenes involving them are funny and cute, they slow down the film. Where the film really takes on water, unfortunately, is at the climax in which Sosuke must prove his love to Ponyo, presented in a way which is strangely anticlimactic and rushed, bringing an otherwise charming tale to an abrupt halt. This will likely underwhelm viewers expecting another instant masterpiece from the man who has delivered far more interesting finales for many of his other movies. Remember the destruction of Laputa? Satsuki's search for little Mei? Kiki's rescue of Tombo? Porco Rosso's fight with Curtis? The rescue of the Forest Spirit's head? Or even the test between Chihiro and Yubaba? All those resolutions were far more satisfying and felt more complete than this one.

On a technical level, PONYO cannot be faulted. The animation is absolutely gorgeous to look at, produced entirely without a single shot of computer-generated-imagery, and naturally Joe Hisaishi provides us with yet another breathtaking musical score; the best moments being the rousing sequences underwater, accompanied by a chorus and a soprano voice. And the backgrounds are lovingly painted and detailed as any other Ghibli movies.

Having proved themselves worthy on translating and dubbing Ghibli's previous movies into English with top-quality results, Disney Studios and Pixar once again provide an English dub complete with a mostly capable cast of actors. Frankie Jonas is surprisingly good as Sosuke, sounding very natural and believable throughout. Noah Cyrus as Ponyo, on the other hand, sometimes goes overboard in shouting her lines before eventually settling down toward the end. Leads aside, the rest of the cast includes Liam Neeson as the overprotective Fujimoto (who manages himself unsurprisingly well in the character), Cate Blanchett as Gran Mamare (in an omnipresent tone which is not much different from her Galadriel in LORD OF THE RINGS), Matt Damon as Sosuke's constantly seafaring father Koichi (who is good but nothing to write home about), and Tina Fey as Lisa. Of them, Fey is the best voice in the entire cast, imbuing the character with just the right amount of spirit and personality. Her scenes with Sosuke show real chemistry. On the other hand, Cloris Leachman, who was spectacular as Dola in CASTLE IN THE SKY, is disappointingly wasted as one of three handicapped elderly women (she barely has ANY lines!), who are also voiced by Betty White and Lily Tomlin. Of them, only Tomlin's character, a cantankerous woman named Toki, shows any real personality, but if I were casting the movie, I'd switch Tomlin with Leachman. Probably the only really jarring drawback of the dub is a blasty techno-remix of the film's catchy (but ridiculously repetitive) title song, which thankfully doesn't occur until midway through the closing credits.

On the whole, PONYO is a good film; a fine piece of animated work which is perfect for youngsters and family audiences. Due to the loss of momentum toward the end, though, it falls far short of classic status. Since Miyazaki at his least is still better than a majority of other animated films, though, I'll be generous and give PONYO a full star recommendation, because any feature of his is still very much worth watching.  And of course, Disney gives it a superlative DVD edition complete with an impeccable visual and sound transfer as well as a huge serving of extras--arguably their largest ever for a Ghibli title.",1250467200,,6113,5.041543026706232
1129913,5,7799127775,"I have been waiting for this movie to come to the US for literally years, and so on opening weekend, I did something I rarely do...I went to the movies.
For those who are familiar with Miyazaki's other movies, this is one of his environmental/nature movies, focusing on polluted oceans and maintaining the balance of the world. I was a little disappointed to see the lack of a flying-motif that he has in all his other movies, but I guess that's a little too much to expect from a movie that takes place half the time under water or in boats.
There have been many to criticize that the art was not up to the usual Miyazaki level. Well, do these same people know that this ENTIRE MOVIE WAS DRAWN BY HAND? That's right, not a spec of computer generation for even clean-up or shading. It shows a lot in the ocean waves during the storm, which in a past movie would have been left to a computer, were made with standard pen and ink. Now while people are complaining that it made the art look messy and rudimentary, I liked it. It was nostalgic of classic cartoon movies before the computer age and reminded me of Miyazaki's earliest movies. I also think it added to the child-like feel of the movie and in a way made me appreciate how difficult it must have been to create a movie like that.
There have been others that complained there was a lot of build up for Sosuke's test when it ended up being such a small ""anti-climactic"" scene. So what? You say a five-year-old can't know about true love? I say there's no purer, truer love than that of the unconditional love of an innocent mind. It's only as you get older that love gets harder, so naturally it was an easy test for little Sosuke.
And now enough of what others said. For two hours I put aside my analytical mind and simply watched. I loved this movie. It was insanely adorable and sweet: Miyazaki's most sugary movie to date (even sweeter than My Neighbor Totoro, I thought). But I didn't mind the sugary sweetness one bit. I really got into and couldn't stop smiling and laughing the whole time, and when I left the theater I felt good. I'd recommend it to any Miyazaki fan or family movie lover.",1250467200,2,2154,4.3875
1129914,5,7799127775,"Miyazaki's films are refreshing for their even pacing and tempered characters. A far cry from the neurosis of Disney characters where everyone is shouting and riding on high octane. Ponyo is almost completely silent in its first 10 or 15 minutes, and even when the dialoug begins it has more of a sobering effect. If you pair that with the gorgeous hand drawn characters and hand painted backgrounds you suddenly remember what animation felt like twenty-plus years ago.

The story of Ponyo is truly Disney-esque on the surface - but only on the surface. A boy, Sosuke, finds a ""goldfish"" trapped in a jar and frees her. He also gives her the name Ponyo. It doesn't take very long for Ponyo to develop a pet-like affinity for Sosuke, leading her to the decision that she wants to be a human. It's really that simple. The rest is Miyazaki's masterful aptitude for making the plot less important than his signature slice-of life sequences of how people relate to each other and their environment. Watching Ponyo at times feels like people-watching. And, like people watching, it all amounts to a perplexing joy.

It's strangely relaxing to watch his visually vibrant and animated characters bring color to such banalities as eating soup and ham. If you've watched Howl's Moving Castle and the delicious scene of Howl cooking bacon and eggs, then you've seen Miyazaki do this before. The man has an eye for the small details of life. This is not to say that the movie is not forward moving. There are some semblances of Western story telling. For instance, Ponyo's father who is not particularly fond of humans is constantly seeking out Ponyo to bring her back home. However, as dramatic as this may be, it's marginal to the rest of the story. Miyazaki is less interested in the need for conflict and more interested in those unexplainable things that draw two people to each other.",1250467200,72,1878,4.79320987654321
1129915,3,7799127775,"The following was originally posted to the Ponyo Theatrical Release:

First off, let me say that Miyazaki is one of my favorite directors and animators. Kiki's Delivery Service, Spirited Away, Whisper of the Heart are just some of my favorites.

The problem I had is two-fold: 1) The animation was, IMO, sub-par. As another reviewer mentions Miyazaki aimed this movie at 5 year olds, well I'm not letting them have all the fun in what may be his last movie, so 1 ticket please! But I digress, Lisa's character (voiced by Tina Fey) was not well drawn, Look at her body symmetry, specifically her legs, as an example. I've seen art for children and frankly it can be done better or worse, depending on the illustrator. Since I've seen most, if not all his previous work, I guess I was expecting better. The attention to detail found in previous works was missing here. 2) The story was simple enough, again aimed at 5 year olds. But, in addition to being somewhat slow, it begs the question: What value did Sosuke's Dad bring to the story? He could have been left out completely as far as I can tell. Also, compared to Chihiro, I think Sosuke's test was simultaneously anti-climactic and daunting. In order to bring balance to the world's oceans a 5 year old is expected to love someone he has just met? I mean, a test of bravery would have been better, again IMO, to show his true character. I also think the audience might have responded to this a little better. Finally, such a star-studded cast. Wow, talk about wasting talent. I'm sure the fact that Miyazaki's films haven't done well in US theaters might be part of the motivation, and it did work, but unless you are good at picking out voices, most of the characters don't get enough voice time to matter much. Now granted, I didn't go to the movie to hear Cloris Leachman or Lily Tomlin, but I was expecting a little more screen time for Liam Neeson's Dad.

I've been waiting for this movie to hit theaters for a year, and this might be the reason I'm being a little hard on the movie, but Miyazaki is not getting any younger and I'd like to think he plans on going out on a high note.

I know that what I've done is probably equivalent to punching a kitten, and I'm likely to get roasted by my fellow reviewers, but this was not my intention, just my opinion, so spare me the righteous indignation please. BTW, my 9 year old daughter loved the movie and wants to see it again.",1250467200,6,2434,4.45067264573991
1129916,4,7799127775,"I adore Hayao Miyazaki and his animated films. I feel his films are geared both to children and adults. I love how Hayao has stuck to his guns and continued with the traditional hand drawn animation in this day and age of computer generated images. His latest film is PONYO. I just caught a viewing of the film. Unfortunately the version I saw was the english dubbed version but I guess that was intended to attract a larger audience. Small children probably wouldn't want to deal with subtitles.

Anyhoo...the story of PONYO is pretty simple. Ponyo (Noah Cyrus, Miley's younger sister) is a goldfish who wants to become human after she meets Sosuke (Frankie Jonas) and becomes his friend. The basic friendship theme of the film reminded me a bit like another Miyazaki film MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO. It is pretty obvious the audience Miyazaki was aiming for at the younger crowd but I saw plenty of adults without children at the theater I was at. As an adult, I loved the film. Sometimes it is good that a film isn't so heavy handed in subject matter like pollution like in Miyazaki's earlier films. Normally I prefer the Japanese version to the english version in Miyazaki's films but I honestly didn't mind it this time around except for Noah Cyrus who frankly is only famous because of her (no talent) father and older sister. I enjoyed the rest of the cast which includes Tina Fey, Liam Neeson, Betty White, Lily Tomlin, and Cloris Leachman.

The only thing I really didn't care for about the film was the ending. The ending definitely could have been better. All in all though, the film was thoroughly entertaining. Hayao Miyazaki did not disappoint me with his latest cinematic offering.",1250294400,,1688,4.738095238095238
1129917,4,7799127775,"From Hayao Miyazaki, the master of Japanese animation, comes a story similar to The Little Mermaid, where a small and ever-so-cute fish-like female becomes infatuated with a land dwelling male, and moves heaven and earth, and a lot of ocean to try to make her dream come true.

Short attention span summary (SASS):

1. Fish girl lives with her father and siblings in an aquarium-like home inside a really cool submarine with flippers.
2. Headstrong and clever, she sneaks out to see the surface, and encounters the debris of human civilization, immediately getting into trouble.
3. She is rescued by a young boy, and a strong bond is forged between the two.
4. Daddy comes to the rescue to save his kidnapped child
5. ... but finds that girls just wanna have fun
6. Everything goes topsy-turvy until her mother shows up

Ponyo is a wonderfully entertaining movie for young children, and although not as strong in plot as Miyazaki's other movies like Princess Mononoke or Howl's Moving Castle, the animation is excellent, and the story will touch your heart.

There is no shortage of voice talent, with Noah Cyrus (Miley's little sister) as Ponyo, Frankie (the bonus) Jonas as her friend Sosuke, and also Tina Fey, Matt Damon, Liam Neeson, Cate Blanchett, Cloris Leachman, Betty White and Lily Tomlin.

This is one to see with the entire family, but falls just short of perfect with a few too many inexplicable elements.  Recommended for the fantastic animation, simple plot, characters and ecological message, and very strongly recommended for families with young children.

1129918,4,7799127775,"Ponyo is a young fish-girl who loves to explore, but her father, a great wizard of the sea, fears the chaos her untamed powers could unleash upon the world.  He's right to worry, since she, like every young undomesticated child, is an elemental force of nature who has little respect for the boundaries that grownups take so seriously.  She escapes and meets up with a young boy whose imagination at least is a match for her magical powers - and it is love at first sight.  Not romantic love but something more innocent and pure - like the youthful love of nature.

It starts out strong - and contains some of Miyazaki's most delightful and exuberant imagery, as when Ponyo runs blissfully upon the backs of her sisters who are at once giant fish and enormous waves.  The story itself as it develops has gaps, moments that don't all add up, and unexplained elements.  As another reviewer mentioned, for example, the test that Fujimoto and the sea goddess devise for Sosuke is somewhat anticlimactic, unlike the tests faced by the heroine of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spirited-Away/dp/B00005JLEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spirited Away</a>.  I had the suspicion several times that perhaps Disney cut things out for its U.S. release - since the plot lacked some of the depth and richness in its backstory of many of Miyazaki's other works.  A bit of searching shows I was wrong - this is the film Hayao Miyazaki intended.  He is quoted in the L.A. Daily News as saying: ""I intentionally tried to simplify things for this film. I figured that this movie should be seen by 5-year-olds, since they are the main characters. So I made the storytelling easy to understand. I figured they could watch it later as adults and understand the more complex parts of it, so I didn't foreground those elements.""  In hindsight he may be right -- from a young person's perspective what matters is just the magical relation between two young children, and from their perspective everything else, the fate of the cosmos, even, hinges on that.

Like most of his films, there is an ecological message here, that humans tend to ignore the wonders around them and treat carelessly the gift of the earth.  Here it is expressed in an entertaining and magical story that will be easily understood by children.  While, from the perspective of an adult viewer, I found this film less fully satisfying than masterpieces like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spirited-Away/dp/B00005JLEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spirited Away</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Princess-Mononoke/dp/B00003CXBK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Princess Mononoke</a>, or even the delicate and rich&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Neighbor-Totoro/dp/B0001XAQ0A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Neighbor Totoro</a>&nbsp;- which is the closest in spirit to this film - still it contains some remarkable and beautiful imagery and delightful moments.  Well worth watching, and a very lovely and simple introduction to the work of one of the most inventive and important animated storytellers alive.  There's no one else quite like him, and we're lucky to have another Miyazaki film, especially given his initial plans to retire upon completing the Academy Award-winning&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spirited-Away/dp/B00005JLEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spirited Away</a>.

1129919,5,7799127775,"Hayao Miyazaki is one of those rare directors who can take the magic of nature and childhood, then somehow capture it for the screen.

And his tenth Ghibli movie ""Ponyo"" is no exception -- it's a reimagined tale of a ""little mermaid"" who wants to become human so she can be with a little human boy she loves. It's a simple story told in a simple manner (occasionally TOO simple), but it has a lush oceanic beauty and an innocent sweetness that really capture your heart and imagination.

A little boy named Sosuke finds a tiny ""goldfish"" with a human face on a beach, trapped in a bottle. He names her Ponyo, and goes to great lengths to care for his little fishy friend.

But then the sea wizard Fujimoto, Ponyo's overprotective dad, appears and snatches Ponyo back into the sea -- and she decides that she wants to become human so she can be with Sosuke. Having tasted a bit of Sosuke's blood, she sprouts chickenleggy limbs and starts to change, but inadvertently disrupts a magical well that causes the moon to drop, the seas to rise over the land, and prehistoric magic to rise once more.

Sosuke and Ponyo are delighted to be reunited, despite the raging storm that is engulfing the city and causing ships to go missing. While the children go searching for Sosuke's missing mother, Fujimoto struggles to fix the balance of nature before the entire world is destroyed, with the help of Ponyo's sea goddess mother. The only hope of restoring balance lies in Ponyo and Sosuke -- and if Sosuke's love is not true, then Ponyo will be reduced to sea foam.

Compared to Miyazaki's other movies, ""Ponyo"" is a very simple story -- it's basically a boy-meets-fishgirl story, with lots of children running around being adorable (""He HATES humans and he put me in a BUBBLE!""). Even its theme is simple -- the story is dependent on on true selfless love and how it knows no boundaries of age, experience or even species. Not to mention parents letting go of their children.

If there's a downside to the story, it's the lack of internal conflict. Example: the ""test"" that Fujimoto and the sea goddess use for Sosuke... well, it's far less impressive than it seems.

And Miyazaki does not disappoint animationwise -- he conjures a waterworld of luminous sea life, sparkling ships, prehistoric creatures, finned submarines and a town that has been swallowed by the sea (complete with boats floating over the rooftops). It's an exquisite piece of work that turns the ocean into a magical, otherworldly realm where wizards work in coral-encrusted towers and shimmering jellyfish take little mermaids to the surface.

Ponyo herself provides a lot of the movie's charm -- she's effusive, hyperactive, has a babylike fascination with the human world (""HAM!""), and an array of handy magical powers. Sosuke is a likable lad who is fascinated by Ponyo and her world, and Fujimoto makes a enjoyable anti-hero -- spindly, gaunt and with a mane of messy red hair, he's like a rock'n'roll embodiment of parental stress.

As for the voice actors, most of them do a brilliant job. Noah Cyrus and Frankie Jonas do a decent though not outstanding job as the lead characters, but they are easily outstripped by a harried-sounding Liam Neeson, loving Tina Fey, and smooth, lulling Cate Blanchett as a trio of worried parents who deeply love their children (whether human or fish).

""Ponyo"" is simpler and more childlike fare than most of Miyazaki's past films, but it's still a sweet and lushly-animated piece of work. At the very least, it will transport you to a magical childhood.",1250208000,,3556,4.776872964169381
