8100244,4,B000CQBMGI,"It's a wonderful piece, and way ahead of its time. The DVD transfer is razor sharp and the Bluray even better. Watching it again after so long I was taken with how touching it is - everyone in this film is pretending to be what they're not. The entire cast is great but Beryl Reid, who wasn't always this good, is brilliant in this. It's hilarious. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is Georgie Fame's awful music score. But don't let that put you off. It's a classic, black, British comedy drama.",1521849600,,506,4.336842105263158

8100247,4,B000CQBMGI,"Joe Orton's play was not well received on its first NY run lasting about 13 performances.  I think the audience may not have known what to do with it.  Orton loved to expose what he saw as the hypocrisies of 'polite society' and such revered institutions as the Catholic Church by writing dialogue that is respectable on the surface but at the same time exposes what is being covered up; often to hilarious effect.  There are been a few revivals of the play in NY with better success.  When the movie played here it played at the Fine Arts Theatre which is now the Catholic Chapel of Faith, Hope and Charity.  Orton would love that.  When Andy Warhol saw it he was so astonished he told everyone around him it was the most decadent thing he had ever seen.  Poor Andy, he was more familiar with the contours of cookie jars than the English language.  Recently there was a revival here of Loot which was Orton's first success.  Seeing it was a reminder of how much fun Orton's Alice in Wonderland world can be.  The film of Entertaining Mr Sloane gets the style and tone right but the rhythms are sometimes a little off.  Having the house in the middle of a cemetery instead of a garbage dump I think is a mistake because it takes away a point Orton wanted to make with his dialogue.  The cast works brilliantly dumping out Orton's acid laced platitudes in a way that allows the sub text to ring out crystal clear.  Good job all.",1423612800,,1427,4.400763358778626
8100248,3,B000CQBMGI,"THis is a classic play written by Joe Orton. There is something pretentious about this production, having Mr Sloan discovered sunbathing in a cemetary, instead of being introduced in the house. The three people who live in the house hold are excellent. but the actor playing Mr Sloan is like a fey dyed blond version of Terence Stamp. I found his charisma extremely lacking, and wonder why they didn't hire Malcolm McDowell for this part, as he played it on stage. He would have given the earthy sexual tension needed for this part. Otherwise it's entertaining. The actor playing the brother is outstanding, as is his sister. The VHS version is aged in quality.",1298332800,,661,4.807017543859649
8100249,4,B000CQBMGI,Watch 'Prick Up Your Ears' for Joe's sad story.  A contemporary tale set in the swinging 60's London.  Before the policially correct 1990's stiffled creativity.  Great cast. Beryl Reid is fabulous.,1286323200,4,197,5.290322580645161

8100251,5,B000CQBMGI,"This film was based on the very popular play by Joe Orton and although it shows it's age with the fashions, cars, etc., it certainly stands the test of time.  A brilliant film whose ending must have been quite shocking for it's day.  The casting is pure genius in this story of a young man who uses his sexuality and any other means at his disposal to get what he wants - the easy life.  We first meet Mr. Sloane as Kath (a curvy matron played brillantly by Beryl Reid) flirts with him and decides to offer him a place to stay.  Mr. Sloane is not welcomed into her odd little family.  Her eccentric father recognizes him from a crime committed years ago and her in-the-closet brother is not amused by Kath's new plaything.  We watch the tension build as Mr. Sloan manipulates his way into a situation that does not go quite the way he plans.  Creepy film that I highly recommend.",1178841600,8,879,4.355828220858895
