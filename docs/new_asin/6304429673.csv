868821,3,6304429673,A good dvd but very little action. A typical Gregory Peck acting. A bit boring at times.,1426118400,,88,4.235294117647059

868827,5,6304429673,A good movie for the family to watch.  Gregory Peck is a wonderful actor in all of his movies.  This movie is a big plus in my library.  I highly recommend it.,1400889600,,159,3.90625
868828,3,6304429673,Peck at his best and that is saying a lot.  A crusty performance by a major star at the end of his career.,1397865600,,106,3.608695652173913
868829,3,6304429673,This was a different kind of western. I liked the efforts of all the actors however unplausable the story might be.,1395705600,,115,4.523809523809524
868830,5,6304429673,Gregory Peck delivers another great performance as an aging Englishman turned outlaw cowboy and now applying his trade in the wild west of the late 1800s.,1389830400,,154,4.961538461538462
868922,4,6304429673,I like good old western movies and this one was very good. I have watch a lot of them and I would watch this one again.,1389139200,,119,3.6153846153846154
868923,3,6304429673,Great storyline in this 'western tragedy'. Amazon has a great lineup of westerns. It was worth the watch but not one of those westerns I would necessarily care to see again.,1387584000,,173,4.612903225806452
868924,4,6304429673,"not a great western by any means, but it kept me in my seat.
i had never seen desi arnez in a serious role before and he was actually good.
always loved gregory peck and he didn't disappoint.
i probably won't watch this movie again, but i'm glad i watched it  once.",1379808000,,265,4.096153846153846
868925,5,6304429673,"I was just looking for something to watch one day and stumbled across this one. I loved it. This is a great old western that is now one of my favorites. I am so glad that I ran across it. If your a fan of westerns, watch it. You'll be glad you did.",1367280000,,248,3.69811320754717
868926,5,6304429673,"If you are a Peck lover, this is one of his classics. The feelings shown between Peck & little Desi are wonderfully caught on camera. Peck the older Scottsman with a world of experience & Desi a half-breed looking up too the older man. Film shows
a time of old habits, bigotry & hard life styles.",1361836800,,296,4.303571428571429
868927,4,6304429673,I purchased this DVD at Amazon and as usual it arrived on time and in perfect condition.  I'm always happy with Amazon.  I couldn't find this DVD in any stores but I was sure if it was available Amazon would have it.,1325203200,,216,4.119047619047619
868928,5,6304429673,"I saw this on TV last week, and thought Gregory Peck and young Desi Jr, did a great job, I was surprised, I wasn't aware, Desi Jr. was diverse, this was a different roll, so I was impressed, would love to know what he thinks about it, all these years later. wish it would come on DVD. I would be first in line.",1294617600,,310,3.9365079365079363
868929,5,6304429673,"A lot of western movie fans may not know this Great Western was filmed in Israel, but it was---Great scenic shots, great ""western"" looking country', a great cast, Gregory Peck, Desi Arnaz, Jr., Jack Warden, David Huddleston, etal.----just a great story plot---they don't make many westerns today as good as this one was ! ! !",1265760000,,325,4.821428571428571
868930,2,6304429673,"I watched this clunker on TV a few days ago and was curious about Desi, Jr. and his ability to act. I know next to nothing about how or why this piece of tripe was created squandering the talents of a man like Gregory Peck by putting him up against Desi, Jr., a kid way out of his depth. It is almost impossible to watch as it is a tired and limp Hardy family story maquerading as a western. Suspending belief in a movie was never so hard as the action is ludicrous and the plot stupidity challenges the intellect. Peck grows a real beard and looks tired (Ithought he was saying to himself, ""what am I doing in this turkey of a movie?""), and Desi tries to impersonate Tom Mclaughlin's ""Billy Jack"" (half breed good guy) character without the King Fu. What can I say? I looked for some significance or message in the film and found nothing to stimulate even slightly my waning interest as Desi outwits a bungling sheriff and his Sancho Panza like ""deputy."" Maybe this is an allegorical tale and Peck is Moses leading Billy out of the desert...whatever. Only buy this movie if you are curious about what Desi, Jr. did with his pre-emptive movie career before he hit the skids. Where is he now?",1256860800,,1191,4.393665158371041
868931,5,6304429673,"I love this movie as I am a Gregory Peck fan.  Also, I am a fan of Desi Arnaz.  I love movies about the American Indian so I liked the actors in this movie and the story. It is a VHS and I wish it could be made in DVD.",1243555200,,218,3.34
869011,5,6304429673,This is a great 70's outlaw western starring Gregory Peck and Desi Arnaz Jr. It's a must see!!! Please Put On dvd!!!,1115856000,,116,4.318181818181818

7870594,5,6304429673,"Relatively unknown, first-rate literate western written by Alan Sharp with affinities to his previous classic ULZANA'S RAID. See BILLY, it's special. Tremendous Peck performance assisted by cast.",1490486400,,195,6.2592592592592595

7870599,5,6304429673,"Great western movie with an excellent message! Desi Arnez Jr. Is very good as ""the Breed"", Sian Barbara Allen is perfect as Ester, Gregory Peck is as always, wonderful, Jack Worden is relentless as the Marshall, filmed in Israel, better than most Spagetti westerns ever were, Dawn Little Star, the Indian woman is very good, this movie is not rated as highly as it should be! One of my favorite western movies and I own many.
The plot is actualy very plausible, and the theme is about as good as it gets. The harsh reality of the west, the scenery, the old buffalo Hunter playing Copeland in the tale, all makes for a western with heart. Sian Barbara Allen is quite beautiful and portrayed extremely well!",1454544000,,705,4.603174603174603
