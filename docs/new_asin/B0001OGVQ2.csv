2021841,2,B0001OGVQ2,"I began watching the WWF about the time of WrestleMania II; primarily for the personalities and the interviews.  To me, the matches themselves were always secondary.  Promoters in the entertainment business are continually trying to ride the crest of the popularity wave, and this involves routinely making changes in format in attempts to capture new fans.  Sometimes the changes produce the desired results; and sometimes they don't (see Brian France and NASCAR) and result in the loss of a portion of their already established fan base.  I began to lose interest in the WWF about the time of the Stone Cold Steve Austin era, when there was a shift in the type of ""personality"" that management was looking for in their entertainers.  For a while, I switched to WCW, but as that evolved, I eventually stopped watching altogether. I bought this DVD because of some of the individual personalities on the program, and once I had watched their matches, my interest in the program ended.  Advice:  Check out the lineup of matches; if there are wrestlers there who you enjoy watching--consider buying the DVD.  If you are more interested in the personalities of the Saturday Night Main Event era-- buy one of the WrestleManias from that time period.",1448668800,,1245,4.951923076923077

2021937,4,B0001OGVQ2,"Wrestlemania 20: Where it all begins again, on March 14,2004 you had the dead man return, former drug addict beat a olympic gold medalist and a man's life long dream come true.

We start off with a promo with all of the main eventers and two rising stars( Randy Orton and John Cena) talking to themselves in a empty room about wrestlemania. It did get me pumped for the event and even had a little comedy with Vince, Shane and baby McMahon standing together in a dark room with the tagline being said.

John Cena vs. The United states champion The Big Show
John Cena comes at first and gets a huge pop from the MSG crowd, the ironic thing about this is that a few years later he gets the most heat every night they are in MSG but anyways he cuts a promo making fun of The big Show and the crowd loves every joke he says. The Big Show then comes out he looks pretty pissed by John Cena's words. The Big Show dominates Cena for most of the match, Cnea gets some offense and is able to get the F-U but the Big Show breaks out, Cena becomes frustrated and gets his chain so he can hit The Big Show, the ref stops him and as the ref was getting rid of the chain, Cena gets brass knucks and hits The big Show and gives him another F-U for the 1-2-3. Good way to show off both talent and the right guy went over

Then we get a promo where Eric Bischoff sends John Coachman to find the Undertaker and make sure he Undertaker does not beat Kane since he is from smackdown. This promo was a waste of time, it made no sense if Bischoff wanted to stop The Undertaker why would he send the jobber known as The Coach ? The next promo stars evolution. IT was a good promo for Randy Orton but it was a little too long for this show, it was more like a video package for Rock 'n' Sock connection vs. evolution.

Fatal four way for the world tag team championship
Dudley boys vs. La Resistance vs. Garrison Cade & Mark Jindrak vs. THe world tag-team champions Booker-T & Rob Van Dam
This match was pretty slow and for a fatal four way, I think they could have had bigger stars than Garrison Cade & Mark Jindrak, even though they did a good job, the match was very short, the finish was well down with Booker- T and RVD both hitting their signatures on Rob Conway for the 1-2-3

Next is a promo where that idiot Coach continues to look for The Undertaker, instead he finds four legends having a good time in a closet. I won't give their names but one of them did give birth to a hand.

Christian vs. Chris Jericho
A very good wrestling match with little error. Jericho played a aggressive role since he wanted to avenge Trish Stratus; it would of made more sense if the match was more of a brawl type but these two are not the best of brawlers so that might of made the match into crap. This match ends with Trish coming to the aid of Jericho, Christian tries to attack her but Jericho saves her but by mistake she elbows Jericho and Christian capitalizes with the roll-up and gets the roll-up. AFter that Trish then turns on Jericho. Great heel turn, Great to see Christian in his first serious singles match at wrestlemania, but it's a shame to see Jericho loss at mania for the third time in a row

2 on 3 handicap match
Evolution vs Rock 'n' sock connection
This match showcased everyone's talent and ability. It was cool to see a star from the 80's teamed with 2 stars of the 2000's vs two stars of the 90's. Mick Foley showed he had no ring rust. The Rock and Ric Flair's can you top that competition was quite entertaining. Randy Orton hitting the RKO on Foley and getting the win for the team was the right thing to do.

First Ever Play boy evening gown match
Stacey Keibler & Miss Jackie vs Torrie Wilson & Sable
There wasn't much wrestling in this match but Stacey Keibler looked HOT in pink bra and panties. Torrie Wilson's body was nice but her face looked messed up and I don't really care about Sable and Miss Jackie. Yes this match did not belong on the show but I did not mind it all due to Stacy Keibler

First Ever WWE Cruiserweight Championship open
Chavo Guerrero vs. Jamie Noble vs. Funaki vs. Ultimo Dragon vs. Rey Mysterio vs. Nunzio vs. Tajiri vs. Shannon Moore vs. Billy Kidman
This match had too many people in it, it should of been a fatal four way at most. BUt Billy KIdman had a awesome spot. A guy would do two moves and the other got out, and went on for that until Rey went against and Chavo; it lasted for 3 moves and Rey was robbed at wrestlemania again.

Goldberg vs Brock Lesner
This was the one of the ""big four matches"" that wrestlemania always has and had great build-up and it sucked; No it was worst than ""sucked"" it was crap between Wrestling heroes and December to dismember. They sat around forever starring at each other just to piss off the fans that were booing them due to the fact that they were leaving for B.S reasons. There was barely any selling in this match and every moved looked forced. Even if one of these two are your favorite wrestlers, it's still won't be fun to watch.

Fatal 4 way for the WWE Tag Team Championship
WWE Tag Team Champions Scotty to Hotty & Rikishi vs APA vs. Basham Brothers vs. World's Greatest Tags teams
This match was a little quicker and unlike the last fatal four way, it was four real teams going at it.

Women's Championship match
Women's Champion Victoria vs Molly Holly
With two good wrestlers you thought it would've been a good match but it wasn't at all. The only entertaining to happen was that Jerry ""The KIng"" Lawler mentioned MOlly Holly wearing gammy panties. I do believe that Molly regrets cutting her hair for this boring, unmemorable match.

WWE Championship Match
WWE Champion Eddie Guerrero vs. Kurt Angle
After a underdog win by Eddie Guerrero to win the wwe championship, it was the right thing to go against Kurt Angle. The build-up was awesome and gave Angle plenty of heat and Eddie getting every fan behind him. Every time ANgle put Eddie in the ankle lock, you had the feeling he was going to tap but he didn't and finally Eddie was able to trick Angle into taking Eddie's shoe off and get him in the small package to retain his title.

Kane vs. The Undertaker
After much wait; The Undertaker finally returns to get revenge on his brother for burying him alive, how can the match fail? Well that's what happened, it wasn't Kane or The undertaker's fault, it was the booking. Kane acted like a little girl against Taker and it only went on for nine minutes. Yes months of build up for a nine minute match.

Triple Treat for the World Heavyweight championship
invisable man vs. Shawn Michaels vs. World Heayweight champion Triple H
This match is in my top 5 favorites, there was blood, there was false finishes, there was emotion, it had it everything that makes a 5 star match. Triple H tapping out after years of winning was priceless. Invisable man going through the table was a awesome spot. This was the right way to in the 20th wrestlemania

My closing thoughts on the show: Only two out of 4 of the ""big four matches"" delivered however they were great unforgettable matches that helped the show a lot. Besides the mid card titles matches, all of the raw matches were good to great. Besides the WWE championship match, all of the smackdown matches were forgettable. The commentators did well. The 5th match to the 9th match, was a boring time of the show that dragged on for far to long, but the other matches made you forgive the show for those dull matches

Overall I give Wrestlemania 20 a show percentage of 51%

Overall I give Wrestlemania 20",1363392000,,7543,4.341376863023421

Disc 1

-United States Championship Match: Big Show (Champion) vs. John Cena: Show had held the U.S. title for about 5 months and no one had been able to stop him up to this point. Actually for most of the match Show just dominates Cena, chopping and slamming him. Cena does make a comeback even hitting an FU but Show kicks out. Cena then hits Show with his chain and hits a second FU and makes the cover to win the U.S. title. 6/10.

-Coach is in Eric Bischoff's office and Eric tells him to go look for the Undertaker. Coach understandably doesn't look too pleased about it.

-Randy Orton, Ric Flair and Batista talk about their upcoming handicap match where they say they'll take out Foley and Rock.

-Fatal Four Way Match for the World Tag Team Championship: RVD & Booker T (Champions) vs. The Dudley Boyz vs. Garrison Cade & Mark Jindrak vs. La Resistance: Not a bad fatal four way, but it seemed kinda thrown together. All teams did get a couple of spots in but its over quick with RVD and Booker retaining their titles. 5/10.

-Coach is looking for the Undertaker, he hears some noise but it turns out to be Bobby Heenan and Mean Gene Okerlund with Mae Young and The Fabulous Moolah (one word, ack).

-Chris Jericho vs. Christian: After months of build-up everything came to a head as Christian felt jealous of his best friend Jericho paying more attention to Trish than their friendship. This was actually the first good match of the night as both men knew each other very well from having teamed up for about a year prior to this. Both countered each others moves well and hit some good spots of their own. The end where Trish came down to help Jericho but turned on him shocked the audience however most people should've seen it coming. Christian hits the Unprettier for the win. 8/10.

-Mick Foley is backstage and the Rock comes up to pump him up about the match, pretty good promo.

-2 on 3 Handicap Tag Team Match: Rock N' Sock Connection vs. Evolution: After Orton had spit in Foley's face and punted him down some stairs, Foley made a return at the Royal Rumble and eliminated Orton. Now we have this match and its a good encounter, nice to see Rock back in the ring too. Rock and Flair have a good face/off with Rock even mocking Ric's strut. The match does end suddenly when Orton hits an RKO on Foley out of nowhere for the win. 7/10.

-Highlights are shown from the Hall of Fame show, pretty touching comments by Bobby Heenan.

-Playboy Evening Gown Tag Team Match, Sable & Torrie Wilson vs. Stacy Keibler & Miss Jackie: Yes the women looked good, but there was no reason for this match to be here. 0/10.

-Pretty cool segment backstage with Eddie Guerrero and Chris Benoit with them talking about their respective title matches.

-WWE Cruiserweight Championship Open, Chavo Guerrero (Champion) vs. Jamie Noble vs. Funaki vs. Ultimo Dragon vs. Rey Mysterio vs. Nunzio vs. Tajiri vs. Shannon Moore vs. Billy Kidman: Done elimination style, two men are inside the ring, the other eight are out at ringside, when one is eliminated another comes in. It was nice to see Ultimo on a grand PPV stage like Wrestlemania and Kidman later hits a huge Shooting Star Press to the outside on a few men. The match comes down to Rey and Chavo and after some cheating Chavo is able to retain his title. Not a bad match, 7/10.

-Interpromotional Match, Goldberg (Raw) vs. Brock Lesnar (Smackdown) w/special referee Stone Cold Steve Austin: What should've been a fantastic power for power match was turned into one of the worst matches I've ever seen on PPV. Both men were leaving the company after this match, though Lesnar's were revealed a bit before this show and the crowd seemed to attack him more. Its such a bad match that the crowd starts chanting for Austin in the opening minutes of this match. Golderg ends up hitting the spear and Jackhammer to win. 2/10. Afterwards Austin stuns both men much to the crowds delight.

-Mr. McMahon comes out and thanks the crowd for supporting them for all these years.

-Fatal Four Way Match for the WWE Tag Team Championship: Scotty 2 Hotty & Rikishi (Champions) vs. APA vs. The Basham Brothers vs. The World's Greatest Tag Team: Like the Raw four way, this one while not bad seemed thrown together. Scotty and Rikishi do end up retaining. 5/10.

Disc 2

-Jesse ""The Body"" Ventura interviews Donald Trump who is in the crowd, pretty boring honestly.

-WWE Women's Championship Match, If Molly Loses Her head Will be Shaved, Victoria (Champion) vs. Molly Holly: A good women's match, both tried really hard and got some good moves in. The finish came out of nowhere though as Victoria used a backslide to pick up the win. 6/10. The hair shaving afterwards actually made me pity Molly even though she knew it was coming.

-WWE Championship Match, Eddie Guerrero (Champion) vs. Kurt Angle: Such great wrestling from both men, Eddie gets his chance to shine on the biggest stage in a main event and he doesn't disappoint. Of course Angle doesn't either as he always rises up and has a great match on the big stage. This was the definition of main event and both men kept this going at a great pace throughout. Eddie fights out of the ankle lock, loosens up his boot and when Angle goes for it again he gets just the boot in his hands. He rushes at Eddie and gets rolled up for the 3 count so Eddie retains his title. 10/10.

-Undertaker vs. Kane: If I could rate this on build-up alone it would be a 10/10, as the promos and everything leading up to this match was top notch. The entrances were both good especially Takers as the crowd was on its feet from the opening gong. The match however was typical big man vs. big man, not bad but not great. Taker ends up hitting the Tombstone to win. 6/10.

-Triple-Threat Match For The World Heavyweight Championship, Triple H (Champion) vs. Chris Benoit vs. Shawn Michaels: Easily one of the best triple threats I've seen as all three men get multiple moments to shine. There is some unexpected double teaming from Triple H and Shawn as they try to take out Benoit while he holds his own and takes it to both men. There's a sick spot where H and Michaels double suplex Benoit through an announce table. The closing moments are great as Michaels goes to superkick Benoit but gets thrown out of the ring, then Triple H tries for the pedigree but gets reveresed into the Crippler Crossface and after trying to get out of it for about a minute finally taps out. New World Champion Chris Benoit. 10/10. Nice moment afterwards where WWE Champion Eddie Guerrero comes into the ring and we see a good celebration between the long time friends.

-Its a good PPV, but not quite up to par for what a 20 year anninversary show should be. The main events were great though.

Extras

2021979,5,B0001OGVQ2,"I know that the main event will forever be marred in people's minds by the events that took place just a few short years after, but in the context of the time, the ending sequence remains one of the classic images of wrestling history. I had lost this DVD before, and had wanted to get a hold of it again, but not the censored version that WWE sells now in the post-Benoit murders world.

  Things I remember about this DVD: The Eddie-Kurt Angle match was phenomenal. I saw them live not long after this in a 2 out of 3 falls taped for TV match. Eddie and Kurt are two of the best ever. The ending of this match is clever and fits in perfectly with Eddie's character at the time.

  The Victoria- Molly Holly head shaving match reminds of how weak the WWE's women's division is now. Gone are the great workers they had then: Trish, Lita, Molly, Jazz, Victoria, Jacqueline, Ivory. It's a totally different era now, and this match and the final Trish-Lita match are two of the last good matches I've seen in WWE or TNA in many years. At least there's SHIMMER...

  I had forgotten that Kane and Undertaker had a match on this card. Now the talk is they might main event Wrestlemania this year. Ugh. This match in 2004 was fine.

  The 3 on 2 with Rock and Foley against Evolution was a damn good match and Rock's last match in WWE. Pure wrestling entertainment, in a good way.

  The main event was a thing of beauty at the time. Remember that Benoit was coming off of a 60+ minute performance at the Royal Rumble, and he was on fire. Triple H even taps out in the middle clean here. They had a rematch at Backlash the month after where Shawn tapped clean in the middle. I can't fathom how they edited this match  to make it make sense. The guy who wins isn't even in the new version.

  Go out of your way to watch the Road to Wrestlemania special in the Extras. It is a documentary on the events leading up to Wrestlemania 19, without the kayfabe. This was the year that Brock Lesnar main evented with Kurt Angle in the main event and Brock almost broke his neck doing a shooting star press. Crazy to think he's been UFC champion since then. The segments with Steve Austin are particularly compelling. At Wrestlemania 19, Rock finally got his win at Wrestlemania over Austin, but that isn't the gritty part of the story. Also in the Extras, Ric Flair puts over his 10 favorite 'Mania matches. He ranks the TLC with the Hardys, E + C, and Dudleys a little high I think, but that was indeed a spectacle.

  Overall this is a great DVD, arguably their best Wrestlemania ever, right up there with 3, 17, and 10 in my opinion.",1288828800,,2621,4.316973415132924
2021980,4,B0001OGVQ2,"As other reviews have stated, WM20 is one of those events that would have a very hard time living up to the hype that had advertised it dating all the way back to Survivor Series 2003.  In some lights, the event lived up to the hype, and in others.. it didn't.  There are a few things that stop this WM from being a 5 star show.

United States Title:
Big Show vs. John Cena
This is the last time you will see John Cena on the undercard of Wrestlemania, or any WWE PPV event for that matter.  This dates back to the times where Cena was a ""rapper"" and would give the crowd a little rhyme before the match began.  The match was pretty good and probably the best choice for an opener to get the crowd going.

World Tag Team Titles:
Rob Van Dam & Booker T vs. The Dudley Boyz vs. La Resistance vs. Garrison Cade & Mark Jindrak
As stale as this match was, I liked WWE's attmept to get a lot of its tag teams involved in Wrestlemania.  The match was nothing you have never seen before, and could have used something else.  I suppose the competitors are not to blame, because the talent was all there.

Christian vs. Chris Jericho
This is one of the matches where you can watch over and over again.  It lasts for a lengthy 20 minutes or so, but the action never stops.  The psychology of the match with the love triangle with Trish Stratus adds to it as well.  This is debatable one of the best matches on the card.  The ending is something genius as well.

Mick Foley & The Rock vs. Ric Flair, Batista, & Randy Orton
This whole handicap match was mostly focused around the storyline that Mick Foley and Randy Orton had going.  I guess the main point of the match was to further their storyline and create an impact with the Rock returning to the ring after a year of absence.  The match itself was predictable and nothing you'll remember tomorrow morning.  Perhaps just that Foley loses to Orton at WM in a quick and sudden pinfall.

Evening Gown Match:
Sable & Torrie Wilson vs. Miss Jackie & Stacy Kiebler
This is the type of match where you just have to take it for what it is.  No, the wrestling quality is not all there, but I don't think anyone is honestly expecting it to be.  The match is somewhat amusing.

Cruiserweight Title Cruiswerweight Open:
Chavo Guerrero vs. Rey Meysterio vs. Tajiri vs. Akio vs. Billy Kidman vs. Jamie Noble vs. Ultimo Dragon vs. Funaki vs. Nunzio vs. Shannon Moore
Odddly enough, this was my favorite match on the card.  The stipulation for the match is a brilliant idea.  With all of the different superstars going in and out of the match, it enables the pace to continue, giving plenty of high flying arsenal and different finishers.  The psychology added to the match helps it as well.  The only one thing that brings it down is the ending.

Goldberg vs. Brock Lesnar; w/ Stone Cold Steve Austin as Guest Referee
I feel that the WWE really lost out on this one.  The storyline going between these guys was not very believable and the hype was a little annoying.  Both men would leave the company right after this match.  But this is a review of the match, so as for the action, it was a little sparse.  The men tried to build our ""raging suspense"" by waiting several minutes before they would lock up.  The crowd was torn throughout the action, but was very much alive.  My favorite part was the ending when Austin gave both Lesnar and Goldberg a stunner.  How appropriate.

WWE Tag Team Titles:
Rikishi & Scotty 2 Hotty vs. Farooq & Bradshaw vs. Bashams vs. Charlie Haas & Shelton Benjamin
No, it is not Deja Vu, just a repeat in stipulation from the raw tag title match.  Although still stale, this match was a little bit better than the previous one, but that still isn't saying very much.  Worth a look, but probably does not belong on the card at Wrestlemania.

Women's Title:
Victoria vs. Molly Holly
I'm sure WWE had to pay Molly Holly a lot of money to get her to have her head shaved once she lost to Victoria.  WWE usually does a pretty good job in booking solid women's matches for Wrestlemania, and they continued to do so here.  The match was nothing spectacular, but flowed nicely and was botch-free.  When comparing to the divas division today, I will definitely settle with this.

WWE Title:
Eddie Guerrero vs. Kurt Angle
In my opinion, this match outdoes the triple threat main event from raw.  The match had plenty of time and delivered throughout.  Eddie and Kurt are always reliable for good matches, especially when they are paired with one another.  The grapples and counters were solid and enjoyable.  You could definitely tell that the two men put a lot of effort into their work on this night.  The ending slightly brings this down.

The Undertaker vs. Kane
This was nothing in comparison to their match at Wrestlemania 15.  The hype for the match was perfect and the entrances were excellently done.  As for the match, it was again, nothing special or memorable.  At this point, I think we are all pretty much sold that Taker will never lose at Wrestlemania.  What can I say?  I was amused.

World Heavyweight Title:
Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels vs. Chris Beniot
I was very satisfied with the caliber of this main event for WM20.  Like I stated earlier, this was not as good as the Smackdown main event, but it still did deliver.  I think we all knew the outcome going in after Beniot won the Rumble after entering number one.  Aside from it being a nice time in history, it was just a good main event, nothing outstanding.  But again, I was satisfied.

While I think that this event is important for many reasons, it still lacked a couple of things.  Most of the matches delivered for the most part, but none of them really went to the next level like they potentially could have done.  I enjoyed this Wrestlemania thoroughly, but wanted a little more.  It is also noteworthy that both of the main event winners are now deceased.  I recommend.",1283212800,,5902,4.4486940298507465

2022012,5,B0001OGVQ2,"I was fourteen-years-old when I watched Wrestlemania XX, I took the day off school and sat on the edge of my seat virtually the whole way. It was one of the most awesome and memorable times for me as a wrestling fan watching my favourite wrestlers win and retail titles.
Six years later, I thought I'd go back and watch it again. Here's my review:

{WWE United States Championship}
Big Show (c) vs. John Cena

This was John Cena's first Wrestlemania, being with the WWE for nearly two years by this point already. But it was still a good debut for him. He and Big Show had been feuding somewhat recently, both of them being involved in a triple threat with Kurt Angle at No Way Out a month beforehand.
Their match was far from great or memorable, it was almost entirely dominated by Big Show barring a few punches from Cena here and there.
But Cena ended up winning after nailing Big Show with a pair of brass knucks and hitting with the FU, which I have to admit is impressive to see on someone the mass of Big Show.
This is noteworthy I guess as being both Cena's first Wrestlemania and his first title win in the WWE.

6/10 (because it was slow and one-sided, but still good to see Cena win.)

{World Tag Team Championship Match}
{Fatal Four Way}
Rob Van Dam & Booker T (c) vs. La Resistance vs. The Dudley Boyz vs. Mark Jindrak & Garrison Cade

Ehh... I'm a huge fan of Rob Van Dam and Booker T as singles wrestlers, but I hate when two guys like these, who should be in the main event, are thrown together and given the tag team titles because the writing team can't find anything else for them to do. The Tag Team Championship should be reserved for legitimate tag teams like the Dudleyz or La Resistance. It's also disappointing to see Booker T here since he was wrestling for the World Heavyweight Championship at the Wrestlemania before this.
Anyway, the match was short and, as can be expected from a match with four tag teams, quite jumbled and hard to follow at times. There were lots of random tags with no team really getting an upperhand anywhere.
Somewhere towards the end, all chaos broke out and everyone started fighting ringside for some reason, Booker T then hit Rob Conway with a Scissors Kick which RVD followed up with a Five Star Frog Splash to win and retain the titles.
There was a lot of talent in this match, however, I can't help but feel that it was only made so that the smaller teams of La Resistance and Jindrak & Cade were able to get onto a Wrestlemania card. Ideally, I think I would've actually preferred to see The Dudley Boyz turn heel and just have a straight forward 2-on-2 match with RVD and Booker T.

6.5/10 (because I'm a mark for RVD and seeing him win a title match - any title match - is awesome)

Christian vs. Chris Jericho

This was the first standout match of the night. Christian and Jericho had a long lasting alliance as heels dating back to 2002. But this match turned Jericho face. It also had a romance storyline behind it, with Chris Jericho falling for Trish Stratus, and Christian becoming jealous. I felt Jericho's face turn off of such a sappy angle was kind of weak, but still, it worked for me.
Jericho and Christian put on an excellent match, a lot of high spots and back and forths and it had an ending that I don't think anyone really predicted.
Trish Stratus ran out to the ring towards the end of the match, Christian dragged her into the ring involving her in the match. Trish then inadvertently smacked Jericho with an elbow by mistake letting Christian roll him up and get the surprise win.
After the match, it looked as though Trish was about to apologize to Chris Jericho, instead, she gave him two the hardest slaps ever, followed by an Unprettier from Christian. Christian then made out with Trish on the stage, effectively turning Trish Stratus into a heel for the first time in years, and Chris Jericho into a full fledged fan favourite.

8.5/10

{Handicap Match}
Randy Orton, Batista & Ric Flair vs. The Rock 'n' Sock Connection

It was great to see The Rock 'n' Sock Connection reunite, regardless of if they won or lost. And the fact that The Rock and Mick Foley were involved with Wrestlemania 20 added to the scope and excitement of the show overall.
The match itself was pretty good, some parts of it did drag a bit, with Evolution getting the upperhand for most of it. But hey, we got to see a People's Elbow and a Rock Bottom, and a mandible claw.
But Randy Orton managed to get the pinfall on Mick Foley with a surprise RKO just as Foley pulled out Mr. Socko.
This is the last match that The Rock has been in, so it would have been nicer to see him in a legitimate match. Maybe one day we'll see The Rock vs. Randy Orton one-on-one? But either way, it was just good to see this match, and as much as it sucked to see Evolution get the win, it did give Orton the heat he needed to get the main event push and the world title later in the year.

7/10

{Interpromotional Playboy Evening Gown Match}
Stacy Keibler & Miss Jackie vs. Torrie Wilson & Sable

This was time filler and eye candy. You know you're not going to really get a wrestling match when it has divas in it and ""playboy"" is in the title of the match stipulation.
The match was extremely short - which worked in its favour. But it wasn't much of a match. All the girls decided they'd rather wrestle with their evening gowns off and stripped down, although Miss Jackie had to be forceably coerced into taking her dress off.
Torrie and Sable ended up getting the win and what was quite a forgettable match.

4/10 (they only get a 4 because they're hot.)

{WWE Cruiserweight Championship}
{Cruiserweight Open}
Chavo Guerrero (c) vs. Ultimo Dragon vs. Shannon Moore vs. Jamie Noble vs. Funaki vs. Nunzio vs. Billy Kidman vs. Rey Mysterio vs. Tajiri vs. Akio

This was a sort of gauntlet kind of match. Basically two guys started in the ring, every time one wrestler was pinned or tapped out, he would leave and another cruiserweight would enter at random. Last man standing is the new champion.
I won't go through the details, but I will mention a highlight being Billy Kidman's springboard shooting star press out of the ring onto two other enemies.
The match came down to Rey Mysterio and Chavo Guerrero whom had been feuding. But Chavo, with help from his dad, Chavo Guerrero Snr, cheated and won.
Much like the tag match, I saw this as a way to get ten wrestlers who normally wouldn't be on Wrestlemania, into the spotlight for a few minutes. Still, the match had some good moments and made it entertaining enough.

7/10

Brock Lesnar vs. Goldberg
{Special Guest Referee: Steve Austin}

This match was nothing but hype. Lesnar and Goldberg had been having an interpromotional feud for a few months where they kept invading each other's shows, culminating Goldberg costing Lesnar the WWE title at No Way Out.
I guess in someways, this match made sense. I mean, Goldberg, the guy that was unstoppable in WCW with that massive undefeated streak of his, and Brock Lesnar - the WWE's own home made version of Goldberg, having a match at Wrestlemania. But it just didn't work.
The match seemed to drag forever, and it was obvious that the audience were against both of them and the match in general. By now it was public knowledge that Goldberg's contract was at an end and Brock Lesnar was leaving pro wrestling.
Goldberg hit a spear and a jackhammer to win, no surprise there.
After the match, Austin gave both Lesnar and Goldberg a stunner each, which was the only time the crowd seemed to pop at all.
This was the worst match of the night. And I sat through the evening gown match. It was horrible and made me want to hit the skip button as soon as possible. No one really wanted either Lesnar or Goldberg to win, no one cared when Goldberg did win. People were just happy that the match was over.

2/10 (the only reason it gets higher than 1 is because Austin saved it at the end).

{WWE Tag Team Championship}
{Fatal Four Way}
Rikishi & Scotty 2 Hotty (c) vs. The Basham Brothers vs. The World's Greatest Tag Team vs. The APA

My sentiments on this match echo my feelings on the Raw Tag Team match. This was an excuse to fill time and give some smaller names a shot on a Wrestlemania card and had very little build up.
I think the best team in this match was The World's Greatest Tag Team, but Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty, the fan favourites, left with the win.
It is interesting though, to see Bradshaw here in the APA wrestling on an undercard match, losing to Rikishi & Scotty 2 Hotty. A few months after this, he'd be main eventing pay-per-views as John Bradshaw Layfield, holding the WWE Championship.

5/10 (too short and the mediocrity of the Lesnar/Goldberg match rubbed off onto this one.)

{WWE Women's Championship}
{Hair vs. Title Match}
Victoria (c) vs. Molly Holly

I'm glad they made this match, Victoria and Molly, along with Trish, were probably the best in-ring divas at the time of Wrestlemania XX. Wrestling wise, this match heavily overshadowed the other diva match of the night. However, I think it still could have been better. If they gave them maybe a few extra minutes, they could have done a lot more and made the match even better. But as it stands, the match wasn't amazing and could have just as easily taken place on Raw.
Victoria ended up rolling up Molly to get the win. Then she dragged her to the barber's chair, strapped her in and proceeded to cut her hair, which admittedly was funny to watch.

5.5/10 (it needed a little bit more time and it could have been miles better.)

{WWE Championship}
Eddie Guerrero (c) vs. Kurt Angle

Finally, where Christian and Chris Jericho left off, Kurt Angle and Eddie Guerrero pick up here, by which I mean, the good wrestling part of the show.
Eddie and Kurt put on a stellar match with Eddie being the underdog. This match would also prove whether or not Eddie would be a mainstay in the SmackDown main event scene or if he'd just be a transitional champion. It would also test how much faith the WWE had in him, giving him a main event match at Wrestlemania.
Turns out they had a lot of faith. They gave him and Kurt Angle 20+ minutes which was full of amazing wrestling moments, which ended with Eddie slipping his boot off in the middle of an Ankle Lock, then rolling up Kurt Angle into a small package and using the ropes for the win.
This was definitely in strong competition for match of the night, and it also washed that bad Lesnar/ Goldberg taste out of my mouth.

9/10 (couldn't ask for much better than that.)

Kane vs. The Undertaker

I think that the buildup for this match was excellent. The writers actually put a lot of time, effort and creativity into it. As popular as The Undertaker always has been, I don't think he has ever gotten over with the fans as well as he should have when he was going through with his biker gimmick. It's his Deadman gimmick that people will always remember him for, not riding to the ring on a motorbike, wearing sunglasses and referring to the ring as his ""yard.""
I have to admit, I had my eyes glued to the screen for The Undertaker's entrance when I watched this for the first time. It felt very surreal and exciting seeing all of The Undertaker's hooded minions holding flaming torches as well as Paul Bearer himself leading the way for The Undertaker's return.
The match itself - it wasn't great. Although I wasn't necessarily expecting great. The role of this match was mostly just to bring The Undertaker back from the dead and renew the fan's interest in him.
We saw vintage Undertaker, all the moves that he's famous for barring the Last Ride.
He ended up hitting with a Chokeslam and a Tombstone Piledriver to get the win.

6/10 (I'm rating the match itself here. If I were to rate the buildup and the excitement of seeing The Undertaker's return, then the rating would be a lot higher.)

{World Heavyweight Championship}
Triple H (c) vs. Shawn Michaels vs. Chris Benoit

This was as good of a main event that you could ask for, and probably the best triple threat match I can ever remember seeing. When I first watched it, I legitimately had no idea which way it would go. I was so torn. I wanted desperately for Chris Benoit to finally get the win, but at the same time, I was a huge HBK fan and I loved his feud with Triple H regardless of how long it was dragging on for. But at the same time, I had seen Triple H go main event after main event without putting anyone over, so I probably wouldn't have been shocked if he left still the champion.
But I managed to have a sigh of relief as Triple H tapped out to the Crossface at just over 25 minutes into the match. It was a stellar match. Pretty much everyone was busted open and bloodied. We saw all the trademark moves, Sweet Chin Music, Pedigree, Crossface, Flying Headbutt. We saw Chris Benoit get suplexed through an announcers table. We even saw Triple H and Shawn Michaels teaming up briefly, but only so that HBK could get what he wanted - Triple H one on one.
But Benoit managed to get back into the ring, reverse a super kick and hurl Michaels out of the ring before countering the pedigree into the crossface on Triple H for the win.
After the match, Eddie entered the ring and celebrated with Chris Benoit in what was a great and memorable moment, seeing two fan favourites and best friends together at Wrestlemania with the two heavyweight championships.

10/10

---

Overall:

Wrestlemania XX definitely has a lot of highs and a lot of lows. It has a lot in the way of time fillers, what with the evening gown match, the tag matches and the cruiserweight open, however, entertainment can still be found in these time fillers. No matter how irrelevant a match with so many wrestlers as the Cruiserweight open might be, you can still find entertainment in the highflying and impressive stunts pulled off by the likes of Billy Kidman and Rey Mysterio. You can still enjoy seeing Rob Van Dam and Booker T coming out of Wrestlemania as champions, and you can still enjoy the evening gown match for the obvious reason that it has four hot women leaving very little to the imagination.
It's lowest point, if you haven't already guess, is the Goldberg and Lesnar match, but even then you can find some entertainment in the audience's reaction, how heavily they're against the match. And you can find entertainment in Stone Cold Steve Austin. If he can't entertain you as a wrestling fan, then I don't know who can.
And it's high points are great. Chris Jericho and Christian put on a memorable and excellent match for the undercard, while both the WWE Championship and World Heavyweight Championship matches are in a class of their own.
And of course, it's a great sight to see The Undertaker returning as the Dead Man.
I will note that I found it strangely uncomfortable to watch in some ways, especially the Chris Benoit segments. It's an understatement to say that it's difficult to root for someone who did what he did. Double murder-suicide aside, that won't ever take away the fact that he was one of the industries most hard working and intense workers and he, along with Triple H and Shawn Michaels, put on an amazing main event well worth your money.

I would definitely recommend Wrestlemania - it has loads of DVD extras as well, the usuals that you can come to expect from a WWE DVD (pre and post match interviews etc.) as well as a ton of other features.",1272412800,,15409,4.477548111190306
2022013,3,B0001OGVQ2,"Big Show VS John Cena: Cena is still in his rap gimmick and he does one before this match. However, this isn't one of his best raps he's done. The match is good and Big Show does a really great job in this match and the ending was well done. Cena wins the US title in a good opener.

RVD and Booker T VS Dudley Boys VS Cade and Jindrak VS La Resistance: This match started good and towards the end chaos ensues. All wrestlers enter the ring and brawl, you cannot tell who is legal anymore, and the tag team champions somehow retains the tag titles in all the chaos.

Christian VS Chris Jericho: The wrestling in this match was fine but I just found it a little boring. The ending was a twist.

Evolution (Ric Flair, Randy Orton, and Batista) VS Rock N' Sock Connection: A very good and entertaining match. Foley was the weak link in this match but he did hit a nice elbow from the apron onto Flair on the outside. Orton pins Foley in the end with an RKO out of nowhere. A good showing by both teams.

Torrie Wilson and Sable VS Jackie and Stacey Keibler: Skip

Cruiserweight Opening: Poor Ultimo Dragon, he was such a force in Japan and WCW. WWE didn't know how to market him and his run in WWE is probably forgotten by many. He pins Shannon Moore in the opening match and then taps out to Jamie Noble. This match is pretty standard with Chavo Guerrero retaining the belt in the end via cheating but it looked like it was botched.

Goldberg VS Brock Lesnar with Stone Cold as Ref: This match sucked beyond belief and words cannot describe the horror of this match. Do not watch this and avoid ever watching this and you'll thank me.

Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty VS APA VS Bashams VS The World's Greatest Tag Team: This match is the exact same thing as the Raw match but a little worse.

Victora VS Molly Holly Hair VS Hair Match: Two good women wrestlers but I still didn't watch it. The end result was pretty goood though.

Eddie Guerrero VS Kurt Angle: These two wrestlers always deliver a good match and this was no different. A great match and I loved the ending.

Kane VS Undertaker: Paul Bearer makes his return as Undertaker's manager. The match was short but was good. However, the ending sucked as Kane hits a chokeslam on Undertaker but doesnt cover him and walks around the ring for a few minutes and Undertaker gets up and beats Kane.

Shawn Michaels VS Triple H VS Chris Benoit: A very good triple threat match that saw Benoit realize his life long dream of winning the world title.

Overall, a mixed WrestleMania. Half was good and the other half wasn't bad but nothing you'd go out of your way for. Lesnar-Goldberg sucked beyond belief though and i'd stay far away from that one.",1259366400,,2693,4.3532934131736525

Goldberg vs Lesnar (Austin as Special Guest Referee)

Terrible, terrible match. Neither one seemed really interested in the match seeing as it was both of their lasts. Even Austin couldn't save it. 2/10

Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty vs The APA vs The Bashams vs The World's Greatest Tag Team

Solid Match, nothing spectacular. Kinda dumb stipulations with the tags and all but a decent match nonetheless.  Would've liked to see Farooq get in there but it was cool without him.  5.5/10

Victoria vs Molly Holly (Women's Championship vs Hair Match)

Really good showing by both women. Not either of their best work but good nonetheless. 6.5/10

Eddie Guerrero vs Kurt Angle (WWE Championship Match)

A GREAT match. I'm a huge fan of Eddie's and this was one of my favorite matches of his with a great ending that plays to Eddie's gimmick. Awesome match. 9.5/10

Kane vs Undertaker

Glorified squash match, but still rather entertaining. Best part was taker's entrance. It was great to see and hear Paul Bearer again. Brought back LOTS of memories. 6/10 (More for the entertainment and entrances {Kane's was a sight too} than the match itself)

Triple H vs Chris Benoit vs Shawn Michaels (World Heavyweight Title Match)

Awesome match that got pretty brutal at points and had lots of back and forth action. up there w/ taker, angle and rock at vengeance 02 as one of the best triple threat matches ever. 9/10

Chris Benoit and Eddie Guerrero in the ring at the end. One of the greatest Wrestlemania moments in history.  Overall really good.  The crowd was awesome, but then again MSG crowds always are. The crowd gave almost every match that wrestlemania feel to it, especially in the benoit and goldberg matches. the crowd was AMAZING during those 2. but overall a very solid wrestlemania.",1208736000,,2706,4.8130434782608695
2022016,3,B0001OGVQ2,"Without judging the vast amount of special features, I'm going to say that Wrestlemania XX was not all it was hyped up to be.  Many of the matches were truly great, and the return of the real Undertaker was momentous, but it fell short in that typical WWE way and somehow managed to botch one of their potentially stellar main events into a laughably simplistic match that could have easily taken place on a TV show without notice.

United States Championship
The Big Show (C) vs John Cena
Any match that features John Cena is bound to be a dissapointment.  I think the ECW fans at One Night Stand 2006 flawlessly summed him up and there's no need to do much else here other than say he can't wrestle, and his gimmick is by far the worst thing WWE has ever done in recent years.  I would much rather have the Katie Vick storyline brought back than see Cena in the WWE, much less as a main eventer.  He is a bumbling failure in this match, and the Big Show is not much of a wrestler himself, but at least he has the stage presence to make himself truly felt.  John Cena's victory here made the whole match like trying to swallow a bitter pill and throwing it back up.  (0/10 and that's being generous)

World Tag Team Championship
Rob Van Dam and Booker T (C) vs Garrison Cade and Mark Jindrak vs The Dudley Boyz vs La Resistance
Whoever devised this whole fatal four way tag, where only two men are in the ring, and any random person can randomly tag any other random person whether they're on their team or not, is an idiot.  Aside from the poor stipulations, the combatants were at their best and put on a great match.  (7/10)

Chris Jericho vs Christian
The storyline behind this match was, uncharacteristic for the WWE, a good one and believable.  Christian's already proven to me at Insurrextion 2003 that he's an astounding singles wrestler, and Jericho is great on his own.  They put on a superb match that really stands out in the night.  (8/10)

Rock 'n Sock Connection vs Evolution
This one was hyped up to a point of awkwardness.  The promo Randy Orton did with Batista and Ric Flair at his side was a complete fumbling that made me smack my forehead at how awkward it was.  The friendship in the ring between The Rock and Mick Foley is awkward as well.  Foley pretty much summed up the match in the extras post-match interview: ""It wasn't my best"".  We all quite saw it out there too.  (3/10)

Evening Gown Match
Sable and Torrie Wilson vs Jackie Gayda and Stacey Kiebler
Was there even a point in them getting dressed in gowns?  They just stripped down to their bra and panties before the match started and spent a good 3 or 4 minutes bouncing around Diva-style (ie, not wrestling) and showing the crowd their butts and crotches.  I can't even justify this with a rating.  It was not good.

WWE Cruiserweight Championship Cruiserweight Open
Chavo Guerrero (C) vs Rey Mysterio vs Jamie Noble vs Billy Kidman vs Ultimo Dragon vs Little Guido (I mean, Nunzio) vs Tajiri vs Funaki vs Shannon Moore
I think this was perhaps one of the best matches of the night.  It wasn't long enough, but virtually everyone was high impact and at their best.  One by one, superstars would battle one-on-one battles, defeat their opponent, and another would come in.  The only disappointment was Chavo's ""cowardly heel"" ending.  (10/10)

Goldberg vs Brock Lesnar
Both men were about to leave the WWE, and I guess the fans knew it.  I had read that the fans abused both men, hated them both for leaving, and really tore into them.  I'm guessing whoever wrote that never saw an ECW match.  The fans really seemed confused here.  They cheered Goldberg as he entered, they didn't seem to know when to boo as Lesnar and Goldberg stood off in the ring.  Only once did they start singing that goodbye song to Lesnar, and they seemed really confused whether to cheer Goldberg or not.  The match was very low-impact, and it took a good five or six minutes for the two to start the fight.  A huge disappointment.  The fans were confused and dumb as ever, only cheering when Stone Cold Steve Austin gave the stunner to both men.  (0/10)

WWE Tag Team Championship
Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty (C) vs APA vs Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas vs The Basham Brothers
Again, the same stipulation as I mentioned in the previous tag team fatal four way.  Someone must have been drunk on the after-party wine already in this match, because Faarooq wasn't involved officially in the match at all, Bradshaw did very little, and all in all the match was very unimpressive from Shelton or Charlie or the APA.  It boiled down mostly to Scotty 2 Hotty and Rikishi vs The Basham Brothers vs Bradshaw.  The Bashams seemed to receive most of the attention from the bookers, and did the most in the ring.  (4/10)

WWE Women's Championship
Molly Holly vs Victoria (C)
The stipulation of this match stated that if Molly lost, she'd get her head shaved.  Guess what happened.  Yeah well like I have said many times before, if WWE refuses to let it's Women's division rise above mediocrity, they shouldn't populate their expensive PPVs with lousy women's matches! (0/10)

WWE Championship
Eddie Guerrero (C) vs Kurt Angle
This match was heavily built up with all sorts of emotion in the storyline and both men were given over 20 minutes to battle.  Compared to Guerrero's main event match the month before against Brock Lesnar, this one was mediocre.  This one could barely qualify as ""average"" on a regular Smackdown show.  As this was a Smackdown main event, and Smackdown is always the second-rate show, this one was done before the RAW event and even before the Undertaker and Kane match.  The only good part was Eddie Guerrero's unique way of screwing Kurt Angle by pretending his ankle was hurt, unlacing his boot, and when Angle comes at him with an ankle lock, Eddie slides out by yanking his foot out of his boot.  (4/10)

The Undertaker vs Kane
This had been built up for months after the Undertaker was buried alive at Survivor Series 2003.  It's a good thing they buried that American Bad Ass biker gimmick, and brought back the REAL Undertaker---the Deadman.  Unfortunately, he still wears that stupid biker tanktop, and his Sara tattoo is very noticeable.  Kane is not the same Kane, but rather a fat bald idiot who is truly ugly and a poor wrestler.  At least Undertaker returns truly  (6/10)

World Heavyweight Championship
Chris Benoit vs Triple H (C) vs Shawn Michaels
I was expecting wonders from this match based on all the other reviews.  I was expecting some tour de force that WWE has been severely lacking.  I was severely disappointed by the hype.  Triple H barely does much, while Chris Benoit and Shawn Michaels have some entertaining back-and-forth action, but mostly it boils down to brawling, with 70-80% of the match being made up of pillowstrikes and basic generic brawler moves like DDTs and Suplexes.  The only really amazing point in the match is where Michaels and Triple H doubleteam against Benoit and suplex him from atop the Spanish Announcer's Table onto the Smackdown Table.  Everything else hardly qualified as average.  Like the Smackdown main event, it qualifies as a ""good"" main event for the average RAW show.  (5.5/10)

All in all, it was a decent Wrestlemania, but the failure of the main events and the lackluster events numbering more than two makes this three out of five stars, unfortunately.  Bad bad bad WWE.  For shame.",1180310400,,7433,4.625668449197861
2022017,3,B0001OGVQ2,"United States Championship
John Cena Vs. Big Show - This is actually a good opening bout. Cena did a good job getting the crowd pumped with his pre-match rap. Big Show and Cena put in a good effort and they produce a good match for the U.S. Title. Everything an opening match is suppose to do, Big Show and Cena did it. Good match from Cena and Big Show. 3.5/5

World Tag Team Championship
Booker T & Rob Van Dam Vs. La Resistance Vs. Lance Cade & Mark Jindrake Vs. Dudley Boyz - The first weaker matches of the night. The match was average but it really didn't deliver. The match didn't really flow and it was really boring all the way through. 2.5/5

Chris Jericho Vs. Christian - This is the sleeper match of the night. Jericho and Christian brought their A game and they delivered one heck of a wrestling match. This was a solid back and forth contest and very entertaining. The post-match heel turn of Trish added more flavor to match as well. Great match. 4.5/5

The Rock & Mick Foley Vs. Intercontinental Champion Randy Orton, Ric Flair, & Batista - This was another good contest too. The Rock looked to be on his game for not wrestling in a PPV since Backlash of last year. All five men gave in a good effort and they produced a very entertaining match. A very good match for what it's worth. 4/5

Playboy Evening Gown Match
Sable & Torrie Wilson Vs. Stacy Keiber & Miss Jackie - The T&A portion of the night and thats all this match provided. Nothing besides that takes place here. 1.5/5

Curiserweight Open for the Cruiserweight Championship
Nothing really special here. I few nice spots with the cruiserweights but nothing that really stands out. However, Billy Kidman pulled off a nice looking Shooting Star Press to Jamie Noble and Nunzio. The pin falls and the decisions came too quick and they all didn't look that believeable. A decent match at best. 3/5

Bill Goldberg Vs. Brock Lesnar - This is the most disappointing match of the night mostly because of what these two men can bring to the table and after the great build up to the match but Goldberg and Lesnar did absolutely nothing. Not even Stone Cold Steve Austin being the special guest referee could have saved this trainwreck. Where this should have been possibably the best match on card, Goldberg and Lesnar mostly stalled and produced one of the worst matches ever. The fans gave this match so much heat all the way through its duration to where Jim Ross and Jerry Lawler gave explaination on why the fans gave Goldberg and Lesnar so much heat. Without of a doubt the worst match of the night. Austin stunning Goldberg and Lesnar after the match was the only highlight. 2/5

WWE Tag Team Championship
Rikishi & Scotty 2 Hotty Vs. World's Greatest Tag Team Vs. A.P.A. Vs. Basham Brothers - This match follows the same deal as Raw's Tag Team Title Match. Nothing really sticks out and this match was just average at best. The only positives came from this match was that it boosted Shelton Benjamin's and J.B.L.'s single career. 2.5/5

Hair Match for the WWE Women's Championship
Victoria Vs. Molly Holly - A pretty above average Women's Title Match. The Hair stipulation did more good for the match then bad. Victoria and Molly delivered a nice match up and this match is quite enjoyable. 3/5

WWE Championship
Eddie Guerrero Vs. Kurt Angle - This match is pretty much dead even. Angle and Eddie delivered a well paced mat game, back and forth, technical match. Nothing really bad to say about this one. It was just good from start to finish. Eddie's clever ending was dirty but played out perfectly. This is a match that you just have to appreciate the effort and determination both men put int he match to have the best match of the night. A very good WWE Title match. 4.5/5

Undertaker Vs. Kane - Undertaker probably had the most loudest pop of the night here. His entrance was one of a kind along with Paul Bearer back on his side. This match isn't on the same level as their first meeting but it is still worth a watch and is quite enjoyable. Undertaker has a nice return match here and it did everything what it was suppose to do. I give credit to Kane also. He made Undertaker's return to being the ""Deadman"" more believeable and realistic then what it was. A very good showing from both men. 3.5/5

World Heavyweight Championship
Triple H Vs. Chris Benoit Vs. Shawn Michaels - Without of a doubt, this match was one of the greatest WrestleMania matches of all time. This match makes this PPV worth seeing. All three men has a great showing and they all delivered a fantastic main event, something that this event needed. HBK and HHH teaming up to double suplex Benoit through the announce table is something worth seeing. The closing moments to the match is something to see as well as it ends with Chris Benoit countering Triple H's Pedigree into the Crippler Crossface. Awesome main event that delivered all the way. 5/5

The 20th Anniversary of WrestleMania is a disappointing one to say the least. Less then half of the PPV delivered which was pretty pathetic for WWE's biggest PPV of all time. This is PPV is only average at best. I recommend it for the awesome main event and Undertaker's return. Other then that this event is passable unless you can find it somewhere cheap.",1173484800,,5268,4.562962962962963

2022061,4,B0001OGVQ2,"1. United States Title Match: Big Show (c) vs. John Cena
This is an interesting choice for an opener. Cena seems pretty over with the fans here, but other then the fact that Cena wins the U.S. Title for the first time, its rather boring. Decent opener I guess since it did its job, getting the crowd hyped up. Watchable, wouldn't watch again. 5/10

2. World Tag Team Championship: Booker T and Rob Van Dam (c) vs. The Dudley Boys vs. La Resistance vs. Mark Jindrak and Garrison Cade
Decent match, saved by RVD and the Dudley Boys who work well together and make the match somewhat exciting. Jindrak and Cade seem out of place, as do La Resistance. Personally, I would have preferred to have seen the Dudley Boyz vs Booker T and RVD in a Tables match, but this match isn't bad either. 6/10

3. Christian vs. Chris Jericho
Wasn't expecting the world from these two for some reason, but it was a very good match. Very back and forth and exciting. I liked the buildup and they did some pretty good moves. Jericho proves that he has great talent in the ring, and Christian holds his own . Good match with a suprise ending. 7.5/10

4. Handicap Match: Evolution vs. The Rock and Sock Connection
I was glad to see The Rock back in action, and Foley coming back to the ring isn't something to complain about either. Though they hadn't had a match for some time, they both looked excellent. I really enjoyed this match because it was very entertaining. The ending is a little annoying, but it sets up Orton vs Cactus Jack at Backlash, so I'm not complaining. Good match, good performances by all. 7.5/10

After seeing this match, I realized one match I really would like to see at next year's 'Mania: Orton vs The Rock.

5. Playboy Evening Gown Match: Torrie Wilson and Sable v. Stacy Kiebler and Jackie Gayda
Eye candy, and good eye candy at that. Watch for the ""entertainment"" value, not for a wrestling match. 5/10 because of Stacy.

6. Cruiserweight Open for the Cruiserweight Championship: Chavo Guerrero (c) vs. Jamie Noble vs. Funaki vs. Ultimo Dragon vs. Rey Mysterio vs. Nunzio vs. Tajiri vs. Shannon Moore vs. Billy Kidman
Decent match, though I was never a big fan of the Cruiserweight division. Lots of high-flying moves and innovative things, but nothing special here. Definitely worth a look though. 6.5/10

7. Brock Lesnar vs. Goldberg, with Special Guest Referee ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin
Was expecting nothing but a brawl, and thats what this is. The first 5-10 minutes are the two of them staring at each other, letting the fans abuse them. The crowd is quite aware that both Lesnar and Goldberg were leaving after 'Mania, and boy did they get it. Funny to hear the fans, but the only good part of the match is Goldberg spearing Lesnar twice and giving him the Jackhammer. Awful match, but good to finally see Lesnar get beaten. 4/10

8. WWE Tag Team Championship match: Scotty 2 Hotty and Rikishi (c) vs. the Basham Brothers vs. the APA vs. World's Greatest Tag Team
Basically the same as the World Tag Team Championship match, but I thought it was less entertaining. The Bashams seem kind of lost, and its only an average tag match. Watch once, but don't watch again. 5/10

9. Women's Championship match: Victoria (c) vs. Molly Holly
Boring match, bad stipulation (loser gets head shaved), and not interesting to me in the least bit. Skip this and get to the title matches. 3/10

10. WWE Championship Match: Eddie Guerrero (c) vs. Kurt Angle
Good match, good performances put on by both men. Terrible ending though, ruins a lot of the feel of the match, makes it seem stupid. Great match other then that though, very back and forth. 8.5/10

11. Undertaker vs. Kane
Not nearly as good as their match from Wrestlemania XIV, but still worth a watch. Undertaker's return is absolutely spectacular, the crowd was really into it. A decent match, though a little short. Glad the Deadman gimmick made a return though. 7/10

12. Triple Threat Match for the World Heavyweight Championship: Triple H (c) vs. Shawn Michaels vs. Chris Benoit
Probably one of the best Wrestlemania Main Events of all time. Outstanding triple threat, each man works well with the other, especially Triple H and HBK. The match is extremely back and forth, and not as predictable as you might think. There are many points where the match could have ended if the third man didn't break up the pin or submission. Excellent match that had the crowd on their feet. Big hype, and great delivery. Good ending too, the right man wins the title. 9.5/10

Overall, Wrestlemania XX was a good show that had many good matches, and some mediocre ones. You can tell that none of the wrestlers invovled held back in their matches, because they were on the biggest stage of them all. Some excellent performances from some great wrestlers, and in the end, a good event. Classic ending too, with Benoit and Guerrero in the ring celebrating.

Match of the Night: The Triple Threat for the WHC. Those three men definitely stole the show. Benoit was the obvious fan favorite, but he definitely proved that he deserved his time in the spotlight. All three men stepped up to the plate and this is a definite ""Match of the Year"" candidate. Great match and great ending to Wrestlemania.",1145750400,,5237,4.653679653679654

2022063,5,B0001OGVQ2,"Wrestlemania XX will remain one of my favorite Wrestlemanias ever, primarily because the two main events, especially the Raw main event. Those two matches alone are worth buying this DVD.

Big Show (C) v. John Cena

This is a pretty poor match. Put it this way, the Big Show isn't a great wrestler, and Cena only looks good when he's put in there with someone whose very talented. Not a great way to start the show, but for some reason, Cena was pretty over with the crowd so it got them pumped for the rest of the event.

Booker T & Rob Van Dam v. The Dudley Boys v. La Resistance v. Mark Jindrak & Garrison Cade

This match was alright. The teams had good chemistry together, but Jindrak and Cade looked a little lost out there. The Dudleys and La Resistance are talented tag team wrestlers, and Booker and RVD always look good, so this is worth watching.

Christian v. Chris Jericho

This was a great match, with a nice surprise ending. Christian and Jericho are two very talented guys and I'm glad that they were given plenty of time for this match. This is the first really good match of the night.

Evolution v. the Rock & Sock Connection

I was pleasantly surprised by this one. Neither the Rock nor Mick Foley had wrestled recently, but they looked great out there together. Batista was dominant as always, and Ric Flair was just fun to watch. Orton looked a little lost but he pulled it together half way through and helped out the match quite a bit.

Torrie Wilson & Sable v. Stacy Kiebler & Jackie Gayda, Playboy Evening Gown Match

If you want a wrestling match, skip this one. None of these four are good wrestlers. However, they are alot of fun to look at, so if you're in to that, go ahead and take a peek.

Cruiserweight Invitational: Chavo Guerrero v. Jamie Noble v. Funaki v. Ultimo Dragon v. Rey Mysterio v. Nunzio v. Tajiri v. Shannon Moore v. Billy Kidman

Yet again the cruiserweights are not given enough time. You have some tremendous talent in here, with the likes of Mysterio, Ultimo Dragon, Tajiri and Kidman, but this match just came off hurried and dull. Still fun to watch because these guys can perform some great moves, but not as good as it should have been.

Bill Goldberg v. Brock Lesnar, Special Guest Referee Steve Austin

I really didn't expect much from this one. Lesnar is an awful wrestler and Goldberg isn't all that much better. The most interesting part of this match was listening to the fans abuse Lesnar and Goldberg. Austin really made this match interesting. Both guys were leaving the company, and really the company was better off, especially without Lesnar. Worth a laugh, but not much to see here. It was nice to see someone beat the hell out of Lesnar, who is usually just allowed to dominate.

Scotty 2 Hotty & Rikishi v. the Basham Brothers v. the APA v. World's Greatest Tag Team

This match was a little better than the Raw version, given the incredible talent and skill that Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas possess. Scotty 2 Hotty and Ron Simmons both looked really good out there. Even the Bashams and JBL looked okay. Rikishi was fairly typical of his normal stuff, but this is worth watching.

Victoria v. Molly Holly

This was probably the end of the woman's division on Raw. It was one of the last good women's wrestling matches. These two are fairly decent, and although having Trish and Lita in there would have made it a very good match, this was still decent, although it was way too rushed.

Eddie Guerrero (C) v. Kurt Angle

This match was great. Eddie and Kurt are two amazingly talented wrestlers and they put on a hell of a show. The ending was especially great, and this match was just so much fun to watch.

Undertaker v. Kane

While this match wasn't quite as good as the Wrestlemania XIV version, it was still pretty good. It's nice to see the Deadman Gimmic back, but I think Undertaker was a little too dominating for this match to be taken seriously instead of just as another Undertaker beating.

Triple H (C) v. Chris Benoit v. Shawn Michaels

This is easily one of the greatest matches in Wrestlemania history. These three put on a tremendous contest, that went back and forth and sideways and seemed like it could end a thousand times but someone always made the save. A very exciting match, and definitely worth the cost of the whole DVD by itself.

Wrestlemania ended with one of the greatest moments in wrestling history, the two champions Guerrero and Benoit, standing in the middle of the ring celebrating. Benoit finally got the recognition he deserves, even though he may never get the title back again. But what a great time for professional wrestling. Guerrero and Benoit, two tremendous wrestlers, are the champions. Compare this to after Wrestlemania XXI where Batista and Cena were champions. Notice the difference?",1140220800,11,4813,4.601169590643275
2022064,4,B0001OGVQ2,"The anticipation was high for this event. I couldn't wait until the day to see this PPV. It was a great night of course, as this event well exceeding my expectations as to what I was looking forward to seeing. I truly has begun again in every since of the word. Let's take a look back @ the event that was Wrestlemania XX. Here's my review:

Disc One Program

U.S. Title Match: John Cena vs. The Big Show, *1/2 (An average match, even though the crowd was into this one. Worth a look to see Cena win the US title for the first time.)

RAW World Tag Team Title Match: Booker T & Rob Van Dam vs. The Dudleys vs. La Resistance vs. Mark Jindrak & Garrison Cade, ** (Even though the tag team division is beyond dead in the WWE, this was a fairly good match, but nothing to write home about.)

Christian vs. Chris Jericho, ***1/2 (An extremely good match between these two. Trish's turn @ the end was a shocker by the way.)

Ric Flair, Batista & Randy Orton vs. The Rock & Mick Foley, ****1/4 (In what has to be the best handicap match ever, all 5 of these men had their working boots on for this match.)

Playboy Evening Gown Match: Torrie Wilson & Sable vs. Stacy Keibler & Miss Jackie, DUD (I'm pretty sure that the male fans will find this one entertaining. But for the workrate fans, feel free to skip this one.)

Cruiserweight Open: Chavo Guerrero, Jamie Noble, Funaki, Ultimo Dragon, Rey Mysterio, Nunzio, Tajiri, Shannon Moore & Billy Kidman, **(Wow, this could've been a classic if they played it right. As it turned out, even with all of this talent, it was merely average and quick.)

Bill Goldberg vs. Brock Lesnar with Steve Austin as guest referee, *1/2 (In what could've been a decent match, this was a total trainwreck of a match. The fans in attendance were well aware that Goldberg and Lesnar were on their way out of the WWE, and the fans let them have it.)

Smackdown Tag Team Championship Match: Scotty 2 Hotty & Rikishi vs. Basham Brothers vs. APA vs. Charlie Haas & Shelton Benjamin, *1/2 (Not better than the first tag team match, but that's not saying much.)

Disc Two- Program & Extras:

WWE Womens Championship Match: Victoria vs. Molly Holly, *1/2 (This is your standard women's match. Nothing to see here.)

WWE Championship: Eddie Guerrero (R.I.P.) vs. Kurt Angle, ****1/2 (What an awesome match between Angle and Eddie. Truly fantastic, and the ending was creative in a sense.)

Undertaker vs. Kane, *1/2 (The Deadman makes his return @ this event. The Undertaker's entrance was incredible.

WWE World Heavyweight Championship: Chris Benoit vs. Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels, ***** (The Match of the Year for 2004. What a classic that saw Benoit finally win the top title after so many years in the business. The ending with him and Eddie Guerrero is one classy moment.)

Smackdown gives us a good match to kick off WrestleMania. Not the best match on the card but also not the worst. It was cool to see cena win his first title,the U.S Title!

Rating: 75/100

Match #2 Raw Fatal Four way tag match

An average match that hade La Resististance,The Dudley boyz,Mark Jindrak & Garrison cade,and The champs RVD & Booker T.Although it was better than the Smackdown one,the match was to short but it was nice to see Booker T & Rvd Retain

Rating: 71/100

Match #3 Christain v.s Chris Jerico

A much better match than i thought. It had soo many near falls,near submissions,and best of all,In the end,IT HAD TRISH.Christain wins the match win Chris Jerico Is Screwed By Trish and is seen kissing with christain at the ramp moments later.

Rating: 82/100

Match #4 Rock & Sock Conecction v.s 3 members of Evolution.

IF YA SMELL WHAT THE ROCK AND SOCK IS COOKIN.Wow a very good match,i thout it would be an average match but i was wrong. A bit better than Christain v.s Chris Jerico,this matches only down fall was foley got pinned after only one RKO!It took an Rko on to barbie to beat him at Backlash and he alread had indured SOOOO much more. Great match.

Rating: 84/100

Match #5 Lingre match. I cant rate this but i can say this,WATCH IT OR ELSE!

Match #6 Cruiserweight Open

A very good display of high flying moves by all the cruiserweights involved. They are exlusive to smackdown and they showed us all here why smackdown is lucky to have them. There were two bad thing though. 1st,The match was Way to short and second,Rey got screwed!

Match Rating: 83/100

Match #7 Goldberg v.s Brock Lesner (read the whole thing)

WOW!A FAST PASED MATCH WITH MANY NEAR FALLS AND TONS OF HEAVYWEIGHT MOVES!did i mention that that is the EXACT OPPISITE OF THE MATCH!This match was slow pased,1 or 2 near falls,and they spent like 5 minutes in a staredown. Worst match of the night and most dissapointing!

Rating: 42/100

Match #8 Smackdown Fatal Four way tag Match

a not very goood match.worse than the Raw one. It was even shorter than the raw tag team match. It involved The World Greatest Tag Team,The APA,The Bashams and Scotty & Rikishi.

Rating: 66/100

Match #9 Victoria v.s Molly (losser get head shaved)

A good match for a womans title match. That other guy was right,the pinfall came out of no where. The best part was molly got her Head SHAVED!

Rating: 63/100

Match #10 WWE Title match Eddie Guerrero (c) V.s Kurt Angle

WOW!A great match from start to finish! Many many many near falls,a couple finishers,and the kicked out of many finishers. I Just loved the Middle. When Kurt Kicked out of the frog splash,Eddie kicked out of the Angle Slam. And he got Eddie Guerrero in the Ankle Lock. In the end I Really Thought Eddie was gonna tap when Kurt Angle Locked in the Ankle lock for the second time. Eddie Retained when Eddie untied his boot and Kurt Angle locked in the Ankle Lock and it slipped Eddie's Boot off and Eddie Guerrero Got the roll up tp Retain. What a match! He was Taunting Kurt Angle outside of the Ring after the match!

Rating: 92/100

Match #11 Undertaker v.s Kane

Nothing real special about the match but,Undertakers Entrance,now that was Special. It was a slow match about 13min long. Kane thoght he had Undertaker beat when he hit the Choke Slam but taker got up and gave him a Choke Slam and the a TombStone!

Rating: 78/100

The Main Event World Title match Chris Beniot V.s HBK v.s HHH(c)

OMG!One of the best matches ive seen in a long,long time! Many near falls,Many finishers,and there was even a table bump! Shawn Michales would have tapped out To The Crippler Crossface but Triple H Broke up the hold after holding his hand up so he couldent tap out. As i said,There was a table bumb when Chris Beniot was Suplexed Through the Spanish (As usual) Announce Table! This match Would have gotten Match of the Year if There wasn't The Hell In A Cell Match Shawn Michales V.s Triple H at Bad Blood. If this isn't on the top 5 wrestlemania matches ill be mad! if it's not even on the top ten (it easilly will be) I will sue WWE.Thes Three Superstars gave it there all but in the end,it was Chris Beniot who Made Triple H Tap to the CrossFace after about 1min who would Walk out as the NEW Wold Heavyweight Champion. After the match he and his long time Friend Eddie Guerrero celebrated on Eddie Guerrero Retaining The WWE Title And Chris Beniot,after all these years,finnally winning the World Heavyweight title. A legendary Match that you must watch!

2022097,5,B0001OGVQ2,"Cena vs. Big SHow

Decent big vs. small match to start the show off with but not the quality of WM21's opener. Still very watchable and entertaining however.

RATING: 74/100

World tag Title Fatal Fourway

Nice fast paced action with some hindrances that include it being a few minutes short and not enough real action. Still a good tag match

RATING: 72/100

Christian vs. Y2J

A mattch that had a great variety of all the good things required in a good mid-card match. The ending was perhaps not as good as if it could have been a clean victory, however that doesn't disturb this rating at all and still a highly enjoyable good wrestling match.

RATING: 84/100

Rock & Sock vs. Evolution

I found this match very entertaining and edge of the seat action. There were a few usual tag moments which tended to be slightly boring, but on the whole very entertaining and some good moves to finish off with. Close falls and a good RKO by Orton helped too.

RATING: 82/100

Lingerie MAtch

Although there was nothing special at all in this match the beginning and the changing from evening gown to lingerie was exciting, enjoyable and ""fun"". The rating for this one is basically purely on entertainment because of the lingerie.

RATING: 70/100

Cruiserweight Open

Here is a truly spectacular display of what the cruiserweights are capable of. This match was very fast paced and constant high-flying action all match. Some breath-taking moves and edge of the seat moments made this 10 minute match my pick of the mid-card. Obviously my only gripe is is the time which took away a high 80 or a 90 from the match.

RATING: 85/100

Brock Lesnar vs. Bill Goldberg

Main thing about this match is the great psychology. For me it was edge of the seat stuff when they decided to lock up and very entertaining. Some close nearfalls after a finisher also helped. The only problem here is that the match was quite slow paced and yes, this match was not up to either of these men's true potentisl. Still a highly enjoyable, intensen match though.

RATING: 82/100

WWE Tag Team Title Fatal Fourway

Very short tag match that had very few big moments. Nothing special for a high in the card tag match. Nice to see the Too Cool dance by Rikishi and Scotty Too Hotty, very entertaining!

RATING: 67/100

Victoria vs. Moll y Holly

Not a bad wrestling match that I though could get a very high score right up unitil a pinfall came out of absolutely nowhere! I was sitting back and all of a sudden the beel rings and the match is over. Definitely hindered a decent wrestling match.

RATING: 63/100

Kurt Angle vs. Eddie Guererro

Truly oustanding match from start to finish! There was intense mat wrestling from both of these 2 technical experts and great high-flying from Eddie. Some nail biting nearfalls and intense ankle locks really made this match a classic tah ti have remebered since last year. Outstanding match that just could have been 5 minutes longer

RATING: 93/100

Undertaker vs. Kane

Great entrance from the Phenom and match nothing much to speak of other than it basically being quite good not great. Still great to see the real Undertaker back!

RATING: 77/100

Benoit vs. HBK vs. HHH

Absolutely amazing match that had it all. Length perfect, ending perfect and variuous high-flying moves to make this one of the best main events I have ever seen. I think that it is the best main event that has been (other than HBK vs. HHH [HIAC]) on since I have started watching. Superb

RATING: 95/100

79% - Absolutely terrific Wrestlemania that was a complete show with 7 title defenses and every single one of them was well done. Capped off by two near perfect main events.

Outstanding PPV!",1133049600,,3680,4.649612403100775
2022098,4,B0001OGVQ2,"I saw this wrestlemania last year at a friend's house on pay-per-view. When it came out on dvd, I immediately bought it, Being that i wanted to own this show so bad. This show was quite good and the only reason i don't give it that 5th star is because of the extreme dissapointment that came with the Goldberg-Lesnar match. Anyway, Here's my opinions on all the matches of this card:

1. For the WWE U.S. title
Champion The big show vs. John cena
This was a bad way to start the show. The match was boring and the moves weren't really that impressive at all. Skip this match. As interesting as Cena's raps are, It's just too bad that he isn't that good of a wrestler. In fact, I'm still waiting to see a match from Cena that's better than his debut wwe match he had against kurt angle on an episode of smackdown back in 2002. Cena wins the u.s. title from the big show. It's amazing that at the very next wrestlemania, Which took place this year, John Cena would become the wwe champion. *1/2

2. Fatal 4 way match for the WWE world tag team titles
Champions Booker T & Rob Van Dam Vs. The Dudley Boyz Vs. La Resistance Vs. Mark Jindrak & Garrison Cade
This match was ok. This match did feature some great action from RVD and it is an improvement over the opening match. It's watchable. Booker & RVD retain the tag titles in this one. ***1/2

3. Chris Jericho Vs. Christian
Oh man! Why was this great match put on so early? This match was filled with excitement and great action. Both Jericho and Christian did an awesome job with this match and this is certainly one of the best matches on this show. Christian wins in a very shocking way. *****

4. 3 on 2 handicap match
The Rock n sock Connection vs. Evolution [Randy Orton, Ric Flair, & Batista]
The Rock and Mick Foley reunited their tag team to take on evolution last year. Well, This match was alright. At least i was able to make it through this match without falling asleep and i take that into consideration a lot. Evolution won when Randy Orton pinned Mick Foley following an RKO. Batista would go on to become the world champion at this year's wrestlemania. Randy Orton became the world champion just months later at last year's summerslam when he defeated Chris Benoit, Who would win the world title later on in the main event of this show. ***

5. Playboy Evening Gown match
Sable & Torrie Wilson vs. Stacy Kiebler & Miss Jackie
If you seen one evening gown match, You've seen them all. Skip. Sable & Torrie won, But i don't think nobody really cared. No stars

6. Cruiserweight Open Invitational match
Champion Chavo Guerrero Vs. Billy Kidman Vs. Rey Mysterio Vs. Ultimo Dragon Vs. Nunzio Vs. Shannon Moore Vs. Tajiri Vs. Jamie Knoble Vs. Akio Vs. Funaki
Now this is what i'm talking about! This match was very exciting and it had many great impressive high flying moves to really catch a wrestling fan's attention. These 9 cruiserweights really did a great job with this match. Full of great fast-paced high flying action, This match is a definite highlight of this wrestlemania. Chavo retains the title with help from his father, Chavo sr. I would've liked it even more if Mysterio Or Kidman or Tajiri won this match, But oh well, This match is already excellent as it is! *****

7. Goldberg Vs. Brock Lesnar
Special Referee: Stone Cold Steve Austin
This was 1 of the matches i looked forward to seeing at this wrestlemania. Unfortunately, This match really failed to live up to its hype. The match went far too slow and let's face it, There was absolutely no reason for these 2 guys to stay in a tie up for over 4 minutes!!! There was very limited action in this match and if you haven't seen this match but wanna see this match, Don't bother. Trust me, This match is nowhere near as good as you probably are expecting it to be. 2nd worst match on this event. Only reason this even gets a star is because it's better than that stupid evening gown match that took place earlier. Other than that, A big waste of time. Unfortunately, This was the last night that either of these guys appeared in the WWE. What a dissapointing end to both of these guys wrestling careers. Goldberg won. *

8. Fatal 4 way match for the WWE world tag team titles
Champions Scotty 2 hotty & Rikishi Vs. The Acolytes Vs. Shelton Benjamin & Charlie Haas vs. The basham brothers
This match was decent. It wasn't as good as raw's fatal 4 way tag match, But hey, It was WAY better than that last match before it. Scotty & Rikishi retain the tag titles in this match. 1 thing that is unbelievable is that Bradshaw would win the wwe world title just a few months later after this match. **1/2

9. For the WWE women's title
Champion Victoria Vs. Molly Holly
This match was watchable to say the least. It's better than most women's matches that take place in the WWE today and to be able to say that, That's enough for me to give this match an average rating. Victoria retains the belt and as a stipulation, Molly's Hair gets shaved. **1/2

10. For the WWE world title
Champion Eddie Guerrero Vs. Kurt Angle
This was a great match! Two of the best wrestlers in the WWE today put on an awesome match. The action was very impressive, It was fast-paced, The wrestling was very unpredictable, And the match was never boring. These 2 always put on a good show when they're in the ring against each other. If you're a fan of either of these guys, You should most definitely watch this match. I guarantee you will love it. Even has an awesome ending courtesy of Guerrero. Guerrero retains the title. ***** [Best match on the event]

11. The Undertaker Vs. Kane
This match wasn't really that good. It was too one-sided and it was a little too short. I was only able to get through this match with ease because it was the return of The Undertaker, Who's 1 of my all-time favorites. **1/2

12. Triple Threat Match for the World Title
Champion Triple H Vs. Shawn Michaels Vs. Chris Benoit
This was a great main event. The wrestling was good, The match wasn't no longer than what it needed to be, And something that was long overdue finally happened at the end of this match. This match was very entertaining and all 3 of the wrestlers in this match gave it their all. This match never got boring and the more it went on, The more i anticipated its ending. To my [And hopefully, Many fans] Delight, Benoit forced Triple H to tap out to the crossface and he finally became the world title. You can really tell that Benoit truly wanted that belt, Being that he even went as far as to cry at the end of this match. And it was quite an emotional moment when Benoit And Guerrero hugged each other and cryed together as the world champions of the WWE. It's a shame that they had to lose their belts to Randy Orton and Bradshaw. These 2 guys should have, In my opinion, spent the rest of last year as champions. An awesome main event and a great way to end this show. *****

All in all, This was a good wrestlemania. Right about now, This wrestlemania and all the other wrestlemanias can be found in a box set that was just released by the WWE. You have 2 choices, You can buy the entire box set which has all of the first 21 wrestlemanias, and believe me, That box set is extremely expensive, or You can take the cheaper, Smarter way out and buy the box set by individual 5-set volumes [Which cost about $50-60 a piece]. This wrestlemania was great. WWE fans should like this wrestlemania a lot. Well, I hope my review helped. Be blessed.",1131580800,2,7455,4.397389412617839

Let's review the matches:

1- John Cena vs Big Show- VERY Boring match. It just had Big Show dominating for about 10 minutes until John Cena pulled of the FU, hit Big Show with a knuck, and another FU for the win. Big Show got very little damage, but was down for the 3 count. This was to amuse the fans. 2/10

2- La Resistance vs Dudley Boys vs Mark Jindrak & Garrison Cade vs RVD and Booker T- Very obvious Booker and RVD would win. Nobody else stands a chance and if they won, their reign would last a few weeks. Very good movoes by RVD, he turned it up a notch. 8/10

3- Christian vs Chris Jericho- This seems like a match that was intended for the Goldberg vs Brock Lesnar. This match didn't have too much hype, but the fight lasted WAY longer than expected. 3/10

4- Rock & Sock Connection Vs Batista, Ric Flair & Randy Orton- This is the only match out of two that I liked. Every other match the crowd had no emotion. This one was perfect, disappointing ending, but WWE is unpredictable. This is the match that awakened the crowd. 9.5/10

5- Playboy Evening Gown Match:Torrie Wilson & Sable Vs Stacy Keibler & Miss Jackie- Quite boring, even though I get a kick out of Stacy Keibler, this match seems like one for teens that can't control their hormones. 1/10

6- Cruiserweight Open-Cruiserweight Title-Chavo Guerrero(C)Vs Ultimo Dragon Vs Shannon Moore Vs Jamie Noble Vs Funaki Vs Nunzio Vs Billy Kidman Vs Rey Mysterio Vs Tajiri Vs Akio- Terrific match, very high risk manuevers done, very exciting. We get to see the Tajiri Mist, the fan favorite that is rarely seen. Good ending. 6.5/10

7- Special Referee-Stone Cold Steve Austin-Goldberg Vs Brock Lesnar- ABSOLUTELY THE WORST MATCH OF THE NIGHT. I, LIKE SO MANY OTHERS, EXPECTED THIS TO BE A STREET FIGHT STYLE MATCH. INSTEAD, IT WAS A SLOW PACED MATCH, LIKE BIG SHOW VS ANOTHER GIANT, WHERE NOTHING COULD BE DONE. HORRIBLE MATCH. (Rumor has it that Brock Lesnar, because this was his last match, didn't care about the crowd so he did not memorize all of his actions in this match, which resulted in improvising, which doesn't work well in the WWE). I only liked the ending, where Stone Cold stunned Lesnar. 0.5/10

8- Match Eight-Fatal Fourway-Tag Team Championships-Rikishi & Scotty 2 Hotty Vs The Bashams Vs The APA Vs Charlie Haas & Shelton Benjamin- Great match, very tense. I expected APA to Win, but Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty did. They didn't get much hype, but hey, that's the only acceptable WWE Tag Team around. 6/10

9- Victoria Vs Molly- Vince... I know Molly is quite good looking.. but don't bore the entire crowd by making such a boring, useless match. 1/10

10- Eddie Guerrero Vs Kurt Angle- Great match, beginning was hard to get into, but the ending made it very thrilling and that's what a crowd likes. 7/10

11- Undertaker vs Kane- Lots of hype, very little action. Seems like a decent match from SmackDown! or RAW. Sort of like the Goldberg vs Lesnar, only a bit more action. 2/10

12- Chris Benoit vs Shawn Michaels vs Triple H- The only good match of the night. Obviously, Chris Benoit would win because he won the Rumble (That's how WWE works), but it was still a good match because for once, there was lots of action and tension. 9/10

Match One-US Championship-Big Show(C)Vs John Cena-This was a average opener to the show. Every match with Big Show is going to be slow but this shouldn't have opened it up. The match was average but a bit to short still an alright match. My rating 5.57/10.

Match Two-Fatal Four Way-World Tag Team Championships-RVD & Booker T(C)Vs La Resistance Vs Mark Jindrak & Garrison Cade Vs The Dudleys-This was the better of the two tag team matches and I believe this was the only one which should have been used. Everyone put on a great perfomance especially RVD. My rating 6.12/10.

Match Three-Christian Vs Y2J-This was a good match between the ex best friends. It told a story and it didn't have a clean finish which is good because this great feud can continue. My rating 7.53/10.

Match Four-Handicap Match-Rock & Sock Connection Vs Batista, Ric Flair & Randy Orton. This was Wrestlemania, this is what the other matches should be like. This told a story. It wasn't to long, it wasn't short. It was perfect match doing what it needed to do. My rating 7.89/10.

Match Five-Interpromotional Match-Playboy Evening Gown Match-Torrie Wilson & Sable Vs Stacy Keibler & Miss Jackie-This was terrible it lasted about a minute and it was abismal. Take this off Wrestlemania. My rating 0/10.

Match Six-Cruiserweight Open-Cruiserweight Title-Chavo Guerrero(C)Vs Ultimo Dragon Vs Shannon Moore Vs Jamie Noble Vs Funaki Vs Nunzio Vs Billy Kidman Vs Rey Mysterio Vs Tajiri Vs Akio-This was a good match except it was a gauntlet match. It showed many high flying manuevers from many of the finest cruiserweights around. Good match with a bad ending. This should have been like a 10 man Elimination with everyone in the ring at once with no rules. My rating 7.42/10.

Match Seven-Interpromotional Match-Special Referee-Stone Cold Steve Austin-Goldberg Vs Brock Lesnar-This was boring as anything  for the first eight minutes or so. This was supposedly the most hyped match but it was a really big dud. This was both mens last match in the company and I'm glad cause this wasn't pretty to watch. My rating 4/10.

Match Eight-Fatal Fourway-Tag Team Championships-Rikishi & Scotty 2 Hotty(C)Vs The Bashams Vs The APA Vs Charlie Haas & Shelton Benjamin-This was nowhere near as good as the Raw Fourway. It shouldn't have been the same match it could have been elimation or something like that. My rating 5.84/10.

Match Nine-Title Vs Hair Match-Womens Title-Victoria(C)Vs Molly-Molly loses she gets her head shaved,Molly wins she gets the title. This was an alright match better then most womens matches but still this wasn't great. My rating 4.12/10.

Match Ten-WWE Championship-Eddie Guerrero(C)Vs Kurt Angle-This was an awesome match with Eddie lieing,cheating & stealing and Kurt doing his suplexes and all his moves. This match told a story, a story of betrayal and it worked very well. My rating 7.77/10.

Match Eleven-Interpromotional Match-Kane Vs Undertaker-This was Undertakers return and it was very good. The entrance, the look of Taker, everything about it was great. The match wasn't as good as their Wrestlemania XIV match but it was alright, it did what it was meant to. My rating 6.70/10.

Match Twelve-Main Event-Triple Threat-World Heavyweight Championship-HHH(C)VS Shawn""HBK""Michaels Vs Chris Benoit-This was an exceptional match with three great wrestlers going at it in a bloody brawl. This match was the best way possible to end Wrestlemania. My rating 8.89/10.

The overall score for this show is 718.50 out of 1200. Which is equivalent to 59.87% which is eqivalent to C+. This deserved a B- but with the dud matches of Goldberg/Lesnar & the Playboy match it duddened it.

WRESTLEMANIA 2004:

John Cena VS the Big Show (United States Championship) - 6.5/10

This match was nothing special. Had a few good spots but a boring match for the most part.

Booker T & RVD VS the Dudley Boys VS La Resistance VS Mark Jindrak & Garrison Cade (World Tag Team Championship) - 7/10

Again nothing special. A good performance from RVD.

Christian VS Chris Jericho - 7/10

This match was a bit disappointing, kind of a match you would see on television not wrestlemania. Has a good ending though.

Evolution VS Rock 'n' Sock Connection - 9/10

Definitely the match we were waiting for! This felt like a wrestlemania match and Mick Foley put on a great performance. Nothing very hardcore but the match was very exciting.

Torrie Wilson & Sable VS Stacy Keibler & Miss Jackie - 2/10

This was a waste of time to be honest, deserves 2 just because it was a playboy evening gown match.

The Cruiserweight Open (Cruiserweight Championship) - 9/10

This match was kind of short but was very good. Some amazing action from the cruiserweights and Billy Kidman did some unbelievable moves.

Goldberg VS Brock Lesnar - 2/10

The worst match of the night and the worst match I've seen in a long time. This match deserved the BORING chants it got from the crowd and I gave it 2 only because of Austin's stunner on Lesnar.

Scotty 2 Hotty & Rikishi VS the Basham Brothers VS APA VS the Self-Proclaimed World's Greatest Tag Team (WWE Tag Team Championship) - 6/10

I didn't like the idea of two 4 way tag team matches in one night and this one was disappointing. The first one was way better and this had no good moments. Just an average smackdown match.

Victoria VS Molly Holly (Women's Championship) - 2.5/10

Basically your average women's match, very boring.

Eddie Guerrero VS Kurt Angle (WWE Championship) - 7.5/10

This was pretty good match. Nothing amazing but still good.

Undertaker VS Kane - 7/10

To be honest I expected more out of the match, the match was pretty disappointing but undertaker's return was one of the best moments of the night. The atmosphere in the crowd was great and I gave this 7 because of his return.

Chris Benoit VS Triple H VS Shawn Michaels (World Heavyweight Championship) - 9.5/10

Like the rock and sock match, this match lived up to its hype. Definitely felt like a wrestlemania main event. Thank god there was another great match in this poor wrestlemania.

SCORE: 75/120 (62.5/100)

According to the key I have rated wrestlemania as 'Good', a satisfying PPV and you could perhaps buy this if you really feel you want it. This is accurate. Nothing amazing from wrestlemania.

Here's a match by match opinion review:Big Show vs John Cena:Extremely slow match, with many rest holds, but ends with a hot ending to get the crowd hyped up. 2/5 starsFour Way Raw Tag Title Match:Had some good spots, and was entertaining, but wrestling wise, not that great. 2/5 starsChris Jericho vs Christian:Excellent match that showed their wrestling skills and told a good story. Great surprise ending as well. 4/5 starsRock/Foley vs EvolutionThis match was very entertaining. This isn't your catch as catch can style match, but definetely does it's duty. 3/5 starsEvening Gown Match:Don't get me wrong, the divas are super hot, but this was pointless. Eye candy for the crowd. 1/5 starsCruiserWeight Open:Sounded great on paper, and had some extremely good spots and moves, but Chavo retaining the way he did was a joke. 3/5 starsGoldberg vs Lesnar:No one expected this to be a great wrestling match, and it wasn't. But as far as the crowd reactions and austin as ref, this match was entertaining at best. 2.5/5 starsFour Way SD! Tag Titles:Had some good spots, and was slightly better than the Raw tag match. 2.5/5 starsVictoria vs Molly:Probably two of the best divas as far as wrestling goes. 3/5 starsEddie vs Angle:These two always give it there all and tell one heck of a story in the ring. Could watch these two all day long. 4/5 starsTaker vs Kane:Not the best big man match, but told an excellent story and continued Taker's unbeaten Mania Streak. Many fans were dissappointed that taker didn't come back totally as the old school taker, ie gray gloves, gray chin guards, outfit, etc. 3/5 starsTriple Threat Match:Excellent matchup that saw 3 of the WWE's best square off. Tons of great spots that had you on the edge of your seat. Almost everyone was rooting for Benoit, and during the match, you get that sinking feeling that HHH is going to get the win somehow, and Thank God he didn't. Couldn't have ended any better.

2022189,3,B0001OGVQ2,"Personally, I thought Wrestlemania XX was one of the biggest mixed bags of good and horrible I've ever seen in wrestling.  I'll review the card and explain this description.

Match 1 - The Big Show (C) vs. John Cena: US Championship (SD)

Overall this was a good match to start the show with.  It was painfully obvious that Cena was going to win, but it was still good.  My ionly real knock on this match is that Big Show was ruined.  A guy half his size was able to give him aDeath Valley Driver (FU) TWICE without much difficulty and I know he did it at least twice on TV prior to this show.  In this day and age, slamming big super heavyweights means nothing.  Hulk slamming Andre was special, Luger slamming Yokozuna was special, but nobody cares about this because A) Big Show has been slammed 14 dozen times by smaller guys and B) John Cena had already done it before.  OK that's my rant about the poor use of big men in wrestling today.  Other than that this was a nice fun match with an expected title change.

Match 2 - RVD/Booker T (c) vs. La Resistance vs. Dudley Boyz vs. Cade/Jindrak: Raw Tag Team Championship

Utterly depressing to see Booker T and RVD going for tag team gold as they are both clearly above it.  Anyways this match was only an excuse to cram 8 guys onto the card, but was good for what it was.  Booker and RVD retained, but I think I would have given it to La Resistance.

Match 3 - Chris Jericho vs. Christian (Raw)

I wasn't a big fan of the Love Triangle with these two and Trish (I've seen way too many of them) but this match was quite good.  It's certainly the best match on the undercard, and I'd say it's the second best on the card as a whole.  These two really worked well together, and it would be the first of several good matches that these two would have in 2004.  Trish's turn on Jericho was expected and nicely done.  My only knock on this match, and it isn't even really a knock on the match, but it marked Jericho's 3rd Wrestlemania loss in a row.  Poor Chris.  Very good match.

JOHN CENA defeated THE BIG SHOW to Win the United States Championship: I knew this match would be early on the card, but I'm unsure how wise it was to choose it as the opener. Bret vs Owen, this wasn't!!! It was 9 minutes of predominantly slow-paced action that The Big Show dominated for the most part, until the final few moments. Good finish which didn't hurt either wrestler's credibility, as Cena got the win with his knucks. Decent enough bout, but not quite the special opening to WrestleMania 20 that I was expecting. Match Rating...6

ROB VAN DAM / BOOKER T defeated THE DUDLEY BOYZ, LA RESISTANCE & MARK JINDRAK / GARRISON CADE in a Fatal Fourway Tag Match to Retain the World Tag-Team Titles: I stand corrected regarding my choice of openers last week, as this bout didn't do anything more than the U.S Title bout. At 7 minutes, this was far too sort in both length & excitement. At the very least, we should have seen the tables come out from under the ring!!! Like the opener, it was decent enough, but just a little too ho-hum for my liking. What's worse, is that none of the teams really came out of the match with their reputations enhanced. Match Rating...6

CHRISTIAN defeated CHRIS JERICHO: Very good 15 minute match, despite a clearly botched top-rope move during it. Excellently paced, and a good combination of the 2 wrestlers' spots, plus a few different moves. It was also an effective mixture of mat & high-flying wrestling, which should leave these 2 in a good position to break through toward a main event standing. The match did lack a little in psychology, but nothing in intensity. The ending was well booked, if a little predictable. While the aftermath (including the Trish Stratus heel turn) was also well done. A good job, all around. Match Rating...8

RANDY ORTON, RIC FLAIR & BATISTA defeated MICK FOLEY & THE ROCK in a Handicap Match: Excellent decision to have this bout placed here on the card, as it got the MSG crowd seriously pumped up. And what a very good match it was too. Extremely entertaining, and the 17 minutes that it lasted for, seemed to fly by. Everyone did their job well, with Flair being the usual barrel of laughs. If there can be such a thing, this was the most organized of disorganized messes that I've ever seen. Very well booked & performed, this actually was a lot better than what I thought it would be. I guess charisma does go a long way in professional wrestling. Match Rating...8

WWE HALL OF FAME SEGMENT: This lasted 8 minutes, which was longer than 4 of the matches, so it deserves to be included in the overall 'PPV Rating'. Very nicely put together mixture of live action, and taped footage from the ceremony the night before. Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan's words were very emotional, while the whole segment was put together with excellent thought behind it. I liked the way it achieved it's purpose, without overshadowing any of the current happenings. Good stuff. Segment Rating...7

TORRIE WILSON & SABLE defeated STACY KEIBLER & JACKIE GAYDA: Well, the evening gown match didn't last too long, as everyone stripped down to their underwear before the match could start. We ended up having a normal tag match, and it's arguable which way was the correct to go. I don't think it really mattered at the end of the day. Nothing we haven't seen before, but I guess it's been a while. Kudos to the WWE for keeping it so short (3 or 5 minutes, depending on at what point you consider the match to have started). Entertaining enough, so it did it's job to pass. Match Rating...5

CHAVO GUERRERO defeated 9 OTHER CRUISERWEIGHTS in a Cruiserweight Open to Retain the WWE Cruiserweight Championship: For those interested, this ended up being a gauntlet match, where Chavo (as the champion) was automatically given the #10 spot. Ok, whose idea was this!?!?!? What on Earth were they thinking when they decided to have 8 pinfalls in 11 minutes? What the hell were they thinking not using arguably 2 of the most talented cruiserweights on the entire roster (Akio & Paul London)? I suppose the writing was on the wall when Ultimo Dragon almost slipped on his a$$ during his entrance!!! It was actually Billy Kidman, of all people, who brought the most excitement to this match. That shooting star press to the outside gave me nightmares of Brock Lesnar last year. When it came down to Rey vs Chavo so early on, I was expecting about 10 minutes of action similar to their 'No Way Out' bout. I almost threw something at my tv, when Chavo pinned Rey (again) uncleanly approximately 2 minutes later. Not exactly terrible, but we were owed something special from the cruiserweights tonight, and these guys could have got it done if they were allowed to. Match Rating...6

BILL GOLDBERG defeated BROCK LESNAR with Stone Cold Steve Austin as the Special Referee: Boy, this was a difficult match to get into. In fact, I never got into it at all. In my opinion, the start was poorly booked. A slow intense test of strength would have been fine in normal circumstances, but this was anything but normal circumstances. Surely, the WWE would have known that the crowd were going to react in that way towards both wrestlers!?!?!? They should have got the action started immediately & at least tried to make the fans concentrate on the actual bout. But they went the slow & methodical route, and pretty much continued it for the 13 minute duration of the match. Goldberg won cleanly, and Austin stunned both of them afterwards. I never thought I would say this, but I think I would have preferred the rumored 'No Contest' finish!!! Match Rating...5

RIKISHI / SCOTTY 2 HOTTY defeated CHARLIE HAAS / SHELTON BENJAMIN, BRADSHAW / FAAROOQ & DOUG / DANNY BASHAM to Retain the WWE Tag-Team Championships: Can I simply write ""See comments on the Raw Tag Title match"" & leave it at that...??? Seriously, it was almost a carbon copy. It also lasted 7 minutes. It also had the face champs retain the titles. And it was also decent, but nothing special. Could have, and should have, been much better. Match Rating...6

VICTORIA defeated MOLLY HOLLY in a 'Hair vs Title' Match to retain the WWE Women's Title: I can't believe that the WWE only gave this bout 5 minutes. It was a near 5 hour show, for goodness sake!!! I felt like I had been transported back to 1990, when short matches such as this were normal on big pay-per-views. The worst thing was that the pace of this bout suggested that it was at least going to last 10 minutes. If the match was only going to go 5 minutes, then why didn't we see a fast-paced & spot-oriented match!?!?!? Very disappointing & hard to rate. Bring on Eddie & Kurt to get this ppv back on track. Oh, and by the way, Molly was surprisingly shaved completely bald after the match. Match Rating...5

EDDIE GUERRERO defeated KURT ANGLE to Retain the WWE Championship: Not the main event & nowhere near 30 minutes in length (it ended up being 22). This was unfortunately not the match of the year contender that I was expecting. The MSG crowd behaved very strangely here. They were fairly quiet & there was only one ""Eddie"" chant throughout the whole match!!! In fact, they were behind Kurt, if anything. Now, I don't want any of you guys complaining if Eddie gets depushed because of this!!! The match itself was technically very good, but it had far too few exciting (or memorable) moments. The ending was very cleverly booked though, with Eddie undoing his boot laces, to slip out of the anklelock. I suppose we often have to look past pre-match expectations, and when all was said & done, this was still a very good match. Match Rating...8

THE UNDERTAKER defeated KANE: Apart from the ever-annoying voice of Paul Bearer, my first impression of the returning dead-man was that he looked like Desperado. He should have rode in on a horse!!! The match itself was pretty much as predicted. Kudos to the WWE for keeping it fairly short at 8 minutes in length. And I suppose everything that should have happened during that time, did. But overall, there was an uneasy mix of everything about The Undertaker. The look, the characteristics, and especially the wrestling style. It just didn't quite gel. While the match was far from a total disgrace, I do worry about the upcoming months when it pertains to the dead man. Match Rating...6

CHRIS BENOIT defeated TRIPLE H & SHAWN MICHAELS in a Triple Threat Match to Win the World HeavyWeight Title: Excellent & memorable match where all 3 combatants brought close to their best. Right from the beginning of the bout, Chris Benoit looked his intense & crisp self, while HBK & Triple H stepped it up a notch or two from their 2004 performances thus far (they were a lot more effective here, than at The Royal Rumble). At 25 minutes in length, this wasn't the most perfectly paced match. Nor was it a technical masterpiece (which I would have preferred that they tried for in the first 8-10 minutes). But I suppose that is the inherent problem with Triple Threat matches. What it undoubtedly was though, was exciting, entertaining & memorable. A superb finish capped it all off very well. Great stuff!!! Match Rating...9

PPV RATING (85/130) = 65

Looking at the key, I have basically given 'WrestleMania 20' a 'B' grade & said that it was a 'good event that was worth the money'. Overall, I only just agree with that comment & grade. But then again, it only just fell into that rating range. Honestly, I was a little disappointed with the pay-per-view. But not for the reason that others are. Many other people are disappointed because there were no huge surprises, turns or special appearances. That didn't bother me, because I wasn't really expecting any. Remember that the WWE did not promise these, so why should we have necessarily expected them?

No, I was disappointed because the WWE didn't seem to prioritize wrestling (or entertainment) quality in their 12 matches. When all was said & done, only 4 matches rated above 6 out of 10. That's basically saying that the other 8 matches were pretty much decent television matches, and nothing more. That's not a great WrestleMania strike rate, in my opinion. Furthermore, the Women's, Cruiserweight & both Tag-Team divisions, came out of this pay-per-view looking worse than what they came in. That's an opportunity missed by the WWE to advance these divisions.

As it turned out, I had no problem with the increased length of the pay-per-view. But in retrospect, 2 of the matches (probably one of the tag-team matches & the women's title bout) should have been taken off the card, and quality should have been favored over quantity.",1114732800,,11147,4.681307456588356

1: WWE United States Championship: Big Show Vs. John Cena
Big Show gave the Doctor of Thuganomics a couple of good shots, but Cena managed to beat him after 2 FUs. The first one Show kicked out of, but John hit the 2nd one after striking Show w/ one of his Word Life brass knuckles. 4/5

2: World Tag Team Championship: Fatal Four Way Match: Rob Van Dam/Booker T Vs. Dudley Boyz Vs. Garrison Cade/Mark Jindrak Vs. La Resistance
Decent match, with Booker and RVD retaining the gold. 3/5

3: Chris Jericho Vs. Christian
Great match between the former friends. The CLB wins after Trish interferes and accidentally hits Jericho, allowing Christian to roll up Y2J for the 3 count. This would be the start of Trish's heel run. 4/5

4: 2-3 Handicap Tag Team Match: The Rock and Mick Foley Vs. Evolution (Randy Orton, Ric Flair, and Batista)
The Rock returns to the ring to team up with Rock and Sock tag team partner Mick Foley. While the Rock electrified the crowd w/ the People's Elbow (and adding in his version of Flair's strut for good measure), he and Foley lose after Randy hits the RKO on Foley (who tried to use Socko). 5/5

5: Playboy Evening Gown Match: Sable and Torrie Wilson Vs. Stacy Keibler and Miss Jackie
The Raw and SmackDown divas never cease to amaze me. Even though the 4 of them don't really wrestle, I loved the match. Instead of having to defeat each other by tearing off their gowns, Sable suggests that they all take their gowns off and wrestle without them (in lingerie). All of the divas are all for it, except Miss Jackie, who had to have hers torn off by Torrie and Sable. After a few near falls (some very nice rollups), Torrie pins Miss Jackie, giving her and Sable the win. 5/5

6: WWE Cruiserweight Championship Open: Chavo Guerrero Vs. Jamie Noble Vs. Funaki Vs. Ultimo Dragon Vs. Rey Mysterio Vs. Nunzio Vs. Tajiri Vs. Shannon Moore Vs. Billy Kidman
A pretty fast-paced match, but I think it was over too quick. Chavo ends up retaining the title after his dad helps him pin Rey Mysterio. 3/5

7: Goldberg Vs. Brock Lesnar: Special Guest Referee: ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin
It's not as bad as some people have said. Sure they didn't do much for a moment, but they started to battle later. Goldberg wins after a Spear and Jackhammer. Austin then stuns Lesnar and Goldberg. 4/5

8: WWE Tag Team Championship: Fatal Four Way Match: Scotty 2 Hotty and Rikishi Vs. APA Vs. Basham Brothers Vs. Benjamin/Haas
Same comments as Raw match, the champions retain their titles. 3/5

9: WWE Women's Championship: Victoria Vs. Molly Holly
If Molly loses this, she gets her head shaved. Molly tries to use Victoria's Widow's Peak, but Victoria counters w/ a backslide pin, thus winning the match. Molly tries to escape from Victoria, but it's to no avail. Molly got what she deserved. A very close shave, you could say. lol 4/5

10: WWE Championship Match: Eddie Guerrero Vs. Kurt Angle
A great match. Eddie and Kurt pulled out all of their best moves in this one. I thought the match was over when Eddie hit the frog splash. Unfortunately, Kurt kicked out. Eddie would retain his title after cheating (unlacing his boot) and rolling up Kurt. 5/5

11: Undertaker Vs. Kane
Not their best match, but close. It was also a little rushed. Taker's new look is okay, but I prefer his 1999 Deadman look. Kane would fall to the Taker after getting the Tombstone. 3/5

12: World Heavyweight Championship: Triple Threat Match: Triple H Vs. Chris Benoit Vs. Shawn Michaels
These 3 are some of the best superstars in the WWE today, although I'm not a fan of H-Boy. There were times when 2 of the men would briefly team up (HHH and HBK suplex Benoit through an announce table), but still it was every man for himself. The 3 men gave all they had in this match, and eventually Benoit would win after putting the Crossface on H-Boy, making him tap out. After the match, Eddie would come out and embrace his friend for his victory. 5/5",1112745600,,4077,4.539509536784741

My Favorive Matches on the card

WWE Championship Match

Eddie Gurrerro (Champion) vs. Kurt Angle

This was one of the best matches on the card. Eddie and Kurt work so well together.

World Heavyweight Championship

Chris Benoit vs. HBK vs. HHH (Champion)

For nearly 18 years Benoit has tried to win the big one. And he did. Possibly one of the best matches and one of the greatest wrestlemania moments in recent years.

Jericho vs. Christian

Was a good match. The end was unexpected but still great match by these 2 former intercontinetal champions.

The Rock and Sock Connection vs. Evolution

Great match by Mick and the Rock. Randy is becoming one of the best wrestlers on Raw.

WORST MATCH

Diva Tag Team Ligurne Match

Horrible waste of time

Goldberg vs. Lesner

2022225,5,B0001OGVQ2,"Overall, this was the greatest Wrestling event ever. It was suspensful, surprising, and exciting. Besides the matches, their were amazing promos and the interviews were pretty good. Here are the matches:

1. John Cena vs. Big Show  8/10

US Title on line. Match went pretty slow but John Cena made the match good with his F-U''s on Big Show, to win the match.

2. Fatal 4-way for World Tag Team Championships 7.5/10

RVD and Booker T vs. Renee Dupree and Rob Conway vs. Mark Jindrak and Garrison Cade vs. D-Von and Bubba Ray Dudley

This match had its moments, but overall, it wasn't the greatest match. The ending was pretty entertaining with Booker T hitting the scissors kicka and RVD hitting the Frog Splash to win it.

3. Christian vs. Chris Jericho 9/10

This match was really exciting. Both guys gave it their all and did some really nice high-flying moves. Surprise ending when Trish Stratus comes out and",1111622400,,913,4.69811320754717
2022226,4,B0001OGVQ2,"Overall this was an excellent event. It was a little over-hyped though. Most off the matches were completly rushed as well, but they were still good. Here are the matches.

 1. John Cena vs. The Big Show 8/10

A really good opener, but no 10/10 because it went a little to slow, but you can't really expect the Big Show to go fast. The ending is amazing when John Cena does the FU on the Big Show to get the victory. John Cena also became the new WWE United States Champion that night.

 2. Rob Van Dam and Booker T vs. Rene Dupree and Robert Conway vs. Mark Jindrak and Garrison Cade vs. D-Von and Bubba Ray Dudley 7/10

This was a pretty good match, and it was entertaining. The problem was that it went kind of slow until the last few minutes. Booker T was literally in the ring the whole time until almost the end when it started going crazy. Rob Van Dam hits a five star frog splash on Rob Conway to get the victory and to retain.

 3. Christian vs. Chris Jericho 9/10

A really good match. Good wrestling finally came from both men here. I was really impressed with Christian because I did not think he could do it. The ending is really suprising when Trish comes to the ring and makes it look like she is helping Jericho, when she is really not. Trish slaps Jericho REALLY HARD and then Christian some neat move. Christian and Trish walk away together and then kiss, while Jericho looks on from the ring looking furious. Big suprise to me. Good match do not skip.

 4. Randy Orton, Batista, and Ric Flair vs. Mick Foley and The Rock (Handicap Match) 10/10

An excellent match. Its kind of hard to explain everything that happened but some of the good parts was when The Rock punched Ric Flair really hard in the mouth because he said WHOOO! to him. Another kind of funny part was when Batista or somebody (I think Randy) swung Mick and he hit the steps. I was suprised Mick even got up. Dissapointing ending when Mick Foley took out Mr. Socko but when he did thta, Orton came and did the RKO on him. The Rock and Mick look sad, but then they shake hands. Another good match, DO NOT SKIP.

 5. Sable and Torrie Wilson vs. Miss Jackie and Stacy Keibler 6/10

Kinda bad. This match was REALLY SHORT, but it had like one or two good moves in it. You really can't expect much from women's match though. Mostly a guy match, so if you like these girls then wath it. If you really don't care watch it or skip it (mostly skip it).

 6. Chavo Guererro vs. Nunzio vs. Jamie Noble vs. Tajiri vs. Akio vs. Funaki vs. Shannon Moore vs. Ultimo Dragon vs. Billy Kidman vs. Rey Mysterio (Crusierweight Open/Guantlet Match) 9/10

This match was pretty good, although it was kind of rushed. The match started of well with Ultimo Dragon vs. Shannon Moore until Jamie Noble started dominating. On one of Jamie Noble's pins, he pinned Funaki in 3 seconds! Jamie Noble was then later eliminated by Billy Kidman (I think) after Noble got Nunzio counted-out. Sadly, Akio never got to wrestle because he tried to help Tajiri when he was fighting Rey Mysterio, but Tajiri accidently missed Rey and spit that green stuff in Akio's face. Chavo gets the victory over Rey to retain with his father's help.

 7. Brock Lesnar vs. Goldberg 5/10

WORST MATCH OF THE NIGHT! Yes, this match was bad. I had hard time believing it too. I thought this match was going to be cool, but it really sucked. When both men came to the ring (including Steve Austin as referee) all they did was stare at each other. After a while they started pushing each other, and this lasted for about eight minutes with a few stares in between. The crowd even started chanting ""THIS MATCH SUCKS!"". Towards the last few minutes of the match, there was FINALLY some wrestling going on. Goldberg hit the Jackhammer (or whatever its called) on Lesnar to get the victory. At the end, Lesnar flicks the crowd and Austin off. Austin then stuns Lesnar. Goldberg came back to the ring and he and Austin started drinking beers together, until Austin stunned Goldberg too. Steve Austin carried the match bascially (even though he was only the ref). I kind of felt sorry for Lesnar and Goldberg though. Not worth your time really, so skip it.

 8. Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty vs. Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin vs. Bradshaw and Faarooq vs. Doug and Danny Basham 8/10

This match was better than the tag team match earlier. It was better because it had at least different people come in at all times (except for Faarooq who never came in). In the match, I thought it was funny how the Basham kept tagging each other to keep Scotty from tagging Rikishi. Towards the end everything went crazy. Bradshaw and Faarooq could have been the new tag champs because Bradshaw hit that knockdown with his arm (the one they say is from ""hell"") on one of the Bashams. Bradshaw then tried to do the same on Rikishi, but Rikishi then did a Samoen Drop on Bradshaw. From there Rikishi went to the Basham lying on the floor and sat on him REALLY HARD. This enabled him and Scotty to get the victory and retain. Good match.

 9. Molly Holly vs. Victoria 7/10

I was amazed thatthis match was pretty good. A lot of good moves here. Too short to explain anything though. Victoria gets the victory, and then Molly Holly gets her hair cut (turns bald). Molly tries to run, but she gets caught. This explains why Molly looks the way she does now. I actually felt bad Molly.

10. Kurt Angle vs. Eddie Guerrero 9/10

Excellent match. Eddie was in control most of the match, until almost the end when Kurt got Eddie's ankle. It looked like Eddie was going to lose, but not quite. Eddie outsmarted Kurt when Kurt had his ankle, and then he turned around while Eddie untied his boot making it look like it was hurt. When Kurt turned back around, he got Eddie ankle, but Eddie pushed him away and Kurt had his boot in his hand. Eddie then did a roll-up (with is feet on the ropes) on Kurt which got him the victory to retain.

11. Kane vs. The Undertaker 7/10

I was really dissapointed with this match. I say skip it because nothing much happenned here. The Undertaker gets the victory. The entances though are cool.

12. Shawn Michaels vs. Chris Benoit vs. Triple H 10/10

Good match. A lot action too explain, but the edning is a classic. Benoit gets the cross-face on Triple H and make him tap. Benoit then celebrates with Eddie Guerrero. DO NOT SKIP!, it is really good.",1110758400,16,6380,4.421007685738685

Fatal 4 Way-World Tag Team Championship:

Rob Van Dam & Booker T vs La Resistance vs Dudley Boyz vs Garrison Cade & Mark Jindrak 7/10

  A good match with moments of excitement. Better than I thought it would be. RVD & Booker make a great team. Should have left Cade & Jindrak out of this match.

Christian vs Chris Jericho 8/10

  Any match with Y2J is usually worth watching. Christian is improving as a single competitor. This is the start of Y2J's run as a fan favorite. Trish Stratus in the middle of it makes it interesting. A shocking ending.

Handicap Tag Team Match:

Randy Orton, Bautista & Ric Flair vs Rock'n'Sock Connection 9/10

  Very good match. Great to see Mick Foley & The Rock back in the ring. Back and forth action. Flair and The Rock carry this match. Even at 54, Flair is better than most. Unexpected ending.

WWE Hall Of Fame Class Of 2004 10/10

  Great memorable moment. To see the guys I grew up watching was touching. Greg Valentine, Tito Santana, Bobby Heenan, Big John Studd, Junkyard Dog and Jesse Ventura deserve this.

Stupid segment backstage with Jonathan Coachman, Bobby Heenan, Gene Okerlund, Fabulous Moolah and Mae Young.

Playboy Evening Gown Match:

Raw vs Smackdown

Stacy Keibler & Miss Jackie vs Torrie Wilson & Sable 0/10

  What a waste of time! Some many good wrestlers to chose from for another match and WWE gives us this garbage!

Great segment in the locker room with Eddie Guerrero & Chris Benoit. A must see!

WWE Cruiserweight Championship Open:

Chavo Guerrero Jr. vs Rey Mysterio vs Jamie Noble vs Tajiri vs Billy Kidman vs Shannon Moore vs Nunzio vs Ultimo Dragon vs Funaki vs Akio 8/10

  A great fast paced action event. But it was way too short. Should have been given more time to develop. Guys were eliminated too quick. Why does WWE rush the cruiserweights?

Smackdown vs Raw:

Brock Lesnar vs Goldberg(w/ Steve Austin as Referee) 5/10

  What should have been a 9 rating was ruined by Lesnar's leaving followed by Goldberg. The fans let them have it; deservingly so! a great hype for nothing.

Vince McMahon thanks the fans. A class act for him.

Fatal 4 Way:

WWE Tag Team Championship

Rikishi & Scotty 2 Hotty vs APA vs World's Greatest Tag Team vs Basham Brothers 6/10

  An okay match. Could have been better. The last match for the Bashams for a while.

Women's Championship:

Victoria vs Molly Holly( if Holly loses, must have head shaved) 5/10

  Gets a 5 only because of the ending. Very boring match. Victoria should go back to psychotic act.

WWE Championship:

Eddie Guerrero vs Kurt Angle 9/10

 Awesome match between 2 great ones. Angle's last match for a while. Back and forth action with a suprise ending.

Raw vs Smackdown:

Kane vs Undertaker 7/10

  Hype was better than match itself. A return to the deadman for Taker. Entrance was awesome with Paul Bearer returning. Taker mixed deadman and biker moves together. Kane looked like a deer caught in the headlights.

Triple Threat Match

World Heavyweight Championship

Triple HHH vs Chris Benoit vs Shawn Michaels 10/10

  A definite match of the year candidate. Intense action with lots of blood. Amazing that Triple HHH would be in a 10 match. He put on one of his best performances.

  Overall, one of the 5 best Wrestlemanias ever with lots of historic significance.",1108857600,,4126,4.6722689075630255
2022263,5,B0001OGVQ2,"Wrestlemania XX was a great one. Many great things happened there. John Cena vs. Big Show who could forget that Cena FUs him twice. Brock Lesnar vs. Goldberg with special ref. Stone Cold Steve Austin. Not that good of a match overall but I did want Lesnar to win so he would stay. Sadly Brock Lesnar left after this but it would be nice to see him at Wrestlemania 21. Eddie vs. Kurt Angle a very funny match and a great ending. Also the return of the Undertaker! I was very happy to see him back. Undertaker vs. Kane. The last event of the night was the Triple Threat Match between Triple H, Chris Benoit, and Shawn Michaels. A very exciting match and bloody. The winner was Benoit. He put up one hell of a fight to win it. I've left out some of the other ok matches but there was never a bad moment. I fully recommend buying this.",1108771200,,831,4.2

Big Show v John Cena

This was a good match with decent moments. Many people thought this was going to be a sqush match, It wasn't John Cena's wins after using his chain. 7/10

WORLD TAG TITLE 4-WAY: Booker & RVD vs La Resistance vs The Dudleyz vs Jindrak & Cade..

This was another good match but was not superb. with it been a 4 way match it was sometimes hard to get what was going on. With it. Booker T gave Rob Conway the axe kick and Rob Van Dam hit a frog splash for the pin! 6/10

Christian vs Chris Jericho..

This was an excellant match. Many good wrestling moves and alot of bumps. Some of the moves and high risks they take is out of this world. If you like one of these wrestles than you should buy the dvd just for this match. Trish Stratus showed up and ""accidentally"" elbowed Chris Jericho, thinking it was Christian..

Christian slipped into the ring and scored the pin on Jericho while pulling the trunks!

Trish Stratus then got in the ring to help Jericho, but turned HEEL and slapped him instead!

Christian hit an Uprettier on Chris Jericho and left with a heel-turned Trish Stratus!

Christian grabbed Trish Stratus by the hair and made out with her as Jericho's heart broke. 10/10

 HANDICAP MATCH: The Evolution (Randy Orton & Batista & Ric Flair) vs The Rock & Mick Foley..

This match was really over with the crowd. Rock and sock are just class. Late in the match, Mick Foley pulled out Mr. Socko but Randy Orton instead hit an RKO for the win!

Dispite the loss, The Rock led the crowd in a thunderous ovation for Mick Foley (Foley! Foley! Foley!) 8/10

PLAYBOY EVENING GOWN MATCH: Sable & Torrie Wilson vs Stacy Keibler & Miss Jackie..

This match is just stupid just like the miller cat fights girls last year this is wrestlemania people. All four Divas stripped down to their bra & panties before the match even got started!

Torrie Wilson pinned Jackie Gayda to win -- Stacy seems to be upset with Jackie for losing the match. 4/10

CRUISERWEIGHT OPEN: Chavo Guerrero retains the Cruiserweight title..

Short but sweet. Ultimo Dragon defeated Shannon Moore after an Asai DDT..

Jamie Noble defeated Ultimo Dragon..

Jamie Noble defeated Sho Funaki in a few seconds..

Jamie Noble beats Nunzio as a result of a COUNT OUT..

Billy Kidman defeated Jamie Noble..

Rey Mysterio defeated Billy Kidman..

Rey Mysterio defeated Tajiri..

Akio accidentally got spewed with Tajiri's mist, and was unable to participate..

Chavo Guerrero defeated Rey Mysterio with help from Chavo Sr and retain his Cruiserweight title!

7/10

INTERPROMOTIONAL MATCH: Brock Lesnar vs Bill Goldberg (Guest Referee: Steve Austin)..

The crowd immediately chanted ""YOU SOLD OUT"" to the departing Brock Lesnar, followed by ""Nah Nah Nah Hey Hey""..

Jim Ross & Jerry Lawler acknowledge the reaction, and explain that Brock Lesnar has dreams of being in the NFL..

Mostly support for Bill Goldberg, with the exception of a few ""Goldberg Sucks!"" chants..

The crowd ruined any chance of the match getting over with chants of ""This Match Sucks"" and ""Hogan"" and ""Boring!""

Bill Goldberg won after a spear and a jackhammer, with Referee Austin having no influence at all..

Brock Lesnar took his time getting to his feet and was met with ""Nah nah nah nah hey hey hey good bye"" chants!

Brock Lesnar took offense to the fans treatment and gave them the finger, as well as Steve Austin..

Steve Austin hauled off and gave Brock Lesnar a huge Stone Cold Stunner!

Steve Austin then gave Bill Goldberg a Stone Cold Stunner of his own! 6/10

WOMANS TITLE VS HAIR MATCH: Victoria vs Molly Holly..

Victoria pinned Molly to retain her championship, and then Molly got her head shaved bald! Should have hapeened on Raw. 5/10

 WWE TITLE MATCH: Eddy Guerrero vs Kurt Angle..

One of the matches of the night between this two great superstars. After a hard fought match that really heated up at the end, Eddy Guerrero picked up the suprising win!

Eddy Guerrero unlaced his boot, so when Kurt Angle tried for the ankle lock, the boot came off. 10/10

BROTHER VS BROTHER: The Undertaker vs Kane..

I loves this match for every thing that went with it the lod times. Iys great to see the deadman back. The Undertaker was led to the ring by a group of mysterious masked druids which included John Walters, and:

~~~Roman, Fred Sampson, Kevin Knight, Chad Wicks, Ken Phoenix, Johnny Heartbreaker, Vince Vicallo & Arch Kincaid..

The surprise of the night was the shocking return of the Undertaker's manager, and Kane's ""father"" - Paul Bearer!

The Undertaker came out in full ""Darkside"" mode with the suit, the hair, the attitude, and the music..

The Undertaker pinned Kane after a tombstone piledriver! 10/10

 TRIPLE THREAT WORLD TITLE MATCH: Triple H vs Shawn Michaels vs Chris Benoit..

Shawn Michaels got busted open and bloodied early on..

Chris Benoit had Shawn Michaels in the crossface, and was about to tap, but Triple H stopped him!

Later on, Chris Benoit had Triple H in the sharpshooter until Shawn Michaels superkicked Benoit!

Chris Benoit beats the odds and made Triple H tap out to capture the World Heavyweight championship!!!!!!

Smackdown!'s WWE Champion Eddy Guerrero came out and celebrated with Chris Benoit as the show came to a close.. 10/10

2022318,5,B0001OGVQ2,"WrestleMania XXI should be great and I will give some of my match predictions.

Sunday Night Heat Match:

Eugene & William Regal vs. La Resistance for the World Tag Team Championships.  This will be a 9:00 match and I figure it would probably show La Resistance winning the tag titles.  It ends when Slyvain Grenier pinned Regal after the Au Revoir.

Winners=La Resistance at around 9:00.

WrestleMania XXI:

Funaki vs. Spike Dudley for the Cruiserweight Championship.  It will be around the 11:00 minute mark.  I'm predicting that Funaki retains with his finisher the Rising Sun(Tornado DDT).

Winner=Funaki at around 11:00.

John Cena vs. Carlito Caribbean Cool & Jesus in a Handicap Match.  Before this match Cena chased Jesus around until he left the building.  This match will last about 7:00 minutes.  Carlito didn't stand a chance.  Cena wins with an FU on Carlito.

Winner=John Cena at around 7:00.

Trish Stratus vs. Lita vs. Victoria for the Women's Title.  This match didn't even happen because Lita & Victoria beat Trish like a mule backstage and this match never happended and Trish retained.

Basham Brothers vs. RVD & Rey Mysterio vs. Luther Reigns & Mark Jindrak for the WWE Tag Team Championhips.  This match ends around the 18:00 minute mark.  Reigns & Jindrak win when Reigns hit a Swinging Neckbreaker on Danny Basham.

Winners=Luther Reigns & Mark Jindrak at around 18:00.

Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho.  There match on Jan. 17 that was supposed to be a friendly competition went wrong went Benoit turned on Y2J.  That left them at WrestleMania.  It ends when Benoit goes for the Crossface but Jericho reverses and rolls him up for the 3.

Winner=Chris Jericho at around 23:00.

JBL vs. Eddie Guerrero for the WWE Championship.  This match will be around 16:00 minutes long.  Great match, when Eddie goes for the Frog Splash JBL gets the belt and hits Eddie with the belt and covers him, but Eddie kicked out then JBL hit a Clothesline From Hell for the 3.

Wiiner=JBL around 16:00.

Undertaker vs. Heidenreich in a Street Fight.  This match was made when Heidenreich buried Taker but he came back at took out Heidenreich.  This match will be about 20:00 minutes long.  During the match Heyman came to the ring and hit....Heidenreich!?!? with a chair then Heidenreich walked into a Tombstone Piledriver on to a garbage can.

Winner=Undertaker around 20:00.

Shawn Michaels vs. Edge in a Special Guest Referee Match w/ The Rock.  The reason The Rock is the ref is because HBK said that Edge and him have to have somebody to make sure things don't get out of hand.  The match itself goes about 35:00 minutes.  It has a confusing ending.  Edge grabs a chair and swings at HBK but The Rock gives Edge a Rock Bottom.  HBK covers 1,2,.... The Rock pulls HBK off and gives him a Rock Bottom then Edge covers HBK for the win.

Winner=Edge at around 35:00.

Booker T vs. Kurt Angle.  This was a true battle of endurance.  This match should go 30:00+.  It ends when Booker hits an Axe Kick followed by a Book End.

Winner=Booker T around 30:00.

Triple H vs. Randy Orton vs. Batista for the World Heavyweight Championship.  This match is about 45:00 minutes long and every superstar spills blood.  It finally ends when Batista hits a Sit-Down Powerbomb on HHH to win the title.

After the match Ivory raises Christy's hand then closthelines and belittles her on the mic saying she is an overpaid bimbo, and she's disgusted that so many decent women wrestlers lost their jobs so she and bimbos like Jackie and Torrie can tussle is their lingerie.

Cena's popularity garuanteed this one.  Good start, slow middle but a good ending got the crowd going.

Fatal Four-Way for the Tag Team Championship

This actually was pretty good.  These matches always have a fast pace and the ending was great.

Chris Jericho vs. Christian

This one had a good storyline and a somewhat surprise in the end.  Good technical match.  Jericho and Christian need to be higher on the card.

Evolution vs. Rock'n'Sock Connection

Great match!  Nice to see Foley and The Rock doing their thing.  No slow spots and the chemistry between Rock and Flair is priceless.  Bit of a surprise ending here too.

Stacy Kiebler & Miss Jackie vs. Torrie Wilson & Sable

All 4 women are absolutely gorgeous but this match is absolutely pathetic and crappy.  Garbage.

Cruiserweight Open

Too many names to list but a great if not rushed match.

Goldberg vs. Brock Lesnar with Stone Cold Steve Austin as special ref

Lots of hype for nothing.  Both men tanked this on purpose and the crowd let em have it!  They were leaving that night and just embarassed themselves.

Victoria vs. Molly Holly

Good match.  Better than the usual women's fare.  Almost WM standards and a good ending.

Eddie Guerrero vs. Kurt Angle

Finally Eddie gets his due.  Great technical match and a classic ending.  Should not have been before this match...

Undertaker vs. Kane

Taker's intro was just like the old days except for his appearance.  It really isn't that bad but when you hype the ""return"" of the deadman it better be just that.  Ok match but ending wasn't that good.

2022324,5,B0001OGVQ2,"I just got this DVD because I got $100 for Christmas. I was expecting this wrestlemania to be the best wrestlewmania ever but it didn't meet my expectations.

My expectations were

1. Hyped up crowd.

2. Goldberg vs Lesnar and Undertaker vs Kane to be two of the greatest matches.

3. Better Extra Features.

But now that I think about it, my expectations were a bit too high. The crowd were fairly hyped up at first but later, after sitting through many hours of matches,they had to be tired. Goldberg vs Brock and Undertaker vs Kane was too good of a match to begin with. Lastly, That was enough extra features to keep most of the wrestling fans to be entertained.

1. John Cena vs Big Show for the US Championship

Very god match. Gets the crowd hyped up and nice FU(I think that's what it is tho I'm not sure) by John Cena.

8.5/10

2. Chris Jerico vs Christian for Trish?

Decent match. Good acting but so so match. Unexpected ending.

7/10

3. Four Way Tag team match for World Tag team championship

Fairly entertaining match. Nothing special.

7.5/10

4. Rock N sock connection vs The Evolution

5 star match but I was expecting Rock N sock to win. Batista supposed to dominate but the Rock kills him with his moves.(just look at the size. Rock is about 270 lbs, 6'5"" but Batista looks a lot bigger than rock)

8.5/10

5. Inter Promotional Playboy Evening Gown match

The best match ever! maybe for sickos. sure, they are hot but it wasn't a good match.

6.5/10 for Torrie Wilson and Stacy.

6. Cruiserweight Elimination match for Cruiserweight championship

Great match. Very fast paced and high flying match and it would've been better if the crowd was more into it. Gay ending though. Where did that Guerrero Sr. come out of? Go back to selling enchiladas you retard!!!

9/10

7. Brock Lesnar vs Goldberg

The match I got the DVD for but was freaking retarded and slow paced. Goldberg finishes him off so easy but in reality Brock can kick his butt. (but I'm Goldberg fan) And horrible start. i guess it had fairly good ending. Stone Cold kills both of them even though Stone cold is like 45 now. (I'm also Stone Cold fan and Stone cold best badass ever but gotta admit the truth)

5.5/10

8. Four Way tag team match for WWE tag team championship Not as good as Raw tag team match but it was better than goldberg vs lesnar.

7/10

9. Victoria vs Molly holly

It was actually worse than Goldberg vs Lesnar maybe not. Because Molly gets her hair shaved. HAHAHAHA and Kurt Angle even get to see her hair get shaved live!!!!! Should've been on Raw or something. Even would have been a starter match for RAW.

5/10 for hair shaved

10. Eddie Guerrero vs Kurt Angle For WWE championship

Even though Kurt Angle is right, to lie, cheat, and steal is better!!! Great performance. lots of grapples and amateur style wrestling. Expected ending though.

9/10

11. Undertaker vs Kane (Undertaker's return)

The whole buried alive was so stupid but WWE has been doing that since 1990 or something.(besides everyone knows its fake but its still entertaining caus its funny as heck and the Torrie Wilson dad dying was also funny but don't know if it's real or not. owen Hart was real. RIP Owen Hart.) Ok match and great entrance. Was expecting the 1996 entrance music. Expected ending.

7/10

12. Triple H vs HBK vs Chris Benoit for World Heavyweight Championship

Great match. Best match of the night. Brutal match but crowd was horrible in supporting the wrestlers. Great match though.

10/10 (would've been 100/10 if the crowd was into it)Also an Expected ending.

Overall, the Wrestlemania was pretty good but not the best. I would have to say the best was Wrestlemania 18 where it was Hulk vs The Rock and Triple H's return. bonus was just so so.

2022357,5,B0001OGVQ2,"Even with all of the hype of Wrestlemania 20, lest face it, in the end it didn't live up to the hype. Apart from the triple threat world heavyweight title match the other matches were o.k. however I believe that if the WWE are as clever as they make they are then they will try to make Wrestlemaina 21 the biggest one yet. This means big hype, big matches and major superstars returning to the squared circle once again. I also think that the cross-over promotional matches from last year were an excellent idea and should happen again at Wrestlemania 21. Last year there were three matches, Kane Vs Undertaker, Brock Lesnar Vs Goldberg and the divas match.

Here are the matches that I would like to see at Wrestlemania 21:

Match 1: Fatal-4-Way for the U.S Title

Rey Mysterio vs. RVD vs. Eddie Gurrerro vs. Carlito Caribbean Cool (Champion)

This will be an excellent opener with lots of high flying moves and fast paced action. There should be a part at the end of the match where Rey and Carlito are down and so Eddie does the frog splash on Carlito at the same time as RVD does the 5 star frog splash on Rey and so both go for the cover at the same time and the referee does not know who to count for. I would like RVD to win this match as he truly deserves a major title and not just the tag team titles. (The match would be a 5/5 rating)

Match 2: WWE Women's Championship Match

Trish Stratus vs. Lita (Champ)

I must admit I always thought that women's matches only took place for the divas to show off but I was surprised when I saw Lita vs. Trish on Raw (6th December). The match was actually quite entertaining with some close pin falls and some cool moves by either woman, though saying that Lita still needs to improve on her in ring movement as it is still quite sloppy. Anyway their Raw match was good let's hope that if they wrestle again at Wrestlemania it is a better match. (Should; be a 3/5 rating).

Match 3: Inter-promotional Match - Iron Man Match

Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit

These two have had many matches over the years some were instant classics (ultimate submission) and some were not. But these two are still two of the best technical wrestlers alive today and I believe would make an amazing Ironman match. This rivalry would begin at the Royal Rumble where Angle is being interviewed and is claming to be the best wrestler in the WWE today and as always boasting about his Gold Medals when Benoit interrupts the interview and begins to insult Angle. Angle then claims that he will win the royal rumble and win the WWE Title at Wrestlemania 21. Benoit laughs and asks Angle about how last year (Wrestlemania 20) how he won the Royal Rumble even though he came in number one and then went on to win the World Heavyweight Title whereas on the same night Angle lost to Eddie Gurrerro because of his boot slipping off. Benoit laughs at how Angle has not won the title since and has not even been in a WWE title match. They both argue and then in the Rumble Benoit Eliminates Angle. Then Angle comes back in and hits Benoit with a chair. After the rumble Angle interferes in Benoit's matches on Raw. The rivalry continues when Benoit causes Angle to lose his match at No Way Out. Then Angle demands Vince to make the match and so the iron man match is made.

The match itself will be excellent with Angle tapping out to cross face and Benoit to the Anklelock. I would like Benoit to win the match  (Match would be a 5/5 rating).

Match 4: Fatal-4-way Ladder match for the Intercontinental Title.

Edge vs. Chris Jericho vs. Christian vs. Shelton Benjamin (champion)

This will obviously be one of the best matches of the night. Lots of excitement that happens in ladder matches and the ladder is used in many innovative ways to bust the superstars open. Jericho does the walls of Jericho on Christian on top of the ladder. Also when Christian is hanging from the title Edge does a flying spear from the top rope. Jericho does a moonsault from the ladder to Edge through a table. Jericho wins the match and becomes the intercontinental champ for the eighth time. (Defiantly would be 5/5 and one of the best ladder matches ever)

Match 5: Triple H vs. The Rock

The Rock returns just before Wrestlemania as he did last year and as he usually does will insult Triple H. This match was set up when Eugene told The Rock that Triple H is his favourite wrestler but because of the Rocks Hollywood career it was left undeveloped. But hopefully these two will build a rivalry until Eric Bishoff makes the match and it should be a good match but not the best of the night. Triple H has lost some of his in ring ability and can sometime underperform. I would want Tripe H to win as I can't stand The Rock (3/5 rated match)

Match 6: World Tag Team Title Match - A 3-team tag team turmoil.

Rhyno & Tajiri vs. La Resistance vs. Eugene & William Regal (champions)

Should be a normal tag team match with Eugene doing his usual frolicking around. Hopefully Rhyno and Tajiri will win, as they truly deserve them. (2/5 rating)

Match 8: WWE Cruiserweight Title Match

Chavo Guerrero vs. Billy Kidman (champion - after beating Funaki on Smackdown)

These two hate each other to the max and after Chavo's return from his injury; have not yet been in a singles match so Chavo has not got his true revenge on Kidman for what he did to him. This will be an excellent match with highflying moves and lots of close pin falls. Kidman will hit the shooting start press but Chavo will kick out of the pin. Chavo will hit the gori-bomb but Kidman will kick out. Finally Chavo will do the shooting start press, pin Kidman and win the title as well as getting his revenge. (4/5 rating)

Match 9: WWE Tag Team Title Match - 4 team Tag Team Turmoil

Dudley Boys vs. Hardcore Holly & Daniel Puder vs. Rene Dupree & Kenzo Suzuki vs. Luther Reigns & Mark Jindrak (champions)

Should be a better than the Raw Tag team title matches with more intense fighting. Luther will dominate and there will be some close pin falls. Luther and Jindrak should retain the titles but I think Hardcore Holly & Puder will win so that WWE can boost the promotion of Daniel Puder as a real wrestler. (3/5 match)

Match 10: Booker T vs. JBL

This match would take place because Booker T would come out on Smackdown and make fun of JBL for losing the title to Undertaker at No Way Out. JBL would get his cabinet to attack Booker T. Theodore Long would make a tag match on Smackdown being JBL & Orlando Jordan vs. Undertaker & Booker T. JBL would cheat and pin Booker T causing Booker to demand a match against JBL at Wrestlemania. (To be honest I don't think this match will really happen I'm just saying it, as I have not put them in a match yet) If the match happened will be better than their Survivor Series match and will be an o.k. Match. I would want Booker T to win, as JBL is getting boring now. (Should be a 3/5 rating)

Match 11: Last man Standing Match

Batista vs. Kane

I've always wanted these two to have a proper match with no interferences. Even though they have had matches in the past they have usually been interrupted or someone has helped Batista to win and so these two have not had a proper match. I believe that these two are of equal strength and power and so could make an excellent last man standing match. A normal match would not be enough for what these two can truly do to each other. This rivalry will start at the Royal Rumble where Batista Impressively Lifts Kane up in the air and throws him out of the ring. Kane will get furious and will go back in and the two will start to fight until Kane is forced out by the referees. The rivalry will continue to develop on Raw week after week as both say they are better and bigger than the other. Bishoff will then say that the bigger and better man will be the man who is the last man standing at Wrestlemania 21. This match itself should be a classic and in the words of JR "" a true slobberknocker"". There will be no Interference, as Evolution would have already split up by the Royal Rumble. Both men will be busted open and Kane will Choke slam Batista through the Spanish Announce table. This should be long match. I would like Batista to win and be the last man standing as I believe he is better than Kane. (4/5 Should be a Brutal and awesome match)

Match 11: Inter-promotional Match

Randy Orton vs. John Cena

For some reason I believe that this match will defiantly take place at Wrestlemania 21 and I will be quite surprised if it doesn't. These two came into the WWE at roughly the same time and are almost the same age. They are both young and are excellent athletes; they both are very popular with the fans and are worthy of being in main events. I also remember that there was a confrontation between these two backstage at a recent PPV but I'm not sure which one. I believe this match has already been promoted, if you have played the new video game Smackdown Vs Raw then you would know that in the beginning intro we here JR shouting ""oh my god its Raw Vs Smackdown"" and we see Orton and Cena fighting in the ring. I believe that if this match happened it will a superb match with close falls and some awesome wrestling. Orton would be on the top rope and would do his trademark splash but Cena will catch him on his shoulders and do the FU. I wouldn't care who wins that match as in my view both are as good as each other and both deserve to win. (Would be a 5/5 rated match)

Match 11: WWE Title Match - Triple threat match

Big Show vs. Brock Lesnar vs. Undertaker (champion)

Ok... o.k...  I know why Brock Lesnar? But I would not have included him if not for one thing. I saw Armageddon 2004 two days before I wrote this review and if you remember in the 3-on-1-handicap match Big show used an F-5 to pin Mark Jindrak and win. Now this may be just me but why would they make Big Show use an F-5 all of a sudden, WWE don't usually do this unless there is a specific reason. In my view this usually means two things: 1 being that Brock has defiantly left WWE for good and so his finisher was given to Big Show permanently, or 2 for causing a storyline in which Brock makes his return. Brock would show up at the Royal Rumble and eliminate the Big Show. Then these two would argue for who should face Undertaker at Wrestlemania 21 for the WWE title. They would have singles match at No Way Out, which Lesnar would win, but by cheating. Theodore Long would settle the argument by making this triple threat match for Wrestlemania 21. The match will be excellent with all three superstars giving their best. Taker would tombstone Lesnar but Lesnar will kick out. Big Show will double chokeslam on Lesnar and Taker though the Smackdown Announce table. This will be a good long match, and I would want Undertaker to win as he deserves to remain the champion for longer, and plus he would continue his Wrestlemania winning streak. (Should be a 5/5 rating match).

BUT: if Lesnar doesn't not return then it would be Big Show vs. Undertaker and would still be a good match.

Match 12: World Heavyweight Title Match - Hell In A Cell

Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Shawn Michaels (champion)

I know... I know a dream match... is very unlikely for it to actually happen, but come on you know if it did it would probably be the match of the night. Even if it was not a Hell in A cell and just a singles match it would still be amazing. This is how I think this match would be set up. Shawn Michaels will return on Raw and would win the vacated World heavyweight Title by beating Edge (this would allow him to get the title as well as having his revenge on Edge for costing him the title at Taboo Tuesday). Then at the Royal Rumble Stone Cold Steve Austin would make his shocking return by knocking out Christian and taking his place in the Rumble match. He would win the Royal Rumble and so it would mean that he faces Michaels at Wrestlemania. Even though I would prefer it to be a Hell in A cell the match would still be good if it was not. If it is a Hell in A Cell the match will be absolutely amazing. Will be long and very bloody. Both me will give it their all and would be exhausted by the end of the match. They would leave the cell and climb on the top where they fight each other and try to push each other from the top. Austin would DDT Michaels on the top of the cell causing it to break and they would fall in the ring. Both men would be down and then Michaels gets up and sets Austin up for the sweet chin music just as he is going to hit Austin, he blocks it and hits the Stunner. Both men then collapse but Austin manages to fall on top of Michaels and the ref counts three causing Austin to win the World Heavyweight title. Sounds good but is very unlikely to happen. I would want Austin to win because we all want to see him as the champ again. (Would be the best match of the night - 5/5). I think I speak for every WWE fan when I say ""PLEASE WWE MAKE THIS MATCH""

So there it is, Wrestlemania 21 - the way I would make it if I were making the matches. 12 superb matches, some realistic some just plain dream matches but if this happened then it would defiantly be the greatest Wrestlemania of ALL time and by god I mean it.",1103068800,,13204,4.29232006433454

Booker T & RVD vs. Garrison Cade & Mark Jindrak vs. Dudley Boyz vs. La Resistance for the World Tag Titles.  This was a very good match and I thought it was pretty awesome when RVD kicked 9 guys straight and then he hits a Frog Splash to win.  This match was quick but good. (6/10)

Christian vs. Chris Jericho was a match that I thought was gonna suck but it was one of the better matches of the PPV and it was 20 minutes long.  Trish turns on Jericho and helps Christian win the match. (8/10)

Rock 'n' Sock Connection vs. Evolution was a great match any many people don't give it credit for being awesome.  I see reviewers are writing that Evolution needed to win to continue into Backlash.  NOT TRUE AT ALL!!!  If Rock'n' Sock would have won you could have had Rock vs. Batista at Backlash and who doesn't want to see that. (8.5/10)

Sable & Torrie Wilson vs. Stacy Keibler & Miss Jackie in an Evining Gown Match.  This match is just horrible don't watch unless you want to see Sable, Torrie & Stacy strip to nothing at all and watch Torrie pull Jackie panties off at the end and show Jackie's [...]. (4/10)

Rey Mysterio vs. Chavo Guerrero vs. Tajiri vs. Billy Kidman vs. Shannon Moore vs. Funaki vs. Ultimo Dragon vs. Akio vs. Jaime Noble vs. Nunzio for the Cruiserweight Title.

(5.5/10)

Goldberg vs. Brock Lesnar with Stone Cold Steve Austin as Special Guest Referee.  This match was so slow that I could have gone to Madison Square Garden and back and it would still be on.  Goldberg won after a Jackhammer Slam and then Austin stunned both of them. (5.5/10)

Molly Holly vs. Victoria for the Women's Title.  This match was horrible but only watch it if you want to see Molly get her head shaved after Victoria wins. (4.5/10)

APA vs. World's Greatest Tag Team vs. Rikishi & Scotty 2 Hotty & Basham Brothers for the WWE Tag Titles.  This match was not as good as the Raw match and this match ended with Rikishi sitting on a Basham to retain. (5.5/10)

Eddie Guerrero vs. Kurt Angle for the WWE Title.  This match is nothing like Brock vs. Eddie at No Way Out.  This match was great but not as great as their match at Summerslam.  Eddie retains the title when he untied his boot and Angle had the Ankle Lock but Guerrero slipped the boot off and then rolled Kurt up. (9/10)

Undertaker vs. Kane was a match that was the return of Undertaker and he finally lost that Biker Dude gimmick and no he's actually good again and Kane payed big time for trying to kill him. (5.5/10)

Triple H vs. Chris Benoit vs. Shawn Michaels for the World Title.  This match was not as good as people say it is and I loved it but I didn't think the work was great and Shawn was slow after he cut himself and got useless.  Benoit wins the World Title and celebrates with Guerrero. (8.5/10)

  This match was better then the Raw tag match.  The ending is horrible but the work is so much better.  Scotty & Rikishi retain. 7/10

Victoria v. Molly Holly  Women's Title
  This was a bad match but it gets a high rating because of when Molly gets her head shaved.  Victoria retains. 8/10

Eddie Guerrero v. Kurt Angle  WWE Title
  This was a good match but not as good a match that they will have at Summerslam.  Eddie retains in a okay match with a funny ending. 8/10

Undertaker v. Kane
  This match was bad and it was dominated by Taker.  I love his entrance and I thought the whole thing was a set-up by Kane. 4/10

Shawn Michaels v. Triple H v. Chris Benoit  World Title

2022435,5,B0001OGVQ2,"Match #1 John Cena vs. Big Show (c) for The United States Championship: Great way to open the show. These guys don't have the best chemistry, but it was still good! Cena hits Big Show with a massive FU (after a cheap shot with the chain) to win the title!!! 7/10

Match #2 World Tag Team Championship Sudden Death feat. Garrison Cade & Mark Jindrak, La Resistance (suck), The Dudleys, and Booker T & RVD (c): Awesome! Had a good pace and was a perfect length time wise. Booker and RVD win after a 5 Star Frog Splash on those stupid Frenchies (Rob Conway sucks!!!). 8/10

Match #3 Christian vs. Chris Jericho: I'm glad these guys' feud is over now cuz it was definitely getting old! Not too much to say here...it was a decent mid-card match with Trish ruining the match, costing Y2J the match, and then turning on him and going heel (lame!). 6/10

Match #4 The Rock 'N Sock Connection vs. Evolution: Great match, one of the best on the card! The only reason Evolution won is because they felt they needed to keep the Orton/Foley feud going another month. Yeah they had a great match at Backlash but the feud sucked! The Rock is ripped off yet again. Orton was the only bad thing about this match... 9/10

Match #5 Sable & Torrie Wilson vs. Miss Jackie & Stacy Keibler (2 of the sexiest women alive!!!) in a Play Boy Evening Gown match: Horrible match! But it was great ""eye candy"" none the less. Torrie and Sable win, in a total waste of time. 3/10 for the hotties...

Match #6 The Cruiserweight Open: This surprised me of how good it ended up being! It sucked that Chavo ended up retaining his title, but a great performance by everyone in the match...except for Funaki who was eliminated after like 7 seconds, haha! 8/10

Match #7 Goldberg vs. Brock Lesnar with Stone Cold as the special guest referee: This was a disappointment, and that is even an understatement. Goldberg wins after no effort by both men. Atleast the match ended the way it should have...Stone Cold STUNNING both those sell outs right out of the WWE!!! And for that it gets a 5/10.

Match #8 WWE Tag Team Championship Sudden Death feat. Shelton Benjamin & Charlie Haas, The APA (awesome!), The Bashams, and Rikishi & Scotty (horrible) (c): The APA should have won! But Fatty and ... retained their titles unfortunately. Yet like the RAW match, this was also pretty good except for the end. Oh yeah and the Bashams suck really bad! 8/10

Match #9 Molly Holly vs. Victoria (c) for The Women's Championship: If Molly looses (which she does, haha) she will have to have her head shaved! Good ending with Molly getting shaved and not a bad match to go with it! 7/10

Match #10 Kurt Angle vs. Eddie Guererro (c) for The WWE Championship: Great match, but too long! Ofcourse Eddie cheated to win cuz he will never be able to ""actually"" beat Kurt! Kurt sure showed him at Summerslam 5 months later! 8/10

Match #11 Undertaker vs. Kane: This match wasn't really that good. Taker's entrance was ""phenominal"" though! Taker wins with the tombstone piledriver and improves his Wrestlemania record to 12-0. 5/10

Match #12 HBK vs. Chris Benoit vs. HHH (c) for The World Heavyweight Championship: Match of the night, and one of the greatest main events of all time! What a SLOBBERKNOCKER!!! Almost 30 minutes of action with great performances by all 3 men! Benoit is the greatest and proves it for sure in this match by making HHH tap out to the Crossface!!! Benoit WINS!!! 10/10

2022437,5,B0001OGVQ2,"WrestleMania 20 where it all begins again!!

Twenty years after the first Wrestlemania in 1985 makes it return to Madison Square Garden, this was overall a decent Wrestlemania, not a great Wrestlemania but decent enough to watch.

Two things that really ruined people's expectations for the anniversary was the lack of Hulk Hogan and Bret Hart at the event who were rumored to be there, but no so. The Big Show vs. Cena match was laugher as Big Show dominated, yet Cena, got a cheap win by hitting Show with brass knuckles. This Wrestlemania

also marks the last appearence of Bill Goldberg and Brock Lesnar. Contract disputes between Vince and Goldberg (due mostly to the WWE despite being a million dollar company being cheap) and not wanting to pay the money he ask for. Brock Lesnar left the WWE to try out in the NFL, but that dream has been

an utter failure.

Anyhow the card:

Big Show vs. Cena for the US title (already mentioned), somewhat good but a cheap ending spoils.

CruiserWeight invitational: (Featuring one of the last apperarences of Ultimo Dragon)

This was one of the best matches of the night, a great lineup of contenders line up to fight for a shot

at Chavo Guerrero's title : Kidman, Ultimo Dragon, Jamie Noble , Rey Mysterio and many more. Good match..

Evolution (Batista , Randy Orton , Ric Flair) in a handicap match against the Rock and Sock Connection

(The Rock and Mick Foley)

I have to say pretty disappinting, the Rock has gone Hollywood and he's heart doesn't seem to be in the business all he does is promote his new movies instead of delivering a good show. Mick Foley, despite being the hardcore legend , like Ric Flair, is way too old to wrestle, and the further he stays in the ring, the more damage he does to his body.

The match was made between a good rivalrry between Orton and Foley, where Foley received a brutal beating at the hands of Evolution, a concussion.

Foley and Rock gain a measure of revenge, but the match itself, eh, the ending was never in doubt.

Evening Gown Match: Sable and Tori Wilson vs. Jackie and Stacey Kiebler.

Enjoyable!!! Say what you want but these matches are what gives the WWE some of their biggest ratings.

The Divas despite having limited talent can draw an audience since most of their audience are male viewers.

Molly vs Victoria for the Women's title.

Victoria is definitely one of the sexiest women to ever grace

the squared circle. Not only that but she is very tough in the

ring reminiscent of Chyna. Good match, oh yeah the loser also had to get their head shaved.

Christian vs. Chris Jericho

Great match, everyone knows Jericho can bring it, always has , always will. Christian has really come to his own since his old tag team days, but he is now a legitimate singles wrestler. The setup for the match was that Christian has stabbed Jericho in the back and has tried to go after his girlfriend Trish Stratus  and thus we have the match. The rivalry wouldn't end here, Jericho and Christian would deliver the goods  at Unforgiven in a unforgettable ladder match.

Kurt Angle vs. Eddie Guerrero for the WWE title.. Good match though I am not a fan of Eddie Guerrero I think his heel character and his persona is insulting to the Hispanic Community.

Goldberg vs. Brock Lesnar. Good match, though its obvious  that both wrestlers know their both leaving.

Stone Cold was the referee, but in reality he shouldnt have been placed here as Austin is nothing more than a show stealer.

Golderrgs lays a spear and a jackhammer to finish of Lesnar coming of his embarassing defeat to Eddie Guerreo

Triple Match for the World Title Sean Michaels vs. Chris Benoit vs. Triple H.

Outstanding!! Chris Benoit has always been a main event player, he has been cheated over the years, putting over guys yet never getting his shot at the title. Triple H is overrated and continues to embarass himself by resorting to cheap moves and weapons to secure his title.

Sean Michaels well is Sean Michaels, but Chris Benoit is the highlight of this match since he would win the World Title and etch himself into Madison Square History by winning the title.

A long time coming for Benoit the best technical wrestler in the WWE since the days of Bret Hart.",1097625600,,4231,4.612299465240642
2022438,4,B0001OGVQ2,"I bought this DVD to see the greatest performers of any era at one event. Every match was avearage to great. With the Main Event living up to all the hype, it was great to see Benoit get the big win over Cripple H and Shawn Michaels. Finally a guy who deserves the belt wins. Christian/Jericho was pretty good too. Victoria/Molly put on a excellent effort. Goldberg vs Lesner? HAHAHAHA!! What a joke. Lesner SUCKS and Goldberg? I could care less.

Angle and Eddie put on a masterpiece even though Angle was limited. Great match with a ingenius ending by Eddie. Undertaker returning was a highlight. But the biggest highlight was Rock and Flair in the same ring at WM. The greatest Sports Entertainer of ALL time against a guy many think is the greatest ""wrestler"" of all time. In the end, the Rock's charisma carried the match. Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!",1096588800,,848,4.6158940397351
2022439,5,B0001OGVQ2,"Great PPV.  Probably the most anticipated PPV in history.  Unfortunately, it was hyped up so much, the expectations were huge. It was disappointing, just because of the hype, but still an amazing event.  The DVD is actually a 2 disk set.

Watch the intro at the beginning.  All WWE PPV's intros are good, but Wrestlemania has the best one.

1. Big Show vs. John Cena (U.S. Title)

Good way to start off the show.  Cena really got the crowd going.  Decent match between these two.  (7.5/10)

2. Rob Van Dam & Booker T vs. Dudley Boys vs. Mark Jindrak & Garrioson Cade vs. La Resistance (World Tag Titles/Fatal Fourway)

It is the better of the two tag title matches, but it is not that good.  It could have been, but it was a little too short.  Half of these guys are now on Smackdown.  It was nice of Vince to try to fit everyone into the show.  (7/10)

3. Chris Jericho vs. Christian

These two built up a great fued.  Great match.  Second best of the night.  There are some pretty sick spots in the match.  Jericho puts the ""Walls of Jericho"" on Christian and eventually keeps the hold all the way out onto the arena floor.  Trish Stratus makes an appearance.  Shocking ending.  (9/10)

4. Evolution vs. Rock 'n' Sock Connection (Handicap Match)

This match was put together to get The Rock and Flair into a match at this event.  Otherwise, it would have been Foley/Orton.  Good match.  The Rock and Flair put on great performances.  Surprising ending.  It comes out of nowhere.  (7.5/10)

5. Torrie Wilson & Sable vs. Stacy Keibler & Miss Jackie (Evening Gown Match)

Very disappointing.  I thought there would be a lot more to this match.  (4/10)

6. Cruiserweight Open (Cruiserweight Title)

Participants included Rey Mysterio, Chavo Guerrero, Ultimo Ultimo Dragon, Jamie Noble, Billy Kidman, Shannon Moore, Nunzio, Funaki, Akio, & Tajiri.  There are a lot of sick spots in this match, especially the Shooting Star Press by Billy Kidman off the middle of the top rope to the arena floor.  Unfortunatley, it is a short match and the wrestlers are not in the ring that long.  (8.5/10)

7. Goldberg vs. Lesnar (Stone Cold Steve Austin as Guest Referee)

This match was so hyped up and ended up being awful.  It was Lesnar and Goldber's last match in the WWE and one of Austin's last appearance.  The crowd made the match by ripping on Lesnar calling him a ""sellout"" for leaving for the NFL.  Horrible match.  (3/10)

8. Rikishi & Scotty 2 Hotty vs. Basham Brothers vs. APA vs. World's Greatest Tag Team (WWE Tag Title/Fatal Fourway)

Not a very good match. Just an attempt to get all these guys on the show.  (6/10)

9. Victoria vs. Molly Holly (Women's Title/If Molly Loses, She Has To Shave Her Head)

Not the best match, but good ending.  I don't want to tell you what happens.  (3/10)

10. Kurt Angle vs. Eddie Guerrero (WWE Title)

I thought this match was going to be one of the best in a while.  It was a little disappointing, but it was only that reason because Angle was hurt and he never revealed it until after the show.  It was still a good match.  The crowd was really into it.  The end is terrible.  (9/10)

11. Kane vs. Undertaker

This match marked the return of the Undertaker as the Deadman.  Nobodby really cared about the match, they just wanted to see Taker.  Amazing entrance.  It is one of the most surreal moments you will ever see.  The crowd goes crazy.  Not the best match, but it is worth it for the entrance.  (6/10)

12. Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H vs. Chris Benoit (World Heavyweight Title/Triple Threat)

Great match.  Best match of the year so far.  They say it may be the best main event in WWE history.  Fantastic, fast paced match with a lot of emotions.  Great spots with HBK doing a Moonsault off the top turnbuckle to the arena floor.  Another sick spot with the double suplex on Benoit through the announce table.  Amazing ending, with a lot of near falls and high emotions.  Great energy in the match.  (9.5/10)

As I said, this is a 3 disk set.  Some of the best extras is the special hosted by Flair which featured highlights of the top ten matches in 'Mania history as voted by the wrestlers.  Definately watch the movie of Wrestlemania 19, especially the Angle/Lesnar segment and The Rock/Austin segment.  They are both very, very emotional, especially Austin/The Rock segment.

1. The John Cena v. Big Show match - 3 out of 5. Got to give props to Cena.  Put on a heck of a show although it could have been a little more faster pace.  What do expect though wrestling against the Big Show.

2. Rock/Sock Connection v. Evolution - 3.9 out of 5.  Only reason I'm giving it this rating is because I'm sick of the Rock!  I'm surprised the match last as long as it did with three members of Evolution involved.  Sidenote: Ric Flair is still the greatest ring general there is!

3. Christian v. Jericho - 4 out of 5.  I like these guys for one reason and one reason only - pacing!  These two guys can really get you involved in the match.  Plus the ending was a classic!

4.  First ever Playboy evening gown match - I can't even rate this one.  Sorry everyone!  The only thing good that came out of this one was they left the ring.  Sorry Guys!

5.  Interpromotional match - Goldberg v Lesner w/Austin as Special Referee.  In all my years of studying, reviewing, and just loving this brand of entertainment.  I can honestly say this was the biggest piece of CRAP I have ever watched!  If I could give a negative rating for this match I would.  The more I think about it I would actually give the evening gown match a 5 out of 5 if I had just these two matches to rate!

6.  The Undertaked v Kane - 4.9 out of 5.  If you didn't love the return of the ""Deadman,""  you just don't understand.  The only reason I gave it a 4.9 was I wanted a coffin out there.  Much Respect to the Undertaker for staying perfect at WM.

7.  WWE Champsionship  Eddie Guerrero v. Kurt Angle - 4 out of 5.  What can you say about this match?  Latino Heat showed up to bring the belt back home and ""Your Olympic Hero"" came to fight.  This match ranks up there as one of my favorite WM moments and matches.  Props to these 2 Superstars!

8.  Triple Threat  Benoit v. Michaels v. Triple H - 5 out of 5.  The main event at any show should take your breath away and this one did not disappoint.  To see these guys go at like they did in a history making event was huge.  Huge Props to these 3 and Huge Props to Eddie Guerrero for showing unity to his best friend!

Overall I would definetly give this Wrestlemania a 4 out of 5 stars with a slight hestitation about a couple of the matches.  A definite owner for Wrestlemani fans!",1092873600,,2402,4.106060606060606

overall a must buy this 3 disk set is loaded with extras which are all worth looking into buy it now!!",1092355200,,2821,4.987152034261242
2022466,5,B0001OGVQ2,"Wrestlemania XX was a great PPV. Aside from the evening gown match, the two fatal-fourway tag title matches & the disapointing Cruiserweight open (which was booked poorly, wasn't given enough time, and failed to really get the crowd into it), all the matches were three stars or more. The highlight of the night comes at the end, when Chris Benoit and Eddie Guerrero embrace in the centre of the ring. Like I said, it's a great PPV.

But the best reason to buy this is for the extras. They really, really went out of their way to include as much cool stuff as possible.

The highlight is definitely The Mania Of Wrestlemania, a candid documentary filmed at Wrestlemania 19, which mainly focuses on Kurt Angle vs. Brock Lesnar, and Steve Austin vs. The Rock, but also includes deleted scenes on Triple H vs. Booker T & Vince McMahon vs. Hulk Hogan. This documentary is worth the price of the DVD alone. To hear Steve Austin get emotional, to see Hulk Hogan requiring acupuncture on his back before he can wrestle, to watch as Brock Lesnar freak out backstage after infamously botching the Shooting Star Press and knocking himself silly... a true fan needs to see this.

Other features on the WM XX DVD include pre- and post- match interviews conducted specifically for the DVD, a special called Wrestlemania's Ten Greatest Matches, hosted by Ric Flair, and the Dudley Boyz vs. Lance Storm & Val Venis for a tag team title shot from Heat weeks before, among others.

This is a must-have.",1091836800,,1485,4.67816091954023

Where's the missle drop kick or moonsault of top turn buckle, waist lock take down or that sick inside out german suplex. Watch the street fight on King Of The Ring 2001 and you'll see what I mean. Anyway the match was the best of the night and I think it's alot better than the overated triple threat match. It started of fantastic with Shawn and Chris Benoit then HHH ruined it. HHH needs to retire because since his quad or something was torn from his leg he got werse I heard(I got into wrestling in mid 2001 so I never sore him wrestle before because he was injured).

2022470,4,B0001OGVQ2,"Lets face it 2004s fist two PPVs were far from classics, but things pick up in March. The WMXX DVD boxset contains 13 matches, runs over 7 hours and over 3 beautiful disks with great packaging, making it one of the greatest WWE DVDs.

Big Show vs John Cena  5/10

Why is Big Show still in WWE? What has he done for the company apart from being the size of a whale? Cena tried hard in this match, but Big Shows size made it hard for Cena to do much. Average opener, if you have seen SurSer2003 you know what to expect.

RVD & Booker T  vs  Dudley Boyz  5/10

vs  Cade & Jindrak  vs La Resistance

Disappointing match after the Dudley Boyz last outing at MSG was a 10/10 at SurSer2002.

Chris Jerico vs Christian  8/10

A solid match with a lot of twists and turns...

Rock n Sock vs Evolution  6/10

The Rock has never disappointed at WM! The rest of them put on an average show.

Sable & Torrie vs Stacy & Miss Jackie  8/10

Wow!

Cruiserweight Championship Open  9/10

Three years ago the cruiserweights were a bore but now they can more than hold their own to the heavyweights (and often surpass), this is a great match, Rey's attire was very cool. (I swear if MC & Tazz say ""remember you can only see these guys on Smackdown!"" One more time... we know already! no need to plug it a hundred times a match)

Goldberg vs Brock Lesnar  4/10

I was soooo looking forward to this match, it had a four month build up but it felt like they only got informed that they were having a match an hour before, I can choreograph a better match on my PS2!  2 out of the 4 points go to the crowd for this one, there's no arena like the Garden! The difference between the WM19 crowd (zombies) and the WM20(actual sharp WWE fans) was incredible.

Scotty 2 Hotty & Rikishi vs APA vs  6/10

Basham Brothers vs World Greatest Tag Team

Surprisingly better than the World Tag Championship match, but they should not of made them both the same (fatal 4 way, one fall to a finish), how about triple threat or tag elimination? Some variation was defiantly needed.

Victoria vs Molly Holy  2/10

A boring match combined with terrible commentary, JRs underpants anyone? I thought not. (Its strange these 2 can be great commentators but every so often they make you want to die...(No Mercy 02 HHHvsKane, or how about WM19 HHHvsBokerT)

Kurt Angle vs Eddie  Guerrero  10/10

I great (technical) match, like many of the great Angle-Benoit matches in the past.

Kane vs Undertaker  7/10

I thought that it would have been nice to make this Hell In A Cell considering the history with both superstars......

The entrance was the best thing about the match

HHH vs Shawn Michaels vs Chris Benoit  10/10

The best match of the night(as it should be).  This is what wrestling is all about, they included just about everything that can be done, all 3 put on a great show.  The end seemed quite genuinely emotional for the winner...... a classic!

Event  7/10

Good but not the brilliant event that it should of been, many events surpass this, WM17, NWO2001/03, SurSer2002 , SumSlam 02/03, im sure there are more, I haven't seen them all.  If only the event was as good as the DVD packaging! I was expecting at least 3  10/10 matches and lots and lots more  in the  8s and 9s but sadly that is not so. Well Im hoping that WM21 will be what WMXX should have been.

Extras  10/10

You will not get better than this from WWE. The main event here is the Top 10 WM matches ever!  With a 4 minute montage of each match.  I wish they used a whole disk for this, but its still fantastic! Also interviews (pre/post match), TV Promos, Mania of Wrestlemania (45 min program on MM19) and Wrestlmania Gallery(Results/facts/photos from every mania)

Picture Quality  8/10

Good, but WWE has produced better

Sound Quality  7/10

Some noticeable problems with commentary volume

Overall:  7.5/10

WHATS NEXT FOR WWE

WrestleManiaXX where it all begins again... Only its more like the end of an era, because WWE will struggle over the next few years, and here's why.  Since 2003 A-Class Superstars have been dropping off the WWE roster like flies:

Hulk Hogan  -  Jeff Hardy  -  The Rock  -  Goldberg  -  Brock Lesnar  -  Stone Cold

Now just look at that list.  Those names were the foundations of WWE success so far thus millennium, so where do they go from here? Only time will tell.",1090627200,,4335,4.431673052362708

US Title
John Cena V Big Show
At first Big Show dominates a lot. Near the end it gets good though, with 2 FUs and Cena using brass knucks. The crowd were into it, and overall it was a nice opener to the show. 7/10
World Tag Titles
Booker and RVD V Dudleys V La Resistance V Jindrak & Cade
The rules of the match a pretty stupid really, it would have been better with just 2 teams. However it gets pretty good towards the end, with RVD hitting the 5-star frog splash. 6/10
Christian V Chris Jericho
To be honest I wasn't really expecting it, but I really liked this match. They did some great moves and the pace was great. It never got boring and was enjoyable all the way through. Also there's a great twist at the end. 9/10
Evolution (Flair/Orton/Batista) V Rock & Sock Connection
It's a shame that Foley and Orton didn't have their hardcore match at this event rather than Backlash the next month. However this was a good match, with some good moments. Flair and Rock worked really well together. Also Rock's promo before the match is pretty cool. 7/10
Playboy Evening Gown Match
Sable & Torrie V Stacey & Jackie
This match was very bad, and wasted time in which some good wrestlers (like Matt Hardy) could have had a match. CRAP! 1/10
Cruiserweight Title Open
Chavo V Noble V Funaki V Ultimo V Rey V Nunzio V Tajiri V Shannon V Kidman
This could have been longer, but there were still some good moves, as you'd expect from the cruiserweights. Kidman and Rey were both great The best part was Kidman's shooting star press to the outside of the ring. The match format was interesting too, with 2 men in at a time. Also, look out for Funaki, who lasts just 3 seconds! 8/10
Goldberg V Brock Lesnar
Special referee = Stone Cold Steve Austin
This match had loads of buildup and could have been awesome. However it was a massive disappointment. Both Brock and Goldberg were leaving after this match, and the crowd knew it. The match was very bad too, with barely any moves, except a few specials. The staredown at the start was stupidly long too and very boring. Disappointment of the night by far! At least Austin stunners both Brock and Goldberg after though. 3/10
WWE Tag Titles
Scotty & Rikishi V APA V Bashams V TWGTT
Another fatal four-way? Again, it would have been better with just 2 teams, although there was buildup between these 4. The ending was a bit sudden, but overall this was a decent match. It seemed even better after the Brock/Goldberg crap. 6/10
Women's Title
Victoria V Molly
This could have been a little bit longer actually, as it could have been one of the better women's matches. Then again maybe being short saved it. A roll-up ending by Victoria meant Molly got her head shaved, which was pretty funny and gets the match an extra star. 5/10
WWE Title
Eddie Guerrero V Kurt Angle
A very good technical match, I liked it a lot. It was just as good as the Jericho/Christian match. They do lots of cool technical moves, and there are some cool near finishes. In the end Eddie unties his boot, and kicks it off when Kurt goes for an ankle lock and then get the roll-up for the win. A unique and cool ending! 9/10
Undertaker V Kane
Undertaker's return was very cool, with the whole arena going dark, and then Paul Bearer coming out. Finally Taker came out. It's a shame his attire isn't that different though, he just comes to the ring with a hat and coat thing. Kane's entrance was also pretty cool. As for the match though, it was too short. Taker goes for old school but Kane reverses and chokeslams Taker. Taker sits up and then does his chokeslam followed by Tombstone for the 1 2 3. It was a good match but far too short. I'll give it an extra star for the return of the Dead-Man style Undertaker and the entrances. 7/10
World Heavyweight Title
Chris Benoit V Triple H V Shawn Michaels
This was an amazing triple threat match. I was surprised they didn't use any weapons, but Shawn gets busted open and bleeds loads. Triple H also bleeds quite a lot, and there's a great spot where HHH and HBK double suplex Benoit from the Spanish announce table through the Smackdown announce table. There some really close near falls, good submissions and loads of brilliant moves. It was great at the end as Shawn is thrown out of the ring and Benoit makes The Game tap out to the crippler crossface. Finally Benoit won the title (he should have done about 3 or 4 years ago, but that made this even more special). Then Eddie comes out to congratulate him. 2 friends who entered the WWE together had climbed to the top of the mountain, as Eddie had won his WWE first title a month earlier at No Way Out and then successfully defended against Kurt earlier in the night. There couldn't have been a more perfect ending to WrestleMania XX as Eddie and Benoit hug each other and celebrate their wins. 10/10
Overall
The event was way too over hyped. This wasn't the best PPV ever, it actually wasn't the best WrestleMania ever either. WrestleMania X-Seven is still the best WM and PPV ever. However this was still a great event and well worth buying. The top 3 matches are World Title, WWE Title and Jericho/Christian. Also there are loads of extras on the DVD.",1089504000,,5181,4.449001051524711
2022494,4,B0001OGVQ2,"This was certainly not the best PPV ever or even the best Wrestlemania ever.  Hell, I liked 19 better.

Cena/Show- I'm sorry but borrrrrring match dominated by Show.  The only good part was the ending. 3/10

Christian/Jericho- Pretty damn good match, the event picks up here. 8/10

Evolution vs. Rock and Sock- Another damn good match. 8/10

Playboy evening gown is fun if you like nice asses.

Didn't see the cruiserweight open, heard it was just decent.

Lesnar/Goldberg- Well let's see they stall for a few MINUTES, grapple, push eachother away, and stall for about five more minutes.  Terrible, TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE, AWFUL match.  Possibly the worst match in wrestlemania history.  I didn't expect much from this match, but I expected better than what I saw.  Skip this match, it's just indescribably painful to watch.  0/10

Smackdown Tag title fatal 4 way- 6/10

Women's title match- good women's match 7/10

Angle/Eddy G.- Very good match as one could expect from this duo 8.5/10

Taker/Kane- I actually really enjoyed the actual match.  Granted, taker's attire still lacked the precise oldschool/deadman look, it was neat to see deadman taker again and the match itself was surprisingly good. 8.5/10

Michaels/HHH/Benoit for the Raw title- AWESOME.  I don't know if I'd call it the single greatest WM match ever but certainly one of the best.  Just everything you'd expect from a great match. 10/10",1089244800,,1446,5.012658227848101
2022495,4,B0001OGVQ2,"Calling this the greatest Wrestlemania ever is going overboard, I think III, X, and X-Seven will put this one in it's place. However, this was waaaaay better than X-8 and a boatload better than XIX.
The Good
 The World Heavyweight Title Match was awesome. Triple H, HBK, and Benoit really tore it up, and Benoit coming out on top was the icing on the cake. This one here is on my top ten list of greatest Wrestlemania matches of all time, but falls short of Savage-Steamboat, HBK-Hall Ladder Match, Bret vs. Owen, & Bret vs. Stone Cold.
 The WWE title match between Eddie Guerrero and Kurt Angle was stellar, and the psychology between them was neat. Eddie outsmarting Angle in the end was pure genius.
 Rock & Foley vs. Evolution was very entertaining, especially the exchanges between Rock and Flair. Orton and Batista held their own, but Foley shined the most here. Great match.
 Christian vs. Chris Jericho had a solid outing, would of been better if this match opened the show. The Trish heel turn in the end wasn't too shocking to me, but it seemed to get a nice reaction from the crowd.
 Good WM tribute to the recently inducted WWE Hall of Famers. Funny skit with Coach, Mean Gene/Bobby the Brain, and Moolah/Mae Young. I liked the mini interview with Jesse Ventura and Donald Trump.
In the Middle
 Nice stuff in the Cruiserweight Open, but the match was waaaaay too short for me.
 The World Tag Team Title Match was rushed, and the team of Jindrak and Cade had no reason being there, but nice effort by Booker/RVD, the Dudley's, and Dupree/Conway.
 The Women's Title Match was too short and a let down. Molly and Victoria are two of the best workers in the Women's Division (Jazz and Trish are the other two.). Got more depressing as beautifal Molly was shaved bald.
The Bad
 But it's alright to give a decent amount of match time for the Playboy Evening Gown match. Short of nothing we've already seen before a billion times before.
 I was siked to see Taker return to the Deadman gimmick, not as siked to see the same old Taker-Kane match.
WWE Tag team Title Match was a total mess.
Cena vs. The Big Show, only thing good here was cena taking the US title, match was bad all around.
Brock vs. Goldberg bombed big time. Worst Match of the Year so far. Unsympathetic crowd and Austin stunning both guys afterwards made up for such a pathetic match.
Your skip button will be busy, but hey you got at least four good matches worth seeing.
The extra's. Your usual WM pre and post comments, plus a Heat match between Venis/Storm vs. The Dudley Boyz, that was way better than all the matches I listed being bad and mediocre. The third disc is the gem here. You get to play WM Trivia, with responses to correct and wrong answers by All three Dudley Boyz, Victoria, Rhyno, Kurt Angle, Mick Foley, and Al Snow. Foley and Snow's responses are hilarious. If you missed the Spike-TV special Wrestlemania's Ten Greatest Matches, it's on the third disc as well, along with Wrestlemania the Movie bits featuring, Rock,Austin, Taker, HBK, Brock, and Angle. The deleted scenes are there two, featuring Booker, Triple H, Vince , and Hogan, plus a ehind the scenes look as Jesse Ventura does the voice overs for the movie. Neat stuff.

6. CRUISERWEIGHT INVITAIONAL MATCH

7. GOLDBERG VS. BROCK LESNAR

12. TRIPLE THREAT MATCH FOR THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP; TRIPLE H VS. SHAWN MICHAELS VS. CHRIS BENOIT
GREAT MATCH FROM BEGINNING TO END. THIS MATCH WAS NEVER BORING. THIS IS THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE ENTIRE EVENT. AND IT IS A LONG OVERDUE VICTORY FOR CHRIS BENOIT. BENOIT ONCE HELD THE WCW TITLE BACK IN 2000, BUT THAT REIGN WAS PRETTY MUCH A FLUKE COMPARED TO THIS. A MUST-SEE MATCH RATING; 5/5

Disc 2 contains a match from Sunday Night Heat that aired the night of WrestleMania. It also has footage of the WWF Hall Of Fame ceremony as well as pre-match and post-match comments from John Cena, Christian, RVD, Booker T., Molly and others.
Disc 3 is the one that makes this a keeper! WWE Films presents ""The Mania Of WrestleMania."" It is a look back at WrestleMania 19 narrated by none other than Jesse ""The Body"" Ventura! This mini documentary will both amaze and entertain but some of the details (particularly behind the Rock/Austin match) will shock you! Also, ""The Ten Best WrestleMania Matches"" special is on here too. It was narrated by ""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair! Also, WrestleMania trivia, photos and gallery are featured as well!

UNITED STATES CHAMPIONSHIP
Big Show (c) v. Jon Cena ***1/2
Great opening match. Cena just looks so so so excited to be there. Big Show preforms well in losing his title.
WORLD TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP
RVD/Booker T (c) v. The Dudley Boyz v. La Resistance v. Jindrak/Cade **
Again, tag team wrestling has gone to hell. I'd really like to see just two teams go at it for once. Enough of this stuff. Fast paced, but it puts me to sleep.
Christian v. Chris Jericho ****
Besides the title matches, this was by far the match of the night. Jericho was his usual brilliant self, but it was Christian who stole the show in this one. He's probobly the most underrated star in the WWE right now. He's moving up fast and earned a well-deserved mania victory. Not a dull moment with one hell of a twist in the end.
Rock n Sock v. Evolution ****
Another good match. Not the greatest in terms of wrestling, but by FAR the most purely entertaining match of the night. Rock and Flair are hysterical together. Foley is just oozing with class and puts over Orton. Orton does his part too. Very fun match.
PLAYBOY EVENING GOWN MATCH
Sable/Torrie v. Stacy/ Miss Jackie *
Matt Hardy was left off of the card for this. Awful
CRUSERWEIGHT OPEN **1/2
I'm not a big big fan of Cruserweights, but I was excited for this match and a little let down. I thought it was going to More of a battle royal type thing or at least the format they had with Chavo mixed in insted of at the end. Not bad though. Billy Kidman impresses big time.
Brock Lesnar v. Bill Goldberg **
Stone Cold shouldn't have been involved in this to begin with. Brock announcing he was leaving and Goldberg almost def. leaving really put the crowd on edge. They really rode both of these guys bigtime. The match was just bad all the way down. Circumstance and poor booking killed this match. Biggest dissapointment of the night by a long shot.
WWE Tag Team Titles
Scotty/ Rikishi(c) v. APA v. The Bashams v. TWGTT **
TWGTT really put on a cool show here. Again nothing to get excited about though. Typical tag team bore fest.
WOMENS CHAMPIONSHIP
Molly Holly v. Victoria(c) **1/2
I'm not the greatest fan of women's wrestling, but lemme tell ya, these girls can put together a hell of a match. For women this was outstanding. The hair stipulation also added to it. I enjoyed it.
WWE CHAMPIONSHIP
Eddie Guererro(c) v. Kurt Angle *****
Thrilling match. Technical materpeice. Great Ending. I knew this would be good going in, but this match really blew me away. Loved every second of it.
The Undertaker v. Kane ***
Super hyped match. A great return for the dead man, it's just this match was SO predictable. The two worked a little slow, but for entertainment value alone, I'll give this an extra star.
WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP
Triple H(c) v. Shawn Michaels v. Chris Benoit *****
Off the charts. Second best mania main event I have ever seen besides the Rock and SCSA at WM17... Still, a phenominal match with an AMAZING spot on the table, good use of the outside area... what impressed me is that we didn't see any weapons used. They put together such and incredibly entertaining match and the ending is appropriate. Benoit was way way way overdue for the moment, but then again, that's what made it so special. Best ending to a wrestlemania ever.",1086480000,8,3498,4.475743348982785
2022537,5,B0001OGVQ2,"WMXX was the most hyped Wrestlemania event in years, and it lived up to all the expectation. The DVD is great, featuring the best documentary I've ever seen, ""The Mania of Wrestlemania"", and the ""Wrestlemania's 10 Greatest Matches"" hosted by Ric Flair. On to the event itself:
1. John Cena vs. Big Show (c) for the U.S. Title
Great way to kick of Wrestlemania. Cena, who had been a worthy title-holder for quite some time, finally gets his chance here. Big Show gets in most of the offense, and Cena finally defeats Big Show after hitting 2 FU's (with the help of some brass knucks). 7.5/10
2. RVD/Booker T(c) vs. La Resistance vs. The Dudleys vs. Garrison Cade/Mark Jindrak for the World Tag Titles
Pretty good tag match, despite the fact that RVD and Booker T were a very unusual team to be tag champs. It was fast-paced except for when Rob Conway was in and kept doing boring submission manuevers. Finish sees RVD pinning Conway via the 5-Star Frog Splash.  7/10
3. Chris Jericho vs. Christian
This match nearly rivaled Michaels vs. Jericho from the previous Wrestlemania. There was never a dull moment in this match, and Christian really showed how talented he is. Both men went all out, and the ending was very unexpected, as Christian rolls up Jericho following interference by Trish. 9/10
4. Rock n' Sock vs. Evolution
This was a really good tag match. Evolution, which is a great stable, put on their best match yet against The Rock and Mick Foley. It was great to see Rock and Foley in action again. Flair was entertaining as usual and Orton really became a major star after this one. The finish saw Orton delivering an RKO out of nowhere on Mick Foley.  8.5/10
5. Evening Gown Match- Jackie and Stacy vs. Sable and Trish
Not a very good match, used strictly to please the male fans. I'm a male fan and I didn't really care for this one too much. Worst match of the evening.  3/10
6. Cruiserweight Open
This was a sweet cruiserweight match, where all of the CWs got to display their talents on the grand stage. Billy Kidman hit a sick shooting star press on the outside, and Rey Mysterio was flying all over the place as usual. Finish sees Chavo Sr. helping Chavo get the pin on Mysterio.  8.5/10
7. Goldberg vs. Brock Lesnar with Stone Cold as referee
It was disappointing, but not completely horrible. I expected much better out of Lesnar. He goes from beating Kurt Angle in an amazing technical match to this. A very unnecessary slow start, but once they got going there were some pretty cool moments. Goldberg wins with a jackhammer, and he and Lesnar both receive stunners. 6/10
8. Scotty and Riskisi (c) vs. Bashams vs. TWGTT vs. The APA
Not quite as good as RAW's tag match, but still a good match. TWGTT put on the best performance in this match. In the end, Rikishi crushed Doug Basham for the pin after a Clothesline from Hell from Bradshaw.  7/10
9. Molly Holly vs. Victoria (c)
I'm not a big fan of women's wrestling at all, and this match really was no exception. Lackluster match with a rollup finish, and Molly getting her head shaved afterwards really wasn't all that great either.  5/10
10. Kurt Angle vs. Eddie Guerrero (c) for WWE Title
I expected a good match, but I was shocked by this one. This match was AWESOME. Kurt wrestled a flawless match, and I was very impressed with Guerrero's use of technical moves. I was so impressed with Angle though that I was hoping he would win the match. In the end, Guerrero unties his boot, and it slips off as Angle goes for the ankle lock. Guerrero then uses a small package for the win.  10/10
11. Undertaker vs. Kane
The most hyped match of the night. Unlike a lot of people, I thought Taker's return was better than expected. I got the chills when he came out. Most people say Kane got no offense in, but they must have not been paying attention to the match. Kane got in as much, if not MORE offense in than Taker, it just had little effect. Taker finishes him off with the Tombstone.
10/10...for the best return in WWE history.
12. Triple H (c) vs. Chris Benoit vs. HBK- World Heavyweight Championship
Chris Benoit has been my favorite wrestler since I started watching wrestling. And now here he was, he had made it into the main event at Wrestlemania. 3 of the best of all time in the ring at the same time. This was truly a dream match. Every man gave it everything they had, and put on the most spectacular match I've ever seen. The finish came as the mighty Triple H tapped out to the crossface. Afterwards, Guerrero came out and congratulated Benoit, and the two men hugged. I admit it, that made me cry.  10/10",1086393600,,4592,4.491017964071856
2022538,5,B0001OGVQ2,"What a great DVD to own, bought it the first day it came out evntough I saw live when first aired.  The packaging starting from the front cover and the inside folding backround is awesome.  From watching wrestling for so many years, the intensity of this event at Madison Square Garden was spectactular, the crowd was just unbelivable.  I enjoyed mostly every match, with an exeption of a few.  The Crusierweight tournament was completly rushed, not very entertaining.  The evening gown match was just to treat the men, pure entertainment nothing else.  Although I felt it got critisized too much, Goldberg Vs. Lesnar was still a little dissapointing, both men did not show there best stuff, the crowd let them know too, since it was indeed the last match for both men for the company at unless otherwise..  The long stare down at first was not very fun to sit through.  If you watch this match, you may like the crowd reaction more so than the actual wrestling.  The ending was wierd, as Stone Cold shows he is a man.  The ending to the Christian Vs. Jericho match was funny.  Angle Vs. Guerrero was anice solid match, what wrestlemania should be all about.  The main event was a classic, great way to close out the show.  The extra are great, which include Pre and Post match Wrestler Comments.  Many interesting notes from the previuos Wrestlemania'a, Ten Greatest matches, sevral sets of trivia questions, delted scenes, some hidden easter eggs, A phot gallery from all 19 prior Wrestlemani'a with results.

1. John Cena vs. The Big Show
Good way to start off wrestlemania. Good rap by Cena but should have been in a midcard slot. 7.5/10
2. Fatal 4 way for world tag team titles
A good match but all 8 men could have put a better effort. 6/10
3. Chris jericho vs. Christian
Good match, had very good high spots in the match. Christian and Jericho were very consistent. Trish also turning heel was good. 8/10
4. Handicap match: Evolution vs the rock & sock connection
Electrifying. The Rock is one of the best on the mic and in the ring. Mick Foley is amazing. Ric Flair did a good job and Batista and Randy Orton are becoming more and more impressive.
9/10
5. Playboy evening gown match
A good filler of time. It gives the men what they want,so i give this a 10/10.
6.cruiser weight open
Good high spots, but to short. Probably giving time for the undeserving Lesnar, Goldberg match. 8/10
7. Brock vs. Goldberg w/stone cold as special referree
Worst match, the reason the ppv went down hill. I love both Goldberg and Lesnar but I expected both of them to fight,not just some staredown and their finishing moves. austin saved them. 2/10
8. Fatal 4 way for the wwe tag titles
Ok match i thought the raw tag would be better but the SD! titles was much better. 7/10
9. Victoria vs. Molly holly
Just skip. 2/10
10. Eddie Guerrero vs. Kurt angle wwe championship
great match. Guerrero is a great champion and Angle is amazing. These two put on a hell of contest, and both deserve to be champion. 10/10
11.undertaker vs. kane
OK match, Taker is better as the american badass cause of his age and skill. Kane hasn't looked better in a long time.very good opener but short match. 7/10
12. triple threat: Triple h vs. HBK vs. Chris Benoit
An amazing contest, I have great respect for all three of these men, but I think the right man came out on top. 10/10
Overall a great ppv, but not the best wrestlemania. Brock goldberg match brought the whole crowd down. Probably should have came on before the triple threat.",1085270400,,2120,4.383248730964467

The card featured many different wrestling styles: hardcore, brawling, technical, high flying, slugfest. You name it, it was on this card. All of the matches were good, even Goldberg-Lesnar (i.e. I know the match sucked, and the crowd hated it, but if you watch the match with the volume muted, it is a pretty good match after all :) So, I recommend this to everyone.

1st match- John Cena vs Big Show.

2nd match- Rvd/Booker T vs Dudley boyz vs Jinjarak/Cade vs La ressistance.
Good Tag match lots of good moves especially when Bokker hit the scissor kicked on Rene Dupree and then RVD came out of knowhere with a Five Star. 7/10

Not that good to short and too little moves. The only good thing about it is what there wearin.

6th match- Brock Lesnar vs Goldberg (Stone Cold special referee).
Not as good as expected and could of been much better,but still ok. The match got off to a slow start and the crowd even started to shout Borin Borin and it was. But got better as the match went on. The best bit was when Stone Cold stunned Goldberg and Lesnar at the end. 6/10

I was glad to see Victoria win.
6/10
9th match- Eddie Guerro vs Kurt Angle.
Very good match. Very technical and one of the best of the night.
Eddie undid his boot so when Kurt went for the Angle lock Eddies boot would come off. 9/10
10th match- Undertaker vs Kane.
Good too see the Undertaker back in action. He kicked the hell out of Kane. 8/10
11th match- Chris Benoit vs Triple H vs Shawn Michaels.
BEST MATCH EVER.
All men put on a great performance. There was everything you expect from a main event , blood suprises good wrestleing moves etc. I was shocked when HBK and HHH worked together to suplex Benoit through the announcers desk.
The crowd even booed Michaels wich is unusual.
I wish HBK had of won but Benoit is just as good.
1000000000/10
This DVD is worth gettin for just the main event.

2022555,5,B0001OGVQ2,"I just got my WM XX DVD today, and while I have not watched it yet, I can say that this is the best packaged DVD that the WWE has ever made.
I won't take the time to bog you down with match by match ratings of all the matches. I actually was in NYC for this event and as a fan that has always wanted to see wrestling in MSG, this was a dream come true.
Wrestlemania XX, lives up to the hype. For me personally it was everything a ""Mania"" is supposed to be. I have been a devout fan of the WWE since WM 2. I thought this event was very strong. The production was great and the celibration of 20 years of this event was truly amazing to behold.
From the beginning for me, it was very emotional. Watching clips of past WM's was unbelievable. As I thought about some of my favorite matches over the years. While many are quick to site wrestling's ""fakeness"" I thought to myself, how these moments made me feel as a fan that really believes in what Vince and Co. does. I am one of the people that ""Get's it""!
What can be said about the event that has not already been said. The expectations were very high for a showcase of this magnitude, and it did not disapoint. From the opening match with John Cena winning the US Title, to the incredible atheletic displays during both of the Heavyweight Title matches, this was truly an AWESOME show.
It simply goes without saying, if you are a fan of the WWE this is one DVD that you must have in your collection.
The term ""Special Edition"" gets thrown around a lot in the DVD world. I can say that this truly is a Special Edition and one that derserves that title. I think it's awesome that the ""Mania of Wrestling"" Documentary and the ""WM's 10 Greatest Matches""  are both featured. Truly and incredible collection.
There is always much speculation about whether Vince listens to the fans or not, and I do not know if he does or does not, but one thing is for sure. Vince and the WWE really knew what they were doing when they put this collection together.
WWE fans enjoy!

2022556,5,B0001OGVQ2,"This was probably one of the best Wrestlemanias of all time. There was really only one terrible match and it was not expected to be a 5 star match.
U.S. Title- Big Show vs. John Cena-  This match was a good opener.  The pace was just a little slower than most due to Big Show.  John Cena's usual antics also made the match entertaining and the crowd was on.  3.5/5.
Fatal Four-Way World Tag Titles- RVD & Booker T vs. Dudley Boyz vs. Mark Jindrak & Garrison Cade vs. La Resistance-  Good match with false finishes and blind tags.  A lot of action but a hard format to have a great match.  3.5/5.
Chris Jericho vs. Christian- Awesome match with nonstop action.  Style reminded me a little of a faster Michaels vs. Jericho from WMXIX.  I was 50/50 on whether Trish would turn or not.  4/5.
Rock'n'Sock Connection vs. Evolution-  Very good match especially for a tag/handicap match.  Foley looked good and Rock and Flair were hilarious.  4/5.
Playboy Evening Gown Match-  Torrie Wilson & Sable vs. Stacy Keibler vs. Jackie-  This was the terrible match.  Torrie used the O'Conoroll, no joke.  For Torrie's flying cross body and the hot Divas 1/5.
Cruiserweight Open with the 10 best WWE cruiserweights-  Action packed match.  A little rushed with the finishes but a lot of high-flying stuff.  4/5.
Goldberg vs. Brock Lesnar with Stone Cold Steve Austin as Guest Referee- Good but definitely not the best match.  They were stupid to stand around for 6 minutes(I timed it) staring at each allowing the fans to bash them.  Other than that it was fairly good.  3/5.
Fatal Four-Way WWE Tag Titles- Scotty 2 Hotty & Rikishi vs. APA vs. World's Greatest Tag Team vs. Basham Brothers- Good but not as good as RAW's.  A little slower and shorter and some guys are less involved.  3/5.
Women's Championship- Victioria vs. Molly Holly- Good women's match but not as good as their Rumble one from HeAT.  2.5/5.
WWE Championship- Eddie Guerrero vs. Kurt Angle- Awesome technical match with plenty of action.  You've got to love the champ.  4.5/5.
Undertaker vs. Kane- Good return match for Taker.  Of course it's a little slower but it's the perfect length.  A classic Wrestlemania moment for the future with Taker's return.  3.5/5.
Triple-Threat World Heavyweight Championship Match- Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels vs. Chris Benoit- Great match especially for a triple-threat. Nonstop action.  One of the greatest Wrestlemania matches of all time.  5/5.
All in all, one of the most solid PPVs you'll see.  Easily in the top 5 Wrestlemanias, maybe in the top 2 or 3.  A pure masterpiece.  Really one for the collection.  Just watching this shows doubters why people love wrestling.",1083369600,,2662,4.771428571428571

2022559,3,B0001OGVQ2,"It seems like every match this year was forced.  Goldberg/Lesnar could have been awesome but the two stalled too much.  Angle/Eddie was OK.  They're both great performers and could have done much more.  HHH/HBK/Benoit was good but a triple-threat is never as good as a one on one match up.  Last year, Angle and Lesnar put on a tremendous match and that's due to the fact that it's one on one.  WM XIX was so much better than XX.  The tag team matches were horrible.  HBK vs Y2J is the best match I've ever seen in my life.  If you've never seen it, I'm sorry.  The extras on the disc are worth the price alone.  Seeing Hulk Hogan lace his boots up along side Kurt Angle is just priceless.

2022560,5,B0001OGVQ2,"1. The Dudley Boys Vs. Val Venis & Lance Storm - From SNHeat (On Disk 2), the winner goes to the RAW fatale 4-way. Speaking of Heat, man the Garden crowd was popping like crazy for every move. *** / 5 stars
2. Big Show Vs. John Cena - U.S. title match - Pretty slow match for an opener, can Cena defeat the 500 lb monster? *1/2
3. RVD/Booker T Vs. La Resisteance Vs. Cade/Jindrake Vs. Dudleys - Fatale 4-way which means whoever gets the pin wins the match and the title. Remember when tag team wrestling was cool? Still this was slightly entertaining. **1/2
4. Chris Jericho Vs. ""CLB"" Christian - In Christian head, Trish Stratus played a Yoko Ono by breaking up their tag team, So he beat up Trish. Now Jericho is determined to get revenge in her honor! ***1/2
5. Mic Foley/The Rock Vs. Flair/Orton/Batista - After countless beatings, and 4 years out of the ring, hardcore legend Mic Foley needed help to take care of Evolution. So he recruited The Rock from Hollywood to help settle the feud. Ric Flair's and The Rocks off-beat shinanigans bump this up to ***1/2

7. 10-Man Crusierweight Elimination Match - 2 men start off, and when one is eliminated (pinned or taps) another man jumps in until everyone is eliminated. 10 men, ~ 10 min. Non-stop action and I still think Chavo Guerrero Sr. should be wrestling! Will the Cruiserweight division EVER get any respect? Still Ultimo Dragons gets a WM paycheck so I'm happy. ****

12. Chris Benoit Vs. Triple H Vs. Shawn Michaels - 3-way match for the RAW World Championship - Whoever gets the pin is the Champion, so your fighting off another wrestler while trying to get a pin. The Past meets the Present meets the Future. NON-STOP action! ****1/2

2022561,3,B0001OGVQ2,"I just bought the video version yesterday and I will warn you that if you want the full card, get the DVD because the VHS only has the main marquee matches but no interviews, no video build up prior the event and no extras!
Now, those that are saying that his one was the best ought to rethink that.  While it didn't totally suck, it fell far from expectations Here is the review of the matches that are on the VHS version:
John Cena Vs. The Big Show - Alright opener. Cena isn't big like Brock Lesner but seeing him pick up 500lbs. for the F.U. is very impressive! I'd give this match 5/10.
Chris Jericho Vs. Christian - Surprisingly entertaining. While I do respect Y2J, I haven't thought of Christian since his tag team with Edge ended in 2001 but he could be a big star. I think having Trish Stratus with him does help him because while having her with Jericho would've made for a romantic angle, they are both pretty big stars and far ahead of Christian (Jericho being a former WWF/WWE Undisputed Champ while Trish is a multi-time Women's Champ). I was upset at first but the more I thought about it, having Trish with Christian instead may give him the boost he needs. 8/10 for the match and the surprise heel turn of Trish.
The Rock n Sock Connection Vs. Evolution - Nice to see Flair back in. Not a big ""Nature Boy"" mark but I am amazed the man can still get in the ring and perform at all. Another match that I was upset about at first but when I think about it, I think having Evolution win was the right call. Still, I would've went with a screwjob ending rather than a clean one since Evolution are supposed to be heels. Nice to see that The Rock has not let Hollywood life make him fat as he looked tremendous! 6/10 for the match.
Sable/Torrie Wilson Vs. Stacy Keibler/Miss Jackie - Total waste of time in my view. Just a T & A filler though it does show some potential from Stacy as more than just a model but as a wrestler. Same can be said for Torrie too. 3/10 for the match.
Brock Lesner Vs. Goldberg w/""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin as the ref - WORST MATCH ON THE CARD! These guys didn't do jack! This should've been the best match because both men can do tremendous things, especially Lesner but they did almost nothing! If it wasn't for Austin, this match would've totally blew! I am giving it 2/10 only because of Austin because if it wasn't for him, it would've got 0/10!
Eddie Gurrerro Vs. Kurt Angle (WWE Title Match) - Surprisingly even! While I do like Eddie Gurrerro, I've seen how tough Kurt Angle can be even against mat guys like Brock Lesner so I'd figure Kurt Angle would dominate but it was amazingly back and forth! Dirty but nice trick at the end by Gurrerro as he used a loose boot to wiggle out of Kurt's anklelock to get a small package to win the match and retain! 7/10 for the match, especially the creative ending!
The Undertaker Vs. Kane - The version shown here is more like ""The American Deadman"" rather than ""The Deadman."" Still, it was clearly the ""Dark"" Undertaker in his manerisms. Not a great match but the entrances of both UT and Kane make it worth watching. Nice to see Paul Bearer back too! 5/10 for the match.
SIDENOTE:  UT was in fantastic shape! The best I've seen him ever! He even looked in better shape than Kane (who is usually in better conditioned of the two).
Chris Benoit Vs. Shawn Michaels Vs. Triple H (World Heavyweight Title Triple Threat Match) - While I would've rathered have seen Benoit Vs. HHH one on one like it was SUPPOSED to have been, I can't knock the match itself. It was great! I also have to give HHH props for once and doing the right thing by jobbbing to Benoit rather than him beating Michaels, which I feared would happen. Touching ending at the end of this bout too. I won't give it away but it is heartwarming. I give this match 9/10 and the main reason to get this card!
Overall rating: 6/10. Wasn't a great WrestleMania but I have to say that the Triple Threat Match plus Gurrerro/Angle as well as Jericho/Christian with the surprise heel turn of Trish saved WM for totally going down the toilet!",1083110400,2,4082,4.3556430446194225

WWE World Tag Team Championship: Dudley Boyz Vs. La Resistance Vs. Mark Jinjrack & Garrison Cade Vs. Booker T & RVD (Champions)
Not much to see in this match, just your normal tag match with good stars wasted. 3/10
Christian Vs. Chris Jericho
One of the surprise matches of the night, both men really looked like they were into the match. The ending just completely blew me away. 7/10
2 on 3 match: Evolution (Randy Orton, Batista, & Ric Flair) Vs. Mick Foley & The Rock
I had high hopes for this match, and they were not meant really, they should do The Rock Vs. Flair in the future thanks to their chemistry in this match. 6/10
Playboy Eveningown Match: Miss. Jackie & Stacy Kiebler Vs. Torrie Wilson & Sable.
Horrible Match, the only reason you could watch this is the girls TRYING to fight in Bra & Panties. 2/10
Goldberg Vs. Brock Lesnar w/ ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin as the guest referee.
BIG dissapointment, all these competiters do is stare each other down and check stances. While the crowd chanted ""Boring"" and ""you sold out"" to Lesnar. After the match Austin drinks beer with the winner, (I'm not telling) and stuns them. 2.5/10
WWE Tag Team Championship: APA Vs. World's Greatist Tag Team Vs. The Basham Brothers Vs. Rikishi & Scotty 2 Hottie (Champions)
Same as the other 4 way match earlier. But worse. 3/10

  Mark Jindrak/Garrison Cade vs. La Resistance vs. The Dudley Boyz vs. RVD/Booker T(c): 5/10 Okay match, suffered from having too many other stellar matches on the card.
3. Chris Jericho vs. Christian: 9/10 Awesome match.  Both competitors are unbelieveably underrated and under utilzed. Almost a show stealer.
4. Mick Foley/The Rock vs. Ric Flair/Batista/Randy Orton: 8.5/10 Another great match. I'm not a big Rock fan, but anything with the legends Foley and Flair or soon to be legends Batista and Orton is definately worth watching.

  Kurt Angle vs. Eddie Guerreo: 9.5/10 A classic contest. I expected Angle to crush Eddie, Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Eddie fan, I just didn't think he was ready for the spotlight yet. I am very, very, pleased that he's proven me wrong.
11. Kane vs. The Undertaker: 8/10 Really wish taker had longer  hair, but the enterences for both were worth watching alone, then they have a pretty good match on top of it.
12. World Championship
  Shawn Micheals vs. Chris Benoit vs. Triple H(c): 10/10 Unquestionalbly the best match of the night. An instant classic. For me this was worth the price of the ppv on it's own. All three of these guys proved once again why they are some of the best the world has ever seen.

2022584,3,B0001OGVQ2,"This was not the ""Greatest Wrestlemania of All Time"". It barely breaks the top ten of Wrestlemania's.  There have been so many better shows, Wrestlemania and other PPV's, throughout the years.

Cena versus Big Show was a decent match, nothing special. 5/10
Y2J versus Christian.  Jericho is my favorite wrestler around right now and I really like the CLB too.  These guys were not given enough time.  Good match but too short and with a bad ending.  Hopefully Trish won't be so frickin' annoying now that she is a heel again.  6/10
The Triple Threat for the title was a good match but far from the ""Greatest Wrestlemania Main Event of All Time"".  Look into Rock vs. Austin at WM 17.  Shawn vs. Bret in an Ironman Match at WM 12.  Both of those matches were far superior.  8/10
The women's match was a waste of potential.  Both ladies are very proven but were not given a good opportunity.  Crowd also sucked during this one.  4/10
What wastes of time were both of the tag matches and that God-forsaken Playboy Evening Gown debacle.  They all three get to share the same space in my review. 0/10 0/10 1/10(for lingire only)
The Cruiserwieght Battle Royal was a nice waste of time too.  Theses guys are all very talented but the match was horrible.  Short, but pointless.  Reminded me a lot of the Gimmick Battle Royal at WM 17.  At least that one was supposed to be funny (Ultimo Dragon slipping during his intro...TWICE!). 3/10
Brock versus Goldberg?  Somebody shoot me.  Good riddance to that pouty, no talented and uncoordinated Goldberg.  WWE is a better place without him.  Brock had great potential and talent but never fully utilized it.  See ya later Lesnar.  Oh, the match?  Worse that than passing a kidney stone the size of a golfball.  Thank your makers that Stone Cold was out there because the fans may have rioted were it to be otherwise.  1/10 (for the saving presence of good ol' Steve)
Rock and Sock against Evolution.  What a waste of the Rock's one comeback match of the year.  This was nothing more than a decent Raw main event.  6/10
Undertaker and Kane.  Good match.  Very short and didn't really deliver the promise of ""The Deadman"" returning.  Undertaker was more like ""The American Deadman"".  Paul Bearer's return was the highlight of this one.  Oh, and Kane's entrance rocked too.  6/10
Kurt versus Eddie.  Decent match considering that Kurt should not have been wrestling for the second consecutive Wrestlemania.  The match should have had a better ending.  Kurt Angle is possibly the greatest athlete and wrestler to ever step into a WWE ring.  He also has some of the greatest mic skills next to Stone Cold, The Rock and Jericho.  8/10
If I have forgotten anything than that is because the PPV was very forgettable.
I saw Backlash yesterday an must say that it was a far better PPV than Wretlemania was.  Much like 1999 when Backlash was the PPV that Wretlemania should have been, the same can be said for this year.  Just because the WWE and the announcers tell you that Wrestlemania was the greatest thing since Donald Trump's hair does not make it true.
I am a huge WWE fan and have been for nearly 20 years.  I still love the company but this was just a bad show.  The end.",1082332800,4,3206,4.584805653710247

2022588,5,B0001OGVQ2,"This was my second Wrestlemania and let me just say this. Madison Square Garden was Awsome. March 14th 2004 was truly THE SHOWCASE OF THE IMMURTULES.Are seats were so close to the ring. The Brock and Goldberg match was cool when everbody started yelling to Brock ""You Soldout"" and ""You Suck"" then after the match when Austin Stunded Brock and Tossed Goldberg a beer and then stunded him to. The UNDERTAKER MATCH one word (OLD SCHOOL) R.I.P KANE.The triple threat match with HHH,HBK and Toothless Agression Chris is the man R.I.P STU.Latio Heat was on fire against ""Bald Angle"" The hall of fame speeches were cool to R.I.P JYD,BIG JOHN STUDD!!!

2022589,2,B0001OGVQ2,"With Wrestlemania 20 being hyped for a year, you think WWE would go out of their way to give the fans the best event of all time. On the contrary, this PPV was just plain boring.

The return of the ""Dead Man"" Vs. Kane: Nice new hat and Coat Taker. Where was the dead man we all were waiting to see? This match was a squash, niether wreslter looked good. *(...)
Golberg Vs. Lesnar: I think this match was one of the best all night, not because of the wrestling, but the fans were so into letting these two have it. I would say it was the best crowd reaction since Hogan Vs. The Rock at WM18. *(...)1/2
Triple threat- HBK Vs. HHH Vs. Benoit: The only match that lived up to the hype. Great Wrestling, Great story told throughout the entire match. (...)priceless. *(...)
 There were a lot of other matches during the 5 hour event, none realy worth watching or recapping. Overall, p1$(...) poor PPV. Do not buy this Wrestlemania!(...)",1081382400,2,930,4.401162790697675
2022590,5,B0001OGVQ2,"Wrestlemania XX was the night of the crippler. He defeated Triple H and Shawn Micheals in one of the most brutal Triple Treat matches ever. Well here are my reviews for Wrestlemania XX
within a scale of 1/10:
1)John Cena VS The Big Show 8/10
John Cena fu'd the Big show after a shot with those new custom Knucks. John Cena defineatly deserved the gold.
2)RVD and Boooker T VS Garrison Kade and Mark Jindrak VS The Dudley Boys VS La Ressitance 7/10
This match was quite good with RVD and Booker T retaining the titles after a scissors kick and a five star frogsplash on Rob Conway.
3)Chris Jericho VS Christian 10/10
This match was much better than I thought it would be Christian winning with a roll up on Chris Jericho. The end was suprising when Trish slapped Jericho.
4)Rock n' Sock connection VS Evolution 10/10
This match was very entertaining. The Rock and Flair looked as if they were having a great time. Evolution winning the match when Foley went to put Socko in Randy Orton's mouth but Randy hit the RKO before Socko came even close.
5)Torri Willson and Sable VS Miss Jackie and Stacy Kiebler 5/10
This match was quite short and nothing close to a evening gown
match,really. Torri with a roll up on Miss Jackie.
6)Crusierweight Open 8/10
This match was also quite short but good really high flying. Rey mysterio made it to the finals but Rey Mysterio got cheat again by Chavo Senior when he held Chavo's hand in the Roll up
helping Chavo get  the win.
7)Goldberg VS Brock Lesnar 6/10
Well this match was quite boring for both these wrestlers level
first they were staring at each other then they finnaly lock up testing each others strength. The end was what made this match good after Lesnar got jackhammered he got a stunner from Austin.
Goldberg also got stunned after a beer.
8)Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty VS The Basham Brothers VS The APA VS The Self Proclaimed Worlds Greatest Tag Team 7/10
Like the RAW Tag Team match the match was good. Rikishi with the Banzai Drop on one of the Bashams which lead Too Cool to victrory. They even put on a dance at the end of the match.
9)Molly VS Victoria 7/10
It was a decent match Victoria got a Roll up on Molly Holly.
Molly couldn't believe it and ran for her hair. Victoria caught her knocked her out and shaved her hair and Molly ran before
there was anymore laughter.
10)Kurt Angle VS Eddie Gurrero 10/10
This match was probably the second longest as it was approx: 20 minutes. The match was excellent. Eddie un tieing his shoes which made Kurt Angle's Ankle Lock sliped and Eddie quickly got in to the rollup.
11)Undertaker VS Kane 10/10
Well lets just say what a return. The Undertaker was not the only one who made a return so did Paul Bearer. The Undertaker dominated Kane right through the match. Kane countered Old School into a Chokeslam but the Undertaker just sat up. Undertaker won with a huge Tombstone Piledriver. At the end of the match Undertaker celebrated his record of 13-0 at Wrestlemania.
12) Triple H VS Shawn Micheals VS Chris Beniot 10/10
This was one helluva match with Triple H and Shawn Micheals
some amazing. Triple H and Shawn Micheals did some teamwork to
like sending Beniot in to a table which knocked him out for about five minutes. Chris Beniot got the Crippler Crossface on Triple H which made Triple H tap. At the end of the night both champions stood side by side holding their titles up high.

2022591,3,B0001OGVQ2,"Lets be honest. We probaly though this was going to be the best wrestlemania ever right? All the time weve been waiting for the day to come, all the hype been going on, about 5 hours long wasted. Most of the matches were bad and they just messed it all up. Do they take us for fools? It seems that way.
Here is some information on the matches:
1. John Cena VS Big Show: Match was never really gonna be that good as i knew especially with Big Show fighting a much smaller wrestler. It was a bit slow but at least the right man (Cena) won.  Rating: 4/10
2. Raw Tag Team Title Fatal Four Way: Match was ok though i don't think it should have been fatal four way. The Dudleys didn't really do much La Resistance was a bit bad and Garrison and Cade were too but Booker T and Van Dam did ok.  Rating: 4.5/10
3. Christian vs Y2J: Match was actually alright. It was a bit short but it turned out to be one of the best matches of the night. Also the ending was good at the end where Trish Stratus showed up.  Rating: 6.5/10
4. Evolution vs Rock and Sock Connection: Match was ok at times. Rock was good and Flair was funny at times. Foley was a bit of a dissapointment but since hes been out for 4 years, you cant really take it out on him. Batista could have done better. Orton and Foley fighting however was the best part.  Rating: 5.5/10
5. Playboy Evening Gown Match: Big mistake to have this match at Wrestlemania. I can see why they would have it but then most of the fans weren't intrested. The crowd seemed pretty dead the whole match.  Rating: 2/10
6. Cruiserweight Title match: match was a little dissapointing and i wasn't intrested much in this match at all. However there was some good parts so it wasn't completely unwatchable.  Rating: 5/10
7. Brock Lesnar vs Goldberg: What a dissapointment. After all the time waiting for them to fight in the ring, all the tension that has been building up and it turns out like this! Whats worse is that both wrestlers have the potential to put on a good match and they hardly do anything! And the crowd showed their hatred and quite frankly you cant blame them! Absoutely terrible match!  Rating: 2/10
8. Smackdown Tag Team Fatal Four Match: Bad Match. Should never have taken place. However some teams were good some were bad though it wasn't really anything to enjoy about Rating: 4/10
9. Molly vs Victoria Hair match: Nothing good about this match. Boring and bad at least they kept it short. Only good thing about it was Molly getting her head shaved at the end which was the highlight of the match.  Rating: 1.5/10
10. Kurt Angle vs Eddie Guerrero: Good match. Both contenders put on a good show. Eddie and Angle are 2 of the best wrestlers in WWE and it was a good choice to have these 2 slugging it out in the ring. Though it was a bit short, it turned out to be one of the best matches and id like to see them fight again if possible.  Rating: 7/10
11. Undertaker vs Kane: Big dissapointment for Undertakers deadman gimmick. He looked so bad it was embarrasing to have him back. He looked terrible. The match was bad as well proving that Taker is past it.  Rating: 3/10
12. Triple Threat Match: Match of the night. All wrestlers put on a good show and the fans enjoyed it. This is one of the best matches to have taken at an event this year in WWE and it was very watchable. Also Benoit winning the title was a good choice since its about time he good a decent title.  Rating: 8/10
Overall wrestlemania 20 was dissapointing. Too many matches took place. some were bad some were good. However Vince should have known better.",1081209600,,3575,4.312965722801788
2022592,5,B0001OGVQ2,"This was if not the greatest, one of the greatest WrestleMania's of all time. Sure, Brock-Goldberg sucked, but Austin stunnin' both of them was awesome. The Triple-Threat Main Event was, (in my view), the GREATEST main event of all time. This match by itself made up for all the semi-crappy matches. The U.S. title opener was great. Yes, Big Show DOES suck. The two tag title matches were pretty good, but it would have been nice if one of the two would have changed hands. Rikishi and S2H??? Give me a break... That one hurt. Rock and Sock vs. Evolution was a good match, but it had the wrong result. I expected more out of the Great One. The evening gown MATCH itself wasn't all that great, but the four women involved in the match, parading around in lingerie was attention-keeping for the five minutes they were in the ring. Taker/Kane was nothing compared to their WM14 battle. It was nice to see a tombstone again though... The women's championship was actually a pretty good match, and watchin Molly get her head shaved was worth it. Y2J vs. Christian was an great match, and their Backlash match will be even better. And who could have predicted THAT ending...WOW...Trish as a heel will be interesting. The Cruiserweight match had a lot of crazy little high-flying S.O.B.'s. This match should have been longer... Rey got Robbed!!! Still a good match though. Eddie Guerrero/Kurt Angle was possibly the greatest NON-mainevnt/final match ever. I was rooting for Kurt, but i had to stand up and applaud the effort of both guys. What a Match!!!!! Sure, this event lacked in some areas, but there were some of the greatest matches in the history of the business in this event...
Thank You Vince!!!!!!!",1081036800,,1703,4.737373737373737

Big Show (c) vs. John Cena
This match was surprisingly decent. It was a little slow, but did a good job of making both guys look good. There was only one really big problem with this match: a minute-long rest hold is a bit much for a 10 minute match. *3/4
World Tag Team Titles
Booker T & RVD (c) vs. Dudley Boyz vs. Cade & Jindrak vs. La Ressistance
Isn't this great? A match with no build and members of the HEAT crew on ""the grandest stage"". Match was a whole lot of nothing, but nothing un bearable or anything. *
Chris Jericho vs. Christian
Now, this is more like it. A pretty good match with both guys busting out some cool moves. Jericho isn't as good a brawler as he is with his normal style, but he worked pretty hard here and pulled off a pretty good match with Christian. ***
The Rock & Sock connection vs. Evolution
Throwing in Rock sort of killed all the good build, as he was only involved in this for 2 weeks while Foley and Orton had been feuding for months, but I guess in the end having Flair and Rock in to help Foley carry Batista and Orton was good. Match wasn't anything special, but Flair was really on here and anything Flair-Rock is absolute gold. **3/4
Interpromotional match
Sable & Torrie vs. Jackie & Stacy
Well... I can't really complain, as I didn't expect anything and they kept it short. Still.. if they were going to do something like this, they could have included celebrities like XIX, just to make it feel WM-like as apposed to something you can see on every RAW and SD. DUD
Cruiserweight Championship
Cruiserweight Open
No match up was actually given enough time to be good, but the whole thing was pretty fun as it was loaded with cool cruiser spots. **
Interpromotional match
Goldberg vs. Brock Lesnar
Special Ref: Steve Austin
This was pure crap and a really bad note for Lesnar to leave on. DUD
WWE Tag Team Titles
Rikishi & Scotty (c) vs. WGTT vs. APA vs. The Bashams
Unlike the RAW tag match, this did have one or two weeks of buld, but it is definitley not a WM-level match, as every one of these teams aside from WGTT should be on Velocity. The match was just like the RAW tag match, excpet a minute (or two) shorter. *
WWE Womens Championship
Hair vs. Title
Victoria (c) vs. Molly Holly
It was pretty good, but didn't last very long. *1/4
WWE Championship
Eddie Guerrero (c) vs. Kurt Angle
Easily the MOTN. Kurt was good, but Eddie was just excellent in this match. Great, lengthy match, with a good finish, fitting of Eddie's character. ****
Interpromotional match
Undertaker vs. Kane
This was pretty bad, but it got the point across (The dead man is back and ready to squash everyone in his path), and since I am a big Kane fan, I'll be generous. *1/4
World Heavyweight Championship
Triple H (c) vs. Chris Benoit vs. Shawn Michaels
This match was good, but terribly over-rated. It was a fun triple threat match and that is just about it. ***1/4
A very well put together video package closes the show.
Overall thoughts:
Well... there is a lot of crap on here, but Eddie-Kurt is great; the triple threat and Jericho-Christian are good, and the cruiser open is fun to watch. Plus, if you hate Goldberg or Brock, you might want to see them get booed out of the building. If you only buy a few WWE PPVs on VHS/ DVD, I wouldn't recommend this, but if you get most, then this is definitely something you should check out, if just for Eddie/ Kurt.
As a show this was good, but as a WM this was just ok. It's on a similar level as WM 2000 (which also featured a few good matches and a lot of crap), but it's crap compared to XIX or X-Seven.",1080950400,,3589,4.3343239227340264

1. John cena vs the big show wwe united states championship
  This match was a decent opener and had a cool ending. I liked the way that the big show kicked out of the first fu but the docter of thuganomics walked away representing the usa. Why has da big show not one at a mania? whats up wit dat?
2. Fatal 4 way for raw's tag team titles.
  The only reason that this was on the card was so that booker T and rvd could make an aperience.this match was boring
3. Chris jehrico vs Christian
  This match was good but took too long in my opinion. I thought christian might win but happened with trish was a shock if u ask me.
4. Rock'n sock connection vs Evalution
  This was the best match of the night in my opinion because I think that the rock is the best in the buisness today and it was very entertaining. I thought that the rock and flair had a good chemistry in the ring but I was shocked at the end result. the only reason that the wwe made the the rock'n sock connection lose was because to many goodguys were winning there matches that night.
5. Playboy evening gown match
  This match was very entertaining!(...) especially when there was all the roll ups in a row
6. Cruiserweight open
  This match would have been better if given more time because of all the talent in the ring. It was funny when dragon slipped on the entrance. LOL! but why did chavo have to win? REY deserves to win at a mania and because he is the best damm cruiserweight in the world!
7. Goldberg vs Brock lesnar with stone cold as the referee
  This match had loads of hype going into it and it cetaintly did not live up to the hype. If goldberg was on raw in the build up to mania instead of working on his stupid film maybe this match would have been better.(...)
8.fatal 4 way for smackdown tag titles
  Why was this match on the card
9. victoria vs molly womens title If molly loses she gets head shaved. This match was boring like most womens matches exept when molly got her head shaved! yuck!!!!!!!!
10. Eddie vs kurt angle for wwe championship
  This match was entertaining as I thought it would be with a clever ending. once again eddie lies cheats and steals
11. The undertaker vs kane this match was crap compared to what I expected it to be . Dead man my ass! som one has been on holiday! And where was the purple gloves and the long hair.what a load of crap!!!!!!! this was a let down by the wwe
12. Benoit vs HHHvs HBK for world heavyweight title
  Awsome match with the game tapping out in the end to the crossface. Finially benoit is da man

2022606,3,B0001OGVQ2,"It's rare that an event with so many strong matches garners nothing more than a bland response from its audience.  As such, Wrestlemania XX will go down as an oddity in the history books of pro-wrestling.  Taken in pieces, the event itself is really something memorable, with Benoit vs. HHH vs. HBK, Guerrero vs. Angle, and Jericho vs. Christian all being memorable and technically sound matches.  Even the ""entertainment"" portions of the show merit some repeat viewing, as Evolution vs. Rock and Sock, Goldberg vs. Lesnar, Undertaker vs. Kane, and Molly vs. Victoria were all fun to watch.
Yet, despite all its strengths, the show can't seem to crawl out of the pit of mediocrity fans have dug for it.  Both 4-Way tag matches were completely unnecessary and ultimately forgettable, Cena couldn't carry Big Show to anything remotely watchable, the Cruiserweights weren't given enough time to develop their contest into anything, and the Evening Gown match wasn't impressive in the least.
With the DVD, one can certainly cut the chaff and watch the 7 or so strong matches that the PPV had to offer, thus making it a dozen times better.  As a historical piece, WMXX will be forever remembered for a variety of reasons.  As a wrestling show, the sheer length of the event keeps it from reaching anything above mediocre as a whole.",1080604800,,1327,4.875555555555556
2022607,5,B0001OGVQ2,"WrestleMania XX was amazing,I would never think of forgeting
it. The matches were excellent no PPV could top it but some of the matches like Kane and the Undertaker should have had something like a Buried Alive stipulation. Overall WrestleMania XX belonged to the Crippler winning the best match of the night. Here are my ratings:
1)John Cena VS The Big Show 8/10
Great opener John Cena with two  F U's to the big man
and also using those custom made US knucks.
2)Chris Jericho VS Christian 9/10
This match was better than I thought it would be Trish Stratus
making an appearence and hitting Chris on the head with her shouder and Christian got a Roll up.
3) La Resitance VS Booker T and RVD VS Garrison Kade and Mark Jindrak VS The Dudley Boys 8/10
This was good for a Tag Team match with Sudden Death rules this match ended when Booker T hit the scissors kick and Rvd landing the Five star frog splash.
4) Rock n' Sock Connection VS Evolution 9/10
Well this match was defineatly one of the funniest espeacially
the Rock and Flair. Flair trying his own version of the peoples elbow. MIck Foley tryed to use Mr Socko on Randy Orton but Orton hit the RKO from nowhere and covered Foley for the Three count.
5) Torri Willson and Sable VS Stacy Kiebler 5/10
The only reason this match got 5/10 was because they are hot.
6) Cruiser weight Open 9/10
This was one high flying, fast paced match with Chavo Gurrero
retaining his title with some help from Chavo Senior.
7) Goldberg VS Brock Lesnar 6/10
This match was very boring Goldberg and Brock Lesnar were just standing in the middle of the ring just taunting at each other.
Goldberg defeated Brock with Two Spears and a Jackhammer.
8) Scotty 2 Hotty and Rikishi VS The APA VS The Basham Brothers VS The Self Proclaimed World Greatest Tag Team 8/10
this match was also great for a Tag Team match with all four teams hammering the hell out of each other. Rikishi ending the match with a Banzai Drop.
9)Molly Holly VS Victoria 7/10
A Decent match with Victoria retaining the Womens Championship with a Roll up. Then Molly got her head shaved she tried her best to escape but couldn't because Victoria knocked her out and tied her to the chair.
10) Kurt Angle VS Eddie Gurrero 10/10
This match was amazing it proved that Eddie could be a great champion and he promised that after Wrestlemania he is going
to Lie, Cheat and Steal like never before.
11) Undertaker VS Kane 10/10
Undertaker making his return as promised but a suprise return was also made by Paul Bearer. Kane couldn't beleive what he saw infront of him. Kane learning never to mess with his brother again and he learned it with a Tombstone Piledriver.
12) Chris Beniot VS Shawn Micheals VS Triple H 10/10
The best of match the night Triple H and Shawn Micheals Double teaming on Beniot but at the end of the night Chris Beniot reigned supreme with his head up high and his title on his shoulder and he did it with a crippler crossface.

2022608,2,B0001OGVQ2,"I can't believe that J.r. and all of the other announcers and wrestlers of both RAW and Smackdown were calling this the greatest Wrestlemania of all time. Wrestlemania X8 was better than this one. Although the buildup and the hype was there and there was a reason for almost every match (excluding the 2 Fatal 4 Way Tag Matches) the matches didn't pull through. All of the matches that should've been some of the greatest matches of all time (Goldberg vs. Brock Lesnar, Undertaker vs. Kane) lasted for about 5 minutes. It made me feel like I was watching Smackdown or RAW and paying $50 to see it live. Anyways here is a list of all the matches and my rating for them:
John Cena vs. Big Show (U.S. Title): 2/5 a very mediocre match. The only good thing is that Cena won
RVD and Booker T vs. The Dudley's vs. Cade and Jindrak vs. La Resistance: 1/5 Boring!!! Can someone please tell me why Cade and Jindrak are on the card at WRESTLEMANIA!!!
Jericho vs. Christian: 4/5 a pretty good match with lots of buildup and emotion going into it the ending is extremely surprising too, Jericho is my favorite wrestler so of course I'm going to love this match.
Cruiserweight Open: 3/5 it would've been better if it was longer than 5 minutes
Rock and Foley vs. Evolution: 2/5 probably The Rock and Foley's worst Wrestlemania match. This is another match that could have been 10 times better if they would have actually taken the time to slow it down and make it last more than 5 minutes
Lesnar vs. Goldberg: 1/5 the most disapointing match I've ever seen. This match could have been a classic, one that we could tell our grandchildren about. (okay maybe not, lol) but still this should have been and epic encounter. All they did was stare at each other for about 15 minutes and then Goldberg Jackhammered Brock, Brock f-5'd Goldberg, Goldberg Speared Brock, Austin counts 1-2-3. Austin didn't even get involved. Probably the most half-assed match I've ever seen. It was both of these wrestlers last match and unfortunatly this is what everyone is going to remember them for. You'd think that since it was their last match they would have at least made some effort in it.
Playboy Evening Gown Match: 1/5 match [stinked] but the (...), that was the only good part
Victoria vs. Molly Holly: 1/5 no comment
Too Cool vs. APA vs. The Bashams vs. The World's Greatest Tag Team: 1/5 slightly better than the Raw match not much though
Eddie Guerrero vs. Kurt Angle: 2/5 CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHY EDDIE GUERRERO IS THE WWE CHAMPION!!!
Undertaker vs. Kane: 3/5 only cool part was Taker's entrance, other than that it was just another average match. Another 5 minuter.
HHH vs. Chris Beniot vs. HBK: 4/5 The best match of the night but an extremely mediocre main event for Wrestlemania. Triple Threat Matches never seem to work the way they should. The mathc would have been better if it was just Micheals and HHH. It also would have been better if Beniot wouldn't have (...).",1080432000,,2956,4.589792060491494

2022611,2,B0001OGVQ2,"Wrestlemania used to be packed with stars like Vanna White, Mike Tyson and Liberace. There used to be grand entrances for the wrestlers as if they were kings. The best wrestlers on earth used to be there and every match was terrific, worthy of being a main event on any card anywhere. I bought the PPV because I have never missed a Wrestlemania, but boy was I disappointed. The only ""star"" from outside of wrestling was Donald Trump, who was interviewed for  about a minute or so. He didn't say anything interesting. He was just sitting there in the audience. There was no rock band this time. The wrestlers did not come out in full force with their royal following, like I used to love. I found myself not caring about the wrestlers that were there, despite watching the weekly TV shows. I wanted to see Hulk Hogan and Brett Hart. I wanted big names in huge matches with serious consequences. I wanted retirement matches, steel cage matches, table matches, hardcore matches. One girl got her head shaved when she lost, but none of the men seemed to have anything on the line in this PPV and it showed. We did not see their best efforts. Most of the wrestlers used the same exact moves and holds as all the others. I found myself not caring how most matches ended. What a departure this was from previous years, when I had the family gathered around me and we cheered and booed and thought our lives depended on the outcomes of the matches. We used to feel a part of Wrestlemania. When I saw a match, I felt like I was wrestling for the championship. This time I just felt like I was wasting $49.95 plus tax on a PPV that never delivered on anything. So the Undertaker returned....so what? He didn't really DO anything when he returned. I am from El Paso and am an eddie Guerrerro fan, but even his match never came close to delivering on the hype. Personally, I think that ever since the wrestlers were divided to go to either Smackdown or RAW, things went downhill very fast. I miss the idea that any wrestler can take on any wrestler any time. That unpredictability was fun. Treating it as two different ""brands"" of entertainment really sucks. Right after Wrestlemania XX ended, I told my girlfriend that I just may have to retire from watching the WWE. It just isn't very good anymore. The people at the top don't seem to care. They make so much money every time they hype a Pay Per View that, I guess, they have no incentive to put on a decent show. Give me an iron-man match, followed by a retirement match, followed by a cage match, hardcore match, superstar celebrities, a surprise musical appearance by KISS, remember to show real people having fun and make gigantic matches that people will care about, then wow us with surprise matches featuring great wrestlers of the past that we long to see again. None of this happened at Wrestlemania XX. It was lame, brain-dead, and, despite the fact that I paid $49.95 for the PPV, I started wondering what else might be on TV.",1080259200,2,2978,4.5046210720887245
2022622,5,B0001OGVQ2,"Wrestlemania XX Where it all Begins Again the most hyped and look forward to wrestlemania of all time does it live up to the hype build up being the 20th WM and in MSG? It does live up to being one of the best WM but falls short to living up to it's build mostly cause of Brock Lesner vs Goldburg which was a dream match everyone look forward to since Goldburg came back and it turn out to be an upset but not the wrost match for Goldburg, I look back at Starrcade 1998 in WCW the Nash vs Goldburg was hyped just like this at lest this had a fare ending to it unlike that match so i don't think this is a bad match for a Goldburg match but i would say this is a weak match for Brock since hes has classic 5 star matchs with Kurt Angle and Eddie, and soild ones with Undertaker and many other wwe superstars, The ending was pretty cool with Stone Cold that really helped get the people into it=o) Other then that match Wrestlemania XX is an awesome event that will go down an history i think, alot of great matchs the best being the Main event which i think is the second best WM main event of all time 1st being Bret Hart vs HBK at WM12 Awesome match with Chris Benoit make Triple H tape out for the first time i can remaber just awesome ending with all 3 guys giving it there all, Also Kurt Angle vs Eddie Guerrero for the WWE Chapionship was great as well not a classic but very close to one great win for Eddie at the biggist Stage of them all, Finally Eddie and Benoit get there push and it happs at the biggest Wrestlemania, Also Undertaker returns against Kane in a solid match although it was awesome to see paul bear and unertaker coming out to his old music it was disspoiting to see undertakers ring attire being a take top other then that it was a wrestlemania moment i think, Also Rock&Sock vs Evloution in a very fun match that felt like a big WM match up and it deliverd but Sad ending if The rock and Mick foley one it would of been a WM moment it still is for Randy Orton but the fans wanted Rock&Sock to win and so did I:o) But still it was a great match and so was Y2J vs christian, And also John Cena vs Big Show for the US title in the 2nd best WM opener only to Bret vs Owen at WMX, Overall WMXX in my view is the best if not one of the best WMs yet.
  Heres my rating from 1-10
  John Cena vs Big Show (8)
  Raw tag team championships (6)
  Y2J vs Christian (8)
  Rock&Sock vs Evlotion (8)
  Sable&torrie vs Stacy&Jakie (for men that wanna see girls in there underware then(10)but for a wrestling match (5)
  Goldburg vs Brock Lesner (6) (this is Brocks last match at lest for awhile that is im sure a good resone why it was not as good)
  Cruiserwight open (7/) (alot of highlights in this match but was over too fast)
  Smackdowns tag team match (6)
  Molly vs Victory (4) (Seeing molly get her head shave is a WM moment i suppose.)
  Eddie Vs Angle (9) (Awesome match!! not a classic but close)
  Undetaker Vs Kane (7/) WM moment seeing Taker back with paul bear just ring attire was a let down match was still solid good win for Taker now 12-0 at WM thats awesome!!!)
  Triple Threat World Championship match Shawn Michaels vs Chris Benoit vs Triple H (10) One of the best matchs I have ever seen theres only like 5 matchs that i think are wroth of a 10 and that is Bret vs HBK at WM12 1996 and HBK vs Razor Romon in a ladder match at Summerslam 1995 and Chris Benoit vs Kurt Angle at Royal Rumble 2003 and Bret vs Owen at WMX 1994 and this triple threat Match at WMXX 2004 so thats saying alot about this match maybe not everyone will agree with me but thoughs are my favorit matchs and this match ranks 2nd place for me with HBK and Bret hart being number 1 this is a match that will be talked about for years a classic finally Benoit is the Champion after coming so close at Royal Rumble 2003 Benoit has one the Big one at the biggest event and biggest stage WMXX Awesome Match with a wrestlemania moment with Eddie and Benoit huging and celebrating in the Ring as it all begins for them finally!!!)
  Overall i give WMXX a 9 out of 10",1080172800,,4064,4.071608040201005
2022623,3,B0001OGVQ2,"WrestleMania XX was an average pay-per-view at best. With only a handful of above-average matches. Here's my rundown of the top bouts that occured at the event. Keep in mind: I rate at a bust of five stars (*****).
1. World Heavyweight Championship:
Triple H [c] vs. Chris Benoit vs. Shawn Michaels
*****
-Incredible match. Jaw-dropping spots and excellent mat wrestling give this match a nod for M.O.T.Y. (Match of the Year). This match combined all the elements that make pro wrestling great: an electric crowd, 3 technically savvy workers putting on a tremendous show, and the crowning of a new (and deserving) World Heavyweight Champion.
2. WWE Championship:
Eddie Guerrero [c] vs. Kurt Angle
****1/2
-Another great bout. The mat work was superior to the triple-threat, but the World Heavyweight Championship made up for that flaw with lots and lots of blood that fueled the intense flow of the match. The reason this one doesn't get a perfect rating was the somewhat 'weak' looking finish. It wasn't that bad. ...
3. Two on Three Handicap Match:
The Rock and Sock Connection vs. Evolution
****
-Highly entertaining match. The Rock and Ric Flair put on a great show with little spots here and there. Foley and Orton looked suprisingly good (considering that Foley hasn't wrestled in four years). Batista seemed out of place. However, all five participants succeeded in providing a nice match to set up a Foley/Orton match down the line. The ending was beautiful and very spotaneous.
4. Chris Jericho vs. Christian
***1/2
-Nice match, the spots were well planned and the technical wrestling was off-the-page enthralling. The butterfly suplex spot was especially cool to see. The plot twist (in the Jericho/Trish storyline) at the end further cemented Jericho into a babyface role.
Well, that's the end....of the good matches. The rest were either mediocre or below-average. I recorded this on VHS and don't plan on buying the DVD set, regardless of how much extra crap WWE loads onto the disc set.
So only buy this DVD if you know what you're paying for: which is four great matches, eight stinkers, and a slew of ill-conceived vignettes.",1080172800,,2141,4.9665738161559885
2022624,5,B0001OGVQ2,"WrestleMania XX, live from Madison Square Garden in New York City, was by far one of the greatest WWE events of all time. For five full hours, wrestling fans all over the world were able to witness history unfold before their eyes on a night that marked the end of one era, and the beginning of a new one. Everything from the matches to the special appearences were awesome, and as a fan who was at MSG that night, I can honestly say that not a single person left the Garden dissapointed. I have watched every single WrestleMania live since 1985, and I can honestly say that this years twentieth anniversary spectacular not only lived up to all the hype, it far surpassed it.
Here are some of the biggest highlights of the event:
- John Cena defeats the Big Show for U.S. Championship, Cena's first title win in the WWE.
- Christian pulls the upset by pinning Chris Jericho. Afterwards, Trish Stratus betrays Y2J and joins forces with Christian.
- The Rock 'n Sock Connection lose to Evolution. The victory further puts over Evolution, while ensuring that the Randy Orton/Mick Foley rivalry is far from over.
- The 2004 WWE Hall of Fame inductees were presented to the sold-out crowd.
- In the first-ever Playboy Evening Gown match, Torrie Wilson and Sable beat Stacy Kiebler & Miss Jackie. Although as any guy who saw this match can tell you, there really were no losers!
- Goldberg defeated Brock Lesnar. It was both of their last nights with the company, and every single fan at MSG knew it. After the match, special referee Stone Cold Steve Austin stunned both of them right out of the WWE.
- Jesse 'the Body' Ventura announced that he may run for President in 2008, and special guest Donald Trump pledged his full support to him if he actually does.
- Victoria retained the Woman's Championship against Molly Holly. As part of a pre-match stipulation, Molly had to shave her head completely bald.
- Eddie Guerrero defeated Kurt Angle to retain the WWE Championship. One of the best matches of the night.
- In my personal favorite moment of the night, The Undertaker returned to the WWE as the classic 'Dead Man' character. He had one of the best entrances I have ever seen, complete with his original music, smoke/fog, thunder, bells, the torch-carrying Druids, and even his original manager Paul Bearer. Best of all, Taker went on to extend his WrestleMania win streak to 12-0 by defeating his own brother Kane. A great overall moment.
- Chris Benoit achieved his life-long dream by winning the World Heavyweight Championship in a Triple Threat match against Triple H and Shawn Michaels. Easily the best match of the night. Afterwards, WWE Champion Eddie Guerrero came to the ring to congratulate his pal Chris on his huge victory. The show ended with both of them raising eachothers arms in the middle of the ring.
I highly recommend that wrestling fans of all types purchase this DVD as soon as it comes out.",1080086400,,2916,4.675097276264592

2022626,4,B0001OGVQ2,"Wrestlemania XX was titled ""WHERE IT ALL BEGINS...AGAIN"". The WWE did it all over again. Sure some of the matches were great but most were let downs. Sure there was some funny and exciting moments, but the negatiives are way more noticable than the positives.
The Big Show vs John Cena(U.S. Title)- Good opening match, and it was cool to see Cena pick up a major title victory.  3.5/5
RVD & Booker T vs. La Resistance vs. Garrison Cade & Mark Gindrak vs. The Dudley Boyz(World Tag Team Titles)-Could of been a lot better but it was a decent match with some high spots. 3/5
Christian vs. Chris Jericho- Great match. One of the best of the night. Great ending that you must see! 4/5
Evolution vs. Rock n' Sock- Good Tag Team match. Better than what I was expecting. One of the highs of this event with great wrestling, filled with funny moments and a great ending. 4/5
Torrie Wilson & Sable vs. Miss Jackie & Stacy(Playboy Evening Gound Match)-Not a good match at all. It just wasted time and built suspense and wait for the coming matches. 1/5
Cruiserweight Battle Royal- An ok match. There was not that many high spots and a very prdictable match. 2/5
Goldberg vs. Brock Lesnar w/Stone Cold as ref- worst match that I have seen in a long time. This match was only saved by Stone Cold at the ending but not even Stone Cold could make this match a good one. 0.5/5
Scotty 2 Hotty & Rikishi vs the Basham Brothers, APA, and the Self-Proclaimed World's Greatest Tag Team (WWE Tag Team Championship)- Another 4-way tag match. Not much to say about it when you already saw the exact same match earlier in the night. 2.5/5
Victoria vs. Molly Holly(Womens Championship)- Short match and not that much entertaining. Even after the match when Molly had to shave her head it still was not that entertaining. 1.5/5
Kurt Angle vs. Eddie Guerrero(WWE Title)-The WWE finally had a Wrestlemania type match. This was a great match filled with many high spots and exciting action. The ending is very unpredictable. 4.5/5
The Undertaker vs. Kane-In my opinion the most anticipated moment of the night. The Undertaker's return. It was awesome with the druids and Paul Bearer. Then when he came out it was a let down. He is still the American Badass with the same attire just different music. The match was short and should of been longer but it was still one of my favorite moments of the night. 4/5
Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels vs. Chris Benoit(World Title)-Best match of the night. Blood,sweat, and tears were involved in this match. This was well woth the wait. One of the best Triple-Threat matches of all time. 5/5
Overall the WWE had a chance to hit a Grand Slam, but they didn't. They had numerous oppurtunities to make this event the best of all time, but they did not.
Good-Undertaker and Paul Bearer's Return
Trish's heel turn
Benoit wins the title
Lesnar and Goldberg Get Stunned for there lackluster performance
The New York Crowd was awesome and spoke there minds (i.e. The Lesnar vs. Goldberg Match)
Bad-Lesnar vs. Goldberg
Lackluster tag team title matches
Cruiserweight Battle Royal
Playboy Evening Gound Match
Kane vs. The Undertaker was too short
Final Rating 3/5

U.S. Title: John Cena vs Big Slow (I mean show)...pretty good match, I personally think John Cena is GOD...so I'm automatically gonna rate this match high...WORD LIFE  (5/5 stars)
RAW Fatal Four Way: Meh...nothing too great....hey, at least it was better then the Smackdown one!  which doesn't say much....(3/5 stars)
Jericho vs. Christian: Pretty good match. Even though I predicted the ending, it was still cool. How can the WWE have a REALLY hot girl turn heel? Please, someone answer that for me. (4/5 stars)
Rock n Sock vs. Evolution: Man, how can people give this bad ratings? You had 3 of the greatest champions in WWE history (Rock, Flair, Foley) ... and then you had Orton and Batista...well...3/5 ain't bad...Plus!

Smackdown Fatal Four Way: oye....just not WMXX worthy (2/5)
Molly vs. Victoria for the Women's Title: Should have had Lita in it, cuz she rocks...but it was funny to see Molly's head shaved. HA HA! (3/5 stars)
WWE Title: AWESOME match, w/ a funny ending...Eddie's gotta lie, cheat, and steal baby! (5/5 stars)
Taker vs. Kane: With all the (...) hype the WWE was putting into this, you would THINK that Taker wouldn't come out lookin like a woman cowboy...where's the makeup and the OLD SCHOOL costume...seriously...it was a sweet entrance though...and a pretty good match, with the classic tombstone at the end.

2022629,4,B0001OGVQ2,"Matches include:
Cena v Big Show. Passable however the 2 FUs were impressive and the crowd way hot for Cena. Great rap at the beginning of the match to get the crowd to jump start.
RVD and Booker v Dudleys v Jindrak and Cade v La Resistance. Terrible match and should have not been on the card. RVD and Booker look put together, Dudleys are stale as hell while the two other are not over in the slightest.
Jericho v Christian. A decent match with a shocking ending!. Trish as a heel will be interesting. This feus will contiue after Mania and will transform Jericho as a super-over face again.
Cruserweight Open, If given over 15 mins. would have been awesome considering the talent involved, they did the best they could in the limited time. Funny moment, Ultimo Dragon slipping in his entrance.
Rock and Foley v Evolution. Decent match, great exchanges between Rock and Flair. Rock is simply the most charismatic man in the histiry of wrestling and show why in the match. Flair can still go on occasion, and this was one of the occasion.
Goldberg v Lesnar. Dissapointing match, wrestlers did not care about the match and man the New York crowd let them know about it. However the negative crowd reactions made the match amusing. Good Bye Brock and Goldberg, judging by the reactions, wrestling fans won`t miss you!. These two ego maniacs legitimately passionate wrestlers like Benoit and Guerrero who appreciate being able to perform.
Torrie and Sable v Stacy and Jackie, terrible match, should only be featured assegemnt on the pre-show. Wrestling show should have wrestling matches, how do you think Lance Storm and Matt Hardy felt seeing this match. The two easily one of the most gifter wrestlers on the Rw brand and can`t find a space on the card.
Guerrero v Angle, technically good match. Mixed reaction for Angle made more entertaining. Two of the best technical wrestlers in the world will produce a great match, no doubt. Innovative ending to the match made it more special.
Victoria v Molly, only the ending is mildly ending. A nothing match.
Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty v APA v Bashams v WGTT, one excellent tag team + two god awful teams = disaster!. WGTT deserve better then this.
Undertaker v Kane, all the hype for the Undertaker to return in his old clothes with a hat. Extremely dissapointed with his return, not been Paul Bearer could make it entertaining. I was expecting the old outfit not the same outfit + a hat and overcoat. Once the bell rang, showed everyone why he should retire immediately.
Triple H v Michaels v Benoit, a phenomenal match, awesome crowd reaction for Benoit, one of the greatest Wrestlemania matches of all time. Triple H was looking leaner and therefore was in better cardiovascular condition in the match. All three put there heart and soul in the match and will be remembered as a Wrestlemania moment in years to come.
Overall: The matches expected to rock did and the matches expected to suck did too. However, the matches that did rule makes up for the matches that did suck. Crowd reaction in MSG was  dissapointing apart from the negative reaction for the Brock-Goldberg match and postive reaction for Triple Threat Match. Still a great Wrestlemania because of Jericho/Christian, Rock-Foley/Evolution, Guerrero/Angle, Triple H/HBK/Benoit and the disqust of the crowd for the Goldberg/Brock match.",1079740800,13,3348,4.842931937172775

2022631,2,B0001OGVQ2,"First Thing I think people on here have overated WMXX it could have been a whole lot better.
Hulk Hogan should have been there you just cannot have a Wrestlemania without Hogan hes made the last 2 with his matches with McMahon and The Rock the whole night you could just feel that the event needed a dose of HulkaMania!!
Brock Lesnar and Goldberg should not have been put in a match together each man should have been in the main event from there brand fighting for the title up to WMXX they were the biggest guys on each brandand each deserved title matches.
People say the World Title Match was the best of the night well it took three guys to pull it off! And I don't agree that it should be contested between 3 men WM title matches should be 1on1. But fair play to Benoit he deserved it, but the match should have been Benoit v HHH.
Has The Undertaker changed? I didn't think so other than hes grown his hair abit longer, where were the purple gloves and socks and the pale white face? buried alive??? looks like hes been on holiday to me!
However the best match of the night and the only match that deserves credit was the rock n sock vs evolution this had a great WM feel to it largely delivered by legends Rock and Ric Flair they added that bit of magic to the air. COME BACK FULL TIME ROCK!!!
The other stuff isn't worth covering, Eddie is far too small to be in the WWE title main event and I think he should have dropped the belt to Kurt Angle and the others matches were not worthy of WM.
Overall could have been a much much better event, it really missed Hogan and Bret Hart who are the biggest WM names of all time! Oh well theres always next year. Im sure people will ignore my review but I felt really let down by WMXX.
Please go buy WM18 and WM19 they are much much better.",1079568000,7,1789,4.173410404624278

HANDYCAP Match: Evolution vs. Rock n' Sock connection - great match, Most probably think it was better than Jericho and Chritian but if you look at the length and the ending, most are wrong. Just barely worst than Jericho vs. Christian. 6/10
PLAYBOY EVENING GOWN Match: Tori&Sable vs. Jackie&Stacey - Let's face it, we are all winner's in this one, but if not, then it was a sucky wrestling match, good gimick fill thingy. 3/10
CRUISERWIEGHT OPEN Match: Chavo vs. Tajiri vs. Akio vs. Funaki vs. Mysterio vs. Sphycosis vs. Noble vs. Nunzio vs. Kidman vs. I forgot - Awsome, I hate smackdown but this was cool, third best on the card, Just Awsome!!! 7/10
SHOW COMBO. Match: Goldberg vs. Lesner - Boring!!! Half the match is a stupid lock up to see who's stronger! 4/10
TAG TITLES Match: S2H&Rakishi vs. Bashams vs. APA vs. WGTT - It was better than the Raw one but almost the same, again, I hate the format of the match, Sudden Death is never as good! 5/10
WOMENS TITLE Match: Molly vs. Victoria - What can I say, great match for women, crap for an ending though!(I mean the pin) 5/10
WWE TITLE Match: Angle vs. Gerrero - I thought it would suck. It looked like these two had no chemestry together! But they pulled off the second best match of the night. GOOD MATCH!!! 7.5/10
BRO vs. BRO: Undertaker vs. Kane - I was watching the event for this match only, let me tell you it was . . . SUCKY!!! the absolute biggest disapointment I have ever seen at wrestlemania! I wait for this match and it is a three minut piece of CRAP!!! If you buy this tape, fast foreward through this match, because it isn't even worth you're time, It doesn't even compare to WM14!!! Worste match of the night!!!  1/10 (only for undertakers return!)
WORLD TITLE Match: HBK vs. HHH vs. Chris Benoit - NO DQ, I loved it, Best match of the night and probably the closest thing to a ten (besides 1 other match) that I will ever give. It was sweeeeeet! I( could put it in 3 words from good ol' J.R. , ""A CAR WRECK""!!! Great!!! I needed this after Taker and Kane!(really, I almost shut off the TV after that match!!) Amazing out of all three men, you can watch it over and over again. 9/10!!!
Over all it was truly, THE SHOWCASE OF THE IMMORTALS!!! I hope you buy it because it will be a classic someday, buy it for the Triple threat, or don't for Taker Kane, it's you're choice, they should have cool extras like past WM's and stuff!!!

2022654,5,B0001OGVQ2,"Bret Hart didn't want to attend wrestlemania but he will at Backlash because thats taking place in Canada. It was a good ppv, but could have been way way better. The Broc Lesnar and Golberg match was just very very terrible. The worst match I have ever seen. It was very interesting though because they were booing at brock because he is leaving the wrestling buisness to go to the NFL. Fans were chanting ""Broc sold out!!!"". They should have just ended the match in like 10 minutes.
The match that was very great was the main event. That was the most intense match I have ever seen. That was the best match of the night. It was very just bloody and technical. I also liked the match between Eddie Gurrero and Kurt Angle. That match was very good too. The Big Show and John Cena match was suprisingly good. It was pretty good. The cruserweight thing I expected more. Ultimo Dragon should have won that match. It should have been a battle royal. That sucks that Molly got her head shave. And how can I forget the Undertakers return. His costume entrance was ok but he still has the tanktop. I was expecting the old costume. But at least pal bear came back.
Her are the matches and the winners
1. Big Show vs. John Cena= John Cena
2. Booker T and Rob Van Dam vs. Dudley Boyz vs. La Resistance vs. Mark Jindrak and Garrison Cade= Booker T and Rob Van Dam

It was a superb match with a great ending and a great aftermath. Trish turned on Jericho! The following match was a heck of a lot better than I expected it to be. Evolution took on the Rock'N'Sock Connection in a great match. It had a great ending that came out of nowhere. Brock Lesnar vs. Goldeberg was bad, but the crowd was unbelievable. They caught onto the rumors and their chants showed it. I hope the WWE doesn' edit them out of the tape. It was like Rock vs. Hogan, but completely opposite! The next great match was Kurt Angle vs. Eddie Guerrero. It was very great with another great ending! The last match of the night was also the best. HHH vs. HBK vs. Benoit.

Overall, the PPV was, in the words of Tazz, ""a rocketbuster!"" The Triple Threat Match for the World Title was truly, ""a slobberknocker,"" whereas Y2J vs. Christian was a surprisingly good match with a shocking ending. Also, the two Fatal 4-Way Tag Championship matches were surprisingly good along with the U.S. Championship Match! But the one match which truly let alot of people down was Goldberg vs. Lesnar. Stone Cold saved the match with his post-match Stunners to Brock and Goldberg! Most importantly, Torrie, Sable, Stacy, and Jackie looked fine as hell in their Evening Gowns and their match was pretty cool! Overall, excellent PPV!",1079308800,,1992,5.249211356466877
2022659,3,B0001OGVQ2,"I was really hyped up for this wrestle mania. I was looking forward to the Goldberg vs. Lesnar match. I thought the whole night will be worth watching.
The first match was pretty good considering it at The Big Show. (a.k.a. The Big Slow) John Cena did a good job to quicken the pace and win the match. This match was entertaining and I thought the matches will get better as the night rolled along.
The rest of the matches where boring. The only reason the next match was worth watching was the performance of RVD. The Fatal Four way was just an Okay match.
The Christan vs. Jericho was good enough to watch at a regular Raw show but the ending made it all worth it.
Evolution vs. the Rock n' Sock connection was a pretty entertaining match. Randy Orton proved why he is the legend killer. Look out for Orton he could be head liner for the next Wrestlemania.
Sable/Torrie vs. Stacy/Jackie (who is not attractive) Stacy is my favorite diva and to see all the divas fight in their under wear made the match special. I just hoped the match was longer.
The Cruiserweight open was pretty good. Billy Kidman and Rey put on a great show. The Ultimamo Dragon got elimated pretty fast, which is too bad because I would have liked to see him face off against Rey or Kidman. But Chavo won again. GO CHAVO!!!
Goldberg vs. Lesnar was probably the biggest disapointment in WWE history. I wanted this match to happen ever since Goldberg came back, but both of these WWE Stars gave the worst performance of thier careers. Stone Cold stunned both of them simpily because the crowd was disapointed and the match took the life out of the fans watching. I'm a big Goldberg fan and to hear the New York crowd chant ""Goldberg sucks"" I understood because they deserved a good match. I hope this match does not tarnish the career of Goldberg in the WWE.
The Fatal Four for the Smackdown Tag Team title was really weak. The only good part was the end of the match when Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty put on a dance show for the fans.
Victoria vs. Molly I was looking foward to see a good performance by Victoria but I was disapointed again. Molly got her head shaved and she looks pretty good.
Eddie vs. Kurt Angle Now I thought this match didn't even deserve to be a title match but I was wrong. This was a good match and Eddie lied, cheated, stoled his way to victory. A very surprising good match.
Kane vs. the Undertaker Now what was up with this new Undertaker...I was aspecting something like the old Undertaker. He looked nasty. The undertaker did put a good performance but wasn't one of Kane's and Undertaker's best matches.
HHH vs. HBK vs. Chris Benoit Now I thought this match whould have been the weakest match of the night but I was wrong. This match goes down as one of the best matches I have seen in a while. HBk gave a great performance, HHH proved why he is the Game, and Chris Benoit proved why he deserves to be champ.
Overall if you where to buy this DVD get it because of the triple treat match, Eddie vs. Kurt Angle, John Cena winning the US title, the playboy match, and the return of the Undertaker.",1079308800,,3095,4.375
2022660,5,B0001OGVQ2,"With all the hype for Wrestlemania XX at MSG, I knew it was very difficult from the begining to to live up to the hype.  I can't say it was the best Wrestlemania ever, but far from the worst, and improving from Wrstlemania XIX the previous year.
John Cena Vs. Big Show - Ends up being an entertaining match, it could have been longer though.  The ending went well, as Cena became the new U.S. champ to jump-start the crowd on the right foot. I personally would have liked Big how winning, cause I thought he gave the better effort.  Solid match overall.
Chris Jericho Vs. Christian - Not as good as the two men are capable of being, but had some nice moves to it.  The ending was kind of funny.  Not a great but fun match.
Booker T & RVD Vs. The Dudley Boys Vs. La Resistance Vs. Mark Jindrak & Garrison Cade - Not a whole lot of exitement in this match, there was nice moves here and there, with Booker & RVD doing most of the work and end up retaining their World Tag Titles
Randy Orton, Ric Flair and Batista AKA Evolution Vs. The Rock and Mick Foley AKA Rock N' Sock Connection-  Well entertaing for the most part, Flair is a legend but really should retire, Foley and Rock are not what they once were.  Had some great moves, and the ending could have been better.  But still a nice watch.
Evening Gown Match- Sable & Torrie Wilson Vs. Jackie Gayda & Stacy Keibler - Strictly for the men who seemed to have loved it, forget the fighting, it was not special in this mactch.
10-Man Cruiserweight Championship - Overall not fun, brutal to watch some pinfalls.  With Chavo Guerrero retaing his title.
Goldberg Vs. Brock Lesnar and Stone Cold Steve Austin as special guest referee-  Why did I know this match would be the most critisized out of all of them.  The Hype was definetily there.  I am hearing people say it was the worst match they have ever seen, Yeah Right!  Seeing Brock getting Spheread
and Jackhammered and Goldberg getting F-5'd was fun to see.  The problem though is that it had a 5 minute stare-down before the fighting even began.  Kind of slow, and both men were testing each others power rather than doing more wrestling moves on each other.  It should have invlved more physical wrestling for it's macth length.  It was said to be the last match for both Goldberg and Lesnar going in to the match, as the Crowd was yelling at Lesnar, saying he was a sellout, and people were even chanting Goldberg sucks, The Crowd was even rooting for Austin more than thos e two. It was like they wanted Austin to wrestle in the match in a three-way, not that there would have been anything wrong with that, but Austin gave the Fans what they wanted by stunning both men, Austin is just the man.
Scotty 2 Hotty & Rikishi Vs. APA Vs. basham brothers Vs. The Self-proclaimed World's greatest Tag Team - I thought it was a goos effort by all men, Not that Great but Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty retained their Tag Titles.
Victoria Vs. Molly Holly-  Not exactly excellent, but had some very good moves with Victoria coming out on top.  Molly Holly ends up getting her haed shaved bald by Victoria, due to the match stipulation. Funny moment.
Kurt Angle Vs. Eddie Guerrero-  Not a classic but still very entertaining,  Had some nice high-flying action, Very good ending. Both men worked hard, but the better person won, as Eddie Gurrero retained his Undisputed Championship.
Undertaker Vs. Kane- Nostalgia all the way.  Like these two havn't face off before.  The main story-line here was Undertaking returning back as his dead-man form bringing paul berrer with him.  Match could have been longer, but everything you could have expected between the two big man, As the Undertaker came out victorious improving his Wrestlemania record t0 12-0.
Shawn Michaels Vs. Triple H Vs. Chris Benoit- Great macth for being the last one.  Entertaining the entire time, with blood all over the place.  All men just gave a great effort, as Chris Benoit acheived hid lofe-long goal by becoming the World Heavy-Weight Champion, which was well deserved by the crippler.
Overall, probrably not the best Wrestlemania, but had just enough to live up to the hype, when the DVD hits stores, I will ceratainly buy it, unlike I did for last year's Wrestlemania XIX.  Wrestlemania XX for the most part was pure fun.",1079308800,,4290,4.552083333333333
2022671,3,B0001OGVQ2,Not what i thought it was going to be. Brock and Goldberg was a joke and prolly the worst match of the night. I liked the John Cena fight better than that. not worth the money at all maybe a couple good matches but not worth the price. They made this seem like it was going to be the best ever but one of the worest ever but there is always next year at the staple center. oh and by the way brock and goldberg got BORING CHANT which is not a good sign!,1079308800,,452,3.8191489361702127
2022672,3,B0001OGVQ2,"So here is my review of wrestlemania 20....
To be honest i was dissapointed. Don't get me wrong the matches were pretty good but since it was wrestlemania i tought it would be amazing. here are my opinions of the matches...
John Cena VS the Big Show (United States Championship) - 7.5/10
this match was nothing special. had good spots like when cena lifted the big show over his head.
Booker T & RVD VS the Dudley Boyz VS La Resistance VS Mark Jindrak & Garrison Cade (World Tag Team Championship) - 7.5/10
again nothing special, best spot was rvd's five star frog splash.
Christian VS Chris Jericho - 7/10
match was a bit dissapointing, kind of a match you would see on television not wrestlemania. has an ending you won't believe!
Evolution VS Rock 'n' Sock Connection - 9.5/10
Definately the match i was waiting for! this felt like a wrestlemania match and mick foley put on a great performance. nothing very hardcore but the match had some great spots.
Torrie Wilson & Sable VS Stacy Keibler & Miss Jackie - 3/10
This was a waste of time to be honest, deserves 3 just because it was a playboy evening gown match.
The Cruiserweight Open (Cruiserweight Championship) - 9/10
This match was kinda short but was very good. some amazing action from the cruiserweights and billy kidman had some great spots.
Goldberg VS Brock Lesnar - 2/10
The worst match of the night and the worst match i've seen in a long time. this match deserved the BORING chants it got from the crowd and i gave it 2 because of austin's stunner on lesnar.
Scotty 2 Hotty & Rikishi VS the Basham Brothers VS APA VS the Self-Proclaimed World's Greatest Tag Team (WWE Tag Team Championship) - 6.5/10
I didn't like the idea of two 4 way tag team matches in one night and this one was dissapointing. the 1st one was way better and this had no good spots. an average smackdown match.
Victoria VS Molly Holly (Women's Championship) - 4/10
Basically your average womens match, pretty boring.
Eddie Guerrero VS Kurt Angle (WWE Championship) - 8/10
This was pretty good match.nothing amazing but still good.
Undertaker VS Kane - 7/10
To be honest i expected more out of the match, the match was pretty dissapointing but undertaker's return was amazing. the atmosphere in the crowd was great and i gave this 7 because of his return.
Chris Benoit VS Triple H VS Shawn Michaels (World Heavyweight Championship) - 10/10
like the rock and sock match, this match lived up to its hype. definately felt like a wrestlemania main event and had alot of good spots like the announce table and shawn michael's many sweet chin music's. great match.
Overall i would not recommend you to purchase the dvd. it was an ok ppv and a dissapointing wrestlemania. Also i felt that the ppv wasn't hardcore enough or there was no gimmick matches like ladder, table, cage etc.. pratically every match was just a plain singles match and there was no weapons used in the whole ppv. Best Spot = Billy Kidman's shooting star. Best match = Chris Benoit VS Triple H VS Shawn Michaels, Best Performance = Mick Foley",1079308800,,3043,4.605893186003684
2022673,5,B0001OGVQ2,"This PPV was so cool some of the matches going the way I wanted
some not but still all matches were promoted very very well.
There were some Hall of Fame inductes in the arena. The match results were: Goldberg beats Lesnar (Lesnar leaves WWE and switching over to the NFL)Chris Beniot beats HHH and HBK
John Cena beats Big Show, Undertaker beats Kane, Eddie beats Kurt, Torri and Sable beats Stacy and Miss Jackie, Evolution beats The Rock n Sock Connection, Christian beats Chris, Victoria beats Molly, Chavo wins the Battle Royal, Rikishi and Scotty 2 hotty beats APA, SPWGTT and the Bashams Brothers, Booker T and RVD beats The Dudleys, Garrison Kade and Mark Jindrak and La Resistance. Extras on the DvD look quite good some matches and interviews ind the 2nd disc and in the 3rd disc there are the 10 Greatest matches at wrestlemania and the mania of WRESTLEMANIA a documentury about wrestlemainia. So 1st disc is the first few matches and 2nd the last few matches and some extras 3rd for extras only. So in my opinion you should get this extrodinary DVD.",1079308800,,1060,4.6436170212765955
2022674,5,B0001OGVQ2,"Overall, this WrestleMania displayed amazing talent of all the WWE superstars. To make it better, it was the 20th anniversary of a sports spectacular and held at the most Famous Arena in the World: Madison Square Garden.
The matches were:
The Big Show vs. John Cena-U.S.Championship
This match was a well deserved win for John Cena who went through all odds to attain his first WWE Belt. 3.5/5
Chris Jericho vs. Christian
An upset. Trish turned on her ""boyfriend"" for a guy like Christian. The end was basically a set-up that resulted in Chris Jericho getting an unnecessary punsishment and Christian and Trish kissing. Long and action filled match to say the least. 3.5/5
Booker T and Rob Van Dam vs. La Resistance vs. Mark Jindrak and Garrison Cade vs. the Dudley Boyz- World Tag Team Championship
Rob Van Dam and Booker T dominated most of the match and their domination resulted in them retaining the World Tag Team Championship. 2.5/5
Rock N Sock Connection vs. Evolution's Randy Orton, Ric Flair and Batista
Very interesting match that ended in the wrong way. It seems like Mick isn't as good as he used to and didn't give it his best. Exciting match with shocking parts throughout the match. 3.5/5
Inter-Promotional Playboy Evening Gown Match
Smackdown!: Torrie Wilson and Sable vs. Raw: Miss Jackie and Stacy Kiebler
Hot match that made WrestleMania full of excitement, a little short though. 3/5
Open Cruiserweight Elimination Match-Cruiserweight Championship
Way too short. Rey Mysterio should of won out of all the others. Cheap ending. 2/5
Inter-Promotional Match
Smackdown!: Brock Lesnar vs. Raw: Goldberg- Special Guest Referee Stone Cold Steve Austin
A lot of mind games and intense power shown throughout the match. Pretty short though-- If you add up all the wrestling time together and subtract all the intimidation they used. Goldberg came out on top by using two spears and one Jackhammer Slam to end Brock Lesnar. Strange that Stone Cold stunned Goldberg at the end though. 4/5
Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty vs. the Basham Brothers vs. the APA vs. The Self-Proclaimed World's Greatest Tag Team- WWE Tag Team Championship
Pretty good match with a cool celebration at the end of the match. All teams gave it all they got to come out on top. 3/5
Victoria vs. Molly Holly- WWE Women's Championship- If Molly is to lose, she has to shave her head bald
The match was OK with aggression dished out by both women. Nice ending. Molly's head getting shaven bald by Victoria. She got what was coming. 3/5
Eddie Guerrero vs. Kurt Angle- WWE Championship
A lot of technical wrestling used in this match. It was a long match and both guys did whatever they could to win the match. Eddie may have used the cheap way out of this one and it seemed like Kurt Angle had the ropes but the referee didn't see it. But, the end result was Eddie Guerrero retaining the WWE Championship. 4.5/5
Inter-Promotional Match
Smackdown!: Undertaker vs. Raw: Kane
Paul Bearer returns! Old-School Undertaker is back! He has risen from the dead and beat Kane with a chokeslam and a tombstone. A little too short of a match, I expected it to be a little longer. 4/5
Triple Threat Match- Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels vs. Chris Benoit- World Heavyweight Championship
Excellent match. May have been no Disqualification but they all ended up bleeding. All the participants gave it everything they had for the belt. Triple H tried to fight out of the Crippler Crossface, but I guess the lengthy time that he had it on him caused him to tap out. Emotional ending with Chris Benoit finally winning what he has been waiting to win for his whole life: the World Heavyweight Championship. Long-Time friend Eddie Guerrero who retained his title earlier in the evening celebrated Chris Benoit's victory along with him as they both would walk out the arena as champions. 5/5
This WrestleMania also showed a sign of Edge's return to the WWE.
Overall this night was a 5 hour roller-coaster that brought the roof off Madison Square Garden.
This is a must buy DVD that celebrates the greatest sports spectacular of all time- WrestleMania XX!",1079222400,,4104,4.830965909090909
2022675,3,B0001OGVQ2,"WMXX had the most hype of any event ever. I had high hopes and I almost knew they could not be met.
The show started off with a decent but slow opener between Cena and Show. It was entertaining although Cena's freestyle was terrible and his crowd support dropped a lot. 7/10
Raw fatal 4-way was real weak. Short and painless, Cade and Jindrak did nothing and the Dudleys and Resistance were sleepwalking. 4/10
Jericho vs Christian was a solid performance- not their best but decent. The Trish turn was the only surprise of the night 7/10
Rock and Sock vs Evolution was a let down. There was nothing new here and Foley was terrible. Rock and Orton carried this match. 6/10
Evening Gown match was a waste of time. Once ur in playboy whats the point of evening gowns. The wrestling was horrible. Stacy was the only one worth watching. 3/10
Cruiserweight open was the worst waste of talent ever. Given about 10 mins for 10 men...only 2 in the ring at a time? COME ON WWE! what could have been the best high flyer battle royal turned into a horrendous display with only kidman and mysterio worth watching. 5/10
Brock vs Goldberg should have been a classic. It ended up being the worst match of the night. A 5 min standoff and only 5 offensive manuevers and no austin action? 1/10 PITIFUL!
Smackdown 4 way was worse than raw...worlds greatest tag team is by far the only team that can work in that match. luckily it was short and horrible. 2/10
Womens match was also a letdown with no good moves pulled. a crappy ending and not entertaining. worst part is molly looks better bald. 2/10
Finally we get to the big 3 matches. Guerrero vs Angle was a solid effort though not as good as expected. Angle always puts on a good show and eddie just seemed only 90%. 8/10
The undertaker return was the most anticipated match of the night. He ended up coming back looking more like a cowboy with his same biker outfit and a girl haircut. Hes just not the same. He didn't even fly over the ropes. This match was quick and they had no chemistry. WM14 was much much better. 5/10
I did not have high hopes for the trip-threat but boy was i pleased. Best match of the night by far and the only memorable moment of WMXX. A great performance by all 3 men and WMXX finished on a high note. 10/10.
As for the DVD, the extras are rather lackluster compared to previous years. They include more of the tv shows shown prior to the event rather than this event. They could have put together a much better documentary of the day of mania xx with this 3 disc set which every1 would love. On a side note, the staging is incredible. The effects are wonderfully done. Props to the stage crew. In conclusion, worth watching but don't expect the greatest spectacle of all time",1079222400,,2739,4.404339250493097

The return of the Dead Man after a lengthy absence--he sent Kane to hell, again--Benoit wins the Big Gold & after all these years, why beat the Benoit angle into the ground. You either watch it or you don't, no reason to feel guilt about it or second guess yourself.

John Cena wins his first major title, Rock and Sock reunion, and maybe the only slight letdown being Goldberg & Lesnar--not quite the match they had at Mania '33. If anything, this Mania ranks up there with just about all the great ones I've seen the last few years. Hard to rank them in any order, but a great show....",1518480000,,632,4.310924369747899
