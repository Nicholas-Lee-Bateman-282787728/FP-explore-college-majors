2925960,5,B000UW4X9M,"Rudolph Valentino.  I can see why all the women loved him back then including my Mum.  His acting would stand up well with to-day's actors.  He can be quite restrained for a silent movie actor but he gets the message across.  He has that certain something and one is interested in what becomes of him or rather the characters he plays.

2925961,4,B000UW4X9M,"I purchased this for ""Moran of the Lady Letty"" which I thoroughly enjoyed. According to the literature, Valentino's character was given a Latin name to fit his look. Yes, Valentino was Latin, his mother being French and his father, Italian. I just don't think his look was heavily Latin to the extent that it required a name change for his character. I think Ronald Colman and John Gilbert looked much more Latin when playing such roles in films. It's just my view on the matter. It was interesting to see George O'Brien and William Boyd in small supporting roles. I think Moran is one of the best of the seafaring silents I have seen, and I would highly recommend this set especially if you are not a Valentino fan but like high sea adventures.",1277596800,3,745,4.567164179104478

2925963,5,B000UW4X9M,"Once again Flicker Alley has come through with another top notch release to join GARDEN OF EDEN, JUDEX, and PHANTOM. VALENTINO: REDISCOVERING AN ICON OF SILENT CINEMA (to give the set it's full title) is a 2-DVD set that contains 4 of Rudy's lesser known films and a boatload of extras. This time around the extras are better than the films offered. This is primarily because 2 of the 4 films survive in shortened form (STOLEN MOMENTS, A SOCIETY SENSATION) while a third (THE YOUNG RAJAH) is actually a realization created from stills and surviviving 16mm footage. Only MORAN OF THE LADY LETTY (based on a book by Frank Norris) is presented more or less intact with proper tints and title cards which is good because this follow-up to THE SHEIK shows Paramount creating a more macho image for Valentino to counter criticisms about his ""masculinity"" and to show off his physique to good advantage. There are lines/title cards in the beginning referring to him as ""a dancing master"" and a ""lilly of the valley"".

The extras though are something else altogether. Bonus films, rare footage, landmarks, rememberances, and a 10 page booklet chock full of photos and information. The packaging is first rate and the quality of the material is as good as it can be which makes this set ideal for people just becoming acquainted with Valentino as well as the longtime afficionado. For those just becoming familiar with Rudy don't forget to check out the major Valentino releases such as THE SHEIK/SON OF THE SHEIK, BLOOD AND SAND, COBRA, and FOUR HORSEMEN OF THE APOCALYPSE (where is the Photoplay edition on DVD?). Hardcore fans will already have these titles in their collections along with everything else Valentino. Now if Flicker Alley could just see their way to releasing to the home market their collection of early Howard Hughes films (TWO ARABIAN KNIGHTS, THE RACKET, THE MATING CALL) then silent film fans would have something else to be thankful for. On a more scholarly note Flicker Alley's DISCOVERING CINEMA containing documentaries on the development of color and sound in the movies is also now available.",1190592000,12,2113,4.918767507002801
2925964,5,B000UW4X9M,"This wonderful 2-disc set is crammed with a variety of exciting extra features besides rare and less-known films by Valentino, and for the effort to put it all together in this beautifully presented package this Flicker Alley DVD release already deserves a full 5-star rating.  As one of Hollywood's greatest screen legends from the silent era, Rudolph Valentino is still attracting fans of all ages decades after his untimely death in 1926, which is a testament of the extraordinary on-screen magnetism that made him such a huge star in his short-lived career.  The films on these two DVDs, however, are not the ones that made him one of Hollywood's first sex symbols and idol for many swooning women, but they do fill the gaps and show Valentino in transition from playing villain roles in short or less significant films, to being the star in a hero-type role for which he is best remembered these days.  As such, there are none of the trademark intense and soulful looks in these earlier films for which he later became so beloved, nor are they of the same calibre as ""The Sheik"" or ""The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse"", but they are important steps in Valentino's career which would interest not only his fans but also the general silent film enthusiast.  Two of the films are only about half an hour in length, and the picture quality is not the best, but with good piano or organ accompaniment and an interesting story, they are enjoyable to watch.  ""Stolen Moments"" intrigued me the most, mainly because this was Valentino's last villain role, and wearing a moustache, he appears like a different person altogether.  The 1-hour feature, ""Moran of the Lady Letty"" is a standard romance-adventure with Valentino as the hero who finds freedom and love on the high seas when he is shanghaied by a crew involved in illegal trade, but perhaps the highlight of the four films is the one that is incomplete and has been lovingly reconstructed, namely ""The Young Rajah"".  The themes of mystic Indian powers of foresight which Valentino as the young rajah has inherited, but who was whisked to safety New England when his father's throne was usurped, make this one of his most fascinating and interesting films, even in this incomplete condition.  The use of many still photographs and good intertitles to fill the gaps summarizes the story very well, especially in the first half of the film which is sadly missing.  The film footage that does exist is in poor shape, but all together this condensed and reconstructed version which still runs for about an hour is satisfying to watch nevertheless, and gives insight into Valentino's other popular roles of the early 1920s.

Along with this variety of four different films from Valentino's transition years,  there is a very nice little booklet and many bonus features of all sorts from slide shows, videos of Valentino's Beverly Hills home, never-before-seen short featurettes such as behind-the-scenes on ""The Sheik"" and a 1931 tour around Hollywood, profiles on many people Valentino knew and worked with, and a radio interview with the `Lady in Black' who was seen attending Valentino's memorial every year on the anniversary of his death, and who has become part of the enduring Valentino legacy and memorial.  Needless to say, this DVD set is a real treat for Valentino fans, but also interesting historic information for the serious film enthusiast.",1190332800,19,3405,4.933566433566433
2925965,3,B000UW4X9M,"I bought this for a much lower price elsewhere.  As a Valentino fan, of course, I had to have it.  Am I satified? Somewhat.  Would I recommend it?  Somewhat.
I am not so enthusiasic about it as the other reviewer.  It is interesting IF you are a Valentino fan; some pictures of Valentino and others are rare and the DVD as a whole is a fine concerted effort, although I did spot an error in writing here and there.
His earlier films are here, but missing are the LATER, more popular and well known movies.  This is my problem with this DVD, or one of my problems.  The real treat, for me, anyway, is the Natacha Rambova trailer for When Love Grows Cold---now THAT was interesting.  I really cannot say that the entire content was material I did not come upon in other books or documentaries---yes, some shots I was quite amazed to see.  Bottom line:  Look, if you are a Valentino fan, it's a nice DVD to own---even if you are a fan and pass this up, don't worry.....you are really not missing THAT much; for others; a no go.",1190073600,4,1024,4.31413612565445
2925966,5,B000UW4X9M,"What a fabulous job Jeff Masino of Flicker Alley and his co-producer on this project, Tracy Terhune did for this beautiful 2 DVD set devoted to the silent hero and hearthrob Rudolph Valentino.

For the Valentino fans who have been waiting for this set, I am certain that I am preaching to the choir here, but let me tell you that you will not be at all disappointed when you put in either of the 2 DVDs into your player.

There are four films in the set, and as Emily Leider wisely notes in the booklet, this does cover important periods in Valentino's ascent on the road to stardom.

In chronological order then:

A Society Sensation predates Valentino's stardom, he was a contract player at Universal and not quite on the brink of stardom.  He plays a young American which was quite the change for he was typically cast as a villain at this stage of his career.

Stolen Moments captures Valentino just before his meteoric rise to fame in The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (hello, Warners, this film NEEDS to be on DVD), he is a slick villain and it is clear, he is taking a great delight in the thankless role, so smooth and despicable he is!

Moran of the Lady Letty is a sleeper hit from 1921, filmed after Valentino made a splash as The Sheik and it is a real sleeper in the way of Valentino films.  Valentino plays a young and weathy dandy of San Francisco society who ends up being shanghaied and becomes a man, and finds love with his unlikely sea captain, Moran of the Lady Letty.  Valentino gives a very naturalistic performance and it's worth it to see him looking every inch an able seaman swabbing decks.

Of the films, the disappointment to some will be the restored portions of The Young Rajah.  But, let's face it folks, it's all we are likely ever to get on this film.  The care that went into trying to recreate the experience of the film is not to be sneered at.  Cinematically, the print leaves one wanting, but there is gold in there, too.

I cannot even go into the extras, there are so many.  The photos and memorabilia and fabulous to see, even the DVD menus are done with great care and attention to detail.  There is much rare candid footage of Valentino, footage of his former home Falcon Lair and an incredible collection of photos from Valentino's close friend Paul Ivano, none of which have seen the light of day prior to this DVD.  There is also a new documentary on Valentino Forever and the history of the annual memorial services in Hollywood.  I could go on and on, if you love silent film, if you love Valentino, this is a terrific set to have.

This set is 100% worth every penny, and then some, as there is so much to it.  It will keep a Valentino fan happy for many many hours.  Do not hesitate, this is so worth having.  As a Valentino fan you owe it to yourself, and a silent film fan, you owe it to yourself and if you wait to receive it as an Xmas gift, you will be sorry you waited.

Valentino in this set truly is forever.",1188345600,50,2969,4.338768115942029
8215298,5,B000UW4X9M,"Great set of almost lost (or mostly lost), rare Valentino films, carefully produced. BTW: this is still available from the issuing company for $40, so please buy it from them directly, and not for 6 times as much here.",1448928000,,218,4.615384615384615

8215300,4,B000UW4X9M,"If you're a fan, or even if you're not, this is a nice collection of silent films unavailable elsewhere. A bit expensive but this got quite a restoration effect and that must be supported by the public. Some movies I like more than others but becase of the varying topics and acting abilities, this makes for fun viewing.",1390867200,2,321,4.551724137931035
8215301,5,B000UW4X9M,"1) Valentino in as little clothing as possible, 2) Valentino in a tight bathing suit, 3) Valentino acting adorable after being beaten up, 4) Valentino wet in the water, 5) Valentino face, 6) Valentino butt, 7) Valentino package, 8) Valentino bod.

In terms of the movies plots, all four kick so much ass. The Young Rajah, while sadly partially lost, leaves the viewer wanting more. It was clearly a wife/husband/wife effort that puts V in the skankiest Indian clothing possible. A VERY GOOD THING!!! Plus, you get to see him in a tight little bathing suite that leaves little to the imagination. AWESOME!!! The vision is permanently burned onto the backs of my eyelids. Stolen Moments has Rudy as a wicked little devil, which is always way ultra sex-ay. A Society Sensation is so 20's, it makes me die in the best way. He's cute as s*** in it. Moran is my favorite, just because Rudy is such a dreamy little sailor. Yow!!! FOXXXAY. If you don't think that spending $30 Washington's on this would be worth it, think again. IT IS. I haven't even described the plots, but they're all very watchable and enjoyable. GET IT NOW. VALENTINO is a TOTAL SEX MACHINE.",1379376000,2,1156,4.666666666666667
8215302,5,B000UW4X9M,Rudolph Valentino was a brilliant actor . One just has to watch a Rudolph Valentino film to see him use his body and face to make the story come alive . No one since has had a face as handsome and expressive ....What a tragedy for him to have died so young at 31. This is a great collection of some of his movies and a look into his life.,1365552000,2,338,3.842857142857143
8215303,5,B000UW4X9M,Don't think about to place this order or not...no more...do it!!!I've found rare movies and a lot of extra in one place. Good price. My collection thanks. Good quality.malefica from Italy.,1357948800,,188,5.096774193548387
8215304,5,B000UW4X9M,"What can I say? I'm a Valentino fan. He's unique. Never was one before him and hasn't been one like him since. (Grace Kelly, Audrey Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe) are similar ""elegant tricks of the light"". I loved ""The Yong Rajah"" though it was disjointed as it had been pieced together having been thought lost. ""Stolen Moments"" and ""A Society Sensation"" likewise ere fun to watch though not great cinema. Come to think of it, however, what IS great cinema? The stuff being presented these days are generally propaganda pieces promoting the directors' and/or stars' political positions.",1356825600,2,581,5.0625
8215305,5,B000UW4X9M,"While most of the film, ""The Young Rajah"", is lost - that which was salvaged has been so cleverly ""re-created"" using the saved film clips and story boards.

There's ""Stolen Moments"" with Valentino playing a cad (really well too!)

Got to tell you....one of my sons happened to pass through the room while I was viewing ""Stolen Moments"" and stopped dead in his tracks (both my sons being fans of mixed martial arts) upon seeing Valentino take down the brother of a would-be conquest using a perfectly executed wrestling hold - then finish the guy off with a savat kick!  After replaying the scene several times (at my son's request) he was duly impressed.

""Moran of the Lady Letty"" portrays a different Valentino then apparently people were accustomed to, but a wonderful Valentino nonetheless.  You'll find no glossy comb down in this film....just a pea-coat, denims and sneakers.

The extras included on the second disc are great.  I particularly enjoyed the video walk through of the interior of Falcon's Lair before it was razed in 2002.  You are shown the original features that were still visible even after Doris Duke's extensive redecorating.  I found one of the add-ons that Valentino required a little odd, but hey it was his house.

Definitely worth owning if you are a Valentino fan.",1344384000,,1295,4.872146118721461
8215306,5,B000UW4X9M,"After watching Valentino in THE EAGLE I just had to watch more of his other films and I see now why the man was so loved. He had something alot of other actors in his time, since or even today lack, it's called 'CHARISMA'...The camera loved him. He had such a presence on screen. I think out of the movies on this dvd,THE YOUNG RAJAH had to be my favorite. Just such a shame this film was lost and some had to be put together with some pictures rather than the film but atleast I was able to see it.",1330560000,2,499,4.0
8215307,5,B000UW4X9M,This collection is AMAZING :D. I think that every Valentino's fan must have this! The movies restored preserve all their original beauty and the special contents are very interesting. A collection made from who loved Valetino to all  his fans! You will not regret to buy this! In Italy this collection isn't available and I've bought it from Amazon.com. I'm really happy about Amazon and his expedition methods!! Thank you Amazon!!!!,1315180800,,433,5.098591549295775
