8495531,1,B0069W22GI,"Please be careful when you order: there were 5 DVDs in the ""complete second season"" set. I only received one disc for $50, only 3 episodes, but it was still entitled ""complete"". Be sure every episode is named (only 3 were named, and since some episodes of the previous set were lenghthy and originally viewed as two, I didn't realize the problem) and that the offer says ""5 DVD set"". Haven't watched it, as I'm going to check into returning it.",1434326400,,444,4.493827160493828
