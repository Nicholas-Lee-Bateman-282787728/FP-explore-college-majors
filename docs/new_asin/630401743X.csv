768804,5,630401743X,"the reason i chose the trilogy instead of individually is primarilly because john mclain is not a one movie man,and all three films have to be compared. ""die hard"" made willis an action star. hell,it made the  action genre,that people seem to give arnold credit for. the first movie  truly is the best action movie you will ever see made,bar none.  however....""die harder"" and ""with a vengence"" also had  a lot of merits,and can even surpass the original for sheer enjoyment.  ""dh1"" takes place in la,as we become introduced to ny detective  john mclean,an ordinary guy in an extrordinary circumstance. but he is a  cop,which lends plausablity to his actions and reactions. mclean just wants  to get back with his wife,the beautiful bonnie bedilia,who also appears in  ""dh2"" as an airline passanger who is on a plane destined for  disaster. bruce,in the airport,tries to prevent the planes from hitting the  ground and the bad guys from leaving the ground. guess who wins...all  kidding aside,this sequel matched the ernestness of the original,lending  creedence to the obvious ""oh here we go again"" syndrome, which  does give this entry a lighter tone. but it also lends itself more to  repeat viewing. now in ""dh3"", john tiernan,the director of the  original, returns and puts bruce back in his element,the greatest city in  the world,and boy do they have fun with it. along for the ride are samual  l.jackson as a good samaritan,and the extremly underated jeremy irons as  the villian. this feature plays upon cat and mouse tactics beautifully,and  for that reason alone,makes for the most repeat viewings. but it certainly  doesn't hurt to have mr.irons presence,and mr.tiernan's eye. sorry star  wars fans,but this is the best trilogy around.",917049600,6,1747,5.056140350877193

769259,4,630401743X,"I got this thinking it was fullscreen, yes I read the ad but somehow goofed, must have been my bad.  The first disc I just watched and it showed up on my thirty nine inch new tv as a box with black all around it, so I set my remote to make it wide and and that made it normal widescreen otherwise very wierd, second disc I've seen do that Leathal Weapon did the same thing on my comp, so I don't know why these discs aren't making a normal widescreen pic but beware that if you don't have the option to stretch your pic, or wide your pic, etc.  This may be a problem.  Overall a good movie with tons of action, drags on a bit after just seeing it a little while ago, so it's one of those every few years movies not like Avengers where you can watch it over and over, but that's just me.  I would recommend it if it's from your generation and you enjoyed it before, comes with bonus disc for each movie so six discs in all, didn't watch the bonus so no info.  Best price for this edition compared to other offers, but missing two in the series of five movies.",1382400000,,1058,4.019047619047619

The movies are as great as ever. However, I was very disappointed with the quality of the DVDs on this set. I purchased this to replace my old VHS tapes and was sorry I did. These are supposedly digitaly remastered and with Dolby 5.1, but the sound quality is terrible on disk 1 and disk 2. There is certainly no ""surround sound"" on either of the first two disks.

769716,4,630401743X,"It was hard for me to see the first Die Hard movie. The reason was because
Bruce Willis played such an un-likeable scumbag in Miami Vice his strong performance sunk in. After a friend of mine highly recomended it I figured
""what the heck"" and went. The action match anything the Indiana Jones series had to offer.

The supporting cast was superb with Bonnie Bedila's performance as the no-nonesense wife, to Hart Bochner's role as the sniffling weasle willing to
sell out John McLean in order to let negoitions work out, to William Atherton's performance as the reporter who's motto is damn who might be hurt, the story is the important thing, James Shigetia who had an all too short time on the screen., Alexander Goudonov playing Hans Gruber right hand man looking to settle a score with our hero, and last but not least Alan Rickman's performance as the ""terrorist leader"". Why the man did not gain an oscar nomination is beyond me.

The second installment was a worthy sequel, while I felt the thrid installment was lacking, and the most recent installment in my opinion
was the best of the sequels. In fact, for the next installment should take place during Lucy's wedding to the young man who helped out in Live
Free or Die Hard and have Holly show up was an ultra-liberial as her boyfriend and add a twist to the whole affair.

And for those who want to buy this get the ones that were

released in 2000 better sound don't fall prey to there promotional crap. And im sure they will release this again when Die Hard 4 comes out proof positive that these studios are not smart on releasing Dvd's.",1182124800,5,924,4.133333333333334
770001,5,630401743X,"Let me start by assuring you that, no, I am not employed by Fox or the production or development teams behind the Die Hard franchise, nor am I one of the actors / actresses involved.  I'm just a regular movie buff like most everybody else who surfs the movie pages on Amazon.  Now that that is out of the way . . .

After seeing all (and I mean ALL) the other reviews trashing this product, I feel it is necessary to bring attention the positive side to this product (and yes, there is one).  The fact of the matter is that, for those movie enthusiasts who don't yet own the Die Hard films in their libraries and/or who have little or no interest in the usually excessive ""extras,"" this package is an excellent value.

For $28.00 you get three great actions movies with some extras (the ones that are probably actually worth watching anyways), a preview of the upcoming fourth Die Hard, as well as a voucher to see it for free when it comes to theaters.  It is beyond me how anybody could call this a bad deal.

Comparatively, the previous boxed-set everybody else keeps mentioning is around $10.00 more in price, doesn't include the free movie ticket (a $10.00 or more value in some areas these days), and has fatter cases that will hog more of your precious shelf-space.  Sure, they have the infamous ""second"" discs flaunted by movie studios, but unless you are seriously obsessed with the movies, these second discs usually amount to junk anyways - usually thrown together to give the studio an excuse to inflate the price and bulk up their own profits.

In the end, for the vast majority of movie-watchers, this new edition of the Die Hard collection amounts to a more than ample package and experience, and at a price to ""die"" for.

**UPDATE**  Upon acquiring and opening my copy of this Die hard boxed-set, I have found that the ""free"" movie voucher is good up to only $8.50 (not $10.00 as I previously mentioned in this review).  This is still a sufficient discount, and should cover the majority of one admission - if not all - in most theaters around the country.  While this won't affect my score, I do feel readers are entitled to know exactly what they will be getting, and to know that I had no intention to mislead anybody with my previous comments on this feature.

**SECOND UPDATE**  Be forewarned, AMC Theatres really don't want to take the Die Hard movie vouchers.  I attempted to use mine at the AMC near me recently, and succeeded only after taking my case to the guest services counter.  Employees there claimed AMC doesn't honor the vouchers, but nowhere on the voucher or in the theater or its box office was there any form of disclaimer stating so in writing for customers to see freely.  So, if you are planning on using your voucher at an AMC, don't be surprised if the cashier turns it down, and be prepared to stand your ground.  It's amazing to me that a movie theater would be so reluctant to take a coupon (one for which they get completely reimbursed) issued directly from the very studios that are keeping them in business.",1182124800,31,3056,4.533697632058288
770002,1,630401743X,"I totally agree with the comments above and the ones below to follow. This is typical for studios especialy Fox to do something like this considering the 4th film is around the corner and a much better box set is available, the Die Hard five star ultimate edition. Obviously there will be another box set available once the 4th film is released and ultimatly released again in high definition.",1181088000,8,393,4.7101449275362315

1) There are already better versions of each movie out already (or the already-existing box set). Each of those has 2 discs per movie while this set has only 1. The extra disc on this set is just hype for the new Die Hard 4 movie.

2) Do you think the greedy studios WON'T put out a new Box Set with 1,2,3 and 4 when DH4 comes out on DVD? Please...

Willis became a superstar with the first Die Hard, and he is riveting as John McClain, the New York cop in L.A. With the always watchable Bonnie Bedelia as his wife, and the flashy Alan Rickman as the mercenary/entrepenour, the film is a non-stop rollercoaster ride! Die Hard 2 lacks Rickman's charisma as the villain, but Willis again gives a dynamite performance, and Bedelia is even better than in the first film. Spectacular special effects abound! Die Hard With a Vengence, the weakest of the trio, was originally intended as Lethal Weapon 4, but was rewritten for Willis and Samuel Jackson.

With an amazing cast, wonderful script, solid directing, this is a rare example of the perfect movie.  If you love action movies and haven't ever seen Die Hard before, stop reading this review and go pick up the film.  Even 18 years later, the movie had stood the test of time with barely a bump in the road, and it's the quickest 2+ hours that will go by.

***** HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION

Die Hard 2 is another fine movie and a wonderful sequel.  The writers could have easily copied the same storyline as with the original Die Hard (see the Under Siege films), but instead they go a different route with another fine script.  This movie only gets better with age for me.  Another solid performance by Bruce Willis, fine directing and you have a sequel while not as good as the original, it's enjoyable to say the least.

**** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

'Die Hard With A Vengeance' is an odd film.  Wonderfully acted and written at times, there are scenes which I think are even better than the original Die Hard.  But then you have ridiculous moments like Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson falling 100+ feet and not killing themselves where the movie just falls flat.  I think the script itself is even better than the Die Hard 2 story, but with 5 years time between the 2nd and 3rd films, this just doesn't have the same enjoyment as the other movies.  Deciding to make Bruce Willis a divorced down and out drunk cop doesn't help you connect as well to the character as in the 1988 and 1990 films either, so this movie gets the lowest rating of the bunch.

Undoubtedly the best movies Bruce Willis ever made, these films deservee to be in any dvd collection. Here is the sypnosis for each film.

""Die Hard"" (1988, R) New York City Police Officer John McClane (Bruce Willis) has travelled out to sunny Los Angeles to spend Christmas with his estranged wife Holly (Bonny Dedelia) and his kids. Whike going to pick her up from her Nokatomi Plaza, the 40 story skyscraper where she works, terrorists led by the sadistic Hans Gruber (played brilliantly by Alan Rickman) take over the building and hold everyone in their hostage - including Holly. Now, it is up to McClane to save the lives of everyone in there and have a merry Christmas with his family. Stunning action sequences and special effects as well as great acting create one of the greatest cop dramas ever made. 5/5

""Die Hard 2: Die Harder"" (1990, R) The sequel to the 1988 megahit has Bruce Willis returning as John McClane. In this one, McClane is stranded in a Washington, D.D. airport, awaiting the arival of his wife Holly (a returning Bonny Bedelia). However, a group of terrorists is planning to take over the airport. McClane gets wind of the plan and tries the warn the hard headed airport police chief (Dennis Franz) and the stubborn commander of the U.S. Army anti-terrorist squad. The terrorists seize control of the airport, and no travelling planes can land, meaning the planes overhead are running desparately low on fuel - including Holly's. It is up to McClane to save the day once more in this action packed sequel that's as is good as the first. 5/5

""Die Hard With A Vengeance"" (1995, R) Most people will have trouble watching the third cahpter in the series after the events of 9/11, but to me it is still the best film in the series. Bruce Willis returns for a third time as John McClane. In this one, he is once again living apart from his wife Holly (Bonny Bedelia does not return for this one) in New York City, where he is orignally based. When a wave of terrorist attacks hit the city, McClane is forced into a deadly game of cat and mouse with the terrorist leader (Jeremy Irons). After having his life saved by a civillian (Samuel L. Jackson),McClane recruits him as his partner to find the terrorist. When McClane learns the real reason why the terrorist has chosen him to participate in his little games, everything results in yet another action packed thrillride that's even better than the first two. 5/5

The dvds are loaded with exciting extras as well as great sound and picture quality. This is one dvd set that belongs in any collection.",1122681600,16,2740,4.643298969072165
770157,5,630401743X,"I am a HUGE movie buff, and when it comes to a good action movie with good actors, you can't go wrong.  Bruce Willis remains one of my favorite actors, and thanks to the Twentieth Century Fox home entertainment company, all of Willis' best films- the ""Die Hard"" trilogy"" have all been re-released together in one package (finally)!  Here is a rundown of every film:

""Die Hard"" (1988) is about a New York City cop named John McClane (Willis), who is flying to Los Angeles for Christmas to visit his wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) and their two children, John Jr. and Lucy.  When John arrives in Los Angeles, he goes to the Nakatomi Building in dowtown L.A., which is where Holly works.  John and Holly are looking forward for a nice Christmas Eve and a nice Christmas at home with their kids once Holly has finished up her work at Nakatomi.  But John and Holly soon discover that they have to wait a few hours before all of that can happen- because a group of German terrorists, led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) have taken over the building, leaving several hostages, members of the LAPD, and the whole FBI scared while John is running all around the building, killing terrorists while he is trying to save the hostages.

""Die Hard 2: Die Harder"" (1990) is where John and Holly are spending Christmas together by themselves in Washington, DC while their kids are with Holly's mother.  So nothing wrong can happen this time, right?  Wrong.  A foreign drug lord named Esperanza has finally been arrested and is being brought to the United States so he can face trial.  This is when a group of terrorists decide to rescue Esperanza, which means that they will be in the control tower, and planes which are scheduled to arrive in Washington are delayed- while John McClane finds that it is again up to him to save the lives of millions, which is two years after he has become famous and has received a lot of recognition for saving everyone in the whole Nakatomi incident.

""Die Hard With a Vengeance"" (1995)finds John McClane in his hometown of New York.  When the movie starts off, McClane is on suspension, but it is an enjoyable suspension for McClane, considering the fact that his suspension has consisted of him drinking, smoking, and watching cartoons.  But all of that comes to an end when a terrorist named Simon (Jeremy Irons)makes the NYPD contact McClane so he can go to Harlem wearing nothing but his boxers, as well as carrying a sign that says ""I Hate N*****s"", and McClane is about to be killed by either six or seven black guys until a Harlem shop owner named Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson) saves McClane's life, which then results in John and Zeus running all over New York, playing some ""games"" that Simon has made for them.

Here is also what you get for the bonus feautures on all three films:

For the bonus featutures included on the first ""Die Hard"" film, you will get to see a featurette that goes behind the scenes from when the actors and producers making this movie were filming it.

The bonus feautures on ""Die Hard 2"" show a deleted scene and two-not one, special effects featurettes for this film.

As for the bonus feautures on ""Die Hard With a Vengeance"", there are no interviews, but you will get to see the short, never before seen alternate ending for this film.

All three ""Die Hard"" films are some of the greatest action movies ever made.  Action movies have been popular for quite a while now, and even though other action movies out there are really good, the ""Die Hard"" films definitely set the standards for an action film.  If you enjoyed all three ""Die Hard"" films, then I would recommend you buy this boxed set- even if you already own the original videos for all three films.  And here is an interesting, not incredibly well known fact for fans of both the ""Die Hard"" films and KISS fans: Gene Simmons was offered a role in the first ""Die Hard"" film as one of the terrorists (presumably Hans) but turned the part down.",1109894400,4,3953,4.569405099150142
770158,5,630401743X,"Three of the finest action films ever made are contained in this boxset. Bruce Willis does a good job in these films. John McClane is one of the best action-film cop heroes of all time.

Die Hard - While out in L.A. visiting his wife, New York cop John McClane finds himself in the middle of a terriorist takeover. Armed with only his Berreta and wise-cracks, he sets out to free his wife and the other hostages from the terrorists. This is a great action movie for the guys.

Die Hard 2 - Not the best in the series. Bruce Willis returns, but without all the humor of the first. While battling terrorist again, you'll wonder why he's even trying. The spotlight doesn't shine to brightly on Bruce. The funniest part of the whole movie comes when McClane punches a guy in the mouth. You'll see why if you want to sit through this. Good title, Okay action.

Die Hard 3 - John McClane Returns to kick serious butt, if he can get rid of his hangover! McClane's doing battle this time around with Simon Grubuer, Hans Grubuer's brother. Simon sets out to destory John McClane for throwing his little brother out of The Naktomi building in the first Die Hard. Setting up elebrate bombs all over New York, he almost succeeds in destroying the city. With the mix of humor and heavy action, John McTierman does a excellent job returning to the director's chair.

I feel Die Hard 1 and 3 are the gems of this boxset.

Die Hard 2 seems to be a rehash of the first one to me.",1109203200,,1462,4.360294117647059
770159,5,630401743X,"Die Hard defined the concept of tension, with McClane trapped in a building, maybe in elevator shafts, trying to kill the terrorists, save his wife, and destroy the building. Die Hard 2 started the mayhem all over again, as McClane found himself up against terrorists trying to rescue a drug kingpin, taking over Dulles International Airport, grounding all airplanes and leaving them trapped in the air and running out of fuel, AND screwing the passengers up in the process. Die Hard with A Vengeance showed Hans Gruber (the terrorist leader in the original)'s brother up for revenge. Him and his terrorists place bombs throughout the city of NYC to cover up a massive heist, worth all the gold in the Federal Reserve, and trick McClane into thinking it's an act of revenge. Overall the series is wildly entertaining, but it's made even better by this explosive giftset. Great audio commentaries, behind-the-scenes footage, slideshows, trailers, TV commercials, etc., all make this one of the better giftsets out there. Buy it if you want RAW action.",1100390400,,1050,5.040229885057471
770160,5,630401743X,"Watching all three of the phenomenally successful DIE HARD movies is an exhausting, yet rewarding, exercise in how to make an action movie.  Directors John McTiernan (1 and 3), and Renny Harlin (2) keep the action brisk, full of gun fights, fistfights, explosions, car chases, etc.  Bruce Willis is the ultimate cop hero as John McClane, the rebel with a cause.  In ""Die Hard"" John is in LA to visit his estranged wife, Holly, who is high on the corporate ladder in a Japanese company, helmed by the reliable James Shigeta.  Nasty pseudoterrorist, high falootin thief Alan Rickman (delightfully villainous) plans to steal 600 million dollars in bonds while under the pretense of a terrorist raid. Willis is in the building, and along with his silent partner (the great Reginald VelJohnson), he manages to save the day but not without a lot of exciting action sequences.  Bonnie Bedelia, William Atherton, Hart Bochner and Paul Gleason add some good support, and it's a slam bang actioner!

In the second movie, Willis finds himself again at Christmas, this time at Dulles Airport, awaiting his wife's arrival from LA.  This time around, we have a nasty dope kingpin (Franco Nero) about to be extradited for his crimes, but he has a whole slew of terrorists out to make sure he is not brought to justice.  Bonnie Bedelia as Holly, William Atherton as the world's most obnoxious newsreporter, and Reginald VelJohnson (although only briefly) are brought back for this tense, edge of the seat action.  William Sadler, Dennis Franz and John Amos are along for the ride on this one.

The final movie, ""..with a Vengeance"" is quite different from the first two.  No Bedelia or Atherton this time (and I did miss them somewhat), but Willis is the target of revenge by a game-playing Jeremy Irons (all blonded and buffed up).  He receives first rate support from Samuel L. Jackson, the marvelous Larry Bryggman (As the World Turns)and Graham Greene.  Tense and nerve-wracking, this wraps up a really great trio of action movies.

They really haven't gotten better than this for pure adrenaline and action!",1098230400,5,2096,4.917613636363637
770161,5,630401743X,"With action films all the rage in the 1980s', director John McTernian took a stab at it and struck gold with ""Die Hard"". This was the film that made Bruce Willis a star and proved that action films could be more than rediculous, overblown shootouts. It inspired two smash sequels. All three are in this boxed set.
1988's ""Die Hard"" is where it all began. Hardened New York City cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) just wants to fly out to L.A. and spend Christmas with his kids and his estranged wife Holly (Bonny Bedelia). But when he goes to meet his wife at her work station at Nakatomi Plaza, things go awry. A group of Russian terrorists led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman in his best pre - Harry Potter role). They kill the office's head boss and hold everyone hostage - including Holly. McClane goes out on a limb with only his gun and his cunning to protect him. What ensues is nonstop, heartstopping action and some great moments of humor. Also in this film is Reginald VelJohnson, the star of the longrunning tv show ""Family Matters"".
McTernian was absent for 1990's ""Die Hard 2: Die Harder"". so Renny Harlin was tapped to direct. Willis, Bedelia and VelJohnson were the only original castmemebers for this one. In this one, McClane is at a Wshington D.C. airport waiting for Holly's plane to land. While waiting, he gets involved in a shootout that results in death and has an argument with an imcompetent police chief (Dennis Franz). Worse, he gets word that a group of terrorists are planning to take over the airport and free a drug lord. All this chaos throws McClane back into action. This causes flights to be delayed, and many planes are running low on fuel - including Holly's. While not as good as the first one, this one has enough thrills and comedy to satisfy.
After a five - year absence forom the screen, 1995 saw ""Die Hard With A Vengeance"" released. This is one is my personal favorite. Willis once more plays McClane. This one is quite different from he first two. First, the plot has nothing to do with Holly (Bonny Bedelia). In fact, Holly isn't even this film at all. Second, this film has McClane in his official city of work, New York. Still, it's a great movie. In this one, a bomber named Simon (Jeremy Irons) is targeting McClane for a delightful game of cat and mouse (wait until you find out why). So McClane once again goes out on a limb to risk his life for innocent people. Only, this time he has help from a reluctant civillian (Samuel L. Jackson). Once more, heartstopping action and hilarious humor fills the movie.
Extras include documentaries, tarilers and comentaries. This a great collection movies that I highly recommend. Also recommended is the ""Lethal Weapon"" boxed set and the ""Dirty Harry"" boxed set.",1090108800,4,2748,4.621676891615542

Lacking big names (Bruce Willis was still in his ""Moonlighting"" phase) but working with a servicable script, he crafted one of the greatest and most successful movies of all time, not to mention 2 smash hit sequels, both of which are featured in this extraordinary boxed set. It also made Bruce Willis a big name, and he hasn't made another film as great as these (with the exception this film about a kid who could see dead people).
""Die Hard"" begins with hard - boiled police officer John McClane (Willis) arriving in Los Angeles to join his estranged wife Holly (Bonny Bedelia) and his kids for Christmas. He meets her at Nakatomi Plaza, a 40 - foot skyscraper, as well his wife's office building. They plan to go home as soon as the Christmas party ends. McClane is hoping that maybe he and Holly will even reconcile. However, these plans go awry when a group of Russian terrorists led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman in a showstealing role). Holding the building hostage and executing the boss, McClane knows that he has to spring into action and rescue his wives as well as thousands of other hostages. What entails is nonstop action: great shootouts, great lines (Yippe - ky - a, well you know the rest) and the powerful ending. Also included is ""Family Matters""' Reginald Vel Johnson as Sgt. Al Powell, who brings comic relief as John's only friend outside the building. So buckle up, it's going to be an exciting ride.
McTernian was absent for 1990's ""Die Hard 2: Die Harder"". Director Renny Harlin was called in to hlm this blockbuster sequel. It takes place in Washington D.C.,  exactly one year at Dulles International Airport. Willis and Bedellia return as John and Holly. They've reconciled and are spending Christmas with each other. John awaits Holly's arrival impatiently, especially since her landing time keeps getting delayed. To make matters worse, terrorists have seized control of the entire airport, holding thousands of travellers hostage from thousands of feet above the ground - including Holly. Once more, John must get out his pistol and shoot whatever s.o.b comes within 10 feet of him. Great action.
After a 5 - year hiatus, Willis returned to the role that launched his career in ""Die Hard With A Vengeance"". Also returning is John McTernian, the man who made the first ""Die Hard"" a classic. Absent this time are Bonny Bedelia and Reginald Vel Johnson. John is now on the streets of New York, the city where he started. Holly's at home. One hot summer day, a bomb suddenly goes off, and McClane is taunted by the shady Simon (Jeremy Irons). After a while, McClane learns that Simon is the brother of Hans Gruber, the villian from the first film. With the help of a civillian named Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson in the second of three movies he teamed with Willis), McClane leads on a wild ride through the deadly streets of New York.
I highly recommend the purchase of this set, especially if you're a fan of action movies. It will have you thrilled and even laughing. Yippe - ky - a!",1081468800,,3102,4.6917431192660555
770166,5,630401743X,"Bruce Willis has made numerous action movies that are truly memorable classics over his career and Die Hard is considered by many to be his crowning achievements in his acting career and I have to say I do agree with them even though some of his other movies do deserve recognition as well. The series concluded in 1995 with ""Die Hard: With A Vengeance"". All three of these Die Hard movies are totally awesome and this is not a movie trilogy that went downhill with each sequel like the Batman, and Jurassic Park trilogies did with time. All three of these Die Hard movies are must-haves. Let's not forget that unforgettable movie quote ""Yippee Kayee Mother [edited for inappropriate language]!"".
DIE HARD (1988): This is likely to be considered the best of the Die Hard movies in this series. Although that may be difficult for me to agree, I do have to say that it was a groundbreaking and terrifying but fun ride. In this one, John McClane, a tired out NYPD officer takes a vacation to Los Angeles to visit his estranged wife who he hadn't spoken to in a long time. However, the dream turns into a cesspool of a nightmare when the building that Mrs. McClane is in, is taken over by a band of vicious terrorists lead by renegade Hans Gruber. John McClane, now leads a one-man army (That's himself) in a fight against the terrorists and to rescue the hostages in the building. Bruce Willis is awesome playing the disgruntled terrorist-fighter John McClane but Alan Rickman steals the spotlight as the vicious terrorist leader Hans Gruber, whose cunning personality is quiet yet very threatening as to warrant attention. This movie was a well-deserved smash hit and is an action classic that was many years ahead of it's time. The explosions, fight scenes while a bit much at times, were totally awesome. This set the scale for the next two to follow. There is also a lot of really cool stuff like commentary from the director John McTierman along with commentary from the actors. Along the commentary are deleted scenes, behind the scenes and outtakes from the movie's making along with talk behind the making of the movie. Really cool stuff!
DIE HARD 2: DIE HARDER (1990): A small number of fans seemed to have considered this a disappointing follow-up to the first one and said it didn't live to that one. To those, I  say baloney! ""Die Harder"" is just as good as the original and has an even darker, colder tone than the first one. This time, John McClane's second deadly adventure takes place at Dulles International Airport after it is taken over by a vicious band of rogue terrorists and they threaten to crash a jetliner if a dangerous political prisoner isn't released on the deadline that they've set. Even worse, planes that are stranded in mid-air and not allowed to land are beginning to run low on fuel and one of the planes' passengers is none other than our beloved Mrs. McClane. Now the heat is on to flush out these mean nasty militia terrorists and to save the fleet from meeting their fiery doom on the runway in a nasty snowstorm. I disagree with those who said that this was weaker than the first Die Hard Movie. This is just as good, if not better. Dennis Franz is awesome as the foul-tempered police sergeant who's in charge of the police activity going on at the airport. This, like the 1988 original, contains commentary from the director Renny Harlin along with behind the scenes and deleted scenes.
DIE HARD: WITH A VENGEANCE (1995): The third and final installment in the awesome movie series is lighter in tone than the first two. This time, John McClane returns home to his city of New York City where his job as a police officer is stationed at. After the downfall and demise of the infamous Hans Gruber, the population of New York is held hostage by none other than Simon Gruber, the brother of Hans Gruber and threatens to released an extremely toxic chemical into the atmosphere and kills thousands of innocent lives. This time, McClane teams up with another undercover police officer (Played by Samuel L. Jackson), whom he has clashed numerous times with to bring down Simon Gruber and his cronies. In light of recent world events, this movie is even more chilling to watch but still an excellent third and final installment in this awesome movie series. In a lot of ways, this not only returns to the fun of the first but also breaks the mold by removing the friendliness of Officer Al Powell, and replacing him with the unpleasant comrade Zeus Carver. Really fun stuff watching them clash.
This movie trilogy truly is an excellent purchase for action movie fans. The movies are improved by their vastly superior picture quality on the DVDs and by the extras contained in the individual DVDs. The silver box is really nice too. To me, this is one of the few movie series that stayed on high ground without going downhill retaining the fun yet breaking new ground with each movie. Get this movie collection today, get out the soda and popcorn, and have a swell time. Enough said.",1071187200,5,5015,4.666666666666667

770243,4,630401743X,"The early 1980s were a hotbed of activity in the action/adventure genre. Mel Gibson did ""Lethal Weapon"", Arnold, ""The Terminator"" and ""Conan"" and Eddie Murphy indulged us with ""Beverly Hills Cop"". At about the same time relative unknown, Bruce Willis had made a considerable splash on the small screen, opposite Cybil Shepard in television's ""Moonlighting"". The show, successful and sophisticated, brought Willis to the attention of director, John McTiernan, enough to convince 20th Century Fox to take a chance on them both for a new kind of vigilante thriller - ""Die Hard"".

Willis is John McClane, a New York cop who keeps running up against terrorists - in a high rise (part one), at the airport (part two) and in New York City (part three) - the latter having an ominous ring of dj vu since 9-11.  McClane is a bitterly esoteric man on the verge of divorcing his wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia). It seems that Holly's career meant more to her than her marriage. Moving to LA she's become quite successful working for a multi-billion dollar corporation that, unfortunately, becomes the target of a group of terrorists on Christmas Eve. These men are fronted by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman).

The original ""Die Hard"" was shot on location at Fox's new Century City corporate offices, a venue that provided the film with its iconic poster art of a high rise in peril. The phenomenal box office receipts generated guaranteed a sequel. Unfortunately, for all concerned, McTiernan was unable to commit to a second outing, leaving Renny Harlin in the driver's seat.

Harlin's heavy handed direction and an almost carbon copy plot - except that terrorists have now taken an airport instead of a high rise hostage - make ""Die Hard 2"" a rather pass film experience. Thankfully, McTiernan returned for Part III, an ominously true-to-life scenario in which terrorists fronted by the diabolical brother of Hans, Simon (Jeremy Irons) hold the city of New York hostage with the threat of a nuclear holocaust. Early on, Part III cleverly chose to infuse comic relief in the embodiment of Zeus Carver (Samuel L. Jackson), an unwilling participant in McClane's rescue efforts, whose racial bias toward whites is actually rather endearing in an odd sort of way.

Viewing these films in retrospect ""Die Hard 3"" is also more of an ensemble acting piece than the first two films. Willis' character - once the corner stone of the series, is merely the pretext, rather than the catalyst that propels the film's familiar storyline to its predictable conclusion.

After the really shaky initial release of these movies on DVD, which were among the worst transfers ever conceived for the digital market, Fox went back to the drawing board to completely remaster theses films for deluxe special editions. The results are nothing short of miraculous.

In the case of all three movies: color separation is superb. Contrast, shadow delineation, fine detail and black levels are solid and deep. Aliasing, shimmering and edge enhancement still exist but are at a bare minimum and do not distract from your viewing experience. All three movies have had their soundtracks cleaned up. The results are explosive. You may need seatbelts on your couch before suiting up for part III.

Individually, Part One continues to have its opening fifteen minutes suffer from an orangy haze that tends to render the entire image soft. Although scenes taking place in the limo are quite accurately rendered, those in which McClane first encounters the terrorists in Nakatomi Plaza are out of focus with a color scheme that is muddy at best. The good news is that after those initial fifteen minutes you will be treated to one of the best DVD transfers of a vintage 80s film. Part Two is the most accurately and consistently rendered DVD in the three pack. There's really nothing to complain about here except a hint of edge enhancement and some minor color bleeding (red) in the scenes that take place inside the control tower. Part Three: The youngest of these movies is also the one most inconsistently rendered on DVD. The initial release of Part III on DVD was an embarrassment, so excessively marred by edge enhancement, aliasing and shimmering of fine details and digital grain that one wondered just how blind the person behind the remastering console was. Though this subsequent remastering improves on all of the above mentioned problems, there is still a considerable amount of film grain present. The picture, while not a strain on the eyes, is nevertheless a very intense visual experience. The harsh characteristic is unflattering, though again, not to the extreme levels as before.

Extras include several documentaries, audio commentaries, deleted scenes, stills and theatrical trailers for each movie. Fox calls the first movie a 2-disc ""Five Star"" edition but when compared to parts two and three, labeled as mere ""Special Editions"" (also 2-disc) there is very little to differentiate the discs by way of their extra features.",1050796800,,4992,5.026602176541717

770276,4,630401743X,"The first Die Hard movie can best be described as the mother of all action movies, spawining many clones from ""Die Hard on a Boat"" (Under Siege) to ""Die Hard on a Bus"" (Speed). Not since the Terminator has a series been so consistently good.
Though the three movies have different settings, the elements are basically the same. Bruce Willis plays John McLane, a NYC cop who always seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. In the first movie, terrorists took over a highrise building, along with hundreds of hostages. In the second movie, ""Die Harder"", mercinaries take over an airport and threaten to crash planes, and in the third, ""Die Hard with a Vengance"", a bomber is terrorizing NYC (not a good movie for people still recovering from September 11). McLane, not totally on his will, gets involved as the ""one man against all odds"", and he must single-handedly take the bad guys. He is not your prototypical action hero, in that he is perfectly human, and doesn't excatly want to be doing what he is doing. The role of John McLane fits Bruce Willis like a glove, and he is perfect in every respect.
This DVD set is what ""Die Hard"" fans should have. Not only does it have perfect transfers of all three films, in Widescreen no less, but loads of extras. The first ""Die Hard"" DVD is a bit disappointing. There are no documentaries or featurettes, but there are some nice bloopers, gag reels, outtakes, and extended scenes. The commentary on the first disc is also not very good, with especially boring and slow-moving commentary from Production  Designer Jackson DeGovia. Overall, the extras alone are nice to have, but I wanted more, especially from the best entry in the series.
""Die Hard 2: Die Harder"" is more like what the first one should have been. There are three very entertaining featurettes, some nice interviews, 4 deleted scenes, and insightful commentary from director Renny Harlin. This is a much better package, and although many fans consider this to be the worst in the series, I quite liked this one.
""Die Hard With A Vengence"" is a fine third installment, with Willis teaming up with Samuel L. Jackson to fight mad bomber Jeremy Irons. This is also a fine DVD package, with some very entertaining featurettes (one hosted by Reginald VelJohnson, the Twinkie-loving cop from the first movie) and great interviews. The commentary from this one is good as well, though I have yet to sit through the whole thing.
While fans of the series probably own these movies in many other formats, this is the most complete and definitave collection on the market. The extras are plentiful, but most importantly, this is the best quality prints of these movies currently available. The the first movie package could have been much better, the overall set was worth every penny spent.",1042761600,,2798,4.757201646090535

The movie that made John McTiernan (Predator) the hottest action director in Hollywood, created an explosion of inferior rip-offs and with Bruce Willis, started the long line of sweaty vested heroes while making a huge box-office success.
The movie of course, is Die Hard. The first (and best) in what would become a trilogy, Bruce Willis' first major action man role carries the distinction of being heralded as the greatest action movie ever made. It's title is debatable, but regardless, this movie is great! The action, stunts, uber-cool villains, one-liners, impressive FX and big noisy things exploding make this one of the all-time greats.
This special edition DVD is loaded with extras.
A commentary by director John McTiernan and production designer Jackson DeGovia, outtakes, deleted scenes, the whole flippin' screenplay, awesome trailers, TV spots and DVD-ROM features with script-to-screen comparison and game demos and more cool stuff for die-hard Die Hard fans (Hey, that's where the saying comes from!) See? This movie has truly influenced countless action films but has also become a statement for all things sweaty and extreme. Yipee Kay Yay!
Renny Harlin took over directing duties for Die Hard 2. While the 2nd instalment has it's moments, it's pretty much more of the same, as Bruce Willis gets back in sweaty vest mode as John McClane, with William Atherton. But this time around, the action, while impressive, isn't as cool as the first one, and the villains aren't as well written or interesting. Harlin's trademark over- the- top action is always present however, and this makes for some enjoyable action stunts and heroics.
As action sequels go, it's good enough to satisfy fans of the franchise, and despite its faults, director Harlin (Cliffhanger, Deep Blue Sea) knows how to string together some impressive action scenes. The extras are good, with a commentary from Harlin, making of's, deleted scenes, trailers, visual effects 'making of's and some other cool stuff. A good film made better by the extras.
Director John McTiernan returned to helm the 3rd part to the Die Hard trilogy, which regains much of the fun action that was missing in Renny Harlin's Die Hard 2. Bruce Willis does the sweaty-vested action hero thing again as John McClane, and to good effect. The main villain, played by Jeremy Irons, is much better than the weak bad guys in DH2, and the inclusion of Samuel L. Jackson makes it even better.

770369,5,630401743X,"The 'Die Hard' trilogy are perhaps widely known as three of the greatest action films of all time. This can be attributed to two things. Number one: It has Bruce Willis in them, who is perhaps on of the most underrated actors in Hollywood, and is seen primarily as an 'action man' rather than a serious actor. Number two: One of the greatest protagonists's of all time in John McLane.
The first film begins with John a New York cop arriving in L.A in order to spend the holiday season with his family. His wife Holly recently moved from New York to take a job opportunity and this has stressed their relationship. However when John McLane visits his wife's office during the X-mas party everything goes south. For you see a group of international terrorists headed my Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) have taken over the Nakatomi building where Holly works. By chance John is the only one not taken hostage and it becomes his mission to stop the terrorists getting away with the $600,000,000 in negotiable bearer bonds that reside within the building's safe.
The first film is perhaps the strongest as the entire movie is a game of cat and mouse. In which the viewer's mouse (McLane) not only fights for his wife, but also his life. Alan Rickman plays undoubtedly one of the most convincing 'bad guys' of all time. And the famous 'Die Hard' phrase is coined in this film; 'Yippie-kay-ay ...
'Die Hard 2: Die Harder' again finds John McLane with some bad luck when it comes to the holiday season. This time John is waiting for Holly to fly in to Washington DC's Dulles international airport. Yet again John has problems with terrorists... this time however they have taken over the airports control tower and have threatened that if a renowned drug boss is not released they will send phony messages to the planes in the holding pattern and crash them into the ground. However there is a catch, one of the planes is in fact the same Holly is travelling in and is running out of fuel. The film although not as good as the other two is still fantastic in its own right.
The third film 'Die Hard with a vengeance' is very different to the other films. This time John faces a New York summer of terror in which a maniac calling himself Simon. The film becomes more psychological when Simon subjects McLane and a man caught up in his games Zeus (Samuel L Jackson). Simon threatens to blow up different buildings in the New York area, culminating with a school. The film has a distinct separation from the others, partly due to the length between them.
The thing that gives the 'Die Hard Trilogy' alot of its charm is the fact that John McLane is a real man, not a superhero action star that has no faults. He is wrong alot of the time. Is a drunk in the third film and is always making social faux pas.
The DVD set is amazing compilation of the three films. The features are amazing and the sound and picture are perfect. This is the best way to see three of the best action films of all time. It also looks fantastic as any part of a DVD collection, and will guarantee a good time whenever watched.",1015027200,3,3087,4.484902309058614
770440,5,630401743X,"These three movies are all about New York cop, John McClane, who always turn out at the wrong place, at the wrong time. What makes an action movie good, is acting, special effects, directing, editing, and last, but certainly not least...Attitude! The Die Hard movies all have exactly that, and that's why they've turned out so good as they have!
Die Hard:
John McClane travels from New York to Los Angeles to meet with his wife, Holly Gennero. The Nakatomi company, which Holly works for, are celebrating their best year, but when 12 terrorists, led by Hans Gruber chrashes the party, things aren't as good anymore. It's now up to McClane to save the day!
Along McClanes wild action ride, he also keeps radio contact with officer Al Powell. Powell helps McClane through the tough times, and helps to keep his spirit up.
Die Hard is clearly the best movie of the series! It's the kind of movie you can watch a thousand times and never get tired of it. Alan Rickmas performance is great, but maybe a little stiff at times. Reginald Veljohnsen also does a great job playing the twinkie eating police officer, Al Powell. And of course, Bruce Willis. Die Hard was Willis' breakthrough as an actor, and his performance in Die Hard still stands as one of his best ever. He IS John McClane!
Die Hard 2
-Die Harder-
This movie was directed my Renny Harlin. A Finish director who now has become very famous in Hollywood, directing films like Cliffhanger and Deep Blue Sea. Die Hard 2 is not as good as the first one, but it's still a great action movie. It has all the right action elements, like great action, acting, special effects, and attitude!
In Die Hard 2, McClane is waiting for his wife, Holly McClane at the the airport, when McClane suddenly finds out that there are terrorists making an evil plan to take over the airport. The terrorists set up their equipment in an old church, and from there, they can controle the entire airport. The terrorists, this time led by a man named Colonel Stuart, wants a prisoned dictator called General Esperanza to safely land at the airport so that they can free him. And if the airport doesn't obey, they're gonna chrash all the planes that are sceduled to land at the airport, including McClanes wife's plane! McClane must, as you maybe already have guessed, save the day, and try to defeat the terrorists.
Die Hard 2 is a great action movie! They didn't manage to make a better movie than the first Die Hard movie as Willis said in one of the featurettes, but that was just promotional stuff. The acting William Saddler as the main villain is excellent, and Willis also does a great job once again as John McClane.
Die Hard 3
-With a Vengeance-
Die Hard 3 feels COMPLETELY different from the original Die Hard movies. It has a totally different feel to it. This time, the movie takes place in the big apple, and Hans Grubers brother, Simon Peter Gruber, is after revenge for the killing of his brother. As you may already have guessed, he wants McClane, and if he doesn't do as he says, he'll blow up bombs all over the big apple.
In Die Hard 3, McClane also has a partner with him called Zeus, played by Samuel .L. Jackson. They both deliver great performances, but nothing like Jeremy Irons as Simon! Irons was PERFECT for the role. You might remember Hans Gruber when he speaks with his american accent in the first Die Hard. Well, when Irons uses the american accent in Die Hard 3, he sounds almost exactly like his brother Hans. Many people may not notice this, but Irons must have trained alot on his performance. He's perfect as Hans Grubers brother!
Die Hard 3 is a movie that feels more like a 90's Sylvester Stallone movie, like Daylight. It has a completely different feel than the other 2 die hard movies, but it's still a great action movie. I consider Die Hard 3 to be the worst of the series. I'm not saying it's not any good, because it is, but it will never beat the original Die Hard movies. Some people may like Die Hard 3 the most, but I guess it's different strokes for different folks, right?
Extras:
All the DVD's have DTS sound, which is great, because the Die Hard movies have some of the best DTS tracks ever! The DVD's also has directors commentarys, featurettes, documentarys, trailers and Tv Spots and much more!
The cover art is also a great extra on these DVD's. They're all very nice looking. If you liked the Independence Day cover, you'll love the Die Hard covers! I'm glad they came in a Keep-case, cause I can't stand those Costum slip cases. They wear and tear too fast.

But the die hard movies take place in an office building, airport and a city with a bomber(Simon)! The three movies don't really connect with the storyline (except 3 with 1, but that isn't all that important) I've saw all the movies really a lot of time and it happened a lot of times that i just wanted to watch it again!

770560,1,630401743X,"Well, it is an ultimate collection, alright, but after thinking about it and almost purchasing it from a store, I thought better about it: I have seen these movies already - a lot of times, always on TV, never bought the VHS or the earlier DVD release, and decided not to buy, but rent it. The only interesting thing are the special features, but after you have seen it - that's just my opinion, you can make of that whatever you want - you will only put it on your shelf, dust-feed! That's not worth sixty bucks, sorry, Bruce, but sometimes even die-hards die and have to surrender to the dust.
I rated this with one star, because I recommend you not to buy it. As I said, rent & and view once. I loved this movies once and love them still - but I won't buy them, because there is a limit to how often you can watch the same movie over and over again ... and after crossing the limit it the flick only becomes a waste of time. I am sure this collection is worth 5 stars, but maybe if you think twice, the UC just isn't worth 60 dollars.

770561,4,630401743X,"Die Hard is one of the most influential action films ever made. After its release, all sorts of action films, with similar plots, began to appear. Despite all these copy-cats, Die Hard has never been equaled in greatness. Die Hard has all the qualities that make a good action blockbuster: a great villain, likeable hero, good one-liners, and of course, awesome action sequences.
Die Hard works so well because the screenplay presents many action scenes in the most logical way possible, most action film scripts don't worry themselves with trying to be logical; though they should. The Die Hard screenplay actually takes some time to develop its characters, again, this is a rarity in most action films.
Another reason Die Hard works well is because Bruce Willis doesn't play his character, John McClane, as a hero; he plays him as a normal guy.
Alan Rickman is very effective as the charming and cold villain, Hans. Reginald VelJohnson is convincing as McClane's buddy, Al Powell.
John McTiernan's direction and John F. Link and Frank J. Urioste's fast-paced editing, and the musical score make the absolute most out of the script's riveting action sequences.
The DVD for this film is great. The picture quality is pristine, free of artifacts and edge enhancements. The commentary with John McTiernan and production designer Jackson DeGovia is very informative. The outtakes are particularly amusing.
Die Hard was followed by Die Hard 2: Die Harder. Like most action films, Die Hard 2 does take some liberty in stretching the laws of logic and physics. That's all well and good for entertainment purposes; but it's a bit of a disappointment here, because, as I stated earlier in my review, one of the reasons the first film was so good is that it didn't succumb to that and when it did, it covered it up more nicely than Die Hard 2. Never the less, Die Hard 2 is still a great thrill ride.
Bruce Willis does a fine job at reprising his role from the first film. William Sadler is very effective as the villain, Colonel Stuart.
The director, Renny Harlin, does a nice job at making the most out of a weak script. The action scenes, while not as believable as those in the first, are just as riveting; thanks to him.
As with the DVD for the first film, the picture quality here is great. Renny Harlin's commentary is very entertaining, he talks continuously with virtually no pauses.
Die hard 2 was followed by Die Hard With a Vengeance (Die Hard 3). As with the second film of the trilogy, this film falls victim to action scenes that are sometimes hard to swallow. But also like the second film, it still manages to be entertaining.
Bruce Willis and and Samuel L. Jackson have a great screen chemistry. Jeremy Irons is delightfully villainous as Simon.
The direction and editing are weak. You sometimes have to question what happened because of lack of information.
The picture quality on this DVD is very good. The alternate ending presented on the second disc is quite interesting; I feel it's a better ending than the one the movie has now. The commentary with director John McTiernan, writer Jonathan Hensleigh, and former Twentieth-Century Fox President of Marketing Tom Sherrick; is quite revealing. The commentary is dominated by Hensleigh who actually comes off as being pretty smart, this is surprising when you consider some of the lousy scripts he's written. One draw back to the commentary is Tom Sherrick who really has nothing important to say; thank goodness he isn't on the track a for long periods of time.
This is a first-rate DVD set and belongs in anyone's DVD library.",997315200,5,3591,4.821717990275527
770562,5,630401743X,"Let's not kid ourselves here. Die Hard was Bruce's first movie, and not that sad excuse for a picture, Blind Date. Blind Date was a mistake, and it was only to cater to his Moonlighting fans. Die Hard, on the other hand, broke him out and made him a star. When it was released that he was the lead, people were like, ""Huh? What? Bruce Willis?"" Kind of like what happened when people found out that Michael Keaton was playing Batman. No one could believe it. But, like Keaton, Bruce ended up blowing people through the back of the theater, through the roof, and into the sky. He shocked everyone. And in Die Hard 2: Die Harder he did it again, with even more laughs, bullets, and explosions, though I missed McTiernan's deft touch with the direction. Harlin tries too hard to impress sometimes. But be that as it may, DH2 was a great flick. Die Hard With A Vengence was, in my opinion (and I know it isn't shared by many) the best of them all, because it took the Die Hard formula, and what everyone expected, and then turned it on its head. John McClane saves hundred of lives by risking his own, and here we find him divorced from the woman who owes her life to him twice over, deep in his cups, and on the crappy end of the stick as far as life goes. Here we strip him of everything to see if he can still make it. And, sure enough, he does, this time with the help of Samuel L. Jackson. All in all, Die Hard reinvented action movies, and to this day people try to replicate it.
Now, as for this special boxed set, I cannot recommend it enough. You get great commentaries, great behind the scenes documentaries, all the old trailers, hundreds of stills, and you even get to edit some scenes together. Plus, the picture and sound for all three films is top notch. You've never seen them this good in your life. Get them fast!",997228800,,1826,4.2956521739130435
770563,5,630401743X,"Okay, the Die Hard series is bread and butter for Bruce Willis (Armageddon, The Sixth Sense) and he plays it to the hilt.  I enjoyed all three movies but the first is the best, even thirteen years later.  If you don't know the plot by now Bruce Willis is thrown into a situation, Bruce Willis reacts to the situation, Bruce Willis kills the bad guys, then the credits roll.
The key to the ultimate set is the collateral material and any Die Hard fan is going to love it.  Yes, you get the film with various subtitles (or dubbed in French) but you can watch the entire film a second time with commentary by director John McTiernan (Hunt for Red October, The Thomas Crown Affair) and the art director of the film.  This is extremely interesting as it sheds a different light on many of the scenes.  For example, the Christmas party is held in a replica of Frank Lloyd Wright's Running Water house in Pennsylvania, as if the Japanese had bought it up and moved it to L.A.
The deleted scenes and goof-up reel is your standard stuff, but the production stills leads into a series of movie clips, set design diagrams and other additional footage that explains events in the movie.  For example, one still of the helicopter crashing from the top of the building in Die Hard takes you to a home-made video of the special effects guy learning to fly the remote controlled helicopter model, landing it on the building, test various explosions and camera angles, then shows the scene, first in preproduction shot on video, then the final production scene from the movie so you can see the difference between what was shot and the final look of the film.  Remarkable!
I have never been a big fan of alternate endings (did you like Clue?), but the alternate ending for Die Hard III is interesting.  It does not ruin the film, but you can see why the film seemed to change dramatically after the explosion on the boat.  Definately a must have.
Please note: The ""Ultimate Collection"" is actually three previously released DVD's combined into one box.  I already had Die Hard III but wanted the entire set.",996364800,,2090,4.579088471849866
770564,4,630401743X,"Just when I thought the `Rambo' and `Lethal Weapon' flicks were the ultimate expressions of loud, super-fast-paced, unbelievably over-the-top American action/adventure fare, I decided to take a closer look at the `Die Hard' saga, and got thrown for a loop! When it comes to ridiculously implausible moments of heroic bad-guy-slaying acrobatics, near-nuclear explosive detonations, and really cutting- yet corny- wisecracks, `Die Hard' is in rare company. For violent action-flick gore, only a few of Steven Seagal's celluloid kills & maimings and just about any shoot-em-up directed by Paul Verhoeven are on a higher visceral plane than John McClane's ballistically-challenged body count. Featuring 25% bigger exit wounds with 30% more meat flyin' outta them than your average action flick! Thanks to this revelation, the LETHAL WEAPONs and parts of the RAMBOs now seem kinda tame and a bit too feel-good in comparison.
The extra features of the DIE HARD Ultimate DVD Collection alone puts most other `fully loaded' Special Edition DVD sets to shame. Although not quite as extensive as the extras available in such Fox Five-Star Collection offerings as `The Abyss' or `Independence Day', 20CF has made quite an effort to include whatever trailers, teasers, TV spots, `making of/behind-the-scenes' specials & featurettes, cut scenes, director/designer/etc commentaries (3 different tracks on the first movie alone!), and other floor sweepings available to throw onto these discs.  Then there's the most interesting feature- the `cutting room floor', where you can re-edit key scenes of the first Die Hard, using alternate camera angles and such! This is the kind of thing the DVD format was made for!
Then there's the ultimate feature, which I consider to be the greatest feature on any DVD- the ability to skip and/or fast-forward thru the FBI/Interpol warnings and the Coming Attractions ads! Thank you 20CF for being so considerate, and please be sure to include this feature on all of your future video disc releases!
Warner Bros. take note- THIS is how the `Dirty Harry', `Lethal Weapon', & `The Fugitive/U.S. Marshals' flicks- heck, even the `Superman' & `Batman' mo-pics- SHOULD be released on the digital format! Now, hop to it!

770565,5,630401743X,"There has never been a better action movie series than the ""Die Hard"" films.  For technical expertise and complexity, these films have never and probably never will be beaten.
Each of these films is its own story adapted into a Hollywood formula picture -- Roderick Thorp's novel ""Nothing Lasts Forever"" became the original ""Die Hard,"" Walter Wager's ""58 Minutes"" became ""Die Hard II"" and Jonathan Hensleigh's original script ""Simon Says"" became ""Die Hard With a Vengeance.""  That's not an insignificant point--unlike many of today's would-be blockbusters, the story existed first! So the special effects were made to service the story, not the other way around.  Hollywood, take note.
Of course, each of these films is far from perfect.  In every instance, the authorities are as trenchantly dumb as the average Hollywood stereotype.  Can't we have *SMART* cops for once, or at least ones who are willing to listen to the hero?  Let that be a lesson--if a bloody, battered Bruce Willis comes rushing up to you on the street, do what he says.  He knows what's going on.
There are also quite a few plot problems--some things are too convenient, as in almost any thriller, and the hero makes some deductive leaps that could leave you scratching your head.  But each of these three films deliver where it counts--the thrills come early and often, and even if you're familiar with them, they're just fun to watch because they're so well done.  As for the set, you can't beat having all three of these movies in a single and quite reasonably priced package.  The bonus features are plentiful, the presentation--both audio and video--is first rate, the menus are attractive (if tedious after the fourth or fifth time).  If action is your thing, you simply can't beat this set.  This will be a favorite part of my DVD collection for a long time to come.",995500800,2,1846,4.862619808306709
770566,3,630401743X,"Let's start with the good news: Die Hard one and two - the first two movies - come in the best shape they've ever been available to own. The image quality - particularly in regard to the 16x9 enhancement - is a big improvement over the previous release, which I also own. It is now quite satisfying, considering the age of the movies. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for the third movie - Die Hard with a Vengeance. The image is very blurry and greatly lacks detail - so much that in the wide shots it is sometimes difficult to identify the characters (!). To compensate for this, Fox have added heavy artificial edge enhancement which is apparent throughout the movie and is EXTREMELY distracting. This is the worst case of of artificial sharpening I've seen in over 500 DVDs. It is so bad that in scenes where characters are photographed in front of a bright background, they appear to have a black halo around their heads! Of course this does not add any more detail or true sharpness, as becomes obvious on a cross reference to the old letterbox transfer of the previous release, which is considerably more detailed (but unfortunately suffers from heavy noise and artifacts, so it's no real alternative).  It is very annoying that the ""youngest"" of the three movies comes with the worst image quality by far.  On all three DVDs, the difference between the DD and DTS soundtracks is completely negligible. It is my guess that the DTS soundtrack was only included to justify breaking the extras out on a second DVD, which is a great promotional asset. Without it, the extras (which are not that comprehensive after all) would have well fitted on the same disc. The dynamic range, particularly of the second movie, leaves much to be desired. Especially the big explosions ask for a lot more LFE and volume than there actually is. In the third movie, the dialogues often sound muffled and are sometimes difficult to understand. Fox have missed the opportunity to remaster the sound to a modern standard while producing the DTS track. Too bad.  All things considered, the box is a nice one, an improvement, but certainly not ""The Ultimate"" as the title would have you believe. In the case of the third Die Hard movie, it is outright disappointing.",995241600,,2252,4.710659898477157

It really shows that editors have a good deal to do with the movie making process.
Another hilight is the alternate ending to Die Hard With  A Vengence.  Am I glad they didn't use it, even though the original ending wasn't too great either, it made the original ending look better.  The menus are clean and swift moving, nice and short too. There is so much added footage to all these discs that it would take you more then a day to get through them all and thats not including watching the actuall movies!

McTiernan returned to direct the third installment. Which fortunately adds the great Samuel L. Jackson to the mix.

770645,5,630401743X,"Get ready to grab your popcorn, soda, and hit the recliner for hours of incredible non-stop action. Bruce Willis stars in the role that made him a  star as NYPD cop John McClane. The original Die Hard introduces the series  and is the best of them all. It is Christmas and McClane hopes to reconcile  with his estranged wife when a German terrorist group holds the L.A.  skyscraper where his wife's office party is taking place hostage. Alan  Rickman is a suprisingly suave and intellectuall villain with his German  accent. Action and stunts are spectacular, along with Richard Edlund's  visual effects. Climaxes with McClane hurling villain Grauber out of the  building. Super exciting and Oscar nominations for sound, film editing,  sound effects editing, and visual effects. Die Hard 2 takes place again at  Christmas time at a Washington D.C. airport where McClane is waiting for  his for his wife to when terrorists take over. Very unrealistic, yet very  taut and suspenseful. Highlights include the a snowmobile chase, gunfights  with scaffolds, a fight on the wing of a moving plane, and McClane ejecting  himself from an exploding plane. A carbon copy of the original. The  darkness and orange glare of the lights are effective, and even though  there is a plot twist, the story is a mess of holes. Also boast's the  famous line, ""Yippe ki yah"" Die Hard With A Vengeance emerges as  the second best of the series, also boasting the most interesting and  intriguing plot with McClane divorced and turning into an alcoholic when  more trouble erupts. Simon Gruber, (alias Peter Krieg) the brother of the  villain in the original, comes to New York City bringing loads of  explosives and loads of trouble. While taking care of McClane, (who teams  up with a hostile Harlem storekeeper played to perfection by Samuel L.  Jackson), the police, and the FBI, he plans to steal the Federal Reserves'  cache of gold. Music tends to be a bit annoying, but the stunts and action  are amazing, especially a maniacal drive through NYC and the derailment of  a speeding subway. Other action is a shootout between McClane and Gruber  (who is in a helicopter) and the taking of the Federal Reserve bank. This  time, however, Jeremy Irons steals the show as Gruber with menace, cool,  and a cunning German accent. It is fun watching McClane and Carver  (Jackson) run around NYC to meet Gruber's demands, including the famous  Simon says/trash can scene. The profanity also reaches new levels.

Each of these films gets grander in scope. Die Hard gives you a  single building; Die Hard 2, an airport; Die Hard with a Vengeance, an  entire city. The problem is, they all essentially rehash the same plot  while never managing to top the original.
You can't go wrong with the  original -- easily a five-star movie. Action is played against  early-established characterization so you actually care about the  characters and what happens to them. Die Hard 2 relies too much on the  original for characterization; it's redundant and falls pretty flat. The  third film offers excellent rapport between Bruce Willis and Samuel L.

770741,5,630401743X,"The Die Hard Trilogy may be the best action/adventure series of the last two decades (vastly more enjoyable than the sporadic Bond films, and the self-indulgent Lethal Weapon movies), and a lion-share of the credit must  go to Bruce Willis, the wise-cracking, superhuman yet humane hero. Willis  became a superstar with the first Die Hard, and he is riveting as John  McClain, the New York cop in L.A. With the always watchable Bonnie Bedelia  as his wife, and the flashy Alan Rickman as the mercenary/entrepenour, the  film is a non-stop rollercoaster ride! Die Hard 2 lacks Rickman's charisma  as the villain, but Willis again gives a dynamite performance, and Bedelia  is even better than in the first film. Spectacular special effects abound!  Die Hard With a Vengence, the weakest of the trio, was originally intended  as Lethal Weapon 4, but was rewritten for Willis and Samuel Jackson.  Bedelia's absence hurts the third film a great deal, but Jeremy Irons (as  Rickman's equally greedy brother) is an excellent villain. Incredible  pyrotechnics highlight this film, and Willis is still a joy...And rumor has  it, there WILL be a Die Hard 4!",923356800,66,1148,5.01058201058201
