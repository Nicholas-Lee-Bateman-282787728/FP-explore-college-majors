5579025,5,B00BCPOEF4,I love this series it's a wonderful combination of Pokemon and Dragon Ball Z with a touch of Iron Chef that has kept me thoroughly entertained. I can't wait for the next installment.,1374105600,4,182,4.545454545454546
5579026,5,B00BCPOEF4,"We've been Toriko fans for a long time, and even after so much time has passed the show still inspires my boys to eat from all of the food groups. They are hoping that their muscles will keep growing like Toriko's, hahahahaha! However, I am completely satisfied with my purchase, it arrived the same day that it came out. The series remains appealing to everyone in my household, from the eldest young adult to the preschool kid, and following the show together is a blast. The fight scenes are appropriate for all ages and I don't find anything about the show offensive. I hope everyone, otaku or not, gives Toriko a chance, it's fabulous.",1369440000,5,640,4.62280701754386
5579027,5,B00BCPOEF4,This show is nothing but imaginative and I enjoy that. In these episodes you get a few mini arcs and find out the future of Toriko and Komatsu's relationship. What I really enjoyed about this one is that they had a contest so after you view the show they announce the winners during the Gourmet News. The contest was drawings from children that were brought to life in the show. I find it amazing how they have taken children's drawings and bring them to fully animated scenes in there show.,1368057600,2,491,4.466666666666667

8566333,5,B00BCPOEF4,"This is a really good anime and it was a surprise hit for me.  I saw this at FYE in the mall for like $60 i think, and it looked interesting.  I got it much cheaper on amazon and I am really enjoying it so far.  It's funny, lighthearted and still packed full of action. I wish there was more of this show!",1495756800,,305,3.8095238095238093
8566334,3,B00BCPOEF4,"Why do they keep rehashing the the same episodes released 4 years ago instead of dubbing new episodes, I mean seriously?!",1485475200,2,121,4.809523809523809

8566340,5,B00BCPOEF4,they licensed and released the first 50 episodes on dvd in 4 parts and then that's it.  i'm guessing most are like me and liked to loved this guilty pleasure of a show and want MOAR!!!  part 4 came out in nearly a year ago.  did the dvd's not sell as well as funimation hoped?  i can't see any other explanation for them not getting the rest of the series and putting them out.  i need more episodes and now must resort to other avenues to get them.,1391472000,4,449,4.056818181818182
