8227117,3,B000X7SC1Y,"""The Adventures of Tartu"" (aka ""Sabotage Agent"") is a 1943 black and white war/spy drama starring Robert Donat as a British Captain who masquerades as a member of the fascist Romanian  Iron Guard to try to steal the formula for a new Nazi poison gas program.

FWIW - The Romanian Iron Guard was a far-right, fascist, Orthodox Christian political movement started in 1927 consisting of the wealthiest part of the country. They were anti-Jewish and anti-Communist and were sympathetic with the Nazi movement.

Robert Donat (1905-58) is not well remembered today, but he was a major presence in such films as ""The 39 Steps"" (1935), ""The Citadel"" (1938) and ""Goodbye Mr. Chips"" (1939) for which he won the Oscar. He previously played in a spy in ""Knight without Armour."" Donat is delightful as he assumes the identity of the Romanian skirt chaser. He shows quite a bit of versatility that is otherwise not showcased in his other films.

A very young Glynnis Johns (1925) plays a worker in a munitions plant. She was nominated for an Oscar for ""The Sundowners"" (1960), a Golden Globe for ""The Chapman Report"" (1962), and won a Tony for ""A Little Night Music"" (1973). She's probably best known for her role as the mother in ""Mary Poppins"" (1954).

Perky Valerie Hobson (1917-98) was popular in the 30s with films like ""Clouds Over Europe"" (1939), ""Werewolf of London"" (1935), and ""Bride of Frankenstein"" (1935). In the 50s she married John Profumo and was his wife during the Christine Keeler scandal. Hobson plays a resistance fighter.

The NY Times called it a ""melodrama with a vengeance"" but complained that it ""unabashedly places a strain on the audience's credulity"" and ""the script is so full of holes it could be used for a sieve."" Nonetheless they concluded ""for all its excesses, it still packs a fair load of excitement.""

1943 was an OK year in films - The top grossing films included ""This is the Army"", ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"", ""Song of Bernadette"", ""Coney Island"", and ""Stage Door Canteen"". Other notables included ""The Ox Bow Incident"". The big Oscar winner was ""Going My Way"", and other winners included ""Gaslight"" and ""None But the Lonely Heart""

War films were particularly popular in 1943 - ""Action in the North Atlantic"" with Bogart and Raymond Massey, ""Air Force"" with John Garfield, ""Bataan"" with Robert Taylor and Lloyd Nolan, ""Bombadier"" with Pat O'Brien and Randolph Scott, ""Corvette K-255"" with Randolph Scott, ""Five Graves to Cairo"" with Franchet Tone and Anne Baxter"", ""Hangmen Also Die"" with Brian Donlevy and Walter Brennan, and ""Hitler's Children.""

Among the World War 2 spy films are ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" (1934), ""The 39 Steps"" (1937), ""The Lady Vanishes"" (1938), ""Espionage Agent"" (1939), ""Foreign Correspondent"" (1940),  ""To be or Not to Be"" (1942), ""Above Suspicion"" (1943), ""Watch on the Rhine"" (1943), ""Northern Pursuit"" (1943),  ""Cloak and Dagger"" (1946), and ""13 Rue Madeline"" (1947).

Bottom line - an average spy film from the WW 2 period.",1334016000,4,2985,4.948
8227118,1,B000X7SC1Y,"<Sigh> As I said in a review of another ""public domain"" DVD issue of this film...DON'T GO NEAR IT!

THIS particular DVD contained a film called ""That Brennan Girl."" And it was a lousy-looking, lousy-sounding print into the bargain, not that I care since the film I was TRYING to purchase was ""The Adventures of Tartu,"" or ""Sabotage Agent."" U.S. title was ""Tartu"" so I'm not sure where Reel Classic Films got ""Sabotage Agent."" However, it doesn't matter since I'd be willing to bet their print of ""Tartu""--if they have it--is probably no better than the print of ""That Brennan Girl,"" whoever she was! :) Mona Freeman, I think.

TCM....Robert Osborne, somebody?...anybody?...Bueller? If you're reading this, please re-run ""The Adventures of Tartu"" so I can get a decent copy of it!! Thanks.

And thanks, Amazon, for handling everything with your usual excellent, responsive customer service crediting my account as soon as you received the return. You guys are the best.",1197244800,12,968,5.0375
