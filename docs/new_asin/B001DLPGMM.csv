8294001,4,B001DLPGMM,Great for kids and adults for brushing up on algebra. Teaches step by step easy ways to work out algebra problems.. The audio is pretty bad but is a great learning video. I'd definitely recommend this.,1461369600,,201,4.611111111111111

8294003,2,B001DLPGMM,"Wow, take math and make it boring, what a concept!  Why put a flashy cover on a video that is nothing more than a man standing in front of a white board giving instruction at the most basic level?  I am giving this 2 stars only because the concepts are accurate, and if someone were desperate, they could actually learn from this, but with so many other resources available, I am sorry I wasted my money.  As a math teacher, I was hoping for something to reinforce concepts, not put me to sleep or moaning in boredom.",1426723200,,517,4.309278350515464
