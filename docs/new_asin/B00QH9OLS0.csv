This is the only reason I give it one star. It came well-packaged, and was in pristine condition when it arrived. I just cant watch it now. So sad!",1533254400,,323,4.0625

8691272,4,B00QH9OLS0,"Came across this while looking for Region Free 3D titles not released in the US.

This disc comes region-free (will work in US players). I didn't notice a 2D option on the menu, but I assume it plays in 2D on a non-3D TV/Player. This is real ""3D"" and not the red/blue glasses type.

The disc runs about an hour and 20 minutes, divided into 12 segments.

The content seems to be filmed exclusively for the disc. Most is set against a solid black backdrop with a stage in front (not the most interesting) - the part that makes it interesting are the effects used (fog, lighting, projection mapping, reflection), but there are also some CG effects and camera techniques to make it look a little too artsy (routines where the camera angle is is focused only on the shoes/feet for the entire length, and that image duplicated on screen several times). It seems like they tried a little too hard to make parts artsy and it just came off as annoying/boring.

The 3D is decent. It's not terribly impressive since most of the girls are on the same plane without much separation (in front or behind) to give depth. There are angles where it works better, but never saw anything impressive with the 3D.
Most of the 3D seems to be depth (going further into the TV) opposed to pop out (coming towards you) with a few exceptions. Didn't notice ghosting.

A lot of the content seems repetitive (""Didn't I already see this 5 minutes ago??""), is split up with interviews with someone between sets, and seems to be a little long (even at 80 minutes)

The disc is dubbed into Russian and has no english subtitles. I imagine I'm not missing much with the dialog between sets, but it's a bit annoying as it was clearly in another language (heard in the background) and has a russian dub playing over it).

In the end, it had some neat moments. The fog, lighting and reflections effects were good, the 3D was neat at times, but it just seemed a little too long and a little underwhelming with the 3D. The disc was cheap enough to not be disappointed in it -- another region free option is available with an english dub (for about 10 bucks more), but it honestly wouldn't have been worth the extra money for it.",1437264000,2,2188,4.468671679197995

8691274,4,B00QH9OLS0,"This is an odd DVD. I bought it because it was in 3D and there are so few movies (that aren't animated) in that format.  Christian Louboutin, the guy who made the movie, introduces each segment, and after the first couple of parts I began to think ""Who needs this guy anyway?"" All he does it talk while birdcages with shoes float around in the background. I guess if I spoke French (or Dutch) it would make more sense.

Anyway for the part everyone is really interested in, the naked girls. The 3D HD effect is wonderful- you feel as if you are sitting in the front row of a private showing.  There are several good segments, but there are two where you see nothing but feet in heels. Okay, whatever floats your boat.

There are some really good things. The ""Final Fantasy,"" which is kind of a bondage thing, really shows the physical ability of the girl (billed as ""Pshyko Tico"") who performs it. It is also a well planned and intricate routine.

In the segment ""Purple underground"" the girls shed their Louise Brooks wigs and we see how some of them really look.

All in all, it's not a waste of time, but if you're not going to see it in 3D, then think about just downloading it from You Tube- it's a heck of lot cheaper.",1423612800,2,1224,4.323144104803493
8691275,3,B00QH9OLS0,"In 2012, a famous fashion designer Christian Louboutin was invited to create a show for a Paris cabaret Crazy Horse. Feu: Crazy Horse Paris feature the musical pieces of the collaboration that was specially performed before the camera, with Louboutin appearing as a sort of guide of the whole show.

So Feu (meaning fire) is more like a visual record of dancing than a documentary, just like Wim Wenders Pina does, which beautifully captured the dance of Pina Bauschs dance company. In both films, dancers talk before the camera. (And both films were shot in 3D.) The difference is that in Feu: Crazy Horse Paris dancers are all bare-breasted females.

The dancing footage  numbers like God Save Our Bareskin (regular opening act featuring Royal Horse Guards played by half-naked dancers), Voodoo Legmania Upside Down etc.  are all unique and beautifully choreographed. Some look more like leg-dancing. After all, this is guest-created by Christian Louboutin best known for his designs for shoes.

But I wasn't impressed with the film itself very much partly because I found the editing a bit too fast. I thought the camera should have shown more extended sequences. Also, what Louboutin and the dancers say before the camera is not very interesting. Feu: Crazy Horse Paris is a visually intriguing documentary, but don't expect beyond that.",1390262400,,1341,5.105022831050229
