8687579,4,B00PCSVL4O,"Action packed and spook fun thrills!  I love finding unknown gems like these here on Amazon.  The spirit of independent film-making is alive and well in them and if you approach it from this perspective and not some Hollywood film snob, you'll enjoy all the shenanigans Karl, Pauline and the Burglar get into in this motion picture.  Definitely worth the entertainment value of a little sexy-action fun!  Check it out - communication is key - in A KILLER CONVERSATION!",1425600000,,468,4.886075949367089
8687580,5,B00PCSVL4O,"The title of the film is exactly what it says, a killer having a conversation! From beginning to end this movie keeps you intrigued. It's about a bloke called Karl who answers his door to a burglar who then ties him up ... then throw into the mix an ex-girlfriend who has just come by to reconcile with Karl and just watch the fireworks happen.
This film is very funny and that's down to the witty dialogue written by Michael Haberfelner. There are countless gems in the dialogue, for instance the burglar asks Karl if he can cut the rope he has borrowed to tie him up and Karl responds with ""No! If you wanted to cut the rope you should have brought your own rope!"" I was laughing out loud throughout the movie. The film is not too long and the pace of the dialogue is perfect.
This was a low budget movie but the quality of the film and directing was high standard. I think with this type of movie the most important thing is to get the casting right. Ryan Hunter, Rudy Barrow and Melanie Denholme were cast perfectly in their roles. All three of them gave outstanding performances! Ryan was so frustrating as the pessimistic Karl that at times as a viewer I just wanted to slap him! Pauline the ex girlfriend was fantastically played by Mel, she was so self centered that no matter what chances arose to save her ex, she just carried on talking about herself. Rudy as the burglar was a perfect choice, his comic timing was spot on and the tone of his voice brought the character to life!
Overall I would recommend this movie to anyone, it's very witty and has a good story, it just goes to show you don't need a big budget and special effects and gore to make a good movie!",1424736000,,1676,4.3238095238095235
8687581,2,B00PCSVL4O,"A poorly dubbed burglar (Rudy Barrow) enters the flat of Karl (Ryan Hunter), knocks him out, ties him and threatens to kill him. The burglar is polite and Karl is somewhat polite considering his situation. After 10 minutes or so of conversation that starts to go stale, Pauline (Melanie Denholme) an ex-girlfriend comes over too apologize. She enters the conversation for nearly the rest of the film as we have a black comedy where the burglar acts as a couples' counselor between a shallow girl and pessimist who is about to be killed.

First off the picture framing is bad. Heads are cut off and off center for much of the film. Sometimes the camera even jerks. The sound was terrible as you can hear where it is dubbed. Apparently they couldn't get the proper sound they needed from a guy wearing a mask so they horribly dubbed the voice. Notice the quiet as he roots through her purse...which I am sure the director will say was by design.

The main problem with the feature is that the cute conversation about religion, philosophy and a wreaked car was absolutely meaningless and went nowhere. It couldn't carry the film which was about 30 minutes too long or needed another characters to pop in. This could have been done since Pauline was texting someone, a girlfriend who would love to meet a burglar perhaps.

Low budget film and it shows.

Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Melanie Denholme)",1424476800,,1395,4.704918032786885
8687582,3,B00PCSVL4O,"Well, This film really is like nothing we have seen. (period)

The film starts off so menacing, And then it goes into a Black Comedy of Talking Heads.

It stars : Melanie Denholme, She of the Chemical Burn studios many,many projects. Melanie has taken on the crown of British Scream Queen #1. She does show a little of the assets that built her reputation.

So,Film starts offer a Crazy train,Brings in a ex-girlfriend who is the most evil in the room,Talks out drugging lovers & not caring Who Dies & Who Lives ?

The ending was amazing,truly amazing.",1423008000,2,552,4.6020408163265305
