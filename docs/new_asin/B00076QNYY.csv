8045096,5,B00076QNYY,"I purchased this for use in my intro culinary classes. It does have useful information for me and I think for the cook at home. I like the interactive aspects of this dvd. If you are looking for visual prompts and assists as you improve your basic cooking skills, this would probably be a worthwhile purchase for you.",1347408000,,317,4.482758620689655
8045097,5,B00076QNYY,This video is great for someone with NO foundation in cooking...like me.  It gives you techniques more so than recipes.  Most cooking dvds are recipe based.  This DVD gives you the basics of cooking (Which you need before you can take on recipes).  If you are a total novice I recommend this dvd.,1281484800,,296,4.528301886792453
8045098,5,B00076QNYY,"It worked VERY WELL for me and it is worth the money!!!

If you are a person who wants to learn the BASICS in cooking in a simple but effective way, this DVD/CD-ROM package is great!  The audio is clean and crispy.  The video is clear.  The content is structured by chapters: Food Preparation (including knives skills) to prep fish, meat, fowl, and vegetables, In the Oven, On the Stove, On the Grill, In the Pantry, In the Store, and a Recipe File.  The content is extensive and it goes from cutting vegetables (in the many different forms that chefs learn) to more complex but easy to make meals. There is a lot of information on every subject; one cannot learn it all just by watching it once or in just one day.  The recipes are easy and delicious!  The instructions are easy to follow and the ingredients are not hard to find.  The Chefs explain every step clearly, there are written instructions as well, and lots of videos (in real time cooking) to guide you!  It is all about learning the skills, techniques, and safety!  Deep frying, saut secrets, pan frying, fine sauces, includes a glossary list, and etc.  I bought it for myself and bought several of them for my friends and they loved it!!!",1148860800,6,1203,4.497695852534562
8045099,2,B00076QNYY,"In reading the text, when you see the defined word for ""sense of taste"" spelled ""pallet"" and the embryo of a chicken spelled ""yoke"" you know that this is a work that's going to need a lot of polishing. This DVD and several good cookbooks may help you in learning to cook. It is, however, encouraging to see 'chefs' with average knife skills and clips that haven't been cleaned up for the Food Network. Amateurish and sorely lacking in content. Two stars for brave attempt.",1123977600,7,472,4.564705882352941
