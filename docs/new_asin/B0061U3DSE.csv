8490968,5,B0061U3DSE,"Having done training in EMDR some time ago, I found it invaluable to visualize Dr. Parnell at work while appreciating the rationale for her approach to clients.  The discussion and feedback provided are rich sources of clarification for why EMDR therapists do what they do the way they do it.  The visual presentation provides a template for practice, one style at least, that can be modelled and possibly later modified by the practitioner as he/she refines their own approach and style while still staying within the EMDR protocol model. Being a visual learner, the DVDs are a rich addition to the material Dr. Parnell and others have written about EMDR practice.",1424131200,4,665,4.981981981981982
8490969,4,B0061U3DSE,"It was really useful and helpful to see Dr Parnell in action, with some insightful and moving demonstrations, however, the quality of the DVD's partiuclarly the sound needs to be improved.",1368489600,6,188,5.096774193548387
8490970,5,B0061U3DSE,"After having read her books, I bought these DVD sets. I was a bit reluctantly considering its cost but now after having seen it, I am glad that I purchase it. It is well worth the money especially if you're passionate about EMDR and working with trauma patients.",1363478400,9,262,4.479166666666667
8490971,5,B0061U3DSE,"I've been using EMDR in my private practice effectively for 2 years but had not been able to settle in as comfortably and confidently with the protocol as I would have liked. I have read many excellent EMDR books, which certainly helped, but like many people I am a visual learner; as I watched Dr. Parnell demonstrate the protocol in her smooth,stream-lined, compassionate, and straight-forward manner I finally experienced the ""click"" that has made everything suddenly feel naturally flowing and (finally) exceedingly clear!  My concern about ""Am I doing this right?"" transformed into being able to trust the client and focus more deeply, more relaxed, and more confidently on the integration of the protocol with their needs and their unique processing.  Thank you so much to all the trainees who generously allowed themselves to be taped; the stories and healing journeys recorded here are profoundly moving and inspiring. This DVD series touched my heart as well as my mind and literally made me say ""Aha!"" out loud many times! I highly recommend these DVDs as one of the best training tools out there.",1340236800,16,1107,5.043715846994536
