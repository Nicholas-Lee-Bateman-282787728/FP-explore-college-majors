8695842,5,B00RU4B6V6,I loved every moment of this documentary. My only complaint is that I wish it had more content but that's hardly a complaint rather a compliment. The story line is captivating and it kept me wondering what was going to happen at the end of this man's journey and whether he and his wife would reconcile their changing world-views. This would be a great movie for a women's or a men's club at the synagogue or just to recommend for friends who have an interest in Kabbalah.,1428796800,2,472,4.436781609195402
8695843,4,B00RU4B6V6,"""Kaballah Me"" is an autobiographical film about coming to religion and spirituality in mid-life.  Steven Bram, 49, is a director of sports documentaries.  A non-practicing Jew, Bram found that something was missing in his life and gradually began to explore Kabbalism and traditional Judaism. Bram produced and co-directed and co-wrote this film documentary of his search.

The Kaballah is a broad term covering Jewish mystical teachings There are several Kabbalistic texts, centering on the Zohar which was published in 13th Century Spain.  Kabbalists often attribute authorship of the book to an early Talmudic scholar, Shimon bar Yohchai. Regardless of the accuracy of this imputed authorship, Kabbalistic teachings  have indisputably early roots in Judaism.

Bram's motivation in the film is not entirely clear.  He begins weekly study with a rabbi and gradually branches out to explore various Kabbalistic teachers. These teachers include relatives who have remained within traditional Judaism, rabbis and spiritual teachers, the Kaballah Center, which aims to bring Kaballah to a broad population that includes non-Jews, the Chabad movement, and more.  A key moment of Bram's search is a trip to Israel where he engages with serious practitioners and teachers of Jewish mysticism. As the film points out, Judaism is not of one view in its understanding of Kaballah.  Many practicing Jews reject it. Others believe it should only be studied by a person who has mastered other non-mystical Jewish texts and who is committed to a Jewishly observant life. Bram develops an increasing commitment to Judaism and Kabbalism. His commitment appears to produce a stress on his marriage.  His wife, a non-observant Jew who practices Yoga and Buddhist meditation, is uncomfortable with her husband's turn towards Jewish Orthodoxy.

The film has an interesting premise and some good moments. It is not fully convincing because the teachings of Kabbalism are not presented at anything beyond a superficial level and then mostly by way of short sound-bites. The view doesn't get a good sense either  of what Kabbalah is about or of Bram's growing attraction. On the whole, the movie focuses to its detriment more on Bram than on Kabbalistic teachings.  The movie didn't convince me that Bram had found a new path in life.  The issue is not with his sincerity.  Instead the movie doesn't develop the teachings well, and Bram himself appears visibly uncomfortable and out of place in the film's footage showing him in the middle of large religious gatherings of Orthodox Jews.

I have been interested in Kabbalism at various times in my life as well as the Buddhist spirituality that Bram's wife practices. It  was valuable to be reminded through this film of both the Kabbalah and  about Buddhist meditation. I thought this film, however well-intentioned, only skimmed the surface. The distributor of this film, First Run Features, kindly provided me with a copy for review.
