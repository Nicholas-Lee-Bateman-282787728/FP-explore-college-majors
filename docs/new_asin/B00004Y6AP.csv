7926839,5,B00004Y6AP,"Yes, this is classified as a 'chick flick.'  But it is wonderful!  Diane Keaton, Carol Kane, and Kathryn Grody do a wonderful job as the 'Lemon Sisters', three best friends who may fight every now and then, but are always there for one another.  This movie combines comedy and drama together, thus making it wonderful.  Hearing Diane Keaton sing was another high point of the movie!  If you have two best friends, watch this movie.  It is simply wonderful.  Even if you don't, watch the movie anyway.  You won't regret it.",1061337600,5,522,4.65934065934066
7926840,5,B00004Y6AP,"One of the main reasons that I bought ""The Lemon Sisters"" was because Diane Keaton was one of the stars.  She happens to be my favorite actress, so I decided to get the movie.  I'm very glad I did!  It is so sweet and touching.  Diane Keaton, Carol Kane, and Kathryn Grody all give wonderful performances as three women who have been friends since they were little.  One thing I really loved about this movie were the flashbacks and how they were in black and white, so it was easy to tell when they would be going into a flashback.
The movie also has quite a few comedic points, like when Franki (Kane) attempts to start a singing career away from Eloise (Keaton) and Nola (Grody).  But the three just aren't the same when they are apart.  I thought that the way they came up with the name of their group was very interesting and cute.  And no matter what happened, they remained friends, through thick and thin.  Why this movie was not as acclaimed as it should have been, I do not know.  But what I do know is that it is wonderful and a movie for friends to watch together.",1060992000,7,1076,4.282178217821782
