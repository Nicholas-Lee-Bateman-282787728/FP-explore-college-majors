The special effects were good (for 1914) The only thing i didn't like is the WEIRD music and the naration. Whats wrong with panio or organ music?",1021420800,2,309,4.081967213114754
1421408,5,B00005B7BE,"I found this...and bought it, and I didn't regret it! I loved it. I raised myself on Baum's Oz stories, and this is one that he made himself. This movie is an original story that Baum wrote using his Oz characters, and later, story plots from this movie were used in his book, ""The Scarecrow of Oz"" - most notably the story of Princess Gloria and Pon, the Gardener's son and King Krewl. Dorothy features prominently in the story, though we're not told how she gets to Oz. Mombie is the witch, instead of Blinkie in the book. Other Oz characters that appear are Button Bright, the Tin Woodman, the Cowardly Lion, the Wizard, the Sawhorse, a Winged Monkey, and (I think) Hank the Mule. The music is really ""Ozzy,"" and I really enjoyed it. It's a silent film, but the narration cards are read by an actress who does a pretty good job. The special effects are pretty impressive for its time. The is a scene reminiscent of ""The Wizard of Oz"" book, where the Scarecrow, pushing a raft, gets stuck on the pole. He slides down underwater, and the underwater affects surprised me for such an old film. There are fish swimming around, and even a mermaid makes an appearance. I also liked they way they showed Princess Gloria getting her heart frozen by Mombie and her fellow witches that she summons. At one point, they even take off flying on their brooms, which looked really awesome!
The costumes and makeup are also exellent. Dorothy wears the same dress and bow style that she does in John R. Neill's illustrations. The Tin Woodman's costume is a little funky, but is ok. I was impressed with how well the Scarecrow's makeup and clothes hold up in water. Mombie looks like The Witch of the West and Neill's Blinkie in the book. Princess Gloria is beautiful and looks like a wistful Fairy princess. The animal costumes were very kewl. I especially like Hank the Mule's costume, and enjoyed seeing him fight off Mombie. There's also other really nice pices of detail, like the little ""Oz"" pieces on the Sawhorse's bridle, which he has in Neill's illustrations.
There were also some very funny parts, like the Scarecrow discovering water and playing in a stream, to the dismay of Dorothy and Button Bright. They even had the Wall of Water, which was interestingly done with camera angles.
There is also a Little Rascals short on the disk about Alfalfa fighting a masked wrestler that's funny as well. But if you're looking for Baum's Oz, then this is for you.",999993600,38,2451,4.610983981693364

Often, transfers are not of the highest quality. The movies themselves are unrestored and rarely pristine (but still watchable), extras are non-existent and inclusion of artwork or liner notes varies by manufacturer.

In 1914, L. Frank Baum, author of 15 ""Wizard of Oz"" books, started his own film company. Baum scripted and oversaw production on all the Oz movies. Life-size puppets were used for some characters, while actors often portrayed various roles from film to film. Although primitive-looking to modern eyes, this nearly 100 year old film is really how the author wanted his classic children's books to appear on theater screens.

(6.0) His Majesty, The Scarecrow Of Oz (silent-1914) - Violet MacMillan/Frank Moore/Pierre Couderc/Fred Woodward/Raymond Russell",1254355200,2,1373,6.02051282051282
1421410,3,B00005B7BE,"Being the third and (in my opinion, thankfully) last movie by the Oz Film Manufacturing Company.
Despite the title, it is based on ""Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" book with additions from ""Road"" and maybe ""Land"", before L. Frank Baum turned it into its own adventure the following year - with new characters (and an improvement!).  Although based on the First Oz book, this is the 3rd movie by the Oz Film Manufacturing Company and has scenarios not in continuity with the earlier movies of Patchwork Girl and Magic Cloak.
King Krewl is forcing his daughter Princess Gloria to marry Googly-Goo and she refuses, before meeting and falling in love with Pon, the Gardener's boy.  King Krewl is not happy about this and, after discoverying their second get-together, takes action.  Meanwhile, as two men (Munchkin farmers?) make a Scarecrow, Dorothy is sadly lost in Oz and captured by Mombi the Witch (modelled after Denslow's original Wicked Witch of the West).  A fairy (dressed up as an American indian) and Cornfield Girls dance and bring Scarecrow to life.  Mombi orders Dorothy to do slavery before King Krewl arrives with guards and Gloria.  Mombi agrees to freeze Gloria's heart and Dorothy and Pon watch as she summons 3 other witches to help in the freezing of Gloria's heart.  Dorothy and Pon are chased by the Witches until a mule comes along (Nikkodemus from 'Magic Cloak'?) and fights Mombi.  Gloria feels no love for Pon and they, along with Dorothy, meet and free Scarecrow from his pole, who is enchanted by Gloria's beauty.  The friends make a journey through the countryside of Oz, but Mombi scatters Scarecrow's straw and fights the Mule again while Pon and Dorothy restore Scarecrow.  They meet Button-Bright, have  a meal by the lake (where Scarecrow stupidly plays in like a baby child) and oil the Tin Woodman near his Tin Castle.  He temporarily saves them from Mombi (who, literally, loses her head - a very funny scene!) who transforms Pon into a kangaroo!  The Tin Woodman, enchanted by Gloria proposes that they overthrow King Krewl and restore Gloria's heart.  They escape from Mombi by using a raft to cross a river where they go over the Wall of Water (Scarecrow actually goes underwater and sees a mermaid) and a gaint crow (from an earlier Oz film) saves Scarecrow from being stuck on the pole in the river's center.  On land, they encounter a cow (Stage's Imogene?) and are assisted by the Wizard of Oz.  Lion has a small fight with the Zoop (from ""Patchwork Girl"", useless!!) and Wizard uses his magic over Mombi while the friends cross ANOTHER River (this time we actually see footage of them getting on the raft).  They meet the Lion and Gloria is taken by King Krewl's guards.  The friends storm the castle (oddly, Gloria helps, despite frozen heart) and Scarecrow is crowned King - unfortunately, Lion is ignored!  In the Throne Room, Wizard has Mombi & witches restore Gloria's heart and he returns Pon to his form.
This movie goes for just under an hour, with many (or all) of the scenes in the middle with long, usually boring and unnecessary additions, with the last few minutes being a rushed resolution.  There are good costumes and sets, but the picture quality is unrestored, with many light spots, a few obvious scratches, misty-like gaps and, worst of all, inconsistent editing: resulting in some scenes out of order (but not too much), most notably the 2  scenes of the river would have been better put together instead of apart, although the first river scene may most likely have missing footage.
I have this film on Both DVDs: on its own and MGM's 3-dsk Collectors Edition, with both similarities and differences.
Scarecrow DVD:  A woman narrates the on-screen writing (being a silent film) and the music could be described as 'bubbly', the same as which is included on the 1925 (solo) DVD.  The Scene Selection is 6 chapters and includes a ""Little Rascals"" bonus (don't like the braun episode at all) and a movie trvia quiz.
MGM 3-dsk DVD:  Slightly improved, includes extra seconds with the Original Film's (company) introduction, no narration and a different soundtrack, but is all-one (long) scene, no chapters.  Would've been better had it also had a restored picture quality just like Chadwick's 1925 Wizard 'adaptation' on the same disk.",1197849600,,4288,4.857142857142857
1421411,2,B00005B7BE,"I don't know alot about old movies, especially not silent film, or anything before the 40's, so maybe my opinion is that of a dummy. Most of the shots were very long, repetitive, and boring. It was rare for a scene to have much editing at all, it was mostly a single shot showing frantic action that doesn't tell much of a story at all. The woman who reads the text screens is obnoxious. In my opinion, I'd rather read it myself than have it read to me. I don't like that voice there. As some of the other reviewers have said, some of the effects and costuming worked very well. Very impressive for the time. The direction, action, and pacing/storytelling just didn't seem to work well at all for me. Very slow. I fell asleep several times and had to rewind. If you want a good silent film, check out Steamboat Bill, Jr. Excellent.",1122940800,2,831,4.367741935483871
1421412,3,B00005B7BE,"I have been an Oz fan all of my life and usually jump at the opportunity to add something to my Oz collection. So it was that I was glad to find this piece. Watching it, however, was not all I had hoped for.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was written and directed by L. Frank Baum, the author of ""The Wizard of Oz"" as well as the later sequel, ""The Scarecrow of Oz"". As such, I expected it to be a very faithful adaptation of the book. In this, I was surpised by two things. The first was that the story was much less like the book that I would have expected from the book's author. The second is how good a job was done in a film dating from 1914.

The basic story is that of the book. Princess Gloria has her heart frozen by an evil witch to prevent her from marrying a commoner. The Oz characters come to her rescue. The way this comes about, however, deviates significantly from the book and several characters are changed or are missing alltogether. This was a dissapointment to me but may not be to others.

The state of the art for motion pictures was not all that developed in 1914. With that in mind, this movie does achieve some remarkable things. The ""trick"" are easy to identify but they do not detract from the progession of the story itself. These special effects include an underwater scene with the scarecrow, the actual freezing of the princess's heart and the decaptitation of the evil witch. They do blend well with the story. There is none of the ""how did they do that"" feeling but there is a ""I'm surpriised they managed that"" feeling to replace it.

In appearance, it seems like Oz is located in the American plains of the midwest. This is particularly apparent when the scarecrow is seen in his cornfield with ""Indians"" dancing around him. So too do the river scenes seem more like a bit of Americana than the fantasy land of Oz. So too do the witches seem to come from Salem as opposed to the fairy land. This is another instance of something that distracted me but may not affect anyone else.

Staple Oz characters making an appearance include Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, the Cowardly Lion, the Wizard, the wooden Sawhorse, Old Mombi, Button Bright (as a girl instead of a boy!) as well as those specific to this story line like Gloria, Pon, King Krewl and Googly Goo. Notably absent are Trot, Captain Bill and Betsy Bobbin. It is possible that Hank the mule makes an appearance but I don't know if that is intentional or a coincidence and the character is not named.

This film is well worth buying for serious Oz fanatics. It does provide a diverting hour of entertainment and follows the basics of the story. So too might it appeal to silent movie fans who like silent movies for their own sake. The Little Rascals short is a nice additional touch as well.",1114819200,3,2810,4.415057915057915
1421413,4,B00005B7BE,"An enjoyable silent film which can be found for as little as $2 (5 for $10 at Price Chopper stores in NY). Effects are surprisingly good, particularly costumes and makeup, and the underwater scene as mentioned (where Scarecrow fights a swordfish and meets a mermaid). Other enjoyable scenes include Scarecrow dancing with a giant Crow and the violent (if temporary) dispatching of Mombi by the Tin Woodsman. I'll disagree with some reviewers and say I liked the music...it's piano tracks mostly, with some guitar parts and percussion. Modern but fits with the film.

Apparently three are at least 2 other Oz films from the same era and with many of the same actors, those titles being ""The Patchwork Girl of Oz"" and ""The Magic Cloak of Oz"". Attention Brentwood, can you find some good prints and release those?",1108252800,2,810,4.869565217391305
1421414,5,B00005B7BE,This is by far an interesting movie. I am a huge fan of Baum and the Wizard of Oz movie and my boyfriend bought me this DVD for Christmas one year. It is a little weird but I love it because Baum directed it.,1093046400,,208,3.75
1421415,4,B00005B7BE,"This is a fun 1914 version of an 'Oz' book, directed by L. Frank Baum himself.  There are some great special FX, (the 'freezing heart' is fantastic!), and the acting is fairly good as well.  The music and narration on this edition, as it is on the 1925 version of 'Wizard Of Oz', is redone and not very well.  However, for the price, this film is worth having!  Great fun for children but requires an attention span, because it's not as 'flash-bang-zippo!' as modern films, because of no sound effects.",1047513600,13,502,4.544444444444444
7936997,4,B00005B7BE,"Interesting, mostly entertaining curio -- the only Oz story directed by the author of the books (Frank Baum) himself.

Even at 58 minutes it feels a bit long, and theres an air of amateurism about it that is both its charm and its limitation.  Dorothy isn't the center here, the story centers on a power struggle between the Scarecrow and the wicked King Krewl.  One really fun touch are the animals, all played by human in costumes.

One of those films I'm glad I saw for it's historic value, but don't feel Id need to see again.  More a rental than a purchase.

The special affects are surprisingly good for the era it was filmed - they did things that were pioneering like one scene where the villian's head if chopped off and her ""headless"" body feels around till she finds and replaces her head.
