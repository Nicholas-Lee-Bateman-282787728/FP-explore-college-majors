8522873,1,B007XF0W12,"There is nothing ""guided"" about this at all. It is very short snippets (no longer than about a minute) that doesn't provide an ounce of guidance for meditation. If you just want to have a quick look at some scenery while you sit there for less than a minute, then go ahead an purchase this. If you are looking for something that will allow you to focus and meditate long enough to gain something from it, then look somewhere else.",1388966400,3,430,4.3875
8522874,5,B007XF0W12,I purchased this DVD and I've been extremely pleased with it.  It is very calming and relaxes me throughout my busy and hectic work week.  The affirmations are fantastic and accompanying nature video is very stunning and peaceful.  Highly recommended.,1351123200,,251,5.225
8522875,5,B007XF0W12,"This DVD is just what my soul needs - all these wonderful guided affirmations with a beautiful background of videos of nature.  When you live in a city, it's hard to get that back to nature feeling.  This DVD is perfect.  The words, the music, the nature images give me a sense of peace that I really need.  The affirmations are great reminders to tune into the spiritual principles that make life work at its best.  If everyone played this video once a week for a year, the world would be a much better place.  You can watch it all the way through and it flows smoothly.  I like to play it before sleeping and it helps me have good dreams.  Enjoy!!",1340582400,,649,4.262295081967213
