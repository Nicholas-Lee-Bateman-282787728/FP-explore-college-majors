8121585,3,B000FERUBS,"With these types of movies, it only takes one good scene to carry the film.  That scene comes 2/3 of the way through the film when Nicole (played by the lovely redhead Deborah Dutch), having been kidnapped by a rogue sheriff (Nikki Fritz) and forced into sexual slavery, is dressed in black lingerie and stripped by the sex ring leader (Lorissa McComas) as a present for two ""customers"".  Not a word of dialogue is spoken in the scene but it conveys a lot of emotions as Nicole goes through the spectrum of fear, defiance, acceptance, and then defeat.  The movie should have upticked the drama from there, but unfortunately the writer/director/producer hocked it up by inserting segments of him slow-dancing with a waitress in order to break up the tension building in the climax.  Terrible decision.  Completely ruins the build-up of the scene.  What is supposed to be horrible and repulsive, isn't.  The entire film is told in flashbacks, which ruins any sense of dramatic build-up through the victim's eyes.  Other than Nicole's undressing preparatory to being whored out, the rest of the film is forgettable, unless you like to watch people slow-dancing to country music ballads.  Deborah Dutch's scene is worth five stars, the rest of the movie is worth only one, so I'm splitting the difference at three stars.

Incidentally, this film has absolutely nothing to do with ""Caged Women"" with Pilar Orive as the damsel in distress.  That movie, however, is a staple of the women-in-captivity genre.  This one could have been if the writer/director/producer hadn't hocked it up.",1439251200,,1579,4.984732824427481
