Simitar Ent released this DVD in 1998 to cash in on the re-make, and was very collectable and a very good print, however, this version by Classic Media is the way to go! Superb, can't wait!!!

2557730,5,B000FA4TLQ,"After 52 years, the US finally receives an official home release for the original Gojira.  Please forget everything you remember about the horrible US butchering and purchase this product.

The film is a scathing political commentary on the United States' practice of nuclear testing (and certainly the previous use) in the Pacific.  The film is NOT a silly sci-fi about a giant angry monster attacking cities at random.  There is a reason that the doomsday weapon used to kill Gojira is called the ""Oxygen Destroyer"" in perfect English.

Takashi Shimura, best known for his work with Akira Kurosawa, is terrific as usual.  The musical score by Akira Ikifube is my personal favorite of his compositions.",1148688000,102,703,5.069565217391304
2557731,5,B000FA4TLQ,"Godzilla is a fiery, stylized, highly charged piece of Japanese art.  Unlike many U.S monster movies of the age (which I do love), Godzilla is not just a spectacle of special effects and cheep thrills, but a tender story about love, sacrifice and consequence.

Please I beg you to avoid at all costs the 1956 U.S 'remake' included on this disc.  It makes a mockery of the 1954 version by inserting a narrator in the form of American reporter Steve Martin, who was 'there all the time', adding him into scenes from the original by butchering it and inserting pointless and obviously staged attempts at English translations. It even goes so far as to dub over the heroin's voice in one scene when she chats with Martin about the aftermath of Godzilla's rampage on Tokyo.  Clearly a scene at a different time and place remembered from the original, and she was definatly not talking to the American reporter Steve Martin at the time!  It offended me to do this to such a good movie.",1147392000,,979,4.603448275862069
2557732,5,B000FA4TLQ,"If you are like most Americans, you have probably never seen the original, unadulterated ""Godzilla"" (Original title ""Gojira."" the name being a mix of the Japanese words for ""gorilla"" and ""whale."") More familiar with the campy, badly dubbed and edited version that graced TV screens in the 70s, we have seen Raymond Burr awkwardly inserted into the plot, anti-American political sentiments removed, and a horde of mismatched dialogs and ridiculous translations. Well, we are in for a real treat!

The Japanese ""Godzilla"" is a serious film, starring Kurosawa veteran Takashi Shimura (""Seven Samurai,"" ""Ikura"").  (In fact, two of Shimura's films, ""Godzilla"" and ""Seven Samurai"" competed for the 1954 Japanese Academy Award for Best Picture.)  Only nine years after the atomic bombs devastated Hiroshima and Nagasaki,  the threat of nuclear power was very much in the minds of the average Japanese citizen.  Contamination, mutation, radiation...this was far from science fiction.  This is the fire from which sprang the King of Monsters.

In a now-familiar plot, American nuclear testing has given rise to a 150-foot tall engine of destruction, breathing atomic fire and hell-bent on destroying Tokyo before taking on the world. Assembling the army, and all of the modern science Japan can muster, they battle the rampaging monster to the inevitable conclusion.

Standing along side the original 1933 ""King Kong,"" ""Godzilla"" is a classic monster movie, as well as a fine film in its own right. A suspenseful horror-drama, the acting, filming and special effects are all far above other entries in the genre.  The black and white filming is used superbly, with the fire-cast shadows making the monster all the more menacing.

What is great about this set, is that not only do you get a restored and beautiful version of the original classic, you get an additional disk with the American edit complete with the stuffy professor Raymond Burr and the additional footage thought necessary for American audiences.  It is a rare chance to compare the two versions, and see how politics in the US affected what audiences were allowed to view in the 1950s.

I have been waiting a long time for the original ""Godzilla"" to get a DVD release, and it is great to see it finally being treated with the respect it deserves.",1146268800,246,2304,5.082228116710875

There is no him coming from the depths of the ocean to battle some other creature threatening the world, or irritating twin fairys and a giant moth larvae, just Godzilla being the rampaging, viscous behemoth he should always have been.

2557765,5,B000FA4TLQ,"This classic monster movie, now marking it's sixty year anniversary, remains a true classic in every sense of the word.  Thanks to this excellent DVD it can now be seen in its original form.  All of the scenes that were filmed with Raymond Burr to make the movie more American have been (Thankfully) removed.  The picture quality is great and, in my opinion the best thing of all about the movie, the original dialogue track is restored.  In a nutshell, the way it is meant to be seen.

In the movie, Japan has been plagued by the mysterious disappearance of a number of ships.  A subsequent investigation reveals that Japan's nuclear testing has released a hideous monster that had been buried under the ocean floor for centuries.  The monster feeds on nuclear radiation making it virtually invulnerable.  The elder inhabitants of a small Japanese island have dubbed the raging monster Gojira.  The monster soon moves into Japan destroying cities and killing and injuring countless civilians.  The Japanese military might proves to be useless against Gojira's power.  The Japanese government is at a standstill as to how to defeat Gojira.  However a brilliant but reclusive Japanese scientist Dr. Serizawa may have the answer in the form of a deadly weapon he has invented.  However he is reluctant to use it because doing so would reveal his weapon to competing world powers who would use it to wreak havoc on their enemies which could result in countless deaths.

""Gojira"" is thrilling from start to finish.  What I found from watching this movie recently is that the special effects still hold up even by today's digital standards.  Yes, I will admit that there are some scenes (Like the scenes of tanks and crashing trains for example.) that are a bit obvious, but they do not take away from the overall enjoyment of the movie.  What is also the most effective is the effects of Gojira himself.  Director Ishiro Honda decided that the old stop-motion animation would not be sufficient for this movie.  He felt it would be too expensive and would take an extremely long time to film the movie.  So he decided to try what at the time was an innovative technique.  He would use an actor in a specially designed suit to film the scenes of Gojira.  Stuntman Haruo Nakajima plays Gojira in a 200 pound monster costume and I will say that he does so very well (He would play the monster again in many of the movies that followed.).  I feel that Honda made the right choice here because I do not believe that stop motion would not have worked.  An animated Gojira would not be as scary and menacing if he were filmed in that fashion.

As great as the special effects are that is not the only reason why this movie works so well.  It also sends a powerful message about the unintended consequences of the Atomic Age.  Many other movies have done a good job showing such consequences (The classic ""Them!"" for example.), but none has done so quite as well as ""Gojira"".  The cast is also top notch.  All do a very good job in their respective roles.  The dialogue is also very well written which makes the movie all the more enjoyable.

This two DVD set also has some very good special features.  It does include the inferior Americanized version of this film released in 1956 under the title ""Godzilla:  King of the Monsters"".  After this US release Toho Studios, the Japanese company who produced the first fifteen Godzilla films, wisely copyrighted the name and used it for the monster from there on in.  It also includes the movie's original trailer and two well made documentaries on how Godzilla was developed and how the monster costume was made.  Just a few more reasons why this DVD is worth owning.

I am very pleased that I was able to see this excellent movie in it's original form.  I highly recommend you do the same.  Buy or rent this whenever possible.  Even if you don't feel the need because you have seen ""Godzilla:  King of the Monsters"" you have not really seen the movie until you have seen it in its original form.",1417046400,,4030,4.643564356435643

2557770,5,B000FA4TLQ,"The original Gojira is fantastic, as it turns out. Like many, I had only been exposed to Godzilla through the many campier dubbed Japanese spinoffs and the bad 90s American movie (which I'll admit, I liked at the time--I was 11). The original is a much more contemplative sci-fi feature that deals with the consequences of nuclear weapons testing. For most of this movie, we are simply following the human characters, whose motivations are clear and believable. When Godzilla does show up, it is especially effective, even though the special effects seem outdated today. I highly recommend Gojira if you're a fan of monster movies or science fiction and have yet to see the source of the phenomenon.

This set is nice for the price. It also includes, on a separate disc, the American bastardization of the original movie, which some might like to have for nostalgia's sake. It's a nice solid case as well.",1411689600,,905,4.838709677419355
2557771,5,B000FA4TLQ,"""Godzilla/Gojira"" is an absolute classic! A masterpiece of Japanese cinema! It's dark, gritty, and gets very emotional at times. Far more serious than all of the movies that followed it. The build-up is great, the characters likeable, and the movie's anti-nuclear war message is very strong. The Americanized version of the movie, ""Godzilla, King of the Monsters!"" is a different movie than the Japanese original that puts a reporter played by Raymond Burr into the action and shows the viewer his perspective of the movie's events. This approach to the film is interesting to say the least. However, one major fault in this version of the movie is that it strongly lacks the anti-nuclear war message of the original. But it's still a fairly decent take on the film and worth at least one viewing. So if you're interested, check out the original Japanese classic that is ""Gojira.""",1411689600,,880,4.952702702702703

2557783,5,B000FA4TLQ,This two disc set offers the original version of Godzilla which is Gojira and the American watered down version. Ishiro Honda's brilliant anti-nuclear warns the world of the dangers of mankind ever using such destructive weapons ever again. In Gojira we witness the radiation poisoning gojira causes and the deaths brought on by nuclear power. With the American version most of this heartbreaking scenes were trimmed down to not offend Americans. The original suit for gojira was very bulky and hard to move but the scenes it was used in added raw power to them as you are made to believe this creature could be real. As a child I grew up oin the American vesion but as I learned of the original i knew I had to witness  a masterpiece of cinema.

2557789,5,B000FA4TLQ,"Two movies, the movie Late Spring(Banshun,1949) of Yasujiro Ozu film director work and the movie Godzilla(Gojira,1954) of Ishiro Honda film director work, may have said in common.
It is saying that for the person who passed away, a living person needs to change fortunately.
It says a little more wordily, the people who remained for those who have died against their will have the responsibility which builds a fortunate home and society.
(Here is an original story in two works. An original also has the theme and an opinion. However, some change for putting in both of one's opinions is made in filming. Since it is the purpose that an opinion gets across to many spectators, it is satisfactory.)
------------------------------------------------
1,A trace of Director Ozu reaching Late Spring
Director Ozu works starts in the silent-movie ages of prewar. His works(I Was Born, But...(Umarete wa mita keredo,1932),etc) are loaded with desire to draw and present the problem of the occasional social trend. He repeats trial and error to the reality in which the public sees only the movie which he wants to see. Moreover, although he also tried a thing of the U.S. movie style like Dragnet Girl(Hijosen no Onna,1933), it did not gear completely.
He is demobilized in war, without being smeared with an intense battle as it served in a war by a chemical weapon unit from testimony of the person himself.
""A Hen in the Wind(Kaze no naka no mendori)"" which tried the opinion again by it was disrepute. It was refusal for many spectators to look at the reality of sympathizing on a movie. I think that this movie itself had effective control, it avoided the love scene scene, and had presented an actual problem and its solution.
However, he completes his methodology in a Late Spring at last. This work was made in Japan under occupation through which it has passed only four years from the end of the war. First, he arranges the element which is likely to pull mind for many spectators and he spread the story. Next, he brings many spectators to the scene of the opinion. So to speak, the contents of the story are ""decoy(pretense or pretext)"". His true opinion appears. The climax of this work is a father's ""Solo long words"" portion in the hotel(ryokan,A Japanese-style hotel) in Kyoto. Although long words are described plainly, it is all the opinions of this work.
------------------------------------------------
2,Godzilla(1954) of director Ishiro Honda,The successful succession
On both sides of Treaty of San Francisco(April 28, 1952), Godzilla(1954) was manufactured five years after Late Spring in Showa 29(1954). Director Honda worked sincerely, imitating the methodology of Late Spring.
Mother does not appear at home of Dr. Yamane, and it is two livings with Emiko of a daughter. The first scene of a living room of a house of Dr. Yamane is photographed by low angle, and a line of a head of actors is set in form of a right down straight line. And Father does not appear in the family of Shinkichi of the Oto island. They are ""Lacked families"".
Emiko was, so to speak, a childhood friend of Dr. Serizawa, and she chose Ogata as a lover though it was a future fiance. Director Honda's opinion is shown by Solo long words which comes after an argument of Dr. Serizawa and Ogata.
Music grows well very much. Composition of music is Akira Ifukube.
Melody of a cello passed to Solo long words is the same as melody of the harmonica which a fisherman blows in an opening scene of the work(With many the classical style music works, the subject of a work is shown in the beginning.). This melody is transformation(variation) of melody that is the first movement of the Eroica symphony(Sinfonia Eroica, composta per festeggiare il sovvenire d'un grand'uomo) of Beethoven. It is that is to say hero of tragedy. The last movement of the Eroica symphony melody was quoted from his ballet music ""The Creatures of Prometheus"". Prometheus gave the human ""fire"" in a myth. Then, it is supposed that ""the knowledge of civilization"" was given. Even if it submits it to civilization criticism and reflection, it is thought.
Is Dr. Serizawa a victim? Did Dr. Serizawa blame that the secret should just have been kept and was there? No, it is different. Although a schoolgirl's chorus was the dead's symbol(the Holy Spirit of all the people), it was seen, and he noticed and regained his conscience. He tells Emiko and Ogata that I want you to become fortunate. (Hope of symbol can be found out in two persons' future, Emiko and Ogata. Because they will never forget the fact of tragedy.) He accepted own responsibility. He has noticed that it is a mistake to have shown dangerous invention to Emiko. Emiko says, ""I never say to father, either"". It is the same meaning as a husband dose never say to wife, either. Some scene where there is a distortion in a heart of Dr. Serizawa is different from Director Ozu-angle, and the horizon line becomes an upward slant to the right. ""Godzilla"" is the person's symbol between the persons it became impossible to control a desire. It can be said that it is Director Honda's opinion that just the human being of a position like Dr. Serizawa in fact should lead control of a desire.
------------------------------------------------
3,A dream of Ozu and Honda successful succession
Director Ozu and Honda's opinion is expressed in Dreams (Yume,Akira Kurosawa's Dreams,1990) again.
Director Akira Kurosawa made a movie of strange omnibus 6 episodes(7 episodes form at first plan).
Ishiro Honda participates in this work as aide direction(Substance is equal with a director).
Solo long words appear to episode 6th of this work. The performer is Chishu Ryu. The opinion are the repetition that they emphasized of what Director Ozu Late Spring and Director Honda Godzilla(1954) insisted on. However the opinion like Director Kurosawa is included, too. However, I think that after all an opinion of Ishiro Honda is strongly reflected in a shadow.
------------------------------------------------
4,Appendix 1(About Late Spring of Director Ozu)
The scene where the work became dirty from the tearoom of the beginning to the last is eliminated entirely. Reality is waiting to many spectators after coming out of a movie theater. The town of it is a burned field and it is in the situation without food where there is no honest house. Many spectators thinks that they wanted to forget reality at least while seeing the movie. Director Ozu examined himself about the previous work, and regained intuition.
A close life of the beautiful daughter Noriko(Setsuko Hara) and the father Professor / Syukichi Soya(Chishu Ryu) passing middle age who lost the wife. A daughter's marriage talk, a father's second marriage talk, the friend of the already remarried father. The plot is shown which pulls many spectators's mind.
If it looks at the situation where people in those days were placed here, a father will be killed in war and it will seem how was the mother a death due to sickness, debility death, etc., and Lacked families was a large number. It seems that Lacked family was an icon representing a social trend of those days.
By it, it becomes a scene of the bedroom of the hotel(ryokan) in Kyoto.
After two persons talk in a bed, a daughter's face scene and, a flower vase scene(a pot shot) enters twice. This meaning is that the 1st time is the deceased mother who gazes at two persons, and the 2nd time is a symbol of the Holy Spirit of all the people who passed away in the war(A spirit of a departed person, night under the moon therefore). People who passed away are wishing surviving people's happiness.
And although the next morning comes and a daughter recurs the talk, Ozu's true opinion Solo long words starts here. It is clear that these words are turned to many spectators instead of a daughter. ""History of human life -- Mother was seen crying in kitchen repeatedly(Who made it cry ?)... "" If this will be made the conversation of a father and a daughter however it may see this, it is tedious as words and there are a little inconsistencies. This is the opinion signal(message) to many spectators. Your past should dissociate once. It is the opinion notice new happy home and happy society what should be built all together.

The last scene. An apple of lower left of a screen. Father finishes skinning it and bows his head(Direction to cry at first) . This is an allegory of Forbidden fruit of Adam and Eve. It is the tree of wisdom(knowledge of the right and wrong) . It is tiny criticism to war of Director Ozu who thought that ""Human being is smarter...but why"" . And it is civilization criticism, and it is succeeded by Director Honda.
------------------------------------------------
5,Appendix 2(About after Late Spring of Director Ozu)
In Late Spring, Early Summer(Bakushu,1951), and Tokyo Story(Tokyo Monogatari,1953), all of three persons' name are ""Noriko"". This is the name imposed on the ""Norito(a Shinto prayer-ancient, Japanese Liturgy)"" . It is because ""the feeling heart of thankfulness to it being given life"" is in one of the meaning of a congratulatory address.
First, Early Summer is the story which Noriko is married to the man who loses a wife and has a child. ""Really true ...""""was good with the ... It was good by chattering""
The performance of Tami(Haruko Sugimura) is the presentation of a sample to many spectators. Besides, because she marries into Akita, there is conversation asking whether she speaks Akita dialect and wears ""Monpe(Work clothes for woman of Japanese pants-style
,it is asked whether she does a dirty work. But,it is a temporary transfer of an office worker, farming has nothing to do.)"" . This is the signal(message) to people of a farm village. It gives hope to people of Lacked families in a farm village. It is possible that there is the person who goes from a city to a farm village.
In next, Tokyo story, Noriko is the wife who lost a husband. It is composition of the husband who was killed in war, and its wife. Excellent scene in a Japanese-style apartment(narrow collective housing for low income earners) of Noriko whom there is in the Yokohama neighborhood. Conversation of a bride and a mother-in-law Tomi(Chieko Higashiyama), you cry and cry. However, it is usual practices of a Japanese movie from old times to let sound a violin and many spectators cry(Olin wo suru). I emphasize a fiction of this scene, and this is that is to say a lie talk. Please watch the last gesture and a performance of an expression of Noriko well. It is made to open by conversation in Onomichi of the last. Your husband who died hopes for your happiness. Please find your good partner, and marry again early, that is Director Ozu's opinion , and a signal (a message) for many spectators.
I think that you who are good of perception understood it if I say incidentally. It is usual practices of a Japanese movie from old times to A Hen in the Wind's Tumbled down the stairs,too. Is the scene where he used a stunt man as only very ""Rial"" ? I think that Director Odu checked it repeatedly. He consider it to have directed it to let me change many spectator suddenly. However, the intention of his work direction was not understood not received by spectatos,
------------------------------------------------
6,Appendix 3(A supplementary opinion about music of Godzilla(1954))
When expression is quoted, it comes to have an original context and a different meaning. Melody of The Eroica symphony is quotation of a early opera's overture of Mozart. However, it is quotation of Beethoven with this work. I regard a very famous main theme as quotation of string quartet of Beethoven. It was used an old russian origin rhythm that the second of Razoumovsky. A title is Russian notation(Cyrillic alphabet) when I watch facsimile score of a main theme. However, Maurce Ravel used the same rhythm(melody) with Concerto for Piano and Orchestra. Then therefore a new meaning was added and had double meaning(re-spectrum Russia and irony or negation). This rhythm(melody) was used in Tone Poem ""Arctic Forest""(Composed by Akira Ifukube,1945). Music of the scene where Godzilla goes ashore is transformation(variation) of Dies irae(Day of Wrath).",1404950400,,12212,4.916666666666667

2557803,5,B000FA4TLQ,"I thought I'd laugh my way through this film, expecting something as cheesy as old Ed Wood movies.  Instead it surprised me with excellent acting, suspenseful pacing, a thoughtful script, superb crafting and an originality that begat a whole genre of followers.  Yes, the special effects are hilariously dated, but the film succeeds most remarkably as a time capsule of post-war Japan.  What I saw was a nation struggling with the PTSD of war and atomic holocaust, the experience turned into mythology, as if it were too horrible to contemplate human propensity for evil and destruction, it is projected onto an allegorical monster.

Whether taken as a monster flick, a film history icon or a post-war cultural study, the original 1954 Godzilla is a not-to-be-missed classic.",1401580800,,775,5.126984126984127

2557805,5,B000FA4TLQ,"This is the film that started it all Gojira/Godzilla Directed by Ishir Honda and featuring special effects by Eiji Tsuburaya, Music is done by Akira Ifukube, the film starred Akira Takarada, Momoko Kchi, Akihiko Hirata and Takashi Shimura. This film is the beginning of the three Eras Showa, Heisei, and Millennium. Those of you who have seen this movie Im not spoiling anything for those of you who haven't well Im talking about this movie series as it is with that said lets begin the story.

Story: A Japanese fishing boat is attacked by a flash of light near Odo Island, another ship is sent to investigate only to meet the same fate, with only a few surviving. On Odo Island, a village elder blames their poor fishing on a monster known as Godzilla. Word gets out and a helicopter arrives on the island with curious, but skeptical, reporters. Frightened natives perform a night-time ceremony to keep the monster away. However, that night, while the natives sleep, a storm arrives and something else comes with it, bringing death and destruction. And a boy sees the cause during the midst of the destruction. The next day, witnesses arrive in Tokyo. Archeologist Kyohei Yamane suggests that investigators be sent to the island. On arrival, Yamane finds giant radioactive footprints, and a trilobite. When an alarm sounds, the villagers arm themselves with sticks and various weapons and run to the hills, only to be confronted by Godzilla, who is revealed to be an enormous dinosaur creature. After a quick skirmish, the villagers run for safety and Godzilla heads to the ocean. Dr. Yamane returns to Tokyo to present his findings and concludes that Godzilla was unleashed by a nuclear explosion. Some want to conceal that fact, fearing international repercussions. Others say the truth must be revealed. They prevail and Godzilla's origins are announced to the public. Ships are sent with depth charges to kill the monster. When that fails, Godzilla appears again, frightening patrons on a party boat, and causing nationwide panic. Officials appeal to Dr. Yamane for some way to kill the monster, but Yamane wants him kept alive and studied. Meanwhile, Emiko, Yamane's daughter, decides to break off her arranged engagement to Yamane's colleague, Daisuke Serizawa, because of her love for Hideto Ogata, a salvage ship captain. Before she can do that, Serizawa tells her about his secret experiment. He gives a small demonstration, using a fish tank in the lab. Shocked, Emiko is sworn to secrecy and never gets a chance to break off the engagement. That night Godzilla emerges from Tokyo Bay and attacks the city. Though the attack is over quickly, there is much death and destruction. The next morning, the army constructs a line of 40-meter electrical towers along the coast of Tokyo that will send 50,000 volts of electricity through Godzilla, should he appear again. Civilians are evacuated from the city and put into bomb shelters. As night falls, Godzilla does indeed attack again. He easily breaks through the electric fence, melting the wires with his atomic breath. A bombardment of shells from the army tanks has no effect. Godzilla continues his rampage until much of the city is destroyed and thousands of civilians are dead or wounded. Godzilla descends unscathed into Tokyo Bay, despite a squadron of fighter jets' last-ditch attack. The next morning finds Tokyo in ruins. Hospitals overflow with victims, including some with radiation poisoning. Emiko witnesses the devastation and tells Ogata about Serizawa's secret Oxygen Destroyer, a device that disintegrates oxygen atoms and organisms die of asphyxiation. Thus, a new energy source he accidentally created. She hopes together they can persuade Serizawa to use it to stop Godzilla. When Serizawa realizes Emiko betrays his secret, he refuses, and Ogata and Serizawa fight and Ogata receives a minor head wound. As Emiko treats Ogata's wound, Serizawa apologizes, but he refuses to use the weapon on Godzilla, citing the public bedlam his weapon could cause. Then a newscast shows the devastation Godzilla has caused. Choirs of children are shown singing a hymn. Finally realizing this, Serizawa decides he will use the weapon only one time and then its secret must be destroyed for the good of humanity. He then burns all his papers and research. Emiko breaks down and cries when she sees this, as she understands that Serizawa is sacrificing his life's work and himself to stop Godzilla. A navy ship takes Ogata and Serizawa to plant the device in Tokyo Bay. They don diving gear and descend into the water, where they find Godzilla at rest. Ogata returns to the surface as Serizawa activates the device. Serizawa watches Godzilla dies then tells Ogata to be with Emiko. He then cuts his own oxygen cord, sacrificing himself so his knowledge of the device cannot be used to harm mankind. A dying Godzilla surfaces, lets out a final roar, and sinks to the bottom, disintegrating until he is nothing but bones, and eventually, nothing. Although the monster is gone, those aboard ship are still grim. They do not know if the death of Godzilla is the end or the beginning of an apocalyptic era. Godzilla's death has come at a terrible price and Dr. Yamane believes that if mankind continues to test nuclear weapons, another Godzilla may appear.

The tone of this film is dark and you feel like you're there especially with Akira Ifukube music score. There is a love triangle between Emiko Ogata and Serizawa during and after Godzilla appears which is a great element for the film.
The opening scene of the Eiko Maru being obliterated by Godzilla's first attack and later scenes of survivors of other attacks being found with radiation burns were inspired by the U.S. testing of a hydrogen bomb on Bikini Atoll. A real Japanese fishing ship, the Lucky Dragon 5, was overwhelmed when the U.S. Castle Bravo nuclear test had a yield of 15 megatons rather than the planned 6 megatons. Military personnel, island natives and several Lucky Dragon 5 crew members, persons believed to be in a zone of safety, suffered from radiation sickness and at least one died six months later. This created widespread fear of uncontrolled and unpredictable nuclear weapons, which the film makers symbolized with Godzilla. The actual event played a major role in drawing attention to the hazards of nuclear fallout, and concerns were widespread about radioactively contaminated fish affecting the Japanese food supply. Godzilla's climactic attack on Tokyo was meant to exemplify a rolling nuclear attack, like Hiroshima and Nagasaki, only much more slowly. Honda had plotted it this way, having been shocked by the real devastation of those cities.

The American dub Godzilla King of the Monsters is basically this film with scenes thrown backward Raymond Burr is great here for the English dub isn't bad.

Characters: Dr Serizawa is a great character along with Dr Yamane.
Dr. Yamanes quote: I cant believe that Godzilla was the only surviving member of its species. If we continue Nuclear Testing, very soon, another Godzilla might appear, somewhere else in the world, again is a great and yet for warning of this film.
Monsters/Monster: Godzilla is one of the best monsters for Toho. His greatest design Toho has and this film is what started the film series.

Music: Akira Ifukubes music is the films greatest aspect for the first Godzilla film.

I give this film a perfect 10/10",1399334400,,7433,5.009708737864078
2557806,5,B000FA4TLQ,"When I was a child back in the 1960s, my first exposure to Japanese science-fiction was on a 12"" black-and-white television. Unlike my friends, who took a distinctly American superior attitude to the genre, I sat in awe and wonderment. Even though I viewed the science-fiction output of Toho Studios in terribly dubbed , black and white and pan-and-scanned versions, I still enjoyed them thoroughly. It just never occurred to me to criticize these gems of fantasy and science-fiction as poorly made and inferior.
Finally,  with the advent of home-video, I was finally able to acquire a lot of these films on bootleg VHS tapes and DVDs, in their original, glorious widescreen TOHOSCOPE ! versions with Japanese language and English subtitles. The original Godzilla, of course, was not in widescreen or color, but I still had never seen the original  1954 GOJIRA until it came out in a theater in Maryland in 2004, on the 50th anniversary. What a treat-not only finally seeing a Godzilla film on a theater screen, but also the original, uncut version!

I watched the Americanized version starring Raymond Burr when I was very young and it was very fun-scary. Watching ""Gojira"" and then ""Godzilla"" on dvd proved interesting to me. ""Gojira"" was more detailed and emotional. At times, it seemed too drawn out though. Then, it was somewhat humorous to me how they stuck Raymond Burr and the newer supporting cast into the scenes from the original movie. Some of the special effects were laughable, but good for the time. My main complaint involves the inability of the dvd production company to clean up the scratches and spots in the movies. However, Godzilla is a monster classic and helped introduce me to the wonders of monster sci-fi.",1396396800,,757,4.8307692307692305

2557824,5,B000FA4TLQ,"I saw the American version a couple of times but oddly, this is the only Godzilla movie that I liked as the others were too campy and silly to even be interesting. This one plays it straight, with Godzilla coming out of the sea as an almost invincible deadly radioactive monster, a creation of nuclear testing. This compilation contains both the American version with Raymond Burr, and the original Japanese version ""Gojira"" with English subtitles. I suggest watching the original version to see the subtle differences in both films. The subtitles make it easy enough to follow and the story loses no continuity by leaving out the American influence. The science is a bit skewed perhaps, but that doesn't detract from a rather tense emotional story about a terrifying monster rising from the sea, and a moody scientist fraught with doubts and fears about the weapon he created that could destroy it-- or the world if knowledge of its creation ever got away from him. In both films, Godzilla is neither campy nor funny, even if it is a man in a monster suit as he stomps over the countryside and rises from the sea to wreak havoc upon Japan.",1393200000,4,1140,4.705
2557825,5,B000FA4TLQ,"The first two Godzilla movies I had watched as a kid were Godzilla vs. Gigan and Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla (1974).  Back then, I didn't know about the twenty-two other Godzilla films I could have been watching.  The third Godzilla film I laid eyes on happened to be the U.S. release of Gojira on VHS.  I was shocked by how grim the tone of this movie was compared to the other two I used to watch.  At that age, I didn't understand the symbolic meaning of the monster; I was actually pretty bored by the movie.  It wasn't until recently I was able to finally watch the original UNCUT Japanese version of Gojira.

Boy, did the U.S. hack that movie up or what?

Reading English subtitles isn't the best, but it's worth every line when the movie is that much better.  I prefer the Japanese version of the film over the U.S. version any day.  Not because U.S. release is a worthless piece of garbage, but because I don't want to feel like a dummy when Raymond Burr has to narrate everything that's going on when Godzilla is around.
The DVD case is really nice, and there's a neat little booklet inside that describes Godzilla's origins as a movie monster plus some.  It's pretty interesting.
The original Godzilla is definitely one of my favorite films in the series; the grim tone, story, and message of the film is great entertainment.  For anyone who has never seen the original cut of Gojira, this DVD is a must-have - especially for it's outstanding price!  Reading subtitles during a movie isn't for everyone, but give this one a shot.  This film will (hopefully) make viewers appreciate the message Japan was trying to get across, and maybe subdue the cheesy, goofy 60's Godzilla some have grown to know.

Taken as a straight horror or sci fi movie Godzilla succeeds nicely and is an atmospheric and entertaining flick. I recommend it to scifi and horror buffs as to see the first import from Japan that started awave of giant monsters through the 60s and 70s.
This set is well presented and has two discs one is the Japanese version the other is the American released version. Both are good but there are major differences between them and seeing both versions is rather eye opening.

While the movie really does look aged you still can't help but admire the film crew work given that they were working on a limited budget and that they didn't have a lot of the special effects that a lot of movies use today. In this original we see Godzilla in all his bad guy glory as he marches across Japan laying waste to everything in his way. Working against him are scientists and the military as they try to figure out a way to take him down. While it does have a B-movie feel it still managed to be a very influential film that has inspired or otherwise been ripped off by numerous other movies since it's release.

The DVD has a lot of goods in it as well, plenty of extras including one on the history of the design of Godzilla himself.

Director Ishiro Honda takes the basic premise of a giant radioactive dinosaur causing havoc and turns it into something far more. Gojira isn't like the ants in THEM, animals merely doing what comes natural. Gojira is a monster here to punish mankind for playing God. Even the suit effects, which are admittedly creaky by today's standards, hold up very well due to the way in which they were masterfully shot.

2557859,5,B000FA4TLQ,"Since this is my first review with anything related to Godzilla, I'd like to say that I was a big Godzilla fan from 1997-2002 since at the time, I thought there was hardly anything as fun as seeing big monster fights with a huge dollop of cheesy English dubbing from the Japanese actors in the numerous Godzilla sequels.  In my initial fandom, I thought Godzilla:  King of the Monsters (the American, English-dubbed and edited version of Gojira starring Raymond Burr) was the most serious and somber of the bunch, and considered it the best.  Rewatching Godzilla:  King of the Monsters recently, I'd say that it's a decent 50's monster movie, but after watching Gojira, I consider Gojira a masterful film that can compete with acclaimed arthouse Japanese films like Harakiri and The Seven Samurai.

STORY

Near the coast of Tokyo, ships are reported as being destroyed by mysterious flashes of massive fire.  The natives of Odo Island, the island near the ship accidents, claim that a giant monster named Godzilla has destroyed the ships.  Upon further research from scientists and the government, they find out that a giant, destructive creature from the prehistoric era has come back...and is seemingly unstoppable.  A scientist makes a horrible discovery that just might kill Godzilla, but could bring another global threat if ever revealed.

CHARACTERS

The characters in this movie were pretty well done, as just about all of them felt like real people.  I thought the character with the most interesting personality was Dr. Serizawa (played by Akihiko Hirata).  Dr. Serizawa was convincing as a scientist who's discovered something he wish he never did, and when asked to confront Godzilla with this, really shows the inner-conflict he faces.  The legendary Takahsi Shimura played Dr. Yamane, an archeologist determined to find out why Godzilla is alive.  I was intrigued by the fact that he wants Gojira alive since it's among the only creatures alive on Earth from the prehistoric era.  Hideto Ogata (Akira Takarada) is a marine patrolman who wants Godzilla dead, much to the dismay of Dr. Yamane.  Ogata's character feels pretty realistic, and I like the fact that the love triangle between him, Emiko, and Dr. Serizawa doesn't get sappy or take up too much screentime from everything else.  The only criticism I feel comfortable in saying is with Emiko Yamane's character (played by Momoko Kochi).  Her acting was good overall, but in some scenes that she screamed or cried (such as when Dr. Serizawa revealed his ""horrible discovery""), they seemed a little melodramatic, but nowhere near being on the verge of bad acting.

SPECIAL EFFECTS

If you've read Roger Ebert's lousy review for Gojira, you'd know that he smashed the ""poor quality"" of the film's special effects.  I have to disagree with him on this because what he doesn't take into account is that Gojira was one of Japan's first movies heavy on special effects, and therefore, was a groundbreaking movie for its time in its particular nation.  Even though this movie is 58 years-old, I think the special effects have dated pretty well, even if the shortcomings are noticeable in some areas.  The gritty black and white cinematography and engrossing atmosphere make you forget that Godzilla is really a man in a rubber monster suit.  The miniatures made for the buildings, tanks, and so fourth look good for the time, and the only scene where you can see an obvious special effect fault is that in a scene where you see Godzilla's tail through a destroyed building's window, you can see the string holding up Godzilla's tail.  Though all in all, the special effects have aged pretty well after all these years and their shortcomings don't damage the viewing experience.

SOUNDTRACK

Akira Ifukube's music for Gojira is magnificent.  The main theme of the movie is easily among the best main themes in the whole Godzilla franchise.  The main theme of this movie would be really well suited for military marches.  There's other musical compositions, like ""Godzilla Comes Ashore,"" that have a really dark, brooding atmosphere to them that really give me the chills.  There's even some tracks like ""Prayer for Peace,"" that have a sad yet chilling feeling to them.  The emotional diversity and good use of dynamics throughout the compositions in this movie really show that Ifukube was a masterful composer.

DIFFERENCES FROM US VERSION

This category will also cover the themes of Gojira.

Besides a different language track and the absence of Raymond Burr, there's some pretty drastic changes in the original Gojira compared to Godzilla:  King of the Monsters.  One of the big changes that stuck out to me the most is the opening credits.  In the US version of the movie, it's a simple, flashy title card with the movie title written in a font typical of American monster/horror movies from the 50's with Godzilla's roars and foot stomps in the background.  In the original Japanese version, the opening credits immediately let you know that you're in for a totally serious movie.  The opening consists of credits for the title, cast, and crew scrolling upward with the Gojira main theme playing in the background, along with Gojira's roars and foot stomps.

One difference that may seem innocuous to most viewers but really stuck out at me is the hospital scenes.  In the beginning of the US version, you see a little girl cry over her dead mother, but it's quickly transitioned to Steve Martin (Raymond Burr's character) recalling the attacks and being carried on a stretcher.  In the original, there's more focus on this girl, and it had much more emotional power when you saw Emiko trying to comfort her by telling her that her mother will be okay.

Another key difference is the order of scenes and actions that occur throughout the film.  In the beginning of the US version of the movie, you already know that Tokyo gets destroyed by Gojira, with Steve recalling what happened.  In the original version, it starts off with a ship at sea getting attacked by Gojira (though shot to where you don't actually see or hear the beast), and it progresses as to how you see Tokyo get destroyed.

Among the most critical of differences is the emphasis of its central theme.  Even if you've just watched the US version, you know that it's a warning about the dangers of nuclear warfare.  However, in the original, it not only focuses on said warning, but also has strong reflections from its characters about how the nation suffered and is still suffering from the atomic bomb attacks nine years prior (Gojira came out in 1954, nine years after the Nagasaki and Hiroshima bombings).

I thought the execution of the message of Japan's suffering from nuclear bombings was superb, since Ishiro Honda lets you know that these bombings have really harmed the nation while at the same time, totally avoiding any nationalist sentiments to fully scorn America for the bombings while blindly praising his own nation.  The focus solely on the suffering of nuclear attacks really gave this a personal, emotionally-powerful feel to the movie.

FINAL WORD

While I can't say that I've seen everything Ishiro Honda has directed, I'll still make a safe bet that Gojira is among the brightest jewels of his filmography.  If you're looking for a Godzilla film that's totally serious in tone and serves as a harrowing reminder of the potential apocalyptic danger of nuclear warfare, then get yourself a copy of Gojira ASAP.",1353628800,3,7468,4.940705128205129

Japanese version review:
This is best movie ever ! An atomic monster, a scientist, helpless people, destroyed buildings, death, you name it ! So the story goes like this...... the Japanese test their new fancy pancy atomic bomb. It wakes up Godzilla and gives him radioactive powers. He come to Odo Lisland and screws around in there before he goes to Tokyo. When he goes to Tokyo, 100's of people die, more are injured. No biulding is still up. So this sientist called Dr. Serazawia (sorry for spelling) uses a extreamly powerful invention called the Oxygen Destroyer. He uses it to destroy Godzilla underwater. But so noboady forces him to use it in war, he dies with Godzilla. THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is a PERFECT example of how a movie should be made. Story that is great and makes sence, no goofy scenes, subplots that don't interfer with the movie. AND GODZILLA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

is still a awesome movie.",1346284800,,1370,4.825531914893617
2557874,4,B000FA4TLQ,"Originally made in 1954, this movie long predated computer-generated visual effects. Models had to be made of bridges, buildings, etc., for Godzilla to trample or set on fire. The satire of nuclear power is obvious: Flashes of light and intense heat that burns at a distance.

Nothing fazes Godzilla. Electric power cannot hurt him. Tank shells just bounce off him. Then a scientist has an idea that might work...

Recounting the fact that this movie was made less than a decade after the US firebombing of Japanese cities, including Tokyo, I cannot help but think that this movie was also a dig against what the Japanese considered wanton and barbaric US air raids. The B29 campaign had left hundreds of square kilometers of burnt-out and flattened Japanese cities--precisely what Godzilla did in this flick. Japanese civilians perished by the hundreds of thousands, and many more had to flee with their lives in terror--just as in this classic movie.",1342742400,4,952,5.018987341772152

2557877,4,B000FA4TLQ,"The surprise hit that spawned the fertile Japanese monster industry isn't nearly as silly and hokey as its offspring might make you think. Sure, the special effects are laughable by today's standards - a passionate love for obvious miniatures really does it in - but the plot is usually more concerned with deeper meaning than cheap action sets. The monster itself, wisely silhouetted or partially obscured after an unintentionally hilarious debut in broad daylight, works as both a sci-fi foil and a potent metaphor for the terrors nuclear war had played on Japan not ten years prior. And the way he's ultimately dealt with leaves the door wide open to questions about mankind's interference in the natural order, the breakneck spread of WMDs and everything in between. It's always bugged me that later films in the series shifted Godzilla's role to friend of humanity and defender of the planet, because there's really nothing to befriend in a 160-foot, fire-breathing, nuclear-powered lizard with a penchant for destructive strolls through the industrial district. For my money, he's never been used more effectively than he is right here, in a cameo role as the nigh-unstoppable force of nature that muscles humanity into making a tough decision. The story moves a bit too slowly at times, with too many major player sharing too many coincidental relationships, but the moral stays true and frankly it's nice to see a movie in this genre that isn't afraid to take its time.",1328745600,,1477,5.03265306122449

Ishiro Honda brings a stark realism to the fantastic story, keeping the proceedings from descending into either camp or cheap preachiness.  Yes, there is a message here.  After all, Godzilla's attack on Tokyo explicitly mirrors the atomic bombings Japan endured at the close of World War II.  However, Honda's film is more complex than the standard monster on the loose film.  The characters are faced with a true moral dilemma: face destruction by a seemingly unbeatable threat, or unleash a new, and potentially even deadlier, menace (the Oxygen Destroyer) on an already war ravaged mankind.  Another interesting apect of the film is the treatment of Godzilla himself.  Yes he destroys most of Tokyo and kills countless innocent people, but his death does not bring joy.  In the end, Godzilla, a prehistoric creature mutated by modern atomic energy, is himself a victim.  Most American monster films end like a football game:  the monster is dead and everyone cheers... pass the chips, please.  Honda eschews this approach, and the film is much stronger for it.  The spfx are amazing for their time.  It's irritating to me when people trot out the old ""just a guy in a rubber suit"" put down.  I have news for you.  Everything is ""just"" something, be it a model or a computer image.  Modern filmmakers, as advanced as they have become, have not yet been able to just find a dragon/monster/dinosaur and film it.

The Japanese version is longer and doesn't feature Ramond Burr.

Long before Godzilla became a hero and the protector of Japan, he was a royally peeved force of nature sent to punish man for his use of nuclear weapons.  Though he dies in the end in both versions, that's the universal moral of thie first few Godzilla filsm.

However, growing up in America with the American version, Godzilla, the preconceived notions about the film are very from what the filmmakers' intended. Inspired by the victims of the American nuclear bomb on Hiroshima, Gojira is a story of the Japanese people and their defense against the monster Gojira. Gojira is a large lizard-esque monster with skin resembling that of a victim of the nuclear bomb. The American version of the film changes the film so much that the original purpose of the is gone. Transformed into a tale about an American journalist, the story is cut and changed so that Americans would have no idea that the film was originally intended to place the blame on the United States for bombing Hiroshima. Because of how different the Godzilla version of the film is, we are so lucky to have the film released in its intended format. This film reveals more than just the struggles of the Japanese people, but also shows a time in filmmaking when it was okay to want to ""say something"" with your film.  However, the film is not just operating with an agenda. It also manages to entertain audiences with an exciting story. I think that is why the film is universally liked.  The film is a story about a group of people that is being threatened by something way bigger than themselves. In the end they overcome, after sacrifices, to the good of everyone.

2557886,5,B000FA4TLQ,"...I hesitantly give this a 5 star rating; based on the quality of the print.

As with a large part of the American viewing audience, I was, for a long time, only familiar with the American release of this film, known here as ""Godzilla, King Of The Monsters."" And where it's a fairly good film when seen on its own merits, it really pales after seeing the original cut, as shown in Japan. ""Gojira,"" despite all it's technical flaws, is an intense, shocking depiction of the devastation of the Japanese mainland by this by-product of nuclear testing.

On the surface, it's only a monster movie, especially the recut 1956 version, which glosses over much of what Japan experienced in this story and at the end of World War II. Yes, Raymond Burr is a capable actor, but the Hollywood bigwigs decided to make the film's original stars second banana to him, transforming it into his story; an American seeing these events from an outsider's point of view. It plays down the devastation they saw at a personal level. At the end of the war, we didn't see all the horrific things they saw first hand, not film-goers in the 1950's and after, and no Americans, or anyone not living in Japan when those bombs were dropped. The Toho film company used a monster movie to show the world what happened when U.S. fighter planes bombed two major Japanese cities, in the guise of a large primal beast, an after-effect of nuclear technology gone terribly wrong.

As the fan base of monster movies grew younger over the years, the image of Godzilla, mysteriously resurrected (it was killed at the end of the first film), became less threatening and somewhat silly. Yes, buildings still were destroyed and so on, but the violence became cartoonish. It was almost like watching championship wrestling. Put your biases aside when watching the first film, the Japanese one, and you will see a horrifying story, one of death and chaos visiting a culture which was still trying to rebuild itself after experiencing unprecedented devastation not long before. The images of Tokyo's skyline in flames, looks like Los Angeles during the Rodney King riots, ten thousand fold. All kidding aside, it's a sad, gut-wrenching, horrifying piece of footage.

As for the product itself, it comes in a very nice package, a gatefold box which opens like a book, containing the two releases, side by side. To appreciate the 1954 Japanese release more, watch the 1956 American version first. As stated earlier, on its own, it's not a bad film. Then when you have time, check out the 1954 Japanese version. You'll see it's a much better film. Ironically, the American version of the film is of better quality, with less visual static. This is because when the original was edited, the film stock itself was damaged during the process and to clean it up, would have taken an excruciatingly long time, pricing it out of the market. The American footage, with Raymond Burr, was shot with similar film and methods, but with minimal damage, so, ironically, the ""blizzard"" effect is reduced in the not-so-good cut of the film. It would be nice, though, to have all the white blotches removed from both versions of the film.

2557891,5,B000FA4TLQ,"As a kid growing up I always looked forward to the monster movies. ""Godzilla"" was the ultimate monster, of course. What separated Godzilla from the other creatures bent on destruction was that this particular creature seemed to be out for revenge. He apparently did not take too kindly to being reawakened by atomic testing. Curiously, he took his revenge on the Japanese people, the very people who has suffered the most from the atomic bomb. Much has been made of the supposed symbolism employed in the original Japanese film ""Gojira"". In the original film it was supposedly made clear that the monster was, in fact, the product of atomic testing and in fact could be equated with the atomic bomb. Maybe yes, maybe no. He certainly leveled Tokyo as if he were a nuclear device.
  Surprisingly, watching ""Gojira"" is nothing like watching ""Godzilla"". Employing Raymond Burr was a stroke of genius on the part of the American producers. The feeling of hopelessness and helplessness is conveyed much more skillfully in the Americanized movie. Perhaps it's Burr's delivery that is so effective. Couple his somber deliberations with the Japanese funereal soundtrack and the viewer can easily relate to the utter hopelessness of the victims when confronted with an unfeeling, unrelenting destructive leviathan.
  Watch ""Gojira"" first and then ""Godzilla"". Marvel at the editing process, noting how Burr's scenes incorporating stand ins are skillfully interwoven with scenes from the original movie. Next appreciate how the editing process actually cleaned up and improved the Japanese version. The American version is shorter but not a single critical element was excised.

The director did an excellent job weaving the painful memories of WWII and creating a monster that would symbolize them.
Godzilla is grey like the smoke plume from a bomb, his growl eerily similar to the sound the bombers made who dropped them. His stomping sounds like the sounds the bombs make when they smash their target. The most powerful image was the atomic breath.
Godzilla, like war, isn't prejudiced when claiming its victims. From the soldiers to the innocent girl and her mother who are crushed in his wake.
The scientist Serizawa, looks like many who returned from war. In his case, he was missing an eye.
Honda beautifully wove these images giving us a stark reminder of war.
There is also love and sacrifice in this movie. Serizawa is in love with a woman, who is in love with a man in the navy. He must make the decision to put this all aside, to save his country and people and stop Godzilla's wrath.
Destroying any evidence of the oxygen destroyer, he sets out on his journey of sacrifice and delivers the weapon.
The film ends with the stark reminder, that it might happen again. Like war, there is never the certainty it will remain asleep.
The message of this movie resonates today, the fear of nuclear war.

So when the original film with subtitles and uncut was on DVD, I decided to try it.  I'm glad I did.

Like many have already said here, this is a surprisingly somber film, dark, ruminative, and melancholy, and it's also pretty terrifying, especially for its time.  This is a serious film.  There is no campy theatrics whatsoever in this film, and I found much of it scary, surprisingly sad and moving, and at times, thought provoking.  There are some cringe inducing moments with the special effects, which are quite dated and make the mistake of using minatures, which is really obvious in many of the scenes.  The performances are very good, especially the quietly powerful Takashi Shimura, who is famous for his appearances in Akira Kurosawa's films.  The dilemmas of the scientists and the government officials are handled in a complex, intelligent fashion, and the turmoil the scientist (who invented the ""oxygen destroyer"") goes through is very powerful indeed.  There is also a lot of pro-environment, anti-atomic bomb subtext going on here as well.  The main rampage of Godzilla is intense, along with the aftermath, which is reminiscent of a war zone.  The film has great, moody black and white photography, reminiscent of Mario Bava's black and white films, like Black Sunday.

On this DVD set, you get both the original film and the recut, redub Godzilla: King of the Monsters.  I haven't seen the recut/redub all the way through, but I honestly don't want to.  I already know they've butchered it, and I like the original very much, so I don't have an overriding need to see it.  So check out Gojira, and most of you who have a low opinion of Godzilla movies will be surprised at it.",1253577600,4,1982,4.839762611275964
2557909,4,B000FA4TLQ,"Not to make too much of it, but this version of the film has really good characters and rings a fearful echo of what Japan experienced during WWII.  The tone of the film is dark and foreboding, with normal people experiencing extraordinary fear.

There is a young couple whose relationship is secret, as the girl has been promised to a secretive scientist who rarely emerges from his laboratory.  Her father, also a scientist, is a distinguished paleontologist with an unusually open mind.  As Gojira suddenly appears, they are the ones who deal with him.  The monster's destruction, not to belabor the obvious, mirrors the recent destruction of Japan, both by fire bombs and the use of nuclear power (it disturbed the monster's habitat and scarred it).

What distinguishes this film are the thoughts of the scientists.  The paleontologist wants to study the monster, but helps the authorities.  The young scientist has discovered a new force of nature that he fears will be used by politicians for war; he shares the secret with his promised fiancee, who is horrified.  They actually discuss these issues, sometimes in a public forum with angry honest farm women, who argue that the truth must be told.  More thoughtful than your normal 50s monster flick!

OK, the effects are extremely clunky - my son and I laughed at the stiff rubber suit - but the emotional tone is consistent and perfectly executed.  In this, it is better than the original Raymond Burr version.  It was also the start of the distinctly Japanese monster flick, which had a very different sensibility than the more triumphant American ones.

I realized that this was made in 1954 when Japan was still rebuilding and Toho didn't have the resources to raise the technological bar for movie production.  But, I thought the special effects were reasonable.  The part I enjoyed most was the plot and the moral debates; this was obviously a protest movie.

The problem with protest movies comes when they are biased and purposely misconstrue facts to support the producers argument.

Gojira was originally supposed to be a giant Octopus actually. This has horror elements and was a serious monster movie. Its message has to do with nuclear war, basically he results of when Japan was nuked during WW2. I would recommend seeing the original Japanese version to get the full effect. The Raymond Burr version isn't bad, but there is way too much cut from the Japanese version of the film that it just becomes another monster movie. An all time favorite of mine,since I was a kid. Godzilla has been a part of my world seemingly for most of my life. Inspired in part by the Beast of 20,000 fathoms. The story here is outstanding as are the effects which still hold strong today. I cant recommend this high enough. They just cant make them like this. Ive seen Godzilla more times than any other Kaiju movie, including in theaters. Watch this and see why it was such a hit and was a serious movie. I would rather watching this movie non stop over and over for a whole month than watch something like Cloverfield or Gamera the Brave or some of those new CGI monster movies that are directed by people who don't understand the genre and by actors who cant act. Nothing can ever touch this movie except for movies of that era which include the Ray Harryhausen movies mainly.

2557926,4,B000FA4TLQ,"A huge, bloated, alien form moves across the Japanese landscape...

And that's just Raymond Burr. Godzilla is even more frightening.

I saw ""Godzilla -- King of the Montsters"" on its original US release, at the age of nine. It scared the crap out of me. I was particularly frightened by Godzilla peeking (peaking?) over the top of the mountain, and the final underwater scenes, where the monster disintegrates. These scenes -- as in ""Nosferatu"" and ""Vampyr"" -- evoked fright simply from their utter creepiness.

""Gojira/Godzilla"" lays on the atmosphere early and thick. The director knew it's hard to frighten people in broad daylight, so Gojira almost always wreaks havoc at night. The darkness also makes his glowing spinal plates plainly visible as he unleashes the worst case of bad breath in the history of the animal kingdom.

""Godzilla"" and ""Gojira"" are hardly the same film. Though the introduction of an American character -- Raymond Burr as the journalist Steve Martin (yes!) -- is a reasonable way to provide a point of view for Western audiences, the story is reduced to little more than a monster-gone-berserk scarefest.

The Japanese version is not so much about a monster attacking Tokyo, but the moral decisions the principal characters must make, most notably Serizawa, who doesn't want the world to know about the Oxygen Destroyer (a kind of reverse Ultra-Efferdent), the only weapon likely to do away with Gojira. (Yes, I know -- Gojira is an air-breathing creature, apparently without gills.)

The characters exist in a state of continual, but understated, anguish, particularly Emiko and Yamane, who wants to study Gojira to figure out why the animal was able to survive such a huge dose of radiation.

""Gojira"" owes a lot to ""King Kong"", especially the scene in which Gojira stomps the train. Let's be fair -- it's good, but not anywhere near the quality of the matching sequence with the big ape. And Yamane's original conception as a mysterious, cloaked figure who lived in a Gothic mansion bears a obvious similarity to Rotwang, the crazed magician/scientist in ""Metropolis"".

""Gojira"" is an obvious commentary on nuclear war (with the Oxygen Destroyer as the parallel WMD), while ""Godzilla"" jettisons this, leaving only an implied subtext. ""Gojira"" is a serious, verging on pretentious, monster film, which American audiences were not ready for in 1956. And probably still aren't.

One poster complained about the dirt and scratches. According to the (excellent) running commentary, the film _always_ looked like this. It was edited under dusty conditions, and the soft Japanese emulsions of that era were easily scratched, particularly in FX scenes where the negative had to make multiple passes through the optical printer. These problems are fixable, but there is so much dirt and so many scratches, the cost of removing them would have significantly bumped up the price of the transfer.",1229212800,4,2916,5.135021097046414

First of all, I've loved the original GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS since I was a kid.  It was the first Godzilla movie I ever saw, and I've been a big Godzilla fan and collector ever since.
Then, one day, I find out that the version of the film that I'd known and loved for years is actually not the original version; rather, a re-edit for American audiences.  And since every person I've ever spoken or been in contact with has told me that the Japanese version is infinately better, I couldn't wait to see it...unfortunately, I had to wait anyway, because finding it on video/DVD was damn near impossible for a very, very long time.
Finally, a deluxe edition of this movie was released on DVD for the film's 50th anniversary.  I eagerly popped the DVD in my player as soon as it came in the mail.  As the final credits rolled at the end of the film, I could only say one thing.
Holy crap.
First of all, let me just say that GOJIRA is way, WAY WAY WAY WAY better than GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS.  The Japanese original version is a lot more dramatic, tense, and most of all, scary.  It's a somber and serious movie about the horrors of nuclear weapons testing, with many levels of darkness and complexity that most giant monster movies from the era lack.
Aside from the movies, the DVD is awesome.  Both versions of the film, the Japanese and the American, are featured on seperate discs, both with individual special features and and commentaries.  The DVD package also comes with a booklet containing a short essay about the history of the film, written by Steve Ryfle.
Overall, if you love or even just like Godzilla or giant monster movies, or if you've never seen the original Japanese version, or even if you're just interested in film history, this DVD is definately worth picking up.",1219017600,,1809,4.52760736196319

2557950,5,B000FA4TLQ,"Godzilla, if anything, is a conundrum to the rest of the monster genre. Sure, the following sequels in the Heisei Series and the Millennium series were corny, but the original Godzilla captured something that few monster/science fiction movies have been able to achieve. Godzilla was a reaction to one of the world's most memorable devastation. With man creating so much havoc, would nature find a way to retaliate? Thus, the Japanese create Godzilla to showcase just how destructive man truly became on August 6th 1945. Sure, Ishiro Honda could've just made a documentary covering the bomb's atrocities, but instead he and Toho created something that was much more lasting. As Roger Ebert once said about the film, ""It was the Fahrenheit 9/11 of it's time."" As a child, I never understood the message sent from watching ""King of the Monsters"", but as an adult seeing this original, it is amazing how hard the message hits home. Few if any monster movies sent a message along for such an adventurous ride.

King Kong made you cry for the beast. Godzilla made you cry for the people. It showed a monster that had no remorse for its attacks. It was merely a creature lost in a civilization that it did not belong in. Godzilla represented something that was merciless and relentless all at the same time. This creature was not victim to the lady in distress like so many other monster films succeeded on at the time. The buildup for the creature was also artfully done. Much like King Kong, a lot of time is spent towards building up the creature and its myth. Given the special effects capability in 1954, the entire crew must be commended for an amazing job with set design and the suit. Obviously there are scenes in which the creature's head shape and body design change due to wiring or puppet work, but the main costume which stampedes the beach is still the best Godzilla suit to this day. Surely a guy in a costume cannot be menacing alone. Now a legend because of his bombastic themes, Akira Ifukube produces a menacing and yet simplistic score to really complement the monster. Much like John Williams's Jaws, Akira Ifukube creates a sound that really assembles the terror of the monster. From the stomping sound fx to the military battles, Akira's score is recognized just as much as the monster itself.

The biggest problem with the latter sequels of Godzilla was the inclusion of the human actors and their sub plot. Most of the subplots bordered between mediocre and flat out embarrassing (Megalon, Monster Zero, Terror of Mechagodzilla). Although not Oscar worthy by any stretch, this story produces a question of humanity that no other films dare to expand. Can a person do good with something that is only meant for evil? The character Dr. Daisuke Serizawa is faced with a horrible decision when his newly created weapon is the only hope to destroy Godzilla. If he uses this weapon against Godzilla, the possibility arises that the weapon could spark others to create the same destruction. Much like reality and the creation of the hydrogen bomb, humans create these weapons and say that it is for an overall good. The film really explores that such an idea cannot exist.

On top of all of these things is an entertaining movie. There is a reason that this film sparked a span of sequels rivaling only the 007 series. Godzilla will always remain one of my favorite childhood moments. The odd thing was Godzilla took you to a place outside of reality only to remind you of that reality. Like the Ogata states, ""You have your fears, which may become reality. And you have Godzilla, which is reality.""",1205366400,2,3612,4.757575757575758
2557951,5,B000FA4TLQ,"Way back in the early 1970's, I learned that the made-for-Japan original of Godzilla, actually named Gojira, was quite different from the Raymond Burr dubbing meant for America.  I had to wait nearly three decades to see Gojira.

Please forget the discussions of Gojira's political content, and try to ignore comparisons of the original versus the Raymond Burr version.

Gojira stands alone in world cinematic history.  The American version with Burr is also a very good movie that stands proudly on its own merits.

Two Japanese actors finally come to the forefront of movie history, Sachio Sakai and Gin Sugai.  Mr Sakai is the ever-present reporter who
ties together the many characters in this movie.  Raymond Burr basically plays Sakai in the American version.  You see Sakai in the 70th and 73rd minutes of the Burr version.  He is the guy on the left, kneeling with a flash camera.  Gojira made Sakai's career, and he went on to fame in Japan.  He lives on today, still acting from time to time.

Gin Sugai is the strident woman politician, pushing for full disclosure of Gojira's danger.  Her character is the social conscience of the movie.  She had an acting career before Gojira and an even more fulfilling career thereafter.  She still acts, a grand dame of Japan's movie industry.

The special features of both movie versions are packed with interesting factoids.  Don't be upset with the scratchy scenes in Gojira.  These scratches were also on the original prints, artifacts of extensive film retouching.  1954 technology required handling of the negatives directly, and film damage was inevitable.

For fans of the Godzilla series, Gojira is not like any of the other films.  The silliness of the later films is nowhere to be seen in this one.  In fact, Gojira does not even fit in the same genre as the rest of the series.  Gojira is a film that will truly make you think.  I know that sounds absurd seeing how this is essentially a monster movie, but the basic storyline is about disaster and being helpless against it.  There is also a very strong theme about nuclear warfare, particularly the US bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in WWII, although it is never mentioned directly.

In Gojira, Godzilla is not the giant, karate-performing savior of Japan that he becomes in the later films.  He is truly the villain of this movie, and he is as bad as any villains you will see in our modern films.  The attack on Tokyo that occurs around the mid point of the movie left me speechless.  All I could say is ""wow...""  The special effects during the attack are not particularly great, but they are very effective.  The black and white film and graininess add to the atmosphere of the scene, even though it wasn't intentionally made this way (it was all they had to work with).  It sort of feels like you are watching a WWII newsreel, only there is a giant lizard causing the mayhem.  Like another reviewer mentioned, there is a heartbreaking scene during this where a single mother is sitting on the floor crying, holding her two small children close to her, and telling them ""It is almost over.  We will be with your Daddy soon,"" as the city is destroyed all around her.  The very next scene shows the aftermath of Godzilla's attack on Tokyo.  It is nothing short of a nuclear holocaust, and it is obvious that is what the filmmakers intended.  In a crowded shelter, families are shown with their children looking shell-shocked.  The children are all staring off into space with a lost look on their faces.  I don't know what they did to get the children to look like that, but it is a very powerful scene.  Something you don't normally see in typical 50's movies.

If you are looking for a good exciting movie with a good dose of drama added in, I would recommend you watch Gojira.  It is a horror movie, war movie, disaster movie, drama, and tragedy all mixed together in one film.  You will not be disappointed!",1195344000,3,2581,4.508620689655173

And, having never seen the Japanese version before, I'm amazed by how realistically bleak the scenes of a devastated Tokyo are, and just how chilling a monster Godzilla is.

I did some research following the movie and found the radioactive fish were a real problem for them at the time. I also was amazed that I had gotten some of the emotional scenes wrong. Like the one where the girl is standing near the guard rail on the boat. I thought she was going to jump in the Godzilla one but in the original the subtitles explain it very well.

2557974,5,B000FA4TLQ,"I somehow predict that when I lay on the cozy leather couch in the office of an award winning psychiatrist (God willing) that one of the topics that will come up is my fascination with Godzilla or Gojira, as it is correctly to be pronounced. The original Gojira and its American Counterpart (Godzilla: King of the Monsters) is one of the movies that has impacted my life greatly.  I'm fully aware that they're shot on shoe-string budgets, using model train sets as cities, and star a man in a lumpy T-Rex suit, but that's what got me fascinated with Godzilla (Gojira) in the first place.

The year was 1994. I was four years old. I was too young for Pulp Fiction or Ed Wood Forest Gump, and born too late for the onslaught of movies from the 1980s. For me, 1994 was the summer of the VCR. My thinking memory capacity just kicked in and I had about twenty years of catch-up movie watching. My family had just gotten a Block Buster's Rental Card and began renting movies like crazy. I gorged myself and began to watch (mostly by accident) some of the greats. Jaws, The Star Wars Trilogy, The Indiana Jones Trilogy, Back to the Future, Batman, The War of the Worlds, E.T., Star Trek II. The geek inside me bloomed.

One Sunday afternoon my brother returned home from Block Buster Video with my dad just before my grandparents arrived for a Sunday Dinner of pasta and salad. My brother grabbed me by the hand and dragged me upstairs. ""Where are we going? What's that?"" He wouldn't answer. He brought me up to my room, closed the door, and turned on my small TV (which for a matter of fact was the only TV that had a VCR in it on the second floor of my house). He had something tucked under his arm. I couldn't read the box because I couldn't read, I think...

He popped in the cassette and fast-forwarded all the FBI Warning mumbo-jumbo. Then darkness. A black and white text popped up on the screen and a terrible roar followed. Then came the first shot and a voice broke through the eerie silence of a decimated city...

This is Tokyo. Once a city of six million people. What has happened here was caused by a force which up until a few days ago was entirely beyond the scope of Man's imagination. Tokyo, a smoldering memorial to the unknown, an unknown which at this very moment still prevails and could at any time lash out with its terrible destruction anywhere else in the world. There were once many people here who could've told of what they saw... now there are only a few. My name is Steve Martin. I am a foreign correspondent for United World News. I was headed for an assignment in Cairo, when I stopped off in Tokyo for a social; but it turned out to be a visit to the living HELL of another world.

I hung on every word Mr. Martin spoke to my brother and me. Being a reporter, his mission was to tell you what had happened to Tokyo and you would be wise to listen. The movie was dark and foreboding. I had already seen Jaws so I was already fascinated with unknown creatures lurking in the black icy depths of the ocean, biding its time. The monster finally appeared over the hill of the island and there he was, although I didn't know who he was, although after that moment I never forgot him. The monster rampages through Tokyo and reduces it to utter devastation. I'm entranced. Finally and reluctantly, a brilliant scientist with an eye-patch divulges his invention that could possibly destroy the monster. Steve Martin stands by and watches the event occur, surprisingly never writing anything down. They use the invention as a weapon on the monster but the heroic scientist doesn't make it out alive. The weapon begins to takes it's affect on the monster, and the monster rises up to the surface and cries out in pain, and defeat. The monster sinks to the ocean floor. I'm balling. Why? Why did the monster have to die? Many people cry when King Kong falls off the Empire State Building, I cried for the monster that fell to the ocean floor. That summer and that movie changed me forever.

The movie was ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" and the monster was Godzilla. Godzilla was unleashed upon American Shores in 1956; two years after the original Japanese Gojira had made its rampage overseas. The original was directed by Ishiro Honda and the Americanized version was directed by Terry Moore with Ramon Burr stuck in every once and a while.

Upon later viewings of the film, I am sad to say that the film just doesn't hold up. On it's own at least. The film has terrible dubbing which disgusts me for the simple fact that Akira Kurosawa films had been played countless times in the US but never had to succumb to awful dubbing by Hollywood's crop of dub-men. Men and women who were handed terribly translated scripts and spoke the lines in a bored, sterile, and emotionless fashion.

For the longest time I thought that the American Version was nearly identical to the original in length, pacing, and mood. Until my brother came home from work and gave me an issue of G-Fan; an all Godzilla Magazine and something I never in my life time would have ever thought existed. I opened up the magazine and found an article in about the original Gojira and its comparisons to the film ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms."" I was surprised to find that I had never seen any of the images printed from Gojira in the magazine before. Then it hit me: there must be more footage in the Japanese Version! But unfortunately I still had to deal with the fact that original would be forever out of my grasp. But as months rolled by and I kept reading the magazine, I started to get impatient.

For too long was the American version the only available one to see in the US of A. Then, on a Saturday even in 2004, I found a trailer for the re-release of the original Gojira in select theaters nationwide! Uncensored, Uncut, UNDUBBED!!!!!

I skipped school one day and went to see the movie in Manhattan with my brother and my mother. It was playing in a quaint little theater in the Union Square area called Cinema Village. We went and bought our tickets, got some gummy bears, twizzlers, and good `n' plenty and entered the theater. The seats were small and uncomfortable and the screen was just a little bigger than my TV at home, but I didn't care. I was going to see the original Godzilla - Gojira - and nothing was going to ruin it for me. The theater darkened and the projector rattled alive and brought forth its luminous cinematic light. The movie started. The Gojira title came up in Japanese as Akira Ifukube's score piped through. I was born again.

Suffice to say, the original Gojira is a masterpiece in the science fiction genre but also in Japanese Cinema. It tells an allegorical tale of the horror of the atomic bomb through a gigantic monster that destroys everything and everyone in its path. The movie is darker both in pacing and in theme than its American Counterpart. It is an excellent film to be viewed by fans of the giant monster genre and science fiction genre. The film has an amazing monster like ""King Kong"" and a cautionary lesson like ""The Day the Earth Stood Still.""

The DVD itself has many interesting special features including commentaries by Steve Ryfle and Ed Godziszewski and videos on the Story Development of Godzilla and the making of the suit. Must see special features for die hard G-Fans or anyone who is just curious to see how the story originated out or how they made the suit.

If you are looking for a movie is provocative but is humble enough to have a man in a suit to portray its villain, I say to you, go out and buy Gojira on DVD. You get both the original and you get the skim plus American version. If you're looking for some good ole cheesy atomic age fun, then pick up Gojira on DVD and you'll get both movies. Two different movies, yet the same movie, and equally important to me. This DVD set is a blessing sent from the gods at Classic Media and Toho. I strongly urge any Godzilla fan that has not seen this version to go out and do so immediately. You are not complete until you have seen it. Then and only then will you not only be a fully rounded Godzilla fan but also a Gojira fan.",1180915200,6,8145,4.454057679409792
2557985,1,B000FA4TLQ,"The idea behind this offering is superb - supply both the familiar, edited and reworked, American version of GOJIRA (called GODZILLA, KING OF THE MONSTERS) together with a subtitled print of the previously hard-to-find Japanese original, on separate discs in one package, so that everyone from the film scholar to the most casually curious fan can compare the two versions for a modest price.

Unfortunately, both resulting DVDs are of inferior quality, amateurishly contrasty, being very dark in the night-for-night exteriors and night-lit special effects material - a goodly part of both versions - and showing little more than a variety of black blobs moving about in all such scenes.  Additionally, the narrow and closely-spaced font used for the yellow subtitles, causes many of them to strobe and distort beyond readibility in the lighter shots when passing over detailed backgrounds.  Topping that off, the ""restoration"" of the GODZILLA credits is very badly done and not complete at all:  the openings credits (TransWorld logo and star/directors screens) are still missing, and the end credits are clearly spliced in from a different, widescreen, source, then letterboxed (the rest of the film isn't even window-boxed) and placed, incorrectly, after ""The End"" instead of before it.

Admittedly, it's the only such package in town, and the official one; but it is just not up to the pro and fan publicity it has been getting in either the restoration or the technical department.  It is strictly another ""caveat emptor"" situation and, while I do not know if anyone else will try/be able to get these two titles out in better shape, I cannot in all honesty recommend this product and will be returning mine for a refund, making do with what I have of the two features on videotape.",1179878400,14,1787,5.061224489795919

Also the anti war theme especially the reference to the H bomb and Nagaski were drastically cut down for the american version to speed up the movie.

How wonderful to see the original movie and realize that far from being a kitschy ""monster movie,"" it's a wonderfully written, directed and acted film.

The decision to use a person in a rubber suit rather than stop-gap animation really paid off, although it was made, according to the booklet attached, due to time constraints.

The American version, in comparison to the Japanese original, is really a horrible butcher job, but is funny to watch after seeing the original to see how they chopped it up and pasted in Raymond Burr and actors showing only their backs to portray the original characters.  I laughed out loud several times at how hackneyed it is, so for my money having a great film coupled with a laugh-out-loud remake of it is a real bargain!

2557989,3,B000FA4TLQ,"...Just got through watching Gojira. Yes it's a great movie, well worth watching, and a relief to hear in the original Japanese. BUT:

1.) The film is very badly speckled, and with so many atmospheric night scenes, this really got in the way of my enjoyment. Once Gojira is crashing through Tokyo, no problem; but in the many scenes leading up to this, the speckles are a major distraction. They also hamper the climax, which takes place underwater.

2.) The subtitles are a very pale yellow and quite thin. Against the sharp black and white background, they're tough to read. My wife and I were reading them out loud to each other, which severely undermined our ability to focus on, say, the actors and their facial expressions.

3.) Fullscreen presentation, as opposed to widescreen. Maybe this is the ratio in which it was released? I don't know, but I have to think not.

Great movie, but for the price you're paying for the ""Deluxe Collector's"" blah blah, I think it should have been done better. Compare this to, say, Universal's Classic Sci-Fi Ultimate Collection, which presents 5 similar-era movie in crystalline clarity for about the same price. Don't get me wrong: I have plenty of those 50-movie packs and am NOT a diehard fan of ""digital remastering,"" whatever that is.

2557990,5,B000FA4TLQ,"After fifty years, we Americans can see the original version of this film and in the same package, get the American version to compare to it.  Unlike some of the others, I do not necessarily think that the American version was ""just another lowbrow monster movie"". If you look closely, you can see that even cramped for time and money, the american adaptors produced a work of art in its own right.  And, it is clear that the Americans took a great deal of trouble to make sure that the original anti-nuclear message came through loud and clear.

  Perhaps to understand this clearly, you had to have lived in the early fifties as a child. To have shivered every time an airplane passed over for fear it was a bomber. To have seen the yellow and black signs in every store and public building pointing the way to a supposedly safe shelter in case of nuclear attack. To have practised hiding under your desk.  And, worst of all, To have known that all of these precautions would actually be worthless if the Bomb hit within five miles of you.

  The anti-nuclear message in the American movie was quite subtle, But to our generation, it was clear. It had to be subtle, Joe McCarthy might be gone, but his toadies and allies were still around and just as nasty as ever. To make an open anti-nuclear statement was a one way ticket to the blacklist, so the adaptors used a series of clearly recognisable visual referents to get it across.

  To start with, the director opened with a scene of a flattened, burnt out city.  To anyone of my generation, that scene was a clear duplicate of one we had seen in newsreels, television documentaries, and magazines.  The first time I saw it cross the screen, one word popped into my mind..""Hiroshima!"".  Others might have thought ""Nagasaki"", but to anyone of my generation, it clearly showed a city that had suffered a nuclear attack. We knew that traditional bombing, (even firestorm bombing), earthquakes, even tornadoes, leaves some walls standing. Only an atom bomb flattens everything in sight.

  Then there was a brief glimpse of Raymond Burr trying to crawl out of a collapsed building.

  Then the director hammered home the nuclear reference. We pan to a scene of an emergency hospital that has been set up in what clearly was a building built for some other purpose. (subliminal message: the actual hospital has been destroyed or simply too full to handle the huge crowds of injured people.) We then see a doctor examining a dazed little girl. A technician holds a geiger counter up to the girl, and we hear it buzzing. Every person in the theater knew that the buzzing told of a fatal dose of radiation. We did not need the doctors sad look and brief shake of his head. We knew that the little girl was doomed to a horrible lingering death, and even if she survived, she would be hideously scarred for life. Without saying a single word, this scene was the most powerful anti-war and anti-nuclear statement ever filmed. The only one that had even come close before was the service in the bombed church from ""Mrs Miniver"". No scene in any film made since has surpassed it.

  Now here is the significant fact.  It was the American director who placed this powerful anti-war passage at the opening of the movie.  The Japanese version opened with a different scene. The Japanese opening had an anti-nuclear significance to the japanese, but since the story of the Lucky Dragon #5 had been suppressed in American newspapers, It would have meant nothing to us.( The story of Lucky Dragon #5 is described in the commentaries on the Gojira disk.)  Clearly, the American director had moved the blasted city and dying child scenes to the front in order to retain the anti-war theme of the original.  (In the japanese version, it appears near the end of the movie, at the beginning of act III.)

  The commentators make a big thing about how the American version ""watered down"" the nuclear references, But, to us living at the time, the message came across clearly.  It said just as clear as a bell, ""When we set off atomic bombs, we release forces that we do not really understand, and if we continue, it is only a matter of time until we release one that will destroy us."" Even though a few of the quotes from the japanese version may have been lost, enough were carried over to bring the message across.  Both Gojira and Godzilla stand up as powerful cries against the nuclear fever of the time.

  And let us not forget the ""oxygen Destroyer"".  Although it was thinly disguised in the script as some kind of chemical process, nobody was really fooled.  We all realised that this process, which was so horrible that Dr. Serizawa destroyed his life's work and committed Seppuku to prevent its release to the world, had to be, in reality (at least, in the subjective reality of the story), some kind of nuclear device.

  Gojira/Godzilla even after fifty years and so many silly sequels remains a classic, not just because of its special effects, or the fact that it is a well told action story, But because it was a cry for restraint against the headlong race into nuclear disaster that was to dominate the nightmares of three generations and whose shadow still hangs over us to this day.",1174608000,6,5230,4.635179153094462

While it is hard to really suspend disbelief when you see the walking latex monster close up in either version, the story and the tone of the Japanese version go far towards overcoming the campy monster flick vibe that the U.S. version borders on, and the subsequent sequels appear to have embraced.  While the visuals are quite remarkable considering the budgetary and time constraints the film was working under, the filmmakers wisely chose to make  the film more about the atmosphere and to emphasize the parallels with atomic weaponry.  Still, there are several scenes in both versions, especially a major scene of destruction in Tokyo, that have such powerful resonance with scenes of nuclear destruction that the artificiality of the visuals is overcome.  Sound plays an essential role in this -- if the look alone of the monster is not enough to frighten the sounds he makes are chilling, both otherworldly and primal.

This is a great looking set, that should be an essential collector's item for any film buff, but at a price that would be hard to pass up for even the casual fan.  It is both a groundbreaking monster film, and an important Japanese film.  The image looks very good, and the sound is stunning.

The opportunity to compare and contrast the two versions of Godzilla (Gojira) is something not to be missed.  It's a real education on how a film is constructed and the viewer will learn much.  The two films evoke very different emotional responses.  ""Godzilla-King of the Monsters"" is a noisy, campy and ""scary"" trip back to the golden age of the ""giant mutant creature"" movies of the 50's. Gojira is also frightning, perhaps even more so.  In addition it has unexpected depth, emerging as  a thoughtful, rather sad and poignent essay on alienation, displacement and self sacrifice.  The extras are entertaining and informative and the two films sport different full-length feature commentaries that are entertaining and informational at the same time.

Of the two films, Gojira is the better.  Released in the early 50's, it amazingly looks ten to fifteen years ahead of it's time.  The crisp cinematography and austere (rather than cheap) sets contribute to this, as does the musical score . . . but mostly it is due to the non-cliche' script.  Yes, yes, I know. . . Big Lizard stomps Tokyo, how cliche' can it get . . . but somehow it manages to transcend the ""50's monster movie"" look and plot turns and emerges as a serious, tragic and genuinely scary film over 50 years after it's release.

2558033,5,B000FA4TLQ,"Well, here it is.  After over 50 years, the original un-Americanized, un-dubbed, un-pipe-smoking-Raymond-Burrified incarnation of the film that turned a big rubber lizard into an international icon is finally available stateside.  So is Gojira really worth the wait and the expense of a two-disc set?
The answer is: you'd better believe it.
If you're part of that group that likes your Japanese monster movies repackaged complete with somewhat-erratic dubbing, then this set includes the U.S. release with the future Perry Mason playing a newsman named Steve Martin (unfortunately, there are no banjos, fake arrows through the head, or groovin' tunes about Tutankhamen here).  As explained rather plainly in the film's audio commentary, the writers (the identities of whom are thoroughly debated in the commentary) and director Terry Morse had a helluva time trying to finagle Burr's scenes into this film, and cut out a good portion of the original to do it, but the result meshes rather well for a film of its era.  I won't give away the plot, since anyone with a half a brain in their head reading this review right now could probably guess it, but Godzilla: King Of The Monsters still has a certain charm all these decades later, and remains one of the most sober entries in what would come to be a intense, colorful series as the years went by.
However, the REAL gem of this set is Gojira (strange to be called that, since the Japanese translation of Big G's name in the subtitles IS Godzilla).  Directed by Ishiro Honda, Gojira has more going for it than just a longer running time.  And if your only image of Godzilla is a campy, silly monster who frequently tag-teams with a giant moth and has been known to use his fire breath as a source of propulsion, then you NEED to see Gojira to see what Godzilla was really intended to be.
Gojira is a very dark and bleak sci-fi movie made not by the crassly exploitative Hollywood types of the era, but by filmmakers who still had the horror of Hiroshima and Nagasaki burning feverishly in their memories.  This was nearly ten years after WWII, and that is a fact that is very much in evidence in this original incarnation of Godzilla.  It's not enough that we see this giant monster smashing and burning Tokyo into ruin - we get something in bargain that very, very few movies of this nature have ever bothered to address: the human suffering.  There are genuinely heartbreaking moments throughout the film, and the thick of Godzilla's rampage is only a part of the territory this aspect of the film reaches.  Every element of Gojira reflects the experiences of filmmakers who lived under the terrible shadow of nuclear annhiliation: Honda was a veteran whose journey back through the devastated lands following the war inspired much of the anguished aftermath of Godzilla's attack; FX supervisor Eiji Tsuburaya came from a long background of producing war training films with highly-detailed miniatures; and producer Tomoyuki Tanaka based the idea of the film partially on the tragedy of the Lucky Dragon, a Japanese fishing vessel irradiated by the fallout of U.S. nuke testing.
This is not the upbeat monster movie featured on Disc Two.
Apart from the stark, grave, almost documentary-like presentation of events that unfolds around the film's titular menace (beautifully abetted by composer Akira Ifukube's melancholy music score), Gojira is rare in the '50s sci-fi movie pantheon in that the human element of the drama - fleshed out, as is typical of these films, by a handful of foreground human characters - is not only excellently portrayed but is done so in a way that establishes it to be critical to the overall climax of the film.  There is a secret affair between young lovers Ogata (Akira Takarada) and Emiko (Momoko Kochi); there is the odd-man-out betrothed Serizawa (Akihiko Hirata) who torturously carries a secret that could either save the world or destroy it; there is conflict between Emiko's father Dr. Yamane (Takashi Shimura) and Ogata over saving the last survivor of its species or eradicating it before it destroys all of humankind...all expertly interwoven on a level that simply is not seen in any American sci-fi film of the era.  When their worlds and that of Godzilla inevitably collide for the film's final resolution, the ending carries an emotional punch that very few other sci-fi movies of the decade have, and certainly not something to be expected after decades of duking it out with the likes of Ghidorah, Gigan, or Mechagodzilla.
In addition to the two versions of the film, there are the usual theatrical trailers, also some audio commentaries by Godzilla enthusiasts Steve Ryfle and Ed Godziszewski (gotta love that name) that are informative if a bit monotonous at times, and even a couple of featurettes briefly discussing the processes by which Honda and writers Shigeru Kayama and Takeo Murata crafted the film's intricate story, and one detailing the trial-and-error creation of the first Godzilla suit and the travails Tsuburaya faced bringing the monster to life in front of the cameras.  All of this makes for a film that could very well qualify to be one of the Top 10 Sci-Fi Movies of All Time, in my opinion...and I mean without Burr smoking his pipe.
In closing, the Gojira 2-Disc Set is a must for any Godzilla fan, any fan of foreign films, any fan of giant monster movies, and...well..just buy it already.",1164931200,6,5415,4.9049180327868855
2558034,4,B000FA4TLQ,"It's a strange and almost unnoticed fact that the two Japanese films of 1954 that put Japanese cinema at its most poetic and its most populist on the international map both starred Takashi Shimura. The same year he led a group of Ronin to defend a poor village for Akira Kurosawa he was also trying to unravel the mystery of Gojira, only to get sidelined in the US version of the film in favor of a not exactly seamlessly edited in Raymond Burr. The new Region 1 NTSC DVD of Godzilla in both its incarnations is a nice presentation of a movie that isn't quite as good as you'd like it to be but still isn't bad for all that.

While the Japanese version, with its heavy Hiroshima and Nagasaki allegorical overtones, is the better film, the American version isn't exactly negligible. Restructuring the film's timeframe, beginning in the aftermath of the destruction of Tokyo and framing much of the film as a flashback to explain the need for narration, it sidelines the nuclear subplot but still offers much of the flavor of the original, as well as offering a couple of bizarrely charming moments of camp from Raymond Burr: it's almost worth it for the little look he gives the security officer in the helicopter.

Picture quality on the Japanese version is sadly not as good as the US version, but it's more than acceptable for all that.",1164758400,5,1338,4.594142259414226

The Good is.....
BOTH VERSIONS TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST TIME
 Watching both versions together as one experiance can put an end to debate. Though the commentaries may contrast them, viewed together one need not compare. Both versions are great. So, why argue. Youv'e got it all in your hand. Together they are now as one.
JAPANESE VERSION
First Time on home video in US.
AMERICAN VERSION
Has ""lost"" end credits, never before on video added.
Picture quality looks pretty good. Sharper than earlier releases as far as I can tell. (I wear glasses, so judge for youself.

THE BOX
This ""Clamshell"" container is gorgeous. The black color portrays the mood of the film.
MENUS Very nice also.

The Bad is.....
JAPANESE VERSION
Appears slightly cropped. some parts of picture hard to see. Also scratchier than US Theatrical release of two years ago. Definately an inferior print.
AMERICAN VERSION
missing original opening ""TRANSWORLD"" logo visible on previous DVD release.
AMERICAN TRAILER
incomplete. Only half a trailer. First half and last few seconds missing.
you can get the uncut version on a DVD called ""ALL MONSTERS ATTACK""
THE TITLE
Calling the DVD ""GOJIRA"" is just silly. Bound to create unneccesary confusion. GODZILLA is his offiocial translated name.  It IS translated from Japanese. It is simply a different pronunciation in a different dialect. But it is certainly more accurate than calling it Gojira since this is not Tohos chosen official translation. Only the
pronunciation, GOD-zilla can be considered innacurate. IT is GO-DZEE-LA. Say the D and Z together tilit has a kind of a J sound to it and then say the L part like you are saying L and R at the same time and you have it. It is not GO-jeer-ah as it was pronounced in the Mathew Broderick movie.  If you speak english than his name is GODZILLA. It is not a bastardization like Gigantis or something. It is the official English translation of hios Japanese name. So don't think you are being sophisticated or continental by saying GOJIRA.

COMMENTARIES
Very infomative but redundant, make that very redundant at times,  It best to have an outline or script ready for these things, Guys. Some interesting concepts are introduced. Such as, the theory that the american version
tried to cover up the H-Bomb connection. This seams like a new notion as I have never heard this discussed before in any publication about the film. But I think its basically BS. They are trying to make the americanization
of the film seem controversial , and thats really reaching. I saw this film when I was 9 and immediately knew that Godzilla was an ""atomic"" monster. I knew it before the movie started. Everyone knows that. Every freakin' movie that came out in the fifties had a monster spawned by H bomb tests. Its implied. Its easy to forget even that some, such as Tarantula, weren't H bomb monster movies .  The more I ponder it the stupider this arguement seems. Yet it is brought up again and again in the commentary track. I guess its filler.

2558051,5,B000FA4TLQ,"I've longed to see ""Gojira,"" the original Japanese version of ""Godzilla"" for years and now, finally, it arrives on these shores. The framing story is basically the same as the Raymond Burr movie I grew up with, but the tone of the movie is so much more serious with the original referring to atomic testing and war. The scenes of Gojira's destruction of cities cannot help but recall footage of the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. There are also scenes with doctors detecting radiation on children in the hospital, a child crying for her dead mother, and a mother cuddling her two children as Gojira approaches, telling them that they're about to join their father. All this and more gives ""Gojira"" much more gravity and, quite frankly, better quality than the Americanized version. Don't get me wrong, I'll always dig the Burr version, but the newly-released original can be truly called a classic.

There is also much more screen-time given to the characters of Serizawa and Yamane. Serizawa is shown having much more agony over his decision whether or not to use his invention to save Japan, but, here again the implications of atomic weaponry is revealed. Yamane is given more scenes where he bemoans the fact that Gojira is to be destroyed and not studied.

All that said, Gojira IS a monster film, no doubt. There is various footage I don't recall from the Burr version (I haven't watched the second disc yet), such as Gojira taking biting snaps at a clock tower he destroys; the creature attacking a tower where reporters are gathered (the scene is in the other version, but I don't recall Gojira chewing on the tower!); and if my memory serves, more Army scenes where Gojira takes cannon shots to the chest. He just seems so much more bestial here. The extras are very cool with features on the origins of the story and the making of the suit.

I must say that there is a ton of artifacts and snow on the film. I know it's from 1954 but couldn't they have cleaned it up a bit better? I don't recall the Japanese footage in the Burr version having so many lines and snow. I'll have to look at it, and my DVD of ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" to compare. That said, even with the grain, this is a must-buy for any Godzilla fan, any fan of Japanese cinema, or any straight-up movie lover.

With more footage, one notices that the male romantic lead is pretty hot. The extras, especially the one about the special effects, are very interesting. Of course, the Raymond Burr version is included, so it's all the Godzilla movies I'll ever need. It makes an interesting comparison between this and Harryhausen's movie. Both use dinosaurs as metaphors for the A-Bomb, but Ray's movie is from the point-of-view of the country that dropped the bomb on others - shake it off! - while Godzilla is from the point-of-view of the people who were actually nuked, so they take it far more seriously.

2558057,5,B000FA4TLQ,"There are plenty of reviews already about the issuing of the ""original"" Godzilla in this excellent two DVD set from Sony.  I will only add what has not already been said.

Gojira was the original kaiji eiga (that is the Japanese phrase for ""monster movie""), the first of what became 25 Godzilla films (to date).  While the original film had a dark heart and serious intent, a lot of often silly films followed--although in the most recent film (Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidora), it came full circle: Godzilla becomes the embodiment of the souls of everyone who died in Asia during World War Two, with Godzilla attacking Japan as a punishment for its war crimes.

Surprised?  Gojira was made key members of Kurosawa's crew.  It was co-written and directed by his second unit director and lifelong friend, Ishiro Honda.  Takashi Shimura, the actor who portrayed the master Samurai who recruited the other six, also starred in Gojira.

The Americanization of Gojira, to make it more ""commercial"" to US audience, was very well done.  Terry Morse, the US director, did excellent work, especially given around forty minutes of the original were cut out, and twenty new minutes inserted. Raymond Burr provided a white American anchor for the US audience, his voice over narration helping bridge the massive cuts.  Burr's footage was a legendary rush job--supposedly all of his scenes were shot in a single day, although that seems unlikely.

Ishiro Honda, who directed and co-wrote Gojira, was a soldier in the Japanese army during the Second World War.  He saw first-hand the devastation wrought on Hiroshima by the atomic bomb, and for years wanted to direct a film showing the horror of atomic war and the dangers of nuclear testing.  He was given the opportunity to go ape on nukes by, ironically, the Americans--via the very successful re-release of King Kong.  That success was very much on the mind of a Toho producer who had a production gap to fill, and who decided to try a monster movie.  He commissioned a screenplay that was based on The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms, an early Ray Harryhausen classic that was a big follow-up hit to King Kong.

Ishiro Honda grabbed the opportunity with both hands.  With another writer he reworked the original commissioned script, adding his themes on nuclear testing and atomic warfare.  Gojira became a prehistoric beast mutated by atomic testing.  The devastation of Hiroshima served as the visual template for the monster's attack on Tokyo.

Unlike the American films of the Fifties (The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, Them!), atomic testing was not simply a plot device.  Gojira was the physical embodiment of the atomic bomb.  He had atomic breath.  He created fire.  He devastated buildings.  He left radiation sickness in his wake.  Hospitals were filled--as with Hiroshima--his victims.  All of this was deliberate.  And the film itself was done in a somber style, using one of Japan's best classical music composers to create a memorable score.

How aware were the American producers of the atomic testing and environmental issues?  Probably not very.  Their cutting of some scenes, which emphasized Honda's themes, were probably for commercial reasons, not political ones.  Just to make the film move faster.  For example, they cut one scene where riders on a commuter train commented that with Gojira attacking they would have to ""go down into the shelters again"", a direct reference to World War Two.  But they did leave in the references to Godzilla being a product of atomic testing.  One interesting brief scene in Gojira illustrates the complexity of the original in its themes: the Japanese scientist with the eye patch, who creates the oxygen destroyer that kills Gojira, denies to a reporter that he had any contact with German scientists.  But most of what hit the floor was character development, not politics.

That is because the American version leaves the key scenes.  Probably, again, because they did not really realize what those scenes showed.

For example, at the very beginning of both versions is a scene where a Japanese freighter is attacked by Godzilla, who is under the water and not seen--instead there is a white hot flare up from under the water which destroys the freighter.  Americans would not have understood the significance of the scene, but it was not lost on the Japanese audience.

On March 1, 1954, the US tested the first Hydrogen Bomb in the Marshall Islands.  The Daigo Fukuryo Maru (""The Lucky Dragon"", a tragic misnomer) was fishing for tuna in the area.  While the US had warned Americans in the area about the test, somehow they failed to warn the Japanese.  The crew were close enough to see the blast and be covered with radioactive fallout.  Aikichi Kuboyama, the ship's radio operator, died from radiation sickness on September 23, 1954, becoming the first (and apparently only) victim of the Hydrogen Bomb.

Kuboyama lingered for a long time, in part because the Americans did not completely inform his doctors on how to treat him properly.  His illness and death were front page news in Japan for many months.  Japanese audiences knew exactly what the opening scene of the freighter meant--Gojira was released three months after his death.

Ironically, the Japanese and Honda himself eventually  forgot their very serious concerns.  Gojira was a big hit, as was, even in Japan, the American version.  Gradually  Godzilla became a commercial juggernaut who, to make money, was eventually played for laughs...completing Gojira's Americanization.

First, it is dark and, at times, confusing and we get bits and pieces of the monster as it slowly comes to light but it is mostly the helplessness in seeing something so powerful that there is nothing you can do to stop it...and its coming your way.

2558076,5,B000FA4TLQ,"For sci-fi fans like me, this recent release of the Gojira/Godzilla DVD set has been a long-awaited event.  Now, at long last, we are able to see the original Gojira film and compare it with the Godzilla Hollywood version which we all grew up watching.  And here I thought I knew this movie...

When Nabokov shared his manuscript of Lolita with his friend Edmund Wilson and asked Wilson what he thought of it, Wilson's reply was: ""Bury it under a rock for a thousand years.""  That would have been great advice to the producers of the Hollywood version of this film.

I watched the Hollywood release on this DVD before viewing the original Gojira, and for me, after viewing both versions, the addition of the Raymond Burr character to the original film and his endless voice-over narrations throughout the Hollywood version turned a fairly good movie into something quite bad and boring.  A movie properly driven by plot and dialogue had been reduced mostly to a guy speaking into a tape recorder's microphone...

What were those Hollywood producers thinking in the mid-1950s when they chose to do such a hatchet job on Gojira?  Certainly they believed that American audiences would not relate to a film drama involving only Japanese characters, and so they introduced an American character into the film: Raymond Burr.  Given how soon after the end of WWII this film had been released, and the still-strong anti-Japanese sentiment alive all throughout America, it's no surprise that Hollywood producers chose this tactic.

From what I can remember from my childhood viewings of Godzilla, I of course had no problem at all with such political decisions, and I absolutely loved the movie every time I saw it.  But now, how it pales to the original!",1161043200,9,1746,4.884745762711864
2558077,5,B000FA4TLQ,"Before buying this 2 disc DVD,I've read the reviews of the fans and the majority of them praise 'Gojira'  and mock the American version with Raymond Burr. After viewing the original Japanese version (which I belive is excellent), I find the comparison reviews narrow minded and disapointing. These folks are sophisticated and savy and have always known they can watch their tapes and DVD's over and over and pick apart anything they see. This must make them feel important but the opinions I've read on the comparison of the 2 films is unfair. I wasn't born in 1956 when the original U.S. version was released. I saw it in 1968 when I was 7 years old on 'Creature Feature' and I remember exactly what I said when it was over: ""Godzilla is my new favorite Monster"". Raymond Burr's 'Flashback' narrations give the film a documentary feel which is abscent from the Toho version. The American version is ""different"", not ""worse"". The anti-nuclear approach in the original film is ""great"", but it's not ""better"". And as for the techniques used to blend the 2 films, I think they were pretty damn clever and not ameturish in the least bit. Please buy this DVD; watch and love both versions....you'll thank me.",1160524800,7,1203,4.755980861244019
2558078,4,B000FA4TLQ,"Like most Godzilla fans in the U.S., my first exposure to the original film was the heavily edited version with Raymond Burr. Even as a child, I knew something wasn't right and that that version looked sloppy and chopped-up. Now, thankfully, we can see Godzilla (who in the Japanese version isn't ""King of the Monsters"") without the bad dubbing and Raymond Burr and with many scenes cut out of the U.S. version.

Burr's presence in the original is a major distraction. Since the U.S. producers couldn't cut any footage of Eiji Tsuburaya's special effects and maintain the film's appeal to American audiences, they instead relegated the characters of Dr. Yamane, Emiko Yamane, Ogata and Serizawa to background supporting players. Whereas these characters look like they're reacting to the monster, Burr, in contrast, looks like he's bored and waiting for Perry Mason to begin production. The extras hired to portray Japanese in the added scenes with Burr are even worse. They look like they're trying to stifle yawns. The original puts the characters in the forefront of the story where they belong. Takashi Shimura (the dying man in Kurosawa's Ikiru), Momoko Koichi, Akira Takarada and Akihiko Hirata give fine performances -- especially when they don't have to compete with the clunky added footage of Burr.

Ishiro Honda conceived of Godzilla as a strong anti-nuclear, anti-war film. However, when the American producers re-edited the film, they removed the film's political overtones, turning it into more of a straightforward monster film along the lines of It Came From Beneath the Sea or The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms. In the U.S. version, the impact of the final scene is blunted when Burr declares that now that Godzilla is dead, the world can start to live again. In the Japanese original, the ending is much more unsettling with Shimura's Dr. Yamane declaring that if nuclear weapons continue to be used, another Godzilla may appear to wreak havoc on civilization.

It may seem somewhat ridiculous to heap such importance on a Godzilla film. However, the original was a sober, serious and even depressing indictment of the arms race. Whereas some of the later films had bad special effects and stupid, juvenille humor, the original Godzilla had an important message. Watch the unedited Japanese version and you'll never be able to watch the U.S. version again.

2558080,5,B000FA4TLQ,"I think sony wonder did a great job with this release of Gojira. People  should realize that the quality of film in japan during the early 1950s was very obsolete compard to hollywood at this time. Keep in mind that gojira was made for a fraction of the cost of hollywood monster movies in the early to mid 1950s like The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms, War of the worlds and even The Invasion of the Body Snatchers etc. Japan was only a few years removed from the hiroshima and nagasaki bombings and were in a slow rebuilding stage. Japanese directors had to make the most from obsolete film and technology as compared to hollywood. Sony Wonder did the best they could with the this poor quality film of Gojira. I believe a high definition version of Gojira would yeild very little improvement in the film to dvd transfer. An hd version of Gojira would be simply to make more money for sony, for a dvd release of Gojira you already own with this current release. King Kong (1933) on dvd has a much better looking tranfer than Gojira (1954)released twentyone years after Kong. This should tell you that the quality of film was very obsolete in japan during the early 1950s. The dvd extras were more than enough and you should be happy with what is on this dvd. The voice commentary with the film is really informative and interesting. You also see the end credits which I have never seen in all the times I have seen the original Gojira. The booklet explains alot with plenty of Gojira information. The japanese version was a treat to watch for the first time. The american version with Raymond Burr footage added in later for the american release actually had Burr speaking some really good dialouge, thanks to script writer Terry Morse. The scene that really stood with me well after I first saw Godzilla was the scene of dr. Sarizawas first demonstration of the oxygen destroyer in the fish tank with Emiko. Sarizawa holding Emiko back from the test tank as the oxygen destroyer went off the fish turned to bones, Emiko let out a real terrified scream that stays with me till this day. Akira Ifakubes music score with the oxygen destroyer demonstration scene was mind boggeling. That tight violin scramble and as the oxygen destroyer went off in the fish tank a (powerful piano key.......... BOOM!) awesome and unbelievably effective. Eiji Tsuburoyas special effects for gojira are amazing for such obsolete limited technolgy he had available to him. Inshiro Honda had a dream and was up against alot in post wwII japan with Gojira and amazingly Honda pulled this film off. Gojira had a very dark post war, anti nuclear weapon feel to it, but Gojira really showed japan as it was during the early post wwII 1950s.  Honda made you really feel and see the people suffering as Gojira devestates thier beloved japan. Akira Ifakubes awesome music score made up for the limited technology that was used in Gojira. Ifakube also used musical instruments to make Godzillas famous roar, Ifakube had some imagination, most geniuses do.  This soundtrack is a work of genius, just like all of ifakubes later Godzilla scores.  Gojira belongs up there with all the american monster movie legends.",1159747200,3,3179,4.7328519855595665

2558087,5,B000FA4TLQ,"Being a Godzilla fan since the age of eight, I have been waiting for this moment for the past ten years once I found out that the version with Raymond Burr was not the true version of the film. While the Burr version is a good one, I kept hearing that it didn't quite capture the horror and the emotion that the original version had. I must say this is very true.

After watching the film, the Americanization of the cut out most of the raw emotions the Japanese felt during that period and how much they despised nuclear weaponry.

The movie moves at a brisk pace to begin with but, unfortunately, the emotion is not as strong in the first part as it is in the second part. It also begins to slow a bit with quite a few human scenes that, sometimes, are kind of pointless and don't do much to help the film. This film is a little over twenty minutes longer than the Americanization and it shows between the two films. I must say, for more action in a shorter period of time, the Americanization (which is included in this set) is your film of choice. The Japanese version is more emotional and is able to throw a point across that is absent in the American version. Both are good in their own ways and bad in their own ways as well.

However, the Japanese version seems more novel and not like some monster-on-the-loose film the American version portrays it to be. Some nice extras are included here such as a commentary by Godzilla experts/lifelong fans and a theatrical trailer.

The romantic storyline is almost completely lost or mis-understood in the Raymond Burr version made for American Audiences and for someone like me, who had never seen the Japanese original, this was a real break! The Japanese version has great writing and storyline progression and makes a tremendous amount of sense as well as a more highbrow approach to the script.

 first off the original japanese godzilla is slightly longer,but  its still fun. i know this might upset some people out there  but you have to READ the english subtitles.. reading is  a part of life.  as for the american version, it  has perry mason himself raymond burr playing reporter steve martin who is at the frontline of godzilla's  first ever rampage on tokyo.

the dvd quality is excellent, but sometimes there are a few spots here and there, but i think it adds to the charm of this film afterall, its in glorious black and white.  overall the remastering is good.

now down to the  extras  i wish there was more, but what we are given will satisfy any fan  ..you get a interesting documentary on the making of the gozailla suit..a documentary on the storywritng,and the trailers for both versions..ive never saw the trailer, so this was a welcomed  sight for me..

also as a extra bonus  it comes with a nice booklet containing lots of interesting information on the film  such as the original color for godzilla was not green but dark charcoal.

overall im very happy with this dvd, i don't know why some people over critique  on this  release..its fantastic.. finally i can get rid of my  old worn out  grainy copy of this  film and have a pristine, digital remastered copy..  hearing godzilla's roar  after all these years is still exciting.

also, i would like to say the ""man in the suit ""godzilla is far superior to that 1990s remake where godzilla was this skinny,long legged  thing..they had a good idea, but botched it up  stick to the classics guys..

also, i would like to say, that if you loved this film...by all means pick up a copy of Godzilla 1985..that is the direct sequel to this film..all the other gozills films did not count in the timeline..now im hoping  toho studios will release that one onto dvd as well..

so sit back, relax, and take a trip back to odo island and get re introduced to the big guy..its going to be a wild ride!",1157673600,7,2291,4.4914841849148415
2558102,3,B000FA4TLQ,"The new DVD release of ""Gojira"" and ""Godzilla..."" is disappointing in terms of video quality. White specks of all sizes almost continually pop up, giving the effect of trying to watch the film through a ""shower curtain"" of video ""noise.""

If I had not seen and did not already own an ""unofficial"" DVD of ""Gojira,"" perhaps I wouldn't have been so let down. But the picture quality of the ""bootleg"" DVD (possibly from laserdisc, I don't know the source for sure) is MILES above Sony's new release.

Had Sony Video spent ONE-TENTH as much money cleaning up and restoring the print they used for the DVD that they must have spent on the fancy (admittedly very nice) packaging for the set, they could have given this classic film the kind of treatment it deserves.

The Japanese version of the film (""Gojira"") is a MUCH more atmospheric and ""artistic"" experience than the Americanized Raymond Burr version. It is unfortunate that poor video quality mars that experience, particularly as better-quality versions already exist.

Even with all this said, if you've never seen ""Gojira"" then by all means buy this set. I promise you, you will love it! I usually watch it with no subtitles, and I don't speak a word of Japanese.

2558103,5,B000FA4TLQ,"For fans of both giant monster movies and Japanese cinema, this is a landmark release.  Forget what you think you know about Godzilla movies.  This film is 100% cheese free.  Its serious in tone throughout, and is definately not a children's film.  To fully appreciate the film's message, you must remember that this film was only released 9 years after the end of the war.  Its understandable, though unfortunate, that the U.S. butchered this film before releasing it in the states.  Its unashamably anti-nuke, and it came out at a time when the insanity known as ""mutually assured destruction"" was considered sound foreign policy.

At the heart of this film is the same moral delimma that Oppenheimer and Truman faced near the end of the war: whether or not its right to use an ""ultimate weapon"" for the sake of expediancy, even though doing so will open up a Pandora's Box which could ultimately lead to the destruction of us all.

In the tradition of great Japanese films such as ""The Seven Samurai"", victory ultimately comes at a heavy, almost unbearable price.  The final ironic twist is that the sacrifice might end up having been in vain.

This is a wonderful film.  Its more than a monster movie; much, much more.  Its a serious drama with a serious message.  The production values and the performances are outstanding.  If you haven't seen the Japanese version, then you haven't seen ""Godzilla"". Its amazing (and sad) that the ""message"" of the film is just as relevant today as it was in 1954.",1157673600,3,1503,4.7528957528957525
2558104,5,B000FA4TLQ,"If you've spent years wishing for a quality US release of Gojira, your long wait is over. Sony Classic Media has finally done justice to the world's most famous giant radioactive lizard.

This is one of the all-time monster classics, responsible for spawning a half-century of sequels (although none of them as starkly effective as the original). Unlike later movies where Gojira becomes the friend of children, this version is much darker, and the only way Gojira helps anyone is by sending them to the next world. The scenes where the monster destroys Tokyo in a sea of flames are genuinely disturbing. These images certainly resonated with a citizenry that had survived massive firebombings and two atomic bombs. The Oxygen Destroyer weapon (created by the iconic Dr. Serizawa) looks like something that might have come out of Los Alamos.

While I can't say how this transfer compares to other DVD versions of the movie, it looks pretty good to me. Images are generally clean and bright, with good contrast throughout. There is a problem with speckles, which becomes more apparent during the nighttime scenes and with some of the stock footage. On the good side, this version has a 4:3 aspect ratio, which means you get to see the top of Gojira's head (Rialto's recent release was in fake widescreen, which cut off the top part of many scenes). The subtitle translation from the Rialto version has been toned down, losing a reference to the atomic bombing of Nagasaki. The subtitles are all spelled correctly, but the letters are often too close together, especially when an ""O"" follows an ""L"" (""trilobite"" looks like ""tribbite"").

Even the 1956 version of the film looks good. The new footage appears to have been contrast balanced to better match the original movie. (I had a video release several years back where the difference between the two film prints was like night and day.) While it's no secret the American version is weaker than the Japanese original, it's not entirely bad. Some scenes actually have better pacing, particularly Godzilla's appearance atop Odo Island. However, all of the scenes where Steve Martin interacts with the characters from the original movie (stand-ins are used) are painful to watch; the phone conversation with Dr. Serizawa is comically bad. Also, the voice actor dubbing Takashi Shimura is awful, and simply cannot say the word ""phenomenon"" correctly. Luckily, Akira Ifukube's groundbreaking score was also used in the American version of Godzilla.

While I haven't played the commentaries, the two documentaries are informative, especially the one on the creation of the Gojira suit. Both films also include their respective trailers. Interestingly, the Japanese version concentrates more on the characters, while the U.S. trailer is all about the monster. The packaging is very well-designed, and includes a nice booklet. It's all just the thing for passing some time on Monster Island.",1157587200,22,2933,5.116910229645094
2558105,5,B000FA4TLQ,"I love Godzilla movies!! First off let me just say that this movie (take it for how it is) is awesome. After watching the original Japanese version of the film I think it is way superior to the raping it got from U.S. distributors. This film, starring Takashi Shimura (also known as a favorite for Akira Kurosawa's films) is a dark, true horror film set of the dangers of atomic weaponry and stands as an post-atomic age film. One of the best known movie monsters of all time comes to life! The story wraps in drama, love and horror from the king of the monsters all wrapped in one. The musical score (done by the great Akira Ifukube) shines and creates a dark and dramatic atmosphere to a true classic horror film. Finally, we see the real deal! Given that Toho only gave Ishiro Honda and his crew 3 months for pre-production, production and post-production essentially completing the film on a very tight schedule, I really appreciate the efforts they all gave in viewing the final product. The visual and special effects are excusable, mainly because of the tight production schedule and the fact that this is a 50's film, but in my opinion they are good for the times. It is a true stand-out and one of the best G films. I can't wait for November for the rest to be released! This one's for Tomoyuki Tanaka, Ishiro Honda, Eiji Tsuburaya and Akira Ifukube, the true creators of Godzilla!",1157587200,4,1390,4.564
2558106,5,B000FA4TLQ,"From the opening credits with only Godzilla's roar, I knew that this wasn't going to be the same as the American version I have seen all of the years I have been a fan of Godzilla. Just from the beginning, it gave a really dark presence and sets up the viewer perfectly and lets us know that we are about to see something very serious and nothing to laugh about.

The story is in one word, incredible. The tone is dark and the images and the messages used are a constant reminder of how terrifying and monstrous Godzilla is to these people in this movie. There are many scenes that are in this original version that were left out of the American version that really left some images engraved in my mind. One of the most chilling scenes is when Godzilla is attacking Japan, a woman and her children are huddled together in fear and the mother is saying to her children ""Don't worry, we will be together soon with daddy"". Meaning that they would soon be in Heaven. There are many other scenes like that one.

Many, many things are finally restored in this movie that was left out of the American version. There is such a difference between the two versions; the Japanese story is almost completely different from the American one. The DVD box that this film is in is amazing in itself; it opens up like a book and is also hardcover as if it were a book. It comes with the American and Japanese versions of the film so you can compare the two. It also has a 16 page book as well! Overall, this is a have to have for those who have never seen the original version. It is simply amazing and it will give you a new look on Godzilla.",1157587200,5,1626,4.275974025974026
2558107,4,B000FA4TLQ,"When I heard about this film finally being made available in its original form, it was immediately placed on my ""must buy"" list. That said, here are a few things the buyer may want to know when purchasing:

The subtitles are not the same as the ones used in the Rialto Pictures theatrical release of the film from two years ago. Frankly, I liked the Rialto translations better. I get the feeling that they were more accurate. These English translations seem to gloss over certain subjects, the most glaring to me being the train passengers discussing surviving Hiroshima/Nagasaki. I noticed no mention of this in these subtitles, but I remember Nagasaki was mentioned by name in the Rialto subtitles.

Another thing to note is that the subtitles can be turned on and off, but they are hard to read. A heavier, better font would have been preferable.

I was actually hoping that this film's presentation would be akin to the DVD release of CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON. That DVD had the original soundtrack, subtitles that could be turned on and off, as well as an alternative English soundtrack. I was hoping GOJIRA might have a new English soundtrack for those who don't like to ""read the movie,"" but this is not available. Also, this disc is marketed in North America, but no French or Spanish subtitles are part of the package. I suspect this may be due to the lack of true accuracy in the English subtitle translations.

The special features are sparse, but they at least treat the film with respect and offer valuable information into the development of the film and the title character. Any prior releases of the film in its Americanized version have treated the film as mere schlock. Oh, and the Americanized version is in this package, too, but there is one difference: this version actually has end credits! In 30 years, I've never seen end credits for Godzilla, King of the Monsters.

Film quality was not a major concern to me at this time. What I wanted was the Japanese version of the movie, and that's what I got. Experience should tell us that if the consumer demand warrants it, this film will be released again with more features and a digitally cleaned up print.",1157500800,17,2182,4.716535433070866
2558108,4,B000FA4TLQ,"OK........I've just finished watching this newly released DVD of the original Godzilla. First: It's about d@mn time this film made it here, officially, in its Japanese form. For that I am grateful. I've had a number of import releases and bootlegs of this film over the years and this is one of the better prints. The overall look seems crisper than some of the more washed out versions I've had.  BUT....BUT...BUT....that is not to say this print here in this two disc set is prestine. Like the other comments that mention how scratchy & speckled this film is in many places....well....it's true. The box reads ""Native Hi-Def Masters from 35MM Print"". Now, I'm not at all too knowledgable about the specs on Hi-Def....but it just seems so unbelieveable that this was released as a Hi-Def print considering how jacked up it is. Are we to appreciate the speckling and such better with it in uber-clear form? BLEH! It doesn't even take close inspection to see that there doesn't seem to be -ANY- kind of restoration done to this print, which is unfortunate, because when you first get this set, the whole package is fantastically done, you really do get the impression that you're about to see a print like what they came up with for KING KONG '33 or even METROPOLIS considering the presentation is awesome. But no such luck.

The two DVD's are housed in a glossy-ish book style case.... like the Universal Monster Legacy set. Inside, you have the films on seperate discs. DISC ONE: The original film and Special Features. I haven't made it through the commentary yet and probably won't for awhile. But the one feature on the creation of the suit was pretty informative. The second piece on the evolution of the story was just as interesting, though in both, the narrator could've sounded a little less like he was reading off of a script. But still fun nonetheless (hey, fans gotta b' and moan;-) And if you're the narrator reading this, hey, I liked what ya did....just pep it up a tiny bit in places in the next release;-). Also, I noticed this film is cropped just a fraction tighter in the r & l sides of the frame than the other imports that I have. The difference is slight but it is there.  On the 2nd disc is the Bradbury/American version and a coinciding commentary. The same lack of restoration seems apparent here, though it is much better IMO than the Simitar version. Also included is a cool thick booklet on the original Godzilla film with even more insight. Overall, the packaging was well thought out and is an excellent lesson to filmmakers and studios who can't get their  **** together and just release both versions of the same film in one d@mn package so fans have a choice (no names of other Sci-Fi films here...*ahem*ahem*). THIS, is how classic films should be packaged.

Of course, if you are a fan of the classics, as said, you know that this is one of those films that took forever to make to American shores in DVD form (officially, that is). So with that in mind, no one can really complain that it is now here and available. But the downside is....I would have taken mediocre packaging to get a better restored film...& gawd forbid, I'd even take a (the mind boggles! the throat tightens!) but I'd take a cardboard snap case to get a cleaner print of this. I mean really.....it's not like we're asking for a restored print of KING KONG ESCAPES........this is the Grandaddy of them all and it deserved a better considering its legacy. But regardless, THANX to the powers that be for at least giving us this, I'm still quite excited to add this to the collection here. Maybe we'll get a true restoration when the real HD version is released years from now......and maybe someone will give a d@mn about cleaning this JP masterpiece up then. Until then....enjoy this one!",1157414400,14,3796,4.651266766020864
2558119,5,B000FA4TLQ,"The original, 1954 Japanese version of Godzilla is surely my favorite monster movie ever. Maybe even my favorite movie ever. While most westerners equate Godzilla movies with hokey monsters, model cities, and bad dubbing, the original Japanese film transcends the genre that birthed it, and in its day, transformed that genre into something altogether new and different. Countless words have been written about Godzilla being a metaphor for the nuclear horror Japan experienced at the close of World War II, so I'll not belabor that point. While the U.S. version, with its added footage of Raymond Burr, retained at least a portion of the original's power, the Japanese version may be viewed through the same ""serious"" lens one would view Japanese classics such as Seven Samurai, Rashomon, and Ikiru, and find it in no way wanting. Despite some crudities in its special effects, the film's grimness and documentary-style narrative imbues it with a sense of real-world horror that no other monster film, Japanese or otherwise, has ever achieved. Its limited U.S. theatrical release in the early 2000s received almost unanimous accolades from critics, and in a sense, opened a lot of eyes to a product that most American viewers only thought they knew.

The intersecting stories of Emiko Yamane (Momoko Kochi), Ogata (Akira Takarada), and Dr. Serizawa (Akihiko Hirata) propel the drama, but Godzilla is the fourth character in this relationship, affecting and influencing the human characters' every decision. Emiko and Serizawa are engaged, their marriage having been arranged when they were young; however, Emiko and Ogata are in love and wish to marry, but both have deep feelings for Serizawa and have no desire to hurt him. Serizawa, in his scientific research, has discovered an unusual energy force with the power to destroy oxygen molecules, and his dilemma is whether to use it against the monster and risk it falling into the hands of politicians -- the one thing he fears more than Godzilla -- or allow Godzilla to trample Japan unimpeded. It's his sense of honor as well as his compassion for Ogata and Emiko that motivate him to make the decision he does.

Tangential to the ""love triangle"" is the character of Dr. Yamane, Emiko's father and Japan's preeminent paleontologist, who fervently opposes the government's position that Godzilla must be destroyed, preferring that the monster be studied for its unique in its ability to survive both untold millions of years as well as massive doses of radiation from hydrogen bomb tests. Yamane is less susceptible than Serizawa to Ogata and Emiko's efforts to convince him that Godzilla must be destroyed, despite his recognition of the fact that Godzilla might inflict upon Japan a nuclear holocaust far worse than Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Only toward the end, after Tokyo has been reduced to ashes, does he appear to be reconciled to the destruction of the greatest laboratory sample the world has ever produced.

The American version retains the better part of the original plot, but too much of the character development has been edited out to make room for Raymond Burr for the story to come across as more than melodrama. That's not to say the scenes with Raymond Burr, directed by Terry Morse, are totally superfluous; certainly, for American audiences of the day, relatively soon after World War II, having a recognizable American star to participate in the drama, in effect becoming the audiences' eyes and ears, served to make the original Japanese story more palatable. While the added scenes are occasionally too obvious -- especially when stand-ins are used for the original Japanese actors -- they are played very straight, and oftentimes blend in surprisingly well. For all its flaws, the Americanization did allow much of the original to remain undubbed, and Burr's scenes occasionally add an additional touch of suspense, such as during the storm when Godzilla first appears on Odo Island.

While most American audiences would probably never know the difference, Godzilla's rampage in the original Japanese version is far superior, in that Tokyo has been wonderfully reproduced in miniature, with Godzilla making a logical and accurate progression through the city. To Japanese audiences, the reshuffled scenes must appear quite confusing. Having Godzilla attack at night was a wise move, since the darkness adds immeasurably to the sense of menace and also offers the practical advantage of concealing flaws in the effects. Regardless, Eiji Tsuburaya's work in this film is masterful, particularly when one considers the limited budget, the time constraints, and the fact that it was all new and largely experimental at the time.

Akira Ifukube scored the film and also created the ominous sound effects for Godzilla's roar and footsteps. Many of the themes that fans explicitly identify with Godzilla originated in this film, and it's all the more remarkable that Ifukube composed the score without having seen a frame of film. He was instructed to write music for ""something big."" I believe he succeeded beyond anyone's wildest expecations.

The Classic Media presentation is easily the best of their Godzilla DVD series. The Japanese and U.S. versions come on two separate discs, and each has an excellent commentary track by Steve Ryfle and Ed Godziszewski. Extra features include a documentary on the making of the Godzilla suit, a documentary on the development of the original story, trailers, and a 12-page booklet with an essay by Steve Ryfle.

Top recommendation.",1157414400,2,5546,5.183035714285714
2558120,2,B000FA4TLQ,"Yes, the original GOJIRA is one of the finest movies ever made, and yes, it's exciting that American audiences can finally get their hands on it.  Legitimately.  But the quality of the print they used in this release is just plain awful.  In addition to the scratches you would expect from a 52-year-old film, it's full of white spots flashing all over the screen throughout the entire movie.  It's like watching the film through an endless firefly storm.  After hearing all the glowing praise about the Rialto print released in theaters in 2004, this piss-poor print seems even MORE disappointing.  I've seen bootleg copies of DVD releases of this film from other countries, and they were all much better quality prints than this.  I can't believe that Sony Classics would use such a bad print to digitally remaster the film--in high definition, no less-for the DVD release.  What were they thinking?

NOTE: The two stars result from this:  The movie itself, 5 stars.  The quality of this DVD release, 0 stars.",1157414400,18,1011,4.853801169590644
2558121,4,B000FA4TLQ,"One of the most popular movie monsters in the world comes to DVD. When several ships mysteriously disappear off the coast of Japan, authorities discover the existence of a 400-foot dinosaur that breaths radioactive fire. Spawned by recent atomic testing, the towering beast threatens to destroy the entire world.  The DVD includes the original 1954 Japanese classic ""Gojira"" and the 1956 Americanized version ""Godzilla, King of the Monsters"". ""Gojira"" is a well paced creature feature that shares many similarities with the 1953 hit classic ""The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms"". The film's special effects are pretty crude but its message of the dangers of atomic testing is explicit. The classic Sci-Fi feature was a big success in Japan and launched countless sequels and remakes that turned Godzilla into one of the most recognizable icons of Japanese pop culture. For wide release in the United States, the Sci-Fi feature was edited with extra footage featuring Raymond Burr (TV's Perry Mason) and retitled ""Godzilla, King of the Monsters"".

For serious fans of the popular Japanese monster, ""Goyira"" Deluxe Collector's Edition is an absolute purchase. Both the Japanese and American versions are presented in their original full screen format. Despite some scratches and visible dust, the picture quality is better than I've expected. Its simple 2.0 Dolby Digital audio is fairly decent. The 2-Disc Deluxe Edition includes audio commentaries by experts about Godzilla and other Japanese movies, two short featurettes and original movie trailers. Overall, ""Gojira"" Deluxe Edition gets a ""B"".",1157414400,18,1590,5.433198380566802
2558122,4,B000FA4TLQ,"The only reason I didn't give this set five stars, is that neither of the films has been restored to the standards of what we have come to expect of special edition DVDs ( see the restored 1933 ""King Kong"" for an example ) . Both prints show wear, emulsion lines, dirt and lots of sparkle, but considering the rarity of the source material, that is to be expected. I can also see a certain amount of charm in the flaws myself.

However, don't let the somewhat less than perfect quality of the films put you off from buying what has been a holy grail for Godzilla fans for years.

The commentary tracks on both films are insightful and informative, and the two featurettes on the creation of the story and the making of the suit are interesting and include some wonderful behind-the-scenes artwork and stills. My only negative comment on those would be that the commentary and the featurettes often cover the same information, making them seem a bit redundant at times, but they contain enough differences to keep them from being boring.

The packaging is tasteful and respectful. More of these films should be restored this way.",1157155200,9,1128,4.658291457286432
2558123,5,B000FA4TLQ,"The titles roll with the titular monster's famous roar, and the stage is set for the best Godzilla movie yet.  In this 2 disc set, there is the Japenese classic and the American original.  In both, there is the radioactive monster, but the Japenese version has passion and a mood.  In Gojira, Godzilla is a metaphor, and a very powerrful one at that.  But in the American version, he is just another monster that destroys things.  In the Japenese version, there are great scenes in whcih Dr. Serizawa ponders whether he should use his weapon, fearing the consequences.  But the Aemrican version edited all of those scenes out and inputted the lumbering destructive creature known as Raymond Burr.  Burr's scenes are well done, but seem too out of place.  Watch both movies and judge for yourself.  The stars i gave this movie are for the orignal Godzilla ONLY!  The american version gets 2 stars.  Add one star if you like midless destruction.

While there are some interesting Godzilla movies out there, they are all science fiction. The original movie, although unrealistic, was in no way science fiction. It was more of a cry out against nuclear warfare.

First off, the language quality is awesome, it's in Japanese which makes it so much more the better.  The American version was about 55 minutes--WAY to short to enjoy Gojira and the message the movie is trying to send.  But the Japanese version is about 95 minutes!! That's the perfect amount of time.  Anyone who has seen this will instantly know what I mean.  The acting is superb--extremely realistic (aren't all Japanese good actors?!)

When it was relased in the U.S., it was butchered, altered and changed into an average science fiction film with Raymond Burr fill-ins. He wasn't even in the original film. The original ""Gojira"" is a sci-fi/horror masterpiece. The film creates feelings of dread and sorrow. The ""original"" version is a much darker, sinister film. AWESOME! The film also focuses more on the suffering of the Japanese people during the atomic age. The film makes you feel their tension and suffering. There is one scene where Gojira is staring at a big ben style clock. He is staring at it for no apparent reason. The scene makes you wonder what Gojira is thinking at the time. Then, for no reason, he tries to take a bite out of it. That scene alone changes the feeling of the film to something more than a lumbering beast destroying everything. MUST SEE!

Well....... FINALLY the rest of you are going to get introduced to the REAL Godzilla (Gojira) after a horrendously agonizingly long wait. But Me? I'm the impatient type. I couldn't wait for the American market to make up its mind as to when (or ""if"") they would release this ORIGINAL masterpiece, so years ago I gave my monopoly money to the good folks across the Pacific in AUSTRALIA and delighted in the exclusive privilege of being able to enjoy what was kept from American eyes for over 5 decades. I'd enjoyed it even more based on the seemingly impossible fact that I had likewise never seen the Americanized bastardization of this film, called ""GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS"", until after I had watched my ""Region-4"" DVD from Australia which contained both ""versions"" of this film. Because of this unbelievable fact, I think I have a very unique and special appreciation for the original film that others in the U.S. may not.

In any case, you are all in for quite a treat, to be sure -- and no doubt you, too, will be scratching your heads wondering how this magnificent film degraded into the ""camp-&-cheese"" kiddie-fare puke we're all familiar with.
