8531238,5,B008VU2O2I,"Fred McDowell was one of the true finds of The Great Folk Scare.  This is foundational slide playing, very melodic, with a hypnotic driving groove.  This lesson, another great one from Tom Feldman and the SGGW team, breaks down Fred's songs phrase by phrase and shows you how to get that deep McDowell groove.  These pieces are a lot of fun to play and gave me a fresh appreciation of his work.  If you are at all into McDowell, or folks like  RL Burnside, Kenny Brown, & the No. Country All-stars, this is a lesson for you.",1405728000,4,524,4.360824742268041
