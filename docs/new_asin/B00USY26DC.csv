8708216,2,B00USY26DC,"I purchased this item on Blu-ray from a local store.  On the back of the package, the sound format is claimed to be PCM stereo.  However, when the disc is played, Dolby Digital is the only audio format available, and I find the sound quality unacceptably poor.  The video is also not up to the usual quality of Blu-ray releases.  I can't comment on the quality of the performances because I won't be able to watch the complete program, the audio quality is so bad.  I'll try to return this due to the inaccurate labeling of the audio format.",1439683200,,541,4.424242424242424

8708218,5,B00USY26DC,"I just saw two clips by Delos on Youtube and Dinara Alieva is beginning to peak wonderfully.

AND as I have written here before, SHE is the next ""Grand Diva"" and the closest ""Dramatic Soprano"" we will ever get to ""Maria Callas"".

HOPE The Metropolitan Opera Is Paying Attention!

UPDATE: THE Program on this DVD is Absolutely Brilliant with many favorite Songs in Italian, French, Spanish, Russian and the American Classics not to mention the exceptional ""Sound and Acoustics"" of the Moscow Conservatory with the formidable Russian National Orchestra and of course the World Class Grand Choir, Masters of Choral Singing.",1428796800,4,620,5.118811881188119
