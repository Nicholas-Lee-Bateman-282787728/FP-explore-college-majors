3797297,2,B001U7NVW6,"Just finished watching this with my 2 year old Barney fanatic daughter.  I bought it thinking it would get into more of the process of going on vacation, maybe explore some different locales, etc.  It's more like a 51 minute episode about how butterflies go south for the winter, which bums Baby Bop out, because ""Monty"" the butterfly is her friend.  So, true to BB form, she whines and complains and the whole gang ends up going to ""Mexico"" (which is actually just a shabbily decorated set) to find the other butterflies which Monty somehow got separated from.  The whole thing kind of lost me as about 5 minutes in, I started to sing a little non-Barney song in my head.  My daughter lost interest, too, which is odd.  The movie, from what I could gather, is about butterflies, and sort of Mexico.  And the word vacation was used, but not in the context that I expected.  For a more ""adventury"" type story, we liked ""Barney Celebrating around the World"" much better.  Save your money, you can learn as much Spanish from an episode of ""Dora.""",1244592000,6,1043,4.564516129032258

8343056,4,B001U7NVW6,"This is a Pretty decent Barney video. It's one of the longest length I have found for the kindle & the price was great. My daughter LOVES Barney, so this was.  Great download to have for road trips & waiting rooms. I would have given it 5 stars yet the video quality isn't so great. It's reminiscent of VHS quality. It didn't bother my kid at all, but this was noticeable to me.",1380758400,,378,4.178082191780822
8343057,4,B001U7NVW6,Once again barney captures my kids attention while teaching them new things. They loved this episode. They sat and watched from start to finish.  The sang along the whole time.,1375660800,,176,4.866666666666666
8343058,4,B001U7NVW6,It's Barney....can't expect too much but my kid loves it! Songs are a bit goofy but that's to be expected. Just sing along and have fun with your kid.,1369785600,,150,4.206896551724138
8343059,2,B001U7NVW6,It was a good program except the quality of the movie was grainy.  Other than that my daughter enjoyed watching it.,1362787200,2,115,4.476190476190476
8343060,5,B001U7NVW6,My middle daughter loves Barney and this did not disappoint.  Run of the mill Barney that will not disappoint your daughter or son either.,1362441600,2,138,4.75
8343061,3,B001U7NVW6,"I wouldn't put this at the top of the list for Barney Lovers....however the hat on Barney should have given the spanish theme away. They do emphasize on using spanish in the video and defining english/spanish words which is pretty neat.  I would have to say that I thought vacation would have maybe meant a few other places and information about those places....as some episodes that I have seen on tv. I just thought it might involve traveling on a plane or in a car...learning transporation means per say. Was expecting more but Barney didn't deliver on this one. My daughter still enjoys the siging and there isn't a whole lot of dancing on this video so would you want to absolutely have this in your childs collection, NO.",1267315200,3,727,4.635658914728682
