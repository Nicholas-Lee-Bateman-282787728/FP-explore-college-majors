3067985,5,B0011UKORC,I agree with the first reviewer--bring out all seasons of the Bob Newhart Show before moving on to Newhart.  Although I was not even born when this show first came on television--I watched re-runs as a little girl and have absolutely fallen in love with the show as an adult.  I have faithfully bought all the seasons and have been anxiously awaiting the remaining seasons.  Bob Newart and all the cast members of this show have no equal.  Bring back the Doc!!!,1199404800,17,461,4.585365853658536
3067986,5,B0011UKORC,"The rest of it, that's what! Can the remaining seasons of the Chicago show please be released before switching to Vermont? I think that the folks at Fox need the professional services of Dr. Bob Hartley! Perhaps a temporary boycott of the newer sitcom is in order (even though it's a great show too!) until we have all of the original BOB on DVD.",1199318400,75,346,4.421875
3067987,4,B0011UKORC,"The show deserves 5 stars but Fox's mistreatment made me knock off a star!

Fox Video department sucks. Our only hope is for Shout to get access to selling the show! Not Echo Bridge or Mill creek where they will proceed to stuff every episode on to as few discs as possible and the quality will suffer immensely!

The only thing worse than Disney aquiring Marvel is FOX owning the entire MTM catalog of great shows from the seventies and eighties! Wheres the rest of the seasons of emmy winning series St. Elsewhere and hill Street Blues? It's sacriligeous!",1376179200,4,557,4.616161616161616
3067988,5,B0011UKORC,"I ordered season five and six in November 2011 hoping that Amazon's listing meant it was going to be released. So please Fox, just release them! This is a classic show with many fans. I actually bought an illegal copy from a website advertised on Amazon.ca, because I thought it meant they were only being released all together. It proved to be a bootleg collection of the whole show. Even having that I ordered season five and six because I want to see them all, and pay for them legitimately. What else can Fox ask of the fans of this show?",1375228800,5,542,4.376237623762377

3067991,5,B0011UKORC,"This is disgraceful how FOX is treating its customers by not releasing season 5 and 6 of The Bob Newhart Show.  I purchased season 1,2,3, and 4.  Why not release the last two.  Same thing with Hill Street Blues.  I own season 1 and 2, but, Fox will not release the last 5 seasons.  I have been on the preorder list well over a year and nothing.  FOX took my money  for the first 4 seasons, with promises of releases of all the seasons.  Now here we are still waiting, probably never to see either series to be finished on DVD ever.  These are the finest shows ever produced, and FOX is doing this.  Sell the rights to Shout Factory.  Shout Factory will treat the both series and the fans the right way and release all seasons.  FOX is disgraceful.  I for one will never buy another FOX product until The Bob Newhart Show and Hill Street Blues fans are treated the right way.",1369267200,6,874,4.2560975609756095
3067992,5,B0011UKORC,"ok so I shelled out the moola for season 1 through 4 and feel cheated by being forbidden from seeing the last two seasons. I would do the pre order but why should I trust in the fact that these dvd's will ever be released? I've read that we should all do the pre order in order to show that there is enough interest in the last two seasons to release them, but I don't think it is right of amazon to continue to give false hope so I probably won't and will just keep checking in from time to time and if it ever shows a release date I'll jump on board then.

3067994,3,B0011UKORC,"I believe the reason it's taking so long to get THE BOB NEWHART SHOW season 5 and 6 is that the powers that be are waiting to see how many pre-orders come in. This way they will know whether or not it will be profitable enough to go to the expense of issuing the seasons.
The more pre-orders that come in....the more likely it is that it will be released. Soooooo.....send in those orders. It costs NOTHING to order!!!!!!!",1356825600,7,422,4.3544303797468356

A Sept. 30, 2011 update to my original post below:
Unfortunately, just got some bad news on the release of Seasons 5 and 6 of The Bob Newhart Show, folks.
I checked in with the 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment exec who's been the point person on this, and I was told that the releases are on hold because of the dreaded musical clearance issues, and that a holiday rollout won't happen.
 The shred of good news is that I asked point-blank if that meant the releases were off, and the exec said right now it's a ""delay"" and that they are ""working on other solutions.""
I said I'd check back in a few months, but that I knew a lot of people were not going to be pleased, and that if we don't end up getting the final two seasons after strong indications that we would, people would be even more unhappy.
So I guess we just have to wait and see, hoping for the best, and if the process does come to a halt decide what we want to do then.
Hope some of you will be with me if we need to mobilize!

Hey fellow Bob Newhart Show fans.
I've been on a crusade recently to get Seasons 5 and 6 released, contacting various bigwigs at 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, and I just received this email:
----
Your email was forwarded to me as I understand you're interested in the 2 remaining seasons of The Bob Newhart Show.  Please know that we are working on releasing them by early in the 4th Quarter this year.  There should be a pre-order button going up on Amazon within a month or so.

So if they stay true to their word, Seasons 5 and 6 finally are coming out!!!!

I watched the Mary Tyler Moore Show so I could watch Bob. Mary Tyler Moore was like the opening act for the main attraction. Come on Fox, your conservative. So was Bob. Bob Newhart has an enormous fan base. He still performs and his concerts are packed and going for astronomical prices. It would not be in Fox's best interest to stop at only Four seasons.

Taxi, Bob Newhart show, Bernie Mac Show, Jeffersons and on and on.

I don't like owning 75 percent of a whole series , I want all the seasons or I won't bother buying any season sets anymore since I have been let down too many times now and I don't think anyone appreciates buying each season as they come out and then the company stops releasing the final 2 or 3 season.

As I said, I have been letdown too many times now and used to by every season as they came out but now will probably wait till all the seasons come out before buying any.

The studios have also been skimping on the sets more and more with less and less quality packaging. mork and mindy, happy days,wkrp, laverne and shirley- the 1st season sets of all htese shows were great tand then the made the packaging cheaper and starteed cuttting music and clips.

I am very disapointed with the studios as of late, they can redeem themselves but they have made me angry many times now and it will take alot to re-earn my support.

A Sept. 30, 2011 update to my original post below:
Unfortunately, just got some bad news on the release of Seasons 5 and 6 of The Bob Newhart Show, folks.
I checked in with the 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment exec who's been the point person on this, and I was told that the releases are on hold because of the dreaded musical clearance issues, and that a holiday rollout won't happen.
 The shred of good news is that I asked point-blank if that meant the releases were off, and the exec said right now it's a ""delay"" and that they are ""working on other solutions.""
I said I'd check back in a few months, but that I knew a lot of people were not going to be pleased, and that if we don't end up getting the final two seasons after strong indications that we would, people would be even more unhappy.
So I guess we just have to wait and see, hoping for the best, and if the process does come to a halt decide what we want to do then.
Hope some of you will be with me if we need to mobilize!

Hey fellow Bob Newhart Show fans.
I've been on a crusade recently to get Seasons 5 and 6 released, contacting various bigwigs at 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, and I just received this email:

3302536,5,B0011UKORC,"I am not particularly fond of the way these DVD's were put together being that they are two sided and its a pain to flip them after you have loaded one side and find out the show you wanted to watch is on the other side. Then you have to wait another minutes for it to load. However I would pay the price to get season 5 and 6 myself because the show is hilarious and one of my all time favorites. I think these shows are even better than the shows at the Inn.

I have pre-ordered seasons 5 and 6 but it is taking a lousy year so far and no release. What kind of crap is this! Every other show that goes on pre-order is out within a month or so, not a stinking year. I can get all 6 seasons from another site for $75 complete and uncut so I don't know why I'm sticking around for Amazon to release 5 and 6 for over $25 a season.

3302537,4,B0011UKORC,"I own well over 100 tv shows on dved box sets and I have decided to wait in the future to buy any season of a dvd series since I always buy every season as it comes out and am disapointed when Fox or any other company stops releases seasons with only 1, 2 or 3 to go.

Taxi, Bob Newhart show, Bernie Mac Show, Jeffersons and on and on.

I don't like owning 75 percent of a whole series , I want all the seasons or I won't bother buying any season sets anymore since I have been let down too many times now and I don't think anyone appreciates buying each season as they come out and then the company stops releasing the final 2 or 3 season.

As I said, I have been letdown too many times now and used to by every season as they came out but now will probably wait till all the seasons come out before buying any.

The studios have also been skimping on the sets more and more with less and less quality packaging. mork and mindy, happy days,wkrp, laverne and shirley- the 1st season sets of all htese shows were great tand then the made the packaging cheaper and starteed cuttting music and clips.

I am very disapointed with the studios as of late, they can redeem themselves but they have made me angry many times now and it will take alot to re-earn my support.

Also, when I see some of the absolute trash that gets released, in some cases right after it has been aired on TV, it just riles me that a show like this can't be completed. Even if you don't want to put much effort into extras, cover art, etc., at least you could put out basic discs. Luckily, I had videotaped all 142 episodes of the series over the years it has been in reruns, but it's just not the same quality and continuity.
