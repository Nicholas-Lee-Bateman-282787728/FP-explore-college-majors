4370629,5,B004FOPFFC,"Great watching this, or any series, without commercials.  The type of show that can be viewed multiple times - learning something new each time",1310601600,9,143,4.958333333333333
4370630,5,B004FOPFFC,La serie Universo History es espectacular. Lo nico que en formato blu ray no venga con subttulos en espaol (una lastima).,1308355200,15,121,4.809523809523809
4370631,3,B004FOPFFC,"This is for the DVD version only. I don't know if the Blue-ray is the same way.

I don't like giving this 3 stars. I really like the content, but the problem is the presentation. It's letterboxed 4:3. That means, if you're watching it on a 16:9 TV, the picture is tiny, it fills the center of the screen and it's surrounded by black bars. Fortunately I have the ability to zoom in 130% and that makes it ""normal"" size. It's too bad that, today, shows about swamp people are treated like the gold standard while shows like this are given no care at all. I've included and example of what letterboxed 4:3 looks like. It is NOT a screen shot from this show.",1498608000,8,654,4.274193548387097

4370645,4,B004FOPFFC,"Great series for those who are interested in astronomy and the universe but aren't experts or don't want to delve into advanced math, etc.  The later seasons aren't as good and are more about sensationalist stuff (which is unfortunately the trend in documentary TV series in recent years), but this Mega Collection only includes the first 5 which are mostly quite good.  Between this and ""Through the Wormhole"" you'll have a very nice overview of the universe, physics, and the nature of reality as we understand it today.",1469145600,,522,4.920454545454546

4370648,2,B004FOPFFC,"Pros: It's cheap for the run time. Provides great $/hour entertainment.
Cons: It's lacking some of the flavor of other documentaries on this subject. Half of the time, it's the narrator repeating what he just said 10 minutes ago.

If the original cosmos by Sagan ever becomes available, pick that up instead of this.
As is, you might be better off watching crash course astronomy for a more substantive, if less pretty, informative video series on astronomy/cosmology.",1468022400,,468,5.077922077922078

4370651,5,B004FOPFFC,"I love this set!  This is the most amazing videos on space next to How the Universe Works.  I would recommend this for every home with children in it or with an adult that loves all things space.  At 46 years of age, I still watch this set over and over.

I also like how they incorporate various scientists and astronomers as well.  While watching the series, you get familiar with: where these folks work, what they do, and how excited they are about their jobs.  It is great for kids who can watch these and see various jobs they can have if they wish to work in the space industry.  PLUS, you will find they will stop and watch other scientific shows that contain those same scientists/astronomers, shows that I find are always learning oriented.

You cannot go wrong with this set.  It doesn't contain Season 6, so be sure to purchase that as well.",1463788800,2,853,4.416666666666667

4370658,1,B004FOPFFC,When the DVD set arrived the case was broken so all of the DVDs were loose in the case. It is always in negative format when you play any of the discs so you have to stretch it out and then I find out some of the DVDs will not read at all. I will never order any type of DVD from Amazon again. This is not the first time something like this has happened but when I spend a good amount of money on something and it is as bad as this was I want to warn people not to do the same.,1455321600,3,477,3.5961538461538463

4370663,5,B004FOPFFC,"This is certainly one of the greatest series of its kind. It's up there with Carl Sagan's Cosmos and Through the Wormhole narrated by Morgan Freeman. If you want to learn about space-time-gravity-etc, then this is it. The latest theories as developed by scientists who had to earn their degrees. It's further enhanced by spectacular videos of the cosmos. If you want to watch Star Wars Action, and learn very little, then buy the new Cosmos with Neal Tyson. Neal should get a job on the family's chicken farm. If he knows anything about space and science, he's keeping it a secret. It is a farce to copy the series name from someone like Carl Sagan.

1. I AM  a believer in Jesus  Christ. ""Nothing that  was made was NOT made by Him""
2. The things of God are  "" foolishness to them that believe not""
3. I remember this series. I though the graphics were excellent. They did not clarify well enough that most informative  is THEORY. (A theory is a nice idea ganged up on by a brutal bunch of facts)",1443657600,,366,4.084507042253521

One problem: after buying in late December I finally got to disc 19 around February 19th and the disc will not play on Apple machines or windows machines. The disc goes in and stops dead as a matter of fact the whole machine stops. A message comes on the screen says that the machine does not recognize the disc format. Also you can not eject the disc until you turn off the machine, reboot and the disc symbol appears on the screen and you can eject it by clicking on the image.
Does anyone have a suggestion  what is wrong?? I am thinking that somehow the disc is formatted for a non #1 region.
Amazon have any suggestions to fix this???",1424822400,,695,4.346153846153846

4370724,5,B004FOPFFC,"Along with Through the Wormhole and Cosmos this series gave me a taste of what I didn't know and had no idea existed in the Universe I inhabit. It blows apart many things I was taught in school, such as all matter is made up of atoms that are made up of protons, electrons and neutrons. Now I find out that not even a small portion of the universe fits this definition. In fact the majority of the ""stuff"" in the universe exists to us only by how it affects the ""stuff"" we can detect. Dark matter, until just recently detected by CERN, was one of these. It is far greater in quantity than the matter I was taught made up the universe and now we find that dark energy, only known because it is pushing the galaxies to expand rather than as we were taught, contract, makes up the majority of our Universe and we don't have a clue what it is. This was just from one part of one disc in this incredible set. I am still watching it every night and I am every night being blown away by what exists in this Universe in which I dwell. For anyone that wishes to know what the cutting edge of science knows about what has evolved since the Big Bang this series in required viewing.",1401926400,10,1171,4.1629955947136565

4370727,1,B004FOPFFC,"My wife and I bought this DVD with high hopes.  We wanted it for our own enjoyment and to help educate our 4 kids.  However, we were sorely disappointed!  We threw it in the trash.  What a complete waste of $75!

We expected the DVD to contain mostly scientifically proved facts, but most of it was mere theory & speculation.  Even worse, many of the theories were presented as facts.  And yet worse still, they clearly had an extremely biased world view position which lead them to state certain things which are mere theories at best.

If you break competing world views on the universe down into 2 oversimplified basic categories, you'd have ""atheistic evolution"" & ""intelligent design.""  I would expect any fair, scientific, unbiased, presentation of the universe to state mostly proven facts, and then to present both world views as possibilities for the mysterious and the unknown.  These DVDs, however, are completely atheistic!  They don't even submit to the remote possibility that there could be a Creator (intelligent designer).  Any notion of a Creator is left completely out of the discussion, but the big bang THEORY is mentioned again and again and again...

It really destroys the beauty of science.  It turns the universe into a meaningless and lifeless result of random chemical processes.

I wouldn't expect them to fully present a Biblical view of creation, but a fair treatment of the subject deserves to at least hold open the possibility of a Creator, even if its left unsaid who that Creator might be.

I would not recommend these DVDs to anyone.  They are worthless.  Their emphasis on their extremely biased theories and speculations makes these DVDs completely untrustworthy.  My wife and I caught them in bold faced lies, stating falsehoods as facts.  Which lead us to wonder, ""If there is no clear distinction between theory and fact, can we trust anything they say?""  Our answer, ""No!""

Save your money.  Find a better DVD set on the universe.  We are still looking for a good one.",1397692800,18,2011,4.881656804733728

4370744,5,B004FOPFFC,"This is a very enjoyable series to watch.  The breadth of topics covered in this review are really quite extensive.  Everything from black holes, manned space travel, time travel, nebulae, pulsars, quasars...even sex in space...are all covered here.  Some of the professionals that speak regularly on the show are excellent.  Alex Fillipenko, Clifford Johnson, Amy Mainzer, and many others bring a great air of credibility to the series.  They all explain very complex subjects in a down to earth, non-technical way that virtually anyone can understand.

All that said, there are some drawbacks.  A lot of the graphics that are used in the show get to be very repetitive.  There's one specific graphic of bacteria dividing that is used dozens of times to represent the formation of life.  A bit more variation in the usage of graphics would have been nice.  Another issue is that some of the topics start to repeat themselves when we get into the later series.  Many of the topics in later seasons are essentially a rehash of an earlier episode, placed into a slightly different context.

The complaints are far outweighed by the praise though.  This is a great series, and I would recommend it to anyone that has a fascination with the universe.",1369267200,6,1246,4.904306220095694

The facts, details, visual effects, expert insight and overall quality of every episode in the series makes it one of my favorites. The episodes go very in depth on one subject at a time (for instance, there is a separate episode for the sun, Earth, Mars, Saturn, asteroids, the life and death of stars, etc) and so you are given a vivid and very detailed description and analysis of the subject matter complete with expert opinions and analysis from several prominent astronomers, astrophysicists, etc. I learned more from watching one episode of this show than I have from reading entire textbooks on some of these subjects. And the 45 minute time-frame ensures that you learn all of the relevant information without it becoming a bore. I would definitely recommend this series to anyone who has any interest (even if it's just a passing interest) in space and the cosmos.

The constant bombardment of cheap, cheesy and utterly unnecessary action music, has me begging for the episode to end, sooner rather than later. How about making a show that enables you to sit back, relax and actually allow you to process the information that you are presented with. Another problem is that, although there is much info in the series, very little time is spent unraveling each topic in logical steps. Instead it zooms back and forth at light speed, surely triggering epileptic events by the numbers. The editing truly is of the worst kind imaginable, and will not allow your eyes a moments rest. I am very interested in shows about the cosmos, but this series is garbage. I can't imagine what would possess you into buying this blu ray, and then actually watching the whole thing.

4370760,4,B004FOPFFC,"I thought the first season was phenomenal and would recommend buying this full set, especially if you get a good deal. But it does go downill a bit after the first season. Some themes get repetitive and it gets progressively more ridiculous in its conjecture, assumptions and doomsday scenarios. Certain episodes like ones on alien life forms purely assume with no more authority than the guys working in the creature shop at ILM what alien life forms might look like. And entire episodes are given to things like ""Sex in Space"" that really don't warrant 45 minutes of coverage.

4370773,3,B004FOPFFC,"The Universe ""Complete"" series, and I quote complete since there is at least one more season after this box set, is a pretty good overall series.  However, the series quickly becomes very repetitive.  The first season is what you'd expect.  It mostly deals with Earth's solar system.  One thing I immediately noticed, however, is that many of the interviews and much of the footage is identical to what is used in the first season of ""How the Universe Works.""  Now, ""The Universe"" season 1 came out long before How the Universe Works, so I cannot knock it for that, but this leads me to wonder how much of the footage has been regurgitated from elsewhere.

I pretty much break the entire series down into two types of episodes.  ""Factual"" and theoretical.  Factual episodes are episodes such as the ones involving the inner planets.  They are easily observable, we have a good idea how they work (though not perfect, hence why ""factual"" was in quotes), so we can consider episodes about them to be fact based.  Other episodes, such as colonizing Mars, fall into the theoretical category.  I tend to find the theoretical episodes to be more interesting and a little less repetitive than the factual episodes.  Nevertheless, you will quickly find that after the first season, the same footage is used over and over again.  How many times will we need to see that poor T-Rex blasted by a meteor's shockwave?

Another thing you will also realize is that the show quickly runs out of new ideas.  As soon as I saw ""Sex in Space"" as an episode title in Season 3, I instantly knew the writers had run out of ideas.  Sure the idea of sex in space is interesting, but not 45 minutes worth interesting.  It would have made a good five to 10 minute side piece of another episode.

I've had this series for months now and have only watched through the first three and a half seasons.  It simply got too boring too fast.  I would give the first two seasons five stars, but overall, I give this series three stars.  Repetition is great for those who catch only a single episode since it fills in some of the necessary components, but there is simply way too much repetition when watching every single episode in order.",1353110400,12,2203,4.597435897435897

4370778,5,B004FOPFFC,"""We are just lucky to live in a time when the stars are shining, so we can discern the observable universe and learn a great deal about it"".  I'm paraphrasing Alexi Filippenko, my favorite scientist in the show.  I wish I had a teacher like him during my school days.  I'd say every kid must watch this show and learn Astrophysics when they're very young.  I'd have loved to learn Newton's / Kepler's laws in school had they been explained the way they were in this show!  If every kid all over the world were given an opportunity to see this show, I am guessing the world would be a better place.  Forget your quarrels, petty differences, polluting ways!

This show invigorates and motivates you to keep learning. I didn't know water was so rare (liquids in general) in the universe. To think we have a great pacific garbage patch here in a blatant disregard and disrespect for our environment is just plain callous and blind!

Any way:

1. Great graphics
2. Articulate scientists explaining science in laymen's term.  Also, give you adequate jargon for you to Google.
3. Learn a great deal.  Hard to say this to TV shows in general these days.

I was able to see some reuse of graphics & interviews to emphasis overlapping subjects.  Guess I was able to do that only since I watched the show like a madman on Netflix under a month.  (Yes, I have to work for a living ;))",1337299200,12,1372,4.457831325301205

The universe - and however many of them there are - is/are breathtaking in every possible way. Learning about space and seeing the BEAUTIFUL photos, the fantastic graphics, the way everything is explained - the scientists who explain things - the narration. I can't say enough.

4370781,1,B004FOPFFC,"The entire series is produced with background music that keeps one constantly on edge.  Never one moment of peace to reflect on and enjoy the emormous volume of data and information embedded in each episode.  No doubt this could be a great set, but it is produced for an audience that does not mind being dragged along as if it were a never ending sensationalist adventure.  Filled with animation that is reproduced over and over, many scenes are monotonous rehashes of previously introduced material.  In addition, the series is interspersed with breaks for advertising or station breaks or whatever occurs in the TV land.  These breaks simply truncate the immediate scene and then without skipping a beat, picks up with a retake of much of the information already delivered as if your brain were suddenly switched off and you have forgotten what occurred moments before.  It is too bad that this set is produced in such a way.  As a family, we were looking forward to the production. But because of the high pressure delivery complete with the shortfalls mentioned plus other very annoying features found in sensationalist news broadcasting so common these days, the set will be discarded and we will look for something created more in the style of what David Attenborough has been able to achieve in so many delightful, informative and extremely well produced videos.",1333584000,121,1370,4.956331877729258

4370785,1,B004FOPFFC,"No, I'm not suggesting that this Universe series is an action thriller like Bourne.  I'm referring to the equally vomiting editing and camera works on both.  I and my wife are interested in the Universe subject and bought the box series without too much previewing.  Fatal mistake.  We struggled to get through the first episode because each scene got edited every second or so, and the camera was often moving during each scene.  We hoped that the producers/directors would learn from this and do better on the second episode, but no.  We randomly checked some later episodes, same thing.  After watching a total of about 60 minutes of the whole series, I had to dump it into the second hand market.

Maybe the History Channel people thought that by doing this ""fast"" editing and moving camera, they would make the program more pacy, thus reducing people's perception of ""History"" being dull.  Maybe many people can take these fast editing and camera works, but I'd bet there are also many people who can't.  For the producers/directors, is it so difficult to produce something that everybody can, at least, sit through?",1330560000,69,1121,4.883597883597884
4370786,3,B004FOPFFC,"I am not going to do a involved review as others have done this very well.
The series is very slick and polished with a good amount of information for Astronomy buffs.
The only flaw with this series and to me it is a big one.
They have edited some of the episodes for people with very high Attention Deficit issues.
The episode about worm holes to me was unwatchable because they are constantly throwing multiple scenes per second.
Constant scene changes......to the point it plays tricks on your eyesight.
It is hard to concentrate on the information content because of the repeated back and forth scene changes.
I am hoping the whole series is not edited like this.....if it is I will sell this set.
As it is too irritating to watch.
I haven't noticed anyone else mentioning this IMHO flaw, but to me the way a production is edited can make or break a program.
The producers were trying to get too slick, and apparently decided if they didn't change scenes multiple times per second the viewers eyes would glaze over from boredom.
Great service from Amazon, with Amazon being the premier store to buy dvd's.",1330214400,71,1109,4.606060606060606
4370787,5,B004FOPFFC,"I bought this as an anniversary present for my husband, and so far we are really enjoying them.  We've only watched a few hours (we're still on the first disk), so I will try to update this if I have any additional comments, particularly negative.

As I said, we're really enjoying it so far.  They are interesting and engaging, and very informative to someone with only a basic knowledge of astronomy and astrophysics etc.  I am sure to someone already very well versed in this area it might be boring or repetitive, but it was just what we were looking for.  I have also found it to have just the right mix of commentary and re-enactments etc to be very enjoyable.  The images are pretty good as well.  So far I have also found the variety of topics covered to hold my attention very well.  All in all we are extremely happy with this series; I am looking forward to watching the rest of it!",1328054400,14,893,4.36969696969697

4370789,5,B004FOPFFC,"Is a very very well made Tv serie, perfect to watch it during the weekend with the entire family or alone if you prefer....
In Blu ray you really enjoy the quality picture, sound (not 5.1)...etc, make me ask, What next of Blu ray!?....
These set really feed your brain!!..

but...
I wrote but...just because As non US person, I am in the compromise to talk about this topic....
The set is obviously not made to be comercialize out of USA, or Non American people since they use miles, fahrenheit..etc..and some times is dificult to build in your mind the distance in KM or the temperature in Celsius if you are not use to US scales. This maybe also could be solve with  subtitle, but is not, even it doesnt come with no other than english subtitles..
Thank you ""History"" to put on the  market so good quality material...understand me, that I must mention this aspect and is just a constructive criticism,  maybe next time you will think more globally...

This is not a reason to put a bad star qualification, is why I choose 5 stars and I would recommend this product.

Was incredibly lucky and got this whole box set for only 47 USD and only a few hours later it went up to 149 USD! If you want to know everything about the universe and have a great time at the same time, this is the set to get.

4370794,2,B004FOPFFC,"I had a quesy feeling about this series when I read the description on the back of the box which stated to effect that black holes basically gobble up everything in the universe and white holes create things. Well, my intuition was well founded; with regards to black holes, they are: ""...unable to support itself...trouble makers...able to take up residence and start running the show...big, lumbaring things that lumbar around and cannot be stopped...cosmic cannibals...roach motels...and if one black hole isn't violent enough, try TWO black holes, duelling for dominance...[binary] black holes may appear to be engaging in some sort of cosmic courtship, but these unions are anything but harmonious... [wave detectors] hopefully catch black holes collisions in the act...[worm holes, white holes, black holes] none of these are places you want to take a vacation near...""
In contrast, galaxies, which are portrayed lit up in white, ""...come together...are absorbed...merge...integrate...and collide...""  Oddly, they are engaging in EXACTLY the same kind of behavior black holes engage in because galaxies are anchored together by super massive black holes that reside at their centers! Now, lets take a look at a book on propaganda by Jules Ellul: ""This need of a certain cultural level to make people susceptible to progaganda is better understood if one looks at one of propaganda's most important devices, the manipulation of symbols. The more an individual participates in the society in which he lives, the more he will cling to sterotyped symbols expressing collective notions about the past and the future of his group. The more stereotypes in a culture, the easier it is to form public opinion, and the more an individual participates in that culture, the more susceptible he becomes to the manipulation of these symbols. The number of propaganda campaigns in the West which have first taken hold in cultured settings is remarkable.""",1325548800,6,1945,5.314935064935065
