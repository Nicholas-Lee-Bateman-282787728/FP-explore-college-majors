8052489,3,B0007VY580,"Okay so I'm a disaster flick fan and this one almost qualifies; so I'll give it three stars because I was actually able to watch it all the way through. It is predictable to a point although the title is misleading but I'll not spoil the ending of the movie for you. It has all the usual characters including the beautiful, brilliant, blond scientist, her young son and her persistent ex; the evil corporate villain with his evil henchmen and a couple of almost hero's to fill out the cast.

It also has those strange moments when in the middle of an action sequence the characters stop to talk about feelings and such as well as those strange moments where the evil villain is knocked down so the good guys run away leaving the weapons behind with the villain, (go figure - and for the record, the evil villain gets up, grabs the weapon and starts after them again).

If you are a devoted disaster flick fan you may want to see this one once just to say you did; I suspect once will be enough so you may want to rent instead of buy.",1415318400,,1033,4.292307692307692
8052490,1,B0007VY580,"Another rotational filler for the SciFi Weekend a.k.a. The Home Of The B-Movie.

And like most, a poor quality cheapie with an absolutely worthless lead actor stumbling through a moronic plot. In this case that would be filled by hackneyed and completely forgettable Janet Gunn. If overacting and astoundingly lousy thespian skills have value - then this is a million dollar performance.

Opens with a seismologist who may be on the verge of a breakthrough. She's sent packing to the very focal point of her research in the hopes a more direct study can validate her research. Has she solved one of science's greatest modern mysteries: When The Big One will strike California?

However, if you're expecting to see a disaster flick, there's only the screenplay for your viewing pleasure.

Mixed into this preposterous tale: Plane crash survivor Jack Scalia, whose mysterious character, no surprise, is more than the art curator he claims as his profession. And what does stolen nuclear material and a nefarious global corporation have to do with the temblors?

A small representative sampling of some sincerely atrocious screenwriting and ham-fisted direction for this flick:

- Over several consecutive days a temblor hits at the exact same chime of the clock - and only one scientist in the entire state notices something strange. Really?

- Ya gotta love the motorcycle ""chase"" - all 10 MPH's worth. A laughable stunt apparently set up by The Golden Girls. Interesting for all the wrong reasons.

- Singing the ""Bottles Of Beer On The Wall"" song. What kind of half-assed marginal operator would alert their presence in the field by croaking out a tune? I'd insert a politically incorrect term here, but I'm afraid that it would insult those in that category.

- What the bleep was the deal with the urban camo? Did no one notice the lack of a cityscape? Not a chunk of concrete in sight, but lots and lots of mountain. If I were one of the nogoodniks at the secret base, I'd ask my boss why we're inappropriately attired in highly visible field gear but, you know, not camouflaged. One wonders what the corporation issues in arctic conditions - forest green BDUs?

Utterly underwhelming in every respect. Your typical made-for-tv schlock would actually be an improvement. Pure unfiltered poop and a massive waste of time.",1362873600,,2323,4.948586118251928
8052491,5,B0007VY580,Not a bad flick.  Janet Gunn fans will enjoy it.  rather enjoyable for a low budget flick.  Worth a few bucks to watch.,1353369600,,119,4.086956521739131
8052492,1,B0007VY580,"California Quake: 2/10: What is great about California Quake? Well the helicopter has a cool Planet of the Apes net and Janet Gunn does look awfully nice in a wet T-shirt. Unfortunately that's it.

But surely even the worst earthquake footage of crumbling buildings is fun to watch? This is true alas there are no crumbling buildings in California Quake. Actually there are virtually no buildings at all. You see the title is a bit of a bait and switch job (even the original title Ground Zero was a bit misleading). This is not a disaster movie. This is Die Hard in the woods.

Janet Gunn and her son are in the Los Angeles forest investigating a series of mysterious quakes. (She separated from her husband due to a rather badly handled drunk driving subplot) Jack Scalia parachutes in and informs them an Evil Corporation is testing nuclear weapons underground. Two is added to two and Janet and Jack realize that the nukes are causing the earthquakes. ""Are you saying the ground shakes because of the (nuclear) explosions?"" Jack Scalia's character incredulously asks.

The Evil Corporation hires some very misplaced stock actors to silence Jack, Janet and Janet's son. The main bad guy is a third rate Larry Drake. (Drake was mentally challenged Benny from LA Law and was the villain in Darkman. Apparently he was too busy filming the TV movie Runaway Virus so they had to hire a double.)

Now I've seen actors copy De Niro or Pacino or Nicholson but Drake? His henchmen include the cold businesswoman, a Klaus Kinski imitator, and some people apparently randomly chosen from a bar. The extra henchmen don't even look right (Urban Camouflage? In the woods? In 1999?)

Are they as unconvincing as the bicycle hat wearing SEALs of Chupacabra Terror? Well no. But awfully close. Certainly they are as incompetent.

For example there is one building in the woods and after being chased by bad guys for a day or so Janet and Jack go back to the cabin to talk about feelings and grab a shower it never occurred to the bad guys to, oh I don't know, leave someone there.

So no earthquakes bad villains and a Janet Gunn wet t-shirt contest. Needless to say skip this one (As if starring Jack Scalia isn't enough of a clue.)",1268697600,,2219,4.674358974358975
