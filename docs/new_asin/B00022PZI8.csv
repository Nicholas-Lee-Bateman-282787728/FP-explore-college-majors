There is something about the guy with a girlfriend falls for someone else and gets stuck in the middle plot that really nags at me. It's a dick move on the guy's part, needless to say, and for a writer (in this case The Great Magician's Ho Leung Lau) to use it as comedy fodder always strikes me not only as lazy, but as a way to set yourself up with a very unlikable hero and two leading ladies who have the capacity to devolve quickly into jealous, nagging shrews. So as soon as Ken (Vampire Effect's Ekin Cheng) gets back from Japan, where he's just recruited Anna (Three...Extremes' Miriam Yeung Chin Wah) for a martial arts tournament he's setting up in part by offering her up one of the hottest screen kisses in recent memory and we find he's got a girlfriend... ugh. And yet somehow, and despite the fact that I went into this with pretty low expectations given both its place in my sorted Netflix queue (in the bottom 20%) and its rating on IMDB as I write this (4.5), I ended up... not hating it. It's certainly not the best piece of moviemaking I've seen this month, but it was relatively charming, high up in the eye candy department, and has good enough comic timing to keep me chuckling throughout.

I've already given you the first half of the plot above: Ken heads off to recruit Anna, the daughter of the last guy to win a major martial arts tournament that fell into obscurity, so she can compete in a newly-revamped version of it backed by an energy-drink billionaire. Then we get home and find out he's got a girlfriend. So he tries to pass each girl off as his best friend's girlfriend to the other, leading to some odd, awkward scenes that still manage to be amusing. Then comes the tournament, with a subplot about an American producer who's looking for someone to star in a martial arts movie, but the second half of the movie is all about the tournament. If you've read YuYu Hakusho, you know pretty much everything you need to about the tournament, from the crazy competitors to the ridiculous finishing moves.

Given the movie's structure (manufactured drama followed by big-ass tournament), it sort of begs comparison to Warrior, released a decade later and played seriously where this one goes for laughs. While empirically there is no doubt in my mind that Warrior is a better movie by any metric you can measure, the two movies exist to satisfy two separate audiences. Warrior is a drama that also happens to be a sports movie, while Anna in Kung Fu Land is a sports movie that also happens to be a comedy. It's a subtle distinction at times, but it's important in how you approach the movie and whether you're willing to buy Anna's compete dispensing with reality by halfway through the movie. Since I already had a frame of referenceYuYu Hakusho was one of the first series manga I glommed onto when I started getting back into comics a decade agoI saw exactly where this was coming from and was more than happy to go along for the ride. Your mileage may vary (but then again, that just means you should probably go read YuYu Hakusho). ***",1397520000,,3132,4.491228070175438
8020910,4,B00022PZI8,"Miriam is a joy to watch, but the elemination contest segment was a little not there. Why did they have an American in the matches is strange to me. She was great interrupting the bout to get the man to shut up.  All in all I will buy this one for sure.",1358985600,,253,3.8653846153846154
8020911,3,B00022PZI8,"The movie starts with a good premise: Elkin Cheng works for an ad agency and organizes a Kung-Fu tournament to promote a health drink.  In the process, he needs to recruit Miriam Yeung, the daughter of a Kung-Fu master, to enter the contest.  However, the movie then turns into a trite plot of Elkin Cheng having two girl friends (his boss' daughter and Miriam) and trying to hide one from the other.  The movie missed the opportunity to develop interesting, fun characters for the tournament's various Kung-Fu specialists. Instead, we get dumb characters who are only mildly amusing.  SPOILER: Miriam finds out that Elkin is a two-timer, and channels her anger to win the tournament by imagining Elkin's face on her opponent.  The DVD has Mandarin and Cantonese audio tracks, with Chinese and very poorly translated English subtitles.",1137369600,,835,5.021739130434782
8020912,2,B00022PZI8,"Okay, I'm a big fan of Ekin Cheng's. I own numerous DVD's and audio CD's (he is a singer as well as a movie star), but I though Anna in Kung Fu land was low budget and quite frankly, the worst Cheng movie I've seen to date. Cheng stars as an advertising executive whose company hosts a martial arts competition in order to advertise its health drink. Cheng travels to Tokyo to recruit a famous martial artist. Instead he recruits his daughter, Anna.
Cheng, who already has a girlfriend, hits on Anna which convinces her to come to China to compete. Thus begins a round of 'romantic comedy' silliness which seemed flat and stale.
Cheng usually doesn't play annoying characters, but I felt he was a bit of a cad in this one. Why would he want Anna, when he already has a beautiful girlfriend back in China? His reasons and motivations were quite silly. The other marital artist characters were just silly stereotypes and the ending made no sense whatsoever.
The subtitles were atrocious and filled with misspellings and bad translations. For instance, there is a scene where an American actor says:  ""Wait,  what are you doing?"" and the English subtitle translates this: ""Okay, go ahead.""  Say what? Really, really bad.
If you MUST see this, be prepared for some nice eye candy, but bad acting and a super silly disappointing plot.",1088640000,,1329,4.695278969957082
