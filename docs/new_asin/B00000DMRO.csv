7905971,5,B00000DMRO,"I love Tamagotchi, and I saw this tape and got it out.  It's funny for Tamagotchi and non-collectors, and has a music video and an art lesson at the end.  Tamagotchi have to go to Earth to complete the museum before the  Great Gotchi sees that the museum's deprived of the display from our world.  Tamagotchi (14 I think) find our appliances intruiging and good  representatives of Earth.  I get it from the library every time I can find  it, and I would recommend it to the fullest amount.",957830400,11,490,4.438202247191011
