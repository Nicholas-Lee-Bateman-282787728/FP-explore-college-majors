1244197,5,B00001IVFD,"when i first watched this DVD i was so amazed it made me cry. I'm a home health aide and took care of two gentlemen
that has Autism and both none verbal and when days were a little trying all i would have to do is pop Raffi and then it was all smiles and some screaming but that's because they were happy and we'd watch Raffi the rest of our day inbetween what the parent's was us to do.. So grab the popcorn and bring some family over and i promise no one will leave without a tissue. and make sure when you go home go to Amazon

1244200,5,B00001IVFD,"I am really surprised by the crummy reviews this video has received.  Especially when people are comparing this video to the one with his ""Rise and Shine Band"".
Granted, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but when I first saw this video, I was genuinely surprised by how fun it was to watch with my son.  So, since this video has the worst rating of his other videos, I went ahead and rented the one with his ""Rise and Shine Band"".  Well, I can tell you this much: if you like Lawrence Welk, you will like the Rise and Shine video.  If you like something that is more modern and less dated, than watch this one instead.
A lot of the songs are the same, but there are some wonderful new additions.  People seem to complain about Raffi's message of recycling and clean air.  What is the problem with that?  I certainly did not feel that it was pushed down my throat.  I'm guessing that the people who complain about this have no clue about what kind of gift this singer is to our son's and daugher's, and how you can never learn too early how important it is to help save the earth (ok, so I'm NOT a right-wing conservative).
The two songs at the end (after the credits) are really wonderful tunes.  They have a melody that just sticks with you (in a good way).
Don't give up on this by listening to all the bad reviews.  Just watch it, and then decide for yourself.",1063929600,14,1372,4.282945736434108
1244201,5,B00001IVFD,"We bought our first Raffi video (In concert with the rise and shine band) on a whim, and my 2 yr old sons were hooked. After listening to it at least twice a day for weeks, we checked out his other two videos at the library. I let the boys pick which one they want to watch, and it is evenly split between our two ""new"" ones.
While this video is more subdued and offers a message that is not found with the others, that's what makes it perfect for quiet time. I usually encourage this one after their nap while I'm getting dinner ready. The boys love it when the other children come out to sing. And they love the planets in the background. I think their favorite part is the ""rap"" song (and the sunglasses involved) that Raffi does. He also offers lots of old favorites like Baby Beluga, Day-O, and Down By the Bay.
Personally, I find this one a little more interesting because of the message, the ""timeliness"" of it, and the sense of humor with the band members. The only part that is annoying is the long encore after the credits. Ordinarily, I would start rewinding at the credits, but my husband told me about the music afterwards. I'm sure many people miss out on the extra songs until they just happen to let the video go to the end.",1015545600,18,1240,4.280851063829787
1244202,5,B00001IVFD,"My husband and I thought this was Raffi's BEST video! Not to mention how our 8 month-old daughter is still mezmerized by his music and his spoken  word. (He's the only musician she would listen to and watch starting at 2  months!)
We appreciated the important messages Raffi includes about peace  and the environment. And how he invites and empowers already active  children to be a part of his show. We hope our daughter continues to enjoy  watching as she grows so the messages he shares in this video can really  take hold.
Our daughter led us to Raffi and we are so glad she did! She  (and we) also very much enjoy his other two videos.",963619200,14,640,4.418803418803419
1244203,2,B00001IVFD,"Our family loves Raffi, and we want to share him with you - just not this video. It's his only real disappointment. Try one of his other great classics instead.
His band here has no drummer - a cheesy synthesizer  carries the beat. They sound bad. He uses a second rate choir from a  children for the environment group. The whole concert lacks the magic of  his other CD's and videos.
Instead, try the outstanding video,  ""Young Children's Concert with Raffi,"" which captures Raffi at  his best with children. Or try one of his many wonderful CD's, like  ""Singable Songs for the Very Young; Great with a Peanut Butter  Sandwich"" and ""Raffi in Concert with the Rise and Shine  Band.""
Our family loves Raffi, and so will you. His music is silly,  fun to sing along with, and just right for little people. You'll enjoy any  of his other CD's or videos, with a peanut butter sandwich.",951868800,12,880,4.547770700636943
1244243,3,B00001IVFD,"My son absolutely loves Raffi's other concerts, I cannot even count how many times we've watched them. This was rather disappointing. Raffi is fantastic with just his guitar or with the Sunshine Band. In this show, it almost seems like they tried too hard...the show is much more enjoyable when he keeps it simple. My son completely stopped watching after a few minutes, which is surprising when Raffi is involved. And while I'm not against conservation, the message was a little heavy-handed.",1420329600,,493,5.024390243902439
1244244,5,B00001IVFD,I remember listening to this guy in grade school in the 1980's. It brought back so many great memories of being a kid! I still remembered a lot of the lyrics (shocked myself to be singing along)!He is just magic for kids. My niece is now falling in love with the catchy tunes!,1418169600,,276,4.226415094339623

1244250,5,B00001IVFD,"All day long, my one year old says, ""Raffi""?  He LOVES this DVD and watches it at least once a day.  He loves the music and the lyrics are great for all ages.  I listened to Raffi as a child myself so it takes me back when we watch it together.  It's given us many wonderful memories!!!!",1364083200,,287,3.982456140350877
1244251,5,B00001IVFD,"This is just a great DVD. It is fun for my granddaughter and her friends to see a face to the songs they love so much.
Great for sleepovers and parties, too. We love Raffi on Broadway and we love Raffi!!!!!",1351641600,,206,4.048780487804878
1244252,2,B00001IVFD,"Our kids LOVED&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Raffi-A-Young-Children-s-Concert-with-Raffi/dp/B000AMJGD0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Raffi: A Young Children's Concert with Raffi</a>.  That DVD is AMAZING.  Raffi is to children's folk music was Bob Marley is to Reggae.  We bought Raffi on Broadway to prevent the onset for Raffi fatigue as our 16 month old old wants to watch Baby Beluga on the Concert For Young Children DVD not less than twice a day.  She often sings this sold to put her self to sleep.  We hoped that the Browardway DVD would be just half as good as the blue jacket DVD, Raffi a Concert for your children.  Sadly this DVD at best one tenth as good as the Concert for Young Children.  Why?  One Concert for young children its just Raffi and his instrumental guitar... on Broadway he is accompanied by a Keyboard player who is just awful.  If you mix 1 part Raffi with one part Elevator music is just ruins the whole thing.  His other accompanying artist plays an Fake Bass ( I guess its some for of Digital Bass) or Bass Synthesizer that is also pretty sad.

Raffi attempts to Rap yes rap on one song and fails miserably.  In a few songs he gets all preachy.  I support almost all of his liberal causes but, the message here is a little heavy for kids music. A few songs come across as an agnostic version of bad Christian Rock without the Jesus references.  Unless you have every other Raffi DVD, skip this one and buy all the other DVDs first.  Raffi's best work was his early work, when it was pure, joyful, warm uncontrived and unspoiled by awful accompanying musicians.",1315353600,,1639,4.909090909090909
