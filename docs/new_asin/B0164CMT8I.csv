Let's face it, no Rock voice can last 4 decades. So why try?.

Long live the late 70s/early 80s Rush sound. The magic era for sure.",1447113600,4,168,4.21875
7456391,2,B0164CMT8I,"Been a Rush fan for 30 years and I so very much want to order this, but I've been listening to Sirius XM play R40 and sadly it seems like Geddy is past his prime. It breaks my heart to say this, and I know it's totally sacriligious. The music is outstanding and totally on point, but you can barely understand Geddy on some of the songs. And it's not poor mixing - he sounds like he's singing with a rag in his mouth, and he can't hit the high notes anymore. Even the songs in a more 'normal' range like Subdivisions sound mumbled and strained.

I saw Snakes and Arrows, Vapor Trails, Test For Echo, Roll The Bones and many other Rush concerts and each time I've walked away amazed at how Geddy still had it. Until R40. It just wasn't his best performance, and I'm hearing it on the recordings.

Die-hards are going to collect this no matter what -- sick set list, incredible tour visuals, etc. -- but just be prepared that it's not the same Geddy you grew up with.",1447027200,16,965,4.239130434782608
7456392,2,B0164CMT8I,"To start, i'm a great fan of Rush and i saw almost all the shows in Montreal since 1990....Paid 25$ for the Presto concert and i've kept all my concert tickets !

Even though it's not released yet, i'm a bit afraid too about the sound quality. The last couple of shows were filmed differently from let's say Rush in Rio and Rush 30 that were not only well filmed, but sounded much better than the last ones. No PCM Stereo option for me is a BIG shame first of all cause i don't listen to great shows with a 5.1 system...

So, i hope that they have learned, listened and read the reviews from the fans and people who knows how a great Bluray should sound and deliver a great image and/or experience.

My 2 stars are for a great doubt that i have and deception since a couple of mistakes were done in the past...Vapor Trail that sounded like crap for an example and the last two Bluray that made my ears bled for a while ;)",1446940800,,921,4.134078212290503

Only a Rush hater would complain about the opportunity to capture this experience live.....true Rush fans will cherish the R40 show forever....Rush are the most professional and talented rock band I have ever seen.....they never disappoint.

7456394,5,B0164CMT8I,"To SQUONK2,
I have Clockwork Angels blue ray and think it was awesome except for the clown thing. Kinda strange but the video and audio were great. I have been a fan since the beginning and have all their music and feel able to comment on this with some expertise. What didn't you like? The crispness of Alex's guitar? The bright yet pounding sound of Geddy's bass? The explosion behind the drum kit known as Neil Peart?Maybe you need a new tv or stereo so you could enjoy the true beauty of this masterpiece. Good Day Sir!",1445558400,3,523,4.402061855670103
7456395,2,B0164CMT8I,"I saw it live where it was being filmed and there was a really tall guy in front of me.  I couldn't see anything.  I'm sure that tall guys will be in this video.  I mean I was in the sixth row so he was in the fifth row.

Then there were those annoying guys next to me that kept yelling for Tom Sawyer.  Even after they played the song, they kept yelling for Tom Sawyer.  I'm sure you'll be able to hear those guys on the DVD too.  Every time I asked them to be quiet they got louder.  One guys spilt his beer on me.

So if you want to true experience of going to a show live, have someone taller than you stand between you and the TV, get another friend to be obnoxious and spill a beer on you.

Then wait in a line for about 20 minutes before you use the bathroom during intermission and make sure the person before you goes all over your seat.",1445299200,7,846,3.8947368421052633

7456397,2,B0164CMT8I,"BUYER BEWARE! This Blu-ray was Produced and Directed by the same video guys that brought you the atrocious ""Clockwork Angels"" Blu-ray. I can't believe that Rush retained them after the litany of bad reviews given for the last one. Please read the Amazon reviews of the ""Clockwork Angels"" Blu-ray for detailed clarification.

You will find no greater Rush fan than I and I saw this truly amazing Rush 40 show in California last July. Rush was at their best, Geddy's voice was stronger than ever and the setlist was unparalleled for those of us who have been around since the early days. I was chomping at the bit to get this Blu-ray until I saw that it was Directed by Dale Heslip, who is the Director that butchered the coverage of the Clockwork Angels tour. Rush admittedly set the bar high with the superior video coverage and pristine audio in the earlier ""Rush 30"" and ""Snakes & Arrows"" Blu-rays, both directed by Pierre Lamoureux. However, the ""Clockwork Angels"" Blu-ray audio was so unlistenable and the video coverage so ameteurish that I couldn't get all the way through the first viewing. It remains in my media closet, buried with the worst of the hundreds of concert Blu-ray's/DVD's that I own.

I'll sit this one out unless I read some positive reviews after it's release.",1444953600,23,1284,4.753363228699552

7456403,5,B0164CMT8I,"This tour was expected to be the Farewell tour for one of the top rock bands.  Looking back, that seems to be what it was.  The video is fantastic, the audio is excellent and the setlist is amazing.  Nearly 3 hours of music and no real low points.  I was at this show and there wasn't any point in the show for a washroom break other than the intermission.  I don't know how three guys in their 60's have the stamina to present such an intense show.  The 2nd song into the first set was Headlong Flight.  It's such a frantic song but throw in a short rapid drum solo and I was already exhausted as a fan just 10 minutes in.  They reversed their setlist so that they began with recent songs and worked their way back in time, finishing with songs from their earliest album (and even a tease of a song they wrote before their first album that went unreleased.).  But they also devolved their onstage gear, with the road crew coming out on stage as Rush played, took down one stage setup and replaced it with a stage setup from the era of the songs they began playing at that point.  It was a very creative way to play a concert.  In set 2, they played some songs they hadn't played in a long time.  Geddy Lee's vocal range really can't hit the vocal range of such songs so they played long instrumental sections of those songs.  This allowed them to play songs they haven't played in decades and at the same time protect Geddy's aging vocal chords.  If you missed this tour, this is one concert you have to see.",1516838400,,1509,4.249122807017544

7456408,1,B0164CMT8I,I hate to write this but it's true.  I think the reason they stopped touring is because Geddy's voice just isn't what it once was.  Not his fault.  I just can't listen to it though.  Breaks my heart to hear it any other way than the studio sound that I remember.  I'm a huge fan.  Very disappointing.

7456427,5,B0164CMT8I,"I think perhaps Rush gave us the best music and lyrics, and over the longest time period, of any popular music group in history.  Most of their songs have a powerful and clear melodic ""hook,"" but beneath the surface accessibility, there is an enormous sophistication of bass lines and highly challenging and inventive time signatures and percussion (Peart is arguably the most melodic and creative force ever in rock drumming).  These surprising rhythmic qualities that are above and beyond anything else in popular music are like a well of musical inspiration that seems refreshing each time you listen to their songs. It really is a perfect crossover between standard high energy rock and high art prog rock, and in that way is akin to Duke Ellington bridging complex jazz and Big Band populist sensibilities-- and both reaching a far larger audience in that way.

Though they may well be retired from touring, the loyalty they built in over 40 years is totally incomparable to any other musical group.  I feel an emotional impact with literally dozens of Rush songs that is as strong as anything I find in music, or any other kind of appreciation of the arts, and it goes farther and deeper than the impression more complex prog rock (like say Dream Theater) can have. Even more than that, Peart's brilliant lyrics are challenging and filled with philosophical and literary allusions, and often make us confront truths about the human condition and our place in the universe.

This may be the final chapter in how sensationally they delivered all of this in their live concerts, and it's only equaled or exceeded by their previous concert videos.  Essential for those who appreciate the very best of the best.",1484784000,5,1712,4.906574394463668
7456428,3,B0164CMT8I,"This must have been a tough show for Rush knowing it was likely the last time they would play in their hometown. Unfortunately, the weight of the show seems to have affected the band and their playing sounds tight (as in, tense). It's not that this is a bad show but the band does not seem to find their groove and this is fairly generic live show by Rush standards. I saw them earlier in the tour in Virginia and I thought they sounded very good across the board but I am ultimately disappointed in this effort. More specifically, Geddy's vocals are terrible. He sounds strained and thin and it makes the recording almost unlistenable to me. Overall, the mix is muddy and poorly balanced across instruments which doesn't help. I was also annoyed at the amount of intro crowd noise that precedes the bonus material. Finally, I don't like the way the discs stack in the packaging but I did not take off for that. Quality control seems to be lacking on this effort overall. When compared to Snakes and Arrows Live and Different Stages, two of their best live recordings, this doesn't come close.",1484784000,,1093,4.581632653061225

7456442,3,B0164CMT8I,"A few quick points:
I purchased this DVD for posterity. I was fortunate enough to see this tour, and to note, this was the first time seeing them live since 'Signals', with my very first time seeing them live being the 'Hemispheres' tour and each album's tour up to 'Signals'. So yeah, BIG fan from the Terry Brown production days. Which leads me to comment agreeingly with some of the reviews I read regarding the final audio mix...disappointing at best.

The powers-that-be should've gotten together to have Terry Brown come back to produce / mix / finish / wrap up (since it ended being their final tour) the (insert music/production/writing/song compostion, superaltive adjectives of your choosing here) that is RUSH.  Any doubts???  Find and play a copy of 'All the World's a Stage' (perferably vinyl) from 1976...that's right 40 YEARS of technolgy ago with Terry Brown at the helm. Today's audio engineering, mixes and masterings are sadly focused on the output to the ear being through ear buds and no longer mixed for the audio fan that's wanting to hear the music the way it's intended to be, and it seems this fell prey to that mentality.

But back to the 'show' itself, both being there and seeing it here. POWERFUL, AWE-INSPIRING, etc, as always then and now. From performance to the conceptual theme (great job Howard U, et'al) This DVD is a great and very fitting, Farewell to Kings!",1477353600,8,1397,4.808333333333334

7456469,3,B0164CMT8I,"LOVE Rush, love them to pieces. Always have. I haven't missed a single St. Louis Rush show since the Signals tour (34 years ago now!), and I saw the R40 Tour when it came here. I couldn't wait to get my hands on this Blu Ray! I was elated putting it into the player! I watched the first couple of songs stunned before reality started to sink in, then my wife asked me to please turn it down. I thought I was going crazy at first, but no... it really did sound awful! This is the worst mix of anything I have ever heard by Rush. Hell, the mix was better than this on the Garden Road 45rpm record back when the band were kids! And most grating of all was the painful singing.

Watching this show made me feel very sad. I saw them on this tour when they came to St. Louis and they were great. The sound was great, the show was great, and though you could see all 3 of them struggling, they managed to keep it all together and keep it great all the way to the end. This Toronto show they recorded at the end of their tour however, this is deeply painful to watch. I found myself at the intermission point not wanting to go on because I didn't want to watch these 3 great artists struggle so much any longer. I love this band, they have given us 40+ years of their blood, sweat and tears, and I appreciate it all... but I don't want them to put themselves through this any longer for my benefit. Let's be understanding that all things must come to an end and just let them go now.

What am I talking about? Alex had pain face through most of the show! Geddy was struggling so bad to hit the notes in their old songs that sometimes he starts to look like a crazy old lady shouting at the top of her lungs! Hand that man a rolling pin! And Neil... oh man. I remember watching Exit Stage Left in the olden days and thinking how amazing and accurate and untouchable and unshakable he was. This final show though, you could see him barely keeping up with the frantic pace of the show. He was like one of these 102 year old men running a marathon and showing up at the finish line two days late. The man was in pain! You could tell! He kept it together relatively well, but even that was for nothing since the horrible mixing job of the show decided to totally leave out most of his drums! Let's all just salute them, remember the good times, and put on Exit... Stage Left when we get a hankering for some live Rush. Love the guys, all 3 of them, along with all their ideosyncracies, but the past is gone now. If this show is any indication of what they'd be like if they stayed together and continued, then just let it go. We'll Always have Hemispheres!",1460073600,6,2643,4.1400778210116735
7456470,5,B0164CMT8I,"What fantastic filming and sound editing of this show. Being a Rush fan for many years, I have listened to all of their live recordings and I would have to say that ""Time Machine"" ""Clockwork Angels"" and now R40 have to be the best recorded shows they ever made, but this one stands above the rest, because of the unique camera angles and the mixing of the audio track were just superbly fantastic. A lot of concert DVD's jump around and you don't get a chance to view each performer in certain climatic sections of a song such as a Neil Peart drum roll through XYZ, Geddy doing one of his amazing Bass lines that are such a big part of the band. And of course Alex, being Alex, whether it him being goofy on stage to get the fans going or watching him scorch through a solo, or watch him play a beautiful intro into ""Closer of the Heart"". The one thing that really irritates me are the people who have written reviews stating that Geddy's voice is gone. I went to the San Jose Show, just a few shows left before they ended the tour and probably their career's, but Geddy's voice was fine and as sharp as ever, and watching other shows that were recorded during the tour on youtube, you could tell he was singing very strongly. I just believe that Geddy unfortunately had either a cold or his voice was a little strained because in certain parts of the two shows that they played to record this DVD, you could tell he was strong on certain songs and in some others his voice was a bit strained. It's unfortunate that he wasn't exactly 100%, but the man still can still sing without a doubt, and judging him on one performance and saying that he was done, was incredibly inaccurate! At the San Jose show my daughter couldn't believe how good they sounded and she told me, this sounds exactly like their records, and yes she was right. I have seen Rush at least 10 times in my life and I have never been disappointed. If anything they have gotten better and better over the years. So what a way to go out in a bang, with a stunningly recorded DVD. I am just so glad that I got a chance to see them one last time (the tickets sold out in 10 minutes-BTW for that show I went to) There will never be another band like them. Three incredibly talented gentleman who just never slowed down........they just got better with age. I will miss them, but I will be very happy to say that I got to see them one last time. Anyway, this is the Blu-Ray of Blu-Ray's for any Rush fan with ""Clockwork Angels"" and ""Time Machine"" right behind them. Just fantastic!!  Thank you Geddy, Alex, and Neil for inspiring me to want to be a novice guitarist and drummer. You just made me want to pick up a guitar and try to figure out every trick you ever pulled off. But I will certainly never be at your level of expertise, but is anybody at your ability level? I don't think so.......that is my opinion only. Go get this everyone, you will be very happy you did.
And thank you RUSH for an incredible 40 years of amazing musicianship!!",1459987200,,3006,4.301587301587301

7456472,2,B0164CMT8I,"One more excellent show with very questionable sound quality. See, the problem here isn't the show at all, it is an incredible collection of RUSH songs, with over the top performances from all 3 guys, as usual. The problem is the mix. The only microphone that is actually turned on at Neil's kit is at the snare drum. All other sounds from his kit are coming from ambient microphones it seems. A very bad mistake the mixing guy did was with the microphone Geddy sings on near his keyboard. It's gated, meaning only when he sings it ""opens"" up for the sound of his voice. But guess what, Neil's cymbals come to life when Geddy sings on that mic, because THAT'S the mic that is capturing the cymbal sounds. Listen to subdivisions in DTS HD and you'll hear that amateur mixing mistake. It's on all songs. Neil basically **hammers** those drums and cymbals, but there are no place for them in a mix that only cares about Geddy's voice and Alex's guitar -- those two voices are extremely loud in the mix. When you listen to a song like Jacob's Ladder where there are so many light notes being played by Neil, you'll be disappointed as none of those notes come through. I would have given this 100 stars if perhaps a professional audio engineer have mixed the audio. Unfortunately, the sound quality is amateur at best. I have seen demo mixes made in garages that sound better than this. It's a shame because they are playing so well and so loud (you can see their efforts) and that's too bad they let someone ruin their work by mixing it incorrectly.

Update: Just so you have an idea, their 1984 ""Grace Under Pressure"" tour live concert (in 2CH Stereo) sounds much better!

7456501,2,B0164CMT8I,"I'm a major Rush fan, as you can tell.  Not a fan-boy/girl as I wouldn't intrude on their personal space to get an autograph or start bowing in front of them as to worship or idolize.  But I have been a fan since 1974 before Neil joined their family.  Glad that Neil to want to be with his Family and kids.  I expected an end of Rush about 3 years ago (1/2016 now) at least in Concerts.  I've listened to Geddy's voice changing when he's singing, but the music is still awesome!  When he stays in the lower vibrations he sounds fine.  I gotta admit, I miss those high pitches.

 The Blu-ray...because of the previous Blu-rays I expected very good quality this time.  Very disappointed!!  There are moments through the entire video where the frame-rates aren't smooth.  It is most notable in the beginning animation (though it all) AND when Camera views pan left or right.  I am really into video aesthetics, like Interlacing, FPS 23.976, 29 FPS, etc, etc...how video looks through Cable TV in Standard Definition and High Def.  This is a little surprising to me since it's 2016 and video quality has improved greatly since even 2010.  XviD, AVC, and more.  How did this get past inspection of processing??

 When this arrived in my Mailbox I sat to enjoy the concert again that evening.  First I made a copy with BD Rebuilder (and AnyDVD HD) because I don't like to play my Originals though Blu-ray is a higher quality and more scratch resistant.  It's Rush.  In the process of making the copy I noticed some ""tell"" signs that it's not well mastered.  FARKLE!!  I won't go into details here, but I knew something isn't going to be right with the video.  Once the copy was made (not a 1-step process) I burned it and played the Concert.  I am very experienced at this stuff so anyone reading, I do understand how to copy and burn..and check media being used.
  When I watched the opening animation I spotted it soon.  But I thought, ""Okay...a little glitch there..I'll let it go in my mind."" and started getting into the well-made animation (Animate Me..hehe), and then the songs (though I admit I cringed a couple times when Geddy sang...wow...he sounds different now..)..  But let that go, his age, and other stuff.  He's still our Awesome Front-man with great attitudes and understanding when dealing with over-reacting fans.  A bit into it, there's that video ""glitch"" again...and later again....I couldn't escape it!!  The video isn't smooth when it happens.  The Rerendered backup cleared SOME of it, but....this is, from a very detailed awareness of video, not a good production.
 I'm keeping it because I'm cool with supporting our Stooges and Musics Finest, but...otherwise I'm not a fan of this Blu-ray at all.  I'll go back to the other previous Concerts now from now on.  I also checked with others I know and found their Blu-rays also had it.  So...  This should be remade and reissued!!!  I'd gladly accept a better quality.  I'll play the CDs from now on.  Laughing, this is what you notice when you're really into detailed quality.  Nothing against Rush, they're more into their music and I know they rely on others for production.

 A slight bummed fan with Buddha awareness....it's cool.  I thought others might like to know.  Some others might play theirs and wonder but not to know what to look for.",1454198400,3,3318,4.6921739130434785

7456520,4,B0164CMT8I,"For the celebration of the 40 and plus years of existence of the band, they went on tour in North America. This show was filmed in Toronto, their hometown. The band wanted to make things as usual, different with new visuals. The concept was to get back in time with the technology at first, the presence of the amplifier on stage, to the beginning of the band when they remove those amplifiers to see the band play with a curtain and no light show. Also the use of the screen to illustrate some animated videos on many songs was restricted to the minimum.

The show start with the strait forward hard rock number ""The Anarchist"" who his a favorite for the Rush fans. This is followed by 2 songs from their last two albums. Then for the first time, ""How it Is"" is played live, which seems to me like a odd choice considering that ""Vapor Trails"" contains more interesting songs. But playing ""Losing it"" for the first time with the original violin player Ben Mink was special, the song is the highlight of this rather disappointing first set list. The second set begin with 3 more favorite tracks before getting to the more progressive and longer tracks. ""Natural Science"" and for the first time in more than 30 years, ""Jacob's Ladder"" is played with all the laser effect needed to fit with this atmospheric song. Then the band did medleys of the Cygnus X suite before getting to ""Xanadu"". The encore brings back another rare song : ""Lakeside Park"".

The camera work and editing are very pleasant with long shots of each members and there's some nice balance between distant and close camera shots. David Bottrill did a good job compare to the Clockwork Angels DVD with more bass sound and this time Neal's drums are heard a lot more. There's 3 bonus song on the Blu-Ray and 6 on the CD. It's a bit of a of a let down that those 3 extra songs were not available for us to see.

I'm fortunate to have a brother with kick ass speakers, and the ground shook during the beginning of The Camera Eye, just like at the show.

It just isn't as thick and meaty as R30. Obviously, there are some different songs if you prefer Rush's newer stuff. I don't. But even their great old songs don't grab me on this disc like they do on R30. Alex's playing isn't quite as clean as R30. Hey, Alex is 62. As an older guitarist myself I know how much harder it is to get those fingers moving. I don't mind a few mistakes, but I can't live with the sound because the lackluster sound just makes the performance lackluster also. The intermission video is funny, but ultimately this is one and done for me. Get R30 instead.

While the sound quality was horrible, the stage show was great, and they have never played better in my opinion. I have all Rush live videos and wanted to add this one to my collection, particularly since it may be their final big dance. And the process of going back in time was really cool! With all of that said, I must say that I was very disappointed in the set list. Understanding that they have an extensive catalog, I feel that it could have been much better. Everyone has his or her favorite songs, but to completely ignore Presto, Power Windows, and Hold Your Fire...and to leave out Limelight! And I'll probably be hated for this statement...everybody knows that Neil is the greatest drummer ever...he makes that evident on every song! So, he could have bypassed the drum solo, and subbed it for another song. Anyway, the set list could have been much better in my opinion. But to me, the biggest problem and criticism is Geddy's voice. It's terrible. I have the greatest respect for these guys. They are phenomenal! I understand that these guys are not spring chickens any more, but his voice is gone.

Just before watching R40 Live, I had watched Peter Gabriel's Back to Front: Live in London blu-ray, which sounded amazing.

Rush in Rio was very bad in the beginning but got much better as the show went on.  Ok, I heard the concert on XM radio prior to release and thought I has to be better on the Video with my top notch home system and was proved wrong.  I was so bad but was able to get through the whole show.  At the end of every song they had tons of feedback that led me to believe it may have been a bad copy.  I took it back to BestBuy and got another copy then ultimately found out it was the same.  The sound cuts out in the rear channels as if Jimmy Page was messing with nobs trying to make the songs sound like A Whole Lotta Love!  It's sad to hear Geddy's voice so tapped out and I must say, I saw this show in Austin Texas and he sounded good.  The bottom line is, I will always love them but will continue to  Snakes and Time Machine!  For the folks who haven't purchase this video beware, if you want it complete your collection, have at it!  My only gripe is they should have recorded way earlier in the tour but understand the thought of having it filmed in their hometown!  Wish the promoters would have scheduled it in the beginning of the tour, then had one final show to send them off!

7456547,5,B0164CMT8I,"I am so relieved that Rush have after many disappointing DVD/Bluray releases brought out something that is just brilliant.  I think we are all aware that on tour, the guys are brilliant and the only chink in the armour lies with Geddy's voice (but we love him anyway for all he does).  The tour was great, and the concert film is great too.  The audio is crisp and clean, the sound is tight, and the show well captured on film.  Not as much up close filming as some of the other shows but it is less hectic and because their is the big screen behind Neil you get the best of both worlds.  I like it a lot and I heard it at a friends house who has a great set up - 10ft x 6ft screen, $5,000 beamer, super 5.1 sound system and proper acoustic damping.  Ten of us watched it and we were all really impressed with it.
Many of the posts on Amazon about this show are hard for me to understand.  Why post about something you have not seen?  If you want perfection, listen to Farewell to Kings or get the outstanding 24bit Hemispheres.  But this is a complex show and it sounds on this DVD very much like the real thing, which I flew 12h to Vegas to see.  It is a great representation of the live show and I will be wearing this DVD down - it will become a staple in my basement.

Sadly each consecutive better quality DVD/BluRay production and audio mix keeps improving, the music they've been creating since they went heavily into keyboards and now back out again...I feel the compositions have suffered. I understand creative expansion. I understand from personal experience how tough it is to keep reinventing yourself and keep things fresh and interesting to those in the band. They've ALWAYS done the music that makes them happy and because of that simple uncompromising dedication and risk in their early years created the massive fan base they have now. I still think that out of their authorized DVDs Exit Stage Left which was their first is still their best followed by Rush in Rio.

I have bought all previous concert DVDs and all of them sounded bad. The first thing I said to myself was, I hope they do not screw up this one too.
Well they did screw it up. OMG, I couldn't believe how bad the sound is on this DVD. There is nothing good about the sound. Some parts of the DVD do not even match the video. This is the last concert video Rush will ever release and what a disappointment.",1449446400,5,582,3.899159663865546
7456553,5,B0164CMT8I,"A Rush concert is very much like witnessing a phenomenon that rarely ever happens. Here are 3 battle-hardened progressive rock vets who go out on stage and play for 3 hours every night to arenas whose attendances on average range from nearly sold-out to completely sold-out, with an intermission between halves to let the audience take in what they just saw in the first half and prepare for the second part of it. Usually the second part of the show is far more immense and has some of their more intellectually challenging material, which almost always makes for a more spectacular stage show- lasers, pyros, strobe lighting and what have you. But the show as a whole is just a mesmerizing spectacle from start to finish. Just as much of a spectacular experience as the special effects is the musicians themselves. You have Geddy who is a pure musical acrobat- singing, playing bass and playing two types of synthesizers (one which he controls with his feet), Alex who just casually rips thousands of notes off his fretboard with such precision, and Neil, who always looks like he's doing intense paperwork with how complex his drum work is. Given that this is only three people we are talking about, it's a wonder that any of this sounds as good as it does live. And this spectacle thankfully has carried over to what sadly looks to their final tour: the R40 tour, celebrating 40 years of touring with mean machine Neil Peart. But at the same time, if this indeed their last tour, they've chosen one hell of a note to go out on. I went to see two shows on this tour in the summer- one in Calgary and one in Vancouver, and both left me in pure amazement at how a band as old as them could still have so much energy and perform with so much gusto. And thankfully, this energy is captured in their latest concert video and live album, named after the tour.

As enjoyable as [I]The Clockwork Angels Tour[/I] was, it suffered from a number of technical flaws- namely an audio mix where Neil was almost inaudible at times, machine gun editing (seriously... this trend needs to end) and way too many crowd shots. The CD release was more enjoyable, but you'd think the visual counterpart would be properly mixed too. I'm happy to report that no such technical issues take place on this release- the camera shots last long enough with little to no constant switching, and in addition, there's some really stunning camera shots to be seen here too. In fact, a number of shots move across the stage from way up in the upper bowl down to the lower- something that is practically rare in concert movies nowadays. There are crowd shots, but they're thankfully kept to a minimum too. The colours are also well done, whereas [I]The Clockwork Angels Tour[/I] suffered from an overheated contrast, making reds seem almost artificial at times. Thankfully no such problems are to be detected here. Additionally, the audio mixes are all stunning and really must be played at maximum volume. There are a few volume dips here and there in the DTS HD track which do sort of detract from the experience at times, but they're thankfully far and in between. As far as performance goes, this is also one of their most stunning performances yet.

So Geddy Lee indeed has suffered from his voice showing some wear, but to be fair, it happens to every singer, and it's un-ignorable here. But the sheer energy he has on stage more than makes up for it. He looks well, and looks as if he's really enjoying what he's doing. He's his usual hyper self on stage, running and bouncing around and just generally having a grand old time. Additionally, he can still hit some really great high notes here and there, and his most impressive performance is during ""Xanadu"" with his double neck bass and guitar combo- though I am a tad biased, because said song was the absolute standout of both times I saw them live on this tour. It's also worth noting that Alex Lifeson was diagnosed with arthritis and Neil suffers from chronic tendinitis, and if their performances on this tour are any indication, you wouldn't be able to tell. Neil performs multiple monstrous drum solos, the most amazing of which happens during ""Cygnus X-1"". The guy is just an absolute beast, and just hammers the royal frak out of those drums with tons of feel and power. Alex's guitar playing is, as always, more proof that he doesn't deserve to just be reduced to by most people as ""the other guy in Rush"". His solo during ""YYZ"" here is among one of his best performances yet! Setlist-wise, R40 is definitely one of their best concerts yet. The show starts at the [I]Clockwork Angels[/I] era and goes back to their self titled debut album, which also makes for an amazing encore with classics that haven't been performed in many years like ""Lakeside Park"" and ""What You're doing"". We even get the rarely-performed ""Jacob's Ladder"" and ""Cygnus X-1"", and almost all of ""2112"". The show even mirrors this with the set-up guys dressed in construction garb and replacing Geddy and Alex's stage equipment- in example, it begins with the most recent popcorn maker and brain in a jar, then goes back to stacks of amps, and even just amps on a chair. It was magical to see live, and thankfully the magic is recaptured on the blu-ray.

There's nothing Rush can't do, and as always, their live albums are sheer and utter proof of this. [I]R40 Live[/I] is proof that there's still plenty left in the tank for these legendary Canadians, yet if they're going out from touring in the future, then they've chosen an awesome note to go out on. [I]R40 Live[/I] is a stunning look at the band's 41 year career with a setlist that spans all eras of Rush's amazing catalogue, a defiantly youthful performance, and a sense of urgency and energy that cannot be found in a lot of newer bands of today.",1449360000,4,5813,4.630813953488372

Why does Alex's distorted guitar overpower everything?  Why so much constant crowd noise in the back channels?  I don't want my Blu-ray to sound like I was in the 20th row!  I want something clearer, better balanced.  Certainly they have the tracks to do this, so why the atrocious result?

If you're going to error always error on more rather than less with a drummer like Neil Peart, who would ever complain that Neil's  drums overpower the music?",1449273600,2,491,4.833333333333333
7456557,5,B0164CMT8I,"Well, I remember before R40 ever came out, Amazon had more than a handful of reviews posted here with people slagging it. It's always a bit of a head scratcher for me how people can slam something prior to its release & most of the carping was the usual complaints about any Rush concert release--i.e. the audio quality.

At any rate--if this is to be the band's final concert and tour--then I would say that Geddy, Alex and Neil definitely go out with a bang. The setlist was superb & the sound to my ears was excellent & I'm hardly an audiophile, but I believe I know good quality when I hear it. I was also wondering how some of the songs off of ""Clockwork Angels"" would sound without the string accompaniment, but after watching ""The Anarchist"" and ""Headlong Flight,"" I can honestly say I didn't miss the violins at all. Rush definitely knocked those 2 songs out of the ballpark.

I was also glad to see ""Distant Early Warning"" was brought back into the setlist--something they had not played since ""Snakes And Arrows.""

Overall, I would say this was a great swan song for Rush--if it is indeed their last hurrah. Thanks Alex, Geddy and Neil for over 40 years of awesome music.

7456566,4,B0164CMT8I,"I own every live Rush DVD or Blu-Ray ever produced.  I saw them live on the R40 tour in San Jose, CA. When I heard that this Blu-Ray was produced by the same folks that released the Clockworks Angels disaster Blu-Ray - I was very concerned that R40 would be the same. I was pleased to find R40 to be a dramatic improvement over CA.  As a video producer by trade, I was very impressed with the video quality of this release. The pace of cuts was slowed quite a bit over earlier shows - a welcome break from the frantic editing that seems to plague so many live releases these days. The quality of the video is impressive - with what appears to be large imager cameras and 24fps production throughout. The 24fps capture and Blu-Ray delivery do show tell-tale image strobing in some scenes. But the video quality played on my Oppo player was excellent.  The audio - however - as listened to in DTS-HD 5.1 - still left a lot to be desired. It was a HUGE improvement over CA - which I can't listen to - but still no where as good as R30 or Time Machine.  I'm lucky to listen to my music on a very high-end system - so I believe I am hearing a very accurate reproduction of what is in this mix.  It is difficult to put a finger on exactly why - but the largest issue seems to be the same one that plagued CA - that is mixing in way too much concert hall sound and way too little direct audio of the instruments. Neil's drums are very distant through much of the mix.

Another factor is this - - and don't get me wrong - I think they played great - but they are just not at the level they were 10 years ago - nor do I expect them to be. I have not seen any great rock act whose members are pushing 70 that sound like they did when they were kids. But I will listen to Rush any day, any time - over the crap that is being produced today. . . . .Also - there also seems to be a little less use of backing tracks than there used to be.

Bottom line - this is a release worth owning. Some cuts are mixed better than others - and some really stand out - like Jacob's Ladder.  If this is Rushs' swan song - then it is as fitting a farewell to their career as Celebration Day was for Zeppelin.",1448755200,3,2179,3.9931034482758623
7456567,5,B0164CMT8I,"I love it. A few things:

1. Geddy's voice - not as strong as when I saw them earlier on the tour (saw the Austin, TX gig), which I guess is slightly disappointing but totally understandable, however,

2. The Austin gig had technical problems that would be unacceptable on a concert blu ray - like the batteries for the wireless pack for Alex's acoustic dying at the beginning of Closer to the Heart, stuff like that. This concert, filmed later in the tour, has all of those kinks worked out.

3. I'm a millennial (just barely), so that predisposes me to think the manic video editing people have complained about in prior concert films has always been just fine. I guess the editing is less manic this time, but again that never bothered me to begin with.

4. Sound is awesome. DTS 5.1 sounds terrific. Mix isn't 100% perfect all the time, but I don't think it can be.

5. SETLIST. Let's be honest, you come for the Rush farewell tour, but you stay for the incredible amount of early 80s and late 70s tunes that diehards love. When I saw Jacob's Ladder live, it was truly a bucket list kind of moment for me. The 2nd set is especially great.

6. If you buy the 3CD/Blu Ray combo, you get extra audio tracks from alternate setlist nights on the tour that didn't make it onto video here (who knows why), like The Camera Eye, Clockwork Angels, and The Wreckers. Or you can Spotify those tracks ;)",1448755200,,1394,4.404669260700389

7456569,3,B0164CMT8I,In the first set the sound is great but the drums on the second set don't sound good at all. It sounds like the mic's are not close enough to the toms. The snare and cymbals come through just fine but its hard to hear the toms. To a drummer this is very disappointing.,1448668800,2,268,3.9814814814814814
7456570,5,B0164CMT8I,"If C/work Angels was a disappointment to me, R40 managed to exceed my expectations. The cinematography is by far the best ever on a Rush concert, & the audio is so much better than CA. The editing can still be a little fast-paced at times but it's better than most concerts done these days. It's a pleasure to watch & listen to(at obnoxiously high volume settings of course!). One of, if not their best. Geddy sounds fine, & anyone saying otherwise has skewed expectations. It's a fitting tribute to a career of over 40 years together, & the set-list is to drool over. You get a lot of rare gems here, a perfect compliment to their other releases. I've been a fan since 1974 (us Canucks had a head start on the rest of the world), & this graybeard would like to say that if this is your last full-blown concert release, then thank you fellas' for going above & beyond for us.

7456572,3,B0164CMT8I,"Full disclosure: I do not believe there is a better band on this planet than Rush. Musically and lyrically, they simply have no peer, with the possible exception of Iron Maiden (who aren't any better, but I believe are just as good all around). Anything Rush puts out is worth three stars. That said...

This concert video suffers the same problem as the Clockwork Angels DVD, and that's one of timing. See, when I read the reviews of the CA Tour video, I thought the people complaining were dead wrong, because they kept complaining about Geddy's voice. I saw Rush on that tour in Atlanta and Geddy was fine. Same with R40. We saw them in Atlanta and the voice was strong and steady, as good as I've ever heard him.

Then we got the CA video and it wasn't very good. Same with R40. Geddy's voice on this disc is _awful_. I'm sorry, there's just no other way to say that. But when we saw them he was fine. This concert, like the CA disc, was recorded later in the tour. If they had filmed an early concert, it would have been better. Geddy's throat has been punished for decades while Rush put out stellar records and gifted us fans with the best shows they could put on and it simply can't bounce back from that nightly grind the way it used to. That's all. What I don't understand is, after the experience of the CA Tour vid, why not film _every_ concert, or at least half of them, then make a decision at the end as to which to put out as ""official""?

Maybe we'll get lucky and they'll get together for a one-time-only performance somewhere and record that so we can have a recording of Geddy when he's rested and strong. We can only hope.",1448323200,2,1642,4.324675324675325

One of them kept saying ""Rush"" over and over again, while dancing joyfully when I put this video on for the first time.  That was too cool!  They are real rock-heads!  They highly approve of R-40... and so do I.  It is first-rate!  We also like Time Machine a lot too... as well as the Rush Replay X 3, among others.  A few nights ago, I asked the birds what they want to watch on TV... I said, ""Do you want to watch Sesame Street or Rush?"" (They like Sesame Street and the Muppets a lot, by the way.)  One bird, eating at the time, lifted her head out of the food-bowl and firmly said ""Rush!""  We humans aren't the only ones who appreciate great music!  Next they'll be asking me to take them to a concert!  :)",1448236800,5,822,4.037267080745342
7456574,4,B0164CMT8I,"I have a problem with the disc itself. It will only play in one of our three players, and only after getting numerous error messages about not being able to play/read the disc in it too. but I am not going to let that reflect on the score. My score is on the content itself. I've been a rabid Rush fan since 2112. My first show was 11/13/77 on the ""A Farewell To Kings"" tour. The video quality is perfect. The audio, once you pick the right choice for your system, is awesome. My only reason for dropping it a star, and man it pains me to say this, is the same thing someone else said. Geddy's voice. I'm not sure what is going on there. He can hit the high notes, as he does in ""Lakeside Park"", but on many of the songs, too many, he sounds strained and muffled. On some of the songs he sounds like you would expect the vocalist in a Rush tribute band to sound, meaning like Geddy, but not quite Geddy. And it happens on songs at both ends of his range. Maybe these happened to be bad nights where he was strained. He's been belting it out for over 40 years, and I'm sure it gets harder every year. I wouldn't call it bad, but he just doesn't sound right on most of the songs. Neil leaves out a couple of important fills in ""Presentation"", but again, he has a tough job for someone his age. At the show I was at he left out that all important fill in the middle of ""Natural Science"". I can let that slide. The setlist is awesome. With a band like Rush you will always have a bunch of songs that you would have loved to hear, but they can't do 20 hour shows. They chose these songs well. A fitting retrospective of their career. Enjoy your rest gentlemen, you deserve it.",1448236800,,1671,4.113149847094801
7456575,5,B0164CMT8I,"This is a very special release that stands out from all other Rush live albums. Sure, Exit Stage Left and All the World's a Stage are iconic, and are classics that will stand the test of time forever. But what makes this Blu-ray stand above those other live albums? Variety. You're getting a top-notch performance lasting almost 3 hours that recognizes every progression in Rush's history. The set list is played in reverse-chronological order from material from their latest album ""Clockwork Angels"" right on down to the classic ""Working Man"" from their debut (there's even a 'sting' at the end from an even earlier song called ""Garden Road"")

Rush really wanted to cover all the bases. This show contains enough ""hit"" material to satisfy the casual radio listener (Tom Sawyer, Spirit of Radio, Closer to the Heart...), and it also delivers plenty of deep cuts and rarities that those listeners had never heard before (epics such as Natural Science, Xanadu, Cygnus X-1). There's even a couple of songs played on this tour that had never been performed before, such as ""How It Is"" from Vapor Trails. The biggest surprise of the evening was when they played, for the first time ever, ""Losing It"" with special guest violinist Ben Mink (who recorded the original violin part for that song on the Signals album). It was also a real treat to hear ""Jacob's Ladder"", which hadn't been played live since the Permanent Waves tour 35 years ago.

Now, if you have heard live shows that Rush has released in recent years, like ""Snakes and Arrows Live"", ""Time Machine Tour"", or ""Clockwork Angels Tour"", you are probably familiar with the very poor sound quality of these albums. The audience drowns out the band, the drums are hard to hear, keyboards are buried under the wall of static, bass is washed out, and Alex's guitars are overly saturated and muddy sounding...

THIS IS NOT THE CASE WITH R40 LIVE.

Mixed by David Botrill (same dude who re-mixed Vapor Trails and made it actually sound good!), this concert features crisp and clear audio with plenty of breathing room and dynamics. In general, audience volume is managed very well, and never drowns out the music. There are a few times when Neil's toms and cymbals are overpowered by guitar and keyboard (like at the beginning of Spirit of Radio""), but for the majority of the show, his drums are nice and clear. Alex's guitars are powerful as ever, yet clear and comprehensible. Geddy's basses are finally up front in the mix, nice and crunchy! You can even hear how the sound varies as he switches basses between each song. Geddy's voice was strong that night (although still showing his age, but hey, he's in his 60's!). Keyboards are present in the mix, and very thick and rich sounding (especially on 80's tracks like ""Subdivisions"" and ""Between the Wheels"")

One really interesting thing to watch throughout the show is the stage setup. Rush has always been known to have weird stuff on stage with them (rotisserie ovens, clothes dryers, rerigerators, sausage grinders, popcorn machines, you name it...), and they made sure to morph their stage setup according to how far back they ""traveled"" through time. Of course for Clockwork Angels they had the most recent ""steampunk"" gizmos on stage with them. Then as they moved backward to the early 2000's and 1990's, the stage crew came out and removed these items and replaced them with dryers and different styles of amplifiers (none of which were actually hooked up). During intermission they were right at the early 80's (between Moving Pictures and Signals), and Neil's drum set was switched out with one that closely resembled his kit from that time period, including the towering tubular bells stood up behind him (which he used during Jacob's Ladder, Closer to the Heart, and Xanadu). As they approached the end of the show, which represented their starting point in the early 70's, the stage had been reduced to small amps propped up on school chairs, with a backdrop showing a high school gymnasium and a disco ball. It was also cool to see how Geddy and Alex changed up their guitars so frequently throughout the show. Most AWESOMELY during Xanadu, when Alex played his white double-neck Gibson, and Geddy played his double-neck Rickenbacker 4080/12, just as they did back in the 70's!

I'm sure it shows, but I am so very overwhelmed by how EXCELLENT R40 Live is. It was pure joy being able to see this show in person, and just as enjoyable to re-live it at home. Much thanks to Rush and their crew for putting on such incredible shows even after 40 years.

TL;DR: Buy it. It's worth every cent. Do it. JUST DO IT!",1448150400,19,4623,4.79297365119197

7456577,5,B0164CMT8I,Best Rush concert video ever. I was able to see this tour live and could not wait for the Blu-ray release. I have purchased every Rush video that has ever been released. The production on this video is a step up from any other. The audio clarity and mixing are awesome. I can finally hear that Bass clearly in every song. The video production has also been improved. They used more cameras than in the past showing amazing detail. Rush always puts on a great show and the set design and lighting are better than ever.,1448150400,2,517,4.395833333333333
7456578,5,B0164CMT8I,"I admit I'm kind of biased, I have been a Rush fan since 1982 and I drove all the way to Toronto from St. Louis to see these shows so there wasn't much chance that I wasn't going to like this. (People there asked me, ""Didn't Rush come to St. Louis?"" ""Yeah about a month ago. And your point is?"") I haven't watched the whole thing yet, I've watched about 2/3 so I don't know if there are any shots of me in it yet but I think I can see myself in one of the photos!

I really like the way that this is edited, there are lots of close up shots of the band which is what I want to see, it shows what was hard to see even from row 20. When you're in the crowd you usually only see the top of Neil's head so it was good to see a lot of close-ups of him in particular. There are some crowd shots which make me laugh and smile, seeing people going nuts in the crowd reminds me of how I was acting and what a good time I had. I don't think there is an excess of crowd shots. They do tend to show some of the same people several times. I think the editing went with the mood of the songs and really enhanced them.

I'm not a big movie/video/DVD watching person, I don't have a great setup for watching this. The best place for me to watch it at home is on my Mac computer with my Bose SoundLink Color speaker hooked up to it. I live in a condo so when I really want to rock out I listen to music while driving my Jeep or use headphones so my neighbors don't get mad. On this limited equipment the sound and picture were very enjoyable. I was bouncing up and down in my computer chair and playing air drums and feeling my heart rate go up. Even the other band members can't resist playing air drums at times as you will see. If you watch this in a home theater setting with good sound you should REALLY like it if you like Rush. If you can stay sitting down I'd be surprised! I'm glad the audience mostly stands the whole time at their shows because I've always found it hard to listen to Rush sitting down! I'm pleased it played on my circa 2008 Mac at all - I wasn't sure if it would. My brother has a copy too so I'm looking forward to watching it at his house sometime, he has a huge TV and the right sound system for something like this.

All Rush shows are great, that's why if budget allows I have tried take in more than one show on each tour, but these performances were especially good in person. I don't know if this DVDs performances are all from Friday night's show or some Wednesday night songs are in here but it seems to be mostly (if not all) Friday's show which was the better of the two. If my memory is correct I think they wore the same clothes both nights so I figured when the DVD came out it wouldn't be that easy to tell which night it is from unless it was Headlong Flight (if you were there you knew they weren't going to use Wed. night's version!) or one of the songs they only did one night out of the two.

I don't have a whole lot of concert DVDs in my library that aren't Rush so it's hard to compare it to what other bands put out. Based on what I've seen if you only get one Rush DVD, get this one first, Rush in Rio second and R30 third. Oh heck just get all of them! But get this one first!

I don't know if any bands put out concert DVDs that give you the option to watch the whole show as it happened in order with nothing rearranged or placed in a bonus section, that is the only thing I can think of that would improve this. I have never seen a rock concert DVD or video like that (unless it was fan-made) but I admit I haven't seen all that many. I don't understand why that isn't the standard format but I'll take what I can get. Is there a way to make a custom playlist with the bonus selections inserted where they go in the running order? If so that is how I would prefer to watch any concert film but the running order was especially important in this show, it was a critical part of the presentation. I guess I won't say why in case it's a spoiler for those who didn't see it in person.

I got the version with the three audio CDs and I can't wait to play them in my Jeep. I may update this review when I've had a chance to listen to them. Listening to them in my condo is NOT a good idea because Rush needs to be CRANKED. I will probably get a lot more use out of the audio CDs than the DVD in the coming years, but I'm thrilled to have the visuals available to ""live it all again"" when I'm in the mood!",1448150400,2,4440,3.9387527839643655
7456579,5,B0164CMT8I,"Loved this blu-ray. After seeing R40 in Seattle at Key Arena, I was looking forward to seeing the show on my home system. Key Arena is not the best venue, and the sound was terrible for the first 5 or 6 songs until somebody told the sound guy he should probably back off a little. The blu-ray sounds very nice and it was good to have different sound choices. There are different audio options for both surround and 2 channel stereo. I liked the Dolby 2.0 mix personally. It sounded a little clearer the the DTS version. At least to my ears. I haven't tried either of the full surround mixes yet but will do so after getting my fill of 2.0. I usually listen on headphones anyhow. The clarity of the video itself is fantastic. Nice shots of the band doing their thing and having fun doing it. As other reviewers have noted, the shots of the band are sustained and is focused nicely on the instruments.  I also liked seeing a couple of songs not on the set in Seattle. Losing It was so nice to see live and Red Barchetta is always a treat. I was hoping to see The Camera Eye on this blu-ray as it is one of my favorites and was on the Seattle set, but I saw them a couple of times live for Time Machine so I guess that's ok. Overall this is a excellent addition to my dvd/blu-ray collection and look forward to watching it many times as any Rush fan would. I would definitely recommend this to any Rush fan or even to just the casual listener.",1448064000,4,1440,4.1985559566787005
7456580,4,B0164CMT8I,"First off: Geddys voice. Get over it. Have you seen all the things he does on stage.  Pedals, Keyboard, Bass, Singing. Geddy is the man, all there is to it.
Secondly: Alex. Is Alex enjoying himself?  I don't know. I know he has arthritis and so do I.  I know I get up in the morning and go to work and it hurts, but the government says I'm too young to retire without losing a big chunk of my retirement to them for drawing it early. So I go to work. So maybe Alex is playing for us, he damn sure doesn't need the money. He's still the best on a Floyd Rose. Fact.
Last but not least. Neil. Awesome. Do I wish that Neil recognized the fan base a little more?  Yeah I do. To me it's my big hang up with Rush. But I love these guys, so that's the way it is.
R40:
A marked improvement in audio quality over CA. No doubt about that.
Video quality: Awesome!
Direction, Editing, Production: Marginal
They still think we all have an attention disorder and need the screen to change every 3 seconds. I can't stand to watch the the crowd during a Lifeson solo, then come back to him at the end of the solo. Drives me crazy. A solo is the artist releasing emotion from the song to the crowd. That's why the crowd goes crazy at the end of the solo. On a video that emotion should be caught for the viewing audience. That's why we buy the DVD!  That's got to be the director or producers job to tell the editor what goes where and when. Watch a Joe Bonamassa DVD and learn.
Lighting: The last 2 Rush videos & concerts have been full of blue light. I'm tired of blue lights. Everything looks smokey and is hard to see. Maybe the blue light is cooler on the artist.  I know that red and blue light are extremely hard to photograph in.
All in all this production was better than the last effort. I can watch this over and again, unlike CA that is just in my collection because it's Rush.
Rush on a bad day is better than most anyone on a good day. If they do something again, and I think they will, I hope we can get a 5 star performance and a 5 star production. Solid 4 stars everybody.
Update:  I should have put this in my original review. If you want to see an absolute stunning video of Xanadu:
Go to YouTube and search for "" Rush Xanadu Phoenix Front Row 7/27/15"". It's magical. The guy that uploaded is ""Tapehead Too"".  He definitely knows the song and how to operate a camera.

Most concerts are crappy 1080i with frantic camera shots, but this one is 1080p (also plays back at 24 frames) with intelligent camera work that shows the right members at the right time and stays on them long enough. Fantastic set, too. Xanadu!!!",1448064000,2,356,4.666666666666667
7456582,5,B0164CMT8I,"I admit I was a bit nervous watching this, having barely survived the debacle that was the Clockwork Angels DVD, but the R40 DVD is fantastic. The colors on the CA DVD were over saturated, the sound wasn't what it could be, and the editing seemed like it was done by someone getting a commission for every scene change. The R40 has none of those problems - it was a pleasure to watch and listen to.

One really nice thing on this DVD is the camera operators managed to capture Alex and Geddy's fretboards really well, so you can see how they play parts of some of the songs. Instead of just showing it for a fraction of a second and then panning away, the camera stays on them for a bit. Nice touch.

It's also nice that this DVD doesn't have a bunch (or hardly any, really) fan shots. A few for texture, but not the extended scenes like on the Clockwork Angles DVD. Seriously - other than the people being shown, who wants to watch that?",1448064000,4,938,4.264044943820225
7456583,5,B0164CMT8I,"Yes.  5 Stars.  Just so you know, I gave the Clockwork Angels DVD 1 star (that was probably too severe.)

The video is extremely well done.  2 complaints from Clockwork Angels were the excessive video cuts and the muddled drums.  Both are great in this video.  I think the editors did a fantastic job putting together the video, and I noticed there is often more than one piece of action in each shot (which makes it a lot of fun to watch) and they did a great job capturing ""moments"" (one early on has Neil bending over in exhaustion after the solo in Headlong Flight.) I got the Blu-Ray version and the filming is very high quality.

The audio is extremely clear and I have no complaints about that.  As I listen I can pick out each member fairly easily and concentrate on their parts.

Even before this tour it was clear from several interviews that the band was listening to the fans.  I'm glad they did for this video as well - and I think it shows.

If you aren't a Rush fan I think you may find better videos for certain songs in some older videos.  If you are a Rush fan - this video is a must.  The boys are clearly giving it their all for the fans this was a heck of a show (I saw them in Bristol - this one is better.)  We were all hoping for the best.  Guess what?

7456588,5,B0164CMT8I,"Rush has achieved some well-deserved victories in the last few years, and now add another feather to their cap. Rush's new live release is fantastic for many reasons, one being that there is actual artistry to the camera work and editing. It's perfect for the performance that it captures and avoids the pitfall that so many rock videos do: quick cuts that never allow the viewer to focus on any one, specific image. That style of editing that plagues much of my music DVD collection jumps so fast from the singer to the guitarist to the crowd to the drummer to the guitarist (different angle) to the crowd to the bassist to the singer (different angle), etc., etc., that you can't enjoy watching the show. Not the case with R40. The camera in many of the shots slowly pans either the band or one of the members and maintains that focus for several seconds, allowing you to get a full impression of what's happening before shifting to another shot. The pace picks up at times to match the pace of the music, but for a song like Xanadu, it's slow and thoughtful and captures the mood of the moment and the song perfectly. Also, the shots that are the quickest are those of the crowd, never spending too much time on the fans and instead focusing on the stars of the show....the band. This is a big plus for me.

Besides the excellent camera work, this is Rush live, so of course it's good. Neil Peart in particular is mesmerizing to watch. The man is an absolute machine, and he gets an ample amount of face time. Plenty of close-ups and extended shots to show off his incredible skills. The sound of the show overall is humongous, with a thick, hearty thump from Geddy and Neil, and Alex's guitar has a crisp, clean tone. The set list is awesome and extensive, the band sounds great, the camera work is impressive, the visuals and theme of the show are entrancing....not much more you could ask for. If you love Rush and enjoy their live shows, this is a nice one to get that commemorates the many successful eras of their career.",1447977600,30,2030,4.486486486486487
