3486859,5,B001B8MLS4,This is the first of the three movie/dvd which I had to re-purchase after not recieving the correct movie/dvd from another seller. Instead I recieved a previously purchased movie/dvd of the same item and not the one I'm now reviewing. Like the movie and how Itanami Hanzo....the character started his wicked ways of interrigating suspect women. With the samurai action and sexploitation galore.,1390780800,,394,5.26984126984127
3486860,5,B001B8MLS4,"Love it for its comedic effect.  Typical Japanese chauvenistic ""rape em till they fall in love with you"" motif.  If your the serious Kurasawa scholar type this may not be your movie.",1389398400,,182,4.65625
3486861,3,B001B8MLS4,"I lived in Japan for 9 years (1960-1964 and 1968-1973).  I always enjoyed chamballah movies and the Zato-Ichi series especially.  However, the premise of sanctioned rape, no matter the kind of woman, is abhorrent to me and that is an over-riding theme of the ""Hanzo"" series.  The seller provided the requested item in good condition and in a timely manner.  It is the content of the film in which I am disappointed.",1368748800,,415,4.722222222222222
3486862,5,B001B8MLS4,"Good sword work and a good detective story too.......... although maybe they shouldnt call him the RAZOR tho , Watch the flik and you'll see why",1268524800,,144,4.576923076923077
3486863,3,B001B8MLS4,"after all the glowing reviews here i bought it for under $10 from an independent seller here at amazon.  After seeing it, i have to say i didn't think it was all that good, let alone great.  And it wasn't over-the-top enough for me, but anyways...

As a samurai film- it's average.  Only a few action sequences and they all seem minor.  It's a little slow going, but as a movie it's watchable.  There's a small twist to the ending, but it's more of a ""that's it?"" type rather than ""wow, i didn't see that coming"".

As an exploitation film- again, average.  I only saw two rape scenes and they were both kinda tame.  I was more disturbed by the rape scenes in the Sword of Vengeance films.  Now those were violent and had me looking away.

Overall, I guess i thought the film was going to be an over-the-top samurai sex-and-fun flick, but it was a rather serious and somber film.  I guess my biggest gripe was with Hanzo himself.  I liked his opening speech where he explains why he won't sign a contract oath, but other than that the character is rather lifeless with very little personality or humor.  Hanzo(movie and person) is not terrible by any means, but i think everything just comes across as plain and average.  There are much better samurai or sexploitation films to be found elsewhere.  As for a combo of both, Hanzo the Razor is rather tame despite the ""enhanced"" reputation of the film.  Maybe worth a $3 rental, but not the $30 price tag asked at amazon.

For the record, i bought the dvd version with the white background, red title lettering, Hanzo in the middle, and girl's face coming out from the left side; which is a different version that others might have so maybe i got an edited version or something.  My copy only has trailers for the 2 sequels of the series, but i think i'll stop at the first since the other reviewers indicated it's basically more of the same with the sequels.",1251936000,2,1906,4.456647398843931
3486864,4,B001B8MLS4,"Hanzo is cooler than all the other ""loose cannon"" cops in cinema. Period.

About the story though: the plots kind of drops off in the resolution, not really doing a good job of performing resolution.",1246406400,,199,4.685714285714286
3486865,5,B001B8MLS4,"Hanzo Itami is a magistrate who doesn't cut corners.  He doesn't break the rules.  His morals are impeccable.  He fights crime without reservation and without ambiguity.  Unless of course you consider raping your female crime leads and suspects to be a bit dodgy.  Allow me to explain.

Hanzo is not like the other magistrates.  He doesn't take bribes, kick-backs, or engage in any sort of illegality.  What he does is solve crime...with his penis of truth.  Yes, his penis of truth.

Hanzo lives an ascetic lifestyle.  He pounds his legendary male organ - even some of his peers have heard of its magnificence - on a wooden block with something like a mallet in a bizarre form of genitalia torture.  He has intercourse with a bag of hot, uncooked rice.  Aside from the penis mutilation he is also involved in torturing himself in order to better understand those who he investigates and imprisons.  And while investigating a criminal named Killer Kanbei, all of Hanzo's preparation proves fruitful.

Along with his lackeys Viper and Devil-Fire, Hanzo discovers a world of political and police corruption, where high level officers and government officials are involved in keeping Kanbei in Japan, and off of an isolated prison on Hachijo island.  Luckily for Hanzo, and some inside info delivered from a guy who moments before had his face crushed in by Hanzo's sai, he quickly finds his first clue in the form of the police chief's mistress.  After a quick bit of interrogation rape at the hands of the penis of truth - viewers are treated to the first ever vulva-cam - where his suspect eventually begs in sweet agony for more of Hanzo's virility, the plot of police corruption thickens.  When Hanzo follows the clues to a woman higher up in the chain of evidence, he gets the help of his men to put the lady in a hanging, netted basket that Hanzo uses simultaneously as an interrogation sex swing, and interrogation sit-and-spin, and a method to deliver the penis of truth.  She willingly succumbs and delivers even more clues, and shells out all the details during a post-rape sake drinking session in the hot-tub with Hanzo.

With a kicking soundtrack that sounds inspired by the adult industry, some very good production values and camera angles, Hanzo the Razor is full of awesome.  It's laugh out loud funny at times, and you'll cheer at others.  It's just plain cool in a very bizarre, Tarantino sort of way.  The only downside is that the fight choreography doesn't stand up to most of today's action; but it's easy to overlook when considering how incredibly the rest of the movie, much like Hanzo's interrogation suspects, forces the viewer into willing submission.",1230940800,,2678,4.850220264317181
3486866,4,B001B8MLS4,"Hanzo the Razor
he's not always nice
But he punishes the wicked
and impregnates rice
He fights corruption
from above and within
Ladies unwillingly mount him
and are given a spin
An erotic pounding
They become his sex slaves
Forced into submission
It's a pain they soon crave
There's lots to love here
a movie for the sick
Hanzo has some cool weapons
most notably his (sword of justice)
This story has self-mutilation
and the penile workouts are cruel
I definitely know one thing...
70's cinema rules!!!!!!!!!",1230249600,,508,4.850574712643678
3486867,4,B001B8MLS4,"So what exactly is it that makes an enduring grindhouse hero?  Fearlessly defying corrupt authoritarian regimes including the very ones you work for?  Check.  Cool weapons and a bada$z attitude?  Check.  A generous spirit coupled with an iron will and a willingness to do what needs to be done?  Mm hmm.  A huge shlong that's the talk of the town?  Don't see why not.  Raping arrogant women until they fall in love with him and confess their schemes?  Okay, getting a little sketchy there.  Fornicating with rice?  Oh, come on!  Now you're just being ridiculous.  ""Hanzo The Razor: Sword of Justice"" is a the first heroic tale in a trilogy of films about a lowly samura, Japan's self-proclaimed best officer, out to humble the corrupt magistrates of feudal Japan while protecting the downtrodden by any means necessary.  In a lot of ways, Hanzo is the ideal hero.  But on the other hand, this is a 70's exploitation flick to the bone and it goes way out of it's way to shock a reaction out of you for better or worse. If you can find no humor in the notion of a hero who rapes women into love with him at the drop of a hat then this may not be your thing.  It turned me off a little at first viewing, but on the second runthrough after the shock value had worn off I found this to be a damn entertaining chunk of trash cinema with a lot to recommend it.

The great Shintaro Katsu (of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zatoichi/dp/B00073K7JY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zatoichi</a>&nbsp;fame) plays the title role and he plays it to the hilt.  Sneering, smart-alecky, obnoxious, cocky, but able to spring into action at a moment's notice and back it up is The Razor; a far cry from Ichi-san's wise and humble demeanor.  His signature weapon is the coolest I've seen in a samurai film: a sai with a length of weighted chain concealed within.  This and the creative action scenes are arguably the best thing about the film, provided you aren't a pervert.  And if you are, fear not; I don't judge and this film's got you handled.  Ever seen a [...]-eye-view camera shot as it penetrates a beautiful woman?  Didn't think so.  How about an even more beautiful woman being lowered in a net onto the hero's shaft and then spun around and around for about 5 minutes while romantic music plays?  And you've got to love Hanzo's strenuous workout of pouring boiling water on his genitals then pounding on his johnson with a stick (the table even has an indentation in the shape of his junk in it) before making love to a sack of raw rice.  It's true what they say: pimpin' ain't easy.  But his sexual prowess and sweet weaponry are but two of the tools at The Razor's disposal.  He's also got the most elaborate and brutal pest control system ever in his house.  Whether you're a lizard or a ninja assassin, it's best not to trespass into Hanzo's home.  And watching him outsmart his enemies left and right is not without it's satisfaction either; the man's got a wicked mind.  The soundtrack is downright funky and is sure to bring a smile to your lips if not outright laughter.  It sounds like a cross between blaxpoitations's greatest hits and 70's porn (bong chicka bow-wow!).  Love it.

So yeah, if you're looking to see something different and bizarre in old-school samurai cinema, this is your stop.  ""Hanzo The Razor"" gets it done whichever way you want to look at it.  It's not exactly Kurosawa, but if you saw&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lone-Wolf-and-Cub/dp/B000AYNFVC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lone Wolf and Cub</a>&nbsp;and wished for something a little less violent and a lot more unapologetically icky and blatantly offensive than this is a flick that will satisfy.  The story is a little iffy pacing wise -almost comic book-like in it's episodicness- but it entertains from front to back.  The final scene comes off as very tacked on and clashes with the epic shot a the end of Hanzo walking on a giant map of Japan that follows it.  After the killer climax, our (anti)hero stops off for some grub and winds up following an obviously troubled young girl home.  Long story short, he ends up killing a sick old man before going about his merry way, theme song blaring triumphantly.  I'm not sure how much of this film was meant to be humorous, but a great deal of it is.  Either way it only adds to the cool factor because it's all black as hell.

The film was originally released in America under the simple title ""Hanzo the Razor"", but this newer edition uses the full name.  This film was followed by two other ""Hanzo The Razor"" films with the surtitles&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Snare/dp/B0012KRIHU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Snare</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Who-s-Got-the-Gold/dp/B0012KSUN6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Who's Got the Gold?</a>.  They often rely on some of the same gimmicks which is disappointing, but Shintaro Katsu's performances never get old.  And as a disclaimer, I'd like to leave you with a bit of feminine trivia, lest Hanzo's antics give you any ideas (I see you out there, Mackshere).  Women in general don't much care for being raped and will probably not fall in love with you if you attempt to do so.  Expect a knee in the groin at best and possibly prison time where you will likely know what it feels like to be one of Hanzo's victims.  So remember, kids; Hanzo The Razor in the movies: good, Hanzo the Razor in real life: bad.",1228867200,6,5571,5.002173913043478
8282247,1,B001B8MLS4,I'm rating the sale.  I ordered then returned and ordered again.  Neither disc worked in either of my three disc players.  I think these were not North American discs although they were listed as such.,1492732800,,201,4.685714285714286

8282250,4,B001B8MLS4,"First, let me say - it is GREAT that these three sleazy Katsu 70's classics have been reissued.
HOWEVER, if you're wondering if these discs are any different from the previously released box set, no they are not. The DVDs aren't even enhanced for wide screen. In 2016, people!!. I wasn't expecting a blu ray remaster, but HVE could at least have made the 2:35:1 picture go all the way from left to right.

Also, when you see the package, at first you'd think you had an old Tai Seng DVD in your hands! If you still by some chance have the old box set (I sold mine years ago [sigh]), hang on to it. I don't even think the menus have changed. A shame, really...",1482796800,2,659,4.23015873015873
8282251,4,B001B8MLS4,"This is a very hard film to describe. A truly bizzare flick, not for the squeamish or those who can't appreciate parody. If you're a fan of Katsu - enough of a fan to appreciate a parody that he deadpans brilliantly, then this brilliant send up of the relentlessly macho Samurai genre is for you. Caution, scenes of rape, abuse, and sexual torture abound.",1474934400,,355,4.5625

8282254,5,B001B8MLS4,"I've seen several reviews stating this film is ""extremely graphic"" and that the rape scenes are awful. If the ""rape"" scenes in this movie bother you then you have some serious problems. I cant speak for an English dub since i don't watch those, but the original Japanese audio with English subs shows the women as enjoying it and only giving them information when he says he will stop. The film features some pretty prominent actors for early Japanese film, such as K Nishimura, and the lead Shintar Katsu. The acting is great, and the story is excellent if you can look past the 70s cheese to really take it seriously. As mentioned above the ""rape"" scenes are nothing and don't even really visualize anything. Especially compared to other films of the time like Salo, or anything that Passolini did. So if graphic rape is something that turned you off of seeing this film, I would take it with a grain of salt and invest yourself in this debut of a superb trilogy.",1460678400,,965,4.583815028901734
8282255,5,B001B8MLS4,The wild open-mindedness of the flower-power age certainly extended to Japan.  This might get an X-rating now simply for the inane methods of interrogation this sheriff trusts to get at the truth.  Great for stag / hen parties.,1417910400,,227,4.947368421052632
