8300463,2,B001F12J2A,Poor quality - The tapes got deteriorated after a few months of use. The tape frequently halts during the middle of the exercise.,1274486400,,129,4.6521739130434785
8300464,5,B001F12J2A,Michelle is awesome! i have been a trainer for over 30 years. she is one of my favorites. lots of good solid training. you will walk away feeling like you had a great workout. we have bought most of the fitness dvds you see on amazon. she is in the top 5 for sure. can't go wrong if you get this or any of her other titles.,1272240000,,323,3.8358208955223883
8300465,5,B001F12J2A,"I hate going to the gym and didn't want to spend a lot of money on a DVD (for fear of not liking it) this DVD set was a good buy. The workouts are hard and challenging and the DVD set gives me a variety so I don't get bored. The chapters are nice also, so if I don't have a lot of time I can divide up my workout into chapters. The pace is very quick and took me some time to catch up, but I like that there isn't any lag between sets, keeps your heart rate up. I would recommend these tapes to anyone who doesn't want to hassle with going to the gym.",1253232000,,551,3.717948717948718
8300466,4,B001F12J2A,"After having tried another Michelle Dozois DVD, Fat to Firm Fast which I like a lot, I decided to purchase this set for more exercise options.  While ""Fat to Firm Fast"" has 3 levels to follow for each exercise (beginner, intermediate, advanced), the DVDs in this set seem to be more geared for intermediate to advanced exercisers.  Michelle is very engaging and motivating and the DVDs provide a good workout.  The moves can be confusing to follow sometimes but it just takes a few times of doing the workout to remember the moves.  If you are a beginner or low intermediate, the workouts might be a little too fast paced or difficult.  Otherwise it's a good set.",1241136000,3,663,4.632478632478633
8300467,5,B001F12J2A,"This is totally worth it! I'm used to going to the gym but my schedule won't allow it right now. It is so hard to find a DVD workout that can actually get you to work up a sweat, but these do. I'm really happy with it and I think someone less advanced would still like it because she has others working out with her that show variations. I got this set and Jari Love's Ripped series and feel like I hit the jackpot. Other good ones: Michelle's Pilates with weights (with Traci York),Gilad's Cuts and Curves, Cathe Freidrich's Step Blast, and Taebo Advanced. The 3-pack is great because it has weights and aerobic exercise.",1236816000,5,622,4.417391304347826
