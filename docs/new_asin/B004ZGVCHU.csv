8449770,1,B004ZGVCHU,"I am a big baseball fan and came across this multipart series called Talking Baseball.  I believe that it was originally a 30 minute syndicated TV show back in the 80's & 90's BEFORE ESPN & sports cable became real big.

Ed Randal does interview various MLB players/coaches but it is presented like it is just him, the person he is interviewing and a video camera on a tripod taping it.  It is very poorly done, no highlights, clip, stats or graphics.  Just him talking to the person who is usually pitching some product, that & about a half dozen breaks for commercials puts you to sleep.",1371081600,,589,4.4766355140186915
8449771,5,B004ZGVCHU,"This is just one of a series of 13 Talking Baseball DVDs featuring Ed Randall interviewing the greatest baseball legends of all time. Watching such sports icons as Ernie Banks, Ron Santa, Harry Caray and Andre Dawson recall their best memories of America's favorite pastime gives ample reason why baseball continues to have such as prominent place in sport fans hearts.
Randall does an admirable job as interviewer, allowing his subject to shine and giving them enough time to tell their tales, remembrances and stories.
This series hits a home run as a gift choice for baseball fans this holiday season.",1320019200,,604,4.99009900990099
