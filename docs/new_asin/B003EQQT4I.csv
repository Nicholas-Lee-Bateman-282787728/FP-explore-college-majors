The subs are decent, although you have to remember to turn them on before you start the episode because you can't switch them on while it's playing. Totally worthwhile if you liked this show. I can watch this any time I need to cheer up. Sumiyoshi and Tamura's bickering makes me laugh every time. ;D

It's cheese, but it's good cheese. I love this dorama to bits. Thanks to those who make it available outside of Japan.",1408233600,,528,4.557894736842106
