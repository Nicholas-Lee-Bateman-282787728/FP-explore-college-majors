531337,3,6302990149,"On the surface, this is a fun (albeit minor) murder mystery made special by the performances of an all-star cast.  When a local resident is poisoned at a reception for a film crew on location in a small English village, Agatha Christie's resourceful Miss Marple character begins to piece together the story of whodunit. In her only film appearance (to date) as Marple, Angela Lansbury is marvelously warm, wise, and witty.  Her earnest performance is complimented beautifully by those of Elizabeth Taylor and Kim Novak, who seem to relish their roles as feuding movie queens with tongues of acid.  Geraldine Chaplin also scores as a long-suffering agent who is secretly in love with Taylor's husband (Rock Hudson).  As the men in the mystery, Hudson, Tony Curtis as a film producer, and (especially) Edward Fox as Lansbury's nephew all do fine work, but the spotlight remains fittingly focused on the distaff characters throughout.
The movie would be a harmlessly fun little romp if it weren't for one underlying conceit which taints the screenplay (as well as the novel on which it is based).  Unfortunately --- and unforgivably --- the essential plot is nothing more than a cynical and tasteless exploitation of an actual tragedy that had a devastating and life-long effect on the lives of Hollywood beauty Gene Tierney (""Laura"") and her first husband, Oleg Cassini.  What was Dame Christie thinking when she so callously and obviously mined Tierney's heartbreak as fodder for a piece of fiction during the actress' lifetime?  If you're unfamiliar with the details, you may choose to go ahead and enjoy the movie ... and then look for a copy of Gene Tierney's best-selling autobiography, ""Self-Portrait"" (1979) to learn the real story.  Remember ... movie first!  Otherwise, you may find the on-screen version vaguely objectionable and even downright vulgar.",1005264000,4,1860,5.132450331125828
531338,3,6302990149,"An American movie production invades a small English town, and if that weren't enough to cause a disruption, murder comes with it.  Once again, Miss Marple comes to the rescue, with her incredible knack for detail and deduction, as well as her understanding of human nature.  Miss Marple is played by Angela Lansbury, who doesn't quite capture the famous character, but is entertaining in the role nonetheless.  Rock Hudson is the director, Tony Curtis the producer, while Elizabeth Taylor and Kim Novak are the stars of the American production.  Their performances are alright, with Novak seeming to have a lot of fun, but nothing special.  Actually, that's part of the problem with the film - it's competently done, but nothing more.  There's some good dialogue between Taylor and Novak, but on the whole, the film lacks energy.  It could have been a lot better, although it is certainly watchable.",996969600,4,900,5.0

Among special not-to-be-forgotten segments are a terrific cat fight between Kim Novak and Elizabeth Taylor, and a wonderful scene where Elizabeth display a wide range of emotions (from shaken fear to raucus laughter). This film looms very late in the careers of both Novak and Rock Hudson. Taylor never has turned in a bad performance. A movie to watch, then watch again.",988761600,2,452,4.8076923076923075
531341,3,6302990149,"I think Angela Lansbury is one of the world's great actresses, versatile with comedy, drama, and musicals, but though giving it her best effort, she's just not quite right for the frail, bright eyed Miss Marple in this adaptation of one of Miss Marple's lesser mysteries.
I say lesser because I was easily able to guess the killer despite a wide assortment of suspects, and when one is able to do this easily with Christie, something just isn't right.
The quality of the new DVD release of this 1980 film isn't in the same league with EVIL UNDER THE SUN and DEATH ON THE NILE either. The image is not as sharp as it should be nor are colors as vibrant as I was expecting. The mono sound is fine, the melancholy score adding immeasurably to the somber nature of the story as we delve deeper into untying the knots of the mystery. The supplements are skimpy to be sure.
Yes, there are changes from Christie's book, and the actors cast are a Who's Who of 1950's Hollywood, appropriate for the time period of the film (1953), but each one is overaged for his part by at least fifteen years. The star power is so great, however, that few will probably quibble. It's great to see some of these people in a big budget film one more time.
If you get this DVD, get it for the celebrated cast but be forewarned that the mystery is subordinate to the star wattage on display.",984182400,8,1364,4.395256916996048

What we have here is one of Dame Elizabeth Taylor's (and Rock Hudson's also) last big-screen starrings. And they are both perfect for the roles. So too Kim Novak as the ... competition for Elizabeth. Sure, the lines they say are not as Agatha Christie wrote them but they sure are entertaining! The mystery is intriguing, and somewhat mirrors Gene Tierney's life. Enough said about that - don't want to give too much away! The direction is very effective - just look at the scene at the party and compare it with the flat direction in the Joan Hickson remake. Stunning. Also compare the ending - much more poignant and emotional in this version. And Angela Lansbury? I think she does a very good turn as Miss Marple - I'm even inclined to forgive her the scene in which she portrays Miss Marple smoking! In all, a very good film, and the story underneath is one that will keep you watching it again and again, well after the mystery has been solved.",982108800,,1037,4.463157894736842

Hot Toasty Rag, July 19, 2017

A Miss Marple mystery with an all-star castwhat could go wrong? A lot, actually, and Im not just talking about the murder.

The story isn't the best whodunit out there, but its the acting thats the real problem. I don't know what kind of direction Guy Hamilton gave his cast, but everyone overacted like they were in a bad dinner theater performance. Its just sad to see Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson, Tony Curtis, Kim Novak, Geraldine Chaplin, and Angela Lansbury giving horrible performances. If this was the first movie someone saw of them, theyd probably hate them. Lizs and Kims performances are particularly over-the-top; they play fading movie stars who hate each other, and its just heartbreaking to watch.

The only bonus is if you look at the full cast list on Imdb, youll see Pierce Brosnan listed as Actor playing Jamie (uncredited). But don't watch the entire movie hoping to spot him. Im sure hed give you the same advice.",1500422400,,996,4.77906976744186

531406,4,6302990149,"I purchased The Mirror Cracked  as a set with two Peter Ustinov movie versions of  Hercule Poirot stories.  While  Mr Ustinov  was a great actor and writer, he certainly  did not fit the description of Poriot ,  that  the great Agatha  Chistie  envisioned. That said, he did  do a credible job as the detective in those  movies and in several TV  adaptions.  Now  I am writing about  The Mirror Cracked. In the role of  Miss Marple , we  find Angle Lansbury.  who tried very hard  to be Miss Marple, as the great Agatha  wrote her. Again,  her portrayal was  certainly not bad, however she was  far to young  for the part.
The most important  thing to me by far, was the lack of captioning on these films.  My hearing has  gone  completely south on me, and any  dvd I have, where captioning is missing  is now a  complete loss to me.
Now,  DID ANYONE NOTICE, that at the start  of The Mirror Cracked, t was noted on screen  that the year was 1952 or 53, and th the fete  given  where Elizabeth Taylor (as the actress Niss Gregg) The  bombastic  producer played by Tony Curtis, drive up, with the rival actress  played by Kim Novak, in a 1969 Caddy Convertible, the model with those unmistakable  huge tail fins.  This  made me wonder  during the entire  film, just what time portal, the producers  of the film  managed to pull that car  from.  When obvious  production  like  that appear,  they always  spoil  the filn  for me.  The  film was  not overall bad, but only if you are not all familiar with Agatha  Christies  work.  Miss  Marple  was never portrayed properly on film,  you must go to the English TV's Miss Marple  and  the same  holds true  for Poriot, David Suchet was the best, except for Albert Finney  in Murder in Murder on the Orient Express film,  however, there were  some many  cameo bits among the  suspects, it pulls from Finney's excellent  Poriot

I must  say that all  DVDs  should have  Captions,  There  are very many people with hearing problems,  and without this assistance,  we are lost.",1485648000,,2020,4.471751412429379

That being said, there were things that could have made it better. Casting Liz Taylor in the role (loosely based on the Gene Tierney story) was a mistake. She just didn't seem believable as the supposedly fragile, fading film star, trying to make a comeback. Liz seemed too powerful, in control (up to the end) and angry...the weeping and come hither looks directed at Rock Hudson, fell well short of the mark. I did enjoy her sniping with Kim Novak, but again, it didn't fit with the role she was supposedly playing overall.

I love Angela Lansbury but in this film, she was not at her best. Seemed to be just reading her lines and portraying the role of Miss Marple in an almost ""campy"" way. That detracted from her performance throughout this movie.

531676,3,6302990149,"Set in 1953, the third in the Brabourne/ Goodwin series of Christie adaptations is set in a chocolate-box English village full of stereotypical characters - the vicar (Charles Lloyd Pack), the mayor (Thick Wilson), the bourgeois lady (Margaret Courtenay), the gossipy homemaker (Maureen Bennett), the Major (Eric Dodson) and Miss Marple (Angela Lansbury).  Into this edenic world comes a troupe of American filmmakers producing a historical drama centered around Queen Elizabeth: led by a pair of warring actresses (Elizabeth Taylor, Kim Novak), an egotistical director (Rock Hudson) and a megalomaniac producer (Tony Curtis), they find the English way of life quaint yet ultimately irritating.  Guy Hamilton's film gains much of its comic impetus from the clash of cultures, especially when Taylor's Marina Rudd deigns to walk through the village fete, attracting more than her fair share of admirers among the villagers.  In the end the pseudo-sophistication of the Americans is outwitted by Miss Marple's ingenuity as she solves the case of an apparently motiveless murder.  Compared to the other three adaptations, the plot of THE MIRROR CRACK'D is relatively straightforward; the ending is a little peremptory, suggesting that it might have been tacked on to the film at a later date.  Lansbury's Miss Marple directly foreshadows her performance as Jessica Fletcher in the long-running television series MURDER SHE WROTE, her apparently genteel exterior concealing a mind like a steel trap.  Edward Fox turns in a nuanced performance as the dogged Inspector Craddock, doggedly pursuing his investigations in spite of the Americans' best attempts to divert him, either through rudeness (as in Hudson's case) or through performance (as in Taylor's case).  Eventually, however, even his efforts prove futile as compared to Miss Marple.",1408838400,,1837,5.49290780141844

Younger, my eye.  She looked exactly the same--plump, middle-aged--only in the backflash her hair was long and flowing, rather than her current shorter cut.

Kim Novak was wonderful.  I'm not used to seeing her being bitchy, and it was a delightful change of pace for her.

BTW, Aggie C. lifted the plot's foundation from the true life story of Gene Tierney.  But don't look that up before seeing the movie, as it would probably give the plot away.",1407974400,,616,4.754716981132075

What I feel compelled to say is that I am thoroughly disappointed that someone axed several minutes from this version.  Had I known that, I would never have purchased it.  I remember in the VHS version, there was a breakfast scene at Gossington Hall in which Marina Gregg is gushing on about how she was born in England, is so glad that she has returned, and loves it ""here"" so much that she wants to die here.  Also, there is further conversation about the plans for a village fete on the grounds.  This scene was axed.  There was also a sequence in which the photographer on the stairs is investigated and eventually disqualified as a suspect.  That sequence was also axed.  What really galls is that the producers had the nerve to place Margot Bence's (photographer) name in the credits after cutting her scenes.  I don't know what else was cut, but I would not be surprised if more was cut.  105 minutes is pretty minimal.  What is most irritating is that Amazon does not see to it that the movies are described in more detail, especially the length of each movie.

She even smokes a cigarette with her tea in one scene with the Scotland Yard detective in her kitchen - - - wth ??!!  Miss Marple ????!!!  Not possible.

The other thing is the constant vulgarity, underlined over and over, from the ""Hollywood people"". They hardly seem human at all, though Rock Hudson and Liz Taylor do bring some star power to their shallow parts.

531804,4,6302990149,"""The Mirror Cracked"" is one of Agatha Christie's lesser known stories for a very good reason; there is hardly any appearances by Miss Marple!  She gets all of her information from her housekeeper and ""favorite nephew"" while convalescing in her drawing room from a sprained ankle.
I've always scratched my head at this one; the clues were almost highlighted. If you had read any other Miss Marple stories, or watched the wonderful Masterpiece Theatre BBC/PBS series, you were able to solve this mystery on your own.
The wonderful thing about Agatha Christie's Miss Marple is that there are so many movies, and the stories have been shown in many different series over the years, that you can choose your favorite Miss Jane Marple - or have fun conversations about the character traits that you prefer from each actress.  Some people claim Joan Hickson came closest to the written page; while some like the quirky, impish traits that Geraldine McEwan gave her. Then there was Julia McKenzie who also tried to portray the intelligent women with a realistic view of human nature - some even call it a ""jaded"" view.
I guess what I'm trying to say is that while we all know that Angela Lansbury can act, she pretty much ""mailed"" her performance in for this movie.  It could have been the director, using up as much time as he could with the tremendous ""names"" he had as the other actors.  (Having Elizabeth Taylor in the movie didn't help!)

531886,2,6302990149,"This frivolous and seemingly lighthearted film can boast of several assets. First and foremost are the appearances of an array of significant Hollywood personalities: from Elizabeth Taylor and Kim Novak to Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis. Although they shamelessly mug and overact so histrionically in order to enliven a pallid script and practically moribund direction, their respective returns to the screen are very welcome.

And the initial plot of having an intrusive and stereotypical Hollywood production to film in a staid and cozy rural English village promises much potential with misunderstandings among people of divergent manners.

Angela Lansbury, portraying Agatha Christie's Miss Marple, and Edward Fox inbue their respective characters, the avatars of English propriety, with nuance, subtlety, and much drollery. They are the highlights of this stellar cast. But it is the history of Elizabeth Taylor's character - an actress past her prime who is attempting a comeback with this production - that is highly objectionable. Many years ago her character, while entertaining the troops on tour, met a rabid fan, and this deceptively innocuous meeting subsequently wreaks terrible havoc on this character's personal life.

It is hoped that the plot of Christie's novel is a truly original work. That her plot is practically identical to the true circumstances that actually befell a famed Hollywood star, Gene Tierney, may be a mere coincidence. But the knowledge that the film's plot has an historical parallel renders this work too unsavory and unsettling. It is suspected that those involved in the production of this 1980s film were unaware of Tierney's tragedy, but if so, then this movie can only be regarded as inexcuseably exploitative.",1383264000,,1753,5.413919413919414

I love Angela Lansbury and her iconic characterization of the Cabot Cove writer-turned sleuth, Jessica Fletcher, but she is no Miss Marple. Everything about her interpretation of Christie's crime-solving spinster seemed off. Sadly, I found most of the acting in this interpretation of The Mirror Crack'd to be poor. Elizabeth Taylor's portrayal was forced. I watched this because I so enjoy Peter Ustinov's Poirot movies, which are most akin to this style of movie-making: big-named stars, extravagant sets, exotic locations. Ustinov's Poirot is certainly not up to par with David Suchet's interpretation of the character, but I still can enjoy those movies for what they are: fun movies that don't take themselves too seriously which, I have to say, I found this Miss Marple rendition tried to do unsuccessfully.

531940,4,6302990149,"Gossington Hall is the manor house of the English village St. Mary Mead. It's the home of the Bantrys, but it's too big for Mrs. Bantry, now that her husband, the Colonel, has passed. So she moves into the Lodge, and has rented Gossington Hall to Jason and Marina (Gregg) Rudd. It's 1953, and the Rudds are in town for the filming of ""Mary Queen of Scots"". Marina Gregg is a great American movie star, but hasn't been seen on the screen for ten years due to a nervous breakdown accelerated by alcohol. After years of trying for a baby with her previous husband, she finally had a child who was born severely disabled, and had to be left in long-term care at a medical facility. Marina was undone.

But now, with her new husband, Marina is sober and looking for ""Mary Queen of Scots"" to be her big come-back vehicle. Jason is not just her husband, he's the film's director. And they throw themselves into village life by agreeing to follow tradition and hold the annual Village Fete on Gossington Hall grounds. In the middle of the still-fragile Marina's successful queening over the fete, Marty N. Fenn and Lola Brewster show up. Marty is the film's brash and bold American producer, and Lola is his aging-and-not-agreeing-to-it wife. As if that's not enough, one of the village ladies is murdered in the upstairs landing of Gossington Hall in front of thirty people - a victim of poison in her drink.

Miss Marple can't help but investigate. Especially as her nephew, Inspector Craddock, is in charge of the homicide investigation. He has a healthy respect for his aunt's gossipy prowess, though as she admonishes the Doctor, ""Gossip?! I prefer to call it a healthy interest in human nature.""

I can't help but compare this version of ""The Mirror Crack'd"" to my favorite version with Joan Hickson. Angela Lansbury has a uniquely aging-free face. When she was 20, she looked 35; when she was 60 she looked 45. Her acting as Miss Marple is good except for when she tries to act old. She can't do it. The woman's voice and demeanor just don't cut it. I didn't mind her as Miss Marple, but she doesn't come off as true as Joan Hickson:

Elizabeth Taylor still has lovely skin in this 1980 production. She isn't as melodramatic as her counterpart in Hickson's version. Rock Hudson does a great job - I'd say he breaks even. Ditto for Tony Curtis. Kim Novak is better than the Lola in Hickson's version, except for when she is trying to fake a brassy accent. Her smoky, deep, vibrant voice has a difficult time dumbing down. Her scenes with Taylor, though, as two aging beauties clawing at each other, are some of the best in the movie.

I not a huge fan of Elizabeth Taylor's acting, but in ""The Mirror Crack'd"" she has a superlative scene with Inspector Craddock. He is interviewing Marina with the consideration that the poison had been meant for her. Marina starts getting hysterical, ""Somebody's trying to kill me, aren't they? Somebody's trying to poison me, aren't they? Somebody's trying to kill me. Aren't they? [her voice rises] Aren't they? I know it. I can...""
And the Inspector joins in with her, word for word, ""... 'I can feel it! I can almost hear them coming.' 'Danger in the Dark', MGM 1932!""

The look and laughter on Marina's face when she realizes the Inspector is on to her, and accepting it gleefully rather than taking umbrage, are great. She ends their conversation quietly, ""You see, the dull thing about having it, there's always somebody who wants to take it away. You know, they usually do.""

The primary advantage the Hickson version has over this Lansbury version is the script. The former's is more interesting, more well-rounded and suspenseful. With the exception of the scene with the Inspector.

I'm not a fan of Elizabeth Taylor (don't think she could act that well) and this movie pretty much verifies it.  Actually all of the actors just seem to be reciting lines--none take on their character which, if I'm not mistaken, is what acting's all about.  Everybody seems determined to ""out-ham"" the other.  Kim Novak was just annoying and Rock Hudson was his normal wooden self.  Edward Fox (one of my favorite actors) was wasted but tried to do his best with a flimsy role.

As Miss Marple, I think Angela Lansbury does a fine job, a fine character performance. Rock Hudson (his last hurrah before his tragic end, I suppose) Does his best Rock Hudson while sharing most of his scenes with Elizabeth Taylor. Speaking of Taylor, as the troubled and fading movie star, she has a few good scenes, but much of what she is called on to do is whine. Rival actress Kim Novak arrives and begins chewing on the scenery, the other actors and generally acts as if she were trying to compete for the same awards Faye Dunaway received in ""Mommy Dearest."" The other big star is Tony Curtis who is very entertaining as a crass movie producer.
As adaptations of Agatha Christie, THE MIRROR CRACKED earns a 6 out of 10, I would say.

532064,2,6302990149,"Let me just start off by saying; my biggest complaint about the movie centers around the lead..actress playing Miss Marple in THIS one: Angela Lansbury. Prior to this, even, she was-to me-a very irritating kind of actress. In this she hit an all-time low.
If there was one character path that I would truly assume the Dame Agatha put Marple on was the road of Ladyship. In this Miss Marple came off as anything BUT a Lady. For most of the movie, she looked..chemicalized (if you know what I mean)...giggling, smirking, wise cracking...certainly NOT comforting the way Helen Hayes for instance portrayed her. MORE like the drunkard she played well in Death On The Nile. The ALL TIME Low point in the movie came (for me) about..3/4 thru movie where she is seated at a table talking to her inspector nephew and SMOKING!!! Miss Marple sitting like a real low class old gutterbum ..like a servant maybe in a great manor..sneaking a smoke on her break...She came off WAY too common and unlikeable after this.
I refrained from going into any plot nor posting a spoiler alert; the rest of the film was adequate enough, with a group of some rock-solid actors all of which did their roles justice..especially La Liz.
And, like many Christie murder victims, which are in many ways ""deserving"" to be murdered, so it goes in this although we don't fully realize the murder victim's character at the time of the act; only posthumously. So..you carry a very mixed feeling throughout the movie as there become NO real heroes or people that you are ""FOR""..THAT is bad film making",1337040000,,1562,4.725274725274725
532065,3,6302990149,"I always want to see any production of Agatha Christie, and usually enjoy it overall. Her stories are that good. To me, the classic interpretation so far is the BBC television series with Joan Hickson as Ms. Marple and David Suchet as Poirot. They were so authentic and true to the books, while being very well done. The 80's and 90's seemed to yield the best of the crop. But, I even enjoy Margaret Rutherford's series, though they are so loosely adapted. This decade's offerings give the heartburn, even the newer ones with Suchet. They have taken the stories much farther afield than I can swallow, stellar production and casting notwithstanding.

But here's Rock and Liz together again - in Agatha Christie. This is one of the more glamorous of the Marple stories, and there is plenty of glamour here. My goodness, the superbly correct butler was the wonderful Charles Gray. All these people together - Kim Novak, in an over-the-top Lola Brewster. Everyone loves the vitriolic exchanges between the two actresses in the story, which is why they indulged in so much license with that aspect. Edward Fox is interesting in his reaction to Marina (Lizzie) in the interview, calling her on pulling out a scene from one of her movies when his questioning got too close. Then, she immediately switches back to near serendipity. Tony Curtis as the producer follows the more outrageous type. This really was quite a mix of British and American actors. It was interesting seeing a number of the local characters showing up later in the BBC series in different roles.

Miss Marple (Angela Lansbury here) seems to be the hardest to define. She is varied from the first book treatment, and some in the BBC series as well. It seems hard to land on a persona for her. She is an atypical old lady, with her perky persistence when she's really onto something. Unfortunately, most have taken that aspect and run with it, ignoring her foundational substance. The newer ones especially seem to make her out to be a liberated know-it-all. With that, she has become a very vapid, shallow character. In this version, there's a cigarette smoking (or attempt), which comes across quite strangely - a bit of a caricature really.  They have her starting out as the know-it-all at the local movie night, but she becomes more biddable as it goes along.  She demonstrates the life experience correlations, which are so pivotal in her sound assessments.  Aside:  Note the stark contrast in the size of the rather diminutive figure of Edward Fox next to the full sized Lansbury and Hudson.  With Lansbury, in particular -- she literally looms over him, adding another incongruous dimension to the depiction here.

Geraldine Chaplin is the secretary, holding herself very tightly, with all sorts of complications going on beneath her surface. The Heather Babcock character was effective, that being an important one. They really had the vicar fuddled up in this.

And the location and sets - quite wonderful, as are other versions. There's a lot of the old world charm still intact in the British isles. They cleverly carried out the story with overall accuracy, adding and subtracting with an eye to please modern viewers and the run time of the film. I can note the variances, but enjoy the overall film. You usually find that British productions of Christie and anything really, have a way of stereotyping Americans rather unflatteringly. It's funny that in this American production, they made it even worse. But, it's about film personalities, and I guess they are fair game.

If this film has piqued your interest, you might find the book enjoyable. You'll not be disappointed, I think, with its wider scope and development. Also, if you have opportunity and are enough of a fan of Christie, you probably have seen the BBC Marple series. If not, I think you would enjoy it. This film definitely has the usual Hollywood treatment, but it's light entertainment for its spectacle value, if nothing else.",1336089600,2,3976,4.885756676557864

The movie SUCKS.
The sly-spy, the master-mind nutcracker, the protagonist who is supossed to sort-it-all is Jane Marple, an Agatha Christie character (a la Sherlock Holmes) played by Angela Lansbury. And which is where the problem lies, largely.
Angela Lansbury has ""theatre"" tattooed all over her shrivelled body and face. I wonder why must a sleuth be a 70 plus woman, who looks and acts more like a 4 inch tall avatar from the ""Granny's Paradise"" series of PC Games than a quick thinking detective. She completely forgets that she is facing a MOVIE camera, where subtleness is captured and theatrics are magnified. I think she never expected to land herself such a role and in her excitement to prove that she deserved the part, which she most probably got after 400 years of ""struggle"" (as Mumbai-walas call it), she over-did it all. Her smug and glib portrayal irritates and makes one wish her to be the next murder victim. And who the heck was her make-up man? Why has he smudged her face with that ghostly white powder in all her scenes?
In fact, many other actors who play smaller parts in the movie, must too be from the theatre.
All the actors in the main roles are 70+ years old. I wonder if the movie was fiananced by the British NHS, to be exclusively viewed by the old-age-home occupants? I do not care what idiosyncracy made someone produce this movie, the verdict remains a strong, vociferous - ""The movie SUCKS"".",1322524800,2,1919,4.7657657657657655

The script was very slow but filmed beautifully in England. Angela Langsbury received her prequalification as a detective for years later as a murder investigator as Miss Marple. Script was based loosely off of actress Gene Tierney's life but can't give that away without spoiling the movie. Do your research after viewing the movie. Rock Hudson gives a poignant portrayal as the protective husband but Kim Novak shows most of the magic as the beautiful rival, bitch actress, of Elizabeth Taylor's. Novak looks trim, young and beautiful compared to Liz's overweight figure at the time. Also, Novak had some remarkable caddy remarks to Liz.

Angela Lansbury as Miss Marple does her Jessica Fletcher bit but overacts to beat the band, complete with a cane and her knitting. Rock Hudson and Taylor, playing a Director and Star as well as husband-and-wife could not have less chemistry.  Miss Taylor often appears glassy-eyed and lethargic, perhaps she was drunk. Tony Curtis  could have had a great time as the sleazy Producer but his role seems to have been cut. Novak starts out strong but  disappears midway through the film.

Kim Novack stole this film for me.

I love Elizabeth Taylor, but she's a little hammy in this film (and that's not a weight reference)

532131,4,6302990149,"A group of Hollywood actors and filmmakers (including Tony Curtis, Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson and Kim Novak) come to Miss Marple's small country village to shoot a movie, and needless to say, given the fact that this is based on an Agatha Christie novel, someone turns up dead. Miss Marple's nephew (Edward Fox), a Scotland Yard detective is called in to investigate, but as you would expect, he is assisted along the way by Miss Marple (Angela Lansbury).

I've seen many films and telemovies based on the novels of Agatha Christie, over the course of my life, but ""The Mirror Crack'd"" stands out as being one of the best. It is true that, plotwise, if you've seen one such mystery, you've seen them all, but this film stands out because (i) it is clearly made with a higher budget than most of these mysteries (which are usually made for television), and so has higher production values, (ii) there are actually enough clues given to the audience for them to solve the murder and (iii) the script is really funny. Elizabeth Taylor and Kim Novak, as two rival actresses, spend most of their screen time insulting each other and some of the insults that they sling are absolutely hilarious. These liven up the script no end and make this film a thorough pleasure to watch.

Angela Lansbury is not my favourite Miss Marple (that is still Margaret Rutherford), but she does a far better job of playing Miss Marple than many of the actresses who have come after her. My main criticism of Lansbury in this role is that she is too young for the part. When this film was made, Lansbury was only 59, so is buried under very heavy make-up in order to disguise this fact. Nevertheless, for fans of ""Murder She Wrote"" (which started four years after this film was made), Lansbury is already in ""Jessica Fletcher"" mode and this film can essentially be viewed as being another episode of this series, albeit a longer and better made one.",1224547200,3,1927,4.648093841642229

A young celebrity fan gets caught up as the victim, by the murderer who discovers a hidden secret from them, that destroyed their life. However, the victim is meant to appear as a mistaken murder, with the murderer posing as the actual intended victim. Not a bad plot in reality, but lost in muddled star cameos.

The sets look like somebody decided to save money by putting in the minimum effort to make them look like they came from 1953. You could barely tell the difference between the interiors from this film and what you would expect to see on Magnum P.I.

St. Marysmead is being invaded by Hollywood.  They are making a movie of Mary Stuart but the costars are bitter rivals.  It all comes to a head when there is a murder attempt on the film's star Marina (Elizabeth Taylor) at a welcome party, just when her rival Lola (Kim Novak) enters.  Instead of Marina, a village woman is killed.

Marina's husband Jason (Rock Hudson) is trying to keep the peace but a second murder attempt happens and Marina is completely unraveled.  Of course there is always another murder - Agatha is never satisfied with just one!  And like her counterpart, Hercule Poirot, Miss Marple (Angela Lansbury), collects the suspects and solves the mystery.

This film is pure camp and does not measure up with the two mention Poirot films but it's nice to see all the fading stars.  This would be Rock Hudson's last film and it is fitting that his costar is his best friend, Liz Taylor.  Also nice is to see Tony Curtis and Kim Novak in films again.

The acting is good (but surprisingly nothing great!!!), the humor is very good, and there's the Agatha Christie element, which really saves the day.

This is a Miss Marple mystery trying to uncover who is behind the assassination attempt (by poison) of a Hollywood actress and subsequent murder of an innocent in a mansion in England.

So it's an interesting plot, a great setting and a wonderful cast, and yet it fails to take off, even though the potential for a great movie was definitely there.

One thing, which is noteworthy and has also been pointed out by other reviewers, is Pierce Brosnan's silent appearance for a few seconds (serving as an extra!!!) beside Elizabeth Taylor.

In a nutshell, it's a good movie, but it lacks that extra something to put it over the top as in the case of Evil Under the Sun, Murder on the Nile, and Murder on the Orient Express.  Nevertheless, The Mirror Crack'd will surely provide for an evening's entertainment.",1105228800,,1161,4.78

This movie is based on the 1962 novel entitled ""The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side"" by Dame Agatha Christie who wrote twelve Miss Marple murder mystery novels altogether.  (The title of this particular novel comes from a line in a poem called ""The Lady of Shalott"" by Alfred, Lord Tennyson.)

As a brief synopsis, an American movie company has come to a small English village where Miss Marple (Angela Lansbury) lives to shoot a movie.  A famous movie actress has come out of long retirement (brought about by the death of her child) to be the lead in this movie.  She has to act in this movie with another popular actress whom she despises.  A murder soon occurs (call this the first murder).  Miss Marple attempts to solve the crime with the aid of her ""favorite nephew"" Inspector Delbert Craddock (Edward Fox) and her maid Cherry Baker (Wendy Morgan).  Eventually another murder occurs (call this the second murder).  By the end of the movie a death occurs.

Who are the people associated with this movie?  They are as follows:

(1) Ella Zielinsky, the production assistant (Geraldine Chaplin)
(2) Martin Finn, the movie's producer (Tony Curtis)
(3) Jason Rudd, the movie's director (Rock Hudson)
(4) Lola Brewster Finn, popular actress (Kim Novak)
(5) Marina Gregg Rudd, the famous actress who's come out of retirement (Elizabeth Taylor)
(6) Heather Babcock, devoted fan of Marina (Maureen Bennett, her movie debut)

I solved who was responsible for the first murder (actually it was a lucky guess) but had to wait for Miss Marple to tell me the motive for it.  Miss Marple tells us the motive saying that she deduced this on something that was said by the murder victim earlier in the movie.  I went back to this point in the movie and discovered that nothing that Miss Marple claimed was said was really said!!  Instead, it seems to me that the murder occurred (as depicted in this movie) because the murderer assumed something.  I had to ask myself, ""Is assumption really a good motive for murder?""

As well, Miss Marple mentions nothing about the second murder in her deduction.  The viewer can assume who did this murder but Miss Marple never tells us why it occurred.  I thought this was a major oversight.

Finally, by the end of the movie, a death occurs.  I was not sure whether this was a ""compassionate"" murder or suicide.  The viewer is never told.  Again, it's possible to assume what happened and to assume why this death occurred.

If you're like me and find murder mysteries based on assumption frustrating and perhaps unrealistic, then a good reason to see this movie is because of its legendary movie stars in it namely Angela Lansbury, Geraldine Chaplin, Tony Curtis, Rock Hudson, Kim Novak, and Elizabeth Taylor.  (They were all movie stars of the 1950s and 1960s.)  Both Hudson and Taylor do good jobs in their roles.  Curtis does a good job as the sassy and unlikable producer.  Hudson made four movies after this one before his death from AIDS in 1985.  Geraldine Chaplin is the daughter of Charlie Chaplin.  Lansbury, Curtis, and Hudson are the same age in this movie, in their mid-fifties.  Novak and Taylor were also about the same age, in their late forties.  Novak made three movies after this one.  (Also look for a young Pierce Brosnan in a thirty-second, non-talking role.  This may have been his first movie appearance.)

I think Angela Lansbury does a good job portraying Miss Marple.  (She even pulls off a somewhat shocking scene of Miss Marple smoking!)  Unfortunately, we don't get to see her much.  This movie may have been an audition for Lansbury's leading role in the long running television program ""Murder She Wrote.""  (Also look for Angela Lansbury's fantastic job in the excellent murder mystery ""Death on the Nile,"" 1978.)

Finally, the cinematography and music of this movie are well done.  As well, all costumes are authentic looking.

In conclusion, Agatha Christie fans may be frustrated by this movie's murder mystery based on assumptions.  However, if you do not care about the murder mystery, it's possible to watch this movie for the legendary movie stars.

532170,3,6302990149,"It's not big, it's not terribly clever, and it won't change the way anyone thinks about anything at all, but this 1980 version of one of Agatha Christie's less-loved novels of the same name is still an enjoyable tale of murder and gentle rebuke.
Set in a highly stereotypical American vision of the 1950's English countryside, the whole town is abuzz when Lola Brewster (Kim Novak) and Marina Rudd (Elizabeth Taylor) take up residence to film a production of 'Mary, Queen of Scots'. When one of Ms. Rudd's long-time fans is murdered at a reception given for the Star, Miss Marple (Angela Lansbury) and her nephew Inspector Delbert Craddock (Edward Fox) investigate the crime.
Script and direction are nothing more than diverting, with a nod here and there to the likes of Joan Crawford and Bette Davis - the two movie Queens feud continually - and some extremely clever one-liners - Ms. Taylor's line about Doris Day takes on a whole new level of meaning, as her director husband Jason is played by Rock Hudson. As Christie's well-loved sleuth, Angela Lansbury as Miss Marple is amusingly self-depracatory in her role, claiming that not everyone who comes into contact with her winds up dead. She'll never be Joan Hickson, but in a film such as this, Lansbury's lighthearted and somewhat campy performance is perfectly pitched.
Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson do passable jobs in their respective roles as Producer and Director, and the supporting cast is nothing more than perfunctory (including a rare nonspeaking cameo from a VERY young Pierce Brosnan), but for all that, they hang together well enough as an ensemble.
The plot and subsequent climax are forgettable, but, as with the rest of the film, come with a gentle likeable atmosphere that saves them from being mundane.
If you can pick it up cheaply, then go for it, it's perfect Sunday afternoon viewing. In total, 'The Mirror Crack'd' is a sweet, campy film that unfortunately stays too close to 'Average' to be a definite recommendation.",1073347200,32,1996,4.925816023738872

532173,3,6302990149,"Like many screen adaptations of Christie novels, THE MIRROR CRACK'D features an all-star cast--and in this case the casting would seem inspired: Angela Lansbury as Miss Marple, Rock Hudson as a film producer, Elizabeth Taylor as his movie-star wife, Kim Novack as a rival screen queen, and Tony Curtis as Novak's lover and the producer of the film they are all making.  But director Guy Hamilton is more interested in having his cast offer star turns than in actually serving the story, and the result is a strangely uneven, extremely plodding film that only comes to life when Taylor and Novak square off in the series of hilariously written and performed cat-fights that run throughout the movie.
Part of the problem lies in the source material.  THE MIRROR CRACK'D is one of Christie's lesser novels, written in a very sparse style and lacking Christie's usual knock-out solution in its story of a fan who drops dead of poisoning at a film star's reception.  In order to flesh out the tale, the script piles extraneous scene upon extraneous scene--with the Taylor-Novak scenes a case in point: enjoyable as they are, they actually have little to do with the story and so tend to slow the film down. To make matters worse, the performances are extremely casual at best. Taylor and Novak are extremely enjoyable in their scenes together--but elsewhere they are merely adequate.  Hudson and Curtis are flat.  And Angela Lansbury, a normally brilliant actress, has one of her rare failures with the role of Jane Marple.
At most, this film is for viewers who want to be in on the last major cinematic gasps of Taylor, Novak, Hudson, and Curtis--and those who derrive a certain joy from evaluating the level of decay seen here in the aging cast.  And most will enjoy seeing Taylor and Novak flog each other with nasty one-liners delivered with considerable flair.

On hand also are Geraldine Chaplin and Edward Fox in supporting roles. Look fast and one might miss a very young Pierce Brosnan with head placed lovingly in Miss Taylor's cleavage.
