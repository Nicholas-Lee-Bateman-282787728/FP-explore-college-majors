8034826,3,B0002YLCX8,I liked the movie but it is probably the only Miike movie iv'e seen that I don't mind if I never see again. It was a good story and easy to follow compared to a lot of his other movie plots that really make you think. I could have done without the boy band scene too. Overall I try to watch every Miike movie I can (so far I have seen over 40)since I am a huge fan and have enjoyed many of his.,1331683200,,394,3.7023809523809526
8034827,1,B0002YLCX8,"This movie is NOT Miike.  Get ""Ichi the Killer"" or ""Dead or Alive"".  This is pop garbage.  I realize that Miike took the film because it was an opportunity to make a big budget movie, but come on...

Total poop.  Where are the warring yakuza clans and the avalanches of entrails?  WTF is going on here?  Skip this one unless you like bad movies.",1133222400,4,345,4.296875
8034828,5,B0002YLCX8,"This is quite possibly the most poignant and deeply stirring of Takashi's films probably because it deals with loss on so many different levels:  loss of a daughter, loss of a father, loss of friends and loss of first love, among others.  The basic premise of this movie is that a brilliant scientist has discovered the software Rosetta Stone: the ability to program a human personality.  The rub is that he has used his daughter as the prototype personality which becomes important when she is struck and killed, for he is able to recreate her on the cyberworld in the form of a computer girl named Ai (A. I. get it?).  This might have helped to alleviate his pain but another entity intervenes to do this by slaying him.  Now others want the child ghost in the machine:  Agents of A mega-corporation hell-bent on world domination.  On the run, Ai uses cyberspace to contact her friends in the sentient world and enlists their help to flee.  A wild and exciting chase ensues that will have you on the edge of your seat as the bad guys get ever closer to capturing their prey, until there is only one escape route left.  Will Ai take it?",1119225600,5,1137,4.507317073170731
8034829,3,B0002YLCX8,"A girl, growing away from her friends, doesn't have a second chance at wronging her rights in this life.  Luckily her father is an expert software designer who has created her virtual memory and form.  She is reborn in cyberspace on her boyfriends laptop.  Her brother is also a programing genius, dying literally, for the software.  The greedy, selfish bad guys try to steal this software, and the chase begins.  Quite different for Miiike with virtual reality as a theme.  Not a fast paced film, but unique in its ideas considering that kind of capability really exists.  A funny boy band scene is thrown in.  Check out City of Lost Souls and Ichi the Killer (Unrated) for more from this cool director.",1106179200,3,704,4.713114754098361
