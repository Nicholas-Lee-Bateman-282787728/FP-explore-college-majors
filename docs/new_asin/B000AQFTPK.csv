2390441,2,B000AQFTPK,"This exercise video is not fun--none of us like it.  The moves are not hip or fun, and they become monotonous and boring, like you're waiting for it to end.  It seems really old or outdated.  The instructor is friendly and happy, but her face is really sweaty during the video.  The sound quality is not the best.  There must be a better kids' exercise video out there--we need some fun, hip, new moves with a great beat and really good music and alot more energy!  This dvd is not worth it-invest in something else, like a huge exercise ball--we all love that!",1167177600,,561,4.398058252427185
2390442,5,B000AQFTPK,"I bought this for my little cousin who loves dancing and doing sporty things but can't go outside in the cold and wet winter days.  She loves this.  I bought it because Kari is one of THE best instructors out there and all the dvds for adult exercisers are so good, I knew this had to be a winner.

This was made to help encourage kids to be more active, increase their confidence and coordination.  While everyone in the dvd is having fun, it's still a real workout.  The moves are like those in the adult classes but she has given them names that kids will love like 'stir it up' and 'macaroni'.  It's about 35 minutes and if you want your kids to get more active, then this will definately encourage them to do so.  They will have heaps of fun and be entertained (and out of your hair for over a half hour).  I totally recommend this to all parents of little people so that they are active outside of school.",1144195200,6,911,4.22543352601156
8079056,5,B000AQFTPK,Love this DVD for elementary age kids grades 3-5.  It is easy to follow and Kari breaks the routine down into 8 easy to learn sets and then combines them all at the end into one non-stop routine at the end.  A cool down portion follows at the end.,1436486400,,247,4.020408163265306
8079057,5,B000AQFTPK,We've owned this dvd for years and my kids still love it!  I don't understand the negative review from another person.  This has great music and it is engaging.  It is worth every penny.,1411689600,,186,4.411764705882353
8079058,5,B000AQFTPK,I loved it. My after school kids like it. It is just right for them. It is not too fast nor too slow to be exciting,1393977600,,115,3.4615384615384617
8079059,5,B000AQFTPK,"This is a great workout video for kids.  I bought it for my 8 year old niece and she loved it, because it made her sweat and loose weight.",1386115200,,138,3.7586206896551726
8079060,5,B000AQFTPK,"I purchased this DVD for my grandson's ""Special Education"" classroom to enjoy!  The teachers said that it's a great way to start off their day!",1319414400,,143,4.72
8079061,5,B000AQFTPK,"I purchased this for my 9-yo daughter's birthday, and she loves it!  It took her two or three times of doing the video to really get all the moves down, but she was never frustrated by it.  I have done it with her a couple of times, and it is a great 30-minute workout.  Kari Anderson is a good instructor (I own her GO Step workout as well), and I think she relates well to the kids in this video.  She seems to really enjoy herself.  My daughter gives Shake two thumbs up!",1299456000,,474,4.053763440860215
8079062,4,B000AQFTPK,"I teach 4th grade in the inner city -- the land where most of our students have TVs for babysitters and are thus overweight and/or extremely out of shape. Couple that with budget cuts that have reduced PE to 35 minutes a week and it's an issue. Our school is participating in a fitness program through one of the state universities and we are trying to incorporate exercise into our school day. This video seemed like a good way to help do that.

Despite the lack of diversity in the video (all of the children are caucasian, whereas none of my students are), they LOVE following along with this video. Kari is kind of cheesy (and the backdrop is a bit tacky) but she's friendly and fun and I think it helps that she gets the kids in the video involved in talking too. My students have already quickly begun to chant some of the moves to help themselves as they ""work it"". Best of all the music is definitely upbeat and kid-friendly.

My students especially love the macaroni routine (modified version of the macarena). Its so much fun I even do the video with them and it gets a great sweat going.",1264118400,6,1098,4.403940886699507
8079063,5,B000AQFTPK,"The moves are a bit challenging for younger kids, (6-7 year olds), but they loved to try it. The more they practiced it though, the better they got.  It was even a bit challenging for the older kids I used this with (8-12 year olds) but challenging in a good way. They needed to practice coordination and staying on beat, which is what this video does well. The music was great and I liked the instructor.",1204070400,5,405,4.328947368421052
8079064,2,B000AQFTPK,"I think interesting best describes this children's workout video and I am not sure that I intend this to be much more than mildly complimentary.  Even I watch enough children's television to know that Kari Anderson is not exactly in touch with children.  My three year old even commented that the tape was ""cheesy"". Unfortunately, I think that the instructor just has a poor, if sincere, understanding of children and the effect is a lacking rapport.

Not a complete zero as the children have moved around a bit and it served the purpose we were after which was to encourage exercise.  All-in-all, I rate this tape as highly as the average gym membership--money spent on unused services.",1175385600,3,687,4.846153846153846
8079065,5,B000AQFTPK,"I am glad I bought this for our daughter.  I used to worry about her not getting enough exercise, but she loves this dvd.  A hidden bonus: IT BURNS OFF EXTRA ENERGY..",1169251200,4,166,4.15625
