8232184,5,B000YDOTYQ,"I had seen a few of the Rob Bell messages before I ordered the set.  His messages are relatable, uplifting and speak to us about God who lives vibrantly in today's world.  I also read ""Love Wins"" (positive talk about a God who LOVES) and will order the rest of his books.  He's refreshing and the perspective on topics such as grief, anger, resentment, shame, and my favorite - ""Dust"" a new view on the story of Jesus walking on the water. These would be awesome as an adult Sunday school series.  Recommend to all.",1438300800,,515,4.389473684210526
8232185,5,B000YDOTYQ,Everything was included and I received it quickly! It ended up being a fantastic christmas gift for my sister who wants to be a pastor!,1359676800,,135,4.44
8232186,5,B000YDOTYQ,"We have been watching these videos in our Women's Sunday School class.  I haven't seen them all yet, but some will stay with me for the rest of my life - Rain, Lump and Kickball - in particular.  Would highly recommend for a small group discussion; both the videos and follow-up questions really make you think!",1332547200,,311,4.535714285714286
8232187,5,B000YDOTYQ,"I loved these videos.  For the humble seeker, they are a lifeline back to God.  First saw #10, Lump, at church.  I cried -- as a prodigal, it was such a wonderful simple analogy of God's constant compassion and acceptance.",1322524800,,222,4.5
8232188,2,B000YDOTYQ,"I purchased three of these dvds at a second hand store--#1, 9, 10. I had hoped to use them with my youth group. #1 was ok, #10 was boring, #9 was almost offensive to me. It was about how poorly some Christians represent themselves and would they please stop. I just take issue with a person judging others for being too judgemental.

The actual videos are ok, but I personally would not spend money on them. They are not particualarly touching or effective. It is essentially a mini-sermon. I expected more of a dramatized lesson, like you can find on youtube, where it is a mini movie with a message. These are a man speaking with some dramatized scenes interspersed. I imagine the heart of the people involved is in the right place, and the idea and concept are relevant, but the actual video is not something I can see myself using with my youthgroup. The best thing about the videos is the packaging--they look good.",1321833600,2,920,4.542168674698795
8232189,5,B000YDOTYQ,"Rob Bell is an amazing communicator, he will captivate your attention.  He has a great perspective on life lessons, getting quickly to the heart of the matter. Watch and enjoy!. It would make a great gift! You should buy it as a whole set, so you don't miss anything!",1320969600,2,267,4.448979591836735
8232190,5,B000YDOTYQ,Nooma is truly inspiring. He gets young people and we get him. Very useful for any youth pastor to own.,1213747200,7,103,4.2
