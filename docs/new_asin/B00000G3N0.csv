It was really enjoyable.

1218057,5,B00000G3N0,I enjoyed this movie as a kid and was so excited to see it again. I forgot how good those Saturday matinee movies were until seeing this again. Thanks amazon prime for a great feature matinee. Just think I watched it on a Saturday.:),1376524800,2,233,4.318181818181818
1218058,3,B00000G3N0,"who caused so much trouble that he was trapped in a giant statue. But we will hold that plot line until the second half of the movie... cause though the first half mentions it... and occasionally the ground shakes to remind us that he is here... it is largely ignored in favor of the story of dynastic overthrow and the children of the overthrown lord growing up in secret to exact revenge and save the downtrodden villagers. Good story... but then the god becomes fully active and the movie suddenly changes to a gozilla style destruction move for the last part as the village and villians are stepped on with much glee by the awakened god/statue.
I guess the kids really weren't going to win... so bring in the statue to step on everything.... congratz... now you rule over.. well... a bunch of very flat buildings. Have fun rebuilding.",1374796800,2,838,4.630872483221476
1218059,3,B00000G3N0,"Mixing elements of the jedai(samurai)film with elements of the kaiju(monster)film, Daimajin is a rousing adventure that is sure to appeal to fans of both types of films.  Set in medievel Japan, the film follows  the story of a boy and his sister, who are pursued by the man who had their  father murdered and then took over his kingdom.  Watching all of this is  the giant statue of Majin, a powerful spirit that can be invoked to right  wrongs and punish evil-doers.  The story moves along well, aided by good  performances by all of the actors, though it is perhaps a bit slow at  first.  Once Daimajin(""dai"" meaning giant, ""majin""  meaning spirit) revives, all hell breaks loose on the evil Lord and his  men.  The spfx are spectacular(immensely aided by the widescreen  presentation).  Functioning like a pounding funeral drum is Akira Ifukube's  magnificent score, one of his best non-Godzilla works.  This is a great  film that is thankfully no longer obscure.",961632000,11,966,4.894409937888199
