7787865,3,0012175447,"I have not watched this in several years. From what I remember, it is not as good as the regular Bible Songs we used to own. It was ok though. What I really like is Kids Sing Praise Volume 1, a show we owned a long time ago. It has really great music and songs. Sadly, I think it might be out of print though. I really hope Kids Sing Praise is not out of print. I highly encourage this for young Christian kids.

My favorite show is Little House on the Prairie. That is a show I recommend. That is one a lot of Christians enjoy watching. My favorite book is Farmer Boy Goes West. Even the name of the title sounded very interesting to me!",1479945600,,638,4.0236220472440944
