7914401,2,B00001AQZ8,"I remember first seeing this movie on USA Network when I was really young.  I feel the same way today as I did back then, why was this movie only average despite a good cast?  First, we have Hsu Feng, a kung fu fighting femme fatale.  Next, there's Carter Wong, who's film credits are too numerous to list.  Finally, there's the awesome Chang Yi (just check him out in ""Shaolin Invincible Sticks"", ""Eagle's Claw"" & especially in Samo Hung's ""The Victim"".)  Except for the rousing opening & the fairly exciting end fight, the middle is absolutely boring.  I don't know if anybody else noticed this, but almost all the fights in the middle took place in the dark.  This is a lame tactic usually used because 1) the DP was incompetent, 2) the film's budget wouldn't allow for more lights or 3) to cover up an actor's lack of martial skill.  A so-so film recommended only to Carter Wong and/or Chang Yi completists only.  Hey, they can't all be as awesome as the Venoms, right?",1114819200,4,973,4.514285714285714
