8633495,3,B00HMAM2IE,"Somewhat misleading as to the title as one would think this is a soccer movie but instead it is about a male nanny who is a soccer die-hard hired by a mother who feels her two sons needed a male in their lives to replace, in part, their recently deceased patriarch. The nanny was able to get some of the community interested in this sport which merely served as an adjunct to the various problems of the family and their attempts to adjust themselves to a world without a husband/father. These problems led the oldest child to overdo on some of his drinking. The nanny made an attempt to help the child but as overprotective mothers are coupled with the assistance of a female cop and without any sane judgments being made created false rumors about the nanny which mushroomed into all kinds of problems--with the nanny, the family and even the community. To make matters worse the nanny's fiance from Norway showed up, but thankfully the situation began to get somewhat normal with the minds of the community now on a professional soccer team that came to town to play and help end this movie.",1462838400,,1094,4.586734693877551
8633496,1,B00HMAM2IE,"The only way you may enjoy this movie is by adopting the view that the purpose of marriage is to legitimize sex.  However, if you believe that marriage is a socio-economic institution whereby two people, ""wing to wing, oar to oar"" seek to better fit into the demands of society and its culture and provide children, if any, with a high quality home learning environment, then you must see this product of the arts as hopelessly counterproductive.

This movie only costs $1.99 to rent.  It would be better for your health if you took the $1.99 to a local Chinese take-out restaurant, or similar, bought a few loose cigarettes, and smoked them, and you would feel less sick to your stomach.",1456617600,,688,4.669421487603306
8633497,1,B00HMAM2IE,"TOTALLY misleading marketing on this film which is NOT ABOUT SOCCER AT ALL, and is probably NOT APPROPRIATE family viewing for kids under 13. Lots of sexual humor and innuendo, teenage binge drinking, bullying, and controversial social issues like same-sex attractions and abortion. Is it appropriate to cover these topics in film? Of course--but don't create a marketing campaign that explicitly promotes this as family-friendly and apparently aimed at 8-11 year olds.",1449532800,2,469,5.527777777777778
8633498,5,B00HMAM2IE,"I found my self really enjoying this movie, even though this is a low budget movie you cannot tell. It is beautifully captured, realistic, and very sweet.",1447891200,,154,4.7407407407407405
8633499,2,B00HMAM2IE,I do not recommend this. My 9 year old grandson told me it was a good story but not appropriate for kids.,1438560000,,105,3.8181818181818183
8633500,3,B00HMAM2IE,"This is not a great movie, but it does offer some entertainment and insights. Traci Lords is actually pretty good. There is some gentle humor and some drama. It is implied that this is a gay-themed movie, but not really.  However, it is surprising who turns out to be the gay character. It promotes compassion and acceptance.
It was interesting that it was filmed in Lindsborg, Kansas (known as Little Sweden locally) with apparently the entire population as extras. You do get an insight into Swedish culture and ranch life. Some of my enjoyment might have come from being familiar with Lindsborg.",1398124800,,598,4.862745098039215
