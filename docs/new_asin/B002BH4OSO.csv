Each of these only come with 5 fights and many cut out rounds 1 and 2. The DVD's only hold about 50 minutes of action. I am a big time MMA Fan and these DVDs are just not worth it. HDNET should have bundled the fights together and made compilation DVDs",1319241600,,373,4.123287671232877
8361401,5,B002BH4OSO,"For those who love Mixed Martial Arts the HDNet Fights: M-1 Challenge 2008 is spectacular, M-1 Global the promotion that created the M-1 Challenge is truly top notch. The M-1 Challange travels the world pitting Country against country in a team based MMA tournament. Only here can you see Russian teams against USA teams and every country against every country for that matter. I recommend this to all who are interested in MMA outside the UFC Universe.",1280448000,,453,4.896103896103896
