8404260,2,B003SEWMDI,"There are a couple of movie gems in this collection such as White Zombie (1932) and Night of the Living Dead (1968). Most of the films, such as The Last Man on Earth (1964) with Vincent Price are very poor quality and truncated. Even ""White Zombie"" is fuzzy, but it's still watchable. None of these films appear to be remastered. It's a very low quality set of B movies, but with eleven movies at almost 15 hours of playing time for such a low price it's hard to complain. Get the popcorn popping, turn down the lights, and don't expect too much...",1287792000,2,548,4.382352941176471
