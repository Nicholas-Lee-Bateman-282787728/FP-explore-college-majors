Betty and Kalani are simply wonderful and the dance, movements and ukelele segments are easy to follow and FUN! Betty's instructions are simple to follow and her voice is very soothing to listen to.  I love Kalani's ukelele segment and find that the techniques and chords are simple enough for anyone who has never played this instrument before.  This DVD would make the perfect gift for any family member or friends!  Aloha & Namaste, Betty and Kalani!",1337731200,6,532,4.698924731182796

8525480,5,B0085BPOV6,"Excellent beginner Hula Instructional DVDs. Instructor is very good at introducing the various types of hand and foot movements, uses when dancing Hula.  She shows you how to move your feet or hands when doing a specific Hula movement. You are then asked to do them with her as you play Disk 1. Short practice segments; so to become proficient  you will need to play Disk 1 and practice the movement regularly, as you would and exercise DVD.
The moves taught on the Disk 1, come together on Disk 2, as your instructor introduces segments of Hawaiian songs used when doing Hula. The Instructor shows you which of the movements are used to keep time to music being played on DVD.You also get to follow along and practice your newly acquired hand and foot movement. In Disk 2, you join the instructor's actual Hula class. You practice with class members doing the movements learned in Disk 1, and dance Hula to several songs in its entirety.
There is a short portion of Disk 2 where you learn to play the ukulele (if you own one and know chords) with musicians playing the songs you
have learned to Hula to. This is the real deal! Worth the money spent. It's like low impact exercising.",1431475200,5,1183,4.549295774647887
