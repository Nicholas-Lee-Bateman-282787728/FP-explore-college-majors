It also has too many plotholes like ""Why do they have to get the monster by midnight if the stuff and the castle are not going anywhere?"" The upside is that the claymation is first-rate. The jokes in this tape are funny. The voice acting is good. Overall,It's not great but pretty good. I give this tape a 7 out of 10.",1286582400,,381,4.232876712328767
