8296947,4,B001E6V4MC,"Good educational film here with some pretty good acting. A little cheesy seventies, but that is part of the charm. Very historically accurate.",1424908800,,142,5.217391304347826
8296948,5,B001E6V4MC,"Buy it for the historical content. Love it for the eyebrows, ashtray violence, and the crying Wilhelm.

Don't buy some new fancy video that trys to appeal to their sense of cool and fails. Show your students a 40 year old video  and force them to like it.",1414540800,,448,4.451219512195122
8296949,5,B001E6V4MC,"This is an excellent movie that outlines the steps Bismarck took to help bring about German unification.  The suggestion that the presenter make use of the pause button on the remote is an excellent idea provided the presenter has the background knowledge to explain the backstory of each event.  This movie truly shows how Bismarck was like a superior chess player, playing two or three steps ahead of all his opponents as well as his allies.",1414454400,,443,4.815789473684211
8296950,5,B001E6V4MC,"This is a fairly detailed 50 minute DVD aboiut one of the most important figures in history. This film works well in European History and World History survey courses. It certainly does not hurt for a teacher to use the pause button and explain certain parts, depending on the needs of the students. I use the old VHS, but plan on having my library update to this DVD this year.

It is a shame that the previous reviewer slammed this. The comments are really more an indictment of the educational system playing to the students than of the film.",1295395200,6,545,4.505050505050505
8296951,1,B001E6V4MC,"The packaging states that the video would have famous actors and authentic settings...that the video would be ""engrossing"". WOW! Talk about lies! 1st off, the video is from 1973! 19 friggin 73! As a teacher, you can't show something from 1993 without the kids falling asleep. All this for $59.99? Jeez what a rip off!",1224288000,6,317,4.781818181818182
