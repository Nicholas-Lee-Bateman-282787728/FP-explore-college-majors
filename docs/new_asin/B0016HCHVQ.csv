The viewing (on both DVD players, including a new Sony Blu-Ray) was heavily pixilated in most scenes.  I assume it was supplied in NTSC and Australia is, of course, PAL.  The Sony supplier assures me the DVD's converter can handle it okay.  It looked like the copy was made with a digital phone camera!  I will order another DVD from a different supplier.  It's a fun story with energetic dance scenes in the classic Bollywood ouvre which is very enjoyable.",1307923200,,609,4.522935779816514
8262512,4,B0016HCHVQ,"This is a romantic comedy film from India that's just a bit of light-hearted fun. The acting in it is quite good and it features two of India's biggest stars in the main roles. The movie is quite funny and it's something good for a rainy afternoon in where you don't want something sad and dramatic.

As for the ""2-disc set"" part. My movie came packaged with one disc in the case--the disc that contains the film. The other disc, presumably a soundtrack disc since I've received those for Bollywood films before, came completely blank and unlabeled wrapped in a bit of newspaper. I haven't tried using it yet. I don't mind, personally, since it was so inexpensive and the movie came promptly. All I really wanted was the movie. But if you have your heart set on a fancy 2-disc set with a nice, official, soundtrack disc, don't bet on it in this case.",1243123200,4,850,4.483870967741935
