8122519,2,B000FH7QSW,"THis movie was a low budget film with acting that was below par. Racing footage could have been much better. Alan Kulwicki's story was better than anything Hollywood could write. This film did not capture the fun loving side of Alan and throughout the movie protrayed him to be difficult and somber. They also did not show his relationship with his father, who was also very successful in racing. It was interesting to watch and it brought back many memories.",1391385600,,459,4.75

8122521,4,B000FH7QSW,"""Dare to Dream: The Alan Kulwicki Story"" was written and produced by Wisconsin fans of the late great 1992 NASCAR Winston Cup champ. The movie chronicles Alan's life from his beginnings in the short tracks of Wisconsin to his death while flying to Bristol Motor Speedway on April 1, 2003. Alan went down south to Charlotte with limited money, a borrowed truck, and a dream.

Footage was taped at Lowes Motor Speedway at Charlotte (NC), Slinger Speedway at Slinger (WI), and Wisconsin Internation Raceway (WIR) at Kaukauna (WI). I was fortunate to be in the crowd the night of taping at WIR.

The film is clearly a low budget production. The storyline is occasionally hard to follow, even to serious Kulwicki fans like me.

The film is a good representation of Alan and his career, considering the low budget. Don't expect a polished Hollywood production. I haven't seen the ESPN production ""3"" (the story of Dale Earnhardt), but others have said to me that Dare to Dream is as good if not better.",1164240000,2,996,4.745664739884393
8122522,4,B000FH7QSW,"I have waited since 2004 for this movie to come to DVD.  When purchasing this movie please keep in mind it is an independent film.  Therefore there are some downsides in that the volume, camera angles are limited from time to time.

What this does have though is great writing.  This showed Kulwicki good and bad side through his disappointments and triumphs.  It can be somewhat difficult to understand who some of the characters are at times, but the movie is very easy to follow along.  The music selected is powerful.

To draw a comparison if you liked the movie ""3"" you will probably also enjoy this movie.  Nascar fans from the early 90's and prior, this is a must see.  There is a bonus feature section on this DVD that provides about a 15 minute documentary that blends interviews with some footage from the film.  That alone was worth purchasing this DVD.  I hope you find this posting helpful.",1156982400,4,903,4.58125
