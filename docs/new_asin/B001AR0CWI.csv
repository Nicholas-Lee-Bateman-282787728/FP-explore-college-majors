I was pulled in by all the wonderful things that were said but this movie will put you and the dog to sleep. ""Don't waist your money""!!!",1232668800,8,241,4.127659574468085
3464749,2,B001AR0CWI,"I am a pastor of a church and I fully support Christians breaking in to the media market in an effort to spread the Gospel. Movies have become such a huge influence on our youth and young adults. Christians need to use this medium to tell the greatest story ever told. Films like ""Facing the Giants"" and ""Fireproof"" are great attempts to do this. however, with the quality of films that come from Hollywood, Christian movies have to step up if they want to truly compete.
""Hidden Secrets"" is a movie with a good plot and a great message. However, I had a really difficult time getting past the low quality filming and the really bad overacting. With so many Christians who possess a talent for acting; could they not have found better actors for this film?
You could probably use clips from this film in a small group study to teach lessons about judging others, forgiveness, righteous living, etc. But I fear that people who are used to Hollywood special effects and professional actors who allow you to get lost in the story will have a difficult time sitting through this one.",1225411200,12,1079,4.595854922279793
3464750,5,B001AR0CWI,"Hidden Secrets does sound like much when first hear the title, but it has good points and very Christian and for all of the John Schneider fans. I think is a very good credit for him he does a very neutral role for him, he plays Gary Zimmerman and he's Skeptic and he a friend of the girls brother in the movie.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hidden-Secrets/dp/B001AR0CWI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hidden Secrets</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/John-Schneider-s-Collier-Co-Hot-Pursuit/dp/B000R9SK2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">John Schneider's Collier & Co. -- Hot Pursuit!</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Against-Time-Collier-Co-Hot-Pursuit/dp/B0017PIBC6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Against Time/Collier & Co.: Hot Pursuit</a>",1223251200,,846,9.083333333333334

3464752,5,B001AR0CWI,"So refreshing. For someone who has collected a lot of christian movies I must they that Hidden Secrets has been a nice suprise. It was funny, thought provoking, realistic, true to the Gospel and professionally made.

Very good Drama...",1223251200,28,235,5.0256410256410255
3464753,4,B001AR0CWI,"I saw this in the theater as a sneak preview long, long ago.  I was eager to take friends to see it, but it was never released.  Now I guess I will just purchase copies for Christmas gifts.

Good story.  Every one has a secret - and all is revealed and the healing begins by the end.

Since it begins at the funeral of a common friend, it reminded me of a Christian ""Big Chill.""

Can't wait for the release of the DVD",1217376000,8,417,3.963855421686747

3464766,5,B001AR0CWI,This is definitely not for the politically corrrect crowd.  This looks at the sin inherent in man.  Excellent Christian movie.,1456185600,,126,5.25

3464773,1,B001AR0CWI,I wanted to like it but it wasn't a very Christ centered movie.  I see enough glorification of carnal Christianity throughout the week.  This took a step further by making me pay to see something I dislike.,1445126400,,206,4.54054054054054

3464780,5,B001AR0CWI,"When I first saw this movie, I loved the fact -- and still do -- that there is an effort to portray Christians not as all good or as all bad, but as we are, people who are also struggling sometimes in our lives, but who hold to the anchor that is Jesus Christ, our Savior, our daily salvation. The movie speaks of the challenges found in being truly Christian, the mistakes made, the forgiveness needed from others in our lives, and that forgiveness granted by those we have hurt. It speaks of our own hurts, and the healing found in the Word and body of Christ. It speaks of reaching out to others who do not yet have that Anchor, how there is no perfection in us, and we all need Him. I love this movie because it is real, and it is not afraid to deal with real issues. It is funny, confrontational in its reality, and captivating to me. I wholeheartedly recommend it.",1440374400,10,870,4.246987951807229

3464802,5,B001AR0CWI,"Excellent movie!  I love this movie and it is very rewarding for the Christian soul.  This movie displays how you can serve GOD and still have a nice night out with friends.  It shows how some people shy away from religion because certain people badger them about it, instead of teaching them the word of GOD, and giving then a chance to ask questions.  There is a character in the movie that pretends to be holier than anyone, and is constantly condemning other friends.  None of us are born without sin and this movie shows the life of ordinary people with different backgrounds, and how they approach accepting GOD into their life.

I recommend this movie and you will definitely enjoy it!",1420156800,6,692,4.631147540983607

3464816,5,B001AR0CWI,"This film is a great film for the family, though I would not recommend it for young children. Hidden Secrets addresses such questions  as, 'What if...?' and tackles them fearlessly. It is a film that will make you both laugh & cry and cause you to question why you believe what you do. Pureflix & David A.R. White have created a masterstroke of a film that you can enjoy over & over. I liked it because it didn't wrap everything up all 'nice & tidy' with some plot points which can let you draw your own conclusions to some of the questions.

David A R White gives his usual competent performance as a man having to confront his feelings for an ex-girlfriend who dumped him without excuse years before; John Schneider does well as a likeable agnostic, Corin Nemec (best remembered from the miniseries ""The Stand"") gives a surprisingly poignant performance as a Christian who still struggles with his sexual identity.

3464835,5,B001AR0CWI,"This movie has touched me so very deeply; it is the kind of movie that one even gets more and more out of--with each viewing.
I would venture to guess that even the producers had no idea how deep this would run in the heart of a Christian...(and I have not seen a bad review on this movie). I would love to see more movies and ""books"" on this venue.
It deals with the concept of judgmental-ism. Deep down, I think we can identify with all these characters in our daily walk.
Thereby, I think this movie helps us to grow. I know what it did/does for me.
Furthermore, the characters are so very likeable. Each character is very developed because the script is so well written.
I am a complete fan of this movie, and I am not sure if I ever watched one movie so often.
Not only would I give this movie more than five stars, I would give each actor/actress ten stars as well!
Another thing that is so cool, is that most of the main characters seem to have leading roles...they are all that important to the movie and the point.
Corin Nemec's (who plays Michael Stover) soft gentle voice and reflection brings this movie to life, and Autumn Paul (who plays Rhonda Mirfin) brings a character to the screen that makes us think about our own walk and the times we may have laid someone out on the street somewhere by what we have said. That is where this movie takes us for a ride of our own contemplation. Truly, an outstanding performance by all the cast.
Even more, there is something about the golden Polaroid filters in this movie that invite us to stay for a while. I greatly enjoyed the sets and the coloring that only seemed to enhance the theme of tender and emotional moments and even funny moments.
If you venture into this movie, stick around for the last few scenes...this is what makes you want to plug this movie back in the player soon...to see it again and let the message once again stir your heart.",1351123200,,1909,4.350140056022409

It's not what people expect from Christian dramas, this is truly amazing! Great cast, very talented and the soundtrack alone will have you buying this movie.  It's an amazing Christian drama with an all star cast. After we watched it 1 X we begin a search to own it, and we can't watch it enough.

I would venture to guess that even the producers had no idea how deep this would run in the heart of a Christian...(and I have not seen a bad review on this movie).  I would love to see more movies and ""books"" on this venue.
It deals with the concept of judgmental-ism.  Deep down, I think we can identify with all these characters in our daily walk.
Thereby, I think this movie helps us to grow.  I know what it did/does for me.
Furthermore, the characters are so very likeable.  Each character is very developed because the script is so well written.
I am a complete fan of this movie, and I am not sure if I ever watched one movie so often.
Not only would I give this movie more than five stars, I would give each actor/actress ten stars as well!
Another thing that is so cool, is that most of the main characters seem to have leading roles...they are all that important to the movie and the point.
Corin Nemec's (who plays Michael Stover) soft gentle voice and reflection brings this movie to life, and Autumn Paul (who plays Rhonda Mirfin) brings a character to the screen that makes us think about our own walk and the times we may have laid someone out on the street somewhere by what we have said.  That is where this movie takes us for a ride of our own contemplation.  Truly, an outstanding performance by all the cast.
Even more, there is something about the golden Polaroid filters in this movie that invite us to stay for a while.  I greatly enjoyed the sets and the coloring that only seemed to enhance the theme of tender and emotional moments and even funny moments.
If you venture into this movie, stick around for the last few scenes...this is what makes you want to plug this movie back in the player soon...to see it again and let the message once again stir your heart.",1348444800,,1916,4.350140056022409
3464838,4,B001AR0CWI,"We enjoyed the movie, it was entertaining as well as a realistic eye opener.  So many people want to play religion rather than living the lifes they are committed to.  We all do have things in our past that we are  ashamed of, but if we go to God in prayer and ask forgiveness - it can be attained.  We also need to have fellow Christins that we can turn to that will not exploit our sins, but console and pray for us too.",1347753600,,422,3.988095238095238
3464839,5,B001AR0CWI,"I loved this movie. It's very similar to the 1983 movie ""The Big Chill"". But with a Christian setting and worldview. This would be a group of friends I would want to hang out with compared to the cynical secular group in Big Chill though. In ""Hidden Secrets"", I can relate a lot with a few of the characters: primarily Jeremy and Anthony. Rhonda was hilarious and pathetic at the same time. Gary's skepticism is something we in Christendom hear often, in differing versions. I liked the vulnarability of Michael as well. And the final scene in the church is worth the price of the movie! Just as in David White's ""Encounter"", each part represents a character that is stereotypical with Christianity and needs to be addressed or confronted. This movie, just like 'Encounter', does this very well. In addition to watching the interaction of each of the friends (brought together with the death of the 'friend' that was the link with each of them--just like ""Big Chill""), I loved the people themselves. I have/had a group just like this and love them just like the people in this story love each other. At the end of the movie they part wiser. This is a better movie than I thought it would be. I also, fell in love with the rockabilly band, ""Truly Lover Trio"", playing in the bar scene. Thanks Pure Flix for introducing me! I have their CD, ""Bullseye"" and would recommend them as well as this great movie!",1347408000,,1403,4.5936254980079685

3464842,5,B001AR0CWI,"I don't know what I expected when I bought this movie -actually I was a little hesitant--not about the christian content but it had so few reviews.
John Schneider really is good in this movie--you can actually see his character as a real person. Jeremy's character is a little like he is pulled in many directions-from his girlfriend, to his ""calling"", and to his ex. All the characters in this movie seem realistic and you could actually see it ""all"" happening at one of your friends funural. The only thing I thought was a little strange was when everything -blowout- came to a point at the church. For that to happen is a little ""weird"" I have never been to a service were that would be acceptable behavoir or even allowed--but I have not been to every church so who knows?
Preteens and under would NOT enjoy this movie--it is slow and deals with lots of ""adult"" content. I really don't think under 20 yrs of age would really like it either.
This movie is a good portayal of ""forgiveness"" and how ""things just happen"" when you are trying to serve God and the ""pull"" that you feel wanting to be in the secular world and join in with others that are of the world.
There is a few ""chuckles"" in this movie but my no means could it be called a comedy -in ANY sense. It is a drama. You can actually see Jeremy's girlfriend wrangle a ""stay"" with his ex--i know you have met women like that. There is only a few things that I thought strange was the bar scene (out of all the scriptures that were being thrown around-- no one even came up with the scripture -""to abstain from the apperance of evil"" when that scene came up). They acted like it was perfectly fine for christians to go to a bar -even if they are not drinking--little out there for me on that. But overall I ENJOYED watching this movie. The sound could have been a mite better but -hey at least it had a good message and no cursing. That part is great.",1331424000,,1911,4.311111111111111

3464846,5,B001AR0CWI,"It is faith-based filming, but one done well, comparable even to films like ""Fireproof"" and ""Courageous"". It packed with some good action, lots of drama, comedy, a romance, and some deep thinking about issues. And this group of characters who come together as family and friends of a man just buried, have enough Hidden Secrets in their lives to scare a team of clergy. It pushes the Christian faith, even using scriptures, often Old Testament, or as one of the group who is Jewish (John Schneider-without the Dukes of Hazard car) says, ""We like to call it the ""Only Testament.""

Jeremy (David A.R. White plays the lead male role as well as helped produce and write this story) struggles with life and love. Preacher (Reginald Vel Johnson) can say more in a facial expression than many clergy say in a sermon. Tracy Melchior plays the deceased's sister Sherry, who is also a former girlfriend of Jeremy, fits the role perfectly and every so often gives expressions and looks that you will swear is Julia Roberts as a blond. Really well played roles by all, I'm impressed, as not all Christian films turn out this well. Another role that must be mentioned, since it is omitted on the DVD box is the hypocritical Rhonda, the in your face, scripture quoting, issue advocate, played by Autumn Paul so well you get fed up with Rhonda's almighty attitude even knowing it's just acting.

Feature does have SUBTITLES.
There are a few deleted scenes and a behind the scenes featurette as bonus. They always claim the trailers to be bonus, but we all know they are ads.

Solid Christian film, with a message. And fun (funny) too. Plenty of serious, but always followed by more humor. A very good mix. One my wife and I will watch repeatedly, and share with friends.

3464849,5,B001AR0CWI,"Hidden Secrets is one of the best movie plots that focus on Christian living.  It is a real story with real characters.  The actors have done a fine job of bringing life and depth to the story of very different  friends to the deceased character.  The story opens to a funeral of a man who affected the lives of a group of friends as different from each other as any great ensemble cast.  The funeral of Chris, brings many of his friends together who end up sharing how Chris had affected their lives in the best of ways, over a weekend.  Each character deals with individual issues, from homosexuality, to stereotypical judgmental Christian, to a Christian who has fallen away from faith, to a person seeking truth.  This story also addresses the personal bias' that people have of others and opens the eyes of each character in a revealing way that shows how Jesus can touch each individual life and bring peace.  I highly recommend the movie Hidden Secrets and any other movie made by Pure Flix.  These are not your average Christian stories.  Very well made and acted.  I own many of Pure Flix's Christian movies.  I lost my copy, which is why I am buying another to replace it.  A movie you can watch over and over and share with others.

My expectations weren't too high for it being much more than an average movie, but boy was I pleasantly surprised!  What a really top-notch Christian movie it turned out to be!  The acting, humor, storyline and Christian message were all superb.  I liked it so well that I went online and bought 6 copies of it to share with friends.

I would have categorize this movie as a real sleeper, at least personally, as I can't believe I had never heard of it.  I would have to put it in the same company of some really good Christian movies, such as ""Fireproof"" and ""Facing the Giants.""  Too bad it has been discontinued, and can only be purchased through used movie dealers.  Watch for this to come to TBN (Trinity Broadcasting Network) again, or else buy yourself a copy.

3464868,4,B001AR0CWI,"I found Hidden Secrets to be very uplifting in spite of some very heavy themes. The film revolves around the love a group of people share for a friend (and brother in one case) who had recently died. From this group of people, we can see the impact that one person can have on other people's lives. Through this, we see many different levels of faith played out in the relationships, from unbeliever to convicted fundamentalist. It is an interesting study on the interplay of life and faith. The movie is written from a Christian standpoint, and that comes through clearly throughout the movie. There were periods in the film where I felt some disconnect as the writer tried to cover a large spectrum of levels of faiths. I would have happily endured another 20 minutes to see a bit more character development to flesh out some of the relationships and background story that would've filled the gaps later on as the movie progressed. In spite of these small points where I wanted more, the film was well done, well acted and very well filmed. I appreciate this kind of film, and hope film makers like this are encouraged in the marketplace to continue to produce and to improve the film industry. I fully recommend it, and will likely be watching it again soon with my wife. I'd give it 4 out of 5 stars!

I would have to say, this movie was so very well thought out, from the writing down to the actors chosen to perform, that it just brings the whole package to a level of very good quality.

The story begins with several friends meeting at the funeral of a mutual friend after years of not seeing each other or keeping up with their lives.  As the story unfolds, you have perspective of each of the lives represented there...the past and present.  There is one character, Rhonda, whose personal goal it is, to save the world...by shoving it down everyone's throat...even the already saved!  Skeletons begin to fall out of private closets revealing the most secret sins.  But by coming together, they help each other through and experience love and forgiveness they never thought possible.

John Schneider should have been able to pull it through, but even his performance falls very short.  And don't even get me started on Autumn Paul as ""Rhonda"".  Holy cow she is a terrible actress!  Corin Nemek was pretty good though.  Overall this movie is best suited for those over 13 because of the adult topics it deals with.  Actually anyone 18 & younger would probably find it very boring!
