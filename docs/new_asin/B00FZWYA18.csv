8619794,5,B00FZWYA18,. . . that most American artists lack. Had I been alive when this documentary was first released and had I seen the film I would probably have dropped everything that I was doing and move to France. I could criticize parts of this documentary but the filmmakers would be unlikely to give a damn about what I had to say. That is part of what makes this such compelling filmmaking. Highly recommended for filmmakers who walk the line between drama and documentary and for the followers of the Vietnam conflict that need to feel a sense of moral outrage all over again or for filmmakers who want to feel a sense of moral outrage or for followers of Vietnam who wasn't to walk the line between drama and documentary. Highly recommended.,1497657600,,732,4.553030303030303
8619795,4,B00FZWYA18,"I am a Viet Nam veteran. I remember hearing about this movie shortly before I was deployed to Tan Son Nhut. The production value of this movie is far below the quality of what is produced in modern times, but the historical value is second to done. What I found interesting is how accurate this film is in its assessment of the war, and how it took more than thirty years and the Freedom of Information Act to reveal just how accurate the message in this documentary was.",1493078400,2,471,4.363636363636363

8619799,5,B00FZWYA18,"some of the best filmmakers of the French new wave, motivated only by their feelings for the injustices of the war, without getting paid, and without taking individual credit for their contributions, came together to make a work that obviously hit close to home here in America, and it's a shame more people then didn't see it, and i hope that people now will give it a fair chance and respect it (and they) are due., it is an innovative, revelatory and sometimes moving document of a time and place and peoples we too easily forget.",1388880000,10,533,4.5625
8619800,3,B00FZWYA18,"It was also during that chilling and feverish year of 1967 that an international collective of world renowned film makers (including directors Alain Resnias, Agnes Varda, Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Lelouch, Joris Ivens and William Klein) got together in a spirit of bonhomie and shared purpose to make Far From Vietnam, an unremitting and unapologetic anti-warand more pointedlyanti-American film.

Opening and closing with footage of munitions being laded onto aircraft carriers of the 7th Fleet, positioned in the Tonkin Gulf, the documentary skillfully employs what was obviously intended as propaganda film for U.S. forces, to indict the same American military industrial complex that commissioned it.

There are certainly brilliant moments that follow, but it wasn't too long in that I began to get a sinking feeling that here was another high-wattage cinematic collaboration, set to immolate from manic energy and flame out like a supernova, fueled by bias, confusion and egotism.

The latter is most clearly demonstrated in Godard's segment, titled ""Camera Eye,"" featuring the famed director in the guise of camera operator, his face obscured by the giant machine as he delivers a monologue that quickly veers from stream of consciousness to rambling discourse. This is the sight and sound of a cinematic genius searching for something to say, and failing.

Elsewhere, streams of newsreel footageboth color and black and white, with picture and sound quality ranging from pristine to punishing to watch. Film of tiny Vietnamese citizens preparing for bombardment and crawling from the wreckage of America's attempt to ""resist Communist aggression"" is contrasted with footage of burly, barrel-chested U.S. GI Joes, being pulled through the streets of Saigon in Rickshaws, all the while flexing their enormous biceps as they grip their rifles and glare menacingly at the traffic of locals passing by. There's a bone-chilling interview with Ho Chi Min, calmly predicting that America's folly (attacking North Vietnam with a heretofore unseen barrage of firepower) will not prevent the natives from achieving ultimate victory: ""We are determined to fight. Whether it is in 5 years, 10 years, 20 years or more, we will win.""

Going into Far From Vietnam, I expected an embarrassment of riches. I'm an avowed French new wave film fanatic (with Godard's work a particular favorite), and despite whatever good intentions may have prompted America to enter Vietnam, I can't see any evidence to support the argument that the campaign was anything but a deadly disaster, one that's haunted our history for over half a century since it began, and nearly half a century since we concluded operations there. Of course, my perspective is clearly of the ""armchair analysis"" stripe, with the benefit of hindsight and historical record, which no film from 1967 could possibly have.

And yet, for a film about the Vietnam war made largely by Frenchmen (Documentarian and cinematic essayist Chris Marker, La Jetee, served as the film's supervising coordinator, producer and editor, in addition to contributing much of the text), the picture presented here intentionally skims overor altogether omitsa mountain of historical fact.

Just whom did the United States take over the battle from, and how different was the objective of the U.S. campaign and the one before it? By doing no more than mentioning that the French passed on their fight to Americans, the film maliciously short-changes the audience through miseducation. Why sympathy for the poor plight of Vietnamese citizens only now? Sure, I can understand the reason for scrambling the image as General William Westmoreland blatantly lies before an audience sympathetic to his cause, but why is an exclusive interview with Fidel Castrowho expounds at length about his seemingly altruistic reasons for leading his own revolutionnot accorded the same treatment? It's certainly not because he's being any more honest.

Therein lies the rub, and the film's inexcusable flaw: by insisting that the complexities in Southeast Asia can be summed up in three words (America is bad), Far From Vietnam becomes every bit as dunder-headed and dismissible in its way as The Green Berets.

Icarus Films has done a splendid job transferring this little-seen relic to home video, with a clear and vibrant full-frame print, though bear in mind that the frequent use of stock footage means some unavoidable depreciation in picture and sound. Otherwise, the Dolby 2.0 mono sound works well, and those who don't parlez vous Francais have optional English subtitles to help them.

There are two bonus features: the original theatrical trailer, and ""The Sixth Side Of The Pentagon,"" a taut and absorbing twenty six minute documentary by Marker and Francis Reichenbach.
