1048417,5,6305546975,OMG !! What were the writers thinking when they made this trash ??  Only reason I gave it 5 stars is cuz I appreciate Justin Berfield's comic talents.  Justin is great in Unhappily ever After and Malcolm in Middle.  But this movie is about as cheesey as they come.,977011200,4,264,4.346938775510204
1048418,5,6305546975,"My main question is---what was a talented actor like Justin Berfield doing starring in this drivel??  The acting in this movie was so bad (other than Justin and Trenton Knight) that I couldn't help but laugh through most of it.  Oh well, at least the first Invisible Mom picture was pretty good.  Let's just hope that Justin sticks to Malcolm in the Middle---these B movies that he stars in just aren't cutting it.",970444800,,414,4.6438356164383565
1048419,5,6305546975,"This movie is highly entertaining.  The highlight is Micky Dolenz as Bernard.  Finally, he has more than just a few scenes in a movie!  And he looks great with his hair down ;-)  The movie is great for family night.",940550400,7,215,4.3

7891707,4,6305546975,"This movie makes me think of old Disney films like the Shaggy Dog, or Flubber. [the originals]. The sets are early sixties style, the settings, dialog, the entire atmosphere. A nice fantasy story with a Wally and Beaver era family set in the ninties. There is a real feeling the director tried to capture that era. The main star is Barry Livingston who worked with Fred Mac Murry on My 3 Sons. Also with Mickey Dolenez [Monkees] as the villian dressed like Uncle Creepy. [back in the old movie days villians looked like villians] Any 35-40 + year old parents would like it, as well as their kids.",1230681600,,596,4.527777777777778
7891708,3,6305546975,"OK, so this isn't a GREAT movie, but I did get a kick out of it.  If you are a Micky Dolenz fan, it is worth seeing just for his role, which does fit him.  The images it gives of the foster care system are laughable... My 4 year old was a bit scared of all the threatened violence in it.  I'd watch it, but get it from the library.",1140048000,,331,3.7
7891709,1,6305546975,"I got this video from my brother-in-law, who used to work in the home video industry.  He would get all sorts of free screener tapes from distributors, and he would keep the good movies, and give ME the b-grade flicks such as this.

A friend and I like to watch bad films, and I whipped this out one day and he started laughing at the pictures on the packaging -- especially the picture on the back, which he said seems to show Invisible Mom saying ""I'm invisible!  How did this happen? How did I *get* invisible?"" (When you see the picture, you'll know what he meant).  The film was produced by Fred Olen-Ray, who (I kid you not) my friend had received E-MAIL from that week! (He'd purchased one of Fred's other movies -- why I have no idea -- and had to return it).

ANYWAY, on to the film itself: it stars Dee Wallace Stone (from ""Cujo"" and ""E.T."") in the title role, with Mickey Dolenz of ""The Monkees"" as a villian, and that kid who plays ""Reese"" on ""Malcolm In The Middle"" as an orphan (who acts and behaves just like ""Reese"" from ""Malcolm In The Middle"").  Now, there's ""good"" bad movies (high in unintentional humor), and there's ""bad"" bad movies (devoid of any saving graces).  I'm sorry to say that this film falls into the latter category.

I'm being a little harsh though, I'll admit -- this film was probably aimed at younger audiences, and it honestly makes a decent family film, but if you're an adult you'll probably be bored to tears.",1120780800,,1451,4.428571428571429
7891710,5,6305546975,"how can you give this movie bad reviews?  it is so cool!  justin berfield rocks and he is soo adorable in the movie.  that alone gives it 5 stars.  it is a really cool movie, too!  the whole 'bernard?' 'no...BERNERD' thing is soo cool, and like everything...it just rules!  i admit, if it didn't have justin berfield in it, i wouldn't love it, let alone rent it, but i would still like it!  maybe older people won't enjoy it, but rent it for the kids!  or, say its for the kids just so you won't look stupid renting it for yourself even though you really want it for yourself because you want to see how cute justin berfield is...  with that said, have a grand evening!  bye bye!",1027468800,,679,4.234375
