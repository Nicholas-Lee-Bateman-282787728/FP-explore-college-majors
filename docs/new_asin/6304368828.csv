855889,4,6304368828,"""Treasure of Matecumbe"" has to be one of my favorite childhood movies, and rewatching it has been a treat. The DVD is only available new (as of now) from the Disney Movie Club or Disney Movie Rewards (550 points), but it's worth getting it one way or the other.

In response to another's review, the DVD presentation is NOT cut; though the back does claim a 107 minute run-time, it runs approximately 117 minutes (1:57). It is disappointing that the presentation is fullscreen (1.33:1 aspect ratio) when it undoubtedly was filmed in widescreen, and it hasn't been restored to the quality of the Vault Disney Collection (there is a large amount of grain, artifacts, etc.) Despite this, I would highly recommend this to any fan of Disney films, or quality family films in general.",1196380800,3,778,4.8059701492537314
855890,2,6304368828,"I have a sinking feeling that Matecumbe's long-overdue arrival to DVD is not without flaw.  The running length says 107 minutes but the theatrical version clocked in at 117 min.  The original 1985 VHS ran at 107 min. but the 1997 VHS re-release restored the film to its original length.  Because the title now falls under the ""Wonderful World of Disney"" banner, it looks like the disc is the shorter broadcast version, unfortunately.  Very disappointing, for this is one Disney title I've been waiting years for to come to DVD.  Oh well.  I've still got my 117-min. VHS.",1194739200,,570,4.76530612244898
855891,5,6304368828,"Speaking as one who owns not the DVD, but rather the VHS version of this film, I have to say that I grew up with this movie my whole life and recommend it highly.

""The Treasure of Matecumbe"" is one of the finest Disney movies ever made, my favorite at least. Yes the 1970s were some fine years for the movie making company, and this is just another example. Highly unknown and underwatched, this movie is a classic. Starring the great, English, Peter Ustinov, and the lovely Joan Hackett, this story takes us back to old Civil War days, with stories and maps of stolen Union gold buried deep in the hot, southern country of the Florida Keys. Young Davey Burney and friends embark on a dangerous race against rogue Union officer Spangler and his men in search of the buried treasure. ""The Treasure of Matecumbe"" follows them on their adventure from the grassy meadows of Kentucky, on down lazy southern rivers into old New Orleans and beyond to the unknown Florida Keys.

The wonderful thing about this movie is just how authentic it is, made back in a time when Disney was a little less Hollywood-ized, and a little more real. It is pleasantly coupled with humor, as well as historical accuracy, and includes the finest actors for their parts. When you watch this movie you will feel as if you've stepped back in time as well. A truly well made adventure with a wonderful backdrop. This movie is so much fun for the whole family, and I couldn't have been happier when I'd found that it was finally available on DVD.

This is a movie that you can afford to take a chance on even if you have never seen it before. Believe me, it is a good investment because I guarantee that you will probably not buy a better Disney movie any time soon.

From deep within the Disney vaults, ""The Treasure of Matecumbe""",1185667200,11,1801,4.4984709480122325
855892,5,6304368828,"STORY: Action, comedy, adventure, romance, nostalgia, this movie had a bit of something for everyone. Immediately after the American Civil War in Kentucky, two young boys one white named David, one black named Thad, begin the adventure of their lives. They live on Grassy, the family plantation, with David's aunts but it is depleted of all its money and they could lose it soon. Someone shows up late at night near death with a secret to a map hidden in the attic by Davids father before he died. But the same night a murderous criminal gang led by Spnagler (Vic Morrow) arrives in the night, breaking into the family plantation in order to steal a map to a treasure. The boys run away with the map, and start traveling to the Florida swampland. They know they can trust no one with their secret. Along the way they meet up with many friends and enemies, while still being pursued by the original crooks. A conniving southern belle Lauriette (Joan Hackett), a jolly medicine show doctor (Peter Ustinov), and a roaming adventurer (Robert Foxworth) alternatley help and slow the boys at times, but eventually they all join up together. It's a treasure hunt and a journey story story rolled into one. A good adventure movie, might be watched split over two nights if you have smaller kids since it is a bit long and slows down in parts.  The movie's running time is a bit long at 116 minutes when the average movie is 90 minutes. But don't get me wrong, it's really fun.

BEHIND THE SCENES: The remarkable Peter Ustinov who also starred in ""Blackbeards Ghost"" stars as Dr. Snodgrass, a quack medicines show doctor.  Dick Van Patten and Jane Wyatt also star. Released as a theatrical movie on July 9, 1976 the movie was directed by Vincent McEveety. He directed mostly comedies at Disney like ""Gus"", ""Million Dollar Duck"", The Strongest Man in the World"" and the hilarious ""Superdad"". He is also known for his earlier job as a Disney writer, responsible for most of the wacky college films like ""Now You See Him, Now You Don't"", and ""The Barefoot Executive"". The title song was written by Shane Tatum and Richard McKinley. The film required extensive location shooting, beginning in Danville Kentucky, including an early 1800's plantation, with over 200 acres. They also shot on the Sacrament River, standing in as the mighty Mississippi. They used the real Everglades in an area not far from Walt Disney World.  The hurricane was filmed in Seminole country and was created in a similar method to one Disney used in the movie ""The Wild Country"". The studio brought in giant wind machines and airplane engines, this time adding water to the wind. In the film, there is a scene where Ustinov appears to fall and be washed away in the hurricane, surely to die. What viewers did not know at the time was that this was more than good acting, the fall was real, and he was hospitalized from the damage to his left ankle. Some final scene beach scenes, post hurricane, were actually filmed at Disney's man-made lagoons inside Walt Disney World. The screenplay was adapted from the book ""A Journey to Matecumbe"", by Robert Lewis Taylor. It was a project that Walt Disney had green-lighted when he was alive, but it took awhile for the studio to get to filming it. The movie later aired on ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" television show on October 2, 1977 as a two hour format. They did some extensive editing to make it fit in the time slot for that night, and maybe that was a good thing. The movie comes in a bit long and does drag a little at times, but we still enjoyed it.  By the way, this is not the edited copy, but the full length version. And it was released on video in 1986 for the first time. It was released on DVD in 2009.",1130803200,29,3727,4.59009009009009
855893,5,6304368828,"This movie is a great family adventure. With a ton of adventure, and also the usual crooks. A sweet little boy who lives with his 2 aunts wants to save their estate Grassy.

But un-beknownst to them a group of crooks called Spanglers men. Want this fortune and will do anything to get it including murdering. This movie has a funny cast including the Late Joan Hackett, and Peter Ustinov. This is a great movie, sure to be enjoyed by the whole family.",1096934400,2,606,4.324561403508772

856409,4,6304368828,"I liked the movie, though I saw it for the first time in 2015. It was released in theaters when I was 4 years old. It had some good well known actors and actresses, Joan Hackett, Vic Morrow, Peter Ustinov. Peter Ustinov is a movie star and movie director famous for a lot of movies he's been involved with. He gives another great performance in this movie as a snake oil salesman who helps the boy stars of this movie get down to Florida to find their hidden treasure. Vic Morrow was the sergeant from TV's 'Combat' series. Hard to accept him as a villain in this movie; And Joan Hackett, one of the most beautiful actresses of all time. I just love you Joan, wherever you are. From your TV appearances to your movie roles you were always lovely and well acted and elegant. Too bad you died so early.

  Joan looks very differently than she does in anything she's ever been in. She basically does a Bernadette Peters impersonation throughout the movie, in look and acting. I really thought it was Bernadette at first, until I had watched Joan for a while and seen that trademark Joan Hackett smile. Disney did movies on the cheap but this one was worth watching, it had decent action, drama and adventure. If I'd had seen this as a kid I'd have loved it then too, even if I hadn't known some of my favorite actors and actresses were in it.",1435968000,,1339,4.3694779116465865

The cast is excellent and so are their performances.  The story is a rambling adventurous quest involving two boys who accumulate allies along the way, not unlike the way Dorothy does in her search for the emerald city.  While Robert Foxworth is the star of the film, he doesn't even make his entrance for an hour into the film.  Peter Ustinov is excellent.

Get your ticket to ride along on this rollicking, classic Disney adventure!

This film is a childhood favorite, which deserves to be shared with a new generation.  Today's producers could learn a lot from revisiting the genre of young, historical adventure narratives that derive themselves from a simpler, yet challenging time based in hope rather than dystopia.  This film is a pleasant reminder of the adventure found in your own backyard, rather than in outer space or the survival arena.

The Treasure of Matacumbe is a bold adventure film with some surprisingly striking moments, and is the definite Godflicker of films like: The Goonies, Raiders of the Lost Ark and Explorers.  I would even place a bet that Tarantino was inspired by Matacumbes' Ku Klux Klan encounter as he wrote the screenplay for Django Unchained.

Their group is led by Vic Morrow (as Spangler) who gets by with a glare.  The only killing is done at the beginning and with that out of the way, the level of danger remains the same (amounting to little more than a few nasty threats, a slap, and escaping from the law AND a well-meaning runaway bride).  There's even a high-stepping production number done on a dock!  It's pretty dull until they start adding better actors/characters to the expedition.  Joan Hackett is a hoot as the reluctant bride (Lauriette Paxton).  Peter Ustinov adds some much needed humor as the snake-oil salesman Dr. Ewing T. Snodgrass.

856639,4,6304368828,"""Treasure of Matecumbe"" is a Walt Disney Production made in 1976.

This is a good adventure movie but it should be kept in mind that the
critics have mostly agreed that ""Treasure of Matecumbe"" is not highly
rated in many aspects of production.

However, I am not a professional movie critic.  I watch movies to be
entertained and not to pick out all the technical faults.

That having been said, this movie did not disappoint me.  It was
light hearted and enjoyable with a liberal sprinkling of adventure,
action, humour and drama, with attention to detail for the time and
place in which the movie is set.

I enjoyed the roles played by the entire cast namely:
Robert Foxworth as Jim
Joan Hackett as Lauriette
Peter Ustinov as Dr Snodgrass
Vic Morrow as Spangler
Johnny Doran as Davie
Billy Atmore as Thad.

The story concerns two young boys, Davie and Thad, who are searching
for buried treasure along the Florida coastline during the mid 19th
century.

Along the way, the boys pick up three adult helpers - Lauriette,
Dr Snodgrass and Jim who also become involved in all the excitement.

The boys and their helpers are pursued by the evil Spangler and his
group of men who will do anything to get their hands on the treasure.

Not a movie classic by most standards but I did find it very
entertaining.

He is also known for his earlier job as a Disney writer, responsible for most of the wacky college films like ""Now You See Him, Now You Don't"", and ""The Barefoot Executive"". The title song was written by Shane Tatum and Richard McKinley. The film required extensive location shooting, beginning in Danville Kentucky, including an early 1800's plantation, with over 200 acres. They also shot on the Sacrament River, standing in as the mighty Mississippi. They used the real Everglades in an area not far from Walt Disney World. The hurricane was filmed in Seminole country and was created in a similar method to one Disney used in the movie ""The Wild Country"". The studio brought in giant wind machines and airplane engines, this time adding water to the wind. In the film, there is a scene where Ustinov appears to fall and be washed away in the hurricane, surely to die. What viewers did not know at the time was that this was more than good acting, the fall was real, and he was hospitalized from the damage to his left ankle. Some final scene beach scenes, post hurricane, were actually filmed at Disney's man-made lagoons inside Walt Disney World. The screenplay was adapted from the book ""A Journey to Matecumbe"", by Robert Lewis Taylor. It was a project that Walt Disney had green-lighted when he was alive, but it took awhile for the studio to get to filming it. The movie later aired on ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" television show on October 2, 1977 as a special two hour format night, which they usually held to one hour. They did some extensive editing to make it fit in the time slot for that night. But the version on this disc is the original complete and unedited version. The running time listed on this page is incorrect, and after watching it all the way through, I have learned that nothing has been edited versus my complete VHS version. It was released on video in 1986 for the first time (unedited), and now on DVD for the first time in 2008. As originally filmed the movie's running time was at 116 minutes. It has not been remastered for this version. While it is not in widescreen on this DVD, It is possible that this is the original format. It was made during a period that Disney was filming many movies like this in full screen in order to easily re-show them on their TV show.

THE STORY: Action, comedy, adventure, romance, nostalgia, this movie had a bit of something for everyone. Immediately after the American Civil War in Kentucky, two young boys one white named David, one black named Thad, begin the adventure of their lives. They live on Grassy, the family plantation, with David's aunts but it is depleted of all its money and they could lose it soon. Someone shows up late at night near death with a secret to a map hidden in the attic by Davids father before he died. But the same night a murderous criminal gang led by Spangler (Vic Morrow) arrives in the night, breaking into the family plantation in order to steal a map to a treasure. The boys run away with the map, and start traveling to the Florida swampland. They know they can trust no one with their secret. Along the way they meet up with many friends and enemies, while still being pursued by the original crooks. A conniving southern belle Lauriette (Joan Hackett), a jolly medicine show doctor (Peter Ustinov), and a roaming adventurer (Robert Foxworth) alternately help and slow the boys at times, but eventually they all join up together. It's a treasure hunt and a journey story story rolled into one. A good adventure movie, might be watched split over two nights if you have smaller kids since it is a bit long and slows down in parts.",1262649600,,4079,4.633977900552487

856726,5,6304368828,"I could speak volumes on what I think of Disney films. Like so many others, those days of adventure and classic TV are all but gone. However DVD at least allows us to finally fill that void and this - from Disney Studios later years, is a great fun flick for all the family. Lots of laughs; cheeky characters and excitement in the usual Disney tradition.

This is another of my favorites from the 'Wonderful World of Disney'. Many people have gone on about the lackluster version of the DVD itself i.e. no special features etc, but as long as there is the movie and it has great color and sound - as this edition has - I am happy.

I would agree with many others however - Disney DVD take note - it would be better for you to edit it the way people prefer and to keep that whole Disney experience as part of the program... have that 'Wonderful World Of Disney' intro right at the start of the movie... hey lets keep the Disney old days feel about it all. Lets face it - that is why people buy these movies - to relive those good old days! A MUST HAVE, DISNEY FANS!",1246060800,6,1064,4.160194174757281
856727,5,6304368828,"This film is not for those who crave Disney's light-hearted family comedies. This is for those who love adventure, and spine tingling suspense. I mean there were some rather intense moments in this film; especialally the musical piece that I can only say is ""Spangler's Theme"". This story looks like it was set back in the 1860's just a little after the Civil War. It's about 2 boys who recieve a treasure map from a runaway slave where there's a buried treasure in Florida on the Florida Key known as Matecumbe. They get chased by a man named Spangler who was played rather well by the late Vic Morrow. The 2 boys whose names are Davey and Thad are trying to find Davey's uncle, and pick up some interesting characters along the was in the names of I want to make sure this is right Lilienne played by Joan Hackett, and Dr. Snodgrass played by the late Peter Ustinov. They not only have to endure Spangler and his men chasing them, but also a KKK lynching, mosquitoes, a hurricane, and a hostile Indian tribe all so they could get the treasure. Unfortunately, this movie was overlooked when it came out in 1976. There were 2 other movies that came out that same year in the theaters. ""No Deposit No Return"" which is a rather good comedy I must confess, and the Oscar-winning flick called ""Gus"". I am glad that Disney finally put this out on dvd considering that the Disney channel no longer runs the overnight tribute to the old Disney programs known as Vault Disney. It's a juicy movie with alot of meat on the bones for the eating.",1232668800,16,1534,4.482142857142857
856728,5,6304368828,"In the post-Civil War South, a young boy named Davie and his best-friend Thad find themselves on a big river adventure heading towards Florida with treasure map in hand. Along the way, they team up with a sly, adventurous southern lady, a kind-hearted snake-oil salesman, and Davie's own heroic uncle Jim, but they also must steer clear of pursuing river pirates, a tribe of dangerous Indians, gators, a hurricane, and even the Ku Klux Klan!

""Treasure of Matecumbe"" is the perfect Disney adventure for the Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn fan who is looking for something new. Unquestionably a product of '70's Disney with a then-modern, folk-style opening theme song, '70's Disney production qualities and styles, and favorite actors of the time (Peter Ustinov is enjoyable as ever as medicine-show man Doctor Snodgrass), ""Treasure of Matecumbe"" has its flaws, but it holds up well as a fun, family adventure viewers of any age will enjoy. While it isn't the most realistic film at times, it has a lot of clever moments and plenty of Disney charm, and it comes off as one of the finer of Disney's lesser-known 1970's offerings.

The DVD is now available in wide release, previously only available to members of the Disney Movie Club. It is a barebones release in fullscreen format, but the picture and sound quality are good (at least to this layman's eyes and ears). Speaking as both a Disney fanatic and someone who loves Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn-based films, rediscovering this Disney treasure that is very similar in theme has been a real treat! As another reviewer stated so well, it very much feels like ""Huckleberry Finn"" meets ""The Apple Dumpling Gang"", so if you know those stories, you'll know exactly what to expect. For those who buy this film and enjoy it, I highly recommend not only those films (for Huck Finn, my favorite is the Disney/Elijah Wood version, though the Patrick Day one is the best for matching the book), but also ""Rascals and Robbers: The Secret Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn"" and other films about Twain's two classic rapscallions, not to mention other Disney films from the 1970's. It's most regularly considered the worst time at the Walt Disney studios, but some of us enjoy the films of that era as well. Each decade from the Disney Studios has its own special qualities that can be viewed as charming or otherwise. ""Treasure of Matecumbe"" is no exception, but regardless, it is a fine family adventure in its own right and should be a welcome addition to any home video library.",1231027200,2,2533,4.8341013824884795
856729,4,6304368828,"Treasure of Matecumbe is another family action film from Disney.  Although not one of their best-known or higher budget movies, this one still manages to entertain.  Lots of adventure, some decent stars, and the Disney talent for filmmaking...",1228521600,,243,5.368421052631579
856730,1,6304368828,"I had always wanted to see this movie as it was based on one of my favorite books, the historical novel ""A Journey to Matecumbe"" by Robert Lewis Taylor, who also wrote the Pulitzer Prize winning novel, ""The Travels of Jamie McPheeters.""  The book is a wonderful exciting and funny tale of a post-Civil War journey by a young boy and his uncle from Kentucky to the Florida Keys being pursued by the Ku Klux Klan and a vengeful southern aristocrat, with lots of great adventures in between.

I spent $[...] for this movie and now wish I hadn't.  The names of a few characters from the book are retained, but almost everything else is changed.  It is neither particularly exciting or funny and it wastes the talents of a number of excellent character actors like Peter Ustinov, Dub Taylor, George Lindsay and Joan Hackett.  It was also made on the cheap with lots of stock footage of the exotic locales that the characters are supposed to visit and lots of process shots filmed in front of blue screens.  I suppose very young children MIGHT like it, but there are some violent scenes that make it problematic even for them.  It's an eternal mystery why Hollywood buys the rights to film wonderful books and then doesn't put on the screen anything of what made the books wonderful in the first place.",1220054400,,1296,4.584415584415584
856731,4,6304368828,"If you're looking to relive fond memories of sitting in front of the TV Sunday afternoons watching The Wonderful World of Disney, this will fit the bill nicely.

Treasure of Matecumbe has everything you'd expect from the generally mediocre live-action output Disney was known for in the 1970s: Bad rear-projection shots when people are outdoors? Check. Grainy, mismatched inserts of wildlife borrowed from True-Life Adventures episodes shot 25 years earlier? Check. Half-hearted attempt at a contemporary-sounding theme song (wholly inappropriate for the post-Civil War setting of this film)? Check.

Sort of a hybrid of Huckleberry Finn and the Apple-Dumpling Gang, Treasure of Matecumbe (presented full-screen pan-and-scan, subtitled, no extras) follows the river-borne trek of two boys in pursuit of buried treasure. Along the way they pick up a southern belle and a crooked medicine man, face thuggish river folk, alligators, mosquitoes, a hurricane, masked Indian tribesman, and... the KKK?

Yes--in what must be a Disney first, we actually see a white-hooded mob set a cross on fire at would-be lynching (here, to punish a white Yankee ""traitor""). The lynching is disrupted when the boys attack with MOLOTOV COCKTAILS!

In a later scene, male prisoners of the Matecumbe tribesman are referred to repeatedly as ""squaws"" (which, per the film, apparently translates to ""slaves"").

While I admit I was initially somewhat shocked by these scenes only because they were so unexpected, this feeling was quickly supplanted by immense gratitude that I was not forced to endure a 10 minute lecture from Leonard Maltin explaining the historical context or apologizing for this now politically incorrect content.

Does this mark the end of Disney's kowtowing to the easily offended? Will Disney begin releasing vintage content without apology and without censorship? Let's hope!",1219968000,33,1872,5.482638888888889
