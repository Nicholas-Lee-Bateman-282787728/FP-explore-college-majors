8691810,5,B00QKV579W,"I love the Ju-On franchise and this didn't fail. My only complaints are...The mother ghost doesn't make an appearance till towards the end of the movie and to me I think was the most scary part of the movie. There was way too much of the ghost boy that just stood there and not making his cat growl that we're used to. To me that was also scary to see him doing that cat growl when he appeared. I'm sure they felt ""we don't want to keep repeating itself"", but when it's the norm in a franchise, I'm expecting it especially when I felt it added to the scare factor. Other than that I still love Ju-On and this one was a treat to watch.",1421020800,,634,4.08
