5676777,5,B00BUWD7H0,I purchased this set for my daughter so we could watch BabyFirst on vacation. She loved all the DVDs!,1416182400,,101,4.368421052631579

5676779,4,B00BUWD7H0,"My daughter has loved babyfirst since she was learning to sit up. She is 2 1/2 now, and we recently dropped cable. I bought the box set to have on a 3 hour flight, I wanted to surprise her but she found them! Having these on hand have been great for her, especially during a night terror, they bring her back to ""center"". The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it's missing some of her favorites (VocabuLarry, Notekins, Bonnie Bear, Rainbow Horse, & Peekaboo).

However, beggars can't be choosers and she is happy just to have her babyfirst back :)",1397865600,4,558,4.41747572815534
5676780,3,B00BUWD7H0,There is not very much content with the whole box set and the quality seems cheap. I do not really care for it but it did not cost very much.,1397692800,,141,3.7333333333333334

5676784,5,B00BUWD7H0,"Our one year old son loves Baby First TV at home and when we purchased a vehicle with a DVD player we found that this was the perfect entertainment for rides in the car. We originally tried a few other children's cartoons and movies that we already had, but they don't seem to hold his attention the way the Baby First shows do. There is a great variety of shows in this set to keep your little one entertained!",1378771200,6,411,4.215189873417722

5676804,3,B00BUWD7H0,"My boys love babyfirsttv but we no longer have the station, so i was glad to find these!! Two of these dvds are great, the baby class and the best of baby first dvds, my kids love those two. The other two, they couldn't be less interested in. It should be noted that the Harry the bunny dvd is pure Harry the bunny for two hours, and the same goes for the numbers around the globe dvd, two straight hours of it. That's not much variety and my kids get bored with those real quick. We didn't even bother keeping those two. Just fyi, right now anyway, u can purchase the two good dvds separately for like $5 a piece if u just search for them here on amazon.",1423008000,4,655,4.0852713178294575
