8129949,3,B000GAKHKW,"Damiana y Los Hombres(1967, Damiana and the Men) is a rags to riches soap opera. Most of the reviews that I found for the movie are not good. They claim the film is ""mediocre"". This film is worth a look. There is some minor nudity as Carreno takes a shower! She looks very sexy as she dances to music that sounds like...Canned Heat? Mercedes Carreno played Damiana, a poor girl who has to choose between a career as a supermodel or life with a guy she loves. Enrique Rocha, Andres Soler, Jaime Fernandez, Lucia Guilmain and Alicia Montoya co-star. Julio Bracho directs and Carreno co-wrote the script. Damiana y Los Hombres has high production values, catchy music, and sexy women. It's a lot better than Mexican Z grade movies from the 1980's and 1990's.",1363564800,,755,4.641791044776119
