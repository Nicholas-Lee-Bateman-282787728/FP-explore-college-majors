8655732,5,B00K3VYMSM,"This is the perfect gift for a toddler who loves dinosaur train. The DVD has a few fun holiday style episodes, and the buddy figurine is perfect to carry around for a toddler. I wish the box was not so large, it does not look like 1 DVD and character, and my son was sad there was not more in such a large box. As a parent, I think it was perfect, and a perfect gift idea.",1503100800,,372,3.844155844155844
