8653673,5,B00JS3H5XK,"My grandchildren (age 5 and 6) are learning Russian and Spanish in addition to English (their first language) and they love watching Little Sponges DVDs! They remembered and were able to say many words even after watching it only one time. We watch the movie at home and in the car and the more they see it the more they learn. There are many useful words and phrases in the movie that the kids can use in everyday life. One puppet speaks English and the other puppet speaks (Russian or Spanish depending on which DVD you get) so the kids know the meaning of each word (vs. other DVDs that only give you the word in foreign language without any translation). I've enjoyed watching these movies myself as they have beautiful
videos and music and I learned many new words. Very effective for kids and adults! My friend who leaves in Russia just bought Russian/English version for her daughter to help her learn English.",1414627200,,917,4.597560975609756
