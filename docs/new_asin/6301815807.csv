371758,5,6301815807,"I would like to poinnt out that the musical score on the DVD is by Shostakovich, but although he was one of the great film composers, with over 30 scores to his credit, he did not write one for  ""Potemkin"".  The score you hear on the DVD was adapted from his  symphonies, mainly nos. 5 & 11. (The latter, subtitled ""The Year  1905"" is particularly appropriate for this film.)  Needless to say,  this score works stupendously well for this most musically-constructed of  all silent films.  Though the visuals show their age somewhat, with faces  sometimes obscured in darker scenes, this DVD is an essential acquisition  for any film buff.",938390400,9,638,4.770642201834862
371759,4,6301815807,"The notoriously dated aspects of silent cinema (maudlin storylines, theatrical acting, silly makeup, tinny music, intrusive dialogue cards, abysmally slow pace, etc.) that make sitting through them a trying  experience for today's audience are nowhere in sight in this rightly  acclaimed milestone in cinema history. Legendary Russian director Sergei  Eisenstein here pioneered his innovative use of ""montage""--a  method of storytelling through the juxtaposition of expressive images--that  every director since has owed their cinematic expression to (and that  possibly none have surpassed). Orson Welles, David Lean, Stanley Kubrick,  all named this film among their top ten. In fact, it's revolutionary ideas  trancended language barriers, and in the '20's became a hit in cinemas  around the world, including the U.S. The brilliant Eisenstein had created a  ""universal language"" through which his ideals could be conveyed  to all. That his ideals were nothing less than Communist propaganda cannot  tarnish the genius of his grasp of cinematic grammar. His striking use of  image and rapid cutting to tell the (partly fictitious) story nearly render  the dialogue cards redundant; narrative velocity is relentless; every  character portrait is convincing and touching; riveting suspense and  atmosphere is summoned beautifully; it's photography was recently named by  ""American Cinematographer"" as one of the screen's 25 finest ever;  and finally, the Shostakovitch score (written sometime after it's release)  is fittingly nationalistic and epic in scope. That film students speak of  ""gleaming nuggets of montage"" from it's superlative framework  (such as the magnificent ""Odessa Steps"" sequence) really do the  film injustice; for surely ""Potemkin's"" greatest triumph is the  tremendously successful union of it's many excellent parts (an achievement  that ""Citizen Kane"" does not attain, among others). For any film  fan interested in either silent cinema, or just cinematic art, this is one  those handful that are required viewing! P.S.: For the best of  ""montage"" in sound pictures, see David Lean's ""Oliver  Twist""; particularly Nancy's murder, and the scenes bordering it.

Eisenstein's direction remains justly famous, including such devices as the fading-in of moving characters, and the 'Odessa Steps' sequence whose montage is part of every intro-to-film course even today.  I, too, think it a pity that the organ music is so wall-to-wall (which wasn't always the case, even in the heyday of silent movies), but that's a minor gripe in such a classic film with cleaned-up visuals at such a good price.",1498780800,,662,5.12037037037037

371847,5,6301815807,"It seems odd to criticize the soundtrack for a silent film.  But, nonetheless, the only complaint I can make is the occasional cutting out from the music score which becomes tedious the more times it happens.  After a time I was so distracted worrying about when the music would be clipped that I lost concentration on the film.  This is a major concern with a silent film's dependence on visual over sound.  Even with that said, however, the quality of the film and remastering is so well done that they outweigh the soundtrack issues.  This is a must-see film for all movie lovers.  Even if you are one who finds silent films difficult to watch, I think you will find this one difficult to turn off.  The story is a mix of legend, history, and propaganda but the film's strengths are not in the reliable historical details.  Some would say it is a true reflection of the beliefs and values of the people in that place and time (early 20th century Soviet Union) more than a reflection of history.  But is not history, at least in part, the sum of the beliefs and values of a particular people at a particular time?  At the very least, it is impossible to understand historical events fully without the context of the beliefs and values of the people during that time.

Sergei Eisenstein's BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN portrays an early event of the people's uprising of 1905-- an incident aboard a Tsarist battleship that turned deadly.

The ship's crew hung out several rotting sides of beef that had just been delivered as a way of protest, saying they wouldn't eat this wormy stuff anymore. When the medical officer examined the meat, he saw it was crawling but still said: ""Those aren't worms... they're only maggots. Just wash them off with brine; the meat's perfectly fine.""

The foul meat was prepared as soup, but none of the enlisted men would eat it. Soon after, everyone was assembled on deck. The second officer in command said: ""All who ate soup, step forward."" Only ship's officers did so. The angry 2nd officer said he'd hang everyone else from the yardarm. Then he called for a firing squad of Marines. A tarpaulin was thrown over a large group of sailors standing on the quarterdeck, in preparation for execution.

One sailor who was further back rallied the other men. He stood on a bulkhead, pleading with the Marines to not kill their brothers. They lowered their weapons. This is when things got chaotic-- it was mutiny on a grand scale. During the struggle, the man who ignited the violence with his plea of mercy was shot dead by the 2nd officer, who was immediately tossed overboard, along with the captain, medical officer and 4 others.

The body of the hero of the uprising was laid in a tent on the Odessa docks, with a sign on his chest saying: ""Killed because of soup."" Crowds came to visit this makeshift shrine, and a protest was organized, that is, until dismounted cossacks arrived and began firing indiscriminately on the people. Women and children were shot down. It was a slaughter.

Later, civilians resupplied the Potemkin with food, and they cast off, with two fleets in close pursuit. You'll have to see the movie to find out the boat and crew's fate.",1419206400,,2237,4.797402597402598

They wanted conformity and not rebellion. The U.S. had their share of propaganda films in WWII, but a lot of it tends toward the sentimental - patriotism, motherhood, protect the home front, etc. This film addresses the abuse of individuals by the entrenched system & their rebellion against it and there is nothing sentimental about it.

372171,5,6301815807,"The film The Battleship Potemkin is one of the best films of all time or at least that is what I've read and have been told. My world history teacher highly recommended it for its historic value as a propaganda film, and just for being a great film. I've read some articles on the film, and have been meaning to see this film along with Metropolis for years. I kept putting it off or forgetting about the films. Finally I found both by accident on Netflix, and watched both. Metropolis was not a very good film. It was too straight forward or simplistic for me though you can easily see where it drew inspiration from with biblical story of Babel, and even with age and the special effects not nearly being what they are now the futuristic city they produced was impressive. Still I came out of the film simply bored. The Battleship Potemkin on the other hand is a great film and one of the best films of all time.

First and foremost this is a propaganda film directed and written by Sergei Eisenstein and released in 1925. It is based on the actual mutiny of the obviously named battleship Potemkin in 1905. The mutiny was heavily influenced by Russia losing war to Japan. They had sent most of their experienced officers to the Pacific to fight the Japanese leaving in experience men and officers behind in the Russian fleets of the Black Sea, and after the news of the devastating defeat of the Russian fleet by the Japanese moral sunk really low. It didn't help things that the meat the sailors were getting was rotten. Things sparked when I believe the second in command officer brought the men on to deck to punish them. Whether he planned on executing the men who complained or not who knows, but the men thought that was going to happen and rose up killing many of the officers and arresting the rest. A few other ships join the Potemkin outside Odessa, but isn't successful and eventually the Potemkin is forced to surrender to the Russian navy. I could go more detail because it is interesting, but if you want to learn more you can very easily look it up online. For the purpose of this review it's enough. The uprising had little to do with socialism or communism. It had more to do with moral, working conditions and the treatment the men got. Many people have the misconception the majority of Russians wanted revolution or a so sort of socialist government. Sure they didn't like the Russian Tsar and the oppressive government, but all they really wanted were better working conditions and wages and the people had very little or almost nothing to do with the Russian revolution of 1917. It was all Lenin basically ceasing power for himself even betraying his fellow socialists who wanted some sort of democratic socialist government. That is what makes this film so good. The communist government did a great job with this film. It portrayed the mutiny of Potemkin very accurately, just adding socialist influence. Oh and also managed to bash Christianity and religion along the way. In Odessa they stretched the truth here. There was some sort of uprising, but was it as massive as the film portrays who knows if. Also the famous scene on the steps that lead down to the dock didn't happen. The massacre of the citizens by the Russian army happened somewhere else, and the extent of the killing is debated. Did the army kill unarmed civilians yes, but no one knows the total number killed. The film ends with the single battleship Potemkin facing off with an entire squadron or a fleet of Russian ships, and then miraculously all the ships raise the red flag and the sailors cheer for joy and the film comes to an end.

This film is a great propaganda film just not the way I think Eisenstein intended. You would think seeing the people being treated badly by the evil Russian Empire and the upper-class while praising the hard work and corporation and unity of the people would be affective, but it wasn't as affective in Russia as I'm sure Eisenstein and the Russian government would have hoped, and they certainly made their feelings for religion and the Jews clear. Did the film help convert the Russian people to communism no. As I said they people just wanted food, better working wages and a better way of life. I'm sure many did think they could get that from the Lenin and the communist government. Anything was better than the Tsar. From what I can tell the film had a greater influence outside of Russian with American for other reasons than the theme of the film, and in particular the Joseph Goebbels and the Nazi party. I have no doubt he used the film for influence for his own propaganda in Germany and of course we all know where that leads.

I think the bigger impact the film had was in film making its self. From what I've read it was the most violent or one of the most violent films of its time. I have hardly seen any films from the 1920's to compare it to, but from what I seen and the films from the 1930's it was a very violent film for its time. I believe it got banned in many countries including France and England for both it's violence and communist message. For some reason it wasn't banned in the United States, and people were able to view the film and brought its influence to Hollywood. One of those influences was editing which from what I read the first time it was done in a way to influence the audience to get the biggest emotional impact. Of course I didn't need to read to see the huge influence the scene on the steps with the baby carriage had on Hollywood. The really good film The Untouchables used the scene as a big influence for one of their best scenes in its film. The iconic scene was used by others. I know it was used such great films as The Godfather, Brazil and many others.

The Battleship Potemkin is a one of the best films ever for many reasons. Its riveting story that is compelling. Then there is the historic reason. The film is pretty historically accurate. Does Eisenstein take some leeway with history yes with the socialist movement, the events in Odessa and on the battleship yes, but these are little things. It did happen and much of what happens in the film actually happened. It was a very interesting time in Russia. Next is the propaganda part of the film. I've seen quite a few old propaganda films mainly from Nazi Germany and I know some in the United States say many of the films that come out and are military oriented are nothing, but propaganda films, but they don't hold a candle to this film. Again for history reasons this is a great film. Finally there is the influence the film had its self on Hollywood with editing and influencing directors and writers for decades to come. There are certain films that any true film lover has to see. There is Seven Samurai, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Casablanca, Rashomon, Lawrence of Arabia, Citizen Kane, Schindler's List, Paths of Glory, All Quiet on the Western Front and Battleship Potemkin. There are some I haven't seen like The Birth of a Nation, Nosferatu and Triumph of the Will to name a few, but if you are a true film lover you need to see the films I've listed above. I highly recommend The Battleship Potemkin whether you're a historian buff, a film buff or just enjoy great films. You won't be disappointed with one of the best films of all time.",1356307200,,7300,4.5238455715367145
372172,4,6301815807,"This silent film is a re-enactment of a rebellion of the crew against their oppressive officers in June, 1905 - during the Russian Revolution of 1905, an initial step towards the Russian Revolution of 1917. The Potemkin battleship was stationed in the Black Sea, and manned primarily by new recruits and less capable officers - the most experienced had been transferred to the war zone in the Pacific.

The uprising was fueled by bad meat - the crew refused to eat meat containing maggots, despite the ship's doctor declaring it fit to eat. The captain mustered the crew to the rear of the ship, covered those refusing to eat the meat with a tarpaulin, and ordered the marines to shoot them. The marines refused and the men rushed the officers - killing seven of the ship's eighteen officers, including the captain and ship's doctor.

The subsequent funeral of the rebellion's leader in Odessa turned into a political demonstration, and clashes between them and troops in the city. 'The Odessa Staircase' comprises a major episode in the film and is its most famous scene - the Tsar's soldiers march down a flight of steps in machine-like fashion, firing volleys into the crowd while a detachment of mounted Cossacks charges the crowd at the bottom of the stairs. The last portion of the film covers the confrontation between the Potempkin and other neary ships sent by the Admiralty to capture or sink it - the Potempkin sails through the fleet as their fellow sailors refuse to fire on it.

372205,5,6301815807,"The Kino Restoration of Sergei Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin is probably the most satisfactory of any yet attempted. Potemkin was premiered on Jan 1, 1926 at the Bolshoi Theater. The director was 27 at the time. It concerns his account of a historic revolt by sailors of the Tsar's Navy in 1905. The revolt began as an outcry against oppression by superior officers and took on more significance when the revolting sailors after seizing control of the ship rose in revolt against an oppressive State. The Soviets initially showed the movie as a propaganda film but its meaning as envisioned by Eisenstein goes much deeper, being an outcry against all oppression by the State as well as denial of basic rights.

The history of the film is complex but it has become universally regarded as one of the greatest films ever make. Early prints were sent to Germany and the film was subjected to frequent editing and censorship. In the last 30 years or so attempts were made to realize the film as Eisenstein envisioned. Under the leadership of Enno Patalas and groups in Germany, Russia and Great Britain the Kino Restoration was first shown in 1905. It also contains a new recording in 5.1 Stereo Surround sound of Edmund Meisel's original film score. The restored version also contains 1,374 shots missing from earlier versions along with all of Eisenstein's 146 shots of text which were restored too.

The Kino Restoration is on two discs which includes supplemental material including a 42 minute documentary on the making and restoration of the film. The set also includes a booklet about the movie by Bruce Bennett.

I do not know how such amazing restoration can be accomplished, but the visual quality/clarity of the picture in this bluray is beyond words.  The complete Metropolis bluray (about which much has been written already) pales by comparison.

Seen with modern eyes much of the movie is a bit clunky and heavy with propaganda (it may have even seemed heavy with propaganda then) but it had tremendous influence on the way films were made, contributed a great deal to the vocabulary of cinema, and there are segments which are affecting and still stirringly effective nearly a century later.

372214,4,6301815807,"Visually, I thought that the film Battleship Potemkin was very interesting. It seemed as though a graphic artist had designed every shot. The shots were very layered, with lots of objects and people woven together in the same space. One shot in particular showed all of the crewmen lying down in their hammocks. There were feet propped up and bodies everywhere which create a very interesting picture to look at. Eisenstein used much of the machinery of the ship to add dimension and texture to the shots and I think this contributed so much to the film. If I were judging solely on the visual elements of the film, I would say that Battleship Potemkin was a very exciting and artistically profound film. However, I since I am not judging solely on the appearance of the film, I feel as though it should be said that the overall plot of the movie did not interest me. I did not seem to care about the men on the ship, although the movie revolved around them. The scenes of havoc in the city seemed long, drawn-out and pointless. I really did not like the scene with citizens getting hurt by the police, especially the children. I did not seem to connect with the people in the story. I think this is probably because of the fact that the story was largely propaganda. Being so far removed from this time and place, I felt that it was hard to relate to what was going on in the film. Though I did appreciate the overall textured style of the cinematography, the film was lacking for me. If not for the dimensionality portrayed by visual layering, I do not think I would have been interested in this movie at all. I would recommend this to people seeking to study the cinematography or to people interested in history.",1305072000,,1716,4.503205128205129

The picture is pure propaganda, but it is still extremely enjoyable. The plot involves a bunch of sailors on board the ship Potemkin revolting against their officers. The movie is surprisingly violent and the acting is hilariously over the top, but the pure technical skill of the editing is enough of a reason to watch.

372256,3,6301815807,"This 1925 silent film by Sergei Eisenstein is a masterpiece to say the least.  The film works around a series of five episodes. The most memorable episode is without question the protest of having to eat rotten meat. The way in which the camera revolves around the meat, the maggots, the faces are disturbing. Being a propaganda film, one cannot help but view this film with an emotional and stirring response. The plot and structure are rather simple, allowing easy understanding for the audience. This film needs to be in the category of art film, for there are countless memorable shots, angles, takes, and scenes that stay with the viewer. The film is shocking, to this day, which only highlights its worth when it was made in the early part of the 20th Century. Some memorable shots worth looking at again are the in-sync boots of the soldiers marching, the scary image of a baby falling down stairs, and the massive chaos on the ship with soldiers running about. These scenes work exceptionally well in Eisenstein's work in montage. I would recommend this film to any one, really. I think people who are interested in sci-fi and action films would really enjoy this film. Eisenstein's genius is captured in this film. This film gets great response from audiences. Eisenstein has such an impact on the film industry and this film cannot be missed. This film interprets and comments on the idea of revolution and the ugly side of revolution. Especially worth noting is the fact that this is a silent film and yet the ugly, disturbing, emotional, and thought provoking images don't need a single word. This is a masterpiece film.

372257,5,6301815807,"This is one of those films that you hear so much about so well in advance of actually seeing it that it almost inevitably disappoints.  For me, those films include GONE WITH THE WIND, MY DINNER WITH ANDRE and LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD, but not this one.  Despite many viewings of this film in substandard prints (Standard 8mm and Super 8mm with stretch printing-ugh!) and somewhat better video versions (up to this one Image had the best looking copy), the power of Eisenstein's images and his still-brilliant editing always got through, even if I somehow had the feeling that I wasn't watching his original vision.

With Kino's Blu-Ray version of BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN, I believe that Eisenstein would have been proud of how his film has been restored to what is as close to his 1925 vision as we will ever see (unless a pristine, uncut nitrate print or negative somehow surfaces).  The images are almost like looking through glass, the sharpness and clarity is right up there with Kino's Blu-Ray of THE GENERAL and the majority of METROPOLIS, and it is also an extremely entertaining film, as well.  True, it does wear its politics and idiology on its sleeve in neon, but for just a little over one hour you are in the hands of a master of cinema, and it has now been restored to its rightful place in the list of all-time great films-no doubt.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1001-Movies-You-Must-See-Before-You-Die-5th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/0764161512/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die: 5th Anniversary Edition</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eisenstein-The-Sound-Years-Ivan-the-Terrible-Parts-1-2-Alexander-Nevsky-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00004XQN5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eisenstein - The Sound Years (Ivan the Terrible Parts 1 & 2, Alexander Nevsky) - Criterion Collection</a>",1302480000,,1893,6.022304832713755
372258,4,6301815807,"When I heard that ""Battleship Potemkin"" was about to be released in a way that's as close as to the actual film premier together with the original film score as well I thought I'd take a risk just to find out what all the fuss was about and I am left mostly satisfied.  My previous experiences with Kino was through their silent-film dvds the quality of which left me pretty underwhelmed and so I was first off pleased to be surprised by just how good this the first Kino blu-ray release that I've ever seen is.  From the menu screen all the way to the packaging it is clear that Kino is trying to be a serious competitor to Criterion at least in the restoration and release of classic films.  The 8-page colour booklet was very informative and attractive and so is the slipcase.

Given the age and poorly preserved masters don't expect pristine picture quality because you are not going to get it.  Right near the beginning for example there is one jarring frame where a big white patch comes up right in the middle of a frame.  I suppose they did the best they could but scratches especially the vertical line variety abound on most frames among other assorted imperfections strewn throughout.  For me though these were obviously noticeable they were not overly detrimental to the overall enjoyment of the film but I have to say that 1080p does really bring black and white films to life.  I could see the lines on the faces and the hair on the hands of some of the sailors.  Can the picture quality be improved even more?  Possibly if a very expensive frame-by-frame clean up is done but until then this is probably the best picture quality of Potemkin that exists out there.

The score is also brilliant as if any film can be used as an example of how important the sound effects/score is to the success of a film bringing its story across ""Battleship Potemkin"" has to be it.  The music is powerful and how it heightens the suspense at the end or amplifies the brutality on the Odessa Steps has to be experienced to be fully understood and appreciated.  ""Battleship Potemkin"" has to be among the most ""eloquent"" silent films ever made; as a call-to-arms film it certainly does a very good job at it and even today it stirs the viewer to action.  The depictions of brutality both on board and especially on land are so vivid that you can't help but feel like to want to get up and do something.  Depicting events that occurred in 1905 it is sad that this film is still relevant today when you look at events in the Middle East and you feel that if you want to rouse the spirits of Libyan rebels just let them watch this film with Libyan intertitles and you'll get the desired effect.  I wonder what effect a screening of this film in North Korea would have?

This film has influenced countless future films and I could see some of the depictions of brutality on the ship being borrowed for Gable's ""The Mutiny on the Bounty"" and the baby pram on the Odessa Steps being borrowed for Costner's ""Untouchables"" for example.  I liked the fade ins and fade outs that show the crowds gathering on the steps as a way to speed up the action as well as the many facial close-ups of the sailors and the victims.  One scene on the ship where the officer addresses the sailor in the steam room the play with light and shadows reminded me a lot of what future directors like Kubrick and Wilder would take to the next level with regards this particular technique.  I'm very impressed with these old time directors who didn't have existing examples to work with or film schools to learn directing from and yet through their own brilliant minds were still able to tell such great stories so well with film.  Eisenstein, Lang, Keaton, Von Stroheim, Murnau, Chaplin, Merian C. Cooper, Willis O'Brien, De Mille et al my sincere respects and kudos go out to you!

Not perfect picture quality but as good as you are going to get for now, excellent 5.1 surround sound original score, excellent film makes this an easy recommendation.

372260,4,6301815807,"To be clear - this review is for the 1998 Image Entertainment release, listed at 66 minutes and featuring the music of Shostakovich rather than Edmund Meisel's original score.

'The Battleship Potemkin' and Sergei Eisenstein have been mentioned in nearly every list of great films and filmmakers that I've ever seen, and as someone interested in different aspects of film history who still hadn't seen it, I finally felt ready to close that gap in my knowledge of the medium.  I mention that expressly in case there is anyone else who may have felt like I did - for years I didn't expect to appreciate or have the patience to sit through 'Potemkin'.  What finally brought me around was the cheerleading of James Agee in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Agee-on-Film/dp/0399508708/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Agee on Film</a>.  Not because Agee was such a boisterous supporter of Chaplin and the early Eisenstein - he shared _that_ perspective with many other critics - but because what comes across to me more than anything was that Agee genuinely cared about filmmaking in all its aspects.  Since he was prepared to discuss the notable points in all films regardless of their 'status', (and slash phoniness to pieces), it lent even greater credence to those he felt deserved the much over-used title of masterpiece.

So what does one say about 'Potemkin' after critics and scholars have dissected it for eighty-five years already?  Designed to commemorate the aborted 1905 uprising twenty years after the fact, Eisenstein tells the story of the mutinous sailors on the battleship, and of the citizens of Odessa who stood with the sailors and suffered the wrath of the Tsar's troops because of it.  As a paean to the ideals of revolution, it was powerful enough at the time of its release to cause even Joseph Goebbels to remark that ""anyone who had no firm political conviction could become a Bolshevik after seeing the film"".  But what about today - does it still deserve the praise?

The short answer is yes.  The longer answer is yes and no.

I knew next to nothing about its actual details beforehand - I only knew of its mammoth reputation - and in hindsight I think it's best to see it that way.  Too many of the most influential scenes are parsed and discussed ad nauseam across the web - an actual, spontaneous reaction may be hard to come by.  I find it interesting that scenes that are supposed to affect me the most, according to everything I've since read, were only partially successful, and others - some rarely mentioned in the writings - had far more clout.  I had a very visceral reaction to its propagandistic nature though, but one opposite from what was intended.  The history of the 20th Century - and the way this one's shaping up (or not shaping up actually) - makes me deeply suspicious of groups of people who get worked up over idealistic principles.  In 'Potemkin', these people seem doubly pitiful - repressed and executed under orders from the Tsar, they are happy and excited to trade this in for what we know will be repression and execution under Stalinism.  Poor saps.  They never had a chance.

Another point:  While the emotional manipulation in the film may strike some modern viewers as corny and overplayed, it's important to remember that these same corny and overplayed techniques are in full effect today.  To prove my point, turn on any talk radio station.  If the commentator is talking about something that I agree with, he will sound subtle, nuanced, and common-sensical.  If I don't agree with him, he sounds like a ham-fisted, childish lunatic.  In the same way that I wonder how the intended audiences of 'Potemkin' could be affected by Eisenstein's seemingly obvious pressure, I also wonder how anyone can fall for today's swill.  Yet they do - propaganda is in the ear of the listener.

There are other elements that seem under-appreciated, or at least are not commented on as frequently - most notably the imagery of the Odessa harbor, the life aboard the ship, and the tense, pounding finale.  Taken together with the iconic scenes and the clinical example of propaganda, I do highly recommend 'Potemkin' to those who are interested in film as a medium, no matter what genre or period.  Those who are more interested in contemporary entertainment may not appreciate it as much, and the fact that it is silent, subtitled and in black and white - a dread triumvirate to many - will do as much to channel viewers away from or toward the film, according to their tastes, as any recommendation of mine.  In fact, it seems of no value at all to recommend it to those who are not likely to enjoy it anyway, so if you are in doubt, it's probably better to rent first.  While I enjoyed the film - enough to purchase it at some date - I can't say 'I loved it', as is suggested by five stars.  Yet in recognition of its tremendous impact on the film industry, four stars seems too low.  Four and a half - for the film.

This edition of it, on the other hand, is only four stars - perhaps less.  Since I haven't seen any of the other versions to compare, I'm limited in what I can say about them, but&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/this-Kino-edition/dp/B000V7HFL4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">this Kino edition</a>&nbsp;is listed at 70 minutes and full screen, whereas&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-blu-ray-edition/dp/B0036SPDEG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the blu-ray edition</a>&nbsp;is listed at 75 minutes, and both are supposedly new HD transfers.  These Kino releases also restore Edmund Meisel's music, although that's only specifically mentioned on the DVD release.  Wouldn't it be nice if the blu-ray carried alternate tracks and accommodated both scores?  Surely it couldn't be that hard to do with the blu-ray format.  Still, despite the soundtrack details, simply knowing Kino is involved in the newest releases makes them an obvious choice, especially since this Image Entertainment disc is probably lifted from the public domain and yet is comparable in price.  It is worthy enough in its own way though, as this library copy introduced me to this classic, and left me interested in a better presentation.

Sergei Eisenstein's BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN portrays an early event of the people's uprising of 1905-- an incident aboard a Tsarist battleship that turned deadly.

The ship's crew hung out several rotting sides of beef that had just been delivered as a way of protest, saying they wouldn't eat this wormy stuff anymore. When the medical officer examined the meat, he saw it was crawling but still said: ""Those aren't worms... they're only maggots. Just wash them off with brine; the meat's perfectly fine.""

The foul meat was prepared as soup that none of the enlisted men touched. Soon after, everyone was assembled on deck. The second officer in command said: ""All who ate soup, step forward."" Only ship's officers did so. The angry 2nd officer said he'd hang everyone else from the yardarm. Then he called for a firing squad of Marines. A tarpaulin was thrown over a large group of sailors standing on the quarterdeck, in preparation for execution.

One sailor who was further back rallied the other men. He stood on a bulkhead, pleading with the Marines to not kill their brothers. They lowered their weapons. This is when things got chaotic-- mutiny on a grand scale. During the struggle, the man who ignited the violence with his plea of mercy was gunned down by the 2nd officer, who in response got immediately tossed overboard along with the captain, medical officer and 4 others.

The hero of the uprising's body was laid in a tent on the Odessa docks. A sign on his chest read: ""Killed because of soup."" Crowds came to visit this makeshift shrine and a protest was organized, that is, until dismounted cossacks arrived and began firing indiscriminately on the people. Women and children were shot down. It was a slaughter.

Later, civilians resupplied the Potemkin with food and they cast off, with two fleets in close pursuit. You'll have to see the movie to find out the boat and crew's fate.",1290297600,,2164,4.88283378746594

372264,5,6301815807,"The great Russian director Sergei Eisenstein, known for films such as the 1938 ""Alexander Nevsky"" and the 1944-1946 films ""Ivan the Terrible"", but if there was one movie that the filmmaker will be remembered for is his 1925 masterpiece ""The Battleship Potemkin"".  A film based on the true story of the sailors of the Battleship Potemkin that rebelled against the officers of the Tsarist regime.

When Eisenstein created ""Potemkin"", his goal was to create a revolutionary propaganda film and in the process, the film would inspire many filmmakers at that time, including other silent film stars such as Douglas Fairbanks Jr. who absolutely loved the film and started screening the film to fellow friends in hope for distribution in the US.

Back in 1925, the film received a standing ovation in Russia and was no doubt a major success during its Bolshoi premiere in Moscow.  But its public premiere, like many other silent film masterpieces such as ""Sunrise"" and ""Metropolis"" received a less enthusiastic response. But as the film made its round to the US, despite seeing a censored version of the film, ""Battleship Potemkin"" was very daring for its use of violence in the film.  For Eisenstein and fellow Soviet filmmakers, the test for the director was the use of film editing to create an emotional response for the viewers.

And as the film made its round to other countries, having been edited in Germany, the film that was shown in 1925 was now a more politically correct film that would feature less on the violence and more of the story but unfortunately over the years, the film would be tampered with in order to fit music, frames were stretched and cut and with too much editing, by the time people wanted to celebrate Eisenstein's masterpiece, no one knew how the original film was supposed to be, the original film was considered lost and footage cut was never restored.  Even when the repeatedly cut negative was returned to the USSR in the '40s, the reprint was further edited, stretched and retitled.

In fact, the film would have a chance to receive another for restoration in the 1970's by Eisenstein scholar Naum Kleinman who tried to restore it using negative and other print materials but having had to work with the stretched film of the '40s, he had to make do with what he had.

Eighty years later, Enno Patalas who worked at the Munic Filmmuseum made an attempt to reassemble the film from prints held by MoMA and the British Film Institute and in 2005, the definitive restoration of ""Battleship Potemkin"" was created and in 2010, the Blu-ray release of Eisenstein's masterpiece showcases all the hardwork that went into the restoration.  The new version includes 1,374 shots that were cut from the German 1926 censored version and with this Blu-ray release features the most comprehensive, complete and accurate re-ordering, rendering and replacing of Potemkin's groundbreaking stylized titles since its premiere in 1925.

The new Blu-ray release will also feature the performance of Edmund Meisel's score (performed by the Deutsches Filmorchestra) which was meticulously researched and arranged by composer and conductor Helmut Imig.

VIDEO:

""Battleship Potemkin"" is presented in its original B&W (1:33:1) presentation.  There is color in one scene which the original films did have and that is the raising of the Potemkin flag which was red.  Picture quality for the Blu-ray release of Potemkin looks absolutely awesome.  For a film over 80-years-old, despite having its fair share of scratches and lines, the print is still in very good condition considering how much editing the film had undergone.  The restored sequences work seamlessly and to bring back the intertitles as close as they can to the original also looks very good (especially for the process in making it seem as it was part of the original negative).

But the cinematography for the film is wonderful.  From the people paying their respects to Vakulinchuk and then the massacre in Odessa is just amazing to watch.  And the fact that this generation is able to watch something that many people haven't seen (since a variety of scenes featuring the massacre in Odessa and the fight on Potemkin was heavily edited) within the last 80+ years is quite impressive.  Blacks are nice and dark and the contrast for the film is very good.

Sure ""Battleship Potemkin"" on Blu-ray is not exactly pristine but silent films are rarely pristine to begin with.  If you can find a print that looks fantastic, then you literally found a goldmine and in this case, this restoration of ""Battleship Potemkin"" is fantastic (especially if you compared to previous video and public domain releases).

AUDIO & INTERTITLES:

""Battleship Potemkin features a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack by the Deutsches Filmorchestra based on the 1926 Edmun Meisel score.  The music is absolutely awesome.  I love the orchestral music as it gave us a sense of emotion when it came to the soldiers, the battleships, the massacre in Odessa and more.  The music speaks volumes for Potemkin and the fact that they kept a score that remained true to what Eisenstein had envisioned is fantastic.

It is important to note that there are two versions of the film.  One featuring the newly-translated English intertitles and the other with the original Russian intertitles (and optional English subtitles).

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Battleship Potemkin"" comes with the following special features:

  * Tracing the Battleship Potemkin - (42:20) A documentary on the making and restoration of ""Battleship Potemkin"".

EXTRAS:

""Battleship Potemkin"" comes with a cardboard slipcase.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Battleship Potemkin"" is a Blu-ray release that a cineaste must have in their collection!

Once again, KINO brings to us a silent film that looks absolutely gorgeous on Blu-ray and a musical score that sounds absolutely marvelous in HD.

The cinematography is absolutely fantastic.  From a scene overlooking the city as hundreds of people walk to see the corpse of a fallen sailor, to hundreds people running down from the steps of Odessa and seeing them in panic.  I often wonder how many takes it took to create those scenes.  Eisenstein was a master of utilizing the entire screen.

This film is quite important as many have viewed Eisenstein's work as one of the kings of filmmaking who was able to transition from silent films to sound and continue to produce epic work.  He was truly a genius when it came to filmmaking and just by watching his masterpiece ""Battleship Potemkin"", his grasp of meticulous editing and making sure each scene is not wasted and that each scene is deserving of an emotional response is what remains clear of Eisenstein's oeuvre.

I wish I can describe to you (for those who haven't seen the film) of what takes place during the Odessa scene but I'm not going to bother explaining it, this film has to be seen and you will be impressed by the images and how ambitious it was to create that amount of chaos.

I don't think we will ever know how much work went on for the creation of this film, let alone how much went into creating each shot since this film was hacked and edited and only until 2005 would we get a true restoration that possibly Eisenstein would have been happy about.

We do know how much this film has changed each time it has exchanged hands under German censors and also in the US.  So, many people post 1926 who have wanted to see the original Eisenstein film have seen various versions through video and public domain releases but it's that 2005 restoration that is the definitive version to see.  And that is what is featured on this Blu-ray release in gorgeous HD glory and if you have seen this on video or via public domain, the video quality of those films were absolutely muddy or lack of contrast compared to how it looks on Blu-ray.  This release is absolutely fantastic and the lossless musical soundtrack is equally remarkable.

Now, would I have liked more choices for music, sure.  Would I have wanted more special features included with this Blu-ray release?  Of course.  But considering how difficult it has been to get a true version of ""Battleship Potemkin"" out to the masses in the last 80-years, if this is all there is, then I am content.

""Battleship Potemkin"" is a true masterpiece that deserves to be owned by the cineaste. It deserves to be seen on Blu-ray and it embodies the true essence of cinema.  A wonderful silent film that will continue to impress today's generation and future generations to come and is highly recommended!",1279238400,4,8813,4.907557354925776

An incredibly well-shot film whose lack of characterization proves an asset not a detriment as Eisenstein creates  collective protagonists and antagonists in telling the story of the 1905 Revolution with an eye towards 1917; Battleship Potemkin (the consensus best film ever made until Citizen Kane took the crown) is a film you must watch if interested in film history but a film that should appeal to laymen as well.

372385,5,6301815807,"Based on actual events of 1905, silent film THE BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN concerns an Imperial Russian ship on which abominable conditions lead to a mutiny. Shocked by conditions on the ship, citizens of the port city Odessa rally to the mutineers' support--and in consequence find themselves at the mercy of Imperial forces, who attack the civilian supporters with savage force.

POTEMKIN is a film in which individual characters are much less important than the groups and crowds of which they are members, and it achieves its incredible power by showing the clash of the groups and crowds in a series of extraordinarily visualized and edited sequences. Amazingly, each of these sequences manage to top the previous one, and the film actually builds in power as it moves from the mutiny to the citizen's rally to the massacre on the Odessa steps--the latter of which is among the most famous sequences in all of film history. Filming largely where the real events actually occurred, director Eisenstein's vision is extraordinary as he builds--not only from sequence to sequence but from moment to moment within each sequence--some of the most memorable images ever committed to film.

To describe POTEMKIN as a great film is something of an understatement. It is an absolute essential, an absolute necessity to any one seriously interested in cinema as an art form, purely visual cinema at its most brilliant, often imitated, seldom equaled, never bested.",1213488000,,1451,5.1440677966101696

372387,5,6301815807,"Sergei Eisenstein's BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN portrays an early event of the people's uprising of 1905-- an incident aboard a Tsarist battleship that turned deadly.

The ship's crew hung out several rotting sides of beef that had just been delivered as a way of protest, saying they wouldn't eat this wormy stuff anymore. When the medical officer examined the meat, he saw it was crawling but still said: ""Those aren't worms... they're only maggots. Just wash them off with brine; the meat's perfectly fine.""

The foul meat was prepared as soup, but none of the enlisted men would eat it. Soon after, everyone was assembled on deck. The second officer in command said: ""All who ate soup, step forward."" Only ship's officers did so. The angry 2nd officer said he'd hang everyone else from the yardarm. Then he called for a firing squad of Marines. A tarpaulin was thrown over a large group of sailors standing on the quarterdeck, in preparation for execution.

One sailor who was further back rallied the other men. He stood on a bulkhead, pleading with the Marines to not kill their brothers. They lowered their weapons. This is when things got chaotic-- it was mutiny on a grand scale. During the struggle, the man who ignited the violence with his plea of mercy was shot dead by the 2nd officer, who was immediately tossed overboard, along with the captain, medical officer and 4 others.

The body of the hero of the uprising was laid in a tent on the Odessa docks, with a sign on his chest saying: ""Killed because of soup."" Crowds came to visit this makeshift shrine, and a protest was organized, that is, until dismounted cossacks arrived and began firing indiscriminately on the people. Women and children were shot down. It was a slaughter.

Later, civilians resupplied the Potemkin with food, and they cast off, with two fleets in close pursuit. You'll have to see the movie to find out the boat and crew's fate.

The VHS tape of BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN (issued by KULTUR) is from the 1976 Soviet restoration. Video quality is superb and projection speed  accurate; soundtrack is by Shostakovich. Manufacturer's running time is listed as 74 minutes.",1212796800,,2146,4.8469945355191255

372389,5,6301815807,"I just watched the ""History of Cinema"" edition with the documentary on Eisenstein. It was quite watchable and moving.

It drives me crazy the way films get chopped up and then marketed with no details about the mutilation and it takes lot of work to even hope to know what you should buy. There otta be a law. Truth in advertising, proper labeling or something like that. I could not figure out before buying if this Potemkin is really the best restored etc. or not.

But I will say to help those who get as confused about versions as I do that this one was visually clear enough and the effects worked without distraction and the overall effect was still quite  moving. The titles say music by Shastakovich. It is a bit choppy but I felt it added a lot to the power of the film. It is said that no sound track is authentic, because it was originally accompanied by piano. But in any event I liked this one a lot. I have seen and heard a lot more ""scratchy"" silent prints.

The film as a work of art? Of course it is great and can be still quite moving as has surely been said ad infinitum.

The print of the ""rare documentary"" bonus is a bit faded and antique, but the narrator can be heard clearly and it works for me. I learned a lot and am glad to have this artifact from the past.

372390,4,6301815807,"Serge Eisenstein is heralded as a master of the silent film. His use of the montage has become a trademark and is common piece of modern cinema. In this his most famous work, the montage is used to great effect in several scenes, namely the famous Odessa Steps sequence. Battleship Potemkin is the story of disgruntled soldiers on a battleship who, when forced to eat rotten meat and obey ruthless officers, decide to mutiny. Their leader is killed in the process and becomes a martyr for the cause of the oppressed individual who can, when joined by others, can rise against tyranny. A highly political film, the issues addressed here foreshadow coming events in the history of the Soviet Union.

Newcomers to this film might be put off by its reputation. Do not assume that just because it is considered to be artistic and important that it is boring. Part of its importance is the editing, but that also makes the movie tense and emotional. The cast is mainly men, but their strength does not make them any less relatable. The Odessa Steps scene is a whirlwind of emotion and will leave the viewer shocked. The overall message of the film speaks volumes about society, even if time has shown that the suggested solution of communism does not work. A timeless masterpiece, Battleship Potemkin will not disappoint.",1201737600,4,1315,4.79295154185022

372392,3,6301815807,"Sergei Eisenstein's landmark film, from 1925, alerted western audiences that something important was happening in the Soviet Union in terms of filmmaking (Lenin: ""Cinema to us is the most important art""). The film itself deals with the 1905 uprising of the battleship of the title, how the crew of the ship rebelled against the czarist officers when they were asked to eat rotten meat, how after the mutiny the ship landed in the port of Odessa in the Black Sea (receiving the support of the population), and how the rebellion was suppressed by troops loyal to the regime. To achieve its effects, he film used the then new technique of rapid cutting. Elected in a film congress in 1959 as the best film ever, and still considered a classic, it hasn't aged that well. There is the famous scene of the repression at the Odessa steps, which have been repeated so many times in TV, that are famous to even those who hadn't seen the movie. Whatever its failings, every film buff should see this movie at least once. Personally, I think Eisenstein made better movies, for example, ""Alexander Nevsky"" or ""Ivan the Terrible"". It is unfortunately true that cinema ages much faster than other forms of art. For example, one can read a novel written in the 1930s without much problems, yet most movies made in that decade look terribly dated now (I think many movies made in the 60s and 70s look dated). This has to do with cinema being an art supported by technology, and technology can get outdated quickly, of course. But there must be something else that I'm not able to define that make movies age so quickly.",1201392000,4,1603,4.667844522968198
372393,4,6301815807,"It was a strange, surreal experience for me to watch this, as I'm very new to silent cinema having not seen any before, Lotte Reiniger's ""The Adventures of Prince Achmed"" (1926) and FW Murnau's ""Nosferatu"" (1922) aside. It took a while to get used to things like what, in my opion at least, were overexagerrated gestures (since there's no dialogue, theres no way of doing a one-liner) and the Russian title cards, but its' very relevant to many cinematic techniques. You have to watch the film very carefully.

Sergei Eisenstien tells the story of a real-life mutiny aboard the battleship Potemkin, with oppressed working class (in this case the enlisted sailors) who refuse to eat the horrible maggot-infested meat they are given. They band together to overthrow their oppressors (the ship's officers), led by proto-revolutionary Vakulinchuk. When he dies in the shipboard struggle, the crew lays his body to rest on the pier, a moody, moving scene where the citizens of Odessa slowly emerge from the fog to pay their respects. As the crowd grows Eisenstein turns the tenor from mourning a fallen comrade to celebrating the collective achievement. The government responds by sending soldiers and ships to deal with the mutinous crew and the supportive townspeople, which climaxes in the justly famous (and often imitated and parodied), for example in The Untouchables (1987) - Odessa Steps massacre.

As I said its not really my ""type"" of film, but I'm glad I saw it all the same. Reccommended for those interested in cinema.",1196380800,,1526,5.027667984189724

In my review of the old edition, I hoped that Kino Video or Criterion would restore the film and release a DVD that would do justice to Eisenstein's brilliant propaganda piece. Kino has stepped up to the challenge and done a remarkable job.

Picture: The picture quality is a vast improvement. Previous releases were blurry, low-resolution, and generally covered with dirt and scratches. The picture on Kino's release is crystal-clear, looking better than ever.

Sound: I suppose I should say ""music,"" but regardless, this is another vast improvement. The previous DVD release I mentioned replaced the original Edmund Meisel score with a tinny monstrosity by Shostakovich. Meisel's music has been rerecorded in beautiful stereo and re-synched to the film.

Special features: A making-of documentary covering the film and its restoration, as well as a photo gallery are both good and definitely interesting, but the major selling point on this DVD is the restored image and music.

Overall, I can say little more than that this is an outstanding treatment of a truly great film. If you've been disappointed in previous DVD releases of Potemkin or have been waiting for a good one, this is it.

Highly recommended.",1195344000,49,1297,5.1571428571428575
372445,5,6301815807,"It's hard to think of a more important silent film or any major work of world cinema that has taken as long to be issued in a definitive version than BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN. It took many years and the combined efforts of several different film archives to put POTEMKIN back together again but it has been worth the wait for now it is possible to finally see the most influential movie ever made the way it's creator Sergei Eisenstein intended.

Ever since the premiere at the Bolshoi Theatre in 1925, POTEMKIN has been subject to censorship in one form or another. Not only was the film cut but the original score by German composer Edmund Meisel was discarded after the film's initial run and this had a huge impact as we can now see and hear in this restoration. The images will always retain their power but they are doubly enhanced by Meisel's propulsive driving score which sounds like Shostakovich who was 19 at the time and must have been influenced by what he heard here. It's ironic that for the film's 50th anniversary (the version most readily available until now) the music of Shostakovich provided the background and the film was cut to fit the music. All of this is covered in the excellent documentary TRACING BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN that comes with this 2 DVD set.

As for the movie itself, it has never looked this good. Images are sharp and clear, the contrast of the black and white photography is excellent and the colorization of the raising of the red flag has been restored. Most important of all is the return of the edited material which changes the look and feel of certain scenes. The famous ""Odessa Steps"" sequence is longer, has different points of view, and is more violent than before. The recording of the original score is top notch and, as I said earlier, adds immeasureably to the total film experience. Overall this is a truly astonishing set and one no lover of film should be without.

My only complaint, and it's a minor one, is that I wish they had included the 1976 50th anniversary edition as the second disc (instead of the new version with Russian title cards) so that we could see the differences between the two and could note the changes made to bring BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN back to Eisenstein's vision.",1193097600,17,2240,4.651515151515151

That scene is captivating and a work of art.

372447,4,6301815807,"The Russian Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin, among others, once called the aborted Revolution of 1905 that stormed over Russia in the wake of the abject defeat in the Russo-Japanese War (the one that American President Teddy Roosevelt acted as peace broker for, in case the reader is unfamiliar) the dress rehearsal for the victorious October Revolution in 1917. With that thought in mind one can see a slice of that dress rehearsal reenacted in Serge Eisenstein's The Battleship Potemkin. Cinematically, Eisenstein demonstrates the old revolutionary adage about revolution occurring when the rulers cannot rule in the old way and the `people' refuse to be ruled in the old way. That is the paradox of the 1905 Revolution and of the crew. The outrage, particularly after the events of Bloody Sunday of January of that year set the stage but the haphazardness of the actions as shown by the fate of the Potemkin showed that the times were not fully ripened for revolutionary action. In the end the fate of the sailors on the Potemkin demonstrated that a mutiny, for after all that was what occurred, must be linked to forces outside the ship to be successful. The vanguard role of the Kronstatdt sailors of the Baltic Fleet in 1917 under Bolshevik influence bears witness to that hard won piece of wisdom.

As I have written in a review of another Eisenstein classic, October (Ten Days That Shook The World) he was the master of montage, stage direction and reenactment of historical scenes. That skill does not fail him here. The widely acclaimed scene from the Steps of Odessa bears eloquent witness to that ability. As was the case in October it shows here in the faces of the actors used to portray the various participants. One may criticize this work as being too didactic in its portrayal of the `good' and `bad' guys but my friends that is what this film is all about. It is a propaganda film made in the 1920's and reflects the state of the art and the state of working class politics. The sailors were not society's `beautiful' people. And that is exactly the point. The intent of the revolution was to turn that world upside down with the forces at hands, warts and all. That Eisenstein captured that feel in a silent film that is driven by sober classical Russian music played as background is a tribute to his work. His on and off again relationship with Stalin, while not irrelevant, does not negate its grandeur.",1190592000,5,2426,4.748815165876778

372449,5,6301815807,"The Battleship Potemkin uprising happened in June, 1905, when the ship's crew rebelled against their oppressive officers. It is usually regarded as one of the first leading events to the 1917 Russian Revolution.

This legendary film was produced in 1925 by Mosfilm, at the height of the silent cinema period and is, perhaps, the most famous example of the Soviet school of editing whose style and theories are deeply influential even today!

The film is divided in five episodes: ""Men and Maggots"" (showing the sailors revolting when forced to eat rotten meat), ""Drama at the Harbor"" (which shows the revolt being smashed and its leader killed), ""A Dead Man Calls for Justice"" (showing the people of Odessa crying the loss of the revolt's leader), ""The Odessa Staircase"" (showing the Army marching over the people - and killing them) and the final episode: ""Rendez-Vous with the Squadron"" which closes the film.

Now, the problem with BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN is that, being regarded as a masterpiece (like METROPOLIS, BIRTH OF A NATION, PANDORA'S BOX, INTOLERANCE and CABIRIA), it is also a work with a high degree of political content (like TRIUMPH OF THE WILL) and, like many of those films, it has been censored, cut, re-cut several times... until virtually none of the several circulating versions of it (most in public domain and lousy shape) meets the version made by Eisenstein.

Kino joined forces with the Deutsche Kinematek, the Russia's Goskinofilm, the British Film Institute, Bundesfilm Archive Berlin, and the Munich Film Museum in order to present this all new restoration. Shots have been replaced, and all 146 title cards restored to Eisenstein's specifications.

Edmund Meisel's definitive 1926 score, magnificently rendered by the 55-piece Deutches Filmorchestra in 5.1 Stereo Surround, returns Eisenstein's masterwork to a form as close to its creator's bold vision as has been seen since the film's 1925 Moscow premiere. In fact, a funny story goes that BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN opened in Moscow alongside ROBIN HOOD (the 1922 version with Douglas Fairbanks) and the Soviet government expected it would earn more money than the American film... representing the power and revitalization of Soviet cinema. It lost. (laughs) :p

372450,4,6301815807,"In the context of the 21st Century, the film ""Battleship Potemkin"" would undoubtedly fall flat, but given the available technology and the infancy of the medium when the film was produced, Sergei Eisenstein had indeed created an epic motion picture.
While the modern DVD incarnate features a less than remarkable transfer, the fact that it is available attests to its endurance even as a silent film.
Like most any film, it cannot capture the overall story of the 1905 Potemkin Mutiny, or the 1905 revolution.  If you have read one of the few books in English on the subject you will without a doubt be disappointed.  I would recommend following the film with the recent book ""Red Mutiny,"" by Neil Bascomb, this will put the film in greater context for historical purposes.
For film studies, ""Battleship Potemkin"" can be analyzed in the realm of other silent greats like ""The General,"" ""Metropolis"" and ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" among others.
Eisenstein's masterpiece ranks with the best international films of the day, but I prefer the simplicity of American silent films overall.

372451,4,6301815807,"My first (and until now only) encounter with this film was in a high school film studies elective I took. The teacher showed the scene of the massacre on the Odessa stairs, and the baby carriage, and then showed us clips from various other movies that had imitated it.

In the years since I've always been glad I knew that little piece of film trivia, because it does pop up every now and again, everywhere from the Naked Gun movies to the most recent Star Wars film.

And that one scene alone probably makes this movie worth watching, if for no other reason than to be able to catch the various references to it in other films, and then pat yourself on the back for what a cultured person you are.

As for the rest of the movie...
I'd love to say that it was actually really interesting once you get into it, but lets face it, this is a silent film made for a generation with longer attention spans and lower expectations. I'd be lying if I said there weren't any parts I yawned through. However once the action does get started, it is surprising intense, especially given how old this film is.

This movie is also one of the first examples of film propaganda, and so is interesting in that respect as well. Obviously as one of the first attempts it's not perfect, and hits you over the head a little bit too hard. (The art of good propaganda is not letting the audience realize they're being propagandized). My favorite is the over the top portrayal of the evil priest.

Then again, I can think of several Hollywood movies that lack subtlety. Maybe we only notice how ridiculous this movie is because it is old and because it's communist.

I suppose it's probably pointless to debate the moral qualities of this movie because it is now nothing more than an historical oddity. It is old, the techniques it employees are no longer effective on the modern audience, and the regime that created it no longer exists.

And yet, perhaps because of my protestant upbringing, I still have the urge to examine this film and classify it as either good or bad.

Obviously this film is tainted by its association with Stalin, but the actual events portrayed in the film (the failed 1905 Russian Revolution) are safely removed from the evils of the Bolshevik regime. Can a person with progressive politics watch this movie and simply appreciate the story about soldiers who refused to open fire on the people when ordered, and instead joined in a popular uprising? This is, after all, not only the story of the Russian Revolution, but Europe in 1848, Paris in 1871, and the German Revolution in 1918.

The various historical liberties the film takes makes it slightly harder to defend. Apparently there was no actual massacre on the Odessa steps, although there were a few demonstrators killed in scuffles with the army. And the circumstances of the Potemkin mutiny are also in debate.",1182124800,,2873,4.617647058823529

When he is killed during the violent skirmish that results, the citizens of port town Odessa join the struggle against the Czarist regime.

  Eisenstein's exhilarating, world-renowned masterpiece re-creates the ill-starred 1905 Russian Revolution that presaged the Bolshevik uprising twelve years later. Celebrated for its brilliant rapid-cut montage techniques, ""Potemkin"" is a rousing film of great emotional and symbolic richness whose visual sweep and driving energy were unparalleled at the time.

Sergei Eisenstein, skewing historical facts a tad chronicles the failed 1905 Russian Revolution which attempted to overthrow the yoke of Tsarism.  Tiring of oppressive rule and defeat at the hands of the Japanese in the Russo Japanese War, the proliteriat grew weary of the Tsarist regime.

News of a worker's revolution had spread to the beleaguered crew of the Potemkin.  Unhappy with the squalid conditions aboard tempers began to percolate as the men were being forced to consume spoiled maggot infested meat.  As a group they refused to eat a meal of soup and were threatened by Captain Golikov with hanging.  When he ordered a group of protesters shot by the armed guard aboard the ship a mutiny ensued.  During the violence that followed, ringleader sailor Vakulinchuk was killed.

The corpse of Vakulinchuk was brought ashore in Odessa were its was displayed in martyred fashion to the thongs of citizens of Odessa.  The sympathy of the massive crowds leaned towards the rebellious crew and against the Tsarist government.  Suddenly as a mass of people congregated, one of the most famous scenes in cinema history unfolded.  The superbly choreographed and photographed massacre on the steps of Odessa played out under Eisenstein's direction.  The Tsar's Cossack soldiers began shooting at the innocent people cheering for the Potemkin on the steps.  The moving scene with the baby carriage hurtling down the steps will forever be etched in any viewer's memory.

372494,4,6301815807,"The Battleship Potemkin (Sergei Eisenstein, 1925)

Somehow, I'd gotten it in my head that The Battleship Potemkin was Russia's entry into the great Epic genre of the 1920s, one of those multi-hour extravaganzas with a cast of thousands of which Gance and Griffith and that crowd were so fond. I was surprised to find that the movie clocks in at a slight seventy-four minutes, but I can see where I got the impression; Eisenstein crams as much into seventy-four minutes as most directors do into four hours.

Battleship Potemkin is the story of a revolution-- the crew of the Potemkin, tired of the execrable conditions on the ship (a lingering shot of rotting, maggot-infested meat towards the beginning of the film is perhaps one of the most famous shots in all of film), rise up against the ship's commanders and (quite literally) overthrow them. This endears the crew to the masses on shore, but not to the government, who quickly send soldiers to take the ship back from its crew. Spurred to action, the masses attempt to stop the soldiers from getting to the ship by any means necessary (leading to the movie's other immortal scene, the Odessa Steps Massacre). Then the government sends the Russian fleet to aid the soldiers, and the odds build up against the Potemkin's crew. Will the proletariat revolution succeed, or will they be crushed by the czarist government?

That last sentence may seem a bit overblown, but that's the exact spirit of The Battleship Potemkin-- this is straight communist propaganda, power to the people and all that jazz. The film spent a good number of years, ironically, banned in the USSR for being a piece of propaganda. How amusing is that? Stalin and his cronies thought it might incite riots-- the spontaneous rising up of the masses against the government (which is, of course, exactly what the film is meant to celebrate). The difference between Battleship Potemkin and the vast majority of propaganda, however, is that Eisenstein is more than content to let the story spread the propaganda, rather than Eisenstein reaching his godlike hand in and stirring the soup. He creates a realistic scenario (so realistic, in fact, that according to Roger Ebert's famous review of the film, there are still those in Russia today who believe the Odessa Steps Massacre actually occurred) and allows it to play itself out. Sure, there are shots and cuts that subtly advance his thesis, but subtly is the key term here-- Eisenstein was, seemingly, at least as concerned with how his film would be viewed as a piece of entertainment as much as a piece of propaganda. And this is how a propaganda film can be seen, eight years after its initial release, as one of the greatest motion pictures ever made; it's not just a political statement-- in fact, it's not as much a political statement-- as it is simply a good, suspenseful movie. It is well worth watching, especially for those who write propaganda today; if you're going to do it, you might as well take as many lessons as you can from the masters of the form. Eisenstein stands as one of the few. **** ",1169683200,3,3086,4.795112781954887
372495,3,6301815807,"*Potemkin* is one of those landmark films that may be more admired than loved.  Nevertheless , it's worth seeing for the Odessa Steps sequence, for the brilliance of Eisenstein's montages and his orchestration of events.  Personally, I prefer his sound films (*Nevsky* and *Ivan the Terrible*), but *Potemkin* is a must-see by anyone who wants to understand cinema.

That being said, this particular DVD is a transfer from a video version, and it shows.  The version here is actually the 1976 Soviet ""restoration,"" which seems cobbled together from several different versions.  The title cards switch between English-only and Russian with English subtitles; sometimes the shots are clear, sometimes they're grainy and scratched.  The projection speed, as often happens in video transfers, is wrong, and often inconsistent.  Worst of all, the classic shot of the ship hoisting a red flag at the end lacks the colour tinting--thus eliminating one of the key images of the film's climax.  As a version, overall, it's not bad, but I have heard that there is a 2004 restoration that presumably treats this film the way other classic silents have been treated (see, for example, the excellent Kino Video versions of DW Griffith films, or the restored *Metropolis* for an idea of what these films really can look like); I would save my money and wait for one of those versions to appear.",1160611200,32,1380,5.048458149779735

372497,5,6301815807,"""Potemkin"" is a giant among film classics, and deservedly so.  Even without actors' voices, it immediately pulls one into the sailors' world, where they are fed rotten meat (a doctor tells them it contains only ""maggots not worms"", so stop complaining already!).  Those on ""hunger strike"" face punishment, and in an altercation with officers a sailor is killed.  In Odessa,  where they have anchored, villagers mourn with the sailors. Then, Czarist soldiers, in a scene repeated in films from ""Triumph des Willen"", ""The Untouchables"", ""Brazil"" Woody Allen's ""Love and Death"", and ""Revenge of the Sith"",  storm the Odessa Staircase, throwing baby carriages, and others to the wind.  (By the way, there is no evidence such an event ever happened; this is an allegory to the Czar vs. the proletariat or any ""David vs. Goliath"").

This is not your everyday, overacted silent film.  Instead, it is reminiscent of the method acting we will see soon from The Actors Studio in New York...only logical, since the Studio's founder, Stanislavski, hales from Moscow and borrows from Chekhov, as surely these actors did.

The DVD is wonderful.  It is accompanied by a lovely score.  The ""documentary"" at the end is fun, too,  if only for its goofiness, as an antique American apologia for Communism.

372498,4,6301815807,"""Revolution is war. Of all the wars known in history it is the only lawful, rightful, just, and truly great war... In Russia this war has been declared and begun"". Lenin said that in 1905, and the quotation appears on the screen as soon as you begin watching this film. It gives you an excellent idea of what ""Battleship Potemkin"" is about, that is Soviet propaganda.

All the same, this film is a classic that should be watched, in order to understand why it is considered as such. In my opinion, the reasons are many:

a) To start with, the story of a naval mutiny sparked by rotten food is an interesting one, and it is told in a way that makes the spectator think that that event is happening right before him, even though the film is in black and white, and has no sound.
b) Secondly, the sequences regarding the Odessa massacre are impossible to forget, and some scenes are simply gems of great emotional impact and a profound shocking value.
c) Finally, and from a technical point of view, the ability of Sergei M. Eisenstein to produce such a film in 1925 is something noteworthy, as is his edition technic, and the way in which he uses symbols to impress upon the spectator what he wants to say.

All in all, I think that even though watching this film isn't likely to be something you will do often for fun, it is something you should do at least once. Recommended!

A film that has defined how we make movies and why they can so effectively tell stories better than any other medium?  Of course it is!  Just three stars?  Yeah....and before you dismiss my amateurish opinion, hear this out.

The film is all that and more.  I was able to watch all 74 minutes of it and was engaged and intrigued the entire time.  I just think much of what had me clicking was the fact that this WAS filmed in 1925.  These ARE Russians, not Harrison Fordses learning a Russian-ish accent and thrown in front of a blue screen.  All the extras ARE real, not CG sprites running around like ants.  Atop all that is the constant ways you notice this film probably influenced countless others throughout film history.  Its quite raw, real and even though entirely silent, still conveys a pretty darn good story.

The music is also really quite good, although not what Prokofiev's Nevsky is and not nearly as much of a force in forming what we know now as modern day film scores.

But ultimately i didn't find myself at all moved, emotionalized, concerned with the well being of the characters or interested in how this story might play out.  I was just extremely intrigued on how they got that shot, how they assembled all those extras, how many people were on the crew, how long it took to shoot, what they are yelling during the scenes and the countless other little technical nuances that I m sure went into making the film.

I think its a must see for anyone undergoing a serious study of any aspect of filmmaking, infront or behind they camera, or anyone else desiring a well formed knowledge of cinema.

The reasoning behind this bold thought is in the ""language"".

Sergei Eisenstein created modern film language and grammar as we know of and experience in every movie we see. The ""language"" was the daring juxtaposition of images as a series of montages to create narrative flow.

Furthermore, for first time in the history of film, it created a feeling of intimacy for us, the viewer, to the characters on the screen. This intimacy was heightened for dramatic effect by Eisenstein's creation of closeups and varying camera angles on the subject matter to increase audience particapation in the developing story.

Eisenstein invented modern filmmaking and Alfred Hitchcock, some 20 years later, would perfect it.  In tribute, we owe a huge debt of gratitude to Sergei Eisenstein, who's ideas have stood the test of time.",1133222400,2,992,5.061349693251533
372502,5,6301815807,"As late as the mid-1980's panels had voted this the greatest motion picture ever made on a number of occasions, but one has to assume that it was for its groundbreaking cinematic techniques than for anything else. The story is simple and half based on fact: sailors aboard the battleship Potemkin mutiny against maltreatment, and then enter the port of Odessa with the ship to rally the town to revolution (it's 1905). Soldiers appear and slaughter the citizens of the town. The ship heads for sea, persued by naval vessels; they plead with the navy boys to join the revolution and they do (!). The end.

What makes the picture so noteworthy is director Eisenstein's use of montage: quick editing (over 1,300 different shots were used) and fade ins and outs - both new techniques. There is one very noted sequence, Part IV: The Odessa Steps, where a line of soldiers march down a long series of steps shooting innocent people, and as they do a baby carriage slowly rolls down the steps among the chaos (copied in many future films - remember it in THE UNTOUCHABLES?). Because of the quick editing, the horror of the scene is compounded to a terrible fierceness. A masterpiece of film making and definitely worth a watch.",1127001600,6,1220,4.727699530516432

372535,5,6301815807,"Sergei Mikhailovich Eisenstein was one of the finest craftsmen ever to direct motion pictures. His film ""Battleship Potemkin,"" released in 1925, is a classic and was long considered by many to be the finest film ever made. A pioneer in the use of editing, Eisenstein believed that film editing was more than a method used to link scenes together in a movie. He worked with juxtaposing images, in rhythmic succession, to create powerful feelings in the viewers. Eisenstein felt that careful editing could actually be used to manipulate the emotions of the audience.

This, his second movie, portrays the sailors' mutiny on board the Battleship Potemkin. The ship is returning from war with Japan via the Black Sea. Sailors become disgruntled and restive with the terrible treatment they receive from commanding officers, and the horrendous living conditions onboard. Their complaints are ignored. The last straw comes when the hungry men are fed inedible meat, crawling with maggots. They rise up, and take command of the Potemkin. When they arrive at the port town of Odessa, the people sympathize with the sailors' plight, and subsequently pay a terrible price for their support. In one moving scene, the ship's captain becomes enraged when the men refuse to eat the spoiled food. He orders the rebels shot. Grigory Vakulinchuk, a leader of the insurrection appeals to his comrades, ""Brothers! Who are you shooting at?"" He convinces the armed soldiers to join in the uprising. Propaganda or no, it's an extraordinarily moving scene.

Seamed together almost effortlessly, the movie is structured around five episodes: (1) Men and Maggots; (2) Drama on the Quarterdeck; (3) An Appeal from the Dead; (4) The Odessa Steps; and, (5) Meeting the Squadron. Eisenstein used one of the real life participants in the actual mutiny as an actor and historical advisor on the project. ""Battleship Potemkin"" contains one of the most widely viewed scenes in film history - the massacre on the Odessa Steps. Tsarist soldiers march down an endless flight of stairs in a rhythmic, robotic fashion. They open fire on the innocent citizens of the harbor town and relentlessly shoot everyone in sight, without mercy, including a woman with a child in her arms. Another woman is hit and her baby rolls down the steps in a carriage. Extracts from Dmitry Shostakovich's symphonies heighten the drama.

The film was made to commemorate the failed 1905 uprising in Russia. Interestingly enough, censors in many countries banned the movie out of concern that their own citizens and navies might be inspired to revolt. Britain's ban on the film was not lifted until 1954. Voters at the World's Fair in 1958, held in Brussels, Belgium, voted ""The Battleship Potemkin"" the greatest film of all time. Today, at the beginning of the 21st century, the movie still holds its own.

The frenzy immersed and the displayed kinetic energy in the picture has seen few times with such fierceness in any other film previous or later.

The true facts that inspired the argument lines reflected with sinister realism the micro cosmos in a Ship commanded by an unscrupulous and merciless leadership: the awful scenes of the rotten meat still are part of the memories of any lover cinema. This increasing tension state will reach the boiling point and as you may expect, will produce in Odessa's population real mutiny of unexpected proportions that  will emerge with all the imaginable telluric force.

The oppressive repression of the Troops will produce possibly the most bloody sequence never seen in the screen. The horror in the faces of that woman with her hands in her head remind us to Munch's  famous painting: the stone lions falling downstairs and all the chain of articulated images constitute still an admirable and colossal first order artistic expression.

372538,5,6301815807,"Consider this historical notion, that people were bound to their class they were born in Russia when the story of Battleship Potemkin took place.  For example, children who were born into farming families had to be farmers too.  Over several generations families had split up their land and when their children inherited the land it had diminished in size.  Over centuries, the land diminished to such a small size that it no longer provided the means to provide for a family.  Lack of income, starvation, and famine forced the farmers to seek work elsewhere while law forced them to remain farmers.  The rich bought their land cheap while forcing them to continue to farm the land that they no longer owned.  In a sense, it was a form of social slavery enforced through laws made by the tsar.

""Revolution is war. Of all the wars known in history it is the only lawful, just, and truly great war... In Russia this war has been declared and begun.""  This statement by Lenin was made in regards to a rebellion on a battleship in the Black Sea, as he wanted to point out that the soldiers would join in the revolution.  In the backdrop of this notion, it should be known that Western society had transformed through several revolutions to what it is today's society.  Some of the revolutions have been calm considering the blood that has flown in many other revolutions such as the French revolution when countless people were decapitated by the guillotine.  Even the United States had its war for independence, which in essence was a revolution against the British who overtaxed the people in the New World.  In light of history, most people can relate to the soldiers on the Potemkin.

Eisenstein offers an experience, which in itself, is a cinematic revolution, as he utilizes montage and editing in a way that had never been done before.  Even today, filmmakers use Eisenstein's editing technique, which helps augment emotions and the meaning of the situation.  Several scenes display a number of ideas through a montage where the audience can observe a number of powerful symbols in regards to the uprising.  However, the editing would not be what it is if it was not for the tempo of the editing.  The tempo generates a rhythm for each image in a timely fashion, which strikes the retina of the audience at the right moments to provide the strongest possible affect on the audience.

The Soviet regime, more or less, instructed Sergei Eisenstein to make Battleship Potemkin, as they wanted to have a document that supported the Communist revolution.  Eisenstein's editing method induces vivid realism, as each scene is brought to life.  In essence, what Eisenstein does is to make it very realistic, which enhances the visual message for the audience.  This has lead many to regard Battleship Potemkin as a true event, which in fact is not completely true.  Yet, it was something that the Soviet regime must have appreciated, as this film promoted the Communist party's propaganda.

Despite being propaganda, the audience can relate to the situation of the navy men on the Potemkin who are very discontent with the rotten meat and lack of opportunity for rest.  Discontent brews frustration and irritation within the ship's crew, as the authority of the ship treats the men worse than prisoners of war.  Understanding the history provides an interesting connection between the navy men and the farmers of Russia, which Eisenstein used in order to create solidarity among the people of the Soviet Union through the film.  When the Admiral attempts to address the discontent among the crew it leads to him giving the command to cover up some of the discontent men with a huge white trap.  Consequently, he orders the execution of these men, however, the film's unknown hero, Vakulinchuk exclaims, ""Brothers! Who are you shooting at?""  This leads to a mutiny on the ship, which the crew wins at the cost of Vakulinchuk's death.

The death of Vakulinchuk leads to a great gathering where the people display the sorrow for the fallen hero.  As the gathering continues to grow people, begin to voice their discontent with the tsar, which Eisenstein depicts through risen fists in the air and animated gestures by the actors.  It eventually leads to the most famous scene in the film, the massacre at the Odessa Steps, where the Cossacks kill at random men, women, and children.  There is one scene in the whole sequence that is stunningly edited, as it will twist the guts of the audience.  It depicts how a child is shot and falls on the steps and while laying on the steps panicked people trample on the child.  The mother witnesses the whole scene, as she lifts up her child in her arms while approaching the shooting Cossacks.  This scene is visually loaded and poignantly tormenting; however, the message is clear and powerful, as the people are ready to join the revolution.

Many consider Battleship Potemkin as one of the cinematic masterpieces of all time, and rightfully so.  It is true that it has a political value for Communism, yet it also displays a brilliant visual narration that many will continue to study for a long time.  The film received a ban in several nations after its release, even in Soviet Union by Stalin who feared an uprising in the military ranks.  It has been suggested that the film heavily influenced Luis Buuel, as he was holding onto stones in case of a negative reaction by the audience during the opening of his first film, Un Chien Andalou (1929).

Despite its political intention, Battleship Potemkin offers an interesting notion in regards to humanity, which Eisenstein brings out through his skillful direction.  The film also offers a truly brilliant cinematic experience through the exceptional montage.  All of the cinematic components make it look much like a modern film, which the audience might see in the theater.  Yet, the silence, the musical score in the background, and the black and white film raise the awareness in the audience that this film has earned it's well deserved spot in film history as one of the best films ever made.",1110412800,,6087,4.846228239845261

This shows up just a little too much in battleship Potempkin.
In film I want characters.  Maybe one's I can understand or even deprive horrid maniacle characters that make no sense.  In Potempkin we get no characters at all, instead we get, in true comunist style, the masses shown as one mind going this way or that way all at once.
I also like great performances by great actors.  Eisenstein hired no actors (just extras) for his parts, and it shows.  No performances stand out as even minutely expressive.  No performance is close to noteworthy.  Eisenstein thought the actors shouldn't even try.
Rather, we get rapid cutting from face to face, with random violence too fast to be understood.  Many have told me that this creates an empathatical confused and feargul feeling in the audience, but I just became apathetic.

372595,5,6301815807,"Sergei Eisenstein's (1898-1948) most memorable contribution to the craft of filmmaking undoubtedly is the concept of the montage along with other important editing techniques that are commonplace today. This director's first film, ""Strike,"" concerning the brutal repression of a worker's strike by Czarist soldiers, led to more projects: ""October,"" ""Battleship Potemkin,"" ""Old and New,"" and ""Alexander Nevsky."" He died of a heart attack before completing his last film, the historical epic ""Ivan the Terrible."" Unfortunately, Eisenstein's revolutionary (no pun intended) restructuring of the motion picture occurred in movies promoting communism. Eisenstein's films glorified the brutal regime founded by Vladimir Lenin and perpetuated by Uncle Joe Stalin, a regime that ultimately killed tens of millions of innocent souls. Watching an Eisenstein film fills me with a strange sensation: I despise the propaganda in this film, but at the same time, I cannot help connecting with this film on an emotional level. That emotional reaction, of course, is exactly what Eisenstein hoped to achieve with his projects.

""Battleship Potemkin"" takes place during the tumultuous events of the 1905 Russian Revolution, the first revolutionary effort against the Czarist regime and the one that led to a grudging acceptance of a constitutional monarchy by the autocratic Romanov dynasty. This attempt to transform the decaying Russian state ultimately failed due to the ability of the monarch to dissolve the Duma anytime he chose to do so, and veto any legislation that this parliamentary body proposed. The Potemkin figures into this series of events because the sailors aboard the ship mutinied and threw their support to the revolutionaries. Nothing much happened after this event, as the sailors eventually docked the ship in Constanza, Romania and surrendered the boat in exchange for refuge. In the hands of master propagandist Eisenstein, however, the Potemkin incident morphs into a major event that led to the eventual abdication of Nicholas II in 1917.

Eisenstein seems to get most of the story straight: a piece of maggot infested meat serves as the final indignity to the sailors of the Potemkin. Under the leadership of one of the men on the ship, Vakulenchuk, the men protest to the captain about the squalid food. The result is Vakulenchuk's death and the revolt of the sailors. Seven officers die in the mutiny and the ship sails to Odessa, the Russian port on the Black Sea. There, the martyred Vakulenchuk's body lies in state where thousands of residents turn out to pay their respects. The people supply the sailors with food and the ship starts to sail off. Unfortunately, the regime sends in soldiers to quell the crowds gathering to see the dead sailor. Shots ring out, and thousands die under Czarist rifles. In the movie, the Potemkin retaliates by shelling the opera house in the city, supposedly the headquarters of the murderous soldiers. At this point, Eisenstein goes completely outside of the historical record by showing the Potemkin taking the offensive against the entire Black Sea fleet. Even more remarkably, the Potemkin convinces the fleet to join them in the revolt!

Sure, this movie is one long propaganda piece from start to finish, but it is an amazingly effective package of lies. The importance of class appears in the movie right from the start, when we see the sailors interact with the smug Czarist officers on the ship. The outpouring of citizens from the city to see Vakulenchuk's body turns into a recognition of class-consciousness by the outraged proletariats, who yell slogans like ""One for all"" and demand the ouster of the Czar. When the soldiers appear and begin to kill the people, we see Eisenstein in his element. These scenes are simply remarkable in the sheer emotional power of the murder of a young boy and a baby killed by a sword wielding Cossack. Close up shots of faces awash in ecstasy over the coming together of the crowd quickly contrast with the same faces expressing sheer horror over the slaughter of thousands of innocents. All of this cinematic glory is held together with a Shostokovich score of epic implications. You even get a slap at the Church in the form of a malevolent looking priest tapping a crucifix against the palm of his hand as the officers on the Potemkin form a firing squad. Few films pack this type of dramatic punch.

The montages really grab your attention. During the beginning of the movie, a boiling pot of soup conveys the larger sense of the emotional turmoil on the ship. When the Potemkin sails towards the Black Sea fleet, Eisenstein presents a sequence of shots showing the machinery of the ship pounding away as the showdown nears, probably in an attempt to express the powerful drive of revolutionary fervor. There are many more such images in the film, far too many to mention here. A big part of viewing an Eisenstein film is seeing how many symbolic images you can find. When you tire of playing this game with ""Battleship Potemkin,"" watch ""Alexander Nevsky"" and look for all of the references to Germany. Eisenstein's film is a true classic in every sense of the word, and anyone even remotely interested in movies should watch it. I'm glad I did.",1064361600,26,5250,5.051903114186851
372596,5,6301815807,"I had the opportunity recently here in Germany to watch Potemkin in the big cinema with live music - played by a combo from Berlin (violin, drummer, bass and piano), that had written a new score for the film. They showed a restored version with the original russian subtitles. I had seen the film before in offside university cinemas with canned music and on tape, but I never realized what an impact the film can have. It simply blows your mind. The live music turned the film into a totally different expierence. Now I can unterstand why the film caused such turmoil back in the Twenties in Europe. It was banned repeatedly. The governments were afraid of it's impact, as well they should have been. Can you say that of any film today? The original music by Edmund Meisel - who by the way set new standards for film scores with his music for Potemkin - combined with the film genius of Eisenstein to create a film that transcended the normal cinema. It just didn't comment about politics, it created politics. I consider myself a pacifist - but while experiencing the film I had the feeling I ought to stand up, get out a red flag and blow up the next Townhall. The film - with the right music - can have that much of an impact. I was literally shaking during the ""Odessa steps"" sequence, largley due to the pounding music that accompanied the slaughter of the cossaks on the civilians.
I've never had that deep of an expierence in the cinema before with the possible exception of Kubrick's ""2001"" and Alexandro Jodorowsky's ""El Topo"", but I was high both times then. With Potemkin and the right music you don't need any help.
What I mean to say - Find the chance to experience the film the way it was meant to be expierenced. Full screen, the original version und live music. And by that I don't mean a single piano. It's got to be more. The movie will rip you out of the chair. Then you will realize what a masterpiece Eisenstein created.",1055808000,3,1942,4.473239436619719
372597,5,6301815807,"I first saw this movie as a very young man, in its non-electronic, celluloid version. Undoubtedly the film is a great tour de force. Seeing it again recently in the electronic version still impressed me; but I tended to focus on things I missed in my first viewing. First, there is the overly exaggerated, negative characterization of the officers -- and especially -- the priest. Second, when the mutineers decide to avenge their fallen comrade, what do they pick for destruction? The Opera House! Come now, wasn't there some structure with more obvious ties to the oppressive officers?
But the real things to catch my eye were things in the background: 1) the many small pleasure sailboats in the harbor (were these still common when the movie was made, or were they specially brought in); 2) the cosmopolitan nature of the Odessa street crowd; 3) the machinery and fittings of the battleship.
Oh, one more thing: the movie fails to mention (for obvious reasons) that the whole thing ended sort of ingloriously. After steaming around for a while, and failing to get anyone else to join them, the mutineers interred the Potemkin in Rumania.",1047600000,3,1141,4.88659793814433
372598,4,6301815807,"The need for serious film-buffs to own this film is so obvious that I hardly need reiterate it.  Too many have called it the greatest film ever, or nearly so.  Seeing it again, I have to agree that it is a powerful and finely-crafted film, of huge historical importance thanks in part to its many innovations in technique.  While I still squirm at some of its blatant propagandism, I can look past that enough to appreciate the film's excellence.
Anyway, as to this DVD:  the print is pretty good for a silent film, which means that you can make out what's going on about 90% of the time.  Of course, the recent restoration of Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" so completely spoils us now, with its incredible beauty and clarity, that it's hard to settle for anything less!  But this printing of ""Battleship Potemkin,"" from a 1976 Soviet restoration, remains quite respectable.
My main reservation is the music.  Austrian composer Edmund Meisel composed a score specifically for this film at the time of its original release.  Even though the present DVD version is a ""restoration,"" it does not use the original music.  Instead, the score a patchwork of extracts from Shostokovitch's symphonies (the opening scene of waves crashing is the beginning of the 1st movement of the 5th symphony;  the opening of ""Odessa Steps"" with the ships moving in the harbor is the beginning of the same symphony's Scherzo).  Great music, yes, but often not well-matched to the action.",1046563200,10,1459,4.866396761133603
372599,5,6301815807,"Yes, it is plain and simple the greatest of all films. My criteria is personal and I do not want to get pretentious with the viewer. Eisenstein did not invent montage, nor the the medium of what presents it. This film simple displays the power of individual reaction to a chain of events and upon each viewing different perspectives are realized. Only a few films belong in this company(Renior comes to mind). Often imitated , never surpassed, no matter how many times viewed-I am always moved. Propaganda properly realized, and expanded. A masterpiece.",1042934400,3,553,4.956989247311828
372600,5,6301815807,"Why is a Soviet film never reviewed as a FILM? ""Potemkin"" is not the best of Eisenstein's films (that without question is ""Ivan the Terrible"") but it is nevertheless a landmark in cinema, employing techniques which, although adopted by most film makers in Europe in the 1930's, still have not filtered down to the comercially based ""industry"" in Hollywood.
Rather than appreciate this masterpeice for what it is, all USA based reviewers insist in qualifying their praise by saying it is ""propaganda"".  US Cinema from ""Birth of a Nation"" to ""Saving Private Ryan"" was, of course, not ""propaganda"" but objective ""art""(!).
I can only surmize that the purpose of such reviews (some of which come from, apparently, respectable US academics) is to discourage the viewer of Soviet films from taking on board the internal message, which is vital to the understanding of any film (a point on which they would not disagree if they where discussing a film made in the US).
Do not be put off!  This is a genuinely great film, and if you watch it without sub-intellectual prejudice, you shall enjoy it all the more.
Happy viewing.

The editing and music is so overpowering that you forget that it's a silent black and white movie. The experience during ""BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN"" is one of a kind. Any one seriously considering to pursue any aspect of filmmaking must view this film at least once (see it as much as you can!). This shows how film ""can"" be an artform. This was a feat ahead of it's time and still holds an intensity today. One of my many inspirations as a director. Buy it and enjoy a film unlike anything you've ever seen (or heard) before.

372602,5,6301815807,"Based on actual events of 1905, silent film THE BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN concerns an Imperial Russian ship on which abominable conditions lead to a mutiny.  Shocked by conditions on the ship, citizens of the port city Odessa rally to the mutineers' support--and in consequence find themselves at the mercy of Imperial forces, who attack the civilian supporters with savage force.
POTEMKIN is a film in which individual characters are much less important than the groups and crowds of which they are members, and it achieves its incredible power by showing the clash of the groups and crowds in a series of extraordinarily visualized and edited sequences.  Amazingly, each of these sequences manage to top the previous one, and the film actually builds in power as it moves from the mutiny to the citizen's rally to the massacre on the Odessa steps--the latter of which is among the most famous sequences in all of film history.  Filming largely where the real events actually occurred, director Eisenstein's vision is extraordinary as he builds--not only from sequence to sequence but from moment to moment within each sequence--some of the most memorable images ever committed to film.
To describe POTEMKIN as a great film is something of an understatement.  It is an absolute essential, an absolute necessity to any one seriously interested in cinema as an art form, purely visual cinema at its most brilliant, often imitated, seldom equaled, never bested.",1024531200,56,1453,5.1440677966101696

This DVD is a good quality picture (I was surprised), that is all in true black and white (no tinting). The soundtrack is done well and complements the film. The score was recorded during the 1950s by a Russian composer and is a very appropriate musical score. It does not distract from the picture at all.
There isn't an audio commentary, which would have served well for new-comers to this landmark movie which made the ""A-list"" of most important films of all-time recently, and was reviewed by Roger Ebert.

Lets put it this way, unless your favorite film was made before 1925, without Bronenosets Potyomkin it probably would not be around today, period.  No other film next to Citizen Kane have ever influenced the medium so greatly.  In retrospect, viewing the film today might leave you wondering what all the fuss is about.  Today much of the impact is lost due to our peace of time and development of technique.  In fact many of the films scenes may seem, if nothing else, cheesy (the preacher waving his cross in all his stereotypical glory).

The answer is in the ""language"".
Sergei Eisenstein created modern film language as we know of it today.  That language was the daring juxtaposition of images as a series of montages to create narrative flow. Furthermore, for first time in the history of film, it created a feeling of intimacy for us the viewer to the characters and story on the screen. This intimacy was heightened for dramatic effect by Eisenstein's creation of closeups and varying camera angles on the subject matter.

That he was rooting for the ""dictatorship  of the proletariat"" is sometimes painfully obvious.  Nonetheless,  'Potemkin' is one of those films without which so many later films would  have been inconceivable.  Grigori Kozintsev later admitted: ""Perhaps  of all that he achieved 'Potemkin' was the only completed work, and that  because there was no time to spare, no time to reconsider the  problems.""

All the way through the film  the music gave us an idea of the emotion of the time and we were able to  feel just how passionate the Revolution was at that time.  This film was  the first of its kind to use a large number of extras.  This was especially  so in the scene where the people of Odessa were filmed snaking down to the  quay to support the sailors of the Potemkin.
