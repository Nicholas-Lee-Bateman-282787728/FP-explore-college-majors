7002718,5,B00T73AUKQ,Great series for younger kids. Teaches good lessons and does it with hardly any fighting or violence.,1455926400,,101,5.0
7002719,5,B00T73AUKQ,"This is THE show if you have a child into super heroes and such but not quite old enough to understand cartoon violence.  The action is good without being violent and it even teaches some responsibility along the way.  Bonus points for being like a mix of Eureka, Transformers, and Stargate themes so adults can tolerate it. :)",1444608000,,327,4.620689655172414

8700772,2,B00T73AUKQ,"Nice animation and kids liked the idea, but kids ages 8 & under have said there are parts that are too scary. There are aliens in them and we don't care for these story lines in a kids show. More sci-fi than I'd like for my kids. Maybe some of the other episodes would be better.",1521590400,,279,4.0

8700776,5,B00T73AUKQ,"My son got into Transformers while bonding with my husband. We noticed Rescue Bots on Netflix, and decided to give it a try; For Easter this year we decided that we would purchase all the rescue bots dvds so my son could watch them while he is visiting his grandparents. This show contains a lot of action to keep my son entertained during long trips.",1464134400,,351,4.415384615384616

8700778,5,B00T73AUKQ,"My son is a HUGE Rescue Bots fan, and often claims to be one of the Bots himself.  He will often rush to the kitchen to tell me the latest adventures of Chase, Boulder, Heatwave, Dr. Green. Cade, Optimus Prime...the list goes on and on.

He has a TV in his room that I use in dire situations (when we will have company coming over and  I need to be able to clean the living areas with no disturbances) and this is a great go-to.  I will be purchasing the Dinosaur version of this, as even three year olds get tired of watching the same show over and over.

Would definitely purchase again, and probably will, as my son loves the dvd...like the actual dvd itself.  He uses it as a frisbee.
