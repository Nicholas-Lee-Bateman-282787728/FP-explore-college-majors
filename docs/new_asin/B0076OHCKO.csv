5057809,5,B0076OHCKO,I ordered Tom Dokken's retriever training book on kindle and thought it was good. Had previously used Wolter's Water Dog and the Gun Dog  Training books as well. He cover's training techniques from 7-8 wks to 7-8 months. Lots of very specific and helpful puppy training examples.  The dvd shows actual training sessions and is extremely helpful.,1361404800,9,345,5.035087719298246

5057825,4,B0076OHCKO,"Good companion to the book (Tom Dokken's Retriever Training) but not a replacement for it (it doesn't claim to be either.

As a beginner, I like being able to watch Mr. Dokken do the things that are described in the book.",1455148800,,221,4.390243902439025
5057826,1,B0076OHCKO,"Very basic stuff here. I tell you though. I see some major lack of dicipline. Those pups are big enough to know stay and heel. Ain't no way, my pup will be barking and yanking on that leash like that. Then, going after the bird without the command to do so. Tighten up guy. Lol",1452211200,,277,4.054545454545455
5057827,4,B0076OHCKO,"The video was good, but very short. He only spends about 8 minutes explaining the different commands, and the rest of the video is about retrieving. It would be nice to have more information regarding the discipline and obedience part of training.",1452038400,,247,4.904761904761905

5057830,5,B0076OHCKO,Great video and series. The table should of been brought up in this video instead of the second. He should of given some information on discipling. Other then that great videos and great process.,1450137600,,195,4.764705882352941

5057847,4,B0076OHCKO,Good DVD.  Have tried a few of the training methods on my lab and working so far.  One thing that could be added to improve the DVD and the book is a typical timeline for teaching the different techniques to your dog.,1427328000,,217,4.142857142857143

5057849,5,B0076OHCKO,great information.,1424908800,,18,8.5
5057850,5,B0076OHCKO,"This will be very helpful, especially for the beginner trainer, in getting your puppy excited about hunting and ready for the field.  What is also good, and maybe even more important, is the basic obedience and socialization it covers as well.  It's somewhat basic (really only covers up to the basic flush-shoot-retrieve) and may not be necessary if you have already trained a dog or dogs in the past.  The timeline may be slower than what your dog is capable of.",1420848000,2,464,4.703703703703703

5057862,5,B0076OHCKO,Using all of the methods provided by Tom in this video I was successfully able to housebreak my puppy in one week and also condition her to place within the first month. I cannot express how thankful I am to have found this video. The methods taught are purely using reward training which are KEY during the first 14 weeks of your puppies life! Tom is very clear and thorough in his explanation of ways to rapidly develop a great learning pattern for you and your dog with all of the basic commands. I highly recommend for the retriever owner.,1419120000,5,543,4.44

5057867,5,B0076OHCKO,"Great video for my 15 yr old son who would much rather ""watch"" than ""read""!  Would recommend to anyone with no puppy training experience.",1402444800,2,137,4.708333333333333
5057868,2,B0076OHCKO,"The videos are too short, not enough details.  Save your money and buy some other cd.  Really really disappointed with this cd",1400198400,,126,4.681818181818182

8511066,2,B0076OHCKO,was shocked the cost to the content on this DVD.  I have the Retriever Training book and found it to be a much better value and 1/5th the cost and the book arrived in 2 days while the dvd was 16 days from order.  Also for the cost-you can get clips on youtube that are just as detailed and that made this a disappointment for the price.,1517184000,,336,4.0

8511071,5,B0076OHCKO,"This was purchased for my son who recently got a new retriever puppy. He is well versed in dog training, but thought the video would be a good addition and something he could easily refer back to later.",1484006400,,202,4.342105263157895
