I may have very well seen several of the stars of this video.  Thanks for making the video.  Loved the music during the sparring sessions also!",1444348800,,314,4.636363636363637

8639696,5,B00I7KTF4C,"""The Whitetails of Cades Cove"" gives an up-close & personal look at the very special deer that inhabit the Cades Cove area of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. These deer are the descendants of the originals of that area, while so many other areas have had to restock their herds with deer from other areas.  Their photography is, as always, simply lovely.  There are interviews with wildlife officers with much interesting information. The life cycle is well explained & clearly documented with mesmerizing footage.  My favorite was the doe trying her best to wash her little fawn's ears!  Such interesting animals.  Treat yourself!",1392422400,,640,5.115384615384615
