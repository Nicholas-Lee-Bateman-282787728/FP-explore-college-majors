7976672,5,B00007H24A,"I am trying to find information on how to contact Video Tutor math DVDs where John Hall is the presenter. I am also interested in purchasing more of the math  DVDs made by John Hall. I recently purchased a 6 tape algebra set from Amazon. I was also able to obtain a few of his VHS tape from E-Bay, but I was hoping to convert the VHS tapes over to DVDs. In fact, I tried to have the VHS tape converted over to DVDs at Walmart. However; I was told that I need to get the copyright information from the company. So far, I have not been able to reach anyone from the company or find any listings for the company on the internet. The information listed on the actual DVDs is not correct. The phone number listed on the DVDs is for T-Mobile, and the web address on the DVD is at [...]. I am not having any luck with the web address either. Can someone please help me?
 was very impressed with the Algebra 1-6 volume Set (VHS) because when I ordered the set, I was really looking for a DVD set. To my amazement, when the order was delivered, it arrived as a DVD set. I also obtained the decimal and Percent video tutor by John Hall from e-bay, and they were delivered as VHS tapes. I tried to get them converted over to DVD's, but was unsuccessful due to the copyright on the VHS.

I tutor kids k-8th grade, and I found John Hall to be an excellent collection to have when trying to explain different sections of math to the children. I can say the John Hall teaches at a pace so that the kids can understand. He also allows time for them to work the problems with him. In addition, the lessons come with a work book so that the kids can try problems to see if they indeed understand the material.

Update: May 31, 2013

However;I enjoy the video math tutor by John Hall so much that I purchased a DVD / VHS combo to view the VHS version. I have to say that things are working out very nicely. The summer is approaching, and I plan to work with children and prepare them for Middle School. Encourage them to have a mind set for High School, and plant the good math seeds for my kids in Elementary School.

I am hooked on Amazon, and I have no complaints at this time. I would recommend any of the products that I have purchased from Amazon. Thank you Amazon, and keep up the good work!!",1368489600,,2280,4.158730158730159
