8476426,3,B005K26YYO,"Image quality is good.  Laura Gemser is gorgeous.  However, all discs have poor lip-synchronization, and the one listed on the boxed set as ""Black Emanuelle, White Emanuelle"" is actually, ""Velluto Nero, "" (Black Velvet).  It keeps switching from Italian to English and back with no logical reason.  No subtitles.  If you know a bit of Italian, as I do, that is no great loss, but the plot would be difficult to follow in any case.  Beautiful photography of Egypt. No logical plot, and no reason for the characters to react to each other the way they do. The other discs are okay, but dubbing is poor.  Soft-core porn with beautiful girls.  Lots of National Geographic type travel videos.",1495065600,,687,4.762711864406779
