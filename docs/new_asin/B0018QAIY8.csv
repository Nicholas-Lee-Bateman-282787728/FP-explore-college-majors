3418498,5,B0018QAIY8,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this fine selection of Westerns, would buy another set with confidence from Amazon.com,",1264032000,,113,5.705882352941177
3418499,5,B0018QAIY8,"I've had my eye on this collection since it came out, but with a real interest in only 3 of the movies due to high cost I held off buying.  Yet today at WalMart I found the entire collection of 6 DVDs for $15.00.

I watch western movies and also read many fiction and non-fiction books on the west so several of these films meet my interest.  Nothing better than seeing a book you have read brought to the silver screen.  Among the better ones here are THE STALKING MOON (From noted western writer T.V. Olsen's book of same name), ESCAPE FROM FORT BRAVO, and THE LAW AND JAKE WADE (Fawcett Gold Medal Book 756, Marvin H. Albert).  While the other 3 DVDs are interesting the above 3 are the ones of main interest to me, and was surprised how good a movie such as SADDLE THE WIND turned out to be. I am less interested in CIMARRON (remake from 1931) and MANY RIVERS TO CROSS.

Warner Brothers seems notorious for not opening their vaults to issue many DVDs, even the acclaimed CHEYENNE series of the 1950s and 60s has seen only 1 box issued.  If more are desired one must turn to the Encore Western channel for both Cheyenne and Maverick series.  Quite frankly as a reader having both hardcover and softcover westerns by noted author T.V. Olsen on the shelf, wondered if THE STALKING MOON would ever appear on DVD.

The collection of western movies in this box covers the years 1953 through 1968, a fifteen year period seeing the western go from top box office draw to almost its disappearance.  As more than one reviewer has mentioned the movies do not fit together much at all, but then maybe they were never meant to do so.  Any collection having work by both Theodore V. Olsen and Marvin H. Albert can never be viewed by anyone having any knowledge of western fiction as being irrelevant or out of place.  Those two authors wrote many worthy books with a western setting.

Would I spend $42.49 on this set: No.  Would I spend $15.00: Yes; as mentioned, I did so earlier today at WalMart and a great deal that was too.  No more going to the local library to check out these 3 movies. If any reader has the Encore Western channel they will also know that all of these westerns started showing there last fall, 2008.  Best in western reading and watching, pards.

(As another reviewer mentioned: the FOX 3 movie box of Rawhide, Garden of Evil, and The Gunfighter available from AMAZON is not only available at a bargain price, but is a terrific, dynamic trio of western movies from the 40s and 50s.)

3418500,4,B0018QAIY8,"Even though I like Westerns, I can't say the movies in this package are all excellent; they range from good to maybe very good at best.

Warner does its job again and the picture quality is very nice and aspect ratios preserved. If you like actors like Robert Taylor, William Holden and Glenn Ford, and Gregory Peck, you may want to consider getting this box set since it also has a good price.

Considering everything, I gave the package 4 stars but the movies would get between 3 and 4 stars from me.",1247529600,27,502,4.387096774193548
3418501,3,B0018QAIY8,"I got this box set for Christmas this year. I wanted it mostly for Glenn Ford's version of Cimmaron and Escape from Fort Bravo.  These two films are the best of the 6, although Saddle the Wind is also very good.  The law and jake wade was very disappointing.  I am a huge Richard Widmark fan but this one misses the mark, mostly because of Robert Taylor, who is not a good western actor but is in 3 of the 6 films in this set.

The Stalking Moon is ok, but should not be in this box set.  Many Rivers To Cross is a terrible movie.  If you can buy Cimmaron and Escape from Fort Bravo separate, I would suggest doing so.  A better deal would be to buy this set on sale somewhere.  It is not worth the 50 bucks, but Cimmaron and Escape from Fort Bravo are amazing movies.

There is also no special features and no chapter selection on any of the DVD's in this set.  For such a high price, the menu's are very cheap and look like something out of the public domain.  You would be better off buying these western sets:

Classic Western Round-Up, Vol. 1 (The Texas Rangers / Canyon Passage / Kansas Raiders / The Lawless Breed)

Classic Western Round-Up, Vol. 2 (The Texans / California / The Cimarron Kid / The Man from the Alamo)

Fox Western Classics (Rawhide / The Gunfighter / Garden of Evil)

3418503,3,B0018QAIY8,"These westerns are first of all not Warner Bros films; they were produced at Metro. The Robert Taylor films are dreadful, and the stand out is Escape from Fort Bravo, and Cimarron. Fort Bravo has William Holden and E. Parker, and they are stand outs always. In this western she has some of the most  expensive looking 19th century long gowns ever seen in the West. Also Eleannor Parker's hair...never has there been such style, in scene after scene, changes in shape color and ribbons. And catch the ending of this film..what is William Holden doing?

Cimarron has Maria Schell and she is excellent. Glenn Ford is never really good in any film, with the exception of some earlier films and 3:10 to Yuma. Otherwise, it's Anne Baxter and the rest of the cast that make this worthwhile, and, Anthony Mann's direction..note how he has changed since Naked Spur days. Mann is warming up for the big spectacles, such as EL Cid.

Then Stalking Moon could have had a lot going for it, but it's essentially anti Native American, and falls back on John Ford's absurd ideas of people of color.(Ford is a great director, but not in his treatment of Native Americans.)

Many Rivers to Cross..here is a dud of the first rank. If they are doing WARNER BROS westerns, where is The Hanging Tree with Cooper and Schell?

Wait for better things.",1219968000,5,1325,4.645299145299146
3418504,4,B0018QAIY8,"This is a pretty good collection of miscellaneous westerns by Warner Home Video. There is no word on extra features yet, but here are the details on the films themselves and my viewpoint on each one.

Escape From Ft. Bravo (1953) Directed by John Sturges. (4/5)
At the end of the Civil War, Ft. Bravo is being used to house Confederate POWs. William Holden stars as Captain Roper, a man responsible for retrieving escapees from the Fort. He is often brutal in the execution of his duties, but he feels he must be or risk even more escapes. Eleanor Parker comes as a visitor to the fort and butters up Roper. All the while she is helping enable the escape of her true love, a Confederate prisoner. Roper falls in love with Parker's character. When he finds out the truth - after the prisoners escape - he could just leave them to the Apaches. Instead he goes out to rescue and retrieve the prisoners and the girl who betrayed his trust.

Many Rivers To Cross (1955) Directed by Row Rowland. (4/5)
This is a rather unusual cross between a comedy and a western. I really didn't like it the first time I saw it, but it does grow on you. Eleanor Parker stars as a woman who is afraid she will be a spinster and sets her sights on Robert Taylor's character, Bushrod Gentry. Bushrod is an unlikely husband and an untameable frontiersman, or so it seems.

Cimarron (1960) Directed by Anthony Mann (3/5)
Maybe I was spoiled by the 1931 version - in particular the very hammy portrayal of Yancey by Richard Dix. That film won an unbelievable Best Picture Oscar and a Best Actor nomination for Dix. This movie is far superior to the original, with Glenn Ford as Yancey. It confronts head-on the issues that the original just skirts around, yet in doing this it just seems to take on too much. The film is about an ill-matched couple that settles in Oklahoma during the land rush years and how things progress between the two of them as the years progress. Yancey is a wanderer at heart. His wife, Sabra, wants Yancey to settle down and raise a family. You'll probably like this one more if you haven't seen the original.

The Law and Jake Wade (1958) Directed by John Sturges (4/5)
This one has great performances in a rather unremarkable story. Robert Taylor plays Jake Wade. Richard Widmark plays Clint Hollister. It turns out that in years past Clint saved Jake's life when they were in the same gang. Jake goes straight and becomes a sheriff. Jake hears that Clint is about to hang - for something that he actually did - yet feels a debt and breaks him out of jail. Clint does the natural thing - he kidnaps Jake and his fiancee and forces him to return some money Jake stole when he was with the gang.  You can pretty much see where this one is going at every turn, but it is worth it to see Taylor and Widmark in the lead. They really are excellent.

Saddle The Wind (1958) Directed by Robert Parrish (3/5)
The only western written by Rod Serling, this one was rather disappointing considering its author. Robert Taylor once again plays a bad guy gone straight, this time as a farmer. He has a younger brother (John Cassavetes) who is following in his wild footsteps but surprises everyone when he brings home a wife. This doesn't prevent him from getting into deep trouble from which his brother must rescue him.

The Stalking Moon (1968) Directed by Robert Mulligan (4/5)
Considering it was made at a time when westerns were largely out of fashion, this one is very good. It does a great job of building suspense. An army scout (Gregory Peck) takes in a woman and her half-Apache son who are pretty much ostracized by society because of their origins. Unfortunately, the boy's Apache father is a violent fellow who wants his ""property"" back.",1210291200,69,3738,4.528888888888889

I can not believe the badmouthing of some reviews here

they think based on ignorance of how times were on the years they were made

politics yelled out for attention and demanding censorship on the movie industry
congress commitees and investigatios any time in those days!
movie makers were always conscious about world wide hazards on the distribution os their films

escenes with mouth kissings censored in Europe at the whim of prudists, violence scenes toned down to absurd levels

3418520,2,B0018QAIY8,"Don't be fooled by the high ratings, these films are mediocre at best and simply awful at worst.  There is not one movie here that I would ever watch again.  Escape from Fort Bravo is an okay B movie with an A-list star.  This is one of the better films presented though there are some plot and story telling issues.  The ending of the film is wholly improbable.  Many Rivers To Cross, this is the main reason I bought this set.  Look at all of the reviews saying what a hysterically funny movie this is.  This is the worst piece of schlock I have seen in a long time.  It is perhaps the most unfunny comedy I have ever seen and certainly the least funny comedy western.  Here you have two great stars and some good supporting talent with a simply terrible script.  The staging and directing also leaves much to be desired.  The comedic fight scenes are painful to watch.  Cimarron has a few good moments, but frankly, I didn't like the original and I like this version less.  I love Anthony Mann, but I think he comes a cropper with this film.  The Law and Jake Wade is a very nice character study if a bit unbelievable.  But of the six films here, this is the best written and best directed.  This one I might actually watch again, so I told a lie earlier.  Saddle the Wind gives you two good performances by Taylor and Crisp, but John Cassavetes is way over acting and there is no real motivation attached to his characters actions.  Rod Serling may have been a great story teller, but this one misses the mark.  There are bits and pieces of it which are really good, but overall there are too many annoying elements.  And the score intrudes in several places.  And finally, Saddle the Wind is mostly a well told story, however, there are a number of plot points which left me confused, starting at the first stage coach way station (almost everything in that sequence defies how people behave); and then at the ranch leading up to the dnouement and some of the final pursuit and fight scenes will leave you (or at least left me) scratching your head.  I found this entire set to be a huge disappointment.  My recommendation, if you are looking for that perfect western with the re-watchability factor , with drama, good story telling, action, suspense and comedy, see Westward the Woman, one of Robert Taylor's very best westerns.",1456272000,,2334,4.478672985781991

Six movies, two of which i will watch again, three i enjoyed watching and one dud
The following two are worth the price of the set:
ESCAPE FROM FORT BRAVO  Confederate POWS, held in a federal fort, are forced to make a choice when Indians attack.
THE LAW AND JACK WADE  Well scripted and outstanding acting by Richard Widmark.
I enjoyed watching the following three  CIMARRON Not really a western.
 Begins in 1890 with Oklahoma land rush and is a character study of a husband and wife through 1914. Trailer speaks of heroic husband and selfish wife, but a 21 century viewer might see it just the opposite. Outstanding performance by Maria Schell as the wife.
SADDLE THE WIND  Rod Sterling script  Brother against brother.
THE STALKING MOON  First half is very slow but second half has long great climax .
MANY RIVERS TO CROSS  slapstick western  a waste of time
SUBTITLES FOR ALL SIX
Individual disks for each film
Highly recommend set at $20 or less price.",1453852800,4,1048,4.468421052631579

I am not really a techy when it comes to this stuff, but the video was all very good quality.  Some folks grumbled about the lack of extras, but I rarely watch that stuff anyway, so this did not bother me.

In the end, these reviews are all about personal taste, so here's mine:  The Law and Jake Wade is the best of the bunch - Robert Taylor, Richard Widmark, love it.  Next for me is Cimarron merely because I'm a big Glenn Ford fan.  Perhaps the best movie in the bunch is Saddle the Wind - Taylor again, but I've got it 3rd because I've never been a big John Cassavettes fan. Fourth, Many Rivers to Cross, Taylor, Eleanor Parker in something that's as much a comedy as a western.  Stalking Moon with Gregory Peck was a decent movie, but after watching it once, I figured probably never again so it ended up in a garage sale.  Escape from Fort Bravo with William Holden - to be honest, I also sold it and can't remember much about it, so it's #6.  About the only extras are subtitles and theatrical trailers.  Final assessment:  some good, some so so, some not so good, but for about $2.50 each, it was well worth the purchase.",1318550400,11,1011,4.273684210526316

All of these movies are great Western Classics staring from Robert Taylor, Gregory Peck, Richard Widmark, William Holden and Glenn Ford. All the quality of them are great except for others were they aren't a good, but still good. Taylor is awesome in three movies starring along with Widmark, Eleanor Parker, Patricia Owens and John Cassavetes. Out of these six movies none of them are bad as in the story of the movies. Cimarron the 60's version, is the only one that I've heard of out from this collection. If you are a fan of Westerns or any of these actors/actress' this collection is for you!",1316044800,12,660,4.64957264957265
