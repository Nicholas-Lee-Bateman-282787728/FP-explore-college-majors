1812283,5,B00007JGFY,"I think stargate sg-1 is the most entertaining tv series I've ever seen. The storyline and the acting were done very well. It mixes comedy with drama, action and adventure.",1059350400,3,172,4.766666666666667
1812284,5,B00007JGFY,"Season two was the best season ever, Season five is the second best, Season four is third. Season three and six are the weakest of the lot but lets be honest this is the best show of televison bar none.  I would never tarnish a show for a couple of weak episodes, when there is a bigger picture to look at.  This is the first series since X-Files where i wanted to see how things turn out (I just hope it doesnt take the road that the X-files took, though it kinda does with season six(bar the finale which is probably one of the greatest SG-1 episodes of all time).  I am just glad to see MGM getting on the ball with releasing the series quickly.",1058227200,9,648,4.126984126984127
1812285,3,B00007JGFY,"This season is when Jonathan Glassner, one of the creators of the show, leaves for whatever reason, and the show takes a turn for the worse. There are still some excellent episodes (The Light, Absolute Power), but before, every episode was excellent. This season the cast is also joined by two certain writers (who I will not name) who from the first episode (Window of Opportunity) throw away one of the show's most acclaimed accomplishments, to avoid cliches at all costs (something that it has been able to do so elegantly until now) by introducing the most overused idea in tv-show history, the infamous ""time loop"". Interestingly, Window of Opportunity is one of the better episodes the two writers produced. Besides writing, the show seems to deteriorate in terms of quality in other areas as well, directing, casting, etc. Special effects still remains strong, and they won an Emmy for ""The Light"", in the special effects category.
From episode one, Glassner went out of his way to make it so the show would live up to the movie and the concept of stargate in general, and this is what the show seems to have lost after his departure, dedication.",1056499200,21,1153,4.798994974874372
1812286,5,B00007JGFY,"I must say that Stargate SG-1 Season Four is, by far, my favorite season of them all. The year opens with a terrific conclusion to the climactic cliffhanger. ""Small Victories"" shows us just what a mess the Replicator bugs can be for Earth. ""Window of Opportunity"" is a delightful tale of time-travel with a unique twist where Jack and Teal'c can't get out of the same ten-hour cycle! ""Tangent"" shows us just what we get if we ""slap a USAF sticker on the side of a death glider"" and call it ours. Great acting by Richard Dean Anderson and Christopher Judge, though they are sitting down most of the time. Other top episodes from this season include ""The Curse,"" ""The Serpent's Venom,"" ""Chain Reaction,"" ""The First Ones,"" ""2010,"" ""Absolute Power,"" and the ultimate blowout for Apophis in ""Exodus,"" which sends our heroes hurtling into their next adventure for a new year! Season Four is a definite triumph for the Stargate legacy, where stories are followed up and new ones are born. At this point the show had totally come into its own, and it is shown in the development of the characters, the top-notched scripts, stomach aches of laughs, and a plethora of absorbing and entertaining plot threads that will have viewers drooling for the next season. Plus, this is the first boxed set with commentaries! Hours of entertainment right there! Plus the usual special features. So fork over that tad bit of cash and plug in for Season four. Get ready for Sci-fi at its finest hour!

1812300,5,B00007JGFY,"One of the best shows ever created!  Although I did not like the show as much once Richard Dean Anderson stepped away from the show and only became a 'guest' star.  The show was even more fantastic when it was produced on Showtime, because then the episodes were longer, and you didn't have to deal with commercials.  Overall, though, the show is absolutely fantastic!",1506384000,,368,4.71875

I know it shouldn't but it does flavor the performance once you know Jack O'Neil is against guns and a hard core liberal. makes me a little sad, wish actor was a bit more like his character, but we can't have everything!",1501545600,,414,4.1875

1812309,5,B00007JGFY,I'm a big SG1 fan.  I'll admit the first season took time to develop the characters and by season 8 the show had basically ran it's course.  However seasons 4 and 5 are the show at it's best.,1496188800,,191,4.0

1812315,5,B00007JGFY,"i have watched the entire series approaching 10 times...with the subtitles the past few times* so that I can catch every word.  The spelling of the subtitles are the only criticism that I have of the entire series. I have noticed a few misspelled words. In the episode that I am on now ( S4E11-Point of No Return) I have noticed not only a misspelled word, but one that is also mispronounced; ""Keln'o reem"", the Gao'uld/Jaffa form of deep meditation/sleep, performed so that the Goa'uld symbiote can heal and restore the health the Jaffa. Examples of Kelno'reem are seen in many episodes such as Holiday, Descent, Fallen, Crossroads, and more.
There have been other times that the subtitles have been off, but this was kind of way out there; ""my Keloun Reading"". Anyone who knows the series, it's characters, and the basics about them, would know that Teal'c needs to  Kelno'reem regularly, and that if he doesn't, his immune system would weaken and then would be lost. It is a basic defining characteristic. Granted that the spelling of the  Goa'uld/Jaffa language is not easy. While
  it might be plausible to someone who does not know Teal'c to think he planned to do some kind of ""reading"". But even so, Keln'o does not sound the same as Keloun. The sounds of the vowels, and thus the syllables are switched around. I don't recall how the word was spelled in previous  episodes subtitles. It might have been spelled incorrectly before. I just happened to catch the subtitles error at the moment in the very beginning of ""Point of No Return"". I would think that the writers of the subtitles would be given a copy of the script, or at least would be given the spelling of words  of those in other languages( which the Stargate series has a number of alien languages).  Of a 10 season(plus extra movies) 22 episodes each series show, to only have a simple criticism to do with the subtitles is really very good. I hope that the number of times that I have seen the series beginning to end speaks  more than words could. I wouldn't give all areas a 5, but a 10.",1493251200,,2061,4.594005449591281

1812505,5,B00007JGFY,"Season 4 is fantastic. The stories set down some roots, there's more of an over-arching plot at this point, and there's the definitive sense that, though the show is science-fiction and deals with a lot of serious topics, it doesn't take itself too seriously. There's never the feeling that humans are THE one-and-only, best-of-the-best, out there in the entire universe, and those characters who do try to live by that idea are usually shown just how wrong they are.

Something more to note here, the lousy, amateur-like ""transitions"" mentioned in my reviews of Seasons 2 and 3 are gone in this season! No more disruptive, awkward cuts in the middle of scenes etc. The episodes flow from scene-to-scene as they were broadcast initially making this Season a MUCH more enjoyable experience.

My recommendation? Watch the show from the beginning to really enjoy how the show develops over the first three seasons and then just sit back and enjoy the ride through Seasons 4 and beyond.",1474243200,,982,4.945454545454545

1812582,5,B00007JGFY,"Teal'c gets all stylish in season 4 with the blonde beard....well...chin patch. It's hardly a beard.

I didn't watch this show when it originally aired. I am seeing it for the first time now, in 2016. That's significant because there have been a lot of changes in television over the past 15 years that could have easily made this 1990's show outdated and unwatchable. Namely the advent of HDTV. Sci Fi in HD is a different experience than Sci Fi in standard definition.

I am happy to say that Stargate SG-1 works despite being a 4:3 aspect ratio (bars on the sides) standard definition presentation. The thing about sci fi is that everything centers around a good story. If you have a good story, older special effects don't matter. Its' why the original Star Trek series is still watchable despite the low quality effects and Shatner's acting. I love it because the stories are great.

SG1 is a great story. It's fun. It's entertaining. And it takes Gene Roddenberry's approach to sci fi, which is that the story should be about the people, not about the science. The science should be a plot element, not the entire story. That's what made Star Trek work, and its' what makes SG1 work.

Season 4 has an early episode about the SG team being about to support a Nazi like side in a far off war simple because they didn't ask enough questions about who they were or why they were fighting. It was a great humanitarian story about people and our problems, set to a sci fi theme. It was a great episode!

Each episode is about the people interacting with other species or other branches of humanity. The result is that the cast learns about itself and what it means to be human. Yes, there are action scenes and what not that are fun too. And it's always entertaining to watch Teal'c try to fit in. But at its core, this show is about the people in it.

It's a very entertaining show and you don't have to have enjoyed it when it originally aired to pick it up and start liking it now.

Watching it on the Amazon FireStick I find the video quality to be good. Again, it's standard definition. There is nothing they can do to increase the resolution. But the color depth is good. The clarity is good for SD. The only thing that's weird is that the commercial breaks start very abruptly, like they were cut a second too soon. There are no commercials on Amazon video, but this was a broadcast TV show that includes break points for commercials. This presentation edits out the Stargate logo that was appear before and after the advertisements, so you see a blank screen for 1 second where there would have been commercials. Those blank spaces seem to start a second early, where the scene just abruptly stops. It's very minor, but you do notice it. This is an issue with ever season of Stargate SG1. It's not something that just popped up in season 4.",1471824000,4,2848,4.497098646034816

1813295,5,B00007JGFY,"Let's assume the reader has an interest in Science Fiction - given that, this is the best SF series I have enjoyed.  I think there were 10 seasons, and I would recommend viewing them in order to get to know the characters.  There are unique and interesting plots and location and well-played characters.  But more - I really enjoyed watching it.  It would be helpful to rent the full-length film ""Stargate"", from which this series spun off, and watch that first.",1454544000,,462,4.666666666666667

LOVE Richard Dean Anderson in all his sexy self in this season.  Window of Opportunity alone is worth the price of the video.  But there is so much more in Season 4.
I watch this over and over and over.....(along with all the other seasons of Stargate SG1).  Cant get enough of this series.  Miss it very much being on live TV - but the videos are just as good as the original.",1454284800,,499,4.311827956989247

1813365,1,B00007JGFY,"Don't misunderstand me. I give Stargate SG-1 5+ stars. It's by far my favorite series. However, you'd be better off getting the DVD box set. The shows on Amazon Instant Video look like Amazon recorded the airing of a TV channel. The ""PG"" appears at the beginning of each show in the top left, and you can tell when the commercial breaks occur. The resolution is also bad; looks like a second hand recording. The price is also twice what the DVD box set costs.

The DVD box set has great special features, great resolution for its time, and the shows actually appear like a movie instead of a TV recording. Bottom line: stay away from the Amazon Instant Video version.",1453939200,3,667,4.512396694214876

1813673,5,B00007JGFY,"Thank you Amazon for making this series available to your Prime Time Amazon members for free. I am totally hooked and have been binge watching the series from the beginning. Were it not for Amazon Prime,  I probably would have missed out on this terrific sci-fi series.

I have to say that this is my favorite Stargate SG-1 season, thus far. While I enjoy the entire cast, Richard Dean Anderson, as Colonel Jack O'Neill, continues to be my personal favorite, as I find his wry, sarcastic humor endearing. The ensemble of actors that make up the SG-1 team are the glue that keeps this series so interesting, along with the imaginative scripts.

The episode, ""2010"", is pure genius and my favorite episode to date. Moreover, the inter-galactic scourge known as The Replicators starts off the season's first episode, as it continues where season three left off.  Sci-fi fans will not be disappointed and are, in fact, in for a big treat. What a great season for a great show! I can't wait to binge watch season five!",1444780800,,1013,4.706214689265536

The Stargate was one of THE best ORIGINAL science fiction ideas in many a year..  Show blessed with good writers,, better than normal directors, and an EXCELLENT mix of actors who made the show work.  GREAT WAY TO SPEND YOUR LEISURE TIME..

1814222,5,B00007JGFY,"I bought this instead of the 10-season set because (a) it was cheaper to buy each season separately and (b) there were reviews of the 10-season set complaining of poorly manufactured disc retainers allowing the discs to be loose and scratched during shipping. The individual season sets do not suffer from this issue.

I loved all 10 seasons of this series, and have enjoyed many episodes more than once, so it was only logical to purchase the entire set to watch again in the future. It's an excellent sci-fi series with immersive plot arcs embedded across the series combined with well-done, entertaining individual episode plots that are easily able to stand on their own. The characters and the story are equally compelling, due to both quality writing and great acting.

If I could make one change about the series, I would have kept Richard Dean Anderson's character in a more prominent role throughout, but I recognize that actors sometimes have to move on. While Ben Browder took some getting used to (mostly just because I missed Anderson's presence), he filled his role well and the series continued to thrive as a result.",1431302400,,1132,4.890625

Though it gets off to a boring start - sorry but a single replicator on a submarine is a boring premise for a story and especially for a season premiere- this year of stories ramps up quickly. We get insights into O'Neill's and Carter's budding romance, the brilliant episodes ""Chain Reaction"" and ""2010"" and the revered ""Window of Opportunity"" which is viewed by many as the best episode of the entire series.

We both loved it and thought it was a great sci-fi series; especially loved the chemistry between all the actors. Of course it is very far-fetched (most all the people on the distant planets speak English!) and the plots are really out there, but mostly they are very riveting and entertaining and do what a television series is supposed to do--occupy your mind and take you away from your cares and worries for awhile.

People are getting rid of their cable channels myself included and just watching old shows for a reason, you think they would notice it but they don't want to, not that they can't, just they don't, so they continue to show trash.

1814441,5,B00007JGFY,"There are several things about Stargate SG-1 that make it one of sci fi's true jewels. The first is that it grew out of a feature film that I, personally, didn't feel was all that good. In fact, I feel the feature film was less sci fi and more action/adventure. I guess that's what it should have been for that medium when I come to think of it. However, it had a concept, the concept of the Stargate, which made it perfect for adaptation to television. That leads me to my next point. Usually TV shows extracted from feature films come out to be far more inferior than their feature parents. On television, the kings of sci fi include ""Star Trek,"" ""The X-Files,"" and a few other select series that have become a part of the societal landscape. It also becomes the measuring stick by which all other series are rated.

When I first heard of ""Stargate SG-1,"" I felt it would be an inferior piece of work and was glad it was kept in the world of cable. I had never heard of much of the cast, and we know my feelings for the feature film. However, I had a chance to try it out when it came on in syndication and I have been hooked ever since! The cast is top rate, headed by Richard Dean Anderson. Anderson has put his own mark on the character of Colonel Jack O'Neill and it really works. The rest of the cast (Christopher Judge, Amanda Tapping, and Michael Shanks) play their characters superbly. The supporting stars of Don Davis and Teryl Rothery round out a cast that is a pleasure to watch week to week. The stories are nicely written and are a mix with some episodes being devoted to science fiction, some to fantasy, and just old fashioned action. No one is left out here.

In the era where sci fi fans question the viability of Star Trek and The X-Files, I say ""Have no fear,"" if those institutions fall, come over to Stargate. It certainly passes the test that would rank it among the best!",1429142400,2,1897,4.325842696629214

The preeminent Science fiction show that exploded onto the World Entertainment scene at a time when the pale skinned, so-called 'experts' haughtily proclaimed that Science Fiction was no longer a favorite of anyone, that it was 'Dead'.

What is key to this entire set of seasons of Stargate SG-1 is the ever progressing story that gets more and more enthralling and entwined, and the eventual twists and turns are really fascinating.  Also important are the actors, each of the characters they play is played exquisitely well, and there is some ongoing great humor in so much of the show.",1427328000,,488,4.662790697674419

1814822,4,B00007JGFY,"I've been a fan of SG-1 for several years. Season four is where the focus shifts from G'oulds to Replicants in terms of their primary enemies. I love how SG-1 gives family related background dimension to the story line. In season 3 Sam's father becomes a Tokrah, Daniel loses his wife, T'ealc rescues his son from Gould brainwashing, and O'Neal helps Skaara escape Gould control (O'Neal sees Skaara almost as a replacement for the son he lost to a tragic gun accident.)

In season four, we see the relations built with other ally races pay off. We also see a clearer picture of the relationship between O'Neal and Carter. Daniel begins a transition in this season into a more ethereal, mystical character (I don't really think that was the best way to go either). Overall, I love the idea of going through a dimensional portal to fight false gods for the purpose of freeing humanity. I think season four breaks away from that formula a bit by making it a bug fight, and by incorporating some new-age sentiment into the plot lines. Still a show worth watching.",1425081600,,1059,4.663101604278075

1815165,5,B00007JGFY,"This show never gets old. It's been awhile since I last watched it. I was debating between this and something I can't remember right now. I was thinking I watched this whole series already a couple of years back so why bother with it again. I'm glad I bothered again. If you've watched the show you know what I mean. If you haven't but like sci-fi, action, comedy and enjoy watching a show WITHOUT commercials you will not be disappointed. If you don't like sci-fi ,action, comedy and enjoy commercials you are obviously without a pulse and are reading the wrong review. I feel sorry for you. But if you've gotten this far there is hope for you yet. Go on take a chance, watch three or four episodes. You may find that pulse I mentioned earlier. Hope you enjoy or enjoy it all over again. I certainly am. I could be wrong but that's my opinion.
  Parents guide- episode one ( a two parter ) has brief nudity in one scene- woman's northern hemisphere. I believe that is all in the entire series. Also throughout the series there is some profanity but no f-bombs or very course language. It is not a constant but does show up periodically.",1418083200,,1137,4.435406698564593

1815546,5,B00007JGFY,"While I like the review titled ""Still A Good Show"" I thought what could I add... but then I realized that while that may be the most detailed review of a shows season I have ever seen with a synopsis of every episode but with full disclosure, it doesn't provide a lot in terms of actual review.  I would say that in summary season 4 represents more of the show really hitting its stride in terms of character development being fairly complete such that the multilayer-ed story lines are now in full swing.  We are getting to see the alien races encountered over the previous seasons begin to take on a role each nearly as unique as the aliens themselves but with active interaction with SG-1 and the development of interdependence with several of them as some of them start to see that the humans from earth do bring something to the table in contexts varying from a different perspective than the more advance races can achieve anymore (Thor and the Asgard asking for help ) to the Knox recognizing the possibility that SG-1's opinion regarding the behavior of the Ga'uld may actually have merit and as a result take action to protect the those so arrogant in their sense of infallibility caused by not thinking strategically for so long because of not having to actually participate in warfare and as a result demonstrating to them that SG-1 was able to see viable threats they didn't recognize.  All parts of the overall shows many layered storyline facilitated by its long run and part of what makes it such a good show.  There is always that element of repetition that develops, but because of the differences in overall context it allows the episode, while appearing to be formulaic actually serve to progress the bigger story lines forward.  So I think Season 4 i the show at it's best.  There are still advances to come and the eventual changes that caused it to slip, but at this point we still have 6 more seasons and are getting to enjoy the apex of the overall series.

So while I appreciate the synopsis's and opinion of the review I referenced earlier I think it understates that the show is now riding its peak and has a more seasons of good shows before we see the eventual decay caused by loss of key characters and the ultimate limitations imposed by it being on modern day earth... thus enter Stargate - Atlantis where those bounds are lifted allowing some plot lines to be developed and played out that being in a different galaxy allows.  A shorter run because of to much territory to cover before they pulled the plug, but that is another show.  For this season I say 4 is part of the peak and without 1-3 would leave the viewer deprived of references that are critical to the enjoyment.  So it doesn't stand on it's own but successfully builds on what has been established to date all the while planting new seeds and stretching bounds keeping the entertainment level high and the quality quite good.",1399680000,,2923,4.593090211132438

1815615,5,B00007JGFY,great casrt and developing plot line keeps the series going strong and make it a great show to watch now,1395100800,,104,4.25
1815616,5,B00007JGFY,I really love the writers of this show. They bring a lot of current events (at that time) and existing things and give it a new twist. It has a lot of hidden meaning and a lot of humor. The members of SG-1 have personalities' that flow together as they save the world from another invasion or another bad guy. It is a good escape from reality!,1395014400,,343,4.134328358208955
1815617,4,B00007JGFY,Since I really enjoy this show I really enjoyed the 4th season. I am looking forward to watching the rest of the series.,1395014400,,120,4.260869565217392

1815619,5,B00007JGFY,"The first season was a bit rocky. But it got better. Much better. Stargate: Atlantis was also well done, as were the two SG-1 films. Too bad the show is off the air.",1394928000,,165,4.03030303030303
1815620,5,B00007JGFY,One of my favorite shows ever. Richard Dean Anderson is great. If you like science fiction it is a must watch.,1394928000,,110,4.285714285714286
1815621,4,B00007JGFY,"I love Sci-Fi.  This is the one series I didn't get into when it was new.  Mainly because I just couldn't see Dr. Jeff Webber in a Sci-Fi role.  I know most everyone watched because they loved MacGuyver aka Jack O'Neill with 2 L's.  I think his character dumbs down the show and ignores the level of education it takes to get to the rank of Col. in the USAF.

Overall I like the show and enjoy it.  I love the characters and I think it does address some very real problems if aliens contacted us today.  Its not as cutting edge as Babylon 5, but it will do for someone who just isn't into zombies, werewolves and vampires.",1394323200,,622,4.176470588235294
1815622,4,B00007JGFY,"Not the best season, but the show keeps getting better and better.  RDA keeps the show going and the cast seems to be filling into their roles well.",1394150400,,148,4.285714285714286

1815632,5,B00007JGFY,I really thought the season was outstanding. The actors make the show and story lines always seem fun and interesting regardless how far fetched they are. The characters really drive the series for me.,1393804800,,201,4.9411764705882355
1815633,5,B00007JGFY,"All ten years of Stargate SG1 never once falls to the level of the movie it was based on. Not that the movie Stargate is that bad it is that the show SG1 is that good. This is a fan show and the only people that will be buying complete series will be fans and if your a fan then you know all 10 years are good and you can not go wrong buying any of the seasons. If you might be someone looking for a new science fiction to watch then please give SG1 a try.

One last thing, I had herd years ago that Kurt Russell (actor in the original movie) would have considered being on SG1 for a guest spot. I wonder why they never thought of doing one of those mirrored inner dimensional episodes like they had for other shows and he and Richard Dean Anderson would have traded out spots in their prospective universe? That could have been a lot of fun.",1393718400,,842,4.041916167664671
1815634,5,B00007JGFY,"Loved the series when it was on TV, watching on Amazon prime without commercials is is great with our new Vizio with Amazon, etc.!",1393632000,,130,4.458333333333333
1815635,5,B00007JGFY,I have yet to see the whole series and I love sg1.  So far it has been a real treat. I hope to finish all 10 years.,1393545600,,115,3.259259259259259
1815636,5,B00007JGFY,This show just continues to get better each season as they show how the alien alliances start to yield technological benefits for SG-1 and they continue to have more of an impact in the galaxy.,1393113600,,193,4.542857142857143
1815637,5,B00007JGFY,"This series is fun, yet addresses ethical quandaries. As the series matures, the lines they don't cross are finer and finer, which make for interesting dilemmas.",1392940800,,161,5.230769230769231
1815638,5,B00007JGFY,"This show continues to get better and better.  I've watched the series before, but I like it better each time I watch it, as I've always managed to miss something.  While still no match for Battlestar Galactica, its still great SciFi and deserves to be watched.  If the studios had any imagination, they would do well to bring both this and Star Trek back. Why they were taken off the air still baffles me. I've got to think that imagination went out when texting on cell phones came in.",1392940800,,487,4.449438202247191

1815660,5,B00007JGFY,"Season 4 was overall excellent, but the following episodes were most interesting to me: Ascension, Beast of Burden, Summit, The Warrior. Orlin and Sam were really great together. Beast of Burden was a wonderful indictment against slavery and inhumane treatment of species other than homo sapiens. Summit gave more insight into Goauld culture, and one can hopefully find out later why the system lords are practicing cannibalism on symbiotes. The Warrior was a beautifully sculpted story giving more insight into Jaffa culture.",1392681600,,526,5.426829268292683

1815667,5,B00007JGFY,"The reason to give this a five star? I love the series. It kept me wanting to come back and watch all over again from the first season, and how many other tv shows would you want to watch over and over again? Nice knowing you can cancel cable, watch most shows online instead of oaying for 1000's channels of which only 50 are used by you!",1392076800,,339,4.074626865671642

1815687,5,B00007JGFY,"One of the best sci-fi series.  It combines so many interesting philosophies together: ancient aliens, gods, fancy technology and lots of action.

1815700,5,B00007JGFY,"Season Four, together with Season Three, are (IMHO) the best seasons of this show.  I say this because, overall, each season has a greater number of ""best episodes"" in each.

1815758,5,B00007JGFY,"Here is the complete fourth season of SG:1. This is a great way to relive the SG:1 series, since it doesn't seem to be offered on any streaming services (Netflix, etc.) The disk is nicely packaged and the DVD menu's are simple and easy to navigate. It may be a little more expensive to buy each season separately, as opposed to a complete pack, but this way you get the disks in a sturdy package that keeps them safe from scratches and wear. I'm very happy with this purchase.",1382832000,,476,4.359550561797753
1815769,5,B00007JGFY,One of the best shows ever on the sci fi channel. Richard Dean Anderson is absolutely hilarious!  Too bad sci if has terribly boring and unoriginal shows now.,1382400000,,158,4.642857142857143
1815770,4,B00007JGFY,The only problem I have is during prime viewing hours (1800 hrs to 2400 hrs) the Amazon down rate speed drops below viewing speed to less than 1 Mbps.  My tested transfer rate is over 50 Mbps download and over 2 Mbps upload.  I can only assume this problem is on Amazons end.  I could not find a point on their site to communicate the issue.

The show gets more space legs, featuring far more impressive and ambitious special effects work.

1815778,5,B00007JGFY,This is probably my favorite season of SG1 when the entire season is taken into account. Not to say the other seasons are bad--they aren't. This season is just the best of the best in terms of classic stargate humor and drama and scifi.,1381449600,,236,4.386363636363637

I can appreciate his contribution better now, than I did when those seasons originally aired because I was so angry then that Daniel was gone. Daniel is still the best, but Jonas was a great Jonas!

1815798,5,B00007JGFY,"I never got to watch the show sequentially, so I am taking this opportunity to watch it from beginning to end. When watching each episode, I think back to when I saw it...or if it was one that I haven't seen yet.  It's definitely contributing to my hermit-like lifestyle on the weekends, when I am in a Amazon Prime Streaming Video marathon mode!",1380412800,,346,4.492063492063492

Science fiction (most are good stories), interesting characters, humor.  All in all, a good season as they continued to build the connection with other races and fight the bad guys.  This series just gets better as the characters continue to flesh out and they build upon previous stories with return characters weaving a web of story lines and fun plots.  Sure, some of the episodes feel like the writers took the week off, but most are solid, fun and even thought provoking.  All in all, thumbs up from me.",1378944000,,728,6.098039215686274

For what's it worth, I highly recommend the show.  The characters make it fascinating and plausible.  At least start at the beginning and see if there isn't something in it for you to enjoy.

Thank you Amazon for making it possible to watch through your Prime membership for free.  Nice perk.",1376352000,,567,4.233644859813084

1815877,4,B00007JGFY,"On season 5 now and all the flavors are just beginning to mature.  The story is more intertwined, the characters have more depth and better personified.  The writing has taken a bit of a twist too, the themes and plots of each episode have gotten better.

I held back a star because the show really should have hired a high level scientific adviser.  In almost any episode you can poke major holes in their story either by concrete science or even by the rules they lay out in their own theoretical physics.  It's the one missing element out of this show.  Aside from that, it's prime time type t.v.  What more can you expect?",1375056000,,626,4.43859649122807

1815885,4,B00007JGFY,We never could get to see the whole series when it was on regular TV.  It was nice to get a chance to finish watching the full series.  Only drawback and this is not Amazon's fault as it is the same on the DVD's is that when this was edited for commercial television the commercial breaks are awkward and there are some missing segments around those breaks.,1373328000,,357,4.313432835820896

1815909,4,B00007JGFY,"Star Trek = inception, Stargate = Transformers.
The show has a rich mythology, but lacks the thoughtfulness that other Sience fiction shows such as Star Trek or Battlestar Galactica have. It does have some great action and the characters are endearing. In season four, the show starts to really find its balence as part episodic part anthology series. (this will tip more tword anthology as the seasons progress). You meet some great new characters & start to get a sense of where the series is headed. The season opener teases a new villain you WILL SEE AGIAN!

It wasn't until I watched the first season (all the way through, some of the episodes drag...) that I fell in love with the show.

The only other show that is comparable is Dr. Who....The BBC Wales new version of Dr Who is also top notch.  But Stargate SG1 is a standard for ALL shows.  This show is HIGHLY recommended.  Even if you don't like scifi, try season 1 at least.  It only get's better as the seasons progress.  It ends up in two movies, and the last movie is just outstanding.  Like it even more than Star Trek, any of them.",1369958400,,480,4.208791208791209

He said the first few shows had story lines that weren't that great, but the stories matured nicely over time, and he was right.

1816099,5,B00007JGFY,"I have to say this is on of the best shows ever produced.  So many seasons, and has great action, story lines, and characters.  I have watched this from start to finish many times.

Season 4:
In the scene in ""Divide and Conquer"" that flashes back to the events in Upgrades, where Carter and O'Neill are trapped on opposite sides of the forcefield, lines were written but the actors chose not to say them. In ""Watergate"", melted toxic wax was used to give Maybourne a frozen look. Tom McBeath couldn't breathe it in or would have risked his own health. The actual ending of the episode where O'Neill proposes that the two races had just exchanged hostages was not the intended ending, which is why the episode appears to end so abruptly. In ""Beneath the Surface"", Thera and Jonah were supposed to kiss to confirm that they were in a relationship, but this was dropped because O'Neill had already kissed Carter earlier in the season.

Season 4 has 22 episodes and aired in 2000.",1362096000,,976,4.591954022988506

1816167,3,B00007JGFY,The price was right. Purchased all 10 seasons for .25 cents a episode/$4.99 a season. The video quality looks ok on the kindle. The aspect ratio is standard TV 4:3. This reduces viewing area on the kindle screen. Good value for SG-1 Fans who are not looking for HD quality.,1345852800,,273,4.48

1816172,3,B00007JGFY,"I thought the episode was worth the time.  I especially enjoyed Jack's recollection of a bald man in a short sleeved shirt named Homer.  You see, the gang has medically induced amnesia.  More than that, they believe they are workers in a dark, depressing underground power plant.  The heros must escape.  They do.  No surprise there.  Seeing Jack and Sam close together was nice.  And Daniel once again proved that his skepticism is deeply ingrained.  The conclusion did not involve a massive gun battle which is surprising after seeing later seasons of Stargate.

If you liked this, check out Workforce from Star Trek: Voyager.  It's an episode that showed about 6 months after this episode.  Much more coherent and entertaining version of this plot.",1329004800,2,751,4.967741935483871
1816173,4,B00007JGFY,"I like the episode.  I think my summary will show what I like about it:

SG-1 finishes the relocation of a population of rare humans to a suitable replacement planet just as a giant fire-spewing ship appears on the horizon and a terrified refugee returns.  Jack wants to blow up the ship, a terraforming Ark of an extinct pacifist civilization, to save the population of rare humans.  The humans are a completely unique race with environmental needs forcing them to live on the planet.  They cannot be evacuated to Earth as their bodies would suffer from Earth's comparatively harsh radiation.  Daniel is determined to persuade the alien's mediator, an exact replica of the rare race of humans, that no one is better placed than the mediator himself to understand the plight of the rare humans and to find another solution that will spare them and mediator needless death.  Time is short, and it is up to Jack to go against orders and to find a military solution that protects the vulnerable humans against the Ark's fire and poisonous gas.  Can Daniel find a solution that spares the humans but also preserves the alien Ark ship?

1816174,5,B00007JGFY,"This is the Ground Hog Day episode of Stargate.  Like that movie, principal characters repeat (part of) their day a thousand or so times.  Their exacerbation and solutions provide amusement to the dedicated viewer.  This episode while comedic throughout concludes the plot with pathos.  There is a sort of post script that follows up with a wink and a nudge in the ribs...  No toaster ovens in the bathtub, fireballs at the bottom of a mine, or bell tower jumping onto pavement, but the characters stuck in the loop take up some silly habits nonetheless.  Watch it, dagnabbit!",1328918400,,576,4.826530612244898
1816202,5,B00007JGFY,"The episode leads the audience through much suspense in the pursuit of a mortal threat.  The questions are who has become a sleeper agent bent on assassinating Tokrah and American leadership and how to find out when the sleeper agents don't know it themselves?  I won't give away the ending by saying who does what, but several characters die.  Every scrap of action has a reason in this episode which later on in the series would become rare.  This ranks as one of my favorite episodes in Stargate ""canon""--if you can call the collection of Stargate shows a canon.  (Stargate Universe might be flung from the canon for all I care.)  The flow of the episode is great.  A show cannot flow with out the right dialogue to fit the events, and the rather abundant dialogue in this episode fits the events well.  Good show which I recommend to all sci-fi fans.  Watch the first three seasons of Stargate SG-1 before watching to get the most out of it!",1328832000,,945,4.544378698224852

1816266,5,B00007JGFY,"For the first three seasons, Stargate SG-1 was to me a thoroughly watchable and entertaing ""also ran"" sci-fi show with a very likeable cast and a great premise for space travel that eliminated the need for spaceships, thus allowing humans from today to embark on the kinds of outer space adventure usually reserved for our descendants centuries hence.

But something magic happened in season four!  Was it the writing?  The special effects budget?  The actors getting comfortable in their roles?  Maybe a combination, but to me this season is where Stargate SG-1 left the ""also ran"" space opras behind and began its ascension (pun intended for you fans) to where it stands today as one of the great epic sci-fi TV series that people will be watching decades from now, I hope.

I had just completed watching all the way through season 8 on my own when my wife, who doesn't particularly like sci-fi as a genra, suddenly latched onto this series (another tribute to it's greatness, that non sci-fi fans can enjoy it) and had me watching it again from the first season forward.  I promised to filter the episodes for her and make it a ""best of Stargate SG-1"" kind of thing.

During the first three seasons, I enjoyed re-watching the great episodes that established the goa'old (or gooy-old or whatever, even the Stargate actors themselves can't pronounce it consistently) and introduced us to the Nox and other aliens, but there were a number of episodes in each season we could just skip without missing much, and I didn't particularly care to see them again.

Then came season four!  Which ones to skip?  They're all, like, really good, and some are brilliant stand alone examples of sci-fi storytelling.  And, they started doing commentaries for each episode!  So, you could watch them once and then relive them through the eyes of the creators of the show.

Well, I won't go into each episode, but it's season four that contains the episode that officially made me a Stargate SG-1 fan, and that was ""Window of Opportunity"".  This has got to be one of classic episodic sci-fi episodes ever written for any series, kind of like ""The Inner Light"" was for Star Trek Next Generation.  I saw ""Window of Opportunity"" on TV and thought ""Wow, this show has some writers who know what they're doing"", and then I started buying the series sets and watching from episode one.  The great thing about this episode is not only the Groundhog Day premise, but the sad and thoughtful ending.

Anyway, here's your window of opportunity to watch great sci-fi.  Don't be surprised if you end up watching some of them more than once.",1181001600,5,2611,4.762222222222222

1816284,5,B00007JGFY,"Season Four is in many ways the most difficult to assess of the show's first four. On the one hand it features a number of absolutely first rate individual episodes, but on the other the larger narrative was developed far less than in seasons two and three. Almost always such lack of development is the result of network pressures to produce a show that was easier for first-time viewers to access. Seasons Two and Three saw a vast amount of plot development, as new races and characters were introduced with increasing rapidity. Season Four cut back on this tremendously, and the overall arc proceeded at a much slower pace.

I give Season Four five stars but I am going to confess that this is more a reflection of my opinion of the show as a whole than this season in particular. I personally think that the more a show pushes the long story arcs, the better it is as a show. FARSCAPE was never better than when it was pushing its dominant narrative and the same is true of a host of other shows such as THE X-FILES, BUFFY, ANGEL, and LOST. Many--and I include myself in their ranks--feel that ALIAS began to fade when it mysteriously lost its grasp on its on master narrative. The first three seasons seemed to be leading to something definite, and then it was as if the show started all over again.

Nonetheless, while the overall story lagged a bit in Season Four, there were a host of amazingly good episodes. So there was never a point where the show became slow or tedious. And there were some great guest appearances. Willie Garson, who is best known as Stanford, Carrie's gay friend, on SEX AND THE CITY had a nice appearance as an alien stranded on earth. He has since reprised the character.

The English first crowd should continue to be glad that North American English is the galactic standard.

Episode Synopses appear below:

Small Victories - The season opens with an old Soviet sub infested with one of the Replicators which were causing havoc in last season's cliffhanging finale. That one replicator manages to reproduce and take over the sub. That is the small problem. The big problem becomes apparent when Thor comes through the Stargate. He comes seeking help. His planet is about to be overrun by replicators and their high-tech has done nothing to help them. They think the Earthlings might be able to help because old fashioned bullets seemed to be able to destroy the spiders. The concept is so primitive that it never would have occurred to them. They hope that more such primitive thinking will help them pull their collective chestnuts out of the fire. The solution to both problems seems to be the same and is summed up in the old human adage, ""you are what you eat.""

The Other Side - This is a dark one. Contact comes through the Stargate from a human civilization seeking help. They are involved in a war and are desperately seeking help from any source they can find. It is a fairly advanced civilization and, in return for heavy water to fuel their reactors, they will give of their technology. Col. O'Neill is quick to jump on the offer but something seems wrong. They are very reticent to talk about their enemy or to describe the cause of the war. As time goes on, they begin to show an increasingly ugly side. The team must decide if the technological advances are worth the moral price.

Upgrades - A Tok'ra who is haughtier than normal comes through the Stargate seeking help. They have some armbands that came from an extinct civilization which are reputed to give superhuman strength and speed. They want to test them out and learn more about them. They do not use themselves because their ghoul parasites render them immune. It turns out that the armbands do work. They confer phenomenal speed and strength but they have some problems as well. They are addictive, they won't come off and they screw up normal bodily metabolism. This does not seem to bother the Tok'ra scientist who is not only insufferably arrogant and oblivious to the health of the SG1 team. She has a hidden agenda. She wants to use the enhanced powers to carry out a raid against Apothis.

Crossroads - A Jaffa priestess comes through the Stargate with strange news. She claims to have learned how to communicate with her larval symbiote. She wants to get in touch with the Tok'Ra so she can transfer the larva. It is past her time to ""deliver"". Without a new host, she will die soon. Everyone is skeptical. Communication with larval symbiotes is supposed to be impossible. The payoff is can be large as well. They ghoul will have valuable knowledge. The new defector to the Tok'ra turns out to be less than trustworthy but, then again, the Tok'ra are not particularly trustworthy themselves.

Divide and Conquer - A delegation from Earth is negotiating a formal treaty with the Tok'ra. As the negotiations draw to a close, one of the humans goes crazy, pulls a weapon and tries to assassinate the Tok'ra leader. The attempt is foiled but the human manages to turn his weapon on himself. It turns out that he had been the victim of some sort of Ghoul mind control technology. Now, all of the humans are suspect. Testing reveals one more agent from the other SG teams and then it reveals Col. O'Neill and Maj. Carter as two more. They flunked the test and there is reason to believe that they are part of a plot to assassinate the President or the Tok'ra leader. The truth proves more complex. The detection device is actually a glorified lie detector and they failed the test because of something they refuse to admit even to themselves. That does not stop the assassination attempt, however.

Window of Opportunity - It's GROUNDHOG DAY for Col. O'Neill and Teal'c. While the team is investigating an artifact of the ancients on a distant planet in the company of an off-world archeologist, they notice he is acting a bit squirrelly but don't pay much attention due to the big magnetic storm going on all around them. Suddenly, some strange rays shoot out, hit the Stargate and the colonel and Teal'c find themselves back on earth...the day before. They keep reliving the same day over and over again as they try to make sense of the time loop that only they seem to be stuck in. They work hard and also take some time off for pranks they know they can get away with. No Consequences! It's a fun episode.

Watergate - When the Stargate fails to lock on to a destination, SGC realizes that it is because another gate is open on earth. They come to realize that the gate they thought had been destroyed on Thor's ship survived reentry and was recovered by the Russians. Now, it is stuck in the ""on"" position and the Russians want help. They seem to know way too much about the super secret Stargate program. The reason turns out to be surprising but not as surprising as what is on the other side of the open gate. It opens under water and the inhabitants of that world are quite...fluid.

The First Ones - Daniel and one of his archeologist buddies are on a dig on a planet. They are uncovering fossils of primordial ghouls. Suddenly, the dig crew is attacked by an Unas. It is a very primitive unas. Some of the crew are killed but Daniel is dragged off alive. A rescue mission is sent to find out what happened. The survivors seem dazed. Daniel is terrified. He thinks he is about to become a ritual ""coming of age"" feast for an aboriginal Unas. While he is being transported, however, he begins to develop a relationship with the brute. Now, if the rescue team can just figure out what is making the first wave act funny, they might catch up to Daniel and the Unas before he becomes Purina Unas Chow.

Scorched Earth - In a humanitarian gesture, the SG Command endeavors to relocate an entire civilization to a new planet. It is a fairly primitive civilization but they are nice folk. Their previous home had become uninhabitable. The planet to which they are relocated is a rare one which can accommodate them. Just as the people are celebrating their new home, word comes of a great disaster. A gigantic machine is destroying the planet. Actually, it is terraforming the place into an environment suitable for the race that built the machine. That would make it fatal for the humanoids. Actually, they would not have to worry about it because they will not survive the terraforming process. The terra formers can't just pack up and leave because their ship had the capability to restore their civilization on exactly one planet. There are not enough resources to start again. It's a nasty little moral dilemma. Seemingly, one of the two civilization has a chance to survive and the other one is doomed.

Beneath the Surface - The crew of SG1 are acting strangely. They are laboring in a subterranean power plant under appalling conditions. Except for Teal'c, they don't even realize who they are. They think they belong working as ""slave labor"". Even Teal'c is not remembering things clearly. A little mind control touch up and the Teal'c problem seems to go away. Meanwhile, back at SGC, everyone is organizing search parties. Nobody can believe that the team could just disappear that way. The government on the planet where they disappeared is not being too cooperative either. It looks like the members of SG1 are condemned to eternal slavery, at least for as long as they live.

Point of no Return - The people of the SGC are surprised to get a crank phone call asking for Col. O'Neill. They are even more surprised when the guy shows knowledge of the Stargate. They have no idea who this clown is but they decide they need to check him out. He turns out to be the biggest dweeb/nerd/weirdo ever to grace the small screen. Every clich is invoked. He also turns out to be right most of the time. His memory, though, is very faulty. It seems to get things wrong at just the right moments. Oh...and the undercover agents with the drugs, hidden spaceships and black helicopters really out to get him.

Tangent - The SG program is starting to bear some technological fruit. They have managed to cobble together some captured parts along with some new fabrications and build a fair copy of a ghoul assault glider. The pilots are having a ball with it until they take it out for a live fire test flight. Teal'c is piloting and O'Neill is in the second seat. Suddenly, the plane heads straight up and just keeps on going. Because of Teal'c's rebellion, Apothis had installed retrieval devices on later gliders. The parts incorporated into the earth design have these recall devices. The earth glider is heading back to Apothis and should get there in a few hundred years...long after they run out of trivial things like air, food and water. The only hope is a rescue mission. The only people available to help are the Tok'ra but they have another mission in mind.

The Curse - Daniel learns that his old professor and mentor has died in a strange accident. He goes to the funeral and encounters an old flame and an old rival. He learns that they have been messing around with some artifacts that are of the ghoul variety rather than the Egyptian kind and they have no idea what they have really found. It is dangerous and threatens to unleash two more of the old ""gods"" on earth. Academic rivalries just make matters worse.

The Serpent's Venom - While trying to foment revolt among the Jaffa on Chulak, Teal'c is betrayed into the hands of the Ghoul, Herorar. That is not good for anyone concerned especially Teal'c, who face some unpleasant bouts of torture. Herorar has a plan. He want to trade Teal'c to Apothis in the hope of gaining a privileged position in the Apothis regime; Apothis is trying to expand his forces to take over the entire ghoul hierarchy of System Lords. Apothis has his own plans. He want to get Teal'c, betray Herorar and take his army anyway. SG1, needless to say, has plans of their own. They want to prevent an alliance and save Teal'c. The Tok'ra's plans coincide with Stargate Commands in the first part but they consider the Teal'c part optional and unworkable. Everyone has his own idea as to how to proceed. Meanwhile, Teal'c is having a very unpleasant holiday.

Chain Reaction - As the SG1 team returns from a dangerous mission, General Hammond informs them that he is retiring. He declines to give any reason. His replacement has all of the warm and fuzzy qualities of George Patton but none of his common sense. When Col. O'Neill starts investigating why Hammond retired, he learns that his grandchildren had been threatened. Some shadowy types want more access and control over the SGC agenda. They only way to get rid of the idiot who is commanding SGC and who is, incidentally, about to get the earth blown up, is to get the goods on some of the slimy politicians that exerted the pressure. This require some deals with the devil.

2010 - This is a strange episode that does not fit in too well with the rest of the series. It takes place in 2010. The SG1 team are featured but they are their future selves. They inhabit a nice world in which all is pleasant except for a few minor things. The slimy politician who has caused them so much trouble is now the president. Col. O'Neill retired under a cloud. Maj. Carter is married to somebody else. Humanity is allied with an advanced civilization which has given them longevity drugs. The ghouls are no longer menace. Human fertility is essentially zero. It seems that the advanced race has a plot afoot to extinguish humanity so they can have Earth. When the SG1 team finds out what is happening, they come up with a plan to fix the situation. It involves send a note back through time to themselves.

Absolute Power - On a trip to Abydos, Daniel finally meets the harsesis, the son of his dead wife and Apothis. This is the child with the accumulated genetic wisdom of the ghouls and who was taken into the care of an glowing alien some episodes back. He has aged a great deal since then, though he is still a small boy. He has been sent to Daniel to learn of his true mother. The SGC team wants to tap into his knowledge. While conversing with Daniel, the boy imparts a large store of that knowledge directly to him and the result knocks Daniel unconscious. A year later, Daniel is a power mad despot who willingly kills millions just for his own personal purposes. All is not as it seems, however. The boy is just trying to teach his step-dad a BIG lesson.

The Light - The members of SG5 begin acting strangely after visiting a new planet. They show signs of depression and their brain chemistry is messed up for no apparent reason. One commits suicide. The others seem heading that way. So does Daniel who had accompanied SG5. They are getting worse and are heading for death. The SG1 team heads back to the planet to try and find out what is happening. There, they find a strange adolescent and an alien device that puts out a strange light show.  When the Doc figures out some of what happens, she determines that they are suffering from withdrawal symptoms something like those from narcotics. O'Neill gets hooked and so do Carter and Teal'c. If they leave the planet for too long, they die. The answers to the reasons like with the boy. Who doesn't know much and doesn't want to reveal what he does know.

Prodigy - O'Neill is sent to evaluate a planet for possible use as a permanent research station. It doesn't sound too exciting but he tries to make the best of it. His big problem is with the leader of the scientists who is contemptuous of everything military and jealous of his own authority. The guy seems to think that the Colonel is deliberately trying to sabotage his research when things don't go his own way. Meanwhile, Maj. Carter is giving a lecture at the Air Force Academy. While there, she meets a girl who is possibly the brightest human in a generation. The girl is smart but has an attitude problem. Many think she is not cut out to be an officer. The Major thinks her biggest problem is boredom and a failure to come to grips with the sad fact that not everyone is as bright as she. To solve this problem, she gets permission to take the cadet on a visit to the world where the Colonel is doing his thing. The hope is that she will see an actual goal for all of her disciplined study. It works well until a dangerous alien life form is encountered. Both the cadet and the Major have ideas on how to handle the situation but they are mutually exclusive and the colonel has to make a dangerous choice. It may be that the young lady learns the real meaning of leadership and sacrifice.

Entity - A probe sent to a new world goes haywire. It ceases to act under the command of SGC and starts to act independently. It feeds back huge power spikes to the SGC and, as they are attempting to shut things down, it blows the computers there. An alien electronic entity has traveled back to the SGC and all attempts to isolate it are thwarted. Finally, the entity takes over Maj. Carter and uses her mind. It is trying to preserve itself and protect its homeworld. It knows that nobody will willingly hurt Carter. For a while it looks like SGC face the choice of Carter or Earth.

Double Jeopardy - The SG1 team returns to a planet they have been to before but they find they are not welcomed. Instead, the locals turn them in to the Ghoul, Chronos. Chronos is glad to have the prisoners; he had in the past vowed vengeance against the SG1 team. He proceeds to have Daniel Jackson killed. That is when we learn that it is not a real Daniel Jackson. It is a robot. In fact, none of these SG1 team members are the real ones. Instead, they are the robots created some episodes back and which promised not to leave their own world. The boredom got to be too much for them and they had to go exploring on their own. It is up to the real SG1 team to save the day.

Exodus - As the last episode closed, the SG1 team had managed to capture a ghoul mother ship. In this one, they rendezvous with the Tok'ra. Several episodes ago, Apothis managed to slip an agent into the ranks of the Tok'ra. They were aware of this deception and used him to feed Apothis disinformation. Now, they are evacuating the Tok'ra planet and are suckering Apothis in. They have an ambitious plan to destroy Apothis and his fleet by blowing up the star. They don't think small! The plan seems to work except that Tanis, the ghoul agent manages to escape and Teal'c feels honor bound to go after him. This happens while the clock is ticking on the star to be blown up. As the season comes to its cliffhanger end, the captured mother ship just barely manages to escape the exploding star. Apothis escapes also and he has an SG1 prisoner.",1137974400,16,17218,4.562924619864122

1816292,4,B00007JGFY,"The GOOD

1) Better Video

According to the director commentary, season 4 was the first season to use 35 mm film. The improved video appearance is obvious and justifies the purchase. Previous seasons used 16 mm film and always looked grainy and muddy, as if the master film was deteriorating.

Also, the episode ""Entity"" on disk 5 is the first episode that was shot in high definition. Of course, the HD quality was down scaled to 480p, but the video is just as good.

2) No law enforcement screens are shown when you first load the DVD.

3) DVD Extras

Director commentary by Peter Deluise was particularly funny.

The BAD

1) You can't skip the opening MGM sequence

2) Defective Disk

On disk 5, episode ""Exodus"", around 16:30 - 17:30 minutes, the disk appears to have a defect as the screen freezes for a few seconds and then jumps to the next chapter. Attempting to rewind through that time period also causes a jump to the next chapter. Cleaning the disk had no effect.

Per MGM's website, I e-mailed customer service about the defective disk, but got an auto reply message that stated I should contact Sony. I wonder if Sony supports replacing defective disks that are bought from a reseller. The reseller won't replace it because it's been more than 30 days after the purchase.

3) Sound

Even though your home theater receiver may display Dolby Digital 5.1, this series appears to be recorded in stereo. I don't recall hearing any surround sound effects or any real bass improvement when using a subwoofer.",1132790400,2,1515,4.693181818181818

Well...the good guys that is. The 'bad guys' usually succeed in making me hate them, and while there are many...they're varied. From political based Earth humans to eeeevil 'conquer-the-galaxy' aliens...you love to hate them all!

While most shows have a season or two in the beginning that are 'eh, so-so'...the kind of stuff you find yourself excusing because 'it was the first season, they were still experimenting' or whatever...the first season of Stargate here is just as good as the rest of them.

I honestly think that SHOTIMES stupidity has help the show because they would have givin it 2-3 seasons then killed it because they have no vision(IMO).  Thankfully SCI/FI grabed it and ran with it with 8 seasons todate and a suposed 9th and 10th season coming,  i will be spending a lot of money on these box sets.

1816301,5,B00007JGFY,"In this season we were treated to a lot of new developments. Considering team dynamics we are made aware of the importance of Daniel Jackson as he becomes ""the conscience"" of the team. Michael Shanks gives his best performances in the episodes where he actively challenges the authority of O'Neill like ""The Other side"" or ""Scorched Earth"". A lot of episodes in this season focus on Daniel and most of them are excellent. I particularly like the episode called ""The First Ones"" where Daniel becomes the hostage of a young Unas, the creature whose race were first hosts to Goa'uld.

Carter and O'Neill relationship is repeatedly touched but never gets any conclusion and what is more important the love story doesn't become the center of all the stories. Teal'c and O'Neill develop their friendship to the next level.

The humor has become the trademark of the show and in some episodes it is much better than any sitcom I have ever seen. Mostly it is due to Richard Dean Anderson's perfect comedic timing and delivery, but Christopher Judge contributes greatly with his stoic presentation.

From the technical point of view this season is a step forward. Like the previous three it is presented in widescreen 16:9 format but this time the picture is better but still some digital artifacts and a little noise is visible in some scenes. Audio quality is much better since it is true Dolby digital 5.1 surround unlike previous season which were only Dolby surround.",1102636800,3,1463,4.867469879518072

Some great team episodes, some good spotlight episodes for characters, some interesting ongoing storylines.  A few episodes where heavy-handed preaching makes you look for Aesop or your local minister trying to hammer the lesson in.

The loss of executive producer Jonathan Glassner and the addition of several new writers really shows, however they did seem to try (unlike later seasons).

1816315,5,B00007JGFY,"The Replicators.  The Russians.  The Aschen.  These are only a few of the new enemies presented this year, in Stargate: SG-1 (okay, so technically, the Replicators were introduced last year).  These new baddies made a lot of trouble this year for the SGC in what is definitely the best season yet.  We learn more about the Replicators this year when Sam (Amanda Tapping) is brought to an Asgard-controlled planet to help defend the O'Neill, the Asgard's newest and most advanced ship ever.  Also, the Russians retrieve the Giza gate from the bottom of the ocean from when Thor's ship, the Beliskner, crashed, while the SGC is now using the Antarctica gate.  And, 10 years in the future, an advanced race, known as the Aschen, are quietly wiping out the human race by making humans infertile.
These are just a handful of the amazing new stories that occurred this year.  It seems that Col. O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson), Maj. Carter, Dr. Jackson (Michael Shanks), and Teal'c (Christopher Judge) can never catch a break.  This year, not only have their alien enemies become more powerful than ever, especially Apophis (Peter Williams), their enemies on Earth have truly become a threat.  Senator Kinsey (Ronny Cox), the man who tried to shut down the SGC in Season 1, has been linked to the rogue sector of the NID, the civillian organization responsible for the theft of numerous alien technologies over the last few years.
The stories this year are better than ever, especially with an increasing number of arcs occurring.  Episodes like ""Crossroads"" and ""The Serpent's Venom"" were expertly executed, and had immense emotional effects on our heroes.  However, I have to praise the stand-alones this year, especially ""Window of Opportunity"" and ""The Other Side"", which have never been better.
I guess the only thing that I didn't like about this season is that the Asgard were only in one episode, and the Tollan and the Nox were nowhere to be found.  Oh well.
If you have seen the previous three seasons and are still skeptical about this show, I urge you to watch Season 4; I guarantee your interest in this show will quickly increase.
Some other great episodes are:
""Small Victories"", ""Upgrades"", ""Watergate"", ""Point of No Return"", ""Tangent"", ""The Curse"", ""Chain Reaction"", ""2010"", ""Absolute Power"", ""Double Jeopardy"", and ""Exodus"".",1082246400,3,2336,5.0051679586563305

1816317,5,B00007JGFY,"So many good and entertaining things about the entire Stargate series make it my favorite television show I have ever seen.  This season continues and expands on all these things through some truly amazing, humorous, in some cases powerfully emotional episodes, while at the same time adding something new to the mix: the annual super-whimsical episode.  Season 4's is Window Of Opportunity.
While the episode's overall plot is serious, and stellar even by Stargate standards, the episode goes beyond even the great humor of O'Neill's constant wisecracks when it explores the possibilities of what crazy things a person could do if they knew they could do anything they wanted for a day and soon afterwards everyone around them would not remember what they had done.  Dang that General Hammond for yelling during O'Neill's backswing! (while driving a golf ball through the Stargate without permission...)",1080518400,,904,5.263888888888889

New to the sets are director commentaries for each episode! While the extras on these boxed sets continue to disappoint, there is at least a little more to be found.

1816319,4,B00007JGFY,"I've always liked Stargate, 4th season is no exception although I did think it might be just a lilttle darker in tone at times. The writers/ producers continue to come up with a wide variety of plots, writing, great sets and some interesting characters.
The most unusual set was in the season opener ""Small Victories"" in which O'Neill and Teal'c do battle with the Replicators on board a Russian submarine, it really is a Russian submarine.
I thought one of the most unusual characters was that of the Goa'uld Osiris, portrayed by Anna-Louise Plowman (the best role I've seen her in). In this one a former colleague of Daniel Jackson's, Sarah Gardner, is finally revealed to have been posessed by the Osiris symbiote after examining some Egyptian artifacts at their University. Plowman does that role so well, its a shame we don't see her more often. You always have Richard Dean Anderson doing his oddball bit, the best guest oddball was Willie Garson in ""Point of no Return"", playing the part of a delusional little guy who thinks he's an alien, turns out he is. That story was fun but definitely not one of the more serious episodes of the season.",1074556800,2,1150,4.72636815920398

What this DVD is offering is unique in that it gives you commentaries for every episodes.  What ever advice they told these writers, directors and others before the commentary should be extended to the rest of the entertainment industries. The lively banter is entertaining and makes you wish you could have been there to lend a hand.  Peter Deluise (who if you are a certain age will remember his stint on 21 Jump Street) was particularly entertaining in his commentaries as a director and creative influence to the series.  In the episode Prodigy he even goaded his fellow commenters to sing the lyrics to the theme song which might not be up for any awards but was a perfect example of the fun they had creating this series.
This was a great season  for any science fiction series, and although one might blame them from ripping off from other plots scattered through out time such as Window of Opportunity which was groundhog day in space, or Beneath the Surface which resembled Metropolis with some dirt they added their own panache.
Richard Dean Anderson, Michael Shanks, Amanda Tappings and Christopher Judge are a each pretty fun to watch.  Shanks shined particularly in `The first One' (enemy mine with an even greater language barrier) and `the Curse'.",1069545600,8,1509,4.8108108108108105

1816333,5,B00007JGFY,"Overall, I think Stargate SG-1 is some of the best TV ever made.  Having said that, the season 4 dvd also has many of its own merits...
I think season 4 is a crossroads between where Stargate SG-1 is coming from (original team, Apophis is the major bad guy, etc.) and where it is going to (different bad guys, metaphysical themes, etc.).  As such, it is highly recommended for fans and longtime viewers.  I don't want to give away material in this review, in case you haven't seen the series, but I think you'll enjoy a few of the surprises and the season finale which will require you to get the season 5 dvd also.
I like a few of the featuretttes on the DVD box-set, esp. the special effects and ""legacy of the gate"" featurettes.  Every disc also features an audio commentary option as part of the ""Special Features"" menu, which is also good for committed fans.",1064707200,19,863,4.443037974683544
1816334,4,B00007JGFY,"Season Four, as many will agree, brings many elements of the series into focus, also introducing some new ""long term"" baddies into the mix (I suppose for ""continuity"" into future shows and seasons). The overall quality of the transfer to digital is great with good colour and imaging. The expanded features including the commentary (long overdue) are nice to have, but not all that impressive.
My concern, as has been expressed by others, lies more in the ""future"" of the series. Seven years seems to be the limit for most sci-fi series, beyond which it just gets played for the sake of the playing, not the stories. While now in the seventh season, it doesn't seem that the Stargate will be shutting down any time soon. I've heard that Anderson is exiting the show as a regular. When a primary player bows out (except it is a purposeful plot device), this generally indicates that it's time to wrap things up. The point, I suppose, is that if the story, the primary arc of the series, doesn't move forward more agressively to a meaningful and satisfying conclusion, we risk a complete meltdown of purpose. B5 was smart storytelling -- they created a whole story and then shot it, ending it when it was time, without continuing because of ratings or any other profit motivation. The old adage: ""Leave 'em wanting more"" is a good rule to follow. Let us pray the producers see the wisdom of a complete story as opposed to milking a good idea beyond the point it ceases being worth the time, effort and expense, which it is now in danger of becoming.",1064275200,5,1547,4.629090909090909

I think Sci-Fi has a bad track record, but the 1st Sci-Fi season wasn't too bad.  I've been a little disappointed in season 7 so far.  Jack's missing too often and all the majors seem to be off a little.  I guess it happens to all shows.  A few more years before we his rock ""star trek"" bottom.

1816337,4,B00007JGFY,"The worst thing about the series on dvd is that one must wait a heck of a long time before you get to see more. But I'll whine later, in private, where it won't annoy anyone.
The dvds are great quality, and I haven't had any reading difficulties with them since the Season 1 set. *NOTE: I'm using my PS2 to view these, so if you have a dedicated dvd player, you might have different results. If you're using a PS2 also, well, it'll work fine after Season 1.
For light sci-fi, SG-1 is really hard to beat. The characters are entertaining, the dialogue is interesting without being exceptionally simplistic, and Rick Anderson and Christopher Judge give great comedic relief.
*SPOILER* The exploration of Jack and Samantha's relationship, and why they aren't pursuing it, is a GREAT change from the tired Remmington Steele/X-Files ""we're in love but won't admit it because it would be weird"" shtick. I was glad to see them admit how they felt (albeit under duress) and come to obviously temporary terms with it. It was well done, and blended expertly with something they'd done in a previous Season 4 episode. Great stuff.
Must note that this is LIGHT sci-fi, in a fun-over-realistic setting. Sort of pulp-action stuff, if you will. But don't dismiss its hitting power, because they'll sneak in a powerful scene when you aren't expecting it, and you'll find yourself wondering when they got inside your guard.

My favorite thing about this new set is that they've finally decided to include audio commentaries with the episodes. These are my favorite DVD feature of all time.

Season 2 was better, however some of the episodes get painful after watching them more than 3 times, but it did have some extremely good episodes like 1969, The Fifth Race, A Matter of Time, and Secrets. Season 3 might not have episodes like the 4 I mentioned above, but I think almost all the episodes were good, which makes it even better in general. Season 4 Is the best seeing it has memorable episodes like Upgrades, Window of Opportunity, 2010, and Exodus. Plus all the other ones were good. Now with season 5, there were quite a few episodes that I absolutely loved like Enemies, 2001, 48 Hours, The Tomb, Failsafe, and Between Two Fires.
