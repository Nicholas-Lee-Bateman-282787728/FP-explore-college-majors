7811079,5,6301334361,"If you like Eddie Constantine you will like this movie. He is corny and so unreal its plain funny. I use to watch these movies with friends late night TV. So, it's a farce, but fun. When I traveled to Spain in 1970 was I surprised to see his name and picture on
a movie theater marquee.",1385424000,,286,4.035087719298246
7811080,2,6301334361,"This tape appears to have been made at least 15+ years ago.  The referenced navigation texts by Mr. Gonder are no longer in print.  Unfortunately, the approach is to recite rather than to teach.  Complex subjects are covered in haste.  No summaries are made for detailed subjects like lighting or signals.  The only purpose this tape served was to convince me to allocate more preparation time for the test, which I appreciated.  Recommend some of the newer versions by Magic Lamp's Safe Boating Series.",1041724800,4,503,4.928571428571429
