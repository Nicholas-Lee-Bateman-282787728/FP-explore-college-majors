8115079,4,B000EWC55W,"I have been in pain for two decades, not so much now. While deployed overseas, I had my knee injured, I had my foot injured. I come home and I injure my back, then my neck. I tried to get back into shape, I tried returning to the workout routines that I grew up doing, that the Military taught me. I tried, and because of the pain, it was not possible. In a desperate last attempt to try anything, Several months ago I discovered Chi Kung aka. QiGong, I didn't believe that it would work, but I bought a book. About month later I bought a QiGong DVD on Ba Duan Jin ""Eight Pieces of Brocade"", and it helped. I no longer have to wear braces on my knees, my back may still be stiff, but it does not hurt all the time, my neck is better, I can now turn my head to the left without pain, I no longer dread what needs to be done. Bamboo Mountain Chi Kung is a nice follow up to what I had already been doing. It would be a good beginning for the elderly or those looking for a gentle workout routine while recovering from an illness or injury.  It is not a heavy workout, but gentle and flowing exercise routine. Bamboo Mountain Chi Kung could be the beginning to what you are looking for in a workout program.",1421452800,4,1204,4.080168776371308
8115080,5,B000EWC55W,This tape was very easy to follow. It helps me practice. I would recommend this as a supplement to a Qigong class.,1399248000,2,114,4.2272727272727275
8115081,5,B000EWC55W,"I wasn't expecting much when I ordered it but this was hands down one of the best chi kung videos I ever bought. It was beautiful the way they gave you the philosophy
while they were practicing chi kung. I got it on vhs but the quality was  no problem. The music and surroundings were beautiful and the instruction was good.",1318550400,4,324,4.311475409836065
8115082,4,B000EWC55W,I love the Chi Kung form...felt CHI with every move...very informative but poor DVD quality...looks like a copy of an old video.,1270080000,3,128,4.863636363636363
8115083,1,B000EWC55W,"The narration and demonstrator were uninteresting, the instruction was muddled and non-compelling, and seemed to assume too much about the viewer's previous knowledge of their method. We could barely make it through. Watched it once and now it's a dust collector.

We recommend Terence Dunn's meditations instead. (We are not affiliated with Terence Dunn, we just really enjoy the videos.)",1259193600,,389,5.483333333333333
8115084,5,B000EWC55W,"I'm a student of Joi and Betty and have been for over 13 years and I do this form. Watching this form on film with the peaceful

settings, the beautiful grounds on which it was made and the soothing voice of the narrator- Joi- makes a person really want to learn this beautiful, yet easy to learn, form. The photographer- Perry - did a superior job of capturing the simple graceful movements and scenery. It's a job well done.",1142467200,8,426,4.3924050632911396
8115085,5,B000EWC55W,"I took a alult education course with a woman who has studied under Betty Sun, and recommended the video. Many people do not believe the true benefits of this simple to do exercise. Relaxation, better health and mind are real rewards for this exercise. Its easy to do, whether you are fit or not, young or old you can do Chi Kung. I cant say enough about this video. I only wish it was on DVD as well!",1096070400,7,400,4.141025641025641
