7573021,4,B019ES0YRC,"Though I'm glad that ViZ finally re-released Pokemon: The Movie 2000 since it's original release, it brought back a flood of memories.

The only issue I had with this release, the DVD does not contain Pikachu's: Rescue Adventure.  The Pikachu Short that was on the initial release.  So if you're buying this for the movie, it is an awesome release, though if you're buying it for both, try and buy the original release.",1454803200,8,419,4.712328767123288

7573039,4,B019ES0YRC,"If you owned the VHS then you will be slightly disappointed as it does NOT contain the added Pikachu Movie in the beginning. It is clearly the 'made-for-tv' version of the movie. However for opting to have the DVD for easier access, and easier to show my daughter, it is a great purchase - Especially for the price as thanks to Pokmon GO all prices for Pokmon items seem to have skyrocketed.",1470528000,3,391,4.444444444444445

7573053,3,B019ES0YRC,"PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING DISCLOSURE PRIOR TO BUYING! - If you are looking for English subtitles/caption, 5.1 surround sound, Pikachu Shorts or any extras - THIS RELEASE IS NOT FOR YOU AS IT DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY!

This version is a re-release of the first three movies on Blu-Ray & DVD in its original theatrical widescreen format. You get the complete, uncropped footage of the Pokemon movies the way it was meant to be seen!

Video: The footage you see in this version is from the remastered ""HIGH DEFINITION"" films that was done by the Pokemon Company years ago in Japan, although you get English title cards, English credits, and the same EDITED version of all three movies. Note: the quality isn't TRUE HIGH DEFINITION, it is an upscale from the standard source.

The image isn't much of an upgrade, to be honest. Although the colors are slightly brighter and the image is a bit cleaner, the previous Warner Bros. edition was a sharper - not much of a difference from this new version but it was noticeable to me, especially if you are a videophile like me.

So if you don't have the previous out of print version, or if it's damaged/lost, then you may want to purchase this one. If you are a collector and must have every version that there is out there, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?! GRAB IT NOW! Otherwise, it really isn't worth the ""upgrade"".

Here is a comparison of the previous cropped, fullscreen movie and the new widescreen movie:
[...]
Audio: This is the most disappointing thing. For some reason the audio was downgraded to 2.0 stereo mix (the Warner Bros. version had 5.1 audio). Meanwhile the Australian re-release version for the first two movies has 5.1 audio and 2.0 for the third movie. By the way, there are no director's commentary tracks or any other languages.

Subtitles/Caption: The back of the cover says it was English subtitles but there are NONE ON THE SOURCE.

Menus:
The menus for the DVD version are still images with just two buttons: PLAY and SCENES. The same goes for the Blu-Ray version but there are a few moments of the movie that you get to see before it goes to the still motionless menu.
- The scenes menu is just just simple as well, 14 chapters that are numbered and that is it! (The number of chapters varies per movie)

Here are images of the menus:

Extras: None on the source! There are no Pikachu Shorts, although it is stated in the description of the listing that the Pikachu Shorts are included. I suggest you buy a cheap version of the Warner release, and if you already have it then keep it.

8745009,5,B019ES0YRC,"I had originally planned to own Pokmon 3: The Movie and Pokmon: The Rise of Darkrai and no other Pokmon films, but I changed my mind sometime after watching Diancie and the Cocoon of Destruction, Hoopa and the Clash of Ages, and Volcanion and the Mechanical Marvel on YouTube a few months ago. This movie is quite a delight, especially with Lugia's song and the clash between the legendary birds. I now plan on owning all the Pokmon films that were made before Pokmon The Movie: I Choose You (plus the 2 TV specials, Mewtwo Returns and The Mastermind of Mirage Pokmon). I watched Pokmon The Movie: I Choose You once on YouTube and I didn't care for it.",1529971200,,652,4.487394957983193
