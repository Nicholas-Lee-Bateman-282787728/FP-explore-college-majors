7892309,5,6305510865,I like the acting and story. I found that it could have been a movie about things happening today. A sad but true fact.,1357516800,,119,4.0
7892310,5,6305510865,"This is an excellent movie with a very interesting topic, namely freedom of speech. The Defenders had to defend a client whom they did not like on his right to say what he wished even it was extremely distasteful. They were able to go after him on inciting violence in impressionable minds so they could help the family of the victim of the violence. The acting in the film is top notch. I think Beau Bridges and Martha Plimpton were excellent in their roles. E. G. Marshall had died before this movie was made, but a very respectful tribute was paid to him at the end of the film. I was so glad that I was able to see these movies. Another series was made on television called The Defenders, but I personally found that series to be ridiculous and it did not deserve the name, The Defenders.",1350518400,,792,4.358108108108108
7892311,5,6305510865,"An excellent movie dealing with the use and abuse of the First Amendment by a hate group bent on expelling minorities from the American community. It shows how young impressionable minds can be brainwashed into believing that killing dissenters is moral and useful for this country. A legal thriller with lots of tension, suspense, believable sympathetic characters, and a gripping theme. The acting is first rate--especially Beau Bridges' climactic performance (a gem)--best he's ever done. Above average.",1147564800,2,506,5.584415584415584
