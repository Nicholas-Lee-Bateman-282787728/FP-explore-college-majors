I can name new movies all day that will never for whatever reason be shown here in the States. If we produce a movie and it's not distributed worldwide within a week or so, all the offended countries are screaming unfair and racism. I would love to see ""Female Agents"" (French) or ""Last Bullet"" (Australian) or ""Neger Neger Schornsteinfegger"" (German).
I know we are a poor backwards country, but I do know we could scrape up a couple of dollars....sorry euros for a DVD that's in every region except Region 1. I know Amazon will not let this review go through, but I for one am really frustrated finding new movies that I read reviews for, but never hope to see.",1367020800,2,836,4.470588235294118
8478251,4,B005LKHA70,"The setting for this film is the Napoleonic invasion of Catalan in 1808. At the Battle of the Bruc, legend has it that a lone drummer boy played his drum to such an effect, that the echoes of the mountains convinced The Grand Armee that they were facing a far superior force.  Actually heavy rain had hampered the French and the defenders had time to get better organised and included Belgians as well as mercenaries. In the fog of battle the Catalan irregulars were able to inflict the first defeat that Napoleon had known.  Whilst hailed as a saviour in Spain, in France he was demonised as a devil and angered Napoleon so much that he ordered that the head of Juan the drummer boy be brought to him.

So an elite squad is sent into Montserrat to get and kill him. The methods they use make the trials of William Wallace (in the `Braveheart' film that is) look like a minor inconvenience. They really are ruthless. Along the way we have a French journalist a plethora of part players and some gritty violence. Juan does a runner after realising they mean business but it is not until he realises he will have to face them that things start to get more gothically interesting.

This is a very well made film; I particularly like the fact that the French speak French and the Spanish their own tongue with a shanty in English thrown in for good measure. The weaponry is also very interesting with even a primitive rocket launcher and a double cross bow. The direction is spot on and the French are initially portrayed as universal baddies, but soon balance and passion creep in.

The couple of flash backs to the battle use a shaky camera technique which some commentators felt was unnecessary, but I would have liked to have seen more of the battle. All in all a confident, well made, acted and shot film, but whilst there is a lot of action it is more the one on one variety and not a Napoleonic war epic. The extras include a `making of' and `The Story Behind the Legend'.",1324944000,3,1975,4.45983379501385
