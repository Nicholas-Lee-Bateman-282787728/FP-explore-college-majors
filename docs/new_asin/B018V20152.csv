7556342,5,B018V20152,"Tatiana is amazing, the camera work is amazing, the writing is fantastic, the premise is fantastic, and the creativity involved with having the clones appear together is just great. Not sure of her name right offhand, but the actress that plays Tatiana's characters WITH Tatiana is one of the hardest working people in show business.
I personally fended this show off for quite some time. I figured it just couldn't be that great.
It's great enough that I've seen every episode from Seasons 1-3, several times, and I'm pre-ordering season 4, AND I have it all on blu-ray. One of my very favorite shows of all time. Not sure if I'm glad I waited or not, but it really is fantastic. There's no taking away from Tatiana's physical beauty either. But you gotta admit: Helena is the absolute best.",1458691200,68,792,4.705035971223022
7556343,5,B018V20152,"I realize that season 4 doesn't hit BBC America until April 14th, but I guarantee it'll be 5 stars.  No doubt in my mind.  If you haven't watched this show, you need to.  Right now.  Seriously, stop what you're doing and watch it.  As the reviewer before me said, start S1E1 and kiss your weekend good-bye.  Can you finish 3 seasons in a weekend?  Yes.  I promise that you can and you will.  Once you experience the shock and awe that comes with watching Tatiana Maslany, you'll become a craven addict and then you'll come back here and tell me how right I am.  You're welcome in advance.  ;)",1458518400,49,592,4.339449541284404
7556344,4,B018V20152,"OK, if you're reading this, then chances are you're going to watch Season 4 no matter what I say, particular as you know darn well that there is no way in the universe I could possibly have seen season four yet as it doesn't exist. But if you haven't seen this show, go check out season one, in my opinion one of the best shows ever made. And if you like that, continue on to season two. Season three, well, I felt there was a bit of a slump there, but I'm still hooked and still ready and eager for season four to come along. And if you like season three, well then check this one out too. FYI, only truly useful thing I can say is this. Great show, but it's a serial, and the less you know coming in the better. Start with season one, episode one and watch them in order. Good luck! And I hope you enjoy the show as much as I have.  .",1457481600,14,836,3.9467455621301775

7556352,5,B018V20152,"This was one of the best acted and story line I have ever seen in a series. The multiple acting parts of Maslany are so incredibly convincing: how did she ever pull it off so flawlessly?. Kudos also to the makeup artists who did wondrous things as well. The hair, eyeshadow, and various facial hues gave each sestra a distinct personality. The camera work of several sestras sitting together was a marvel in itself. Well done to all who lent their gifts in making Orphan Black such a remarkable series!",1522368000,,502,4.588888888888889

7556368,4,B018V20152,"I really like this series, I am just disappointed it keeps getting more and more extreme with the violent, gross scenes. Not my thing, but I like the series storyline and characters a lot. I have to say that I have grown to unexpectedly adore Donny in this season. He has made me laugh out loud with his surprising break through humor. I also have a lot of respect for the main actress who is able to adeptly and without hiccup play a large variety of roles. Overall, it's a great series, just have to turn my head at the icky parts.",1518393600,,533,4.235294117647059

7556374,5,B018V20152,"A little confusing at first but that is what keeps me watching OB. Hats off to Tatiana Maslany she should get 274 awards for this.  She was absolutely amazing and I'm so impressed that she played all these charectors and played them well.  I watched all 5 seasons in 2 days.  I plan on watching season 5 slower because I am going to be disappointed theres no season 6. Cant wait to see more of this directors movies.  But I definatly don't want to leave out Felix..... There are no words to describe how adorable and how great his acting was in all 5 seasons.  He had to be able to change gears as well as Tatiana to cater to all the ""Sistra's"" How amazing",1515628800,,656,4.216

It's like hellloooo this chick is prego with twins, why is no one checking on her and spending time with her.

7556556,5,B018V20152,"The one criticism I could make for the last couple seasons of Orphan Black is that it took on more of a soap opera vibe.  I didn't really mind though, because unlike most soap opera-heavy sci fi (ie American sci fi), the acting was just extraordinary-- it was never a series about a bunch of pretty people dicking around while the world building falls to sh.  But this season, in conjunction with the fun soap opera stuff of the clones, there's also a renewed focus on the plot (the neolutionists).  The series has returned to its sci fi roots and imo it's really the complete package.",1491523200,,585,4.5

Sarah, takes her bag, visits her apartment, and assumes her identity. Strange events occur and she uncovers the truth - there are other clones like her which were made in an experiment. Some clones are closely monitored, while some found their way out of the experiment.

The lead actor does an excellent job in playing various roles. The first and second season are really well made but I found the show to go downhill after that - too complex/exotic plot unfolds. As if the original script was made with a certain idea in mind for the first couple of seasons and then they hit a wall and had to invent some new not so well made content.",1491436800,4,779,4.60431654676259

But the story line is getting irritating & old. Constant betrayals & really foolish alliances with sworn enemies - this is what happens on series that soon fail. I'd hate to see that happen to this one. And yes, where is Marion Bowles? I was very happy to see Michele Forbes enter, but she never made an exit - she just disappeared!

The series itself is fascinating, gritty, realistic (with its Sci-Fi-Fi set and setting) with good supporting characters and decent scripting.
The Amazon stream is quite good and I like the updates they just made to this service, it allows you to easily select the image quality or the amount of bandwidth you will use (which is important to my neighbor who has the cheapest possible Internet service so they are always fussing about not using too much bandwidth and this new feature will make it very easy for them to save money) and you can get a quick snippet on each actor which I really like.",1489795200,2,812,4.645833333333333

Tatiana Maslany of course deserves a ton of credit for its success -- I often forget that the same actor is playing such disparate characters as Alison and Helena. It just does not seem possible. This season, the Introduction of a new ""sestra"" and the development of the character of Beth Childs through flashbacks gave Maslany even more to work with. But other cast members were also fantastic; Art just keeps getting more soulful and intense, and this was for sure Donny's season to umm, shine? Felix is a bit absent in the early episodes as he is exploring other sides to his identity, but the introduction of a new character on that side of the plot is quite hilarious and touching as well. The season, (hope this is not a spoiler) ends on a nail-biting cliffhanger, setting us up nicely for the last and final installment slated to air on BBC America in April 2017.

In Season Four they did just that by filling in back stories, using flashback sequences to great effect, and advancing the show's storyline. Because they did, we learned exactly why Det. Beth Childs committed suicide - not because she was ""too brittle"" or ""broken"" but to save her ""sisters."" It was an act of self sacrifice that made her character not only more appealing but also more real and her willingness to do that provides the audience with a justification for why the clones are so willing to put themselves at risk for their ""sisters.""
In addition, the writers introduced a new clone character - the mysterious MK - and gave the ""beauty professional"" Krystal Goderitch a lot more to do this season. That was a big plus for me because Krystal brought just the right amount of levity to what was - on the whole - a pretty serious body of work. On top of that, the writers brought to life a truly evil woman who is out to do away with all the ""sisters"" to advance her own technology and seize control of the corporation that created them. Evie Cho is everything you want in a villain: She's beautiful, ruthless, and an A-level schemer.
The series just keeps getting better and better in my opinion despite the fact that the writers tend to kill off characters that I really enjoy watching. Still, that's not a terrible thing because the deaths are not simply gratuitous but advance the storyline. It's because they do that I am willing (well, almost...) to forgive the writers for getting rid of some of those characters.
Well plotted, brilliantly acted, and tightly directed, Season Four is another winner and I can't wait for Season Five.",1477267200,2,1747,4.620578778135048

I watched the show after binging on The Blacklist and was disappointed that the sistras are always reacting to situations, always behind, (unlike Red who is always ahead). It made them look very amateur and over four seasons the writers still haven't developed Sarah's character into a ""force de jour"", with good judgement, great investigative skills and so on.

7557133,5,B018V20152,"From Ginger Snaps 2, up to this time of Orphan Black season 4, Tatiana Maslany is a master at her craft. Taking on multiple parts and multiple rolls, she is each and every one of her creations. So complete is her ability to convince us of absolute, in your face changes from one character to the next. That suspending disbelief is not an issue at all. She takes each of her Orphans to be separate and autonomous from the hive as a whole, while keeping the underlying bond of genetic clones always at the edge, bubbling just below the surface. It is a great ride. Good writing and rolls makes for a lot of the work done by actors to be more solid and believable than the same with poor material. Tatiana is a master of her art. I just do not know which of the Orphans I would fall for. She must be amazing to talk with. I would love to watch the making of one scene with multiple Orphans in it. I have watched the behind the scenes making of a few of these. But to follow her around from the beginning of a episode to the end. If I was 50 years younger I'd ask her for a date. Even if we sat and talked for an hour, I would have one hell of a check off on my bucket list. Bravo Tatiana, you are the actors actor, and holding yourself above the tabloid smut cannons only makes you more admirable. My daughter wants to be an actor... I tend to refer to you as what I hope she does with that desire. Tatiana must have a blast with all this great material. I'm hooked.",1475280000,,1463,4.083333333333333

Brilliantly written, acted and directed Orphan Black is the modern day Fringe with a twist. One thing is certain, you will never be bored with any of the characters. I actually appreciate them all; but, in particular the suburban couple and Helena. Tatiana Maslany is a treasure trove of talent, supremely gifted to portray all of the sisters. Each has her own personality and motivation, but the entire cast are pros and make this an enjoyable rollercoaster ride. Can't wait for Season 5. Finally, Tatiana wins herself an Emmy (about time).",1474848000,,648,4.794642857142857
7557166,4,B018V20152,"Season 4 became a little stretched in parts, largely due to expanding too far from the core conflicts. The overall epic
is excellent and the lead continues to astound in her diversity and adaptability. The isolated island theme is a bit hokey
and stretches credibility too far. The closer the clones are to actual day-to-day conflicts, the better the plots unfold
with credible challenges.",1474848000,,389,5.09375

Hats off to the writers, producers, cast and crew.  Tatiana is amazing!  I hope you guys keep it coming.  You are a nice diversion at the end of a long day.

She plays all the clones so believably you forget that they are all the same actress. She must be exhausted--she never gets a break. I'd love to see a behind the scenes on how they get all those clones in one scene. The other characters are equally wonderful. Felix! You are adorable! And Scott! I want to play Agricola with you, man! Cal, where'd you go? Please come back! Delphime, you suck. Paul(crying noises). I occasionally get lost in the science-y stuff, but I think this is intentional.

It would have been nice to have a bit more of her in this season. I get it, though.",1473724800,,383,4.565217391304348

Is this so surprising since they are always being set-up after following Beth's stupid advice? Her character needs to be killed. Helena is the family's only saving grace. The scene were Beth was in the helicopter cocking her gun pretending like some stones to get the job of taking care of Rachel was hilarious, because clearly she is out of her depth!

And Maslany is quite incredible at acting up to 7 versions of her character, sometimes one clone impersonating another. Some flashes of unnecessary violence and Season III was tedious in the middle as it digressed to bring in a whole new set of characters and situations.

Her ability to portray a down and out hustler (Sarah), ditzy suburban soccer mom, cop, brilliant scientist, Eastern European psycho, cold hearted corporate honcho, manicurist, and, believe it or not, additional smaller roles, amazes me.

7557299,5,B018V20152,"Tatiana Maslany's supremely nuanced array of multiple-clone personas must rank as the finest acting performance within any TV series.  She deserves every award, as does the show as a whole.  Nothing else out there grapples so believably with the socio-moral nightmare of bio-tech driven by corporate malice.  The show's premise, that human destiny lies in the hands of unregulated lab techniciansperhaps even unbeknownst to us todayis far scarier than more blatantly futuristic sci-fi.  We already have the capacity, as MK's 'Dolly the Sheep'-masked-character reminds us, to make sheep of the human race.  Season 4 sets up the unmissable final season, coming next year.

Tatiana Maslany is excellent as always, and is more deserving of every award that she is eligilbe for than anyone else on the planet. The rest of the cast is excellent as well, and Jordan Gervais gave us more insight to Felix this year. He gets better with each and every appearance on screen.  The scenes with the Hendrixes are also more and more entertaining. Maslany and Kristain Bruun have great on screen chemsitry.

7557373,5,B018V20152,"Orphan Black continues to astonish.

The fourth season finds the Clone Club back at the beginning of the story - and Neolution looming large - as we learn about Beth Childs and what she had learned before she felt she had to commit suicide. We also meet M.K., a new clone who had been helping Beth and was, according to the Helsinki graphic novel, around even before that. M.K. has managed to simultaneously take herself off the grid and maintain serious cyberspying, and gathering information.

Into the mix is added Evie Cho who has replaced cloning with biotech in hopes of furthering Neolution's aims while saving her own life.

Meanwhile, Sarah, Alison, Cosima and Helena are facing different trials: Sarah has managed to lose brother Felix's confidence in her (while he's also found his biological sister, Adele); Cosima's research and trials have been thwarted; Alison and Donny are victims of a play by a crooked cop, and Helena is living in the wilds.

The plot is as convoluted as ever, though the best episodes are mostly based on single characters (one on Beth; one on Sarah's night of blowing off steam).

The writing remains at as high a level of quality as ever; the ideas developed are shocking and yet so completely plausible; the performances (including all six clones - Krystal is back and so close to the truth and yet so far away that it's amazing - by Tatiana Maslany) are terrific and the effects work is seamless.

For my money, Orphan Black is the best show on TV right now (it's more twisted than Mr. Robot and more compelling than Game of Thrones - though not by much).

The season four DVD set includes four very good featurettes - though no audio commentaries, yet. John and Graeme, there had better be commentaries on at the fifth season premiere and series finale on the next set or there will be hell to pay! (Just sayin'...)",1472515200,4,1857,4.677914110429448

7557415,5,B018V20152,"Tatiana Maslany is the most incredible, refreshing, talented, beautiful, funny, and versatile actor I have ever seen or could ever dream up. This show is intense and thought-provoking, exciting, and tackles a lot of issues that might be too ""sci-fi"" for some people, although they probably aren't that far away from happening in 'real' life. But the real catch for me is basically just to see what Tatiana can do! For many of the scenes, there are multiple clones interacting with each other, but it is just Tatiana, acting to a stand-in. Then doing the scene as the next character, and the next, etc. She is doing the work of up to 5 people in the same scenes sometimes  - and then they have to splice everything together without any of us noticing a difference! You really believe in each character, she plays them with so much authenticity in every movement, accent, clothing style, facial expression, and she never misses anything, not even the tiniest little detail, about which character she's playing in every moment. And they love to throw crazy curve-balls out of nowhere, so I've learned to really watch it intensely.

It's rarely a lead performance, because stars carry too much baggage into each role.  I don't know how she does it, and I might not believe it if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes and heart, but Tatiana Maslany pulls off ten or so characterizations of that caliber in ""Orphan Black.""  As all the Leda clones, she is utterly convincing as genetically identical individuals raised in different cultures, different countries, different belief systems, economic strata, political conditions--all the elements of ""nurture"" that contribute to our being who we are.  When the clones interact with (and impersonate) each other on the screen, we don't see great performances or technical wizardry (both of which are there), we see Helena, Cosima, Sarah, Krystal, Rachel--and all the other ""sestras.""  We see them as real people, scrambling to understand and survive a dangerous and mystifying situation that is not of their making and mostly out of their control.  Brilliant stuff.

For those who like shows that warp your mind as you try tofollow the twisted plot, this would be great for you ... one person playsa bunch of the female characters which is really impressive to watch also since each character is very unique in terms of skils, maturity and personality.... gotta say the Helana is my favorite character followed closely by Casima I HIGHLY recommend you start watching with season 1 episode 1 though otherwise you will likely struggle a lot to understand what is happening since the storyline is reliant on theinformation you get starting with the first episode.",1470960000,,752,4.654135338345864

7557470,5,B018V20152,"Having just watched the entirety of season four of Orphan Black in the span of a few days, I will say this was certainly a step in the right direction after what was a troublesome season three. Many of the elements fans weren't happy with are quickly removed or downplayed (I'll avoid saying anything that might spoil what happens). We also get to know more about some of the clones that haven't been featured as much as the main few. Also we meet some new ones as well. There's plenty of humor, heartbreak and even some horror.

My only major complaint is that the show is hinting at some characters having psychic powers. In my opinion this is a realm which doesn't fit the ""hard science"" nature of Orphan Black and shouldn't be expanded upon.",1470787200,,745,4.518518518518518

7557507,3,B018V20152,"I found season 4 of Orphan Black to be a bit disappointing.  It's hard to say what's wrong with without giving away what happens, but I'll just say it lacked a lot of the dark humour of past seasons, and the thriller aspect that really made the show so good.  Tatiana Maslany still does a brilliant job playing multiple characters, each with their own personality, but some of well at least in my eyes, more interesting characters, don't have a great deal of screen time. There really weren't any great new clones either, just one who wears a sheep mask and to be honest I just found a little annoying. The season starts off as well with an episode about Beth, we have a number of flashbacks throughout the rest of the season with Beth as well.  There is a worm in this season that's pretty cool but the plot doesn't really use it to it's full potential. Likewise we had potential for some great prison scenes but we barely even visit there.  There was a lot of phone ringtone sounds throughout each episode which was a bit annoying too.",1470528000,,1037,4.442105263157894

My parents left Canada years ago to raise a family. We all became successful Republicans in the US. All of my relatives in Canada became nothing. There is a line in the show that says Republicans  give you nightmares. Well, Canadians don't like it when someone doesn't think as little as they do.

While I wish that the writers would at times go deeper instead of just bringing on new clones, I still think that this is an awesome show. The only thing not right, and may cause difficulties for others as well as me, is that the subtitling is extremely sporadic. There can be whole paragraphs of dialogue, often, with no subtitles. Since there isn't always really clear enunciation by all the characters, I can miss what is said. Other than that, LOVE  it!",1470268800,,631,4.439655172413793

But, the neolutionists and all the other evil subgroups are just too much for me.  I like a nice clean story. But it seems to be the wave with Sci-fi to have alot of short stories intertwined with the main plot. I guess that's to make it more like a comic book and for people with short attention spans.

I am aggravated by this, it has happened so many times on so many shows I watch regularly, Grimm, The Originals, Vikings, Teen Wolf, and Orphan Black. I really get into each season and episode and anxiously wait for the next episode and they suddenly stop coming in. I pay for Prime which I'm still getting screwed on seeing how Amazon only allows maybe the first 2,3 seasons to be free and every other season after that you have to pay. I'm about ready to cut Amazon off completely, the way I see it, with so many phone apps coming out where anyone can buy/sell, stream movies, play games, I don't need to hassle with Amazon any longer. Besides they don't care about the customer, anytime I need to speak with customer service there's no contact number to call, it's only email. I figure the reason they have email as customer service is so they can send back and automated response. I've complained about this numerous times and each time I receive the same response word for word, so that tells me they leave it up to a machine to deal with their customers.",1469577600,,1125,4.519607843137255

7557649,5,B018V20152,"Sarah Manning and her clone-sisters have defeated the threat of an illegal attempt to create an army of cloned soldiers, and it seems like maybe they might be able to get back to their lives. But the Neolutionists, who want to expand genetic engineering far beyond mere cloning, have other plans. Sarah and her friends, aided by an enigmatic newcomer known as ""MK"", are threatened by different factions within the Neolutionist movement and have to face the possibility of making a deal with the devil just to survive.

The first three seasons of Orphan Black were excellent, with the writers showing unusual self-awareness by slimming down a potentially confusing morass of subplots and factions in the third season to a much more straightforward conflict. The fourth season sees this conflict resolved and a whole new storyline begun, but one very much rooted in what came before. The Neolutionists, an opposing faction established in the first season but soon superseded by other groups, return to prominence and the show goes back into its roots by exploring the character of Beth Childs in greater depth. This is also gives supporting characters like Art (who was a little lost in the third season) more to do.

This results in some focused, dramatically-accomplished storytelling. One episode focuses almost entirely on Beth's life as she discovered she was a clone, meeting Allison and Cosima and then the shadowy MK, with events building to the tragic and inevitable end we are already aware of from the opening seconds of the whole series. Tatiana Maslany is so great in her multiple roles that it feels like we've gone beyond redundant in mentioning it, but she somehow manages to up her game even further in the fourth season with both her portrayal of the doomed Beth and also in the present day, particularly her performance as Cosmia where she adds more nuance, depth and tragedy than ever before.

The fourth season risks getting heavy at times, so as usual relies on the screamingly dysfunctional (and dystopian) domestic adventures of Allison and Donnie Hendricks to draw things back in with jet-black humour. This season they also do a great job of involving Allison and Donnie more in the main storylines (in Season 3 it felt like they were making their own spin-off in the context of the larger show) and tonally varying things up a bit to make things more interesting. Donnie and Felix posing as a gay couple looking to have a baby might be the funniest storyline the show has ever done, especially as Felix reels in Donnie's stereotypical performance. Felix, who also got a little lost in the mix in Season 3, gets more to do this year as he embarks on his own quest to find his biological family. We get a lot more insight and empathy into the ""villains"" of the show this year as well.

Season 4 doesn't really falter at all, although some fans will bemoan a distinct lack of screen-time for Helena (although when she does return, she makes it felt in her own inimitable style) and the total absence of Cal (Michael Huisman possibly busy filming Game of Thrones). Particularly brilliant is the ending, which sets us up with a new villain who is actually an old one: Orphan Black and Game of Thrones have both realised that there is nothing more satisfying than having your ultimate main bad guy as someone you've gotten to know already over multiple years and set up accordingly. Things are set up for what will hopefully be an exhilarating showdown in the final season next year.

Orphan Black's fourth season (*****) sees the show somehow get even better than it was previously. Even in a golden age of television, it is entirely possible that this little SF show from Canada might be the very best thing on TV at the moment.",1468886400,,3749,4.788253477588872

7557729,5,B018V20152,I adore this series!!! Ms. Maslany is a wonderful actress who succeeds within each character as well as falters. She is 100% herself until she plays her clones...then she varies with her ability to become that clone in all it's individual attributes. She plays Sarah with 100% accuracy because that it who we originated with. Her best parts are playing Helena and Cosima. Both require a vigilance for such polar pairs and the do come across within the 75%-85%. Alison is iffy and Rachel is the worst. The trans clone was a fiasco. But it is such a wonderful original series I cannot wait for more.,1468454400,,597,4.6415094339622645

Fee (Felix), Mr. S, Det. Bell, and omg, the hysterically funny, hapless husband Donnie Hendrix.  They are amazing as they interact with the various clones. This season brought us some new characters that I hope we see fleshed out, Ira (a Castor clone) and Crystal another of the ""sestra"" clones, who doesn't think she is a clone and is hilariously investigating what she thinks is a cosmetic company war.
This show could easily get lost in the weeds, but it doesn't the writing and acting are all superb, production values are top notch. If your into thrillers, sci-fi, mystery, and conspiracy shows, this is your ticket.",1468281600,,795,4.888888888888889

7557786,5,B018V20152,"Smart, sexy and just slightly over the top, Orphan Black is the thriller you've been waiting for. It's worth watching this series for Tatiana Maslany alone, but the whole supporting cast is amazing too. Each character is so uniquely convincing that you forget Tatiana is playing more than a handful of characters herself.

The series does reach a point in this season where the Brightborn/Dyad/Neolution storyline gets almost too confusing to bear - but it's worth muddling through the confusion and some of the unrealistic science in this show for the acting alone. Many of the relationships are intense, but there are great moments of comedy and levity provided by Sarah, Helena and",1467763200,,684,5.053097345132743

7557791,5,B018V20152,"I was hooked on this show from the first five minutes of season one (the train platform scene!).  I went on to watch the whole first season in one sitting that went from evening to night to morning.  I have been watching TV since the 1960s and this is hands down my favourite programme ever.

If it weren't for lead actress Tatiana Maslany it would be a great show.  All aspects -- writing, direction, special effects, cinematography, music etc -- are excellent, and the brilliant supporting cast (Jordan Gavaris, Evelyn Brochu, Maria Doyle Kennedy, Kristian Bruun, Kevin Hanchard et al) all give 100% committed performances throughout.

But when you factor in Maslany's performances, the whole thing is lifted to another level.  She has created seven main characters plus numerous lesser ones, and each one is distinct, fully realised and compelling.  She frequently plays one character interacting with another (and sometimes three or four), so convincingly that you completely forget she has filmed the scene in separate takes hours apart, talking to empty space, before the technical wizards put the scene together.  On occasions she plays one character imitating another (i.e. herself imitating herself!), and the viewer can see subtle elements of the imitating character showing through in the imitated.  She combines incredible technical ability with great emotional truth not to mention hilarious comic delivery as Alison, Helena and Krystal (my favourite).  She probably should have had three Emmy awards already, but somehow she has got even better in this fourth Season, and the award is long overdue.

Season Four goes back to the beginning after the spiralling conspiracies of seasons 1-3.  Episode 1 finally puts the spotlight on Beth, whose suicide kicked the whole thing off, and Tatiana Maslany's performance reaches new heights as the detective's life unravels, faced with the truth about her origin, the people who threaten her and her sisters, her escalating drug use, and her troubled relationships.  The tension and drama are maintained throughout the ten episodes, with particular highlights being the emotional climax of episode 6, followed by a long dark night of the soul for at least two characters in episode 7, and a brutal fight between Maslany and herself - as well as a long-awaited reunion - in episode 10.

It's magnificent stuff.  The only negative is that there will only be one more Season after this, but roll on 2017!",1467763200,,2456,5.135678391959799

7557978,3,B018V20152,"Watch it for the acting

The writing got a little tired this season and the series has become fairly formulaic (defeat the big bad leader of the secretive shadowy conspiracy group doing horrible things, only to realize what you *didn't* know is that the *real* big bad is actually *this* person who is part of an even *secreter* shadowy conspiracy group! And they're doing much *worse* horrible things! Hey let's throw a new clone or two into the mix for funsies. Rinse. Repeat.) Also the one big devastating thing that happened this season happened because clone club decided to become temporarily idiotic for no apparent reason. You really don't think to keep a few tissue samples back at the lab just in case, or back up your data to an external hard drive? Really. Jesus that's dumb. The Sestras have had ample opportunity to learn better than that by now.

But I keep watching because Tatiana Maslany is mesmerizing as [f-bomb redacted], and as an actor myself, I appreciate and am mad jealous of the chops required to play all these different people. My brain really gets tricked into thinking there are a good dozen separate actresses running around with that exact face... And then when she plays one clone doing an impression of another, and the degree of accuracy matches up with that character's likely skill level at impersonation (I.e. Con artist Sarah is way better at pretending to be other clones like Rachel or Crystal than Cosima is at pretending to be Allison)? Mind blown.

I hear some of her accents, particularly the Ukrainian one, leave something to be desired by native speakers. But at least she keeps them consistent. The accents don't change over time or bleed between characters. That is really impressive.

Tatiana Maslany is totally believable in all of her characters, sometimes I actually forget that it is the same person playing all the parts of the female clones.  Amazing acting!  We especially enjoy the wittiness and dry comedy of this show, and the outrageous twists to the storyline.

7558107,5,B018V20152,"The writing and acting is superb in this Canadian sci fi series about human cloning.  Lead actress Tatiana Maslany is so good that when she plays different clone characters you forget it is the same actress!  She has created at least 6 major characters and many more minor ones, all with different personalities, voices, mannerisms, accents, not to mention hair & makeup. The show is a technical marvel too as Tatiana as conflicted cop Beth, punk rocker Sarah, Ukrainian assassin Helena, soccer mom Alison,  brilliant scientist Cosima, evil Rachel, and valley girl beautician Crystal interact with each other, 2 or 3 in the same scene. Terrific supporting cast includes the amazing and amusing Jordan Gavaris.

7558219,5,B018V20152,"Simply sublime.  A magnificent accomplishment, ORPHAN BLACK quickly won me over as one of the greatest TV series I have ever  seen.  Two episodes into season 1, I was intrigued.  At the 4th episode I was arrested and disarmed completely.  Like falling in love.  Dreadfully wrenching, delightfully mischievous, marvelously engineered, delicately touching, profoundly passionate, and so beautifully wrought, it always -- always -- leaves me craving more.  One episode per week is not fast enough.  Ten episodes per season is just not enough, period.  The withdrawal kills me.  Tatiana Maslany, in ten distinct roles (so far), several often (incredibly) interacting in the same scenes, is not just astonishing, but is breathtaking.  The sheer range and depth of her performances reaches so far beyond any map of skill or talent that I consider her the greatest and most underrated actress I've ever been blessed to watch.  ORPHAN BLACK has no comparisons.  It works on so many levels, plays in so many genres, that it integrates into an astonishing mirror on humanity.  (To my fellow clone-addicts, keep sharing the passion -- Tatiana needs her Golden Globe, Emmy, Oscar.  NOW.)  I am so grateful that I discovered this series in my searches on Amazon!",1465862400,5,1249,5.1393034825870645

I hope she becomes a break out star in films.
The writing has also improved over a faltering 3rd season [although that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it].

Ari Millen demonstrates that he has that versatility too, as the Castor clones; so kudos to casting.",1465862400,,388,4.720588235294118

To be able to portray so many characters that are all so different is truley a feat I have never seen done by anyone. Beware! Once you start you will not be able to stop.

Tatiana Maslany plays multiple characters and at no time do I think to myself ""oh, this is an actress playing multiple characters."" She IS each one of them. They are all unique personalities, they are all different people. I don't know how she does it. I don't know how the technical people do it, I mean the blending is superb from a CGI perspective. They talk, they touch, they hug. The other actors are amazing. The plot is intriguing. Watch the first few episodes, you won't be disappointed.",1465257600,2,650,4.612068965517241

Makes you wonder what kind of back room deal making goes on in the industry, or what the show creators may have done to piss someone off.

That said, Season 4 is off to a roaring start with twists and turns stuffed with tension, tempered by fits of laugh-till-it-hurts humor like the garage scene with Alison and Donnie.

The idea that a person can declare another his or her property is one I can relate to from a racial perspective, but the writers have yet to make that connection. I hope they do eventually.

That said, I have been watching since the first season and I plan to continue doing so. It's one of the few shows I look forward to every week. I wish I could binge on the whole season at once though, that they release them on a weekly basis is aggravating as hell, but I can't bring myself to wait months before they are all available.

It started out horribly choppy and confusing with poor continuity and a missing main character since the last season, which really sucked. Almost as if the producer went out of their way to spite the fans. It is like WTF just happened, where did my favorite show go, and what is this new show doing now?
It is slow and tame compared to the fast moving intrigue with interlaced comedy I was used to in the first three seasons.
I cannot put my finger on it, but something major changed since the last season in its production quality and not for the better. Did some type of artistic differences situation cause a tiff among the cast?",1465171200,5,692,4.372093023255814

But it didn't, not really, and all those other enviable aspects of the production, not the least the acting, tend to tighten up whatever has become looser. Consider, for example, Episode 8 of Season 4, in which Allison's earnest rehearsal of the church production of ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" is intercut with her husband Donny's being threatened --- tortured, really --- by a Neolutionist thug who's imprisoned with him. Brilliant, and emotionally satisfying. Let me recommend also something relatively new to me: the ""After"" sessions, in which cast members and series creators get to talk about what they do, and there are revelations of ""set secrets"". I've seen this device used as tags on other series, e.g., ""The Walking Dead"", but in the case of ""Orphan Black"" it is, as is the show itself, markedly more intelligent.",1465084800,4,931,4.936305732484076

I thought the third season was kind of weak but it seems like with S4 it immediately got back on track again.

I understand the importance of product placement i n shows but the iPhone and Mac laptop placement is ridiculous this season. Their phones are ringing constantly and the camera focusing on the screen so we can see the texts. Yeah we get it Apple-our iPhone can keep us in touch with each other constantly by calling and texting.  We know we can put it on speaker while we talk so we can do other things. We know we can Skype through our laptops. Ugh,1464825600,6,603,4.423423423423423

I just finished watching episode 6 in this 4th season and like I've claimed in each review made in past seasons...I'll state again... Orphan Black is quite simply the best tv on tv.  Let's just say this sixth episode;  is definitely NOT an Allison-centric comedic relief episode  (actually, no Allison at all) .  Instead, it's a whole new can of worms.

If you're checking the reviews here... considering whether or not, to try OB... STOP!!!  Just STOP reading right now, then run, don't walk to your computer, tablet or TV, get seasons 1. 2. 3. and 4 of OB and BINGE IT OUT!!!

7558745,5,B018V20152,"Love, Love, Love this show!
Tatiana Maslany is a master at playing all the different clones, all with their unique personalities and quirks. She does this so well you can even tell when one clone is impersonating another, truly inspiring. The story of Sarah takes us on a never ending journey as she and her sisters learn about where they came from, why, who created them and why. Sarah's foster brother and side kick, Felix is a joy to watch and as season 4 shows him coming into his own, along with more about Beth, the sister who in a way set the whole journey into motion.
The co-stars and supporting cast are also brilliant and the writers are imaginative without going over the top. Each episode is filled with intrigue, love, compassion and questions, many questions, and some answers. It is also very fast paced, at the end of each episode I'm always surprised that the 40+minutes is already flown by.
My only complaint is that a season is only 10 episodes in length, so in the weeks leading up to a new season I binge watch the series from the beginning and never tire or watching, seeing, learning and discovering something new with each watch and new understanding of the story line.
If you haven't watched this yet I recommend you do so, it's an interesting, intriguing story line that will pull you in in the first 10 minutes.

The bug in the cheek appears to be a MacGuffin and the plots have become even more twisted and confusing than previous seasons (which is saying a lot since even previous seasons required effort to follow).  Also, we need at least one throwaway episode to lighten the excessively heavy tone this season.

I think the confusion has also taken its toll on viewership.  While Seasons 2 and 3 averaged 0.5 million viewers per episode, Season 4 is more like half that.  I'm not so sure that level of viewership supports continuation to Season 5.

From the bottom of my heart,I want to thank everyone involved in this show...its everything i have always wished for in a series..and much more!! this show will tear out my heart one minute then have me in a cornner with a teddy bear terrified to watch whats about to happen next!!! the messsage of unconditional love, forgivness and ACCEPTANCE is strong and we see it at work in every episode!! This show doesnt have the huge budget like network shows,it doesnt get the ""shove it down thier throats"" advertising like most shows and the Actors,crew and creators are still the MOST unreconized talant on television...BUT thats what makes Orphan Black so special!!

Tatiana Maslany is such a great actress as she continues to keep playing new roles within the same television show. Not only does she have to act different clones, but she is able to convince us the audience that she is genuinely talking to a different person although she is simply talking to herself in a sense. I cannot imagine how difficult it is for her to do this and sell it to us, the audience.

A show with a great plot and an interesting universe that lead to many possibilities that are sure to be explored by this show. Orphan black is a great show with great characters and a great setting.

7558900,5,B018V20152,Tatiana Maslany is incredible. I got hooked on this show a few years ago halfway through season one when BBC America was doing a marathon. Since then I've been telling people they needed to watch this show! I was and still am in awe of how seamlessly Tatiana can play so many characters and almost make you forget they're not being played by the same person. Kudos to the directors and editors too as what they are accomplishing is nothing short of remarkable. All the characters are so engaging and well developed. I was so pulling for Tatiana to get the Emmy over Viola Davis but there's always next year and it seems this show is finally getting the recognition it's deserved since season 1! I just bought all of season 4 because I know I'll want to re-watch all of the episodes. I can hardly wait to see sestra Helena again!,1460678400,10,828,4.453947368421052

7558907,5,B018V20152,"Tatiana Maslany is the most criminally underrated actress on TV. Now we see her playing yet another character (2 if we count Beth). She plays 10 characters as easily and as expertly as most play one. Of course the show is nothing short of mind bending. After seeing Ep 1 of season 4, I cannot imagine where it is going now. They can answer questions in a way that merely creates more questions. If you are not watching this show, consider that an major fail.",1460592000,44,458,4.4
7558908,5,B018V20152,"I am a ""cord cutter"" and I liked this show so much that I got an Amazon Prime account and a season pass for the show. Well this Better Call Sol, and Defiance, and well having Prime is kind of cool as well, but this was the one show I knew I was going to have to buy when I cut the cord and went antenna and streaming.

Why this show isn't loaded down with tons of awards is beyond me, if there is a type of show that you like you will find that one of the several story lines is that type of show. Mostly it is drama and intrigue but with enough comedy tossed in to keep it fun, and lots of surprises you won't see coming.

Simply put this is the best show your probably not watching.",1460592000,53,684,3.8439716312056738

First and foremost Tatiana Maslany is amazing and plays each role to perfection.  The whole concept of this show could have easily fallen flat, but with Maslany's amazing acting she pulls it off.  All the supporting characters are equally well developed.  Sit back, binge and enjoy the ride.  It's a wild and unpredictable one with an unimaginable group of characters.",1459296000,2,525,4.591397849462366

8743130,4,B018V20152,"I just finished the last season and it was very entertaining watching Tatiana play all of the clone sisters though some were much better than others you're never seeing one long enough thats its a problem. The plot is about clones, competing forces, issues and the ever present family and/or domestic crisis. A very good supporting cast keeps it together and if theres a fault it would be the humor is not always present but when it is its a real boost to the show. The last season seemed rushed, over the top and pretty devoid of humor. Its a good sci-fi thriller and through the course of the show it was sometimes hard to tell the same person was playing all the roles because the transformations were so good. Overall, it was a 4-star series but the last one is a real push to give it 3-stars. There are a few characters that I found to be annoying and there was much too much of them toward the end. If nothing else, it was worth it just for the uniqueness of the plot and how well it was done by Tatiana. It took us four years to see the entire series so Im copping out with the same review for each because my mind is too blurry to address each one specifically and if you like the first one you will watch the others despite what anyone has to say about it.",1527465600,,1265,4.209876543209877
