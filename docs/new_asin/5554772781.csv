7802377,4,5554772781,"This was a rather well done biography of Michelangelo, and, as it is said, the Artist and Man.  Well done and organized, and I found it interesting how a competition with Leonardo Da Vinci at one point developed, but was oddly never concluded.

So very good, but merely that.",1382486400,,471,5.038461538461538
