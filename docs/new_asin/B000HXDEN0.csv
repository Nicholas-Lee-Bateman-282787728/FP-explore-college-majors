8142030,3,B000HXDEN0,This DVD may feature ECW originals but don't be fooled! XPW was nothing more than a wannabe with terrible commentary and even cheaper production values then the original ECW had. A couple of the matches are actually pretty good and kept this set from being a one star review but a lot of them are a mess. Only the most hardcore ECW fans looking for something a little different should watch this set. Everyone else should stay away.,1360627200,2,432,4.551282051282051
8142031,2,B000HXDEN0,"I thought this DVD was a documentary about wrestlers after XPW closed or even when they left ECW. I was way wrong all it is, is matches from XPW featuring ECW wrestlers. Good matches but that's about it, if you're looking for a documentary this is not it.",1334620800,,255,4.333333333333333
8142032,2,B000HXDEN0,"First and foremost, anyone who says XPW is better than ECW is nuts. If ECW was low budget, XPW is backyard wrestling, the video is sometimes too bright, too dark, there is only commentary with no noise, or only noise without commentary, the camera angles are terrible and the commentators are OK at best. Larry Rivera aka Pat Hoed is the most horrific commentator ever, with broken English rants and lot's of the word ""chico"" thrown in... he is horrid. The matches go from low rent and bad to decent on occasion but I was led to believe this was an ECW alumni show because XPW picked up most of their guys when ECW folded. I would assume some of the matches are that, but most of them are missing something and nothing can re-capture ECW. Sadly XPW has yet to impress with any of it's dvds.",1290816000,2,790,4.380952380952381
8142033,3,B000HXDEN0,This video was more or less a compilation of the three series set of XPW Television shows. This DVD was leading people to think that this was a documentary about the company Xtreme Pro Wrestling. It wasn't. This was basically a teaser trailer/demo video for the three set series of Television tapings.,1242777600,4,301,4.8076923076923075
8142034,5,B000HXDEN0,"This DVD is awesome!!! I don't see why people crap on XPW so much. Most of the mathces are great. The exception is Lizzy Borden vs. Major Gunns, which is included to show The Sandman's debut. Otherwise, a must buy title.",1171411200,2,220,4.390243902439025
