8513638,3,B007AUKGXO,"Poliuto was something of a success in Italy from it's premiere in 1848 soon after Donizetti death. You could certainly not tell that on witnessing this mess of a production on the present DVD. The story is a gripping drama of a hero and his beloved who are about to be cast into the gladiator ring and become Christian martyrs. The tenor in this production Gregory Kunde is past his prime, looks like a grandfather and to make up for lost vocal skills is given to shouts. He is certainly not the manly hero of a Corelli or Carreras both had successful runs as the lead.
Paolina his beloved wife is not yet enticed by this alien religion and is troubled by some feelings for her former lover Severo. The part is sung by Paoletta Marrocu. She is a little long in the tooth and sometimes when pushed the voice becomes brassy but she manages beautiful passages (the best singing of this production). But she is dressed to excess in gowns that make her look like a high end madame and has street-walker floozy make-up. Maria Callas, a famous Paolina of the 1970's would never have appeared so. This is a good strong opera and has some of Donizetti's finest mature writing in it. The finale of Act 3, Paolina' s conversion during the extended and glorious duet with Poliuto is great grand opera.
The 1838 Poliuto, text by Cammarano, was written for the San Carlo Opera in Naples, but it was forbidden by the censors because it dealt with a Saint's life. So Donizetti moved to Paris and rewrote it, text by Scribe, as ""Les Martyrs"", but it was not very successful. But the end was near for Donizetti as he died in 1848 (in an asylum of tertiary syphilis) just before the premier of the original Poliuto at the San Carlo in Naples where it was originally scheduled in 1838. Naples was now a constitutional monarchy and the censor allowed it this time.
In the 19th century it was staged for a series of great dramatic tenors as well as the fine vocal lines of better dramatic sopranos. You certainly would not guess that from this production. Overblown vocalization in the current reading is not only found in the singing of Poliuto and Palolina but also in the strutting around in their Mussolini style uniforms of Felice (governor) and Severo (proconcil). Both of whom belt not sing.
This is a beautiful opera set in 3rd. century Roman held Armenia. Several well sung CDs exist including Callas and Corelli. They give you the masterful music of Donizetti as it should be performed.
p.s The Regia (director) is listed as Marco Spada. That is an unusual name as it is the name of a ballet of 1857 by the Frenchman Daniel Auber. The character Marco Spada is a nobleman who amuses himself running around with bandits and pickpockets and causing all sorta of mayhem. He finally is caught and pays for all his evil doings with his life. I wonder...........",1439856000,,2843,4.576470588235294
8513639,5,B007AUKGXO,"I have never seen an opera production where the magic of the music and the singers trumped an Eurotrash production.  I knew this opera from the Callas recording.  And Callas is someone we have to put aside if we want to judge new singers who have stepped into her sacred shoes. In this instance, we have an American tenor, Gregory Kunde, that thankfully is not known to American audiences, a true Bel Canto expert unspoiled by the star system that rules the Met. Add a superb soprano, Paoletta Marrocu (she does not even have a Wikipedia page)  that has abandoned the silly mad female roles that pollute (pun intended) the operatic canon.  I understand now why Poliuto may be Donizetti's greatest opera.

Unfortunately, the production left quite a bit to be desired,  From Marrocu's Tango/Flamenco pants suit to the cocktail gown with which she goes to her ""martyrdom, looking like a dark haired Evita Peron, to the vaguely metrosexual look of the male characters (focus on the eyebrows), it could have been a disaster.

But the singing.  It raises goose bumps.  I was in tears by the final scene.

It cannot get better than that.",1402531200,9,1130,4.748717948717949
8513640,3,B007AUKGXO,"The singers, orchestra, acting were all outstanding! But, the staging and costumes were ridiculous. The person who did this interpretation probably thought he was a genius, but really demeaned the entire performance. The main characters were dressed like NAZIs who escaped to Argentina. The Roman citizens were dressed like factory workers from the old Soviet Union.  I do not think it would have been difficult to find more appropriate costumes, even on a tight budget. How about the tea service? Was it English, could not have been Japanese. Surprised they did not have Japanese Geisha girls serving tea between Servo and Paulina.

I thought that the singers did an exceptional job in acting, focusing on the content of the story and ignoring the idiotic surroundings. They had a few Roman costumes to let you know it was Roman in theme. It would not have taken much to make the scenes look more compatible with the story. What goes on in the heads of these people who do this? They must think the are smarter than the composer.

The good thing about this opera is that it has subtitles, which can instruct the viewer to enjoy a CD production.

This opera by Donizetti I hope will some day be produced by the MET. It is a great opera that deserves more attention.",1358294400,14,1265,4.710407239819005
8513641,4,B007AUKGXO,"This is the only choice for a DVD of this opera, and, fortunately, it's not a bad one.

Gregory Kunde is excellent in the title role.  He looks a bit long in the tooth and grey in the head to be an ideal hero, but his singing is splendid and his acting good.  He's especially effective in his big second act scena.  My reaction to the Paolina of Paoletta Marrocu is more mixed.  Hers is a very distinctive voice which she manages with excellent technique.  Some of her singing is very fine indeed, but some lines are more etched in acid than limned with honey.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed her performance very much, and I'm sure that I'll return to this DVD again.  Simone del Savio was more routine than remarkable as Severo.  Adrea Papi as Callistene was the weak link in the casting:  an odd vocal tone accompanied by incessant grimaces.

The orchestra and chorus of the Bergamo Music Festival perform capably.  The production itself is an odd mishmash of ancient and modern.  The singers costumes are reminiscent of the Roman Empire reborn under Benito Mussolini. whilst the supernumeraries get costumes of the period in which the action is set:  3rd century AD.  The modern dresses simply look silly with the libretto's tension between Christians and Pagans.  Even sillier is the statue of Jupiter in the second and third acts.  I've knocked off a star accordingly.  The performance uses the critical edition of the score as prepared by the Donizetti Foundation and published by Casa Ricordi

This opera hasn't fared very well in recorded form.  The live performance from La Scala features a tentative and nervous Callas as Paolina; an unsubtle, but rather glorious, Poliuto of Franco Corelli and Ettore Bastianini as Severo; all captured in the restricted sound of an Italian radio broadcast from 1961.  The performing edition is heavily cut, including much of the best part of the title role.  The alternative recording has Katia Ricciarelli and Jose Carreras both past their prime.  Both of their voices at the time of this recording were suffering from the damage inflicted on them by Herbert van Karajan miscasting them in roles for which their voices were entirely unsuited.  And in the case of Mr Carreras, a bout of serious illness had completed the destruction.  The performance under review far surpasses either of the earlier sound-only recordings.  As such, I have no hesitation in recommending it to other lovers of bel canto opera.",1348963200,10,2447,4.878640776699029
