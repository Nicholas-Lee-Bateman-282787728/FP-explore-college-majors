8231296,5,6303814263,"DVD Review: Mondo Macabro version. This picture quality is great despite some s*** but I like s*** and it's in 2:35 ratio. The extras include some actors bios and interviews with producer and director. Yay.

Movie Review: This movie has horribly executed martial arts choreography, bad acting, bloody action, a nit-witted story and corny and obviously fake a$$ special effects. THIS MOVIE RULES!!! All this things I mentioned may be correct but the entertainment value is hella high. Recommended to cult film fans or those who like witchcraft and martial arts action.

Conclusion: 5 stars for the DVD and 4 1/2 stars for The Warrior",1433203200,,632,5.0095238095238095
8231297,2,6303814263,"Not a very good movie at all. Two stars I think is pretty generous. I don't know who the main actor is. There are alot of things wrong with this movie. I know Action films don't have to be 100% accurate, but some of the things in this movie I think were just impossible. Alot of parts didn't make sinse, the ending was not the best. And over all it just seemed like it was written by a 12 year old.",995414400,,398,3.925925925925926
