""Duel for Daphne""
After an innocent kiss from Mrs. Brookhaven, Callahan is challenged to a duel by her jealous husband.

""Half Moon""
A moon-shaped birthmark on Dusty's derriere leads to his being mistaken for the long-lost son of an Indian chief, sparking a rivalry with one of the tribe's braves.

""Witch's Trail""
A beautiful blonde accused of witchcraft brings a spell of bad luck to Dusty and his friends.",1235347200,2,837,5.132352941176471
