7903375,4,B000005IO4,"[I assume that the title listed above is the 1971 unsold TV pilot released by the Magnum Music Group in 1992]. Most of Lewis' all-performance videos reveal Jerry Lee, the high-powered, quintessential Country rocker. Here we  get an unprecedented view of the Ferriday Fireball as  boogie woogie  master, balladeer, guitarist, philosopher and Gospel harmonist - plus the  chance to see Jackie Wilson and Carl Perkins deliver excellent renditions  of their hits, in addition to sister Linda Gail Lewis deliver the goods  mightily on the incredible duet with big brother on ""When You Wore A  Tulip"" (Tiny Tim's & the Three Stooges' versions really don't  compare). Seriously, that show opener is a show stopper - it belongs in a  Television time-capsule. A perfect performance! There are some  ""padded"" spots with lesser known groups and performers, but  American Music fans should know about this tape; Jerry Lee Lewis fans must  own it.",963446400,5,934,5.153333333333333
