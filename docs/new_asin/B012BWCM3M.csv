8725874,5,B012BWCM3M,"Bulldog Drummond is not a private eye.
He's a retired Army officer who finds peacetime Britain too tame, so devotes his energies to the fight against crime.
Very much a modern vigilante.
Twenty sound films with eleven different actors were produced between 1929 and 1969.
OnesMedia will be presenting the complete collection on DVD for the first time, in two volumes:

RONALD COLMAN
- 1929 Bulldog Drummond
- 1934 Bulldog Drummond Strikes Back
Picture and sound quality for the 1929 film are surprisingly good for an early talkie.
It's also a pre-code film: When a villain threatens to rape the heroine, Bulldog Drummond immediately strangles him to death.
Update; The 1929 film aired on Turner Classic Movies in January 2016 in a nice looking print with closed captioning.
No announcement yet if it will be released on DVD.
(I hope it won't be a Warner Archive Collection DVD-R without subtitles).
Picture quality for the 1934 film (co-starring Loretta Young) is not as good - it appears to be copied from a VHS tape, and there is a slight glitch every thirty seconds.
But this is this film's only listing on Amazon, so one can't be too picky.

RALPH RICHARDSON
- 1934 The Return of Bulldog Drummond
Aside from Hitchcock, one does not expect much from pre-war British films, but this curiosity is of exceptional interest.
Bulldog Drummond is more than a vigilante - he is the commanding officer of his own private army.
Drummond's militia wears black shirts and leather helmets (1934 viewers would not miss the reference to what was happening in Germany - apparently not everyone thought it was a bad idea).
Picture quality is pretty good, the sound less so.

JACK HULBERT / ATHOLL FLEMING
- 1935 Bulldog Jack
Atholl Fleming as Bulldog Drummond is hospitalized early in the film.
British comic Jack Hulbert impersonates him to finish the mission.
A successful mix of comedy and thriller.
[this is Ralph Richardson's second Bulldog Drummond film - he plays the villain this time.]
A British film with an American Damsel in Distress (Fay Wray)
Picture and sound are both good.

JOHN LODGE
- 1937 Bulldog Drummond at Bay
Though a British film, the lead roles are played by American actors (Victor Jory is the villain).
Picture quality is only OK - the competing Alpha Video version is brighter but not more detailed.

JOHN HOWARD or RAY MILLAND
Between 1937 and 1939, Paramount filmed eight B-Movies starring John Howard or Ray Milland,
with an ensemble supporting cast:
- Reginald Denny as Algy, Drummond's best friend
- E.E. Clive as Tenny, Drummond's butler
All eight films have been in the public domain for a long time.
Of The five in OnesMedia Volume One, three are a significant improvement over the Alpha Video prints (Bulldog Drummond Escapes, Bulldog Drummond Comes Back, Bulldog Drummond's Peril)

Ray Milland:
- 1937 Bulldog Drummond Escapes
John Howard:
- 1937 Bulldog Drummond's Revenge
- 1937 Bulldog Drummond Comes Back
- 1938 Bulldog Drummond's Peril
- 1938 Bulldog Drummond in Africa
------------------------------------------------ end of Volume 1
- 1939 Arrest Bulldog Drummond
- 1939 Bulldog Drummond's Secret Police
- 1939 Bulldog Drummond's Bride

JOHN BARRYMORE never played Bulldog Drummond,
even though he was billed as the star of Bulldog Drummond's Revenge, Bulldog Drummond Comes Back, and Bulldog Drummond's Peril.
Paramount hired him to play Col. Nielsen of Scotland Yard (a supporting character) in the first three John Howard films.
Unfortunately Barrymore's alcoholism forced the studio to cast a different actor as Inspector Nielsen for the remaining films.

RON RANDELL
- 1947 Bulldog Drummond at Bay
- 1947 Bulldog Drummond Strikes Back

TOM CONWAY
- 1948 The Challenge
- 1948 Thirteen Lead Soldiers

WALTER PIDGEON
- 1951 Calling Bulldog Drummond

RICHARD JOHNSON:
- 1967 Deadlier than the Male
- 1969 Dome Girls Do

The Ronald Colman, Ralph Richardson, Jack Hulbert, Ron Randell, Tom Conway  and Richard Johnson films are extremely hard to find outside of these two inexpensive volumes from OnesMedia.
Seven DVDs in a CD-size plastic clamshell case with soft plastic sleeves (the same packaging this company uses for CDs of old radio shows).
Picture quality ranges from just OK to pretty good, but OnesMedia did a heroic job of cleaning up the sound.
No subtitles, but I wasn't expecting any at this price.
These are DVD-Rs, but I had no problems with playback.
Finally, THERE IS NO COMPETITION.

GUIDE TO B-MOVIE DETECTIVES ON DVD
A-Movies had bigger budgets and stars, and were top-billed in a double-feature.
B-Movies occupied the bottom of the program.
Some of the longer-lasting series started out as A-Movies, but ended up as B-Movies (Philo Vance began at Paramount and ended up at PRC)

PART ONE: REFORMED CRIMINALS TURNED PRIVATE EYE
- Boston Blackie, the Lone Wolf and the Saint are reformed jewel thieves. Still viewed with suspicion by the police.
- The Falcon has a shady past (never quite explained).
- Arsene Lupin is an unreformed jewel thief who sometimes helps the police if it serves his ends.
- The Crime Doctor used to be an Organized Crime Boss. He never actually reformed, but was conked over the head and woke up with amnesia.

PHILIP MARLOWE / SAM SPADE
These two detectives were the most famous Private Eyes of all time, but they don't really belong on this list.
They were A-Movie detectives all the way:
- 1931 The Maltese Falcon: Ricardo Cortez as Sam Spade
- 1936 Satan Met a Lady: Warren William as Sam Spade - adapted from 'The Maltese Falcon' by Dashiell Hammett
- 1941 The Maltese Falcon: Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade
- 1944 Murder, My Sweet: Dick Powell as Philip Marlowe - adapted from 'Farewell, My Lovely' by Raymond Chandler
- 1946 The Big Sleep: Humphrey Bogart as Philip Marlowe.
- 1947 Lady in the Lake: Robert Montgomery as Philip Marlowe.
- 1947 The Brasher Doubloon: George Montgomery as Philip Marlowe - adapted from 'The High Window"" by Raymond Chandler

But two  Philip Marlowe novels were adapted as B-Movies for other detectives:
- 1942 Time to Kill (Lloyd Nolan as Michael Shayne) - adaptated from 'The High Window' by Raymond Chandler
- 1942 The Falcon Takes Over (George Sanders as The Falcon)) - adapted from 'Farewell My Lovely' by Raymond Chandler
