8449758,5,B004ZGBB7G,"On February 10, 1954 the Teapot Committee created a ""radical reorganization"" of their Atlas program to overcome technological difficulties facing nuclear ICBM deployment. The DVD claims that President Eisenhower was warned by friendly UFOs to stop our nuclear program on February 20, 1954. They warned that our nuclear program could make the earth inhabitable. We detonated the most powerful device in history 10 days later (Castle Bravo).  The meeting likely concerned this.  Later that year, it rumors that another UFO approached willing to trade us technology in exchange for non-interference of their life research projects. The DVD also claims that US and Germans lost accountability of ships and U-boats at a southern UFO base. Please keep in mind that this DVD is based upon second hand information. It merely examines a possibility that mankind is not alone on earth. It also gives us insight to what would occur if this does happen.",1403654400,5,941,5.184210526315789
8449759,2,B004ZGBB7G,"I bought this DVD thinking that it would be something other than ""the usual suspects""  putting out their theories one more time.  It's a poorly made Vid.  consisting mostly of looking at the same three faces for most of the hour. The only good thing was in the Previews where you can see bits and pieces of a couple of other Videos that were actualy done professionaly.",1365292800,11,369,4.477611940298507
