1231044,4,B00000IYQR,"There is just something strangely compelling about 1946's The Brute Man.  Rondo Hatton played ""The Creeper,"" a serial killer terrorizing a whole city, specifically targeting the people he blames for an accident that essentially ruined his life.  Back in his senior year of college, Hal Moffet suffered a terrible accident (brought on by a fateful mixture of love, jealousy, temper, and chemicals) that left his face disfigured.  Now, he keeps to the shadows and only goes out at night because his appearance frightens everyone who gets a good look at him.  Frankly, he has a right to be resentful and mentally unbalanced, given the set of circumstances that ruined his life.  Over the years, though, his anger has grown to uncontrollable proportions, giving birth to ""the Creeper.""  As murders seem to keep happening one after another, the police force finds itself stymied in its investigation of the heinous crimes - although they do almost catch Hal early on in the film.  He evades them by climbing a fire escape and entering the apartment of a lovely young woman named Helen Paige (Jane Adams).  Not only is she not afraid of her unexpected visitor, she is even nice to him - and no one has been nice to Hal in a long time.  It isn't until his second visit to Helen's apartment that he learns she is blind.  Still, a definite connection is made between the two - and something of the man Hal used to be is gradually revealed to the viewer.  You do come to feel sorry for the man, but it's certainly not enough to redeem him - he is, after all, a vicious murderer with a lot of blood on his hands.

Rondo Hatton died before this movie was released, which only adds another dimension of tragedy to the whole film.  Hatton was a brave (and some would say exploited) actor, a man who basically created the ubiquitous ""Creeper"" persona because it was the only type of character he could play.  Hatton was exposed to mustard gas during World War I, and that may or may not have contributed to the onset of acromegaly in the young actor a few years later.  This disease attacks the pituitary gland and causes abnormal growth in the patient, producing the kinds of facial deformities that define Hatton's character in this film.  The man wasn't a great actor, but I think the link between his own reality and that of his character lends an unquantifiable yet definitely detectable power to his performance.  It certainly makes The Brute Man a memorable film - and in some ways a disquieting one that will leave you with mixed emotions over the character of the tragic killer.",1139356800,3,2572,4.654867256637168
1231045,3,B00000IYQR,"I first became familiar with the character `The Creeper' after seeing a likeness of him in the 1991 film The Rocketeer, as special effects man Rick Baker transformed actor `Tiny' Ron Taylor into the character of Lothar, an incredible likeness of Rondo Hatton, who played the character (sans any prosthetics) in the late 1930s and through the 1940s, up until his death in 1946 at the age of about 52.  Seems Hatton, once a handsome looking man (according to reports), suffered from a case of acromegaly, which resulted in a form of gigantism deforming his head, feet and hands to enormous proportions.  Hatton's last film, The Brute Man (1946), directed by Jean Yarbrough (She-Wolf of London, Hillbillys in a Haunted House), features Tom Neal (Another Thin Man, Detour), Jan Wiley (She-Wolf of London), and Jane Adams (House of Dracula).  Also appearing is Donald MacBride (My Favorite Wife, High Sierra, The Thin Man Goes Home), Peter Whitney (Destination Tokyo), Fred Coby (Devil's Cargo), and Janelle Johnson Dolenz, mother to Micky Dolenz, of the mid 1960s group ""The Monkees"".

As the film begins we learn the police are on alert as some psychotic lunatic is running around the city breaking necks without a permit.  Turns out the killer, dubbed `The Creeper', is none other than former collegiate all American football player Hal Moffet (Hatton), once a normal looking man, now deformed brute out for revenge.  So what happened?  Well, seems back in the day when Hal was in college, he and his friend/roommate Clifford Scott (Neal) were both competing for the affections of the same woman, Virginia Rogers (Wiley), and Cliff, the smart one, in an effort to put one over on Hal, fed him with some wrong answers for a chemistry test, which resulted in Hal having to stay after class and do some extra work.  In a fit of jealous anger, the hot-headed Hal accidentally exposed himself to some chemicals, which resulted in him becoming severely disfigured (he now has the face of a well worn catcher's mitt), paranoid, and extremely bitter.  Cliff got the girl, and Hal disappeared, eventually returning to exact his revenge on those who he thinks ruined his life.  During his efforts to elude the police, Hal meets an attractive and compassionate blind girl named Helen (Adams), and the two develop a friendship, as she has no idea he's actually `The Creeper'.  Turns out Helen's condition is one that might benefit from a costly operation, one she can't possibly afford, but Hal knows Cliff (who now appears to be the poster boy for Murray's Superior Pomade...time to change that oil, m'boy) has done quite well for himself and his wife, as the pair are living high on the hog.  It's reunion time as Hal visits the Scotts, but the inept police aren't far behind, catching a few breaks as some vital clues fall into their laps, and Hal ends up suffering even more, perhaps the ultimate, betrayal.

I read that Universal initially produced this film, but then ended up selling it off to Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC), a poverty row studio of the time, as they thought the material too exploitationary for their tastes, playing off Hatton's condition as the feature did...I could see their point, but it's funny how they weren't so offended as to shelve the project, but rather pawn it off to recoup their costs...business is business, I suppose.  I did sort of enjoy the film, but it tended to get bogged down in the sappy subplot between Hal and Helen.  I honestly thought this was going to result in story taking a different tact, one where Hal sees Helen living quite happily with her handicap, and might eventually come to accept his own condition, but it didn't go that way...I guess there wouldn't have been much point as Hal had already killed a number of people about the time this realization would have set in...he did seem to struggle a little with the notion that if he got the money for Helen's operation, and she could actually see, she might dump him given his `grotesque' appearance.  Of the handful of people Hal disposes of (including a nosy grocery delivery boy), he missed one as someone who really deserved killing was that cantankerous, crotchety, loud mouthed grocery store owner.  Geez, Louise, just because someone pays you a pittance to make deliveries and sweep the floor doesn't give them the right to verbally beat on you like a red headed stepchild.  Anyway, there's really not a whole lot to get out of this film, other than plenty of shots of Hatton's condition for lurid, viewing pleasure, as he sneaks around, shimmying up fire escapes, skulking in bushes, etc.  The man didn't seem to have much in the way of acting skills, and most rest of the performers weren't given much in terms of meaty parts to make up for his defiencies.  At least Jan Wiley and Jane Adams were both really easy on the eyes.  I am curious that if Ms. Adams character was, in fact, blind, how did she manage to make herself look as good as she did?  I'm not saying blind people can't make themselves attractive, but she looked just a little too well made up...I thought the direction was quite good, but, as I mentioned earlier, the film gets mired is sap shortly after it starts, making the scant 59 minute run time seem much longer than it is...I did learn a few things from this film, the most important perhaps that if you're ever confronted in your home by a homicidal, neck breaking manic suffering some strange affliction causing his extremities to become enlarged, and you've managed to get the drop on him with a gun, go for the head shot, as shooting him in the leg only seems to make him go insane and even more kill crazy.

The picture quality, presenting in fullscreen (1.33:1), on this Image Entertainment release looks much better than I would have expected, and the Dolby Digital audio comes through very well.  There are no extras available, and the film begins once placed into a DVD player.  There are chapter stops, for what its worth.

Oh, one more thing, if you're a store owner and a homicidal, neck breaking manic suffering some strange affliction causing his extremities to become enlarged wants to buy something on credit, you'd best let him, else he just might pop your head off like a bottle top.",1136073600,9,6255,4.767592592592592
1231046,2,B00000IYQR,"Rondo Hatton plays the Creeper in the cheap, dull and exploitative THE BRUTE MAN, and gawking at him is about the only reason to get this one.  After exposure to poison gas in World War One Hatton contracted a disease that severely elongated and deformed his facial bones and Hollywood came a-calling in the 1930s.  Hatton appeared in about twenty-five movies, almost always playing a mute bad guy, before dying of a heart attack shortly after THE BRUTE MAN was released.

 If you want to see Hatton in an enjoyable flick get THE PEARL OF DEATH, a 1944 Sherlock Holmes mystery with Rathbone and Bruce.",1091664000,3,601,4.695238095238095
1231047,2,B00000IYQR,"Rondo Hatton was a victim of acromegaly whose deformed face (and voice) were tastelessly exploited in several films of the Forties.  This one has two distinctions -- it was Hatton's last film (he died before its release) and it was the only Universal horror film which Universal did not bother to release, but rather sold to the ultra-low budget studio PRC for release, altho the film still begins with the Universal logo.  The plot involves a handsome college student whose face becomes deformed due to a laboratory accident.  Since Hatton actually was handsome and athletic in his pre-acromegaly period, the film has a bizarre parallel with his own life.  (But it is difficult to accept that this type of deformity could be caused by a splash of acid.)  The nouveau ugly man becomes a brutal killer, proving it is possible to be grotesque on the outside and rotten on the inside, too.  He befriends a young blind woman who believes blind people have good character judgment, yet she never suspects he is a brutal killer.  This grim, depressing film is interesting in a perverse way.",1013299200,3,1084,4.827027027027027
1231048,3,B00000IYQR,"Another customer review very nicely covers the movie itself, so just let me chime in with a few quick words about the technical quality of the DVD release.
You might think that this disc would be grainy, or soft, or with  poor contrast, particularly since it's from the legendary poverty row  studio PRC, and a few other PRC videos are so-so. Truth is, although the  film was released by PRC, it was produced by Universal Studios!
You'll be  exceedingly happy to discover that the transfer to DVD is outstanding.  Contrast is excellent, and the image is sharp and clean. This is a  Criterion-level transfer here! Sound is nice and clean too. Of course, the  disc hasn't anything in the way of extras. Running time is just about an  hour, the case is a snapper.
If you're interested in the related films,  this one is the last of the ""Creeper"" films. The Creeper is Rondo  Hatton's ""signature role"" begun in 1944 in the Rathbone/Bruce  Sherlock Holmes film PEARL OF DEATH, followed by 1946's HOUSE OF HORRORS,  and finally THE BRUTE MAN (which was indeed Hatton's last film).",957830400,19,1074,4.71505376344086

1231079,5,B00000IYQR,"The last great Universal horror gem is one of their best. This is more of a killer thriller than horror. It has a film noir tone to it than horror. It is very
good as both. As most of the later Universal horror some became hokey and kinda of silly but not this one. It stays serious thru out the picture.
The writing, directing and acting are excellent. Rondo Hatton plays the part as only he could with is looks which you can't help feeling sorry for
him in some way. I have had this on VHS for years and glad to see it on dvd now. If your a Universal horror fan you must have this and also

1231080,3,B00000IYQR,"Universal stopped making ""B"" horror movies just as this picture rapped. They sold it to poverty row studio ""PRC"" and it was released under their brand. This is also Rondo Hatton (""The Creepers"") last film. A must for any Universal Horror completist.

This is a good transfer of a decent print of the film.",1378339200,,305,4.648148148148148
1231081,5,B00000IYQR,"An OK B horror film starring the sad, unfortunate Rondo Hatton as the title character.  He plays a man disfigured years before and is out to take out the people he holds responsible, and anyone else who gets in his way.  I bought the Image Entertainment DVD release which is an excellent version.  Way better than the Cheezy Flicks DVD release.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",1378080000,3,380,4.626865671641791

1231083,1,B00000IYQR,"If Universal Pictures had not sold ""The Brute Man"" (1946) to low-rent PRC, this poor excuse for a chiller would have avoided public domain status. The exploitation of a seriously ill Rondo Hatton (who died eight months before the film's release) evokes pity rather than fear. One wishes this movie had not been made. A sad, pathetic end to Universal's second horror cycle. Excellent print quality from Image Entertaiment, but no DVD extras.",1364169600,2,440,5.041095890410959
1231084,4,B00000IYQR,"The Brute Man is fifty-eight minutes and was released in theaters on October 1, 1946. The Brute Man is a quasi-sequel to the House of Horrors. Hal Moffet (AKA The Creeper) is killing people he believes are responsible for his disfigurement. Fleeing from the police the Creeper enters a blind woman's apartment a starts off taking a liking to her. However, he flees when the police comes knocking at her door. The next day the Creeper kills a delivery boy because he was spying on him. Finally the Creeper finds Clifford Scott and Virginia Rogers from his college days; the two are now married, and tries to extort money from them. Clifford shoots him, but dies while fighting Hal. Hal flees and heads to Helen Paige, the blind woman, with the jewelry he took from the Scotts. He gives the jewelry to Helen so she can afford the eye operation. Helen takes the jewelry to a jeweler to get it appraised. The jeweler recognized the stolen jewels and calls the police. Helen tells the police how she got the jewelry and the police set a trap for her. Hal heads back to Helen's apartment and the police take the Creeper in to custody.

This was Rondo Hatton final film and died three months after the completion of the film and eight months before the release. Due to his progressive acromegaly, Rondo kept forgetting his lines, confused on the set, responding to other actors. Universal sold the movie and the rights to the movie to Producers Releasing Corporation fearing negative reaction that it was capitalizing on Rondo's death. At best the Brute is an okay movie that was made during the final days of Universal monster movies days. The Brute man gets a B-.

1231085,5,B00000IYQR,"First off, let start by saying that the treatment of Rondo Hatton was terrible, however, i did enjoy his ""Creeper"" films, and i really like the Bryte Man. The story revolves around Rondo's character of Hal Moffat, who was badly disfigured, now Hal, deranged by thoughts of revenge & hatred, turns into a bone crushing serial killer known as ""the Creeper"". The police are hot on his trail, as the Creeper continues his murderous romp, however, when he befriends a beautiful blind woman who takes pity on him, the story really kicks into gear. DVD quality was fine, not good, not poor, the sound was the same. Overall, a decent ""Golden Era"" Universal Monster flick (even though Universal sold the rights to the Creeper franchise). A must own for horror buffs.",1323820800,2,757,4.786259541984733

1231087,4,B00000IYQR,"A very sad, moving film that is not in the least a ""horror film"" in the general sense. The fact that this was made by Universal but then sold to PRC because the new owners of the studio didn't want to be associated with films like this is plainly evident from the sheer look of the film, as well as the list of names in the opening credits. One example: Makeup by Jack Pierce. (Of course, within a year or two, he would be kicked out of Universal-International just as this film was.) Rondo Hatton's tragic personal story lends a sad aura to this production. He was very much a ""used"" person who comes across as a sweet, kind man who was dealt a terrible hand by Fate. The film isn't a horror film in the usual sense of the word, but is perhaps, as a result, the most horrible film Universal ever made. Very sad, very moving, beautifully acted.",1282348800,2,844,4.28125

His real name is Hal Moffat (Rondo Hatton- HOUSE OF HORRORS), and he's got the strength of several men. On the run from the police, Moffat happens upon a blind woman named Helen Paige (Jane Adams) who helps him get away. Meanwhile, an amateur sleuth believes he may have located The Creeper's hideout. Unfortunately, he's right! Crrr-ack! Police remain stumped, but think some of Moffat's old college classmates may have information. They tell the police the tragic story of Moffat's disfiguring accident, and how Moffat might hold them responsible. Now, The Creeper is planning on looking up his old ""friends"", so he can give them their spinal adjustment! Can Helen keep Moffat from following through w/ his vengeful plot? Hatton is quite good in his titular role, showing both menace and a warmer, almost vulnerable side w/ Helen.
