8160511,5,B000LAZE5A,"Haven't seen it all yet but can say that it has the kind of information I greatly enjoy receiving about our American Western past.  Very interested in  how we (white eyes) interfaced with our Native Americans.  The reality of it all, without Hollywood intervention / distortion makes it much more down to earth.  As westward expansion, especially after the Civil War accelerated, Indian leadership within the tribes became very important.  Our history books fail to mention anything about these great leaders in a time when their  traditions and customs were being pushed aside.  This DVD, in my opinion, does well to enlighten viewers.",1388707200,,636,5.116504854368932
8160512,4,B000LAZE5A,"I liked the movie.  I ordered it to find out more about Quanah Parker, the last chief of the Comanche Indians.

It would not play on one of my DVD players, but did in another one.  There was a strip in the middle of the Quanah Parker part that is unintelligible.

It's not a great movie...more of an historical drama, and information about the great American Indian tribes.

Quanah, Texas was named after Quanah Parker.  My dad's family was from Quanah, TX.  I have viewed the DVD and will send on to my brother, because he is greatly interested in anything having to do with Quanah Parker and the town that was named after him.",1297728000,,628,4.408695652173913

Important especially for those looking for connections to their ancestors.",1277942400,,152,5.954545454545454
8160514,3,B000LAZE5A,"This disc is appropriately titled:  half of it as about leaders and the other half is about nations.  This work has a nice mix of contemporary photos, vibrant paintings, reenactments, and Hollywood film footage.

I'm a bit surprised that Sitting Bull didn't have his own chapter in the leaders section.  Also, the Cherokees are the most numerous tribe in the US, yet they are ignored in the nations half.  The nations half seemed like it was moving from east to west, starting with the Iroquois in New York.  However, the Navajo of Arizona are brought up before the Lakota of the Dakotas.  This work does a great job in recounting that Native nations were not always located where they were.  Yes, Americans forced them to move, but tribes had relocated due to push and pull factors before colonialism.  This work speaks of American military leaders, some would say foes of the Native people, just as much as Native leaders.  For people who want to research them, this may be a good starting point.

The narrator has no foreign language skills whatsoever.  He pronounces ""Taino"" as if it had two syllables and rhymed with the bathroom product Drain-O.  He pronounces the Spanish word ""bosque"" as if it only had one syllable.  He pronounces the French word ""nez"" as if the Z was not silent.  The men portraying Native Americans were on the chubby side and given that food was more scarce back then, especially on reservations, I am sure this is an inaccurate representation.",1184457600,7,1473,4.766798418972332
8160515,3,B000LAZE5A,"This was an interesting presentation retold through the eyes of Native Americans. It was historically accurate and detailed significant events.
Although it was well worth the purchase, it could have been greatly enhanced by the use of nespaper reports and narrations from historical documents. What is left untold is the basic characteristics of the leaders, so that they tend to be one dimensional with no effort at analysis of the complexity of the problems that beset them.",1182297600,2,476,5.194805194805195
