8081246,1,B000B0WO4Y,"This is certainly not want was expected from PBS/Frontline, which usually produces some good documentaries, whether you agree with their viewpoint or not.

Rather, this was a poorly structured, wandering commentary that would have you believe that Rove invented negative campaigning (he didn't) and that it is used exclusively by the Republicans (not hardly.)

It starts out in a somewhat organized fashion discussing Rove's background and the application of modern demographics and marketing to political messaging and campaigning, but quickly degenerates into some kind of Washington Post editorial piece of the evils of Republican campaigning the Bush administration (what a surprise, considering the source.)

If you are a student of political campaigns and messaging, this documentary is a major disappointment and really doesn't add any value.",1346716800,,849,5.722222222222222
8081247,1,B000B0WO4Y,"WOW...I was so  looking forward to seeing this program reading about how  ""even handed"" it was. It  didn't take long  watching to realize that if the viewer is expecting  to see red applied to Karl Roves skin color and horns attached to his head ....you would pretty much get it only more subtly.

First...the beginning of the program the makers have to mention that Karl Rove's Republican roots go back to his teenage years and his true belief in traditional conservative principles of governing and law. Its really never mentioned again....but throughout the program the narrator , in a very ominous tone, refers to his master plan to basically seat Republicans in every office in the country. I don't find that problematic in one bit....would not a true Democratic believer want Democrats to win every election?  The more telling aside that the ""documentary film makers"" make early on is that somehow George W Bush doesn't have a single original idea that doesn't serve Karl Rove and his desire to see him elected and re-elected. When a program ""jumps the shark"" that badly its hard for me to take the rest  of it seriously.

Also..the contributors are primarily Dana Milbank and his gang of Bush haters in the media and primarily the Washington Post.  The contributors from the Bush Campaign only comment (at least  what we are shown) on facts of the campaigns ...all the theories and implications come from the talking heads with left leaning political agendas to espouse.

Karl Rove is pretty much called  out as inventing hard hitting or dirty attack campaign ads  in this  program and its done often...and without any substantiation. First off..it was a Democrat , LBJ, that invented the televised attack ad with his legendary nuclear bomb and young  girl with a flower ad that crushed Barry Goldwater in 1964! Secondly...while much is made of the Republicans  rightfully showing John Kerry ...saying himself..""I first voted yes before  I voted no""....the film makers attach no significance to the news shortly before the 2000 election that Governor Bush had a DUI in his history!
That is  presented in a way to show how deftly Rove got around  it but goodness...can we really ascribe something devious to every negative issue surfacing about a Democrat and accept that when dirt is dug up about Republicans that its not for similar reasons?

The idea that George W Bush spent his time in office taking on policies that were directed by Karl Rove to firstly allow  him re election and secondly allow  Republicans to take  over the world is ridiculous...and history bears that out.

This film  was constructed  before the 2006 mid  terms and to me seems like  the flop  film ""W"" that Oliver Stone rushed into theaters prior  to the 2004 election..designed to influence. The fact that Karl Rove chose not to  participate does  not  surprise me as he was serving in office at the time so it would have been premature and inappropriate. I also believe he was better served appearing  on interview shows which were not able to be chopped up and edited to allow  for distortions like this waste of time. Oh,and by the way, I'm a registered Democrat who has never voted for a Republican presidential candidate but love reading about political and historical figures and events.",1291507200,2,3278,4.875
8081248,4,B000B0WO4Y,"It really doesn't matter what one's personel feelings are about Karl Rove because this documentary (like all Frontline episodes I've seen) is not overtly political one way or another.  I really didn't know much about Karl Rove going into this except that the Bush bashers really seem to hate him.

Well, now I think I know why.  Here's where one can learn very quickly just how Karl Rove gained such prominence in the Republican Party (the clips from the late 60's and early 70's were great fun) and how he helped President Bush get to where he is.",1195171200,,548,4.571428571428571
8081249,5,B000B0WO4Y,"The PBS Frontline documentary, Karl Rove: The Architect, takes the viewer on a journey into the mind and motivation of the President's ""right hand man,"" Karl Rove.  The documentary is a must see for anyone interested in learning more about Rove's rise to power and his political vision for America.  If you've ever wondered how exactly the Republican Party came to be a dominant force in the political landscape in this country, you should definitely see this film!  On a personal note, I'm not a fan of the Bush administration and their policies on things like the War in Iraq, stance against same-sex marriage and stem cell research.  I have to admit though that after watching this documentary, I developed a greater level of appreciation and respect for the strategic and aggressive Republican mastermind who helped secure victories for President Bush during the 2000 and 2004 campaign.",1154822400,3,890,5.034013605442177
8081250,3,B000B0WO4Y,"In all fairness to the documentary, this reveals the importance of brilliant campaign strategists.  Karl Rove found that ppl who read fishing magazines vote Republican, so he got those subscription lists and send those readers campaign literature.  Because trial lawyers donate heavily to the Democrats, Rove is trying to cut off what they can win (read: earn) in court cases.  He emphasizes get-out-the-vote efforts; a tactic that I thought was only important to CBC members.  I want more progressive strategizers to be as crafty and skilled as Rove.

Still, it's creepy seeing this innocent-looking, doughboy-faced guy being such a wicked Far Right mastermind.  The documentary shows that he was thin in his youth; it says nothing on how  and why he got fat.  Granted, Rove declined to interview, but it was still eerie seeing others opine on a man that is alive and could have spoken for himself.  But I guess that would ruin his diabolical, behind-the-scenes work.

When in doubt, Karl Rove uses HOMOPHOBIA to win elections.  Almost all of Bush's opponents were trashed as ""gay-lovers"" under his schemes.  It sickens me that he would use this group to get over, but it sickens me more that so many Americans are so bigoted that they are easy prey to Rove's prejudiced pied-piping.

Mary Matalin is the only pro-Rove interviewee here who is not a white male.  This just resignifies how incredibly un-diverse the Republican Party is.  But the people have spoken loud and clearly that they don't want diverse leadership.  You get you what you ask for.

Now that Rove is receiving negative publicity, it was a bit easier to watch this documentary.  I dislike the man, but I can respect his cunning.  This documentary was a great way for progressives to learn more about their enemies.",1131667200,3,1784,4.926174496644295
