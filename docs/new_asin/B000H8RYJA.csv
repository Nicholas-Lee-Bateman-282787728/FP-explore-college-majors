COMMENTS: ""Into The Wind"" is a one year documented adventure. Taking the viewer through Texas, Mexico, Florida and Colorado. The film follows Ken Reeder and Camilyn Brucker learning the sport from day 1. It also features expert Chris Page in various locations - making it look easy, and giving you breathtaking views. From the outside looking in, this may seem like an easy sport... but, for the beginner there is months of preparation. Training includes learning to use/guide the wing (the sail that holds you up), the control lines, and sitting in simulators to understand the steering. The scenery is amazing... and some of the cool locations include PPG-ing over Colorado's Royal Gorge and the Arkansas River; PPG-ing with the Texas Air Adventure hot air balloons in Katy, TX; and PPG-ing at the ""PPG National Convention"" in Polk City, FL over a 5-day stretch with about 200 other pilots. ""Into The Wind"" puts you in the pilot's seat... taking you on a spiritually calming, yet thrilling white-knuckle ride. The film conveys the message that 'anyone' with a sense of adventure can take to the sky. It also lets you know that it's a sport not to be taken lightly and there are lots of things to consider - the necessity of using the best equipment, getting the best training, flying (or not) in different altitudes and weather conditions, and perhaps most importantly making the best decisions while up in the air. There's plenty of footage of Page flying high above the clouds - you'll see straight ahead camera views, as well as camera shots aiming downward (sometimes including the tips of his feet) over plains, mountains, and bodies of water. You'll also notice Page holds a digital camera in his hand at times - and all I could think of was that I sure hoped his camera was strapped on tight in case it should slip. The cinematography, the music, the learn-to approach... the entire journey is an A+ effort. ""Into The Wind"" is a great ride from start to finish (5 stars).",1161216000,3,2832,5.051282051282051
8137605,5,B000H8RYJA,"I smiled beginning to end while viewing this marvelous production.  And I think you will, too, if you enjoy anything at all about flying, the spirit of adventure, or the just beauty of the natural world.  The musical score is surprisingly strong in its own right and adds even greater lift to the spectacular photography.  This is the real stuff  -- no acting but genuine action -- and a flowing narration that makes it all complete.  It is a great gift for your favorite pilot or outdoors enthusiast who will find new inspiration every time they play this movie.",1156118400,6,563,4.646464646464646
