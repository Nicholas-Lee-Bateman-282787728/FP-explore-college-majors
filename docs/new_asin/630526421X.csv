997251,4,630526421X,"All star extravaganza featuring most  Paramount stars under contract including Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, Gary Cooper. Barbara Stanwyck, Burt Lancaster and on and on.  The only one missing seems to be Betty Hutton.  This is a fun show with Mary Hatcher teaming up with Olga San Juan who are both Hollywood hopefuls.  Lots of yocks and some nice musical sequences including Alan Ladd and Dorothy Lamour performing TALLAHASSEE and Crosby &  Hope performing HARMONY.  Directors Mitchell Leisen and Cecil B. Demillle also make guest appearances.  The Puppetoons sequence was originally shot in Technicolor but according to Universal who owns the Paramount film the color sequence no longer exists which is a big disappointment.  I agree that  Hatcher could be a dead ringer for Kathryn Grayson.  The film introduces Hatcher to audiences.  Her film career never really took off and she only appeared in a few more films and I know she went B'way to star in a musical soon after.  Oddly enough San Juan (who was married to Edmund O'Brien) also headed for B'way about the same time to co-star in PAINT YOUR WAGON. She too never had that much of a film career but did co-star with Crosby in BLUE SKIES.",1404345600,,1190,4.836633663366337
997252,5,630526421X,"This 1947 black and white Paramount release is one of the better 'all-star spectacular' movies, which were popular in the early days of films, without some of the 'longeurs' of Paramount's war-time effort, ""Star Spangled Rhythm' and with many of the same stars.  Here, WWII was over, so Paramount looked around for another 'cause' and came up with The Variety Club Charities. The plot, once again, was little more than something to 'hang' the talents of just about everybody on the Paramount lot.  In this case the action centers around Mary Hatcher trying to get into movies.  Because of her limited talent, her film pal, Olga San Juan, walks away with the better parts of their scenes.  Hatcher, by the way, bears a remarkable resemblance (physically and vocally) to Kathryn Grayson, who's star was about to burst forth (and soar much higher) over on the MGM lot.  Pairing Hatcher with the Spike Jones band is a stretch but it works.  In any case, it's the big stars that drew in the audience and they all do their bit, this time for charity.  One surprise to some, may be tough-guy Alan Ladd's singing.  Actually, Ladd spent some time early in his show biz career as a band vocalist.  If you want to hear more of his singing, there is a 'Soundie' clip featuring him that you can see on YouTube.  the rest of the performers do pretty much what you'd expect, with Bob Hope and Bing Crosby given a large share doing the same type of thing they were doing in their very popular 'Road' pictures.  Many of the songs are by Frank Loesser.  Alas, at least on this VHS release, the promised 'technicolor' George Pal Puppetoon is in a black and white print. All in all it's a pleasant way to spend 1 1/2 hours and see a lot of 1940's stars.  Also, my copy has three 'promos' at the beginning featuring scenes from the soon-to-be-released (on VHS tape) Universal films of W.C. Fields, Marlene Dietrich and Deanna Durbin ... a definite plus.",1381276800,,1932,4.597667638483965
997253,5,630526421X,"This is a treasure for anyone who went to the movies during the 40's..Every big star who was with Paramont (with the exception of Betty Hutton who was having a baby) is in this panarama of talent...Of course Hope and Crosby have that great chemistry..But to see dramatic stars like Howard DeSlivia, Lizabeth Scott, Burt Lancaster hamming it up is a lot of fun...
It features 17 year old Mary Hatcher who was great...She made a few more films, did Oklahoma with Howard Keel on stage and then disappeared...
What a loss!",1203379200,,518,4.641304347826087

997255,5,630526421X,"Variety Girl is one of  those movies with a plot that's little more than an excuse to showcase a bunch of stars, mostly in small cameo roles.

The story is based on the premise that the charitable Variety Club started when some Hollywood producers adopted a baby girl, Catherine Brown, in 1928 and Catherine, now grown (Mary Hatcher), is seeking fame in Hollywood.  She picks a screen name, Amber La Vonne, but her self-centered room mate (Olga San Juan) steals it, causing confusion when a talent scout for Paramount (DeForest Kelley) is sent to offer her an audition and takes the room mate by mistake.  This misunderstanding is milked for comedy throughout most of the movie as both she and the room mate show up for auditions, screen tests, etc., bumping into dozens of stars along the way, including Gary Cooper, Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, Robert Preston, Barry Fitzgerald, Patrick Knowles, Cecil B. Demille, Virginia Field, and many, many others, some uncredited such as George Reeves and Johnny Coy.

The are a number of entertaining sequences such as Catherine  singing with Spike Jones and his band and performing voice-overs for a George Pal Puppetoon called Romeow and Juliecat, a screen test that William Bendix deliberately makes difficult, etc.

A bunch more stars perform in the Variety Show at the end, which includes Alan Ladd, Pearl Bailey, and Dorothy Lamour singing, as well as appearances by William Demarest, Burt Lancaster, Lisabeth Scott, Ray Milland, Paulette Goddard, William Holden, Veronica Lake, McDonald Carey, and others.

Interestingly, among all these stars, DeForest Kelley has the male leading role, though he wouldn't really become famous until he played Dr. McCoy on Star Trek 2 decades later.

I'm giving the film 5 stars because of the novelty of all the talent showcased here - it's rare to find any films with Pearl Bailey singing, Spike Jones' band playing, scenes from a George Pal puppetoon, or all these great stars together on one statge.",1125014400,12,1980,5.012195121951219
997256,3,630526421X,"It's hard to assign a star value to a movie like this.  Lovers of 1940s musical productions will love the variety acts with Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, Spike Jones, the acrobats, and even the harmonica band.  (Spike's zany  production number is written into the story line with wonderful results:  the band's soloist has no idea the nature of Spike's band, and is  bewildered why the audience is laughing during her singing.  The story  itself that ties the musical numbers together, however, is silly and deadly  dull:  ""I Love Lucy"" type pranks without any of Lucy's endearing  charm.  Fortunately, there are LOTS of production numbers!",917308800,5,633,4.990384615384615

7886075,4,630526421X,"This movie is a rollicking treat in so many ways.

Firstly it is a wonderful nostalgic trip around Paramount studios in 1947. Bing's makeshift golf course, sound stages and administration buildings.

It is also an insight into how pictures were made. In the Cecil B. DeMille scene set there is of course no blue/green screen. The projection light goes on, and suddenly you see the back projection of the river. And when the actress walks behind the screen you see her shadow looming prominently. Or in William Bendix's kitchen where you see the sink is simply a board with nothing underneath, and the actor runs out of a back door discretely hidden in the scenery.

Even the backstory used as a link to the stars is entertaining. Frank Ferguson with his distinct gravelly voice, who generally plays small parts such as the townsman in westerns who gets shot after about 5 minutes, gives his all as the studio head, Olga San Juan's performance isn't too forced and De Forrest Kelley is a curiosity in a rare leading (sort of) nice guy role.

But of course the crowd wants to see the stars. And boy do they shine. Hope & Crosby's golf skit, Alan Ladd in a singing role with Dorothy Lamour, even Pinto Colvig (best known as the voice of Grumpy & the first voice of Goofy) in peformance doing voice over.

Which brings me to the DVD's (Universal Vault series) one disappointment - The Puppetoon sequence is in black and white (even though the credits say it's in color).

Apart from that frustrating issue, in summing up, just relax and soak up the fun.",1469232000,,1549,4.614545454545454

7886082,1,630526421X,"This 1947 movie isn't listed in the IMDB list of all Bob Hope films. It seems Hope (and Crosby) only appear in a short golf sketch.
Hope isn't even listed (as a star of the film) in the Leonard Matlin Classic Movie Guide. It seems a little misleading for Universal/Paramount to give both Hope and Crosby top billing on the DVD cover. I choose not to buy - especially at this terribly over inflated price.",1415836800,,404,4.4
