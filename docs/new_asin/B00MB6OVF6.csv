6567352,5,B00MB6OVF6,Being entertained is wonderful. Growing in a way that expands your love as it expands the love in the world is our healthiest purpose and this film sets you on such a course. It's simple and elegant and a little magic how a short entertaining romp across some enlightened peoples conversations can so pleasantly expand your consciousness and tune you into the joy of contributing positively to others. There is not enough of this in the world and hopefully by buying this I have helped it spread and multiply. This is a fantastic gift for those you love and even more fantastic for those you don't yet love. Thank you for this and aloha!,1408492800,,637,4.5964912280701755

6567356,5,B00MB6OVF6,"My wife and I expected this movie to be good, although we had no idea what a treat we were in for. It was FANTASTIC! It really is the type of move that, once you watch it, you want to immediately go online and buy more copies so that you can share it with family and friends. . . that's what we did. It's truly entertaining and thought provoking, and in our household we refer to it as ""The Worlds Greatest Conversation Piece"". Invite a bunch of friends over, cook up some popcorn, enjoy the movie together and then watch how it inspires incredible conversation into the wee hours of the morning. I highly recommend it!",1408147200,2,619,4.344827586206897

6567359,5,B00MB6OVF6,"Sebastian Siegel has put together an honest  and truthful film that addresses where we are as a species, and as a planet.  In order to understand what is happening in our world today, we must first become conscious beings and move away from the distractions of everyday life. One needs to recognize the bigger picture prior to being able to address the needs of that picture.  This film offers clarity regarding what the needs of this world are, while at the same time educating us about what is required on our part as human beings to help heal this place we call Mother Earth.  In the end, this film is about love; love of that which is in peril and only we as the stewards of this world can remedy!  Shamanic teachings have been a part of our planet since the very beginning and the lessons both taught and learned have allowed humanity to continue.
""We are not human beings having a spiritual experience. We are spiritual beings having a human experience.""  Pierre Teilhard de Chardin
This film reminds us of that truth in a very special way.  It is up to us to remember where we come from and why we are here.",1446595200,,1114,4.431372549019608
6567360,5,B00MB6OVF6,"This film is a conversation starter. Forget the conversation cubes or any other activity. This is the real deal. This film asks a few simple questions and the answers are thought provoking. Watch this film with others. You will be inspired to share ideas about it for a long time.
Awakening World is appropriate for ages 12 and up. Watch the movie with them as I did. The movie will touch them and give them an open space for conversation about important topics. Your young adults are thinking about these topics too. This movie was like a can opener with our son. We still talk about the topics today.
This is a Buy and Share Film!",1445990400,2,632,4.456896551724138
6567361,5,B00MB6OVF6,"I had the pleasure of meeting Sebastian and viewing Awakening World at my local yoga studio. The film is beautifully done, and the interviews are touching, enlightening, and sometimes humorous. After the film, Sebastian led a thought provoking discussion. All of the participants commented on how the film had effected them in a positive way. I would highly recommend this film for a group audience followed by a discussion. Keep up the good work, Sebastian.",1445212800,,458,5.12
6567362,5,B00MB6OVF6,"An absolute MUST SEE documentary!!! I had the pleasure of meeting Sebastian and watching the screening in Puerto Vallarta and got to see his passion behind his message... definitely one to gather some friends round, pop it on it's an impactful 40 mins and discuss over dinner.

6567363,5,B00MB6OVF6,"We go about our lives, interacting with loved ones, friends, colleagues, and strangers. Our actions impact others and, yet, we are not always conscious of that impact. Awakening World delivers the mechanism for becoming more mindful in our interactions with others. Sebastian Siegel poses a variety of questions to people from all walks of life. What is love? What is the purpose of life? What is hell? What is intimacy? What is heaven? I laughed, cried, and sometimes had to remember to breathe while watching this documentary. The answers were heartfelt and enlightening and, yet, differed significantly. Some of their words resonated much more deeply than I had expected.

I realized that there is no right or wrong answer; our thoughts about these matters are personal and result from our vantage points in life. As I watched this thought-provoking film and pondered my own answers to Sebastians questions, I found that, already, my own thoughts about each were changing. Not yet awakened, I am certainly well into the awakening phase. He has inspired me to become more mindful as I connect with others. I encourage you to take the first step and join him in this journey.

I have often shared books that positively impacted my life with my family, friends, and students. I will be sharing copies of Awakening World with them. Thanks, Sebastian, for being part of the reason that my life, once again, is changing for the better. I anxiously await the next installment, Spirit of Evolution.",1444521600,3,1493,4.968
6567364,5,B00MB6OVF6,"I absolutely loved this movie! I just finished watching it for the third time. This movie touches profound subjects on human awareness. Hearing so many personalities give their interpretation of words such as ""heaven,"" ""hell,"" ""love,"" expands my own views. After all, although we might define things differently we all converge in what LOVE is.",1422662400,,344,5.2727272727272725
6567365,5,B00MB6OVF6,"This is better than having a coffee table book; I keep this short film handy and share it with my guest...we now have things to talk about for years to come! As we evolve, re-watching the movie brings up different viewpoints. The topics center around love, creation, the purpose of life; everything that actually matters in life. It touches your soul and gets your intellectual mind on board for the journey. Don't forget to watch the bonus clips, they give you even more insight on the director and how the film was developed!",1422489600,,527,4.67741935483871
6567366,5,B00MB6OVF6,"The film is a must watch for anyone no matter where one is in their life!  The beginning of the documentary was as compelling as each individual sharing their thought, their feelings, their experiences.

Each individual answered the questions with different words and from their own experiences.. however the common theme was love, vulnerability,  intimacy. To be seen and loved for who we are, to feel valued,  to love others for who they are and to be aware of  the awakening of our oneness of consciousness,  throughout the world.

Even in the very last clip of the film as the credits were being shown Aloha, The breathe of Life, to be shared with everyone.

I was moved by Sebastians way of being, Even though this was not captured on camera during the interviews, it was felt.  Sebastians  way of being allowed each individual to feel safe in answering questions that are not easy to answer even in the privacy of our own home.  Their answers were revealing about themselves,  by being raw, vulnerable, intimate it allowed the audience to do the same.  To awaken oneself.  No matter how evolved one is,  we all fall asleep at times.  It was a great reminder, we cant fall asleep for a moment.  One must be awake and mindful each moment.

I have watched the film more than once.  Each time I watch it, I am awakened to something new.",1410134400,,1338,4.593220338983051
6567367,5,B00MB6OVF6,"In my field of clinical psychotherapy, if you are a student, a teacher, a parent, or just alive and wanting to live more fully, this documentary is a must watch. These existential questions aren't new, but the way in which Sebastian skillfully ushers us to explore them will leave you uplifted, more connected, and engaged with your own self and anyone around you. Sebastian is a light for the transformation of the world. I love this film!

6567368,5,B00MB6OVF6,"Awakening World is more than a movie. It is a movement! This documentary evokes emotion, opens dialogue & get's you actively sharing your inner most thoughts & feelings. You come away from it feeling love, in many senses of the word. Beautifly done, amazing lights (people) & something certainly to be shared again & again. Fantastic gift!",1408752000,,339,4.964912280701754
8671304,5,B00MB6OVF6,"What a fun, inspiring, and intriguing movie.  Sebastian is a great Host/Narrator, and his opening passage sets the ambiance of the film so beautifully.  It's fascinating to meander through the intimate thoughts of artistic and spiritually minded people.  Their depth and sincerity were comforting, and the intimacy of their interviews, their willingness to ""go for it"" was both inspiring and educational.  The ""Awakening World"" sets the tone, from the get-go, of a delightful journey of the Mind, Heart and Spirit, masterfully driven by Sebastian Siegel's narrative and pacing

The film was well organized and moved with aplomb through its ""Questions"", enjoyably raising questions in myself as I listened to the insights of others.  Great filming, great music, and fun to watch.

I would rank this film right up there with ""The Secret"" and ""What the Bleep"" for both entertainment, and spiritual transformation value.  Because of its effective pacing and beautiful cinematography, I found ""The Awakening World"" superior.  And Sebastian's closing call to action is one to which we should all rise.",1517529600,,1095,5.356725146198831

Thank you for cr sting this film. It's a must see.",1506902400,,357,4.59375
8671306,5,B00MB6OVF6,"Love, purpose, and intimacy have all been topics I have struggled with.  Not because I didn't want them, but because for years I didn't feel that I deserved them.
This film came into my life at the perfect time.  After years of personal work within, I was craving more human interaction to discuss these very topics.  While watching the film I asked myself the very questions presented, and I even laughed and cried.  I found it extremely heart opening and it helped me want to start the conversation, ask the right questions and open up with others.
I recommend this to anyone wanting to build human connection, or if you want a reminder of just how beautiful life is.",1498089600,,669,4.5966386554621845
8671307,5,B00MB6OVF6,"The interesting thing about life is that were always looking for the right answers when, in fact, the trick is in finding the right questions.

8671308,5,B00MB6OVF6,"Sebastian's film is very well made and gave me a greater understanding of cultures and life, love and much more. It shares a unique and different perspective, to see the life from the eyes of others. This film can give great hope and meaning to lost and helpless people. As a psychology major it has given me new tools and help to how others can be helped. I highly recommend this film to everybody on earth.",1467676800,,408,4.381578947368421

8671310,5,B00MB6OVF6,"In December, I had the pleasure of attending a screening of this documentary. I experienced it as highly relevant and heart opening. These are the conversations I am interested in having. What is Love to you? What is Purpose to you? What is Intimacy to you? My musings afterwards...""The holiday season is upon us, as well as the ending of another year. This is a ripe time for me to ask bigger questions of myself. To have the conversations that connect me to my community.
I love the idea of this documentary being part of the holiday season. I love the idea of these conversations happening amidst all the disturbing current events. I love the idea of families asking each other what really matters. Check it out, and let's talk! ""
And here it is, into 2016, I am so inspired by Sebastian's Whole Hearted approach to living and bringing Aloha to the world.  This movie is the salve the world needs.  We as individuals can share, ask the questions that touch the heart and start talking and raising awareness to the things that Truly Matter.  This movie moved me.  I am left asking myself bigger questions.  How can I serve?  What gifts can I offer to the world?  What do I value and am I living it?  Cheers to deepening and awakening.  I highly recommend we all buy this DVD and share, share, share, and then keep the conversation going!",1454976000,,1339,4.522821576763485
8671311,5,B00MB6OVF6,"As a surfer, healer and leader in yoga, meditation and selflove empowerment, I can't recommend this film enough. Sebastian had created a simple platform to help people ask themselves the most basic and fundamental questions about love, intimacy and conscious living. It makes one realize that there's more to life than what we perceived and the answers are within us to discover. This film's heart lies in the spirit of ALOHA, which to me is the basis of happiness and freedom, watch it and you'll understand! Together we can unite to make change in the world and have a blast in the process! Aloha.",1450396800,,599,4.769230769230769
