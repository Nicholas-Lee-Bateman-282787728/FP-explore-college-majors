7968719,2,B00006HB2N,If you can get the edited for schools version it is great and deserves 5 stars.  I bought a used one on VHS and edited one of the most vulgar things imaginable in a museum sequence by putting a piece of tape over the slot and pushing record to make static over that part.  Only by this method could I use it with my Spanish Class.,1430265600,,330,3.984848484848485

7968721,4,B00006HB2N,"Interesting travelogue through southern Spain.  Diverse geography and cultural elements portrayed.  Overall pretty much on par with other Globe Trekker shows for quality and interest.  Though, I always wish that Globe Trekker hosts would speak the language of the host country.  (I'm a Spanish teacher)
One word of CAUTION if showing this to younger viewers:  there is a visit to an Inquisition museum at the beginning of the show which includes a demonstration of wooden dildo chair used by ""witches"" and torture devices such as nipple cutters and other graphically violent implements.  The scene is at the beginning, but definitely not for the faint of heart or the very young.",1417737600,2,679,5.127272727272727
