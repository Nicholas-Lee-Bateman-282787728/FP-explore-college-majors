Becoming the ultimate observer allows us to gain complete control over our lives and awakens us to our power to create anything at all. Dr. Joe Dispenza was taught by Ramtha himself for over 20 years. This DVD is a must have. Are you ready to become God?",1120003200,12,317,4.19672131147541
2292373,5,B0009I7D9E,"With all the hints the film ""What the Bleep Do We Know"" dropped, this is an outstanding discovery. Nothing fancy, no bells and whistles, just a simple straightforward telling of exactly what you need to know to develop through observation and the astonishing levels to which this is proved to affect ourselves and others. If you loved the movie, you'll want to put this in action. If you were disappointed in the film, this will make up for it. What the Bleep Do We Know is really the teaser, the movie trailer if you like, for the real information and knowledge that can only matter if you take the effort to seek it. This will reward you for that effort.",1138492800,25,656,4.475

2292376,5,B0009I7D9E,"""The frontal lobe gives us permission to make thought more real than anything else. It gives us permission to hold onto an idea or dream, regardless of what's going on in the external reality. My thinking is more important than my environment."" - From the DVD

Featured in the popular movie What the Bleep Do We Know!?, Dr. Joe Dispenza is a chiropractor who earned his biochemistry undergrad degree from Rutgers University. In What the Bleep, he discussed the process of ""creating your day""-arguably the most fascinating portion of the entire movie.

Because of his fascination with the idea of spontaneous remissions of disease-what some would term ""miracles""-Dr. Dispenza began to investigate what these individuals have in common. Your Immortal Brain - Mastering the Art of Observation explores the function of the frontal lobe of the brain, the common characteristics of those who experience spontaneous remissions, how to re-wire the brain, and the difference between explicit and implicit learning. Dr. Dispenza also discusses the problem with Cartesian duality and the observer principle of Quantum Physics, theorizing that humans can learn the skill of observation and harness its power for co-creation.

According to Dr. Dispenza, the four common characteristics shared by those who had spontaneous remissions from disease (e.g., cancer, diabetes, and emphysema) are:

1. Every person accepted and believed that there was a Divine Intelligence running their body-with a transcendent will and mind separate from their own. ""I'm riding on the back of a giant. If I could just learn to tap into this intelligence, it will do the healing for me.""

2. They understood that their thought patterns contributed to their disease, largely because thoughts produce chemicals. Negative and insecure thoughts cause us to feel exactly like we're thinking.

3. In order to break their thinking process, they had to re-invent themselves. They had to become ""someone else"" and by beginning to think of who they wanted to be, they stopped the thinking/feeling feedback loop.

4. When they re-invented themselves, they spent long moments where they lost track of time and space. They removed their attention from the body and environment (the 2,000 bits of information that most people concentrate on) and onto the rest of the 400 billion bits of information that largely goes unnoticed by most people. Thus, their brain began to create new patterns.

Dr. Dispenza then gives an engaging teaching on the purpose of the front lobe (it's the ""executive"" decides on action) and the ""Ice Pick Experiments"" of the 1930's (lobotomies). Interestingly, the six things common to lobotomized patients are similar to the state of most modern humans-including being uninspired and the tremendous desire for same-ness.

He then makes this amazing observation:

""Most people are distracted by the external world, so they don't use the frontal lobe properly. Everything in our environment is constantly feeding the brain information. Our senses are what allow us to interpret reality. As long as we believe the external world is more real than the internal, we'll always be using the same circuits in our brain to process information. The moment we accept that our internal world affects our external world, then we must begin to use our frontal lobe.""

With a run-time of approximately 1 hour, Your Immortal Brain - Mastering the Art of Observation is a stripped down presentation, with Dr. Dispenza sitting in a chair speaking to the camera. However, what he says is intelligent and cogent. If applied, his teaching could be revolutionary for many people. I can't help but wonder, though, how using the mind more by thinking and imagining will help us get out of the quagmire of spiritual sleep. Authors like Eckhart Tolle, Byron Katie, and Gangaji maintain that our problem is that most cannot ""stop"" the pursuit of truth, realize the diamond of eternity inside, accept what is, and live in present moment awareness. Does humanity really need to ""think"" and ""do"" more? Or is this a necessary stepping stone-albeit a rather circuitous one-to realizing our own divinity and creativity right now?

I don't have these answers but I appreciate that there are those like Dr. Dispenza who are asking the questions in the marketplace of ideas. If you enjoyed the movie What the Bleep Do We Know!?, especially the segment with Dr. Dispenza discussing the idea of creating your day, you'll definitely enjoy Your Immortal Brain - Mastering the Art of Observation. It's a smart, scientific, and engaging DVD.

2292377,5,B0009I7D9E,"If you've ever wondered why some people experience miraculous healings or great good fortune or remarkable life changes, this DVD provides explanations about how the human brain can be used to bring about a new set of circumstances.

Although the answer which lies in quantum physics and neurophysiology could be daunting, Dr. Joe Dispenza is a speaker who clearly and masterfully presents complex subject matter in concepts and examples that are easily understandable by everyone.

Quantum physics states and has proved that the observer creates the outcome, i.e. reality.

Dr. Dispenza is a student at Ramtha's School of Enlightenment where he learned the art of observation from Ramtha the school's master teacher.  He has personally experienced how the brain, consciousness and intent work to create reality whether that be a day, an experience, an outcome or a future.

In this DVD Dr. Joe talks about how not only the scientist in a laboratory is an observer, but that each and every person is an observer, and naturally so because every human being is endowed with the neurological equipment - the frontal lobe - to create a desired outcome.

He responds to scientists who challenge the idea that everyone can consciously create reality by saying, perhaps we've all just been poor observers, and with knowledge, proper instruction and practice, everyone can create a desired reality.

The information is worth viewing many times and supports and explains why the concepts put forth in the multi-award winning move What the Bleep Do We Know!? TM are not fantasy but fact.  An excellent companion DVD to this one is ""Ramtha An Invitation to Open Your Mind - Create Your Day"" from Mark Vicente, Director of What the BLEEP Do We Know!? TM is.  It is also worth viewing many times.",1128384000,,1783,4.996621621621622
2292378,4,B0009I7D9E,"This is a good summary of Dr. Dispenza's recent research and findings. It is a more polished and conservative presentation than those of us who follow Dr. Dispenza's work are accustomed to from his spirited, streaming life presentations. I therefore consider this a good introduction to anyone who is not terribly familiar with his work. The title is a little miss-leading in that the presentation does not suggest specific tools on mastering the art of observation (which the title might suggest), as much as it re-iterates the fact that observation does, indeed, matter. His more craving followers may be left wanting more. But as always, it is a courageous presentation of ideas and notions whose time has come.",1125619200,38,714,5.059322033898305

2292380,5,B0009I7D9E,"Dr Joe Dispenza (featured in 'What The Bleep Do We Know"") has taken his research on spontaneous remission of disease in the body, along with his extensive knowledge of the brain, and simply and profoundly illustrated (with practical explanations of everyday life that we can all relate to) how our very thoughts and feelings create our own state of being, our every day reality.

Dr Joe's extensive knowledge and simple explanations allow us to understand how and why the quality of our thoughts matter so much, and how they have a direct affect upon our body's health and well being. This exciting information immediately opens the door of hope to each and every one of us, that we can have (always have had) a huge influence upon our own health and well being, simply according to our thought patterns. This puts us in the ultimate driving seat to become well, or to change our life in whatever way we choose!

Enthralling leading edge information that is well worth viewing many times over.

For more expanded understandings and adventures into creating our own reality with our awareness and thoughts, the DVD by Ramtha  ""An Invitation To Open Your Mind, Create Your Day"" is a must see, where Ramtha (featured in ""What The Bleep Do We Know"") introduces practical and simple exercises using mind that will change your life for the greater!

Thank you Ramtha and thank you Dr Joe Dispenza!",1122595200,62,1391,4.803347280334728
2292381,5,B0009I7D9E,"It was absolutely electrifying ... Dr Joe explained a very difficult subject ... the brain and it's neuronet and how it all worked to create reality, and how to change reality ... in very simple easy to understand words.  I've watched (studied) it now three times.  My 19 year old grandson is also fascinated with it and wants to bring his friends to watch it.

I can hardly wait for his next release.

2292382,5,B0009I7D9E,"I watched this DVD for the first time last evening and know I will enjoy and appreciate it for many more viewings in the future.  One of my first thoughts while listening to Dr. Dispenza was that when these ideas and insights becomes mainstream, and they will, there will be an inevitable shift in conscious awareness across the globe.

Dr. Dispenza discusses his research and insights into the causes of spontaneous healing.  He is concise, brilliant and ""reasonable"" in his arguments that suggest that the human brain is designed to accept thoughts that completely transform the body to radiant health, or bring about any circumstances that the a person desires if that person is able to train her/himself to become the ""observer.""  The ""observer effect"" is a quantum physics phenomenon that has been thought to only occur on the scale of sub-atomic particles and not on the scale of the large. However, in his discussion on ""Mastering the Art of Observation,"" Dr. Dispenza speaks with conviction about the power of every person to affect reality.  From my way of thinking, this offers hope and encouragement inclusive of great scientific discoveries as well as the teachings of great masters.",1121558400,18,1195,5.015151515151516

8061232,2,B0009I7D9E,"Unfortunately, I bought this after seeing ""What the Bleep..."".  Dr. Dispenza may have been able to contribute to that movie, but basically he can't carry his own in this one.  It is extremely boring and if you have seen ""What the Bleep.."" then you have seen the most interesting part what Dr. Dispenza's has to say on this topic.",1385942400,,329,4.559322033898305

8061234,5,B0009I7D9E,"As long as you can get past the less than stellar lighting & the questionable props this is an excellent DVD where pure content is concerned. It looks like it was filmed in about an hour by an someone holding a video camera & a set of lights. (Hope Joe is paying attention - would love to see him produced the way he deserves, but I'm glad he didn't let possible budget-restraints keep him from making this one.)

As for content, it is suburb & well worth sitting through the poor production. I tend to put it on when I work so I can just listen to Dispenza. Most of the information he presents is quite technical & requires some concentration though, so I find listening to it over & over helps me assimilate something new each time.

I first noticed Dispenza in ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" & latter purchased the ""Quantum Edition"" of this movie because it has hours & hours of additional interviews - & one of my favorites is of course Joe Dispenza. However, don't expect the same high-tech production work in this DVD as found in ""What the Bleep..."".

Dispenza is a chiropractor & did postgraduate training and continuing education in neurology, neurophysiology, and brain function. He is also a graduate of JZ Knight's School of Enlightenment, but he doesn't get into any Ramtha stuff here. (Although I wouldn't mind hearing his take on it.) He sticks to the physiological functions of the brain and is wonderful at explaining a very difficult topic. If you want to change existing negative patterns in your thinking, emotions and/or reactions, this is an excellent source of information on how you might accomplish this. Dispenza succinctly explains the how's and why's (explanations that are often left out in discussions of brain plasticity) that will help you understand the wonderful possibilities of your own brain.
I also recommend Dispenza's book, ""Evolve Your Brain"" which I found a bit dry and difficult to get through at first, but he also has a DVD by the same name (it's a great adjunct to this DVD - not a big-budget production either but a little more interesting to watch because he was filmed live, onstage before an audience.) Ultimately, both DVD's have helped me tremendously in understanding his book, which goes into much more depth and was well worth the effort.

Another source of information I highly recommend is a book called ""Heart Math"". The heart and brain are intrinsically linked, and changes in the brain can occur via focusing on the heart and learning to entrain the two. Heart Math teaches the fundamentals of `heart focus' like Dispenza teaches the fundamentals of `brain plasticity' - both of which can lead to a greater understanding of why we think, say and feel the things we do, and ultimately help us make changes to old, negative thinking patterns.

I applaud Joe Dispenza for his work in a very difficult subject and for making this information understandable to the lay person. Another favorite researcher and writer in the area of epigenetics is Dr. Bruce Lipton. His excellent book ""The Biology of Belief: Unleashing the Power of Consciousness, Matter, & Miracles"" - is a very easy read by comparison, but Joe Dispenza goes much further, with more in-depth teaching for those who want more.

It's done in sort of a ""fireside chat"" type of style, and there are numerous cuts throughout, but overall the content flows very well and this is one of the best presentations I've heard by Dr Dispenza. Part of ""mastering observation"" involves tuning out irrelevant details and focusing on the ""meat,"" keep that in mind as you read the reviews of those less focused on WHY they bought this DVD.",1196380800,6,510,4.494623655913978
