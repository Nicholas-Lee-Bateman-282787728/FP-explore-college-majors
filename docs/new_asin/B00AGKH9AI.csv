5424507,5,B00AGKH9AI,"I saw this film in the UK when it was first release many years ago. Later, I tried to buy it but it is not available in Europe. I consider this film to be the start of the action=adventure  type of film, well before it's time. I chanced upon it on this site, found it could be delivered to Europe and my UK account was valid her, so with a few mouse clicks, I had ordered the most expensive DVD that I would ever own, since, now, I needed a multi-region player.
Having watched the film, was it as good as I remember? Yes
Did I enjoy it? Yes
Was it worth it? Yes
A good buy

5424509,4,B00AGKH9AI,"Director Peter Collinson's production of 'INNOCENT BYSTANDERS'-1972 arrived at the wane of the Spy Film genre as fans were seeing Sean Connery leave the James Bond franchise and awaiting Roger Moore to attain the mantle.  This film owes alot to that particular time frame even down to the ludicrous music score by John Keating trying to emulate the sound and themes of John Barry.  It does, however, succeed by having a clever script by James Mitchell which is based on the novel by James Munro and a stellar cast.  Stanley Baker who's career was largely forgotten at this time plays John Craig, a washed up psychologically scarred Department K agent who's given one last job to redeem himself by his boss, Looms, played magnificently cold and calculating by the great Donald Pleasence.  Dana Andrews ,in one of his last appearances , plays the head of the CIA and Cec Linder who played Felix Lieter in Director Guy Hamilton's classic Bond opus 'GOLDFINGER'- 1964 plays his shrink. We also have Derren Nesbett known for his role as Von Huren in Director Brian G. Hutton's epic war actioner 'WHERE EAGLES DARE'-1968 along with Ferdy Mayne who cameos here also and Sue Lloyd as Department K agents sent to eliminate Craig on Looms orders; Geraldine Chaplin who never looked more fragile and beautiful as one of the supposed innocent bystanders of the title, the great British character actor Warren Mitchell and the awesome Vladek Sheybal as Kaplan, the man that both sides want. Director Collinson delivers the goods at an intense clip till its punchline conclusion.  I purchased the DVD copy and the image is so crystal clear in a beautiful 1.85 transfer that its hard to perceive that the Blu-Ray copy could be much of an improvement but sadly, there are no extras.  Highly recommended for fans of Espionage photoplays, this rarely seen film is given its just due by Olive Films giving audiences a taste of a different type of spy film plus its good to see Baker in his last film role for he would succumb to an illness at the young age of 48 in 1976.",1375401600,12,2052,4.733893557422969
5424510,5,B00AGKH9AI,"I was pleased to discover that Amazon carried the DVD of this 1972 British spy film.

I had only seen (in part) one other version and that was a version shown on network television years ago. For some reason, the TV version in the USA included additional scenes, apparently filmed in New York. I know that it has been a trend lately to release DVD versions (and even theatrical versions) of films called the extended cut, the director's cut, or a version with an alternate ending.

The early version of INNOCENT BYSTANDERS was, I believe, one of those theatrical films with new scenes added to the televised version to pad it out to fit into a network time slot that could include commercials. The most shameless example of this is the Hammer film KISS OF EVIL or KISS OF THE VAMPIRE which has newly (and insipid) scenes filmed for the televised showing. In some cases, scenes in the original theatrical films are often expurgated because they include footage (usually violent) that is considered by heavy-handed censors to be inappropriate for the sensibilities of mainstream America who are not yet accustomed to cable programs. The version of INNOCENT BYSTANDERS that I saw on network TV includes a scene where John Craig (Stanley Baker) breaks the arm of a watchman and causes him to faint. Also included is a scene where a young girl touches his arm in affection and Craig responds: ""What are you doing?"" He tells his companion that feelings were cut out of him when he was tortured in the past.

These two scenes were not included in the DVD released by Amazon, which is, apparently, the theatrical version. A reader may point out that I, perhaps, confused two separate films that both starred Stanley Baker. This is not the case because I clearly remember Baker (as agent Craig) telling his companion -- an Israeli agent portrayed by Geraldine Chaplin -- about his physical and mental problems. It seems a bit questionable that such an innocent bystander as Ms. Chaplin would want to seduce an impotent ""old"" agent as Craig, but this is, in fact, what happens.

At breakfast the next morning -- after his apparent renaissance -- she tells Craig that he should be grateful for her restoring his ability. He thanks her, but a bit cynically. She adds that perhaps she wasn't ""that good,"" and he responds to her compliment-fishing by confirming that she was. Later, when she is tortured by a sadistic British agent sent along to undercut Craig's efforts (Derrin Nesbitt from THE NAKED RUNNER and WHERE EAGLES DARE), Craig is quite sympathetic and reveals important information to spare her further pain and humiliation (what Nesbitt does to Ms. Chaplin is not clear because his torturing takes place off-screen).

Nesbitt is effective as one of the agents sent on the same mission as Craig (supposedly without the latter's knowledge). The other agent is an image of compassion and gentility when compared to Nesbitt; she is played by Sue Lloyd (the female love interest in THE IPCRESS FILE -- one of the greatest spy films ever), who is as accurate with a gun as Craig but a bit quicker.  Stanley Baker, however, is superb as the no-nonsense, non-romantic aging agent who is betrayed by his non-trusting and not-trustworthy superior Loomis, stiff-upper-lipped Donald Pleasence. Also on hand is the CIA in the person of Dana Andrews. As a hero from 1940s and 1950s films, Andrews seems out of place here -- but perhaps it is only his non-matching fright wig that he perhaps sports to take our attention away from Stanley Baker's own hairstyle that seems that it does not belong.

I have been a fan of Stanley Baker since he portrayed Achilles in the 1955 international epic HELEN OF TROY. Despite his dark hair (Homer's Achilles was supposed to be blond as he is played by Gordon Mitchell and Brad Pitt), Baker is the best on-screen Achilles ever -- capturing the fury of that semi-god from Greece mythology. I also like Baker in HELL DRIVERS (which features a minor role by Sean Connery), ZULU, IN THE FRENCH STYLE, and SANDS OF THE KALAHARI, which I will soon order from Amazon.  I have nothing against long hair (I often wear my own blond hair long), but somehow the style as worn in INNOCENT BYSTANDERS doesn't somehow seem suited to Mr. Baker as an ""older"", black-haired agent. Perhaps he sports this style to make clear that he is an anti-Bond. He (like Michael Caine in the five Harry Palmer films) doesn't use ridiculous gadgets supplied by Q branch but relies instead on his wits and marksmanship. The sequence where he shoots fellow agent Nesbitt in the foot is not to be missed (Kudos to Nesbitt or his stunt double for his flipping forward after being hit by Craig's bullet).

The ending seems to come rather quickly, but we, at least, know that he outsmarts his double-crossing superior Pleasence (an incredibly unlikeable superior in the mode of Stewart Granger who double crosses RIchard Burton and the other mercenaries in THE WILD GEESE) by flying to Beirut where he may (the romantics among us hope) meet up again with Ms. Chaplin.  Don't be fooled by the glitzy, flashy, pop-culture artwork on the cover of the DVD of INNOCENT BYSTANDERS. This is not a Dean Martin humor-fest (like we see in the Matt Helm romps) but a fairly gritty spy tale not unlike the Harry Palmer films. It has plenty of action, but the action is believable and plot-enhancing.

Check it out. In the meantime, let us hope that the fad of releasing many versions of a film in order to milk dry every possible penny from DVD sales will eventually end. Let's make one version of a film and stick with it. After all, how many versions of the ""Mona Lisa"" do we find?",1365724800,5,5655,4.736788617886178

5424512,4,B00AGKH9AI,"John Craig, a British operative regarded as expendable, is sent on what is intended to be his last assignment, in Innocent Bystanders, a tough, gritty, and at times brutal espionage thriller, that is enjoyable for its realism, and very cynical British sensibilities.  Capably directed by Peter Collinson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Italian-Job/dp/B0000AUHPB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Italian Job</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Long-Day-s-Dying/dp/B00AB5YJFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Long Day's Dying</a>), the film features an outstanding cast, headed by Stanley Baker (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zulu/dp/B001CTBGNS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zulu</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Guns-of-Navarone/dp/B000E1ZKJQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Guns of Navarone</a>).

John Craig is a spy who has sacrificed much for Queen and Country.  After being tortured by electrical shock, he suffers from post traumatic stress, and has also become impotent.  Loomis (Donald Pleasance), Craig's boss at Department K, believes that while still competent at killing, Craig is damaged goods, and decides to use him as a decoy, on a mission to recover a missing agronomist named Aaron Kaplan (Vladek Shebal), who supposedly can make the desert bloom.  Having escaped from a Russian prison camp, the highly valued Kaplan is also being sought by the Russians, and the Americans.

Loomis' ""first team"" are Joanna Benson (Sue Lloyd), and Andrew Royce (Derren Nesbitt), two younger agents who are assigned to backup Craig, and move in when he fails.  Royce openly disrespects Craig, calling him an ""old man"", while Benson is more circumspect than her impetuous partner, as Craig is dispatched to New York to question Kaplan's brother.

While Loomis appears to be cooperating with an American agent named Blake (Dana Andrews), both the British and Americans are determined to get Kaplan for themselves.  Once a finely honed instrument, Craig is now regarded as broken down, and no longer capable of excellence.  He surprises his detractors however, jumping ahead in the game, kidnapping Miriam Loman (Geraldine Chaplin), a woman who may have some clue to where Kaplan is hiding.  The trail eventually leads to the Middle East, and then Cyprus, where the intrigue, danger, and violence increases, as the various parties scramble to recover Kaplan.  The body count begins to rise, on what will surely be Craig's final assignment.

For what this movie was intended to be, the acting performances are spot on.  The lanky Baker isn't debonair, but he fits the bill as an intelligent and brutally efficient survivor.  Craig starts out as a broken man who screams from imaginary pain, but he regains his manhood, and proves that he isn't quite ""past it"" yet.  Derren Nesbit (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Where-Eagles-Dare/dp/B0030A0ZDE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Where Eagles Dare</a>) is terrific as the arrogant pretty boy, who in the end does what he was trained to do.  And Sue Lloyd (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Baron/dp/B001NH4CEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Baron</a>), does a nice job as his inscrutable partner.

Although he would later become an icon in the Halloween films, coincidentally playing a character named ""Loomis"", Donald Pleasance is also excellent here, as a cold, calculating, and confident bureaucrat, accustomed to playing God.  As Miriam Loman, Geraldine Chaplan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dr-Zhivago/dp/B001TOCCRU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dr. Zhivago</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nashville/dp/6305918880/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nashville</a>) provides most of what little humanity there is, although as the ""innocent bystander"", Loman is deeper than she appears.  Quirky Warren Mitchell, is entertaining as Omar, an enterprising guide, and Vladek Shebal (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/From-Russia-With-Love/dp/B001AQO3WO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">From Russia With Love</a>), is solid in an understated role.

John Craig first appeared in four novels published between 1964 and 1969.  James Mitchell wrote the books, under the penname ""James Munro"", and The Innocent Bystanders, published in 1969, was the last in the series.  Mitchell also wrote the screenplay, and nicely captures the novel's serious tone, with characters that are mostly hardened professionals.  With some cinematic action elements, and touches of dark humor, Innocent Bystanders is an interesting and enjoyable watch, for the discriminating espionage aficionado.

Ending on an abruptly defiant note, this stark and cynical adventure, has virtually nothing in common with the glamour and affluence of the Roger Moore era Bond films.  If that's your type of espionage, give this movie a chance.  Unfortunately, Stanley Baker would never reprise the role of Craig, as he passed away in 1976 at only 48 years of age.",1364083200,3,5198,6.673590504451038

8551399,4,B00AGKH9AI,"Innocent Bystanders is one of those spy films from the 1970s that hitched onto the coattails of the popular James Bond movies. Stanley Baker is both believable and poignant as a washed-up spy whos been replaced by the next generation of British agents. Bakers character was also been tortured on his last mission and has lost more than just a step. The movie becomes his quest for redemption. Can he step up and become the man he once was? While the movie obviously did not have the largest of budgets, its scenes ring true. Geraldine Chaplin is gorgeous as Bakers love interest, and the all the actors turn in credible performances, especially Baker, who was an accomplished actor.

8551402,3,B00AGKH9AI,"Coming at the tail-end of Bondmania and based on the last in a series of novels by the creator of Callan, 1972s Innocent Bystanders is a messy spy thriller with a standard issue undercurrent of cynicism that works in fits and starts as it tries to have its cake and eat it. Its the kind of film where the exposition setting up the plot is constantly intercut with scenes of Stanley Baker and Sue Lloyd indulging in some athletic target practice to keep the audience from being bored by all that talking. Thats about all they indulge in because not only is Bakers spy over the hill but, thanks to some over zealous KGB torturers, his love life is well and truly ruined, which is a surprisingly bold move for an actor with such an alpha male reputation. Its not something the film initially shies away from in a surprisingly good torture scene that plays on the characters impotence and memory of his earlier ordeal by having his new tormenters never actually turn on the power but simply let his imagination do all their work for him. Unfortunately one reason it stands out is that much of the first half hour is pretty badly directed by The Italian Jobs Peter Collinson, who has a particularly tough time with the genuine violence: its the kind of film where someone will be shot in the head only to produce woefully unconvincing screen blood or a gulag escapee will be shot at close range by four machinegun toting guards only to get up and be shot again two more times in a clumsy bit of stage dying that draws unintentional laughter. Johnny Keatings score doesnt help much either, at times turning into Thunderball to try to make mundane scenes like opening a bank deposit box seem exciting but simply making things seem overwrought instead.

Collinsons direction improves as the plot gets underway, with Baker despatched to find a Russian scientists before the Americans or a pair of Russians can and kidnapping Geraldine Chaplin along the way. Naturally they fall for each other while his boss tries to double cross him so he can double cross the Americans who were trying to double cross him while Baker decides to double cross him back which is all fairly familiar but makes for a reasonably solid couple of hours even if the film does feel a little overstretched and undernourished at times. Baker and Chaplin are both very good and theres a decent supporting cast: a clipped Donald Pleasance as Bakers tightly repressed boss, the kind of civil servant who can make ordering lunch for you sound like hes coldly passing the death sentence, Dana Andrews as a duplicitous CIA man, Warren Mitchell as a Turk who learned his English from Australians as well as familiar faces like Ferdy Mayne (dubbed by Robert Rietty) and Derren Nesbitt and the odd Bond movie veteran like Vladek Sheybal, Cec Linder and Yuri Borienko. Unexceptional and formulaic, but it does have its moments.

Olive's Region 1 DVD and region A-locked Blu-ray offers a decent but unexceptional widescreen transfer but no extras.",1403136000,,3000,4.745210727969349
