942196,5,6304961618,"This movie is one of the best indie suprises I've ever had.  I've dealt with this subject first hand and I am amazed by the truthfullness, bluntness, and seriousness the writer had.  I felt like I relived my party  days of high school.  These were the people I knew in high school.",914803200,,281,4.346153846153846
7879883,1,6304961618,The DVD quality looked like it was recorded off a TV with a camcorder. Very very poor quality. Great movie and quality when I watched it on VHS.,1461888000,,144,4.178571428571429
7879884,2,6304961618,"This movie was terrible. A Gen-X version of ""The Big Chill"" sans the great music or good acting, for that matter. I don't have much more to say about the movie other than it was BAD.
The only redeeming quality of this DVD (which is obviously absent from the VHS tape) is that it has a feature with drinking games on it. Kind of a neat little library, if you ask me, to keep on hand for a party (or a private or personal binge, though I don't recommend that). They even make the movie itself into a drinking game in that you identify yourself with a character (each character drinks more or less than the others on average) and drink whenever that character drinks. There are also other rules for when you have to drink (ie, whenever anyone mentions sex).
Frankly, I am not one for independent movies, really, but some have blown me away. This, unfortunately, didn't come even close to that, and I wanted to pull my own hair out one by one by the end of the movie. If I could get this DVD super cheaply, I would buy it for the drinking games library, but I would much rather play a drinking game with another movie or a TV show. I'm sure you can find great ones on the internet.",1020643200,3,1177,4.235555555555556
7879885,4,6304961618,"This was a great movie - the acting is a bit awkward at times, but that almost makes the characters more real and that much more appealing. They reminded me of people I know...and of those twisted conversations you can only have with your closest friends (usually while under the influence).",1011225600,3,291,4.7254901960784315
7879886,5,6304961618,"This is a very good film with some excellent special features.  The film is about friends who get together after the suicide of their friend and drink to disassociate themselves from the strong feelings they are experiencing.  Their conversation runs from theology to raunchy sex and is witty and thought provoking.
As for the special features, the interactive drinking game (Drink-O-Vision) was a fantastic time.  My friends and I could barely walk after the film.  There was also director's commentary that gave great advise on how to make an independent film, an interview with the filmmakers, and a library of drinking games.  There were other special features, however these were my favorite.
Check out this disc, it was excellent.",982022400,8,736,5.151260504201681
7879887,4,6304961618,"If you live in Portland, Or and are 20-30, you must see this film. That's what you do, you get together with your friends and play drinking games till you all pass out somewhere. I related to it and so could you if you've  ever been in this drunk situation. Although the acting was not top notch,  it sure did make me miss my home. Oh, yes, and the sountrack is to die  for... hmmm... I think I hear another search coming on. :)",954806400,,428,4.071428571428571
7879888,1,6304961618,"I had a hard time staying interested in this movie. If you can't get to sleep, here's your remedy.",952300800,,98,4.2105263157894735
7879889,2,6304961618,"I must say right off that I'm over 30...so perhaps ""I just don't get it"".
That said...this film has done for me what all the sleeping aids in the world have failed to do.  I rented it from Blockbuster and  tried to watch it for 3 nights in row only to have the same thing  happen...zzzz.  This Big Chill Wannabe has some fantastic production values  going for it as well as some (please note: NOT ALL) good acting to it's  credit.  But the screenplay is a whinefest that never really works it's way  out of the ""Feel Sorry For Us"" mode.  It's plunging the depths of  young adulthood problems reveals only an old boot and some seaweed.",948153600,,634,4.3418803418803416
