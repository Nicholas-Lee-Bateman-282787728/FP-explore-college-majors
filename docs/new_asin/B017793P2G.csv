This film was I thought a well acted. The characters were engaging. The story was interesting. The filming was good.

As there are no big action scenes so I would not recommend running to the cinema to see it.",1454976000,2,435,4.551282051282051
8738217,5,B017793P2G,"April 9th, 1940 was a significant day for Denmark!! Overall, April 9th was a very entertaining and enjoyable movie! I have to say it was very well done! The story line was interesting and yet non-predictable. I like how the movie carries a significant message which i will not give away in this review. The acting was believable and some of the best I have seen in the past few years. Just to keep things simple, I enjoyed the movie and highly recommend it. I wish this movie would be released in blueray format in the United States!! Bravo to the movie industry in Denmark! April 9th is in my top 5 list of favorite war movies of all time and I have seen them all! :)",1451260800,4,668,4.267716535433071
8738218,4,B017793P2G,"April 9th was the day the Wehrmacht rolled across the land border and invaded Denmark. The Danish army was only lightly armed, small in number and completely unprepared. They were mobilised but did not want to deploy in defensive positions in case the Germans saw that as a provocation  such was the politics of the day.

The story is told through the experiences of a bicycle company led by Second Lieutenant Sand (Pilou Asbk of A Hijacking) they decide to follow their orders and try to do the impossible of holding back the strongest army in Europe.

Now this is not an epic but they have done a rather good job with most of the period detail and the acting is all really good. There was quite a bit of detail that made this memorable, but there is also a lot of doing things of a more mundane nature  like changing bike tyres etc. That said everything is integral to the story. The action when it comes is also very well done and it has the air of authenticity; if you are a WW II fan then this is one you will not be disappointed in seeing  recommended.",1445990400,8,1058,4.3232323232323235
