1916105,4,B0000C89JS,"Folks who've read the story of Ft. Worth's T. Cullen Davis and his trials (for murder, and solicitation of murder), best related in the book ""Blood Will Tell,"" will consider this film a fair rendition... but if one does not already know the story, some of it is a bit difficult to follow.  This is the tale of Cullen Davis (""the richest man ever tried for murder"") and his second wife, Priscilla, a working-class young woman who married into the upper crust.  Cullen appeared to be a conservative playboy, running his father's immense company into mediocrity, but living lavishly off the family's wealth.  Priscilla comes across as the classic gold-digger who didn't really know much about money and wealth at first, but learned VERY fast.  While their marriage was happy, they build a huge mansion in Ft. Worth and furnished it richly.  After the relationship tanked, Cullen moved out and the messy divorce began.  Right in the middle of things, a man dressed in black and wearing a wig, appeared at the mansion one night and shot Priscilla... along with killing her 12-year-old daughter and her boyfriend.  Priscilla accused Cullen, who was immediately arrested.  The murder trial, dominated by Houston lawyer Racehorse Haynes, turned into just the sort of circus you'd expect when the defendant has a zillion dollars.  Later, Davis was charged with trying to have Priscilla and some others killed (this, presumably, would settle the divorce fiasco).

This is a seemingly fluff film that actually has more depth that most of these sorts of mostly-true tele-dramas, so it must be watched fairly closely.  Heather Locklear nails the Priscilla described in ""Blood Will Tell,"" an extremely interesting character.  Cullen is -- and this was probably intentional -- a semi-cypher, very true to the form of the individual presented in the book.  You will like the film if you read the book, and you might enjoy it if you did not.",1108425600,6,1924,4.956386292834891
7998277,5,B0000C89JS,I love this movie-it makes for a good afternoon to lay on the sofa with popcorn; very disturbing that this was based on fact.  Heather Locklear is definitely eye-candy; all of the cast is great,1503446400,,193,4.514285714285714
7998278,5,B0000C89JS,"Love the movie, worth every penny.",1434585600,,34,4.833333333333333
7998279,5,B0000C89JS,"I love this movie! It's one of my favorite true crime movies. Peter Strauss plays an excellent role as Cullen Davis. Heather Locklear is excellent in her role as Priscilla Davis, too! In fact, all of the actors and actresses were great. I think it's a shame that lifetime doesn't show these movies anymore like they used to. LMN does make some true crime movies exclusively for their network, but they are not really any good.",1433116800,,426,4.618421052631579

7998282,5,B0000C89JS,Interesting movie and plot based on real events in Texas.  Check out the hairstyles and clothes of a while back! Love it!  This is the movie but there was a mini series on TV a while back...,1358985600,,190,4.108108108108108
7998283,5,B0000C89JS,This story is true.  Peter Strauss plays the part of Cullen Davis so well!  An amazing end for a playboy career which a cannot tell.  You will have to see it to believe it.,1326585600,2,172,4.0
7998284,5,B0000C89JS,"True stories always are best when it has great acting as these two!

Him and Priscilla wow.what a story.

Just Amazing! This guy was clearly Guilty!(or to some)
but yet no one was at all going to convict him.amazing.mi amigo
believe he was surely guilty. however,i have reservations on this
as the  ""crime scene""

clearly was in many ways botched,and evidence was thinly,at best,
against Cullen Davis. Minus the actual""ending with the video tape pay off""
that is really suspect. I love Dennis Franz playing a excellent version of
a high price""best that money can buy$type of attorney""representing Cullen.

i have it on again now i been waiting! to watch it again on LIFETIME,
and
will order this DVD really soon.

Priscilla was a trip.at times,but overall i like her sass,and her humor.

i do not think it was right that he did what he did IF he really did it,

i say IF because OK the video does exhibit naturally Cullen in pay off scene,
if he did it or not,peter Strauss is one fine sexy handsome rugged type
actor love him,in all movies,great actor IMO playing this part to
perfection! GREAT MOVIE,GLAD LIFETIME SHOWING IT AGAIN TODAY,Until i buy it.

LOVE THIS,as it is clear the Kazillionaire Cullen Davis$$$$ was able to if he
really DID kill the little girl""who just got in the way""while he was clearly
aiming,in a wig (As witness state)shame he had to result to this type of
""justice""when he has millions,over 100 million? the guy still was not happy.

As it is true,if your not happy""within yourself""inner etc. NO MONEY in the
world,can change that. This movie is LIVING PROOF of such factual. RIP
to the real life priscilla i hear she died,i think from Cancer,very sad.

She now is at peace however with her little sweet andrea.

adios....
