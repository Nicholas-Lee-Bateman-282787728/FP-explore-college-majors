7902828,5,B000003KA1,"This is one of the most important Voyager episodes in terms of development of the character of Chakotay.  If you are a fan of this series, I'd highly recommed this episode as it reveals much about Chakotay's background and character and gives us insights into the soul of one of the more complex characters on Voyager.
This episode is perhaps one of my favorites from the second season of the show.  Certainly it is not the most ""action packed"", but it does allow us to know Chakotay much better...and that knowledge enhances our appreciation of many subsequent episodes.",995328000,,571,4.816326530612245
7902829,5,B000003KA1,In this episode Chakotay discovers an ancient symbol of his people on an M class planet. We get to discover more about the commanders past as he recalls memories from his childhood. As Chakotay gets stranded on a planet we also get a quick glimpse of Chakotay in the buff. (Too quick). But hey you can always put the Video on freeze. Chakotay shows us his sensitive earth loving side as he finds out the truth behind an Indian legend.,983145600,3,434,4.4375
7902830,4,B000003KA1,"In search of supplies Voyager crew comes to a planet only to discover that the inhabitants may have a connection with Earth's history as Chakotay discovers that the symbols sketched in sand are similar to those he learned in his youth.  So begins Chakotay's journey of rediscovery as he and the crew of the Voyager follow the trail of the ""Sky People"".
This episode provides a great deal of background information on Chakotay, his father, and his heritage and it provides for some solid character development.  We learn that Chakotay did not always revere his ancestors or their customs as flash backs introduce us to a young, rebellious Chakotay who has little tolerance for the ways of his father.
A secondary story  which also provides for some character development is one involving our favorite Holodoc.  When the doctor fails to demonstrate any appropriate bed side manner Kes lets him have it and tells him he best acquire some or else. To prove the that the crew are all a bunch of whiners, the doctor programs a  mild case of the flu for himself to demonstrate that he is made of sterner stuff and to set an example for the crew.  The results are hilarious.
