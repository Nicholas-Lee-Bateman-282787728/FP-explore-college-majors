He usually plays the hero but in this series not so. He plays a very flawed human and his acting is excellent. Maxine Peake is outstanding, the only other drama I have seen her in was a minor role in Little Dorrit. Too bad she is very good in this role.  I purchased the too expensive Region 2 DVD because of the outstanding reviews. Check this out you won't be sorry. To the British TV execs--take a chance, issue your best  programs on Region 1 DVDs we will buy them.",1331596800,4,619,4.15
8443621,5,B004VMICJE,"The British series 'Silk' is presently being aired on TVO (TVOntario) Canada.
It is an excellent series with a perfect cast. Maxine Peake, a relative unknown, relates to her role as a lawyer with wonderful results. Expect to see her in future British productions. Rupert Penry-Jones is much better known (remember MI5 series)and continues to provide an outstanding performance.",1317513600,3,377,5.406779661016949
