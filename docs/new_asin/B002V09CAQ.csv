8559168,3,B002V09CAQ,"I'm not sure about the other D.N.Angel complete, but this one has 3 discs and it is complete series. This story is mostly about a boy is about during his 14th birthday, he will change into Dark through generation. Somehow, he change to a different person and he has a black wings like an angel, but is a phantom thief. One of the girl he love has fell in love with his dark side and other sister is a twin love him. I have seen this since I was young and I kind of get addicted to this at first because you know it is like he has to hide his identity, but there is a guy who always think he is Dark. I think both the opening and ending songs are good and the story is ok, but I don't like the ending though. This is the same as the other D.N.Angel complete but has 3 discs from 1-26 episodes.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/D-N-Angel-Complete-Collection/dp/B000BKSJ52/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">D.N.
